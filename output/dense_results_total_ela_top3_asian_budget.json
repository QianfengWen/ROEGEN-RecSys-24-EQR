Probably sensible to allocate no more than a couple of days to Tana.\nThere are actually a number of things to do in Tana and, if you can see beyond the poverty, the city is really attractive and a photographers dream. The architecture is a mix of French Countryside and Indonesia. Rice paddies scattered all over the city add a brilliant green to the pastel terracotta of the buildings. The market is wonderful offering many unique souvenirs and if you do not want to barter then try Lisy, a collection of shops with similar produce to the market at excellent prices. The Lemur Park, 45 minutes out of Tana, is well worth a visit and for gourmets there are some surprisingly good restaurants. \nTravel out of the capital is by two modes: road or air. Contrary to the main Madagascar article, as of 2005 there was no passenger rail service from the capital. Road transport is by bus to limited destinations, taxi-brousse (shared taxi) to a variety of destinations or by car rental (usually with driver). Although travel by taxi-brousse is guaranteed to try one's patience and sanity, there is quite possibly no better way to meet and interact with the locals and experience Madagascar as the Malagasy do. Air travel is the recommended method, due to the poor state of many roads, and Antananarivo is the hub city for the national carrier Air Madagascar. But of course air is more expensive.

By day it is quite safe to walk around Blantyre provided you don't look like a rich tourist, in which case you may be unpleasantly tailed by street vendors and beggars. It is possible to explore the entire city of Blantyre on foot within a couple of days, and unless you are traveling to Limbe or to the outer suburbs of Blantyre, then it is unlikely you'll require even the minibus. In the event that you do, then minibusses are very cheap, travelling between Blantyre and Limbe costs MK 150 (as of August 2012). Alternatively, you may consider hiring a bicycle if you are that way inclined. It is unsafe to walk around Blantyre during the night and we would recommend that you obtain the phone numbers of a few reliable taxi drivers (talk to some of the locals).

As an American who speaks Spanish, you can get that same car for 350 pesos, with insurance and taxes. Even if prices are posted, they can be bargained. Scooters half that (~25 dollars). Be aware that the rental insurance usually does not include thievery - if any part of the rented vehicle will get stolen you will have to pay for it from your own pocket. There are options of additional insurance options though, paid on top of the rental price. Alternatively, taxis are always available and will take you to the west-shore beaches for $20 onwards, depending on distance and number of people.

Mid-range 3 or 4-star Chinese-run hotels typically offer clean, decent sized rooms, good quality restaurants and but English-staff is spotty. There's an abundance of such hotels around the city, with a handful standing out from the rest of the pack. Splurge hotels are dominated by larger international chains, nearly all downtown.

The quality of the restaurants can be highly variable. A good rule of thumb when searching for a decent place to eat is, if the decor looks shabby but the place is packed the food is almost always good. Ordering can be tricky for non-Chinese speakers as English menus are incredibly rare in cheaper restaurants, and English speaking staff are even more rare. Try the roadside snack stalls which offer pancakes, rolls, skewers of barbecued meat and candied fruits starting at \u00a51. These may cause some upset stomachs or bouts of diarrhoea, so be advised."

Though not in Denver proper (rather, it's in the suburb of Arvada) this often-overlooked Chinese restaurant may be among the best in the entire state of Colorado. With prices that will feed even a large family for under $40, its food is consistently ranked by reviewers as spectacular, to the point where visiting politicians (congressmen, governors, even President George W. Bush) often go out of their way to stop there. The atmosphere is superb--very formal and elegant, despite the low prices. A bit of a hike from the city, however--20 or 30 minutes from downtown on a good day.\n*Illegal Pete's 1530 16th St #101, +1 303 623-2169, A local favorite hangout with great, cheap burritos!

Leela's is a combination bar/coffeehouse/cafe which is a favorite among the college crowd. There's good Italian coffee, great music (live on some nights), and great panini sandwiches. Leela's is open 24 hours as well, and free wireless internet is available, so you can be productive (or not) while waiting for your friends to arrive.\n*\"Mercury Cafe\", 19th Street and California st, A unique and quirky local spot with locally sourced and chemical-free food.

                "So, if you are a solo traveler without $150 to blow, this becomes a grueling adventure. One way to get to Bunce Island is to catch a passenger boat (one of the long roofed motorized boats, called \"pampas,\" that take people and goods up and down the harbor like a floating bus) from Big Wharf to the east of Kissy in East End of Freetown straight to Pepel (~$2). There will in all likelihood be only one of these per day, only on weekdays, and it should leave around 3PM or so, so you would need to be there earlier to make sure you get on it. Try to see Bunce Island upon arrival, so you can catch the fast boat back early in the morning, after staying in Pepel with the permission of the chief (budget a good $15-20 in leones so that you are able to pass 10,000 notes to all the necessary hands). Realistically, this won't work, though. So plan to spend the morning going to the island, then return to Pepel and hire a taxi or motorcycle taxi (\"okada\") to take you on the 90 minute dust-choked journey back to Tagrin (~$5-10) to catch the Ferry to either Kissy or Government Wharf in Freetown. In Pepel you need to bargain the price to get to the island: they might say 500Le at first, but this can very easily be bargained to 200Le, which remains a very good price for them given the short distance.",
                "There's another rough travel way to get to Bunce Island, though, that's not quite so grueling. You can take the ferry to Tagrin, then a taxi to Lungi, and then hire a local taxi in Lungi to take you to Pepel. The taxi trip from Lungi to Pepel takes about an hour and a half one-way (or three hours in both directions). Then, you can hire a local fisherman in Pepel to take you by canoe to Bunce Island, which takes about half an hour in a paddle boat or five minutes in a local boat with an outboard engine. Then after you've seen the island, you reverse your steps to return to Freetown. The major expense in this strategy is the taxi. You'll need to negotiate a daily rate with a driver in Lungi, which is probably about $50. But the advantage of this strategy is that if you start off in the morning with the first ferry to Tagrin, you may be able to complete the trip in one day. And if you have to spend the night, there are a number of hotels and guesthouses in Lungi with a range of quality and prices. \nAlso, you can go from Tagrin or from Lungi with a motorbike, the price if you bargain a bit is 60Le (4,5\u20ac) one way from Lungi.",
                "See\nMany of Freetown's attractions are underdeveloped and not well publicized. The relatively low number of tourists visiting has meant there was not an adequate incentive or financial reward for developing them. However, there are many hidden gems that can be well worth finding. It is not unusual to be the only visitor to some of them."

                "So there are some things to watch out for:\n*At night - There is a general rule of the thumb in Guatemala City (depending on the 'zona'): DON'T walk around at night. In most other Latin American cities you would be fine if going out at as a group and stay in nice areas but in Guatemala City most streets are empty at night. Unless you're in Zona 9, 10, 13, 14, 15 or 16, don't walk around at night. If you want to go somewhere else hop on a taxi or an Uber and make sure it leaves you in front of your destination. \n*Pickpockets - Pickpockets and thiefs are present in Guatemala City as in any other city in the world. Be careful in crowded streets of the city center and packed buses during the day. Always watch your belongings, don't carry more cash than you need for the day and don't put them all in one place. DON'T wear flashy jewelerry like necklaces, braclets, watches and especially earings that if snatched can injure their owner. In addition, don't show around your camera too much and, as hard as this might be, keep your phone usage to the BARE MINIMUM. \n*Public Transport - Public Transport in Guatemala City is quite limited and unfortunately a bit inefficient. Buses are the main way to get around followed by taxis and Ubers. You can use buses with a high degree of safety during the day (always watch out for pickpockets) but DON'T use buses at night. Incidents occur inside buses that range from sexual harassment to armed robberies every night. Taxis are okay to use but never hail a cab on the street or enter white taxis; most of them are not regulated and you have a very high chance of being robbed. Use official taxi apps from reputable companies to call a taxi. Uber is another safe and cheap method to get around\n*Driving - Driving in Guatemala City can be kind of hectic especially during rush hour when the roads are packed. Due to the fact that public transport ranges from inefficient to tragic, most residents move around by car and this can result in huge traffic jams at some times during the day. Be on watch for aggressive drivers. At night it's better to stay on the main avenues and always drive with your windows closed. Car-jackings are not uncommon in isolated streets and even in the avenues after midnight. If a person or a group comes suspiciously close to your car when you're stopped in a red light GO. It's very unlikely that you'll get in trouble and even the police do it sometimes. \n*Police - The police in Guatemala unfortunately is not very effective due to being under-funded by the goverment and some police officers have problems with corruption. Be alert if you're stopped but also be polite; not everyone is corrupt and some policemen/-women are nice and helpful.\n*Political Demonstrations - Public Demonstration against the goverment do happen sometimes in Guatemala City. They don't usually turn violent but it's better to just stay out of them and continue your way.",

The problem is that Cuba has a dual economy, if you could live on pesos it would be incredibly cheap. Sadly, as a tourist this is virtually impossible. Most peso hotels won't take foreigners or, if they do you have to pay in CUC. If you are on any kind of a budget it is advised to stay in ; it is much cheaper, often more comfortable and the food (a recurring theme in Cuba) is almost invariably better. Food, transport, but also certain souvenirs you can buy both in CUC and CUP. In the old town you will find many expensive places, especially on pedestrian roads like O'Reilly, Obispo and Obrapia. Some parallel streets can be a lot cheaper and even peso restaurants can be found. Don't get fooled by the art and souvenir shops on those main roads. For example: they sell propaganda posters, supposedly originals or very precious prints, for prices around 20CUC, sometimes 15CUC. This is far from the actual value. Look for shops outside of the center. In the harbour area there is a little market were the price for the same posters already drop down to 6CUC each - if you manage to find some locals to give you help it can be even cheaper. Another examples are propaganda comic books about the revolution. In the tourist bookshops they cost 7CUC and that's also the number written on the first page. Actually it used to mean 7CUP. For this price the comic books are available in normal bookshops addressed to Cubans outside of the center. Ideally, you ask someone to help you finding those places.",

This is a good way to travel overnight, especially if you are able to find cheap accomodations, such as a business hotel.

You will more than likely find good accomodations very close to a main train station in a smaller city, compared to a big city such as Tokyo, and it will more than likely be cheaper than hotels found in a big city.

It is one of the most architecturally pleasing small cities in all of Guangdong, and one of the very richest.

A few of them can become quite persistent but most will not bother you if you ignore them. During the day you need to stay vigilant and be careful of your belongings and luggage. If you arrive after nightfall minimize walking around as much as possible and take a cab to reach your hotel; if you walk with your luggage during the night in the area it's like putting a sign on your head saying \"TOURIST\".

Always secure your bags with both straps on your shoulders, carry as much cash as needed for your day, and if possible don't have your mobile phones in your pocket. Don't flash around expensive jewelry, cameras, necklaces, or other expensive items. Be alert at all times in buses, trams, and the metro, and don't leave your personal belongings unattended in a cafeteria or a restaurant table. If you have a car: make sure that you don't leave anything valuable inside that can be seen from outside and park in secure parking and not on the street whenever possible. You might have heard about thieves on board Vespas or other kinds of motorcycles running around stealing bags right off people's shoulders. This is not a myth and it used to happen but such occurrences subsided a lot in recent years as the police have stepped up their presence in the city. In the unlikely event that this happens DON'T hold on to your bag; the vespa is much stronger than you and this could result in serious injuries."

Yes, it may be a little hectic, and it might require some research, but this method carries two significant advantages: location and money. You will more than likely find good accommodation very close to a main train station in a smaller city, compared to a big city such as Tokyo, and it will more than likely be cheaper than hotels found in Tokyo. You could use the money you save to forward some of your luggage to Osaka using a luggage delivery service and take an overnight bag with you, which will make the journey easier.",

Most part of the city are residential areas, so probably not worth visiting in itself, but worth a half-day exploration if you are passing through to another destination.\n \nThe center of the city lies on a plateau overlooking the bay to the southeast. The airport lies a few kilometers to the northeast.\n \nGet in\n \nPraia has an international airport. TACV (national flag carrier) and TAP airlines fly to various destinations in Europe, Africa, South America and United States. Taxis from the airport to Plateau cost 800/1000. You can pay in Euros (10\u20ac to Praia in June 2016). There is one bus line that serves the airport but it\u2019s better to just take a taxi since there is actually only one or two buses that serves this line. You can also enter the city through the port. There are ferry boats that have irregular service to and from the islands of Maio, Boavista, Sal and Sao Nicolau, and more regular and scheduled service to and from Sao Vicente and Fogo. You can exchange money at hotel (1 \u20ac= 105 Escudos) or in the city (1 \u20ac= 110 \u20ac in June 2016).\n \nGet around\n \nThe city has countless bus stops, and taxis are everywhere waiting for customers. There are two main bus companies that serve the city, Moura Company and Sol Atlantico. Each route has their own numbers. The main lines are from Safende to Achada Santo Antonio, Vila Nova to Achada Santo Antonio, Calbeceira to Palmarejo, Pensamento to Terra Branca, Achada Grande to Achada Santo Antonio, Sao Felipe to Plateau, Ponta D'Agua to Plateau,Achada Mato to Palmarejo. Most of these lines pass by Plateau (city center), Varzea and Terra Branca, the bus fair is about 35 escudos. When it comes to taxis you should be careful with illegal taxis that sometimes roam around and might rip you off. The normal taxi fare between two furthest points of the city shouldn\u2019t be more 1500 escudos in daytime and 1800 escudos at night time, example Pensamento to Palmarejo, or Palmarejo to Achada Mato. Taxi drivers usually expect to get a tip, give around 50 escudos to 100 escudos. Just be careful and always drive with the taxis that have a taximeter, so that they don\u2019t overcharge you.\n \nThe city doesn\u2019t really have a good way to navigate because of the lack of an official map. This is because large part of the city doesn\u2019t have their names or house numbers yet. In the city center and in the more important parts of the city most streets have names and numbers. However, most people are friendly and will give you directions. Walking by foot between the different districts is not recommended, especially since most of the city's side walks are made out of loose cobblestone and is difficult to walk, also because the city is full of hills that can be tiring to walk. But if you want to have a good cardio-workout try it!\n \nSee\n \n*\n \n*\n \n*\n \nDo\n \nBuy\n \nAv. Amircal Cabral is the main street. Parallel to this, you have a pedestrian street with some shops including a Souvenir Shop. Normally close at 18 h.\n \nEat\n \n*A great place to eat local food and watch the world go by.\n \nDrink\n \nSleep\n \nBudget \n*Newly renovated bed & breakfast located in the heart of the city of Praia, known as Plateau, near the Presidential Palace. Friendly staff, very clean and quiet rooms. Breakfast included. \n \nMid-range\n \n* In Praiha, south of the centre of town near the beaches\n \n*\n \n*\n \n*\n \n*This three star hotel is a bit past its prime, but is bright and clean.\n \nSplurge\n \nPraia's high-end options are located south of the main town in the area of Prainha.\n \n* 10min to centre of the Praia. 5km from the airport.\n \n* Decrepit infrastructure, outrageously overpriced. \n \nStay Safe\n \nBeing the capital and biggest city of the country, Praia has a higher crime rate than most parts of the country. Most crimes involve petty thievery and these are mostly focused on actual residents and not on tourists, although there have been a few cases which involved tourists. So Praia is still a very safe city, just be careful with flaunting any expensive jewelry or gadgets like iPhones and such. Cape Verde in the past few years has seen an increase of petty crimes which are done mostly by groups of young people so avoid groups of young men especially at night.\n \nPraia is also a badly illuminated city at night, so be careful in places that might not have street lights and is somewhat isolated, always travel in pairs or in groups for safety. However if anything does occur there are police stations in various parts of the city and a general hospital in the city center.\n \nThe stairs at the edge of Achada Santo Antonio towards Plateau are unsafe, also during the day, avoid that neighbourhood.\n \nAt night, take a taxi.\n \n \nCope\n \n \nEmbassies & Consulates\n \n* \n \n* \n \n* \n \n* \n \nGet out\n \n, the historic capital, is an easy half-day trip.\n \nYou can rent a car or ask for a full day tour (9 hours) for a round trip island."

Beware that the buses tend to get crowded and tend to be late. You might get denied entry if the bus cannot hold more passengers and support buses don't usually get dispatched. Buses can seem costly depending on where you are from(11kn per card, per person, per ride), however, if you plan on using the city bus company (Pulapromet) actively, you should make yourself a BusCard. The BusCard is a electromagnetic ticket that you can fill with money and then use for cheaper bus rides. The price of a buscard is 30kn but they sell them for 70kn since they are prefilled with 40kn you can use on the bus. The BusCard reduces drastically the price of the ride making it 7kn per hour on the city lines (lines 1 to 9). Also, up to 5 people can use the same BusCard at the same moment, for the same bus. Besides, the credit on the BusCard lasts forever, meaning you can save it for the next time you come to Pula without fearing money loss. You can buy it at the main bus station in the Pulapromet booth, on newsstands that show the BusCard sticker, or on the bus by the driver. Ask for a Vrijednosna.

A person going anywhere else in the city on the bus must purchase 1-2 transfers (as will be needed and when entering the first bus) at 15 cents each and change buses either at the North Star Mall Terminal, downtown, or where any bus line they need crosses Line 5's route. However, a trip can be time-consuming if a transfer is required.\n \n* Taxis are the cheapest option for service for 2 or more passengers going anywhere in the city if not taking the public bus because they are priced by the carload rather than per person.

The taxi ranks (at both terminals) are manned by personnel who can call a larger taxi to the front of the line for groups of up to 6 people with luggage.

Firstly, drivers are known to charge far more to tourists who have just arrived and do not know the area, so you can easily end up paying at least double of normal price. It is advisable to get an idea of the maximum cost of taxi before you arrive (ask your hostel/hotel) and negotiating the price with the driver in advance. Should there be a problem when you arrive at your destination and the driver suddenly speaks less English, ask at your accommodation for help - they will be used to dealing with this scam. Secondly, the other well-known \"taxi scam\" operates in Sarajevo, where the unsuspecting tourist will be taken to a more expensive hotel than the one he or she has asked to be taken to, and the driver and receptionist will swear that the new arrival is in fact in the right place. Have a picture of where you are staying ready, or at least be familiar with its appearance.

Champai has the biggest stretch of plains in Mizoram, which are used for rice cultivation. The road from Aizwal to Champai is not very good in some places and it takes about 8 hours one way by a shared SUMO.

Although travel by taxi-brousse is guaranteed to try one's patience and sanity, there is quite possibly no better way to meet and interact with the locals and experience Madagascar as the Malagasy do.

                "Cope\nBishkek is the Eastern Europe of 30 years ago, except with mobile phones and internet access. It is more or less a museum relic of the former Soviet Union Bloc. Despite Kyrgyzstan's poverty and the decay of its infrastructure, Bishkek remains a relatively safe, clean, functional city. Bishkek is not an old city and possesses no ancient landmarks, but it nonetheless has its own kind of charm, which often arouses nostalgia in people who knew the old Soviet Union. For most travelers, Bishkek is merely a stop on the Silk Road to refresh supplies before returning to the mountains. However, expatriates who call Bishkek home generally consider themselves lucky to benefit from its easygoing lifestyle, open-minded spirit, party culture and low cost of living. If you come with the right expectations you might find yourself pleasantly surprised!"

Newer Western-style shops are available for those who just want to get in and get out (i.e. Game and Shoprite at Chichiri). Savers Choice is a well-stocked Asian-run store heading toward Limbe that caters to the expat community with hard-to-find food items, a good bakery, an ice-cream bar, and a candy shop.

By day it is quite safe to walk around Blantyre provided you don't look like a rich tourist, in which case you may be unpleasantly tailed by street vendors and beggars. It is possible to explore the entire city of Blantyre on foot within a couple of days, and unless you are traveling to Limbe or to the outer suburbs of Blantyre, then it is unlikely you'll require even the minibus. In the event that you do, then minibusses are very cheap, travelling between Blantyre and Limbe costs MK 150 (as of August 2012). Alternatively, you may consider hiring a bicycle if you are that way inclined. It is unsafe to walk around Blantyre during the night and we would recommend that you obtain the phone numbers of a few reliable taxi drivers (talk to some of the locals). Taxis are relatively more expensive, and the price also depends on how far the driver has to come to pick you up, but this is much preferable to being mugged in a dark Blantyre street late at night. As a general rule, all taxi drivers begin at the Mount Soche Hotel.",

All villages have a central kafenion (coffee shop) which is where all people eventually end up. The kafenion, apart from being a place to meet friends for a coffee, raki or a game of tavli (backgammon), is used as the main information center of the village. Be aware, however, that the kafenion is still very much a male dominion and women are generally not found inside (as opposed to a kafeteria or regular cafe), though the local custom of philoxenia(hospitality) usually ensures that Western couples and mixed groups are accepted. Most villages have war memorials and the locals will willingly fill in any missing information. Gavalohori has a wonderful Folklore Museum where much about village life can be learned.",

You pay about $20 for a jeep rental or a moped for the entire day and you get free breakfast at a five star resort. A regular day car rental is around $55, but speaking Spanish will get you a discount 95% of the places if you ask.

As an American who speaks Spanish, you can get that same car for 350 pesos, with insurance and taxes. Even if prices are posted, they can be bargained. Scooters half that (~25 dollars). Be aware that the rental insurance usually does not include thievery - if any part of the rented vehicle will get stolen you will have to pay for it from your own pocket. There are options of additional insurance options though, paid on top of the rental price.

The problem is that Cuba has a dual economy, if you could live on pesos it would be incredibly cheap. Sadly, as a tourist this is virtually impossible. Most peso hotels won't take foreigners or, if they do you have to pay in CUC. If you are on any kind of a budget it is advised to stay in ; it is much cheaper, often more comfortable and the food (a recurring theme in Cuba) is almost invariably better. Food, transport, but also certain souvenirs you can buy both in CUC and CUP. In the old town you will find many expensive places, especially on pedestrian roads like O'Reilly, Obispo and Obrapia. Some parallel streets can be a lot cheaper and even peso restaurants can be found. Don't get fooled by the art and souvenir shops on those main roads. For example: they sell propaganda posters, supposedly originals or very precious prints, for prices around 20CUC, sometimes 15CUC. This is far from the actual value. Look for shops outside of the center. In the harbour area there is a little market were the price for the same posters already drop down to 6CUC each - if you manage to find some locals to give you help it can be even cheaper. Another examples are propaganda comic books about the revolution. In the tourist bookshops they cost 7CUC and that's also the number written on the first page. Actually it used to mean 7CUP. For this price the comic books are available in normal bookshops addressed to Cubans outside of the center. Ideally, you ask someone to help you finding those places."

Suggested places to try:\n** Cafe Mexicho\n** Melon: 9a 7th Ave (\u260e +27 (0)11 482-2477): Upmarket restaurant with great ambiance.\n** Ant's Cafe: A quirky and very vibey pizza spot. Friendly service, good South African wine and delicious pizza. Special pizza price on Mondays\n** The Catz Pyjamas, 12 Main Road (\u260e +27 (0)11 726-8596): Trendy always-open bistro. Menu from breakfast to dinner to dessert. Good bar selection. Friendly service.\n** The Lucky Bean Restuarant, 16 7th St (\u260e +27 (0)11 482-5572): Fusion cooking in a relaxed atmosphere. Live DJ music on weekends. Albeit still recommended by many guide books, this place has disappointed many people with mediocre food lately.\n** IT corner, 7th street corner to 4th avenue. Simple but nice coffee shop, internet access, good coffees and snacks. Some newspapers, laptops for hire to use the internet, okay staff.",
                "When on the street (this doesn\u2019t apply to shopping malls and other secure environments) best general advice is to try your best to look like a local and to avoid displaying any form of wealth. Keep your cellphone hidden, leave your jewellery at the hotel and avoid carrying backpacks, daypacks, cameras or purses. Use a cheap plastic bag, keep your values at the hotel and take only the amount of money that you really need. Never use a purse, but put loose coins or notes in your pockets.",

Gunfire and random explosions are frequent. If you must venture around the city, you should be accompanied by armed and well trained security personnel and ride in an armored vehicle. These arrangements should be made in advance through private security and tactical firms which specialize in these types of environments. Most employers and governmental bodies that might send you here are well aware of the situation on the ground and will do their best to keep you safe, but your head must be on a swivel to your surroundings 24/7. Make 100% certain that any hotel accommodations that are made come with 24 hour private security, which is standard at most hotels in the city catering to foreigners. Even so, hotel bombings and suicide attacks are frequent.\n \nBasic services such as electricity are not reliable many hours of the day, and you should not drink the water under any circumstances. Food and bottled drinks sold in the city may or may not be safe to consume either. Try to get the advice of another foreigner who has been in the city before, or follow the advice of your employer. Health and consular services are either limited or nonexistent."

If you have a car: make sure that you don't leave anything valuable inside that can be seen from outside and park in secure parking and not on the street whenever possible. You might have heard about thieves on board Vespas or other kinds of motorcycles running around stealing bags right off people's shoulders. This is not a myth and it used to happen but such occurrences subsided a lot in recent years as the police have stepped up their presence in the city. In the unlikely event that this happens DON'T hold on to your bag; the vespa is much stronger than you and this could result in serious injuries.",

Its territory, particularly the iconic sight of the Gulf of Naples (but also Mount Vesuvius, the music, etc.) is arguably one of the most powerful symbolic images of Italy.",
                "Sleep\nAccommodation in Naples is normally cheaper than in Rome or northern Italian cities, but the quality may vary a lot. It's not uncommon to encounter hot water shortages, short power outages, and less than luxurious bed and bath linens. Also don't expect a full-sized bathtub in reasonably priced hotels. You may not even get a shower stall in the bathroom, but a drain hole that is in the center of the bathroom with a toilet, a sink, and a showerhead along the plain tiled walls. Breakfast may include weak orange juice (tasting more like the powdered orange drink), hard rolls, and an assortment of hard meats and cheeses. Nothing mentioned here is meant to discourage but to help you view your experience as an adventure in Italian culture."

Service is very curt, and they may close early on some days, or not even open at all, if they \"feel like it.\"\n*\"No Grits, No Glory\" is the motto of this Southern diner, and it's a good slogan for how to eat here; if you aren't going to order the grits, don't bother. First opened in 1945, this greasy-spoon diner hasn't changed anything other than its prices ever since. The Nassau grits, served with ham, tomatoes, peppers, and onions, were mentioned in Saveur magazine, and are worth an order. The regulars, who love the cheap food here, tend to stick with eggs, biscuits, and bacon or a smoked pork chop, with a bottomless cup of thin coffee.

Come by in the morning, when the sun sparkles on the water and the freight trains thunder on the beach beneath you.\n* You can get almost any topping you want on your hot dog for no extra cost here, but their best is the Cole Slaw Hound, with chili, cheese, and cole slaw.

They speak in awed, hushed tones about cheese danishes the size of your head. You will too, once you try one. $1-3.\n*While not actually a drive-in, this is a great place to sit and enjoy a cheap beer while watching the regulars eat delicious hamburgers, fried chicken livers and onion rings. Famous in the city for their double-bacon cheeseburgers and from-scratch milkshakes, there is usually a line to get a table. Bring cash, since credit cards aren't accepted at this mom and pop place. $2-7.\n* Eating a fresh, hot Krispy Kreme donut proves that you're a Pensacola tourist 'in the know.' Although the donuts from this factory are no different than any other in the South, Pensacolians harbor a strange attachment to the sticky sweet pastry. When the building reopened after a three month renovation, it made front page news in the city newspaper; truly, a bastion of Southern culture. $0.50-$1.50 per donut. $2-4 for specialty coffee.\n*Built in the basement of the old Sacred Heart Hospital, inside the morgue, O'Zone Pizza offers more than just fresh pizza and beer; it offers an experience that borders on terrifying.

The city is located in the southern end of Santiago Island and has year round good weather. The city is divided into various small unofficial districts, the most important ones being, Plateau (city center), Achada Santo Antonio, Palmarejo, Fazenda, Achada Grande, Varzea, Safende, Sucupira(bazaar area), Calbeciera, Terra Branca, Vila Nova, Achadinha, Bairro, Prainha, Monte Vermelho, Achada Mato, Achada Sao Felipe, and other smaller ones. Most part of the city are residential areas, so probably not worth visiting in itself, but worth a half-day exploration if you are passing through to another destination.\n \nThe center of the city lies on a plateau overlooking the bay to the southeast. The airport lies a few kilometers to the northeast.\n \nGet in\n \nPraia has an international airport. TACV (national flag carrier) and TAP airlines fly to various destinations in Europe, Africa, South America and United States. Taxis from the airport to Plateau cost 800/1000. You can pay in Euros (10\u20ac to Praia in June 2016). There is one bus line that serves the airport but it\u2019s better to just take a taxi since there is actually only one or two buses that serves this line. You can also enter the city through the port. There are ferry boats that have irregular service to and from the islands of Maio, Boavista, Sal and Sao Nicolau, and more regular and scheduled service to and from Sao Vicente and Fogo. You can exchange money at hotel (1 \u20ac= 105 Escudos) or in the city (1 \u20ac= 110 \u20ac in June 2016).\n \nGet around\n \nThe city has countless bus stops, and taxis are everywhere waiting for customers. There are two main bus companies that serve the city, Moura Company and Sol Atlantico. Each route has their own numbers. The main lines are from Safende to Achada Santo Antonio, Vila Nova to Achada Santo Antonio, Calbeceira to Palmarejo, Pensamento to Terra Branca, Achada Grande to Achada Santo Antonio, Sao Felipe to Plateau, Ponta D'Agua to Plateau,Achada Mato to Palmarejo. Most of these lines pass by Plateau (city center), Varzea and Terra Branca, the bus fair is about 35 escudos. When it comes to taxis you should be careful with illegal taxis that sometimes roam around and might rip you off. The normal taxi fare between two furthest points of the city shouldn\u2019t be more 1500 escudos in daytime and 1800 escudos at night time, example Pensamento to Palmarejo, or Palmarejo to Achada Mato. Taxi drivers usually expect to get a tip, give around 50 escudos to 100 escudos. Just be careful and always drive with the taxis that have a taximeter, so that they don\u2019t overcharge you.\n \nThe city doesn\u2019t really have a good way to navigate because of the lack of an official map. This is because large part of the city doesn\u2019t have their names or house numbers yet. In the city center and in the more important parts of the city most streets have names and numbers. However, most people are friendly and will give you directions. Walking by foot between the different districts is not recommended, especially since most of the city's side walks are made out of loose cobblestone and is difficult to walk, also because the city is full of hills that can be tiring to walk.

Most crimes involve petty thievery and these are mostly focused on actual residents and not on tourists, although there have been a few cases which involved tourists. So Praia is still a very safe city, just be careful with flaunting any expensive jewelry or gadgets like iPhones and such. Cape Verde in the past few years has seen an increase of petty crimes which are done mostly by groups of young people so avoid groups of young men especially at night.\n \nPraia is also a badly illuminated city at night, so be careful in places that might not have street lights and is somewhat isolated, always travel in pairs or in groups for safety. However if anything does occur there are police stations in various parts of the city and a general hospital in the city center.\n \nThe stairs at the edge of Achada Santo Antonio towards Plateau are unsafe, also during the day, avoid that neighbourhood.\n \nAt night, take a taxi.\n \n \nCope\n \n \nEmbassies & Consulates\n \n* \n \n* \n \n* \n \n* \n \nGet out\n \n, the historic capital, is an easy half-day trip.\n \nYou can rent a car or ask for a full day tour (9 hours) for a round trip island."

The BusCard is a electromagnetic ticket that you can fill with money and then use for cheaper bus rides.

Besides, the credit on the BusCard lasts forever, meaning you can save it for the next time you come to Pula without fearing money loss.

A person going anywhere else in the city on the bus must purchase 1-2 transfers (as will be needed and when entering the first bus) at 15 cents each and change buses either at the North Star Mall Terminal, downtown, or where any bus line they need crosses Line 5's route.
