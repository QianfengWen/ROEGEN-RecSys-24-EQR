Also, due to the altitude, the capital is significantly colder than the coastal areas. Probably sensible to allocate no more than a couple of days to Tana.\nThere are actually a number of things to do in Tana and, if you can see beyond the poverty, the city is really attractive and a photographers dream. The architecture is a mix of French Countryside and Indonesia. Rice paddies scattered all over the city add a brilliant green to the pastel terracotta of the buildings. The market is wonderful offering many unique souvenirs and if you do not want to barter then try Lisy, a collection of shops with similar produce to the market at excellent prices. The Lemur Park, 45 minutes out of Tana, is well worth a visit and for gourmets there are some surprisingly good restaurants. \nTravel out of the capital is by two modes: road or air. Contrary to the main Madagascar article, as of 2005 there was no passenger rail service from the capital. Road transport is by bus to limited destinations, taxi-brousse (shared taxi) to a variety of destinations or by car rental (usually with driver). Although travel by taxi-brousse is guaranteed to try one's patience and sanity, there is quite possibly no better way to meet and interact with the locals and experience Madagascar as the Malagasy do.

The former Malagasy Franc (Franc Malgache) is now obsolete. The new currency is called the Ariary (Ar-ee-ar) and is worth 5 Francs. For example, 10,000 Francs = 2000 Ariary. When negotiating a price, ALWAYS CONFIRM THE AMOUNT IN ARIARY. Many locals take advantage of tourists by simply stating the amount due without specifying the currency, so many tourists are duped into paying 5 times the actual amount due because of Dollar/Franc/Ariary confusion.\n* It is generally not advisable for non-French speaking tourists to wander around the city unaccompanied by a guide or local.

Old Fort Erie is a reconstructed British military garrison that was the scene of several battles of the War of 1812. From May to October, Fort Erie Racetrack & Slots offers exciting thoroughbred horse racing including the Prince of Wales Stakes, the second jewel in the Canadian Triple Crown. Games of chance can be enjoyed at Uncle Sam's Bingo Palace and Golden Nugget Bingo.

Niagara Falls, Ontario is very different from its U.S. counterpart: the views of the Falls are almost unanimously considered to be better, but rather than the comparatively quiet greenery that abuts the falls on the American side, Niagara Falls, Ontario boasts Clifton Hill, a gaudy tourist area adjacent to the falls that consists of swanky high-rise hotels, a pair of casinos, restaurants, nightclubs, and gimmicky tourist traps such as the Ripley's Believe It Or Not Museum and the Movieland Wax Museum. Though gritty urban streets such as those of Niagara Falls, New York are almost unheard of on the Canadian side, it's often said that the Las Vegas-style neon jungle that has sprouted in Niagara Falls, Ontario detracts from the majesty of the falls themselves. It's considerably quieter outside of the main tourist district, with romantic B&Bs, verdant parkland, and (further north) wineries lining the Niagara Parkway, one of the area's most scenic drives that runs along the Canadian side of the Niagara River from Fort Erie to Niagara-on-the-Lake.

Today, visitors to Niagara Falls often make side trips to Niagara-on-the-Lake to take in the picture-perfect streets of the town center, whose stone buildings give off the ambience of a prim British village. Wine lovers will note that the town is located in the heart of the Niagara Peninsula wine country, and history buffs can tour restored military sites such as Fort George. Niagara-on-the-Lake is also notable as the home of the long-running Shaw Festival each year from April until November, performances of selected plays of George Bernard Shaw or his contemporaries are held in three historic theatres in the town.\n*The extends between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, immediately west of Buffalo.

                "The statistics of the Venezuelan Observatory of Violence have been strongly biased, as demonstrated by Dorothy Kronick of Prodavinci. However, the crime problem is still serious. Kronick's estimates were not far behind in demonstrating the violence in Caracas, but they made evident the statistical errors of some NGOs. Robberies, assaults and kidnappings are very common, so it is recommended not to go out on the street with valuable items, keep cell phones out of sight of others while in public places, and avoid certain areas of Caracas. The latest security report of the United States Embassy is updated (January 2018). Previously, the districts of Chacao and Baruta were quite safe, but the situation has changed. In fact, kidnapping is very common in these districts, and tourists are not exempt from being kidnapped. The kidnappers demand sums of money that can reach 20 thousand dollars, or risk killing their victims. Las Mercedes and El Rosal are excellent alternatives for the most demanding tourists who have a comfortable budget to pay for line taxis or rent a car in the city. To walk the city and use public transport, the ideal area of \u200b\u200bthe city may be Sabana Grande, following the recommendations of the hotel, though this is a dice-roll in itself. The previously mentioned districts have safer areas than others and the hotel will provide you with the necessary information to make your stay in Caracas a pleasant one, though again, this can be seriously dicey due to the ongoing, unpredictable situation. Hotel Alex and Hotel Waldorf are the most recommended options to stay in the center of Caracas, both hotels are in La Candelaria. Hotel Waldorf is a brand new five star hotel and it is a landmark of Venezuelan architecture.",
                "Visitors need to be aware that Caracas remains one of the most violent cities in the world, with large parts of the city effectively No Go Areas to outsiders. Murder tallies of as many as 40 are not uncommon on weekends, so exercising caution and common sense - especially at night - is essential to a safe visit.",
                "The police in most districts of the city tend to be corrupt, including at the international airport. Nowadays, there are no safe districts at all. It is advisable to avoid dark streets after 9 PM, the same applies in daytimes where areas are isolated. Lonely streets are not recommended. Tourists should stay in areas frequented by high vehicular and pedestrian traffic, though crime can and will still happen on even frequented areas. Venezuelans in general are friendly and helpful and living through the danger on a daily basis, so will not be shy in their concerns for your safety (this, however, is nothing but a mere facade). Dress like the average Venezuelan and follow the indications of the hotel. It is more likely that you will do okay, if you can survive through most of the days. Venezuelans in general are friendly and helpful, though they will openly avoid helping those who are victims of crime so asking for help, even in crucial situations, will drive them away. The most common recommendation is not to take the smartphone in open places. Kidnapping is a major problem for middle and upper-class Venezuelans, travelers included if they're that unlucky. As with many other developing nations, petty theft is a problem. Ask hotel management to store your valuables when you leave your room and use a money belt for your passport/extra cash when traveling. If, however, you're very cautious, it's best to never bring valuables with you at all."

In some areas, such as the Maarif and Gironde neighborhoods, seeing a man in a djellaba or a donkey pulling a cart of vegetables are rarities.

It is inadvisable to walk alone in Casablanca at night.

Though most of the tourist industry in the city is targeted at the domestic, rather than the international market, overseas tourists should still find enjoyment in the city. The large number of foreign businesses in the city and foreign students and teachers at the city's many universities ensure that there are plenty of companies (from upmarket hotels to bars and coffee houses) which cater to those who do not call China their native home.

Additionally, some surfaces consist of shiny tile which make for beautiful viewing but can be incredibly slippery when wet or during the winter when snow may be hiding the slick surface underneath. Lastly, the sidewalks may have pits or missing utility covers, along with low-hanging clothes lines draped in front of businesses or homes, so be on the lookout at night when it can be harder to see these hangups. Controlled crosswalks and pedestrian tunnels (along with a few pedestrian bridges) make it easy to cross major intersections.

This type of violence though doesn't usually involve tourists and most have no problems visiting Fortaleza after taking some basic precautions. Some things to watch out are:\n*Pickpockets - Pickpockets and petty thiefs are a major problem in Fortaleza just like any other city in the world. They roam the city center and the beaches looking for easy victimes in the face of tourists. Avoid carrying too much cash with you, use credit cards for most of your transactions if possible, and if you do put them all in different places. It would be useful to have a second purse with you in such cases. Always have a copy of your ID, passport or other important documents and keep your phone usage in public to the BARE MINIMUM. Don't display any jewelerry (thiefs have been known to snatch necklaces and earings right of people's ears and necks) and don't show your camera too much. NEVER leave anything unattended in restaurants or cafes and ESPECIALLY beaches. Be very cautious during the Carnival too. Take only what you need to with you and take special care of your belongings in street parties and late night bashes. \n*Public Transport - Public Transport is generally safe in Fortaleza. Be very careful of your belongings during the day in buses and avoid taking them during the night as incidents inside buses have been reported. One thing tourists should worry about are taxis. Always take official, licensed cabs. Do not get in any unmarked taxis, especially if someone has solicited a ride for you. Check with your hotel to identify the official registered taxi companies in the city and stick only with them to avoid any hidden charges or unpleasant rides. Uber and Lyft are also popular in Fortaleza. \n*Prostitution - Fortaleza is a well-known city for tourist prostitution. Men in particular are often the victim of drugging and robbing crimes by prostitutes, often using a sleeping pill to knock the guys out (unless they\u2019ve passed out as a result of their own alcohol and drug consumption). Many hotels and residence buildings have a registry of late night arrivals, or at least security cameras that can catch a glimpse of the perpetrator. Get these details and then go to the police. Move fast, though, because the stolen cash and items will disappear fast.",

                "So there are some things to watch out for:\n*At night - There is a general rule of the thumb in Guatemala City (depending on the 'zona'): DON'T walk around at night. In most other Latin American cities you would be fine if going out at as a group and stay in nice areas but in Guatemala City most streets are empty at night. Unless you're in Zona 9, 10, 13, 14, 15 or 16, don't walk around at night. If you want to go somewhere else hop on a taxi or an Uber and make sure it leaves you in front of your destination. \n*Pickpockets - Pickpockets and thiefs are present in Guatemala City as in any other city in the world. Be careful in crowded streets of the city center and packed buses during the day. Always watch your belongings, don't carry more cash than you need for the day and don't put them all in one place. DON'T wear flashy jewelerry like necklaces, braclets, watches and especially earings that if snatched can injure their owner. In addition, don't show around your camera too much and, as hard as this might be, keep your phone usage to the BARE MINIMUM. \n*Public Transport - Public Transport in Guatemala City is quite limited and unfortunately a bit inefficient. Buses are the main way to get around followed by taxis and Ubers. You can use buses with a high degree of safety during the day (always watch out for pickpockets) but DON'T use buses at night. Incidents occur inside buses that range from sexual harassment to armed robberies every night. Taxis are okay to use but never hail a cab on the street or enter white taxis; most of them are not regulated and you have a very high chance of being robbed. Use official taxi apps from reputable companies to call a taxi. Uber is another safe and cheap method to get around\n*Driving - Driving in Guatemala City can be kind of hectic especially during rush hour when the roads are packed. Due to the fact that public transport ranges from inefficient to tragic, most residents move around by car and this can result in huge traffic jams at some times during the day. Be on watch for aggressive drivers. At night it's better to stay on the main avenues and always drive with your windows closed. Car-jackings are not uncommon in isolated streets and even in the avenues after midnight. If a person or a group comes suspiciously close to your car when you're stopped in a red light GO. It's very unlikely that you'll get in trouble and even the police do it sometimes. \n*Police - The police in Guatemala unfortunately is not very effective due to being under-funded by the goverment and some police officers have problems with corruption. Be alert if you're stopped but also be polite; not everyone is corrupt and some policemen/-women are nice and helpful.\n*Political Demonstrations - Public Demonstration against the goverment do happen sometimes in Guatemala City. They don't usually turn violent but it's better to just stay out of them and continue your way.",
                "The Zones\nGuatemala City is divided into different Zones. It's essential to know which zones are safe, less safe or a complete no-go for tourists. Here's a rundown of the zones:\n*Zona 1 - Zona 1 is essentially the downtown of Guatemala City. This where you will most likely start your tour of the city as here are most of the tourist attractions. During the day you'll find many visitors seeing the sights and locals shopping, eating or working. It's ok to wander the zone during the day but stay in populated areas and don't enter side streets. At night avoid the zone COMPLETELY. Once shops close the area becomes deserted and dark. There are many cheap hotels and hostels here but it's better to stay in another a bit pricier but safer part of town. \n*Zona 10, 13, 14, 15 and 16 - Zones 10, 13, 14, 15 and 16 are essentially the \"safe\" areas of Guatemala where the upper middle class and wealthy citizens live. These areas are full of gated communities like Colonia Oakland, Colonia La Canada (where many foreign embassies are located) and others. Here are also the cities more reputable hotels aimed directly at tourists. \n*Zona 2, 4, and 17 - Zones 2, 4, 9 and 17 are the \"middle\" zones when it comes to crime. They are generally considered nice for tourists to stay but you should be more vigilant here at nighttime than in the safer aforementioned zones. You should always do more research when booking a hotel in Zona 2 and Zona 17 as some parts are much more dangerous than others. \n*Zona 3, 5..8, 11, 12, 17...21 - All the Zones from 5 to 8 and 17 to 21 along with Zona 3 and Zones 11-12 are very dangerous. Tourists SHOULD NOT go there at any time of day. These are the parts of the city where 80% of the violent crime happens as armed robberies and muggings are common even at noon. You should know too that some of these Zones (like the notorious Zona 3) are controlled by gangs who won't hesitate to shoot at you if you enter the area, even accidentally.",
                "Stay safe\nGuatemala City can be either very safe or very dangerous, depending on the zona you're in. The city is generally safe, particularly during the day, and at night depending on the \"zona\" you're in. However you need to know what Zona you're in, as some zona's are places where you absolutely should not walk around at night or even be in to begin with. Zona 9, 10, 13, 14, 15 and 16 are ideal, and these are areas you can walk around at night without issue."

The Third Ward, Fifth Ward, and the Sunnyside area should be avoided during both the day and night as violent crimes including mugging, armed robbery, home invasion, carjacking, rape, assault, and murder are common in these areas. The city center is reasonably safe during the day time and early evening hours, but special caution should be exercised during the night.",

Some 40 miles north of Shenzhen, in verdant, tropical countryside, a common reaction is \"Where did this place come from?\" Until comparatively recently (the 1980's) Huizhou was a sleepy Guangdong town on the Pearl River Delta. It has since exploded with industry, attracting investment from Japanese, Korean, European and American companies. It is one of the most architecturally pleasing small cities in all of Guangdong, and one of the very richest. CIA reports citing it as the de-facto HQ for all organized crime in Hong Kong and Guangdong may go some way to explaining the many sumptuous housing developments here, as well as the plethora of Porsches, five-star hotels and other indicators of high-end living. Huizhou is where the Triad crime bosses come to dialogue and chill. Something of an anomaly within mainland China, this is a city that answers to no-one and those who live here have definite reasons for doing so.",

Migrant pickpockets tend to hang around the central bus station, but this place is so heavily policed that their efforts seem pointless. Huizhou is also a seat of regional government, so the zero tolerance for street crime policy in more intense here. In addition, it hosts large Japanese, Korean and western expatriate communities, so there is strong government incentive to keep a lid on antics by vagabonds from surrounding areas. When the powers that be in Huizhou tell you that they will stop at nothing to keep their elite city safe, they really, really, REALLY mean it. Violent attacks against foreigners are unheard of."

The scam artist then changes their tune and invites the traveller to drink tea. Often the tourist will only be told of the gem stones the next day or after dinner. Usually it is some sort of tax problem. The unwitting mark is then sold fake stones for resale in his/her home country. Even if stones are posted in front of your eyes,you are more likely to see Elvis than the gems again. As a general rule, do not accept tea from strangers, but in addition be wary of any who invite you to talk in secluded areas. The simple fact of the matter that if you are a Westerner and a person outside your hotel accosts you, there is nearly a 100% chance that this person is scheming to acquire your money. There have been reports of smugglers trying to entice travellers to assist in smuggling items. Under no circumstances accept - smuggling is a major criminal act."

Business travelers need to keep a close eye on laptops, which have been known to disappear even from within office buildings.

Gangs will usually identify their territory with graffiti markings. While most visitors to L.A. will not visit neighborhoods where gang violence is a concern, common-sense precautions apply should you become lost and end up in a bad neighborhood: remain on high-visibility roads or freeways, avoid confrontations with groups of young men, and should a confrontation arise flee immediately. DO NOT wear sports logo hats due to risk of gang confrontation. If a person who appears to be a gang member asks \"where are you from,\" prepare to immediately flee, seek cover, or defend yourself. That phrase is a common gang challenge and frequently implies imminent attack. (In a 2008 L.A.

Don't stray too far from the tourist attractions especially at night and take proper precautions when visiting such as making sure to lock your car doors and not to leave any valuables in plain sight inside your car while it\u2019s parked (car break-ins are not uncommon). If you walk, be aware of your surroundings. If you have traveling companions, it\u2019s always safer to go walking with a friend than by yourself. \n*Suburbs - Most violent crimes in Memphis happens in suburban areas far away from the downtown and Beale Street. Always do good research if you intend to stay in suburbs as safe and unsafe areas can be separated even by a few blocks. In general East Memphis is the safest with North and South Memphis suffering from the worst crime.",

A few of them can become quite persistent but most will not bother you if you ignore them. During the day you need to stay vigilant and be careful of your belongings and luggage. If you arrive after nightfall minimize walking around as much as possible and take a cab to reach your hotel; if you walk with your luggage during the night in the area it's like putting a sign on your head saying \"TOURIST\".

Always secure your bags with both straps on your shoulders, carry as much cash as needed for your day, and if possible don't have your mobile phones in your pocket. Don't flash around expensive jewelry, cameras, necklaces, or other expensive items. Be alert at all times in buses, trams, and the metro, and don't leave your personal belongings unattended in a cafeteria or a restaurant table. If you have a car: make sure that you don't leave anything valuable inside that can be seen from outside and park in secure parking and not on the street whenever possible. You might have heard about thieves on board Vespas or other kinds of motorcycles running around stealing bags right off people's shoulders. This is not a myth and it used to happen but such occurrences subsided a lot in recent years as the police have stepped up their presence in the city. In the unlikely event that this happens DON'T hold on to your bag; the vespa is much stronger than you and this could result in serious injuries.",

                "is 's capital and busiest city. Settlements in Praia started in the 1615 which then became capital of the country in the year 1770. The city is located in the southern end of Santiago Island and has year round good weather. The city is divided into various small unofficial districts, the most important ones being, Plateau (city center), Achada Santo Antonio, Palmarejo, Fazenda, Achada Grande, Varzea, Safende, Sucupira(bazaar area), Calbeciera, Terra Branca, Vila Nova, Achadinha, Bairro, Prainha, Monte Vermelho, Achada Mato, Achada Sao Felipe, and other smaller ones. Most part of the city are residential areas, so probably not worth visiting in itself, but worth a half-day exploration if you are passing through to another destination.\n \nThe center of the city lies on a plateau overlooking the bay to the southeast. The airport lies a few kilometers to the northeast.\n \nGet in\n \nPraia has an international airport. TACV (national flag carrier) and TAP airlines fly to various destinations in Europe, Africa, South America and United States. Taxis from the airport to Plateau cost 800/1000. You can pay in Euros (10\u20ac to Praia in June 2016). There is one bus line that serves the airport but it\u2019s better to just take a taxi since there is actually only one or two buses that serves this line. You can also enter the city through the port. There are ferry boats that have irregular service to and from the islands of Maio, Boavista, Sal and Sao Nicolau, and more regular and scheduled service to and from Sao Vicente and Fogo. You can exchange money at hotel (1 \u20ac= 105 Escudos) or in the city (1 \u20ac= 110 \u20ac in June 2016).\n \nGet around\n \nThe city has countless bus stops, and taxis are everywhere waiting for customers. There are two main bus companies that serve the city, Moura Company and Sol Atlantico. Each route has their own numbers. The main lines are from Safende to Achada Santo Antonio, Vila Nova to Achada Santo Antonio, Calbeceira to Palmarejo, Pensamento to Terra Branca, Achada Grande to Achada Santo Antonio, Sao Felipe to Plateau, Ponta D'Agua to Plateau,Achada Mato to Palmarejo. Most of these lines pass by Plateau (city center), Varzea and Terra Branca, the bus fair is about 35 escudos. When it comes to taxis you should be careful with illegal taxis that sometimes roam around and might rip you off. The normal taxi fare between two furthest points of the city shouldn\u2019t be more 1500 escudos in daytime and 1800 escudos at night time, example Pensamento to Palmarejo, or Palmarejo to Achada Mato. Taxi drivers usually expect to get a tip, give around 50 escudos to 100 escudos. Just be careful and always drive with the taxis that have a taximeter, so that they don\u2019t overcharge you.\n \nThe city doesn\u2019t really have a good way to navigate because of the lack of an official map. This is because large part of the city doesn\u2019t have their names or house numbers yet. In the city center and in the more important parts of the city most streets have names and numbers. However, most people are friendly and will give you directions. Walking by foot between the different districts is not recommended, especially since most of the city's side walks are made out of loose cobblestone and is difficult to walk, also because the city is full of hills that can be tiring to walk. But if you want to have a good cardio-workout try it!\n \nSee\n \n*\n \n*\n \n*\n \nDo\n \nBuy\n \nAv. Amircal Cabral is the main street. Parallel to this, you have a pedestrian street with some shops including a Souvenir Shop. Normally close at 18 h.\n \nEat\n \n*A great place to eat local food and watch the world go by.\n \nDrink\n \nSleep\n \nBudget \n*Newly renovated bed & breakfast located in the heart of the city of Praia, known as Plateau, near the Presidential Palace.

Most crimes involve petty thievery and these are mostly focused on actual residents and not on tourists, although there have been a few cases which involved tourists. So Praia is still a very safe city, just be careful with flaunting any expensive jewelry or gadgets like iPhones and such. Cape Verde in the past few years has seen an increase of petty crimes which are done mostly by groups of young people so avoid groups of young men especially at night.\n \nPraia is also a badly illuminated city at night, so be careful in places that might not have street lights and is somewhat isolated, always travel in pairs or in groups for safety. However if anything does occur there are police stations in various parts of the city and a general hospital in the city center.\n \nThe stairs at the edge of Achada Santo Antonio towards Plateau are unsafe, also during the day, avoid that neighbourhood.\n \nAt night, take a taxi.\n \n \nCope\n \n \nEmbassies & Consulates\n \n* \n \n* \n \n* \n \n* \n \nGet out\n \n, the historic capital, is an easy half-day trip.\n \nYou can rent a car or ask for a full day tour (9 hours) for a round trip island."

                "Stay safe\nSan Salvador has had a history of violence. San Salvador was considered the most dangerous city in the world in 1992 due to the 13-year civil war that was just ending. Since then, San Salvador has seen a significant reduction in crime rates; however, until recently, it experienced some of the highest homicide rates in the world, next to Honduras and Guatemala. All three countries have been battling high amounts of gang activity although, in El Salvador, it was rarely directed towards foreign tourists. Within the last year, the Catholic Church has brokered a deal with gang members to reduce violence in exchange for job training programs, special amenities for leaders in prison and other requests made by the leaders of the MS 13 and 18th Street gangs. Since the beginning of this gang \"truce\" homicide rates have dropped by more than half. This was not the case; in 2015, the gang truce had failed, and murder rates have since spiked at dangerously high levels.",

Often, wealthy Salvadorans will not go anywhere not surrounded by a high wall, barbed wire and an armed security guard. Foreign tourists are afforded a little more safety as the gang members do not know their private history, family name and how much money they have, and therefore should be relatively safe when using common sense while walking around the city and talking to people."

However at night, it's better to exercise a bit more caution here, especially in dimly-lit and deserted areas as there is a problem involving drug trafficking and drug addicts. This issue also, sometimes, extends to include the dark, secluded areas of the University Campus located just east of Rotunda. \n*Plateia Dikastirion and the Roman Agora - Dikastirion Square (Plateia) and the archaelogical site of the Roman Agora (Forum) are located at the northern ending of the Aristotelous Avenue. While in the day it's perfectly safe, at night the square is dimly-lit making it a good spot for drug-related or other crimes. Many women have also reported feeling unsafe around the square and the Roman Agora at night. \n*Dendropotamos, Sfageia, Vardaris and Giannitson Street - These areas adjacent to each other cover a sizeable part of the city (which includes the main bus and train station) west from the center and south from the areas of Ampelokipi, Menemeni and Evosmos. While during the day they are mostly safe, they are full of abandonded shops, buildings and especially factories, while Giannitson Street is also a hotspot for drug trafficking and prostitution. It's better to steer clear of the area at night as it becomes deserted and it's full of dimly lit streets. While you will probably be safe, exercise caution after dark in the section of Egnatia Avenue that passes through these areas and don't enter abandoned factories or the old train station.",

Don't put your wallet, your phone or cash in your back pocket and try to use electronic devices inside the buses as little as you can. Buses are completely safe at night with violent incidents being almost unheard of. While it's very rare taxi frauds may happen so always make sure the meter is on. While staying in the city also keep in mind that it's better not to leave valuables in your car that can be seen from the outside as there is a chance that they might be stolen. Sexual harassment against women is pretty rare in the city and visitors with a different skin colour, ethnic, religion or sexual orientation can feel perfectly safe; Thessaloniki is multi-cultural and tolerant place. It is better to avoid wearing Greek football club shirts (especially shirts of clubs based in Athens) altogether, as local football hooligans are not known to be tolerating in these instances. Also, local football club gear (Aris, PAOK, Iraklis) is not recommended, as wearing such gear in the wrong neighbourhood can attract unwanted attention.",

However, locals are far more likely to experience this than tourists, as the latter is considered more aggressive and more likely to stick up for themselves, especially if they are Westerners.

There is even a guy who pretends to be a French tourist, wears a backpack and takes photos who acts as a supporting actor for some of them. Most are middle-aged, well-dressed, well-spoken, and may actually have accurate information.

The medina includes the youth hostel and several other budget accomdations, and the high end Dar El Jed.

In general, and as extreme as this sounds, anyone in any area where tourists frequent who approaches you uninvited is almost certain to be a confidence trickster. Tunisian people are far too polite to casually strike up a conversation with a stranger on the street. Those who do are just after your money."

There have been a very few racist assaults in Vienna (even some by the police themselves). One runs the risk of being pickpocketed.

Gusto is particularly know for the drink bar (included with most set menu items), which includes milk, a wide variety of juices (remember Aomori is famous for their apples!) as well as the coffee machine, which dispenses cappuccino, American style coffee as well as espresso. The bar is self-serve, and makes for an easy morning. The drink bar by itself is roughly &yen;350, so buying breakfast is worth it for the drink service alone."

                "While most Athenian neighboorhoods are perfectly safe and the city has a low crime rate compared to other European capitals, there are some areas of Athens that are sketchy and single-handedly raise considerably the city's total crime rate. Visitors accustomed to living in large urban centres will probably not encounter anything outside of their confort zone. However the reason why this is emphasized, is because Greece is generally extremely safe and this will likely make you gradually less alert. Also, in contrast to other European cities, most degraded and sketchy areas in Athens are part of the city center and close to the touristy districts of Syntagma, Monastiraki, Plaka and Kerameikos, so it is quite easy to end up in them if you start wandering around. Here's a rundown of the neighboorhoods:\n*Omonoia - Omonoia Square and the areas around it are notorious around Greece. They used to be beautiful but since the late 1990s it has been degraded to a shell of its former self. During the day it's bustling with locals and tourists commuting to and from the city center (the area is a major transportation hub being served by two metro lines and countless bus and trolley routes). At night however it's better to stay on the main avenues and avoid going into dark, empty streets. Drug-dealing, prostitution, muggings and fights between gangs (mainly immigrants from Africa or Asia) do happen during the late hours of the night (drug dealers may be active even in broad daylight) outside of the main roads where police presence is lacking. The same goes for the neighborhoods to the immediate north like Plateia Vathis, the National Archaelogical Museum and Victoria with its adjacent areas (mentioned below) While you will find some hotels at very lucrative prices here, it would better to pay a little bit more for somewhere else.\n*Victoria, Larissa Station, Agios Panteleimonas and Attiki - The adjacent neighborhoods of Victoria, Larissa Station, Agios Panteleimonas (Saint Panteleimon) and Attiki are in the direct north of Omonoia. They also host a very large number of immigrants from Asia and Africa and have a high crime rate, as well as drug addicts. These neighborhoods however form a very compact and densely populated region that makes policing very difficult, and are generally not visited by tourists, thus it would be a good idea to avoid them after dark.\n*Exarcheia - The Exarcheia area is located north-east of Omonoia Square. It's a bohemic area that has suffered major degradation in recent decades and is home to anarchist and leftist groups. Many Greeks and especially those belonging to upper classes may present this neighborhood to be significantly more dangerous than it really is. In reality visiting Exarchia is generally safe and the area has many cool restaurants and bars, but pay some extra care at night. Anarchists are notorious troublemakers but you shouldn't worry as they rarely target civilians (and especially tourists). Avoiding the Exarchia police is a good idea; they are often hostile and inclined to treat people as suspects. Be especially careful during protests, when you might be beaten up and arrested without any provocation at all. Muggings are not common, but they occasionaly happen at Strefi Hill and behind the National Archaeological Museum. In general be a little bit more vigilant towards the south and west of the neighborhood, as you get closer to Omonoia and 28th of October St. (mostly referred as Patision St) There are drug dealers at Exarchia Square which may approach you to sell, just ignore them.\n*Monastiraki and Psirri - This may come as a surprise as these areas are the tourist epicenter of Athens but the reason they are ranked on this list is because one should be really careful of his/her belongings as pickpockets and petty thiefs ran rampant here. While violent crime is rare and the area remains busy till late at night, try to avoid deserted alleyways at after-hours.\n*Metaxourgeio is a degraded area, but mostly safe and increasingly popular. The area has many cheap brothels targeted for the common people and there are drug dealers and addicts present. Be aware of petty crime and exercise some extra caution at night, but otherwise you should be perfectly safe.\n*Filopappou Hill - Filopappou Hill offers amazing views of the city but it's better to visit the hill and the surrounding area during the day as there have been reports of armed robberies on the hill at night. If you want a beautiful panoramic view of Athens at night go to the much busier and safer Lykavitos Hill.\n*Northwestern Greater Athens - The Northwestern suburbs of Athens (Acharnes/Menidi, Liosia, Kamatero, Metamorfosi, Fyli, Aspropyrgos) are less densely populated and host many of the capital's company buildings, industrial yards and complexes. Their population is of lower income and some secluded areas are especially degraded with large Roma (Gypsy) population, where there have been occurances of attacks against passing car/truck drivers and muggings. While these areas are very far away from the city center and with zero points of interest, you may need to pass through Menidi to visit Mount Parnitha, a popular hiking destination. The road to Parnitha is safe and you will not encounter any trouble. However you are advised not to stray out of the route to the Mountain, especially during the night, and avoid unwanted attention.",

In addition, many alleys of the Gothic Quarter can become rather dark and desolate; don't enter these alleys just like you would do in any other part of the world. \n*El Raval - This is the most notorious area in Barcelona when it comes to crime. The local goverment has taken huge steps to lower its crime rate and the area is nowhere near what it used to be some decades ago. However, the neighboorhood is still more dangerous than most others in Barcelona and the overall environment along with the dilapidated buildings can be a small shock for tourists for an area a few meters away from La Rambla.

Niagara Falls is also home of Marineland an amusement park popular with Buffalonians and Canadians alike that features exhibits of sea animals such as dolphins and killer whales, about a dozen rides, and a campground.\n* is located north of Niagara Falls, Ontario at the mouth of the Niagara River, an hour's drive from Buffalo. Niagara-on-the-Lake is rich with history: at the end of the 18th century it served briefly as the capital of Ontario, and it was of strategic military importance during the War of 1812. Today, visitors to Niagara Falls often make side trips to Niagara-on-the-Lake to take in the picture-perfect streets of the town center, whose stone buildings give off the ambience of a prim British village. Wine lovers will note that the town is located in the heart of the Niagara Peninsula wine country, and history buffs can tour restored military sites such as Fort George. Niagara-on-the-Lake is also notable as the home of the long-running Shaw Festival each year from April until November, performances of selected plays of George Bernard Shaw or his contemporaries are held in three historic theatres in the town.\n*The extends between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, immediately west of Buffalo. Aside from the region's fertile farmland and historical importance as a battleground during the War of 1812, the Niagara Peninsula is greatly popular with tourists as Canada's most productive wine-producing region. There are dozens of European-style wineries straddling both sides of the Niagara Escarpment that are open to visitors in season. The unique microclimate of the Niagara Peninsula is particularly suited to producing ice wine, an extremely sweet variety popular as a dessert wine.\n* is located about two hours from Buffalo (assuming no significant delays at Customs). With over five and a half million people living in the Greater Toronto Area, Canada's largest city is an exciting and dynamic metropolis that offers all the big-city excitement one could want.",

Venezuelans in general are friendly and helpful, though they will openly avoid helping those who are victims of crime so asking for help, even in crucial situations, will drive them away. The most common recommendation is not to take the smartphone in open places. Kidnapping is a major problem for middle and upper-class Venezuelans, travelers included if they're that unlucky. As with many other developing nations, petty theft is a problem. Ask hotel management to store your valuables when you leave your room and use a money belt for your passport/extra cash when traveling.

The presence of settlers transiting westward and the growing presence of the US military made the region around present-day Casper a focal point in the late 19th century war against Native American tribes in the region, many of whom had suffered prior dislocation from the north and east as the US pushed the frontier westward. This conflict resulted in a military battle in which Lt. Caspar Collins perished. As \"Collins\" had already been used in the designation of Ft. Collins to the south, the settlement on the North Platte became known as \"Casper\" (changed from \"Caspar\" thanks to a clerical error). In later years, the arrival of the railroad and the discovery of oil in nearby fields consolidated Casper's relative importance in the region. Today, the city is a commercial hub for the surrounding region, whose economy is closely tied to energy and mineral extraction business. Casper is the second largest city in , after . The city has a few attractions to entertain visitors for a day or so, but the real attraction lies in the surrounding areas, which include some of the state's most interesting historical and natural sites.

The city sits along Lake Michigan, one of the five Great Lakes, which has and outlet to the Atlantic Ocean via the St. Lawrence Seaway, thus making Chicago a global port city. Chicago sits along the freshwater Great Lakes so it doesn't experience the droughts and water shortages that many other cities experience. There are no laws in Chicago restricting water usage upon its citizens as those laws are not needed due to the abundant supply of fresh water. In fact, the city has so much fresh water bestowed on it, that it sells water to other nearby cities and towns. Chicago has many great attractions in its huge central/downtown area, and lots of Chicagoans live and play outside of the central area as well. Travelers also go to the city's vibrant neighborhoods to soak up the local nightlife, sample the wide range of fantastic dining, and see other sights that are a part of Chicago. Thanks to the city's massive public transit system, which includes over 140 Chicago Transit Authority elevated and subway stations, a separate city and suburban rail network called Metra, and bus routes criss-crossing the city every few blocks apart, all parts of Chicago are indeed accessible. Portions of the city's elevated/subway network operate nonstop, 24 hours around the clock each day, making Chicago, New York City, and Copenhagen the only cities in the world to offer any 24 hour rail service where trains run nonstop throughout the entirety of their respective city limits.",

Lastly, the sidewalks may have pits or missing utility covers, along with low-hanging clothes lines draped in front of businesses or homes, so be on the lookout at night when it can be harder to see these hangups.

Passers-by pay little attention and don't attempt to stop the running thief even if you shout loudly.\nAlso exercise caution on buses: pickpockets can be active on crowded ones and, as everywhere else, they preferably target tourists.\nOccasionally, some types of beggars can be insistent and distracting while at the same time another thief quietly steals your wallet or phone. Again, this is nothing new to major tourist spots.\nAs of 2019 there is a \"picture on the ground\" scam, where scammers put printed pictures on the ground, and demand money from tourists who happen to walk over them by accident."

                "Areas to be careful\nAs with any other city there are some areas in Fortaleza where the crime rate is much higher than in other districts. Some areas to watch out are:\n*Cais do Porto and Serviluz slum - Fortaleza's Port Area borders a notorious slum called Serviluz which sits on the northern side of Praia do Futuro. DON'T bathe in the northern side of the beach (there is minimal infarstructure for such activities anyway) and DON'T enter the slum, or slums in general, for any reason. \n*Commuting between Praia do Futuro and Centro - Be careful when commuting between Praia do Futuro and the city center. If you're going by foot always go through the busy Avenida Santos Dumont and avoid areas like Papicu, Varjota and especially Vicente Pinzon which has a particularly high crime rate. After nightfall always take a cab or Uber. \n*Beaches - NEVER enter beaches after dark. They aren't necessairly dangerous but they are less safe than other areas due to being dark and desolate. There is a very high chance that you won't see a soul in the beach. \n*Suburbs - Like almost everywhere else in Brazil, the city suburbs host the highest amount of homicides, armed robberies, muggings etc. It's better to stay in the city center and avoid going anywhere south or east and take care when going west as mentioned earlier.",
                "Stay safe\nFortaleza is generally considered a not-so-safe city for tourists and has one of the highest crime rates in Brazil. The city occupies the number 7 spot on the list of cities with the most homicides per 100,000 people in the world (2017), the second worst for a brazilian city after , and also has the second highest number of homicides in the world after (2017). This type of violence though doesn't usually involve tourists and most have no problems visiting Fortaleza after taking some basic precautions. Some things to watch out are:\n*Pickpockets - Pickpockets and petty thiefs are a major problem in Fortaleza just like any other city in the world. They roam the city center and the beaches looking for easy victimes in the face of tourists. Avoid carrying too much cash with you, use credit cards for most of your transactions if possible, and if you do put them all in different places. It would be useful to have a second purse with you in such cases. Always have a copy of your ID, passport or other important documents and keep your phone usage in public to the BARE MINIMUM. Don't display any jewelerry (thiefs have been known to snatch necklaces and earings right of people's ears and necks) and don't show your camera too much. NEVER leave anything unattended in restaurants or cafes and ESPECIALLY beaches. Be very cautious during the Carnival too. Take only what you need to with you and take special care of your belongings in street parties and late night bashes. \n*Public Transport - Public Transport is generally safe in Fortaleza. Be very careful of your belongings during the day in buses and avoid taking them during the night as incidents inside buses have been reported. One thing tourists should worry about are taxis. Always take official, licensed cabs. Do not get in any unmarked taxis, especially if someone has solicited a ride for you. Check with your hotel to identify the official registered taxi companies in the city and stick only with them to avoid any hidden charges or unpleasant rides. Uber and Lyft are also popular in Fortaleza. \n*Prostitution - Fortaleza is a well-known city for tourist prostitution. Men in particular are often the victim of drugging and robbing crimes by prostitutes, often using a sleeping pill to knock the guys out (unless they\u2019ve passed out as a result of their own alcohol and drug consumption). Many hotels and residence buildings have a registry of late night arrivals, or at least security cameras that can catch a glimpse of the perpetrator. Get these details and then go to the police. Move fast, though, because the stolen cash and items will disappear fast.",
                "Traveling by car, even for short distances especially at night, is probably the most effective way to avoid crime. Taking Uber is a very cost effective way of doing that."

Petty crimes, and in rare instances even muggings, do occur in these areas and prostitutes can be seen waiting for their clients even at noon (Genoa is known for being pretty tolerant towards prostitution). Via Garibaldi is completely safe during the day (after nightfall it can become deserted) but the areas immediately south of it are not and if you want reach Piazza di Ferrari or the Cathedral it's best to go around through Via XXV Aprille. Just follow your common sense and stay on the main roads where most other people are. NEVER enter dark, narrow alleys unless you really know what you're doing. Pay special attention to your surroundings and avoid displaying flashy items or carrying large amounts of cash or valuables. If you want to stay in the old town pick hotels south of the Cathedral, around Piazza di Ferrari or close to the busy Via di Porta Sorprana."

                "The Zones\nGuatemala City is divided into different Zones. It's essential to know which zones are safe, less safe or a complete no-go for tourists. Here's a rundown of the zones:\n*Zona 1 - Zona 1 is essentially the downtown of Guatemala City. This where you will most likely start your tour of the city as here are most of the tourist attractions. During the day you'll find many visitors seeing the sights and locals shopping, eating or working. It's ok to wander the zone during the day but stay in populated areas and don't enter side streets. At night avoid the zone COMPLETELY. Once shops close the area becomes deserted and dark. There are many cheap hotels and hostels here but it's better to stay in another a bit pricier but safer part of town. \n*Zona 10, 13, 14, 15 and 16 - Zones 10, 13, 14, 15 and 16 are essentially the \"safe\" areas of Guatemala where the upper middle class and wealthy citizens live. These areas are full of gated communities like Colonia Oakland, Colonia La Canada (where many foreign embassies are located) and others. Here are also the cities more reputable hotels aimed directly at tourists. \n*Zona 2, 4, and 17 - Zones 2, 4, 9 and 17 are the \"middle\" zones when it comes to crime. They are generally considered nice for tourists to stay but you should be more vigilant here at nighttime than in the safer aforementioned zones. You should always do more research when booking a hotel in Zona 2 and Zona 17 as some parts are much more dangerous than others. \n*Zona 3, 5..8, 11, 12, 17...21 - All the Zones from 5 to 8 and 17 to 21 along with Zona 3 and Zones 11-12 are very dangerous. Tourists SHOULD NOT go there at any time of day. These are the parts of the city where 80% of the violent crime happens as armed robberies and muggings are common even at noon. You should know too that some of these Zones (like the notorious Zona 3) are controlled by gangs who won't hesitate to shoot at you if you enter the area, even accidentally.",
                "So there are some things to watch out for:\n*At night - There is a general rule of the thumb in Guatemala City (depending on the 'zona'): DON'T walk around at night. In most other Latin American cities you would be fine if going out at as a group and stay in nice areas but in Guatemala City most streets are empty at night. Unless you're in Zona 9, 10, 13, 14, 15 or 16, don't walk around at night. If you want to go somewhere else hop on a taxi or an Uber and make sure it leaves you in front of your destination. \n*Pickpockets - Pickpockets and thiefs are present in Guatemala City as in any other city in the world. Be careful in crowded streets of the city center and packed buses during the day. Always watch your belongings, don't carry more cash than you need for the day and don't put them all in one place. DON'T wear flashy jewelerry like necklaces, braclets, watches and especially earings that if snatched can injure their owner. In addition, don't show around your camera too much and, as hard as this might be, keep your phone usage to the BARE MINIMUM. \n*Public Transport - Public Transport in Guatemala City is quite limited and unfortunately a bit inefficient. Buses are the main way to get around followed by taxis and Ubers. You can use buses with a high degree of safety during the day (always watch out for pickpockets) but DON'T use buses at night. Incidents occur inside buses that range from sexual harassment to armed robberies every night. Taxis are okay to use but never hail a cab on the street or enter white taxis; most of them are not regulated and you have a very high chance of being robbed. Use official taxi apps from reputable companies to call a taxi. Uber is another safe and cheap method to get around\n*Driving - Driving in Guatemala City can be kind of hectic especially during rush hour when the roads are packed. Due to the fact that public transport ranges from inefficient to tragic, most residents move around by car and this can result in huge traffic jams at some times during the day. Be on watch for aggressive drivers. At night it's better to stay on the main avenues and always drive with your windows closed. Car-jackings are not uncommon in isolated streets and even in the avenues after midnight. If a person or a group comes suspiciously close to your car when you're stopped in a red light GO. It's very unlikely that you'll get in trouble and even the police do it sometimes. \n*Police - The police in Guatemala unfortunately is not very effective due to being under-funded by the goverment and some police officers have problems with corruption. Be alert if you're stopped but also be polite; not everyone is corrupt and some policemen/-women are nice and helpful.\n*Political Demonstrations - Public Demonstration against the goverment do happen sometimes in Guatemala City. They don't usually turn violent but it's better to just stay out of them and continue your way.",

The city is generally safe, particularly during the day, and at night depending on the \"zona\" you're in. However you need to know what Zona you're in, as some zona's are places where you absolutely should not walk around at night or even be in to begin with. Zona 9, 10, 13, 14, 15 and 16 are ideal, and these are areas you can walk around at night without issue."

Be wary of hustlers (jinteros/as) offering to show you a place to eat or offering a tour of the city, as you'll be stuck paying hefty prices to cover their commission. Just walk away and continue walking -- soon enough they will leave you alone. In local restaurants, ask for menus or prices before ordering anything; there can be special 'tourist price menus' that get pulled out after you have consumed food or drink. If you're male, expect to be accosted regularly by prostitutes and/or their pimps, especially in Habana Vieja.

It is one of the most architecturally pleasing small cities in all of Guangdong, and one of the very richest.

                "Stay safe\nBeyond the standard dangers of travelling in India (thieves, hustlers, touts, questionable drinking water), Jaipur has developed its own set of unique scams.\n \nYou may be accosted by youths on motorbikes who claim that Westerners are unwilling to engage with the Indian people.\n\"Why don't tourists want to talk to me\",or \"I am a student, I want to learn about your culture\" is the normal opener. The scam artist then changes their tune and invites the traveller to drink tea. Often the tourist will only be told of the gem stones the next day or after dinner. Usually it is some sort of tax problem. The unwitting mark is then sold fake stones for resale in his/her home country. Even if stones are posted in front of your eyes,you are more likely to see Elvis than the gems again. As a general rule, do not accept tea from strangers, but in addition be wary of any who invite you to talk in secluded areas. The simple fact of the matter that if you are a Westerner and a person outside your hotel accosts you, there is nearly a 100% chance that this person is scheming to acquire your money. There have been reports of smugglers trying to entice travellers to assist in smuggling items. Under no circumstances accept - smuggling is a major criminal act.",
                "Due to the rise in complaints from travelers about being accosted by touts & con artists. The government has taken steps to ensure a hassle free experience for visitors, this includes partnering with AudioCompass, a smartphone app that serves as personal audio guide for travelers, consisting of audio guides for all attractions in Jaipur & other places of interest around the city. This eliminates the need to associate with pushy touts who visitors find to be untrustworthy due to the number of stories they hear about cheating, misbehaving, etc. This app is a tool to help visitors explore places in India independently but travelers should always exercise caution when talking to strangers or visiting unknown places."

Business travelers need to keep a close eye on laptops, which have been known to disappear even from within office buildings. For all-night party excursions, it may be wise to keep your cab waiting; the extra cost is cheap and it's worth it for the security. Lock your car doors and windows, and show no cell phones or wallets on the dashboard. Often simply catching the thief in the act will cause him to run away. Because the police are seen as useless or corrupt, Jakartans will usually come to the aid of a victim. Just ask for help (\"Tolong!\"). In many neighborhoods, a thief caught by the local residents will be punished \"traditionally\" (often quite brutally) before being taken to police.

Unlike , Kaohsiung is a planned city with wide streets and less traffic congestion than the capital. In recent years, the city has made great strides in transforming itself from a primarily industrial city into a modern Asian metropolis, and several areas of the city, such as along the banks of the Love River (Ai He, \u611b\u6cb3), have benefited from major beautification projects under the tenure of former mayor Wu Den-yih. The city is often known as Taiwan's \"Harbour Capital\" (\u6e2f\u90fd) because of its close connection and heavy reliance on the ocean and maritime transportation. It is also one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in Taiwan, with numerous designated bike paths running through the city's many parks.",

Those are Galt Gardens in the downtown, Stafford Drive between 1st and 2nd Ave North (near the homeless shelter) and between 1st and 5th Avenue North on 13th St."

Some places in the Centro Hist\u00f3rico and Golden Zone are well lit and occasionally busy at night. Don't let this deceive you into believing it is safe to walk around after dark. Don't be afraid to walk around the Cathedral, Malecon or Plaza Machado during the day. In most areas of the city there's almost no activity at night, and it would be unsafe to be anywhere after dark. Incidents of chain-snatching and robbery at knife point have been reported as occurring directly in front of Valentinos Disco in the Golden Zone even when it is very busy and several hundred people are standing outside. Avoid having any jewelry whatsoever, or wearing nice clothes so you are not targeted by the thugs in this large city.",

Riding a bike anywhere in the city is far safer for the moderately experienced cyclists than most towns or cities in other countries. The French are very cognisant of cyclists, almost to a point of reverence. A few years ago Paris wasn't the easiest place to get around by bike but that has changed dramatically in recent years. The city government has taken a number of steps in strong support of improving the safety and efficiency of the urban cyclist as well as establishing some separated bike lanes but, even more importantly, instituted a policy of allowing cyclists to share the ample bus lanes on most major boulevards. Paris also has many riversides which are perfect for cycling. The Paris bike network now counts over 150km of either unique or shared lanes for the cyclist. In addition, the narrower, medieval side streets of the central arrondissements make for rather scenic and leisurely cycling, especially during off-peak hours of the day when traffic is lighter.

                "is 's capital and busiest city. Settlements in Praia started in the 1615 which then became capital of the country in the year 1770. The city is located in the southern end of Santiago Island and has year round good weather. The city is divided into various small unofficial districts, the most important ones being, Plateau (city center), Achada Santo Antonio, Palmarejo, Fazenda, Achada Grande, Varzea, Safende, Sucupira(bazaar area), Calbeciera, Terra Branca, Vila Nova, Achadinha, Bairro, Prainha, Monte Vermelho, Achada Mato, Achada Sao Felipe, and other smaller ones. Most part of the city are residential areas, so probably not worth visiting in itself, but worth a half-day exploration if you are passing through to another destination.\n \nThe center of the city lies on a plateau overlooking the bay to the southeast. The airport lies a few kilometers to the northeast.\n \nGet in\n \nPraia has an international airport. TACV (national flag carrier) and TAP airlines fly to various destinations in Europe, Africa, South America and United States. Taxis from the airport to Plateau cost 800/1000. You can pay in Euros (10\u20ac to Praia in June 2016). There is one bus line that serves the airport but it\u2019s better to just take a taxi since there is actually only one or two buses that serves this line. You can also enter the city through the port. There are ferry boats that have irregular service to and from the islands of Maio, Boavista, Sal and Sao Nicolau, and more regular and scheduled service to and from Sao Vicente and Fogo. You can exchange money at hotel (1 \u20ac= 105 Escudos) or in the city (1 \u20ac= 110 \u20ac in June 2016).\n \nGet around\n \nThe city has countless bus stops, and taxis are everywhere waiting for customers. There are two main bus companies that serve the city, Moura Company and Sol Atlantico. Each route has their own numbers. The main lines are from Safende to Achada Santo Antonio, Vila Nova to Achada Santo Antonio, Calbeceira to Palmarejo, Pensamento to Terra Branca, Achada Grande to Achada Santo Antonio, Sao Felipe to Plateau, Ponta D'Agua to Plateau,Achada Mato to Palmarejo. Most of these lines pass by Plateau (city center), Varzea and Terra Branca, the bus fair is about 35 escudos. When it comes to taxis you should be careful with illegal taxis that sometimes roam around and might rip you off. The normal taxi fare between two furthest points of the city shouldn\u2019t be more 1500 escudos in daytime and 1800 escudos at night time, example Pensamento to Palmarejo, or Palmarejo to Achada Mato. Taxi drivers usually expect to get a tip, give around 50 escudos to 100 escudos. Just be careful and always drive with the taxis that have a taximeter, so that they don\u2019t overcharge you.\n \nThe city doesn\u2019t really have a good way to navigate because of the lack of an official map. This is because large part of the city doesn\u2019t have their names or house numbers yet. In the city center and in the more important parts of the city most streets have names and numbers. However, most people are friendly and will give you directions. Walking by foot between the different districts is not recommended, especially since most of the city's side walks are made out of loose cobblestone and is difficult to walk, also because the city is full of hills that can be tiring to walk. But if you want to have a good cardio-workout try it!\n \nSee\n \n*\n \n*\n \n*\n \nDo\n \nBuy\n \nAv. Amircal Cabral is the main street. Parallel to this, you have a pedestrian street with some shops including a Souvenir Shop. Normally close at 18 h.\n \nEat\n \n*A great place to eat local food and watch the world go by.\n \nDrink\n \nSleep\n \nBudget \n*Newly renovated bed & breakfast located in the heart of the city of Praia, known as Plateau, near the Presidential Palace.

Most crimes involve petty thievery and these are mostly focused on actual residents and not on tourists, although there have been a few cases which involved tourists. So Praia is still a very safe city, just be careful with flaunting any expensive jewelry or gadgets like iPhones and such. Cape Verde in the past few years has seen an increase of petty crimes which are done mostly by groups of young people so avoid groups of young men especially at night.\n \nPraia is also a badly illuminated city at night, so be careful in places that might not have street lights and is somewhat isolated, always travel in pairs or in groups for safety. However if anything does occur there are police stations in various parts of the city and a general hospital in the city center.\n \nThe stairs at the edge of Achada Santo Antonio towards Plateau are unsafe, also during the day, avoid that neighbourhood.\n \nAt night, take a taxi.\n \n \nCope\n \n \nEmbassies & Consulates\n \n* \n \n* \n \n* \n \n* \n \nGet out\n \n, the historic capital, is an easy half-day trip.\n \nYou can rent a car or ask for a full day tour (9 hours) for a round trip island."
