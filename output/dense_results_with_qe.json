Most buildings are constructed out of granite quarried in and around the city, and as a result, Aberdeen is often referred to as The Granite City. It is also known for its many outstanding parks, gardens and floral displays throughout the city, as well as its long, sandy beach. Aberdeen also boasts the title of Oil Capital of Europe and has been voted in several polls as the happiest place in Britain, with a 2006 poll citing access to large areas of greenery and community spirit.

By UK and even Scottish standards it is remote and often the subject of \"far away\" jokes (the nearest city is much smaller 70 miles south). Despite this, Aberdeen is surprisingly easy to reach and is a modern and prosperous city. British visitors are often surprised to find a such a vibrant city so far north. Partly due to oil wealth and its status as the only large regional centre, it has the facilities of a much larger city. Together, all this gives Aberdeen an air of self-sufficiency found in few places in Britain today.", "During the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries, growing prosperity led to grand civil engineering projects, including Union Street (much of which is actually bridge) and the construction of many large and ornate buildings. Grand architecture is one of the city's distinctive features, particularly Neoclassical, Gothic Revival and Scottish Baronial styles. The mediaeval buildings had been made of wood, and following several disastrous fires, the city's leaders resolved to rebuild only in stone. The local stone they had, quarried in the city and throughout Aberdeenshire, was granite. Nearly all pre-1960s buildings are made of this and sparkle in the sun, giving the city's other name, \"The Granite City\".", "Numerous crime novels by Scottish author Stuart MacBride are set in Aberdeen. His best-selling thrillers featuring Detective Sergeant Logan McRae portray a fictional darker side of the city and its environs, but make frequent reference to real-life city locations. These include Cold Granite (2005), Dying Light (2006), Blind Eye (2009) Shatter the Bones (2011), Close to the Bone (2013) and The Missing and the Dead (2015). These novels often feature prominently in bookstore displays in the city. Iain Banks' 2012 novel Stonemouth (adapted by the BBC into a 2015 drama serial) follows a man returning to a small seaport town north of Aberdeen after leaving due to a sexual scandal. Its name is adapted from Stonehaven, a small town a few miles south of Aberdeen.", "Destinations", "* Granite Architecture. Aberdeen's granite buildings form one of the most celebrated cityscapes in Britain, with beautiful and architecturally significant buildings literally everywhere, especially in the city centre. However, some (particularly on Union Street and streets nearby) are now in need of restoration, much as the was before its restoration in the late 20th century. As such, currently many of the great granite buildings of the city centre have a sense of faded grandeur, though some (such as Marischal College - see below) have been dramatically restored. The Wikipedia article on Architecture in Aberdeen gives a good introduction but here are a few to get you started as you walk around the city centre. The newly restored Marischal College on Broad Street, displays what poet John Betjeman called \"tower on tower, forests of pinnacles, a group of palatial buildings rivalled only by the Houses of Parliament at Westminster\". Then try the Town House (i.e. city hall) on Union Street, with its confident Victorian tower and street frontage. The Salvation Army Citadel on the Castlegate is an excellent example of the Scottish Baronial style, with its fairy-tale turrets, while a walk up (and down) Union Street with its mile of impressive granite buildings is a must. As you walk along Union Street, look up; the architecture is often not visible from street-level. Unlike other grand streets in the UK (such as Grey Street in or the Royal Crescent in ), but like Princes Street in , each building on Union Street is different to the next in stature and architectural style. You will see a wide range of architectural styles, from highly ornamented to robust and Scottish-looking. Then, on Rosemount Viaduct, the cluster of His Majesty's Theatre, St. Mark's Church and the Central Library form a widely-praised trio. City bookstores and the Central Library carry books about Aberdeen's architecture, such as Aberdeen: An Illustrated Architectural Guide by W. A. Brogden (2012, 4th ed.) and The Granite Mile by Diane Morgan (2008) on the architecture of Union Street.", "Some of the many high-street stores that may be useful when travelling include the following, but there are many more:", "If you want a lunchtime soup or sandwich try these city centre cafes.

Aberdeen has at least two of these golden postboxes in honour of local gold-medal-winning Olympians - one on the Castlegate commemorates rower Katherine Grainger while another on Golden Square is in honour of Paralympic cyclist Neil Fachie.

With the decision to move the national capital from Nafplio to Athens, architects and city planners were hired to build a new city next to the classical ruins, with grand neoclassical homes and public buildings, large city squares, green spaces, and wide avenues, making a conscious, decisive turn from the city's Ottoman past.

The Greek Parliament building, National Garden and National Historical Museum are also in the area.", "There are some internet cafes around the city center and in the greater Athens area as well.", "While most Athenian neighboorhoods are perfectly safe and the city has a low crime rate compared to other European capitals, there are some areas of Athens that are sketchy and single-handedly raise considerably the city's total crime rate. Visitors accustomed to living in large urban centres will probably not encounter anything outside of their confort zone. However the reason why this is emphasized, is because Greece is generally extremely safe and this will likely make you gradually less alert. Also, in contrast to other European cities, most degraded and sketchy areas in Athens are part of the city center and close to the touristy districts of Syntagma, Monastiraki, Plaka and Kerameikos, so it is quite easy to end up in them if you start wandering around. Here's a rundown of the neighboorhoods:\n*Omonoia - Omonoia Square and the areas around it are notorious around Greece. They used to be beautiful but since the late 1990s it has been degraded to a shell of its former self. During the day it's bustling with locals and tourists commuting to and from the city center (the area is a major transportation hub being served by two metro lines and countless bus and trolley routes). At night however it's better to stay on the main avenues and avoid going into dark, empty streets. Drug-dealing, prostitution, muggings and fights between gangs (mainly immigrants from Africa or Asia) do happen during the late hours of the night (drug dealers may be active even in broad daylight) outside of the main roads where police presence is lacking. The same goes for the neighborhoods to the immediate north like Plateia Vathis, the National Archaelogical Museum and Victoria with its adjacent areas (mentioned below) While you will find some hotels at very lucrative prices here, it would better to pay a little bit more for somewhere else.\n*Victoria, Larissa Station, Agios Panteleimonas and Attiki - The adjacent neighborhoods of Victoria, Larissa Station, Agios Panteleimonas (Saint Panteleimon) and Attiki are in the direct north of Omonoia. They also host a very large number of immigrants from Asia and Africa and have a high crime rate, as well as drug addicts. These neighborhoods however form a very compact and densely populated region that makes policing very difficult, and are generally not visited by tourists, thus it would be a good idea to avoid them after dark.\n*Exarcheia - The Exarcheia area is located north-east of Omonoia Square. It's a bohemic area that has suffered major degradation in recent decades and is home to anarchist and leftist groups. Many Greeks and especially those belonging to upper classes may present this neighborhood to be significantly more dangerous than it really is. In reality visiting Exarchia is generally safe and the area has many cool restaurants and bars, but pay some extra care at night. Anarchists are notorious troublemakers but you shouldn't worry as they rarely target civilians (and especially tourists). Avoiding the Exarchia police is a good idea; they are often hostile and inclined to treat people as suspects. Be especially careful during protests, when you might be beaten up and arrested without any provocation at all. Muggings are not common, but they occasionaly happen at Strefi Hill and behind the National Archaeological Museum. In general be a little bit more vigilant towards the south and west of the neighborhood, as you get closer to Omonoia and 28th of October St. (mostly referred as Patision St) There are drug dealers at Exarchia Square which may approach you to sell, just ignore them.\n*Monastiraki and Psirri - This may come as a surprise as these areas are the tourist epicenter of Athens but the reason they are ranked on this list is because one should be really careful of his/her belongings as pickpockets and petty thiefs ran rampant here. While violent crime is rare and the area remains busy till late at night, try to avoid deserted alleyways at after-hours.\n*Metaxourgeio is a degraded area, but mostly safe and increasingly popular. The area has many cheap brothels targeted for the common people and there are drug dealers and addicts present. Be aware of petty crime and exercise some extra caution at night, but otherwise you should be perfectly safe.\n*Filopappou Hill - Filopappou Hill offers amazing views of the city but it's better to visit the hill and the surrounding area during the day as there have been reports of armed robberies on the hill at night. If you want a beautiful panoramic view of Athens at night go to the much busier and safer Lykavitos Hill.\n*Northwestern Greater Athens - The Northwestern suburbs of Athens (Acharnes/Menidi, Liosia, Kamatero, Metamorfosi, Fyli, Aspropyrgos) are less densely populated and host many of the capital's company buildings, industrial yards and complexes. Their population is of lower income and some secluded areas are especially degraded with large Roma (Gypsy) population, where there have been occurances of attacks against passing car/truck drivers and muggings. While these areas are very far away from the city center and with zero points of interest, you may need to pass through Menidi to visit Mount Parnitha, a popular hiking destination. The road to Parnitha is safe and you will not encounter any trouble. However you are advised not to stray out of the route to the Mountain, especially during the night, and avoid unwanted attention.", "* Greek islands: During the summer (June, July, August), are a must-go destination; the water is exceptionally beautiful and warm enough to swim.

It is a city which has changed dramatically in a decade due to this peace and prosperity and you will be greeted with warmth from locals who feel a new-found sense of pride in their city. Indeed, the old clich\u00e9 that you will be welcomed like an old friend by the patrons of Belfast's many pubs and bars is actually true, as the locals love to find out what draws you to their little part of the world and, of course, they like the chance to share a little bit of their history with you!

Here's a list of these neighborhoods:\n*La Boca - La Boca is a tourist hotspot with its colorful, traditional buildings, lively atmosphere, and pedestrian-friendly streets. But La Boca also hides a dangerous side: don't stray far from the touristy areas even during the day and don't go there after dark unless you really have to. It's also better to avoid La Boca when a football match is being held in the La Bombonera Arena; you will see many fanatics or drunk fans around.\n*Downtown - The downtown is a huge and bustling area of Buenos Aires during a day full of tourists and locals alike. But you should always watch your belongings closely due to pickpockets roaming the streets. At nightstick to well-lit and populated areas and don't enter dark alleys, especially around the Congress where the area is quite seedy. In addition, refrain from walking through the Congressional Plaza as at night it's home to homeless people and sometimes drug addicts. \n*Constitucion and San Telmo - Constitucion and San Telmo are two areas on the southern end and are separated by 9 de Julio Avenue. Both areas are frequented by tourists during the day, especially San Telmo with its characteristic traditional buildings and beautiful market. But at night these areas have quite a bad reputation for violent crime. It's best to refrain from lingering in the streets for too long or take a taxi if you need to commute through here. Be especially careful around the Constitucion train station.\n*South Buenos Aires - South Buenos Aires includes the areas of Barracas, Nueva Pompeya, Villa Soldati, and Villa Lugano. Parque Patricios and southern Flores. These areas are mostly home to middle or lower-middle-class neighborhoods and have the highest crime rate in the city.\n*Villas Miserias - Villas Miserias are Buenos Aires' equivalent to the Brazilian favelas. Villas Miserias literally translates to miserable areas. DON'T enter these neighborhoods. Be especially careful of Villa 31 which is right next to the northern side of the Retiro train station; when you exit the train station always go south and exercise a lot of caution around the general area at night."]}], "Buffalo": [0.23115070841353397, {"The cities should be known for Harry Potter film locations.": ["The second-largest city in , Buffalo is full of surprises.

In particular, the splendid brick Victorian cottages of what was once the Lower West Side's \"Little Italy\" were nearly all lost to the wrecking ball, while the new public housing projects erected in the Ellicott District soon became high-rise versions of the slums they replaced, as the mere construction of new buildings did nothing to address the underlying social problems in the neighborhood.

From May to October, Fort Erie Racetrack & Slots offers exciting thoroughbred horse racing including the Prince of Wales Stakes, the second jewel in the Canadian Triple Crown.

Niagara Falls, Ontario is very different from its U.S. counterpart: the views of the Falls are almost unanimously considered to be better, but rather than the comparatively quiet greenery that abuts the falls on the American side, Niagara Falls, Ontario boasts Clifton Hill, a gaudy tourist area adjacent to the falls that consists of swanky high-rise hotels, a pair of casinos, restaurants, nightclubs, and gimmicky tourist traps such as the Ripley's Believe It Or Not Museum and the Movieland Wax Museum. Though gritty urban streets such as those of Niagara Falls, New York are almost unheard of on the Canadian side, it's often said that the Las Vegas-style neon jungle that has sprouted in Niagara Falls, Ontario detracts from the majesty of the falls themselves. It's considerably quieter outside of the main tourist district, with romantic B&Bs, verdant parkland, and (further north) wineries lining the Niagara Parkway, one of the area's most scenic drives that runs along the Canadian side of the Niagara River from Fort Erie to Niagara-on-the-Lake.

Niagara-on-the-Lake is rich with history: at the end of the 18th century it served briefly as the capital of Ontario, and it was of strategic military importance during the War of 1812. Today, visitors to Niagara Falls often make side trips to Niagara-on-the-Lake to take in the picture-perfect streets of the town center, whose stone buildings give off the ambience of a prim British village. Wine lovers will note that the town is located in the heart of the Niagara Peninsula wine country, and history buffs can tour restored military sites such as Fort George. Niagara-on-the-Lake is also notable as the home of the long-running Shaw Festival each year from April until November, performances of selected plays of George Bernard Shaw or his contemporaries are held in three historic theatres in the town.\n*The extends between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, immediately west of Buffalo. Aside from the region's fertile farmland and historical importance as a battleground during the War of 1812, the Niagara Peninsula is greatly popular with tourists as Canada's most productive wine-producing region. There are dozens of European-style wineries straddling both sides of the Niagara Escarpment that are open to visitors in season. The unique microclimate of the Niagara Peninsula is particularly suited to producing ice wine, an extremely sweet variety popular as a dessert wine.\n* is located about two hours from Buffalo (assuming no significant delays at Customs).

At the heart of the neighborhood is Hyde Park Square, a tree-lined esplanade of boutique shops, such as Morrison & Me, Knickers XY, 45/46 XY Inspired, and Knickers of Hyde Park, and restaurants, including Indigo, Teller's, Cock & Bull Pub and Graeter's Ice Cream.\n*Mt. Adams is a trendy, upscale neighborhood located directly northeast of downtown Cincinnati. It is known for its lively night scene, beautiful views of the skyline, and the Holy Cross-Immaculata Catholic Church. Steep terrain on three sides, and Eden Park on the fourth side, give the neighborhood a unique sense of isolation. Mt. Adams has some of the highest property values in the city, and is a good destination for anyone overly worried about personal safety.\n*Clifton, not to be confused with a nearby Clifton Heights, is also located near the city center, and is home to an especially wide range of people, boasting a population diverse in ethnicity, race, sexuality, gender, age, country of origin, and economic status. A number of students at the local University inhabit the stately apartment buildings, as well as many of the beautiful older homes that line the gas-lit streets, though a number of families and other residents are also proud to call Clifton home. Especially notable is the stretch of Ludlow between Clifton Ave and Whitfield, as it is home to a number of restaurants specializing both in American fare (perhaps the best Skyline Chili in all of Cincinnati, as well as local diner the Proud Rooster) and ethnic delights (Ambar and Amol India, Thai Cafe, Mediterranean Foods), as well as a number of independent shops and boutiques, and the quirky art-house movie theater, The Esquire Theatre, which is over 100 years old and generally shows indie and foreign films.\n*Mt. Washington is an up and coming economically diverse neighborhood located on Cincinnati's east side. The neighborhood contains a variety of shopping options along its Water Tower business district, ranging from thrift shops to upscale women's boutiques (Magnolia Clothing Boutique originated in Mt. Washington). The neighborhood is known for its variety of homes, ranging from large estates (along Salem Avenue and Wayside Avenue) to affordable apartments. Architecturally the neighborhood is home to several notable buildings, including the Mt. St. Mary's Seminary, Mt. Washington Presbyterian Church, and Guardian Angel Church. \n*Northside is an economically and racially diverse neighborhood notable for a strong sense of community investment and pride.

Also notable is Aglamesis Ice Cream, a long-time competitor of Graeter's in the gourmet ice cream category.\n*Over-the-Rhine (OTR) is the city's historic district. It is the location of Music Hall, home of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra and Cincinnati Opera; Findlay Market, Ohio's oldest public market in continuous operation; the Main Street Entertainment District; and much of Cincinnati's creative arts. Care should be taken when visiting this neighborhood as crime is more frequent here than in other areas of the city. The safer areas of OTR are just north of Central Parkway on Vine and Main Streets in the Gateway Quarter. North of Liberty Street the area is a bit rougher around the edges. For the past thirty years the neighborhood has been a battleground between advocates for low income housing and historic preservationists/real estate developers. In the past five years a great renaissance has taken place in this area though, with the redevelopment of Washington Park, and the many great restaurants' in the Gateway Quarter, it has become one of the trendiest neighborhoods in the city.

The community\u2019s history is preserved at the Price Hill Historical Society on Warsaw Avenue, and the neighborhood was home to the first Skyline Chili parlor (which relocated in the early 2000s), the upscale Primavista Restaurant, the 120-year-old Crow\u2019s Nest Tavern and the Gothic-style St. Lawrence Church. While it does boast this vivid history and some notable establishments, Price Hill has some seedier areas that you should be cautious of if you are traveling there. St. Lawrence Church, for instance, is only open during Mass and shortly thereafter, and that is when it should be viewed. Its immediate neighborhood is considered dangerous. Primavista and the Crow's Nest are on the border, closer to other parts of town. In general, driving aimlessly through the area is not recommended.\n*West End the little bit that survived of this once large densely populated neighborhood would not be notable for travelers except for the Dayton Street Historic District. At its peak in the mid to late 1800s this was a millionaires row that rivaled Prairie Avenue in Chicago, or 5th Avenue in New York City in terms of wealth.

While the original part of Copenhagen is located in a small area by the waterway between Zealand and Amager - consisting of several small boroughs with at least 600,000 inhabitants - Copenhagen has extended across other towns since the Finger Plan was implemented following the Second World War. Today these are distinctive municipalities, together making up the city's metropolitan area with around 2 million inhabitants. A notable exception is Frederiksberg, an independent municipality with its own mayor and municipal council, located inside Copenhagen. The other boroughs in and around Copenhagen are as follows:", "Around 1160 AD, King Valdemar handed over control of the city to the archbishop of , Absalon, one of the most colourful characters of the Middle Ages \u2014 a curious mix of great churchman, statesman, and warrior. As the country's only city not under the king's control, Absalon saw it thrive and erected a castle on what is today Slotsholmen (the remains are still visible in the catacombs under the present day parliament). As a man of religion he also built a great church, and with those necessities taken care of, Copenhagen quickly gained importance as a natural stop between the two most important Danish cities, the old royal capital and in present day Sweden. Endowed with an enviable location on the banks of the important \u00d8resund Strait, it slowly but steadily surpassed the old urban centres. Copenhagen's rise was greatly aided by entrepreneurial trading with friends and foes alike and by prosperous fishing which provided much of Roman Catholic Europe with salted herring for Lent. But with prosperity comes envy and in the years to follow Copenhagen was laid waste and pillaged time and time again, mainly by the German Hanseatic League, which at one point completely destroyed the city.", "But like a phoenix, Copenhagen repeatedly rose from the ashes. When the Danes kicked out the Pope during the reformation, Roskilde lost its importance as a Roman bishopric and after taking control of the city twenty years earlier, the king moved his residence to Copenhagen. Not terribly keen on seeing their new capital laid to waste once more, successive kings built massive fortifications around the city. None more so than King Christian IV, who embarked on a building rampage which not only included the ramparts still visible throughout much of the city but also many present day landmarks like the Round Tower and the stock exchange. Since then Copenhagen was besieged by the Swedes, and then famously bombarded, set ablaze, and nearly destroyed by the British vice admiral Lord Nelson, who in one of two battles for Copenhagen, famously responded to the order to withdraw by saying \"You know, Foley, I have only one eye. I have a right to be blind sometimes,\" and then raised the telescope to his blind eye and touted \"I really do not see the signal.\"", "Again, the city shook off its struggles and the population mushroomed during the industrialisation. When a cholera epidemic did a fine job of killing nearly everyone there wasn't room for, the King finally conceded that long range cannons would render its constraining walls irrelevant, and thus allowed the city to grow outside the now antiquated ramparts. But it was not long before a new modern fortification was built (known as Vestvolden today), which made Copenhagen 's most fortified city of the late nineteenth century.", "After being subjected to yet another invasion during the Second World War, the whole idea of a fortified city was thrown out the window and replaced with one of the finest examples of urban planning anywhere \u2014 the Finger Plan. Copenhagen is one of few cities in the world to devise a long term plan for growth and then actually stick to it; try placing your hand over a map of Copenhagen with the palm as the city centre, and it's quite obvious why it's called the finger plan. Despite being the laughing stock of the country through the seventies and eighties when wealthy residents all moved out into the fingers, leaving behind an impoverished bankrupt city, a visit these days will prove that the phoenix has risen once more.", "Arguably one of the most famous Copenhagen residents had an impact on many visitors when they were children. The fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen have travelled the world, evolving and being absorbed into the global culture.

Its vibrancy, nightlife and tourist attractions are renowned and it is the most popular entry point for international visitors to Ireland. It's disproportionately large for the size of Ireland with nearly two million in the Greater Dublin Region - well over a third of the Republic's population! The centre is, however, relatively small and can be navigated by foot, with most of the population living in suburbs.", "When the English Civil Wars ended in 1649, Oliver Cromwell took over. Dublin experienced huge growth and development in the 17th century because many Protestant refugees from Europe came to Dublin. By the 17th century Dublin was the second greatest city, only behind London, and a period when great Georgian style buildings were constructed that still stand today. Georgian style architecture was popular from 1720 to 1840 during the times when George I, George II, George III, and George IV of England were ruling.", "Although some of Dublin's finest Georgian architecture was demolished in the mid-20th century, a remarkable amount remains. They were a reminder of the past British imperialism and were pulled without regard to their beauty and architectural significance. They were replaced with modernist or pastiche office blocks, St. Stephen's Green (Dublin 2) being a prime example. Thankfully, attitudes have changed significantly, and Dubliners are now rightly proud of their impressive buildings from all eras.", "Contrary to some popular perception, the city is not especially rainy.

Ballsbridge is Dublin's embassy district and is home to some of Ireland's most expensive roads including 'Shrewsbury Road', which is famous for being the sixth most expensive residential thoroughfare in the world and 'Ailesbury Road' which is equally as salubrious and home to the bulk of the capital's embassies including Spain and Poland.", "Dalkey and Killiney which lie on the southern most tip of Dublin are upmarket neighbourhoods and home to such celebrities as Bono, Maeve Binchy and Enya among others.

Performances by professional actors are central to the experience, not forgetting a fun-filled quiz with prizes for the winners.

After the video, eight members of each tour group will be selected to participate in a sampling of Irish, American, and Scotch whiskies after the tour (everyone else gets one portion of Jameson). The tour starts after the video with the guide walking everyone through various exhibits which detail the process of whiskey-making.

Built-in 1969, the bridge is far more spectacular to stand beneath than drive over, with an almost cathedral-like vista and a strange aura of calmness that betrays the likely traffic chaos that is going unseen directly above your head. Further west, the Clyde Arc, locally referred to as the \"Squinty Bridge\", is a relatively new and prominent bridge over the River Clyde that has an elegant curved design and is unique for how it crosses the river at an angle.\n* This imposing structure in George Square was built in 1888 in the Italian Renaissance style and is the headquarters of Glasgow City Council. Tours of the building are available daily, and visitors can see the magnificent marble staircases, and lobbies, see the debating chamber, and the lavish banqueting hall. In front, the building, George Square, the city's notional center, is populated by several statues of civic leaders and famous figures from history and is often used for outdoor events.", "* A fine example of Gothic architecture dating from medieval times and built on a site first consecrated in 397 AD. Behind the cathedral atop a steep hill is the Necropolis cemetery \u2013 dominated by the statue of John Knox and described by Victorians as a literal \u201cCity of The Dead\u201d.\n* The city's principal railway terminus, which is worth entering for its grand interior, which you can access from Gordon Street on the north side of the building. On the exterior, a feature of note is the massive glass-walled bridge (known as Hielanman's Umbrella) which spans Argyle Street and holds up the tracks and platforms. There's also an excellent station tour exploring the hidden corners of the station guided by a Network Rail historian (\u00a310)\n* This intersection marks the original medieval center of the city and is dominated by the clock tower of the original City Chambers (destroyed by fire in 1926), and the small hexagonal building known as the Tolbooth. Just to the west on Trongate is the Tron Theatre, a former church that was turned into a prominent theatre.\n* Seen as one of Charles Rennie Mackintosh's finest buildings, housing one of Britain's pre-eminent schools of art, design, and architecture. Guided tours of the building are available (you must book in advance), or if you want to create your own art in the building, you can enroll for evening classes or summer school.\n* Founded as an institution in 1451, the University itself is the fourth oldest in the entire United Kingdom, and one of the most prestigious academic institutions in the country. Contains the Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery, including a reconstruction of Mackintosh's house. The exterior of the main building is fine in its own right; the current main University building is neo-gothic and dates from 1870, designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott (the man who also designed London's St Pancras railway station). The main building has an interesting visitor's center (open all year round) which is free and sits atop a drumlin with commanding views over Kelvingrove Park and the western fringes of the city.\n* Now run by the National Trust, and currently in the process of being renovated, Holmwood House is one of the best examples of the work of Glasgow's other great architect: Alexander 'Greek' Thomson.\n* Built in the 1990s to Mackintosh's original 1901 entry for a design competition.\n* One of Glasgow's best public buildings, it is the largest municipal public reference library in Europe. The imposing structure houses a spectacular reading room, although it has to be said much of Mitchell's extensive collection is housed in the rather ugly 1970s extension attached to the rear. You can easily lose a day in here!", "For a large city, Glasgow has a surprising number of parks and green spaces; there is more parkland here than in any other British city. \n* \n* A major park in the West End (the most popular aside from Kelvingrove), the Botanic Gardens contains extensive tropical and temperate plant collections from around the world.\n* The most famous of the Glasgow parks, Glasgow Green was founded by Royal grant in 1450 and has slowly been enclosed by the city and evolved from grazing land into a modern public park. \"The Green\" as it is known to the locals is one of the major venues for concerts and open-air events in Glasgow. Among the highlights are the People's Palace and Winter Gardens (covered above), Nelson's Memorial, an obelisk or needle: built to commemorate Nelson's victory at the battle of Trafalgar, the Templeton Carpet Factory, with its ornate brickwork (now a business center), and the Doulton Fountain, the largest terracotta fountain in the world. There is limited official parking in or around the green and the area is notorious for car crime. Be aware the council will tow away illegally parked vehicles and charge you up to \u00a3250 pounds to get them back!\n* In the city's West End, this is also a very popular park, particularly with the students from the nearby University. The most prominent landmark here is the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum (covered above) on the banks of the River Kelvin which runs through the park. It also contains a recently constructed skate park.\n* \n* \n* \n* Tollcross Park is internationally famous for its unique Rose Garden and impressive (now dismantled) Winter Gardens. The park has many hidden gems including the Glen Nature Walk, Children's Farm, and Courtyard Visitor Centre. The park is full of points of interest and offers a welcome retreat from the busy surrounding streets. The park is open from dawn until dusk. However, the specific facilities in the park may differ.\n* Fossil Grove is the remains of an ancient forest, around 330 million years old. This is the only example of a preserved forest from this period on Earth .", "Do\nThere are many theatres, concerts, and festivals in Glasgow.", "Music\nGlasgow's been famous for its music scene(s) for at least 20 years, with some top acts literally queuing to play at venues such as the Barrowlands or King' Tuts.

Converted into an open-plan bar by the Wetherspoon chain, it\u2019s popular with tourists and locals, with quirky features such as the bank vault now being used as a wine cellar.\n* Another Wetherspoons establishment, good for evening football; and a good place to meet up if you are heading across to the O2 Academy or the Citizen\u2019s Theatre on the other side of the river.\n* Vaguely Irish-themed bar with its curious 'Lord of the Rings'-like setting.

While the beers can be quite expensive, you'll be hard pushed to find better quality food for the price in the city center. A must-visit.\n* It is a similarly good ale venue and a cozy proper pub if you're sick of trendy bars. \n* Lovely West End establishment with a continually changing board of ales from all over the UK on tap and a cider.

The center of Glasgow is very safe and you should not encounter any problems. All of the city center and tourist areas are well-policed.

All are easily reachable via regular train services from Central Station.\n* Take a day-trip to the . It is possible to obtain train/ferry tickets to reach the island. The Isle of Arran is known as \"Scotland in Miniature\" due to the fact it contains many features of mainland Scotland in a microcosm. Brodick Castle is home to beautiful gardens and has a path connecting to path up Goat Fell, the highest point on Arran which offers stunning views of Brodick Bay during the summer (The Castle is located at the north end of Brodick, a student discount is available). The island is also littered with sites of archaeological and historical interest including many circles of ancient standing stones. Take one of the circle island buses to see it all.

It's a 30-minute walk from Clarkston railway station (catch the train from Central Station (High Level)). The gardens have proven to be an inspiration to gardeners throughout the world.\n* A short (30-40min) bus journey Westbound down the M8 towards Houston is a good day out. Houston is a traditional Scottish village steeped in history (and is nearby to both traditional leather tanning town Bridge-Of-Weir and upmarket Kilmacolm, home to many local celebrities), but its main draw is the Fox & Hounds Pub, home to Houston Brewing Company. You'd be amazed how many Glaswegians have made this same short journey to sample the ale and traditional Scottish beers of Houston! Several brews are available all year round, with seasonal specialties on tap depending on the month. Tours of the small but well-respected brewing operation are available. This is one of Central Scotland's most well-regarded brewing communities, and well worth a trip. Houston is well served by two bus companies, but watch out as the service back into Glasgow is around 11PM.\n* Take a hike up the Kilpatrick Hills. Kilpatrick Station is only a 50-minute train journey from Queen Street Station (Low Level) on weekdays and Saturdays, and Central Station (Low Level) on Sundays. The hills are huge and from the highest peaks, you can admire Greater Glasgow from a distance, with views as far as Edinburgh, Stirlingshire, Ayrshire, and the Highlands on the clearest days.

It's essential to know which zones are safe, less safe or a complete no-go for tourists. Here's a rundown of the zones:\n*Zona 1 - Zona 1 is essentially the downtown of Guatemala City. This where you will most likely start your tour of the city as here are most of the tourist attractions. During the day you'll find many visitors seeing the sights and locals shopping, eating or working. It's ok to wander the zone during the day but stay in populated areas and don't enter side streets. At night avoid the zone COMPLETELY. Once shops close the area becomes deserted and dark. There are many cheap hotels and hostels here but it's better to stay in another a bit pricier but safer part of town. \n*Zona 10, 13, 14, 15 and 16 - Zones 10, 13, 14, 15 and 16 are essentially the \"safe\" areas of Guatemala where the upper middle class and wealthy citizens live. These areas are full of gated communities like Colonia Oakland, Colonia La Canada (where many foreign embassies are located) and others. Here are also the cities more reputable hotels aimed directly at tourists. \n*Zona 2, 4, and 17 - Zones 2, 4, 9 and 17 are the \"middle\" zones when it comes to crime. They are generally considered nice for tourists to stay but you should be more vigilant here at nighttime than in the safer aforementioned zones. You should always do more research when booking a hotel in Zona 2 and Zona 17 as some parts are much more dangerous than others. \n*Zona 3, 5..8, 11, 12, 17...21 - All the Zones from 5 to 8 and 17 to 21 along with Zona 3 and Zones 11-12 are very dangerous. Tourists SHOULD NOT go there at any time of day. These are the parts of the city where 80% of the violent crime happens as armed robberies and muggings are common even at noon.

The latter was unveiled in 1872 in commemoration of Harald Fairhair\u2019s gathering of Norway into one kingdom. The legend goes that he was buried here.\n \n*Archaeological excavations The ground and sound at the old royal farm at Avaldsnes still hold secrets that can give us new knowledge about Norwegian and international history. Excavations have led to the discovery of traces of old buildings close to St. Olav\u2019s Church.

Projects are in place to excavate more of the area in order to find out more about these important and exciting findings.\n \n*St\u00f8dle St\u00f8dle, in the municipality of Etne, is another important historical area in Haugalandet. During parts of the Middle Ages, St\u00f8dle was the main seat of power in Norway. From here king Magnus Erlingsson ruled Norway at the end of the 12th century. His father, earl Erling Skakke, built a chapel at the royal farm. The chapel dates back to 1160 and today it is part of the current St\u00f8dle church.

St\u00f8dle is situated about one hour by car east of Haugesund.\n \n*Rehaugene At the top of Karm\u00f8y, six imposing earthen burial mounds, which dominate the landscape, were built during the Bronze Age (1800 \u2013 500 BC). There used to be many more burial mounds here, however, only six remain, and they are called the pyramids of the north. They were built as the final resting place for the powerful chiefs that lived at Avaldsnes. These burial mounds show that 3000 years ago Norway traded with communities as far away as Russia, Ireland and the Mediterranean.\n \n*Flagghaugen Flagghaugen is a burial mound dating back to the third century AD. It is situated just north of St. Olavs Church. Originally it was 43 meters in diameter and 5 meters high. The remaining parts can be seen just outside of the stone fence surrounding the church. A prince was buried here, and in the grave the richest gold finds from any grave in Scandinavia from the Later Roman Iron Age was found. Among the findings was a massive necklace made of 590 grams of pure gold. The prince is presented at the Nordvegen History Centre close by.\n \n*Ryvarden The Icelandic Book of Settlement, Landn\u00e1ma, says that Fl\u00f2ke Vilgjerdson build a beacon at Ryvarden in 868 before he sailed to Iceland. He was the first man to sail to Iceland with the purpose of settling there, and he is also the one who gave Iceland its name. The story goes that he used three ravens to show him the way, hence the name he is now known by; Ravnafloke (Raven-Floke). The first Viking raid is also said to have originated from Ryvarden. There is a small museum at Ryvarden telling the story of Ravnafloke. Of course, the highlight of a trip to Ryvarden is simply taking in the breathtaking scenery.\n \n*The Viking Centre The Viking Settlement at Avaldsnes is copy of a Viking settlement, complete with a longhouse and all the requisites, has been reconstructed, just below the Church of Olav in Avaldsnes.\n*Near to Karm\u00f8y, this is the ancient hole dating back to 972 in which irritating Swedes were thrown to be mauled by bears.

It is also the birthplace of cinema.", "History\nAll periods of Lyon's 2000-year history have left visible traces in the city's architectural and cultural heritage, from Roman ruins to Renaissance palaces to contemporary skyscrapers. It never went through a major disaster (earthquake, fire, extensive bombing) or a complete redesign of urban plans. Very few cities in the world boast such diversity in their urban structure and architecture.", "Lyon's public transportation system, known as TCL is regarded as one of the most efficient in the country.

Unfortunately, it is impossible to visit the building except during the \"Heritage days\" (Journ\u00e9es du Patrimoine) in mid-September.\n* The state of this square was typical of the \"automobile-friendly\" urban planning of the 1960s: it was covered with tarmac, too much so given the reasonable traffic around it. The latest renovation gave the square a greener aspect and more space for pedestrians. The main interest is the central fountain (1885) by architect Gaspard Andr\u00e9 and sculptor Degeorges. The four statues portray Lyon-born artists: painter Hippolyte Flandrin (1809-1864), engraver G\u00e9rard Audran (1640-1703), sculptor Guillaume Coustou (1677-1746), and architect Philibert Delorme (1510-1570).\n* This impressive painted wall portraits some of the most famous people who were born in Lyon, from Renaissance poet Louise Lab\u00e9 to the Lumi\u00e8re brothers, the inventors of cinema, and the chef Paul Bocuse.\n* Opposite the City Hall stands the opera house. The 1826 theatre built by Chenavard and Pollet was completely redesigned by Jean Nouvel who kept only the fa\u00e7ades and the foyer on the first floor. The building was reopened in 1993.

Built between 1180 and 1480, it is mostly of Gothic style with Romanesque elements; the oldest parts are the chancel and the lateral chapels, and as one goes towards the facade, the style becomes more and more Gothic. The Cathedral hosts a spectacular astronomical clock originally built in the 14th century but modified later. However, since renovations, the clock has been stopped. Over the main door, the rose window, known as the \"Lamb rose window\", is an admirable work of art depicting the life of St Stephen and St John the Baptist.\n* St Georges is the name given to the south part of the Vieux Lyon. It has nice Renaissance buildings which, however, do not compare to the palaces of St Jean; on the other hand, it is much more quiet than the St Jean area.\n* A very nice church, with mixed Romanesque and Gothic styles. The oldest parts are from the 10th century.\n* The traboules are a typical architectural feature of Lyon's historical buildings. They are corridors that link two streets through a building, and usually a courtyard. Many traboules are unique architectural masterpieces, largely influenced by Italy and especially Florence. To open the doors, just press the service button next to the door code keyboard. If you are unable to enter from one side, try the opposite entrance. In the morning, many other doors are open for service (mail, garbage collecting), so more traboules are accessible.

A free visit to the Roman theatres may be just as interesting for those not into the details.\n* Located in the Lumi\u00e8re brothers' house, this museum presents an interesting history of cinema through various items and film excerpts. Also is worth seeing for the lovely architecture.\n* After 10 years of major refurbishment works, these museums dedicated to the history of the city and to puppets (like the famous Guignol from Lyon) were reopened in June 2009, with great public and critical success. The building itself, a magnificent Renaissance palace, is worth a visit. A nice garden and cafe have also been created at the top of the building (free access).\n* Created by artist Dan Ohlmann, this private gallery shows about 120 miniature models of all kinds of scenes: houses, restaurants, workshops, schools, etc., from Lyon or elsewhere, historical or contemporary. The accuracy of the models is astonishing and some sections will be really fun for children. Movie sceneries are also presented.

It was initially a traditional religious celebration: on December 8th, 1852, the people of Lyon spontaneously illuminated their windows with candles to celebrate the inauguration of the golden statue of the Virgin Mary (the Virgin had been the saint patron of Lyon since she allegedly saved the city from the plague in 1643). The same ritual was then repeated every year. In the last decade or so, the celebration turned into an international event, with light shows by professional artists from all over the world. Those range from tiny installations in remote neighborhoods to massive sound-and-light shows, the largest one traditionally taking place on Place des Terreaux. The traditional celebration lives on, though: during the weeks preceding December 8th, the traditional candles and glasses are sold by shops all over town. This festival attracts around 4 million visitors every year. It now compares, in terms of attendance, to the Oktoberfest in Munich for example. Needless to say, accommodation for this period should be booked months in advance. You will also need good shoes (to avoid the crowd in the metro) and very warm clothes (it can be very cold at this time of year).\n* The Roman theatres host various shows such as concerts (popular music, jazz, classical), dancing, theatre, and cinema.

Most places close around 3AM, then people move to nearby areas to continue partying (clubs in Gran V\u00eda or Tribunal).\n* Barrio de las Letras / Huertas - Many of Spain's most famous writers lived there (Cervantes, Quevedo, etc.). It's in between Lavapi\u00e9s, Puerta del Sol, and Paseo del Prado. It is an area full of history and interesting buildings and is also well-known because of its concentration of bars, pubs, restaurants, and hotels. Plaza de Santa Ana is a beautiful square. It can be considered \"too touristic\" for some local people.\n* Chueca - Near Malasa\u00f1a and Gran V\u00eda. It is the gay district (although no one is ever excluded) with a very strong personality. New design, trendy shops, cool cafes. Pop and electronic music. By far, the most cosmopolitan place in town.

The area centered on Calle Calatrava (what the locals call 'Chuecatina') is has developed into a gay (very hetero-friendly) zone. It's surprisingly very crowded on Sunday mornings, from 11AM to late in the afternoon due to its close location to the flea market El Rastro.\n* Lavapi\u00e9s - Multicultural quarter of the city, with more than 50% foreign residents, mostly from Africa, Asia, and Latin America. An increasing amount of westerners are choosing Lavapies as their residence in Madrid, mainly because of the hip vibe it has attained in recent years.

Inside you can climb to the upper floors for the excellent views out the window and look out too.

This impressive square is now one of the main stops on any tourist's visit. Originally built outside the city walls, this enclosed square hosted bullfights, markets, symphonies, tournaments and executions. Today it is ringed with tourist shops, cafes and restaurants. The statue of Philip III sits in the middle across from the Casa de la Panader\u00eda, a beautifully painted building with two towers on the north side of the square (not to be confused with the other building with two towers on the opposite side) which once served as the headquarters of the bakers' guild and now houses a tourist information office. Access to the square is via one of the many arcades which connect to the surrounding pedestrian streets.", "* The Palacio Real (Royal Palace) is an enormous palace, one of the biggest in Europe, with plains of concrete around it. Though it is the official residence of the King of Spain, the royal family does not actually reside here and it is generally used only for state ceremonies. The Royal Palace is considered to be one of the most iconic and beautiful buildings in Madrid, not only for its location (overlooking the river valley) but also for its architecture and the artistic treasures to be found in the rooms. A simple one-way tour of the palace (both self-guided and guided are available) takes you up the grand stairway and through the lavishly decorated state rooms with their elegant tapestries, frescoes, porcelain, carvings and added decor like china, silverware, medals, etc. From the courtyard, you can access the Farmacia (Pharmacy), which contains hundreds of bottles of early medicines and a reconstructed laboratory, and the Real Armorial (Royal Armory), a two-story collection of medieval weapons and armor. Explanations in the armory are in Spanish only, so do not expect to understand much unless your know the Spanish names for all that medieval weaponry. The lines to get in are very long, especially on Wednesday when the place is free - try to go early. Photography inside the palace is not allowed.\n* A prominent square on the northwest side of the central district, adjacent to two of the tallest buildings in Madrid: the Torre de Madrid (the taller, white one) and the Edificio Espa\u00f1a (the red and white one). The square contains a large fountain and a sculpture of Cervantes with his famous Don Quixote and Sancho Panza characters.\n* This indoor market is located near Plaza Mayor and identifiable by its ornate iron posts. Built in 1913, it's full of a wide range of high-quality food. Even if you're not buying anything, it's worth entering for the sights and smells of dried ham, fine wine, freshly baked goods, and other treats from the vendors inside.\n* This plaza is the heart of Madrid and one of the busiest places in the city - a hub for the local transit system, a favorite meeting spot for locals, an area for festivals or political demonstrations, and a suitable location for tour guides, street performers, pickpockets and anyone else looking to take advantage of all the tourists on hand. In the center of the plaza sits the Statue of King Charles III on horseback, facing the Royal Post Office (Real Casa de Correos), the red-and-white building adorned with a clock tower on the plaza's south side. Originally the building served as Madrid's first post office, then the police headquarters under Franco before being transformed into its current use as the office of the President of Madrid, the head of the regional government. The clock tower is noteworthy for being the center focus of New Year's celebrations every year, which are broadcast across Spain and mark the traditional eating of the Twelve Grapes (one for each ring of the bell) and the beginning of a new year. In front of the building is Kilometer Zero (Kil\u00f3metro Cero), a plaque showing the point where the measuring of the national highway system begins. On the east side of the plaza is the famous Bear and the Madro\u00f1o Tree Statue, a bear climbing a madro\u00f1o tree, which is the symbol of Madrid. Nearby the giant neon sign of T\u00edo Pepe sits above the plaza and is a famous figure of this area.\n* The main square during the Middle Ages, as Calle Mayor (High Street) was the main street as well.

First of all, it is a fortress city used to be surrounded by a moat now transformed into a putting green, and it is where the old Spanish Fort Santiago was headquartered. The fort, converted into a museum, a very historical piece of landmark where almost all the who's who of Philippine colonial resistance - Spanish, American, & Japanese were incarcerated. It used to house a dozen or so churches and congregation mother houses that during clear skies, the skyline was picturesquely lined with cupolas and spires and the morning air was deafening with peeling bells coming from belfries; the finest assembly of colonial architecture, just reduced to ashes with the exception of San Agust\u00edn Church during the last World War. Sir Banister Fletcher, a noted architectural historian wrote \"Until...years ago the Philippines could offer many well-preserved examples of Spanish architecture of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Intramuros, the old walled stronghold of Manila, the capital, which was once a treasure-house of ultramarine Hispanic art, suffered irreparable damage during World War II.\" Ultramarine Hispanic Art, whatever it was, must have been another lost 8th Wonder of the World which this and future generations have sorely missed.

At the east end of the Park is where used to be Wallace Field where the American-style Mardi Gras festival Manila Carnival was yearly held for 32 years until it was abruptly ended by World War II.

This is a popular hike for Mendocinos at the weekend, but during the week it may be deserted. You can treat yourself to a hearty asado at the restaurant - although beware that restaurant has two menus, one more expensive than the other! From the Mirador the hike is about a 3.5 hour round trip. Get out of the area well before dark.

All citizens of Munich were invited to a meadow (Wiesn) situated in front of the city tower, subsequently renamed the Theresienwiese in honor of the bride. In the early years of the fair, horse races were held, then as the event grew, an agricultural convention, which still takes place every fourth year, was added to the program. In 1896, businessmen working with the breweries in Munich built the first giant beer tents at Oktoberfest, and beer drinking has been the primary focus ever since. Today, the Oktoberfest is the best-known beer festival around the world and has been replicated on all continents. In 2011, the Oktoberfest hosted 6.9 million visitors from around the world who drank 7.5 million liters of beer and ate the equivalent of 118 boxes and 522,821 roasted chickens. At the center of the spectacle are 14 large beer tents, which are set up along the Wirtsbudenstrasse in the northern part of Theresienwiese. These have a seating capacity of up to 8,500 inside the tent and add hundreds or thousands of seats in the adjacent beer gardens. Here only beer of the 6 major Munich breweries (Augustiner, Hacker-Pschorr, Hofbr\u00e4u, L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u, Paulaner, Spaten-Franziskaner) is sold. The tents in alphabetical order are: \n 1. Armbrustsch\u00fctzen-Festhalle (Paulaner beer, here a crossbow shooting competition is held each year)\n 2. Augustiner-Festhalle (Augustiner beer, here the beer is still drafted from the traditional wooden barrels)\n 3. Br\u00e4urosl (Hacker-Pschorr beer)\n 4.

During the week, most tents are open all day, however, it is not easy to get a seat if you are a larger group. It is a general rule that you will not get served if you do not have a seat. The exception is the Hofbr\u00e4u Festzeltwhere beer is also served in a standing area. It is not recommended to leave the tent if you want to get in it later since it might be crowded by that time. There are also smaller beer tents, which also offer beer, Bavarian food, and Oktoberfest music and it might be possible to still get a seat there when the large tents are already full. However, the Oktoberfest has more to offer than the parties inside the beer tents. In the Schaustellerstrasse you can ride numerous roller coasters - assuming you are still able to do so after enjoying the Munich beer. Finally a few general hints:\n** Accommodation will be hard to find and prices can easily double during Oktoberfest. \n** Smoking is not allowed in the tents, but some tents feature designated outdoor smoking areas. Think twice if you want leave a tent for smoking since you may not get in again.\n** The closest underground station \"Theresienwiese\" (underground lines U4 and U5) is very crowded and will sometimes be closed because of this. As an alternative, go to the underground station \"Goetheplatz\" (lines U3 and U6). It's crowded too, but you will still have some air to breathe there. Just follow the crowd when you get out of the station.\n** In most beer tents the bar closes at 10:30pm while the tent closes at 11:30pm. You should have finished your beer before then since the security will ruthlessly clear the area.\n** Tents open at 10am usually (9am on weekends). The first day is tapping day (german \"Anstich\"). There is no beer served before noon and since the tents will surely be crowded by then, it will take some time until everyone is served.\n** If you are with small children, try to avoid the weekends. Every Tuesday from 12 to 6pm is a family day with discounts on many rides.\n** Do not steal the 1-liter beer glasses. They might seem like a great souvenir, but bags are checked and everyone trying to steal a beer glass will be handed over to the police. If you really want one of these glasses, you can buy them for a few Euros.\n** Stay out of fights - the police will arrest you and if you are crazy enough to hit and injure someone with a beer stein you will get charged with attempted manslaughter!\n* St. Patrick's Day Munich Parade of Irish and Scottish unions that attracts 30.000 visitors and is the largest Irish event east of Dublin.\n* Theatron Festivals Two further music festivals in Munich, the Theatron Pfingstfestival during Whitsun and the Musiksommer in August.\n* Tollwood &mdash; In summer this alternative festival takes place in the Olympic Park, in winter on Theresienwiese (the Oktoberfest area).

Although sometimes controversial in theme, many locals regard Naples\u2019 street art scene fondly, often offering up their walls, shop fronts, and doors for decoration. It\u2019s best to explore with an expert on a guided tour who can translate Italian phrases and help you find some hidden works.\n* Naples is rich in different museums and the most recommended museums to be visited are the National Archaeological Museum of Naples, the Capodimonte Museum (art paintings), and the Donnaregina Museum of Contemporary Art. If you are interested in sacred art visit Museo Diocesano in Donna Regina Nuova church. In Pio Monte of Mercy church and gallery see Neapolitan Baroque paintings.\n* Street art & graffiti tour is a tourist walk through the Neapolitan historical center among murals, stencils, slogans, posters, and graffiti to discover urban art.\n* There are over 200 of them and it is a complex of urban systems that connect various areas of the city. The history of these ramps is mainly due to expansions outside the walls of the 16th century. The stairways of Naples are ancient pedestrian paths that connect the hills with the center and the coast. The oldest graded paths of the city, most of the time, were born thanks to the coverage of streams or springs, which once flowed just outside the city. These paths were also made to easily connect retreats, monasteries, churches, markets, or other urban needs. The stairs of Naples are ancient pedestrian paths that connect different areas of the city, generally joining the hilly areas with the center and the promenade. Are considered real works of art in urban planning and, despite today there being faster and less tiring means of connection, they are still used for their charm. They were built starting from the 16th century when the Spanish viceroy decided to expand the city beyond the Vomero hill towards the \"lower town\", but over the centuries they were also built in other districts. They are very beautiful to travel to and allow you to experience the city from another point of view, discovering new corners and glimpses always new. Many have disappeared, but there are still tens, and among the most famous there are the Ascent of Pedamentina, Ramps of the Petraio, Calata San Francesco, Salita Moiariello and the Stairs of Sant'Antonio ai Monti. They are still the subject of study and are considered real urban masterpieces.\n* The viceroy Fernandez Ruiz de Castro wanted a great palace to host the king and the Spanish court, so he built the Royal Palace of Naples. There is another royal palace in Naples Capodimonte which played the role of summer residence. The Palace of the Spaniards of Neapolitan Baroque architecture has been filmed for many movies and TV series.\n* The breathtaking panorama of the Bay of Naples is best appreciated from the seafront or Castel Sant\u2019Elmo. On a clear day, you can see not only Vesuvius but also the shimmering outlines of the islands Capri and Ischia. The Terrace of the Camaldoli Hermitage opens a great panorama of the city of Naples and its Gulf. Belvedere di Sant\u2019Antonio a Posillipo offers a stunning view across the bay to Mt. Vesuvius on the opposite shore. Also, Posilipo has other great viewpoints.\n* Naples has very special parks. Visit Vergil Park at Piedigrotta a legendary place where is located tombstone of poet Virgil. Pausilypon Archaeological Park is accessed through the imposing Grotta di Seiano, a Roman tunnel more than 700m long. is an area of intense volcanic activity that has left the area riddled with caves, thermal springs, and craters. Botanical Garden of Naples is the only garden in Naples with ferns, citrus palm trees, and other plants growing there. The Garden was opened in 1807.\n* Piazza del Plebiscito is an interesting and fascinating symbol of Naples that reflects an era of the city and which has a high historical value. Piazza Dante in particular represents the authentic soul of the city. Piazza Monteoliveto is popular with young people.\n* Visiting Piazza del Plebiscito you will find two equestrian statues of kings. It is worth attention Statue of the god Nile situated on a small square.\n* Naples's colorful and chaotic streets have a charm of their own. Originally the heart of the Greek and Roman city, the Spaccanapoli district is a string of narrow, winding streets and is mainly a pedestrian zone so it's a fun place to wander around. Representing 28 centuries of history, the neighborhood is a crowded mix of historic churches, lively piazzas, open-air caf\u00e9s, and one-of-a-kind shops. It\u2019s also home to local inhabitants whose boisterous lives often spill onto the streets, providing visitors with a glimpse of what it means to be Neapolitan Vecchia.\n* Over the past time, the city of Naples has been transforming sections of the subway system into full-fledged art galleries by contemporary artists to make the urban area\u2019s public transport centers more attractive. A total of 14 stations (as of 2014) distributed along lines 1 and 6 of the Metro network have been decorated with over 200 works by more than 100 artists and architects. The underground station in Naples represents one of the most interesting Italian experiments on the permanent insertion of contemporary artwork in an urban context. The first to be filled with colors, mosaics, installations, sculptures, and photographs were the stations of Line 1: Museum \u2013 Dante \u2013 Salvator Rosa \u2013 Materdei \u2013 Cilea/Quattro Giornate \u2013 Vanvitelli \u2013 Rione Alto. Recently built Universit\u00e0, Toledo, Garibaldi, and Municipio. The project also extended to Line 6 with the following stations: Lala \u2013 Mergellina \u2013 Augusto \u2013 Mostra. Try to explore!\n:* It is very mysterious with its black little bricks and its suspended escalators (yes, they are suspended!); while Universit\u00e0 station is so colorful, Tetris style; so unbelievable! You can go from the Oliviero Toscani collage at Montecalvario to the Fibonacci spiral at Vanvitelli and the Roman aqueduct at Salvator Rosa station.\n:* It is impressive is voted no.1 in many rankings. Some artists, really good designers, and architects are contributing to this art program. Now you have at least one good reason to visit Naples. Toledo station is the most probably the most amazing one: it has also been prized as the greatest and most impressive metro in Europe: with its ochre mosaics, followed by the bluestones. When you are halfway on the last escalator don\u2019t forget to look up! Toledo was designed by the Spanish architect Oscar Tusquets Blanca. The most impressive work of this station is Crater de Luz, by Robert Wilson, which connects the inside with the outside and remembers the sea in its many aspects, as well as the wavy walls surrounding it. The brightness and colors that fill the space with different shades of blue fascinate thousands of passengers every year. The same artist is a digital installation that replicates the sea waves for a surface of 24 meters and covers the walls of the corridor leading to the dock, By the sea, you and me is the title of the work. Inside the station, everything remembers the recent history of Naples. On the first floor, you can admire the remains of the Aragonese walls that cradled the area in medieval times, but in the atrium, you can find two events related to the Parthenon people depicted in two beautiful and colorful mosaics: a procession guided by St. Gennaro the patron saint of the city and a scene that recalls the works for the construction of the subway.\n:* The metro was so close to the castle and the sea, that they found two whole Roman vessels during the excavations! So they built it placing one side of it on the castle\u2019s walls: just in Naples, you could find something like this!\n* Caves Naples was the most heavily bombed city in Italy and the Fontanelle, along with the other underground spaces in the city, served as a bomb shelter. The Fontanelle is a combination of natural caves, tufa mines, and ancient Greek and Roman tunnels. Naples, in the shadow of Vesuvius, is located in the Campi Flegrei an area of intense volcanic activity that has left the area riddled with caves, thermal springs, and craters. The early Greek residents of the area carved and quarried the soft volcanic stone, using some of the underground spaces as their own burial places. The Romans that followed dug networks of tunnels and aqueducts through the hills, often connected with the natural cave systems, all of which left modern Naples and the surrounding countryside riddled with underground spaces of all kinds. Naples is a town floating on the hollow space of underground cavities. Napoli was built on a large stratum of tufa rock. Artificial caves were added to the natural ones since the early years of the city's foundation. Greeks and Romans used the subsoil as a parallel city, opening aqueducts, catacombs, and warehouses. The tufa has been until recent times the main building material and many quarries have been opened just underneath the town. Moreover, through the ages, Naples has developed in a strange way, growing layer by layer on a vertical line, the modern levels added on the oldest ones. That\u2019s the reason why when you walk into the historical center, Naples's past is under your feet.", "Do\nNaples has an abundance of attractions and activities that await its annual tourists. There is no way to list them all here, but below are some of the most popular things to do in Naples:\n* The beaches of Naples are located on the eastern and western edges of the city. Eastern beaches are characterized by dark sand. La Gaiola Beach on the western coast is one of the most beautiful Neapolitan beaches as well as less affected by urban influence and contamination. There are nice rocky beaches in Lido Marechiaro, Bagno Elena, or private Rocce Verdi beach. Miseno Beach already has a sandy shore.\n* The history of cinema in Naples begins at the end of the 19th century the first of which was the Panorama of Naples Harbor. Over time, many cinematographic works have been recorded, production houses have been established, many notable filmmakers have been born, and many prizes have been won. Over the decades the Neapolitan capital has also been used as a film set for many works, over 600 according to the Internet Movie Database. When you go to the cinema, never forget that Tot\u00f2 is an icon of Naples, the \u201cprince of jokes\u201d who made hundreds laugh. Recognize and visit locations where many films were created\n* \n* Any small idea can be generated into a tour. Naples is full of different attractions.\n* Naples is full of surprises and secrets. It\u2019s a city with bizarre superstitions.\n* \n* Football is the most popular sport in Naples. This sport is deeply rooted in the local culture: it is popular at every level of society, from street children to wealthy professionals. The city's best-known football club is SSC Napoli.\n* A fun 1.5-hour tour through the old Greek and Roman city and aqueducts buried under the modern city; also includes some WWII history as this area was used as a bomb shelter.

(Note: The nearby San Lorenzo Maggiore also has underground ruins of the old Roman market, but they are much less extensive and there is typically no guide).\n* Naples has many great theatres. First of all, the most famous and prestigious Theater in the world San Carlo, an opera house in Naples opened in 1737. Seeing an opera in this theatre is a unique experience, a show inside the show. The other less prestigious Napulitana (Neapolitan songs), Teatro Bellini (Performing arts), Teatro Augusteo (Performing arts), and Palapartenope Theater.\n* The Spaccanapoli course stands out for its color and noise, which is interesting because it divides the city of Naples into two parts. From there, travel to St. Severus Chapel (Cappella Sansevero), which preserves a famous 18th-century masterpiece of the Neapolitan sculptor Giuseppe Sanmartino - \"Veiled Christ \" (Cristo Velato). The sculpture depicting the dead Christ wrapped in a veil is still a mystery to sculpture fans, who cannot find an explanation as to how the author managed to get such a thin veil out of marble; Walk along the seashore: Via Nazario Sauro, Via Partenope, and Via Francesco Caracciolo.

The truth is however that Naples is much safer than it was 5-10 years ago and if you take the right precautions a tourist shouldn't experience any problems in the city.", "Another thing that tourists should definitely watch out for is pickpockets. Always secure your bags with both straps on your shoulders, carry as much cash as needed for your day, and if possible don't have your mobile phones in your pocket. Don't flash around expensive jewelry, cameras, necklaces, or other expensive items. Be alert at all times in buses, trams, and the metro, and don't leave your personal belongings unattended in a cafeteria or a restaurant table. If you have a car: make sure that you don't leave anything valuable inside that can be seen from outside and park in secure parking and not on the street whenever possible. You might have heard about thieves on board Vespas or other kinds of motorcycles running around stealing bags right off people's shoulders. This is not a myth and it used to happen but such occurrences subsided a lot in recent years as the police have stepped up their presence in the city. In the unlikely event that this happens DON'T hold on to your bag; the vespa is much stronger than you and this could result in serious injuries.", "Areas to be careful\nNaples has some seedy neighborhoods where tourists should exercise caution or even avoid it completely. Here's a rundown of the neighborhoods: \n*Stazione Centrale - Like many other cities in Italy and the rest of Europe the area around the central train station is rundown, sketchy, and filled with homeless people, beggars, and vendors selling fake products to tourists exiting the train station. A few of them can become quite persistent but most will not bother you if you ignore them. During the day you need to stay vigilant and be careful of your belongings and luggage. If you arrive after nightfall minimize walking around as much as possible and take a cab to reach your hotel; if you walk with your luggage during the night in the area it's like putting a sign on your head saying \"TOURIST\". That could make you a target for people with no good intentions. There are many cheap hotels here; while the price may seem tempting it's better to pay a bit more to stay at a safer place.", "*Quartieri Spagnoli - Many people find Quartieri Spagnoli quite charming during the day with its colorful markets and beautiful vicolis; even one of Naples' most famous pizzerias is located here! But during the night its narrow and dark streets make it a good place for criminals, drug dealers, and prostitutes. This doesn't mean however that you're automatically in danger; if you want to visit the area during the night just know exactly where you're going and don't linger in the streets for too long. \n*The rest of Centro Storico - Centro Storico is the beating heart of Naples during the day and it can remain quite busy even after midnight. After nightfall just make sure you are walking on the main avenues avoiding narrow, dark vicolis devoid of other pedestrians and you won't encounter any problems.\n*Via Marina and the Port - Naples' port is bustling during daytime as many people, tourists and locals alike, board ships for the Amalfi Coast and other places around Campania. But during the night you should definitely avoid walking along Via Marina and don't, for any reason, go to the dockyards or abandoned buildings that are most present on the south side of the port. \n*Suburbs - The Neapolitan suburbs have always suffered from a bad reputation for being filled with trash, drug addicts, and having a low standard of living. The situation has improved a whole lot in recent years but there are still some that should be avoided like Ponticelli, which still has problems with garbage collection, Secondigliano which has a significant population of drug addicts, and the infamous Scampia, a very poor neighborhood often considered the most crime-ridden area in the city; don't go there at any time of day. Still, it is quite unlikely that you will end up in these areas or any areas outside the city center in fact, as there is very little to no interest for an average tourist."]}], "Nashville": [0.215398888991483, {"The cities should be known for Harry Potter film locations.": ["Nashville is quickly becoming a fun and enjoyable American city, and is drawing the most tourists from out of the country out of any city in the United States.

Settlements in Praia started in the 1615 which then became capital of the country in the year 1770. The city is located in the southern end of Santiago Island and has year round good weather. The city is divided into various small unofficial districts, the most important ones being, Plateau (city center), Achada Santo Antonio, Palmarejo, Fazenda, Achada Grande, Varzea, Safende, Sucupira(bazaar area), Calbeciera, Terra Branca, Vila Nova, Achadinha, Bairro, Prainha, Monte Vermelho, Achada Mato, Achada Sao Felipe, and other smaller ones. Most part of the city are residential areas, so probably not worth visiting in itself, but worth a half-day exploration if you are passing through to another destination.\n \nThe center of the city lies on a plateau overlooking the bay to the southeast. The airport lies a few kilometers to the northeast.\n \nGet in\n \nPraia has an international airport. TACV (national flag carrier) and TAP airlines fly to various destinations in Europe, Africa, South America and United States. Taxis from the airport to Plateau cost 800/1000. You can pay in Euros (10\u20ac to Praia in June 2016). There is one bus line that serves the airport but it\u2019s better to just take a taxi since there is actually only one or two buses that serves this line. You can also enter the city through the port. There are ferry boats that have irregular service to and from the islands of Maio, Boavista, Sal and Sao Nicolau, and more regular and scheduled service to and from Sao Vicente and Fogo. You can exchange money at hotel (1 \u20ac= 105 Escudos) or in the city (1 \u20ac= 110 \u20ac in June 2016).\n \nGet around\n \nThe city has countless bus stops, and taxis are everywhere waiting for customers. There are two main bus companies that serve the city, Moura Company and Sol Atlantico. Each route has their own numbers. The main lines are from Safende to Achada Santo Antonio, Vila Nova to Achada Santo Antonio, Calbeceira to Palmarejo, Pensamento to Terra Branca, Achada Grande to Achada Santo Antonio, Sao Felipe to Plateau, Ponta D'Agua to Plateau,Achada Mato to Palmarejo. Most of these lines pass by Plateau (city center), Varzea and Terra Branca, the bus fair is about 35 escudos. When it comes to taxis you should be careful with illegal taxis that sometimes roam around and might rip you off. The normal taxi fare between two furthest points of the city shouldn\u2019t be more 1500 escudos in daytime and 1800 escudos at night time, example Pensamento to Palmarejo, or Palmarejo to Achada Mato. Taxi drivers usually expect to get a tip, give around 50 escudos to 100 escudos. Just be careful and always drive with the taxis that have a taximeter, so that they don\u2019t overcharge you.\n \nThe city doesn\u2019t really have a good way to navigate because of the lack of an official map. This is because large part of the city doesn\u2019t have their names or house numbers yet. In the city center and in the more important parts of the city most streets have names and numbers. However, most people are friendly and will give you directions. Walking by foot between the different districts is not recommended, especially since most of the city's side walks are made out of loose cobblestone and is difficult to walk, also because the city is full of hills that can be tiring to walk.

Most crimes involve petty thievery and these are mostly focused on actual residents and not on tourists, although there have been a few cases which involved tourists. So Praia is still a very safe city, just be careful with flaunting any expensive jewelry or gadgets like iPhones and such. Cape Verde in the past few years has seen an increase of petty crimes which are done mostly by groups of young people so avoid groups of young men especially at night.\n \nPraia is also a badly illuminated city at night, so be careful in places that might not have street lights and is somewhat isolated, always travel in pairs or in groups for safety. However if anything does occur there are police stations in various parts of the city and a general hospital in the city center.\n \nThe stairs at the edge of Achada Santo Antonio towards Plateau are unsafe, also during the day, avoid that neighbourhood.\n \nAt night, take a taxi.\n \n \nCope\n \n \nEmbassies & Consulates\n \n* \n \n* \n \n* \n \n* \n \nGet out\n \n, the historic capital, is an easy half-day trip.\n \nYou can rent a car or ask for a full day tour (9 hours) for a round trip island."]}], "Presque Isle": [0.15725199234317863, {"The cities should be known for Harry Potter film locations.": ["Presque Isle is a city in the region of .", "* Presque Isle Historical Society & Museum, Provides walking tours of Presque Isle by request."]}], "Pretoria": [0.1946840960174084, {"The cities should be known for Harry Potter film locations.": ["* Johannesburg based company.

The factory buildings have been transformed into shops, restaurants, museums, movie theatres, and office spaces. Well worth visiting for anyone.\n*Founded in 1844, Tampella is the other major remaining historic factory complex in Tampere. Tampella factories started as ironworks, but later were converted into a cotton mill and a textile factory, and finally into a machine shop and a groundwood plant. Operated until 1991, Tampella factories manufactured, among others, water turbines, ships, paper machines, steam engines, trains, artillery, and airplane engines. Many of the beautiful original buildings remain and have been converted into theatres, museums, and office spaces.\n*A short 26-meter round stone tower dating back to 1920's stands on a natural vantage point of the Pyynikki ridge, the largest esker in the world. Despite its modest size, the tower offers a wonderful view spanning over the two major lakes and the entire city of Tampere. Downstairs there is a cafe that offers probably the best sugar-coated buns in the world. They are always out-of-oven fresh and hand-made on location. Around the tower, there is a popular jogging path in a forest with a couple of viewpoints on top of steep cliffs. Even though it is located just outside downtown, it's well within walking distance.\n* Old and well-preserved shot tower. Shot towers are nowadays quite rare throughout the world, especially ones that are in good shape.

Lots of fresh goods, cafes, cheap local eateries, and infinite people-watching opportunities.\n* In 1978 a competition was arranged for the design of a new main library. The jury unanimously chose the design by Raili and Reima Pietil\u00e4. The architects said they had been influenced by various elements, such as Celtic ornaments, sheep horns, and glacial spin formations. The basic idea was a space coiling spirally like the shell of a snail. The form of a bird appeared in the design process. Increasingly, the building began to resemble a large game bird, the capercaillie, known in Finnish as metso &mdash; now the building's nickname. Seen from above, the building looks like a bird carrying a shield.\n*A peaceful place to visit on a warm summer day. There is a cafe, art exhibitions, and a garden.

Look out for architectural details related to the Scaligeri (or della Scala) family, who ruled the city from the 12th to 14th Century: their family emblem is a ladder, which appears in many places around Verona (scala is Italian for 'ladder').\n* A large, spectacular Roman amphitheater, crumbling on the outside but still functioning today. It was erected in the 1st Century AD (c. 14-54CE) in an elliptical shape and is the world's third-largest amphitheater to survive from antiquity, and the eighth-largest amphitheater from Rome. Much of the outer ring was damaged during the earthquake of 1117 but the inner part is still intact. If you can, plan your trip during the Opera season and see a performance in the Arena. Besides the opera season, you can visit it during the day. A ticket to see the Arena when there are no events costs \u20ac10 for adults and can be bought at the front desk. Visitors have access to the arena itself, the stands, and the tunnels. A few informative texts are on display in one of the corridors in English and Italian.\n* Located slightly outside the centre. A 10-15 minute walk from the Castellvecchio, but well worth the walk, as it is possibly the richest in devotional artwork and historical preservation in Verona. The church is dedicated to Verona's patron saint, Zeno, a 4th-century North African and a keen fisherman who was ordained Bishop of Verona in 363. Zeno's tomb lies in an atmospheric shrine in the church undercroft, and he is also commemorated with a grinning medieval statue of Zeno in full episcopal robes, dangling a golden fish on the end of a fishing rod. The entrance to the church is graced with an ornate Romanesque fa\u00e7ade by Nicol\u00f2; like the cathedral, this church was erected after the earthquake of 1117. The church itself was a center of European pilgrimage for centuries; pilgrims were greeted by huge 10-meter frescoes of St Peter, the patron saint of pilgrims. Visitors across the centuries have left their mark - pilgrims happily inscribed graffiti in the frescoes, and signatures dating from 1390 survive to this day. There is also graffiti left by the invading Austrians in 1865.\n* Climb the steps up the hill above the Roman Amphitheatre to the Castell San Pietro. This former Austrian barracks dates back to the Austrian occupation of the left bank, and while the building is not open to the public, the views from the hill over Verona are spectacular. Go up in the early evening and enjoy a romantic sunset for free!\n* A 14th-century, red brick, fortified castle on the banks of the river Aldige. The main castle buildings house the city art museum which is packed with a rich collection of medieval sculpture and Renaissance paintings. As well as the museum, the extensive castle ramparts are great for exploring - ideal for families with children who enjoy running around castle fortifications. The Castelvecchio has an adjoining bridge over the river which is open all the time - walk over the bridge for some fantastic views of the castle on the river.\n* \n* Verona used to be a walled city, and during its history, there were three different city walls: the first from Roman times, and then from the 12th and 14th centuries (the latter renovated in the 16th century.) A few gates can be seen throughout the city. They are:\n** Located in Corso Porta Borsari, made of bricks for military purposes, probably during the 1st century, by the Romans.\n** Located at Via Porta Catena, Porta Fura is part of the ancient enclosure of the San Zeno monastery. The access is by a first courtyard separated from the second by the Austrian \"Blockhaus\" (1840); after which Porta Catena can be found.\n** Located in Via Leoni, it was erected in two stages, first during the 1st century, made of bricks, and then in the 2nd century, made of white stone.\n** The namesake of the train station, located in Corso Porta Nuova. It dates from the 16th century, and was also designed by Michele Sanmicheli, as a reconstruction of the Porta di Santa Croce.\n** Located in Stradone Porta Palio. It also dates from the 16th century and was designed by Michele Sanmicheli. There are three arches decorated with busts of war heroes.\n** Located in Piazzetta S. Giorgio, built in the 14th century (1321 - 1324), rebuilt in the 16th by Giovanni Maria Falconetto, but only completed in 1840 during the Austrian rule.\n** Located in Circonvallazione Maroncelli, designed by Michele Sanmicheli (notice the similarities with Porta Nuova) in the 16th century, named after the cathedral nearby.\n** Located in Vicolo Porta Vescovo, originally made in the 13th century, enlarged and renovated on the 16th and later by the Austrians.\n** Located on Lungadige Nicola Pasetto Deputato, built-in 1838 in order to defend the area between the bastion of Campus Martius and the left bank of the Adige. The gate was part of Fort Von Scholl, which was demolished.\n* One of Italy's most important renaissance/mannerist gardens, with grottoes, fire-breathing masks carved into the hillside etc.\n* Supposedly the location of the famous balcony love scene from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. The house is a major destination for tourist pilgrimage, as the tiny courtyard is normally packed with lovestruck teenagers photographing each other on the famous balcony. In fact, the house has no connection with Shakespeare's fictional characters - although the house is old, the balcony was added in 1936 and declared to be \"Juliet's house\" to attract tourists. You can visit the house itself - it contains a sparse collection of Renaissance frescoes rescued from other demolished palaces, and the bed from Zeffirelli's 1968 movie, but not a lot more. The balcony overlooks a tiny courtyard containing a statue of Juliet. There is an unbelievable amount of graffiti and general scrawling on the walls, floor, seats, and anything that will hold ink - there is a tradition of writing love messages to Juliet, and visitors leave notes, trinkets, and bits of chewing gum fashioned into love hearts. Juliet's house is a popular romantic shrine, but its popularity belies its value; compared to some of the treasures around Verona, Juliet's house has very little to offer. So, if Juliet lived here, what about Romeo? A couple of streets away the house at 4, Via Arche Scaligere has been designated as his home. It is private, so other than a sign on the wall there is nothing much to see.\n* at the Capuchin Church, which also houses the Antonian Fresco Museum.\n* Completed in 1463, this is the tallest of Verona's towers. The unmistakable clock tower looms over the Piazza delle Erbe, and you enter via the palace courtyard. Although there are 238 steps to the top, there is a lift! Views from the top are breathtaking.\n* Sant' Anastasia, San Lorenzo Maggiore and San Fermo Maggiore\n* Home of the Forum in Roman times this is still a focal point of the city.

It is also the seat of the Archaeological Museum.\n* A tiny chapel immediately next to San'Anastasia. Easily overlooked, this church s richly decorated with early Renaissance frescoes depicting the walled garden of the Virgin Mary.\n* was built to replace an 8th-century church which was destroyed in the earthquake of 1117. Consecrated in 1187, the church features an ornate marble Romanesque fa\u00e7ade by the Veronese architect Nicol\u00f2; its pillars are supported by two griffins. Stone reliefs around the door include Biblical scenes. The smaller side door is also worth a look - medieval carvings include Jonah being swallowed by a whale. Inside, the nave has many Gothic alterations, and oil paintings around the side chapels include an Assumption by Tiziano. The Romanesque baptistery adjoining the chapel of Sant'Elena is preserved, with its exquisite marble font and collection of medieval paintings.", "Buy\n* Featuring old style furniture, this delicatessen food shop has a wide range of local and Italian salami, cheeses, canned and dry foods.

This and a few other nearby hills mark the site of the original irregular \"Y\" shape citadel with perimeter defense fortification. River Vilnia below in the west was an additional natural obstacle. Dwellers lived further east. Deep ravines between the hills reflect the position of the former unpaved streets which was the cause of the ensuing massive erosion. The Crooked Castle was besieged in 4-16 Sept 1390, broken in using the Welsh Cat technique and burned down by the Prussian-Livonian army, with the help of French and English mercenaries. It was a conflict between two Lithuanian monarchs: Grand Duke Vytautas allied with the Teutonic Knights against his cousin Jagie\u0142\u0142o, who by that time became the King of Poland.\n*Reserve was established in 1997 to preserve historical, spiritual and cultural center of the state.

The latter now has several hills and many ditches, which before erosion were the steep strong and fortified banks of the Vilnius River, the first original place in Vilnius.\n*It is a city area which began to develop extensively around the Middle Ages and it eventually became surrounded by a defensive wall after some time. The wall has long been distinguished by a solid environment and form, but now this area is called the Old Town and has a separate status in the administrative division of Vilnius. While the urban structure reflects the earliest development from the 14th century, the architecture of the buildings is mostly from the Baroque and Classicism periods with some examples of Renaissance and Gothic, to a lesser extent. One should keep in mind that medieval Vilnius was once a wooden city. The huge fires ravaged Vilnius several times from 1513 to 1749. Therefore, many buildings of the 19th and 20th centuries (still considered new) have Gothic and Renaissance cellars, many of which now are occupied with restaurants, bars, or shops. One particular nice area is a block of artisan guilds that is notorious because of its evil fate of 6 September 1941 when the two Jewish ghettos, commonly known as Vilnius Ghetto, were established. The ghetto operated until 24&nbsp;Sept&nbsp;1943.

In the 18th century the building was enlarged and became the Governor-General's residence. It was visited by Tsar Alexander I of Russia, King Louis XVIII of France, and Napoleon. Since Lithuania's independence in 1991, the palace has served as the official residence of the President of Lithuania. If the Standard (a dark red flag with the country's coat of arms) is flying over the palace, the President is at home. The Changing of the Guard takes place daily at 18:00. However, if you want to see traditional pageantry, then go to the palace on Sundays at noon and watch the soldiers take part in a flag-raising ceremony, wearing ceremonial uniforms and medieval armoury. Tours of the palace are by appointment only.\n*Reconstructed early Baroque style Royal Residence has 2 exhibition tour routes related to the historical functions of this palace: the 1st one shows its historical and architectural development, the 2nd route brings you into the ceremonial halls and the special Treasury Hall.\n*Small artworks, dedications mounted on the walls of the street.

Houses an exposition of archaeological findings and other exhibits. The national flag was first raised on its top in 1919 when the country regained independence from Russia. Since then the tower is an important state and historic symbol of Vilnius and of Lithuania itself. Visitors can ascend the mountain by a historic path and a lift from the inner courtyard of the Old Arsenal.\n*Central building of the Old Town. The first Gothic style Town Hall was built in 1432 in the very same place as it is today. It was reconstructed several times until the city clock tower collapsed and damaged the significant part of the main building. The new Classical style building was completed in 1799 and so remains to date. Since 2001 it operates as a public institution, organizes representative and protocol events, various ceremonies, celebrations of public holidays, overall about 300 cultural and educational events are held every year.\n*Erected on a top of a large hill-fort in the 9th\u201314th centuries by Dukes of Lithuania. Approximately at the very end of the 13th century, the Seat due to strategic reasons was transferred from Trakai to Vilnius and the castle was substantially reconstructed. The first castles were wooden, and only in the beginning of 15th century everything was rebuilt in brick and stone. The preserved ruins of Gothic Ducal Palace and surrounding fortifications remain to date. The top of the largest and the only survived tower of the defensive wall offers the best view of Vilnius.\n*Part of the Old Town, a largely unrestored area primarily occupied by artists, dreamers, squatters, and drunks. In 1998, the residents unofficially declared the area to be an independent republic, with its own president, anthem, flag, and constitution. Great to visit on April Fools day, when mock border guards stamp passports and the entire area erupts into a party.\n*Catholic Cathedral. An original wooden Cathedral was built here in 1251 on a site of the pagan temple. Later, in 1387, a Gothic-style cathedral was built. Now it is a Classical style cathedral built-in 1783-1801 including various forms of previous centuries chapels into a coherent whole so that the most beautiful Baroque chapel of Saint Casimir (originally built in 1623\u20131636) remained untouched. There were 27 crypts of different depths and sizes under the Cathedral floor.

A visit to Wellington is not complete without checking out Wellingtons most popular lookout, offering stunning views across the city and harbour.\n*Red Rocks/ Seal Colony. This is an interesting walk named for its distinctive red rocks (probably Jasper). Take the number 1 bus to the end (Island Bay). Walk across the park towards the ocean and hang a right. There is another bus, number 4, that goes to the end of the road but only at certain times. Travel west (right side, if facing the water) until you run out of road. Here you will find a disused quarry and a visitors center (open daily from 10am - 6pm, later in summer). The walk along this beach is pleasant but rocky and often very windy, so dress accordingly. The road is shared (except Sundays) with 4WDs and other motor traffic. If one walks for about 1 hour you will come across a distinctive pass though the rock face. Just on the other side of this is a seal colony (in May-October)that is worth the walk. Please bear in mind that these are wild animals and so require a certain level of respect, so keep your distance and do not get between them and the sea, especially if you value your health!

However the entry fee for the boardwalk alone is 2000 kyats or $US2 (in February 2018 most of the boardwalk was closed for renovations and no fee was payable for the remaining sections). It is cheaper to walk along the road footpath (sidewalk) with free view from the outside looking through the fenced park. Caution: If intending to go to the boardwalk, be careful where you are entering because a wrong entry means money down the drain that should have been allotted to a more noble purpose such as donating to a beggar. To go to the lake itself, you have to be ready to cough out the amount stated above to be paid at the entrance located in the middle of the south side road. But if your real intention is to get close to the Karaweik, the entrance is on the southeast corner and there is a separate charge. The charge to the Karaweik is 300 kyats.

This is the heart of Yerevan and indeed Armenia. Though Kentron's architecture is diverse, ranging from Belle Epoque to Soviet Panel blocks, the great majority of the centre is in Beaux-Arts tradition. Downtown Yerevan follows Tamanyan's plan for a circular city with two hubs - grand Republic Square, and the more elegant and soft Opera district (Opera house, Freedom Square and the Swan Lake Park). The two are linked with newly-constructed pedestrian-only Northern Avenue. The Main Avenue (standard South European Corso) is still under construction (for the last 60 years, although on a greater scale during the last couple of years) and will eventually reach the hill on which the historical Kond district rests.
