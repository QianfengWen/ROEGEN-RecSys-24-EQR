Don't expect big, crazy headliners, though - the organizers of the festival have said time and time again that they bring in acts that A) They can afford and B) Will make the majority of the attendees happy. Some nights can get a little rowdy, as this is the south and beer certainly is popular, but the local Sheriff's Department and Police Department bring out their finest to keep things safe. For fans of the blues, be sure to check out the Bessie Smith Strut, which features great blues artists and the town's finest BBQ."

These German immigrants built a culture based off of beer gardens, beer brewing, dance and music halls giving Cincinnati a very distinct and vibrant local culture. Unfortunately very little remains from this era due to the double whammy of World War I anti-German backlash and prohibition combined with massive depopulation of the city's core in the mid 20th Century. Lately, with the beginnings of revitalization of the Downtown Basin neighborhoods, there has been a renewed interest in this heritage and some of it can be seen to this day in faded German signs on densely built ornate Victorian buildings in Over-The-Rhine, a high per-capita number of bars, and the celebration of large German festivals such Bockfest, Mayfest, and Oktoberfest.",

                "For thousands of years there have been human activities on Haugalandet, and the region is covered in traces of these people. Visit one of the many exciting, historic destinations!\n \n*St. Olav's Church King H\u00e5kon H\u00e5konsson erected the St. Olav\u2019s Church around 1250 AD as part of the royal farm on Avaldsnes. Next to the church stands one of Norway\u2019s tallest pillars, \u201cJomfru Marias syn\u00e5l\u201d (Virgin Mary\u2019s Sewing Needle). According to the legend when the pillar touches the church wall it means the end of the world. That is why the priests through the years have chipped off parts of the top. St. Olav\u2019s Church is situated on Avaldsnes, approximately 10 minutes by car south of Haugesund.\n \n*Nordvegen History Centre At Nordvegen History Centre king Harald Fairhair invites us in to walk in the footsteps of our ancestors. He is our guide through a 3500 year long history about Avaldsnes as a meeting spot between Norway and Europe, and as a national and, at times, international centre of power. The Viking king presents some of the kings who have controlled the Norwegian coast from Avaldsnes. Some of these kings are known through archaeological findings, and some through tales. The history centre is situated adjacent to St. Olav\u2019s Church.\n \n*The Viking farm at Avaldsnes The Viking farm at Bukk\u00f8y is a reconstructed farm at Avaldsnes. The museum provides knowledge about the lives of our ancestors. In the museum courtyard you will find a traditional longhouse as well as smaller dwellings, a Viking boat and plants and animals. During the summer people are dressed in Viking clothes as they display the Vikings\u2019 way of life. You get here by walking from St. Olav\u2019s Church, through the open beautiful landscape before getting to the tree-covered island.\n \n*Haraldshaugen Just north of downtown Haugesund you will find Haraldshaugen, a testimony to the fact that although the city is young, the area has been known and used for thousands of years. Haraldshaugen consists of four important monuments in Norwegian history; the burial mound, the stone cross, the church site, and the National Monument (Haraldsst\u00f8tta). The latter was unveiled in 1872 in commemoration of Harald Fairhair\u2019s gathering of Norway into one kingdom. The legend goes that he was buried here.\n \n*Archaeological excavations The ground and sound at the old royal farm at Avaldsnes still hold secrets that can give us new knowledge about Norwegian and international history. Excavations have led to the discovery of traces of old buildings close to St. Olav\u2019s Church. These findings might even prove to be remains of Harald Fairhair\u2019s court, which he set up here following the battle of Hafrsfjord. Projects are in place to excavate more of the area in order to find out more about these important and exciting findings.\n \n*St\u00f8dle St\u00f8dle, in the municipality of Etne, is another important historical area in Haugalandet. During parts of the Middle Ages, St\u00f8dle was the main seat of power in Norway. From here king Magnus Erlingsson ruled Norway at the end of the 12th century. His father, earl Erling Skakke, built a chapel at the royal farm. The chapel dates back to 1160 and today it is part of the current St\u00f8dle church. At St\u00f8dle you will also find remnants of the Bronze Ages. St\u00f8dle is situated about one hour by car east of Haugesund.\n \n*Rehaugene At the top of Karm\u00f8y, six imposing earthen burial mounds, which dominate the landscape, were built during the Bronze Age (1800 \u2013 500 BC). There used to be many more burial mounds here, however, only six remain, and they are called the pyramids of the north. They were built as the final resting place for the powerful chiefs that lived at Avaldsnes. These burial mounds show that 3000 years ago Norway traded with communities as far away as Russia, Ireland and the Mediterranean.\n \n*Flagghaugen Flagghaugen is a burial mound dating back to the third century AD. It is situated just north of St. Olavs Church. Originally it was 43 meters in diameter and 5 meters high. The remaining parts can be seen just outside of the stone fence surrounding the church. A prince was buried here, and in the grave the richest gold finds from any grave in Scandinavia from the Later Roman Iron Age was found. Among the findings was a massive necklace made of 590 grams of pure gold. The prince is presented at the Nordvegen History Centre close by.\n \n*Ryvarden The Icelandic Book of Settlement, Landn\u00e1ma, says that Fl\u00f2ke Vilgjerdson build a beacon at Ryvarden in 868 before he sailed to Iceland. He was the first man to sail to Iceland with the purpose of settling there, and he is also the one who gave Iceland its name. The story goes that he used three ravens to show him the way, hence the name he is now known by; Ravnafloke (Raven-Floke). The first Viking raid is also said to have originated from Ryvarden. There is a small museum at Ryvarden telling the story of Ravnafloke. Of course, the highlight of a trip to Ryvarden is simply taking in the breathtaking scenery.\n \n*The Viking Centre The Viking Settlement at Avaldsnes is copy of a Viking settlement, complete with a longhouse and all the requisites, has been reconstructed, just below the Church of Olav in Avaldsnes.\n*Near to Karm\u00f8y, this is the ancient hole dating back to 972 in which irritating Swedes were thrown to be mauled by bears. The pracitce eventually deterred Swedes from passing through, although some credit this to the nearby 'Bird Cage'.",
                "Drink\nThere are several pubs and clubs in Haugesund. However like the rest of Norway these places only come alive on the weekend and late at night, in many cases after 22:00, most have pretty good live music and cater to all ages, the big drawback is the crippling price of alcohol, $11 dollars for Guinness, $10 for local lagers, and up to $20 for spirit and mixer. The staff are usually very friendly and all speak good English, in fact many staff speak 2-3 languages.\n*Located on the waterfront, Sam Son's chic decor provides an excellent place to relax in the afternoon or party all night. They offer food, beer, wine and cocktails. It is also worth trying one of their smoothies.\n*Provides a warm atmosphere during day and into the evening. Drop in for a drink, coffee or a meal.

Originally a north European pagan carnival, Vappu is an excuse for students to wear brightly colored overalls and for everybody to drink vast amounts of alcohol. At 6PM on Apr 30, the statue of Havis Amanda at the Market Square is crowned with a student's cap and the revelry begins in the streets. Things can get a little ugly outside as the night wears on, so it's wiser to head indoors to the bars, clubs and restaurants, all of which have massive Vappu parties. The following morning, the party heads to the Kaivopuisto park for a champagne picnic, regardless of the weather. If the weather is good, up to 70,000 people will show up.

                ":Also of interest to the curious traveller, especially for those looking for scenic photographic opportunities or a short walk through an authentic neighborhood, are the parts of the city that surround the Mevlana Museum. Since this neighborhood hasn't quite kept up with recent times, it still maintains an authentic feel from older days with narrow streets and houses of old architecture, almost with historic significance.",
                "* The open-air caf\u00e9 at Alaaddin Tepesi is good for relief and some shade while watching the city during a summer day.\n* Mevlevi sofras\u0131 is one of the best places which has a panoramic view of Mevlana museum and Gulbahcesi. You can have a drink with traditional desserts.\n*Hotels: pretty much all of them have alcohol. If you're really desperate, though, head to Migros. There's one near the Bosna Hersek tramvay station. Simply cross the pedestrian bridge across from Mevlana University and you'll see it (Bosna Hersek Mah. Mesaj Cd 38/A-B, Bosna). At this particular one, the alcohol section is so busy that they've had to hire a full time guard simply to watch that one section of the store - no joke. There's another Migros in Meram, also fully stocked with booze (\u015eeyh Sadrettin Mah. Ferit Pa\u015fa Cd 12/A, Meram Merkez). There are also fully stocked liquor stores located throughout the city - one of the more easily reachable is in the alley off the main road between the Alaaddin and Zafer tram stations. A second one is off of the Kule tram station. Coming from the city center, get off at Kule tram station and take a right. Walk a few hundred meters until the next main road. Take a left there and you'll see it on your left after a couple hundred meters. A third option is to just look for signs saying \"Efes\" while in the downtown. Contrary to what most people think, most Konyan men are fairly familiar with the bottle and a significant amount of women regularly imbibe, but doing so in public is illegal and announcing it isn't a good idea as a fairly large amount of Konyans like to appear conservative. Like most parts of Turkey and the Arab world, do what you like, but don't broadcast it to the world.",
                "* Kule Site shopping center. \n* Kent Plaza shopping center. You can also shop in the small streets of Konya where you can find a lot of clothes and presents for a low price.\n* Alaattin Tepesi Go chill there.\n* Have a cup of coffee at Meram (Aydincavus), with a sight of Konya from above.\n* Fuar (the funfair).\n* Visit Kapu Mosque and Aziziye Mosque, each with different styles of minarets (towers).\n* \n* Highly recommended! A sema (whirling dervish ceremony) is held at the Mevlana Cultural Centre every Saturday at 7pm (current as of Dec 2019) taking one and a half hours. You don't need to arrange tickets in advance, but you might want to ask at the Tourist Information Center right behind the Mevlana Museum in case there have been changes. The hall is very big so there will almost certainly be free seats, doors open at 6:30 if you\u2019d like to get right up the front. The ceremony begins with a long introduction in Turkish before the actual music and ceremony start. People say this is the closest you can get to a real sema. No flash photography or applauding during the ceremony (so as not to disturb the dervishes)."

                "See\n* Market - a circular street around the Jokhang Temple in the center of the old section of Lhasa, it is the oldest street in a very traditional style in Tibet, where you can enjoy bargaining with the local Tibetan vendors for the handicrafts which are rare to be seen elsewhere in the world. Barkhor Street is one of the most important religious paths along which pilgrims walk around Jokhang Temple while turning prayer wheels in their hands through centuries. Buddhist pilgrims walk or progress by body-lengths along the street clockwise every day into deep night. For your first visit to the Barkhor, enter from Barkhor Sq, a large plaza that was cleared in 1985. The square has become a focus for political protest and pitched battles between Chinese and Tibetans on several occasions, notably in 1998 (when a Dutch tourist was shot in the shoulder) and most recently in 2008.\n* (Tsuglagkhang) - constructed in the 7th century AD to house the statues of Buddha that princesses Bhrikuti from Nepal and Wen Cheng from Tang Dynasty China brought as gifts for their future husband, King Songtsan Gampo. The temple has been enlarged many times over the centuries and now also houses statues of King Songtsan Gambo and his two famous foreign brides. However, the original statue of Jowo Sakyamuni Buddha that Princess Wen Cheng brought from Chang\u2019an over 1300 years ago is definitely its most sacred and famous possession, and is perhaps the most venerated religious artifact in all of Tibet. The temple, a splendid four-floor building facing west under a guilded rooftop, is on Barkhor Square in the center of the old section of Lhasa.\n* (Phodrang Potala) - A stronghold probably existed on Red Hill as early as the 7th century AD when King Songtsen Gyalpo built a fortress on it for his two foreign wives. The palace was rebuilt by the Fifth Dalai Lama in three years, while the Thirteenth Dalai Lama extended and repaired it into what it is now. It became winter palace in 1755 when the Seventh Dalai Lama made the Norbulinka into a summer residence. With over 1 000 rooms, the Potala contained the living quarters of the Dalai Lamas while they lived, and their sumptuous golden tombs when they died. As the religious and political centre of old Tibet and the winter residence of Dalai Lamas, the palace witnessed the life of the Dalai Lamas and the important political and religious activities in the past centuries. Potala Palace also houses great amounts of rare cultural relics including the gold hand-written Buddhist scriptures, valuable gifts from the Chinese emperors and a lot of priceless antiques. Admission &yen;100. Guided palace tours generally include one hour inside the palace; allow at least that much time to walk up and down the many steps leading up to and from the palace. The palace is 14 stories tall and any visit involves climbing a lot of stairs up/down. Make sure you are fully acclimated before visiting. The Potala was included in the in 1994, the Jokhang Temple Monastery in 2000 and the Norbulingka Summer Palace in 2001.\n* Drepung Monastery - founded in 1416 by a disciple of Tsong Khapa, was the biggest and richest monastery in Tibet and its lamas helped to train each new young Dalai Lama. Drepung was also home to the Nechung, the state oracle. At its height, Drepung had over 10 000 monks, and governed 700 subsidiary monasteries and owned vast estates. Drepung belongs to the Gelupa sect. Monastery is about 10 km to west from old city of Lhasa, there is public bus #17, #24 and others for Y1 RMB. bus #24 goes from Drepung to Sera and back. Enterance fee to monastery is Y50 RMB (2015). It takes about half day to explore monastery. Take water and snack with you. In front of monastery (ticket office) are some small restaurants.\n* Norbulingka Summer Palace - located about 1km west of the Potala Palace - The Seventh Dalai Lama constructed the first summer palace in 1755 and each successive ruler added his own buildings. Norbulingka is now undergoing complete restoration. Presently, the complex contains a small zoo, botanical gardens, and a mansion. Enterance fee is Y60 RMB (2015).\n* Ramoche Temple. Ramoche and Johkang Temple were completed about the same time. Tradition says that it was built originally to house the much revered Jowo Rinpoche statue, which was carried to Lhasa via Lhagang in a wooden cart and brought to Tibet when Princess Wen Cheng came to Lhasa. Unlike the Jokhang, Ramoche was originally built in Chinese style. During Mangsong Mangtsen's reign (649-676), because of a threat that the Tang Chinese might invade, Princess Wen Cheng is said to have had the statue of Jowo Rinpoche hidden in a secret chamber in the Jokhang. Princess Jincheng, sometime after 710 AD, had it placed in the central chapel of the Jokhang. It was replaced at Ramoche by a statue of Jowo Mikyo Dorje, a small bronze statue of the Buddha when he was eight years old. The statue was crafted by Vishvakarman and brought to Lhasa by the Nepalese queen, Bhrikuti. It is said to have been badly damaged by the Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution. The Ramoche Temple was badly damaged during the Mongol invasions and there is no certainty that the statue which was remained in 1959 was the original one. The original temple was destroyed by fire, and the present three-storied building was constructed in 1474. Soon after it became the Assembly Hall of the Gyuto Tratsang, or Upper Tantric College of Lhasa and was home to 500 monks. There was a close connection with Yerpa which provided summer quarters for the monks. One of the temple's prized artifacts is the life-sized statue of the 12-year-old Sakyamuni. The Wencheng Princess brought it from the capital Chang'an during the Tang Dynasty. As one of the precious cultural relics of Tibet, the statue is now placed in Jokhang Temple, 500 meters (0.31mile) south of Ramoche Monastery. Residing within the Ramoche Monastery is the life-sized statue of the 8-year-old Sakyamuni. Carried into Tibet by the Nepalese Chizun Princess, this figure is regarded as the greatest saint in Ramoche Monastery. Nowadays, the temple has become the very place for the Tibetan monks to study the Mi Zong (one of the sects of Buddhism). However, Ramoche receives as not as many tourists than its sister Jokhang Temple, Its still deserve a visit to travellers travel to Lhasa for its unique culture and unique culture and the status of Buddhism in Tibet.\n* Sera Monastery - founded in 1419 by one of Tsong Khapa\u2019s (the founder of the Gelupa sect) eight disciples. It became famous for its tantric teachings, while Drepung drew fame from its governing role. Sera was smaller than Drepung, with 7,000 monks, but was very rich and comparable in power. The monks of Sera were considered clever and dangerous. Monastery is about 5 km to north from downtown, there is public bus #6, #16, #24 and others for Y1 RMB. bus #24 goes from Drepung to Sera and back. Enterance fee is Y50 RMB (2015). It takes about 3 hours to walk around monastery. About 10 meters before ticket office is small road to right side, from here you can get into monastery without buing a ticket.\n* Tibet Museum Minzulu Road, Lhasa. Admission &yen;25.

The same ritual was then repeated every year. In the last decade or so, the celebration turned into an international event, with light shows by professional artists from all over the world.

                "* M\u00fcnchner Sommernachtstraum The Munich Midsummer Night's Dream is a music festival with fireworks that takes place in July. \n* &mdash; The first Oktoberfest took place on the 12 October 1810, to celebrate the marriage of Prince Ludwig of Bavaria and Princess Therese of Sachsen-Hildburghausen. All citizens of Munich were invited to a meadow (Wiesn) situated in front of the city tower, subsequently renamed the Theresienwiese in honor of the bride. In the early years of the fair, horse races were held, then as the event grew, an agricultural convention, which still takes place every fourth year, was added to the program. In 1896, businessmen working with the breweries in Munich built the first giant beer tents at Oktoberfest, and beer drinking has been the primary focus ever since. Today, the Oktoberfest is the best-known beer festival around the world and has been replicated on all continents. In 2011, the Oktoberfest hosted 6.9 million visitors from around the world who drank 7.5 million liters of beer and ate the equivalent of 118 boxes and 522,821 roasted chickens. At the center of the spectacle are 14 large beer tents, which are set up along the Wirtsbudenstrasse in the northern part of Theresienwiese. These have a seating capacity of up to 8,500 inside the tent and add hundreds or thousands of seats in the adjacent beer gardens. Here only beer of the 6 major Munich breweries (Augustiner, Hacker-Pschorr, Hofbr\u00e4u, L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u, Paulaner, Spaten-Franziskaner) is sold. The tents in alphabetical order are: \n 1. Armbrustsch\u00fctzen-Festhalle (Paulaner beer, here a crossbow shooting competition is held each year)\n 2. Augustiner-Festhalle (Augustiner beer, here the beer is still drafted from the traditional wooden barrels)\n 3. Br\u00e4urosl (Hacker-Pschorr beer)\n 4. Fischer-Vroni (Augustiner beer, the specialty is grilled fish)\n 5. Hacker-Festzelt (Hacker-Pschorr beer)\n 6. Marstall (Spaten-Franziskaner beer)\n 7. Hofbr\u00e4u-Festzelt (Hofbr\u00e4u beer, probably the most touristy among the tents)\n 8. K\u00e4fer's Wies'n-Sch\u00e4nke (Paulaner beer, meeting point of the celebrities)\n 9. L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u-Festhalle (L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u beer, known for the roaring lion above the main entrance)\n10. Ochsenbraterei (Spaten-Franziskaner beer, here whole oxes are grilled)\n11. Schottenhamel (Spaten-Franziskaner beer, location of traditional tapping of the first barrel by the Munich mayor)\n12. Sch\u00fctzen-Festzelt (L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u beer)\n13. Weinzelt (the tent for those who prefer wine and champagne)\n14. Winzerer F\u00e4hndl (Paulaner beer) \nEspecially on weekends, you should try to get in the tents before 10AM. During the week, most tents are open all day, however, it is not easy to get a seat if you are a larger group. It is a general rule that you will not get served if you do not have a seat. The exception is the Hofbr\u00e4u Festzeltwhere beer is also served in a standing area. It is not recommended to leave the tent if you want to get in it later since it might be crowded by that time. There are also smaller beer tents, which also offer beer, Bavarian food, and Oktoberfest music and it might be possible to still get a seat there when the large tents are already full. However, the Oktoberfest has more to offer than the parties inside the beer tents. In the Schaustellerstrasse you can ride numerous roller coasters - assuming you are still able to do so after enjoying the Munich beer. Finally a few general hints:\n** Accommodation will be hard to find and prices can easily double during Oktoberfest. \n** Smoking is not allowed in the tents, but some tents feature designated outdoor smoking areas. Think twice if you want leave a tent for smoking since you may not get in again.\n** The closest underground station \"Theresienwiese\" (underground lines U4 and U5) is very crowded and will sometimes be closed because of this. As an alternative, go to the underground station \"Goetheplatz\" (lines U3 and U6). It's crowded too, but you will still have some air to breathe there. Just follow the crowd when you get out of the station.\n** In most beer tents the bar closes at 10:30pm while the tent closes at 11:30pm. You should have finished your beer before then since the security will ruthlessly clear the area.\n** Tents open at 10am usually (9am on weekends). The first day is tapping day (german \"Anstich\"). There is no beer served before noon and since the tents will surely be crowded by then, it will take some time until everyone is served.\n** If you are with small children, try to avoid the weekends. Every Tuesday from 12 to 6pm is a family day with discounts on many rides.\n** Do not steal the 1-liter beer glasses. They might seem like a great souvenir, but bags are checked and everyone trying to steal a beer glass will be handed over to the police. If you really want one of these glasses, you can buy them for a few Euros.\n** Stay out of fights - the police will arrest you and if you are crazy enough to hit and injure someone with a beer stein you will get charged with attempted manslaughter!\n* St. Patrick's Day Munich Parade of Irish and Scottish unions that attracts 30.000 visitors and is the largest Irish event east of Dublin.\n* Theatron Festivals Two further music festivals in Munich, the Theatron Pfingstfestival during Whitsun and the Musiksommer in August.\n* Tollwood &mdash; In summer this alternative festival takes place in the Olympic Park, in winter on Theresienwiese (the Oktoberfest area). These 3-week festivals combine ethnic food, craft and souvenir shops, concerts, and theater performances. They are very popular among the locals and worth a visit if you want to see a lesser-known side of Munich.\n* Zamanand Festival &mdash; Twice a year for a weekend, Zamanand Festival takes place between Odeonsplatz and Siegestor, when the monumental Ludwigstra\u00dfe ist closed down for traffic. With its core programmatic themes, sustainablity and social cohesion, its eight cultural stages with a diverse programme, the festival attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors each year."

Spectators too jostle for viewing spots, but you can choose to pay to watch from the temporary spectator grandstand. The festival originated in the 16th century when people would request special talismans thrown out by priests. As word spread that the talismans were bringing those who possessed them good luck, more and more people came to get them, fights broke out and the talismans were damaged. Later this all evolved into a midnight festival with only male participants dressed in loincloths. Today, the fesival continues to evolve, with the \"midnight\" highlight of the festival recently moved forward 2 hours to finish at 10PM."

                "Understand\nWhen people think of Orlando, most think of theme parks and a vast urban sprawl. However, the city proper contains only Universal Studios. None of the other major theme parks (Disney World, Sea World), dinner attractions (such as Medieval Times), and most small theme parks (Gatorland, Holyland Experience, Ripley's Believe-it-or-not, etc) are in other cities or counties. However, since Orlando is the larger city associated with most of these popular attractions, you will find details and descriptions of them below.\n \nClimate\nMost tourists visit Orlando between June and August, while another peak time for tourism is March and April. Ironically, the less busy times for tourism correspond to the best weather in the Orlando area; the summer months can be exceptionally busy with families who are making a trip while kids are on summer vacation. Visiting when the weather isn't so hot means less people in the area and that provides some advantages, but you will be able to enjoy cooler weather. The climate of Orlando is subtropical, and therefore is very humid (the heat index typically exceeds 100 degrees). Afternoon thunderstorms are expected in the warmer months, although they can occur in any month.",

                "* This park together with the Vigeland Sculpture Park is a large green area about 10 minutes by subway from the city center. In addition to being a nice green recreational area, it is also decorated with hundreds of sculptures by the Norwegian artist Gustav Vigeland. There is a wonderfully relaxed atmosphere here, although the sculptures are a little depressing. If your children want to climb the statues, nobody will even bother to look twice at you. Between June and August Frognerparken is one of the main places the young in Oslo meet during the daytime to barbecue and sunbathe. Buy an \"engangsgrill\", a pack of sausages, and a couple of beers and you'll fit right in. Neither using the barbecue nor drinking in public is completely legal, but as long as you sit among others and don't get rowdy, you will have no trouble. There is also a cafeteria, and two museums, the City Museum of Oslo and the Vigeland Museum. If you fancy an outdoor swim, Frognerbadet is situated next to the Frognerpark with 3 pools, several diving towers, and a water slide.\n* It is situated in the Gr\u00fcnerl\u00f8kka, a so-called Greenwich village look-alike area. The park's name was received from the military leader in the 19th century.\n* Small, with an assortment of nonvenomous snakes, some venomous spiders, lizards, frogs, beetles, two small monkeys and a Cayman.\n* From the north of the city center towards of Ullev\u00e5lsveien are the graves of Edvard Munch and Henrik Ibsen, two important cultural figures in Norway's history. It is also the burial site of a host of reputed Norwegian individuals and families.\n* It surrounds the Royal Palace at the top of Karl Johan Street. Oslo's most central park is a pleasant grass-covered area with majestic old trees. Wide walkways crisscross the park.\n* The park is known for its elegant apartment buildings with mature trees and hilltop views across Oslo and the fjord. It is a delightful public park on the highest hill in central Oslo. Great view of the city and surroundings. 1000 meters easy walk from Karl Johan Street along Akersgata-Ullev\u00e5lsveien past V\u00e5r Frelsers Gravlund (cemetery). The park has also given name to this popular neighborhood as well as to the larger administrative district (borough) that includes major parts of central Oslo.\n* This charming park has an old church and a caf\u00e9 on the top and is your best bet if St. Hanshaugen is too crowded (only a few minutes walk away).\n \nDo\n* A local guide takes you along all of Oslo\u2019s highlights. In a few hours, you will get familiar with the city and afterward, you could rent a bike and explore the city on your own.\n* \n* Hoved\u00f8ya, Gressholmen, or Lang\u00f8yene are wonderful places to spend a sunny day. There is also a bathing bus (number 87) running from mid-June to mid-August from Jernbanetorvet to the brilliant beaches of Hvervenbukta, Bestemorstranda, and Ingierstrand. Ingierstrand is a 1930s bathing resort with very special functionalist architecture. Also at Bygd\u00f8y, Snar\u00f8ya, and further out towards Asker, you will find several great beaches. During the summer months, the water temperature will, perhaps surprisingly for many foreigners, be very pleasant and beaches will be packed. Outdoor swimming pools can be found at Frognerparken and T\u00f8yenbadet.\n* Discover the city and its major tourist sites by bike, from April through October.\n* Be sure to check their event calendar, every week they have concerts with a variety of international and Norwegian bands and/or DJs. Each Sunday there is a free jazz/blues/soul concert. Walk up the river from the center and you'll find it. Old factory-style houses with lots of graffiti.\n* Explore Oslo with a historic vessel or spend a summer evening in the Oslo Fjord.\n* Kayaking & packrafting tours, courses, and paddleboarding. Also, Mad Goats are available to introduce the floating saunas.\n* The area around Holmenkollen (T-bane 1) is well suited for cross-country skiing, but also a nice area for hiking during summertime. While you are there, you can also visit the ski museum which is located close to the ski jump.\n* Silent Oslo Fjordcruise, Oslo Dinner Cruise, Brunch & Bubbles, Morning Yoga Cruise and Electric afterwork.\n* Akerselva is considered clean north of Nydalen. The best spot may be at Frysja (bus 22-25-54 to Stillatorget). Don't forget that many of the lakes in \"Oslomarka\" are for swimming and recreation, but a couple of the major lakes (Maridalsvannet in particular) are drinking water for the city. Buy a map and bring your swimming gear!\n* \n* \n* Nice gateways to the beautiful nature are T-bane to Frognerseteren (line 1), Sognsvann (line 6), Roms\u00e5s (line 5), Bogerud (line 3), Skullerud (line 3) or Ellingsrud\u00e5sen (line 2), or the train to Movatn or Snippen (local trains towards Hakadal, Roa, Jaren and Gj\u00f8vik). Also, bus 56 from Storo (tram 11, 12, 13 and T-bane) to Solemskogen or bus 51 from Nydalen (bus 37, T-bane 4, 5 and 6) to Maridalen offer fantastic possibilities for walks and rural life, everything less than half an hour from the city center. Bring something to drink and a chocolate bar (and do a bit of planning, buses 51 and 56 and the train seldom run more than once every half hour, less on weekends). Be prepared for some muddy sections of the trail as they take you through some pretty thickly wooded areas. The forest is dense enough that any damp areas of the trail don't dry out. This isn't helped by the multitude of small run-offs flowing down the mountain.\n* \n* Two courses with 9 holes Crazy Minigolf. This is a challenging and fun experience you won't soon forget. Try them. On the way, you will be served something good in a glass. Team up with your friends or colleagues for play. It is approx. 45 minutes to play through 9 holes.\n*",
                "* If you are interested in classical music or jazz check the program of this hall.\n* \n* Some of Oslos best stages for music. Rockefeller houses three stages while Sentrum Scene houses a fourth and larger stage. Mostly concert stages but they also show the odd football match or cinema. Both Norwegian and international artists.\n* There are plenty of islands perfect for relaxing and swimming. Ferries depart from Vippetangen and Aker Brygge in the city center. There are beaches at Huk, Bygd\u00f8y as well (Bus 30 to Bygd\u00f8y), as well as Katten and Ingierstrand. A new harbor bath opened in 2015 in S\u00f8renga, the new development just south-east of the Oslo S/Opera-area.\n* The ski jump located on the west side of Oslo, which was rebuilt for the World Ski Championships in 2011. It first opened in 1892 and has been rebuilt many times since then. It had more than 1 million visitors every year and was one of the biggest tourist attractions in Norway. There is also the oldest ski museum in the world, opened in 1923. Walking and mountain bike riding are popular activities here during the summer.\n* \n* For the fun buy a cheap sled or \"akebrett\", or rent a proper one from Frognerseteren, and sleigh down from Frognerseteren to Midtstuen station. This was actually the venue of the sleighing competitions in the 1952 Winter Olympics, and the hill is referred to as \"Korketrekkeren\" (the corkscrew). If you buy a day card for the subway, you can race all day long, but make sure you are well dressed, as you are going to get wet.\n* One more park in the eastern Oslo. A lot of activities all day long and especially on the weekends there; ball play, pick-nick, public barbecue, especially nice area for children. Be somewhat careful walking through here at night if you're drunk and dressed lightly.\n* V\u00e5lerenga is a multi-sports club from the eastern part of Oslos inner city. Their football department is one of the major teams in Norway, with a new stadium opened in 2017 after more than 100 years in exile playing at different venues in the city. Tickets can be bought online at ticketmaster.no, or at the club shop currently located at the stadium at Intility Arena, near Helsfyr T-bane station.\n*",

You won't need to take public transportation or a car to visit the most remarkable places in Pamplona as most touristy spots lie within the city center/old town. During Sanfermines, from July 6th until 14th, there is lots of alcohol, music, and dancing in the streets all night long and, by 6AM, you'd better go get a good place to watch the running of the bulls, which starts at 8AM and attracts lots of spectators and media. After that, get a good breakfast or \"almuerzo\" and find time to go to sleep after a long night.",
                "Events\n* The festival begins with the txupinazo: a rocket fired from the city council's balcony at 12 p.m. on the 6th. A large street party ensues that night and for the rest of the week. The best-known feature is the encierro (running of the bulls), which occurs every day at 8 a.m. Six bulls run through the town center towards the plaza de toros (bull ring); the adventurous and foolhardy run in front of them. Note that on July 6 there is no encierro as the festival officially starts at noon. \nIf you want to run with the bulls, arrive at the track no later than 7:30 a.m. You will form up behind a line of police that will happily remove you from the crowd if you are drunk or improperly dressed. Having a camera when you run is not allowed. During Sanfermines, every evening the bullring is completely sold out. Basically, the bullring, like any other in Spain, is divided into two zones, Sombra (meaning 'shadow') where experts and fans watch the bullfight more passively, and Sol (literally 'Sun') offering cheaper tickets to people ready to see the fight as well as have fun, dance, drink and eat some local cuisine. Pamplona's bullring is the fourth largest in the world and the second-largest in Spain after Las Ventas in Madrid. Research before you attempt to run the bulls. It is extremely thrilling, but very dangerous. The best place to start, with advice from Spanish and American bull-runners, John Hemingway (Ernest's grandson), and edited by travel author and former bullfighter Alexander Fiske-Harrison, is the eBook, available on Amazon, Fiesta: How To Survive The Bulls Of Pamplona.",

At 11 p.m. there's a fireworks display every night near the citadel or \"Vuelta del Castillo.\" This is a great place to lay down, relax and enjoy the fireworks before going out to bars and concerts."

                "is 's capital and busiest city. Settlements in Praia started in the 1615 which then became capital of the country in the year 1770. The city is located in the southern end of Santiago Island and has year round good weather. The city is divided into various small unofficial districts, the most important ones being, Plateau (city center), Achada Santo Antonio, Palmarejo, Fazenda, Achada Grande, Varzea, Safende, Sucupira(bazaar area), Calbeciera, Terra Branca, Vila Nova, Achadinha, Bairro, Prainha, Monte Vermelho, Achada Mato, Achada Sao Felipe, and other smaller ones. Most part of the city are residential areas, so probably not worth visiting in itself, but worth a half-day exploration if you are passing through to another destination.\n \nThe center of the city lies on a plateau overlooking the bay to the southeast. The airport lies a few kilometers to the northeast.\n \nGet in\n \nPraia has an international airport. TACV (national flag carrier) and TAP airlines fly to various destinations in Europe, Africa, South America and United States. Taxis from the airport to Plateau cost 800/1000. You can pay in Euros (10\u20ac to Praia in June 2016). There is one bus line that serves the airport but it\u2019s better to just take a taxi since there is actually only one or two buses that serves this line. You can also enter the city through the port. There are ferry boats that have irregular service to and from the islands of Maio, Boavista, Sal and Sao Nicolau, and more regular and scheduled service to and from Sao Vicente and Fogo. You can exchange money at hotel (1 \u20ac= 105 Escudos) or in the city (1 \u20ac= 110 \u20ac in June 2016).\n \nGet around\n \nThe city has countless bus stops, and taxis are everywhere waiting for customers. There are two main bus companies that serve the city, Moura Company and Sol Atlantico. Each route has their own numbers. The main lines are from Safende to Achada Santo Antonio, Vila Nova to Achada Santo Antonio, Calbeceira to Palmarejo, Pensamento to Terra Branca, Achada Grande to Achada Santo Antonio, Sao Felipe to Plateau, Ponta D'Agua to Plateau,Achada Mato to Palmarejo. Most of these lines pass by Plateau (city center), Varzea and Terra Branca, the bus fair is about 35 escudos. When it comes to taxis you should be careful with illegal taxis that sometimes roam around and might rip you off. The normal taxi fare between two furthest points of the city shouldn\u2019t be more 1500 escudos in daytime and 1800 escudos at night time, example Pensamento to Palmarejo, or Palmarejo to Achada Mato. Taxi drivers usually expect to get a tip, give around 50 escudos to 100 escudos. Just be careful and always drive with the taxis that have a taximeter, so that they don\u2019t overcharge you.\n \nThe city doesn\u2019t really have a good way to navigate because of the lack of an official map. This is because large part of the city doesn\u2019t have their names or house numbers yet. In the city center and in the more important parts of the city most streets have names and numbers. However, most people are friendly and will give you directions. Walking by foot between the different districts is not recommended, especially since most of the city's side walks are made out of loose cobblestone and is difficult to walk, also because the city is full of hills that can be tiring to walk. But if you want to have a good cardio-workout try it!\n \nSee\n \n*\n \n*\n \n*\n \nDo\n \nBuy\n \nAv. Amircal Cabral is the main street. Parallel to this, you have a pedestrian street with some shops including a Souvenir Shop. Normally close at 18 h.\n \nEat\n \n*A great place to eat local food and watch the world go by.\n \nDrink\n \nSleep\n \nBudget \n*Newly renovated bed & breakfast located in the heart of the city of Praia, known as Plateau, near the Presidential Palace.

Most crimes involve petty thievery and these are mostly focused on actual residents and not on tourists, although there have been a few cases which involved tourists. So Praia is still a very safe city, just be careful with flaunting any expensive jewelry or gadgets like iPhones and such. Cape Verde in the past few years has seen an increase of petty crimes which are done mostly by groups of young people so avoid groups of young men especially at night.\n \nPraia is also a badly illuminated city at night, so be careful in places that might not have street lights and is somewhat isolated, always travel in pairs or in groups for safety. However if anything does occur there are police stations in various parts of the city and a general hospital in the city center.\n \nThe stairs at the edge of Achada Santo Antonio towards Plateau are unsafe, also during the day, avoid that neighbourhood.\n \nAt night, take a taxi.\n \n \nCope\n \n \nEmbassies & Consulates\n \n* \n \n* \n \n* \n \n* \n \nGet out\n \n, the historic capital, is an easy half-day trip.\n \nYou can rent a car or ask for a full day tour (9 hours) for a round trip island."

Old winding streets and wooden houses are representative of accommodation from Stavangers days as a the canning capital of Norway. Most houses in Old Stavanger are privately owned and well kept.\n*A good place for a photo opportunity are the Three Swords (Sverd i fjell, literally Sword in Mountain), a monument outside the centre of Stavanger, beside the Hafrsfjord.

Many of the trails have been marked out by the Turistforetning with rocks bearing a red \"T\". Turistforening hyttes (cabins) provide simple accommodation in the mountains. Also mountain bikes can be hired and taken on the trails. The Pulpit Rock is accessible throughout the year for day trips, while the road to Kjerag is closed during winter.\n*Solastranden (Sola Beach) is a long sandy beach by the airport. It is very popular in the summer and allows for some small waves for surfing. Along the beach, in the dunes, are the remains of defences from the 1940-45 occupation. Other less populated beaches are all along the coastline although they are sometimes hard to find. \n*Ice skating on Stokkavannet - In the depths of winter the government tests the ice on its lakes. Once the official word is given many Norwegians will head for the largest lake, Stokkavannet. The lake itself is located near to Madla about 20 minutes bus ride outside of Stavanger. Should the ice not be safe, and you have a compulsion to skate, another option is the newly built full size indoor long track speed skating arena S\u00f8rmarka Arena.

'Traditional' (i.e. pre-19th century styles) can be seen right next to anything that takes your fancy, be it self-styled dresses, steampunk or outfits modeled on fiction or manga templates. The original fascination of carneval came from people being hidden behind their masks, allowing them to cross social boundaries and disregard social norms for some time.\n*Festa del Redentore (Feast of the Redeemer) is held on the third Sunday of July. It commemorates the end of the plague in Venice in 1577. The feast is mostly known for the fireworks display which begins on Saturday night at 10pm which is admired by thousand of Venetians from their boats in St. Mark basin or from their terraces. After the display, which lasts about 40 minutes, the young people of Venice head to the Lido to wait for dawn. Three regattas are held on Sunday. Religious celebrations are held in the Church of the Holy Redeemr on Saturday at 7:30 pm and on Sunday at 12:30 am and 8 am.\n*La Biennale di Venezia is one of the most well known culture institutions.

Voga Longa competitors must row 32 kilometers under 3.5 hours to receive a certificate of attendance at the finish line, but everybody with a human-powered vessel is welcome to participate (some foreigner teams take up to 10 hours to complete the journey just for the fun of it). The official purpose of the Voga Longa was to protest the sharply increasing use of powerboats in Venice, but the event has gradually grown into a festival since 1974, with up to 5500 racers in 1500 vessels attending by the early 2000s. The racetrack visits different parts of Venice as well as some of the nearby islands. Locals and tourists lining up alongside rios and canals cheer the racers. Visitors wishing to participate should have serious experience in rowing or sculling and practice duely, as the journey is physically demanding (even seasoned oarsmen develop calluses by the finish line). The event is mainly for teams, completing Voga Longa on a single oar is considered a major achievement. Extreme participation (scuba frogmen and surface swimmers) sometimes occurs, but it is not recommended due to water contamination issues."

Asturias airport is located near Avil\u00e9s, and is easily accessible by bus from the three main cities of Gij\u00f3n, Oviedo and Avil\u00e9s.\nIf you're coming from London try easyjet.com, which flies direct to Asturias airport. From other areas in Europe try ryanair.com, which flies into Santander, less than a three hour bus ride from Oviedo. All three of these airlines are low cost carriers.\nIf you're coming via Madrid, buses also frequently run from the bus station, which is accessible by metro from the airport. Tickets cost from about \u20ac30 each way and can be pre-booked online though the web site of the coach company ALSA ALSA is the company that operates the majority of the inter-city buses. The bus takes a little over 5 hours. \nTrain is a third option when coming from Madrid. Prices are from \u20ac27 each way for the discounted 'Estrella' tariff which must be booked at least least 7 days in advance through the RENFE (Spanish state railways) website This makes it slightly cheaper than the bus. Otherwise the train is a bit more expensive, from \u20ac45. The train is definitely the scenic option though.

Sidra is an alcoholic apple cider famous to Asturias, with its own tradition. Be sure to ask a server how to correctly drink the beverage, and don't miss the way they pour it. Another game that can be played in many of the Bars in Oviedo and other parts of Spain and France is Duro. It is a drinking game similar to that of quarters. They play it with a drink known as Calimocho, a combination of Coke, red wine, and current berry syrup. Ask a bartender and they will give you the necessary cups, etc."

Needless to say, a visit to Belfast will be rewarded by a glimpse of a unique city that has finally begun to celebrate, rather than fight over, its place as a cultural meeting-point of Britain and Ireland. Belfast is certainly exhibiting an air of determined optimism, with new hotels, bars, restaurants, clubs and shops opening at an incredible rate. It is a city that is proud of its Victorian and Edwardian heritage and efforts to restore historic buildings are proving successful. Tourism is on the increase in Northern Ireland, especially among those seeking a weekend away or short break in Ireland as Belfast can offer a significantly cheaper and more rewarding alternative to the bigger, busier, more expensive and more tourist-driven .",

Although the cherries are long gone and wintery gusts have settled in, the Chinese New Year (lasting weeks, beginning in Jan or Feb depending on the lunar calendar) may be an enjoyable time to visit the city if crowds are not your thing, as Dalian's short history prevents many from calling the city their hometown, and therefore the city has a quiet feel during these winter weeks.",

Some of its streets are steep: Baldwin Street(slope angle of 19\u00b0) is claimed as the steepest street in the world by the Guinness Book of World Records.

The Faroe Islands turn extraordinarily green during the summertime. The fresh air, the deep blue ocean, the vertical sea cliffs and the green mountains with their picturesque valleys, is something which would amaze anyone who enjoys being surrounded by nature.

Visit one of the many exciting, historic destinations!\n \n*St. Olav's Church King H\u00e5kon H\u00e5konsson erected the St. Olav\u2019s Church around 1250 AD as part of the royal farm on Avaldsnes. Next to the church stands one of Norway\u2019s tallest pillars, \u201cJomfru Marias syn\u00e5l\u201d (Virgin Mary\u2019s Sewing Needle). According to the legend when the pillar touches the church wall it means the end of the world. That is why the priests through the years have chipped off parts of the top. St. Olav\u2019s Church is situated on Avaldsnes, approximately 10 minutes by car south of Haugesund.\n \n*Nordvegen History Centre At Nordvegen History Centre king Harald Fairhair invites us in to walk in the footsteps of our ancestors. He is our guide through a 3500 year long history about Avaldsnes as a meeting spot between Norway and Europe, and as a national and, at times, international centre of power. The Viking king presents some of the kings who have controlled the Norwegian coast from Avaldsnes. Some of these kings are known through archaeological findings, and some through tales. The history centre is situated adjacent to St. Olav\u2019s Church.\n \n*The Viking farm at Avaldsnes The Viking farm at Bukk\u00f8y is a reconstructed farm at Avaldsnes. The museum provides knowledge about the lives of our ancestors. In the museum courtyard you will find a traditional longhouse as well as smaller dwellings, a Viking boat and plants and animals. During the summer people are dressed in Viking clothes as they display the Vikings\u2019 way of life. You get here by walking from St. Olav\u2019s Church, through the open beautiful landscape before getting to the tree-covered island.\n \n*Haraldshaugen Just north of downtown Haugesund you will find Haraldshaugen, a testimony to the fact that although the city is young, the area has been known and used for thousands of years. Haraldshaugen consists of four important monuments in Norwegian history; the burial mound, the stone cross, the church site, and the National Monument (Haraldsst\u00f8tta). The latter was unveiled in 1872 in commemoration of Harald Fairhair\u2019s gathering of Norway into one kingdom. The legend goes that he was buried here.\n \n*Archaeological excavations The ground and sound at the old royal farm at Avaldsnes still hold secrets that can give us new knowledge about Norwegian and international history. Excavations have led to the discovery of traces of old buildings close to St. Olav\u2019s Church. These findings might even prove to be remains of Harald Fairhair\u2019s court, which he set up here following the battle of Hafrsfjord. Projects are in place to excavate more of the area in order to find out more about these important and exciting findings.\n \n*St\u00f8dle St\u00f8dle, in the municipality of Etne, is another important historical area in Haugalandet. During parts of the Middle Ages, St\u00f8dle was the main seat of power in Norway. From here king Magnus Erlingsson ruled Norway at the end of the 12th century. His father, earl Erling Skakke, built a chapel at the royal farm. The chapel dates back to 1160 and today it is part of the current St\u00f8dle church. At St\u00f8dle you will also find remnants of the Bronze Ages. St\u00f8dle is situated about one hour by car east of Haugesund.\n \n*Rehaugene At the top of Karm\u00f8y, six imposing earthen burial mounds, which dominate the landscape, were built during the Bronze Age (1800 \u2013 500 BC). There used to be many more burial mounds here, however, only six remain, and they are called the pyramids of the north. They were built as the final resting place for the powerful chiefs that lived at Avaldsnes. These burial mounds show that 3000 years ago Norway traded with communities as far away as Russia, Ireland and the Mediterranean.\n \n*Flagghaugen Flagghaugen is a burial mound dating back to the third century AD. It is situated just north of St. Olavs Church. Originally it was 43 meters in diameter and 5 meters high. The remaining parts can be seen just outside of the stone fence surrounding the church. A prince was buried here, and in the grave the richest gold finds from any grave in Scandinavia from the Later Roman Iron Age was found. Among the findings was a massive necklace made of 590 grams of pure gold. The prince is presented at the Nordvegen History Centre close by.\n \n*Ryvarden The Icelandic Book of Settlement, Landn\u00e1ma, says that Fl\u00f2ke Vilgjerdson build a beacon at Ryvarden in 868 before he sailed to Iceland. He was the first man to sail to Iceland with the purpose of settling there, and he is also the one who gave Iceland its name. The story goes that he used three ravens to show him the way, hence the name he is now known by; Ravnafloke (Raven-Floke). The first Viking raid is also said to have originated from Ryvarden. There is a small museum at Ryvarden telling the story of Ravnafloke. Of course, the highlight of a trip to Ryvarden is simply taking in the breathtaking scenery.\n \n*The Viking Centre The Viking Settlement at Avaldsnes is copy of a Viking settlement, complete with a longhouse and all the requisites, has been reconstructed, just below the Church of Olav in Avaldsnes.\n*Near to Karm\u00f8y, this is the ancient hole dating back to 972 in which irritating Swedes were thrown to be mauled by bears. The pracitce eventually deterred Swedes from passing through, although some credit this to the nearby 'Bird Cage'.",

You can enjoy any type of show from comedy to classical drama to avant-garde productions.\n* It is a very nice way to spend an evening with a show (usually comedy), drinks, and food.\n* The historical theatre beautifuly designed by Gaspard Andr\u00e9 in the 19th century. The building has an Italian-style facade. Behind the theater, in the middle of a quiet square, there is a strange periscope where you can see rotating geometric shapes, like a kaleidoscope. They were actually painted in the car park beneath the plaza by the famous artist Daniel Buren and they are reflected by a rotating mirror.\n* Two rooms and talented young comedians.\n* The other theatre with a more avant-garde program.\n* Spend a time in an evening of laughter. The caf\u00e9-th\u00e9\u00e2tre will help you.\n* The largest Guignol theatre, showing original creations for children and adults. The 200-year-old Guignol is a very famous character in puppet theatre. This irreverent canut who frequently challenges the law in his adventures was created by Laurent Mourguet, a canut himself, in 1808. The main side characters in Guignol's shows are his wife Madelon, his Beaujolais-drinking friend Gnafron, and the policeman, who always ends up being ridiculous. It was the 1950s when Guignol became a children's favorite. Nowadays, a few theatres perpetuate the tradition for children and adults.\n* Especially intended for children. This outdoor theatre is conveniently located within the park, near the lake and the zoo.\n* This is the only theatre in Lyon showing popular comedies in the Parisian \"boulevard\" style.\n* Jean Vilar's spirit of 'popular theatre' lives on in the historically left-wing Villeurbanne..",
                "Events\nCultural events are listed by two weekly magazines: Le Petit Bulletin (free, available in cinemas, theatres, some bars, etc., and online \n* Lyon alternatively hosts dancing (in even years) and contemporary art biennales (in odd years) from September to December and January. The dancing and biennial are traditionally opened by a street parade in which inhabitants of the Greater Lyon take part through neighborhood associations. If you are in town at this moment, do not miss this colorful and funny event.",
                "* It is by far the most important event of the year. It lasts four days around the 8th of December. It was initially a traditional religious celebration: on December 8th, 1852, the people of Lyon spontaneously illuminated their windows with candles to celebrate the inauguration of the golden statue of the Virgin Mary (the Virgin had been the saint patron of Lyon since she allegedly saved the city from the plague in 1643). The same ritual was then repeated every year. In the last decade or so, the celebration turned into an international event, with light shows by professional artists from all over the world. Those range from tiny installations in remote neighborhoods to massive sound-and-light shows, the largest one traditionally taking place on Place des Terreaux. The traditional celebration lives on, though: during the weeks preceding December 8th, the traditional candles and glasses are sold by shops all over town. This festival attracts around 4 million visitors every year. It now compares, in terms of attendance, to the Oktoberfest in Munich for example. Needless to say, accommodation for this period should be booked months in advance. You will also need good shoes (to avoid the crowd in the metro) and very warm clothes (it can be very cold at this time of year).\n* The Roman theatres host various shows such as concerts (popular music, jazz, classical), dancing, theatre, and cinema. International artists who usually fill up much larger venues are often seduced by the special atmosphere of the theatres.\n* An increasingly popular festival dedicated to electronic music, every year in May."

All citizens of Munich were invited to a meadow (Wiesn) situated in front of the city tower, subsequently renamed the Theresienwiese in honor of the bride. In the early years of the fair, horse races were held, then as the event grew, an agricultural convention, which still takes place every fourth year, was added to the program. In 1896, businessmen working with the breweries in Munich built the first giant beer tents at Oktoberfest, and beer drinking has been the primary focus ever since. Today, the Oktoberfest is the best-known beer festival around the world and has been replicated on all continents. In 2011, the Oktoberfest hosted 6.9 million visitors from around the world who drank 7.5 million liters of beer and ate the equivalent of 118 boxes and 522,821 roasted chickens. At the center of the spectacle are 14 large beer tents, which are set up along the Wirtsbudenstrasse in the northern part of Theresienwiese. These have a seating capacity of up to 8,500 inside the tent and add hundreds or thousands of seats in the adjacent beer gardens. Here only beer of the 6 major Munich breweries (Augustiner, Hacker-Pschorr, Hofbr\u00e4u, L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u, Paulaner, Spaten-Franziskaner) is sold. The tents in alphabetical order are: \n 1. Armbrustsch\u00fctzen-Festhalle (Paulaner beer, here a crossbow shooting competition is held each year)\n 2. Augustiner-Festhalle (Augustiner beer, here the beer is still drafted from the traditional wooden barrels)\n 3. Br\u00e4urosl (Hacker-Pschorr beer)\n 4. Fischer-Vroni (Augustiner beer, the specialty is grilled fish)\n 5. Hacker-Festzelt (Hacker-Pschorr beer)\n 6. Marstall (Spaten-Franziskaner beer)\n 7. Hofbr\u00e4u-Festzelt (Hofbr\u00e4u beer, probably the most touristy among the tents)\n 8. K\u00e4fer's Wies'n-Sch\u00e4nke (Paulaner beer, meeting point of the celebrities)\n 9. L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u-Festhalle (L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u beer, known for the roaring lion above the main entrance)\n10. Ochsenbraterei (Spaten-Franziskaner beer, here whole oxes are grilled)\n11. Schottenhamel (Spaten-Franziskaner beer, location of traditional tapping of the first barrel by the Munich mayor)\n12. Sch\u00fctzen-Festzelt (L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u beer)\n13. Weinzelt (the tent for those who prefer wine and champagne)\n14. Winzerer F\u00e4hndl (Paulaner beer) \nEspecially on weekends, you should try to get in the tents before 10AM. During the week, most tents are open all day, however, it is not easy to get a seat if you are a larger group. It is a general rule that you will not get served if you do not have a seat. The exception is the Hofbr\u00e4u Festzeltwhere beer is also served in a standing area. It is not recommended to leave the tent if you want to get in it later since it might be crowded by that time. There are also smaller beer tents, which also offer beer, Bavarian food, and Oktoberfest music and it might be possible to still get a seat there when the large tents are already full. However, the Oktoberfest has more to offer than the parties inside the beer tents. In the Schaustellerstrasse you can ride numerous roller coasters - assuming you are still able to do so after enjoying the Munich beer. Finally a few general hints:\n** Accommodation will be hard to find and prices can easily double during Oktoberfest. \n** Smoking is not allowed in the tents, but some tents feature designated outdoor smoking areas. Think twice if you want leave a tent for smoking since you may not get in again.\n** The closest underground station \"Theresienwiese\" (underground lines U4 and U5) is very crowded and will sometimes be closed because of this. As an alternative, go to the underground station \"Goetheplatz\" (lines U3 and U6). It's crowded too, but you will still have some air to breathe there. Just follow the crowd when you get out of the station.\n** In most beer tents the bar closes at 10:30pm while the tent closes at 11:30pm. You should have finished your beer before then since the security will ruthlessly clear the area.\n** Tents open at 10am usually (9am on weekends). The first day is tapping day (german \"Anstich\"). There is no beer served before noon and since the tents will surely be crowded by then, it will take some time until everyone is served.\n** If you are with small children, try to avoid the weekends. Every Tuesday from 12 to 6pm is a family day with discounts on many rides.\n** Do not steal the 1-liter beer glasses. They might seem like a great souvenir, but bags are checked and everyone trying to steal a beer glass will be handed over to the police. If you really want one of these glasses, you can buy them for a few Euros.\n** Stay out of fights - the police will arrest you and if you are crazy enough to hit and injure someone with a beer stein you will get charged with attempted manslaughter!\n* St. Patrick's Day Munich Parade of Irish and Scottish unions that attracts 30.000 visitors and is the largest Irish event east of Dublin.\n* Theatron Festivals Two further music festivals in Munich, the Theatron Pfingstfestival during Whitsun and the Musiksommer in August.\n* Tollwood &mdash; In summer this alternative festival takes place in the Olympic Park, in winter on Theresienwiese (the Oktoberfest area).

                "Do\nNaples has an abundance of attractions and activities that await its annual tourists. There is no way to list them all here, but below are some of the most popular things to do in Naples:\n* The beaches of Naples are located on the eastern and western edges of the city. Eastern beaches are characterized by dark sand. La Gaiola Beach on the western coast is one of the most beautiful Neapolitan beaches as well as less affected by urban influence and contamination. There are nice rocky beaches in Lido Marechiaro, Bagno Elena, or private Rocce Verdi beach. Miseno Beach already has a sandy shore.\n* The history of cinema in Naples begins at the end of the 19th century the first of which was the Panorama of Naples Harbor. Over time, many cinematographic works have been recorded, production houses have been established, many notable filmmakers have been born, and many prizes have been won. Over the decades the Neapolitan capital has also been used as a film set for many works, over 600 according to the Internet Movie Database. When you go to the cinema, never forget that Tot\u00f2 is an icon of Naples, the \u201cprince of jokes\u201d who made hundreds laugh. Recognize and visit locations where many films were created\n* \n* Any small idea can be generated into a tour. Naples is full of different attractions.\n* Naples is full of surprises and secrets. It\u2019s a city with bizarre superstitions.\n* \n* Football is the most popular sport in Naples. This sport is deeply rooted in the local culture: it is popular at every level of society, from street children to wealthy professionals. The city's best-known football club is SSC Napoli.\n* A fun 1.5-hour tour through the old Greek and Roman city and aqueducts buried under the modern city; also includes some WWII history as this area was used as a bomb shelter. Tours in English leave M-F 12, 2, and 4 (and 9 PM on Thurs), Sa-Su 10, 12, 2, 4, and 6; see New York Times article. (Note: The nearby San Lorenzo Maggiore also has underground ruins of the old Roman market, but they are much less extensive and there is typically no guide).\n* Naples has many great theatres. First of all, the most famous and prestigious Theater in the world San Carlo, an opera house in Naples opened in 1737. Seeing an opera in this theatre is a unique experience, a show inside the show. The other less prestigious Napulitana (Neapolitan songs), Teatro Bellini (Performing arts), Teatro Augusteo (Performing arts), and Palapartenope Theater.\n* The Spaccanapoli course stands out for its color and noise, which is interesting because it divides the city of Naples into two parts. From there, travel to St. Severus Chapel (Cappella Sansevero), which preserves a famous 18th-century masterpiece of the Neapolitan sculptor Giuseppe Sanmartino - \"Veiled Christ \" (Cristo Velato). The sculpture depicting the dead Christ wrapped in a veil is still a mystery to sculpture fans, who cannot find an explanation as to how the author managed to get such a thin veil out of marble; Walk along the seashore: Via Nazario Sauro, Via Partenope, and Via Francesco Caracciolo.

The festival originated in the 16th century when people would request special talismans thrown out by priests. As word spread that the talismans were bringing those who possessed them good luck, more and more people came to get them, fights broke out and the talismans were damaged. Later this all evolved into a midnight festival with only male participants dressed in loincloths.

                "Buildings and structures\nArchitecture in Oslo may at first seem dull. Unlike for instance its Swedish counterpart, Stockholm, downtown Oslo has only scattered monumental buildings where in particular the Parliament-Palace axis (upper part of Karl Johan Street) has a certain Parisian grandeur. The charm of Oslo can also be found in the affluent inner-city suburbs of for instance Frogner and Fagerborg as well as above St.Hanshaugen Park. Northern Europe has a distinct wooden house tradition. Wooden houses are not allowed downtown, but these charming houses can be found in large numbers in villa suburbs such as Bygd\u00f8y and Holmenkollen, or former workers' areas such as Rodel\u00f8kka, Kampen, V\u00e5lerenga, Damstredet, Hellerud, or Telthusbakken. Oslo also has many exciting building projects and a huge part of the city's waterfront will in a few years have changed.\n* A medieval castle and fortress built in 1299, located close to the city center. There are several excellent viewpoints to the and surrounding areas. The stone walls create an exciting atmosphere, and you are free to roam around in tight passages and staircases. There are two museums here, both related to Norwegian military history.\n* Open to the public, with a spectacular main hall featuring huge murals with typical Nordic social democratic themes. There are also some displays of historical artifacts in the side rooms upstairs. This is where the Nobel Peace Prize is presented to the winner every year. Although there is no public lift, disadvantaged visitors only have to ask and they can use the staff lift.\n* The old bazaar surrounding the church is now used by artisans and craftsmen and holds a couple of cafes and restaurants.\n* Norway's first entry into the top league of modern architecture. Awarded the 2008 prize for best cultural building at the World Architecture Festival in Barcelona, and the prestigious Mies van der Rohe award for best European contemporary architecture in 2009, its appearance is stunning. Shaped as a glacier or a ship, the amazing building seems to float by the inlet Bj\u00f8rvika, giving a stunning impression. Climb the building on the marble slopes (summer only) for a unique Oslo view. Be careful when temperatures go under 5 degrees as the roof may be very slippery! The main highway, which used to pass just between the Opera and Oslo Central Station, is now moved to a sub-sea tunnel under Bj\u00f8rvika. The huge road crossing Bispelokket, which has marred the seafront of Oslo for 50 years, is currently being dismantled.\n* is none too impressive, but recently refurbished. After the terrorist attacks on Oslo in July 2011, the square Stortorget, in front of Oslo Cathedral, became the center for afterthought and compassion. The square was fully covered by roses, greetings, and mourning messages for weeks.\n* It has free guided tours in English and Norwegian lasting about 45 minutes, which assemble outside the back door of the Parliament (on Akersgata). There is a limit of 30 people per tour, so it is advisable to be there at least 10 minutes prior to the start of a tour.",
                "* If you are interested in classical music or jazz check the program of this hall.\n* \n* Some of Oslos best stages for music. Rockefeller houses three stages while Sentrum Scene houses a fourth and larger stage. Mostly concert stages but they also show the odd football match or cinema. Both Norwegian and international artists.\n* There are plenty of islands perfect for relaxing and swimming. Ferries depart from Vippetangen and Aker Brygge in the city center. There are beaches at Huk, Bygd\u00f8y as well (Bus 30 to Bygd\u00f8y), as well as Katten and Ingierstrand. A new harbor bath opened in 2015 in S\u00f8renga, the new development just south-east of the Oslo S/Opera-area.\n* The ski jump located on the west side of Oslo, which was rebuilt for the World Ski Championships in 2011. It first opened in 1892 and has been rebuilt many times since then. It had more than 1 million visitors every year and was one of the biggest tourist attractions in Norway. There is also the oldest ski museum in the world, opened in 1923. Walking and mountain bike riding are popular activities here during the summer.\n* \n* For the fun buy a cheap sled or \"akebrett\", or rent a proper one from Frognerseteren, and sleigh down from Frognerseteren to Midtstuen station. This was actually the venue of the sleighing competitions in the 1952 Winter Olympics, and the hill is referred to as \"Korketrekkeren\" (the corkscrew). If you buy a day card for the subway, you can race all day long, but make sure you are well dressed, as you are going to get wet.\n* One more park in the eastern Oslo. A lot of activities all day long and especially on the weekends there; ball play, pick-nick, public barbecue, especially nice area for children. Be somewhat careful walking through here at night if you're drunk and dressed lightly.\n* V\u00e5lerenga is a multi-sports club from the eastern part of Oslos inner city. Their football department is one of the major teams in Norway, with a new stadium opened in 2017 after more than 100 years in exile playing at different venues in the city. Tickets can be bought online at ticketmaster.no, or at the club shop currently located at the stadium at Intility Arena, near Helsfyr T-bane station.\n*",
                "Events\n* It is billed as the world's biggest football tournament (about 25,000 participants). Lots of fun and football. Held annually at the beginning of August.\n* A major music festival taking place each August in T\u00f8yenparken.\n* Another annual music festival arranged next to Vigeland park. The name of the festival refers to the Beatles' song \"Norwegian Wood\"."

Most famous worldwide for its San Ferm\u00edn festival each year from July 6th to 14th, \"The Running of the Bulls\" features a daily bull run or \"Encierro\" in Spanish. This festival was depicted in the writings of Ernest Hemingway (who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954). Pamplona is a green city. There are many interesting things to do and explore in Pamplona for the traveler since it is the first main city on the route of St. James (). Furthermore, Pamplona has a beautiful medieval city center, several museums, an impressive citadel, great gastronomy and wines, and lots of parks. The Arga River runs through it. There city has two universities: Universidad P\u00fablica de Navarra (Public) and one of the four Universidad de Navarra (private) campuses.",
                "Events\n* The festival begins with the txupinazo: a rocket fired from the city council's balcony at 12 p.m. on the 6th. A large street party ensues that night and for the rest of the week. The best-known feature is the encierro (running of the bulls), which occurs every day at 8 a.m. Six bulls run through the town center towards the plaza de toros (bull ring); the adventurous and foolhardy run in front of them. Note that on July 6 there is no encierro as the festival officially starts at noon. \nIf you want to run with the bulls, arrive at the track no later than 7:30 a.m. You will form up behind a line of police that will happily remove you from the crowd if you are drunk or improperly dressed. Having a camera when you run is not allowed. During Sanfermines, every evening the bullring is completely sold out. Basically, the bullring, like any other in Spain, is divided into two zones, Sombra (meaning 'shadow') where experts and fans watch the bullfight more passively, and Sol (literally 'Sun') offering cheaper tickets to people ready to see the fight as well as have fun, dance, drink and eat some local cuisine. Pamplona's bullring is the fourth largest in the world and the second-largest in Spain after Las Ventas in Madrid. Research before you attempt to run the bulls. It is extremely thrilling, but very dangerous. The best place to start, with advice from Spanish and American bull-runners, John Hemingway (Ernest's grandson), and edited by travel author and former bullfighter Alexander Fiske-Harrison, is the eBook, available on Amazon, Fiesta: How To Survive The Bulls Of Pamplona.",
                "Pamplona offers two very different faces to visitors. During Sanfermines the city is driven by music, bulls, drinking, and general madness. The rest of the year it is a charming little place with great food, friendly people, lovely walks in the green parks and stone-paved streets, and great caf\u00e9s and bars everywhere you go.\n* City is crossed by way of pilgrims.\n* At midnight, get ready for concerts of any type of music in places like Plaza del Castillo, Plaza de Los Fueros, or Antoniutti. At 11 p.m. there's a fireworks display every night near the citadel or \"Vuelta del Castillo.\" This is a great place to lay down, relax and enjoy the fireworks before going out to bars and concerts."

                "is 's capital and busiest city. Settlements in Praia started in the 1615 which then became capital of the country in the year 1770. The city is located in the southern end of Santiago Island and has year round good weather. The city is divided into various small unofficial districts, the most important ones being, Plateau (city center), Achada Santo Antonio, Palmarejo, Fazenda, Achada Grande, Varzea, Safende, Sucupira(bazaar area), Calbeciera, Terra Branca, Vila Nova, Achadinha, Bairro, Prainha, Monte Vermelho, Achada Mato, Achada Sao Felipe, and other smaller ones. Most part of the city are residential areas, so probably not worth visiting in itself, but worth a half-day exploration if you are passing through to another destination.\n \nThe center of the city lies on a plateau overlooking the bay to the southeast. The airport lies a few kilometers to the northeast.\n \nGet in\n \nPraia has an international airport. TACV (national flag carrier) and TAP airlines fly to various destinations in Europe, Africa, South America and United States. Taxis from the airport to Plateau cost 800/1000. You can pay in Euros (10\u20ac to Praia in June 2016). There is one bus line that serves the airport but it\u2019s better to just take a taxi since there is actually only one or two buses that serves this line. You can also enter the city through the port. There are ferry boats that have irregular service to and from the islands of Maio, Boavista, Sal and Sao Nicolau, and more regular and scheduled service to and from Sao Vicente and Fogo. You can exchange money at hotel (1 \u20ac= 105 Escudos) or in the city (1 \u20ac= 110 \u20ac in June 2016).\n \nGet around\n \nThe city has countless bus stops, and taxis are everywhere waiting for customers. There are two main bus companies that serve the city, Moura Company and Sol Atlantico. Each route has their own numbers. The main lines are from Safende to Achada Santo Antonio, Vila Nova to Achada Santo Antonio, Calbeceira to Palmarejo, Pensamento to Terra Branca, Achada Grande to Achada Santo Antonio, Sao Felipe to Plateau, Ponta D'Agua to Plateau,Achada Mato to Palmarejo. Most of these lines pass by Plateau (city center), Varzea and Terra Branca, the bus fair is about 35 escudos. When it comes to taxis you should be careful with illegal taxis that sometimes roam around and might rip you off. The normal taxi fare between two furthest points of the city shouldn\u2019t be more 1500 escudos in daytime and 1800 escudos at night time, example Pensamento to Palmarejo, or Palmarejo to Achada Mato. Taxi drivers usually expect to get a tip, give around 50 escudos to 100 escudos. Just be careful and always drive with the taxis that have a taximeter, so that they don\u2019t overcharge you.\n \nThe city doesn\u2019t really have a good way to navigate because of the lack of an official map. This is because large part of the city doesn\u2019t have their names or house numbers yet. In the city center and in the more important parts of the city most streets have names and numbers. However, most people are friendly and will give you directions. Walking by foot between the different districts is not recommended, especially since most of the city's side walks are made out of loose cobblestone and is difficult to walk, also because the city is full of hills that can be tiring to walk. But if you want to have a good cardio-workout try it!\n \nSee\n \n*\n \n*\n \n*\n \nDo\n \nBuy\n \nAv. Amircal Cabral is the main street. Parallel to this, you have a pedestrian street with some shops including a Souvenir Shop. Normally close at 18 h.\n \nEat\n \n*A great place to eat local food and watch the world go by.\n \nDrink\n \nSleep\n \nBudget \n*Newly renovated bed & breakfast located in the heart of the city of Praia, known as Plateau, near the Presidential Palace.

Most crimes involve petty thievery and these are mostly focused on actual residents and not on tourists, although there have been a few cases which involved tourists. So Praia is still a very safe city, just be careful with flaunting any expensive jewelry or gadgets like iPhones and such. Cape Verde in the past few years has seen an increase of petty crimes which are done mostly by groups of young people so avoid groups of young men especially at night.\n \nPraia is also a badly illuminated city at night, so be careful in places that might not have street lights and is somewhat isolated, always travel in pairs or in groups for safety. However if anything does occur there are police stations in various parts of the city and a general hospital in the city center.\n \nThe stairs at the edge of Achada Santo Antonio towards Plateau are unsafe, also during the day, avoid that neighbourhood.\n \nAt night, take a taxi.\n \n \nCope\n \n \nEmbassies & Consulates\n \n* \n \n* \n \n* \n \n* \n \nGet out\n \n, the historic capital, is an easy half-day trip.\n \nYou can rent a car or ask for a full day tour (9 hours) for a round trip island."

Here you can buy everything from a side of beef to Led Zeppelin CD's. Goods here are slightly more expensive than in other parts of Peru, since Puerto Maldonado imports many goods from other parts of Peru and doesn't produce them themselves.\n*El Jaguar Zoo & Disco. Yes, you read that correctly. Puerto Maldonado has a modest zoo complete with local fauna, and at night the place is billed as a night club. Go get trashed with the brown capuchin monkeys at this place.\n*The Obelisk. An eight-story lookout tower that lets you go up for just a few soles, 3 soles as of October 7, 2014, . The outside of the obelisk has beautiful sculptures made by a local artist, telling a typical story about the jungle.

If this happens, just go back in the club. They stay open until about 5:00 in the morning, anyway.\n*Carambola. Another decent club on the street leading up the Capitania port.\n*Ruztika\u2019s.

The deep and diverse literary tradition at Venice is too extensive to cover comprehensively in short space, but we can get an overview of some of the most notable works associated with the city throughout history:",
                "However, tourism is by far the number one industry, and Venice is one of the most-visited tourist destinations on the planet. Specifically, it ranks 29 among world tourism cities and sees around 18 million visitors every year. The main draws are its beautiful architecture, numerous art collections and important historical landmarks.

                "Events\n*Carnival of Venice is one of the most popular carnivals of the world. First organised in 1926, it has been rivived from the 1980s to become a major destination for people wearing masks and costumes from any kind of era. 'Traditional' (i.e. pre-19th century styles) can be seen right next to anything that takes your fancy, be it self-styled dresses, steampunk or outfits modeled on fiction or manga templates. The original fascination of carneval came from people being hidden behind their masks, allowing them to cross social boundaries and disregard social norms for some time.\n*Festa del Redentore (Feast of the Redeemer) is held on the third Sunday of July. It commemorates the end of the plague in Venice in 1577. The feast is mostly known for the fireworks display which begins on Saturday night at 10pm which is admired by thousand of Venetians from their boats in St. Mark basin or from their terraces. After the display, which lasts about 40 minutes, the young people of Venice head to the Lido to wait for dawn. Three regattas are held on Sunday. Religious celebrations are held in the Church of the Holy Redeemr on Saturday at 7:30 pm and on Sunday at 12:30 am and 8 am.\n*La Biennale di Venezia is one of the most well known culture institutions. Two events organised by Biennale are the Art and Architecture International Exhibitions happening alternately (Architecture Biennale in even years, Art Biennale in odd) but other fields are also covered - contemporary theatre, dance, music, cinema. Biennale Architecture 2021 edition from May 22th to November 21st.\n*Regata 'Storica (Historic fleet event) is held on the first Sunday of every September. Celebrating a historic event from 1489, the regatta displays almost a hundred varieties of venetian boats from the city's rich past. Large oarships, replicating ancient roman and medieval vessels, are rowed along the Canal Grande, followed by many smaller boats. There are several races, including a master championship for solo sculling in streamlined gondolini, painted in unusual white, pink, etc. colours. There are many excellent photo opportunities for this event.\n*Venice International Film Festival - 78th edition, from 1st to 11th September 2021, will take place as usual in the island of Lido di Venezia. This is the oldest film festival of the world. Screenings will take place at Palazzo del Cinema on Lungomare Marconi and other nearby places such as the Venice Casino.\n*Voga Longa the yearly equivalent of a marathon run on water. Voga Longa competitors must row 32 kilometers under 3.5 hours to receive a certificate of attendance at the finish line, but everybody with a human-powered vessel is welcome to participate (some foreigner teams take up to 10 hours to complete the journey just for the fun of it). The official purpose of the Voga Longa was to protest the sharply increasing use of powerboats in Venice, but the event has gradually grown into a festival since 1974, with up to 5500 racers in 1500 vessels attending by the early 2000s. The racetrack visits different parts of Venice as well as some of the nearby islands. Locals and tourists lining up alongside rios and canals cheer the racers. Visitors wishing to participate should have serious experience in rowing or sculling and practice duely, as the journey is physically demanding (even seasoned oarsmen develop calluses by the finish line). The event is mainly for teams, completing Voga Longa on a single oar is considered a major achievement. Extreme participation (scuba frogmen and surface swimmers) sometimes occurs, but it is not recommended due to water contamination issues."

The city's Performing Arts Center is in downtown's Grand Theater, a fully restored 1,200 seat house dating from 1927. A recent expansion has created a facility that covers nearly an entire city block and attracts diverse talent. Recent performances included Mozart's Marriage of Figaro by the Bulgarian State Opera and concerts by Mannheim Steamroller and Blues legend B.B. King. See the Wausau Performing Arts Foundation web site for more information"

It is here where ancestry has an enduring processional into modern Chinese life. In the warmer months from spring through autumn, you will find droves of local families gathered in the early evening: parents line-dancing and waving over-sized fans to pounding traditional drums, grandparents dancing elegantly to what can be described as a form of Chinese waltz, and the kids playing badminton or hacky-sack with expert precision. Sometimes there may even be a stage performance. A sense of community thrives. The offerings vary nightly, but Town Hall is invariably fun. The people are warm, inclusive and welcoming of foreigners. Don't be surprised if you are suddenly motioned to join a waltz.\nFor the early birds, Town Hall is also the gathering spot for a morning ritual of Chinese meditative exercises at 7am. Join the locals in this tradition for maintaining good health and alignment of chi. Be forewarned: many elderly out-spry the young. While there is no public gauge of one's own limitations, it may be humbling to attempt the agility of the seasoned."

                "Do\n*The Botanic Garden is a nice place to go for a picnic, or just an afternoon walk. You can take the Cable Car from Lambton Quay for a quick 5-minute trip to the top; but it is not designed to be exciting, despite being photogenic. If you're keen on walking up, take the lifts in the The James Cook Arcade (or one of several others along Lambton Quay) up to The Terrace, head south uphill until you reach Salamanca Rd. Head uphill up Salamanca Rd until you reach Victoria University. A set of stairs on the opposite side of the road to the Hunter Lawn goes uphill right to the top of the Gardens. If you already shelled out for a Daytripper ticket, just catch the Mairangi bus, get off at the stop after the University, and walk back along Upland Rd until you reach the Cable Car Museum. At the top of the Gardens, there are several attractions:\n**The Cable Car Museum has two of the old cars in semi-restored and fully-restored condition and some of the original Cable Car machinery from the system that was replaced in 1978. \n**The Lookout has a great view day or night, and the large map next to the round tree usually has a few pamphlets with maps of the Gardens. \n**The Carter Observatory is a stones throw from here. This is the perfect place to explore the Garden from, or wander back to the city.\n*Bolton Street Memorial Park Watch out for the friendly black cat who haunts this hillside cemetery. If you're returning from the Botanic Gardens by foot, this is great place to meander through and check out the epitaphs of early pioneers and historical figures. \n* Mt Victoria Lookout. A visit to Wellington is not complete without checking out Wellingtons most popular lookout, offering stunning views across the city and harbour.\n*Red Rocks/ Seal Colony. This is an interesting walk named for its distinctive red rocks (probably Jasper). Take the number 1 bus to the end (Island Bay). Walk across the park towards the ocean and hang a right. There is another bus, number 4, that goes to the end of the road but only at certain times. Travel west (right side, if facing the water) until you run out of road. Here you will find a disused quarry and a visitors center (open daily from 10am - 6pm, later in summer). The walk along this beach is pleasant but rocky and often very windy, so dress accordingly. The road is shared (except Sundays) with 4WDs and other motor traffic. If one walks for about 1 hour you will come across a distinctive pass though the rock face. Just on the other side of this is a seal colony (in May-October)that is worth the walk. Please bear in mind that these are wild animals and so require a certain level of respect, so keep your distance and do not get between them and the sea, especially if you value your health! Continuing on from here, you will eventually arrive at Makara (but this is a long distance, and the seal colony is a recommended turn-around point).\n*Circa Theatre \n*Bats Theatre \n*Capital E National Theatre for Children \n*The Embassy Theatre \n*Beck's Incredible Film Festival.

Probably the world's most accessible dive wreck. Just a few kilometres around the coast from Wellington International Airport. Sunk on 13 November 2005 in 23 to 26 metres of water off Island Bay on Wellington's south coast. The wreck lies about 600 metres southeast of Taputeranga Island (the island of Island Bay) at 41&deg; 21'.270 S., 174&deg; 46'.770 E.\n*Take a ferry across the harbour to Eastbourne and Days Bay beach, or Somes island for a short hike. Go down to Queen's Wharf and check out the destinations and times.\n* Kaitoke Regional Park If you're feeling more adventurous, head north 30-40 minutes drive to the Kaitoke Regional Park, a hidden gem not as well known to tourists, but a popular spot for Wellingtonians. Take an easy paced walk through lush rainforest until you stumble across historic dams, the canopy bridge, and the \"Rivendale\" filming location from the Lord of the Rings movies. If it's a warm summers day or you're feeling brave, take a swim in the river or go kayaking.\n*Oriental Parade is Wellington's most beautiful street. Wellingtonians and visitors run, walk, cycle, rollerblade and eat at the great cafes & restaurants on this strip or sunbathe at the beach.",
