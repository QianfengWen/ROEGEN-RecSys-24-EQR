Also, due to the altitude, the capital is significantly colder than the coastal areas. Probably sensible to allocate no more than a couple of days to Tana.\nThere are actually a number of things to do in Tana and, if you can see beyond the poverty, the city is really attractive and a photographers dream. The architecture is a mix of French Countryside and Indonesia. Rice paddies scattered all over the city add a brilliant green to the pastel terracotta of the buildings. The market is wonderful offering many unique souvenirs and if you do not want to barter then try Lisy, a collection of shops with similar produce to the market at excellent prices. The Lemur Park, 45 minutes out of Tana, is well worth a visit and for gourmets there are some surprisingly good restaurants. \nTravel out of the capital is by two modes: road or air. Contrary to the main Madagascar article, as of 2005 there was no passenger rail service from the capital. Road transport is by bus to limited destinations, taxi-brousse (shared taxi) to a variety of destinations or by car rental (usually with driver). Although travel by taxi-brousse is guaranteed to try one's patience and sanity, there is quite possibly no better way to meet and interact with the locals and experience Madagascar as the Malagasy do. Air travel is the recommended method, due to the poor state of many roads, and Antananarivo is the hub city for the national carrier Air Madagascar. But of course air is more expensive.

It is a city which has changed dramatically in a decade due to this peace and prosperity and you will be greeted with warmth from locals who feel a new-found sense of pride in their city. Indeed, the old clich\u00e9 that you will be welcomed like an old friend by the patrons of Belfast's many pubs and bars is actually true, as the locals love to find out what draws you to their little part of the world and, of course, they like the chance to share a little bit of their history with you! Ask any local and they will tell you that a trip to Belfast will mean that you learn far more about the Irish and British psyche than a trip to a cheesy Irish pub in Dublin or on a tourist-orientated tour in .",
                "Those who live in Belfast tend to either absolutely love the city or loathe it, although the outsider's perspective tends to be more forgiving, as Belfast was voted the fourth best city in the UK for a city break in the Guardian/Observer travel awards. Needless to say, a visit to Belfast will be rewarded by a glimpse of a unique city that has finally begun to celebrate, rather than fight over, its place as a cultural meeting-point of Britain and Ireland. Belfast is certainly exhibiting an air of determined optimism, with new hotels, bars, restaurants, clubs and shops opening at an incredible rate. It is a city that is proud of its Victorian and Edwardian heritage and efforts to restore historic buildings are proving successful. Tourism is on the increase in Northern Ireland, especially among those seeking a weekend away or short break in Ireland as Belfast can offer a significantly cheaper and more rewarding alternative to the bigger, busier, more expensive and more tourist-driven ."

                "Splurge\n* Hotel St. Christophe, Place Bel'Ombra, is a 3-star hotel just up from the citadel with some great views and good service to boot. Rooms are clean, if a little small, with the newly-renovated first floor being somewhat bewildering in its layout. A good choice for couples, but slightly too small for a 3-person family, and almost impossible unless booking multiple rooms for 4 or more. Through most companies (Corsican Places, Holiday Options) you are entitled to eat at the restaurant every other day (or thereabouts), though by the end of the holiday this frequently becomes a chore rather than a pleasure. The breakfast, however, is simply amazing and is served until 10am and is constantly replenished. There are plenty of gizmos and gadgets to keep you occupied while you wait for your egg to boil; particularly the orange juice machine, which is a source of wonderment to all. In terms of food at breakfast, there is something for everyone, from cheese to waffles to (obviously) croissants. The coffee here is not excellent, so it is probably better to order chocolat (which is superb) or nab a paper and go down to U Pescadore for a coffee afterwards. Staff all speak good English and are friendly, though the maids have a disturbing tendency to burst into your room regardless of what you hang on the door. The clientele is mostly English and Scottish, which is superb for Brits who prefer to have a native base, though because of this you should not expect to get a sunbed by the small pool; towel antics abound, and recent '30 minutes only' rules have not eased this at all. However, due to Calvi's simply astounding main beach, there is no real need to frequent it. Prices are pretty expensive, though cheaper than rivals nearer the marina. Wi-Fi is available throughout the hotel, including in your room, though prices are absolutely ridiculous (EUR4 for 30 minutes, EUR8 for an hour, etc.)",

It is very hard work, especially during the 12-3pm period, with many steps and seemingly unendless cobbles, but there are some restaurants and shops to ease you and an art gallery halfway up. It is hard to recommend the citadel for its contents (though the 2nd Bn. Parachutistes of the Foreign Legion put on a show every year, discussed below, which is worth going to), but the views are simply amazing, especially at sunset.\n* Come during the 15 Ao\u00fbt, and you will be treated with the best fireworks show you have ever seen. Go to the main beach and you will see the show proper; each year has its own theme. We went in 2006 and saw the 'Apocalypse' themed show, which included fireworks evoking fire, brimstone (we were hit on the head numerous times by falling caps--not a great idea to sit on the street directly beneath it) and volcanic eruptions accompanied by loud, germanic classical music and an accompanying video projected onto its largest wall. In the daytime, the Parachutistes put on a show and do a jump from 15,000ft, landing in the sea. Best viewed from the bar U Cornu Marinu, if only under the pretense of avoiding flying boots.\n* L'Eglise Santa Maria is worth a visit; you can't miss it, it's the 'Big Pink Church'. It is a lovely old-style Catholic church evocative of the Orthodox style."

Kronick's estimates were not far behind in demonstrating the violence in Caracas, but they made evident the statistical errors of some NGOs. Robberies, assaults and kidnappings are very common, so it is recommended not to go out on the street with valuable items, keep cell phones out of sight of others while in public places, and avoid certain areas of Caracas. The latest security report of the United States Embassy is updated (January 2018). Previously, the districts of Chacao and Baruta were quite safe, but the situation has changed. In fact, kidnapping is very common in these districts, and tourists are not exempt from being kidnapped. The kidnappers demand sums of money that can reach 20 thousand dollars, or risk killing their victims. Las Mercedes and El Rosal are excellent alternatives for the most demanding tourists who have a comfortable budget to pay for line taxis or rent a car in the city. To walk the city and use public transport, the ideal area of \u200b\u200bthe city may be Sabana Grande, following the recommendations of the hotel, though this is a dice-roll in itself. The previously mentioned districts have safer areas than others and the hotel will provide you with the necessary information to make your stay in Caracas a pleasant one, though again, this can be seriously dicey due to the ongoing, unpredictable situation.

Musicals, comedies, dramas, concerts, and youth theater are common events. Shows run Thursdays through Sundays as a general rule\n* Go back to the mainland and see the shoreline. The drive (or boat ride) around Lake Erie takes you through the Working Waterfronts around NY, OH, MI, PA, , OH, and southern and is intermingled with beautiful preservations of flora and fauna as well as the history of North America's first westward expansion, the Old Northwest Territory.\n*\n*Situated on a peninsula starting from about four miles west of downtown and then going north and east approximately ten miles. Most of the lakeside of the peninsula is made up of sandy beaches. The bayside provides launching docks for boats and spots to fish. A fourteen-mile paved exercise and bike trail runs the entire length of the peninsula offering views of the lake beaches and wildlife refuges. Bicycles and boats are available for rental in and around the park. There is also a nature cruise starting near the Perry monument, on the southeastern side of the park. With free entry, copious parking, and miles of beaches, it's not hard to see why this park is the most visited state park in Pennsylvania, averaging over a million guests a year.\n*It is another great place to take the kids. Located immediately off of I-90 on Peach Street, this indoor waterpark operates year-round.\n*The Tom Ridge Environmental Center (TREC) is an educational center at heart, dedicated to teaching visitors about the unique 3,200 acres of Presque Isle and the many different forms of life that inhabit the peninsula. TREC also serves as a center for research, contributing to conservation efforts and promoting environmental awareness, helping to preserve the unparalleled beauty of Presque Isle, the site of Pennsylvania\u2019s only seashore. While some facilities along the Great Lakes offer environmental education and others do research, none offer research, education, and visitor services in one place, making TREC a unique destination for learning, wonder, and fun. We\u2019re open year-round and offer free admission to our interactive exhibits, glass-enclosed tower, and orientation movie.

Here's a rundown of the zones:\n*Zona 1 - Zona 1 is essentially the downtown of Guatemala City. This where you will most likely start your tour of the city as here are most of the tourist attractions. During the day you'll find many visitors seeing the sights and locals shopping, eating or working. It's ok to wander the zone during the day but stay in populated areas and don't enter side streets. At night avoid the zone COMPLETELY. Once shops close the area becomes deserted and dark. There are many cheap hotels and hostels here but it's better to stay in another a bit pricier but safer part of town. \n*Zona 10, 13, 14, 15 and 16 - Zones 10, 13, 14, 15 and 16 are essentially the \"safe\" areas of Guatemala where the upper middle class and wealthy citizens live. These areas are full of gated communities like Colonia Oakland, Colonia La Canada (where many foreign embassies are located) and others. Here are also the cities more reputable hotels aimed directly at tourists. \n*Zona 2, 4, and 17 - Zones 2, 4, 9 and 17 are the \"middle\" zones when it comes to crime. They are generally considered nice for tourists to stay but you should be more vigilant here at nighttime than in the safer aforementioned zones. You should always do more research when booking a hotel in Zona 2 and Zona 17 as some parts are much more dangerous than others. \n*Zona 3, 5..8, 11, 12, 17...21 - All the Zones from 5 to 8 and 17 to 21 along with Zona 3 and Zones 11-12 are very dangerous. Tourists SHOULD NOT go there at any time of day. These are the parts of the city where 80% of the violent crime happens as armed robberies and muggings are common even at noon. You should know too that some of these Zones (like the notorious Zona 3) are controlled by gangs who won't hesitate to shoot at you if you enter the area, even accidentally.",

The largest piece hung on the verge of a cliff and became the Huangguoshu Waterfalls, which, in the process of crashing down the cliff, broke into several dozen cascades. When the Milky Way fell, numerous stars came down with it, which were converted into stone forests, crystal-clear pools, bridges and caves.

It has since exploded with industry, attracting investment from Japanese, Korean, European and American companies. It is one of the most architecturally pleasing small cities in all of Guangdong, and one of the very richest.

It is about a 2.5 hour drive from Kigali and is a great day trip for wildlife viewing: giraffes, elephants, hippos, baboons, zebra, impala, etc. You can rent a car or go through a tour operator, which costs on average, $150 USD. You can hire a guide, a boat cruise, or stay the night at their lodge. There are three possibilities to stay overnight: camping (in the south and in the north camp sites), Akagera Game Lodge (mid-range) and Ruzizi Tented Camp (luxury).\n* Volcanoes National Park, home of the mountain gorillas, and the setting for author Dian Fossey's research. If you can afford it, it's an excellent experience, even possible as a day trip from Kigali. You can also take the \"Dian Fossey Trek\" or the \"Golden Monkey Trek\" for $75-100 USD. You might be able to see a gorilla group on one of these hikes if you're lucky. Inquire at the Rwandan Office for Tourism and National Parks (ORTPN), Boulevard de la R\u00e9volution n\u00b0 1, Kigali, +(250) 576514 or 573396, mailto:reservation@rwandatourism.com/ reservation@rwandatourism.com. $750 USD cash or Visa card. 50% discount for residents. Gorilla trekking in Volcanoes National Park requires a permit, now $1500 for non-EAC residents. This goes towards your entry, but supports conservation efforts at large in the park, as well as the local community. At the start of the trek, you'll be asked to indicate your fitness level - be very honest and err on the side of underselling yourself if needed. You'll be placed in a group accordingly, and the hikes can vary from rather easy 30 minute ascents up to 6-8 hours strenuous hikes. Guides and porters are more than willing to help but you don't want to have wasted your $1500 needing to call it quits before you get to the gorillas. The guides and porters are also very familiar and protective of both you and the gorillas. While the gorillas can get quite close - your guide and trackers will keep you safe - there has only ever been one incident and it involved a photographer brazenly ignoring the guide and trackers and antagonising the gorilla. There are tour providers that can get you out to Volcanoes for a day trip quite easily - though many of the visitors will stay in luxury lodges nearby to do multiple treks. \n* Gisenyi, also called Rubavu, is a city on the shores of Lake Kivu, right at the border of Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo. Gisenyi is as close you can get to a beach destination in Rwanda. The sandy public beach and the many resorts close to Bralirwa give you the seaside feeling you might be craving.\n* Kibuye is the other popular destination at Lake Kivu (besides Gisenyi), which has a very lake-side feeling. You can rent a boat and visit the nearby islands, including Napoleon Hat Island with its many fruit bats you can see up close. Kibuye also hosts Rwanda's Environmental Museum\n* Gishwati Forest National Park is Rwanda's newest park. It comprises pasture lands and many Eucaliptus plantations. If you want to visit a dairy farm or factory, this is the place to go.\n* Foret Naturelle de Mukura is officially part of the Gishwati National Park, but separated from the largest patch in the North. Mukura is a small natural forest boasting a small chimpanzee population. If you do not want to go all the way to Nyungwe for the Chimps, you can visit them at Mukura on your way to Kibuye.\n* Musanze is the gateway to the Volcanoes National Park and the treks to see the gorillas. However, Musanze also offers several caves for all enthusiasts, from tourist-friendly to specialists. Visits are organised through the RDB and previous booking is required (they often organise tours at 2pm, calling them in the morning is usually enough). Tours start at the RDB office at Kinigi (same place where gorilla tours start).\n* Twin lakes Burera and Ruhondo are between Kigali and Musanze and make for a nice weekend break. There are camp sites and resorts available around the lakes, and even on an island in lake Burera. Views from lake Ruhondo are very popular as looking towards the lake one has the sun setting behind the volcanoes in the background. You can stay overnight at the Foyer de Charite or Ruhondo Lake Resort, overlooking lake Ruhondo and the volcanoes.\n* Lake Muhazi is the standard get-away day-trip. Only 45 minutes from Kigali either North on the road to Uganda, or East on the way to Rwamagana. Muhazi is a bilharzia-full lake (so no swimming), but it has several nice resorts on its shore. Near Rwesero you have Rwesero Resort, or cross the lake to Kingfisher resort, boasting a pool with a view mid-way up the hill. Mid-way on the northern short you have Jambo beach and Sisters of Peace resorts.\n* Nyanza was the capital of the Kingdom of Rwanda from 1958 to 1962. The old Royal Palace of the Rwandan monarchy is located in the town of Nyanza.",

The park contains 13 primate species (25% of Africa's total), 275 bird species, 1068 plant species, 85 mammal species, 32 amphibian and 38 reptile species.\n* Nyiragongo volcano just across the border in the DRC is potentially one of the most impressive destinations in the Great Lakes region. This 2-day hike (5-6 hours up, 3 hours down) rewards you with a night spent on the edge of an active bubbling magma lake and amazing views over Goma, Gisenyi and Lake Kivu. It is a must-see!\n* Idjwi Island in the middle of Lake Kivu rewards you with a peaceful weekend in the DRC. Unlike any of the crazy stories elsewhere in the DRC, Idjwi is characterised by its peaceful and calm people. A tour organised by Yves takes you around the island, shows you local businesses and culture, pygmy villages, and maybe even the King!"

Since most of Killeen dates from the 1940s or later, there are not many historic buildings.

Available from the Tourist office. It includes unlimited rides on the public transport network, free or reduced entry fees to major museums and exhibitions, and one guided tour per day per person (Vieux Lyon, Croix-Rousse, etc.). The price is still a bit high, so count before you buy to see if this is a good deal considering your plans.",

As time goes by, the city also becomes more and more welcoming for pedestrians and cyclists.

It is most famous for its place in the novel The Comte de Monte-Cristo by Alexandre Dumas. Tourist boats leave from the Vieux Port for a 15-minute ride. The boats do get full, especially on a weekend, so if you want to leave on a specific boat, you're advised to arrive an hour before the trip to buy the tickets (they are issued for a specific time). Then you can kill the time before the ride by visiting the nearby attractions; a Notre Dame church is around 15 minutes away by foot if you are good at walking uphill. Both the island and the castle are small, and everything there can be seen and photographed in 20 minutes. But due to the boat schedules you will spend at least an hour there until the boat picks you up, so don't rush. There are no shops there, so pack your lunch and drinks. A toilet is available. Both the castle and the island offer very limited access to wheelchair users. The entrance to the Castle costs 6 Euro. The whole exhibition is focused on the Count of Monte-Cristo novel, so unless you're a fan, plan your time differently.\n* It was designed by Le Corbusier. The building is called \"la maison du fada\" (the house of the foolish) by local people. The building contains a shopping street, a church, a children's school, and housing. You can access the roof and enjoy the breathtaking view of Marseille between the hills and sea (10am-6pm). There is a bar, restaurant, hotel on the 3rd floor too.

Take bus 114/115 (linea 3) on Sarmiento, just west of the Plaza Independencia, (or Parque San Martin on Av Del Libertador) to El Challao Mirador, at the end of the line 8km to the northwest. There is a clear turnaround at the end of the bus line where you get off. From there walk across from the white nightclub (which is slightly downhill from the road) following the dyke 100 metres, then take an unpaved track further west until you reach a small restaurant / mountaineering museum/ clubhouse - then follow the track to the north (going through the gate). This is a popular hike for Mendocinos at the weekend, but during the week it may be deserted. You can treat yourself to a hearty asado at the restaurant - although beware that restaurant has two menus, one more expensive than the other! From the Mirador the hike is about a 3.5 hour round trip. Get out of the area well before dark. In the summer, go early to avoid the worst of the heat, and in the winter bring a jacket, as it can be cool and windy at the top. Afterwards you could visit the aircraft hanger sized church in Challao, a local version of Lourdes.\n* The best way to reach the other side of the Andes and Santiago is to take a scenic 7 hour bus ride through the beautiful Andes Mountains. On the way you will see nice countryside before the reach of clouds in the stunning Andes Mountains, which actually stretch from Mendoza to Santiago. On the border awaits passport and luggage control post.\n* There is a nice golf field at the San Martin park, where residences Golf Club Andino.\n* This activity takes no longer than one day, in the mountain ranges of the pre-mountain range near our city, without having to go too far, there are places with a unique beauty. Usually national park has an intricate network of lesser-known day hikes. Torres del Paine's W Trek is world famous, but many people don't know that most of this route can be cut into three one-day hikes.\n* Every hotel, hostel and travel agent can organize horse riding trips close to the city - but these guys have one of the better reputations - can do day and overnight rides, look after their animals and speak good English. A late afternoon ride, with a return at sunset will enable you to avoid the heat of the day and night-riding is very atmospheric. If you phone them direct you will get a lower price compared to organizing through a hostel.\n* It is an exclusive spa located at Park Hyatt Mendoza. Spa was created to promote well-being through its luxurious pampering and relaxation services. \n* The Kite School in Potrerillos, 50 km from Medoza, which has 3 levels of instruction course.\n* The official sightseeing tour bus of Mendoza City, it was originally released around mid 2013. It's really good, if you want to take a quick look around the city. The full tour it's about 2 hours. Bus fees, route and times are on its web.\n* Enjoy this sort of activity on the rugged landscape, what makes it one of the best mountain biking destinations. The mountains around are breathtaking and there is so much to see. \n* It can be done in Mendoza every day of year, depending on the winds of course. Tours include a tandem flight of about 15 minutes with an experienced pilot. There are two companies going off Cerro Arco, both easily googleable: \"zonadevuelo\" (aka Fly Excursion) and \"flyadventure\"(aka mendoaventuras).\n* This sport is popular in the winter, but the season is short. Closest are Penitientes (bigger) and Los Puquios (beginner) on the highway almost to the Chile border. You could either take the Espreso Uspallata milkruns, or by bus tickets or packages from the many agencies on Las Heras Street, between Mitre and Peru streets, where there are also lots of ski equipment and clothes rental shops.\n* Cacheuta, located about an hour outside of Mendoza, has a very large network of heated outdoor pools called the \"Parque del Agua\". For easy transportation, enquire regarding Cacheuta at the Bus Terminal, Buttini bus counter at the immediate south side of the terminal near platform 55. Buses depart from Mendoza about 9am and return in the evening. The last bus departing Cacheuta at 18:50 - but be aware that there are no buses back to Mendoza between approximately 3pm and the last bus. It is recommended that you purchase both directions before departing. If you're in for the full day adventure, consider bringing some food to cook on their plentiful and free grills. An upscale alternative is to go for the day to the Termas Hotel, about a km before\", with swanky pools, masseuses, jacuzzi and an incredible buffet lunch, but well worth the value - if you go, you would better book at the hotel a few days before for the package (do not bother staying at the hotel, the overpriced rooms are very cramped.\n* Mendoza city has wonderful theaters for your choice of different repertoire.\n* Mendoza area has many trekking routes. There could be routing by circuits or one way trekking. The best places to trek are: in Villa Gral Belgrano, Patagonia, Torres del Paine, Cerro Arco or trekking through Cerro Llao llao. Just remember to study them well before going. Ask the locals about a guide hiring.\n* Potrerillos Dam is one of the best places in the world to do these activities. It is the venue for international championships.",

To return, look for the Nagasaki Terminal (\u9577\u5d0e\u30bf\u30fc\u30df\u30ca\u30eb) buses, which usually run hourly until 9.

                "Do\nNaples has an abundance of attractions and activities that await its annual tourists. There is no way to list them all here, but below are some of the most popular things to do in Naples:\n* The beaches of Naples are located on the eastern and western edges of the city. Eastern beaches are characterized by dark sand. La Gaiola Beach on the western coast is one of the most beautiful Neapolitan beaches as well as less affected by urban influence and contamination. There are nice rocky beaches in Lido Marechiaro, Bagno Elena, or private Rocce Verdi beach. Miseno Beach already has a sandy shore.\n* The history of cinema in Naples begins at the end of the 19th century the first of which was the Panorama of Naples Harbor. Over time, many cinematographic works have been recorded, production houses have been established, many notable filmmakers have been born, and many prizes have been won. Over the decades the Neapolitan capital has also been used as a film set for many works, over 600 according to the Internet Movie Database. When you go to the cinema, never forget that Tot\u00f2 is an icon of Naples, the \u201cprince of jokes\u201d who made hundreds laugh. Recognize and visit locations where many films were created\n* \n* Any small idea can be generated into a tour. Naples is full of different attractions.\n* Naples is full of surprises and secrets. It\u2019s a city with bizarre superstitions.\n* \n* Football is the most popular sport in Naples. This sport is deeply rooted in the local culture: it is popular at every level of society, from street children to wealthy professionals. The city's best-known football club is SSC Napoli.\n* A fun 1.5-hour tour through the old Greek and Roman city and aqueducts buried under the modern city; also includes some WWII history as this area was used as a bomb shelter. Tours in English leave M-F 12, 2, and 4 (and 9 PM on Thurs), Sa-Su 10, 12, 2, 4, and 6; see New York Times article. (Note: The nearby San Lorenzo Maggiore also has underground ruins of the old Roman market, but they are much less extensive and there is typically no guide).\n* Naples has many great theatres. First of all, the most famous and prestigious Theater in the world San Carlo, an opera house in Naples opened in 1737. Seeing an opera in this theatre is a unique experience, a show inside the show. The other less prestigious Napulitana (Neapolitan songs), Teatro Bellini (Performing arts), Teatro Augusteo (Performing arts), and Palapartenope Theater.\n* The Spaccanapoli course stands out for its color and noise, which is interesting because it divides the city of Naples into two parts. From there, travel to St. Severus Chapel (Cappella Sansevero), which preserves a famous 18th-century masterpiece of the Neapolitan sculptor Giuseppe Sanmartino - \"Veiled Christ \" (Cristo Velato). The sculpture depicting the dead Christ wrapped in a veil is still a mystery to sculpture fans, who cannot find an explanation as to how the author managed to get such a thin veil out of marble; Walk along the seashore: Via Nazario Sauro, Via Partenope, and Via Francesco Caracciolo. Or you can make the route Via dei Mille, via Filangieri, and via Chiaia which are three of the more elegant and rich streets.",

Its territory, particularly the iconic sight of the Gulf of Naples (but also Mount Vesuvius, the music, etc.) is arguably one of the most powerful symbolic images of Italy."

Trolleybus #5 goes into the heart of Odesa. \n*Malibu - is a beach at Luzanivka neighborhood, easily reachable by numerous bus routes which link the city centre with the Kotovskoho village section of Odesa. Malibu is the cleanest beach on the sea shore with excellent service similar to ones in Arcadia.\n*Lustdorf - This beach is located in the South of the City. It is small but cozy and there are not many touristic restaurants. But perfect if you just want to relax and escape the big city rush. You can use Tram 3 from the main train station. The line terminates at \u041b\u044e\u0441\u0442\u0434\u043e\u0440\u0444 (Lustdorf). After you get off, just go down the street or follow the crowd. Tram 27 and Bus 220 also stop at Lustdorf.

The city is located in the southern end of Santiago Island and has year round good weather. The city is divided into various small unofficial districts, the most important ones being, Plateau (city center), Achada Santo Antonio, Palmarejo, Fazenda, Achada Grande, Varzea, Safende, Sucupira(bazaar area), Calbeciera, Terra Branca, Vila Nova, Achadinha, Bairro, Prainha, Monte Vermelho, Achada Mato, Achada Sao Felipe, and other smaller ones. Most part of the city are residential areas, so probably not worth visiting in itself, but worth a half-day exploration if you are passing through to another destination.\n \nThe center of the city lies on a plateau overlooking the bay to the southeast. The airport lies a few kilometers to the northeast.\n \nGet in\n \nPraia has an international airport. TACV (national flag carrier) and TAP airlines fly to various destinations in Europe, Africa, South America and United States. Taxis from the airport to Plateau cost 800/1000. You can pay in Euros (10\u20ac to Praia in June 2016). There is one bus line that serves the airport but it\u2019s better to just take a taxi since there is actually only one or two buses that serves this line. You can also enter the city through the port. There are ferry boats that have irregular service to and from the islands of Maio, Boavista, Sal and Sao Nicolau, and more regular and scheduled service to and from Sao Vicente and Fogo. You can exchange money at hotel (1 \u20ac= 105 Escudos) or in the city (1 \u20ac= 110 \u20ac in June 2016).\n \nGet around\n \nThe city has countless bus stops, and taxis are everywhere waiting for customers. There are two main bus companies that serve the city, Moura Company and Sol Atlantico. Each route has their own numbers. The main lines are from Safende to Achada Santo Antonio, Vila Nova to Achada Santo Antonio, Calbeceira to Palmarejo, Pensamento to Terra Branca, Achada Grande to Achada Santo Antonio, Sao Felipe to Plateau, Ponta D'Agua to Plateau,Achada Mato to Palmarejo. Most of these lines pass by Plateau (city center), Varzea and Terra Branca, the bus fair is about 35 escudos. When it comes to taxis you should be careful with illegal taxis that sometimes roam around and might rip you off. The normal taxi fare between two furthest points of the city shouldn\u2019t be more 1500 escudos in daytime and 1800 escudos at night time, example Pensamento to Palmarejo, or Palmarejo to Achada Mato. Taxi drivers usually expect to get a tip, give around 50 escudos to 100 escudos. Just be careful and always drive with the taxis that have a taximeter, so that they don\u2019t overcharge you.\n \nThe city doesn\u2019t really have a good way to navigate because of the lack of an official map. This is because large part of the city doesn\u2019t have their names or house numbers yet. In the city center and in the more important parts of the city most streets have names and numbers. However, most people are friendly and will give you directions. Walking by foot between the different districts is not recommended, especially since most of the city's side walks are made out of loose cobblestone and is difficult to walk, also because the city is full of hills that can be tiring to walk. But if you want to have a good cardio-workout try it!\n \nSee\n \n*\n \n*\n \n*\n \nDo\n \nBuy\n \nAv. Amircal Cabral is the main street. Parallel to this, you have a pedestrian street with some shops including a Souvenir Shop. Normally close at 18 h.\n \nEat\n \n*A great place to eat local food and watch the world go by.\n \nDrink\n \nSleep\n \nBudget \n*Newly renovated bed & breakfast located in the heart of the city of Praia, known as Plateau, near the Presidential Palace. Friendly staff, very clean and quiet rooms. Breakfast included. \n \nMid-range\n \n* In Praiha, south of the centre of town near the beaches\n \n*\n \n*\n \n*\n \n*This three star hotel is a bit past its prime, but is bright and clean.\n \nSplurge\n \nPraia's high-end options are located south of the main town in the area of Prainha.\n \n* 10min to centre of the Praia. 5km from the airport.\n \n* Decrepit infrastructure, outrageously overpriced. \n \nStay Safe\n \nBeing the capital and biggest city of the country, Praia has a higher crime rate than most parts of the country. Most crimes involve petty thievery and these are mostly focused on actual residents and not on tourists, although there have been a few cases which involved tourists. So Praia is still a very safe city, just be careful with flaunting any expensive jewelry or gadgets like iPhones and such. Cape Verde in the past few years has seen an increase of petty crimes which are done mostly by groups of young people so avoid groups of young men especially at night.\n \nPraia is also a badly illuminated city at night, so be careful in places that might not have street lights and is somewhat isolated, always travel in pairs or in groups for safety. However if anything does occur there are police stations in various parts of the city and a general hospital in the city center.\n \nThe stairs at the edge of Achada Santo Antonio towards Plateau are unsafe, also during the day, avoid that neighbourhood.\n \nAt night, take a taxi.\n \n \nCope\n \n \nEmbassies & Consulates\n \n* \n \n* \n \n* \n \n* \n \nGet out\n \n, the historic capital, is an easy half-day trip.\n \nYou can rent a car or ask for a full day tour (9 hours) for a round trip island."

Associated with the local community, this company does a lot to keep ecotourism 'green' and sustainable. And for those who really want to experience the richness of the forest, you can go right out to the famous TRC research center (about 7 hours by boat from Infierno), home to the largest claylick in the world where you will see amazing displays of parrots and macaws feeding in the mornings and always plenty of animal life around! Hand-raised macaws will even join you for breakfast! Highly recommended for birdwatchers.

The lack of people and the closeness to the Andes produces an abundance of flora and fauna not seen in other areas of the amazon. \n*Wasai Puerto Maldonado Eco Lodge The hotel is in the most convenient location on the river bank,offering spectacular views of the Madre de Dios River and the amazon rain forest.\n*Anaconda Lodge One of the few pretty lodges that on the outskirts of the city, surrounded by beautiful vegetation. Boasts a swimming pool and a Thai restaurant, and also offers camping. \n*Sandoval Lake Lodge This one is very special because it is on the beautiful oxbow Lake Sandoval, and is very comfortably accommodated with hot water, electricity, fabulous meals, and superb guides. Plus, it is only approximately 30 minutes by boat to the 5km trail which leads to the lake, unlike most of the other lodges which need to be hours away from town in order to see wildlife. Its location on the lake (as opposed to the river) insures excellent wildlife views including the Giant Otter, Black Caimen, about a dozen species of primates, and tremendous avian variety, including the fascinating Hoatzin.\n*Mejia Family Lodge If a backpacker's stay is more your style and/or budget, try this place.

You're pretty much on your own to discover this fascinating city. Make the most of your time there.\n* Santo Domingo was the first major european settlement in the New World. Christopher Columbus walked these streets! Check out the many examples of 15th and 16th century architecture in the Colonial Zone. Don't miss the Ozama Fort, the Alcazar de Colon and the Cathedral, all built in Columbus' lifetime. You can also check beautiful churches and convents, such as the Iglesia Regina Angelorum and the Convento de los Dominicos. Don't miss the Panteon Nacional, where the national heroes are buried, located in the Calle Las Damas, the New World's first (European) street! Also, walk up the Calle del Conde, a very old pedestrian shop-lined street that used to be the commercial heart of the city. This street leads to the Puerta de la Independencia, where the Dominican Republic proclaimed its independence from Haiti, and the Parque Independencia, where the country's founding fathers' remains are kept. On Sunday evenings, check out the Ruinas de San Francisco for live bands playing Merengue, Bachata, Salsa and Son, in a wonderful weekly show where both locals and tourists dance, drink and enjoy themselves. This would be an unforgettable experience! Also check out La Atarazana street after dark for a variety of romantic outdoor cafes with a spectacular view of the Alcazar and bay area. One such brasserie, Pat E Palo, has operated uninterrupted since 1505. Check out the house where Ponce DeLeon lived before he embarked upon his quest for the fountain of youth and ended up discovering Florida.\n* This waterfront boulevard is home to several huge hotel/casino complexes and dozens of small restaurants, clubs and cafes. Go there to people watch, take a romantic carriage ride or just have a few beers. Site of many festivals and concerts throughout the year. Parallel to the Malecon you will find Avenida Independencia, a tree lined street full of shops, bed and breakfasts and affordable restaurants with a nice mix of locals and tourists. For a unique dining experience check out Adrian Tropical, a traditional Dominican restaurant literally built on the water, or San Gil, a more formal eatery occupying the ruins of a colonial fort. The Malecon Center, located on the far end of the Malecon, is a new and still underoccupied high-end shopping center/hotel/condo complex with a Botero sculpture out front that reportedly cost US$1 million.\n* This amazing complex is home to the National Theater and five museums, ranging from the dilapidated and mundane, to the crisp, modern Museum of Modern Art the largest in the Caribbean and home to exhibits by artists from Jamaica, Bahamas, Puerto Rico, and of course, the Dominican Republic. If want a nice beautiful garden to read or talk this is your place also. \n* Find your way to the Parque Mirador Sur, an impressive park overlooking the coast. It gets closed for cars on weekdays between 5 and 8 am and pm, as well as on Sundays, enabling it to get filled with families playing with their children and exercising. Bike rentals are at your disposal.\nAlso, you can visit the Jardin Botanico, a vast, beautiful and lush park situated near one of Santo Domingo's most exclusive neighborhoods. There you can experience different ecosystems from a rain-forest to a Japanese garden!\n* Referred to as Santo Domingo Oriental, this separate municipality is not very tourist-friendly. Fortunately, most of its attractions are very close to the Colonial Zone and easy to get to. Check out Los Tres Ojos, or Three Eyes, a series of open-roof caverns and underground lakes for the whole family to explore (with a local this part of Santo Domingo is the most poverty stricken and can be dangerous!!!!). Head over to the Faro a Colon, a huge lighthouse and monument to Christopher Columbus which not only houses his remains but doubles as a museum. Check out the Santo Domingo Aquarium, a small but impressive showcase of the local aquatic life. If you're looking for some shopping, you can go to the Megacentro, Santo Domingo's largest shopping mall. It is massive!",

Be cautious of touts who begin friendly conversations and soon inform you of the upcoming Royal Wedding at the City Palace. Be assured - there is no such event, nor will it be attended by various celebrities from your home country. Their aim is to bring you to a tailor's shop sell you an overpriced outfit for the evening. Touts can be persistent and may follow you around, particularly around the Jagdish Temple and Gangaur Ghat. Hotel proprietors insist they are not dangerous, and there is no harm in engaging with them in friendly conversation, but also recommend you not reveal too many personal details or information about your plans/hotel, and to simply get into a tuk-tuk at any point if you feel uncomfortable."

The two are linked with newly-constructed pedestrian-only Northern Avenue. The Main Avenue (standard South European Corso) is still under construction (for the last 60 years, although on a greater scale during the last couple of years) and will eventually reach the hill on which the historical Kond district rests. Kentron is also home to the University City, where the campuses of State University, Medical University, Engineering University, Agricultural University, Economics University, Pedagogical and some other universities come together in one big group.

Antalya had replaced Phaselis\u2014beautiful ruins of which now lie to south of the city, between and \u2014as the main harbour of the surrounding region during the reign of Seljuks, in early 1200s, but the lack of a large hinterland (or, rather, lack of good connections with its mountainous hinterland) meant for much of its history eversince that it was a provincial coastal town, albeit with a multicultural community of Muslims, Christians, and Jews. As the centre of a region with beautiful beaches, verdant mountains, and a mindblowing number of ancient ruins, the tourism investments started in 1970s, which changed the fate of the city considerably. However, as most of the visitors (make no mistake\u2014they are in the range of millions annually) to the region are actually on \"all-inclusive\" vacation packages nowadays, they are immediately taken from the airport to the huge resorts lining the coastline of hundreds of kilometres, where they stay until the end of their holidays except perhaps a raid or two to the nearest and the most popular attractions, so Antalya itself, especially the old town (Kalei\u00e7i), is more of an independent traveller destination, where you will meet the other travellers of a similar mind, and the locals.",

Being a package offering, they can end up being relatively cheap. All of the hotels fall into the Splurge category.",

Lara to the east of the city has many 4/5 star beach hotels that cater for the all inclusive holiday market. Both are good options, depending on what you are looking for.

Probably sensible to allocate no more than a couple of days to Tana.\nThere are actually a number of things to do in Tana and, if you can see beyond the poverty, the city is really attractive and a photographers dream.

Although travel by taxi-brousse is guaranteed to try one's patience and sanity, there is quite possibly no better way to meet and interact with the locals and experience Madagascar as the Malagasy do.

Couples can sit on the balcony outside, enjoying a great view overlooking either the citadel or the Place Bel'Ombra, but are subject to the elements somewhat (the wind is felt most in this part of town). Service is particularly English-friendly as all of the waiters and waitresses are foreign, mostly from Slovakia but also from Senegal and other French ex-colonies, so a good choice for those who speak no French at all.\n*Grand Hotel, Boulevard Wilson, serves decent food at a high-price; but the view from its 8th-floor restaurant panoramique is simply amazing, and may well be worth it if you are not on a strict budget.",
                "Splurge\n* Hotel St. Christophe, Place Bel'Ombra, is a 3-star hotel just up from the citadel with some great views and good service to boot. Rooms are clean, if a little small, with the newly-renovated first floor being somewhat bewildering in its layout. A good choice for couples, but slightly too small for a 3-person family, and almost impossible unless booking multiple rooms for 4 or more. Through most companies (Corsican Places, Holiday Options) you are entitled to eat at the restaurant every other day (or thereabouts), though by the end of the holiday this frequently becomes a chore rather than a pleasure. The breakfast, however, is simply amazing and is served until 10am and is constantly replenished. There are plenty of gizmos and gadgets to keep you occupied while you wait for your egg to boil; particularly the orange juice machine, which is a source of wonderment to all. In terms of food at breakfast, there is something for everyone, from cheese to waffles to (obviously) croissants. The coffee here is not excellent, so it is probably better to order chocolat (which is superb) or nab a paper and go down to U Pescadore for a coffee afterwards. Staff all speak good English and are friendly, though the maids have a disturbing tendency to burst into your room regardless of what you hang on the door. The clientele is mostly English and Scottish, which is superb for Brits who prefer to have a native base, though because of this you should not expect to get a sunbed by the small pool; towel antics abound, and recent '30 minutes only' rules have not eased this at all. However, due to Calvi's simply astounding main beach, there is no real need to frequent it. Prices are pretty expensive, though cheaper than rivals nearer the marina. Wi-Fi is available throughout the hotel, including in your room, though prices are absolutely ridiculous (EUR4 for 30 minutes, EUR8 for an hour, etc.)",
                "See\n* The Citadel is worth at least one visit. It is very hard work, especially during the 12-3pm period, with many steps and seemingly unendless cobbles, but there are some restaurants and shops to ease you and an art gallery halfway up. It is hard to recommend the citadel for its contents (though the 2nd Bn. Parachutistes of the Foreign Legion put on a show every year, discussed below, which is worth going to), but the views are simply amazing, especially at sunset.\n* Come during the 15 Ao\u00fbt, and you will be treated with the best fireworks show you have ever seen. Go to the main beach and you will see the show proper; each year has its own theme. We went in 2006 and saw the 'Apocalypse' themed show, which included fireworks evoking fire, brimstone (we were hit on the head numerous times by falling caps--not a great idea to sit on the street directly beneath it) and volcanic eruptions accompanied by loud, germanic classical music and an accompanying video projected onto its largest wall. In the daytime, the Parachutistes put on a show and do a jump from 15,000ft, landing in the sea. Best viewed from the bar U Cornu Marinu, if only under the pretense of avoiding flying boots.\n* L'Eglise Santa Maria is worth a visit; you can't miss it, it's the 'Big Pink Church'. It is a lovely old-style Catholic church evocative of the Orthodox style."

The city sits along Lake Michigan, one of the five Great Lakes, which has and outlet to the Atlantic Ocean via the St. Lawrence Seaway, thus making Chicago a global port city. Chicago sits along the freshwater Great Lakes so it doesn't experience the droughts and water shortages that many other cities experience. There are no laws in Chicago restricting water usage upon its citizens as those laws are not needed due to the abundant supply of fresh water. In fact, the city has so much fresh water bestowed on it, that it sells water to other nearby cities and towns. Chicago has many great attractions in its huge central/downtown area, and lots of Chicagoans live and play outside of the central area as well. Travelers also go to the city's vibrant neighborhoods to soak up the local nightlife, sample the wide range of fantastic dining, and see other sights that are a part of Chicago. Thanks to the city's massive public transit system, which includes over 140 Chicago Transit Authority elevated and subway stations, a separate city and suburban rail network called Metra, and bus routes criss-crossing the city every few blocks apart, all parts of Chicago are indeed accessible. Portions of the city's elevated/subway network operate nonstop, 24 hours around the clock each day, making Chicago, New York City, and Copenhagen the only cities in the world to offer any 24 hour rail service where trains run nonstop throughout the entirety of their respective city limits.",

However, if you have a specific interest in mind, there are hotels throughout the city, and getting away from downtown will give you more of a sense of other neighborhoods. You'll appreciate that if you're in town for more than a couple of days. Make sure that where you're staying is within your comfort level before committing to stay there, though.

This where you will most likely start your tour of the city as here are most of the tourist attractions. During the day you'll find many visitors seeing the sights and locals shopping, eating or working. It's ok to wander the zone during the day but stay in populated areas and don't enter side streets. At night avoid the zone COMPLETELY. Once shops close the area becomes deserted and dark. There are many cheap hotels and hostels here but it's better to stay in another a bit pricier but safer part of town. \n*Zona 10, 13, 14, 15 and 16 - Zones 10, 13, 14, 15 and 16 are essentially the \"safe\" areas of Guatemala where the upper middle class and wealthy citizens live. These areas are full of gated communities like Colonia Oakland, Colonia La Canada (where many foreign embassies are located) and others. Here are also the cities more reputable hotels aimed directly at tourists. \n*Zona 2, 4, and 17 - Zones 2, 4, 9 and 17 are the \"middle\" zones when it comes to crime. They are generally considered nice for tourists to stay but you should be more vigilant here at nighttime than in the safer aforementioned zones. You should always do more research when booking a hotel in Zona 2 and Zona 17 as some parts are much more dangerous than others. \n*Zona 3, 5..8, 11, 12, 17...21 - All the Zones from 5 to 8 and 17 to 21 along with Zona 3 and Zones 11-12 are very dangerous. Tourists SHOULD NOT go there at any time of day. These are the parts of the city where 80% of the violent crime happens as armed robberies and muggings are common even at noon.

Gorilla trekking in Volcanoes National Park requires a permit, now $1500 for non-EAC residents. This goes towards your entry, but supports conservation efforts at large in the park, as well as the local community. At the start of the trek, you'll be asked to indicate your fitness level - be very honest and err on the side of underselling yourself if needed. You'll be placed in a group accordingly, and the hikes can vary from rather easy 30 minute ascents up to 6-8 hours strenuous hikes. Guides and porters are more than willing to help but you don't want to have wasted your $1500 needing to call it quits before you get to the gorillas. The guides and porters are also very familiar and protective of both you and the gorillas. While the gorillas can get quite close - your guide and trackers will keep you safe - there has only ever been one incident and it involved a photographer brazenly ignoring the guide and trackers and antagonising the gorilla.

You can rent a boat and visit the nearby islands, including Napoleon Hat Island with its many fruit bats you can see up close. Kibuye also hosts Rwanda's Environmental Museum\n* Gishwati Forest National Park is Rwanda's newest park. It comprises pasture lands and many Eucaliptus plantations. If you want to visit a dairy farm or factory, this is the place to go.\n* Foret Naturelle de Mukura is officially part of the Gishwati National Park, but separated from the largest patch in the North. Mukura is a small natural forest boasting a small chimpanzee population.

However, Musanze also offers several caves for all enthusiasts, from tourist-friendly to specialists. Visits are organised through the RDB and previous booking is required (they often organise tours at 2pm, calling them in the morning is usually enough). Tours start at the RDB office at Kinigi (same place where gorilla tours start).\n* Twin lakes Burera and Ruhondo are between Kigali and Musanze and make for a nice weekend break. There are camp sites and resorts available around the lakes, and even on an island in lake Burera. Views from lake Ruhondo are very popular as looking towards the lake one has the sun setting behind the volcanoes in the background. You can stay overnight at the Foyer de Charite or Ruhondo Lake Resort, overlooking lake Ruhondo and the volcanoes.\n* Lake Muhazi is the standard get-away day-trip. Only 45 minutes from Kigali either North on the road to Uganda, or East on the way to Rwamagana. Muhazi is a bilharzia-full lake (so no swimming), but it has several nice resorts on its shore. Near Rwesero you have Rwesero Resort, or cross the lake to Kingfisher resort, boasting a pool with a view mid-way up the hill. Mid-way on the northern short you have Jambo beach and Sisters of Peace resorts.\n* Nyanza was the capital of the Kingdom of Rwanda from 1958 to 1962.

It is a true multicultural town; its people are very welcoming and will show you the true aspects of the city.\nThe Majestic and Centre Culturel Fran\u00e7ais (next to Mbolo, the main supermarket) provide both cinema and game rooms; also occasional expositions and concerts.\nIf you'd like to relax on a nice deserted beach, you could go to the Cap Esterias or to Cap Santa Clara, about 30 minutes by car from Libreville. Shared taxis to Cap Esterias leave from the roundabout two kilometers beyond the airport.\nThe Pointe Denis is another popular spot. It is a peninsula across the bay, close to Libreville. The boat trip takes 25 minutes and cost somewhat between 15 and 20 euros (10 000 and 15 000 fcfa) from the Michel Marine(Navette \"Orangina\"), Navettes \"Beaufort\", \"Castel\" and \"Internet\".

If you want to\nmake a trip to a reserve or a remote area, ask for a special expedition package and\nplan to pay much more and spend a few days for the transfer to and from the reserve.\nRio Negro is an area that is great for the jungle vegetation and for the lack of\nmosquitoes (due to the acidity of the river). Unfortunately, the lack of mosquitoes\nmeans there are a lot fewer animals that live there. The South of Rio Amazonas\nis a network of rivers, lakes and channels. There are mosquitoes and wildlife, however,\nthere are quite a lot of houses and farms -- and thus\ncivilization is a lot more visible. Most tours go to or through lake . There are\nquite a lot of jungle things to see around the lake, but do not expect pristine nature\ndue to all the farming going on around the lake. There is a reserve nearby called\n.

Eastern beaches are characterized by dark sand. La Gaiola Beach on the western coast is one of the most beautiful Neapolitan beaches as well as less affected by urban influence and contamination. There are nice rocky beaches in Lido Marechiaro, Bagno Elena, or private Rocce Verdi beach. Miseno Beach already has a sandy shore.\n* The history of cinema in Naples begins at the end of the 19th century the first of which was the Panorama of Naples Harbor. Over time, many cinematographic works have been recorded, production houses have been established, many notable filmmakers have been born, and many prizes have been won. Over the decades the Neapolitan capital has also been used as a film set for many works, over 600 according to the Internet Movie Database. When you go to the cinema, never forget that Tot\u00f2 is an icon of Naples, the \u201cprince of jokes\u201d who made hundreds laugh. Recognize and visit locations where many films were created\n* \n* Any small idea can be generated into a tour. Naples is full of different attractions.\n* Naples is full of surprises and secrets. It\u2019s a city with bizarre superstitions.\n* \n* Football is the most popular sport in Naples. This sport is deeply rooted in the local culture: it is popular at every level of society, from street children to wealthy professionals. The city's best-known football club is SSC Napoli.\n* A fun 1.5-hour tour through the old Greek and Roman city and aqueducts buried under the modern city; also includes some WWII history as this area was used as a bomb shelter. Tours in English leave M-F 12, 2, and 4 (and 9 PM on Thurs), Sa-Su 10, 12, 2, 4, and 6; see New York Times article. (Note: The nearby San Lorenzo Maggiore also has underground ruins of the old Roman market, but they are much less extensive and there is typically no guide).\n* Naples has many great theatres. First of all, the most famous and prestigious Theater in the world San Carlo, an opera house in Naples opened in 1737. Seeing an opera in this theatre is a unique experience, a show inside the show. The other less prestigious Napulitana (Neapolitan songs), Teatro Bellini (Performing arts), Teatro Augusteo (Performing arts), and Palapartenope Theater.\n* The Spaccanapoli course stands out for its color and noise, which is interesting because it divides the city of Naples into two parts. From there, travel to St. Severus Chapel (Cappella Sansevero), which preserves a famous 18th-century masterpiece of the Neapolitan sculptor Giuseppe Sanmartino - \"Veiled Christ \" (Cristo Velato). The sculpture depicting the dead Christ wrapped in a veil is still a mystery to sculpture fans, who cannot find an explanation as to how the author managed to get such a thin veil out of marble; Walk along the seashore: Via Nazario Sauro, Via Partenope, and Via Francesco Caracciolo.

                "is 's capital and busiest city. Settlements in Praia started in the 1615 which then became capital of the country in the year 1770. The city is located in the southern end of Santiago Island and has year round good weather. The city is divided into various small unofficial districts, the most important ones being, Plateau (city center), Achada Santo Antonio, Palmarejo, Fazenda, Achada Grande, Varzea, Safende, Sucupira(bazaar area), Calbeciera, Terra Branca, Vila Nova, Achadinha, Bairro, Prainha, Monte Vermelho, Achada Mato, Achada Sao Felipe, and other smaller ones. Most part of the city are residential areas, so probably not worth visiting in itself, but worth a half-day exploration if you are passing through to another destination.\n \nThe center of the city lies on a plateau overlooking the bay to the southeast. The airport lies a few kilometers to the northeast.\n \nGet in\n \nPraia has an international airport. TACV (national flag carrier) and TAP airlines fly to various destinations in Europe, Africa, South America and United States. Taxis from the airport to Plateau cost 800/1000. You can pay in Euros (10\u20ac to Praia in June 2016). There is one bus line that serves the airport but it\u2019s better to just take a taxi since there is actually only one or two buses that serves this line. You can also enter the city through the port. There are ferry boats that have irregular service to and from the islands of Maio, Boavista, Sal and Sao Nicolau, and more regular and scheduled service to and from Sao Vicente and Fogo. You can exchange money at hotel (1 \u20ac= 105 Escudos) or in the city (1 \u20ac= 110 \u20ac in June 2016).\n \nGet around\n \nThe city has countless bus stops, and taxis are everywhere waiting for customers. There are two main bus companies that serve the city, Moura Company and Sol Atlantico. Each route has their own numbers. The main lines are from Safende to Achada Santo Antonio, Vila Nova to Achada Santo Antonio, Calbeceira to Palmarejo, Pensamento to Terra Branca, Achada Grande to Achada Santo Antonio, Sao Felipe to Plateau, Ponta D'Agua to Plateau,Achada Mato to Palmarejo. Most of these lines pass by Plateau (city center), Varzea and Terra Branca, the bus fair is about 35 escudos. When it comes to taxis you should be careful with illegal taxis that sometimes roam around and might rip you off. The normal taxi fare between two furthest points of the city shouldn\u2019t be more 1500 escudos in daytime and 1800 escudos at night time, example Pensamento to Palmarejo, or Palmarejo to Achada Mato. Taxi drivers usually expect to get a tip, give around 50 escudos to 100 escudos. Just be careful and always drive with the taxis that have a taximeter, so that they don\u2019t overcharge you.\n \nThe city doesn\u2019t really have a good way to navigate because of the lack of an official map. This is because large part of the city doesn\u2019t have their names or house numbers yet. In the city center and in the more important parts of the city most streets have names and numbers. However, most people are friendly and will give you directions. Walking by foot between the different districts is not recommended, especially since most of the city's side walks are made out of loose cobblestone and is difficult to walk, also because the city is full of hills that can be tiring to walk. But if you want to have a good cardio-workout try it!\n \nSee\n \n*\n \n*\n \n*\n \nDo\n \nBuy\n \nAv. Amircal Cabral is the main street. Parallel to this, you have a pedestrian street with some shops including a Souvenir Shop. Normally close at 18 h.\n \nEat\n \n*A great place to eat local food and watch the world go by.\n \nDrink\n \nSleep\n \nBudget \n*Newly renovated bed & breakfast located in the heart of the city of Praia, known as Plateau, near the Presidential Palace.

Most crimes involve petty thievery and these are mostly focused on actual residents and not on tourists, although there have been a few cases which involved tourists. So Praia is still a very safe city, just be careful with flaunting any expensive jewelry or gadgets like iPhones and such. Cape Verde in the past few years has seen an increase of petty crimes which are done mostly by groups of young people so avoid groups of young men especially at night.\n \nPraia is also a badly illuminated city at night, so be careful in places that might not have street lights and is somewhat isolated, always travel in pairs or in groups for safety. However if anything does occur there are police stations in various parts of the city and a general hospital in the city center.\n \nThe stairs at the edge of Achada Santo Antonio towards Plateau are unsafe, also during the day, avoid that neighbourhood.\n \nAt night, take a taxi.\n \n \nCope\n \n \nEmbassies & Consulates\n \n* \n \n* \n \n* \n \n* \n \nGet out\n \n, the historic capital, is an easy half-day trip.\n \nYou can rent a car or ask for a full day tour (9 hours) for a round trip island."

Be the change you want to see! \n*Rainforest Expeditions Many package deals are done in association with this company, but you can just walk over to their counter on the right hand side of the airport and arrange your own tour there too. You can stay at any of their 3 lodges, Posada Amazonas is the closest to town (about 45 minutes by boat from Infierno), for those who want to experience the jungle without getting in too deep! Associated with the local community, this company does a lot to keep ecotourism 'green' and sustainable. And for those who really want to experience the richness of the forest, you can go right out to the famous TRC research center (about 7 hours by boat from Infierno), home to the largest claylick in the world where you will see amazing displays of parrots and macaws feeding in the mornings and always plenty of animal life around! Hand-raised macaws will even join you for breakfast! Highly recommended for birdwatchers.

Plus, it is only approximately 30 minutes by boat to the 5km trail which leads to the lake, unlike most of the other lodges which need to be hours away from town in order to see wildlife. Its location on the lake (as opposed to the river) insures excellent wildlife views including the Giant Otter, Black Caimen, about a dozen species of primates, and tremendous avian variety, including the fascinating Hoatzin.\n*Mejia Family Lodge If a backpacker's stay is more your style and/or budget, try this place.

You're pretty much on your own to discover this fascinating city. Make the most of your time there.\n* Santo Domingo was the first major european settlement in the New World. Christopher Columbus walked these streets! Check out the many examples of 15th and 16th century architecture in the Colonial Zone. Don't miss the Ozama Fort, the Alcazar de Colon and the Cathedral, all built in Columbus' lifetime. You can also check beautiful churches and convents, such as the Iglesia Regina Angelorum and the Convento de los Dominicos. Don't miss the Panteon Nacional, where the national heroes are buried, located in the Calle Las Damas, the New World's first (European) street! Also, walk up the Calle del Conde, a very old pedestrian shop-lined street that used to be the commercial heart of the city. This street leads to the Puerta de la Independencia, where the Dominican Republic proclaimed its independence from Haiti, and the Parque Independencia, where the country's founding fathers' remains are kept. On Sunday evenings, check out the Ruinas de San Francisco for live bands playing Merengue, Bachata, Salsa and Son, in a wonderful weekly show where both locals and tourists dance, drink and enjoy themselves. This would be an unforgettable experience! Also check out La Atarazana street after dark for a variety of romantic outdoor cafes with a spectacular view of the Alcazar and bay area. One such brasserie, Pat E Palo, has operated uninterrupted since 1505. Check out the house where Ponce DeLeon lived before he embarked upon his quest for the fountain of youth and ended up discovering Florida.\n* This waterfront boulevard is home to several huge hotel/casino complexes and dozens of small restaurants, clubs and cafes. Go there to people watch, take a romantic carriage ride or just have a few beers. Site of many festivals and concerts throughout the year. Parallel to the Malecon you will find Avenida Independencia, a tree lined street full of shops, bed and breakfasts and affordable restaurants with a nice mix of locals and tourists. For a unique dining experience check out Adrian Tropical, a traditional Dominican restaurant literally built on the water, or San Gil, a more formal eatery occupying the ruins of a colonial fort. The Malecon Center, located on the far end of the Malecon, is a new and still underoccupied high-end shopping center/hotel/condo complex with a Botero sculpture out front that reportedly cost US$1 million.\n* This amazing complex is home to the National Theater and five museums, ranging from the dilapidated and mundane, to the crisp, modern Museum of Modern Art the largest in the Caribbean and home to exhibits by artists from Jamaica, Bahamas, Puerto Rico, and of course, the Dominican Republic. If want a nice beautiful garden to read or talk this is your place also. \n* Find your way to the Parque Mirador Sur, an impressive park overlooking the coast. It gets closed for cars on weekdays between 5 and 8 am and pm, as well as on Sundays, enabling it to get filled with families playing with their children and exercising. Bike rentals are at your disposal.\nAlso, you can visit the Jardin Botanico, a vast, beautiful and lush park situated near one of Santo Domingo's most exclusive neighborhoods. There you can experience different ecosystems from a rain-forest to a Japanese garden!\n* Referred to as Santo Domingo Oriental, this separate municipality is not very tourist-friendly. Fortunately, most of its attractions are very close to the Colonial Zone and easy to get to. Check out Los Tres Ojos, or Three Eyes, a series of open-roof caverns and underground lakes for the whole family to explore (with a local this part of Santo Domingo is the most poverty stricken and can be dangerous!!!!). Head over to the Faro a Colon, a huge lighthouse and monument to Christopher Columbus which not only houses his remains but doubles as a museum. Check out the Santo Domingo Aquarium, a small but impressive showcase of the local aquatic life. If you're looking for some shopping, you can go to the Megacentro, Santo Domingo's largest shopping mall. It is massive!",
                "Santo Domingo offers a variety of cuisines from around the world from Chinese, Italian and Mediterranean to Brazillian. You can also find the main fast food franchises like McDonalds, Burger King, Pizza Hut, Wendy\u2019s, Taco Bell, among others."

The festival is especially meant for women and offers the best time when they dress in their finest clothes and join the celebrations of the fest. To conduct the ceremony, women assemble to dress the images of Isar (Lord Shiva) and Gangaur (Goddess Parvati). After dressing the idols, they carry them in a traditional procession passing through different parts of the city. In the last, the procession makes its move towards the Gangaur Ghat at Pichola Lake. At this point, the images are transported into special boats and immersed in the deep waters of the lake.

Be assured - there is no such event, nor will it be attended by various celebrities from your home country. Their aim is to bring you to a tailor's shop sell you an overpriced outfit for the evening. Touts can be persistent and may follow you around, particularly around the Jagdish Temple and Gangaur Ghat. Hotel proprietors insist they are not dangerous, and there is no harm in engaging with them in friendly conversation, but also recommend you not reveal too many personal details or information about your plans/hotel, and to simply get into a tuk-tuk at any point if you feel uncomfortable."

This is the heart of Yerevan and indeed Armenia. Though Kentron's architecture is diverse, ranging from Belle Epoque to Soviet Panel blocks, the great majority of the centre is in Beaux-Arts tradition. Downtown Yerevan follows Tamanyan's plan for a circular city with two hubs - grand Republic Square, and the more elegant and soft Opera district (Opera house, Freedom Square and the Swan Lake Park). The two are linked with newly-constructed pedestrian-only Northern Avenue. The Main Avenue (standard South European Corso) is still under construction (for the last 60 years, although on a greater scale during the last couple of years) and will eventually reach the hill on which the historical Kond district rests. Kentron is also home to the University City, where the campuses of State University, Medical University, Engineering University, Agricultural University, Economics University, Pedagogical and some other universities come together in one big group. Virtually all of the museums, hotels and popular places to eat and drink are in Kentron, so most visitors will probably not venture much past it.",

An increasingly cosmopolitan population has helped (every third inhabitant is a foreigner), as well, though more button-down remains Switzerland's most culturally heterogeneous city.
