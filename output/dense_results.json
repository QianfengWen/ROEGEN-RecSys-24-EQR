Consecrated by the appearance of Devi Sita, Ram Tirth had been a witness to the birth of the sons of King Rama. Making a special place in the holy scripts of ancient religions, the place was once the ashrama of saint Valmiki. The saint is believed to have scripted many of his sacred manuscripts at this place. A hut of Rishi Balmiki is still found at Ram Tirth where he once lived. After giving birth to Luv and Kush, Devi Sita used to stay at this place for a considerable period of time. The evidence of her stay still exists in the form of a well which, it is believed, was dug by Hanuman. Devotees of King Rama and Devi Sita flock to this place every year to offer their prayers to the respected deities. As the locational position of the Ram Tirth is facilitated by easy accessibility, hence, visitors conveniently reach this place of worship without any extra hassles.\n*Sher e Punjab.

Settlements in Praia started in the 1615 which then became capital of the country in the year 1770. The city is located in the southern end of Santiago Island and has year round good weather. The city is divided into various small unofficial districts, the most important ones being, Plateau (city center), Achada Santo Antonio, Palmarejo, Fazenda, Achada Grande, Varzea, Safende, Sucupira(bazaar area), Calbeciera, Terra Branca, Vila Nova, Achadinha, Bairro, Prainha, Monte Vermelho, Achada Mato, Achada Sao Felipe, and other smaller ones. Most part of the city are residential areas, so probably not worth visiting in itself, but worth a half-day exploration if you are passing through to another destination.\n \nThe center of the city lies on a plateau overlooking the bay to the southeast. The airport lies a few kilometers to the northeast.\n \nGet in\n \nPraia has an international airport. TACV (national flag carrier) and TAP airlines fly to various destinations in Europe, Africa, South America and United States. Taxis from the airport to Plateau cost 800/1000. You can pay in Euros (10\u20ac to Praia in June 2016). There is one bus line that serves the airport but it\u2019s better to just take a taxi since there is actually only one or two buses that serves this line. You can also enter the city through the port. There are ferry boats that have irregular service to and from the islands of Maio, Boavista, Sal and Sao Nicolau, and more regular and scheduled service to and from Sao Vicente and Fogo. You can exchange money at hotel (1 \u20ac= 105 Escudos) or in the city (1 \u20ac= 110 \u20ac in June 2016).\n \nGet around\n \nThe city has countless bus stops, and taxis are everywhere waiting for customers. There are two main bus companies that serve the city, Moura Company and Sol Atlantico. Each route has their own numbers. The main lines are from Safende to Achada Santo Antonio, Vila Nova to Achada Santo Antonio, Calbeceira to Palmarejo, Pensamento to Terra Branca, Achada Grande to Achada Santo Antonio, Sao Felipe to Plateau, Ponta D'Agua to Plateau,Achada Mato to Palmarejo. Most of these lines pass by Plateau (city center), Varzea and Terra Branca, the bus fair is about 35 escudos. When it comes to taxis you should be careful with illegal taxis that sometimes roam around and might rip you off. The normal taxi fare between two furthest points of the city shouldn\u2019t be more 1500 escudos in daytime and 1800 escudos at night time, example Pensamento to Palmarejo, or Palmarejo to Achada Mato. Taxi drivers usually expect to get a tip, give around 50 escudos to 100 escudos. Just be careful and always drive with the taxis that have a taximeter, so that they don\u2019t overcharge you.\n \nThe city doesn\u2019t really have a good way to navigate because of the lack of an official map. This is because large part of the city doesn\u2019t have their names or house numbers yet. In the city center and in the more important parts of the city most streets have names and numbers. However, most people are friendly and will give you directions. Walking by foot between the different districts is not recommended, especially since most of the city's side walks are made out of loose cobblestone and is difficult to walk, also because the city is full of hills that can be tiring to walk.

Most crimes involve petty thievery and these are mostly focused on actual residents and not on tourists, although there have been a few cases which involved tourists. So Praia is still a very safe city, just be careful with flaunting any expensive jewelry or gadgets like iPhones and such. Cape Verde in the past few years has seen an increase of petty crimes which are done mostly by groups of young people so avoid groups of young men especially at night.\n \nPraia is also a badly illuminated city at night, so be careful in places that might not have street lights and is somewhat isolated, always travel in pairs or in groups for safety. However if anything does occur there are police stations in various parts of the city and a general hospital in the city center.\n \nThe stairs at the edge of Achada Santo Antonio towards Plateau are unsafe, also during the day, avoid that neighbourhood.\n \nAt night, take a taxi.\n \n \nCope\n \n \nEmbassies & Consulates\n \n* \n \n* \n \n* \n \n* \n \nGet out\n \n, the historic capital, is an easy half-day trip.\n \nYou can rent a car or ask for a full day tour (9 hours) for a round trip island."]], "Presque Isle": [0.20053588285757926, ["Drink", "Get out"]], "Pretoria": [0.19677686512740095, ["Get in", "* Reliable shuttle service, tours and transport.", "Do", "Outdoors\n* Walk, mountainbike, go on a 4x4 drive or stay over in the second oldest nature reserve in the world.

Parking monitors gives tickets to scooters parked on the main roads. It costs NT 20 per hour to park on main roads around Feng Chia Night Market. If you drive a car, finding a place to park on the street is almost impossible, so you\u2019ll have to park in one of the many pay lots in the area. You can\u2019t miss them because they have people with flashlights trying to wave you in. Parking costs NT50 to park for the entire evening. However you go to Feng Chia Night Market, you should go there early because the later you go there, the more crowded it is. \nFirst, you may want to get something to drink. You can buy taro ball tea at KOI tea shop on Fu-Xhin Road. It is delicious! Another choice is winter melon tea on Qing-He St. Winter melon tea is a Taiwanese specialty. It is not too sweet. You might also try ice black tea with tapioca pearls at Happiness Ice Black Tea on Wenhua Road. They use crushed ice in their drinks so they stay cold for a long time, and the pearls are very delicious because their tapioca pearls are handmade. It is really worthwhile to try it. \nNext, we suggest that you walk around and visit various specialty shops while you enjoy your drink. There is a special vendor that sells decorative items made from colored wire. They will make one with your name or an image such as the island of Taiwan or an animal shape. These are made to be used as key chains or cell phone fobs. These are all made by hand, so they are very unique. They are also nice gifts or souvenirs. After you tell them what you want, your selection will be ready in about an hour.\nNow it is snack time. First, you should try Wu Tsay Sau between Alley 28 and Alley 10 on Feng Chia Road LN.20. The sign says \u65b0\u9bae\u70cf\u8cca + \u6d77 \u9bae\u71c9\u98ef=\u70cf\u8cca\u71d2. This means cuttlefish + squid with rice = cuttlefish squid. Because they only sell one thing, all you have to do is tell them how many you want. It will cost you NT55. Another choice is a store named Ying Mu Ding. It is near the Wu Tsay Sau store on Alley 10 of Feng Chia Road LN.20. They take fried noodles and some Chinese cabbage and serve it in a white bread roll. It is a really delicious snack.\nAfter having some snacks, you can visit Feng Chia University to take a rest. You can enjoy your snack and do some people watching. It is a really big campus, and many people use the campus as a public park. You can watch students playing basketball, visit the bookstore, or just walk around. \nFinally, maybe you\u2019d like to enjoy a late dinner. One special restaurant is named Do What on Lane 150 of Wenhua Road. They sell some Western foods such as spaghetti and chicken with rice. They also sell a variety of snacks. The real reason to go there is to play the games they have there. The games are all from Western countries. If you lose at the games, the restaurant has many strange punishments, such as wearing an Afro wig or big eyeglasses, or word cards with punishment sentences written on them.

According to some 2022 Travel books it is now up to \u20ac5) (cash only, preferably coins!) for tourists (70 cents for locals) - you can then say you went in a gondola, even if it was only for a couple of minutes!

There is also a combined pass for museums, churches and transportation only available at the tourist information office but it is relatively expensive.Remember that churches are active religious centres.

Price of admission, which includes the audioguide, is \u20ac12 (as of Feb 2023).", "Canal water rides", "* If a gondola seems a little pricey, the alternative to cross the Grand Canal by traghetto is much more cheaper. They are stripped down and used as municipal ferries. In the 1950's there were as many as thirty, but now there are seven points to find them. However some only operate when people are going to and from work. The length of any crossing is just a few minutes. Many visitors enjoy visiting the open air markets near the Rialto Bridge and there is a traghetto station there, at the Pescheria (fish market) joining the Santa Sophia church along the Strada Nova. You will notice that traghetti passengers tend to stand up, but if you are not comfortable doing so, sitting is possible, if you are careful. To be more adventurous, you can try the venetian rowing style through \"Row Venice\" area or one of the many rowing clubs. Take of your backpack before getting on and while on board as it inhibits your balance and might hit others when making sudden moves.\n* Take a Gondola if you can afford it: it's expensive, but the Gondoliere may decrease the price if you ask (but they can also decrease the time...). Make sure you reach an agreement on price and time before you start! A good tip with the Gondolieres is to bargain the price down as low as you can, then say that it's still too much and walk away. Two or three of them will chase after you, one after the other, each offering a lower price than the last. It's possible to knock \u20ac20-\u20ac30 off the price(even then, be prepared to shell out \u20ac80). Gondola rides are always costly, often in a princely way and that expense should be planned in advance of the visit. If you go as a group it might be cheaper, though the number of people who can be accommodated on a gondola varies, usually up to a maximum of six seated passengers. The \"traghetti\" holds more, mostly standing, as a pair of gondoliers rows short distances for canal crossing purposes at a number of points along the Grand Canal. All gondoliers must be male and most are born locals. There are only a few Germans in the business and a single lady, Alexandra Hai, who couldn't manage a for-hire license even after 10 years. She is officially allowed to carry guests of their contract hotel only.\n* Ride a Vaporetto down the Grand Canal right before sunset. The Vaporettos are not cheap, but the sights are priceless: amazing architecture, soft seaside sunlight, and a fascinating parade of Venetian watercraft.\n* While going through Venice, make sure you take in the beauty of it all. Walk through the alley ways or take the water taxi to different parts of the island, sometimes at night you can just go sit in an open area and watch locals and tourists passing by. It is wonderful.
