Most locals tend to restrict outdoor activities from 1-5pm when the heat is at its worst, staying indoors in air-conditioned spaces, while those who have no choice use sunscreen and try to stay hydrated. Temperatures almost always surpass 90\u02daF (32\u02daC), occasionally reaching 95\u02daF (35\u02daC), and the humidity which seats at around 70% can make the atmosphere suffocating at times. Houston also doesn\u2019t receive the slightly cooling winds from the Gulf of Mexico like Galveston which allows temperatures to surpass 100\u02daF (38\u02daC) a few days per year. A thing to watch out for during this time of the year are bugs and especially mosquitoes. Thunderstorms are common in Houston during summertime as are hurricanes. Houston is one of the most vulnerable cities in the US when it comes to hurricanes, with the main concern being flooding. The city was severely damaged by Tropical Storm Allison in 2001 and Hurricane Harvey in 2017 which became the costliest hurricane to ever hit the USA,(tied with Katrina), with more than 50 inches of rain in late August. Houston also received a direct blow from Hurricane Ike in 2008. If a hurricane approaches Houston during your stay your best choice is to evacuate or follow safety procedures by the local authorities if you choose to stay. In the days prior to Hurricane Rita, which actually missed Houston, an estimated 2.5 \u2013 3.7 million people evacuated the Texas coastline, and a significant heat wave affected the region. The combination of severe gridlock and excessive heat led to between 90 and 118 deaths - many of them on gridlocked freeways -even before the storm was due to arrive, and eventually landed in eastern Texas and Louisiana. Reports from the Houston Chronicle indicated 107 evacuation-related fatalities."

You can hire a guide, a boat cruise, or stay the night at their lodge. There are three possibilities to stay overnight: camping (in the south and in the north camp sites), Akagera Game Lodge (mid-range) and Ruzizi Tented Camp (luxury).\n* Volcanoes National Park, home of the mountain gorillas, and the setting for author Dian Fossey's research. If you can afford it, it's an excellent experience, even possible as a day trip from Kigali. You can also take the \"Dian Fossey Trek\" or the \"Golden Monkey Trek\" for $75-100 USD. You might be able to see a gorilla group on one of these hikes if you're lucky. Inquire at the Rwandan Office for Tourism and National Parks (ORTPN), Boulevard de la R\u00e9volution n\u00b0 1, Kigali, +(250) 576514 or 573396, mailto:reservation@rwandatourism.com/ reservation@rwandatourism.com. $750 USD cash or Visa card. 50% discount for residents. Gorilla trekking in Volcanoes National Park requires a permit, now $1500 for non-EAC residents. This goes towards your entry, but supports conservation efforts at large in the park, as well as the local community. At the start of the trek, you'll be asked to indicate your fitness level - be very honest and err on the side of underselling yourself if needed. You'll be placed in a group accordingly, and the hikes can vary from rather easy 30 minute ascents up to 6-8 hours strenuous hikes. Guides and porters are more than willing to help but you don't want to have wasted your $1500 needing to call it quits before you get to the gorillas. The guides and porters are also very familiar and protective of both you and the gorillas. While the gorillas can get quite close - your guide and trackers will keep you safe - there has only ever been one incident and it involved a photographer brazenly ignoring the guide and trackers and antagonising the gorilla. There are tour providers that can get you out to Volcanoes for a day trip quite easily - though many of the visitors will stay in luxury lodges nearby to do multiple treks. \n* Gisenyi, also called Rubavu, is a city on the shores of Lake Kivu, right at the border of Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo. Gisenyi is as close you can get to a beach destination in Rwanda. The sandy public beach and the many resorts close to Bralirwa give you the seaside feeling you might be craving.\n* Kibuye is the other popular destination at Lake Kivu (besides Gisenyi), which has a very lake-side feeling. You can rent a boat and visit the nearby islands, including Napoleon Hat Island with its many fruit bats you can see up close. Kibuye also hosts Rwanda's Environmental Museum\n* Gishwati Forest National Park is Rwanda's newest park. It comprises pasture lands and many Eucaliptus plantations. If you want to visit a dairy farm or factory, this is the place to go.\n* Foret Naturelle de Mukura is officially part of the Gishwati National Park, but separated from the largest patch in the North. Mukura is a small natural forest boasting a small chimpanzee population. If you do not want to go all the way to Nyungwe for the Chimps, you can visit them at Mukura on your way to Kibuye.\n* Musanze is the gateway to the Volcanoes National Park and the treks to see the gorillas. However, Musanze also offers several caves for all enthusiasts, from tourist-friendly to specialists. Visits are organised through the RDB and previous booking is required (they often organise tours at 2pm, calling them in the morning is usually enough). Tours start at the RDB office at Kinigi (same place where gorilla tours start).\n* Twin lakes Burera and Ruhondo are between Kigali and Musanze and make for a nice weekend break. There are camp sites and resorts available around the lakes, and even on an island in lake Burera. Views from lake Ruhondo are very popular as looking towards the lake one has the sun setting behind the volcanoes in the background. You can stay overnight at the Foyer de Charite or Ruhondo Lake Resort, overlooking lake Ruhondo and the volcanoes.\n* Lake Muhazi is the standard get-away day-trip. Only 45 minutes from Kigali either North on the road to Uganda, or East on the way to Rwamagana. Muhazi is a bilharzia-full lake (so no swimming), but it has several nice resorts on its shore. Near Rwesero you have Rwesero Resort, or cross the lake to Kingfisher resort, boasting a pool with a view mid-way up the hill. Mid-way on the northern short you have Jambo beach and Sisters of Peace resorts.\n* Nyanza was the capital of the Kingdom of Rwanda from 1958 to 1962.

This in turn means the city supports numerous restaurants, coffee shops and supermarkets that cater to this demographic. The country is also rapidly developing, with huge infrastructure and construction projects expanding rapidly, taking advantage of the country's stable peace period. Residents are quite openly proud of the progress the country has made and are widely supportive of it.

This 2-day hike (5-6 hours up, 3 hours down) rewards you with a night spent on the edge of an active bubbling magma lake and amazing views over Goma, Gisenyi and Lake Kivu. It is a must-see!\n* Idjwi Island in the middle of Lake Kivu rewards you with a peaceful weekend in the DRC. Unlike any of the crazy stories elsewhere in the DRC, Idjwi is characterised by its peaceful and calm people.

Fort Hood, the largest military base in the world, borders the northern and western edges of town. If you can get on base (you must be with or related to military personnel or civil service worker), there is a good Cavalry Museum to see, and you can drive down Battalion Avenue, which is lined with barracks and Army buildings, to get a glimpse of life on a military reservation. Since most of Killeen dates from the 1940s or later, there are not many historic buildings. There is, however, a nice little chapel dating from 1882 (Bethel Primitive Baptist Church), that offers scheduled tours, and there are a number of turn-of-the-century buildings and small shops lining North 2nd Street in the downtown area. If you are an Elvis fan you can check out the house he lived in while he was stationed at Fort Hood."

From there follow the cliff along a man-made path that picks up many spectacular views and passes many items of natural interest. In due course this path arrives at the Sante rollerway, a contraption of dual rails and a 2 person car that descends through the forest. It's a worthwhile ride, as it is time for a rest and the opportunity to be grateful that the primitive braking system works. The cliffside walk continues until far below it reaches a suspension bridge and a chairlift back up to the mountain.

Take a bus from Jiujiang Intercity Bus Station to Haihui. This bus travels initially south east on a concrete highway which swings south west. After about 27km on your right hand side looms the fantastic peaks of Lushan, named Five Old Men. The bus driver must know that you want to get off to walk to the 3 Step Waterfall, which is in the precinct of Haihui. It means you will dropped on the side of the road, so take the side turning toward the mountains, past a village, past a dam, and on up the concrete road. When the first park entry check point is spotted, go back a bit and walk up the track beside the creek, and then along a water pipe (balance required over the gullies) until you are well passed this pay point. Continue back on the road until the road arrives at a small village and the footpath bridges the creek at a weir and continues upstream on the other side. There will be increasing numbers of coach delivered tourists around. About 300 metres up this track is another paypoint, about Y50, which can be bypassed by a very silent and strenuous climb over the huge rocks in the creek bed. You can go back and progress up the other side of the creek until you have to get into the creek bed and deal with the huge rocks. Either that or pay the Y50. The stone path now climbs through the valley, up, ever up through a spectacular gorge to the Three Step Waterfall, where suddenly it's like Disneyland in the mountains with duck shaped watercraft in the bottom pond to the waterfall, kiosks and masses of people, who have descended by foot to this spectacular spot from the top cable car station high above. Continue up the path, until you see the paypoint for visitors to the mountain proper, fee approx Y130. Go back about 100 metres down to a right turn junction in the path in a SE direction. This stone path contours around to underneath the top fall of the Three Step Waterfall. There is an old path that actually goes under the waterfall; take it. Climb over the man made impediments of barbed wire and stakes, and continue on a narrow path of indeterminate age, but which is now closed to all but you. This path is in derelict condition, and safety barriers are largely missing, so your party should be comfortable with overgrown passage and exposure to great heights. However it's a great walk with marvellous views and environment and definitely secluded from the masses. This overgrown path, sometimes hard to recognise, follows over the heads of the \"Five Old Men\" the 4000' plus summits originally visible from the road, now far below. After a couple of hours this path joins the main park system, where one finds one's way finally to a road and therefore transport to the the centre of Guling. In the writers experience there was a cab waiting, for the 15 minute drive past the colonial era villas. The whole journey is well worth the effort (for those of you on this wavelength).",

It was originally built up by British colonialists as a summer hill station, and still bears evidence of their architecture (both real and obviously contrived). It still makes for a refreshing escape from the summer heat, and offers many scenic hiking opportunities and some historic buildings, particularly of interest for fans of Communist Party history. It is very popular with the better heeled Chinese tourist, but well off the beaten path for independent foreign travellors and accordingly you should expect some communication difficulties. It is hoped it was enjoyed by Chairman Mao, as his visage in cane chair features in front of the many picturesque spots, with more than a little assistance from Photo Shop.

You will walk the short interpretive trail and lookout (which will take 45 min), rather than paying the hefty hiking fees past that you need to pay in town at the Provincial Park office in Parque San Martin (depending on how far and how many days you trek). If you want to see the top of Aconcagua, check the weather for the area before going, or you will waste your time and money.\n* Cerro Arco is located near the town of El Challao, from where many of the most important treks can be started. A pleasant half-day hike easily done independently from Mendoza, offering the great views of both the Andean foothills behind and the vast expanse of Mendoza's plains to the front. Cerro Acro is the looming mountain to Mendoza's north west, topped with various antenna. It is also used as the base for paragliding. Take bus 114/115 (linea 3) on Sarmiento, just west of the Plaza Independencia, (or Parque San Martin on Av Del Libertador) to El Challao Mirador, at the end of the line 8km to the northwest. There is a clear turnaround at the end of the bus line where you get off. From there walk across from the white nightclub (which is slightly downhill from the road) following the dyke 100 metres, then take an unpaved track further west until you reach a small restaurant / mountaineering museum/ clubhouse - then follow the track to the north (going through the gate). This is a popular hike for Mendocinos at the weekend, but during the week it may be deserted. You can treat yourself to a hearty asado at the restaurant - although beware that restaurant has two menus, one more expensive than the other! From the Mirador the hike is about a 3.5 hour round trip. Get out of the area well before dark. In the summer, go early to avoid the worst of the heat, and in the winter bring a jacket, as it can be cool and windy at the top. Afterwards you could visit the aircraft hanger sized church in Challao, a local version of Lourdes.\n* The best way to reach the other side of the Andes and Santiago is to take a scenic 7 hour bus ride through the beautiful Andes Mountains. On the way you will see nice countryside before the reach of clouds in the stunning Andes Mountains, which actually stretch from Mendoza to Santiago. On the border awaits passport and luggage control post.\n* There is a nice golf field at the San Martin park, where residences Golf Club Andino.\n* This activity takes no longer than one day, in the mountain ranges of the pre-mountain range near our city, without having to go too far, there are places with a unique beauty. Usually national park has an intricate network of lesser-known day hikes. Torres del Paine's W Trek is world famous, but many people don't know that most of this route can be cut into three one-day hikes.\n* Every hotel, hostel and travel agent can organize horse riding trips close to the city - but these guys have one of the better reputations - can do day and overnight rides, look after their animals and speak good English. A late afternoon ride, with a return at sunset will enable you to avoid the heat of the day and night-riding is very atmospheric. If you phone them direct you will get a lower price compared to organizing through a hostel.\n* It is an exclusive spa located at Park Hyatt Mendoza.

It's really good, if you want to take a quick look around the city. The full tour it's about 2 hours. Bus fees, route and times are on its web.\n* Enjoy this sort of activity on the rugged landscape, what makes it one of the best mountain biking destinations. The mountains around are breathtaking and there is so much to see. \n* It can be done in Mendoza every day of year, depending on the winds of course. Tours include a tandem flight of about 15 minutes with an experienced pilot. There are two companies going off Cerro Arco, both easily googleable: \"zonadevuelo\" (aka Fly Excursion) and \"flyadventure\"(aka mendoaventuras).\n* This sport is popular in the winter, but the season is short. Closest are Penitientes (bigger) and Los Puquios (beginner) on the highway almost to the Chile border. You could either take the Espreso Uspallata milkruns, or by bus tickets or packages from the many agencies on Las Heras Street, between Mitre and Peru streets, where there are also lots of ski equipment and clothes rental shops.\n* Cacheuta, located about an hour outside of Mendoza, has a very large network of heated outdoor pools called the \"Parque del Agua\". For easy transportation, enquire regarding Cacheuta at the Bus Terminal, Buttini bus counter at the immediate south side of the terminal near platform 55. Buses depart from Mendoza about 9am and return in the evening. The last bus departing Cacheuta at 18:50 - but be aware that there are no buses back to Mendoza between approximately 3pm and the last bus. It is recommended that you purchase both directions before departing. If you're in for the full day adventure, consider bringing some food to cook on their plentiful and free grills. An upscale alternative is to go for the day to the Termas Hotel, about a km before\", with swanky pools, masseuses, jacuzzi and an incredible buffet lunch, but well worth the value - if you go, you would better book at the hotel a few days before for the package (do not bother staying at the hotel, the overpriced rooms are very cramped.\n* Mendoza city has wonderful theaters for your choice of different repertoire.\n* Mendoza area has many trekking routes.

                "* This park together with the Vigeland Sculpture Park is a large green area about 10 minutes by subway from the city center. In addition to being a nice green recreational area, it is also decorated with hundreds of sculptures by the Norwegian artist Gustav Vigeland. There is a wonderfully relaxed atmosphere here, although the sculptures are a little depressing. If your children want to climb the statues, nobody will even bother to look twice at you. Between June and August Frognerparken is one of the main places the young in Oslo meet during the daytime to barbecue and sunbathe. Buy an \"engangsgrill\", a pack of sausages, and a couple of beers and you'll fit right in. Neither using the barbecue nor drinking in public is completely legal, but as long as you sit among others and don't get rowdy, you will have no trouble. There is also a cafeteria, and two museums, the City Museum of Oslo and the Vigeland Museum. If you fancy an outdoor swim, Frognerbadet is situated next to the Frognerpark with 3 pools, several diving towers, and a water slide.\n* It is situated in the Gr\u00fcnerl\u00f8kka, a so-called Greenwich village look-alike area. The park's name was received from the military leader in the 19th century.\n* Small, with an assortment of nonvenomous snakes, some venomous spiders, lizards, frogs, beetles, two small monkeys and a Cayman.\n* From the north of the city center towards of Ullev\u00e5lsveien are the graves of Edvard Munch and Henrik Ibsen, two important cultural figures in Norway's history. It is also the burial site of a host of reputed Norwegian individuals and families.\n* It surrounds the Royal Palace at the top of Karl Johan Street. Oslo's most central park is a pleasant grass-covered area with majestic old trees. Wide walkways crisscross the park.\n* The park is known for its elegant apartment buildings with mature trees and hilltop views across Oslo and the fjord. It is a delightful public park on the highest hill in central Oslo. Great view of the city and surroundings. 1000 meters easy walk from Karl Johan Street along Akersgata-Ullev\u00e5lsveien past V\u00e5r Frelsers Gravlund (cemetery). The park has also given name to this popular neighborhood as well as to the larger administrative district (borough) that includes major parts of central Oslo.\n* This charming park has an old church and a caf\u00e9 on the top and is your best bet if St. Hanshaugen is too crowded (only a few minutes walk away).\n \nDo\n* A local guide takes you along all of Oslo\u2019s highlights. In a few hours, you will get familiar with the city and afterward, you could rent a bike and explore the city on your own.\n* \n* Hoved\u00f8ya, Gressholmen, or Lang\u00f8yene are wonderful places to spend a sunny day. There is also a bathing bus (number 87) running from mid-June to mid-August from Jernbanetorvet to the brilliant beaches of Hvervenbukta, Bestemorstranda, and Ingierstrand. Ingierstrand is a 1930s bathing resort with very special functionalist architecture. Also at Bygd\u00f8y, Snar\u00f8ya, and further out towards Asker, you will find several great beaches. During the summer months, the water temperature will, perhaps surprisingly for many foreigners, be very pleasant and beaches will be packed. Outdoor swimming pools can be found at Frognerparken and T\u00f8yenbadet.\n* Discover the city and its major tourist sites by bike, from April through October.\n* Be sure to check their event calendar, every week they have concerts with a variety of international and Norwegian bands and/or DJs. Each Sunday there is a free jazz/blues/soul concert. Walk up the river from the center and you'll find it. Old factory-style houses with lots of graffiti.\n* Explore Oslo with a historic vessel or spend a summer evening in the Oslo Fjord.\n* Kayaking & packrafting tours, courses, and paddleboarding. Also, Mad Goats are available to introduce the floating saunas.\n* The area around Holmenkollen (T-bane 1) is well suited for cross-country skiing, but also a nice area for hiking during summertime. While you are there, you can also visit the ski museum which is located close to the ski jump.\n* Silent Oslo Fjordcruise, Oslo Dinner Cruise, Brunch & Bubbles, Morning Yoga Cruise and Electric afterwork.\n* Akerselva is considered clean north of Nydalen. The best spot may be at Frysja (bus 22-25-54 to Stillatorget). Don't forget that many of the lakes in \"Oslomarka\" are for swimming and recreation, but a couple of the major lakes (Maridalsvannet in particular) are drinking water for the city. Buy a map and bring your swimming gear!\n* \n* \n* Nice gateways to the beautiful nature are T-bane to Frognerseteren (line 1), Sognsvann (line 6), Roms\u00e5s (line 5), Bogerud (line 3), Skullerud (line 3) or Ellingsrud\u00e5sen (line 2), or the train to Movatn or Snippen (local trains towards Hakadal, Roa, Jaren and Gj\u00f8vik). Also, bus 56 from Storo (tram 11, 12, 13 and T-bane) to Solemskogen or bus 51 from Nydalen (bus 37, T-bane 4, 5 and 6) to Maridalen offer fantastic possibilities for walks and rural life, everything less than half an hour from the city center. Bring something to drink and a chocolate bar (and do a bit of planning, buses 51 and 56 and the train seldom run more than once every half hour, less on weekends). Be prepared for some muddy sections of the trail as they take you through some pretty thickly wooded areas. The forest is dense enough that any damp areas of the trail don't dry out. This isn't helped by the multitude of small run-offs flowing down the mountain.\n* \n* Two courses with 9 holes Crazy Minigolf. This is a challenging and fun experience you won't soon forget. Try them. On the way, you will be served something good in a glass. Team up with your friends or colleagues for play. It is approx. 45 minutes to play through 9 holes.\n*"

The city is located in the southern end of Santiago Island and has year round good weather. The city is divided into various small unofficial districts, the most important ones being, Plateau (city center), Achada Santo Antonio, Palmarejo, Fazenda, Achada Grande, Varzea, Safende, Sucupira(bazaar area), Calbeciera, Terra Branca, Vila Nova, Achadinha, Bairro, Prainha, Monte Vermelho, Achada Mato, Achada Sao Felipe, and other smaller ones. Most part of the city are residential areas, so probably not worth visiting in itself, but worth a half-day exploration if you are passing through to another destination.\n \nThe center of the city lies on a plateau overlooking the bay to the southeast. The airport lies a few kilometers to the northeast.\n \nGet in\n \nPraia has an international airport. TACV (national flag carrier) and TAP airlines fly to various destinations in Europe, Africa, South America and United States. Taxis from the airport to Plateau cost 800/1000. You can pay in Euros (10\u20ac to Praia in June 2016). There is one bus line that serves the airport but it\u2019s better to just take a taxi since there is actually only one or two buses that serves this line. You can also enter the city through the port. There are ferry boats that have irregular service to and from the islands of Maio, Boavista, Sal and Sao Nicolau, and more regular and scheduled service to and from Sao Vicente and Fogo. You can exchange money at hotel (1 \u20ac= 105 Escudos) or in the city (1 \u20ac= 110 \u20ac in June 2016).\n \nGet around\n \nThe city has countless bus stops, and taxis are everywhere waiting for customers. There are two main bus companies that serve the city, Moura Company and Sol Atlantico. Each route has their own numbers. The main lines are from Safende to Achada Santo Antonio, Vila Nova to Achada Santo Antonio, Calbeceira to Palmarejo, Pensamento to Terra Branca, Achada Grande to Achada Santo Antonio, Sao Felipe to Plateau, Ponta D'Agua to Plateau,Achada Mato to Palmarejo. Most of these lines pass by Plateau (city center), Varzea and Terra Branca, the bus fair is about 35 escudos. When it comes to taxis you should be careful with illegal taxis that sometimes roam around and might rip you off. The normal taxi fare between two furthest points of the city shouldn\u2019t be more 1500 escudos in daytime and 1800 escudos at night time, example Pensamento to Palmarejo, or Palmarejo to Achada Mato. Taxi drivers usually expect to get a tip, give around 50 escudos to 100 escudos. Just be careful and always drive with the taxis that have a taximeter, so that they don\u2019t overcharge you.\n \nThe city doesn\u2019t really have a good way to navigate because of the lack of an official map. This is because large part of the city doesn\u2019t have their names or house numbers yet. In the city center and in the more important parts of the city most streets have names and numbers. However, most people are friendly and will give you directions. Walking by foot between the different districts is not recommended, especially since most of the city's side walks are made out of loose cobblestone and is difficult to walk, also because the city is full of hills that can be tiring to walk.

Most crimes involve petty thievery and these are mostly focused on actual residents and not on tourists, although there have been a few cases which involved tourists. So Praia is still a very safe city, just be careful with flaunting any expensive jewelry or gadgets like iPhones and such. Cape Verde in the past few years has seen an increase of petty crimes which are done mostly by groups of young people so avoid groups of young men especially at night.\n \nPraia is also a badly illuminated city at night, so be careful in places that might not have street lights and is somewhat isolated, always travel in pairs or in groups for safety. However if anything does occur there are police stations in various parts of the city and a general hospital in the city center.\n \nThe stairs at the edge of Achada Santo Antonio towards Plateau are unsafe, also during the day, avoid that neighbourhood.\n \nAt night, take a taxi.\n \n \nCope\n \n \nEmbassies & Consulates\n \n* \n \n* \n \n* \n \n* \n \nGet out\n \n, the historic capital, is an easy half-day trip.\n \nYou can rent a car or ask for a full day tour (9 hours) for a round trip island."

Generally, January and February are the coldest months, and August is the hottest month of the year.

                "Despite boasting a rich cultural, architectural and artistic heritage, Santo Domingo has not been exploited for all its tourist potential. You're pretty much on your own to discover this fascinating city. Make the most of your time there.\n* Santo Domingo was the first major european settlement in the New World. Christopher Columbus walked these streets! Check out the many examples of 15th and 16th century architecture in the Colonial Zone. Don't miss the Ozama Fort, the Alcazar de Colon and the Cathedral, all built in Columbus' lifetime. You can also check beautiful churches and convents, such as the Iglesia Regina Angelorum and the Convento de los Dominicos. Don't miss the Panteon Nacional, where the national heroes are buried, located in the Calle Las Damas, the New World's first (European) street! Also, walk up the Calle del Conde, a very old pedestrian shop-lined street that used to be the commercial heart of the city. This street leads to the Puerta de la Independencia, where the Dominican Republic proclaimed its independence from Haiti, and the Parque Independencia, where the country's founding fathers' remains are kept. On Sunday evenings, check out the Ruinas de San Francisco for live bands playing Merengue, Bachata, Salsa and Son, in a wonderful weekly show where both locals and tourists dance, drink and enjoy themselves. This would be an unforgettable experience! Also check out La Atarazana street after dark for a variety of romantic outdoor cafes with a spectacular view of the Alcazar and bay area. One such brasserie, Pat E Palo, has operated uninterrupted since 1505. Check out the house where Ponce DeLeon lived before he embarked upon his quest for the fountain of youth and ended up discovering Florida.\n* This waterfront boulevard is home to several huge hotel/casino complexes and dozens of small restaurants, clubs and cafes. Go there to people watch, take a romantic carriage ride or just have a few beers. Site of many festivals and concerts throughout the year. Parallel to the Malecon you will find Avenida Independencia, a tree lined street full of shops, bed and breakfasts and affordable restaurants with a nice mix of locals and tourists. For a unique dining experience check out Adrian Tropical, a traditional Dominican restaurant literally built on the water, or San Gil, a more formal eatery occupying the ruins of a colonial fort. The Malecon Center, located on the far end of the Malecon, is a new and still underoccupied high-end shopping center/hotel/condo complex with a Botero sculpture out front that reportedly cost US$1 million.\n* This amazing complex is home to the National Theater and five museums, ranging from the dilapidated and mundane, to the crisp, modern Museum of Modern Art the largest in the Caribbean and home to exhibits by artists from Jamaica, Bahamas, Puerto Rico, and of course, the Dominican Republic. If want a nice beautiful garden to read or talk this is your place also. \n* Find your way to the Parque Mirador Sur, an impressive park overlooking the coast. It gets closed for cars on weekdays between 5 and 8 am and pm, as well as on Sundays, enabling it to get filled with families playing with their children and exercising. Bike rentals are at your disposal.\nAlso, you can visit the Jardin Botanico, a vast, beautiful and lush park situated near one of Santo Domingo's most exclusive neighborhoods. There you can experience different ecosystems from a rain-forest to a Japanese garden!\n* Referred to as Santo Domingo Oriental, this separate municipality is not very tourist-friendly. Fortunately, most of its attractions are very close to the Colonial Zone and easy to get to. Check out Los Tres Ojos, or Three Eyes, a series of open-roof caverns and underground lakes for the whole family to explore (with a local this part of Santo Domingo is the most poverty stricken and can be dangerous!!!!). Head over to the Faro a Colon, a huge lighthouse and monument to Christopher Columbus which not only houses his remains but doubles as a museum. Check out the Santo Domingo Aquarium, a small but impressive showcase of the local aquatic life. If you're looking for some shopping, you can go to the Megacentro, Santo Domingo's largest shopping mall. It is massive!",

A popular weekend getaway for families, the lake offers pedal-boat rentals as well as swimming (deckchairs optional) for reasonable prices (swimming entry, without deckchair, is about 3 Lari). Allright for a hot summer day, and offering views of both the mountains and the city below. Snackbars, restaurants and fruit cocktail shakers are available overlooking the lake. It's about an hour's pleasant walk from the Saburtalo district along country roads, passing the Ethnographical Museum, or a ten-to-fifteen minute (5-10 lari) cab ride from the center. While the lake itself isn't particularly nice, the views from the hike up to the lake makes it a worthwhile excursion.\n* Much further out than Turtle Lake (a cab will set you back about 10-15 lari each way), minibus 137 from Liberty Square leaves you 200m from the lake, or bus 29 from Tarin Station. Possible to walk but long (8-9km from center), and not very nice views. Lake Lisi is much larger and more remote, with long, winding mountain and walks and bike lane surrounding the lake. Possible to swim and rent bicicles. Be warned - there aren't always taxis waiting to take you back...\n*The crumbling ruins of this once-great fortress, standing alongside the Upper Betelmi Churches and the stunning Botanical gardens, offer panoramic views of the city below. But be warned - it's quite a steep climb - and while the lack of bureaucracy and guard-rails can be liberating for some, you may want to pay extra care to watch your step. Now, the best way to visit is by aerial tramway, a exciting experience with stunning views of the city, only for 1 Lari. And you can enjoy the way down walking to the mosque and the baths. The usual metro card can be used. There is a working church at the courtyard of the Fortress. Nice hike from the fortress to Mtatsminda Park -see next section.\n*National botanic garden of Georgia, lying in the Tsavkisis-Tskali Gorge near Narikala Fortres, has not only collection of plants, but is also a lovely park with with scenic waterfall which is great for a dip on a hot summers' day, although you need to avoid the guards.\n*Take the bus up to the park to have fun with your kids, or to take a ride in the Ferris wheel. The ride is 2 Lari, and you need to buy a rechargeable access card at a cashiers desk for 2 lari (one card can be used by many persons). Alternatively, use the funicular for 8 Lari, which has to be loaded onto the park access card (Metromani card not valid). There's also a roller coaster (one ride - 5 lari, minimum of 4 persons) which offers not only some adrenaline but great views on a sunny day. There is also a nice path (paved but steep, with benches, views and fitness circuit) going from Mamadaviti Church to Narikala Fortress, passing through Mtatsminda Park, Sololaki Spring, a rich man's house, the Lady of Georgia and the cable to Rike. It is easy to walk from the bath's district to Narikala -take the road leading to the mosque and ending at the botanical garden. Just before the garden, there is a small lane to the right along the wall. Also easy (though extremely steep) to walk from Rustaveli Avenue to Mamadaviti St - from Liberty Square to Rustaveli Av. turn left into Besiki St (signaled in Jul 2017) and follow it uphill onto Mtatsminda Street.

If you're keen on walking up, take the lifts in the The James Cook Arcade (or one of several others along Lambton Quay) up to The Terrace, head south uphill until you reach Salamanca Rd. Head uphill up Salamanca Rd until you reach Victoria University. A set of stairs on the opposite side of the road to the Hunter Lawn goes uphill right to the top of the Gardens. If you already shelled out for a Daytripper ticket, just catch the Mairangi bus, get off at the stop after the University, and walk back along Upland Rd until you reach the Cable Car Museum. At the top of the Gardens, there are several attractions:\n**The Cable Car Museum has two of the old cars in semi-restored and fully-restored condition and some of the original Cable Car machinery from the system that was replaced in 1978. \n**The Lookout has a great view day or night, and the large map next to the round tree usually has a few pamphlets with maps of the Gardens. \n**The Carter Observatory is a stones throw from here. This is the perfect place to explore the Garden from, or wander back to the city.\n*Bolton Street Memorial Park Watch out for the friendly black cat who haunts this hillside cemetery. If you're returning from the Botanic Gardens by foot, this is great place to meander through and check out the epitaphs of early pioneers and historical figures. \n* Mt Victoria Lookout. A visit to Wellington is not complete without checking out Wellingtons most popular lookout, offering stunning views across the city and harbour.\n*Red Rocks/ Seal Colony. This is an interesting walk named for its distinctive red rocks (probably Jasper). Take the number 1 bus to the end (Island Bay). Walk across the park towards the ocean and hang a right. There is another bus, number 4, that goes to the end of the road but only at certain times. Travel west (right side, if facing the water) until you run out of road. Here you will find a disused quarry and a visitors center (open daily from 10am - 6pm, later in summer). The walk along this beach is pleasant but rocky and often very windy, so dress accordingly. The road is shared (except Sundays) with 4WDs and other motor traffic. If one walks for about 1 hour you will come across a distinctive pass though the rock face. Just on the other side of this is a seal colony (in May-October)that is worth the walk. Please bear in mind that these are wild animals and so require a certain level of respect, so keep your distance and do not get between them and the sea, especially if you value your health! Continuing on from here, you will eventually arrive at Makara (but this is a long distance, and the seal colony is a recommended turn-around point).\n*Circa Theatre \n*Bats Theatre \n*Capital E National Theatre for Children \n*The Embassy Theatre \n*Beck's Incredible Film Festival.

The wreck lies about 600 metres southeast of Taputeranga Island (the island of Island Bay) at 41&deg; 21'.270 S., 174&deg; 46'.770 E.\n*Take a ferry across the harbour to Eastbourne and Days Bay beach, or Somes island for a short hike. Go down to Queen's Wharf and check out the destinations and times.\n* Kaitoke Regional Park If you're feeling more adventurous, head north 30-40 minutes drive to the Kaitoke Regional Park, a hidden gem not as well known to tourists, but a popular spot for Wellingtonians. Take an easy paced walk through lush rainforest until you stumble across historic dams, the canopy bridge, and the \"Rivendale\" filming location from the Lord of the Rings movies. If it's a warm summers day or you're feeling brave, take a swim in the river or go kayaking.\n*Oriental Parade is Wellington's most beautiful street.

Probably sensible to allocate no more than a couple of days to Tana.\nThere are actually a number of things to do in Tana and, if you can see beyond the poverty, the city is really attractive and a photographers dream. The architecture is a mix of French Countryside and Indonesia. Rice paddies scattered all over the city add a brilliant green to the pastel terracotta of the buildings. The market is wonderful offering many unique souvenirs and if you do not want to barter then try Lisy, a collection of shops with similar produce to the market at excellent prices. The Lemur Park, 45 minutes out of Tana, is well worth a visit and for gourmets there are some surprisingly good restaurants. \nTravel out of the capital is by two modes: road or air. Contrary to the main Madagascar article, as of 2005 there was no passenger rail service from the capital. Road transport is by bus to limited destinations, taxi-brousse (shared taxi) to a variety of destinations or by car rental (usually with driver). Although travel by taxi-brousse is guaranteed to try one's patience and sanity, there is quite possibly no better way to meet and interact with the locals and experience Madagascar as the Malagasy do. Air travel is the recommended method, due to the poor state of many roads, and Antananarivo is the hub city for the national carrier Air Madagascar. But of course air is more expensive. Recommended next stops are and/or Nossi-Be."

Niagara Falls, Ontario is very different from its U.S. counterpart: the views of the Falls are almost unanimously considered to be better, but rather than the comparatively quiet greenery that abuts the falls on the American side, Niagara Falls, Ontario boasts Clifton Hill, a gaudy tourist area adjacent to the falls that consists of swanky high-rise hotels, a pair of casinos, restaurants, nightclubs, and gimmicky tourist traps such as the Ripley's Believe It Or Not Museum and the Movieland Wax Museum. Though gritty urban streets such as those of Niagara Falls, New York are almost unheard of on the Canadian side, it's often said that the Las Vegas-style neon jungle that has sprouted in Niagara Falls, Ontario detracts from the majesty of the falls themselves. It's considerably quieter outside of the main tourist district, with romantic B&Bs, verdant parkland, and (further north) wineries lining the Niagara Parkway, one of the area's most scenic drives that runs along the Canadian side of the Niagara River from Fort Erie to Niagara-on-the-Lake. Niagara Falls is also home of Marineland an amusement park popular with Buffalonians and Canadians alike that features exhibits of sea animals such as dolphins and killer whales, about a dozen rides, and a campground.\n* is located north of Niagara Falls, Ontario at the mouth of the Niagara River, an hour's drive from Buffalo. Niagara-on-the-Lake is rich with history: at the end of the 18th century it served briefly as the capital of Ontario, and it was of strategic military importance during the War of 1812. Today, visitors to Niagara Falls often make side trips to Niagara-on-the-Lake to take in the picture-perfect streets of the town center, whose stone buildings give off the ambience of a prim British village. Wine lovers will note that the town is located in the heart of the Niagara Peninsula wine country, and history buffs can tour restored military sites such as Fort George. Niagara-on-the-Lake is also notable as the home of the long-running Shaw Festival each year from April until November, performances of selected plays of George Bernard Shaw or his contemporaries are held in three historic theatres in the town.\n*The extends between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, immediately west of Buffalo. Aside from the region's fertile farmland and historical importance as a battleground during the War of 1812, the Niagara Peninsula is greatly popular with tourists as Canada's most productive wine-producing region. There are dozens of European-style wineries straddling both sides of the Niagara Escarpment that are open to visitors in season. The unique microclimate of the Niagara Peninsula is particularly suited to producing ice wine, an extremely sweet variety popular as a dessert wine.\n* is located about two hours from Buffalo (assuming no significant delays at Customs). With over five and a half million people living in the Greater Toronto Area, Canada's largest city is an exciting and dynamic metropolis that offers all the big-city excitement one could want.",

                "Splurge\n* Hotel St. Christophe, Place Bel'Ombra, is a 3-star hotel just up from the citadel with some great views and good service to boot. Rooms are clean, if a little small, with the newly-renovated first floor being somewhat bewildering in its layout. A good choice for couples, but slightly too small for a 3-person family, and almost impossible unless booking multiple rooms for 4 or more. Through most companies (Corsican Places, Holiday Options) you are entitled to eat at the restaurant every other day (or thereabouts), though by the end of the holiday this frequently becomes a chore rather than a pleasure. The breakfast, however, is simply amazing and is served until 10am and is constantly replenished. There are plenty of gizmos and gadgets to keep you occupied while you wait for your egg to boil; particularly the orange juice machine, which is a source of wonderment to all. In terms of food at breakfast, there is something for everyone, from cheese to waffles to (obviously) croissants. The coffee here is not excellent, so it is probably better to order chocolat (which is superb) or nab a paper and go down to U Pescadore for a coffee afterwards. Staff all speak good English and are friendly, though the maids have a disturbing tendency to burst into your room regardless of what you hang on the door. The clientele is mostly English and Scottish, which is superb for Brits who prefer to have a native base, though because of this you should not expect to get a sunbed by the small pool; towel antics abound, and recent '30 minutes only' rules have not eased this at all. However, due to Calvi's simply astounding main beach, there is no real need to frequent it. Prices are pretty expensive, though cheaper than rivals nearer the marina. Wi-Fi is available throughout the hotel, including in your room, though prices are absolutely ridiculous (EUR4 for 30 minutes, EUR8 for an hour, etc.)",

It is hard to recommend the citadel for its contents (though the 2nd Bn. Parachutistes of the Foreign Legion put on a show every year, discussed below, which is worth going to), but the views are simply amazing, especially at sunset.\n* Come during the 15 Ao\u00fbt, and you will be treated with the best fireworks show you have ever seen. Go to the main beach and you will see the show proper; each year has its own theme. We went in 2006 and saw the 'Apocalypse' themed show, which included fireworks evoking fire, brimstone (we were hit on the head numerous times by falling caps--not a great idea to sit on the street directly beneath it) and volcanic eruptions accompanied by loud, germanic classical music and an accompanying video projected onto its largest wall. In the daytime, the Parachutistes put on a show and do a jump from 15,000ft, landing in the sea. Best viewed from the bar U Cornu Marinu, if only under the pretense of avoiding flying boots.\n* L'Eglise Santa Maria is worth a visit; you can't miss it, it's the 'Big Pink Church'.

Its particularly striking to see at night when the fountains are lit up in different colors, and safety shouldn't be an issue then as their are plenty of security cameras installed to quell any potential issues with the neighborhood. 3CDC who remodeled Fountain Square led this renovation and as a result is programming it with plenty of events throughout the year, see website for details.\n* The largest in a series of public parks along the high banks of the river, the park is framed by great city landmarks including the Roebling Bridge, the National Underground Freedom Railroad Center, the Paul Brown Stadium, and the Great American Ballpark. With implementation currently underway, the riverfront park completes a necklace of open spaces on the river, links statewide recreation trail and bike systems, and reconnects the heart of downtown Cincinnati to the great Ohio River. The park acts as a setting and catalyst for civic activities and entertainment venues and is supported by partnerships with private and public funds. Typical park events range from small picnic-like activities to larger pre- and post-game activities for the Bengals and Reds, concerts, and Tall Stakes\u2014a music, arts, and heritage festival which brings 350,000 visitors to the downtown.

Public landings and seasonal docking and wharves service the public and commercial cruise boat traffic. Park amenities are enhanced by a series of sustainable strategies, including an integrated bicycle center, support, and locker room facility and a new restaurant pavilion supported by a geothermal heating and cooling system.In the surrounding waterfront district, a six-block, mixed-use development is planned that will bring roughly 400 residential units and office and commercial activities to the area.",

The Forest Zoo () is one of the few that does stand up to international expectations, with large exhibits and a good variety of species. The zoo, set in the hillsides south of the city centre, is split into two sections on opposite sides of a mountain as well as offering an indoor rainforest (plant species only) and various performances showcasing animal talent.

Several primate species and birds are also found on the premises. The cableway is the most popular mode of transport to get to the other section, but zoo buses are also offered, in addition to walking (likely too much for little ones, as the road is winding and hilly) and parking lots at entrances to both sections (\u00a520 to park near Section 2, \u00a510 near Section 1 and fee must be paid separately if wanting to park in both lots). \u00a5120 admission includes cableway transport.

                "* Al Ahmadiya School, Deira. Built-in 1912, this was Dubai's first school and has now been nicely restored. It would be a stretch to call the exhibits of old reed pens and diplomas fascinating, but they've tried pretty hard, and if nothing else, the air-con and clean toilets may come in handy.\n* Bastakiya District. One of the last remaining pockets of Old Dubai, home to many reconstructed buildings in the traditional style. While the information on the structures is slim here (see the museum in preference), the atmosphere is very evocative and there are plenty of delightful art galleries and cafes to explore.\n* Dubai Crocodile Park, Mushrif, A haven for crocodiles. \n* Launched on Valentine's day and boasting over 50 million outstanding flowers in astounding colourful floral designs, patterns and shades, and fragrances, magical is only one of the words to describe this enchanting floral park with. For its magnificence, it gets over 1.5 million visitors yearly. And this has made it one of Dubai's most popular places to visit. The opening of the park quickly got it a Guinness World Record for being the largest vertical garden. This is only one of a couple of Guinness World Records it has struck. The Dubai wonderland has several immersing things to do which include the Dubai Butterly Garden, The Emirates A380 - Floral Airplane, The Lake Park, 3D Floral Sculptures, The Hearts Passage et cetera. Given Dubai's parching summer sun, the park opens seasonally to protect the flowers.\n* Dubai Museum, Al Ibn Abi Talib Road, ph: +971 (4) 353-1862. A must-see for anyone interested in the social history of the Emirate (and indeed the country). A visit starts at the al-Fahidi fort, which has a few examples of traditional reed houses and other artifacts but isn't much to look at. The more interesting part is the modern extension built underneath the fort, showcasing Dubai's history using the latest technology and culminating in a reconstructed souq from the pearling days, complete with authentic sights and sounds. It is quite fascinating to see the speed at which the transition from a poor pearling village to a modern metropolis occurred. Admission 3AED.\n* Jumeirah Mosque, Jumeirah Road, Jumeirah 1 (opposite Palm Strip Mall). Is the largest in the city, and a wonderful example of Islamic architecture. Built-in the medieval Fatimid tradition the interior is decorated with elaborate Arabic calligraphy. It is one of few mosques in the city open for visits by non-Muslims, the Sheikh Mohammed Centre for Cultural Understanding conducts special tours for non-Muslims to help promote understanding of Islam. Guided tours are available on Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday beginning at 10AM, followed by a question-and-answer session. Located on Jumeirah Road, the mosque is an especially great place to visit in the evening when it's dramatically illuminated by floodlights. \n* Shindagha District &mdash; Home to the open museums of the Heritage Village, and has the home of former Sheikh Rashid Al-Maktoum.\n* Souks &mdash; There are a number of nice souks, or markets, on both sides of the creek that are worth exploring. The spice souk is a good place to discover local ingredients, while the souk Madinat Jumeirah is known for its traditional architecture. Souks tend to specialize in a certain niche. Depending on which one you visit they sell everything from spices to crafts to very inexpensive tourist t-shirts.",
                "Events\n* Camel Races. The Camel Race Track is one of the more unusual attractions, with races being held on Thursday and Friday in the winter.

Countries around the world gather and set up small villages on the outskirts of Dubai, each country/region has its own pavilion with a unique replica of its famous landmark(s). This is usually like a flea market where you can get souvenirs from almost every corner of the earth for a bargained price and experience as if you're in that certain country for at least 10 minutes of your life even if you're 10,000km away. Raffles for cars and gold bars also happen. You'd see the hieroglyphics of Egypt, temples of Thailand, the Forbidden city of Beijing, the Eiffel tower, and many more.",
                "* Al Safa Park. It is one of the oldest in Dubai. It's a favorite for sports enthusiasts, and many visitors enjoy playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer. Children love playing games in the video arcade or riding the Ferris wheel and bumper cars. The park even has a maze to wander through. Barbeques and picnic areas are available for those who want to make a day of it.\n* Beaches and sea. There are endless water-sport opportunities as Dubai has some of the whitest and sandiest beaches in the world. Ocean temperatures range from 22&deg;C in winter up to 35&deg;C in summer, there are few wave breaks and the strong winds can make swimming difficult. The water is also very salty so many prefer to use their hotel swimming pool. Diving activities have been severely affected by offshore construction work for the Palms and The World; consequently, long boat trips are necessary to reach wreck sites. Alternatively, one can make the 90-minute road journey to the East coast Emirate of or the Sharjah enclave, Khor Fakkan, for top-class diving on coral reefs supporting extensive marine life.\n* Culture and Arts[There are multiple cultural happenings that are still undiscovered in Dubai.

Professional fishermen and captains of the boat are assigned to the people to ensure complete safety. Staff is fully trained, ethically aware of the needs of the travelers, and available to keep sharp eye on weather conditions and atmosphere for safety measures. Dubai is actually a place for water freaks and people who like to explore nature from the lap of the sea. Bottom fishing and trolling are both options that can be availed for preying on the fish. Bottom fishing is about attracting a variety of fish by using bait like squids by stopping the boat in the middle of the sea. Trolling is done to catch big fish by using trolling lures or plastic fish as bait. \n* Desert Motorcycle Tours Big Red Motorsports specializes in Desert Motorcycle / Dirt Bike and Dune Buggy Tours. Located at the foot of Big Red (Dubai's greatest dune) there is no better location to experience the vast desert of the UAE. Expect thrills and adventure. Dune Buggy is suitable for all. A motorcycle tour requires some skill. No license is needed. \n* Desert Safari or Dune Bashing. Dubai is well known for its desert safari and extreme adventure sports in the desert. The most popular extreme adventure tour is called the dune bashing. Dune Bashing uses different things like 4X4 Safari Jeeps, Sand Boards, Quad Bikes, and Dune Buggies. Head out to the desert in an SUV with specialist Desert Drivers. The drivers will take you for a roller-coaster ride over sand dunes, show you the sunset from a strategic vantage point and then take you to a lavish dinner with music and dance to complete the atmosphere. You may want to stay clear of the dune-bashing if you know that you get carsick easily. They have recently added a Hummer H3 to the roster, which costs a bit more but is worth the money like featured by MTDubai, Clifton Tours and Happy Adventures. Another option would be renting/buying a 4x4 and joining the many growing 4x4 clubs in the UAE, which are varied and each carries their own different flavor: ad4x4, UAE off-roaders, etc. They offer a free learning experience for all newcomers with scheduled weekly trips to suit all levels of driving skills, some of them have over 2,000 members from many nationalities.\n* One of the largest suspended aquarium in the world, It holds 10-million litre tank, hosting thousands of fish and other underwater wildlife for visitors and residents to watch.

You can book a ride on the creek with a dinner cruise or even rent a private boat to take you on an hour-long ride up and down the creek.\n* \n* Strategically sited, Dubai Frame overlooks Dubai's past and present. Further, by virtue of powerful virtual reality technology, visitors get to see a projection of Dubai decades from now. The Dubai Frame is the largest picture frame in the world.

If you can afford it, it's an excellent experience, even possible as a day trip from Kigali. You can also take the \"Dian Fossey Trek\" or the \"Golden Monkey Trek\" for $75-100 USD. You might be able to see a gorilla group on one of these hikes if you're lucky. Inquire at the Rwandan Office for Tourism and National Parks (ORTPN), Boulevard de la R\u00e9volution n\u00b0 1, Kigali, +(250) 576514 or 573396, mailto:reservation@rwandatourism.com/ reservation@rwandatourism.com. $750 USD cash or Visa card. 50% discount for residents. Gorilla trekking in Volcanoes National Park requires a permit, now $1500 for non-EAC residents. This goes towards your entry, but supports conservation efforts at large in the park, as well as the local community. At the start of the trek, you'll be asked to indicate your fitness level - be very honest and err on the side of underselling yourself if needed. You'll be placed in a group accordingly, and the hikes can vary from rather easy 30 minute ascents up to 6-8 hours strenuous hikes. Guides and porters are more than willing to help but you don't want to have wasted your $1500 needing to call it quits before you get to the gorillas. The guides and porters are also very familiar and protective of both you and the gorillas. While the gorillas can get quite close - your guide and trackers will keep you safe - there has only ever been one incident and it involved a photographer brazenly ignoring the guide and trackers and antagonising the gorilla. There are tour providers that can get you out to Volcanoes for a day trip quite easily - though many of the visitors will stay in luxury lodges nearby to do multiple treks. \n* Gisenyi, also called Rubavu, is a city on the shores of Lake Kivu, right at the border of Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo. Gisenyi is as close you can get to a beach destination in Rwanda. The sandy public beach and the many resorts close to Bralirwa give you the seaside feeling you might be craving.\n* Kibuye is the other popular destination at Lake Kivu (besides Gisenyi), which has a very lake-side feeling. You can rent a boat and visit the nearby islands, including Napoleon Hat Island with its many fruit bats you can see up close. Kibuye also hosts Rwanda's Environmental Museum\n* Gishwati Forest National Park is Rwanda's newest park. It comprises pasture lands and many Eucaliptus plantations. If you want to visit a dairy farm or factory, this is the place to go.\n* Foret Naturelle de Mukura is officially part of the Gishwati National Park, but separated from the largest patch in the North. Mukura is a small natural forest boasting a small chimpanzee population. If you do not want to go all the way to Nyungwe for the Chimps, you can visit them at Mukura on your way to Kibuye.\n* Musanze is the gateway to the Volcanoes National Park and the treks to see the gorillas. However, Musanze also offers several caves for all enthusiasts, from tourist-friendly to specialists. Visits are organised through the RDB and previous booking is required (they often organise tours at 2pm, calling them in the morning is usually enough). Tours start at the RDB office at Kinigi (same place where gorilla tours start).\n* Twin lakes Burera and Ruhondo are between Kigali and Musanze and make for a nice weekend break. There are camp sites and resorts available around the lakes, and even on an island in lake Burera. Views from lake Ruhondo are very popular as looking towards the lake one has the sun setting behind the volcanoes in the background. You can stay overnight at the Foyer de Charite or Ruhondo Lake Resort, overlooking lake Ruhondo and the volcanoes.\n* Lake Muhazi is the standard get-away day-trip. Only 45 minutes from Kigali either North on the road to Uganda, or East on the way to Rwamagana. Muhazi is a bilharzia-full lake (so no swimming), but it has several nice resorts on its shore. Near Rwesero you have Rwesero Resort, or cross the lake to Kingfisher resort, boasting a pool with a view mid-way up the hill. Mid-way on the northern short you have Jambo beach and Sisters of Peace resorts.\n* Nyanza was the capital of the Kingdom of Rwanda from 1958 to 1962. The old Royal Palace of the Rwandan monarchy is located in the town of Nyanza.",
                "As a clean, comfortable and ordered city, Kigali is very popular with long term expats, and the city is teeming with westerners, from young church or NGO volunteers having their first experience of Africa to career development workers enjoying a relaxed lifestyle where it is safe to bring up young children. This in turn means the city supports numerous restaurants, coffee shops and supermarkets that cater to this demographic. The country is also rapidly developing, with huge infrastructure and construction projects expanding rapidly, taking advantage of the country's stable peace period. Residents are quite openly proud of the progress the country has made and are widely supportive of it. New, well-maintained roads have been extended throughout the country and you'd be hard pressed to find a single piece of litter. Schools, clean energy projects, water services, and cellular and broadband connectivity are all being rapidly developed nation-wide.",
                "Further along the way\n* Nyungwe Forest National Park is probably the best preserved montane rainforest in Central Africa. The park contains 13 primate species (25% of Africa's total), 275 bird species, 1068 plant species, 85 mammal species, 32 amphibian and 38 reptile species.\n* Nyiragongo volcano just across the border in the DRC is potentially one of the most impressive destinations in the Great Lakes region. This 2-day hike (5-6 hours up, 3 hours down) rewards you with a night spent on the edge of an active bubbling magma lake and amazing views over Goma, Gisenyi and Lake Kivu. It is a must-see!\n* Idjwi Island in the middle of Lake Kivu rewards you with a peaceful weekend in the DRC. Unlike any of the crazy stories elsewhere in the DRC, Idjwi is characterised by its peaceful and calm people. A tour organised by Yves takes you around the island, shows you local businesses and culture, pygmy villages, and maybe even the King!"

Since most of Killeen dates from the 1940s or later, there are not many historic buildings. There is, however, a nice little chapel dating from 1882 (Bethel Primitive Baptist Church), that offers scheduled tours, and there are a number of turn-of-the-century buildings and small shops lining North 2nd Street in the downtown area.

Take a bus from Jiujiang Intercity Bus Station to Haihui. This bus travels initially south east on a concrete highway which swings south west. After about 27km on your right hand side looms the fantastic peaks of Lushan, named Five Old Men. The bus driver must know that you want to get off to walk to the 3 Step Waterfall, which is in the precinct of Haihui. It means you will dropped on the side of the road, so take the side turning toward the mountains, past a village, past a dam, and on up the concrete road. When the first park entry check point is spotted, go back a bit and walk up the track beside the creek, and then along a water pipe (balance required over the gullies) until you are well passed this pay point. Continue back on the road until the road arrives at a small village and the footpath bridges the creek at a weir and continues upstream on the other side. There will be increasing numbers of coach delivered tourists around. About 300 metres up this track is another paypoint, about Y50, which can be bypassed by a very silent and strenuous climb over the huge rocks in the creek bed. You can go back and progress up the other side of the creek until you have to get into the creek bed and deal with the huge rocks. Either that or pay the Y50. The stone path now climbs through the valley, up, ever up through a spectacular gorge to the Three Step Waterfall, where suddenly it's like Disneyland in the mountains with duck shaped watercraft in the bottom pond to the waterfall, kiosks and masses of people, who have descended by foot to this spectacular spot from the top cable car station high above. Continue up the path, until you see the paypoint for visitors to the mountain proper, fee approx Y130. Go back about 100 metres down to a right turn junction in the path in a SE direction. This stone path contours around to underneath the top fall of the Three Step Waterfall. There is an old path that actually goes under the waterfall; take it. Climb over the man made impediments of barbed wire and stakes, and continue on a narrow path of indeterminate age, but which is now closed to all but you. This path is in derelict condition, and safety barriers are largely missing, so your party should be comfortable with overgrown passage and exposure to great heights. However it's a great walk with marvellous views and environment and definitely secluded from the masses. This overgrown path, sometimes hard to recognise, follows over the heads of the \"Five Old Men\" the 4000' plus summits originally visible from the road, now far below. After a couple of hours this path joins the main park system, where one finds one's way finally to a road and therefore transport to the the centre of Guling. In the writers experience there was a cab waiting, for the 15 minute drive past the colonial era villas. The whole journey is well worth the effort (for those of you on this wavelength).",

It was originally built up by British colonialists as a summer hill station, and still bears evidence of their architecture (both real and obviously contrived). It still makes for a refreshing escape from the summer heat, and offers many scenic hiking opportunities and some historic buildings, particularly of interest for fans of Communist Party history. It is very popular with the better heeled Chinese tourist, but well off the beaten path for independent foreign travellors and accordingly you should expect some communication difficulties. It is hoped it was enjoyed by Chairman Mao, as his visage in cane chair features in front of the many picturesque spots, with more than a little assistance from Photo Shop.

From there follow the cliff along a man-made path that picks up many spectacular views and passes many items of natural interest. In due course this path arrives at the Sante rollerway, a contraption of dual rails and a 2 person car that descends through the forest. It's a worthwhile ride, as it is time for a rest and the opportunity to be grateful that the primitive braking system works. The cliffside walk continues until far below it reaches a suspension bridge and a chairlift back up to the mountain. There might also be a taxi at the bottom, or you can walk up the narrow concrete road to the main road at the top and hail a bus back to Guling. Allow about 4 hours for this whole excursion.\n*The must-see Lushan Waterfall, Sandiequan. Locals also have a saying \"If you've never been to Sandiequan, you've never been to Lushan\" It is a gruelling 3 hour hike to and fro from the bus stop drop off point. To save time, take the cable car (not open during winter), but you will still have to walk 2000 steps down to the waterfall, and back up again. Stretcher bearers are available during the peak season to carry tourists down, at a steep price.\n*Stone steps from the bridge through the left side of road before the trip to the Fairy Cave, about 1.5 km to a beautiful valley.

Named Port Clarence, it was used as a naval station in the effort to suppress the slave trade. Many newly freed slaves were also settled there, prior to the establishment of Sierra Leone as a colony for freed slaves. While many of them later relocated to Sierra Leone, some of their descendants, called Fernandinos, can still be found in Malabo and the surrounding area, where they constitute a distinct ethnic group, speaking their own Afro-Portuguese pidgin dialect.\nWhen the island reverted to complete Spanish control, Malabo was renamed Santa Isabel. It was chosen to replace the mainland town of Bata as the capital of the country in 1969, and was renamed Malabo in 1973 as part of President Francisco Mac\u00edas Nguema's campaign to replace European place names with \"authentic\" African ones.",

You will walk the short interpretive trail and lookout (which will take 45 min), rather than paying the hefty hiking fees past that you need to pay in town at the Provincial Park office in Parque San Martin (depending on how far and how many days you trek).

From there walk across from the white nightclub (which is slightly downhill from the road) following the dyke 100 metres, then take an unpaved track further west until you reach a small restaurant / mountaineering museum/ clubhouse - then follow the track to the north (going through the gate). This is a popular hike for Mendocinos at the weekend, but during the week it may be deserted. You can treat yourself to a hearty asado at the restaurant - although beware that restaurant has two menus, one more expensive than the other! From the Mirador the hike is about a 3.5 hour round trip. Get out of the area well before dark. In the summer, go early to avoid the worst of the heat, and in the winter bring a jacket, as it can be cool and windy at the top. Afterwards you could visit the aircraft hanger sized church in Challao, a local version of Lourdes.\n* The best way to reach the other side of the Andes and Santiago is to take a scenic 7 hour bus ride through the beautiful Andes Mountains. On the way you will see nice countryside before the reach of clouds in the stunning Andes Mountains, which actually stretch from Mendoza to Santiago. On the border awaits passport and luggage control post.\n* There is a nice golf field at the San Martin park, where residences Golf Club Andino.\n* This activity takes no longer than one day, in the mountain ranges of the pre-mountain range near our city, without having to go too far, there are places with a unique beauty.

However, it also has other retail establishments of note, such as shopping malls and wine vendors. You can find expensive, upscale items, rare antiques, handcrafted clothing and souvenirs, and just about anything else you are looking for in Naples \u2014 and much of it at prices much lower than in Western European nations.",
                "Do\nNaples has an abundance of attractions and activities that await its annual tourists. There is no way to list them all here, but below are some of the most popular things to do in Naples:\n* The beaches of Naples are located on the eastern and western edges of the city. Eastern beaches are characterized by dark sand. La Gaiola Beach on the western coast is one of the most beautiful Neapolitan beaches as well as less affected by urban influence and contamination. There are nice rocky beaches in Lido Marechiaro, Bagno Elena, or private Rocce Verdi beach. Miseno Beach already has a sandy shore.\n* The history of cinema in Naples begins at the end of the 19th century the first of which was the Panorama of Naples Harbor. Over time, many cinematographic works have been recorded, production houses have been established, many notable filmmakers have been born, and many prizes have been won. Over the decades the Neapolitan capital has also been used as a film set for many works, over 600 according to the Internet Movie Database. When you go to the cinema, never forget that Tot\u00f2 is an icon of Naples, the \u201cprince of jokes\u201d who made hundreds laugh. Recognize and visit locations where many films were created\n* \n* Any small idea can be generated into a tour. Naples is full of different attractions.\n* Naples is full of surprises and secrets. It\u2019s a city with bizarre superstitions.\n* \n* Football is the most popular sport in Naples. This sport is deeply rooted in the local culture: it is popular at every level of society, from street children to wealthy professionals. The city's best-known football club is SSC Napoli.\n* A fun 1.5-hour tour through the old Greek and Roman city and aqueducts buried under the modern city; also includes some WWII history as this area was used as a bomb shelter. Tours in English leave M-F 12, 2, and 4 (and 9 PM on Thurs), Sa-Su 10, 12, 2, 4, and 6; see New York Times article. (Note: The nearby San Lorenzo Maggiore also has underground ruins of the old Roman market, but they are much less extensive and there is typically no guide).\n* Naples has many great theatres. First of all, the most famous and prestigious Theater in the world San Carlo, an opera house in Naples opened in 1737. Seeing an opera in this theatre is a unique experience, a show inside the show. The other less prestigious Napulitana (Neapolitan songs), Teatro Bellini (Performing arts), Teatro Augusteo (Performing arts), and Palapartenope Theater.\n* The Spaccanapoli course stands out for its color and noise, which is interesting because it divides the city of Naples into two parts. From there, travel to St. Severus Chapel (Cappella Sansevero), which preserves a famous 18th-century masterpiece of the Neapolitan sculptor Giuseppe Sanmartino - \"Veiled Christ \" (Cristo Velato). The sculpture depicting the dead Christ wrapped in a veil is still a mystery to sculpture fans, who cannot find an explanation as to how the author managed to get such a thin veil out of marble; Walk along the seashore: Via Nazario Sauro, Via Partenope, and Via Francesco Caracciolo. Or you can make the route Via dei Mille, via Filangieri, and via Chiaia which are three of the more elegant and rich streets.",
                "Sure, the city has a bad reputation concerning the Mafia, and trash crisis (the worst is actually over) and many parts of the city are impoverished and really dangerous, but if you look even further than that and exercise a lot of caution, you will find a vibrant city with plenty to see and do, a city where the large influx of tourists like in Rome, Venice, Florence etc. have not happened (for now) and have thus allowed the city to retain much of its original culture, allowing you to visit a hidden gem just 2 hours south of Rome. Its territory, particularly the iconic sight of the Gulf of Naples (but also Mount Vesuvius, the music, etc.) is arguably one of the most powerful symbolic images of Italy."

Neither using the barbecue nor drinking in public is completely legal, but as long as you sit among others and don't get rowdy, you will have no trouble. There is also a cafeteria, and two museums, the City Museum of Oslo and the Vigeland Museum. If you fancy an outdoor swim, Frognerbadet is situated next to the Frognerpark with 3 pools, several diving towers, and a water slide.\n* It is situated in the Gr\u00fcnerl\u00f8kka, a so-called Greenwich village look-alike area. The park's name was received from the military leader in the 19th century.\n* Small, with an assortment of nonvenomous snakes, some venomous spiders, lizards, frogs, beetles, two small monkeys and a Cayman.\n* From the north of the city center towards of Ullev\u00e5lsveien are the graves of Edvard Munch and Henrik Ibsen, two important cultural figures in Norway's history. It is also the burial site of a host of reputed Norwegian individuals and families.\n* It surrounds the Royal Palace at the top of Karl Johan Street. Oslo's most central park is a pleasant grass-covered area with majestic old trees. Wide walkways crisscross the park.\n* The park is known for its elegant apartment buildings with mature trees and hilltop views across Oslo and the fjord. It is a delightful public park on the highest hill in central Oslo. Great view of the city and surroundings. 1000 meters easy walk from Karl Johan Street along Akersgata-Ullev\u00e5lsveien past V\u00e5r Frelsers Gravlund (cemetery). The park has also given name to this popular neighborhood as well as to the larger administrative district (borough) that includes major parts of central Oslo.\n* This charming park has an old church and a caf\u00e9 on the top and is your best bet if St. Hanshaugen is too crowded (only a few minutes walk away).\n \nDo\n* A local guide takes you along all of Oslo\u2019s highlights. In a few hours, you will get familiar with the city and afterward, you could rent a bike and explore the city on your own.\n* \n* Hoved\u00f8ya, Gressholmen, or Lang\u00f8yene are wonderful places to spend a sunny day. There is also a bathing bus (number 87) running from mid-June to mid-August from Jernbanetorvet to the brilliant beaches of Hvervenbukta, Bestemorstranda, and Ingierstrand. Ingierstrand is a 1930s bathing resort with very special functionalist architecture. Also at Bygd\u00f8y, Snar\u00f8ya, and further out towards Asker, you will find several great beaches. During the summer months, the water temperature will, perhaps surprisingly for many foreigners, be very pleasant and beaches will be packed. Outdoor swimming pools can be found at Frognerparken and T\u00f8yenbadet.\n* Discover the city and its major tourist sites by bike, from April through October.\n* Be sure to check their event calendar, every week they have concerts with a variety of international and Norwegian bands and/or DJs. Each Sunday there is a free jazz/blues/soul concert. Walk up the river from the center and you'll find it. Old factory-style houses with lots of graffiti.\n* Explore Oslo with a historic vessel or spend a summer evening in the Oslo Fjord.\n* Kayaking & packrafting tours, courses, and paddleboarding. Also, Mad Goats are available to introduce the floating saunas.\n* The area around Holmenkollen (T-bane 1) is well suited for cross-country skiing, but also a nice area for hiking during summertime. While you are there, you can also visit the ski museum which is located close to the ski jump.\n* Silent Oslo Fjordcruise, Oslo Dinner Cruise, Brunch & Bubbles, Morning Yoga Cruise and Electric afterwork.\n* Akerselva is considered clean north of Nydalen. The best spot may be at Frysja (bus 22-25-54 to Stillatorget). Don't forget that many of the lakes in \"Oslomarka\" are for swimming and recreation, but a couple of the major lakes (Maridalsvannet in particular) are drinking water for the city. Buy a map and bring your swimming gear!\n* \n* \n* Nice gateways to the beautiful nature are T-bane to Frognerseteren (line 1), Sognsvann (line 6), Roms\u00e5s (line 5), Bogerud (line 3), Skullerud (line 3) or Ellingsrud\u00e5sen (line 2), or the train to Movatn or Snippen (local trains towards Hakadal, Roa, Jaren and Gj\u00f8vik). Also, bus 56 from Storo (tram 11, 12, 13 and T-bane) to Solemskogen or bus 51 from Nydalen (bus 37, T-bane 4, 5 and 6) to Maridalen offer fantastic possibilities for walks and rural life, everything less than half an hour from the city center. Bring something to drink and a chocolate bar (and do a bit of planning, buses 51 and 56 and the train seldom run more than once every half hour, less on weekends). Be prepared for some muddy sections of the trail as they take you through some pretty thickly wooded areas. The forest is dense enough that any damp areas of the trail don't dry out. This isn't helped by the multitude of small run-offs flowing down the mountain.\n* \n* Two courses with 9 holes Crazy Minigolf. This is a challenging and fun experience you won't soon forget. Try them. On the way, you will be served something good in a glass. Team up with your friends or colleagues for play. It is approx. 45 minutes to play through 9 holes.\n*"

The city is located in the southern end of Santiago Island and has year round good weather. The city is divided into various small unofficial districts, the most important ones being, Plateau (city center), Achada Santo Antonio, Palmarejo, Fazenda, Achada Grande, Varzea, Safende, Sucupira(bazaar area), Calbeciera, Terra Branca, Vila Nova, Achadinha, Bairro, Prainha, Monte Vermelho, Achada Mato, Achada Sao Felipe, and other smaller ones. Most part of the city are residential areas, so probably not worth visiting in itself, but worth a half-day exploration if you are passing through to another destination.\n \nThe center of the city lies on a plateau overlooking the bay to the southeast. The airport lies a few kilometers to the northeast.\n \nGet in\n \nPraia has an international airport. TACV (national flag carrier) and TAP airlines fly to various destinations in Europe, Africa, South America and United States. Taxis from the airport to Plateau cost 800/1000. You can pay in Euros (10\u20ac to Praia in June 2016). There is one bus line that serves the airport but it\u2019s better to just take a taxi since there is actually only one or two buses that serves this line. You can also enter the city through the port. There are ferry boats that have irregular service to and from the islands of Maio, Boavista, Sal and Sao Nicolau, and more regular and scheduled service to and from Sao Vicente and Fogo. You can exchange money at hotel (1 \u20ac= 105 Escudos) or in the city (1 \u20ac= 110 \u20ac in June 2016).\n \nGet around\n \nThe city has countless bus stops, and taxis are everywhere waiting for customers. There are two main bus companies that serve the city, Moura Company and Sol Atlantico. Each route has their own numbers. The main lines are from Safende to Achada Santo Antonio, Vila Nova to Achada Santo Antonio, Calbeceira to Palmarejo, Pensamento to Terra Branca, Achada Grande to Achada Santo Antonio, Sao Felipe to Plateau, Ponta D'Agua to Plateau,Achada Mato to Palmarejo. Most of these lines pass by Plateau (city center), Varzea and Terra Branca, the bus fair is about 35 escudos. When it comes to taxis you should be careful with illegal taxis that sometimes roam around and might rip you off. The normal taxi fare between two furthest points of the city shouldn\u2019t be more 1500 escudos in daytime and 1800 escudos at night time, example Pensamento to Palmarejo, or Palmarejo to Achada Mato. Taxi drivers usually expect to get a tip, give around 50 escudos to 100 escudos. Just be careful and always drive with the taxis that have a taximeter, so that they don\u2019t overcharge you.\n \nThe city doesn\u2019t really have a good way to navigate because of the lack of an official map. This is because large part of the city doesn\u2019t have their names or house numbers yet. In the city center and in the more important parts of the city most streets have names and numbers. However, most people are friendly and will give you directions. Walking by foot between the different districts is not recommended, especially since most of the city's side walks are made out of loose cobblestone and is difficult to walk, also because the city is full of hills that can be tiring to walk. But if you want to have a good cardio-workout try it!\n \nSee\n \n*\n \n*\n \n*\n \nDo\n \nBuy\n \nAv. Amircal Cabral is the main street.

Most crimes involve petty thievery and these are mostly focused on actual residents and not on tourists, although there have been a few cases which involved tourists. So Praia is still a very safe city, just be careful with flaunting any expensive jewelry or gadgets like iPhones and such. Cape Verde in the past few years has seen an increase of petty crimes which are done mostly by groups of young people so avoid groups of young men especially at night.\n \nPraia is also a badly illuminated city at night, so be careful in places that might not have street lights and is somewhat isolated, always travel in pairs or in groups for safety. However if anything does occur there are police stations in various parts of the city and a general hospital in the city center.\n \nThe stairs at the edge of Achada Santo Antonio towards Plateau are unsafe, also during the day, avoid that neighbourhood.\n \nAt night, take a taxi.\n \n \nCope\n \n \nEmbassies & Consulates\n \n* \n \n* \n \n* \n \n* \n \nGet out\n \n, the historic capital, is an easy half-day trip.\n \nYou can rent a car or ask for a full day tour (9 hours) for a round trip island."

You can also check beautiful churches and convents, such as the Iglesia Regina Angelorum and the Convento de los Dominicos. Don't miss the Panteon Nacional, where the national heroes are buried, located in the Calle Las Damas, the New World's first (European) street! Also, walk up the Calle del Conde, a very old pedestrian shop-lined street that used to be the commercial heart of the city. This street leads to the Puerta de la Independencia, where the Dominican Republic proclaimed its independence from Haiti, and the Parque Independencia, where the country's founding fathers' remains are kept. On Sunday evenings, check out the Ruinas de San Francisco for live bands playing Merengue, Bachata, Salsa and Son, in a wonderful weekly show where both locals and tourists dance, drink and enjoy themselves. This would be an unforgettable experience! Also check out La Atarazana street after dark for a variety of romantic outdoor cafes with a spectacular view of the Alcazar and bay area. One such brasserie, Pat E Palo, has operated uninterrupted since 1505. Check out the house where Ponce DeLeon lived before he embarked upon his quest for the fountain of youth and ended up discovering Florida.\n* This waterfront boulevard is home to several huge hotel/casino complexes and dozens of small restaurants, clubs and cafes. Go there to people watch, take a romantic carriage ride or just have a few beers. Site of many festivals and concerts throughout the year. Parallel to the Malecon you will find Avenida Independencia, a tree lined street full of shops, bed and breakfasts and affordable restaurants with a nice mix of locals and tourists. For a unique dining experience check out Adrian Tropical, a traditional Dominican restaurant literally built on the water, or San Gil, a more formal eatery occupying the ruins of a colonial fort. The Malecon Center, located on the far end of the Malecon, is a new and still underoccupied high-end shopping center/hotel/condo complex with a Botero sculpture out front that reportedly cost US$1 million.\n* This amazing complex is home to the National Theater and five museums, ranging from the dilapidated and mundane, to the crisp, modern Museum of Modern Art the largest in the Caribbean and home to exhibits by artists from Jamaica, Bahamas, Puerto Rico, and of course, the Dominican Republic. If want a nice beautiful garden to read or talk this is your place also. \n* Find your way to the Parque Mirador Sur, an impressive park overlooking the coast. It gets closed for cars on weekdays between 5 and 8 am and pm, as well as on Sundays, enabling it to get filled with families playing with their children and exercising. Bike rentals are at your disposal.\nAlso, you can visit the Jardin Botanico, a vast, beautiful and lush park situated near one of Santo Domingo's most exclusive neighborhoods. There you can experience different ecosystems from a rain-forest to a Japanese garden!\n* Referred to as Santo Domingo Oriental, this separate municipality is not very tourist-friendly. Fortunately, most of its attractions are very close to the Colonial Zone and easy to get to. Check out Los Tres Ojos, or Three Eyes, a series of open-roof caverns and underground lakes for the whole family to explore (with a local this part of Santo Domingo is the most poverty stricken and can be dangerous!!!!). Head over to the Faro a Colon, a huge lighthouse and monument to Christopher Columbus which not only houses his remains but doubles as a museum. Check out the Santo Domingo Aquarium, a small but impressive showcase of the local aquatic life. If you're looking for some shopping, you can go to the Megacentro, Santo Domingo's largest shopping mall. It is massive!"

By mid-summer the water is warm enough to swim at Hanlan's Point or for the more adventurous, a nude beach is located nearby. \n* Walking. Toronto has so many eclectic neighborhoods that a random walk is fascinating in its own right. You might start in the Downtown area and then try other neighborhoods around the city. You will also find that Toronto is \"the city within a park\", with miles and miles of parkland following the streams and rivers that flow through the city. Edwards Gardens and the Toronto Botanical Gardens in the neighborhood of might be the place to start exploring this natural environment. Also, the City of Toronto has designated various Discovery Walks which highlight both the natural and human history of the region. These can be found with brown circular signs along the route and highlight other regions such as the Belt Line, Garrison Creek, and the Humber River as well as the downtown core. Toronto also has its famous PATH \"underground walkway,\" which connects the Toronto Financial District, and Union Station, and now allows walking indoors from the waterfront up to the Eaton Centre. The PATH pedestrian network has more than 1200 shops, more than the West Edmonton Mall."

If you're returning from the Botanic Gardens by foot, this is great place to meander through and check out the epitaphs of early pioneers and historical figures. \n* Mt Victoria Lookout. A visit to Wellington is not complete without checking out Wellingtons most popular lookout, offering stunning views across the city and harbour.\n*Red Rocks/ Seal Colony. This is an interesting walk named for its distinctive red rocks (probably Jasper). Take the number 1 bus to the end (Island Bay). Walk across the park towards the ocean and hang a right. There is another bus, number 4, that goes to the end of the road but only at certain times. Travel west (right side, if facing the water) until you run out of road. Here you will find a disused quarry and a visitors center (open daily from 10am - 6pm, later in summer). The walk along this beach is pleasant but rocky and often very windy, so dress accordingly. The road is shared (except Sundays) with 4WDs and other motor traffic. If one walks for about 1 hour you will come across a distinctive pass though the rock face. Just on the other side of this is a seal colony (in May-October)that is worth the walk. Please bear in mind that these are wild animals and so require a certain level of respect, so keep your distance and do not get between them and the sea, especially if you value your health! Continuing on from here, you will eventually arrive at Makara (but this is a long distance, and the seal colony is a recommended turn-around point).\n*Circa Theatre \n*Bats Theatre \n*Capital E National Theatre for Children \n*The Embassy Theatre \n*Beck's Incredible Film Festival. Incredibly strange, exploitation cinema and extra low budget movies.\n*Festival of the Arts February/March every two years.\n*Comedy Festival.\n*Fringe Festival \n*Polo. Wellington is well-know for Polo and Equestrian events including horse shows, jumping and dressage.\n*Dance Music \n*Dive the frigate Wellington (F69). Probably the world's most accessible dive wreck. Just a few kilometres around the coast from Wellington International Airport. Sunk on 13 November 2005 in 23 to 26 metres of water off Island Bay on Wellington's south coast. The wreck lies about 600 metres southeast of Taputeranga Island (the island of Island Bay) at 41&deg; 21'.270 S., 174&deg; 46'.770 E.\n*Take a ferry across the harbour to Eastbourne and Days Bay beach, or Somes island for a short hike. Go down to Queen's Wharf and check out the destinations and times.\n* Kaitoke Regional Park If you're feeling more adventurous, head north 30-40 minutes drive to the Kaitoke Regional Park, a hidden gem not as well known to tourists, but a popular spot for Wellingtonians. Take an easy paced walk through lush rainforest until you stumble across historic dams, the canopy bridge, and the \"Rivendale\" filming location from the Lord of the Rings movies. If it's a warm summers day or you're feeling brave, take a swim in the river or go kayaking.\n*Oriental Parade is Wellington's most beautiful street. Wellingtonians and visitors run, walk, cycle, rollerblade and eat at the great cafes & restaurants on this strip or sunbathe at the beach."

                "Yangon is the most exotic of all Southeast Asian cities. A walk down a typical street, the sights show noticeable commercial and traffic signs written mostly in local alphabet, not to mention the appearance of wandering monks in burgundy robes and the gilded pagodas as this is expected in this Buddhist country, and down to the locals keeping up their appearances. Here, everyone seemed to be comfortable with walking barefoot - indoors or outdoors; with faces applied with sun protection cream from the extracts of a tree branch called Thanaka; smiles reddened by bloody red juice from chewing betel nut; as well as being used to images of men wearing a sarong-like garment, the longyi.",
                "* However, there have been isolated incidents involving tourists so it is best to take normal big-city precautions like avoiding lonely areas at night and always being cognizant of your valuables. As with everywhere else in the world, there is no substitute for common sense.",
                "Do\n* It is a way to get a tiny glimpse of life along the commuter rail corridor in Yangon. For experienced travelers, though, the train is monotonous and doesn't reveal more than train stations and a handful of water spinach fields. A ticket is available at the Station Masters office at (Platform No 7 at Yangon Station). To get to platform 7, take the walkway above the tracks east of the station along Pansodan Street, and go down the last stair to the south. The train departs from the west end of the platform. The station itself, in true British colonial style, is a grand building that combines functional Western styles with Burmese architectural elements (layered ornamental roof). Vendors, vegetable sellers, monks, and commuters, all use the train which passes through the many villages that surround Yangon. The scenery changes from urban to rural fairly quickly and villages with ponds, kids, and cows pass by. The journey takes three hours. As of February 2020, due to construction on the railroad part north of the airport, the train only goes to Insein station to the northwest, and to the Mingaladon station to the northeast, not a full circle! At the Yangon Station, the train departs from either Platform No 4 or No 7, one going clockwise and the other going anti-clockwise. The eastern half is perhaps the most interesting if you are interested in agricultural activity. Do get on the train at a fast pace, as the train stops at the station for a short while only and leaves whether people have fully boarded the train or not!\n* There are only two cultural dance shows lumped with buffet dinners sponsored by restaurants with the commercial profits in mind limited to snippets of folk and royal dances. The National Theater holds events only on special occasions, the rest of the year, they are not busy since there is no critical mass audience to support them. This is a great way to learn about the local dishes. The waiters are happy to write the dishes' names in Burmese. This really helps when ordering in other restaurants.\n* Yangon, which is supposed to be the cultural capital of Myanmar is sadly having a shortage of it. The de facto capital could be Mandalay where the remnants of anything that has to do with royalty - which is associated with arts and culture and whose patronage served as the model or foundation of what is now is claimed as Burmese Culture - are still surviving. While the British during the colonial era were too busy with something else such as India or getting much even richer propagating the empire to develop Yangon firmly as a cultural capital.\n* Dallah, a small village across the river from Yangon, is an interesting ferry ride, particularly if you won't have the opportunity to catch a local ferry elsewhere in Burma. The ride is brief but filled with all the craziness of a Burmese ferry: you can buy freshly sliced watermelon, cheroots, cigarettes, tea, all kinds of interesting-looking food, and various knick-knacks from the many vendors who pack the ferry. The ferry is two-tiered. The lower deck has plastic seats possibly for rent - small plastic chairs (kid-sized!) are available for rent for 5 kyats (odds are that the chair rental agent won't take your money) and larger deck chairs for 15-20 kyats. The Upper deck has seats for free. Upstairs, kids will jostle to sell you packets of what is used as bird food. You throw it out to acrobatic gulls flying in a circular pathway looking to get a morsel! The ferry ride seems more like a floating market than a means of transportation! Combine the ride with a trip to Thane (see Get out below) for a half or full-day trip. There is a pagoda (what else) at Dallah worth a visit but otherwise, the village is not really a destination. The Dallah ferry leaves from the Pansodan Road Jetty across from The Strand Hotel. Once on Dala, you'll be mobbed by tricycle men who try to sell you a ride around the area. Be careful about the pricing. There's a gang who will first tell you one price but at the end of the journey, will gang up on you and tell you that you owe them 400% more for the effort. They will also tell you that their bicycle is broken halfway and plead with you to give them more - for instance, they might snatch the ignition key and argue that now they have to replace all the locks which cost quite a lot. One way out of it is to be calm, smile and bargain - you would still pay, but you can halve the price - but whatever you choose, stay calm and smile, and don't raise your voice. It'd be OK to point out to the guy that he is very angry, which makes him calm down a little. One more scam around is that they bring you to a poor village and ask you to donate rice. Much of it is a scam. Whatever you do, stay safe and make sure you know how much they intend to charge you by the half-hour rates.\n* There is offered to experience the local way of life and the produce on offer in the local markets of Myanmar. The cooking demonstration takes place upstairs in the hotel's Mindon lounge where you will learn to cook a traditional Myanmar salad.\n*The only place in Yangon that specializes in Traditional Burmese Foot Massage in an open hall concept. It provides a safe and comfortable environment for all travelers to indulge in a healthy and relaxing massage after a day's walk along the nearby streets of busy Chinatown. The staff are able to converse in English.\n*Transit Shed No.1, located in the centre of one of Southeast Asia\u2019s most historically significant and iconic areas of exchange, houses Yangon\u2019s first Pop-Up Project. Named TS1 Yangon, it includes 2 distinct spaces: a gallery and a retail space. In keeping with the pop-up concept, new gallery exhibitions and retailers rotate into TS1 Yangon regularly. All content is Myanmar-focused, with a twist. The space will host a carefully planned program of cultural and social activities, including concerts, literary readings, performances, screenings, trunk shows, and workshops. Both the TS1 Gallery and the retail space are open to the public daily.\n* The Yangon Waterboom is Myanmar's first modern water park and home to an array of exciting entertainment and attractions. Located in Shu Khin Thar, Thar Kay Ta Township, Yangon, this family recreational destination offers 20 world-class rides, slides, and facilities that will take FUN to a whole new level. It also features multiple open-air and under-cover function areas available for children\u2019s parties, team-building events, or just a simple gathering. It is the first of its kind in Myanmar, which offers full action-packed entertainment for the entire family, children and teens alike. The filtered water for this theme park with wave pools, twisting slides, and a meandering river is from the none-too-clean Yangon River, so you might want to think twice before diving in. The park also has paintball and some other out-of-water activities. It also incorporates distinctive outside and under-cover work domains open for youths' get-togethers, gather building events, or just an essential party. It is the first of its kind in Myanmar, which offers a full activity stuffed amusement for the whole family, youngsters, and adolescents alike. You can visit, explore and experience this place.\n*Yangon Yoga House Was born out of the desire to bring together the growing community of yogis in Myanmar's major city under one roof. YYH was opened to encourage practitioners of all levels to explore, share, and grow their own yoga practice in a common space. In addition to yoga, YYH offers pilates, barre, endurance, and cardio workouts and personal 1:1 training with the goal of offering balanced wellness options for everyone at every level of fitness. Check out their website for the latest workshops and yoga retreats. The downtown studio is attached to Nourish Cafe, a popular laid-back plant-based cafe serving a mix of delicious food, from vegan burgers to vegan shawarma pitta bread sandwiches."
