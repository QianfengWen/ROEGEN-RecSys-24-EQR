Puebla is a city in . It is in the Puebla Valley, surrounded by volcanoes and snow-capped mountains, slightly over 110 kilometers (68 miles) south-east of Mexico City. The city proper in 2005 had a population of 1.5 million people, while the metropolitan area had a population of 2.1 million.
Understand
The city of Puebla is the fourth largest city in Mexico with 2.1 million inhabitants and the Capital of the State of Puebla. It was founded on April 16, 1531 as "La Puebla de los Ángeles". It was the first city in central Mexico founded by the Spanish conquistadors that was not built upon the ruins of a conquered Amerindian settlement. Its strategic location, between the port of and , made it the second most important city during the colonial period. During the seventeenth century, Sor lived in the city until her confrontation with the Bishop of Puebla.

The city’s main claim to fame, however, is Cinco de Mayo, a festival commemorating the May 5, 1862 defeat of a French expeditionary army by Mexican general Ignacio Zaragoza. It was after this battle that the name of the city was changed to "Heróica Puebla de Zaragoza". The forts where the battle took place are a major tourist attraction of the city and the site of an annual month-long carnival marking the anniversary of the battle. The city is also famous for its cuisine, being said it is this city where "Mole" -a famous Mexican spicy thick sauce- was invented.

Get in
By bus
Traveling to Puebla from Mexico City is fairly straightforward via bus. There are continual bus services between Mexico City and Puebla throughout the day and night both from the TAPO terminal (also known as Terminal Oriente, located beside the San Lázaro Metro station) and from Benito Juarez International Airport. Occasional buses go to/from the other terminals in Mexico City - e.g. ADO run a service from the Terminal del Norte several times a day ($184 MXN).

A one-way ticket on Estrella Roja or ADO from the TAPO usually runs about $160 MXN for regular direct service; a first class ticket ("Pullman Primera Clase" service) on Estrella Roja costs about $180-$200 MXN as of October 2016. Buses leave for Puebla approximately every fifteen minutes from TAPO and every 40 minutes or so. Travel time from TAPO to Puebla's CAPU is usually around 2 hours, but this time may vary by up to a full hour depending on Mexico City traffic conditions at that time of day. Taking an Estrella Roja bus to/from the airport (leaving from 4 Poniente) costs about $290 MXN for a one-way ticket. 

Buses are also available from many other cities and towns, including Oaxaca, San Cristobal de las Casas, Tuxtla Gutierrez, Cuernavaca, Xalapa, Veracruz, Zacatlán, Cuetzalan, Tlaxcala, Tehuacán, Huamntla, and Juchitan among others, including less frequent services to destinations such as Cancún, Mérida, Puerto Escondido, and Acapulco. 

From nearby Cholula, there are many buses, or you can get a taxi for approximately $50-150, depending on the number of passengers and time of day.

There are several bus terminals in Puebla: the Centro de Autobuses Puebla (CAPU), the main bus terminal, and Estrella Roja’s 4 Poniente bus terminal, this terminal is located in downtown Puebla (in March 2022 could not find 4 Poniente), and Paseo y Destino ( a new, clean, modern terminal with service to many locations, including Benito Juarez airport every half hour during the day. Paseo Y Destino also has a Covid testing facility with results sent to you in half an hour, so you receive them on your way to the airport. Both Estrella Roja and ADO run buses to CAPU and Paseo y Destino. At 4 Poniente, there are secure taxis (called Top Driver Express) in which you pay the cashier and not the driver. Secure taxis are also available from CAPU. Several local buses enter the station, and many others pass within 1-2 blocks. 4 Poniente is a much smaller terminal, though CAPU is relatively easy to navigate as well. The CAPU is almost 2 miles north of the Historic Center where the Zocalo is.

By air
Alternatively, Hermanos Serdán International Airport (PBC) is an international airport located near Puebla with direct flights from Houston (United), Dallas (American), Panama City (Copa), and several cities within Mexico.

From the airport, there are a few ways to get to the city center. Taxi will cost around $400 MXN. Volaris offers a shuttle to the city center for $80 MXN, which leaves once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Or, there is a public bus that passes by the airport every half hour, which costs $18 MXN ($1 USD). The bus is orange and will drop you off by the Ferrocarrilera.

Get around
Traveling within Puebla can sometimes be stressful as the local public transportation system is entirely privatized, leading to hundreds of bus routes, none of which are mapped out. If you know where you are going, you can ask around as to which route will take your destination, but often transfers are necessary for long-distances, which can be confusing, especially if you are not familiar with the language. The general fare rate is $6 MXN. (Safety note about buses: they are generally safe, but they tend to carry , especially when crowded. Always have a hand over any bags/backpacks that you have.) The buses generally run from about 7AM to 10PM.

Taxis are naturally more expensive, but in Puebla they are deemed safer. They tend to run between $40-80 MXN for a ride. Negotiating a fare before entering a taxi is normal as the taxis do not carry meters in Puebla. If the driver does not offer you a fare that you like, you can always just wave them off and wait for the next taxi.

Do
 
* Visit other towns, if you can, such as in the Sierra Norte de Puebla, or . 

* Go to the National Park on Popocatepetl or and spend the day hiking or camping there.

* If you like night life, try the antros (clubs) in . Many don't charge a cover. Alcohol ranges from $450-800 MXN a bottle if you want to get a table in the clubs. There is also abundant live music throughout Puebla. Smaller and less popular antros are also located in the Los Sapos district, only a few blocks from the Zocalo.

* Visit the churches of Tonantzintla and Acatepec. They were built and decorated during the late 1600s and early 1700s in the Baroque style. Both are extremely lavishly decorated outside and inside.

* Take a tour around the city on a tour bus. This may seem very touristy but this is a really cheap ($80 MXN) easy way to get a quick view of some of the coolest attractions in the city. It also is a way to get a good bearing before you decide to set off and dive into some of the attractions the city has to offer. The tour is in Spanish, but you can ask for headphones when you get on the bus and then you'll be able to listen to a translated in several languages. The bus has several stops along the route where you can get down and get up.

* If you are in the mood for authentic Italian cuisine, head over to the nearby town of Chipilo, just 15 minutes from downtown Puebla and near Cholula and Atlixco. This town was settled by Veneto immigrants from northern Italy in the late 1800's. Take a stroll around the Piazza, the Chiesa (Church), and try the many restaurants it has to offer such as Piazza delle Sole, Caffe Ristorante I Dagot, Ristorante Venezia; or have a cafe in the original "The Italian Coffee Co." and people watch. Gelato at Topolino is also a good way to have dessert. And do not forget to buy pastas, cheeses, cold cuts and wines at the Nave Italia store. Stop to listen to the people speak their 19th century Venetian dialect which still survives in Chipilo. Take a stroll around the town which still holds many aspects of typical rural Venetian towns. Truly a unique gem in the middle of Puebla.

Eat
Eat the street food. Travel books will almost always tell you not to, but generally speaking, it is entirely safe and can be one of the best "cultural" experiences of your trip.

Street foods to try:
*Quesadillas with mushrooms, sausage (chorizo), pumpkin flower (flor de calabaza), or huitlacoche (corn truffle, an Aztec specialty)

*Memelas (tortillas made with mixed masa and beans red or green salsa on top, then topped with onions and cheese)

*Elote (corn on the cob with parmesan cheese, mayonnaise if desired, and chili powder).

*Pelonas (fried sandwiches filled with meat, lettuce, cream, and salsa)

*Gorditas (similar to memelas, but topped with chorizo, chicharron--fried pig skin)--or chicken, avocado slices, salsa, onions, and cheese).

*Potato chips, usually fried the same day (extra crispy) and topped with lime juice and hot sauce.

*Mixiotes Piece of Chicken or "Carnero" (Goat) in a special sauce made out of juajillo chile and spices with an avocado leaf cooked in vapor all wrapped in foil paper or special mixiote paper. 

*Chalupas a tortilla with green or red sauce then topped with onion, chicken or beef shreds, and cheese. (Traditional chalupas have no cheese.)

*Cemitas a special bread that looks like a torta prepared with milanesa, avocado, queso oaxaca in shreds, papalo, aceite de comer and chipotles.

All street food generally costs between $8-15.

* A must is something with "Mole poblano".

* Chiles en Nogada
* Pozole
* Pambazos
* Pipian
* Adobo
* Chanclas

You can find most of these street food near traditional markets or flea-markets like "La Acocota", "Mercado Hidalgo". Be cautious as the zones of these markets are not touristic spots.
Some good restaurants include:
*Traditional Cuisine; fine dining. The best mole poblano; other seasonal dishes, Spanish cuisine. Steps from the Cathedral and Zócalo.

*Excellent Italian and Mexican cuisine, at good prices. Apparently known for holding the Guinness World Record for the largest pizza. Try their garlic bread and their pastas if you're not in the pizza mood (they make a mean Pennette Arrabiata). They also serve traditional poblano cuisine. Extensive wine and beverage list. Has an area for outside seating, though this may be full at peak hours; also has two floors of indoor seating.

*Located on the south street by El Parián market. Excellent local cuisine for less than you'd spend in the Zócalo area; their chiles en nogada are especially delicious. $100 for a chile en nogada with a soup and a dish of rice w/ mole poblano (half of what you'd spend for the same in the Zócalo). They also sell their excellent mole poblano by the kilo or half-kilo.

* K-ctus Café (2 sur, zócalo) has a nice atmosphere with a shop in front, good coffee and sweets, and good sandwiches and salads. Very reasonably priced at $40-50 for a combo that includes a panini, chips, and a good salad. 

Deli Café (23 Sur y 13 Poniente) has excellent salads, wraps, and sandwiches when you want a break from grease. Most entrees are $40-$55. 

*Mr Pampas do Brasil. Exquisite Brazilian churrasqueria. Offers a wide meat buffet. $250 per person. Is located in Avenida Juarez. 
Las Sombrillas (13 Poniente between 23 Sur & 25 Sur) makes great juices and aguas naturales, breakfasts (fruit salads, chilaquiles) and light lunches (baguettes) along with the best plátanos fritos in town- they're smothered in sweet cream and chocolate sprinkles for only $30. 

Pizzeria Amalfi (Avenida Juárez) has great pizzas. $100-160 for a pizza that feeds 2-3. 

Los Tapatíos (9 Sur y 29 Poniente, second location across from Container City in Cholula) has great Jalisco-style food. Burritos are the highlight of the menu, and their birria and pollo pibil are particularly good. For sides, nopales al ajillo (garlic cactus) are a must-order. 

The best value almost anywhere is the "comida corrida" for lunch- 3-4 courses for as little as $35, and usually no more than $60. Generally comes with a soup, a rice or pasta dish (sometimes a tostada), and a main course (milanesa, flautas, arrachera, pechuga asada, etc.) with a side or two (beans, salad, plátano frito, chalupas, etc.). Often these will also come with a drink (agua de horchata, jamaica, etc.) and desert (gelatina, plátano frito, arroz con leche, pastel). Breakfast versions may include chilaquiles, huevos, or quesadillas, with sides of beans, fruit, yogurt, or cereal and coffee or juice. These can be found all over, but many restaurants are located within several blocks of the zócalo in all directions (try upstairs in Plaza Victoria). Many are also located near universities, in particular near UPAEP in Santiago neighborhood (23 sur y 13 poniente). 

Just in the "Zócalo" (main square) there's a place called Vittorio's; it's famous for the excellent and delicious Mexican and Italian food. Very nice and cozy; they have indoor and a terrace and more important very clean. They made it into the Guinness Book of Records for making the biggest pizza ever; and in the night upstairs they have the bar La Vita è Bella for an amazing collection of folding knives and other cool stuff. Near the Zócalo, you can eat at El Mural, probably the best mole poblano in town; also famous for other seasonal dishes and its Spanish cuisine. For drinks with a view to the square go to Hotel Royalty, popular with locals and tourist. Hotel La Purificadora, a few blocks away, offers a more sophisticated dining and lodging experience. For those who want to venture to other neighborhoods, go to Restaurante La Noria with a beautiful Mexican patio, enjoy contemporary Mexican cooking in what used to be a nice Hacienda. For more avant-garde food, go to Intro on Calzada Zavaleta, where Chef Ángel Vázquez will pamper you with a weekly changing menu.

Remember that Puebla has the most culinary schools in Mexico and these new professionals enjoy showing off their skills to locals and visitors alike.

*Beautifully architected hotel in the heart of the city. Always someone available who spoke English. Delicious food. Feels more like a Colonial fort than a hotel (in a good/charming way). Lost electricity a few times in 4 days. Spacious gaps under the doors mean you can hear noise throughout the hotel.

Stay safe
Drink bottled water and be careful with valuables in public.

You will rarely see locals wearing shorts, doing so will identify you as a tourist. Jeans are generally acceptable, except perhaps in some of the nicer restaurants. 

If you are staying in a hotel and you want to take a taxi, someone working the front desk will most likely be able to call and arrange for a cab to pick you up, or you can hail one off the street if you speak enough Spanish to be able to negotiate the price with the driver. In Puebla, there are a multitude of taxis but your best bet will be a radio taxi.

The radio taxis are the best cabs in appearance and since they are registered they are also the safest, but they tend to charge more: about $10 MXN more than if you hail one on the street. If you run into a friendly cab driver, it is a good idea to get his cell phone number, so you can call whenever you need safe transport.

Locals recommend taking Ubers over taxis off the street. They are considered safer, and are typically cleaner and newer cars with friendlier and more educated drivers.

You could protect your budget by speaking to the sellers (especially the street ones) in Spanish, because most of them offer higher prices to foreigners who may not know the real prices of the products.

Study Spanish
