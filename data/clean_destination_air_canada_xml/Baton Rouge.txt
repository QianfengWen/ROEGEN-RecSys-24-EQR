Baton Rouge is the capital of , . Located on the east bank of the mighty Mississippi River, Baton Rouge is Louisiana's second largest city, home of Louisiana State University (LSU), major port facilities, and a variety of attractions.

Understand 

The city name was coined over 300 years ago when on 17 March 1699, Pierre Le Moyne, Sieur d'Iberville, led an expedition along the Mississippi River. The early French explorers found a pole stained with the blood of fish and animals that served as the dividing line between the Bayougoula and Houmas Indians. It is from this "red stick" that Iberville christened the city "le Baton Rouge", French for "red stick". 

The small town was selected as the new capital of the state of Louisiana in 1817, and it's been growing ever since. The capital was returned to for a while during and after the troubles of the American Civil War, but it was moved back in 1882. 

 Climate 
Baton Rouge has a semi-tropical climate, perfect for outdoor activities.

The weather is consistently warm from May-Sep. Be warned that, like the rest of the Southern United States during the summer, it can become down-right miserable, with sustained temperatures in the 90s (°F) with 100% humidity. Proper medical precautions should be taken if planning on partaking in outdoor activities, such as ample amounts of sunscreen and hydration. Also, there are many days throughout July that are classified as "ozone days," which are days on which the level of ground-level ozone is severe, causing health problems in sensitive individuals. This should be taken into consideration before planning outdoor activities throughout the summer months.

Winter is usually mild and short-lived. Spring is glorious with cool nights and warm, sunny days. A light jacket is all that is needed. Fall is mild and only a light sweater is needed in the evenings. 

Precipitation is reasonably well-distributed and ample throughout the year with an average annual precipitation of 55 in (140 cm) 
Average summer temperature: 81.3°F (27°C)
Average winter temperature: 52.5°F (11°C)
