Do
Missouri River
The Missouri River is a favorite with locals for fishing, swimming, and other water sports. Please keep in mind that rivers can be dangerous. It is important that young children wear life jackets and all people are conscious of those around them.
* Lewis and Clark Riverboat is a 150-passenger paddle wheel riverboat based at the Port of Bismarck, River Road, Bismarck.

Dinner and beverage service available for regular cruises and charters. Narrations and reenactments provided during cruises. Call for regular scheduled cruises from April through October. Tel: (701)255-4233. Email: lewisandclark@uswest.net 
* The Desert is a local hangout in the summer. The desert is located on the east bank of the Missouri south of the University of Mary. It takes about 15-20 minutes to reach the desert by car. A boat ramp (Kimball Bottoms) is located in the area, and continuing past the boat ramp while following the shoreline for about another mile will bring you to a large sandbar beach where you may park your car and camp. This area is often extremely crowded during the summer, especially on holidays and weekends. During the week, it can be much more relaxing. A large area is located adjacent to the beach that is used by off-road vehicles, including dirt bikes and 4-wheelers.

While generally North Dakotans are very respectful and generous people, when large amounts of people are at the desert, it can be a hard place for families to enjoy time together. There is often plenty of partying and alcohol consumption. If you have small children, this is an area best avoided on weekends and major holidays (mainly the 4th of July), especially when the weather is good.

* Boating is a great way to spend a long weekend or a lazy summer evening. A map showing boat ramps can be found here. There are generally many sandbars available in the Bismarck area to dock on. Much like the desert, sandbars near the bridges in the middle of Bismarck-Mandan often become crowded and rowdy on hot summer days. Head away from the middle of town, to the north or south, for some seclusion and relaxation.

Water-skiing, tubing, and wakeboarding are all popular activities, as well. Be aware that it is often dangerous to do these things within the vicinity of the four bridges spanning the river, as there is often too much boat traffic. Heading one mile up or down river will help you to have a safer (and more fun!) time. Be aware that state law requires two people on the boat/jet-ski in cases of pulling someone on a tube, wakeboard, etc. One person is required to sit at the back of the boat and 'spot' for the people being pulled. There are state Game & Fish boats enforcing these rules.

* Play Cro-Shoes. This is a great river tradition. The game was invented by Vern Peterson, a local, in 1987. The game combines elements of horse shoes and other games to provide a unique sandbar game. Game sets are available at Scheel's Sports, located at Kirkwood Mall, or through the Cro-Shoes website contact page.

Ski & Snowboard
* Huff Hills Ski Area, located in the buttes on the western banks of the Missouri River, is the largest downhill ski area in North Dakota, with a vertical drop of 450 feet. Huff Hills is located 18 miles south of Mandan on ND State Highway 1806. The scenic drive takes around 45 minutes from Bismarck, and around 30 minutes from Mandan.
Cross-country skiing is often possible in Bismarck. Bismarck Parks & Recreation Department grooms trails at Riverwood Golf Course if snow conditions allow. It is often possible to ski in the countryside around Bismarck, but remember that trespassing on private property is a crime!

Bismarck offers two movie theaters (see movie showtimes):
* Carmike has a theater in Gateway Mall in North Bismarck.
* Locally-owned Grand Theaters is the favorite among local movie enthusiasts. It offers stadium seating in most of its theaters. The theater features curved screens, two giant screens, rocking seats, a theater with many loveseats, and lavish decor. If you find yourself in Theater 15, look up, there are twinkling stars in the ceiling. Grand Theaters is well worth the $7.75 to see a film. 
The Bismarck Civic Center is home to the Bismarck Bobcats(hockey), Dakota Wizards (Basketball) and the Roughriders (Arena Football.) The civic center also offers the occasional concert, featuring performers such as Clay Aiken.
*Dakota Zoo is located between Sertoma Park and the Missouri River in southwest Bismarck. It offers many fascinating exhibits, including moose, bears, and river otters. As of late 2007, admission is $3 for children 2-12, $6 for 13+, and children under the age of 2 are admitted free of charge.

Buy
Bismarck offers two major shopping malls, newly remodeled Gateway Fashion Mall in north Bismarck, and Kirkwood Mall in south Bismarck. Kirkwood Mall is the city's largest mall. It is anchored by Target, JCPenney, Herberger's, Scheel's Sports, and I. Keating Furniture World.
Besides the mall Bismarck has Wal-Mart, Kmart, Staples, Office Depot, and Menards. Bismarck added about 1.5 million square feet of retail during the past 12 months including two Super Walmarts, Sams Club, Lowes, Kohls, and many other shops. The majority of the newer retail centers are in the northern part of the city.

Eat
Keep in mind that most of Bismarck's commercialized restaurants are off of I-94 Exit 159 (Hwy. 83/State St.) or near Kirkwood Mall on the south side. For a more unique dining experience, explore restaurants in the historic Downtown area. This district's Fiesta Villa, in the former train station, or Peacock Alley, in the former Patterson Hotel are local favorites.

Many North Dakotans are meat eaters and these restaurants do not disappoint in this area. Pasta entrees and seafood are quite popular as well, rounding out most menus. Due to ND's landlocked location, seafood must be flown in regularly, so a seared ahi tuna steak is likely to be at least 'good'. However northern pike, walleye, buffalo, and pheasant are likely to be local and fresh. These items are worth a try to capture a more authentic taste of North Dakota. 

Budget
Bismarck offers multiple fast food restaurants.

Mid-range
*The Walrus N. 3rd St., in Arrowhead Plaza, (701)250-0020 has been a locally owned restaurant for over 10 years and is a local favorite.

Drink
Bismarck has multiple local adult establishments. Popularity shifts as frequently as the weather. If you're into the nightlife, you'd be better asking the locals where most people in your age group hang out. Borrowed Bucks Roadhouse, simply called Bucks, is consistently popular with 20- and 30-somethings. The Elbow Room can be a veritable local high school reunion on some weekend nights. 

If you like a variety of beers, try O'Briens, Sport's Page, or Peacock Alley.

The hangout for politicians when the state legislature is in session is the Peacock Alley Bar, located in the historic Patterson Hotel building in downtown Bismarck. Government-types have been calling the "Peacock" their after-hours home for more than half a century. The regular crowd includes a variety ranging from 20-somethings to middle-aged downtown business folk, generally people that appreciate the atmosphere, good conversation, and variety of libations the location has provided since first opening in 1911.

A tea shop that is a daily stop for locals. Once a dream by a local tea-maker is now a bustling business.

Stay safe
Bismarck is a relatively safe town. Your biggest danger is the winter weather. 
In the winter don't forget proper clothing for harsh weathers. For 20 days in Jan 04-Feb 04, the temp did not get above 0 deg F. The coldest temp was in Minot, ND, at -45F (-75 windchill) while Bismarck was at a "balmy" -43F.
If your car has a block heater, remember to plug it into a wall outlet. Local rental cars will have block heaters installed. If you don't know what to look for, ask the rental place; they will know. Block heaters will keep the car from freezing up during sub-zero temps.
From April-October, most of the state will conduct its road construction projects. During this season, plan for occasional delays in the city of Bismarck and on the roads to get to the city.
