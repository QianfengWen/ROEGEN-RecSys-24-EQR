Understand

Dayton is known as the Gem City and it's no wonder. In addition to being the birthplace of aviation (the Wright brothers, Orville and Wilbur, lived here and perfected their design for the first practical aircraft), it is also home to one of the few multi-site National Parks in the U.S.- the Dayton Aviation Heritage Park. There are several things to do and see in the region; the city itself and the suburbs that surround.

Climate
Dayton has a humid continental climate, which means, like the rest of Ohio, sees four very distinct seasons. 

;Winter : Being situated in the Midwest, winters are cold. Snowfall isn't particulary excessive; but it can at times fall at a rate that will cause havoc with traffic.
;Spring : Often cool, with cold and mild days sprinkled throughout the period. Storms during this period may produce tornadoes.
;Summer : Characteristically hot and humid. While the thermometer may read one number in the summer, it will often feel hotter due to humidity.
;Autumn : Autumn in Dayton and Southwest Ohio is usually cool, but an extension of summer-like days into this season is possible. Storms seem to increase during this season too, which, due to the fluctuation of temperatures can produce extremely dangerous storms with the potential of producing tornadoes late into the year.
