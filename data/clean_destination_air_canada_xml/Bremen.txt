See

* Theater am Goetheplatz (Theater/Opera House) this is one of the oldest buildings in Bremen and is renowned for its austere look. Under the name Schauspielhaus am Ostertor, the theatre was founded as the second establishment of the private firm Bremer Schaubühne. In so doing, the firm's directors Eduard Ichon and Johannes Wiegand, who in 1910 had opened the Schauspielhaus am Neustadtwall, widened competition with the municipal theatre, Stadttheater am Wall (now destroyed). Adapting their prices and presentations to suit all segments of the community, they were particularly successful in attracting audiences in the years following the First World War. On October 1, 1941 the Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler, personally visited the Theater and attended a showing of Die Valkyrie with his lover Eva Braun. However it was after the municipal theatre had suffered serious war damage during World War II, that it was decided the Schauspielhaus am Ostertor should be rebuilt as a fully-fledged three-genre establishment extending the seating from 804 to 1,111 while significantly altering the facade designed by August Abbehusen and Otto Blendermann in 1913. In keeping with the practices of the 1950s, the architects Werner Commichau and Hans Stormraising raised the height of the colonnade and eliminated the high hipped roof, successfully simplifying the facade and giving it a more austere appearance

* Rathaus (Town Hall) this is one of the finest in Europe and as such has been included on the .
