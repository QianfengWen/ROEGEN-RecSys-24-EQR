Verona is a city (pop. ~250,000) in north-eastern 's region. 

Understand

The city is famous as it is the place where William Shakespeare set his play Romeo and Juliet. Though situated two hours away from the more popular tourist destination, , many people consider Verona a more relaxed, pleasant place to visit. In the year 2000, Verona has become a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its urban structure and architecture.

History
The true origin of Verona is some kind of mystery. It was probably founded by an early Italic or Celtic people and then conquered by the Romans. In 89 BC the city became a colonia and in 49 BC it became a municipium. The importance of Verona grew rapidly because of its position at the junction of four of the most important Roman roads of that time.

See

Verona was taken over by the Roman Empire in the First Century BC and many Roman-era ruins have been preserved, notably the Arena (which is in the same style as Rome's Colosseum). Most of the historical sights, however, date from the past 800 years. If you are keen on art history, Verona offers a golden opportunity to see the transition of Western European art from late-Medieval to early-Renaissance styles, with its rich offering of 12-Century churches and art museums.

After the Roman Empire came to the Republic of Venice in 853 AD until Napoleon Bonaparte conquered the republic. After the Fall of Napoleon in 1815, the Austrian Empire took over the city until 1866.

Verona's military importance under the Austrians has also left city fortifications and a notable castle. Look out for architectural details related to the Scaligeri (or della Scala) family, who ruled the city from the 12th to 14th Century: their family emblem is a ladder, which appears in many places around Verona (scala is Italian for 'ladder').
* A large, spectacular Roman amphitheater, crumbling on the outside but still functioning today. It was erected in the 1st Century AD (c. 14-54CE) in an elliptical shape and is the world's third-largest amphitheater to survive from antiquity, and the eighth-largest amphitheater from Rome. Much of the outer ring was damaged during the earthquake of 1117 but the inner part is still intact. If you can, plan your trip during the Opera season and see a performance in the Arena. Besides the opera season, you can visit it during the day. A ticket to see the Arena when there are no events costs €10 for adults and can be bought at the front desk. Visitors have access to the arena itself, the stands, and the tunnels. A few informative texts are on display in one of the corridors in English and Italian.
* Located slightly outside the centre. A 10-15 minute walk from the Castellvecchio, but well worth the walk, as it is possibly the richest in devotional artwork and historical preservation in Verona. The church is dedicated to Verona's patron saint, Zeno, a 4th-century North African and a keen fisherman who was ordained Bishop of Verona in 363. Zeno's tomb lies in an atmospheric shrine in the church undercroft, and he is also commemorated with a grinning medieval statue of Zeno in full episcopal robes, dangling a golden fish on the end of a fishing rod. The entrance to the church is graced with an ornate Romanesque façade by Nicolò; like the cathedral, this church was erected after the earthquake of 1117. The church itself was a center of European pilgrimage for centuries; pilgrims were greeted by huge 10-meter frescoes of St Peter, the patron saint of pilgrims. Visitors across the centuries have left their mark - pilgrims happily inscribed graffiti in the frescoes, and signatures dating from 1390 survive to this day. There is also graffiti left by the invading Austrians in 1865.
* Climb the steps up the hill above the Roman Amphitheatre to the Castell San Pietro. This former Austrian barracks dates back to the Austrian occupation of the left bank, and while the building is not open to the public, the views from the hill over Verona are spectacular. Go up in the early evening and enjoy a romantic sunset for free!
* A 14th-century, red brick, fortified castle on the banks of the river Aldige. The main castle buildings house the city art museum which is packed with a rich collection of medieval sculpture and Renaissance paintings. As well as the museum, the extensive castle ramparts are great for exploring - ideal for families with children who enjoy running around castle fortifications. The Castelvecchio has an adjoining bridge over the river which is open all the time - walk over the bridge for some fantastic views of the castle on the river.
* 
* Verona used to be a walled city, and during its history, there were three different city walls: the first from Roman times, and then from the 12th and 14th centuries (the latter renovated in the 16th century.) A few gates can be seen throughout the city. They are:
** Located in Corso Porta Borsari, made of bricks for military purposes, probably during the 1st century, by the Romans.
** Located at Via Porta Catena, Porta Fura is part of the ancient enclosure of the San Zeno monastery. The access is by a first courtyard separated from the second by the Austrian "Blockhaus" (1840); after which Porta Catena can be found.
** Located in Via Leoni, it was erected in two stages, first during the 1st century, made of bricks, and then in the 2nd century, made of white stone.
** The namesake of the train station, located in Corso Porta Nuova. It dates from the 16th century, and was also designed by Michele Sanmicheli, as a reconstruction of the Porta di Santa Croce.
** Located in Stradone Porta Palio. It also dates from the 16th century and was designed by Michele Sanmicheli. There are three arches decorated with busts of war heroes.
** Located in Piazzetta S. Giorgio, built in the 14th century (1321 - 1324), rebuilt in the 16th by Giovanni Maria Falconetto, but only completed in 1840 during the Austrian rule.
** Located in Circonvallazione Maroncelli, designed by Michele Sanmicheli (notice the similarities with Porta Nuova) in the 16th century, named after the cathedral nearby.
** Located in Vicolo Porta Vescovo, originally made in the 13th century, enlarged and renovated on the 16th and later by the Austrians.
** Located on Lungadige Nicola Pasetto Deputato, built-in 1838 in order to defend the area between the bastion of Campus Martius and the left bank of the Adige. The gate was part of Fort Von Scholl, which was demolished.
* One of Italy's most important renaissance/mannerist gardens, with grottoes, fire-breathing masks carved into the hillside etc.
* Supposedly the location of the famous balcony love scene from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. The house is a major destination for tourist pilgrimage, as the tiny courtyard is normally packed with lovestruck teenagers photographing each other on the famous balcony. In fact, the house has no connection with Shakespeare's fictional characters - although the house is old, the balcony was added in 1936 and declared to be "Juliet's house" to attract tourists. You can visit the house itself - it contains a sparse collection of Renaissance frescoes rescued from other demolished palaces, and the bed from Zeffirelli's 1968 movie, but not a lot more. The balcony overlooks a tiny courtyard containing a statue of Juliet. There is an unbelievable amount of graffiti and general scrawling on the walls, floor, seats, and anything that will hold ink - there is a tradition of writing love messages to Juliet, and visitors leave notes, trinkets, and bits of chewing gum fashioned into love hearts. Juliet's house is a popular romantic shrine, but its popularity belies its value; compared to some of the treasures around Verona, Juliet's house has very little to offer. So, if Juliet lived here, what about Romeo? A couple of streets away the house at 4, Via Arche Scaligere has been designated as his home. It is private, so other than a sign on the wall there is nothing much to see.
* at the Capuchin Church, which also houses the Antonian Fresco Museum.
* Completed in 1463, this is the tallest of Verona's towers. The unmistakable clock tower looms over the Piazza delle Erbe, and you enter via the palace courtyard. Although there are 238 steps to the top, there is a lift! Views from the top are breathtaking.
* Sant' Anastasia, San Lorenzo Maggiore and San Fermo Maggiore
* Home of the Forum in Roman times this is still a focal point of the city. Contains the 'Britney Verona' fountain, 14th-century 'Gardello Tower', and a market that, while picturesque, seems to have become another tourist cliché during its recent refurbishment.
* Across the river on the hill, in the north-east of the city.
* Where theatre performances still take place. It is also the seat of the Archaeological Museum.
* A tiny chapel immediately next to San'Anastasia. Easily overlooked, this church s richly decorated with early Renaissance frescoes depicting the walled garden of the Virgin Mary.
* was built to replace an 8th-century church which was destroyed in the earthquake of 1117. Consecrated in 1187, the church features an ornate marble Romanesque façade by the Veronese architect Nicolò; its pillars are supported by two griffins. Stone reliefs around the door include Biblical scenes. The smaller side door is also worth a look - medieval carvings include Jonah being swallowed by a whale. Inside, the nave has many Gothic alterations, and oil paintings around the side chapels include an Assumption by Tiziano. The Romanesque baptistery adjoining the chapel of Sant'Elena is preserved, with its exquisite marble font and collection of medieval paintings.
