Understand

Orientation
Cork is the anglicised version of the Irish word Corcaigh, which means marsh. The city centre was originally built on marshland and boats were able to navigate into the channels which separated the many islands. Many of the wider streets, such as St Patrick's Street, the South Mall and the Grand Parade, are actually built on former river channels. St Patrick's Street is Cork's commercial hub, and is known colloquially as either "Patrick Street" or "Pana".

The centre of the city forms an arrow-shaped island between the North and South channels of the River Lee. There are upwards of thirty bridges over the two channels. This, combined with the one-way traffic system, can make the centre a little bit confusing for first-time visitors. The River Lee flows from West to East, and outside of the centre, hills rise steeply to the Northside, while the Southside is that bit flatter but still hilly in parts. St. Anne's Church watches over Shandon, just to the North of the river. The University is about 2km to the west of the centre.

The Train Station is about 1km to the east of the centre. Shops are generally concentrated around St. Patrick's Street, Oliver Plunkett Street, Paul Street and North Main Street. Bars and Restaurants can be found everywhere, but especially around MacCurtain Street, Washington Street and Oliver Plunkett Street. Financial businesses are centred on the area around the South Mall and the Administrative heart of the city is on Anglesea Street.

History
The patron Saint of Cork, Saint Finbar (c.550-c.620) founded a monastery on the south bank of the River Lee approximately 1,400 years ago. A settlement grew up around this monastery and was added to (and ransacked by) Viking invaders during the ninth and tenth centuries. The town grew and the English Norman King Henry II, who had been requested by Pope Adrian IV (the only English Pope) to collect papal dues not paid, gave Cork city status in 1185. 

Cork slowly grew during the late middle ages, developing into a crowded, walled city, centered around North and South Main Streets. The city enjoyed a golden age of sorts during the seventeenth century providing butter to ships which plied the North Atlantic. During this period the city expanded and many Italianate residences were built on the hills to the North in Sunday's Well and Montenotte.
 
After a sluggish start following independence, the city grew substantially during the latter half of the twentieth century. Currently, as a result of the Celtic Tiger phenomenon, development is having a profound effect on all aspects of the city, including its appearance, mostly for the better. From a small merchant town, Cork has grown into a cosmopolitan and vibrant city that, within the Republic of Ireland, is second only to Dublin in size and importance. 

Statio Bene Fide Carinis – "A safe Harbour for ships" is the motto of the city that is found on the coat of arms.

In recent years Cork has developed a slightly separatist mentality when compared to other parts of Ireland. This is most evident in colloquial speech (Cork Slang) and references to Ireland's capital, Dublin. This is, however, mostly tongue-in-cheek humour.

The train service in Ireland is operated by Irish Rail (Irish: Iarnród Éireann) which provides rail services from Cork to Dublin (16 trains per day), Cobh (22), Midleton (20), Tralee (3 direct, 6 with one change) and Mallow. All other towns and cities are accessible through connecting trains.

Cork's main station is Kent Station, located on the Lower Glanmire Road, a 10-minute walk east of St Patrick's Street.

Trains in Ireland can be expensive by comparison with other modes of transport. For example, a single (one-way) adult ticket from Dublin to Cork can cost as low as €10 if booked online, but be aware that adult single tickets bought at the station cost €60 almost the same price as a return journey which costs €77 if purchased at the station. In 2012, an initiative was launched which guarantees one-way tickets for €19.99 if booked online at least three days in advance. By booking online on the Dublin train you will be automatically allocated a reserved seat; you can also select which seat you would like manually. The train journey from Dublin Heuston to Cork takes, 2hrs 50mins. 

The Irish Rail network is undergoing a significant upgrading in terms of both infrastructure and rolling stock.

Four routes operate from Kent Station, Cork:

1. Intercity route to , serving: Mallow, Charleville, Limerick Junction, Thurles, Templemore, Ballybrophy, Portlaoise, Portarlington, Kildare, Dublin Heuston. A train will, on average, only stop at 3-4 of these stations between Cork and Dublin.

Many private bus companies also operate bus tours around Ireland from Cork. Kavanaghs has a bus service to Limerick and Waterford and Discovering Ireland also offers tours around Ireland.

The N20 to Limerick is mostly single carriageway with one lane in each direction; there are short sections of dual-carriageway (2 lanes in each direction) around Cork and Limerick. Approximate journey time is 1 hour 45 minutes.

The main arteries into Cork are mostly wide and in good condition, but the city centre streets and parts of the suburbs can be very narrow and steep; drivers who are unfamiliar with this style of close-knit street layout may find these conditions extremely challenging.

Car rental
Car rental services in Cork mainly operate out of Cork Airport, however Europcar and Hertz both have locations in Cork City Centre. The close proximity of the airport to the city means that this is not as inconvenient as it might appear, particularly when the excellent bus and taxi services are included.
