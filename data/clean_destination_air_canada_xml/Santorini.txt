Santorini is a volcanic island in the group of the islands. It is located between and islands. It is famous for dramatic views, stunning sunsets from town, the strange white aubergine (eggplant), the town of , and naturally its very own active volcano. There are naturally fantastic beaches such as the beach of Perissa, maybe the best beach in Santorini, the black pebble beach of , white beach and red beach.

Cities

There are several villages and towns on Santorini Island, four of which are perched along the top of the crescent-shaped cliff of the caldera.
* -Visit the Venetian Castle and on the top with amazing views the tower La Ponta- Greek Bagpipe exhibition workshop-Daily music!
* - the main stunning cliff-perched town, featuring all that Oia has, but much more overcrowded.
* - small resort town perched on the cliff a short bus ride away from Fira. Has absolutely stunning views of the sunset (all the way down to the horizon) and of Oia.
* - black pebble beach. Has stunning views of Sunrise.

* or - for unforgettable sunsets, probably the most charming cliff-perched place on the island.
* - Nice, well-organized beaches and good Greek fish taverns.
* - the highest point on the island; picturesque monastery and streets, can compete with .

Other destinations
* - just 10 minutes walking distance from Fira, offering unique views of the volcano and sunset from its cliff-perched site.
* Karterados - 2km south of Fira. Here you can find the traditional Santorini architecture
* -Traditional village with a lot of old white Cycladic churches.
* Mesaria - The center of the island. There is a small market on the road every morning with fresh fish. Do not miss the Argiros Estate to see a 19th-century house fully rebuilt.
* - a small village and a beach.
* - a small rock village, the church of St. Ann is here. Architecturally it is the strangest village on the island, as all the buildings were cut from the ravine that it is in.

Understand

The ancient name of Santorini was Strongyli due to the shape of the island. Santorini was named by the Latin Empire in the 13th century, and is a reference to Saint Irene, from the name of the old cathedral in the village of Perissa – the name Santorini is a contraction of the name Santa Irini.

An alternative name for Santorini is Thira. Santorini is also a name for the family of islands surrounding Thira, once forming a single island prior to a major volcanic event known in human history in approximately 1628 BC.

Santorini is one of the great natural wonders of the world, and its main attraction is the landscape and seascape of the island itself. In all, there have been at least twelve large explosive volcanic eruptions, but the configuration of the present, roughly semicircular island is the result of an enormous volcanic explosion which occurred probably around 1630 BC, literally blowing the top off the island and changing what had been a typical half-submerged mountain of an Aegean island into a flooded crescent caldera, in the middle of which a few small smoking islands still bear witness to volcanic activity. Some have speculated that this event was the inspiration for the myth of Atlantis. The towns of , (also known as ), and Thirasis cling to the steep cliffs facing into the caldera bay. 

Scientists believe that about two million years ago, volcanoes located at the bottom of the Aegean Sea west of Santorini began to generate volcanic emissions, which resulted in the formation of numerous small islands, and eventually formed two colossal shield volcanoes, which are conical mountains. These conical mountains have teamed up with non-volcanic islands to make way for one large island, Santorini. The volcanic arc of Santorini is approximately 500 km (300 mi) long and it extends all the way from the Greek mainland to the Turkish Bodrum peninsula.

But as explorations show, Santorini did not begin as a volcano. Its basement rocks consist of Mesozoic and Early Cenozoic-aged marble and phyllite. Only later volcanic explosions corrected today's forms of the island, so, therefore, is considered a volcanic island. The most ancient rock openings are at the ancient city of Thira, located in the southeast portion of the island. All Thera is built upon a small, non-volcanic basement. The younger volcanic rocks can be found on the islands in the middle of the caldera. The current caldera was formed about 3600 years before, during the most famous Minoan eruption.

The small island cradles a rich variety of landscapes and villages. Visit traditional architecture in the small village of Mesa Gonia (now shown as Episkopi Gonias in Google maps) containing a mixture of ruins from the 1956 earthquake and restored villas as well as a winery at the foot of the settlement. Pyrgos is another notable village set inland with its grand old houses, remains of a Venetian castle, and several Byzantine churches.

Santorini has no rivers, and water is scarce. Until the early 1990s locals filled water cisterns from the rain, from small springs, and with imported assistance from other areas of Greece. In recent years a desalination plant has provided running, yet non-potable, water to most houses. The island has only one natural source of fresh water, a small spring situated in a cave behind a small chapel located halfway up the steep footpath between Kamari and the entrance to Ancient Thira. This spring only provides a small quantity of water; however, it is of good quality as it comes from the only remaining limestone outcrop of the pre-volcanic island. Prior to the early 1990s, it was necessary for water to be delivered to the island via tanker from Crete. Now most hotels and homes have access to water provided by a local desalination plant. While this water is potable, it is still rather salty, so most visitors drink bottled water while in Santorini.

Get in
Getting in from Athens by air is faster and not prone to seasickness, compared to ferries. However, in-season air tickets sell out well before most of the ferries. 

By plane
Santorini (Thira) National Airport is an airport in Santorini/Thira, Greece (IATA: JTR, ICAO: LGSR), located north of the village of Kamari.
With regular flights from by numerous airlines. Flight duration from Athens to Santorini is about 30 minutes. During summer, Sky Express connects Santorini with other popular islands such as (), and . During the months of July and August, Astra Airlines flies from Thessaloniki 

From May till October charter airlines fly directly to Santorini from many European airports.
* Condor flies from Dusseldorf (DUS), Stuttgart (STR), Frankfurt (FRA), Munich (MUC);
* EasyJet flies from London Gatwick (LGW), Manchester (MAN) and Milan Malpensa (MXP);
* Eurowings flies from Cologne/Bonn (CGN), Munich (MUC) and Stuttgart (STR);
* Norwegian flies from Copenhagen (CPH), Oslo (OSL) and Stockholm (ARN);
* SAS flies from Oslo;
* TAROM flies from Otopeni Bucharest (OTP);
* Tuifly from Brussels (BRU);

From the airport, there are buses to , where you can change to buses to other towns. The bus stop is signposted just outside the terminal. 

Taxis are also usually waiting at the airport, but competition for them can be keen. You should agree on the fare with the driver before departing. Many Santorini hotels offer airport transfers, usually for a fee that's more than a taxi would charge you, but some may find it worth it for the convenience.
There is also the alternative of using the Aegean Taxi App. Instead of waiting in line for a taxi, you can simply download the app from Play Store or App Store and request a taxi to pick you up and drop you off at any destination on the island.

Free Wi-Fi is available throughout the airport with pretty good connection speeds. The coronavirus testing center is set up just opposite the check-in counters, offering both PCR and rapid tests.

By boat
Take the ferry from past and to the new port of Athinios on Santorini. More details in the article. There is also a daily connection between () and Santorini during high season.
If you prefer traveling by sea, your best bet is high-speed catamarans. The trip from to Santorini takes 4.5 hours with a high-speed ferry.

Ferries dock at the new port of Athinios, where buses and taxis meet each arrival to transport passengers to Oia, Fira, and elsewhere. All vehicles climb a very steep, winding road (with seven 180-degree turns) to get anywhere from Athinios.

If you arrive by , the experience will surely leave you with lasting memories. Cruise ships that call on Santorini do not dock but hold a position in the caldera near the Old Port of Fira and require tendering, which is usually provided by the Union Boatman of Santorini. Locals with fishing boats occasionally transfer cruisers to the Old Port at Fira (Skala Pier, which seems not to have changed over the last 50 years). 

From the Old Port (Skala Pier), there are three ways to reach the top of the cliff and Fira, which is 260 meters above sea level:
* cable car (daily, 6.30am-10pm, every 20 mins, €5/£4.15; takes about a few minutes to reach the top),
* mule ride (€5/£4.15; there's a weight limit and it'll take longer than the cable car), or a
* tough hike up 580 steps (following the same path as the mules; you must be fit and should inquire if you want to hike up; no charge).
With one or more large cruise ships off-shore, long lines may queue at the bottom of the cable car. Casual Fira walkers/shoppers may meet many others at the top returning after a few hours, and long queues may form at the top of the cable car before passengers are expected back aboard their ship(s). There are six small cable cars ganged together (each holding a six-person max), taking about a couple of minutes to descend. Do the maths, and plan accordingly.

Alternatively, you could take a speedboat, run by the Union Boatmen of Santorini, which also operates the tenders for the cruise ships, from the Old Port pier to Oia. Tickets are sold at the Old Port pier. That covers a 12-minute speedboat ride to Ammoudiou Bay at the bottom of the cliff next to Oia, and a private bus ride up a switchback road to an NST bus parking lot in Oia. After you explore Oia for 1, 2, 3, or 4 hours, you can then board a private NST bus (included in the price) to Fira. One still has to contend with the long queue for the cable car or walk down with the messy donkeys.

From the new port (Athinios Ferry Port), public buses run by KTEL (Greek: ΚΤΕΛ) are timed with ship arrivals. The buses look very similar to large tour buses but have ΚΤΕΛ written on the top at the back and will be parked a bit away from the tour buses in the parking lot across from Kronos Rent a Car. The public bus runs to Fira, where you can connect to buses leaving for other parts of the island, and costs about 1.60 euros. The ticketing agent can make changes once you arrive in Fira to pay.

For cruise-ship excursions, the cruise ship may tender passengers to the new port at Athinios, where chartered buses wait to start the excursions. Typically, excursions end at Fira.

Transport by sea is always dependent on weather. For safety, especially in winter or rainy monsoons, cruise ships may delay or cancel shuttles to/from shore, and ferries their departure times to or from the island.

Get around
The tourist season starts April 1, or around Greek Easter. The period from December through March is very much the off-season and is marked by colder temperatures, rain, and winds. Although the temperature is rarely cold, the poor weather makes for a less-than-optimal experience on this beautiful island. Most businesses, including hotels and guest houses, may be closed. The air is usually hot and dry during the busy summer months with very little rain between May and September. Ideal times to visit, for milder weather, lower prices, and crowds, are April-June and September-October.

The island has a public bus service. There are no daily or weekly bus passes available. The bus stops do not resemble the ones you usually find in other cities in Europe. They are white-closed small places with a low roofs. There might be a bus sign near the bus stop( if you look for it closely). Buses run every 30 minutes to every other hour. Timetables are available on the website The buses occasionally miss trips, and some drivers are less than friendly. Buses are air-conditioned but may be overcrowded during the high season. If you prefer getting a private or shuttle transfer from the airport or port to your destination or even a private tour service throughout the island, there are companies such as Santorini Transport offering such services. In addition, there are "hop on hop off" private bus services, Boats also run between major coastal towns on the island. 

An international driving permit is recommended. Without one, many car rental places will rent cars, but travel guides have mentioned tourists having insurance problems in case of accidents. Scooters and 4-wheelers (quads or all-terrain vehicles) are available to rent starting at about €15 or €30 per day, respectively. A driver's license is required to rent these 4-wheelers. Be aware that most of the people in Santorini are tourists. As a result, road conditions are extremely unsafe, with many people driving by the laws and conventions of nearly every country in the world. 

A popular method of getting around is to rent ATVs, though the "all-terrain" part is a misnomer, as most ATV riders are tourists riding on the paved road. ATVs share the road with other drivers and are usually all over the island. The island is small enough to travel around on an ATV and is a cost-effective way to self-explore the further reaches of Santorini. ATV rental shops are all around the island, so it's best to ask your hotel owner/concierge for the closest/most trusted vendor. You will need your local driver's license to ride one of these, and a helmet is recommended.

Some hotels advise booking a taxi in advance, as there are not enough available taxis on the island during the high season. As is the rule in the Cyclades, taxi fares are typically shared between multiple passengers, so don't be surprised if your cabbie picks up more passengers during your trip. The Aegean Taxi service makes transfers in Santorini easier since it allows you to book your ride through the Aegean Taxi App at any time and to any destination on the island. You can book a transfer in advance or on request for a taxi on the spot. 

It takes about 50 minutes to drive the island from end to end (from to ).

 By bicycle 
The island is small enough that it can be thoroughly explored by bicycle, or with a few bus trips, by foot. Bicycle rentals are fairly hard to find -- most places advertising bike rentals refer to motorbikes, rather than bicycles. The maps are designed for hikers, however, so the recommended routes are impassable by bicycle. Santorini is not very bicycle-friendly - there are no dedicated bicycle routes, so you must share roads with vehicular traffic. In addition, the island is very hilly. The traffic was more friendly to bicycles than to pedestrians or other vehicular traffic, however. 

 By foot 
Recommended routes by foot include the amazing walk from Fira to Oia (note that this walk is less nice in reverse, it can take less than three hours but can be difficult, for up and downhill climbs, the rocky surface at times, and the proximity to unprotected cliffs that drop sharply into the caldera) along the caldera, as well as the paths over Perissa Rock connecting Perissa, Kamari, and Pyrgos. The walk between Perissa and Kamari is fairly short (via Ancient Thira), while the walk to Pyrgos is somewhat longer, passing through the highest point on the island. The views are breathtaking and you could find different kinds and colors of rocks and plants as you walk. The walking route is different from where the city buses go.

Be sure to explore the areas outside of the towns. There is the beautiful countryside where tradition still survives. Cave houses (both abandoned and occupied), gardens, vineyards, small family businesses, and tiny churches are there to be discovered.

Architecture

The Cycladic Islands are world-famous for their picturesque towns of cubic white-washed homes and blue-domed churches. Santoríni is especially famous for the towns of Firá and Oía, whose white and pastel-colored homes and churches-- seemingly stacked on top of each other-- are perched on the cliffs of the caldera. Many of these traditional homes are built on cliff-side caves, thus having a much larger interior than their exterior would suggest. The architecture of Santoríni's picturesque towns is typically Cycladic, but with strong neoclassical and baroque influences visible in many of the island's churches and public buildings.

Fira is the fiery capital, a marriage of Venetian and Cycladic architecture, whose white cobblestone streets bustle with shops, tavernas, hotels, and cafes while clinging to the rim of the caldera nine hundred feet above its port. If arriving by sea you can take a cable car up from the port or alternatively take a trip on one of the hundred mules up the 588 zigzagging steps. You could also attempt to walk up the steps but be warned, they are winding, narrow in parts with only low walls, they are covered in donkey excrement and the donkeys themselves will make no attempt to avoid you. 

Art
While Santorini cannot claim a prominent art collection, why not see some local and international artists' work by visiting the Art Space Gallery and Winery in the small village of Exo Gonia, on the way between Fira and Kamari. ArtSpace is a winery built in 1830, an old canava. Also a museum with old installations for raki and tomato juice. Owned by the same family (Argyros) for three generations.

Historic sights
*Akrotiri, in the south, a roughly 3,500-year-old Minoan town preserved in volcanic ash like Pompeii, is one of Santorini's "must-sees". The excavation site is covered by a roofing system, which makes it something that you can comfortably visit no matter what time of year. The ruins are extremely well preserved. Streets, buildings, stairs, and even second floors of buildings are still visible. Visitors can stand in the ruins and look at Minoan pottery and frescoes, and with a little imagination, feel what it would have been like to live in ancient Greece. Due to an accident in September 2005, the excavation site was temporarily closed to the public, but as of April 2012, the site is once again open.

*Ancient Thera, the Classical city of the island is on Mesa Vouno, 396 m. above sea level. It was founded in the 9th century B.C. by Dorian colonists whose leader was Theras and continued to be inhabited until the early Byzantine period. The preserved ruins belong to the Hellenistic and Roman phases of the city. The residential area and the larger part of the cemeteries were excavated by German archaeologists between 1895 and 1902. The cemeteries on the NE and NW slopes of Sellada were excavated by N. Zapheiropoulos in the years 1961-1982. 

*Museum of Prehistoric Thira contains some of the artifacts, which were found in the ruins of Akrotiri. So first visit Akrotiri, where the items came from, and then Thira to understand what the items are. The museum has more pots, pottery, and other household items than you can shake an antique stick at, but the highlight is the frescoes of the blue monkeys -- a mystery since historians say there is no evidence that there were ever monkeys on Santorini. 

*Archaeological Museum in contains artifacts from various eras. Most of the exhibits are dated from the Classical and Roman periods from the ancient town of Thera and its cemeteries.

Other destinations
*Filming destination Due to the spectacular and unique natural beauty of Santorini, many Greek singers have chosen the island as the setting of their videos. In Santorini, there were filmed many different films or episodes such as Summer Lovers (1982), Lara Croft Tomb Raider (2003), The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants (2005), music video Santorini Greece (2017), the video game Assassin's Creed Odyssey (2018), Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire (2016), board game Santorini (2004), part of video game Sonic Unleashed (2008) and more. 
*Wedding destination. Santorini ranks among top destinations for wedding celebrations for at least 4 years - primarily for sunset and peace, like those in . Couples often arrive with few friends and stay in Ia (places like Fanari Villas). Groups often arrive at the beginning of the week - judging by demand for cabrios and the number of corteges seen on Mondays compared to weekends.

Scenery and nature
The landscape here - the blue sky, the little white houses perched on gigantic rocks on hills that plummet to the sea, the lemon and orange groves, the pink and white churches that look like pastry cakes, the faces and warmth, and expressiveness of the Greek people - little wonder this may be the most photographed scenery in the world.
*Ancient Thira is more ambitious for an amazing view of the ocean, beaches, and island from up high. 
*A lighthouse near , west of the southern part of the island. Rocky cliff, is interesting for taking photos. Although you cannot enter the lighthouse, which is run by the Greek Navy, it's a great and tranquil place for taking photos.
*Oia. At the northern end of the caldera is the quintessentially Santorinian town of Oia, also spelled Ia with its whitewashed walls sunk into the volcanic rock and its blue domes rising above the sterling beauty of the stunning, russet Ammoudi Bay. At dusk, the town attracts crowds of people venturing to see the sunset. Santorini's sunsets, as viewed from Oia, are reputed to be among the world's most beautiful.
*Panoramic views. Undoubtedly the best panoramic views of the island would be in the highest spots such as from the Caldera rim or a Panoramic view of Pyrgos Kallistis the highest-situated town of Santorini. It is worth adding great sunsets on the western part of the island.
*Thirassia: small island near Santorini; a place with more authentic villages, buildings, and even churches. Take a look at gymnasia: in the yard, pupils painted children on the walls.

Do
Beaches
Beach sand color depends on which geological layer is exposed; there are beaches with sand or pebbles made of solidified lava of various colors: such as the Red Beach, the Black Beach, and the White Beach. Public beaches do not seem to have showers or places for changing.

* at the southern tip of the Santorini this beach has everything from water sports to beach bars. There are a few small taverns here and it is the perfect spot to have a quiet swim and avoid the massive crowds. You can reach this beach from Emporio and Perissa by rented or private car. Walking is also an option.
* this is not really a beach with sand, but is a wonderfully secluded swimming area reachable from Oia. There is a road around the far side of Oia that leads down to a small parking lot. From there, you can reach the swimming area on foot past a few small restaurants. There is also a platform on a large rock that people can swim to and dive off.
* this is the main beach at the north side of the Island. Baxedes is a peaceful place with black sand, it is much more like how Santorini was like before tourists discovered the island. This is not the best beach when the north wind is blowing. It is easiest to get there by rented or private car or motorbike.
* see and .
* Secluded beach mostly for nudists, 4km east from 
* A beautiful rocky beach near the nature side of the island by the town Akrotiri. About 800 meters away from the Akrotiri main road there are restaurants on the beach itself. There are several ways to reach the beach which include driving, biking, or taking a small boat from Akrotiri.
* quiet but well organized beach with all the comforts of the other beaches such as clubs, restaurants, and umbrellas.
* lighter sand than Perissa beach, and is very enjoyable when the North Wind is blowing. It has beach bars and restaurants that makes it feel like a "beach day club".
* this is an amazing beach on the east side of Santorini where the rocks have a very unique red color to them. This is an excellent beach for those who do not mind walking a bit to get there. No facilities, restaurants, or shopping are located here.
* it's worth taking the Red Beach/Akrotiri bus from Fira and then climbing over the very rocky trails to get here (though there are water taxis and various schooners that make their way here as well). Red Beach earns its name from the iron-rich sedimentary rocks in the cliff face towering above you, as well as the red sand. It's quite crowded; you can rent an umbrella and a pair of chaise lounges for € 8, though there is also some good free space nearby that gets packed by midday. The first few meters of the water near the shore are quite gravelly, so be prepared to step on some stones. Women are frequently topless. Many distant yachts can be seen from the beach - it looks really romantic at sunset time. Great snorkeling - an abundance of sea life is present, as with Perissa. The tavernas built into the caves on Red Beach seem to have no electricity or running water, so if you eat or use the washrooms there, bring along hand sanitizer!
* this is a nude beach. On the left side of the beach, you will see that people are clothed, but as you go toward the right, you will find everyone in nude.
* A little beach with a tavern, ideal for families, located 4km east from 
* available only from the sea; get there by boat from Red Beach or Akrotiri. There is no pier so the only way to get there is by getting of the boat and walking through water that starts at about you waist. It is very small with only a few beds.

Other activities
* Volcano island (Nea Kameni) - hot springs (Palia Kameni) - Thirassia. From Ia: departure from Ammoudi bay at 10:50AM (starting and end point); a bit later from Armeni bay. 1hr 30min at volcano island; 45min for hot springs; 2hrs for Thirassia (incl. time for lunch). Meals are not included, normally the guide advises you to visit Captain Jack's tavern, which is self-service if you arrive with a big group or operate with waiters if you don't. This restaurant serves amazing fresh seafood at the cheapest prices. Testament to how good it is, is the fact you will notice that none of the adjacent restaurants are ever busy. Only this one.
* 
* 
* Enjoy the sailing taking destination to the different Cycladic islands.
* Central "smoking" islands are readily available and one can see and feel steam vents and recent (the 1950s) lava flows.
* Another popular reason for coming to Santorini are the legendary sunsets, some of the most spectacular in the world. is one of the few places on the island which is both close to the sea and offers a good view to a sunset over the sea: in other towns, the sun disappears behind the volcano.
* Santorini is renowned for over fifty different varieties of grapes, including the famed white Assyrtiko that won countless awards and the sweet Vinsanto, which has recently been awarded Protected Designation of Origin status. 
* along the caldera from Fira to Oia.

Scuba and Snorkeling
Santorini has 5 dive shops. Prices are typical including equipment rental, transport, and usually, a light lunch. The offerings are otherwise quite similar. Prices are sometimes lower when booked directly through a dive shop, rather than through a travel agency. Try the Mediterranean Dive Club ( +30 22860 83080, santorinidiving@gmail.com). Their office is on Perissa Beach (near the Tranquilo Bar). There are also two dive shops in Kamari: Navy's Waterworld Dive Center (+30 22860 28 190), and Aegean Divers (+30 22860 33210, info@aegeandivers.com, 

Diving, visibility is amazing, but there are not as many fish as in more popular scuba and snorkeling locations. Dive sites include a wreck near the volcano, caverns, reefs, as well as wall diving. The wall dive is the most interesting. Octopus is not uncommon. To minimize environmental damage, all five dive shops go to the same locations (although not at the same time), with moorings shared by all the dive shops. If you want to go to a specific dive site, call ahead, and find out which dive shops are heading to which locations on which day (or ask to go to a specific location). 

Recommended sites for snorkeling include Mesa Pigadia beach, somewhat out (some people recommended a diving buoy for boat safety), the beach South of Oia, as well as Perissa Rock (esp. somewhat further around the rock). There are supposed to be some nice spots between Perivolos and Vlichada Beach as well. The beach on Thirasia also has some reasonable snorkeling. Caldera Beach, near Akrotiri, has a few amazing snorkeling spots. When walking down to Caldera Beach (follow the signs to Santorini Dive Center), you will see some rock formations further out into the water. If you can find those once in the water, and swim to them, you will find wonderful snorkeling. 

Wineries
Certainly to mention the viticulture and winemaking of Santorini. One of the most ancient vineyards of the world has been developed on this island, a veritable monument created by nature and humans. Vineyards are seen anywhere on Santorini, especially in the central and northern parts of the island. The volcanic soil and the special climate contribute to the unique character of the island's wines.
*Estate Argyros: Mesa Gonia or Episkopi Gonias near Kamari
*Hatzidakis winery: Pyrgos
*Santo Wines: open 9AM-sunset (the only winery that charges a fee for a tour)
*Venetsanos Winery: Megalochori, open 10:00 - 22:00
*Volcan Wines Museum & Winery: ph.+30 2286 31322, open 12PM-8PM.

Events
* It is held annually at the open-air cinema, Cinema Kamari, in Santorini.

Buy
* Atlantis Books, The largest selection of English language books on the island. Also stocks Greek, German, French, Italian, Spanish, and Dutch.
* Wines. Santoríni is one of Greece's most prominent wine regions, whose wines enjoy special designation of origin status from the European Union. The method of growing grapes (with vines close to the earth and individual vines spaced far apart from each other) is unique to the island, with its dry soil and windy climate. Wineries open to the public are located throughout the island.

Eat
A combination of climatic factors and the tastes of those who have occupied and lived on the island have formed an eclectic cuisine. Great Santorini cuisine is for your choice. Don't miss the traditional fried tomato balls a variety of tomato keftedes, with whole slices of tomatoes fried in batter; and be sure to ask for local tomatoes in your salad. Santorini has a deep red color, high carbohydrate content sweet, and strongly acidic taste tomatoes. They may be the best tasting you have ever had. Santorini is particularly well known for its cherry tomatoes which are very sweet. The cherry tomatoes are usually sun-dried or sometimes made into sweet tomato marmalade. Santorini specials also include white aubergine (eggplant); fava caper; dolmades, and stuffed vine leaves. Another must-try is fresh fish grilled in tavernas, esp. those close to the sea.

For those who enjoy the Mediterranean diet - fresh fish, vegetables, and meat dishes can be found at several moderately priced restaurants (average 40 Euros for two) in Imerovigli, Oia, and Fira. To save money, stay away from places that are overtly commercial and go to the family-run fish taverns located nearby the smaller beaches and communities. 

Drink
Wine. Assyrtiko grape dominates Assyrtiko-Santorini (PDO Santorini) wines are rare and distinctive. These wines are born in some of the world’s oldest vineyards, dating back 3.500 years, on the volcanic island of Santorini. Visit local wineries and enjoy the local grape varieties, Assyrtiko, Aidani, Athiri, Vinsanto, and Mavrotragano.

Stay safe
Be aware of rental scams, especially with agencies working only with motorbikes and ATVs. Using these types of vehicles is very common in Santorini and there are a lot of rental agencies. Some of them are ready to cheat. They will offer faulty motorbikes or ATVs for a lower price, but in case of an accident, they will demand that the customer pays for the whole cost of the damage. They are offering only basic insurance but will present it like full insurance. Also, there is a big possibility of serious injuries.

It is possible to recognize these rental agencies by observing them aggressively attracting tourists and offering lower prices than others. Employees in front of these types of agencies will be loud and ready to promise everything until the contract is signed. It is necessary to check the vehicle before making any decision. Their vehicles are in most cases dusty, dirty, and look old. 

Santoríni is relatively crime-free: you are quite unlikely to be pickpocketed. On the other hand, you may feel you have been ripped off by some restaurant or bar bills. In particular:
* Bring sunscreen. A bottle of SPF30 sunscreen will run about 20 Euro, with higher SPF sunscreen costing appropriately more. 
* While this is obvious, remember not to shop at stores or order at restaurants without posted prices. 

Physically the cliffs and low walls guarding large drops pose a danger to children while the elderly may encounter problems with the many steps.
Cave exploring can be fun too but it is not recommended to deviate from the paths because of the unstable rocks made of tufa.

Like most areas of Greece, Santorini has a very high number of stray dogs, or dogs otherwise left to roam as they, please. While the majority of Santorini's large dogs are generally friendly they have been known to follow large tourist groups, with some going as far as to follow hiking groups traveling from Fira to Oia. Pack activity is common and basic precautions involving stray or feral dogs should be followed should a pack form around your group.

Contact
There are some local radio stations in Santorini, mainly in the Greek language. When in Santorini, turn your radio at: Volcano Radio at 106.4 MHz and Top Melody Fm Radio at 104.9 MHz.
