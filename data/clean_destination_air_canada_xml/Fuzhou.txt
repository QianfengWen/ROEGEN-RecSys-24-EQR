Understand

Fuzhou is an old port city, visited it. In the 19th century, it exported more tea than any other Chinese port. Today, it is the provincial capital and administrative center, and also a major center for light industry. Nike has a factory there, and a Taiwanese firm that makes shoes for Adidas, Reebok and others has four. All are large factories, with several thousand employees each. Fuzhou is right across the straits from , and there is fairly heavy Taiwan investment.

The city is on the Min River, a few km inland from the sea. There are many mountains and waterfalls in the hinterland, while sandy beaches are abundant in the coastal areas, especially in the town of and the island of . The actual port is in the suburb of , which has also been a center for shipbuilding for several hundred years. In 1884, the French destroyed a dockyard at Mawei, sinking a good part of the Chinese navy and killing hundreds. There is a museum to commemorate this. For a more general view of Fujian's seafaring history, visit the Maritime Museum in . The region also has its own culture and an architectural style distinct from other regions in China and Fujian, which can be found both in the city and in the towns and rural areas around it. The city has the oldest wood structure in South China (Hualin Temple) and has one of the largest historic downtown districts in China "Three Lanes and Seven Alleys" with over 200 residences from the Ming and Qing dynasties.

Talk
The Fuzhou region has its own language, called Fuzhou Hua (Fuzhou speech) or Mindong also called Eastern Min, where "min" is another name for Fujian. It is mutually unintelligible with spoken south of Fujian or any other Min Chinese varieties spoken in other parts of Fujian. Like everywhere in mainland China, Standard Mandarin is the official language and the lingua franca of the whole country, Standard Mandarin is used in education and public media, so most Fuzhou locals can speak Standard Mandarin.

Climate
Fuzhou has a humid subtropical climate influenced by the East Asian Monsoon, with plenty of rainfall measuring 1.393mm on average. Extremes have ranged from -1.9°C (28.6°F) to 41.7°C (107.1°F). Winters are short, mild and dry (compared to the other seasons) and the average January temperature is 11.2°C (52.2°F). The average low is 8.2°C (46.8°F) and the average high is 15.2°C (59.4°F). Cold air masses originating in rarely arrive here, because they are blocked by the mountains in the north and west. Small portions of them however, may manage to penetrate through the mountains, causing night temperatures to fall below 5°C (41°F) in some cases. Frosts and snow are very rare, but there is a slight possibility of sleet occuring. On the other hand, when warm, moist air masses arrive from the South China Sea, daytime temperatures may surpass 20°C (68°F). Summers are very hot and humid. The hottest month is July, with 24-hour average temperature of 29.2°C (84.6°F). The heat during daytime is sweltering, because of the very high temperatures (the average high is 34.1°C or 93.4°F) and very high humidity (77% on average). Heat waves may occur and 40°C (104°F) readings are not uncommon. Keep in mind that during late summer and early autumn Fuzhou is in the path of hurricanes.

Get in

By plane
Fuzhou has air links to most other major Chinese cities. The airport is an hour from town in the suburb of , &yen;25 by bus. You can get the bus at the Apollo Hotel. There are also complimentary shuttles to the Apollo Hotel from other places such as the Min Jiang Hotel. Shared taxis also go from there, at around &yen;25. A private taxi would be around &yen;200, likely more unless you well.

The airport also serves international flights to , , , , , , , and 

By bus
Direct overnight buses to/from , or exist, with sleeping bunks. &yen;220-350, it is usually worth the extra for comfort. Buses from are &yen;70-90.

By ferry
A two hour ferry from Matsu (Taiwan via an overnight ferry from Keelung) costs $1300NT (see seat61 for details). Customs and immigration is at the ferry arrival center. It does seem there are any ATMs here but a 1 yuan bus will take you to the city (40-50 mins). A taxi driver will quote 80 yuan for the ride. 

By train
The main Fuzhou train station is in the northeast of the city. You can reach it via #5 or #22 city busses, or it is cheap and quick by taxi from anywhere in central Fuzhou. There is also a new Fuzhou South station, located rather inconveniently. A taxi to it will be &yen;50 or so from downtown and take about half an hour. The K2 bus runs between the two stations; the cheapest way to the South station if you have time is to go to the main station and take that bus from the parking lot off to your left as you face the station entrance.

A new between Xiamen and Fuzhou is available, leaving from the main Fuzhou station almost hourly, for under &yen;100 one way.

There is also a fast train from the South station to via various towns in , , , and . Around 6 hours, &yen;282 for second class, 330 for first.

Get around
Taxis are, &yen;10+ for short trips and under &yen;30 for any trip in town. Taxi rates are &yen;10 for the first 3km, and then &yen;1.4 per km and one more after 11PM.Taxis are more available in the downtown area, and are often hard to get outside there. Street cameras prevent taxis from stopping in certain areas, so if you are having trouble flagging down a taxi, look for a blue taxi stand sign to stand under. If you speak Chinese you can order a taxi by calling 968968, a &yen;3 charge in addition to the fuel charges should be added to the total.

Note that taxi drivers in this town are pretty dishonest and will try taking long routes, charging you for "airport parking" and various other scams.

Buses are often crowded, but run often and more-or-less everywhere for &yen;1. Most are air conditioned. If the bus you require is packed just wait until the next one, or the one after, it should only take 5-10 minutes, being stuck on a dangerously overloaded bus with several dozen/hundred people sweating all over you is an experience best avoided, especially in the summer months. However, you should be aware that bus service stops at 10pm, so the last buses are often very crowded and sometimes you cannot get one. Taxis and enterprising drivers will offer group rides from crowded bus stops to other parts of town, usually for &yen;15.

Metro/Subway system is in the process of being built, with the aim of being finished in 2015.

See

Walk over the arching footbridge to to the Fuzhou Science Museum, a small but nice museum featuring dinosaurs. Or, walk around the lake itself, it is surrounded by sidewalks and a boardwalk. As of spring, 2012 they also have Pandas in an enclosure where you can see them.

* A central square with a huge statue of Mao. Visit at dawn or dusk to watch the ceremonial raising or lowering of the flag by highly trained and immaculate soldiers. Or visit at 6AM-8AM or late on weekends to watch at least half a dozen of martial arts, both armed and unarmed, being practiced. The founder of Uechi-ryu karate, Uechi Kanbun, spent 13 years in Fuzhou, from 1897 to 1910. There are a group on the East side of the park who say their style is what he studied.

* A Taoist temple houses nationally important archives written in monks' blood as well as superb veggie restaurant. It is a 1,900 meter climb, or a 20 minutes cable car journey to the top.

* Less heavily trafficked than Gu Mountain. After the grueling top section, you will be rewarded by some genuinely beautiful hospitality and refreshing tea in a cave! Magic. Plus some great views over the city.

* Overlooking the main square, a short walk to the hilltop which houses a pretty average temple. However, on the way up there is plenty of entertainment in the form of musicians and singers who congregate here to practice. The White Pagoda is also accessed by the same road behind Mao Tse Dong's statue and worth a look. There are several very good arts and crafts shops at the base of the hill. for all you are worth to obtain good prices. There is also an excellent Xinjiang restaurant near the top of the road up the hill.

* A &yen;5 bus ride from Fuzhou plus the last stage in a tuktuk or private cab (which will cost you around &yen;150 for a return trip) up the winding 17km road to the site. A forest park with big, waterfalls and stunning views over receding mountain ranges from a vertigo-inducing suspension bridge. All this and monkeys to feed.

*This historic district in the heart of the city is one of the largest historic downtown areas in China, boasting about 268 ancient residences dating from Ming and Qing dynasties (1368-1911). Most of these residences feature the typical Foochow architectural style, which can only be found in the Eastern and Northeastern part of Fujian. The area was extensively restored around 2007, and as of 2012 additional work in neighbouring areas is still going on. Since 2011, ten of the finest residences require admission fees of ￥15 or ￥20 per person. A combo admission ticket including all ten is available for ￥120 (valid for 2 days). Many of the residences in the area are private homes, so tourists need permission from the residents to enter them.
*Hualin Temple is a Buddhist temple in downtown Fuzhou, which currently functions as a small museum and no longer provides Buddhist services. Built in 964 AD and survived over 10 centuries, this is the oldest wood architecture extant in South China (south of Yangtze River). The temple has a typical Tang dynasty style with simplicity and elegance. Despite its great historic and architectural importance, the site is rarely visited, but it is truly a hidden treasure for serious lovers of ancient Chinese architecture.
