Stay safe

The City and County of Saginaw are committed to fostering a world-class county by providing efficient government services and collaborating with local and state police departments, all to provide a safe environment. Success of this vision can be seen in community safety and the dramatic decline in serious crime. A targeted crime strategy has resulted in a 3.1% decline in Crimes Against Persons from 2013 to 2017.

Saginaw’s successful strategy is based on community policing and citizen-police partnerships that work together in neighborhood problem solving. Working together, both the citizens and police develop shared ownership and accountability for their neighborhood and community, thereby developing pride that translates into active citizenship. 

Since December 2013, there are 26 Michigan State Police (MSP) troopers, including command staff and members of special task forces, assigned specifically to the City of Saginaw. Stepped-up enforcement efforts and cooperation by the MSP and the Michigan Department of Corrections alongside local partnerships with county sheriffs, jails, prosecutors and judges for the reduction has been credited with the success. The MSP also added a third helicopter that is based in Saginaw part of the “Secure Cities Partnership” initiative to reduce crime in Michigan.
