Wenzhou (温州; Wēnzhōu) is a city in Province.

Understand

Wenzhou is the third city of Zhejiang Province and one of the economic power houses of the region. Famed for its businessmen and women (and the Wenzhou model of business), Wenzhou is frequently used by Western media as a barometer of the Chinese export economy; among other things, Wenzhou manufactures around 90% of the world's spectacles and massive quantities of shoes. Wenzhou is not on many China tour itineraries and despite being a Chinese cultural hotpot, it is not the most foreigner friendly of cities (compared with and , for example). However, there are plenty of things to do and see should you find yourself with time on your hands in Wenzhou. The city has a resident foreigner community that is below average for the city's size (100-200) although foreign businessmen often pass through.

Although Mandarin is widely spoken, the local dialect is Wenzhounese (温州话; Wēnzhōuhuà) and is regarded by Chinese nationals as one of the most difficult dialects in the country, so much so that Wenzhounese speakers were used by the Chinese resistance in World War II to communicate under the nose of the Japanese. Wenzhounese people populate many of the China towns around the globe (where their language is still spoken) and own the leases to many properties in Beijing and even San Francisco.

Higher Education

Most universities and colleges are located in Chashan Higher Education Zone. Wenzhou Medical College and Wenzhou University has more than 1000 International students making Wenzhou a place for Higher learning for students worldwide. Currently there are students from more than 70 countries living on campus in both institutes. Wenzhou-Kean University, an American university in China, has been created out of a collaboration of Kean University in the U.S. and the Wenzhou city government to offer English-language higher education. The new campus is in the Ouhai District, not far from Chashan.

Get in

By plane
Wenzhou Airport is east of the city, receiving flights from around China, and because it also supports flights to and from Hong Kong, it is considered international. Wenzhou Airport recently built a new terminal which is much more user friendly and less oppressive for foreigners. You can fly directly from with China Eastern Airlines.

You can get from the airport to the city center by taxi or bus. Taxis are the most expensive and you should bargain hard; if they do not like the price you are offering they laugh at you and start shouting Bus!. If a taxi driver offers you a ride under ¥100 it can be regarded as a good deal. Taking the bus is now much easier due to a ticket desk in the new terminal opposite the exit gate. The bus costs ¥12 and drives through New City (新城; Xīnchéng), Xialüpu (下吕浦; Xiàlǚpǔ) and finally stops at a depot on Nanpu Road (南浦路; Nánpǔlù).

By train
Wenzhou Central Train Station serves most cities throughout China, although because of Wenzhou's mountains, train journeys are sometimes much longer than their bus counterparts. The train station is at the major junction of Wenzhou Avenue (温州大道; Wēnzhōudàdào) where it meets Chezhan Avenue (车站大道; Chēzhàndàdào).

Wenzhou South Train Station (温州南站; Wēn​zhōu​nán​zhàn​) has been opened in 2009 and now serves the high-speed trains that comes from Shanghai and bounded for Fuzhou and Xiamen. Some of the stations along the way are Hangzhou, Ningbo and Taizhou.

By bus
Wenzhou has a number of bus stations that serve a variety of locations around the country. Arrivals from Shanghai and Fuzhou will find themselves at New South Station (新南站; Xīnnánzhàn) which is near the train station on Wenzhou Avenue (温州大道; Wēnzhōudàdào), arrivals from Hangzhou and Ningbo will find themselves at New City Station (新城站; Xīnchéngzhàn) which is in New City, and arrivals from places as varied as Yiwu and Qingdao will find themselves at Shuangyu Bus Station (双屿汽车站; Shuāngyǔqìchēzhàn) which is on the west side of the city near the suburb of Huanglong.

Get around

By bus
Buses cost ¥1.5-2.5 within the city and can be very useful once you figure what number goes where. Useful buses include the 78 that goes between the old train station and the new south train station (¥2). The price is listed on the outside of the bus and on the bus stop sign. The bus stop sign also lists the stops on one side and shows a map on the other. Strangely, you will not find this in Beijing or Shanghai.

By taxi
Taxis are ¥10+2(gas charge) for the first 4km and ¥1 for each .5km thereafter (after 11:30PM prices rise to ¥12+2(gas charge) for the first 4km and ¥1 for each .5km thereafter). If you are outside the centre of the city, or in the centre trying to get elsewhere, you will not be able to catch a taxi between 4:30PM and 6PM. This is because of the driver shift change.

Many taxis drivers like to haggle for prices and not use the meter especially for relatively far places. So be cautious when you board one.

By ferry
Although one ferry serves the tourist island of Jiangxin, there are other ferries that serve destinations up and down the Ouhai River ( 瓯海; ōuhǎi) such as the suburb of Oubei (瓯北; ōuběi)

See

* An island in the middle of the Oujiang river that runs through Wenzhou. The island has an old pagoda and a new pagoda, large areas of garden and lakes, a water park and a theme park. The theme park is known for its ferris wheel which gives great views of both sides of the river and also a death-defying roller coaster. Make sure you buckle up tight.

* Really new, but very nice temple in the West edge of Wenzhou.

* A group of around 136 islands with a multitude of bridges connecting them, as well as a bunch only reached by big concrete canoes. In total it is something like 13 square km. They are currently building a bunch of gazebos, gardens and new bridges and plan to officially open the garden as an attraction sometime this year.

* A huge area of trees and greenery. Good place to walk around a get a view of Wenzhou. The mountain overlooks the suburb of Huanglong.

* Another pedestrian street, less to see than 5 horses, but it is longer and has trees on it.

* Group of islands off the coast. There is a bunch of "scenic spots", you have to pay for some. Once there, it is probably easiest to take a taxi to the different scenic spots, do not believe the ones that approach you when you get off the bus.

* The town on the Northern side of Ou River. Not much to see in Oubei, close to the dock there is some nice temples at the bottom and top of a hill. There is a pagoda on top of the hill as well.

* 

* 

*A small but picturesque park with a lake and a brand new very high pagoda. Climb to the top for excellent views of the city, which at times can remind one of SimCity. Times refers to the pagoda.
*Located in Wenzhou city Ouhai District streets Xia Ao village, Yishanbangshui and built, Wenzhou park is a Sino-US joint venture Wenzhou Park Company Limited to invest in the construction of high grade tourism theme park.
*The bridge is located in Taishun county and in Sixi Town, is the most famous Taishun lounge. The East River Bridge, North Jian bridge two Hongqiao type wooden arch bridge, known as the" world's most beautiful bridges".

*Catch the ferry to Oubei, then a minibus to Yantoucun 岩头村, an hour North of Oubei, 15 kuai. There is some nice scenery from the bus, and when you arrive there are two nearby attractions. One is Lishui Street 丽水街, old houses built around a canal, and the other is Furong Village 芙蓉村, a 20 minute walk out of Yantoucun. 15 kuai admission to Lishui Street and 20 kuai for Furong village. Furong Village is hundreds of years old and is still lived in, and although there are a lot of Chinese tourists walking around, but no tour groups, both it and Lishui Street are much less touristy and crowded than the water towns near Shanghai or other ancient towns around China. Basic and unofficial accommodation can be found in both places for 100 kuai per person, shared bathrooms. Try the local street food Maibing 麦饼".

Do
* If you are a foreigner, you can wander around the Double Deer Factory. There is some amazing machinery, such as the one that sticks on the labels. You will likely be thrown out after a little while, but it is well worth it. Try not to get your pictures deleted. If you are pretending to write an article about the brewery, then you should have business cards made beforehand.

* There are many pool halls dotted around Wenzhou, ranging from free to ¥30/hour. If you wander past the security guards and get to the 4th floor above Times Square there is a pool hall you can use pro bono.

* Schools licensed to employ foreigners to teach English include D.D. Dragon, Dr Mike's, Kid’s Castle, English First and Web International English. Always inquire about a Z-Visa and check that the school has a license from the local government. There are many unlicensed schools, some of which provide a good teaching experience but your passport might not bear up to scrutiny. See also and .

* Taxis are cheap enough that you can just get driven around for an hour or so and not be out too many dough.

* As a very Chinese city it is difficult to find English speakers outside of universities, colleges and certain bars. For this reason, Wenzhou is perfect for the home learner to practice their Putonghua out on the street. Watch out for Wenzhounhua though, it sounds incredibly different from any Chinese you have ever heard before.

* They have penguins, fornicating lions and the occasional panda. Bus 44 Good times.
*Go whitewater tubing on little rafts for two people to a place 2 hours away from Wenzhou.
*Ask a taxi driver to take you to the water world located in Wenzhou on one island.

Buy
There are no token "Wenzhou" things that you need to buy, but there are many things made in Wenzhou so, if you look and bargain well, you can buy them at very cheap prices. This section is helpful if you are looking for something that would be easy to find in a western city, but you are unsure of where to find it in a Chinese one.

Clothing
* You can get all kinds of cheap shoes and clothing near the train station, bring a Chinese person and you get better prices.

* Everything in there is too expensive to buy, but it has clean, shiny floors excellent for sliding on.

* There are many boutiques selling expensive stuff. Furthermore, there is a Foodcourt at the top floor as well as an Arcade.

Computing
*The computer market is three floors of technology, including desktops, laptops, notebooks, external hard drives, webcams, etc. For the best deals, make a Chinese friend before you go or take down on paper your own price (-20 %) will go !

Luggage
*If you require suitcases or other baggage, there are many shops on the west side of this street specialising in Luggage. 

Books and Stationery
*If you are looking for foreign books, it is unfortunate that Wenzhou does not have a store for foreign language books. However you will find some classics as well as plenty of Chinese literature, dictionaries and teaching resources. The Book City also includes a music department, a stationery department and an arts department.

Toiletries
*Watson's is where you can find toiletry essentials such as Shower gel (cheaper than smaller stores), sanitary towels, razors, mouthwash and even antiperspirant if you look hard enough. 

*As above, but closer to Xialvpu (下吕浦）.

*D&L (Beneath European City) The D&L Supermarket has a decent selection of foreign toiletries. Very pricey though.

Musical equipment
*If you are a musician in Wenzhou and struggling to find a music shop, have no fear as there are plenty around the city. The biggest (and easiest to find) is this one on Renmin Road and stocks guitars, keyboards, drums, and plenty more.

Currency
*Probably the most reliable place to buy currency is this large, official currency exchange. If you fancy taking a risk, you can seek a better rate with the money changers outside the bank.

Eat

Wenzhou foreign restaurants public map (Google Maps) 

Budget
* Many "Potato-men" stake out good spots around Wenzhou and sell you potatoes.

* The generic name for an extensive chain of restaurants offering bargain basement prices for solid meals from the Muslim regions of Western China including Pulled Noodles, Fried Rice, and Curries. There are at least 30 of these restaurants in the city and most have a menu on the wall which is helpful for finger-pointing foreigners. Look for the blue shop header with ‘正宗兰州拉面’ or ‘新疆牛肉拉面’. There is normally a boiling pot in the front of the restaurant and one of the staff pulling the noodles fresh to order...and if you see the guys in their little hats or women with light headresses, you know you're near one.

Mid range

One-of-a-kind restaurants
* This restaurant with a beautiful river view serves high quality Spanish food and grill. No MSG or artificial coloring is used. Prices are very reasonable and all wines are available at retail prices. A number of employees are fluent in English.

* Fine Indian cuisine, possibly a little too much oil for some palettes, but a popular choice for locals and foreigners alike.

* Friendly staff who speak enough English and a menu in passable English, Chinese and (dubious) Arabic. The curry dishes come highly recommended at the expense of the kebab dishes. If you are caught between yogurt and hummus, pick the yogurt every time as the hummus is heavily on the peanut side.

* A long established Italian Restaurant with an English menu and at least one member of staff that speaks English for in-house and take-away phone orders. Very solid menu selection and an ambiance that defies its Chinese location.

* This Italian style coffee shop is worth a miss. High prices and a bad menu contribute to an uncomfortable experience. The coffee is passable but expensive and do not order the ambiguously named 'Sandwich' for ¥20; it is three slices of salami with mayonnaise slipped into bread rolls normally found amongst aeroplane food. On the upside, there are two rolls. Menu is in Italian and Chinese.

Chinese Chains
* Chinese style fried chicken, with wraps that are surprisingly easy on the taste buds.Unfortunately, the one that was present in Wuma Street (五马街）has been moved to Ruian city,hence there currently aren't any left in Wenzhou city. A new one just opened in B1 of the Wenzhou South high speed train station.

* Another Chinese style fried chicken fast-food restaurant, many of them dot the city.

* The Wenzhou answer to the Western Pizza Chains, Super Bee Pizza has a wide menu although some choices are a little pricey. There are at least five of these restaurants throughout the city. Be warned though, they offer just decent pizza and not the kind of thing that satisfies a seasoned food lover.

* There are two Bread Talks in Wenzhou, one in the downtown area near Wuma Street (五马街) and the other is in the European City shopping district (欧洲城). Eat-in or Takeaway, this bakery has a wide variety of hot and cold drinks and has breads that come closest to matching the taste of Western bakeries, including ring doughnuts and odd-looking but good-tasting Pizza.

Sushi
* Not the name of a specific restaurant but a note that the number of Sushi restaurants in Wenzhou has exploded. There are two on Ladies' Street (女人街) near Wuma Street (五马街) with at least one more in the downtown area, and at least two in Xialv Pu (下吕浦) including the cheapest in Wenzhou (off Wendi Lu 温迪路) starting at just 6元 a dish. A more high class sushi restaurant can be found on Wangjiang Lu (望江路) down by the river near Xicheng Lu (西城路） which has excellent noodles and sushi at slightly higher prices; at least one staff member also speaks Japanese.

Western Chains
* There are four of the burger giant, one on Renmin Lu (人民路) near the KAITAI superstore, one in the European City shopping district (欧洲城), one north of the train staion about 1km and one at the Olympic Stadium next to Trust Mart.

* The most successful western fast food chain in China can be found throughout the city on Renmin Lu (人民路) Nanpu Lu （南浦路）, Wuma Street (五马街), Xicheng Lu (西城路), Chezhan Dadao (车站大道) and Xiushan Lu (秀山路). Some are busier and more likely to stare at foreigners. Nanpu is the quietest and will give the least hassle, while Renmin is the biggest and busiest(as it is near the Movie theatre) with large numbers of staring eyes watching any foreigners present. 

Expect differences in the menu - chicken leg or wings but not chicken breast is typical for Chinese chicken places :)

* There are three Pizza Huts, one on Renmin Lu (人民路), one on Wuma Street (五马街) and another in the European City shopping district (欧洲城). Pizza Hut recently withdrew it's Pepperoni Pizza from it's Chinese restaurants and increased the price of it's stuffed crust pizza, which is a shame. 

Pizza hut has stopped giving discounts to foreign students studying in Wenzhou. Discounts are only for Chinese Students nowadays! This is really a waste of time because not many Chinese Students go to Pizza Hut! Generally will see families with children. 

* Located in Times Square. Get sandwiches and coffee. Wireless internet. One of the few places that you can purchase decaf coffee beans. 2nd floor good place to use your laptop or to meet friends. Food is great! Some staff know English as well.

Splurge

Drink
Do not miss out on the locally brewed delight, Double Deer Beer, ¥2-2.5 on the streets. Also, do not forget to look under the cap for a free beer or ¥1 refund. Known as Shuan1 Lu4 in Chinese. It also has a more expensive, premium light counterpart.

Wenzhou's nightlife is somewhat spread out all over the city. 

*Currently Wenzhou's most popular expat bar. Occasionally has live rock, themed parties, along with regular quiz nights and North American-style wing nights

*
 Live music, great service, unique location, western food and more.
Odessa Bar is located in the basement of European City shopping center.

*A fun Chinese beer bar which has a surprisingly overwhelming choice of imported beers from 3% to 14% strong! Most of the beers are Belgium style, but there is some variety. They also have shishas and outdoor seating, as well as the menu in English. It's not currently an expat hangout, no one seems to know about this place, on the outside it's just like any other Chinese bar. 

*The original home of the Taiwanese Cowboy, expect rowdy Chinese, migrant worker bar staff, and a wild time, especially if Eric hands you a free bottle of Tequila.

*Very popular Chinese bar for DJs and live music. A mug of beer will cost you 25 yuan, so not too pricey, and there's plenty of people to dance with.

* Small bar with a very Chinese flavour, now has an open front. Staff and patrons known to be friendly to foreigners.

* Extensive conferencing facilities, but not highly regraded rooms.

Get out
*Linhai &mdash; in the Taizhou prefecture, north of Wenzhou, Linhai has the Southern Great Wall of China. There is also an East Lake (东湖), and long old streets. Really nice place. Buses leave the City Bus Station (新城长途车站) every 30 minutes or so, take 1:45 hours and cost ¥66.

*Hangzhou &mdash; buses take about 4-4.5 hours, leave from New City Bus Station, and cost ¥150. They leave really frequently first thing in the morning, and then every 30 minutes or so afterward. 

*Shanghai &mdash; can get there by train, bus or plane. Train costs ¥90 for a seat, &yen;175 for a hard-sleeper and takes about 10 hours. In 2009, the CRH Train service has officially entered Wenzhou at their newly opened South Railway Station (温州南站). The tickets are ¥180-220 and it takes slightly over 4 hours. The bus costs ¥200 and takes about 6 hours. It is notable that the bus route between Wenzhou and Shanghai will take you across the longest sea bridge in the world. The plane takes no time and can be as little as ¥200 if you leave very early.

Stay Safe
Wenzhou is not a dangerous city for foreigners, especially foreigners that are careful.

* Clubs &mdash; Be warned, at clubs, notably Muse Club, the nouveau riche Wenzhounese men who go there seem to believe they're allowed to grope, touch and otherwise help themselves to foreign females without permission or repercussion. Drunk Wenzhounese men can also be quick to anger if you reject their advances. The club owners either don't know or don't care. Be vigilant especially going in and out of bathrooms and on the dance floor. 

* Taxis &mdash; it is not unknown for women to be harassed while in a taxi on their own. If you are catching a taxi on your own at night it may be best to sit in the back of the taxi, out of reach of grabby hands. Do not flash too much cash around late at night, as robbery has been known by taxi drivers who pick up accomplices. However, this is rare, and many taxi drivers are well intentioned and friendly.

* Fights &mdash; if a fight breaks out between Chinese people, do not get involved. If a Chinese person gets aggressive with you or a friend, leave discreetly as soon as you can.

* The streets at night &mdash; the streets of Wenzhou are normally safe, and because there are always eyes on foreigners, someone will always see anything that happens. This said, there are certain no-go areas of the city where poverty and demographic abnormality (excess men) can lead to high aggression levels.

* Beggars &mdash; here are a number of beggars throughout the city especially around Wuma Street and Renmin Road. The beggars are run by gangs that maintain the beggars (with food and shelter) while taking the money that is collected by the often disabled/disfigured panhandlers. Don't stand and watch a begging 'performer' because you WILL be harassed for money; being foreign is reason enough to harass you. If they bother you, give them 1 yuan and they will go away.

* Prostitution &mdash; prostitution is illegal in China but is widely tolerated. Brothels or 'Pink Houses' (because of the pink lights) riddle the city and many foreigners are known to use them. Brothels are far from safe, not just because of STIs, but also because of under-age prostitutes, robbery and police raids. Police in Wenzhou have been known to raid brothels while a foreigner is inside, the consequences of which can be far reaching; your visa could be revoked resulting in deportation.
