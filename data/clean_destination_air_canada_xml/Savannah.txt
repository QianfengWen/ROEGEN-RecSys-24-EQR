Savannah the historic riverside birthplace of , was settled in 1733 by British colonists led by General James Oglethorpe and Colonel William Bull. In 1864 when General William Tecumseh Sherman marched in, the mayor of Savannah gave Sherman's men run of the city in exchange for leaving it untorched. As a result, Savannah is one of the few major cities in the South with antebellum charm and architecture remaining intact. Savannah has one of the largest historic districts in the country.

Southerners joke that in , the first thing locals ask you is your business; in , they ask your mother's maiden name; and in Savannah, they ask what you want to drink. It's partly that ethos that keeps the city tourism industry flourishing, along with a little help from what locals call "The Book:" Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (also a feature film ). The local art school, Savannah College of Art and Design also keeps the city peopled with liberals and awash in accessible, affordable art.

See

* City Market City Market is a mixed use project in the northwest corner of the Historic District. The rehabilitation of the four block area began in 1985. The result is a physical facility that economically could not be replicated today. City Market has established itself as a destination for entertainment, dining, and retailing in downtown Savannah. To create an anchor attraction that would attract both tourists and Savannah residents, the developer emulated its successful Torpedo Factory project in Alexandria, Virginia and established the Art Center at City Market. This group of working studios for artists occupies approximately 19,000 square feet of space and has created an opportunity for other tenants of City Market to establish and operate viable food, entertainment, and retail businesses. In addition, City Market has three apartments and approximately 11,000 square feet of office space. The new Ellis Square opened in March of 2010 is immediately west of City Market and has an interactive fountain, information kiosk & a new underground 1100 space parking garage making it very easy to park in the heart of the historic & tourist area.

* River Street a popular cobblestone street (one way east) along the south bank of the Savannah River, is lined with numerous tourist-targeted shops and restaurants. The sculpture of the Waving Girl is towards the east end of River Street. The rest of the Historic District is on a bluff above the riverfront and is connected with River Street via stairs or ramps.

*Forsyth Park, the large public park marking the southern edge of the Historic District, is ringed with Bed and Breakfasts and crowned with a beautiful fountain.

Great books set in Savannah

* Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, Shots rang out in Savannah's grandest mansion in the misty,early morning hours of May 2, 1981. Was it murder or self-defense? For nearly a decade, the shooting and its aftermath reverberated throughout this hauntingly beautiful city of moss-hung oaks and shaded squares. John Berendt's sharply observed, suspenseful, and witty narrative reads like a thoroughly engrossing novel, and yet it is a work of nonfiction. Berendt skillfully interweaves a hugely entertaining first-person account of life in this isolated remnant of the Old South with the unpredictable twists and turns of a landmark murder case.

Events

* Savannah Film Festival, Held in late October/early November. The festival features more than 50 films, selected from more than 600 entries in the categories of feature, short, animation, documentary and student competition, which are submitted from all over the world.

* St. Patrick's Day, Held on March 17th, this is considered by many to be the second largest party in the country. The almost four hour parade winds through the beautiful historic district where families are picnicing in the squares, and the azaleas are in full bloom. "College antics" are usually relegated River Street later that evening, making the day very much family friendly, and loads of kitschy fun.

Historic public squares

Gen. Oglethorpe and Col. Bull laid out their new settlement in 1733 in a series of wards, in which commercial and residential buildings surround a public square. The original four public squares were Johnson, Ellis, Telfair, and Wright. By the mid 19th century, there were 24 public squares in Savannah. Two squares, Elbert and Liberty, both along Montomery St., have been lost to modern construction, and a third one, Ellis, once lost, is being restored. 

* Calhoun Square, Calhoun Square was laid out in 1851, one of the last squares. It is on Abercorn Street with the cross streets being Taylor and Gordon. It was named for John C. Calhoun a well known South Carolina politician and defender of slavery. Massie School and Wesley Monumental Methodist Church are on this square.

This parking garage was torn down in 2007 and is being replaced by an underground parking structure, Savannah's first, with Ellis Square restored on top. 
**On the west side of Ellis Square, the City Market complex extends for two blocks over to Franklin Square. Ellis was the site of the Old City Market, which was demolished in the early 1950s to make way for the infamous parking garage. The loss of the Old City Market upset residents to the extent that efforts began to prevent further losses of irreplaceable buildings.

It was laid out in 1791 and for many years the City's water tower was here so it was referred to as Water Tower or Reservoir Square.

Drink

Savannah is called the "Hostess City of the South" and as such, there are no shortages of watering holes; from hole-in-the wall joints to upscale bars. In downtown Savannah, it is legal to consume alcohol in public. Ask the bartender or doorman for a "go cup" (a "traveler" if you're a local) to pour your libation in.
*The Original Pinkie Masters is a Savannah dive bar. It stands on Drayton in between Lafayette and Madison Square. Jimmy Carter started his successful 1976 Presidential campaign here. There was an infamous split in which the bar temporarily moved. However, if you are uninterested in the politics of it all it is the best place in town to get an affordable drink and see locals, eccentrics and both functional and no so functional alcoholics. 

*Circa 1875 48 Whitaker St. Lots of paneling and atmosphere, this beautiful and cozy bar with an extensive wine selection also mixes great drinks. Becoming the hangout for the intellectual set.

*Club One Jefferson #1 Jefferson Street - Club One defines itself as the premier gay bar in a town priding itself on a level of decadence that falls somewhere between New Orleans's and Key West's, and it's the hottest and most amusing spot in town. Patrons include lesbians and gays from the coastal islands, visiting urbanites, and cast and crew of whatever film is being shot in Savannah at the time (Demi Moore and Bruce Willis showed up here in happier times). There's also likely to be a healthy helping of voyeurs who've read Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. You pay your admission at the door then wander through the street-level dance bar, trek down to the basement-level video bar for a (less noisy) change of venue, and (if your timing is right) climb one floor above street level for a view of the drag shows. There, a bevy of black and white artistes lip-synch the hits of Tina Turner, Gladys Knight, and Bette Midler. The bar is open daily 5PM to 3AM. Shows are nightly at 10:30PM and 12:30AM.

Stay safe

Savannah's Historic District is perfectly safe for exploring the area during the day and at night with at least one other person - normal safety precaution. Outside the historic place, district crime is more prevalant. While exploring the Historic District please do remember this is a tourist area and there will always be those who prey on tourists - be cautious but more so at night. Savannah-Chatham County Police patrol the downtown area frequently on horseback and in patrol cruisers (Not as much as they used to!!). The Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD) is prominent throughout the downtown area and SCAD's Security detail frequently patrols areas near their buildings on bike and vehicle.
