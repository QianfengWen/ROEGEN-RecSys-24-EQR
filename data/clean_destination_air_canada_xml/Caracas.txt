Caracas is the capital and largest city of . It is located in northern Venezuela, near the .

Understand

Venezuela’s urban spirit can be discovered mainly from understanding Caracas, its capital city. Caracas is a busy metropolis located in a beautiful valley, famous for its delicious food, its cultural diversity, and perfect climate, thanks to the unique combination of a high elevation and proximity to the Caribbean Sea. Caracas is a fascinating city to explore, replete with excellent art, food and a bustling nightlife. The city grew slowly until the 1940s. In Caracas, the tallest skyscrapers are: Parque Central Towers, Banco Mercantil Building, BBVA Provincial Tower and The Twin Towers of El Recreo Shopping Mall in Sabana Grande district. Unfortunately, Business Center Confinanzas was not completed. If so, it would be the second tallest skyscraper of the city. Most of the tallest buildings in Caracas are located in La Candelaria and El Conde/Parque Central.

Caracas is a cosmopolitan city, congested and noisy. The restaurants in Caracas are still excellent and have a lot to offer (BUT, owing to an ongoing crisis, this has changed and food is seriously scarce). It is advisable to wear light clothing, comfortable shoes and clothing or jewelry of little value. Also tourists who do not know the language, it is recommended to take a dictionary with Spanish translation to make it easier for them to stay in the country. The people of Caracas are usually quite hospitable and friendly. Caracas is a city of contrasts. El Rosal and Las Mercedes are the most exclusive districts of the city at present. The boulevard of Sabana Grande is the main commercial corridor of the city and is visited by more than 500 thousand people every day. Plaza Bolívar, Plaza El Venezolano and Plaza Diego Ibarra are the most emblematic of the historic center. Plaza Altamira is the icon of the East of the city and has been the center of opposition protests for almost two decades. Caracas is not one of the top touristic destinations of Venezuela, and travelers often bypass the capital city in order to see the country’s amazing natural attractions. However, the Venezuelan capital can be a fascinating city to explore, replete with excellent art, food and a bustling nightlife.

Caracas is a modern, dynamic and diverse city where multiple realities converge at the same time. The architectural, cultural and socioeconomic identity of Caracas has been fragmentation and is the key to understanding Venezuela. Until the beginning of the 20th century, Caracas was a small city that reached La Candelaria. Later, the towns of Sabana Grande, Chacao, Las Mercedes and Petare would grow rapidly and be urbanized. Most of the architectural heritage of Caracas was built in the twentieth century. The Towers of Parque Central Complex, even though they no longer hold the title of the tallest skyscrapers in Latin America, remain the tallest twin towers in the region. Sabana Grande was the favorite place of Juan Domingo Perón during his golden exile in Venezuela, when he lived in the El Rosal and El Bosque neighborhoods.

Caracas is located in a beautiful valley, overlooked by Mount Avila, an impressive mountain that separates the city from the Caribbean Sea and shapes most of the city’s landscape. It is a popular weekend destination for the city’s residents (known as Caraqueños) and is easily reached by taking a very modern cable car that goes all the way from the mountain base to the newly nationalized Waraira Repano park, which is situated at the top of the mountain. In Caracas the staggering inequalities of wealth that characterize Venezuela’s economic situation are on display. They range from very poor neighborhoods in the hills west of the city called “barrios”, to the modern business district of El Rosal, or even the huge mansions of the rich eastern neighborhoods.

The middle class is mainly concentrated in the east of the city (El Recreo de Libertador, Chacao, Baruta, Sucre and El Hatillo), but San Bernardino, La Candelaria, San Pedro and El Paraiso are also important centers of the middle class. The historic center of the city is Plaza Bolívar, the grid has been modified though. The most luxurious urbanization, Caracas Country Club, is located between Parroquia El Recreo of the Libertador Municipality and the Chacao Municipality of the Miranda State. Valle Arriba Country Club and La Lagunita Country Club are as luxurious as Caracas Country Club, however. The Embassy of the United States of America is located in Valle Arriba Country Club, which has one of the most spectacular views of the city at its Mirador Valle Arriba. The geographical center of the Metropolitan District of Caracas has been set at Sabana Grande, considered the Eastern Gate of Caracas. The district of Sabana Grande is the one with the best coverage by the Caracas Metro, but the center of Caracas, Chacao, El Rosal, El Bosque and Altamira are also easily accessible. Most of the embassies are located in the Chacao and Baruta municipalities. However, some have a limited presence in El Recreo. The most important business center nowadays is El Rosal.

The city’s streets and highways are always crowded with vehicles, as Venezuela has the cheapest gasoline in the world (at about $0.12/gallon). Subsidized gasoline and inadequate infrastructure have helped spur pollution and big traffic lines in almost all of the inner city motorways. Caracas’ subway system, once one of the best in all Latin America, is still quick but is often crowded and prone to delays.

Visitors need to be aware that Caracas remains one of the most violent cities in the world, with large parts of the city effectively No Go Areas to outsiders. Murder tallies of as many as 40 are not uncommon on weekends, so exercising caution and common sense - especially at night - is essential to a safe visit. 

Entertainment and Nightlife

Caracas is a cosmopolitan city and is admired for its gastronomy. It has restaurants and bars inspired by the cuisine of many different countries and cultures due to great waves of immigration from Europe and the Middle East after the Second World War. 

The city is filled with “centros comerciales” and department stores, and the popular restaurants and clubs in the towering malls due to security concerns. In the San Ignacio Mall you’ll find the city’s young, rich and beautiful drinking whiskey and “Las Mercedes”, "El Rosal" and “La Castellana” districts are also popular late night hot spots. "Sabana Grande", "Chacao" and "El Hatillo" are important late night hot spots as well, but "El Rosal" and "Las Mercedes" are the fanciest. Sabana Grande is the bohemian district of the city.

People often party until 4 or 5 o’clock in the morning, so it’s advisable to take a cab (that you trust) when heading out.

Climate
Caracas has a tropical climate with very little variation between summer and winter temperatures. Set in a valley some 900 meters above sea level, its climate is often described as its best feature: never cold, seldom too hot. Average daily temperature in summer ranges from a minimum of 18˚C (64˚F) to a maximum of 28˚C (82˚F). Winter temperatures are only two to three degrees cooler. Most rainfall occurs during the period from May to November and can be accompanied by electrical storms.

Money

A complicated foreign exchange control system creates famous headaches for foreign travellers. Foreign exchange transactions for the bolívar (Venezuelan currency) are carried out at the exchange offices or banks, at an official rate. For some time now, these financial operations have been restricted in hotels. Currency exchange operations are authorized by the Currency Administration Commission (CENCOEX). Which requires a registration process that delays the process a bit. It is convenient to review DolarToday, DolarPro, AirTM, DolarTrue and other portals, to understand the current pricing scheme in Venezuela. Prices can change quickly. Most things are cheap abroad, but not all.

If you have a trusted local contact, your best bet is to buy currency discreetly from him or her at the parallel rate. Most airport employees that approach you discreetly looking to sell at the parallel rate are also reliable. Most locals will advise you not to even consider coming to visit unless you have a friend in the area who can help you to navigate the complicated currency situation (and move around safely as well). Note that all credit card transactions are processed at the DICOM rate. If you decide to go the Official-rate route, remember that foreign exchange transactions must take place through exchange houses or via credit cards. Currency exchange for tourists can be arranged at "casas de cambio" (exchange houses), located near most major hotels. It is technically also possible to exchange money at commercial banks; however, the extensive and painfully slow paperwork required makes this an unrealistic option for tourists. It is now possible to exchange money at hotels.

Credit cards are generally accepted at most establishments, and will be charged at the DICOM rate. Due to the prevalence of credit card fraud, travelers should exercise caution in using their credit cards and should check statements regularly to ensure that no unauthorized charges have been made. Caracas has ATMs with 24-hour service where users may withdraw local currency, but many of these ATMs may not accept foreign-issued debit cards. Travelers should check DolarToday website.

Get in

By plane
Maiquetía's Simón Bolívar Airport has three passenger terminals (Internacional, Nacional and Auxiliar) and is 25 km away from central Caracas via a highway through the coastal mountains. A new road bridge, replacing one that collapsed in 2006, came into service in July 2007, ending months of tortuous journeys to and from the airport. The trip to Caracas should now take around 40 minutes or up to 60-70 minutes during rush hour.

This international airport is served by American Airlines, Copa, Air Europa, Air France, Turkish Airlines and Iberia among others. In May 2016 Lufthansa and Latam announced the suspension of flights to/from Frankfurt, Sao Paulo and Lima. In July 2017, Avianca and Delta announced they will suspend all service to Venezuela on August 16, 2017 and September 17, 2017 respectively.

Non-stop flights are available to and from , Havana, Madrid, Paris, Lisbon, Aruba, Curaçao, Port of Spain, Fort de France, Istanbul, Panamá City (3 times a day) and other cities. 

The non-stop flights to , Cartagena de Indias, San Jose (Costa Rica), Guayaquil, Lima, Santiago de Chile, Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, San Juan (PR), Punta Cana, Dallas, Toronto, Oporto, Funchal, Tenerife, Rome, Milano and Damascus are no longer operational.

The cheapest and arguably the safest way to the city is using the big red SITSSA buses from the government. You will first need to buy your ticket in the form of a rechargeable card at a kiosk inside the airport or you can ask other passengers to use their card to pay for you and you can pay them cash. The bus takes around 30 minutes and goes directly to Hotel Alba (previously the Hilton Hotel) which is within walking distance to the Bella Artes metro station. However, it is recommended to arrange a taxi.

Please be aware that there is an exit fee that must be paid in cash as the office in charge of collection does not accept credit cards. However there are ATMs, currency exchange houses (charging the official rate) and unofficial brokers willing to provide bolívares at a more advantageous rate.

It is advisable to be at the airport 3-4 hours early (and not the normal 2 hours) because of arbitrary security checks.

By car
Nice and pretty highways connect Caracas with and the airport to the north; , and in the west; Barcelona and in the east.

While driving in Caracas can be a hectic experience, renting a car to experience the outlying areas is a wonderful way to leave behind the well-traveled routes.

Car rental is available in the following locations:
* Hertz Car Rental is available at the international and the domestic terminals, as well as several locations in the city
* 

By bus

Passengers have the option of alighting either at Gato Negro metro station (somewhat unsafe at street level) or under a bridge at the Parque Central bus terminal, from where you'll need to get a taxi to your final destination or walk about 1 km along a busy road to the Bellas Artes metro station.

There is also a new government-run bus service to the Alba Hotel in Bellas Artes, which costs BsF 8. Passengers do not need to be guests at Alba. Further information is available from the two tourist board offices in the international terminal of Maiquetía airport.

The La Bandera bus terminal connects Caracas with towns and cities to the west of the capital such as La Victoria (1 hour), Maracay (1.5 hours), Valencia (2.5 hours) and Merida (~12 hours). The 800m walk from La Bandera metro station to the bus terminal is unsafe after dark and travelers should exercise caution at all times. For the eastern part of the country there's the Terminal del Oriente. Beware of the small "independent" bus services which are announced by "voceros" on both terminals. Although they have more flexible departure times, the buses can be small and uncomfortable, with speakers that blast loud music even at night. 

There are also private carriers that offer more comfort. They also cost a little more. The most well known are Aeroexpresos Ejecutivos Expresos Occidente, Flamingo, Rodovias which operate from their own private terminals, something to consider if you plan on transferring for a destination they don’t cover. As of late 2015, there's a shortage of buses for many of the longer routes thus you will see people queuing at the bus terminals (private and public) at 5am or earlier. Most bus companies only sell tickets for trips on the same day with the exception of a few (eg Aeroexpreso Ejecutivo, Flamingo, Rodovias). Even then you may need to join the early morning queue for your trips a few days ahead.

Get around

Taxis can be easily hailed in the street and are generally (but not always) safe. They have no meters so prices should be agreed on before getting in. Some reports indicate that the situation has improved and there are fixed rates posted. Caracas traffic is notoriously bad and the metro is a better option if your destination is conveniently located near a station. Licensed taxis have yellow plates and while some private cars with white plates are taxis too, it’s generally safer to take a licensed cab. 
Another reliable option is Easytaxi, which is an App where you can order a taxi to pick you up.
 
Venezuelan taxi cab drivers may quote you about double the actual price when you ask how much a ride will be. Bargaining is totally acceptable in this case. Simply respond with a more reasonable price that you are willing to pay, and it’s more than likely you can meet in the middle. If the taxi driver continues to quote an outrageous price, simply walk away and try another.

The Caracas metro is modern, comparatively safe and extremely cheap. A single journey costs just BsF 4 (Nov 2015), "ida y vuelta" (round trip) is BsF 8 and a 10 journey "multi abono" ticket is BsF 36. The service is heavily subsidized nowadays. Buying the Multi Abono will save you time from queing up each time you use the Metro. Because prices have changed little in recent years and bus fares have outpaced inflation, the metro is frequently overcrowded, particularly during peak hours.

The metro system is backed up by a network of metrobuses that depart from certain metro stations and take fixed routes to areas of the city not reached by the underground. Like the metro, metrobuses are cheap and clean, but passengers complain of bus shortages. Most services run only about every 20 minutes. The buses have fixed stops and will not pick up passengers elsewhere. The Metro also connects people from the barrios via the Metro Cable, which are cable cars that goes above the barrios. There are 2 lines in operation as of Nov 2015 and may be a good way to see a different side of Caracas in safety from above. The Metro is also connected to the less frequently used Cabletren (driverless and automated) is of less used for tourist since it skirts along the edges of Petare. 

The ubiquitous minibuses, or por puestos, run along many main roads in Caracas, often ending up in obscure residential neighborhoods that are not accessible by metro. They can be flagged down anywhere and you can generally ask the driver to let you jump off whenever he stops, such as traffic lights. Although sometimes useful (for reaching the Sabas Nieves entrance to El Avila from the Altamira metro station) the buses are more expensive than the metro (BsF 2000-6000 April 2018), slower, less safe, and are invariably in a very bad condition. It is advisable not to use your smartphones inside buses. Bus robberies are common in Caracas. If you see passengers suddenly disembarking when some young men enter the bus, it is best to alight and wait for another bus.

Sleep

Caracas has many hotels, but lacks youth hostels found in other South American countries. Some years ago, backpackers used to find that Caracas was not a cheap destination because there were not rooms available in the 20-30 USD typical hostel range. However, the situation has changed because of the economic crisis in Venezuela. While the whole of the city is considered to be dangerous at night, it’s preferable to stay near Sabana Grande or farther east. If you stay farther east, it is advisable to always arrange a taxi, however. Many hotels in the Sabana Grande area will offer rooms on an hourly basis (euphemistically known as love hotels) which are primarily for unmarried Venezuelan couples. Most of the prices of these list are not updated. Nowadays, it may be way cheaper to stay in Caracas because of the inflation in the country. You will find it out when making a reservation.

Budget

Most hotels are in Sabana Grande, which is the geographic center of the city or midtown. The true downtown or historic city center, is known as "el centro" (around Capitolio and Teatros Metro Station), which is, in general, not a good place to stay. The best options to stay in the center of the city are Hotel Waldorf Caracas and Hotel Alex Caracas. Hotel Waldorf is a new luxury hotel in La Candelaria neighborhood. While Sabana Grande has affordable hotel rates (from $100 to $400 five-star), you need to be wary of occasional street crime in the form of purse snatching (on women) and pick-pocketing are kinda common, but kidnapping is less frequent in the district. Motorcycle-riding thieves are not common near the boulevard of Sabana Grande, but they can be found near Avenida Libertador. Motorcycle-riding thieves are common in most of the residential areas of Caracas. A good place to start is the Calle de Hoteles at Prolongación Avenida Las Acacias & Avenida de Los Mangos (which has 2 decent and cheap non-love-motel posadas, but they are not well signposted and look like residential houses). Another great option to stay is "Centro Residencial Solano", which rents 85 flats in this famous residential complex, divided into three categories: family, business and exclusive VIP. The VIP apartments have the most extravagant luxuries of the entire city of Caracas. Since 2017, new fashion stores has opened in Sabana Grande, such as Balú (H&M), AISHOP, Brands Shop, Planeta Sports and many more. Now you can buy a pair of Levi's in the boulevard of Sabana Grande.

The majority of budget hotels you find in Centro and Sabana Grande area are "mataderos" or love motels. Anyway, the Sabana Grande Boulevard sports high-shining lamp posts and police officers along the way. However, crooked cops are also known to sometimes harass hippie-looking travelers during the day, searching for drugs Sabana Grande is a pleasantly walkable promenade, fantastic for people-watching and casual shopping. As for the large shopping malls around Sabana Grande, they are absolutely safe, especially one known as El Recreo. All this makes Sabana Grande one of the best place to stay for many. However, the best and most exclusive neighborhoods of the city are El Rosal and Las Mercedes. Sabana Grande is great for those who love to walk, but Las Mercedes hosts the best and most exclusive nightclubs of Caracas.

Another option is to stay in a nearby town or city and bus in in the morning, and get the bus out before nightfall. It will be cheaper and safer than staying in Caracas.

* Bella Vista Caracas is a modern and safe place with a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere.

Since 2017, Picasso's works are on display in the Museum of Fine Arts.

Stay safe
Owing to the recent acts of political violence between government supporters and anti-government protesters, the security situation in Venezuela is dire. With the lack of effective law enforcement and criminal justice system, crime is also widespread, and often goes unpunished. Caracas' major safety problems are the drugged, homeless people that are found all around the city and muggers with knives, though street gangs are also present. The following advice, most of which is common sense, should make your stay more enjoyable and minimise the risk of trouble:

* Try to restrict your activities to the daytime - but remember that crime in Caracas strikes at any time. Be vigilant.
* Avoid walking alone and do not venture into dodgy-looking places. Trust your instincts.
* Do not flag taxis on the street, call them by phone or try to arrange some form of trusted private transportation. Even then, be extra vigilant about drivers; they may seem "friendly" enough, though they use it to their advantage so be very careful. 
* Do not flash any electronic devices (iPods, cameras, mobile phones) and leave your jewelry in the hotel. 
* Bring copies of your passport and important documents and leave the originals in the hotel.
* Be aware of your surroundings and even if you are lost, try to look like you know where you're going (in that case try to find a shop or mall, so you can "regroup" and find out where you are). Of course, this can increase the chance of becoming a target for criminals.
* In public transport, try to sit at the front and avoid using your electronics. If it's packed, however, wait for another to arrive that's least crowded.

Violent crime in Caracas is a major problem, and it has been getting steadily worse during the recent years: Caracas is now by some counts the world's most dangerous city, with 130.35 homicides per 100.000 residents in 2016. However, Prodavinci (portal of intellectuals of the Venezuelan opposition) do not trust at all these figures. In reality, no one really knows the truth because those figures are unofficial. The production of data without definition of procedures, standardized classification systems and duly trained officials for its application does not guarantee data that is accurate, unbiased, interpretable and coherent. The academies of Venezuelan universities do not completely trust these figures. Nobody really has the data. These counts have been made based on unofficial information from the media and protected police sources. For this reason, they are not really reliable at all.

Caracas has been listed as one of the most dangerous cities in the world, but the most worrying thing is that there is a lot of unofficial information and little cooperation between private NGOs and the authorities. Statistics have been altered by the Venezuelan Observatory of Violence, as Kronick pointed out. The most curious thing, that is, the criticisms were also received by the Venezuelan opposition itself. Mr. Kronick has also published his own statistics in Caracas Chronicles, which are less scandalous than those of the Venezuelan Observatory of Violence. Even so, the rates of violence in Caracas remain high. Take into account that what you read in the press could be exaggerated and that has been demonstrated academically.

The OVV acknowledged that it counted part of the violent deaths twice a year, creating the false impression that there was an increase in violence in that year, which it produced artificially high estimates for 2014 and 2015. Instead of adding A + B, they added A + B + B. To correct this error, they subtracted another distorted B (cases of resistance to authority). After making this change, the OVV produced a revised estimate of 81 violent deaths per 100,000 inhabitants in 2015 (balance between its original estimate of 90 and Kronick's estimate of 68.5). To reach that final B that they subtracted, the OVV used an average of the percentage of cases of resistance and homicides that were resistance, from 1990 to 2010 (B / (A + B)). However, that percentage is not stable, so the final death toll after all was inflated and altered. The Venezuelan Observatory of Violence did not answer why they did so and did not justify its actions. However, they did admit that there were calculation errors.

Stick to the tourist areas and dress like the average Venezuelans (jeans and short-sleeved shirt) and do not wear any expensive looking jewelry, though this may not always work as you can still be a target to potential muggers and other types of criminals at anytime. The barrios (poor neighborhoods or shantytowns) are to be avoided. The shady-looking streets near the tourists areas should be avoided as well. They are mostly built into the hills around the west side of Caracas, similar to the favelas in Brazil. These neighborhoods are extremely dangerous, but they are far from the main tourist areas. However, Petare is located in the east side of Caracas, which is the biggest favela of the country. Some say Petare may be the biggest favela in Latin America, but all the area has not been surveyed yet. In case you are robbed, simply hand over what is asked of you. If you have none to give, however, then your best bet is to say those last prayers and be prepared for the worst, that is, being kidnapped and held for ransom, and police will not help you get out of a deadly situation. For this reason it is advisable to carry a “decoy” wallet with small bills (around US$30). Most thieves carry guns and they will use them regardless of the consequences (there is a sense of immunity due to poor policing) and they will get away with it unpunished.

Venezuela is also one of the only countries in the world in which Blackberry still is the popular phone of choice (which is odd as Blackberry has been discontinued in 2022 and Blackberry no longer sells their phones). If you can get your hands on a cheap one that looks nice, it's also a good thing to bring down and hand over in case robbed (there have been news reports of criminals physically beating car passengers that they rob for having only an iPhone to steal). Most thieves carry guns and they will use them regardless of the consequences (there is a sense of immunity due to poor policing). 

In the Metro, especially rush hours, do take care of your pockets and handbags. A common tactic is a few guys will seem to be hesitating to enter the train while you are behind trying to push your way in, while the doors are about to close, they will suddenly decide to leave the train suddenly and in the chaos (locals know what's going on, thus they will try to leave the train too), you may find your pocket empty.

The statistics of the Venezuelan Observatory of Violence have been strongly biased, as demonstrated by Dorothy Kronick of Prodavinci. However, the crime problem is still serious. Kronick's estimates were not far behind in demonstrating the violence in Caracas, but they made evident the statistical errors of some NGOs. Robberies, assaults and kidnappings are very common, so it is recommended not to go out on the street with valuable items, keep cell phones out of sight of others while in public places, and avoid certain areas of Caracas. The latest security report of the United States Embassy is updated (January 2018). Previously, the districts of Chacao and Baruta were quite safe, but the situation has changed. In fact, kidnapping is very common in these districts, and tourists are not exempt from being kidnapped. The kidnappers demand sums of money that can reach 20 thousand dollars, or risk killing their victims. Las Mercedes and El Rosal are excellent alternatives for the most demanding tourists who have a comfortable budget to pay for line taxis or rent a car in the city. To walk the city and use public transport, the ideal area of ​​the city may be Sabana Grande, following the recommendations of the hotel, though this is a dice-roll in itself. The previously mentioned districts have safer areas than others and the hotel will provide you with the necessary information to make your stay in Caracas a pleasant one, though again, this can be seriously dicey due to the ongoing, unpredictable situation. Hotel Alex and Hotel Waldorf are the most recommended options to stay in the center of Caracas, both hotels are in La Candelaria. Hotel Waldorf is a brand new five star hotel and it is a landmark of Venezuelan architecture.

All areas of Caracas are vulnerable to crime, but the target of the gangs is not the same. The gangster who steals a phone is not as professional as the one who is part of a gang of kidnappers. The best idea is to stay in crowded places, where you see riots of people, such as the boulevard of Sabana Grande and the commercial areas of Chacao and Baruta, though getting lost in a crowd is an obvious red flag; you will face the same outcome as being a victim of crime. In these last two, take into account that most people travel in a private car and not on foot. The commercial and residential areas of Caracas have different dynamics. In crowded commercial districts, it is prudent not to wear fancy clothes and to dress like the local population. Nowadays, precautions must be taken in all the districts of Caracas. Of course, the conditions of the district make it more vulnerable to certain types of damage. While pickpockets abound in Sabana Grande for being the most important commercial corridor in the city, gangs of kidnappers are more common in the residential and dark areas of the Metropolitan District. These areas are: Santa Monica, Florida, Altamira, El Hatillo, Prados del Este, El Cafetal, Los Palos Grandes, etc. You must follow your instincts and not get carried away by first impressions. Often, these gangs of kidnappers receive information from security personnel working in the residences. Common sense. Do not talk about dollars with any stranger, in fact, do not talk to anyone at all.

The police in most districts of the city tend to be corrupt, including at the international airport. Nowadays, there are no safe districts at all. It is advisable to avoid dark streets after 9 PM, the same applies in daytimes where areas are isolated. Lonely streets are not recommended. Tourists should stay in areas frequented by high vehicular and pedestrian traffic, though crime can and will still happen on even frequented areas. Venezuelans in general are friendly and helpful and living through the danger on a daily basis, so will not be shy in their concerns for your safety (this, however, is nothing but a mere facade). Dress like the average Venezuelan and follow the indications of the hotel. It is more likely that you will do okay, if you can survive through most of the days. Venezuelans in general are friendly and helpful, though they will openly avoid helping those who are victims of crime so asking for help, even in crucial situations, will drive them away. The most common recommendation is not to take the smartphone in open places. Kidnapping is a major problem for middle and upper-class Venezuelans, travelers included if they're that unlucky. As with many other developing nations, petty theft is a problem. Ask hotel management to store your valuables when you leave your room and use a money belt for your passport/extra cash when traveling. If, however, you're very cautious, it's best to never bring valuables with you at all.

Most locals will advise you not to even consider visiting unless you have friends in the area who can help you to move around safely and deal with the complicated currency situation. Caracas is by far the most dangerous city in Venezuela and malandros are coming up daily with new schemes to rob and kidnap, and even kill. Be very wary when on the road at all times, always keep your eyes on the lookout for an escape pathway, and be wary of being followed (especially by motorcycles). Over the last few years, the malandros have stopped traffic with a funeral procession in order to go car to car and take wallets/cell phones at gunpoint; staged car accidents with injury so as to rob good samaritans who stop. If you see a motorcycle with 2 men - one wearing a helmet and the other without, keep your distance and drive away. This is a typical robbery setup since the lack of a helmet allows the passenger on the back to have full 180 degree vision while scanning for victims while the driver is free to concentrate on the road.

Again, common sense prevails and note that driving a Mercedes through a poor neighborhood may be unpleasant for both you and the locals (just like anywhere else in the world), and the same applies for late-model cars, or cars that are well-maintained. Keep a cool head a maintain a low profile!

As there is an ongoing blackout occurring in Caracas, and even outside of the capital city, this can make night travel even more dangerous than it already is.

Contact
There are many "Centros de Conexiones" in which you can easily make domestic and international calls. There is also a growing number of internet cafes, albeit on a very limited basis due to increased censorship.

Cope
Caracas has been the staging ground of violent political conflict in the last few years, as well as suffering from a high incidence of crime. While taking appropriate precautions (dressing down, keeping valuables out of sight and avoiding dangerous areas) will probably keep you out of harm's way, paranoia abounds. Traveling with a partner or in groups is advisable.
