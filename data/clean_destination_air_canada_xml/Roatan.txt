Understand

The island of Roatan is located 60 km (30 miles) off the north coast of Honduras atop the worlds second largest coral reef. The reef attracts many fish, and is world known for scuba diving. 
Roatan is the largest of the Bay Islands at about 77 kilometres (48 mi) long, and less than 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) at its widest. The island has a number of beaches, all of which are public. Originally an English colony, and later ceded to Honduras, Roatan has a mixture of english and spanish speaking natives. 
With two cruise ship ports, Roatan has become a cruise destination, and roads and beaches can be busy when ships are in port. Prices for services may be higher when a ship is in. 
In recent years the island has experienced a lot of development and has a number of resorts along with more rustic accommodation as well. The western side of the island is the most populated and where most tourists stay, and the eastern side is more remote and isolated.
Roatan has a warm climate with daytime temperatures between 25 - 30 deg C (80 - 90 deg F) year round.

Villages

* West Bay - is the furthest-west area of the island, has some good restaurants and places to stay, and several large resorts have been built on the beach. It's arguably the best stretch of beach in the western portion of the island - powder-white sand that is very well maintained. The reef is a short swim away for excellent snorkeling, especially near the west-most tip, also known as Tabyana Beach. West Bay is also home to some of the best sunsets. It is recommended to spend beach time in the West Bay and bar time in the West End. 

* West End - has some good restaurants and places to stay, and it is definitely the most fun town on the island. There are bars, restaurants, live music, right on the Caribbean. The are also a multitude of dive shops, if you are interested in learning to dive, or would like to do some fun dives as a certified diver.

* - a mostly residential area, Sandy Bay also has a few resorts, such as Anthony's Key Resort, where you can swim with dolphins, as well as a hostel, Roatan Backpackers' Hostel. There are also a few restaurants such as The Blue Parrot, The Beach Grill at Blue Bahia, and Tranquil Seas. Octopus Divers is in Sandy Bay, if you're staying in the area and would like to do diving. The Carambola Gardens is located in Sandy Bay as well. If you are interested in doing volunteer work on the island, there are several non-profits in Sandy Bay, such as Clinica Esperanza, Care4Communities, and the SandCastle Library. The Sandy Bay beach gives easy access to beautiful snorkeling, which is about a 200 meter swim from shore.

* - is where the airport is located, and most of life's necessities can be found here, including stores, restaurants, and banks. 

* French Harbor - has some good restaurants and resorts and most tourists do not venture further east than French Harbor, which is at roughly the mid point of the island. Past this point are a few newer beach resorts, resort communities, and some private towns with beaches and resorts. Many of the resorts, restaurants and bars on this part of the island were in the past a secret of locals and expats but with the west end becoming more crowded the secret is out and more tourist are finding their way to the east end of the island. One point of interest would be Jonesville and the infamous Hole in the Wall restaurant reached by taking a small water taxi from Jonesville to reach it. Another is Camp Bay Beach Adventure Lodge and the Tasty Tarpon Restaurant located on Camp Bay Beach the largest of all the beaches of the Bay Islands and can be accessed by car or boat. 

* Punta Gorda - Fishing community of the Garifuna.

* Oak Ridge Fishing community with few roads, and buildings on stilts over the water. 

* Camp Bay - is a further on from Oak Ridge about 4.5 miles and home to the largest natural beach on all the Bay Islands - Camp Bay Beach, which you can gain free access to at a couple different locations and has a small beachfront resort and restaurant: Camp Bay Beach Adventure Lodge. Camp Bay is about the furthest you can go in a car. Past Camp Bay are the mangroves which are quite beautiful when navigated by boat and kayak. There are many tours through the mangroves which can be chartered from various points on the island.

* Port Royal Small community, originally founded by English pirates

The Utila Dream now provides ferry services between Roatan to Utila once a day at 10:45am on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays.

Afternoon boats can be rougher due to stronger winds. Make sure to take some travel sickness pills if you are unsure how you will react. The trip from La Ceiba to Roatan can be rougher than the return trip, some locals fly from the mainland to Roatan but will take the ferry from the island to the mainland.

Get around
Roatán has a system of paved roads connecting the most important communities of the Island. From the Western End of the Island, at the community of West Bay, the road leads through West End, Sandy Bay, Coxen Hole, Brick Bay, Mount Pleasant, French Harbour and Oakridge - Punta Gorda after which it becomes a dirt road and continues east for a distance, to the area of Paya Bay, Camp Bay, Port Royal, and other eastern communities.

By bus
Buses run every 15 min between Coxen Hole and West End during the day. They depart from opposite the market in Coxan Hole. Buses run every hour to Oak Ridge, stopping at the new ferry terminal and passing through French Harbour, Polly Tilly Bight, and Punta Gorda on the way. These buses leave from opposite the HB Warren supermarket in Coxen Hole.

By taxi
There are hundreds of taxis and they can be bargained with. But ask the price in advance and if it seems high, ask another. Even if you agree on the price make sure you have the exact amount of the fare as some corrupt taxi drivers do not give back your change. Many taxies are "colectivo" or shared and will be stopping along the way. Prices from the airport are fixed during the day and negotiable at night. A cab from the airport to West Bay is US$25. Tipping is not expected by drivers. If you are looking for contact details for a reputable taxi driver during your stay, the roatan taxi directory is a community contributed list of drivers with ratings from other travelers. Taking a taxi with a reliable driver is highly recommended. 

Water Taxi

Scooter rentals can be found on the main road in West End and West Bay. The daily rent is between USD25-35. As a guarantee against accidents agencies will want to swipe your credit card. Be careful as the roads have no shoulder and local drivers stop in the middle of the road, and may pass on curves. Expect poor road quality with potholes. Speed bumpers are also abound.

The island can be explore in one day in a 2 hour drive. Some places offers a driver too.

Talk
English, Spanish, Garifuna.

English is widely spoken, especially in the West End and West Bay communities and is the native language of many Roatanians of English and African descent (except for the Garifuna). Spanish is spoken natively by most residents and is the second language of many of the native English speakers. Spanish is the official language of Honduras and as such is the primary language of the school system. Garifuna is spoken by the Garifuna people who are descendants of the Kalipuna peoples of St. Vincent. There is also 'Island Talk' spoken by the native Caribbean people.

Asylum bar &amp; grill is on a palapa literally over the calm waters in Camp Bay which can sometimes feel like the restaurant at the end of the universe after the long journey of getting there. Luckily these places always have beer on ice and grilled food which makes the trip worth it. If you're looking to get off the beaten path and out of the tourist ridden West End, this is it.

Buy

The local currency is the Lempira, but US dollars are accepted in almost all shops and restaurants, however, your change is mostly given in Honduran Lempiras, and the exchange rate varies from in each shop.
 
Local handicrafts abound and can be had for very little money. Look for Central American arts and crafts, brightly-painted pottery, wood carvings, costume jewelry, tee-shirts, cigars and clothing. Remember that the asking price should only be considered a jumping-off point for some downward haggling. It's expected and if you have the stomach for it, you'll likely end up with a final price somewhere around 40-50% lower.

Drink

Roatan boasts a wide array of experiences for night life depending on your taste. Since the arrival of cruise ships, prices have risen somewhat and restaurants and bars cater to cruise passengers as well as North American and European tourists. These types of establishments are relatively easy to find as they are mostly located in and around the West End. Prices here are generally higher than in most other places on the island. 

The best part about drinking in the west end is the pub crawl that occurs almost every night. Its virtually mandatory to start at Sundowners and enjoy drinks whilst watching the sun go down over the beautiful bay in front. When Sundowners shuts at 10PM the whole bar shifts about 50 m down the street to kick on at the Purple Turtle where you can enjoy live music out the back. The Purple Turtle closes at midnight and from here most people continue on to the Nova Bar or the Twisted Toucan's will be the joint to party at and where you will meet most of the locals in the region this being a favorite haunt. Most people go home from here but if you really are feeling like an adventure grab a group of friends and head down the beach to FuBar.

Stay safe

Remember, although Roatan is away from the security problems Central America and mainland Honduras have, you should take precautions. Use common sense in the busier areas of the island. In Coxen Hole and French Harbour be extra careful specially at night and try not to travel late by yourself but rather with hotel transportation or a local from the island in who you can trust. Keep exact change (some restaraunts and taxi drivers may "Not have" enough change).

During hurricane season and strong storms is NOT recommended to travel by boat or swim. The naval forces in Honduras will alert the island about these seasons and you should take the necessary precautions.

During storms jellyfish may be wash closer to the beach, beware because the sting hurts. Remember that you are in a tropical zone, so mosquitoes can be a problem specially because they can transmit Dengue, Zika and chikungunya. It is recommended that you drink bottled water. The island municipality is a really clean place so you probably will not find any health issue but any symptom you may feel contact the emergency number in your hotel or contact the next emergency numbers:

Public Hospitals: 911
Cemesa Hospital Roatan: +504 9446-0097
ICU Roatan: +504 2449-2925
