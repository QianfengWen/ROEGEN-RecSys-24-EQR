Tbilisi is known for its distinctive architecture, which reflects the city's storied past and comprises an eclectic mix of Medieval, Neoclassical, Art Nouveau, Stalinist and Modernist structures.

Understand
__TOC__
Tbilisi lies in the centre of eastern Georgia, in the foothills of the Trialeti mountain range. According to Georgian legends, it was founded in the 5th century by King Vakhtang Gorgasali who, while hunting, shot a pheasant which fell into a warm spring and was either boiled or healed. Either way, the king was inspired to found a city on the site, and the name of the city derives from the Georgian word tbili meaning "warm". 

Although the city has been destroyed and rebuilt some 29 times, the layout of the Old Town is largely intact with narrow alleys and big crooked houses built around courtyards.

Climate
Tbilisi has cool winters and warm summers. There is very little rain. It rains only 70 days per year. It is common to snow in Tbilisi in the beginning of the year. Most rain falls on the summer months.
Summers in Tbilisi can get very hot, with the record high being 42°C, winters can get cold with the record low being -24.4°C.

Neo-Turs bus company offers bus transfers Tbilsi - - and back, starting from Didube bus station (price: USD100).

By minibus
The main mini-bus station can be found at Metro station Didube. Buses 21 and 46 lead there from the city center. It's rather large, and you'll find minibuses to almost anywhere. Once at the metro platforms, take the train on the right (going forwards). This direction takes you to the main station and centre. There are no signs in English.

For minibuses to some destinations (e.g. Sighnaghi), you must go to Samgori, at Samgori metro station.

Minibuses from Yerevan will drop you off at Ortachala bus station, which is not easily connected to the metro network, but taxis in Georgia are cheap, or at the train station. Vans (Grey Mercedes Sprinter) leave from the parking lot in front of Yerevan train station at 9:00, 11:00, 13:00, 15:00, and 17:00 and cost 30 lari or 6000 AMD. Please note, that drivers might be smoking inside while driving.

By boat
Tbilisi is located inland and does not have ferry connections. You may be able to catch a ferry from Ukraine to Batumi, eight hours away.

Get around
Main transport inside and outside Tbilisi city is bus and minibus - marshrutka. 

 By metro 

Tbilisi has a two-line metro system, which operates 06:00-23:59.

All signs inside the metro are in Georgian and English. Station names are announced in both English and Georgian as well. There are a few system maps in carriages, usually located above one of the carriage doors. It will be hard to find English speakers riding the Metro; Russian, however, is widely spoken. Take a bilingual map with you if you are not proficient with the local alphabet/pronunciation. 

A trip with the metro and bus system in Tbilisi costs GEL1.00, but you will have to buy a Metromani card (GEL2) at the counter. You can load the card with any amount you like, and use it for travel on buses, the metro, and the new yellow marshrutkas. Marshrutkas vary in price from GEL0.40-0.80. If you keep the receipt when buying the card, you can get any excess amount returned from the card within 30 days after the purchase.

You can use the public transportation system for 90 minutes paying only 1lari.

At the Samgori station, near the east end of line 1 (red), one can change for bus 337 to the airport. The bus actually goes all the way to the city centre, but roads can become congested, so changing may be a quicker option.

By bus
City buses are yellow or blue, and come in various sizes. The bus number and a description of the route are usually listed on signs in the bus windows, but only in Georgian. In the center most stations have accurate electronic arrival boards, in English and Georgian, and display the bus number, minutes to arrival, and destination. Outside of the center, look for a sign with a picture of a bus.

Board through any door you like; usually the double doors in the middle are easiest. A journey costs GEL0.50, and exact change is required if you don't have a touch card (which can be purchased at Metro stations). If you have a Metromani card, touch it on the top of the card machines and make sure you wait for a paper ticket to be issued. Hold onto the ticket you receive on the bus; you will need to present it to the yellow-shirted ticket checkers. 

Marshrutkas are vans which service the side streets of the city; they are independently owned. Like buses, the route is posted in the front window (often only in Georgian), but marshrutkas use a different route numbering system, and the route descriptions may be more general than the buses (e.g. "Vake" rather than a specific street in the Vake area). Fare is (on average) 0.80 GEL; shout "gacheret" when you want to get off, and hand the driver your fare on the way out. You can pay also with the electronic card you need for the metro. Buses are generally easier to use than marshrutkas if you don't speak Georgian or Russian.

By taxi
Taxis in Tbilisi are typically privately owned vehicles, and don't run on a meter. If you're going anywhere other than the nearest metro station, major hotels, or tourist destinations, or if you don't speak Georgian or Russian, it's likely that your driver will stop multiple times and ask pedestrians for directions. Even then, he may not know how to get to your destination. If the driver has difficulty finding your destination, he will charge you for his trouble. ALWAYS negotiate a price beforehand, and insist on paying before departing. A trip anywhere in the city should never cost more than 15 lari, unless you're going to the airport. Getting a receipt is also really difficult if not impossible!

* Bolt - mobile application with hundreds of verified taxi drivers in Tbilisi. Choose taxi by distance, car model and user feedback ratings. App calculates taxi ride fare and local support team monitoring the rides and solving potential issues.
* Yandex.taxi - mobile application that works like Uber. Probably the cheapest version. A ride within the city will set you back between 1 and 5 Lari.
* Maxim - similar as Yandex only Cheaper and through whole Georgia.

 Unremarkable building on the outside but bright and colourful on the inside, worth a visit. Women and men use main entrance,
 must take shoes off, dress modestly and women need to cover their hair.

Other Sights
* Many famous writers, as well as the mother of Joseph Stalin, are buried here.

* Perhaps one of the most distinctive pleasures of walking through the Old City, with its old-style balconies, ancient churches, winding streets, and charming shops. Be prepared to see a number of eclectic sights, from the abandoned streetcar near Erekle Street to the art galleries of Chardini Street to the stunning modern art lining Sioni Street. Sub-neighborhoods include Sololaki, with its elegant restaurants and art nouveau architecture, Old Tbilisi proper - with sites ranging from churches to mosques to sulfur baths, Betelmi - housing two of the city's oldest churches and the stunning vistas of the Narikala Fortress - and Mtsasminda, just up the mountain from Rustaveli Avenues, a more sedate, "livable" district filled with charming old houses and a number of families.

* Located around Chavchavadze and Abashidze avenues, this is one of Tbilisi's posher districts, home to many expats and nouveaux riches. While not quite as atmospheric as Old Tbilisi, Vake is home to some lovely parks, pleasant nineteenth-century architecture, and some of the city's most high-end shopping, including luxe furniture store Missioni. There are also plenty of elegant, if understated, bars and restaurants in this area...In Vake there are two buildings of Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi state university. The university is founded by Ivane Javakhishvili in 1918 and is one of the historical buildings in Tbilisi.

* Tbilisi city take metro to Ghrmaghele (0.5 GEL), from there cross the market into Mukhrani St. You'll pass a church after the market, uphill. At the roundabout, turn left untill you see the monument. From there you can swim at Tbilisi lake afterwards. Google maps will show you the way, it is near to Caucasus International University. Stunning big stone architecture to present the chronicles of Georgia, written in Georgian. Can be a good hiking place and see the sea from the Top of hill.

Do
* The bath district is called Abanotubani and is on the south side of the Metekhi bridge. It is easy to spot with its small domes on ground level. There are several small baths offering different levels of comfort. The baths are relatively small, and you may have to wait for a pool to become available. English service is not guaranteed. Massages are available; however, they are more like a washing, but well worth it for the experience. You should bring your own towel and beach sandals (available for a small fee). Some travelers have suggested the Royal Baths is a much better alternative to Sulfur Baths (they are next to each other). Sulfur baths tends to double the price at the end of the massage and bath in spite of your original agreed price. Public bath at Bath N5, 3 GEL (July 2017)
Also in other districts you can find sulphur baths. For example in the Kiev-ulica, A bit south east of metro station Marjanishvili, around the corner of hostel Green Stairs, there is an old, characteristic bath. In the evening you can get a private bath for 10 lari (although they call them roubles) and an additional towel is 2 GEL.

* 
*This lake is located in the hilly outskirts of Tbilisi. A popular weekend getaway for families, the lake offers pedal-boat rentals as well as swimming (deckchairs optional) for reasonable prices (swimming entry, without deckchair, is about 3 Lari). Allright for a hot summer day, and offering views of both the mountains and the city below. Snackbars, restaurants and fruit cocktail shakers are available overlooking the lake. It's about an hour's pleasant walk from the Saburtalo district along country roads, passing the Ethnographical Museum, or a ten-to-fifteen minute (5-10 lari) cab ride from the center. While the lake itself isn't particularly nice, the views from the hike up to the lake makes it a worthwhile excursion.
* Much further out than Turtle Lake (a cab will set you back about 10-15 lari each way), minibus 137 from Liberty Square leaves you 200m from the lake, or bus 29 from Tarin Station. Possible to walk but long (8-9km from center), and not very nice views. Lake Lisi is much larger and more remote, with long, winding mountain and walks and bike lane surrounding the lake. Possible to swim and rent bicicles. Be warned - there aren't always taxis waiting to take you back...
*The crumbling ruins of this once-great fortress, standing alongside the Upper Betelmi Churches and the stunning Botanical gardens, offer panoramic views of the city below. But be warned - it's quite a steep climb - and while the lack of bureaucracy and guard-rails can be liberating for some, you may want to pay extra care to watch your step. Now, the best way to visit is by aerial tramway, a exciting experience with stunning views of the city, only for 1 Lari. And you can enjoy the way down walking to the mosque and the baths. The usual metro card can be used. There is a working church at the courtyard of the Fortress. Nice hike from the fortress to Mtatsminda Park -see next section.
*National botanic garden of Georgia, lying in the Tsavkisis-Tskali Gorge near Narikala Fortres, has not only collection of plants, but is also a lovely park with with scenic waterfall which is great for a dip on a hot summers' day, although you need to avoid the guards.
*Take the bus up to the park to have fun with your kids, or to take a ride in the Ferris wheel. The ride is 2 Lari, and you need to buy a rechargeable access card at a cashiers desk for 2 lari (one card can be used by many persons). Alternatively, use the funicular for 8 Lari, which has to be loaded onto the park access card (Metromani card not valid). There's also a roller coaster (one ride - 5 lari, minimum of 4 persons) which offers not only some adrenaline but great views on a sunny day. There is also a nice path (paved but steep, with benches, views and fitness circuit) going from Mamadaviti Church to Narikala Fortress, passing through Mtatsminda Park, Sololaki Spring, a rich man's house, the Lady of Georgia and the cable to Rike. It is easy to walk from the bath's district to Narikala -take the road leading to the mosque and ending at the botanical garden. Just before the garden, there is a small lane to the right along the wall. Also easy (though extremely steep) to walk from Rustaveli Avenue to Mamadaviti St - from Liberty Square to Rustaveli Av. turn left into Besiki St (signaled in Jul 2017) and follow it uphill onto Mtatsminda Street. Continue uphill. 
* Paragliding with instructor one hour drive from city. WhatsApp bookings.
*Rope park.

Buy
The Saturday flea market ("Dry Bridge Market") by the river (on the "Dry Overpass" and surrounding areas) is one of the best places to get jewellery, antiques and even antiques swords, as well as musical instruments and electronics. Haggling is encouraged, although if you speak little Georgian or Russian you may experience the odd juxtaposition of bargaining for antiques using the keypad of your vendor's mobile phone. 
Find Nana - the kind hearted old seller of the Dry Bridge Market (everybody knows her, just ask). This is if you want to have a real georgian experience in the market, with a few interesting stories, local sweetest tangerines as gifts for a stranger from far away (meaning you) and an honest georgian smile.
This market is also active on other days of the week, albeit on a smaller scale.

Main Market - fun to peruse, or to buy excellent fruits and vegetables. There is a bus stop right in front of the market coming from the center, Dry Bridge Market, or Vake; however, to go back to the center, Dry Bridge Market, or Vake you will need to walk one block in either direction to catch the bus back. Google Maps has accurate bus routes to the market.

* Gold, Silver, Precious Stones, and Other Jewellery - Many people visit Georgia to buy jewellery, because of its cheap cost and superior quality. 

* Art & Paintings – Georgian artists, such as Pirosmani, Gigo Gabashvili, David Kakabadze, Lado Gudiashvili, Korneli Sanadze, Elene Akhvlediani, Sergo Kobuladze, Simon Virsaladze, Ekaterine Baghdavadze, Maka Kiknadze-Kipiani and others, are famous for their work. In Georgia you will find many various art shops, paintings and painters who sell their works on the streets, including during the Saturday antique market. Their work is amazing and prices are reasonable . 

* Tiflis Avenue art centre THIS PLACE DON'T EXIST ANYMORE offers artworks by a variety of Georgian artists working in different media. It keeps an online gallery with the largest selection of art in Georgia. Tiflis Avenue keeps a physical gallery in an old town, on King Erekle II Street, where it regularly handles solo and group exhibitions by young or established artists. Open Tuesday-Sunday 12noon-9pm. The quality of art is outstanding and the prices reasonable.

* Antiques & Other Misc. Gifts – in Georgia you will able to find many antiques not only from Georgia, but Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, Russian and European as well. 

* Georgian Wine - Georgia is the cradle of wine making, and with 521 original varieties of grape you will be sure to find excellent wines.

* Cognac - Georgian cognac is unique as it's made from Georgian wine.

* Mineral Waters - Try Borjomi, Sairme, Nabeghlavi mineral waters from famouse Georgian resort places.

* Carpets - Outside the cities, you might find an original hand-made carpet for sale.

* Chacha - Grape vodka, a Georgian version of Everclear, quite similar to Italian grappa and Iranian Aragh.
*Second only to Prospero's Bookstore as an expat paradise, Goodwill offers an enormous range of products - mostly groceries, although the larger out-of-town branch stocks a wider supply - imported from the rest of Europe. From German tuna fish to Italian pasta, Goodwill will satisfy all your brand cravings, albeit for significantly more than you'd pay at home.
*Brand new (and not quite finished) is Tbilisi's first and only Western style shopping centre. It is located way out past the suburbs on the way to Mtskheta - take bus 121 from outside Didube station, minibus 51 (which passes through Saburtalo, Heroes Sq., etc), or a taxi for up to 10 lari. Currently there are three floors but only the ground floor is really "open". The middle floor has just a few shops and lots of vacant ones. The top floor is totally empty save for one shop. The mall has potential once more shops open up. At the moment there's Zara and its cousins Pull & Bear, Bershka, Stradivarius; Topshop, Marks & Spencer, Superdry, Gap, etc. Signs indicate several upcoming tenants including new-to-Georgia American food chains Popeye's Chicken, Burger King and Villa Pizza. At the moment there's no restaurants apart from a little café. However, the real saving grace is the giant Carrefour, hands down the best supermarket in the country. It's absolutely massive, very good quality, and low, low prices. It even maintains a local flavour, including a real Georgian bread kiln with especially good hot and fresh shoti puri for just 70 tetri.
*Another good supermarket along the lines of Goodwill (and also seemingly German owned) but located nearer the old town on Rustaveli Ave (near the Radisson and next door to the new Wendy's burger joint). There's also a small café inside where you can get pastries and khachapuri.
*A wine shop with lots of choices of red and white wine, as well as chacha. It has a ground floor and a basement. In the basement there are 14 types of inexpensive, mostly red wine stored in giant barrels. The cheapest one is 3 GEL for a liter (as of April 2017). Try the semi-sweet red wine for 8 GEL a liter. Sold in plastic bottles. 
*A well-stocked supermarket with multiple locations around the city. Offers 50% discount on hot dish after 20.00. 

Eat

* Khinkhali - Georgian dumpling filled with either meat, potatoes, mushrooms, etc. Do not eat the doughy pinched part (it's seen as very rude and cheap), but do use it to hold up the khinkali whilst you eat from the bottom (and be sure to catch all the gravy from the meat khinkali). The pinched part is also used to keep count of how many khinkhali are eaten by each person.
* Pkhali - Vegetable paste topped with pomegranate seeds
* Khachapuri - Georgian circular bread often filled with cheese.
* Mtsvadi - grilled skewered meat.
* Kababi - chopped and seasoned meat which is grilled on a skewer. Often served wrapped in a thin flat bread in Georgia.

Budget

*Georgian/European buffet to choose from. Good quality food: fresh vegetable salads, lean meat and fish. Prices depend on quantity and what you choose. They weigh the food in front of you. An average of 6 GEL for a meal with two kinds of salads, meat and fried potatoes. A very good deal.

*Hostel 48a - Near Marjanshvili metro station. The owner is a very hospitale woman.

Medium range

Georgian cuisine

* . 
Cosy nice cafe located in sololaki , serving georgian dishes with friendly enviroment and peple. Where you can go sit and enjoy delicious food and drinks. 

* . Don't be put off by the unfriendliness of the staff, the place is worth a visit. You can try many different flavours of the traditional Lagizde Water and accompany it with a Khachapuri. Small portions are enough for a dinner.

* Live traditional Georgian music and singing starts at around 6 PM every day, although it's also the perfect place for a quiet post-flea market weekend lunch. Stunning river-views and faux-rural atmosphere - enormous portions at relatively reasonable prices. Credit cards accepted.

* Delicious food cheaper than in the restaurants surrounding it. Khinkali are around .50 GEL each.

* Formerly the trendy "Sans Souci," this artsy eatery (owned by master puppeteer Gabriadze himself) has reopened after a lengthy renovation period. With a quirkily bohemian decor and inventive takeoffs of classic Georgian dishes (just try their lobio!), the food here is a cut above the standard khachapuri-and-khinkhali dinner options. 

* Excellent local cuisine. Smoky (like most), with a few TVs, but the staff are friendly (with a smattering of English and an English menu), with easily the best-cooked and tastiest lamb and other typical georgian dishes. Live low-key jazz some nights, not too obtrusive or loud. Moderately priced. 

* Hip cafe/restaurant with live Jazz most evenings. Seemingly twinned with its far cheaper neighbor KGBs. Wi-Fi; Credit card payment accepted. Food seems to have gone downhill in recent months, however, and is increasingly overpriced for the quality.

* With the tagline "we're still watching you," this painfully hip piece of Soviet Kitsch wouldn't be out of place in Williamsburg. Menu offerings include "Proletariat pizza" and meals advertised as "Lenin's favorite dish." The bill comes in vintage Soviet working papers. Much cheaper than Kala.

* All Khinkali, all the time.

* Best restaurant chain specialising in Georgian pastries, with 10 locations in Tbilisi. 'Khachapuri'-traditional Georgian cheese pie, baked in wood-fired oven. Credit cards accepted.

* Ethnographic restaurant. Evenings Georgian music and dances. WiFi available.

* Good Georgian food, locally brewed beer, traditional barbeque, live music and outdoor seating. Four locations in Tblisi.

* Amazing menu & food, superb customer service and great design.

* A travel-themed "literary cafe" with East-meets-West decor, a menu that fuses Georgian classics with Middle Eastern treats, and a selection of travel books on the shelves. Free wifi.

* Sporting the most stunning views in Tbilisi, the terrace at Cafe Flowers (so named for the gorgeous flora that adorn the terrace and adjacent garden) overlooks the Old Town from across the river. Food is generally good, although be wary of dairy-based dishes lest you come down with "Saakashvili's Revenge" .

* Run by three friendly women, this tiny take-away place serves a wide variety of delicious home-style salads, in addition to a good selection of khatchapuri, at good prices. Specialises in "guruli" khatchapuri, a style served with boiled egg inside that is most commonly made during the holidays. If you're looking for a cheap, quick lunch but want to try something besides khatchapuri and lobiani, this is the place to visit. No English, but you can see and point to everything.

Asian Cuisine

* Central Asian Cuisine: Uzbek Pilaf, Uygur Laghman, great soups.

* 

* Pricey but delicious fusion-Asian cuisine served in a decadently authentic atmosphere 

* 

* Sushi + night club + Middle Eastern atmosphere, 4 floors.

* A bit pricey but dependable sushi. Service is usually nice. Same menu and management as Tokyo Restaurant.

* Japanese Restaurant
*This is the most authentic Thai restaurant in the city, and a favorite of local expats. Operated by a friendly Thai woman, it has good food and quick service, but it's easy to miss because it's on an unremarkable street between the Opera house and Radisson hotel.

European/American

* A small, one of a kind art-cafe, with pleasant music and delicious cuisine, in a quiet old neighborhood in the heart of Tbilisi. A perfect venue for spending your evening, in a warm and comfortable atmosphere. Every evening you can attend our highly enjoyable events both for Georgian and English speakers.

* Famous for it's tasty salads and crepes. Nice place to spend time with friends. Outdoor garden seating.

* Reasonably priced, charming bistro with fusion French-Georgian cuisine and a neighborhood-y atmosphere. Definitely a brunch place for Vake's "smart set." The khachapuri is out-of-this-world.

* Great pepper steaks, soups and bread rolls. Currently closed down - perhaps permanently.

* American bar/restaurant. Live music every night from 20:30. Great breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

Stay safe
Tbilisi is very safe after the Rose Revolution. The police system was reformed completely and the recent polls show that public's trust in police shifted from nearly 10% to 88%. The police are usually quick to respond, though usually only Georgian and Russian are spoken.

While walking is generally fine, even for solo women, it makes sense to take a bus or taxi home at night. Use common sense and big-city awareness. Night time at the clubs and bars is safe, and taxi service is safe as long as it's a company taxi like "009" or others. The public bus is also a good, safe option for 0.50 lari.

*Police Tel: 112.
*Ambulance tel: 112.

Contact

There are 3 GSM operators of mobile phone service:

* Magticom: provides 3G, 4G and 4.5G, covers more than 90% of populated regions of Georgia. There are different tariffs and packages. SIM card can be purchased directly at Tbilisi International Airport
* Geocell: provides 3G and 4G, covers all of Georgia, packet data deals available for prepaid. 2 GEL for the SIM, 10 GEL for 1 GB of data. There is a Geocell office in the Marjanishvili metro station.
* Beeline: russian company, the cheapest of all sim cards, but does not get the best reception in some areas. buy a sim card at the office on Rustaveli Avenue or Ortachala international bus station (help-line number for Beeline mobile: 110101 from Georgia).

Cope
You should make a quick stop in the Tourism Office on the south side of Freedom Square upon arriving in Tbilisi. They provide a free, very detailed map of the city as well as varying levels of competency when it comes to information; they are often out of printed material, and it can take some time to extract maps, brochures, etc, as they keep most of these hidden behind the counter and are often oddly reluctant to part with them, though if you're politely persistent you may be able to get what you need. They can print out a list of hostels or hotels upon request. They can also give you an English to Georgian vocabulary sheet with all the rudimentary words as well as the Georgian alphabet.

Stop by the Marriott Courtyard if you're lost - the staff are fairly fluent in English, and they are more than happy to provide you with free maps, and help you track down whatever you're looking for on a map before you leave. 

Be careful about renting DVDs from Prospero's bookstore - there is quite a selection, but as most of them are pirated, almost half of all their DVD stock is of a poor quality. For your peace of mind, you can check any DVD on a player in the cafe before you rent it.

Warning - there is at least one taxi driver waiting at the airport who insists on using a meter which results in a bill of around 90 GEL to get into Tbilisi.
