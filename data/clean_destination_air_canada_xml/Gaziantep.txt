Gaziantep, or informally known as Antep, is a city in Turkey.

Understand
Gaziantep, previously and still informally called Antep, is a city in southeast Turkey and among the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. The city is located 185 kilometers (115 mi) northeast of Adana and 97 kilometers (60 mi) north of Aleppo, Syria. It is the sixth most populous city in Turkey. Apart from being renowned for its cuisine, Gaziantep is also an industrial city having the third biggest industry in Turkey, which makes it vulnerable to migration from other cities, especially the East.

By train
Passenger trains no longer run to Gaziantep. The railway lines to for Istanbul and Ankara, to Mosul in Iraq, and to Aleppo in Syria, are all closed indefinitely.

By bus
The coach station "otogar" in Gaziantep is one of the most convenient stations in Turkey. It is well-integrated with most of the cities in the West and the East. The local coach companies, "Seç Turizm, Ben Turizm and Çayırağası" provide excellent service with punctual arrivals. As a common Turkish tradition, you might expect 5 to 10 minutes delays on departure, yet the drivers compensate for it on the highway. From Istanbul, it usually takes 15 hours by express overnight buses. From Ankara, it takes 9 hours and from Izmir, it is 16 hours. But don't worry, Turkey has surprisingly perfect motorways and comfortable coaches with beverage offerings that will make your journey safe and relaxed.

Get around

The city center is reasonably compact and walkable. There are plenty of local buses if you prefer and of course taxis for tired feet.
