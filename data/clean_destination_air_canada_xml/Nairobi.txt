Nairobi is the capital of and the largest city in the country.

Understand
Nairobi has a population of three million plus. Situated on the Nairobi River, the city is not only the largest and fastest growing city in Kenya, but one of the largest in Africa.

History
The word Nairobi derives from a water hole known in Maasai (an Eastern Nilotic language) as Enkare Nyirobi, which means "cool waters." Nairobi, which was a swamp area, was founded in 1899 and was first a railway camp for the Uganda Railway. The city became Kenya’s capital, which was initially, and it also became the capital of the British East Africa Protectorate in 1905. With the spread of plagues in the early 1900s, the town was burnt down and had to be rebuilt. Having a railroad system in the system helped it to have drastic growth, becoming the second-largest city in Kenya behind Mombasa. 

The city of Nairobi also grew due to administration and tourism businesses (mostly big game hunting). The British, who colonized Kenya, set up shop in Nairobi, leading to the creation of big hotels primarily for the British hunters. Also, Nairobi has an East Indian community from those who are the descendants of original colonial railway labourers and merchants.

Get in

Citizens from most countries will have to obtain a E-visa to enter kenya. Currently, this costs US$51 for a single-entry visa and $101 for a multiple-entry visa. 

For more information, see the article. If you are only traveling through the country via a connecting flight and will not leave the secure area of the airport you will not need a visa.

The yellow fever vaccination is no longer required if you're coming from EU, Asia or North America. However, a vaccination certificate might be required if you're coming from a country where yellow flu is endemic.

By plane

Regular flights to Nairobi are operated by Ethiopian, Kenya Airways, British Airways, Egypt Air, Etihad Airways, Emirates, KLM, Qatar Airways, Swiss International Airlines and Turkish Airlines. Kenya Airways is the national airline and travels throughout Europe, Africa, and the Asia-Pacific region. Nairobi’s main airport is JKIA Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (), southeast of the city centre.

If taking a taxi from JKIA, use a reputable taxi; many are waiting outside to give you conveyance, and the cost should be very near 1,500KSh to the city center; Westlands (car with chauffeur KES2,000 - Sept 2022) or such places more west or north will be more. When taking a taxi to your accommodation, avoid being talked into taking their recommendation for accommodation, although this is very at your own risk. There is also Wilson Airport, south of the city's center, for domestic flights. Lighter, Cessna-type aircraft can be seen there. The military/government airport is in Eastleigh district (pron: "East-Lee"), a very large residential area of housing in the east/north-east of Nairobi, but the government airport is fenced around and does not handle civilian traffic. Also, Uber works very well in Nairobi. Consider that during rush-hour it can easily take up to two hours from JKIA to the city center, while at night the same trip might take 15 minutes only.

To and From the center, you can take Bus #34 for 100KSH to the international airport from the Ambassador Hotel.

By train

The city is also accessible by train from Mombasa, with three departures daily in each direction. The actual schedule is available at The new connection is much faster (about 4.5h), but the railway station in Mombasa is not in the city center anymore, but about 10 km outside Mombasa. You can buy tickets online, at the train station or under the local number 0709388888. The first class costs 3.000 KSH, second class 1.000 KSH, which is cheaper than the buses. Therefore you should book as early as possible (up to 60 days in advance) in high and holiday seasons.

By bus

Kenya’s bus system is mostly reliable. There are many bus companies that have routes going to and from the country’s different cities, including Nairobi, the center of the bus network.

By matatu

Matatus (14-18 seater minibuses) and shuttles (6-seater cars) are convenient, inexpensive (and often the only) modes of public transport connecting Nairobi to towns and tourist destinations in the Rift Valley and Central Highlands such as Naivasha, Nyeri, Nanyuki, Isiolo, and Thika. Matatus can be obtained from the River Road area. 

Exercise extreme caution in this area: petty theft is a major concern, and valuables such as mobile phones and wallets should not be prominently displayed here, particularly after dark and even while in the matatu (see safety section below). The best method of connecting to a matatu is to arrange for a taxi to drop you off and pick you up directly at the location of the matatu that you are boarding or alighting from. If you're boarding a matatu from Nairobi, tell the taxi driver your destination and they will drop you off at the correct location. If you are being picked up, then tell the taxi driver the location you're coming from as well as the matatu company that you are using (your ticket should have the operator's name). It is best to arrange for a taxi from the hotel you're staying at. Matatu prices can cost anything from 300 KSh (matatu to Naivasha) to 450 Ksh (shuttle to Nanyuki). The price is dependent on the distance of travel.

By boat

Entry into Nairobi by boat is not possible, but one could certainly arrive in Kenya by boat via Mombasa or Lamu, and proceed by road, air, or rail to Nairobi.

Get around
Nairobi has notoriously bad traffic and at rush hours (7-9am, 4.30-6.30pm) much of the city grinds to a halt. Just about every bad driving habit is practiced, in particular by matatus and buses. Be careful getting around Nairobi if you have an appointment to make, traffic is very bad like any other major city, but if you use common sense and a local or guide, you should be able to get where you want.

If self-driving a GPS is a good idea, essential even, given the lack of road signs. However GPS's can tempt you to take backroad shortcuts when stuck in traffic that turn out to be dead-ends. As a general rule don't take a short cut if no one else is trying the same thing.

By taxi
Due to the danger of hiring taxis off the street and the high prices of corporate taxis, most taxis users in Nairobi develop long-term relationships with a few trusted taxi drivers who are based around their home and office. They'll call them for everything and if he's not available, he'll send one of his trusted colleagues serve them. The challenge is what to do if you don't have a trusted taxi or know who to ask. 

Taxis are not very cheap, but will make city life easier and safer, at least at night. Always set and agree on prices before the trip, and pay afterwards. You can find taxis parked around hotels and tourist areas though they'll often charge exorbitant prices. The taxis tend to be marked with a yellow line on each side. You can also hire a taxi for the full day if you are making multiple stops either for business or tourism.

Taxi Apps including Bolt, Little, Uber, Nopea Ride and others are increasingly more popular in Nairobi. If you need to arrive somewhere very fast and Nairobi's notorious traffic is bad, you could also hire a boda boda (motorcycle taxi) for a fraction of the cost from most street corners although due to fear about motorcycle taxis, many people prefer to find boda boda through apps. 

Walking is not generally considered safe for foreigners in many parts of Nairobi but because of traffic jams, sometimes it's necessary. It could be best to walk if the destination is less than 3km away at some times. On average, it can take you one whole hour to reach a destination that's 4km away during congested periods.

By bus (matatu)
A matatu (public minibuses/commuter buses) is typically used for traveling between downtown Nairobi and the suburbs. Matatus vary in size, between the van sized 14 seat Matatus and the larger 50-seat buses. While generally safe, you should be aware that matatus are involved in a high number of accidents every year. Matatus are often overcrowded, with more people than seatbelts and therefore can be dangerous if involved in accidents. Because there are no licensing requirements, matatus are often poorly driven, with drivers passing on curbs, speeding, or passing in oncoming lanes while cars are oncoming.

On each bus is a conductor who will hang out of the matatu and call out a price (usually between 10ksh and 40ksh) and location the matatu is driving. Recently, the government has decided to ban the 14-seat matatus inside Nairobi, effective January 2011 in hopes of reducing traffic and accidents in town (which is actually not in effect since 2011-2013, that is until now). The best choice is probably the Double M Commuter Buses or the City Hoppa bus service and of late, the revived Kenya Bus Service. Beware of traffic jams on the large motorways, not only in the rush hours.

By foot

Walking around Nairobi is fairly easy since the city is small and places are easy to get to. However, there are some areas within the city where tourists should not go; minimise walking around at night. Thugs are rampant in many areas.

By Rental Car

Car hire from the airport is possible, and fairly painless with prices in line with other African countries. In the recent past, Nairobi had a severe car-jacking problem, but because of increased police check-points, it has become marginally safer. Travelling during the day reduces your chances of getting car-jacked, as most car-jacking occur after dark.

Many of the usual car hire chains have franchises in the city and several rental options are available, with the cheapest rentals starting from Kshs4,000 per day. You can hire cars with a driver(chauffeur-driven) or on self-drive basis. Most car hire companies offer saloon cars, 4x4s, Vans, Buses and Safari Vans and Jeeps. Local car hire firms are available often on a cash-in-advance basis. These operators are cheaper and more flexible than the international brands, but you risk greater levels of hassle in the event of an accident, theft or breakdown. Rates for local car hire start at around Khs3,500 per day for a saloon car. 

Central car hire is a reliable, trustworthy, and helpful rental company based in Nairobi. Two-wheel drive and four-wheel drive vehicles are available and are well-maintained.

Cyrus Car Hire, based at the Fairview Hotel, offers Corollas at Khs4,000 per day and a Rav4 at Khs5,000. Happy to pick up and drop off the car anywhere in town. 0722 705071.

Hire N' Drive Kenya Ltd.+254722417475 has a variety of vehicles and they can bring and pickup the car at your hotel, airport or at any shopping mall within the city. 

Nairobi Car Hire offers good services for 4x4 and other categories of cars. Starting at USD100 according to their website.

Offroad Car Hire specializes in off-road 4X4 vehicles and has prices for volunteers, missionaries and NGOs which are below the average car rental rates.

Nairobi is known as the safari capital of Africa, however the city has still managed to keep up with modernization. Unlike other cities, Nairobi is surrounded by 113 km² (70 mi²) of plains, cliffs and forest that makes up the city’s Nairobi National Park. The city is filled with many things to do during the day and the night. Tourists can have their pick from numerous safaris (wildlife, cultural, sport, adventure, scenic and specialist), ecotourism tours, restaurants, culture, shopping and entertainment. While in Nairobi, tourists can also engage in numerous sports from golf, rugby, athletics, polo, horse-racing, cricket and football (soccer).

*Nairobi National Park, just outside Nairobi. This is home to large herds of Zebra, Wildebeest, Buffalo, Giraffe, Lion, Cheetah, Hippo, Rhino and even birdlife (over 400 species). Here you can also go on the Nairobi Safari Walk, an educational centre to make people aware of wildlife and habitat conservation. Also in the park is the Nairobi Animal Orphanage.

*Sheldrick Elephant Orphanage, close to the Nairobi National Park. This Orphanage takes in elephant calves and rhinos from all over Kenya which were orphaned by poaching. Showing is only once per day from 11am-12pm (admission 500Ksh) and gives you a great opportunity to interact directly with baby elephants, though spaces are limited and usually fill in advance.

*Giraffe Centre, in Lang'ata right outside of Nairobi. The Centre breeds the endangered Rothschild Giraffe and has conservation/education programmes for Kenyan children. It also has many warthogs. Here you can feed giraffes by hand and even get a kiss (their tongues can get up to 20" long and are antiseptic). The staff are very attentive and can share a lot of information anywhere from broader information on wildlife and conservation efforts to information and personalities of the individual giraffes and even down to pro-tips on how to get the best photos with the giraffes, if you ask. Follow the rules on how to feed them - and watch your bowl of food pellets - the giraffes have long necks and aren't shy about reaching over to go straight for the bowl. 

*Mamba Village. Typically the 3rd stop for most tourists after the Elephant Orphanage and Giraffe Center, this pleasant park is home to ostriches and crocodiles. Surprisingly quite interesting as you get the chance to interact directly with crocodiles and even hold a baby, with very knowledgable employees serving as guides.

*Lake Naivasha. About 1.5hrs outside of central Nairobi, this area is a haven away from the chaos of the city where many 3rd and 4th generation British colonialists continue to reside. Crescent Island is a particularly nice place to visit, even if you have already done a safari. Unique because it gives you the opportunity to walk around the grounds literally alongside giraffes, zebras, wildebeest, impalas, etc.

*Ol Donyo Sabuk National Park, 65 km from Nairobi, is centred around a 2,146-m (7,141 ft) mountain. This is a mountain forest and plain land, with a large population of Buffalo. It also serves as a refuge for Colobus monkeys, bushbuck, duiker, leopard, and a large variety of bird species.

*14 Falls, a waterfall at Thika.

* The best place to get that far ranging view over the sprawling, congested metropolis that is Nairobi. You can go up to the saucer-shaped top of the conference centre's round viewing tower and depending on smog and fog, you might be able to see as far as the slums and the national park.

* In 1998 a blast rocked downtown Nairobi. A truck had exploded next to the US Embassy building, reducing it to rubble and killing 212 people some on staff, most bystanders.
On the same day, August 7, the US embassy in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, was also subject to a similar terrorist attack. 21 people have been charged with the crime, including Osama Bin Laden. The former embassy site today contains a memorial that can be visited.

*Tana River, is an hour's drive from the city. White water rafting throughout cataracts, which leads to the 14 falls can be done here. The rafting trip also includes a full BBQ lunch.

* Where visitors can learn about Kenya, its history and culture. The museum celebrated 100 years in 2010. A live snake compound is adjacent but not for the timid. Exhibits include numerous taxidermic wildlife, the history of modern Kenya, East African currency, and artifacts from across Kenya. The exhibition of hominid fossils is world class and houses the world's largest collection of fossils of human ancestors, including an 18-million-year-old skull from proconsul and skulls of Paranthropus aethiopicus, Homo erectus, Homo habilis dating from 1.75 million to 2.5 million years ago.

*National Railway Museum, visitors can learn more about the history of Kenya’s railroads and the Kenya/Uganda railway. It also houses, some of the engines and rolling stock from the country’s colonial period.

* This is a museum housing only special exhibits, so the featured artwork is always changing.

* is based on the Karen Blixen’s book "Out of Africa". Her house is now the home of the museum. It is on the outskirts of Nairobi and a taxi or bus can get you to the museum.
 
*Bomas of Kenya, portrays Kenya’s culture. Visitors can see exhibits of traditional Kenyan homes, artifacts, dances, music, and song.

*Uhuru Gardens, built in remembrance of the struggle for independence, which Kenya was granted in 1963. The monument is a 24-m (79 ft) high triumphal column supporting a pair of clasped hands and the dove of peace, high over a statue of freedom fighter raising the flag. The monument is surround by fountains and lush-landscaped gardens.

*Westlands by night, Visit the bustling and hip Westlands district, which has turned into the new nightlife center of Nairobi. Many restaurants and bars line the busy Woodvale Grove and Mpaka Road. A visit to 'Treehouse' club is good for those not willing to stray too far from their comfort zone, with an expat crowd rather than often overcrowded local clubs. Traffic can become hectic, well into the early hours. Security is generally tight and the action spills out from packed clubs into the street.

* While Jamia Mosque is tucked away in between other buildings there are striking views to be glimpsed of its intricate structure from many different angles. Easily the most impressive religious structure in the capital, access to the interior is not open to non-muslims

Do
*Safari in central Nairobi park.
*Try the many excellent restaurants in Nairobi.
*Go dancing and be a part of Nairobi's excellent nightlife
*Go ice skating at Panari

*Go to Maasai market and buy keepsakes for yourself and friends: On Saturday it is at Nairobi High Court parking lot, Village Market on Friday, The Junction on Thursday, Capital Centre on Wednesday. Prepare to haggle and as a guide, pay about half to two thirds of the asking price.
*Do something different: visit Kibera, the slums of Nairobi. Guided walks are arranged by Kiberatours.
* A former warehouse turned arts centre - this has also happened in Nairobi and this spot allows you to get a glimpse of what contemporary Kenyan artists are up to, including exhibitions, performances and discussions.
*Kazuri Beads shop - Started in 1977 the workshop of beads is adjacent to Karen Blixen's Museum. Was started by an English women to provide sustainable income to the poor Kenyan women. Has beautiful jewelry created of clay brought from the areas surrounding Mt. Kenya.
*Private and Group-Joining Safari. For those looking to go on a safari. You can do a budget group-joining or private tours.
*A Safari with Spirit of Kenya. This travel agency, for long established in Tanzania and Kenya, offers probably the best prices while not sacrificing quality. Part of their profits go to education for local children who have no access to it.
*Visit Oloo’s Children Center (OCC) in Kibera: Lend a hand at the volunteer operated school, take a tour of Kibera, and have a cup of tea with the OCC Founder. The founder of the school lives in Kibera and works to provide children in need with education and meals. 616-987-1106 
*Go on on of their sustainable safaris across Kenya, or volunteer with one of their partner organisations. They have fantastic options for both, and at a price that will suit every budget. Great guys, very professional. 

Buy
There are quite a number of networked banking machines in major shopping areas of Nairobi as well as the arrivals area of the airport. A Ecobank ATM can be found within the airport area, easily accessible when arriving. Most transactions are cash only, so it is best to have enough cash on hand to pay for purchases and transport. Major banks such as ECO Bank, Kenya Commercial Bank, and Equity Bank give better exchange rates than any of the FOREX bureaus. Independent machines such as Pesa-point have lower cash limits and may have a higher fee. Ecobank atms have no withdrawal fee for overseas atm cards in kenya.

Cash is dispensed in units of 1000/=. Note: Many smaller businesses do not have much change, so be sure to have a good selection of smaller notes before going shopping for curios.

Forex Bureaus are located in many parts of the city where tourists are common. They will exchange cash of different currencies, and may also accept a personal cheque for Kenyan cash. They will want a photocopy of your passport before they exchange money. Rates are not bad, but will be worse than a banking machine will offer. Be aware that many exchange bureaus and hotels will NOT accept or exchange American currency printed before 2000. When the exchange bureaus do accept pre-2000 notes, they typically offer substantially lower exchange rates than for curreny printed after 2000. Exchange rates are also typically lower for small denomination currency than for $100 and $50 bills.

Credit Cards Many specialty stores accept international credit cards, however they normally tell you up front that they will charge you bank fees, typically 5% of the purchase. The Carrefour supermarket chain would accept credit cards without a surcharge.

This may also be a good place to repeat the warning about safety: Pickpockets are rampant in Nairobi and have been known to keep an eye on people getting cash from a machine. It is best to carry cash in a hidden pouch rather than a wallet. Men: do not carry your wallet in your back pocket, and women: do not carry your purse to your side or behind you, particularly in busy locations.

The four primary supermarkets in Nairobi are Quick Mart, Naivas, Carrefour, Chandarana foodplus . For goods beyond supermarket fare, try Yaya Centre on Argwings Kodhek Road in the Kilimani area, The Junction on Ngong Road, or the Sarit Centre and Westgate which are both located in the Westlands suburb. there is also Garden city mall.

The Sarit Centre will be recognizable to any Western traveller as a shopping mall, with an Carrefour supermarket inside. Clothing, shipping, and Internet are all available here. In addition, there is a small movie theater. Other malls in Nairobi include Yaya Centre near Hurlingham and The Mall in Westlands.

Westgate is a competitor to Sarit Centre. It is a large shopping mall with many stores. the primary occupant is the many shops which has modeled itself to emulate a Super Wal-Mart type experience. Any taxi driver will know these two shopping centers by name, so getting there is not a problem. 

An additional smaller supermarket, catering more to expatriates, is in ABC Plaza, along Waiyaki Way. Chandarana supermarket carries a wide variety of imported goods, Zucchini greengrocer is a highly dependable spot for clean and varied veggies, and Gilani's is a well stocked western style butchery. 

For local curios and souvenirs, the most easily accessible and tourist-friendly is the Maasai Market, held on Fridays at the Village Market, an upscale, open concept shopping center near the United Nations and American Embassy complexes. is necessary, and one should probably not spend more than 1000KSh on one item, except in extraordinary circumstances. For the uninitiated, sales tactics are always friendly but very aggressive compared to most countries. Vendors will call you in and shout after you - and sometimes quote you very high prices. Be ready to give friendly but firm no thank yous or to just keep walking. But also don't be afraid to ask for prices and say you'll come back. You'll often be able to get a better gauge on prices and an idea of what's fair. Visible foreigners will pay higher prices than locals - but the markets do include vendors who will quote foreigners prices far beyond reasonable. Don't squabble over the equivalent of two dollar differences too hard, but also don't let yourself get scammed. The Village Market location tends to be more upscale and includes less aggressive sales tactics, but expect to pay higher prices. The iteration near the Court House tends to be much more local, which can mean lower prices and sometimes higher quality and less 'tourist knick-knacks' options, but also means visible foreigners will be more targeted. The Masai Market is also held on Thursdays at the parking lot of the Junction Shopping Center and Tuesdays at the parking lot of the Westgate shopping center. Bargain hard, and do not let that deter you from speaking with many of the friendly shopkeepers who are apt to offer gifts with no other incentives - the gifts are not always a scam, but shouldn't be taken too lightly. It's not uncommon to strike up truly friendly conversation with vendors who will offer you a small gift in an effort to get you to come back. 

For slightly better prices, visit the Tuesday market in town, just down from the Norfolk hotel. This market is less secure, but is larger and offers more variety and opportunity for bargaining.

Ngong Racecourse (Horse Flat-Racing takes place 3 Sundays a month, and is a great way to spend an afternoon). The Junction shopping complex features a few more boutiques - one of note being Zebu, a store highlighting local Designer Annabelle Thom's leather bags and more, where you will find higher quality and higher prices for beautiful designs.

Biashara Street, located downtown, is the spot for textiles - though most of these have now become more practical clothing shops, especially children's clothes and uniforms. Make sure you pick up at least one kikoi or kikoy (a traditional wrap for Swahili men, predominantly at the coast). Haria's Stamp Shop (been around for more than 70 years!) (www.hariastamp.com) has one of the best selections of kikoy as well as other african fabrics and souvenirs.

Stay safe

Nairobi has a reputation for thievery. Beware of snatch and grab, con artists, or groups of people following you. Scams are elaborate and can involve up to 10 or more people working together. The best advice for a tourist is to stay in the city centre, know where you are at all times, and pretend you know where you're going (even if you don't). If you find yourself in an unfamiliar area your best bet is to find a taxi (although you will probably pay dearly if the driver suspects a panicked foreigner!). Don't carry large quantities of money or passports on the street, and assume that anyone trying to engage you is up to no good or trying to sell you something. In recent years, crime has significantly reduced, though one should still be wary. If one stays smart and plays safe, without going around much after dark, Nairobi is a safe place to stay. Most locals are honest people who will happily help you if you approach them.

Kenyans are proud people and there is not a lot of begging like you find in some other countries. Some opportunistic people will hang around shopping centres and beg, but they will generally accept a simple 'sorry' and leave you alone if you do not give. Many of these 'beggars' are middle class kids or adults who have realised they can profit from exploiting foreigners, and should not be encouraged. If you are ever lucky enough to visit a slum as a local (not on some perverse tourist safari) you will discover the poorest of the poor do not even beg.

Outside of tourist and expat communities, young children will become excited at the sight of foreigners. If you are fair-skinned, children may run towards you to try to shake your hand, or yell "mzungu" (white person) or "how are you?". Older kids are more reserved, and you should be wary of kids who are older than 9 or 10 who are trying to distract or get close to you.

Slums should be avoided by tourists as you will attract a lot of attention which can quickly turn into a dangerous situation. 

Apart from the inner city centre, Nairobi dies out at night. Streets are mostly empty. Do not walk alone after nightfall. Always use taxis. The areas north and east of River Road should be avoided, especially if you're not a local!

Biashara Street is a safe shopping street due to the presence of 10-15 Maasai guards. A place to avoid as a tourist is the City Market; you could end up paying a much higher price than on Biashara Street and the smell from the meat/fish section of the market can be putrid. 

If you are in a matatu and moving slowly through traffic, particularly after dark, you should keep your window closed if your valuables are in reach to prevent people snatching them from the outside (there are thieves who walk through traffic looking for such opportunities). Mobile phones and wallets should be securely kept and not displayed prominently during calls or cash transactions in the River Road area, particularly after dark.

Eastleigh (known as 'little Mogadishu') is an area near the city centre that is decaying due to years of neglect by the government (including the police). It is predominantly populated by Somalian migrants and refugees,Tourists would be wise to avoid it at night.

There have been several grenade attacks in the city for which Al-Shabaab have claimed responsibility. These are likely to be ongoing while the Kenyan army has a presence in Somalia. They are random and often fatal, so one should be wary and report any suspicious behaviour. However, it isn't just Al-Shabaab with their terrorist attacks, there are also armed, local street gangs that are also prevalent in Nairobi and pose a serious threat so avoid them whenever possible, even on broad daylight.

Stay healthy
It is recommended that before tourists come to Nairobi, that they should be vaccinated well in advance (6 weeks) of their trip. The most common recommended vaccines for people traveling to Africa are Tetanus, Diphtheria, Polio, Typhoid, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, Yellow Fever, Rabies and Meningitis.

Food and beverages

Be careful with the food that you eat outside the more upscale establishments. Before eating, make sure that the food is freshly and thoroughly cooked and served hot. Also avoid seafood,apart from the upmarket restaurants and hotels, and make sure that your fruits and vegetables have been properly sterilized in clean water. The safest fruits to eat are bananas and papayas. 
Do not drink tap water or brush your teeth with it. Only use bottled or canned drinks (especially popular brands). Also, do not use ice as it may also be contaminated water, and remember that alcohol does not sterilize a drink. The general rule of thumb is, the more high end an establishment is, the greater the safety of the food and drink within.

Insects

In Africa you are going to be exposed to yellow fever, dengue fever, other viral diseases, sleeping sickness, filariasis and malaria, although none of these diseases are a concern in Nairobi itself. When insects are biting you should cover up and wear long-sleeved shirts and trousers, socks and pyjamas especially when night falls. It is best to use an insect repellent that contains DEET on your exposed skin and clothing. As for mosquito nets, it is best to use a permethrin-impregnated net along with an insecticide such a pyrethrum coils or an electric mosquito killer during the night. And remember to spray your hotel room every evening.

Heat & Sun

Make sure to drink plenty of fluids (not coffee, alcohol or strong tea) to avoid dehydration. The average temperature is around 25 C (maximum might reach 30 C) throughout the year. Try to avoid plenty of physical exertion and try to stay in the shade and keep cool as much as possible. Increase the amount of salt intake in your food and water. Also, apply a lot of high factor sunscreen, avoid direct sunlight, and try to wear a hat and shady clothing.

Contact
There are very many internet cafés around Nairobi, but connection speeds and computers are not always super fast, but still you will manage to open your email, probably even use a webcam or watch YouTube. Prices are usually at ranges from 0.5KSh/minute to 1KSh/minute, usually with a minimum fee of 5-20KSh. The more expensive internet cafés are rarely better and the best ones charge 1KSh/minute with discounts for using the internet for longer. Most of the good cafés are found in Norwich Union which has quite a number just opposite Hilton Hotel next to Nandos while the expensive ones are found in malls in Westlands. Although it may be more appropriate for tourists to use the ones in Westlands since they are usually less crowded and are more exclusive but not necessarily faster or better in terms of equipment.

Free wireless internet is available at Java House restaurants and Doorman's coffee shops in the city and malls. Some bars like Havana in Westlands also offer free wifi. The internet cafe in Sarit Centre also has wireless internet available at a good speed and a reasonable price.

Mobile Phones are ubiquitous in Kenya with fairly good coverage from all providers (Safaricom, Telkom and Airtel) that extends to most populated parts of the country. Safaricom has the best national coverage especially if you are using 3G data. The phone system is GSM 900 and 3G 2100 (Asian and European standard). Phones and SIM cards are available at many locations throughout Nairobi and the country including at the airport. Phone prices are very competitive and priced for average income Kenyans. A basic phone may be obtained new from an independent dealer for ~2000/=. A vast majority of people use pre-paid phones with scratch-card top-ups available at a huge number of merchants across the country. All phones are sold "unlocked" for use on any network. Much business is conducted via mobile phone, so possession of one for even a relatively short stay in the country can be beneficial. Rates are extremely affordable with in-country calls at around 3/= per minute. Overseas calls cost around 5/= per minute to the United States (~USD$0.06/minute) and 3/= per minute to India (~INR 1.80, USD 0.04) on the Airtel network. 

3G data service is available in most coverage areas on Safaricom and is of a fairly high standard. The other networks have 3G in major population areas and EDGE/GPRS everywhere else. If you have a smart phone you should buy a data pack (200mb, 500mb or 1.5gb) or your credit will go down very fast!.

Cope
Smoking is against the law out on the streets in the city center (the downtown grid area with numerous skyscrapers). There are certain smoking zones, and outside of the city center it becomes much easier to find locations where it is acceptable. However, a general rule be to not smoke along the side of any roads or streets with pedestrians and/or vehicles. Be observant and take your cues from other smokers - if there are no smokers or cigarette butts on the ground, it is likely a non-smoking location.

Get out
 is worth at least a day's visit and has enough to keep you occupied for two or three days. Lakeshore country clubs are a good place for lunch. You can take a boat ride on the lake to see hippos, go for a walk among zebra and giraffes on Crescent Island, ride thoroughbred horses among zebra, giraffes and wildebeest at the Sanctuary Farm, and ride bicycles among wildlife and dramatic scenery at National Park.

Further afield, Nakuru National Park deservedly warrants a 1-night stay for a late-afternoon and early-morning game drive.
