Akademgorodok
A visit to Akademgorodok, built in the 1950s as a mecca for academics but suffering from neglect in the post-Soviet years, is still pleasant as a day trip. This formerly elite institution is located about 30 KM south of the city and features several museums and nice, tree-lined streets. 

While you're in the area, you might also visit one of several nice beaches on the Ob Sea, the large body of water created by a dam on the Ob River. 

Also south of the city, about 2 km north of Akademgorodok, is the open-air West Siberian Rail Museum. There are about 90 historical trains and rail cars there.

Do

* Novosibirsk Regional Puppet Theater (over 70 years old in an interesting historic building)

* Novosibirsk Circus

* In winter residents build an ice town on the Ob River, and in summer you can go to the beach. 

* Many of the performances are famous works and it is interesting to see the Siberian interpretations. Recommended to purchase tickets in advance.

* Since there is plenty of snow in Siberia during the winter, going skiing or ice skating could be a lot of fun in Novosibirsk. There are a lot of ice arenas in the city. Some of them are free of charge, but those don't usually rent skates. The ones that rent skates may be not free of charge. One of the centrally located stadiums is "Spartak".

Buy

There are a lot of malls, shops, boutiques and stores in Novosibirsk. They offer a lot of goods from all round the world and you can have a great time while shopping. However, be careful when buying anything there - always check what you buy, before you pay. Sometimes the goods you buy may be produced not by a brand company but by a company in an Asian country that has a license for producing products under this brand name. Sometimes the quality of these goods doesn't correspond to the quality of the original brand. This may be especially applied to the European brands. For example, the same scents may have a different aroma in Novosibirsk and somewhere in Europe. It doesn't mean that the goods have bad quality and you shouldn't shop. But be careful if you want to purchase anything.
You could have a lot of fun if you go to markets like Central Market ("Центральный рынок") or "Baraholka". There you'll see people from around the world selling stuff that is not brand but it may have a good quality. Be careful there as well, as you may run into pocket pickers. You may even find some local food there and try some specials. There are a lot of different markets in the city but the most famous are Central Market and Baroholka. You may buy nothing there but what you see, you'll see nowhere in the world. It literally looks like an Asian market with only difference it's in the Russian way.

Stay Safe
While it's better to stay away from some run-down areas, things aren't that bad overall. Areas like Pervomayskiy Rayon, Kirovskiy Rayon, and distant neighbourhoods of Leninskiy Rayon should be avoided by foreigners as there is not much to do anyway. Those areas aren't dangerous, however. It's just that the outskirts of the cities tend to have much lighter policing, and so chances of something happening are higher.

The centre is obviously the safest place in the city. Night life is huge, even on weekdays, so you won't have any issues whatsoever, no matter the time of day.
