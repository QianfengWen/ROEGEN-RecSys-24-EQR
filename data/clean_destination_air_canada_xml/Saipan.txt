Understand 

Saipan is about 12 mi (19 km) long and 5.6 mi (9.0 km) wide, with a land area of 115.38 km2 (44.55 sq mi). The western side of the island is lined with sandy beaches and an offshore coral reef creates a large lagoon. The best beaches and most populated areas are on the western and southern coasts, with the north and east coasts being rugged and mountainous. 

One branch of the US military, the Coast Guard, has a small permanent presence on Saipan.

Many Chamorros on Saipan, and throughout the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands, speak Chamorro at home, although English is widely spoken as well.

Talk

Nearly everybody speaks English to varying degrees. Many local residents, who often use English at school or at work, speak Chamorro or Carolinian (both official in addition to English) or another of the Micronesian languages at home. The majority of people living on Saipan are overseas contract laborers. These people come mostly from the Philippines, China, Bangladesh, Thailand, Korea. Furthermore, Korean, Japanese and Chinese tourists make their languages fairly prevalent in the tourist areas as well.

Most hotels are geared toward a particular language/nationality such as Japanese or Korean, which represent most of the tourism. A notable exception is Pacific Islands Club, which is geared toward a multilingual/multinationial clientele. Likewise, most of the SCUBA shops are geared toward Japanese or Korean tourism.

Get in 

By plane

Saipan International Airport (SPN) is located in the southern part of the island. Direct flights are available from , , and the nearby islands of , , and .

U.S. travelers required passports and had to pass through CNMI Immigration and Customs, as Saipan and the CNMI were considered international locations until November 28,2009. On that date the CNMI Covenant required that the CNMI Federalization of Immigration law became effective. The CNMI remains under CNMI Customs laws.

The Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands
in Political Union with the United States of America defines the unique relationship between the Northern Mariana Islands and the United States, recognizing U.S. sovereignty but limiting, in some respects, applicability of federal law. The Covenant was negotiated over the course of twenty-seven months (December 1972 to February 1975) by the Marianas Political Status Commission (an organization representing the Northern Mariana Islands) and a delegation representing the United States. The proposed Covenant was signed by negotiators on February 15, 1975, at Saipan. The Covenant is codified at 48 U.S.C. § 1801 note, reprinted in the Northern Mariana Islands Commonwealth Code (with case annotations) and is also sold in pamphlet format by the Commonwealth Law Revision Commission. 

Pursuant to Section 1003(a), some Covenant provisions became effective on March 24, 1976, the date of final approval. Remaining provisions took effect on January 9, 1978, and November 4, 1986, the dates specified in Presidential proclamations issued pursuant to Section 1003(b)-(c). On the latter date, qualified residents of the Northern Mariana Islands became U.S. citizens. On June 29, 2009 U.S. Immigration Laws were to take effect, however, they were delayed until November 28, 2009.

U.S. Public Law 94-241, § 1, Mar. 24, 1976, 90 Stat. 263, the measure approving the Covenant, was originally reprinted in the U.S. Code in a note under 48 U.S.C. § 1681. In an official edition of the U.S. Code published in 1986, several provisions of the act were codified (as amended) as 48 U.S.C. §§ 1801-1805. (See also C-201 et seq.)

The Covenant is an agreement entered into between the United States government and the government and people of the Northern Mariana Islands. The parties entered into agreement as two separate but equal sovereign entities. The Covenant governs the relationship between the parties.

Get around 

There is no public transport as such, excluding shuttle buses running between hotels and the Duty Free shopping center in Garapan. Streets are named, but most buildings do not have numbered street addresses. Most locals navigate by landmarks.

By bus

There is no public bus service on Saipan, but on Saipan PDI and other companies run a shopping shuttle bus to and from the Duty Free mall (DFS Galleria) in Garapan. DFS also has their own free shuttle from most of the major hotels.

By car

 is a good option for getting off the beaten track, as roads are generally quite good. Most car rental offices are either at the airport or at major tourist hotels; some offer a free pick up and drop off service. If you plan to visit anywhere other than the most heavily-touristed areas, you'll want a vehicle with high clearance and four-wheel drive, as many of the back roads are unpaved and in poor condition.

By moped

Mopeds can be rented for about $25-$30, though roads are very dark at night and bugs predominate after dusk. Therefore, consider mopeds for day-tripping only, as drivers tend not to give heed to mopeds or bicyclists throughout the CNMI or . Mopeds are also a poor choice during the rainy season (June through November) as the roads get very slick and sudden downpours can occur without warning.

See

Saipan, Guam, and many other islands of the Marianas were all important battle sites during WWII, and many Japanese bunkers and armaments still exist on these islands. These sites are managed by the National Park Service under the "War in the Pacific" Parks designation. Saipan is fairly small and by renting a car or moped, it is easy to drive around the island and take in the natural splendor, as well as visit a number of parks. Scuba diving is also popular, and the underwater world should definitely be seen.

*Banzai Cliff and Suicide Cliff, on the northern tip of the island, were sites where thousands of Japanese civilians, trying to escape the fighting and convinced by the Japanese Army that they would be killed by the Americans, jumped to their deaths in the Battle of Saipan in 1944. The former is by the sea while the latter is on the rock outcropping overlooking it. Numerous Japanese memorials mark the sites.

Do 

 and snorkeling on Saipan are deservedly the most popular activities here among western tourists, though gambling and karaoke/hostess bars are most popular among Korean businessmen, as well as some Japanese travelers. Garapan is coastally located, so other watersports abound as well. For scuba divers, the term "Fun Dive" is used for those who have already been certified and just want to recreational dive, while "Taiken dive" is used to designate first-time divers that take classes on Saipan. The same is true for the rest of the CNMI and somewhat so for Guam. While boat dives are available, you can still drive to some awesome dive sights, like Grotto. A cavern dive to open ocean is great. If you go outside, you will need a guide as it is very easy to get turned around outside and lose track of the tunnel back in. The Grotto is still worth a visit for those without Scuba gear, but bring a swimsuit and a pair of goggles if at all possible.

You may also want to check out one or more of the 5 golf courses. Two were designed by Greg Norman, one by Larry Nelson and another by Graham Marsh. The other course is considered a "local" course. There is also a 9 hole course that is great for beginners.

Trekking and other land-based activities are available on the island. The Forbidden Island, originally occupied by evil spirits and now a bird sanctuary, can be reached by an hour's hike from the edge of the town of Kagman on the east coast. Take a snorkel kit to enjoy the diving area between the island and shore.
Old Man by the Sea is a 30 ft tall rock formation shaped remarkably like the head of an old man. The Rock rests on a secluded beach about a 20 min trek off the main road. Ask for directions, as there is no sign to mark the beginning of the path.
East Bay is how the locals refer to a cliffside with a series of successively higher jump points into some deep open water. Jump points are likely about 15 ft, 30 ft, and 50 ft above the sea. Follow the unpaved road past Laulau beach.

Most trekking activities will require a guide.

All beaches in Saipan are considered public park land, so feel free to wander into any resort and spend some time on their beaches. If you plan on swimming, do so when the tide is coming in, as it can suck the unwary out to sea when it recedes. Tide charts are available in the phone book.

There are other optional tours on Saipan that are available such as submarine tour which you can enjoy various marine life without getting wet, a Las Vegas magic show which contains dance and appearence of a white tiger, Polynesian dinner show with dynamic fire dance and great local foods, Sunset barbeque crusing which you can watch the sunset with a neerby island Managaha, and much more. There are also many types of massages and relaxation and some places available close to the beach.

Cope

Stay Healthy
Commonwealth Health Center (CHC) on the island of Saipan is the sole provider of comprehensive health care services and the primary health care facility (hospital) that provides a wide range of preventive (public health) and curative health services aimed at protecting and improving the health and quality of life for the people of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. It is the vision of CHC to deliver and provide our community with quality health care services and patient safety experience.

To contact Hospital Administrator, please call: (670) 234-8950 ext. 2904 or Direct Line: (670) 236-8247

Stay Safe
Visitors to Saipan are unlikely to be the victims of violent crime. However, drug addiction is a serious social problem, and addicts occasionally break into vehicles. Don't leave valuables in your car.

There still exist unexploded ordnances and landmines from World War II in the Mariana Islands. Because of this, it is advisable not to wander off-path when hiking, as these areas may have landmines (see for more information on this topic, including what to do if you find yourself in an area that may have mines).

Additionally, stray dogs are a hazard in Saipan. This is particularly the case if you are walking in a residential area. A surprising number of dogs may follow you around and bark at you viciously. If this happens, walk briskly away as safe as possible; if necessary, you may need to take another road, or even to escape.

Consulates

* 

* 

* Closed in 2013

Get out 
* Managaha Island. A small island sheltered in a lagoon, this is Saipan's best spot to snorkel. There are even some introductory scuba trails laid out in rope on the sea bed, which also make for great snorkeling sightseeing tours. You have to pay for the boat ride out, but it usually includes lunch. There are amenities out on the island. It takes about 15 minutes to walk completely around the island. It really is a great place to snorkel. Some snorkel and dive operators will offer rice or fish food to feed the fish, but this is unhealthy for both the reef and the fish and good tour operators will not do this. In addition, feeding the fish means that you will see a lot of the same kind of fish (often convict tangs), and miss out on many other colorful and interesting fish.
* Island is just three miles away across the Saipan Channel.
