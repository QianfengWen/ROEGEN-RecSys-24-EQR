By train

Just come out the front and they will usher you into the next bus and for 3 yuan drop you opposite the Silk Road Hotel in town on the edge of the market. There is also a ticket agent in town, near the mosque which sells tickets for most trains. You can always get the bus back to the railway station to buy your ticket if you are heading to the Caves as the Caves entrance is a walk from the station.

The Dunhuang train station is pretty quiet as mentioned it is the end of a branch line and most trains stop at Liuyuan (柳园), a couple of hours away from the city. From Liuyuan station, small buses leave to Dunhuang for 35Yuan. There are no set times for these buses as they leave when fully seated. If leaving in the morning, it is advisable to arrive at the station slightly before 10am, as many people will arrive at the station around this time so waiting time for the bus to leave will be short.

Get around

See

* A filled with exquisite Buddhist art and manuscripts. Although the city had an early connection with Buddhism due to the passage of monks traveling the Silk Road, it was not until a monk had a vision of a thousand Buddhas above the desert at Dunhuang in 4th century that the famous caves were excavated and filled with the manuscripts and treasures.The tour takes about two hours and 12 caves will be visited , all the rest are closed. The tours are different from group to group with every group visiting the main caves. The number of visitors is limited to 6000 a day and advanced booking needed in peak seasons. You can arrange to visit closed caves, It will cost you &yen;200 per person and per cave. Note that It can be handy to bring your torch. Worth a visit even if you don't pay the steep entrance fee and tour the caves, as the museum is free to enter and contains replicas of several caves, and there are a few small temples you can easily hike to in the nearby hills. For information, during the cultural revolution the Buddha and some painting was destroyed. Main painting of the cave was restored around 1995. Well, restored, but restored! As of Jan 2014, the 35 meter tall Buddha statue is again open to the public after a lengthy restoration.

* Worth a trip. If you're not interested in seeing the lake from up close and just want to walk among the dunes just follow the fence to the right from Charlie Jongh's Dune Guesthouse. After a couple of minutes you will find an open gate and a path leading up to the dunes. From the top of the one on the left, you can see the lake. June 2017 update: there is now no open gate within a 20 minute walk of the guesthouse. Numerous security cameras have been installed along the fence and you will have to sneak through a private farm which contains a loud dog before reaching an area of thick vegetation. Not recommended. June 2018 update: East of the park about 2 km there's a cemetery. From there you can circumvent the fence and access the dunes. To get there, work your way back through the farm fields. I biked to the base of the dunes then hiked up. It was hard, but free & the views were stunning. 

* It consist of a small forest of rare poplar trees (Populus Divesifolia). Some are more than 600 years old. Can give an opportunity for a walk far from town.

The statue through about 5 meters high, very graceful indeed, plump body, dance a benevolent and kind countenance, focus on the right leg, left leg lift back toward the front, Pipa behind the palm faces on the rebound.
*Ruins of the gate which used to mark the westernmost point in ancient China. One-day bus tours also covering remainings of the Great Wall from the Han dynasty and Yadan National Geological Park with impressive rock formations in the desert area can be booked at Dunhuang Hotel(敦煌宾馆), around ¥400.

Do

* Quad bikes rented by the hour (400-500 yuan per hour), go racing around the dunes.

Buy
* Good dried fruits and nuts (walnuts, dates, raisins, apricots, small tomatoes...). Many souvenirs. Note that some people sell wood stamps, pretending It's made from the rare Huyang tree, but It's not. Huyang Tree is too soft to be carved. 

Eat
There's a normal-priced supermarket opposite the long-distance bus station (beside Feitian Binguan) to stock up on water, snacks and other groceries.

* It's a bit pricy and the portions are pretty small.

* Lamb, potato, mushroom, bread... skewers; yogurt.

* Own by a lively small lady, eager to introduce you to her home cuisine. Tasty rice noodles with authentic sauces. Chinese speaker handy.

* A nice quiet pizza restaurant (only one in town) with good easy to read menu with English and pictures. Free wireless internet and decent relatively cheap coffee. They also do deliveries if you can speak Chinese.

* Run by an Oklahoman (he's actually from Illinois), this cafe has good coffee, milkshakes, and a small menu with pizza and hamburgers. The wifi is fast. Closed 2014 - a new milkshake place with the same name has opened around the same area. It was opened by a former staff member from the old place. He speaks English and wifi is available. 

*Very good Sichuan cuisine at very affordable prices. Although they don't speak English, they do have English menu. But it's best to look at other tables for things you like and take a pick from there. Certainly a place not to be missed.

*Serves cheap but very tasty Chinese pork burger. A combination of slow cooked fatty pork, garlic, green peppers, and other Chinese spices stuffed inside a dense and crispy charcoal baked flat bread. This hearty pork burger is only 8 yuan a piece (as of April 2013), other meats and various soups are also available.

Drink

Sleep

*national Hotel is located in Dunhuang, 200 metres from Dunhuang Historical Exhibition Park. Guests can enjoy the on-site restaurant. Free private parking is available on site.
Budget
Note that the hostels close to the sand dunes looked closed in winter

* Xuqing is a wonderful host and will help you out with planning activities. English is limited, but not a problem as she uses a translator. The hostel is very clean, with great bathrooms. A bit difficult to find, but once you're here, you'll love being out of town! ¥2 bus (bus #3) into town. 敦煌山泉山庄青年旅舍 is located in near Mingshan Mountain and other guesthouses in Dunhuang. Free WiFi. Each private room here has TV, air conditioning and private bathroom. 24-hour front desk. Open in winter.

*Good location in the city center, well connected to the sites and bus/train stations by minibus. Walking distance from the bus station. Open in winter.

* Double room for ¥300 (Oct 2013), clean, hot water, good location.

* 
The whole place is a very rundown, with dirty and smelly shared toilets. Toilet paper baskets are not emptied until they are overflowing. Flies are prevalent not only in the bathrooms but in the courtyard as well. Showers usually lack hot water and do not drain properly (one drain for 5 showers). It looks like there is a restaurant but it has not been open in some time. WiFi avaliable. Staff speak only basic english but is helpful. laundry 10 yuan per load. The whole place feels like ten years ago it could have been something special, but since then it has fallen apart. During my stay (July 2015) it is mainly used by Chinese tourists. Avoid if possible. 

* Currently under renovation (April 2015), but it looked very nice with an open air courtyard. I imagine this will be popular once opened. Location is right in the centre of town behind the mosque. Previously known as Charlie Johng's Hostel but now a new owner.

* Double rooms are expensive at ¥170. However they are spotlessly clean (as is the entire hostel) and some of the staff speak English, if somewhat monotonously. This is a good option if everything else is booked. Laundry dries almost instantly if placed on the roof due to the desert sun. On Shazhou North road north of the Beichen market.

* 

* 

* Big place made out of many small cabins/huts, like a tiny village, filled with trees, swings and hammocks. Nice, relaxed atmosphere. Hot showers, free internet/wifi, and at least one english speaking staff member. Also substantially cleaner than the Dune Guesthouse next door. Mainly Chinese guests.

*Nice clean hotel set back from the road. Friendly staff. En-suite room cost ¥100 in May 2013.

Splurge

Stay Safe

Get out
 - The route between and () is probably the hardest to do in all of the Silk Road travels since public transit is complicated between the two points. 

One leg of the trip is often closed due to washouts in the river canyon or landslides in the mountains, and is closed to most traffic in the winter. Be sure to ask, before you leave Dunhuang, whether the road between and () is open. 

Regular buses run daily each morning from , , 731 km to (花土沟), a small oil drilling town in northwest , and daily each morning the other direction. This road, a paved highway the entire way, crosses the over Dangjin Pass (当金山口, 3680 m, 39º19'14"N, 94º16'11"E) at the provincial border between and which runs along the crest of the Altun Mountains. One source says that the road rises from 1000 m to the 3680 m pass in just 20 kilometers. This road is subject to delays or closure in winter due to icy conditions.

*April 2011- the bus station in Dunhuang will not sell you a ticket to Huatugou unless you have an ATP, You cant get this permit in Dunhuang because its in Gansu province. so you have to go to the PSB in , and from there to take the bus to Huatugou

Twice daily minibuses run the 65 km in 1.5-2 hours for Y15 between and (石绵矿 literally: asbestos mine), a tiny worker hamlet north of a large surface-level asbestos mine. It's better to stay overnight in Huatugou than in the very basic lodging at the asbestos mine. Ask the Huatugou taxi driver for the Petroleum Guesthouse -- 石油 shí yóu 宾馆 bīn guǎn. There's also very basic lodging across from the Huatugou bus station -- ask the bus driver to point you in the right direction.

Some maps do not show (38°08'60"N, 90°52'00"E, 2,859 m) and instead show , about 5-10 km southwest. If neither town is shown, Huatugou is just northeast of Gaz Hure Hu lake. Some maps do not show (38°15'00"N, 90°52'00"E, 3,200 m) and instead show the small oil refinery village of , about 10 km southeast. If neither town is shown, is right where Highway 315 crosses the provincial border. Older maps show Shimiankuang and Mangnai Zhen in Xinjiang Province, but the area was moved administratively some years ago into Qinghai Province.

The 241 km road from , at the border of and , to (), , is a rough road, over a 4,000 m pass and through a narrow river valley as well as across the desert. This is the rough leg mentioned above. 
April 2011 - the road is now paved all the way. a minibus leaves from Shimiankuangs "bus station" to Charklik at 11:00 , costs 80Y. 

The minibus leaves from in front of the bus station in () at 08:00 Beijing time (06:00 unofficial local time) and arrives in about 6 hours later, and generally in time to catch the afternoon minibus from to . The 09:00 morning minibus from Huatugou meets the minibus leaving from Shimiankuang about 11:00. 
 
From () to (), the bus leaves at 10:00, takes 5 hours to cover the 351 km and costs 58Y. In the other direction, a daily bus leaves () for () at 10:00. 

There as buses to Delingha, but be carefull, the city is not open to tourists.
