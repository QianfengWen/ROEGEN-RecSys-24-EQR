Stay Safe
Fargo is a safe city, with little violent crime, however, use common sense especially when it comes to personal property, just as you would anywhere else. The only area in which a person would need to be on the look-out is downtown on the weekends, especially during the school year. With the many colleges and bars it makes for an unpredictable experience.

Contact
There is free wireless internet access in the food court at the West Acres Shopping Center.

Most coffee shops and even a few bars also offer free wireless internet access.
