Understand
For years, Lake Charles has been a gambling destination primarily attracting tourists from nearby Houston and New Orleans. Since casino gambling is illegal in Texas, many residents come to Lake Charles. Having casinos since the 70s, the L'auberge du lac impacted the region as the first full service resort in the area. Since then, the Golden Nugget opened, adding another full service resort. Lake Charles remains as having 5 casinos considered to be in the area (L'auberge, Golden Nugget, Isle of Capri, Delta Downs, and Coushatta).

While gambling is the primary tourist attraction, many visitors enjoy shopping and dining during the stay.

See
*This 375 year old live oak tree marked the corner of early resident Charles Sallier's property and is thought to be the 3rd oldest live oak in Louisiana. It stretches to create a canopy with some branches sagging all the way to the ground. 
*Built in 1962, this steep bridge has a vertical clearance of 135 feet. Drive slow enough to check out the decorative cast-iron pistols that embellish the railing over the entire length of the bridge. Traveling west-bound you will top the crest of the bridge to view a vast landscape of plants and oil refineries. This can be an oddly spectacular sight, especially at twilight.
*On the north shore of Lake Charles is the only naturally occurring inland white sand beach on the Gulf Coast. It is also very close to Interstate 10, true. Nevertheless, there are volleyball nets, picnic tables, restrooms, and a full view of the Lake. The waters are not the cleanest (in fact, the lake did not pass the water quality test this year) as there are refineries in the area, but it is ok if you're not looking for super-clear water.
*The CVB is an attractive new building that looks out over the Lake and provides visitors with info, maps, calendars, and brochures covering the Southwest region of Louisiana.
