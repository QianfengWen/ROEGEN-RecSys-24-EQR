Kagoshima (鹿児島) is the capital of on the island of , . In 2020 its population was approximately 595,000 people.

Understand
Kagoshima is a historical city watched over by the looming hulk of Sakurajima (桜島). This active volcano has eruptions over 850 times per year with the more bombastic types of eruption only accounting for about 15 of that number. The home of near-mythical samurai hero Saigo Takamori (see ), it's full of sites related to the Satsuma Rebellion.

Get in

By plane
Kagoshima's Airport (KOJ) is one hour away from Kagoshima's main train station by Bus (&yen;1300). JAL and ANA offer flights into Kagoshima from several major cities in Japan. Kagoshima Airport has flights to Okinawa, and is also the starting point for many flights to the surrounding smaller islands.

By train
Kagoshima is the southernmost city on Japan's extensive bullet train network. Services terminate at Kagoshima's main rail station, Kagoshima-Chuō (鹿児島中央).

Kyushu Shinkansen trains run several times per hour from Hakata Station in , taking as little as 75 minutes at a cost of &yen;10,110 (adult, unreserved seat). If you have a Japan Rail Pass you can use Kyushu Shinkansen services at no charge, except Mizuho trains. For those without one, consider buying the JR Kyushu Rail Pass the cost for 3 days is ¥16,000 and will cover all usage of JR trains in Kyushu including the shinkansen. Even if you are just making a round trip from Fukuoka to Kagoshima by shinkansen, the Kyushu Rail Pass will save you (&yen;4000). For those flying in and then using trains, there is also the 3-day Kyushu Rail Pass Southern Kyushu version (good for trains south of Kumamoto City and Nobeoka) for just ¥8000.

Sakura and Mizuho trains connect Kagoshima with stations north and east on the Sanyo Shinkansen network. Using the Sakura, Hiroshima is 2 hr 40 min away (&yen;17470 adult, unreserved), Okayama 3 hr 20 min (&yen;20230, adult, unreserved) and Osaka 4 hr 10 min (&yen;21780 adult, unreserved). 

From , it is possible to travel the full distance of the Tokaido, Sanyo and Kyushu shinkansen lines in 7 hours using a combination of Nozomi and Kyushu Shinkansen trains. As Nozomi and Mizuho trains cannot be used with the Japan Rail Pass, foreigners with a Japan Rail Pass can make a day trip in 8 hours using a combination of Hikari plus Sakura or Tsubame services. But given the fact that most travelers have limited time, and you can fly on cheap foreign tourist airfares from ANA's Experience Japan Fare and JAL's Explorer Fare for ¥11,000 one way on a 2-hour flight, flying usually makes more sense for such long distances unless you are touring your way down to Kyushu.

Note that Kagoshima has two central stations, Kagoshima (鹿児島駅) and Kagoshima-Chuō (鹿児島中央駅). The former is the older station slightly to the north of the city center, and you're unlikely to use it. The much larger Kagoshima-Chuō station is likely where you'll be traveling to and from. Don't confuse them!

Sleeper Trains

Because all sleeper trains from Tokyo and Kansai to Kyushu have been discontinued, traveling overnight to Kagoshima strictly by train could be a little difficult. Thankfully, trips are easier to make now that the Kyushu Shinkansen is fully operational.

From Tokyo, it is still possible to take an overnight train, the 10 PM Sunrise Seto/Sunrise Izumo, to where you can connect to a bullet train the next morning to continue the journey. With a Japan Rail Pass, a connection to a Sakura at Okayama will get you to Kagoshima at around 10:50 AM. Without a Rail Pass you can connect in Okayama to a Mizuho that gets to Kagoshima by 9:45 AM. 

Rail Pass holders must pay the lodging charge on the Tokyo-Okayama segment; the rest of the trip by Hikari and Sakura is covered under the pass. Lodging charges currently range from &yen;9450 for a B solo to &yen;10500 for a B single, to &yen;16500 for an A single deluxe. If you really want to travel on the cheap side, &yen;3660 gets you your own floor space... literally, you sleep on the floor.

Overnight by train with rest stop

Perhaps the best overnight train option - especially those using a Japan Rail Pass - is to split up the journey, stopping at an intermediate destination en-route in order to sleep somewhere. The cost incurred will only be for the hotel room; the Rail Pass covers your transportation. This is a good way to travel overnight, especially if you are able to find cheap accomodations, such as a business hotel. Yes, it may be a little hectic, and it might require some research, but this method carries two significant advantages: location and money. You will more than likely find good accomodations very close to a main train station in a smaller city, compared to a big city such as Tokyo, and it will more than likely be cheaper than hotels found in big cities. You could use the money you save to forward some of your luggage to Kagoshima using a Kurineko luggage delivery service and take an overnight bag with you, which will make the journey easier.

As of March 2012, here is one way you could go about this from Tokyo: at 7 PM, leave for Himeji by taking the Hikari train and changing to a Kodama service at Shin-Osaka station. Once in Himeji (arriving around 11 PM) you can take a rest at Himeji's Toyoko Inn which costs as low as &yen;5230 for a single room or &yen;2990 double occupancy. At 6:54 AM the next morning, board the first bullet train of the day, a Sakura service, and you will get to Kagoshima at around 10:50 AM. This trip takes longer than taking the overnight train and bullet train connection as described above, but it is cheaper; you only have to pay for the hotel room, complete with your own toilet and shower.

By bus
Various overnight bus services are available to Kagoshima from and (~&yen;10000 one way; ~&yen;21000 round-trip). Tickets for and can be bought from Willer Express's English site for around &yen;7800 each way. Daytime and nighttime buses also run from Fukuoka (yen 5400 one way; 4 hours) and . There are day buses from Kumamoto for about ¥3600; 3 1/2 hours.

 By ferry 
Kagoshima is one of Japan's most busy ferry terminals, with a multitude of ferries connecting mainland Japan to its southern islands. For the there are several routes towards which stop on different islands along the way. Operators include Matrix Line and A Line ferry - expect the full journey towards Naha to take around 25 hours, although you can stop halfway through in the . Towards the world heritage site of and the island of near Kyushu you can opt for either Orita Kisen (4 hrs, yen 4000) or the Toppy hydrofoils completing the journey in just under 2 hours (yen 7000). Finally, for the , the municipality operates 2 weekly ferries plying the route in around 7 hours (¥6000).

Get around

Streetcars are a convenient way to get around Kagoshima city. Both lines 1 and 2 can be boarded at the Kagoshima station; only line 1 runs by Kagoshima-chuo. Board the tram from the back door, and pay the ¥170 per ride fee when exiting the front door. If you don't have exact change, the fare machine can make change, but it is polite to get your change during the ride, so as to not hold people up when at your final stop. Pasmo cannot be used either. For those going all over, there is a day pass that can save money. Streetcar signage varies by the age of the streetcar; some have electronic signs that indicate the stop, but many do not. Streetcar information and a route map are available from www.synapse.ne.jp. 

The ferry between the volcanic island of and Kagoshima harbor operates frequently and around the clock. The boat ride will take about fifteen minutes.

Given Kagoshima's relatively small size and straightforward layout, buses (¥150) are less confusing than in larger Japanese cities.

If you plan to make Kagoshima a base for multiple trips, or make Kagoshima a stop on a trip throughout Kyushu, then a 5-day Kyushu rail pass may be the best option. If you are traveling from Tokyo or farther via train, then a 7-day Japan Rail pass is about the same price as a one-way shinkansen ticket from Tokyo to Kagoshima. Both of these passes have extensive limitations; be sure to review terms and make sure the cost is justified.

See

* Sakurajima - Kagoshima's temperamental (and active) volcano can be reached by 24/7/365 ferry in a matter of minutes. Face your fear and get up close and personal - just don't wear too much white, as the ash will leave you looking slightly grey. With over 850 eruptions per year (the vast majority of which are ash) you are guaranteed to see one while you are there. The best place to rent a bicycle is the Visitor's Center which has carbon fiber/aluminum composite bikes. Yunohira Lookout is a two hours hike or 15 minutes drive from Sakurajima harbor and gives you a good view both to Kagoshima harbor and Sakurajima volcano. For those not driving, there is a one hour fast paced bus tour that goes to several lookout points, including Yunohira. There are also a couple of other lookout points, where you can take a closer look at the volcano. Because Sakurajima is essentially an active volcano, remember that tourists are forbidden to go within 2 km of the crater. As there is constant ash in the air, an eye irritant: DO NOT WEAR CONTACTS.

Do
* one of the most scenic train journeys in Japan through impressive mountain scenery and river valleys. This line is divided in three sections, namely: Kagoshima - Yoshimatsu (Hayato-No-Kaze ltd. exp.), Yoshimatsu - Hitoyoshi (Isaburu Shinpei ltd. exp.), Hitoyoshi - Kumamoto (SL Hitoyoshi ltd. exp. steam train). All trains connect with one another (with 40 minute stops at transfer stations). During your trip, the train stops at small stations for around 5-10 minutes where you can look around, buy food or souvenirs. The train also stops at scenic viewing points on the line. The SL Hitoyoshi steam train only runs on weekends, and only once per day, thus, trips over the Hisatsu line should therefore be planned according to the SL Hitoyoshi schedule. All three trains are covered by the JR Pass and thus free, but reservations are required. These scenic trains are especially popular during the autumn, and spaces are limited, so it is advised you reserve seats as soon as you arrive on Narita Airport.
* To cycle one round is around 39km, and takes about 4hours with some uphill. You will be able to see most sights along the way, most notably the Showa crater on the west side of the island. It is highly recommended to rent from the Visitor's Center, they have the best bikes. 
* Besides the listing on the official Sakurajima brochure (NPO museum), Rainbow Hotel also organizes sea kayaking. 1 hour of kayaking takes you 500m to 1km (depending on your speed) along the Yogan Nagisu Trek by the coast, coming back the same way. 3,500yen for 1 hour, including entrance to hotel onsen.

Drink
Kagoshima is known throughout Japan for its sweet potato shochu, or imo-jochu (芋焼酎). While shochu is often compared to vodka, it first goes through a fermentation process. In Kagoshima, almost all restaurants have imo-jochu, and some have hundreds of different brands. Even the Shinkansen platforms at Kagoshima-chuo station have a bar/shop with 100+ varieties of shochu.

In Kagoshima, the most common way to drink shochu is mixed with hot water, or oyu-wari. This releases the fragrance of the shochu, and also reduces the alcohol content to be on-par with wine. Because Kagoshima is the center of manufacture, many factories offer tours and have small shops for tasting and purchasing the locally made shochu.

Sleep
