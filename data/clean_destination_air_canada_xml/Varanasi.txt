Varanasi l, once known as Benares or Banaras and Kashi, is a historical city in northern . It is considered one among the 7 oldest cities in India and is renowned all over the world for ancient temples mostly dedicated to Lord Shiva. It is also famed for the old ghats and the worship be of the river Ganges.

Understand

The city is sacred to Hindus and Jains and also one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, with settlements dating back to the 11th century BC. Many Hindus believe that dying in Varanasi brings salvation/nirvana and so they make the trip to the city when they realize that they are close to death. For some, the culture shock of the burning corpses in plain view can be a bit overwhelming. However, the scene of pilgrims doing their devotions in the River Ganga at sunrise set against the backdrop of the centuries-old temples is probably one of the most impressive sights in the world.

The city can be scorchingly hot in the summer months so, if possible, time your visit to fall between October and March, and bring something warm to wear for chilly days and nights.

By bus
The bus station in Varanasi is located just east of the Varanasi Junction train station. A tuk-tuk from the bus station to the Ganges area costs ₹100.

Arriving from Nepal
Buses are available from major cities in to the border city of . From the Sunauli bus station, take a rickshaw (200 NPR) to the border crossing, get your passport stamped on the Nepali side then walk through the border. After 100m of walking through no-man's land, you will find the Indian immigration office hidden away on the left hand side of the road. After going through Indian immigration, walk 300m and find the bus stop on the right hand side. From there, take the government bus to , not the private lines which are far less comfortable and stop everywhere. The bus trip between the border and Gorakhpur takes 4 hours and costs ₹60. To reach Varanasi from Gorakhpur, you can either take a train from the Gorakhpur Junction train station (5-7 trains per day, 5.5-7 hour journey, ₹200-800 cost) or a bus (hourly, 8+ hour journey, ₹130 cost).

Alternatively, there is a single bus that can be taken from Kathmandu through to Varanasi. As of Dec 2016 the bus costs 2100 NPR although if you reserve a ticket through a travel agency in Thamel it may be slightly more. The bus leaves from the Swayambhu bus park at 7pm every two days, a schedule should be available on the UPSRTC website. There is an office at the Swayambhu bus park where you may be able to directly reserve your tickets ahead of time. The bus is reasonably comfortable although it has no toilet and stops every few hours or so. The trip itself can take anywhere from 15 to 23 hours.

Arriving from other cities in India
There are buses run by state government from (8 hours, ₹160), (8+ hours, ₹130), (12 hours, ₹250), (9 hours - ₹195), (7 hours, ₹105), (7 hours, ₹250) and (3 hours - ₹107 for AC, ₹60 w/o AC).

Get around
Note that many streets are too narrow to be reached by cycle-rickshaw, auto-rickshaw, and car and therefore, you may have to walk a bit to reach your destination.

By foot

By foot is the only way to see the waterfront and the ghats - but be ready to be hot, sweaty, and lost - locals are usually happy to point you in the right direction. The names of ghats and signs pointing to restaurants and hotels are often painted on the walls in Roman letters. For better orientation, walk into any book store and pick up a small guide/map book that will have the list of all the ghats and their historical background.

Walking Tours are operated by many companies, with the cheapest being the daily tours operated by Stops Hostel (₹100 plus transportation, 3 hours). Walking tours are a great way to see some of the harder-to-find sights such as the Flower Market and Ayurvedic Herb Market.

By cycle-rickshaw and auto-rickshaw
The chaotic streets of Varanasi are sometimes too much to handle by foot. Therefore, it will often be convenient to travel by cycle rickshaw or auto-rickshaw. A short journey of a few kilometers should cost under ₹50, while a longer journey within the city, such as between the ghats and the train station, will cost ₹100. Further journeys, such as to (10km), cost ₹200 each way by auto-rickshaw.
If you take a "Shared rickshaw" you can get everywhere for ₹20, be patient and insist on wanting a shared one. 

There is a pre-paid auto-rickshaw stand at the Varanasi Junction (Cantt) train station.

By Maharaja Rickshaw
The city also has Maharaja Rickshaw(or Mr Rickshaw Wala) run by a new company which offers tailored luxury experience at very low price(starting INR250 per person). This creates all together a different experience of seeing city and also the drivers are very friendly.

By car or taxi
While taxis and cars-for-hire do exist, traffic makes them impractical.

* Varanasi taxi cab offers a wide range of Luxury and Economy cabs and buses at best rate.

* Gozo cab rental service offers a wide range of Luxury and Economy cabs and buses at best rate.

* Premium and Elite taxi service in varanasi, offers you with most professionaly experienced and trained drivers with new cars

By bicycle
Bicycle rental is available from many vendors. Inquire at your hotel.

See
Varanasi is not a city with distinct tourist destinations. The experience is in watching the spectacle of life and death on the river and meandering through the alleys of the old city.

Ghats and the River Ganges

The River Ganga is a sacred river for the Hindus and you will see traditional rituals and bathing occurring at all times of the day. On the Eastern banks, the River Ganga is flanked by a 300m wide sand belt, beyond which lies a green belt, a protected area reserved for turtle breeding. The western crescent-shaped bank of the River Ganga is flanked by a continuous stretch of 84 ghats, or series of steps leading down to the river, stretching for 6.8km. These ghats were built by Hindu kings who wanted to die along the Ganges, and they built lofty palaces along the river, most of which are now hotels, to spend their final days. You can walk along the river and see all of the ghats, but the best option for viewing the ghats is to charter a boat and see them from the river.

Hindus consider it auspicious to die in Varanasi, so some ghats are known as burning ghats, where over 200+ corpses per day are cremated in full view before their ashes are eased into the Ganga.

Some of the most popular ghats, from north to south:
* Panchganga Ghat - the meeting of the five rivers
* Manikarnika Ghat - the main cremation ghat; a must-see, but remain quiet and never take photographs (note: scams are plentiful here; see the "Staying Safe" section)
* Dasaswamedh Ghat - known as the 'main' ghat, this is the site of the large evening aarti ceremony
* Rana Ghat
* Kedar Ghat - brightly painted in stripes and busy with bathers, very photogenic
* Narad Ghat - the ghat on which bathing with spouse is not advised because the legend of contention
* Harishchandra Ghat - the cremation place where Raja Harishchandra did the last rituals of his son.
* Hanuman Ghat
* Shivala Ghat
* Tulsi Ghat - site of the large water purification plant
* Assi Ghat - a popular place to stay, with many hotels, restaurants, and internet cafes

Religious buildings

* a great place for a bird's eye view of the area.

* Monkey Temple is also called as durga temple.Monkey Temple is dedicated to Goddess Durga but is known as Monkey Temple due to excessive population of monkeys. It was built by Bengali Maharani in Nagara style. 

* The goddess at this temple is supposed to be the sister of the lord Kashi Vishwanath. Its a tradition to visit here just before you leave Kashi. You buy sea shells at this place and offer them to God saying that the virtues of donating the shells goes to her while you keep the virtues of having visited the holy shrines in Kashi and bathing in the ganga. The trip to Kashi is expected to yield results only after completing this custom.

* Dedicated to Kaal Bhairav, a dreaded form of the Lord in Shiva avatar symbolizing death. Its a tradition to buy a black thread (Rs. 15), sanctify it in the shrine, then wear it on the arm, wrist or around the neck as protection against evil.

* A small golden temple, built in Nepali architecture

* Security is tight making entrance difficult and sometimes completely off limits to foreigners. No bags, cell phones or pens are allowed. They can be deposited in the shops by the temple entrance. The temple was destroyed multiple times by Mughal invaders and was re-constructed by Hindu kings who followed them. The Free Darshan at the temple usually takes 2-3 hours. There are Suagm Darshan tickets available for 300 Rupees. The most exciting darshan is Sparsh Darshan, where you can touch the lingam and feel the presence of Lord Vishwanatha. Sparsh Darshan happens twice a day, in the early morning from 4:00 to 5:00 AM and in the evening from 4:00 to 5:00 PM. If you want to experience Sparsh Darshan, you need to be in the temple premises and join the darshan line one hour before it starts. 

* The famous Hanuman temple, home to thousands of monkeys. Security is tight, mobile phones, keys etc. are not allowed inside the temple as a result of terrorist bomb blasts; and as you enter you will be greeted by the sight of hundreds of monkeys on the premises. Beware- they may snatch from you if they see you carrying boxes or packets of food. Inside the temple you will find stacks of hanuman chalisa text for the use of devotees. 

* (10 km from Varanasi) - It is believed that in Sarnath Buddha gave his first sermon to his disciples after getting enlightenment. There is also a museum in Sarnath. The location is also known as Deer Park. Sarnath is 13 Km from Varanasi and is very peaceful. Several Asian countries have built Buddhist temples there following their own ancient architectural traditions.

* 

Other sights

* A very green and peaceful campus. Few actually know that this University was built during the Indian freedom struggle and is known as Oxford of the East. This is the largest residential university of Asia, with 124 departments. You can also visit Bharat Kala Bhavan, a museum of Art and Archaeology inside the university. There is also a huge white marbled temple called Vishwanath Temple which was built by Pt. Madan Mohan Malviya, the founder of the university.

* A 2,000+ year old fort.

* A place to interact with contemporary art in the city of Varanasi. 

* 

* The fort of the King of Kashi. Built in 1750 in the Mughal style.

Do

*Watch pilgrims bathing in the Ganges - Over 60,000 people come to the ghats every day to take a dip in the sacred waters of the Ganga, most notably at sunrise. This is a fantastic sight to see. However, due to the sewage pipes that discharge feces into the river, along with sunken corpses, there is a risk of infection from numerous diseases such as hepatitis and bacteria such as e-coli. Reports have shown that the Ganges water has a fecal coliform MPN of 88,000 per 100ml, compared to a desirable fecal coliform MPN of 500 per 100ml.

* Boat rides - Very popular, especially at sunrise and sunset. Boats can either be rowboats or motorboats. The most popular sunset ride is to start at Dasaswamedh Ghat or one of the many ghats along the river and head up to Manikarnika Ghat to see the cremations, then down to Dasaswamedh just after sunset to watch the evening aarti ceremony from the boat. Sunrise is another magical time for a ride, when the ghats are filled with Hindus bathing and starting their day - one of the most famous sights in India. You can bargain the price of the boat ride to around ₹50/person per hour. During the boat ride, other boats, usually manned by children, will float up to your boat to sell bowls with flowers and a candle to be offered to the river (₹10) or masala chai (₹10), or various trinkets that are overpriced. It is recommended to avoid polluting the river further by 'offering' non-biodegradable objects to the river. At Nishadraj Ghat, a few minutes walk from Assi Ghat, you can find a boat driver named Bhomi, a local singer renowned for his incredible voice and charming, beautiful songs; during the boat ride he sings anything from local folk songs to modern film songs and old devotional ones, and often improvises lyrics over his own songs to communicate with you and the various people gathered on the ghats. 

* Explore the alleyways - The sounds, sight and smells are just unbelievable! Walk along the ghats and up to the sights.

Festivals

* Chhath Pooja (October/November) - The four day festival for the sun god, Dala aka Surya. Rituals include holy bathing, fasting and abstaining from drinking water (Vratta), standing in water for long periods of time, and offering prashad (prayer offerings) and Arghya (water/milk offering) to the setting and rising sun. 

* Deepavali, or Diwali (October/November, always at new moon) - The five day festival of lights. The special decorations, ceremonies at the temples, and aarti ceremony at the ghats are spectacular.

* Maha Shivaratri (February) - A Hindu festival celebrating Lord Shiva, who lived in Varanasi according to Hindu mythology. On this day, the streets of Varanasi are filled with pilgrims and parades dedicated to Shiva occur all day. Entrance to temples will require long queue and the temples will be extremely crowded. The day of Shivaratri is also the last day of the Dhrupad Mela, a festival of "Hindustani" (a form of Indian classical music) that goes on night and day for about 72 hours.

Volunteer opportunities

* A sexual health, drug, and HIV education NGO. There is always demand for foreigners to visit because there is always work related to public health education to be done. A great volunteer opportunity.

Middle-Eastern Food

Possibly due to a high influx of tourists from Israel, a number of Middle Eastern restaurants have opened in Varanasi, all of which serve very similar food, cater to a predominantly tourist clientèle, and charge a little over Rs 100 for a thali. 

* Hayat Mediterranean: near Assi (new location= behind dumraon bag colony park), managed by authentic middle-easterners (from Jordan).

Splurge

* Varuna and Chowk, Taj Ganges Hotel, Nadesar Palace Grounds. Tel+91 542 250-300 - Two restaurants respectively offering Indian and Western cuisine.

Drink
* Alcohol is not common in Varanasi, but it is available at a few restaurants and hotels, such as the Radisson and Taj. There are several wine shops in the old city but they don't offer any sitting arrangement. You can buy whatever you want and bring it to your hotel room. 

* Bhang is a potent, powdered form of marijuana often mixed into "special" lassis, simply called bhang lassi. The drink is especially popular on holidays as Varanasi is a major center of Shiva worship as it is offered to the lord in form of Prashad. It can be quite intoxicating. 

* Thandai is cool milk based drink made with pistachios, almonds and kesar and topped off with a large dollop of malai (cream). Bhang is often added to thicken the concoction, though it can be made without. Many Tandai stores are located near the main Godowlia, and most also serve lassi.

* Lassi is a blend of yogurt, water, spices and sometimes, fruit. The best place to try lassi in Varanasi is Blue Lassi Shop. There you will find more than 50 types of this drink: with fruit or different toppings. It is a really interesting unordinary place. Quite difficult to find, so better to ask locals to show you the way. Although it's almost always crowded with tourists, it's highly recommended to visit. P.S. take your passport size pic, you can stick it on the wall among thousand other pics.

Sleep

The most interesting area to stay is around the ghats, which are the main attractions for foreigners and are close to the religious attractions. However, this area is extremely noisy and many accommodation choices here are subpar, so do some research before you book. An alternative to staying in Varanasi is to stay near the main train station (Varanasi Junction). This area has some very nice new places popping-up in the recent years and is only about 10 minutes on a tuk-tuk. Another alternative is the much quieter , 10+ km from Varanasi, but it takes 75+ minutes each way to reach Varanasi by tuk-tuk (₹200).
 
Some budget accommodations advertise free morning and evening boat rides along the river. However, the boat will take you up the river and then let the passengers know that for the return trip, there is a fee of ₹60 per person. Those who do not want to pay can get out of the boat and walk back.

Beware that Varanasi, particularly during summer, is prone to many hours of power outages a day. It is best to double check that your fan or A/C is run from a backup generator, or you may not have it for much of the day.

Budget
Hostels

* A hostel run out of an ancestral family house. The owner lives in Germany, but his staff, Dada and Manash, manage the hostel. There are mixed and female dormitories available with 4-5 beds each. There is a cottage-style luxury room with en-suite bathroom for the ones with a slightly higher budget, and a tent for the ones on extremely tight budget. Breakfast is included in nightly prices. The rooms are cozy and silent with comfortable beds. A/C dorms have single beds and are very spacious. The hostel also features a bistro that serves delicious vegetarian and vegan meals. Their menu also includes – rare to find in India – authentic Italian coffee. There are several pleasant common areas – including a garden and a huge rooftop.

Stay safe

Violent crime is rare, but still do be careful in the lanes after dark. 

Power outages
Carry a light or phone; power outages are extremely common, and the alleys are hard enough to navigate in daylight, let alone in pitch dark, because of their broken paving stones and cows common.

Rickshaw / taxi scams
Rickshaw / taxi scams are common in Varanasi, and the driver will inevitably tell you that the hotel that you wish to go to has burned down, is flooded, or closed. Don't believe him. Drivers receive commission from hotels for bringing in new guests, and this is one way to trick newcomers to going to these places. Don't get annoyed, but see the exchange as playful banter and part of the Varanasi experience. However, if the driver continuously refuses to follow your instructions, threaten to get out of the rickshaw. If after all this you still end up at a different place, just refuse to pay until you arrive at your hotel. The same procedure will need to be followed when sight seeing, as drivers will inevitably try to take you to handicraft stores, from which they receive commission. If calling for a pickup from a more respectable hostel, be wary that other taxi drivers may listen in to your phone conversation then tell another taxi driver who will pick you up pretending to be your hostel, then take you to a commission charging hostel.

Cremation ghat scams
As you approach Manikarnika Ghat, you will be approached by touts posing as cremators or volunteers in a local hospice. These people will explain the cremation process and even lead you to a good viewpoint. They will then take advantage of your emotions by asking you to pay for some wood to burn the body of someone who can't afford it. They will usually insist on receiving ₹500 - if you offer less, it will be initially be declined. This is a complete scam. Either tell him you have no money or that you don't feel comfortable donating.

Photography is strictly prohibited.

Respect
Cremation ghats
There is, rather understandably, some resentment at tourists trespassing up to the cremation ghats for raucous sightseeing at the funeral ceremonies of loved ones. Behave respectfully and do not take photographs of cremations, even from the river. You can take photographs if it is from a distance; most do not mind. There are touts who will "stop minding"for a fee. Note that if it is the family that objects then you have to respect it but not if local touts object in the interest of extracting money. Offer the money and if they seem ready to accept, withdraw it and photograph! Call the police if necessary.

Temples
Since this city is full of temples you will have to take off your shoes/sandals at every point. Wear flip flops that are easy to take off.

Contact
BSNL, Reliance, Vodafone, and Airtel are the most popular cell phone services in the region. If you bring your GSM cellphone from home, you can buy a SIM card and call within India and abroad. You will need your passport and a passport photo to buy a SIM card.

Wi-Fi is available at just about every hotel or restaurant that caters to foreign tourists. Internet Cafes are common, especially in the lanes between Dasaswamedh Ghat and Assi Ghat. Usually, the shopkeepers will record your passport information before giving you access to the Wi-Fi.

Calling abroad is cheap from Iway branches.
