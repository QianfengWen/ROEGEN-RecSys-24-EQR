Districts

Understand
Formerly a bastion of the industry as well as organized crime, Providence's Renaissance has created new parks and attractions and brought emphasis back to its historic roots. Downcity events, historic vistas, eclectic districts such as and , and great nightlife make Providence a worthwhile tourist destination.

Most of Providence's attractions are organized into four neighborhoods: Downcity, which includes the core of the downtown area as well as Waterplace Park, the Providence Place Mall, and Capitol Hill; Federal Hill, a neighborhood just west of downtown along Atwells Avenue that is known for nightlife and Italian dining; College Hill/The East Side, which is home to some of the city's oldest homes as well as both Brown University and RISD, and features several smaller neighborhoods with eclectic shops and restaurants. College Hill is primarily centered along Thayer Street around its intersection with Angell Street; and off to the west end of Downcity, there is Charles Street which runs directly from Downcity. Charles Street Intersects with Branch Avenue and from there till about Mineral Spring is still the most corrupt part of the City. There are a couple of high end restaurants and night clubs at the North end of Charles Street. 

 begins roughly at the start of Elmwood Avenue (closest to downtown) and Broad Street. There are many restaurants, mainly serving Spanish or Chinese food; fast food places, hair salons, banks, pharmacies, libraries and supermarkets. Everything is within a walkable distance or a short drive. South Providence has a reputation for poverty and crime; the nightclubs on Broad Street have been known for their brawls. Despite this reputation, South Providence has its nice neighborhoods where tourists can get away from everything. Downtown is a 15 minute drive away for the best entertainment and shopping. 

History

Puritan refugee and Massachusetts exile Roger Williams settled Providence, Rhode Island, in June of 1636. It soon became one of the thirteen original colonies of the United States. The Narragansett Native Americans previously occupied Rhode Island's land. 

British taxation held back the city’s economical growth in its fishing, farming, and nautical enterprises. Providence joined the allegiance against the British Crown and opposed the Sugar Act, taxation that negatively affected Providence’s international rum trade. The famous Gaspee Affair of 1772 involved the residents of Providence leading to the first violent attack of the American Revolution.

After the war, Providence’s economic industry changed from maritime activities to manufacturing, especially in jewelry and textiles. Such industries drew many immigrants from Western Europe, like Italy, Ireland, England, Portugal, and Cape Verde of Africa, all of which greatly contribute to the demographic populations of the state today.

The jewelry industry boomed in the 1920s. The Great Depression hit hard economically, leading to population decreases as a result of the decline of nationwide trends. Organized crime rose to the forefront in Providence in the 1950s through the 1980s, primarily situated in Providence's Federal Hill neighborhood. Providence became a notorious mob scene led by mafia boss Raymond L. S. Patriarca. 

The “Renaissance City” got its nickname in the 1990s when Mayor Vincent “Buddy” Cianci Jr came into his second term. After investing millions of local and national funds throughout the city in the 1970s, falling populations became stabilized. Cianci pushed for an emphasis on the city’s strength in the arts and entertainment and revitalized the city’s natural landscape. He brought Rhode Island the Providence Bruins hockey team, uncovered Providence’s rivers, relocated a large section of the railroad underground, created the now famous Waterplace Park and river walks, and sanctioned the construction of the Bank of America Skating Rink and gigantic Providence Place Mall.

Providence has a long history of political corruption that some feel to be part of the local charm. In keeping with this tradition; Mayor Cianci was indicted not once but twice from the local office. When running for office for his second term, he actually ran partly from jail. It wasn't until a 2001 racketeering case was brought against Cianci that the notorious Mayor's reign ended. 

The current Mayor of Providence is Angel Taveras who has made strides to end the coffer draining in the capitol.

Climate

}}
Providence's climate is humid continental/subtropical. This means high humidity year-round, with hot, wet summers and cold, snowy winters. Unlike other inland states in New England, Rhode Island's position along the Atlantic coast keeps Providence's temperatures relatively warm. Precipitation is a mainstay in Providence's climate. Spring and summer months often have bouts of rainfall and winter months are regularly hit with snowfall and blizzards. Providence's position on the coast of Narragansett Bay leaves the city susceptible to hurricanes, but such occurrences are rare.

Stay Safe

Providence is a relatively safe city for its size, though proper caution and common sense should not be abandoned. The downtown area can be dodgy at night, especially around Kennedy Plaza and Washington Street. The club areas on the outskirts of downtown have also been known to draw some issues, though most are gang-related. Another area to avoid at night is the Camp Street area of the East Side. There is some known gang activity and there has been some violent behavior in the past. Also, late nights on Federal Hill are a great place to watch drunken idiots beat each other up under the guise of Italian pride (though this is more in the vein of "Jersey Shore" Italian and not of that that first inhabited the city decades ago), so exercise caution while in the bar and club area of this historic neighborhood.

As far as violent crime goes, it is best to avoid South Providence and the Olneyville neighborhoods of the city. There is little reason for most tourists to go to these locations, though the city's three main hospitals are relegated to the South Side. Olneyville's New York System was featured on Food Network's "Best Thing I Ever Ate" series, and while there are two other locations within driving distance of Providence (Rhode Island is the smallest state, after all), a quick visit here to get a few hot dogs will not result in a problem unless you decide to walk around the neighborhood a bit and it's 1:00 in the morning.
