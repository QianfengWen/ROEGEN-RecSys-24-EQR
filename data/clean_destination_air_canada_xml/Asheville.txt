Asheville is a popular tourist destination and is known as a liberal, artsy community. It was named one of the world's top 12 must-see destinations for by Frommer's travel guides. This "Paris of the South," has also been described as the "San Francisco of the East," "New Age Mecca," and "Land of the Sky." It's a city of which Rolling Stone magazine dubbed "America’s New Freak Capital." But Asheville is by no means simply a haven for Hippies and 'Out There's', as Money magazine has called Asheville one of the "Best Places to Retire," and AARP cites it as one of the "Best Places to Reinvent Your Life." Self magazine proclaims Asheville as America’s "Happiest City." PETA lists Asheville as "America's Best Vegetarian-Friendly Small City."

Architecture
Asheville is nationally renowned for its unique architecture, especially downtown and around the Biltmore Estate. The city suffered greatly during the Great Depression, and consequently little development happened during the time. This actually had a positive effect, as the city's famous Art Deco Architecture of the Roaring 20's was saved from destruction. Therefore, today, Asheville boasts the nations most complete collection of Art Deco structures. Other architectural styles, of course, are present in abundance throughout the city; from the Neo-Gothic Jackson Building "Skyscraper" to the Modern BB&T Tower.

* A 14-story building faced with brick, limestone and terra cotta trim with a Mission Revival style roof, erected in 1924.
* A French Renaissance-inspired chateau; with over 250 rooms, it is the largest single family home in the U.S. and the largest privately-owned house in the world, just a few minutes outside the city and should be on any visitor's itinerary. Basic admission includes access to the fabulous gardens, stables, expansive hiking trails, winery and self-guided house tour.
* Completed in 1928, the outside features complex setbacks, window groupings and overlay of Neo-Classical Revival ornamentation. The Neo-Classical interior lobby contains a sweeping marble staircase, bronze and glass screens, a coffered ceiling with ornate plasterwork and a mosaic tile floor.
* Designed by Art Deco architect Douglas Ellington and completed in 1927, the City Building is constructed out of Georgia Pink marble, brick, and terra cotta. The steeped, octagonal shaped roof is the logo of the City of Asheville.

* A uniquely triangular shaped building bordering Wall Street and Battery Park Avenue constructed in 1926.
* Commissioned by Dr. E. W. Grove, the Grove Arcade is an elaborate Tudoresque building occupying an entire city block. It is particularly worth noting, as it was, when it was built in 1927 by architect Charles N. Parker, one of the nation's most unique and interesting buildings. On each side of this city landmark, four giant arches allow entrance into the building. On the main side facing the equally impressive Victorian Battery Park Hotel, are two monumental gryphons, guarding the entrance into the expansive interior, which features oak shopfronts, spiral staircases, and opulence around every corner. Today, it serves as as an influential public market with several restaurants, vendors, and mountain craft shops.
* Completed in 1913, this historic resort hotel is an important example of the Arts and Crafts style.
* Bordered by South Market Street and South Pack Square, completed in 1925. A Neo-Gothic style skyscraper complete with gargoyles and a bell tower.

Buy
Asheville does not necessarily have a specific commercial district but rather it resembles a long line, curving through the mountains. Beginning directly north of downtown, Merrimon Avenue has many low density restaurants and small shopping strip malls. It is the typical American shopping street and many locals consider it “The Strip.” As you move south towards the city-center, Merrimon Avenue changes names to Broadway, then Biltmore Avenue after it intersects with Patton Avenue at Pack Square, home to the Vance Monument, located directly in front of City-County Plaza.

Surrounding this area, Downtown, you will find many boutiques, cafes, museums, and interesting historical buildings. At the eastern end of downtown, The Beaucatcher Tunnel is carved directly into Sunset Mountain. The recently renovated street leading out of downtown and into the mountain goes into the edifice as College Street and comes out as Asheville’s most celebrated shopping street, Tunnel Road.

Tunnel Road is very commercial and hosts mostly large corporate chains. Recently, construction has boomed along this stretch, and reaching towards the skies above the restaurants and stores you will see some brand new hotels. Finally, Tunnel Road transitions into South Tunnel Road, which is home to the city’s main mall and smaller chain shopping centers. This area of town is not at all touristy, and prices are average and intended for locals.

At the end of South Tunnel Road there is a vast shopping center that extends across the Swannanoa River and up over the mountain, eventually overlooking the Industrial district, containing a relatively new and quite controversial shopping complex along the river, having the city’s Super Walmart as its flagstore. It was built upon the rubble of the abandoned Sayles-Biltmore Bleachery, which used to bleach paper for the US Treasury's currency manufacture.

From Pack Square going south (away from I 240), Biltmore Ave continues down past Biltmore Village and into South Asheville and Arden, with many chain stores and strip malls, from which one can access via NC 146 Long Shoals Rd, Biltmore Park a recently built exurb with high end shopping around a reproduced downtown square. 

Downtown Asheville is full of neat and quirky shops and prides itself on the lack of corporate chain stores. Spend some time exploring downtown (it's very walkable) and see what you can find. Here are some highlights:
* A newly-restored and exquisite building built by E.W. Grove, who also designed the Grove Park Inn in the 1920s. It is filled with specialty food markets, restaurants, and local mountain craft stores.
* An independent bookstore with a good selection and an open mind. Great staff recommendations. Grab a book or bring your own and relax in the cafe with coffee and a pastry or bagel.
*An artisan, local chocolate shop owned and operated by Dan and Jael Rattigan, dedicated to using organic ingredients and buying fairly traded goods.
* A European-style chocolatier with some of the best truffles to be found anywhere. Although it's easy to spend a lot of money here, the pricing is quite reasonable given the quality and size of the chocolates.
* Has an old-fashioned to modern day assortment of products. Old-time candy in barrels to hiking and camping equipment and apparel. 
*Lexington Avenue is one of Asheville's hippest streets. For your music needs visit Static Age Records, specializing in vinyl, punk rock and heavy metal. Instant Karma and the Octopus Garden specialize in smoking accessories along with a wide variety of other products. Hip Replacements has some great vintage clothing, while up the block Spiritex offers a wide variety of sustainably produced clothing. Buy a used book or read the newspaper or a magazine at Downtown Books and News. Get a tattoo at Liquid Dragon and stop by one of the many restaurants on Lexington for a quick bite. On the next block up is the Chevron Trading Post for all of your beading needs, and Tops for Shoes the biggest shoe store in Asheville. While many wonderful stores and hot spots along this street are facing increasing pressure from landlords who want to "gentrify" the area, Lexington is still the best place to get a taste of Asheville's counterculture.

Biltmore Village Just South of Asheville's downtown, and right outside the gates of the Biltmore Estate is the quaint village built around the 1890's called Biltmore Village. It is easily accessed from I-40 (Exit 50). A number of small independently owned retail stores which have carved out specialty niches can be found intermingled with restaurants beneath the shade of the tree-lined streets. Recently, National Specialty stores and a boutique Hotel have begun construction there. Of particular note are the following:
* Probably the best collection of regional Arts and Crafts in Western North Carolina. The gallery features ceramics, glass, jewelry and furniture from local Appalachian artisans. It is in front of Bella Vista Art Gallery 

River Arts District Wrapped along the river, and visible from the bridge over the French Broad River (i.e. from I-240 or Patton Ave.) is an enclave of Art Studios, Galleries, and restaurants that is still not quite user-friendly but accessible to the adventurous. Some worthy points of interest are:
*Asheville Glass Center and Gallery Glassblowing instruction and studio rentals and a glass gallery representing some of the regions finest glass artists.
*The Old Cotton Mill Building Owned by Marty and Eileen Black and inhabited by a mixed group of artists and studios.
*The Phil Mechanic Building Cutting edge Galleries, artists and a Bio-diesel plant can be found if you wander around inside the old building. Jolene Mechanic, the owner, is a great resource for getting to know the area.
*240 Clingman This was originally a warehouse. Right after the Katrina Hurricane it was turned into a gallery by the owners of Bella Vista Art Gallery After they left, Jonas Gerard, from Miami, took over the space. He was featured on 20/20 and has some eye-popping art on display, and for sale.
*The Wedge Filled with little art galleries, artists, a brewery, fine porcelain and mechanical dinosaurs is interesting but not for the timid.

Head away from downtown and visit the WNC Farmer's Market for a huge selection of locally grown and produced crops 'n' crafts. You could spend hours and still not see everything.

Drink
Liquor is available by the drink in Asheville, but if you want to buy liquor by the bottle you must do it at state-run ABC (Alcoholic Beverage Commission) stores rather than at a traditional liquor store. These stores have limited exterior decorations so they can be difficult to find. Open containers of alcohol are never permitted on the street; if you order a beverage you must finish it before leaving the restaurant or bar. Beer and wine are available for purchase at most markets, grocery stores and gas stations. The alcohol laws of the state prohibit the sale of alcohol after 2AM Monday through Saturday, and from 2AM until noon on Sundays.
