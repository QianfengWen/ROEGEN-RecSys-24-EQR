Understand

During the American Civil War, Chattanooga was a major railroad station and at the center of a number of pitched battles. These battles are remembered through numerous battlefield parks and Civil War attractions located in and around the city.

In more modern times, the city has received national recognition for the renaissance of its once dilapidated downtown and redevelopment of its riverfront. An early cornerstone of this project was the restoration of the historic Walnut Street Bridge, which is now the world's longest pedestrian bridge.

Chattanooga is the corporate headquarters and home of Olan Mills, Blue Cross & Blue Shield of TN, Rock Creek Outfitters, Krystal, Chattem, Unum, The Chattanooga Bakery (home of the Moon pie), and Miller Industries, the largest tow truck manufacturer in the world; Chattanooga is the birthplace of the tow truck. Chattanooga is also home to the Tennessee Valley Authority, a self-funding government agency which operates numerous power plants in the South. Following the city's industrial decline, many businesses in the banking and insurance industries set up operations in Chattanooga. The city is home to large branch offices of Cigna, AT&T and UBS.

Within the last ten years the city has won 3 national awards for outstanding "livability", and 9 Gunther Blue Ribbon Awards for excellence in housing and consolidated planning.

As of the census of 2000, there are 155,554 people, 65,499 households, and 39,626 families residing in the city. There are 72,108 housing units at an average density of 205.9/km² (533.3/mi²). The racial makeup of the city is 59.71% White, 36.06% African American, 0.29% Native American, 1.54% Asian. 2.11% of the population are Hispanic or Latino of any race.

Weather
*Summer (Jun-Aug), average temperature of 80&deg;F (27&deg;C), with maximums in the low 100s (38&deg;C). Scattered thundershowers quite often appear and disappear almost as quickly, sometimes dropping almost an inch of rain in 30 minutes or less.

*Autumn (Sep-Nov), average temperature of 61&deg;F (16&deg;C).

*Winter (Dec-Feb), average temperature of 40&deg;F (4.5&deg;C), with a number of days below freezing (32&deg;F, 0&deg;C). Very little snow or ice in the valley, but fairly often in the higher elevations such as Lookout and Signal Mountains. Almost any amount of snow or ice in the valley will stop nearly all activity in the city.

*Spring (Mar-May), average temperature of 59&deg;F (15&deg;C).

In Winter; always bring a heavy coat because after living here for decades, I can state the fact that because of elevation changes from one area to the next, the airport is not a good way to get an average for the Metro area. It's often much colder with more snow in winter in most areas and it's a damp cold. The record low of -10 has been hit several times in the past and windchill's can be that cold or lower many winter nights. The weather changes quickly so it can be 55* one day clear or with fog and 25* the next day. Most nights are near or below freezing with teens and 20s typical with higher humidity that in Northern States so one will feel the cold. Summers are hot and humid and typically run higher than averages at the airport. Spring is short and temps tend to run about the same as the airport as do October temps. Halloween is usually the peak of the fall colors and the first week in November the trees are usually losing their leaves. It's a much different climate here than in Atlanta in winter. Much colder. Summers are similar.
