Luxor (Arabic: أَلْأُقْصُر ‎ Al 'Uqṣur) the name of "Luxor" means "Palaces" and it is the premier travel destination in Upper (southern) and the Nile Valley. The dynastic and religious capital of Middle Kingdom and New Kingdom Egypt, Luxor has much for travellers to enjoy: vast temples, ancient royal tombs, spectacular desert and river scenery and a bustling modern life.

Districts
Although a relatively small town by Egyptian population standards, Luxor is quite extensive and is best divided up into several 'districts' or areas that group the main attractions on their respective sides of the river Nile:

* the town, the Luxor Temple, the Temple of Karnak, The Museum, train station, bus hub, hotels, restaurants.
* the location of the major ruins including , the Valley of the Queens and other important sites; the ruins, and a few hotels. More quiet, has a village vibe.

Understand

The old capital of Egypt, Thebes, was on the West bank of the Nile. That is where most of the ruins and tombs are.

The modern city of Luxor is on the East bank. That area has the train and bus stations, most of the hotels
and restaurants, some museums, tourist shops and so on. Most visitors (and almost all tour groups) stay on the East bank and travel across for the tourist sites but, in recent years, there has been an increase in hotels on the West bank and many independent travellers stay there.

Climate
Luxor has a hot-desert climate. The city is one of the driest, sunniest and hottest (during summertime) cities in the world. Rainfall doesn't occur every year, about 1mm on average. Luxor features cool winters with mild days, but cold nights, so that the average January temperature is 13.8°C (56.8°F). Lows during nighttime are around 5°C (41°F) and highs around noon are about 24°C (75°F), resulting to very large diurnal temperature variations. Even in the coldest nights, when the temperature is near freezing, during the day there may be temperatures up to 25°C (77°F). Summers are scorchingly hot with an average temperature in July of 32.3°C (90.1°F). During daytime temperatures exceed 40°C (104°F), but nights still remain pleasant (20-25°C or 68-77°F). The highest and lowest temperature ever recorded is 48.5°C (119.3°F) and -1°C (30°F) prespectively, while temperatures above 30°C (86°F) have occured in all months of the year and temperatures above 40°C (104°F), have occured from March to October.

Get in

By plane
Visitor visas are available on arrival to many foreign nationals, just after you enter the terminal building. (USD25 or equivalent, approximately EGP450, most major foreign currencies accepted.)

Luxor International Airport () is a destination for flights on several European and Middle Eastern routes, as well as the main southern hub for domestic flights within Egypt.

Internal flights (duration c. 1h) from to Luxor are maintained by Egyptair and cost about USD230 for a return trip ticket. 

Direct charters from Europe (London Gatwick, for example) are common in the winter high season. From the airport in Luxor, you will probably take a shuttle provided by your hotel. The Airport in Luxor is very small, and getting luggage off the belt is a challenge.

EgyptAir also arranges day trips from Cairo which is an easy way for those who can stand long days to cover the main attractions of Luxor. 

Sharm el Sheikh also offers one day guided trips flying to Luxor. 

Taxis are in abundance everywhere for local transportation. A taxi from the airport into town (east coast) or backwards should cost between 50-100 EGP. Taxi to west coast is around 200 EGP. Vehicles have to pay 20EGP when leaving the airport, so ensure to take that into account in your negotiation. Do not be fooled by the cartel of taxi drivers outside the doors to the airport. Keep walking until you find a taxi driver in his car and then negotiate. Half the people you think are taxi drivers are just touts, so don't waste your time negotiating. Inside the airport gate, they will ask for EGP250-300 in order to go, so just walk outside the gates and find a taxi on the streets. The best way to avoid any kind of scam is to call a Careem.

Do not let anybody get a hold of your luggage. Even when you go to put your bags in the car, another driver will likely take a hold of your bag and place it the final 6 inches and then demand a tip for putting your car away. Do not give him any.

By train
For those unwilling to purchase an expensive plane ticket, who have more time in which to travel and / or who wish to see more of the country, train travel to Luxor is a great and amazingly inexpensive option.

Four different modes of train travel exist between Ramesses Station , Luxor and on to (some trains even start in ):

*Daytime air-conditioned express train - travellers to Luxor can choose from 1st and 2nd class carriages, both with comfortable aircraft-style seats. The journey down the Nile Valley takes 9-10h, but is a relaxing way to sit back and view the lush rural landscape of Egypt, its many towns, people and animals. Tickets from Cairo - Luxor cost EGP90/45 (Dec 2011) for 1st/2nd class, although tourist may be charged EGP165/90 (Dec 2011). Some drinks and snacks are served. The dining car may be cheaper, if available. Buy food and drinks beforehand. Don't be discouraged by people saying that tourists can only travel by the overnight train. It is, however, likely that you will not be allowed to buy tickets for this train at a counter. You can buy a ticket online or ask a Egyptian to buy the ticket for you. Or you can just board the train and pay the conductor, who will not make a problem of it.

*Overnight air-conditioned express train - the night service, meaning 22:00 or later, is identical to the daytime train. It saves sightseeing time compared with travelling by day and does cost less than the deluxe sleeper. For tourists, Cairo - Aswan costs EGP165 (Dec 2011) 1st class. Luxor is the same price despite lower distance. There are reports of the same tourist restriction as mentioned above.

*Overnight deluxe sleeper - saving time and discomfort, modern air-conditioned sleeping-cars are run between Cairo and Luxor by a company called Abela Egypt. Each train has a selection of 1- and 2-berth rooms and a club / lounge car. An evening meal and breakfast are included in the fare. Note that passengers travelling alone who don't opt for a single-berth compartment will be booked into a 2-berth compartment with another, random traveller of the same sex. Prices currently USD100(Dec 2013) each one way from Cairo to Aswan.

*Slow trains - 2nd & 3rd class slow trains also run between Cairo and Luxor, stopping at most stations - these are incredibly basic and are not recommended for tourists, and actively discouraged by the Egyptian government. You may be denied a ticket, especially if travelling alone or late at night. If you are forced to ride a 3rd class train (due to unannounced change in schedule that does happen quite often), look for a car that has other women inside as you'll be less likely to be hassled by the leering and rude kids.

Tickets can be arranged through most travel agents in your city of departure for minimal commission. Otherwise, tickets can be purchased directly at Ramesses Station by proceeding through the chaos to Platform 11, where signs will point out the ticket booth. Tickets are best bought a couple of days in advance of travel, although the same day is often enough. The big exception to this rule is Egyptian holidays, when it is best to reserve a ticket at least a week in advance. Weekend travel (Thursday and Friday in Egypt) is the busiest time. Beware that the train schedule is likely to change at any given time making reservations difficult. If your train gets cancelled, they will reimburse you. As much as you'll want to avoid riding in a 3rd class train, it may be impossible to avoid if relying on train travel; your best option is really to buy a ticket 30min in advance of leaving (arrive early as the schedule shifts often)

Train tickets have assigned seating to a particular carriage and seat, written in both English and Arabic. Train travel is possible without a prior reservation, but it will add EGP3 to the price of your eventual ticket, and you will not be guaranteed a seat for the long journey.

You can book 1st class train tickets online from Egyptian Railways official website. Please note that you must book online at least 24 hours prior to the train schedule. In case you book online, it is highly recommended to have a printout of the tickets and your ID/Passport with you on the train. If you failed to print the ticket, at least have with you the reservation number and details. If it is your first time on the website, you will be asked to create an account first before proceeding with booking a ticket.

By bus

Buses leave regularly from behind the Luxor Temple, to most major cities. For connections to Aswan and Cairo, the train is recommended, but it is a good alternative to get to Sinai (via Hurghada--Sharm el Sheik, or over the Suez canal). "Upper Egypt" bus to Sharm (135 LE)/ Dahab (150 LE) leaves at 5 pm. Better to buy ticket 2 days before.

By boat
There are boat trips from Luxor to Aswan and also on Lake Nasser to . These are reportedly the most pleasant and interesting way to get there if you have the time and money. A is a great option for those with more time and less money. The train is a close second and much faster.

Note (2011) according to river boat captains, it is impossible to journey from Luxor to Aswan. Due to the river lock, the felucca must leave from the town of Edfu and continue to Aswan. The prices are wildly negotiable but you will be bargaining down from 700 EGP so it could be a couple hundred or more for a two day cruise to get there. The train is reputed to take four hours.

As of September 2012, the above note is not valid (as we were able to take a cruise from Luxor to Aswan), but be advised that this situation may occur depending upon the river level.

By car
For the intrepid, it is possible to rent a car in Luxor and self-drive your way through Upper Egypt. Europcar appears to be the only major international chain currently servicing the city (November 2018). Europcar delivers the vehicles from Hurghada on demand--there is no Europcar office in the city--so it is necessary to arrange this at least several days in advance. The car can be picked up and dropped off at the airport. Driving a car in Upper Egypt is not recommended unless you have significant experience driving in middle-income countries, and a car rental is unlikely to save either money or hassle compared to taking taxis and hiring a car with a driver. However, those who wish to self-guide their way through Egypt or who enjoy the experience of driving like an Egyptian are now permitted by police to drive throughout Upper Egypt and can take advantage of rental cars. In November 2018, it is possible to drive at least as far north as Abydos and as far south as Abu Simbel, although police escorts may be required between Abydos and Qena, and Abu Simbel and Aswan (in our experience: one time for each of those two routes the escort was been required and was arranged on the spot for free, and the other time for each route it was not required). Expect to get many surprised looks from anyone who notices you as an obvious foreigner driving in Egypt. At the police checkpoints throughout Upper Egypt if you are flagged down to stop you will need to give the nationalities of the passengers in the car and where you are going and possibly a local Egyptian phone number, but this will not take more than a minute. However you will probably be waved through most of the time.

Get around

By bicycle

Luxor is brimming with rental shops for bikes and a great many hotels also hire out bicycles. Rental rates vary from roughly 5LE - 40LE, depending on your bargaining skills, the relative demand on bikes that day and the quality of the bike in question. Check the tires and be wary of last minute inflating as they may deflate just as fast. It is quite normal for people to be asked to leave behind their passport, drivers license or student ID card as a deposit. Bikes can be rented on both the East and West Banks of Luxor (the latter near the local ferry landing), though the choice and quality of bikes is usually better in the East, and prices can be a little over-inflated on the more isolated West. If you look for high quality bicycles, you can find Dutch bikes (gazelle/batavus) at the Dutch Rental Agency in Sheratonstreet (Eastbank)and in the Souk just when you leave the ferryboat(Westbank). Note that bikes can be taken on board the local ferry (be considerate though!), so feel free to hire on the East, then transport your bike over yourself. Do watch Egyptian traffic before deciding if you want to ride a bike through it.

Remember - the East bank is the metropolitan side, so consider the traffic and crowds while deciding whether to bike on that side. The West bank in contrast is much more rural, and many tourists opt to bicycle among the fields here while getting themselves between the tourist sites. 

Warning though: At the sites, guards will try to convince you to avoid locking your bicycle as they will watch it. Which they will do very well- and then demand a tip for having done so. Lock your bike yourself to avoid this unnecessary expense.

By motorcycle

For the even more brave, Luxor is brimming with Chinese motorcycles around 150cc. With the right bargaining skills you can net one for 50LE+ per hour, or less for the day or evening. In the summer, the roads around the West Bank are relatively empty, and motorcycling around the ruins and mountains is easy and efficient. In a slow season, many are willing to rent you their own motorcycle for the right price. Remember to demand a helmet - since nobody uses them. 

By taxi

Taxis are plentiful in Luxor. They have no meters, but there are current rates that are accepted if you stay firm.
From the airport to downtown is about LE 50 excluding the airport surcharge of 20EGP, and short trips within Luxor are between LE 10 and LE 20. A round trip to the West Bank is about LE 100.
When negotiating for a ride to the airport, specify that you want to be dropped off inside the airport compound not outside. Some drivers will demand an extra 20EGP to pay for the surcharge to drop you off inside. Drivers may also pull out a fixed price list and demand a higher price once the journey begins, ignore them and just pay the agreed price. 

The Sheraton Luxor Resort has a list of current (overpriced) taxi rates from their hotel to a number of destinations that can be used as a handy reference.

Call a Careem if you do not feel like negotiating.

By minibus

Minibuses are the transportation of the locals in Luxor, and the cheapest way to get around for the adventurous tourist. They all have the same shape so are easily recognized. They have fixed routes, with different routes marked by a different colour on the side of the minibus. However there are no maps of the routes, the locals just seem to know them by heart. All busroutes seem to converge at the railway station. Hail a bus by looking at it while it is approaching, and raise your arm. When the bus is full it will not stop (there are about 14 seats in a bus). Otherwise you can jump in, take an empty seat, and pass money to the driver, a flat 1.50LE per person(Mar 2019) for a ride (no haggling required). When you do not pay while you sit down, they will assume you do not know the price and the driver will charge you 2LE when you get off. Getting off is possible anytime, and is done by simply asking the driver to stop when you are near your destination.

By boat

An essential way of getting between the East and West banks of Luxor is to use a boat. As you walk by the river, dozens of felucca owners will offer you their services to haul you over the river, and normally a taxi driver will be on standby on the other side. They will try to sell it on inflated price, 20-50LE and that is if they don't give you an extra excursion (not necessarily what you asked for). The real price is 15LE (Mar 2019) per boat, insist on this price and they will go for it. It is much easier to take the blue local ferry, a very basic boat that you can use for around 5LE per person. The downside is that the ferry only leaves when it is full, or when another ferry arrives, so taking the ferry is in general slower - though you avoid the haggling. Taxis are available at the ferry terminal on both sides, and the trip takes just a few minutes.

By calèche

Calèches, or horse-drawn carriages, are common on the east bank and are a delightful way to see the city, especially at night-time. Prices vary according to bargaining skill, but 20LE per hour seems common, or 5LE for a short 1km trip. You'l need to haggle / walk away to get these prices.

BEWARE: There are frequent reports of robbery by carriage-drivers. If they harrass you, threaten to call the tourist police. 

However, a number of animal rights groups have advised against calèches due to the poor treatment of the horses. It is not uncommon for drivers to beat their horses, and most Western tourists will notice many skinny and scarred animals. This does not mean that all drivers are to be avoided, some are reputable. Use common sense when choosing.

Beware of using the same driver for several days in a row. At the end he may decide he has undercharged you in some way for previous trips and may ask for a lot more, for things which "wasn't" included, such as waiting around while you visited a temple, all the money paid before went to the boss and none to your driver, a tip for the horse, in the original price. It might be best to use a different driver each trip and not book a previously used driver to avoid this possible scenario from happening even if he does seem more pleasant than most to start with.

On foot

It is also possible to travel around the tourist district on foot during the cooler parts of the day, provided you have a good sense of direction. To avoid unwanted attention you will need to constantly repeat the words &quot;No Hassle&quot;, or "Laa Shukran", which means No Thank You in Arabic. Also, be prepared to yell out for the Tourist Police if you have any concerns for your safety. There are usually always some policemen nearby since they may be also wearing civilian clothes.

A good tactic for avoiding hassle is to buy an Egyptian paper each day (in Arabic) and carry this with you. Locals will assume that you know Arabic (and therefore their tricks) and leave you alone. Egyptian papers cost around 1LE.

See

The various Luxor district article pages contain detailed information and suggestions for things to see. Definite highlights, not-to-be-missed, include:

*
Note that with this ticket, you will get to choose 3 tombs to visit of usually about 8 open in Valley of the Kings. Extra entry is required for Tutankhamen and Seti I. If you take pictures inside without a camera ticket (which is basically the cost of another entry), guards may ask to see the photos on your camera. You will have to pay a bribe if they catch you.
*Temple of Karnak
Karnak is further out of the city centre and is specifically well known for its forest of columns. It is a fun temple to take your time searching for colours that have lasted for thousands of years.
*Temple of Luxor
Note that the Temple of Luxor downtown is open after sunset. It's a cool place to see a temple as the light changes.
*Medinet Habu (100 le)
*The Tombs of the Nobles (60 le)
Note you can buy 3 tickets for the tombs, each ticket allows you entry into 2-3 tombs each. In March 2019, the 3 tickets were for:
# Tombs 96 (Sennofer - beautiful with many paintings) and 100 (Rekhmire - very large, also many paintings) which are the most interesting
# Tombs 55 (Ramose - large but empty), 56 (Userhet - agricultural scenes and many of Osiris) and 57 (Khaemhet - a few statues inside)
# Tombs 52 (smaller but includes explanations), 69 (Meena - many cool paintings), 41 (newly found just a few years ago) 
*The Ramesseum Temple
*Colossi of Memnon (free)
*Deir el Medina or the Valley of the Artisans (100 le)
Extremely underrated and hardly visited is Deir el Medina where the paintings are so well preserved and gorgeous. Very easy to get to as you will likely pass it while visiting other sites. Ticket allows entry into 3 stunning tombs.
*Howard Carter's House (80 le)
The original house of Howard Carter is a small museum now in the area. There is a mock tomb of Tutankhamen and how they originally found it but it is mostly a chamber filled with the story of the discovery.

Do

* Walk from the Valley of the Queens across the desert and over the cliffs to the Valley of the Kings
* Hire a bike and ride around Ancient Thebes - takes you less than 15 minutes to get there.

* A local felucca ride just before sunset; shouldn't cost you more than about LE 30 (for one person) per hour.
* Take a for a 2 day trip to Aswan (the reverse trip is recommended, however, due to river currents).
* Hire a donkey, horse, or camel to ride around Luxor's West Bank.Go to Pharaoh's Stables,just a short walk from the ferry terminal.They will take you to places where the big coaches cant go,so you can enjoy the real Egypt, with its friendly people and relaxed lifestyle.Every day is different when you see the West Bank by horse or donkey,and the guides will look after you all the way. They have horses for beginners to experienced riders.The Sunset ride and Nile ride is a must do. www.pharaohstables.com call them on 010 6324961 

* Go for a swim in a hotel’s pool after a dusty day of tombs and temples:
** Iberotel: 75E£
** Sonesta: 50E£
** The one right next to St. Joseph: 25E£
*Flight starts before dawn: MH staff picks passengers up at their hotel or cruise boat, ferry them across the Nile by Felucca boat (tea/coffee & cakes provided on the boat) and drive them to the take-off point. Guests glide up from the West Bank in an balloon and float over Luxor enjoying a view of all the important landmarks of the West Bank. A unique way to visit the ancient land of the Pharaohs. Each flight lasts at least 40 minutes, weather permitting. NOTE: lately, users are reporting that flights from Magic Horizon are leaving after sunrise (meaning they say its for sunrise but in fact you miss sunrise), keep this in mind. Price: negotiate to 25-35$

Buy

There are at least two different markets in Luxor. One is located in an air-conditioned hall, with shops located on either side of the hall. This market hall connects two major streets. 

The older market takes up several streets near the Luxor temple. It is a joy to walk through, as it is mostly pedestrian and is a welcome respite from the horse and carriages on the main streets. This market really feels like an old souk and the visitor is taken back in time. It is covered with a wooden trellis, shading people from the sun. Many of the shops offer the same items, so the wise buyer shops around and looks for the best price. One can often bargain better after going to several stores. 

Once you find a merchant you like, sit down, have some tea, and begin the game of bargaining. It can feel like you are becoming a part of the family. Buying something as simple as a cotton galabeya can take hours, as you try on almost every single galabeya in the store, and then move on to items that they think you may want for the rest of your family.

Buying anything may be very frustrating due to constant if you are not used to it. This trick has proven to work well: usually their first offer for the price can be ten or even a hundred times bigger than a reasonable price. First decide what you are actually willing to pay. Let us say that in this example it is 20LE. If you ask for the price, you may get a reply "120LE". Now you offer 22LE. You may then be offered something like 110LE. Then instead of going up, you start going down with the price, your new offer will be only 20LE (your predefined price limit). If the bargaining continues you continue dropping your offer. Pretty soon he will understand where the bargaining is going and you get a comfortable price or - at least - you get rid of the vendor.

The main Souk in Luxor lies on the Abd-El-Hameed Taha and consists of the section for tourists, and the section for locals. The touting in the main Souq's tourist section is so bad that it is an absolute nightmare walking through it. Any desire you had to buy anything will quickly disappear as dozens of men try every possible catch they have on you. These include: "You look lucky," "you look Egyptian," "come see my shop, no hassle," and guessing your nationality. But if you continue straight forward (north of Mostafa Kamel), passing by the garden, you will come to the real Souq, where the locals go shopping - and suddenly the atmosphere changes completely. While the local section is less clean, it is much busier and much more hassle-free, so you get to choose for yourself the merchants and wares to investigate.

Eat

Luxor is a vegetarian's paradise with lots of fresh seasonal vegetables such as tomato and cucumber.

A meal often begins with pita-bread and mezze such as baba ganoush or taboulé.

Your main course may include meat or poultry, or regional dishes such as pigeon or rabbit. (To avoid an upset stomach, you may prefer to stick with the beef.) As with any heavily touristed area in Egypt, it's never hard to find reasonably well-executed Western food. 

Dairy products, such as yoghurt or gibna bayda cheese (think feta but much creamier), might accompany your main meal.

Finally, many fine vegetarian desserts are available, though some might seem overly sweet to western tastes. (If you can, specify low or medium sweetness.)

While the evening meal is often filling, you may find this doesn't meet the energy requirements of a busy tourist. Be sure to eat a hearty breakfast, drink lots of water, and snack frequently during the day.

For restaurants by district, see:
*
*

On the road nearby television street and the train station are lots of fruit vendors - be sure to pick up some fruit that is delicious and cheap. These guys make an honest living with their shop and will not try to scam you. You will find the non-tourist part of Luxor to be very friendly and inviting, indicative of true Egyptian culture.

Drink

There is something of a social stigma attached to public drunkenness. Although Egyptians themselves sometimes choose to ignore this, for a foreigner to be drunk in public can give a bad impression. Most local pubs tend to be testosterone-filled hard-drinking dens where lone foreigners and especially lone women may feel uncomfortable.

That said, there are numerous places in Luxor to buy alcohol. Many restaurants, above the basic on the street places, sell lager and wine. They are generally made obvious by Stella signs outside or by having people drinking inside them. 
There are two open-air restaurants opposite the temple about 200m south of the main entrance which serve Stella lager for 14LE including tax (as of September 2011) and other local beer and wine for fairly reasonable prices. The huge Stella signs outside give them away. If you can't find somewhere convenient serving alcohol, it may be an idea to ask the staff in your hotel for directions. 'Cafeteria' can be the euphemistic name for a pub in Egypt, and pubs can be quite hard to find if you don't know exactly where to go.

The duty-free shop has moved (2014) from next to the Emilio Hotel (close to the north end of the Luxor Temple) to next to the Sheraton Hotel further south along the Nile. If you take your passport and go within two days of arriving in Egypt, up to three bottles of main-name spirits and beer, etc. at well-reduced prices, per person, can be bought. After the two days you can only buy the Egyptian equivalent. They also sell electrical products and close at 10pm.

To buy local Egytian beer and wine there are a handful of shops near the train station on Ramsees Street - they are easy to find as they have shelves full of wine and beer behind the counter. Prices in 2014 are 55LE+ for a bottle of wine, 10LE for beer, before haggling.

Drinking in the street or in parks, although fairly widely done by locals, is not recommended for foreigners as it is technically illegal and alcohol is generally cheap enough in restaurants anyway.

Sleep

Luxor has an extremely wide variety of accommodation options, from camping and hostels, right up to 5 star luxury hotels like the Old Winter Palace Hotel which is of extreme opulence and has played host to both movie stars and heads of state. In all Egypt, Luxor probably experiences the greatest seasonal variation in hotel rates - some hotels can be up to 50% cheaper (or more) in the low season (summer), others have no change.

Whilst the vast majority of accommodation options are to be found on the , an increasing number are to be found (and are being developed), however, on the more laid-back and isolated , close to the tombs and the Valley of the Kings. A lengthy stay in the area might benefit from staying on both sides of the river for some time.....

If you are arriving in Luxor by train or bus, beware the over-friendly and sometimes pushy hotel touts, especially at the station (these guys are a symptom of the sometimes fierce competition between rival hotels, especially at quiet times). Remember you don't owe them anything, but that they get 25-40% commission for convincing you to stay at their "cousin's" or "brother's" hotel, which is then added to your final bill. It's usually best to pre-book accommodation..... Also, use a map or a taxi to find your hotel - discourage attempts to guide you to your hotel, as you may end up somewhere else altogether, in the expectation that you will give in and stay where your "guide" has led you after all.

NB: Women travelling without company should exercise extreme caution whilst seeking budget accommodation in Luxor. Several reports have been made of sexual assault after women were given spiked drinks by hotel touts and staff.

On your first morning in Luxor, you may be woken at dawn by the adhan, or Muslim call to prayer. This normally lasts 5-10 minutes, and after a few days you will find yourself sleeping through it.
*Award-winning little hotel, tucked away in a quiet residential area behind the train station. The decor is arab/mamluk style and quite charming.

*This two bedroom apartment is situated on the 4th floor of a typical building where locals live, ideal for leisurely exploration of all that Luxor has to offer. It is air conditioned and offers spacious rooms furnished to accommodate up to four people. The accommodation comprises of a living room with comfortable settee, table and satellite TV. Bathroom with shower, a double room and a twin room with French doors leading to a small balcony. 
Grocery, fruit and vegetable shops are just few meters away, restaurants, pubs and coffee shops are within few minutes walking. Luxor airport is only 10-15 minutes away and if you wish your airport pick up can be arranged for you. Clothing can be laundered cheaply if requested. Trips and excursions can also be arranged for you. The owner who speaks English and has an extensive knowledge of the local area, antiquities, sites and activities, will be there to assist you throughout your stay if you require.

Stay safe
Luxor is known as the hassle capital of Egypt. For those not on fully organised tours, touts can make sightseeing very frustrating. However within temples, one must contend with the government tour guides who are legitimate government workers who aggressively "guide you" and then demand a tip. It may be worthwhile to give a small tip upfront then ask to "self tour". 
Pre-book accommodations ahead of time to avoid touts at the stations. Luxor taxis and the horse carriages are difficult to handle. They might agree for 10 EGP before the ride and ask you 300 EGP before you get down. Do be very careful with them. Tourist police are very helpful in handling these cases. Flag your voice or concern to them if you have any. 
Some of the older tricks in the book that you need to ignore are:
* The "I need a letter translated" opener, used to draw you into a shop
* The "I need a letter writing to my friend in your country" opener (they show you an address that's in your country), again used to draw you into a shop
* The alabaster factory. A large percentage of alabaster is imported, and is hardly made on site. The vast majority of other stones such as jade are imported from China and India.
* "The temple is closed"- Check opening times before you arrive. Find out on your own whether something is open or closed, whether you're walking the right way or not. Ask a local, not taxi or caleche driver.
* Papyrus Museum- It's just a papyrus shop, some are good, some use cheap imitations.
* Scarf seller - person selling usually just one scarf will attempt to use it to hide their hand movements while they pick pocket you. Reported two attempts in two days.
* I work in your hotel and saw you at breakfast this morning. Usually just trying to start a conversation to guide you towards a shop/restaurant that will give him a commission.
* Official ticket sale offices for temples, museums, etc. keep part of your change hoping you won't double check. This happened in about 95% of the main tourist attractions. At Karnak temple they pretend that their credit card machine is broken to force you to pay in cash, then keep part of your change. When visiting, 5 out of 5 people in a row were given the wrong change (April 2023).
* Supermarkets, train and bus stations, and any shop may also keep part of your change (50% chance).
* Menus in English with inflated prices. Some restaurant have their menu displayed in arabic with local prices, but will handle an English menu to tourist. This English menu prices can easily be 4 to 5 times higher. Using google translate's camera and/or learning the numbers in arabic is easy and will help.
* Hotel owners may try to add made up extra charges during your stay. If you've paid for your accomodation in advanced via a booking website you've probably paid already the total cost of your stay, and can either ignore the owner's requests for money or ask him to make the request through the booking site you used (which they won't do, since it's just a scam). Call the tourist police if the owner acts too agresively. It's also a good idea to kindly ask about the price of whatever they offer to you (laundry, water, a ride, etc), otherwise expect last minute inflated prices.
* Abusive fares for taxi rides. Charging extremely inflated prices to tourists is common practice in Egypt. The Egyptian Uber equivalent inDrive doesn't always work in the area (specially in the west bank), but introducing the start and end points in the app will display the suggested price for the ride. The app adds its own fees to the price, so you can start your taxi bargaining with a number slightly lower than the app's suggestion. 
* Taxi drivers never have change (except that they do). Most foreigners will just walk away without their change, hence drivers always claim they do not have change. It's best to carry small bills and give the exact amount. If you only have big bills, at the end of the ride you show the bill to the driver while asking if he has change. Do NOT handle any money until he shows you the change. Another option is to pretend you'll give them less money than the agreed: tell them that due to the nature of their business, any driver should always carry change, and the situation is not your fault. You'll see how quickly the driver finds change in his pocket.

Merchants in Luxor are notoriously aggressive and manipulative. Ignore them. In shops and the market, the phrase "no hassle" or "Laa Shukran", meaning no thanks in Arabic. Being polite will make your life easier, as people will remember you if you were rude and may hassle more later. If problems persist, threaten to call the tourist police. That being said, the luxor market actually has some of the best prices for souvenirs that you will find throughout Egypt.
Depending upon the perception your profile creates, you may be asked if you would like to purchase drugs or sex. Remember, prostitution and drug use are not taken lightly by government authorities.

Contact

See the various Luxor pages for details of telephone, internet and postal services - being a major tourist town, Luxor is extremely well-served with communication facilities.

Most of the best outlets are to be found where the bulk of the local population lives, in the of Luxor.

NB: As of August 2004, Luxor has had its telephone exchange upgraded and an additional "2" must now be added to old 6-digit telephone numbers..... The format for overseas callers, for example, should now be +20 95 2xxx xxx. Mobile phone numbers are unaffected by this change. As of June 2005, numbers on the west bank that began with 2426 now begin with 2060. So the format for these numbers is now +20 95 2060xxx rather than +20 95 2426xxx.

Get out

* &mdash; Luxor is a good base to this site of a fantastically well-preserved Ptolemaic temple of Hathor. A number of hotels organise such day-trips - you don't need to be staying with them to use these services.

* Go Bus offers really good fares and nice buses to Hurghada and Cairo. Buses leave from the front of the Go Bus office near the train station.

* For those with more time on their hands you can add a visit to the Temple of Seti I at , featuring some of the best relief work in Egypt. This is a lengthy road trip from Luxor, but can be combined with a day trip to . 

* The city is also a good staging post for onward travel through and on to and . There are regular trains to Aswan for about 10-15USD (second class-first class, April 2023). They are reluctant to sell 3rd class tickets to tourists. However there may be a slow cue at the train station's ticket office, and ticket officers speak very basic English (if any), so book a day ahead, or go at least 40min ahead of departure time.
