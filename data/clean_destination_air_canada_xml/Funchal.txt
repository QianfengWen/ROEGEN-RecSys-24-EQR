Stay safe
Funchal is usually a very safe city. However, as in any other places you go, common sense is required.
Probably the unsafest place to go in Funchal is Zona Velha (near the cable car) at night, because it usually gets very crowded because of the nightlife.
Of course crowded places don't mean you'll get robbed, but be careful as sometimes there are pickpockets there.
Beware the pickpockets there and don't go to abandoned dark alleys.

Get out
 - A wonderful quiet beach community, Porto Santo is a small island on the North-East of Madeira can be reached by either boat or plane. It is well worth a visit for its nice small restaurants, its long beach, and the Christopher Columbus house.
