Nashville is a city in Davidson County and the capital of the state of , as well as being the state's largest city. It is usually called the "Country Music Capital of the World" or more often "Music City, USA"; however, in recent years, Nashville has done much to escape its country music image and become a regional center of culture and commerce. In fact, Dell, Nissan, GM Motors, Amazon, AllianceBernstein, Bridgestone, UBS Financial Services, HCA, Community Health Services, Lyft, Google, and Microsoft have all moved some operations to or near the city. The music is various; major rap artists and rock bands (Young Buck, Haystak, Kings of Leon, Paramore, and Ben Folds) claim Nashville as their hometown. Nashville is also the epicenter of the contemporary Christian music industry. Nashville is also notable for line dancing as well.

Nashville is quickly becoming a fun and enjoyable American city, and is drawing the most tourists from out of the country out of any city in the United States. The New York Times gave Nashville the moniker of the "it" city, and the overall progressive and loving environment, along with the diverse $100 billion economy consisting of health care, music, tech and automotive industries, have made people want to visit and live alike in the music city. Nashville is an experience that many people across the United States and the World love and enjoy, and it is highly recommended to go and visit. 

Nashville has been the home of the world-famous Grand Ole Opry since 1925. The Opry has been located in the Grand Ole Opry House in eastern Nashville since 1974. From 1974 to 1997 the Opry House was part of a theme park called Opryland USA, which closed due to low attendance and was subsequently torn down and replaced with a mega-shopping mall called Opry Mills. Nashville also has a great bar scene. If you like to drink, you can go "Honky-tonking," also known as "bar-hopping." Recently Nashville has been called a top ten destination to visit in magazines such as Lonely Planet, New York Times, Conde Nast, and Travel and Leisure, and is quickly developing into a fun and cosmopolitan city.

Understand
History
Nashville was founded in 1779 and it grew rapidly because of its excellent location on the Cumberland River. It was incorporated in 1806 and became the county seat of Davidson County. Nashville was named the capital of Tennessee in 1843.

Like many Southern cities, Nashville was not immune to the economic woes of the post-Civil War South but it quickly rebounded. It only took a few years for the city to reclaim its important shipping and trading position and to develop a solid manufacturing base. The post-Civil War years of the late 19th century brought a new found prosperity to Nashville. These healthy economic times left the city with a legacy of grand classical-style buildings, which can still be seen around the downtown area.

Since the 1970s, the city has experienced tremendous growth, particularly during the economic boom of the 1990s under the leadership of Mayor (later-Tennessee Governor) Phil Bredesen, who made urban renewal a priority, and fostered the construction or renovation of several city landmarks, including the Country Music Hall of Fame, the Nashville Public Library downtown, Bridgestone Arena, and LP Field.

Currently as of 2015 Nashville is experiencing another economic boom with many national publications highlighting the authenticity and gentrification around the city. It is rapidly becoming more cosmopolitan and attracted the most increase in international tourism out of any US city for 2015, therefore the time is now to go and enjoy the Nashville experience.

See
Nashville is a very historic town and as such, many of its attractions are restorations or museums.

General

* An instantly recognizable downtown Nashville landmark, the AT&T Building, built in 1994 at 333 Commerce Street, is the tallest building in the state of Tennessee and can be seen from quite some distance if the hills aren't in your way. Its two tall spires on the building have earned it the nickname, "The Batman Building." 

* Located in the Vanderbilt University/West End area, midtown Nashville is replete with restaurants, art galleries, and landmark buildings such as the Parthenon in Centennial Park.

* Built between 1907 and 1909, the bridge was used for automobile traffic between East Nashville and Downtown. The bridge has recently been converted to a pedestrian bridge, and offers a spectacular view of the riverfront and downtown skyline. It is a very popular and convenient route to the Titan's football stadium.

* Nashville has a strong and historic association with the printing trade. Many religious and secular publications continue to be headquartered in the city. This alley in downtown is where many traditionally set up shop in the 1800s. It is also the location of Nashville's historic red light district. Today there is a fun mix of restaurants, bars, and adult entertainment. Considered an after hours hot spot in the city. 

Country Music
* Regularly changing exhibits and live performances make this Nashville landmark someplace to visit often. The original Country Music Hall of Fame was built in 1967 and lasted until 2000 when they moved into their new $37 million dollar location. Ticket packages for guided or audio tours also available, as well as combining a tour with the RCA Studio B and the Ryman Auditorium. Since 1972, the Country Music Awards have attracted fans from around the world to Nashville. CMA Music Festival packages are among the most popular CMA attractions. 

*Pictures and memorabilia from the life of Johnny Cash.

* Revealed in 2003, Musica is a 38 foot tall sculpture featuring 9 nude dancing figures created by Alan Lequire and is in a roundabout in the heart of Music Row. 

History/Government

*Featuring the mansion built in 1853 and restored, as well as the carriage house from 1890 and one of the oldest log cabins in Tennessee, built in 1790. There is a great deal of history associated with the plantation starting from before the American Civil War. Excellent, highly interesting guided tours of the plantation mansion are offered by the local heritage society.
 
*The largest urban land reclamation in the US undertaken when it was created in the 1990s. A fascinating state park stretched out in front of the state capital building. Features a giant map of the state, monuments recounting the history of the state since prehistoric times, a carillon, and more. In the summer, the fountains are often filled with splashing kids. The park is located right next to the farmers market, which includes a food court, fish market, nursery, as well as the expected vendors hawking fruits and vegetables. The Nashville Business Journal's Book of Lists ranks Bicentennial Capital Mall State Park as Nashville's #1 Tourist Attraction. 

* An approximate one hour guided tour of 16 rooms in the mansion. Also walk the grounds to examine the marble statues and cast iron ornaments in the gardens.

* A civil-war era fort partially reconstructed by the Works Progress Administration in the 1930s. Taken by Union forces early in the war, Nashville quickly became second most fortified city in the U.S. during the Civil War because it was seen as crucial to supplying troops engaged on the war's western front. The 1864 Battle of Nashville -- a failed attempt by the Confederate army to retake the city -- raged throughout what are now the residential and commercial districts on the fringes of the city. Much of the work on the fort was done by slaves and freed blacks who were rounded up and forced to work on the structure. The fort was closed for years (allegedly because it reminded many Nashvillians of the Union occupation), but reopened in 2004 with new boardwalks and interpretive signs. 

* A recreation of the original settlement of the city. Located on the banks of the Cumberland River, just behind the Second Avenue entertainment district. A riverwalk on both sides of the river is adjacent. 

* The former home of U.S. President Andrew Jackson is full of his family's personal possessions, and is adorned with much of the furniture that they personally purchased. It was one of the first historic preservation projects in the state of Tennessee. This was accomplished by the Ladies' Hermitage Association which was modeled after the Mount Vernon Ladies Association that had restored George Washington's home. Plan for a two hour tour with a moderate amount of walking. No cameras, video cameras, food, or drink are allowed within the Hermitage or the exhibit gallery. Security precautions are taken and the Hermitage asks that all backpacks or large bags be left in your vehicle.

*Architect William Strickland created this masterpiece of Neoclassical architecture. Completed in 1859, it took 14 years to build. During the course of the project Strickland died. Strickland considered it his finest project and he is buried within the building. The capitol was renovated in the early 2000s and clearing years of smoke stains revealed magnificent ceiling paintings. A must-visit. 

* With over 70,000 square feet of exhibit space, this is one of the nation's largest state museums. Its permanent exhibits are split into several categories, including: Prehistoric, Frontier, Age of Jackson, Antebellum, Civil War, and Reconstruction. The State Museum is currently closed, and a new building is being built on Jefferson Street. This building will take the place of the old location of Deadrick Street.

*Often called "Nashville's Walden," Radnor Lake was formed when the railroad companies dammed up a small stream to provide a reliable water source for their railroad yards.

As members of the Southeastern Conference they compete with a wide range of colleges and universities throughout the southeast United States. The Commodores consistently hold their own in the SEC despite being perennial underdogs in most sports, as Vanderbilt is the SEC's only private school and easily the conference's smallest school by enrollment. The best-known Vanderbilt sports venues are Vanderbilt Stadium, home to the football team, and Memorial Gymnasium, home to the men's and women's basketball teams and one of the most unique settings in the sport.

Although the OVC sponsors football in the second-level FCS, Belmont does not have a football team.

Even though they are no longer in the same conference, the men's and women's teams still play one another twice each season.
** Teams representing Tennessee State University, a historically black public school. The Tigers play alongside Belmont in the OVC; unilke Belmont, TSU has a football team.
** Teams representing Middle Tennessee State University, located in Murfreesboro. The Blue Raiders play FBS football in Conference USA.

Eat
Nashville has a great food scene, with Zagat rating it in the top 5 up and coming American food cities, but does not abandon Southern traditional favorites. Hot Chicken is a dish that originated here that has recently gained national attention and is a must for anyone looking to experience something unique to the city. Nashville is a great barbecue city, ranked number 6 by USnews and ranked number 1 by Travel and Leisure. Unlike nearby Memphis and North Carolina, however, Nashville does not have a particular style or cut of meat that defines its style, making it somewhat like a Southern Kansas City, and combining all different types of flavors to create a one of a kind barbecue taste.

Budget

*James Beard award winning meat in three that is a Nashville staple. Open for lunch only.

*What began as a legendary food truck, this charming brick and mortar "hole in the wall" location can be found at 732 McFerrin St, in East Nashville. Cult following trek to feast on the chicken, fish or pork taco's but the restaurant shines with it's authentic and homemade Mexico City Style Tortilla Soup! Sunday brunch features spicy Mexican Hot Chocolate and Mexican pastries. Bring cash and be willing to share a table and a glass of aqua fresca with some hipsters!.

*They may not be the original Nashville Hot Chicken but Hattie B's has become one of the most popular destinations for fiery fowl in the city. Two locations, Midtown and West Nashville.

*It's an open-air 2-level arcade that runs between 4th Avenue North and 5th Avenue North. The Arcade primarily caters to the local downtown workers during the work week, but many great lunch restaurants can be found here, including Manny's House of Pizza, Phillip's Deli, and others. There are also several hairstylists, jewelers, florists, and other businesses. Be sure to visit the historic Peanut Shop.

*An endearingly dingy 50s ice cream stand on Charlotte Ave., recently revived into a popular summer mainstay that's popular with every demographic. Their hamburgers, hot dogs, and fries are some of Nashville's favorites, and the strawberry shortcake's great. New location opened downtown on 4th Avenue. 

*The birthplace of Nashville Hot Chicken, a dish that demands national attention for its spicy kick and delicious flavor. Prince's started it all with the owner's famously hot chicken drawing the attention of crowds not just in Nashville but across the entire country.

*Established in 1993, La Hacienda Taqueria has continually been making statements and catching the notoriety as Nashville's finest authentic Mexican restaurant.

*This diner-coffeeshop is divey, friendly, cheap, greasy, and as southern as white gravy on fried chicken. Perfect if you're drunk or a night owl, which most of the other customers here are (except at breakfast, which draws a mix of polite older couples and hungover kids). An ancient cigarette machine and a well-stocked jukebox.

*Located in historic Germantown, Monell's is a Nashville tradition. They serve different meals every day and the good ol' home cookin' is sure not to disappoint! Seating and serving are done family style, 13-14 per table. More than likely you will sit with people you don't know. It is expected that you enjoy the company and meet new friends. First come, first serve. No reservations and no cell phones allowed.

*A pretty good Mexican place. You can get a nice filling meal here for under ten bucks. There are several locations:

2615 Franklin Pike, +1 615 292-1902.
1905 Hayes St, +1 615 322-9588.
15560 Old Hickory Blvd, +1 615 831-0432‚Äé,
Ste 105, 6688 Nolensville Rd, Brentwood, +1 615 941-4756,
5511 Charlotte Pike, +1 615 352-0313

* Save room after your Mexican meal for Las Paletas' homemade popsicles in exotic flavors! The Paz sisters ate them often when growing up in Mexico and have now brought us their own take on the treats. Hibiscus, basil, chocolate jalapeno, and rose petal are all delicious; so are the tamer versions, like mango, raspberry, chai tea, chocolate chip cookie, and Mexican caramel.

*Fabulous pizza, quite simply. Nashville isn't much of a town for pizza, but this place more than makes up for it. The plain slices are great, but even the fancier ones (like the Fantasy) don't gild the lily. Free liva jazz Thursday nights at the 21st Ave. location (between Vandy and Hillsboro Village); there's another smaller shop on Granny White/12th Ave. across from Lipscomb.

*An old, friendly neighborhood joint whose hamburger and milkshake are consistently voted the best in Nashville. Get the grilled version of the cheeseburger -- basically a grilled cheese with a hamburger in it.

*They have a basic menu that would satisfy most any Indian food craving and at $6.49 for a plate FULL of food, you won't go wrong.

*Amazing southern Indian food. Very long menu, but the servers are helpful. The specials are a good sampler.

Mid-range
* Blackstone Restaurant & Brewery, 1918 West End Avenue, Nashville, +1 615 327-9969, In the heart of Nashville's Midtown at 19th Ave & West End, one mile from central downtown area. Hours: Friday & Saturday 11am - 1am; Monday - Thursday 11am - midnight; Sunday Noon to 10pm. Nashville's first Microbrewery and full menu and bar. Local award winning beers. 

* Cafe Nonna, 4427 Murphy Rd, +1 615 463-0133, Another well-liked Italian restaurant, this intimate neighborhood place keeps its menu small and its dishes impeccably prepared. With the fresh ingredients and simple preparation, you might as easily be in some Tuscan hill town. Located in Sylvan Park.
 
* Demos, 300 Commerce St, +1 615 256-4655, Located in Downtown Nashville, this steakhouse is named the best in Nashville by Reader's Choice. A 6-ounce with any side or a bowl of a special spaghetti is around $10, and 10 & under meals are around $4. Drinks $1.80. Comes with unlimited bread refills. No special dress code.

* Don't miss this authentic Tennessee barbecue joint right beside the Ryman Auditorium. Located on Lower Broadway -- just look for the neon sign featuring flying pigs! Also at 334 West Trinity Lane, +1 615 228-9888.

* Maggiano's Little Italy, 3106 West End Ave, (a few blocks south of Vanderbilt University), +1 615 514-0270 (fax: +1 615 514-0271, carryout: +1 615 514-0275, banquet: +1 615 514-0280), A busy Italian restaurant, serving Southern Italian meals, most famously in "family style", portions that are more than large enough to share. Reservations recommended for parties of any size. Open for lunch and dinner, seven days. 

* Pancake Pantry, 1796 21st Ave S, +1 615 383-9333, A Nashville landmark and basically the best place in town for breakfast, anytime before 3PM. The frosted haired waitresses will call you "honey," and the pancakes will be better than you'd ever realized pancakes could be. Don't be daunted by the line snaking around the block on weekends; it moves quickly, and you get free coffee while you wait.

* Rosepepper Grille and Cantina, 1907 Eastland Ave, +1 615 227-4777, A neighborhood favorite for several years now, this popular and upbeat nouveau Mexican place is in East Nashville, a bit off the tourist's beaten path.

* San Antonio Taco Company, or SATCO, 416 21st Ave S, +1 615 327-4322, Always a favorite with Vandy kids, offering reliably so-so Tex-Mex food (very little meat on the tacos, and the guacamole has tons of pepper) and cheap buckets of beer. Right off the Vanderbilt campus. Stop by Ben & Jerry's next door for dessert. Caveat: Towing in this area can be ruthless. Check the signs wherever you park. If you go, get the queso and chips for around $3. It's the best thing on the menu and is enough for 2.

Splurge

* Margot. This quirky local restaurant at Five Points in East Nashville is considered by many to be Nashville best local chef owned restaurant. It features a seasonal menu that is changed daily. Don't miss the seasonal hot chocolate topped with a homemade marshmallow for an after-dinner treat.

One of the longest standing members of the fine dining scene in Nashville, many of the top chefs in the city got their start here. Located in the Historic Hermitage hotel, you will see many of Tennessee's industry, political, and cultural leaders here. Also remember to check out the famous art deco men's washroom.

Once a speakeasy, later a hangout for Jimmy Hoffa, now host to a strange mix of local drunks, slumming Vandy kids, and musicians. Pool table, arcade games, good jukebox, good booker, a cheap beer-only bar, and a large screened-in cement block porch. Don't miss its regular Working Stiffs Jamboree. 
* A bit of a time warp, especially located in the middle of the now trendy Gulch area of 12th Ave. Its excellent bluegrass and old-time Americana shows have drawn loyal patrons for decades. 
*TailGate Beer started brewing in Nashville in 2014. The Charlotte Pike location is a large facility that includes a taproom, outdoor shed, and the brewery itself. The taproom serves pizza (half price on Mondays) and beers during normal business hours. Check the website for special events throughout the year.
* Intimate (read: cramped); owner and man-around-town Mike Grimes books everything from country singer-songwriters to young noise bands. Above the venue is Grimey's, his record store that consistently is voted best independent record store in Nashville. A non-smoking, 21+ club.

Stay safe
Be careful and use good sense as you would anywhere else when visiting Nashville, TN. Although it is good to be cautious, in recent years it has been called one of the most livable places in the United States via magazines such as the New York Times and Travel and Leisure

North Nashville, the Bordeaux district, Is a VERY dangerous area that should be avoided at all costs, and contributes to over 90% of Nashville‚Äôs violent crime statistics. Always use caution when driving any area at night. Napier, Antioch and the Inglewood areas also are high in crime, but still relatively safe compared to North Nashville

While crime still does exist in the city, much of it has been either eliminated or concentrated to far away areas.
Unlike other downtown areas in similar cities such as Memphis, Downtown Nashville has become very safe, with rarely any crime reported due to the rapid development of the main road Broadway, and other areas such as the Gulch, SoBro, Germantown and West End. However, be cautious as you would be in any other city in terms of pickpocketing, small theft and sexual harassment and do not show off any overly valuable items while walking around. The Nashville Metro Police department has been praised as one of the best police forces in America due to their non-confrontational nature, so feel free to ask them for help.
