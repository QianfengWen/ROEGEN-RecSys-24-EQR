Karlsruhe is a city on the Rhine in in . It is in the north of the Black Forest, close to the French border.

Understand

The city was founded in 1715 by margrave Karl Wilhelm von Baden. The city was laid out on the drawing board. It consists of a central circle, containing the castle, and streets running towards the castle as radial "spokes". This pattern is still visible today. Due to the fan-like layout, Karlsruhe is known as the "fan city" (Fächerstadt).

The Rhine valley, where Karlsruhe is located, is the warmest part of Germany because it is only about 115 m above sea level and there are mountains in the east (black forest) and west (vogesen). Therefore, Karlsruhe has more sunny days than many other parts of Germany.

There isn't a lot of tourist traffic to Karlsruhe. Tourists generally tend to gravitate towards the cities of (50km to the north) and (100km to the south), with their well-preserved old towns. It's a shame though, as Karlsruhe's radial layout is one of the best early examples of New Urbanism, and is really a joy to explore. Maybe that's a benefit to travelers who do venture there, as the number of visitors is low enough to be sort of a novelty for the locals.

Karlsruhe is home to the two highest federal courts of Germany, the Bundesverfassungsgericht (Federal constitutional court) and the Bundesgerichtshof (Supreme federal court). Because of this and other administrative facilities, Karlsruhe has a reputation as a city of civil servants.

Karlsruhe has a large technical university, as well as several other colleges. The presence of the technical university has promoted the city somewhat in the world of Free and Open Source Software: Karlsruhe was the home of LinuxTag until 2005.

Get around
* On foot: A lot to see in Karlsruhe is along Kaiserstrasse. Because all the streets radiate outward, the Marktplatz is a great place to start a walking tour of the city. If you go up or down Kaiserstrasse, you will find a great variety of shops and restaurants on both sides of the streets. If you go towards the Palace (right in front of you if you're in the Marktplatz), you can visit the city museum inside the castle, or the park right behind it, where the people of Karlsruhe congregate to picnic, play sports, and relax on nice days. Go farther and you can take a walk into the "Hardtwald" which has a lot of trails right near the city center. Go south relative to the Marktplatz and you will soon come upon Ettlinger Tor and the Staatstheater. Exploring on foot allows you the opportunity to go down the allees and smaller streets in Karlsruhe where you can find a wonderful variety of shops, kneipes, and restaurants.

* Public transport: Karlsruhe has an excellent public transportation system called KVV; its mostly built on tram-trains(stadtbahn).This allows trains to run on tram track within the city or on railway track to serve the surrounding areas.An overview of the entire transport network can be downloaded here A single ticket for a trip within the city limits costs 2.40€ for adults, 1.40€ for kids. Most tickets have to be stamped upon entering a tram and controllers are quite frequent. In particular, for longer distances outside of Karlsruhe buying the right ticket can be a bit challenging, but in front of the main train station as well as located at Marktplatz, you will find a KVV office that will be happy to assist you. Trains run late into the night, in particular on weekends, but almost every line stops for a few hours every night. Schedules and maps are posted on virtually every station: you can also find more information on fares and timetables on the KVV homepage 

* Rental bikes: During the summer, spring and autumn rental bikes are available throughout the city. A mobile phone is used to rent a bike and it can be 'returned' (again, using the mobile phone) at any inner city corner.

See

The museum is quite unique, and the exhibitions are world-class. The ZKM also hosts many cultural events, check their home page for the schedule. The same complex also hosts the Museum für Neue Kunst (Museum for new Art) and the city gallery. 

* Staatliche Kunsthalle (Art Hall of the State), Hans-Thoma-Straße 2 - 6, (0721) 926-3355 Tu-F 10AM-5PM, Sat, Sun, holidays 10AM-6PM. This museum shows mainly classical paintings from the 16th century on.

* A list of other museums can be found on the city homepage 

* Badisches Staatstheather, Baumeisterstr. 11, (0721) 933-333 (Reservations) is the biggest theater and opera house in the city, but there are various smaller theaters. A list can be found on the city homepage.

* Cinemas: The Schauburg and the Kino im Prinz-Max-Palais are independent cinemas which occasionally show movies in their original language. The other cinemas tend to stick to the usual German-dubbed fare. Schauburg, Marienstr. 16, (0721) 3500018. Kino im Prinz-Max-Palais, Karlstr. 10, (0721) 9374714 (Information).

* Palace, directly north of the city center. The palace hosts the Badisches Landesmuseum, Tu-Th 10AM-17PM, F-Su and holidays 10AM-6PM, special exhibitions Tu-Su 10AM-6PM. The palace is directly north of the city center, a 2min walk on foot from the Marktplatz. The palace was rebuilt after World War II, and now hosts the Badisches Landesmuseum, a museum dedicated to historical exhibitions and local interest. There are also special exhibitions from time to time. North of the palace is a vast park area, the palace garden (Schlosspark), where the locals hang out on summer days. On Saturdays, Sundays and holidays during the summer season you can also take a ride on the small train that runs through the gardens. Steam trains usually run on Sundays while dieselpowered trains operate on Saturdays. Entry to the gardens is free, the museum is &euro;4 for adults.

* There are several man-made lakes in towns around (10-20 km) Karlsruhe, e.g. Epplesee in Rheinstetten (no BBQ allowed!) and in Weingarten and Untergrombach. Going by bike is a flat one-hour trip by bicycle, and swimming combined with a barbecue is a nice thing on a hot summer day.

* The Pyramid - on the Marktplatz, and the emblem of the city. It marks the place where Karl Wilhelm was buried, and is somewhat unremarkable.

* Zoo - near the main station, opening hours vary throughout the year, but the main entrance is open at least M-Su 9AM-16PM, and longer in the summer months. The other entrances have shorter hours, check on the web page. The zoo is moderately large, and does have some special attractions. The price is &euro;6.50. In the Zoo, there is an artificial mountain (the Lauterberg), and a memorial for the 49° N parallel. You can also ride small boats ("gondolettas") in the lake. A so-called water organ (music and fountains) plays every 30 minutes.

* Durlach Nowadays a part of Karlsruhe it is much older (first mentioned in the 12th century) than Karlsruhe itself and has a charming medieval town-center. It can be easily reached by tram 1 in a quarter of an hour. A word of advice: calling an inhabitant of Durlach a "Karlsruher" is asking for trouble. From the Turmberg (tower hill), you have a nice view over the city and the Rhine valley.
*The stadium where the Karlsruher Sport Club (KSC) plays all of their home games. If you are in Karlsruhe in the Fall or Spring, during the Bundesliga season, you should try to catch a KSC game during the weekend. KSC fans, including the "Ultras", are some of the loudest and most passionate fans in all of German football, and definitely make the experience a good one. To really get in the action purchase a ticket in the 'Stehplatz' (Standing section) and try to buy early, as these are very popular events and the tickets go quickly!

* Kombilösung: This controversial project refers to the combination of a tram tunnel in Kaiserstrasse and a road tunnel in Kriegsstraße, allegedly the solution (Lösung) for public transport capacity problems in Karlsruhe. There is an information pavillon near the Staatstheater, and in the coming years there will be lots of construction in the city. Not a sight as such, but interesting for public transport geeks.
*The suburb Dammerstock has a residential area in the Bauhaus style, planned i.a. by the renowned architect Walter Gropius.
* Go cycling. The city has developed a 20 point plan to become the cycling city in Germany. Many bike lanes and good direction signs for cyclicts are a visible mark. However, the activists of VCD and ADFC will be able to point out weaknesses and dangerous spots.

* The city lists Karlsruhe's cultural heritage in a database: 
*Here can be found lots of interesting animals also plants. Ideal to see with children. 
*A retro games non-profit organization that houses a museum with over 70 original arcade machines, which is open to the public every first Tuesday of the month (19:00) and every Saturday starting at 20:00. Entrance fee is around 5.00 €, and once inside the machines in display can be played without additional charge.

Eat
What to eat (if you want to try something typical):
* Flammkuchen: kind of similar to pizza, but with a a much thinner pastry and topped with sour cream instead of tomato sauce. Most typical toppings are onions and bacon, but there are many variants (in particular some very tasty sweet ones that come flambéed). Just order one after the other (they get cold very fast), always sharing each one with everyone on the table.
* Käsespätzle: a special kind of pasta in a heavy cheese sauce. 
* Gebratene Maultaschen: kind of like Ravioli, but much larger and fried with onions. May sound strange, but you really can't do much wrong with these. 
* Wurstsalat: Sausage Salad; well, its Germany after all. Comes with bread and is really quite tasty.
* Hackepeter: Raw minced meat with fresh onions and bread. You don't get this very often (but for example at Vogelbräu).
* Yufka Döner: A kind of döner but a wrap is used instead of proper bread. Sold in dozens of places it is probably the cheapest way to get a complete meal. 

Where to eat:
* Kräuterküche a small, modern German restaurant that offers a small selection of good food created in front of your eyes with fresh, biological ingredients. Its a good idea to call ahead and reserve a table. (Ritterstraße 10)
* Die Kippe is one of the most typical student pubs in Karlsruhe. It offers cheap greasy food in a nice atmosphere. During the summer time they have a nice beer garden. Among other meals they serve a few regional foods. (Gottesauer Straße 23)
* ViVA Restaurant offers vegetarian and vegan food in the city center. (Lammstraße 7a)
* Shogun is a good place to eat Sushi. (Zähringerstraße 96)
* Pizzahaus is an Italian restaurant with good pizza. (Rintheimer Straße 2)
* Vogelbräu Karlsruhe is a beer garden, restaurant and brewery. You get good beer and German food here, really a nice place for lunch, dinner or drinking. There are two more 'Vogelbräu' restaurants in the nearby towns of Ettlingen and Durlach (Kapellenstraße 50)
*Two restaurants owned by the same purveyor that runs "Die Kippe". Both have the same menu as Die Kippe, but different atmospheres. (Bleu is at Kaiserallee 11 and Emaille at Kaiserstrasse 142) All three restaurants are as described above, and always a nice place to grab breakfast, a drink with friends, or a quick meal without breaking the bank.
*A very modern restaurant that strives to offer healthy fast-food from fresh ingredients. It offers mostly curries, soups and a large selection of salads. 
* Stoevchen (engl little oven) is a great place to try Flammkuchen and relax with a cocktail or two
* Panda, Scheffelstrasse 2 (on the crossroads between Kaiserallee and Scheffelstrasse), is a food stall serving authentic Chinese food at about €6 per meal.
*A Chinese restaurant on the center of Karlsruhe, well frequented and recommended by Chinese immigrants. Traditional dishes from different parts of china. It is best enjoyed by groups, so that you eat Chinese style, sharing the dishes. This restaurant can also be found on the Passagehof 28.

Drink
* Badisch Brauhaus is a very large multi-story beer garden, brewery and restaurant. On its uppermost floor is a cocktail bar; probably the nicest place in Karlsruhe for cocktails (although on weekends it can be difficult to get a seat and service can be slow). (Stephanienstr. 38-40)
* Hoepfner - like other cities in Germany, Karlsruhe has a few regional brands of beer, of which Hoepfner is the most famous. There is a brewery and Beer Garden at the east site of the town. It is also worth exploring the microbreweries scattered around the city, such as the Vogelbraeu, Wolf Brauerei and the Badische Brauhaus, all of which have seasonal specialities.
* Alter Brauhof - a nice place to sit outside and have a beer (only a good place in summer), also offers decent food. Its not so well known, so you stand a good chance of finding a nice place even on a nice summer evening even on weekends. (Beiertheimer Allee 18a) 
* Carambolage - Special club in the near of the university and maybe the only place of the city where you can go out until 5AM during the week.
*A bar run by local university students that is frequented by the Karlsruhe's student population. There are several local beers offered here for very cheap (think 1 - 1.50 euro) and also decent cocktails. Bands are frequently playing on saturdays (no entry fee) and visitors can play cards, board games and table soccer with other patrons. Check the website for hours as the bar is generally only open when school is in session.
*Scruffy's is Karlsruhe's best Irish Pub. The interior of the bar is reminiscent of the hold of an old ship and is a comfortable environment. There are a variety of beers and whiskeys, as well as good Irish music every week. Often the owner's band will play, always a treat. The bartenders and some of the patrons are native English speakers, so it's a good place to let the tourist's brain relax after speaking a lot of German! Just make sure you keep a good count on how many beers you order the owner occasionally miscounts. (Karlstr. 4, Across from the Europaplatz)
*The Dorfschänke is Karlsruhe's oldest Kneipe, and a good place to meet up with people. With the normal selection of beers and drinks, this is also a good place to see bands or to watch soccer outside during the summer. There is also a fairly popular "Kicker" (or Foos-ball to us Americans) table inside where you can pick up a game or two. Be prepared to pay cover on nights when bands are playing. (Am Künstlerhaus 33 )
* Agostea is a nice but pricy club near the Kronenplatz with 2 dancefloors.

"Leonardo's Expresso Bar" directly located in the Center of Karlsruhe in the Zaehringerstrasse. There you can enjoy original Italian Coffee, good cocktails and also a lot of wines. The bar is a smoker Bar with a seperated room where you can smoke cigars. The Bar is also offering many cigars from around the world. The prices are okay. The personel is speaking English. The Leonard, or also called Leo is one of the political Bars in Karlsruhe. High ranking Officials from the City, the Courts, the University and the Party are there often seen.
*A small and pleasant bar and home of the Bierdiplom (4 litres) & Vorbierdiplom (2.6 litres), a "tour around the barrel" where guests pay in advance and get to drink 12 of the beers on offer in various quantities. There is a simple ruleset but the bar is very flexible. It makes for a fantastic evening for beer enthusiasts. Opening times vary, so you'll need to plan well.

Buy

Most shops are located in the pedestrian zone in the Kaiserstrasse. At Ludwigsplatz, near Kaiserstrasse, there are various open-air cafes where the shopper can relax. Some of the more expensive boutiques and shoe shops are also located in this area.
In the south of the Marktplatz, at the end of the pedestrian zone, is a big shopping mall called "Ettlinger Tor". Definitely an alternative to the Kaiserstrasse, especially when the weather is bad.

Sleep

* Two furnished guestrooms for 1-3 guests in one of Karlsruhe's historical districts.

Stay safe

Karlsruhe is maybe one of the safest cities in Germany especially the centre of the town. There are a lot of policemen walking and driving around, mainly because of the important courts. Maybe some center suburbs should be avoided at night, but otherwise, one will feel safe in this city.
