Understand

In addition to being 's most populous province, it is also a major tourist destination, especially around the . Most of the population, more than 90% resides in the four regions that make up Southern Ontario, which covers a much smaller land area than the expansive north making it worlds apart in topography and local culture. Ontario can provide the visitor with access to Canada's most populous city, Toronto; the world's largest fresh water lake, Lake Superior; and even a polar bear park in the arctic circle due to its massive size. While the majority is clearly English speaking, one will find historic French speakers and some signage in French, many other immigrant languages in the greater Toronto area in addition to First Nations people's native tongues still being spoken.

Get in
By plane
Most visitors arrive in Ontario by way of Toronto's Lester B. Pearson International Airport in (just outside of , in the metro area). The airport is a major hub for most Canadian air carriers. If your ultimate destination is in Southern Ontario, you will likely pass through Pearson at some point. Many flights from overseas will land in Toronto, and daily flights are available from many Canadian cities and most American hubs.

For destinations in Eastern Ontario and the , flights from within Canada, from the United States, and the United Kingdom are also available to . Many American hubs have daily direct flights into Ottawa.

In Southern Ontario, there are airports at , , , and which are served by Air Canada and/or WestJet to various Canadian destinations (but most commonly only to ). There is also an airport at which is served by Delta Air Lines to Detroit and WestJet to Calgary. If you are going to Windsor, you will land at Metro Airport just across the border.

If you plan to travel to Northwestern Ontario or the region, then International Airport would be your best bet. Air Canada has direct flights from Toronto and Winnipeg, to name a few, and Westjet has flights from Hamilton and Winnipeg.

By car
Driving from the USA, border crossings include: International Falls, Minn. to Fort Frances, Ontario; Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan to , Ontario; Port Huron, Michigan to , Ontario; Detroit, Michigan to , Ontario; Buffalo, NY to , Ontario; to ; to ; to .

If you are coming from , the southern routes are TransCanada Highways 20 and 40. 20 connects to the 401 (a direct route to ) and 40 connects to 417 (heading to ). If your intentions are Northerly, the Ottawa route is the most direct.

From , there really is only one option by car (unless you are coming via the USA), and that option is TransCanada Highway 1, which connects to 17 in Ontario.

By bus
AVMMAX2000 Charters is a Toronto (Ontario, Canada) based Charter Bus Rental company with 20 years of experience providing comfortable chartered bus rental services to anywhere in North America.

By train
Within Canada, VIA Rail Canada is the most common way to enter Ontario by train. It is not unheard of to enter Ontario from the USA by train, but the customs waits between the USA and Canada are no different than might be expected by car or plane. 

Get around
By car
Ontario is a large province and, as a result, the car is nearly the most convenient way to explore it. If you are arriving by plane initially, cars are easily rented if you are over 23, but easiest if you are over 25 years of age. Despite what you may have been led to believe, there is more to Ontario than Southern Ontario and (or , or , or whatever), and driving to and through the vast and varied regions of Ontario can be an adventure. Coming from the USA, your options are numerous.

In , the car is a must if you wish to get from place to place. In most cases, you will be driving the TransCanada Highway (a cross-Canada network of highways, often offering more than one route), either on Highway 17 or Highway 11. 17 follows a more Southerly route hugging Lake Superior, while 11 ventures Northward at and heads through a slightly less populous region of the province before heading southwards. Do note that 11 and 17 come together in the region. To the west, 11 heads to its end at and the USA, while 17 heads up to lead to .

Even by car, you will be unable to access the Northern half of Ontario. Roads are the exception, not the rule, and you will rely on plane and train nearly anywhere north of Lake Nipigon.

Speed limits are posted in metric. Roadways are usually in good condition. On major highways, drivers routinely exceed the speed limit by 20 to 49 km/h despite the threat of hefty fines. Anyone caught exceeding the speed limit by 50 km/h or more, or making certain undesirable driving manoeuvres such as racing, preventing others from passing or rushing to turn left on a fresh green light before the oncoming lanes have moved, can be hit with an automatic fine between $2000 and $10,000, a seven-day license suspension and a seven-day vehicle impound.

Lane discipline by drivers is considered mediocre at best. Although it is widely known that passing should be only done on the leftmost lanes, drivers routinely pass on the rightmost lanes, mostly due to slower drivers failing to change lanes to the rightmost lanes. 

Ontario has High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes on Highway 403 and 404. Cars and even motorcycles require at least two occupants per vehicle to use them around the clock. If you are coming from the USA, remember that motorcycles without passengers are banned from Ontario HOV lanes. It is different from most USA HOV lanes allowing motorcycles, even if without passengers.

By bus
Within the Greater Toronto Area (which includes a large portion of the area around Toronto) you can use GO Transit Fares are calculated by distance, much like regular intercity transport. This is good mode of public transit between cities and towns in this region. GO Transit mostly serves daily commuters into Toronto, and service is most frequent during the early morning and late afternoon. Some routes are served by train during certain hours.

Drink

In Ontario, the legal drinking age is 19. In Southern Ontario, you will find a great variety of beer and spirits at your disposal, while in Northern Ontario your options are usually limited to the most common North American standards. Do take note that drinking in public is discouraged by law in Ontario and most parts of Canada, exceptions being licensed patios and the like.

Where
Beer is available from the Beer Store (run by Molson, Labatt and Sleeman), while beer, wine and other alcohol is available from the Liquor Control Board of Ontario commonly called the LCBO, (run by the government). In Northern Ontario, you will typically only see the LCBO (and this will also be the case in some rural areas of Southern Ontario). Beer is also available for purchase in most major grocery store chains (such as Sobeys, Loblaw, Metro, etc). You will never find alcohol in convenience stores in Ontario. You can also buy wine at the Wine Rack in some areas. Alcohol may not be easily available outside of LCBO and Beer Store hours, so stock up on alcohol ahead of holidays and store closures. Beer may also be purchased at breweries.

Of course, pubs and bars are no rarity in Ontario. In nearly every community you will enter, you will be able to find at least one tavern or bar. A domestic bottled beer will typically cost around $3.50 and a cocktail-type drink around $4.50 or higher. Expect the prices to vary, with prices being much higher in urban centres. Drinks are served "smart-serve" in Ontario, so they will never be made free-pour, every (single) serving of liquor, beer and wine have the same amount of alcohol (though in reality, particularly strong beers or wines will have more alcohol per serving)

Beer

*Amsterdam Brewing Co. based in

Wine
The Niagara region, home to and , is Ontario's premier wine-production region. Wine is also produced at 13 wineries in and , Canada's most southern point. 

Ontario has a comparatively young wine industry that is expanding rapidly. Ontario, and Canada in general, is renowned for its consistent and unique ice wines. It is also gaining increasing recognition for its world-class premium table wines.

It's wine regions are right in the middle of the northern grape-growing belt – between 41° and 44° north. That puts southern Ontario just south of the famous Bordeaux Region in France, and parallel with northern California wine regions. Ontario is considered a "cool climate region" – which means at harvest time grapes are blessed with more concentrated flavours and balanced acidity which makes them wonderfully food friendly. That's why cooler climate wines typically have a livelier flavour than those from hotter climates. 

The Vinters Quality Association (VQA) is an association of wineries that provide insight into the quality of Ontario wines. When purchasing wine made in Ontario, look for a "VQA" logo on the bottle - this tells you the wine has been approved by the association. Keep in mind that there are still many wines that are not certified, but lack of certification does not necessarily mean a poor wine.

Smoke

In Canada, marijuana is legal. However, buying, selling, cultivating (for non-medical use) and smoking marijuana in public is regulated. Tourists are advised to avoid smoking marijuana in public areas, though the risk of criminal prosecution is minimal relative to most of the world.

It is illegal to transport illicit drugs of any kind entering and leaving Canada to US or elsewhere. Being caught with illicit drugs will result in seizure,arrest and will be barred from entering the country.
Stay Safe
Ontario is a large province. Toronto is one of the few major cities located within the province. This is one of the only two province that have their own provincial police forces.
