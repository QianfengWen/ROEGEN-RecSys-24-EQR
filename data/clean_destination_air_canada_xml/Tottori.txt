The city of Tottori (鳥取市) is the capital of and is on the Sea of Japan coast. Its sand dunes are among the best reasons to visit western .
There's more to do than climbing and collecting seashells &mdash; hanggliders, sandboards, and even camels await. As of April 2021, Tottori had a population of approximately 187,750 people. 

Understand

It's useless. The sand can swallow up cities and countries, if it wants to.

Kobo Abe's existential meditation on sand and work, The Woman in the Dunes, was published in 1964. Although the novel does not mention Tottori by name, it was a natural choice for the film adaptation of Abe's book. "There has never been sand photography like this (no, not even in Lawrence of Arabia)," said Roger Ebert, of the Oscar-nominated film. 

You will, almost certainly, have a better visit than did the story's protagonist, Niki Junpei; come to collect insects, Junpei was fascinated by the patterns and movement of the sand, and missed the last train. Locals offered him lodging for the night, but the next morning, Junpei discovered that he was a prisoner at the bottom of a sandpit, which he and an unnamed woman must shovel out every day in order to keep the house and village from being swallowed in the endless, enigmatic movement of the sand.

The city itself is the industrial center of the prefecture, with several big electronics factories for companies like Sanyo. The fishing industry is also quite lively. There are also two universities, which attract agricultural students and researchers from other parts of Japan and a small number of foreign students. Although the number of foreign residents in Tottori is low, compared to other major cities in Japan, its 250,000 locals are certainly friendly &mdash; and thoroughly unlikely to strand you at the bottom of a sand pit.

See

* 16km from east to west, the Tottori Sand Dunes are a favorite target for climbing, exploring, and more. The main portion of the dunes are much smaller than 16km (about 2km, east to west), but they can still be impressive. If you arrive very early in the morning, you can see the unique patterns carved by the wind before they get trampled by the scores of people who come to climb the biggest dune. If you'd prefer not to get sand in your shoes, a cable car ride (¥200 one way) leads to the Dune Observatory Center. After heavy rains, the oasis below the uma no se (the largest dune) forms into a beautiful lake. The 200¥ loop bus is the cheapest way of getting to the dunes from Tottori station; the local bus will cost ¥360, or ¥310 if you stop at "kodomo no kuni" stop, where you can walk right away on the dunes from the west side. 

 
* Built in 1545, Tottori Castle was destroyed in a massive siege in the 19th century, and only the foundations remain. The site offers a nice view of the city below from the lower reaches of Mt. Kyusho. The surrounding park is the perfect place to go during cherry-blossom season.

*A two-story museum that displays the flora and fauna of Tottori, regional rocks and minerals, historical artifacts, festival and local cultural artifacts, and a variety of art produced in the city. (Be aware that most, but not all, of the prehistoric artifacts are reproductions; most of the other displays are real, though). Some of the standouts are the largest preserved squid in Japan and a live giant salamander.

* This French-style mansion was home to the remnants of the Edo Period feudal clan, Ikeda. It's about 11 minutes on the blue bus from JR Tottori Station.

* Constructed in 1632, this is the 32nd temple along the . While the temple itself does not look particularly special, the garden inside is what makes this such a great place to visit. The temple doors are removed upon entering so that you can sit and enjoy the beautiful pond garden from inside. The garden is quite peaceful, as the only sounds you can hear are the birds in the trees. It's easy to forget you're in a city.

* Built in 1650 by Mitsunaka Ikeda, the first lord of Tottori. The god worshipped here is the same worshipped at Toshogu Shrine in . It's a popular place to watch fireflies at night in the late summer.

* This museum features a re-creation of an old school building and many interesting tin toys. It's about 5 minutes on the blue bus from JR Tottori Station. 

* Despite the name, this small, two story museum displays mainly pottery and glass, but also has some textiles, woodwork, and bamboo work. The Ushinotoyaki pottery is the highlight of the collection. Just outside the museum, there is a place (the hexagonal structure) to pray for and make offerings to deceased orphans. With the stained-glass, it has an interesting Christian-Buddhist fusion feel. It's about 25 minutes on the blue bus from JR Tottori Station.

*This temple is the site of the grave of Araki Mataemon, a legendary swordsman. In a famous story, he came to the aid of a man who was seeking in vengeance; the actual sword he used is displayed on the temple grounds. Rakan (paintings of high ranking Buddhists) are painted on the fusuma (screen doors) inside the temple by Keitaro Takagi. While traditional priest paintings are stoic, these paintings are quite candid, with rather comical appearances.

* Interactive multimedia and digital displays about the city's history and culture. It's about 15 minutes on the red bus from JR Tottori Station.

Do
Sand Dunes
There's a lot to do at the sand dunes. Pay close attention to operating days/seasons and make reservations before getting your heart set on a specific activity, though.

* Anyone who knows anything about sand dunes knows that they're meant to be traveled atop a camel. You'll find the camels by the main entrance (east), in front of the lift. Note, however, that the actual riding time is quite brief. You may want to watch other riders make the short (less than 10 minute) circuit before paying for a ride.

* From late August to the end of October, this pear orchard lets you pick and eat 3-5 of the "20th century pears".

* Full day courses suitable for beginners, offered by professional hang-gliders from Kyoto Air Sports. Because you need to be there for the entire course to get airborne, you must make a reservation. Walk-ins are not accepted.

* So nice the sand will sing to you (narisuna). The sand at Idegahama is made of silica, and when you walk on it, it makes a pleasant sound. The sand at Idegahama was even worshipped long ago because of the melodies that rang from the sand. To hear the sand at its best, come when it is hot.

* For more than 400 years, these waters have been worked by female divers with their own special method of fish-catching. If you are lucky, you may even see them today.

* Designated as a national park, the coast just east of the sand dunes is rugged and magnificent. Contact the Iwami-cho Tourist Association.

Others

* Starting from the castle ruins, climbing Mt. Kyusho takes around half an hour and offers a great view of the city and surrounding area, all the way out to the sand dunes. But watch out for the ghosts of those who starved at the top during the castle siege.

* Relax at Tottori Hot Spring, not far from JR Tottori Station, or at Yoshioka Hot Spring. Both have brochures at the information desk in the train station.
