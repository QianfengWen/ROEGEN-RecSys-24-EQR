Pula (: Pola, : Pulj) is a nice town at the tip of the n peninsula, . 

Understand

Its history started about 3000 years ago when it was built by Illyrians. Romans occupied in 177 B.C. After the destruction of the Western Roman Empire, the Istrian peninsula was devastated by Ostrogoths. Slavs came to Istria during the migration period in the 7th century but mostly lived in the countryside. At that time Pula was still inhabited mostly by Italians. Landlords in Pula changed quite frequently in the middle ages, from the Republic of Venice to Genoa to the Illyrian Provinces to Austria–Hungary and many others. Pula was a principal port of the Austro-Hungarian navy during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Between 1918 and 1947, the town was part of Italy and since the end of the Second World War it has been part of . After the war, many autochthonous Italians were forced to flee and sought refuge in Italy and Croats began moving into the town. Although most of the population still consists of Croats, there are large minorities such as Italians, Serbs, Bosniaks and Slovenes.

Most tourists visit in the summer months (July, August, September), with most tourist spots and restaurants closing between October and May. Great deals abound if you visit during the off season.
The Irish writer James Joyce lived in Pula with his wife Nora in 1904. He taught languages to Austro-Hungarian naval officers at the local Berlitz school. The Joyces lived in Pula for only one year before moving north to Trieste. Like Umago, Pula too is officially bilingual - Italian is also spoken by part of the population, while road signs are in both languages.

Get in

By plane
Pula has its own international airport with daily flights to , and direct services from many European cities including , , , , , , and . Ryanair operates direct flights from three times a week. Many flights to Pula are charter rather than scheduled, while other flights are seasonal (summer only). 
There is a seaplane service operated by European Coastal Airways with daily flights to Split through Mali Lošinj in the winter and destinations like Split, Rijeka, Zagreb in the summer.

There is a scheduled bus service from the bus station in town to the airport. Buses are operated by Brioni and connect to most major flights. The cost of a one-way ticket is 25kn. A taxi from the bus station to the city should be around 85 kuna in the low season and much higher in the summer.

It is possible to also consider Rijeka Airport on the island of and Trieste Airport in nearby to access Pula as they are close by and offer flights to different destinations.

By bus
The large and modern bus station is on the edge of the 'old town' district and is the hub of local, domestic and international bus routes. There are direct buses from Zagreb, , , , , and . Online timetables are listed at and 

There is also a train station near the waterfront with services serving Istria and into due to historical circumstance rather than back towards the rest of Croatia (though a connecting coach service operates for services to Rijeka and Zagreb). Ticket prices, timetables and other information are on the Croatian Railways website.

 from works very well. In Zagreb start from the petrol station after the "Billa" supermarket on the southside of the Sava river. In Rijeka ask people to drop you off at the little SOS stop after a pretty sharp right bend of the motor way around Rijeka.

By ferry
Hydrofoil services operate from the wharf both around the Croatian coastline, and across to Venice. These are pricey, though provide a quick journey and provide some great views.

Venezia Lines ferry connects Pula with Venice. It runs five times a week, travel time is around 3hr. Services are only during summer months.

Get around

There are five ways of getting around Pula: by foot, by car, by bus or by taxi and by hired scooters or bike rental 

Pula is a small town, so walking around is not a big problem. All the tourist points are in the historic center and require no other means of transport than your legs. 

Entering Pula with a car in the summer months may not be the best idea, more so if it rains. Being an old town, many streets are narrow, there are many bottlenecks and there is very little parking space. Use the car only if you really need to. Scooters are perfect for this reason.

Traveling by bus is by far a better idea than taking the car. There are 3 main bus routes connecting the city center with the tourist cores (Verudella and Stoja) and they run on a 20 minute basis from early in the morning to early in the evening, slowing down to a 30-45 minutes routine before ending around midnight. Beware that the buses tend to get crowded and tend to be late. You might get denied entry if the bus cannot hold more passengers and support buses don't usually get dispatched. Buses can seem costly depending on where you are from(11kn per card, per person, per ride), however, if you plan on using the city bus company (Pulapromet) actively, you should make yourself a BusCard. The BusCard is a electromagnetic ticket that you can fill with money and then use for cheaper bus rides. The price of a buscard is 30kn but they sell them for 70kn since they are prefilled with 40kn you can use on the bus. The BusCard reduces drastically the price of the ride making it 7kn per hour on the city lines (lines 1 to 9). Also, up to 5 people can use the same BusCard at the same moment, for the same bus. Besides, the credit on the BusCard lasts forever, meaning you can save it for the next time you come to Pula without fearing money loss. You can buy it at the main bus station in the Pulapromet booth, on newsstands that show the BusCard sticker, or on the bus by the driver. Ask for a Vrijednosna. Refills are bought at the bus station or at newsstands. 

Taxis are mostly reliable in Pula. The current start price is 15kn and 7kn per kilometer, Sundays and nights are 20% overcharged. Be sure to have the meter running and be sure to seat only in taxis displaying the Pula Taxi sticker with the city coat of arms and the taxi number. Alternatively, try and set up a price with the driver especially if going to the neighboring towns of Medulin, Štinjan, etc.

As for inter-town buses, Pula is well connected to other Istrian towns and Croatian destination with a few international destinations as well.Tickets and information may be found at the bus station. The Brioni booth serves as the main information desk and sells tickets for all companies besides Autotrans whose tickets have to be bought on the opposite desk. Beware that all buses have a luggage area. The service is charged separately from the ticket and it usually costs 7kn. There should be no problem taking a small backpack or a small suitcase on the bus as long as you can fit it in the overhead compartment (which is rather small) or under your seat/legs. Every ticket can be refunded at the ticket office (a fee will be charged).

See

*Archeology Museum (12 kn).
*Arena, the 6th largest surviving Roman amphitheatre. Towering over the nearby buildings this huge structure was barely saved from destruction several times during its life, mostly by various Venetians with plans to take it to Venice stone by stone as demonstration of the might of the Venetian empire. Many stones were taken to build houses and other structures around Pula, but fortunately this practice was stopped before the whole structure was destroyed. Entry (70kn) gives you access to wander the inside of the Colosseum and visit the caverns beneath. The audio tour is very worthwhile. Once a month the areans hosts mock gladiator fights which is a really good value for money. Hit up the city website to get dates and other details.
