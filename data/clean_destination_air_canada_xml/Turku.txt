Turku (Swedish: Åbo) is a city in the Southwest coast of at the mouth of Aura River. It is within the region of Finland Proper in the Province of Western . It is believed that Turku came into existence during the end of 13th century which makes it the oldest city in Finland. 

Turku was for a long time the most important population center in Finland: it was the first capital city of Finland from 1809 to 1812 and continued to be the largest city by population in Finland until the end of the 1840s. Nowadays its significance nationwide is not the same as it used to be, but Turku is a regional capital and important location for business and culture in .

Understand

Turku has approximately 175 000 inhabitants, and was the most important city in from the 1300s until 1812, until the Russians moved the capital to (closer to and further from ). Turku remained Finland's main city for a while after, but its ambitions were dealt a death blow in 1827, when a raging fire destroyed most of the city.

Today's Turku remains the third largest city in Finland, after the Greater Helsinki metropolitan area and . Some of the main attractions of Turku are its history and the great natural beauty of the neighboring archipelago. Turku is at its best during the summertime, and hosts a great number of festivals, including rock festivals, chamber music festivals and a faire.

Get in
The city is well connected domestically, but sparsely connected internationally. Perhaps the most scenic way to get to Turku is by taking a passenger ferry across the Baltic Sea, from in .

By plane

By train

VR offers direct day connections from (2h), (1:40), , and . There is also overnight car train to . The railway station is in the northern part of the city center.

Kupittaa station is in the eastern part of the city center (near the university), but only trains to Helsinki stop there!

If you want to travel from (or to) the port of Turku, you need a ticket from (or to) "Turku satama." If you travel from Kupittaa station, choose "Kupittaa." Tickets (when going to Helsinki) are checked only after Kupittaa.

In Finland train travel is usually quite expensive but you can get VR's tickets with reduced prices if buying them beforehand online.

By coach
There are several bus companies operating from Turku. Usual destinations are Helsinki, Tampere and Pori, and the busses stop between in smaller cities. Some busses go to Helsinki-Vantaa airport.

You can buy tickets for several companies in advance from Matkahuolto Usually Onnibus has the lowest prices, tickets typically start at 7-8€ when bought in advance. Tickets bought from the driver might get quite pricy!

By boat
The Port of Turku is next to Turku Castle and is easily accessible on bus line 1 from the Market Square (Kauppatori). The port also has its own railway station, and some trains depart at the port.

The two biggest ferry lines are Viking Line and
Silja Line Each one has a morning and an evening departure to , Sweden, with a brief stop at the . For a scenic view, a morning departure is advisable. Evening departures provide adequate night club activities on board if you want to cut loose before arriving in Turku.

Ferry tickets usually start at 20€ for weekdays and a bit more for the weekends.

Viking Line operates M/S Amorella (morning departure) and M/S Viking Grace (evening), Silja Line operates M/S Galaxy (morning) and M/S Baltic Princess (evening). M/S Amorella was built in 1988 and is the smallest ferry, but the others are quite modern and spacious. M/S Grace is the newest one (2013), and has a proper spa. All ferries offer a selection of restaurants and bars.

The steamer S/S Ukkopekka also offers cruises to/from nearby , the home of Moomin World 

During summertime m/s Ruissalo offers route between city and Ruissalo island.

There's a Guest Marina on the River Aurajoki, right next to the city center. 

By car
Turku is well connected by road. Route E18 leads west from (2 hours). Route E63 leads south-west from (2:15), while E8 heads south from (2:15).

Get around
Turku has an excellent public transportation system called Föli, and its buses can reach nearly every corner of the city. The city centre and nearby suburbs have also Föli city bikes (registration needed). For your convenience see Föli. Föli mobile app "Föli opaskartta", is definitely the best way to find routes and buy tickets.

 On foot
The vast majority of the city's sights are within two kilometres of the Kauppatori market square that is considered as the heart of the city. The river Aura passes through the center of the city, and its banks are very popular for walking along on, allowing for a pleasant stroll from, say, the city centre to the Turku Castle.

By bicycle 
The city tourist office can suggest cycling routes and publishes an excellent free bike route map of the city and surrounding towns. You can rent bike for €14 per day or €63 per week; Find out more bicycle rental at the website or call +358 (0) 40 372 5310.

Föli-fillari or shortly Fölläri is a new citybike system. It is part of Föli public transport system. They are ment for short time use: less than 30 min ride is free and the time may extend to 5 hours with additional fee. So far these require ownership of Föli value bus card and are not available for those having travel bus card.

By ferry 

The free Föri ferry shuttles travellers and their bikes (no cars allowed) across the Aurajoki River every day from 6:15AM to 9PM, or until 11PM in summer. The trip covers a grand distance of 78 meters and takes about a minute and a half. A running local gag is to ask visitors if they've taken the trip from Turku across to Åbo on the Föri yet; actually, both sides of the river are called the same, Åbo is just the Swedish name. Incidentally, the name comes from the Swedish färja and is related to the English word "ferry".

 By waterbus 
From May to September there are two Föli waterbuses running from the river Aura to popular Ruissalo island. The waterbus stops at Pikisaari suburb where architecture consist mostly of wooden villas. One direction trip from downtown to Ruissalo takes about 45 minutes. All Föli tickets apply here.

By bus 

Public transport is operated by Föli, 

Almost every bus terminates at the Kauppatori market square, and bus lines radiate outwards from it. There are no significant 'circle lines', so usually if you need to transfer, you will need to take one bus to the Kauppatori, then transfer there to the bus taking you to your final destination. Buses generally go in two directions from Kauppatori, so check and make sure that you are taking the correct numbered bus in the correct direction as well.

You can pay the driver in cash only! A single daytime ticket is €3.00, and it is valid for unlimited transfers within two hours of the ticket's purchase. After 11pm the price is €4.00. If you intend to take the bus more than twice a day, it becomes economical either to buy a 24h travel ticket from the driver (€7.50) or a travel ticket card, priced from €7.00 for 24 hours to €31.00 for 14 days. Travel ticket cards are available from any Föli service offices (one is located next to the market square), main bus station, and Turku travel office. Travel tickets can be used in night buses as well.

Notice that all Föli tickets apply as long as you travel within the municipalities Turku, , , , , and .

 
Some of the more important bus lines are the number 1, which goes from Kauppatori to the airport to Kauppatori to the passenger harbor (and Turku Castle) and then all over again.

By taxi 
Taxis are generally easily available and very safe, but expensive. There are three crunch times when they might be slightly problematic, and those are the morning and evening ferry departure times (particularly during summer), around 8AM and 9PM, and the bar closing times (particularly on weekends) around 4AM.

A normal taxi will carry about 4 people and a moderate amount of luggage. For significant amounts of luggage, you may want to order a "farmari" taxi, an estate/wagon car which has a roomier luggage compartment. There is also a third common type of taxi available, the tilataksi, a van which will comfortably carry about 8 people.

Taxis charge a base cost of €5.90 or 9.00 depending on time of day (on Sundays the base cost is higher regardless of the time of day), and €1.55-2.18 per km, depending on amount of passengers (more passengers, higher mileage charge). Quick 1-2 km trips will cost in the €8-13 vicinity.

Flagging taxis on the street is not common in Finland and may not work; calling the central dispatch is the common method, however you can recognize a free taxi in dark, since the taxi sign on the top will have its light on.

By car 
Parking places are sparse at rush hours, but otherwise you should be able to park your car quite near the place you are going. One good option is the underground Louhi parking hall (€1-2/h) as it gives you direct access via elevators to the center of the city and its entrance is well.

 Other 

During the summertime, there are multiple boats at the banks of the River Aura who make trips into the archipelago.

See

* At the south tip of the city, near the ferry terminals. A must for everyone visiting the city and is one of the country's most popular tourist attractions. This old castle dates from the 1280s, and has been carefully renovated. There is always some exhibition in the castle premises. Highlights include the two dungeons and magnificent banquet halls, and a historical museum of medieval Turku in a maze of restored rooms in the castle's old bailey. Tours of the stronghold are given hourly in English. They give a good account of the castle's history.

* Towers over the river and the town and is one of Finland's most important Cathedrals. Tours run 9AM-7PM during mid September to mid April and 9AM to 6PM mid April to mid September.

* An art museum named after Finnish artist and sculptor Wäinö Aaltonen (1896-1966), whose statues of famous Finns and various nationalist themes can be found throughout Finland. Perhaps the best-known is the classical Greek-style statue of "Flying Finn" and nine-time Olympic gold medalist Paavo Nurmi. Five copies of the statue exist, one in the museum, and the statue's best known exploit was when students from the Helsinki U. of Tech. snuck one onto the wreck of the 17th-century Swedish warship Vasa just days before it was salvaged.

Buy

There are plenty of opportunities to part with your cash in Turku. The city centre is full of major retail and independent shops. Shopping in Turku is generally more affordable than in Helsinki, but, as with the rest of Finland, it is by no means cheap by international standards. The numerous second-hand and antique stores represent a unique shopping alternative.

Eat
For proper restaurant meals, expect to pay €10-€30 - lower end with some simple pasta or soup with water or a soft drink, and the higher end with a high-grade steak meal with good wine. For fast food or pizzeria meals, you will generally need to pay under €10. Burger meals are around €5-€8 (including drink and fries), kebabs and pizzas are about the same.

Generally, proper restaurants are open until 10-11PM, on weekends maybe an hour longer. There are no proper restaurants open in Turku after midnight. Fast food chains, pizzerias and other such places are open later at night, some as late as 3-5AM. In some establishments, the bar may remain open for drinks even though the kitchen has closed and no food is available.

Lunch
As eating out is expensive, it might be a good idea to have a hearty lunch and lighter dinner. As Finnish people typically don't bring their own food to their workplace, restaurant lunches are generally good value and most restaurants offer them. Lunch usually means a self service buffet - eat as much as you want. More expensive "business lunch" means portions brought to your table. Lunch prices start from EUR 6,50 with which you usually get salad and soup buffet + bread + coffee. If you pay the full price, which typically is a bit less than EUR 10,00, you get salad and soup buffet + the main course buffet (with several dishes) + dessert + coffee. Watch for signs in front of the restaurants with the text "lounas". The hearty buffet lunch for EUR 11,40 is even served at the airport.

Budget
Hesburger is the dominant burger chain in Turku, and you will find several of these in the city centre. Pizzerias are frequently kebab-pizzerias, offering both Turkish kebab and Italian pizza dishes on their menu. You will also find a lot of these downtown.

If you lose the ticket, you may be told to come back the following day to get your things, and sometimes you need to pay extra (5-10€) for additional work you caused.

The legal drinking age in Finland is 18 for mild alcoholic drinks (up to 20%/40-proof) and 20 for stronger drinks than that, but selling stronger drinks to 18-year-olds is legal in bars and nightclubs as the customers are under bar staff's supervision.
