 Understand 
 
When people think of Nuremberg, they usually think of gingerbread, toys, Christmas, the Nazi Party Rally Grounds or the Nuremberg Trials. The old town of Nuremberg is much more than this and indeed Nuremberg probably comes closest to many tourists' expectations of a typical German city: on the one hand one can find half-timbered houses, gothic churches within a medieval city wall in the shadow of the towering imperial castle, which was one of the most important residences of the emperors of the Holy Roman Empire. On the other hand, Nuremberg and the surrounding cities are home to many well-known German companies, e.g. Adidas, Diehl, Faber-Castell, Playmobil, Puma and several divisions of industrial giant Siemens. Finally, Nuremberg even can live up to culinary expectations with breweries and beergardens and its most famous dish, the Nuremberg sausages with Sauerkraut.

Old Town
Nuremberg's old town is divided by the river Pegnitz. The northern half is called Sebalder Alstadt, the southern Lorenzer Altstadt.

* The castle dominates the north-western corner of Nuremberg's old town. In the west (on the right, when coming from the city) the castle starts with Luginsland tower. Between it and the five-cornered tower is the Kaiserstallung. It was built in 1495 in only one year and served originally as a storehouse for grain. Today it is used as a youth hostel. The five-cornered tower was constructed before 1050 and is the oldest building of the castle and city. Further east are the entry to the castle garden and the castle gate. Through the castle gate one gets to the Freiung, where you can enjoy one of the best views of the old town. If you want to look further you can climb the round tower (Sinwellturm) in the first court of the castle. There you also find the deep well (Tiefer Brunnen). In the main court is the Kemenate on the right and the Palas on the left side. The Palas houses the castle museum, further rooms including the two-storey chapel can be seen on a guided tour. (Note: The guided tour offered by the Castle is only in German. However, another company offers English and other language tours of the town and castle for &euro; 8-10. Information is available inside the Tourist Information Center in the Market Square, where the tour starts).

* Originally Nuremberg's city wall had a length of five kilometers and five gates: Laufer, Spittler-, Frauen-, Neu- und Tiergärtner Tor. From the 13th to the 16th century the wall was continuously strengthened and is one of the reasons why the city withstood all attacks during this time. Nearly four kilometers of the wall are still standing. Only on the east side between the main station and Rathenauplatz are large gaps. The city moat, which was never filled with water, still exists in its full width for about two kilometers. Between Färbertor and Spittlertor (Plärrer) you should avoid the inner side of the wall, as it runs along Nuremberg's red light district. 

* Numerous old buildings here survived the war. The street Fuell with its sand stone houses is a typical merchant's street. The craftsmen lived in timber-framed houses, many of which have been restored in Weissgerbergasse. More timber-framed houses can be seen in Obere and Untere Kraemersgasse. In Untere Kraemersgasse 16 you can often look into the tiny courtyard. 

* Built from the 13th to 15th century, and renovated after sustaining heavy damage from bombings of World War II. In the center of the church is the grave of the city saint, depicting scenes of his life. 

* Built from the 13th to 15th century. Among its many treasures are the Tabernacel by Adam Kraft and the Greeting Angels by Veit Stoss.

* For many hundreds of years, the sandstone bedrock of Nuremberg's castle hill has been riddled with vaulted cellars and "secret" passageways. Rock-Cut Beer Cellars, Casemates, Water Supply Conduits. The total square footage today known 20.000 m2. The English tour is only available once a week on Sundays at 11:30am.

* Visits of the World War II Art Bunker are only possible in the course of a guided tour. Daily guided tour at 2 p.m. (in German), In addition to regular guided tours the Association of Friends of Nuremberg Rock Cellars is happy to organise guided tours for groups of up to 25 people by special arrangement. These tours are also available in English, French, Italian, Spanish and Czech. 

* A monumental outdoor sculpture, opened on October 24, 1993. It is sited on the street between the new and old buildings of the Germanisches Nationalmuseum, connecting Kornmarkt street and the medieval city wall.

*The Nürnberg Exhibition Centre is relatively new. The exhibition centre offers over 160,000 m² of display area in twelve halls grouped around the central park. 

Suburbs

* The old suburb west of the old town is best seen on a 30-minute walk from Tiergärtnertor to Hallertor. Still within the walls, the house opposite Dürerhaus is called the house of Pilate. It is the start of the way to St. Johns church, with stations of the cross made by Veit Stoss. Follow this way through the gate, across the main street and turn left. At the next street (Burgschmietstrasse), turn right and follow it until it joins Johannisstrasse which leads us along a few remaining timber-framed houses to St. John's cemetery. Many famous citizens of Nuremberg are buried here. After visiting the cemetery, turn right into Lindengasse, then left into the small alley called Riesenschritt. Here are the entrances to some restored baroque gardens. These small gardens are called Hesperidengaerten. At the lower end of Risenschritt you may wander through the romantic lanes of Gross- and Kleinweidenmuehle. Finally walk through the park along the river back into the city. 

* Soon after they came to power in 1933 the Nazis designated Nuremberg as place for their annual party rallies. To demonstrate their power they planned a set of gigantic buildings. Only a fraction of these were actually built, including a colossal Congress Hall and the reviewing stand at the Zeppelin field. The actual rally grounds cover a large area, if you want to tour the area plan to spend one or two hours. It is advisable to start with a visit of the Documentation Center (museum in the stadium wall - see Museums below). In regards to the Grosser Strasse, unless you want a long walk there is nothing really interesting to see other than a modern long road. A couple industrial businesses are located along the road, as well as a couple footpaths for wooded trails around the lake.

* The Nuremberg Tiergarten is one of the most beautiful zoos in europe. Located in a beautiful landscape on the Schmausenbuck Hill in the Nuremberg borough Zerzabelshof (Zabo). The Tiergarten get on the top of media interest, when the polar bear baby Flocke (Snowflake)was born in December 2007. The zoo is set in old quarries in the large forest at the eastern edge of the city.

* The Dolphinarium is located inside the Nuremberg Tiergarten. In 2011 the dolphin lagoon will display the first outdoor pool for dolphins in Germany.
 
* In the middle ages only towns had the right to build a wall, villages were unprotected against raiding troops. Therefore many villages built walls around the church yard. Kraftshof is a good example. From Kraftshof it is a 30 minutes stroll to Neunhof.

* Nuremberg's patricians had numerous manor houses in the surrounding villages. This is a good example, built in the 16th century. Adjoining is a small baroque garden.

Souvenirs

Ginger bread (Lebkuchen): Several large manufacturers and a number of small bakeries produce these. The best quality is called Elisenlebkuchen. The large manufacturers sell packages labeled Bruch (broken), but they usually don't contain broken gingerbread: it is just a trick. You get them cheaper, but you can hardly use a package labeled broken as a gift.

Sausages (Nürnberger Bratwürste) are available in tin cans.

"Nürnberg Parfum" The scent of Nürnberg was developed by a local perfumer. Available only at Galerie Parfum Weißgerbergasse 22.

Eat

Bratwurst (roasted sausage): Within the city you get Nürnberger Bratwürste, in the surrounding area Fränkische Bratwürste. Nürnberger are only about half the size, but contain more spices than Fränkische. Consequently one typically eats three Fränkische or six Nürnberger. In restaurants Bratwürste are served with Sauerkraut or potato salad. In some better restaurants you can order also "Saure Zipfel", cooked Bratwürste in vinegar-onion sauce with fresh horseradish and bread. On the street you can also buy two or three sausages in a roll ('Drei im Weggla'). But be careful to get "real" Nürnberger and not "foreign" Thüringer Bratwürste. Nürnberger Bratwürste / Nürnberger Rostbratwürste is also protected under EU law with Protected designation of origin status.

Many food stalls and fast food restaurants can be found along Königstraße leading from the main station into the old town.
