The rooms of the house feature general and local southwestern Kansas history, Native American History relevant to the area and many displays of 'old-time' equipment ranging from farm implements to doctor's utensils to a post office window. On the museum grounds are found native tamarack, sand hill plums, cottonwood trees and wild roses in addition to the famous 'Yellow Brick Road'. Ask to see the cement pancakes created by LeRoy Chance for the Pancake Day race, which were originally located at the start of the race, in front of the Liberal Public Library. They are currently stored in the barn out back along with other larger pieces of farm equipment and an entire turn-of-the-century homestead shack.
