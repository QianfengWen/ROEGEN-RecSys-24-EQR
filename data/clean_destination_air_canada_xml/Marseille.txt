Marseille (Greek: Massalia, Latin: Massilia) is the second most populated city of (and third most populous urban area), the biggest Mediterranean port and the economic hub of the region.

Understand

Marseille has a complex history. It was founded by the Phoceans (from the Greek city of , now Foça, in modern Turkey) in 600 BC and is one of the oldest cities in Europe. The town is a far cry from the Cézanne paintings and Provençal clichés of sleepy villages, "pétanque" players, and Marcel Pagnol novels. With around one million inhabitants, Marseille is the second-largest city in France in terms of population and the largest in terms of area. Its population is a real melting pot of different cultures. It is also said that there are more Comorian people in Marseille than in . Indeed, the people of Marseille have varying ethnic backgrounds, with many Italians and Spanish having immigrated to the area after the Second World War. 

Marseille is a place for people who are not afraid to discover a real place with real people visiting colorful markets (like Noailles market) that will make you feel like you are in Africa, or the Calanques (a natural area of big cliffs falling into the sea - Calanque means fjord), the Panier area (the oldest place of the town and historically the place where newcomers installed) or the Vieux-Port (old harbor) and the Corniche (a road along the sea), Marseille has much to offer.

Get in

By plane
* It is located about 30 km from Marseille. Buses, taxis, and a train connect it in less than 30 minutes. Shuttle services from other European cities have made more places available from Marseille. Airport buses go directly from the airport to the train station (Gare de Marseille-Saint-Charles), and from the train station to the airport, every 15 minutes.

By train
The main train station is Marseille St. Charles. It is well-linked to the rest parts of the city, as the two subway lines and many buses stop there. It is a short walk away from the Canebière and the Old Port. Beware that the station is located on a small hill. If you decide to go to the station on foot, you will have to climb a series of steps which may appear inconvenient, especially if you carry heavy pieces of luggage. To avoid the stairs, walk along the path to the left of the steps until you reach the lower floor of the station, then take the escalator up.

Marseille has TGV lines to (3 hours) and (1h45), (2h), (5h35), (7h45), (3h30) and to (5h). There is also a Spanish AVE train to (4h30) and (7h45).

By bus
Eurolines has many connections all over Europe. There are at least direct connections from Marseille to , , and . The bus station is next to the main train station, the St. Charles Station at Rue Honnorat. You get access through Platform N in the train station. Also, there is a temporary office at Platform N.

There is also a Eurolines office on the 3 Allée Léon Gambetta. If you walk down the big stairs on the south side of the station, follow the road until you come to a squarelike intersection. The office is on your left hand.

By car
Marseille is very well connected to most French cities through numerous highways. As always in France those highways are expensive but practical, comfortable, and fast. Marseille is around 8 hours from Paris by car, 2 hours from , 1h30 from , 4 hours from and 3 hours from . However, be aware that driving in the city center is a nightmare - park your car somewhere safe and stick to public transport whenever you can.

By boat
Marseille has a big harbor. There are direct ferry routes from Marseille to , , , Porto Vecchio and . 

There are several piers at the harbor, so it is advisable to check well in advance from which pier you are departing.

The Old Port of Marseille serves the nearby islands and the nearest coastal cities.

Get around

By bus, tram and underground
Marseille is served by a relatively good public transport system, the Régie des Transports de Marseille RTM covering 2 underground railway lines (métro), 2 tram lines, and 74 bus lines. If you have any mobility problems, are in a wheelchair, or have a child in a pushchair, you should be aware that almost every métro station has stepped in it somewhere and some will have several flights of stairs - stick to the trams and buses which are a better option.

The number of transfers is unlimited (including the return journeys) within the one-hour limit between the first boarding and last transfer on the network (you must validate with each entry to the bus). The subway and tram systems stop running every night at 01:00. Beware that until October 2025, the metro stops at 21:30 from Monday to Thursday with free replacement bus shuttles. Most bus routes do not operate after 21:00, although a limited network of night buses (Fluobus) operates with infrequent service (about every 30 minutes) until 01:00. Using a taxi is recommended if you need to travel after 21:00.

Tickets for buses and the métro can be bought in cafés, at subway and tram stations. Single-ride tickets allow unlimited transfers between metro, bus, and trams within 1 hour of initial use, but need to be validated at every re-entry. The fare is €1.70(can be differentiated from the time, zone, age) and it can be conveniently paid contact-less by tapping the credit card onto the validators at the doors or metro gates. You can also buy tickets from the bus drivers for 2€. Alternatively, there is a multi-journey ticket for 10 trips (carte libertés) at €15.00. A daily ticket (carte journée) costs €5.20, and a 72-hour ticket costs €10.80. Valid for an unlimited number of trips, on the RTM network: bus, metro, tramway, ferry boat (excluding sea shuttles), and on the Transmétropole network. 

The Pilote includes all the bus, tram, and metro schedules but is easier to read than the RTM sites. Moreover, this site repeats the schedules of the majority of transport in common routes around the wider region (tram, interurban buses, regional trains TER) and makes it possible to search for journeys in Marseille and the nearby communes. Google Maps is fairly reliable too.

Airport transfers are available for €10 each way to and from Gare Saint Charles (or €16 for a return ticket). Tickets may be bought online, by credit card with the driver or at the cabin between Hall 1 and Hall 3/4 of the main terminal and at a separate kiosk in the new Gare Routière, after Voie Platform N in the Gare St Charles. The bus runs every 20 minutes for 10, 30, and 50 minutes past the hour. The ride is about 30 minutes. The bus says Navette Aeroport - Gare St Charles on it. From Gare St Charles, the métro can get you to most hotels. At night (00:00-5:00), the bus terminal in Marseille is closed and you have to walk to the left around the building to reach the busses on the other side.

By car
Avoid taking your car if you possibly can. Marseille, at least the center, has narrow streets, one-way streets, random lane changes and so on which can drive both locals and non-locals crazy. The local drivers have a well-deserved reputation for fearlessness - particularly if they are on two wheels. In addition, Marseille has some of the lowest parking fines in France - parking fines are rarely enforced and consequently, you will find cars parked (and sometimes double parked) everywhere.

Due to the new tunnel that is being built to try to alleviate some of Marseille's traffic problems, satellite navigational systems such as the Tom Tom are likely to be out of date and dangerous if followed. For instance, following a Tom Tom in the center of Marseille could take you across newly installed pedestrian areas or Tram lines. The one-way system has also completely changed.

By taxi
Be careful of rogue taxi drivers. While there aren't many, there are a few and a €20 ride can quickly become a €40 ride. If you think you've been cheated get the taxi driver's number (located in the rear of the car, often on the window) and go to the Tourist's Office at 4, La Canebière (near Le Vieux Port) and speak to a representative, they can and will get your money back if you've been ripped off. They will also get the taxi driver in significant trouble.

For more information about taxis in France, see the main article.

By boat
A Ferry Boat crosses the Old Harbour (Vieux Port). It is a tourist attraction in itself known as the shortest commercial boat ride in Europe. Several other ferries propose connexions with L'Estaque, Les Goudes, La Pointe-Rouge, and Le Frioul. They cost 5€ a return trip but a 1 week RTM transportation pass (13€) comprises them (except Frioul island) which is very interesting. Also, there are several companies proposing boat tours of the Calanques, like mini-cruises.

 By bicycle 
Marseille has the excellent Le vélo bicycle hire scheme in place, but there are basically no cycle paths and the few that are there are usually filled with pedestrians or parked cars, which makes cycling in Marseille a rather dangerous affair. The vélo scheme costs 1 euro for a week's subscription. Each time you hire a bike, the first 30 minutes are free, then each hour costs 1 euro. Note that there is a 150 euro deposit which will be charged if you don't return the bike properly. Univélo Marseille is a mobile app that gives you live bike or park availability in the 100+ bike stations.

Architecture and buildings
* The castle was built on a small island off the city, initially as a defensive structure, and was later used as a prison. It is most famous for its place in the novel The Comte de Monte-Cristo by Alexandre Dumas. Tourist boats leave from the Vieux Port for a 15-minute ride. The boats do get full, especially on a weekend, so if you want to leave on a specific boat, you're advised to arrive an hour before the trip to buy the tickets (they are issued for a specific time). Then you can kill the time before the ride by visiting the nearby attractions; a Notre Dame church is around 15 minutes away by foot if you are good at walking uphill. Both the island and the castle are small, and everything there can be seen and photographed in 20 minutes. But due to the boat schedules you will spend at least an hour there until the boat picks you up, so don't rush. There are no shops there, so pack your lunch and drinks. A toilet is available. Both the castle and the island offer very limited access to wheelchair users. The entrance to the Castle costs 6 Euro. The whole exhibition is focused on the Count of Monte-Cristo novel, so unless you're a fan, plan your time differently.
* It was designed by Le Corbusier. The building is called "la maison du fada" (the house of the foolish) by local people. The building contains a shopping street, a church, a children's school, and housing. You can access the roof and enjoy the breathtaking view of Marseille between the hills and sea (10am-6pm). There is a bar, restaurant, hotel on the 3rd floor too. Take bus B1 from Rond-Point du Prado metro.
* It is a fishing port that is just starting to exploit its tourist potential through its connections to Cézanne. You can get there on bus #35 heading from La Joliette (to get to La Joliette take metro Line 2).
* A hangout area with bookstores, cafés, fountains, and a playground for the small ones (metro stop Cours Julien/Notre Dame du Mont). It is a trendy area of Marseille, with lots of graffiti, lots of bars and restaurants at night. La Plaine is the local name for Place Jean Jaurès close to Cours Julien. Every Thursday and Saturday morning the Plaine market is the place to shop. On Wednesday morning, you can enjoy the market with local farmers with organic fruits and vegetables.
* Old city right next to the Vieux-Port. Panier means basket in French, but in Marseille, it is the name of the oldest area of the town. In the middle of this area, there is the Vieille Charité, a wonderful old monument, now hosting museums and exhibitions. This area is like a village of the Provence right in the city center. Lots of craftsmen, creators, handmade shops, and restaurants are in beautiful places. You can enjoy a beautiful walk there walking down the narrow streets with colored old buildings until the cathedral La Major and the new museum MuCEM.

* Monument from the mid-1800s with a waterfall & reservoir built to bring water to the city. From the Réformé church (up the Canebière) you can follow the Boulevard Longchamp where you can see nice examples of old upper-class buildings to arrive at Palais Longchamp. The palais is worth visiting though it won't take you long. The Palace houses two museums: the Museum of Fine Arts in its left wing and the Museum of Natural History in its right wing.
* The Marseille Observatory was created in 1702 and in 1860 the Observatory was transferred to the Longchamp plateau to house new instruments and a large Foucault telescope. Over the years, the importance of this observatory decreased as new observatories with large telescopes appeared. In Observatory is a possible tour for the groups.
* The area around the Noailles subway station is one of the city's most interesting. Lined with Arabic and Indo-Chinese shops, some of the streets could be part of a bazaar in Algeria. A fascinating area.
* There you can watch fishermen selling their stock by auction is a must. Arriving in Marseille in the Vieux-Port on a summer evening is something you will never forget. You can watch this show by going to Frioul islands or Chateau d'If and going back late in the afternoon. There is also a nice view of the harbor from the Palais du Pharo (Pharo Palace). The famous Canebière Avenue goes straight down the harbor. However, the Canebière is not that interesting despite its reputation.

Churches
* Fortified abbey founded by St. Cassian and built over the 5th-century crypt housing his sarcophagus.

* Big church which overlooks the city. It was built on the foundations of an ancient fort at the highest natural point in Marseille. Construction of the basilica began in 1853 and lasted for over forty years. The exterior of the building features layered stonework in contrasting colors. The basilica was built in a Roman-Byzantine style (with domes, stones polychromy, gold, and mosaics) and has two parts higher and lower. Old fishermen used to have their boats blessed in this church. You can still see many boat models hanging around in the church. From there it is one of the nicest views of the city. You can use the tourist train from the Vieux Port to reach the church - you can get off the train, look around, and board a later train back to the port. It is about a 15-20 minute walk from the port, but it is quite steep uphill.
* Gigantic Cathedral is situated on the coast. It is the only cathedral built in the 19th century in France, its massive architecture of New Byzantine style makes it a wonderful place to visit inside and outside, with a new large esplanade.
* This Hebrew cult building took place of inauguration in 1864 and now is the oldest in Marseille among such types of buildings. It has a unique Romano-Byzantine style architecture.
* It is better known as the Church of the Reformed. Built in neo-Gothic style in 1886. Its façade has three portals and is surrounded by two bell towers, the spires are 70 m high. Inside it consists of a nave with two side aisles. In 2023 it is in the final stages of restoration.

Museums
* The gallery is dedicated to the urban art form of street art. Also, it presents avant-garde and ambitious works which have been made through artistic collaboration. The exhibition highlights are the works of talented French and international artists.

The dolia are the large ceramic containers, used in Roman times, primarily in the agricultural field. They were used to store wine or oil.
* The Museum reveals the Memory of the Marseille Sanitary Station.

Parks
* A large great park, 300 meters from the sea. After a siesta go to the park to have a drink at Escale Borely (a place with numerous restaurants and bars on the beach) or watch the sunset several hundred meters from the sea.
* Straight-lined Boulevard by plane trees is 580 meters (0.4 miles) long. Its name comes from the palace name located at its eastern end. In 2007 there has been constructed a way to the tramway T2 line.
* In 1862 there was built a monumental fountain at the Longchamp Palace, then a double staircase encircling the fountain. The public garden, known as the "Plateau Garden", was inaugurated in 1869. Around the same time, a water tower and two rooms for collecting the water from the Marseille canal (built-in 1847) were added there. Worth mentioning that there was great input from the famous park designer Édouard André. Over the years, 3 gardens have appeared in the disposition of the park. Now are open to the public only 2: the "Plateau Garden" and the "Zoological Garden".
* A war cemetery dedicated to WW I and WW II martyrs from the Allies, especially the Indian and Chinese gunners, and runners. A very serene place, it is the perfect place to spend some time thinking about the people who laid down their lives and the madness of war.
* The Calanques are a series of miniature fjords in the south of Marseille near . They are best accessed from the Les Goudes area (bus #19 Montredon, then bus #20 Callelongue) and from the University campus at Luminy which can be reached by bus #21 departing from Rond Point du Prado opposite the Stade Velodrome or from Vieux Port (the bus fee is only 1,50 euros). The 'fjords' are amazing with wonderful blue sea and spectacular limestone cliffs. Enjoy not only mini fjords but also rocks and even a fountain that played a special role in the historic negotiations.

Do
* The northern part of the Marseille coast is home to many ports, while the southern part is home to beaches. Several beaches exist in Marseille. The most typical are Catalans, Prophètes, Pointe-Rouge and Corbières. However, after a big rain, some of them might be polluted and then closed. Nice places to swim and relax at the sea are also to be found on the Corniche, on the rocks ahead of Vallon des Auffes, and next to the military camp in Malmousque.

From Luminy, you can turn left to Cassis or right to Callelongue (a bus connects you to bus #19, which takes you back to Place Castellane in the center). From June to September some of the Calanques can be closed due to the high risk of fire. There exsist other sites for hiking: Grotte du Grosibou; Sentier de la Batarelle; Vallon d ol; Allée du Pic de l'Étoile; Col de Cante-Perdrix; Flamme du régiment; Malmousque Marseille.

Whilst L'OM have fallen on rather lean times the former champions of Europe are the biggest football team in France. The atmosphere at the stadium is fantastic and visitors are unlikely to get tickets for the popular Virage Nord or Sud seats in the Tribune Ganay that offer an excellent view and a chance to soak up the atmosphere. The best games involve teams with some traveling support such as St Etienne, Lens, or the grand-daddy match of them all against the evil Paris St Germain.

Eat
Unsurprisingly, Marseille's cuisine is focused on fish and seafood. Its two flag-bearing specialties are the famous fish broth bouillabaisse and aïoli, a garlic sauce served with vegetables and dried cod.

La Bouillabaisse de Marseille is an excellent fish-based soup served with la rouille (a garlic-saffron sauce) and bread similar to crostini. La bouillabaisse cannot be enjoyed at any budgetary level. If you are invited to the home of someone making bouillabaisse, then you are in the clear. Never eat cheap bouillabaisse at a resto unless it's not called bouillabaisse; only eat it out if you have to reserve in advance. Bouillabaisse is a meal. At first the soup, then the fish.

*La Joliette/J4 with trendy chic new bars and clubs (Palais de la Major, Casa Pietra, White Rabbit). 

However La Friche should not be forgotten, particularly during summer when the very large rooftop hosts DJ parties for free every Friday and Saturday.

Sleep

Budget
* It is part of the Hosteling International network, and they require you to have a membership (you can purchase that). The hostel is a rather impressive building, both inside and out, like a modern castle perched on a hill outside Marseille. They have spacious dorms, and the views are truly spectacular if you get the right room. There is a lovely staff, no curfew or lockouts, and as good a breakfast as you can expect from a hostel. You'll find clean, good bathrooms, lovely marble and mosaic floors, and quiet environs. The kitchen is lackluster and basic, but it does the job. The view comes at a cost as it is located well outside the city, about 40 minutes walking from the Vieux Port. There is transport from the center by bus lines 6 and 8, and by metro line 1/blue; you must get off at the last stop, La Fourragère, and walk about 10 minutes up a hill to reach it. They take new guests between 7-10 & 17-21 but can make arrangements if this doesn't suit you. Make sure you pay attention to the greeting instructions, as it is not a 24-hour staff, and you may find yourself waiting for a while.
* A hostel with free internet, a great atmosphere, and friendly staff.
* 

Mid-range
* 
* L’Hôtel de l’Ariana is next to La Canebière, within 5 minutes walk from the Vieux Port of Marseille, 600 meters from the Gare Saint Charles and theater Gymnasium. Prado Beach is only 15 minutes drive from Hotel Ariana whilst Marseille airport is only 25 minutes.

Contact
Le Vieux Port has WiFi access, available from many of the bars and restaurants, and in some places in the street (although there are not many places to sit). The ESSID to use is "Marseille sans fil" and the network is not encrypted. When you first connect, your browser will take you to a web page about the service in French: simply click on "Cliquez ici" ("Click here") on that page to use the network freely. 

Note WiFi is pronounced wee-fee or wiffy in French - even by English speakers. Asking for Why-Fye will usually be greeted by a blank look.

 Stay safe 
In recent years muggings and pickpockets have dramatically decreased in the city center, however, avoid carrying valuables and watch your surroundings. Most of the northern neighborhoods (quartiers nord), except L'Estaque and Château-Gombert, might be risky and should be avoided by tourists and there is no logical reason for going there.

The area around Boulevard Michelet teems with prostitutes and should be avoided on soccer nights as you can meet potentially angry and drunk Olympique de Marseille hooligans.

When driving a car make sure the doors are locked. There have been occurrences of motorcyclists opening the doors of cars and quickly snatching bags and valuables from the seats.

Overall the city is fairly safe, as is Paris, so there is no need for paranoia!
