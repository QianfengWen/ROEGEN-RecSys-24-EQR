Zurich (German: Zürich, Zürich German: Züri) is the largest city in , with a population of some 428700 in the city proper and 1.4 million in the agglomeration area. Zurich is on Lake Zurich, where the lake flows into the River Limmat, in the north of Switzerland. 

Understand 
Zurich is the largest city in the by land area and population. It is the financial center of Switzerland and houses the stock exchange and the headquarters of a large number of national and international companies, and is also home to FIFA's headquarters. German Swiss national and international media agencies as well as the German-Swiss national TV channel company are also located here. Its two major universities, ETH Zürich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, 21 Nobel Prize laureates) and University of Zurich (12 Nobel Prize laureates) are listed among the world's 15, or 50, respectively, best universities. You also find Google's worldwide second largest development center in Zurich. Because Zurich is the central node of the Swiss-wide train network and also runs the biggest and busiest international airport in the country, it generally is the first place where tourists arrive. Because of the city's close distance to tourist resorts in the Swiss Alps and its mountainous scenery, it is often referred to as the "portal to the Alps".

Contrary to a generally wrongly made assumption, Zurich is not the capital of Switzerland - the Swiss are very much a confederation of Cantons and avoid naming any one city as the capital in order to prevent that Canton from seeming more important than the others. Still, the federal government is headquartered in and not Zurich. Zurich has long been known for being clean and efficient. Due to this, it has been continuously ranked as the city with the highest living standard worldwide for many years. However, only in the last fifteen years, it has truly become a fascinating and worthwhile travel destination. This is mostly thanks to the liberalization of the party (more than 80 clubs are open at weekends) and gastronomy sectors (over 500 bars and more than 1500 restaurants). An increasingly cosmopolitan population has helped (every third inhabitant is a foreigner), as well, though more button-down remains Switzerland's most culturally heterogeneous city. Zurich always used to be well known for a demanding audience in opera/ballet, classical concerts, and theater. You find more than 50 museums and over 100 galleries in an inner city circle. Traditionally, the majority of all 59 movie showrooms show a diversity of international and arthouse cinema productions mostly shown in their original languages with German and French subtitles.

The official language is (the Swiss variety of) Standard German used in all official publications and announcements, or in any formal writing, and practically everyone can speak it, but the natively spoken language of the masses is Swiss German The most common dialect is called Züridüütsch (Zürich German), though quite mixed up with any of the many Swiss German dialects, because of Zurich's central importance and hence its high fluctuation. English and French are also quite widely spoken and often used in official publications and announcements alongside German. Any of these languages will do easily. Note that if you are a native German speaker, it is often wiser to speak Standard German rather than attempt to speak Swiss German unless you have a strong grasp on the dialect. Otherwise, some Swiss Germans will think you are trying to make fun of their language. If you are clearly a non-German foreigner, people will appreciate your effort and then switch to English, Standard German, or French.

Get in 
By plane 
Zurich Airport () (German: Flughafen Zürich-Kloten) is Switzerland's largest and busiest airport run with Swiss efficiency. The airport is actually part of the municipality of Kloten and a brief 12 minutes train ride from central Zurich. Trains run every few up to 12 minutes. Early in the morning and late in the evening trains run a bit less frequent, so if you travel at these times check the schedules ZVV: Zurich's city and suburban public transport system), or here (the Swiss country-wide integrated ticket and public transport system by the Swiss Federal Railways SBB-CFF-FFS). 

The railway station is to be found at the lowest underground Level -2 of the adjacent airport shopping center just across the street from the arrival gates. A single ticket to Zürich Hauptbahnhof (a central railway station in Zurich, on timetables usually listed as: Zürich HB). 

You can board any kind of train, since the ticket is valid for ANY kind of public transport (including SBB-CFF-FFS trains, S-Bahn (suburban trains), tram, bus, boat, and cable cars) within the ticket indicated areas, the so-called fare zones: zone 121 for Zurich Airport and Kloten's environment, and zone 110 for Zurich City for the ticket from the airport to the city. Be aware that the zones 110 for Zurich City and 120 for Winterthur count double in price calculations. 

Also take into consideration ZVV's special tourist offer ZurichCARD a ticket valid, either for 24, or for 72 hours, for the whole area of Zurich city and its adjacent zones including free access to all Zurich museums, either for CHF 27.-, or CHF 53.-. Though, no half-fare discounts are available for them.

Make sure that you have a valid ticket before you board the train or whatever vehicle, and that the ticket is valid for the respective class, either 1st or 2nd class, if you travel by train; indicated by a large big number 1 or 2 on the coaches' exterior, 1st class is also indicated by a yellow stripe along the 1st class seats outside the coaches. Fines for traveling without any ticket, or a wrong ticket, even for the wrong class, can be hefty (around CHF 100.-)! 

There is also a tram (tramway/streetcar) line No. 10 (colored pink) running between the airport and the city center, a 37 minutes ride to Zurich HB, valid with the same ticket (only 2nd class necessary), though eventually gives you a better first insight into Zurich and its adjacent suburban area, since running exclusively above ground and through the streets of the communities. Several bus lines connect to the airport and provide access to the suburban area as well as the region.

The bus terminal and the tram(way) stop are to be found at ground level south of the airport shopping center at Level 1, the top most level of the shopping center.

Most major airlines fly to Zurich, but SWISS International Airlines aka SWISS is still the Swiss flag carrier and covers the biggest part of the international traffic at the airport. Almost every large hotel in Zurich provides shuttle buses from the airport to your hotel. The stops for these hotel buses are a short walk to the right from arrival 1 in the direction of arrival 2 on the same Level 0. 

Zurich Airport has high passenger costs due to noise reduction and approach restrictions. Most no-frill airlines fly to EuroAirport which is 1 1/2 hour away by train and Basel airport bus. EasyJet resumed its flights to Zurich in 2007 after a three-year absence. Since its purchase by Lufthansa in 2008, Swiss Air has been significantly restructured and now serves as a low-cost carrier to many European destinations, with Zurich as its hub city.

If you are traveling without a Schengen Visa to another destination in Europe (via Zurich airport) and if you are not a European citizen, you must not stay in Europe for longer than 90 days - even if your final destination would allow citizens of your country to stay for more than 90 days. Failure to do so will lead to very high fines (around 8100 Euros) should you try to leave Europe via Zurich airport.

By train 
Regular trains to and from other Swiss and European cities leave from and arrive at Hauptbahnhof (HB), the main railway station, conveniently located in the city center at the beginning of Bahnhofstrasse, with easy access to mass transit. The Zurich Hauptbahnhof is served by suburban (S-Bahn), regional (RE) and long-distance trains (IR, IC and ICN) with connections throughout Switzerland, Germany's ICE, France's TGV, and various other direct (night) train services to/from as far as Amsterdam, Hamburg, Berlin, Frankfurt, Cologne, Dusseldorf, Essen, Hanover, Munich, Stuttgart, Rome, Lecce, Milano, Paris, Barcelona, Salzburg, Linz, Vienna, Budapest, Zagreb, and Beograd.

Zurich's Main Station is an extremely high busy passenger node. There are between 350,000 to 500,000 commuters daily taking usage of this central network node. Put this into relation to Zurich's amount of inhabitants: around 400,000. Regarding the number of trains daily entering and leaving a single railway station, Zürich's Hauptbahnhof is the world's most frequent railway station: 2915 trains every day!

For train timetables and tickets (see ), visit the SBB-CFF-FFS website, although it would sometimes be advisable to book international journeys online through the respective websites by the operating railways (e.g.: France's TGV Lyria Germany's DB Austria's ÖBB Italy's Trenitalia especially regarding pre-booking deduction possibilities. If you are already in Europe, your local railway station office should usually be able to book these trains. A rail pass may make your trip cheaper. 

The SBB railway station and the connecting underground mall RailCity Zürich have shops, restaurants, and grocery stores, which locals use when they need to do Sunday shopping, as it is not subject to the closing hours' laws otherwise in force in Switzerland. It also hosts a Christmas market around Christmas times.

Among the 16 railway stations (and 10 additional stops) within Zurich's city borders, there are other five major passenger railway stations. Three of them are in the top five most frequented railway stations in Switzerland.

Zürich Oerlikon in the north from the center, connecting an old industrial quarter turned into an evolving business center around the station and Zurich's fastest growing business and living quarter Zürich Nord/Stettbach north of it and midway on the way to the airport. Trains from/to the airport, the northern suburbs, Winterthur, St. Gallen, Schaffhausen/Rhine Falls, Stuttgart, Munich, Salzburg and Vienna run through this heavy commuter railway station. The direct InterCity trains Zurich Airport - Basel (does not serve Zurich HB) and Zurich Airport - Luzern (stops in Zurich HB) stop here as well.

Zürich Stadelhofen just squeezed between two tunnel ends, is Switzerland's third most frequented railway station (135,000 commuters per day), though it has only three tracks. It had been rebuilt in 1991 by star architect Santiago Calatrava along with the introduction of Zurich's S-Bahn network. Nowadays, it is already again a bottleneck with up to 40 trains per hour serving mainly S-Bahn lines for a fast connection with and Zurich's Oberland, as well as for the S-Bahn connection with the lines at Lake Zurich's east shore up to . Its central location just next to Bellevue, the opera, and the lake does not make it less important for both, the working people, as well as the culture/fun commuters. In its underground, you also find a small mall.

Zürich Hardbrücke, looks more like a people underpass, because it is located exactly below the Hardbrücke, a street bridge connecting Kreis 3 and Kreis 4, otherwise by many train tracks separated quarters, is another bottleneck in Zurich's S-Bahn network. Just next to Switzerland's second tallest building and again a commuter's culmination point just about 4 km west of Zurich HB. During the day it serves the evolving business quarter of the 1990ies, in the evenings and especially at weekends, Zurich's most pulsating party area.

Zürich Altstetten in the west of Zurich, an up-and-coming district with prominent new real estate developments (e.g. Westlink, Vulkano) and home to many corporations such as UBS, IBM, bank Julius Baer, engineering giant Pöyry, RioTinto Alcan, trust office DomizilPlus, bank Julius Baer and media house Ringier Axel Springer. This former blue-collar quarter has already turned itself into a new living place to be. Altstetten was chosen for the 1st "a-ja City Resort", a revolutionary hotel concept for holidays in the city.
A large range of public transport is the key feature of this area - only 5-15 minutes by suburban train (S-Bahn), bus, tram, or car (direct connection to A1 highway) to the main railway station and Zurich airport. Zürich Altstetten is also on the capillary train route to Bern - Lausanne - Geneva, Basel - Paris/Frankfurt/Hamburg/Berlin/Amsterdam, and Biel-Bienne/Neuchâtel (Swiss Jura). 

Zürich Enge at the Tessinerplatz in the south, west of Lake Zurich's shore, impresses with its old building from 1927 made of Ticino's granite and serves only S-Bahn commuters mainly from Lake Zurich's west shore, but is on the major route to Chur/Davos/St. Moritz (Grisons/Graubünden), Salzburg - Linz - Vienna - Budapest/Beograd, Luzern, Arth-Goldau - St. Gotthard - Ticino (Bellinzona, Lugano) - Milano. It also provides a small 365-day shop.

The other railway stations within city borders are called (clockwise from south-west to south-east): Wollishofen (S8, S24), Leimbach (S4), Giesshübel (S4), Wiedikon (several S-Bahnen), Selnau (the underground, below the Sihl river station of the S4 and S10), Affoltern (S6), Seebach (S6), Wipkingen (several S-Bahnen), Stettbach (several S-Bahnen), and Tiefenbrunnen (S6, S16).

The four stops within city borders of the S10 up to the Üetliberg: Bienz, Friesenberg, Schweighof, and Triemli (one of the city hospitals). The three additional stops (within city border) of the S4 into the Shiltal (valley): Saalsporthalle, Brunau, and Manegg. The three stops of the Forchbahn S18 shared with the Tram No. 11 (within city border): Hegibachplatz, Balgrist (several hospitals), and Rehalp, besides its starting point Stadelhofen.

By car
Almost every highway in Switzerland leads straight into Zurich. This might be quite easy for tourists but is also really painful if you have to cross Zurich on a daily basis.
By bus
Long-distance coach services (Swiss Standard German term: Car) normally end at the coach terminal next to the main railway station, where the river Sihl flows into the River Limmat.

Note: Do not confuse the blue/white ZVV buses, which are part of the local public transport system ZVV, with long-distance coaches, mainly used by extremely low-cost travelers to and from traditional blue color countries.

Many coaches arrive there from other European cities, mainly southern destinations like the or . There is a bi-weekly bus to , 

By boat
As Zurich is located at the end of Lake Zurich, it can be reached by boat from other lake villages, e.g. Rapperswil at the upper end of the lake.

Get around
Public transport
Zürich is famous for its highly efficient, clean, and safe public transport system, owned by several municipal transport agencies and managed by the Zürcher Verkehrsverbund (ZVV which covers the entire canton of Zürich, plus some municipalities in bordering cantons for the passenger's convenience (in fact the 18x fare zones and some stops in zone 155). The network includes trams, buses (local city/municipality buses as well as the yellow bright Swiss PostAuto buses), suburban trains (S-Bahn), regular trains (SBB), cable cars, and boats. The size and complexity of the network may be daunting at first, but you will soon realize that there are dozens of ways to get from one place to another, and following any of them will still be efficient. ZVV's transport system is coherently and comprehensively integrated (fare-wise and timetable-wise) into Switzerland's Federal Railways system SBB-CFF-FFS Swiss PostAuto bus network and any cities/area's local bus and tram system of the covered area.

Timetable information for any public transportation in Switzerland is available on sbb.ch or can be obtained using SBB's free smart Phone apps which also informs you about any train's position or delay in real-time. ZVV's own free app delivers you timetable information and real-time updates about ZVV's transport system condition and any delays. All of them require a working internet connection. The free Wemlin App gives you offline access to timetable information and network maps for the canton of Zurich area without internet connection and is therefore ideal for on-the-go usage in case you do not want to use data roaming.

The system is divided into numerous fare zones with Zurich's city center and innermost suburbs being in zone 110 and the outer suburbs located in other zones ( is in zone 120, for example), and the more zones you pass through, the more you will have to pay for your journey. There are single tickets, day cards, monthly cards, and annual cards. The monthly and annual cards are collectively referred to as ZVV NetworkPass.

Tickets must be purchased from a vending machine before boarding or from one of the ticket-selling kiosks. The ticket vending machines are in German, English, French, and Italian and offer almost all regular tickets available. They come along with a zone map on every machine as well as clear instructions coming to your aid, so feel free to choose! Once you have got your ticket it gives you access to all modes of transport. 

If you are staying for a longer period, consider a monthly ZVV NetworkPass, because even though there are no regular tickets valid for something between one day and a month, it takes only ten zone 110 day cards for a zone 110 monthly card to be cheaper. When traveling in all zones, it takes only eight-day cards for the monthly card to be cheaper. A 24-hour ticket (marketed as a Day Pass) for zone 110 costs the same as two single rides. Be aware of that the two zones for the city of Zurich (zone 110) and for the city of Winterthur (zone 120) count double in calculating the fare!

If you do not mind starting your travels after 9:00, the 9 o'clock-Pass is the best option. It is available as both daily, monthly and annual cards and will save you a lot of money compared to regular similarities, especially given that the 9:00 rule does not apply on weekends. It takes only 5 9 o'clock day cards for an all-zone 9 o'clock monthly card to be cheaper. 

For travels between the canton of Zürich and the neighboring cantons, you use a so-called Z-Pass available as daily, monthly, and annual cards as well as single tickets. The Z-Pass system also has its fare zones, even in the neighbouring transport regions and can be used in ZVV's covered area plus one of the neighbouring local transport regions/cantons (Aargau: A-Welle / zones 5xx, Schaffhausen: Flextax / zones 8xx, Schwyz and Zug: Schwyz-Zug / zones 6xx, St. Gallen and Thurgau; OSTWIND / zones 9xx). Z-Pass tickets and cards cannot yet be bought from the ZVV ticket vending machines.
The restriction is that you can only combine one additional transport region with ZVV. So if you are not going to one neighboring region more frequently than the others, you are probably better off with just an appropriate ZVV card and buying an additional Z-Pass single ticket/daily card for the not covered zones of your ZVV card to your final destination's zone, which is often cheaper than buying a single ticket all the way from your departing place. 
Attention: your chosen vehicle of transport must have a stop in one of your ZVV ticket's valid zones. It's last stop within your ZVV's card/ticket valid zones will then count as the point from where you have to add additional Z-Pass zones, or buy a point-to-point ticket. This does not work with all (inter-)regional (RE, IR) or most long-distance (IC, ICN, EC) trains, which do not usually stop in one of your ZVV's card valid zones (except in Zurich HB, Zurich Airport, Winterthur, and sometimes Oerlikon and Thalwil), so you would have to buy a normal point-to-point ticket. S-Bahn and R, however, are local trains and usually stop at every station, or at worst far more often, so your chances of getting a cheaper ticket are better. Z-Pass officially claims: "The condition is that the mode of transport used stops within one of the ZVV fare zones given on the Z-Pass ticket".
* Example 1: You have an all-zones ZVV card and want to travel from Zürich HB to Aarau. If using the S-Bahn S3, which stops at all stations, you need a ticket from Dietikon (the last station in the ZVV area) to Aarau, i.e. a 7 zones Z-Pass A-Welle ticket. However, (inter-)regional (RE, IR) and long-distance (IC, ICN) trains run non-stop to Lenzburg or Aarau (both far beyond Dietikon) so you would need a ticket all the way from Zürich to Aarau: a 9 zones Z-Pass A-Welle ticket.
* Example 2: You have a valid all-zones ZVV card and want to travel from Zürich HB to Zug. If using the S-Bahn S2/S8/S24 and S21, you need a ticket from Horgen Oberdorf (the last station by S21 in the ZVV area) to Zug, i.e. a 4 zones Z-Pass Schwyz/Zug ticket. If using the InterRegio (IR) you will need a ticket from Thalwil (the last call of the IR in the ZVV area) to Zug, i.e. a 5 zones Z-Pass Schwyz/Zug ticket (this is also valid for a ZürichCard). Long-distance trains (ICN, EC) run non-stop to Zug so you will need a ticket all the way from Zürich HB: 7 zones Z-Pass Schwyz/Zug ticket.
* Example 3: You have a valid ZürichCard (valid for zones 110, 111, 121, 140, 150, 154, and 155) and you want to travel from Zurich Airport to Baden by using the InterRegio (IR) to Basel. Then you only have to pay a ticket from Dietikon (the last valid stop by this InterRegio within ZürichCard's valid zones) to Baden, resulting in the purchase of 3 zones Z-Pass A-Welle tickets (valid for zones 154, 184 (you get this zone for free, for convenience reasons), 572, 570). If you want to travel to Basel, then you have to buy a ticket from Dietikon to Basel.
* Example 4: Assuming you are living in Fischenthal (zone 173) and you are working in Rapperswil (zone 180) and you own therefore a monthly/annual ZVV-pass for the three zones 173, 134, 180. Now you want to travel to Schmerikon (zone 995). If you travel via Rapperswil (S-Bahn) and then change there to the regional train (R) to Schmerikon, then you only have to pay a ticket from Blumenau to Schmerikon, resulting in a 1 zone Ostwind ticket for zone 995. However, if you want to take the buses through the hills just for fun along Wald (zone 134) and Goldingen-Egligen (zone 994), and Eschenbach (zone 995), then you have to buy 3 zones Tarifverbund ZVV-OST ticket (valid for the zones 134, 994, 995).

Also, staffed service desks called Ticketeria are available at the major tram hubs, if you need assistance in choosing the right travel pass for your needs. You can also ask the personnel at the ticket counters in any of the SBB-CFF-FFS railway stations within the canton of Zurich as they sell ZVV tickets as well. 

The Swiss Pass by Swiss Travel System is valid on all public transport in Zurich and, if you are a tourist visiting most of Switzerland, this may be your best way to save both money and time spent trying to figure out zones, routes, and fare options. Eurail passes are valid only on the S-Bahn and boats. Interrail passes are valid on the S-Bahn (although the ZVV website claims a "reduction" for other routes for Interrail holders). Nevertheless, you may find you do not need the trams and buses if you do not mind walking around a little.

By tram and bus

Several tram lines and buses (most of them electrified) cover the city at street level. Like all other public transport in Zurich, you purchase and validate tickets before boarding, or risk a fine if they decide to spot check. You can find a schedule at every stop which is accurate to the minute and are most of the time accurate. However, these schedules can be missed, because snow, wet leaves on the tracks during autumn, or exceptional traffic can mix up the schedule. But this does not really matter, since their frequency is that high (every 7 to 15 minutes) you just wait for the next. 

By S-Bahn
The S-Bahn is Zürich's convenient and fast suburban rail system which covers nearly all suburbs of Zürich and beyond. All lines except the rural ones pass through the Hauptbahnhof. The ZVV offers directions for a series of excursions on the S-Bahn.

You must have a validated ticket before you board. If you do not have a ticket you will be liable for an on-the-spot fine (around CHF 100.-).

By boat
There are two types of boat-based public transport operated in Zürich: river buses and lake steamers. The river boats operate in the summer months only and the lake boats operate on a much-reduced schedule during the winter. 

The river buses operate between the Landesmuseum (near the Hauptbahnhof) along the Limmat River and out in the Zürichsee (Zürich Lake) to Tiefenbrunnen. There are several stops along the Limmat River. 

The Zürichsee Schifffahrtsgesellschaft (ZSG) operates lake steamers which leave from Burkliplatz (at the end of Bahnhofstrasse). The ZSG's website provides information on destinations and ships. The ZSG offers a variety of tourist-oriented trips (including Jazz Brunch, and historically restored steamships), and a popular trip is to Rapperswil at the south end of the Zürichsee. The town has a beautiful castle overlooking the lake surrounded by a medieval town.

ZVV fares apply to both boat service lines.

Night buses and trains
Regular bus, tram, and S-Bahn service end around half past midnight. Past that time, a bus and S-Bahn-based nighttime network is available on weekends and connects in 30-minute intervals to the main hubs within the city and the greater Zurich region. There has been a night supplement extra ticket for a while (CHF 5.-), but it's no longer needed as of december 2020. Your normal fare Tickets (see above) can be purchased from any ticket machine or in one of the online apps.

On foot
The main train station, old town and the lake promenade, and all nearby tourist attractions are easily walkable. You may find that you don't need transport for most of your tourist needs once you get into the city.

By skates
Zürich is a very friendly town to be discovered by skates. Car drivers pay attention to skaters and you can use cycle lanes and the tramway's tracks. Pay attention to pedestrians who are more used to meeting bikers instead of skaters!

By bike
You can "rent" bikes, skateboards, etc. for free from 7AM-9:20PM daily May-Oct at several places in Zurich and year-round at the central train station. All you need is your passport and a CHF 20 deposit as a guarantee. This offer is called "Züri rollt" (Zürich on Wheels) You can get and return the bikes at several locations: the bike gate just next to the central station, next to the "Globus City" shopping center, next to the opera, or at the Swissotel in Oerlikon. If you can't find these places, don't hesitate to ask some locals, they should know at least the bike gate at the central station. Nevertheless, you shouldn't count on it because sometimes the "rent" spots run out of bikes.

By car
Driving in Zurich is possible, but it is not recommended, as the city center is not easy to navigate by car and parking is both limited and expensive. See also .

To look at Zürich from the other hills, go to the Irchel (Tram station Milchbuck) or Käferberg (Bucheggplatz, walk up the hill and keep right of the forest).
* Take a trip with one of the two old steam ships. There are a few different routes you can choose from, which will vary mainly in the distance. Or rent a small rowboat.

Events
* It is celebrated as a public holiday, with open-air festivities centered at the Kaserne (between Langstrasse and the main train station) and tens of thousands of visitors. Avoid reaching Zurich on 1 May by car. Also, there could be some minor riots and damage to cars.
* The guilds of Zürich celebrate their traditional spring festival with the burning of the snowman (Böögg). A procession of several hundreds of people with historical guild costumes and horses takes place in the center of the town.
* Currently the biggest open-air techno rave in Europe. It happens one day each year on the second Saturday of August, during which trucks that function as mobile sound systems ("Love mobiles") start driving along the lakeside, starting from the east at Utoquai and ending at the west at Hafen Enge. Every year this event attracts nearly a million visitors who dance in the streets to the music which you can hear from anywhere in the city. After the Streetparade the party doesn't stop, there are open-air parties along the route until midnight and club parties at various locations in town until late the next day, to keep the party going. Don't be surprised if the city's cleanliness isn't up to its usual standard the next day.
* Celebrations are carried out in many cities in the evenings and fireworks are launched at night. Watch them over the lake, or if you're experienced with safely launching fireworks yourself, you can buy them in the days leading up to the national holiday and have fun. The display over the Rheinfall, one hour away by S-Bahn, is also extremely popular.
* It is a weekend festival celebrating Zurich.
* It is one of the largest LGBT events in Switzerland.

An artists coop, a couple of kilometers south, forms along the west bank of Lake Zurich. They have a variety of events, including music, film, and theatre.
* Zurich's Schauspielhaus is one of the most important theatres in the German speaking part of Europe. The Schauspielhaus has several locations, the most important one being the Pfauen. Students can get cheap last-minute tickets (10 minutes before the show) if they show their student ID.

Learn 
*ETH Zürich (Federal Institute of Technology aka Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETHZ) with about 18,000 students from over 100 different countries regularly appears at the top of international rankings as one of the best universities in the world. 21 Nobel Laureates have studied, taught or conducted research at ETH Zurich, underlining the excellent reputation of the institute.
*University of Zurich, (UZH) with its 26,000 enrolled students is Switzerland's largest university. Founded in the year 1833, UZH was Europe's first university to be established by a democratic political system; today, UZH is one of the foremost universities in the German-speaking world. 12 Nobel Laureates have studied, taught, or conducted research at the Univerity of Zurich.
*Zürcher Fachhochschule (ZFH), which puts the emphasis very much on acquiring practical skills, is made up of the Zürich Pedagogical University (PHZH), the Zürich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW), the *Zürich University of the Arts (ZHdK) and the *Zürich University of Applied Sciences in Business Administration (HWZ). It has over 14,000 students who can choose between full-time and sandwich Bachelor's and Master's courses in various studies.
* Cutting-edge research in Zürich is not just carried out at the ETH, the University, or the technical colleges – the whole economic area is like a densely populated yet organically developed science park. Private research centers such as the multiple Nobel Prize-winning IBM Research Laboratory Google's European research centre and the Disney Research Lab have also made their home in Zürich.

Work
Switzerland has a very strict labor market. You will need a work permit visa and a promotion from an employer. 

For citizens of the EU-27 countries, the bilateral agreements make it easier to gain a temporary work permit typically for 5 years that is renewable if you have worked. Often a 1-year permit is issued to EU applicants, as such candidates can repeatedly renew even these 1-year permits. Legally, EU applicants have the same status as Swiss applicants when applying for jobs (employer does not need to justify hiring them, and must hire them in preference to non-EU/non-Swiss applicants if skills are equivalent).

For all other citizenships, you need a company behind you and you must have skills that are rare in the Swiss (or EU!) labor market. 

Working without permission can lead to a night in prison and deportation depending on you and the agreement with your home country.

Buy

For shopping in Zürich there are three different areas in the center:
* Bahnhofstrasse, which runs from the Zürich Train Main station "Hauptbahnhof" right down to the lake. Bahnhofsstrasse is famous for being one of the most exclusive and expensive shopping streets in the world. Here you can get anything from diamond rings to chocolate to high fashion. Globus and Jelmoli are two fiercely competitive department stores, both of which carry items from many high-end brands.
* Löwenstrasse, which runs west of Bahnhofstrasse from the main train station, has lower range shops and a large branch of Migros, a department store chain.
* Niederdorf, which is the Old Part of Zurich and expands from "Bellevue" by the Lake right to "Central" which is just over the River from the train station. The Niederdorf is more for young people. Aside from a lot of fast food places you will find a lot of trendy clothes stores here.

Swiss clocks and watches
You may be disappointed to know that most of the cheap watches and clocks in Switzerland are imported from China and Japan for their cheap quartz movements (including most of the wall clocks and alarm clocks sold at department stores, for example). Don't purchase a "Migros Budget" clock for 8CHF thinking it is a Swiss clock! Nevertheless, real Swiss-made clocks are still well-known for their quality and reliability, and intricate mechanics. The following are true Swiss-made watches:
* Swatch, possibly your best bet for a "cheap" Swiss watch and perhaps better suited for the younger generation. Available in their stores on Bahnhofstrasse and various other locations, or in department stores.
* M-Watch, based on both Mondaine and Migros and available in Migros Electronics stores such as the one on the 2nd floor of the Lowenplatz location. Also relatively inexpensive. Do not confuse this with "M-Budget" which is an imported cheap watch.
* Mondaine is known for its use of the famous SBB railway clock face. You can buy a replica of the SBB clock as a watch or a wall clock in most major railway stations, among other locations. However, you should note that most of them do not replicate the hallmark smooth movement of the second hand for 58.5 seconds followed by the 1.5-second pause that is characteristic of real SBB railway clocks, but they do replicate the clock face. They are quartz, and the price may seem a little inflated to you. The vast majority of SBB railway clocks are actually produced by Mobatime (Moser-Baer AG), not Mondaine, even though Mondaine's name appears on some of the larger clocks such as the Treffpunkt in Zurich HB. Mondaine's wall and desk clocks, however, are only of "Swiss design" and are manufactured in China and Taiwan.
* Mid-range brands can be found at the clock and watch stores throughout the city. Just walk in and have a look if you're interested. The upmarket Globus department store near the railway station also has a good selection.
* Upper-end watches and clocks, such as Rolex, are also sold, but you should probably do more research into them than you can find here. If you just want to stare at some of the most expensive watches for sale, take a look at the Bucherer store window at Bahnhofstrasse and see what a 25,000CHF watch looks like.

Swiss chocolate
Brands
* Frey the number one in the Swiss Chocolate market and is mainly sold in Migros supermarkets. It is offering premium quality for a customer-friendly price. Having a market share of almost 35% it is well established in the market. It is 100% Swiss and produces as one of the few Swiss manufacturers from bean to bar. It also is present in more than 60 export markets on all five continents. In export, it is beside the Frey branded chocolates very often also available under Private Label offers such as those from Marks & Spencer, Loblaw, Tesco, Coles, Woolworths, and many more. Chocolat Frey is accessible by taking S-Bahn line S3 to Aarau (42 min) and then the local bus number 1 to the stop "Industrie" (8 min). Chocolat Frey opened its new visitor center which takes you on an interactive journey through chocolate (open from Tuesday to Sunday, 10:00 am - 5:00 pm, groups of 10 or more are asked to register).
* Lindt is available at the Coop and other supermarkets besides Migros, but Lindt chocolates are also sold at the factory store which is accessible by taking the S-Bahn S8 to Kilchberg (12 min) and then bus 163 to the stop "Lindt & Sprüngli" (2-3 min). Hours are limited (M-F 9AM-5PM). The factory store prices are somewhat lower than supermarket prices (on the order of 10-20%), but there are some sale items, including factory rejects (for underweight chocolates, improper packaging, or filling showing through) that are sold for roughly half-price. The Lindt factory used to offer tours and free samples, but this is no longer the case.
*The larger Coop supermarkets carry many brands, including Lindt, Camille Bloch, Goldkenn, and others, including all sorts of alcohol-filled chocolates.

Confectioneries

* Sprüngli, Löwenstrasse 49, 8001 Zürich, It offers a variety of sweet and savory goodies including a wide variety of chocolates, from hand-made truffles to special chocolate bars. There are locations throughout the city, including Bahnhofstrasse and inside Zurich HB. Some specialties include the Luxemburgerli, a sort of soft macaroon resembling a hamburger in looks but are actually completely pastry and cream, and comes in a variety of flavors; the Truffe du Jour, a chocolate truffle that is made daily from raw cream and is meant to be consumed immediately; and the extraordinary Grand Cru Sauvage truffle, made from wild cacao beans from Bolivia. Most items are rather pricey but worth it. The flagship store on the Paradeplatz is a very popular spot for breakfast, lunch, and afternoon tea. Try their berry-filled muesli, it's like no other muesli you've ever had. There are two handy stores at the Kloten airport for last-minute gifts to bring home.
* St. Jakobs Confiserie, Badenerstrasse 41, The background organisation, Behindertenwerk St. Jacob, aims at providing jobs for disabled people.
* Teuscher &mdash; An upscale confiserie that specializes in truffles. There are three stores in Zürich: Bahnhofstrasse 46, Storchengasse 9 and Jelmoli Department Store.

Swiss army knives
* Coop City in Bahnhofstrasse sells the Victorinox line at uninflated prices, although you won't get additional features such as customised faceplates or engraving. Many other department stores also sell them.
* Any cutlery shop will probably carry both Victorinox and Wenger lines of products. However, do make sure they are not inflating the price. For example, a SwissChamp (possibly the most popular model). 

Swiss handcrafts
* Schweizer Heimatwerk, Uraniastr 1 (on the Limmat river), Also branches in the Hauptbahnhof (main station), airport, and Rennweg 14 in the Bellevue area. Quality Swiss handcrafts and other Swiss-made products presented in a gallery-like setting. You won't find many cuckoo clocks and the like here (cuckoo clocks are not really Swiss, they are from the Black Forest (Schwarzwald) in Germany!), the emphasis is on real traditional crafts and the work of modern craftspeople. You will find things like sleek modern hand-blown glassware and beautiful hand-carved wooden items from the Appenzell region. A worthwhile visit even if you just browse.

Markets
* Flohmarkt Bürkliplatz (Fleamarket), Bürkliplatz (in the Bellevue area near the Stadelhofen station). May-Oct Sa 6AM-3:30PM. Fairly relaxed yet large flea market with many interesting stalls.
* Flohmarkt Kanzlei (Fleamarket), Helvetiaplatz, Open Sa 8AM-4PM. A big fleamarket that hosts up to 400 stalls on busy days.

Other
* Orell Füssli The Bookshop, Bahnhofstrasse 62. An English language bookstore.
* Pastorini Spielzeug, Weinplatz 3 (near the river). A high-end toy store.

Eat 
The quintessential Zürich dish is Zürigeschnätzlets, chopped veal in a cream and wine sauce, normally served with Rösti. Various kinds of grilled Würste (sausages, singular: Wurst) are also popular. These are most often accompanied by boiled potatoes, or Rösti, a kind of hash-browns, just much better (boiled potatoes then grated, then pan fried in butter until crisp) or Chn&ouml;pfli (small noodle dumplings, in Germany, called Spätzle). 

In general any kind of different meat (veal, beef, pork, lamb and mutton, chicken and other poultry meat, or even horse (considered to be very delicious and of high quality), and rabbit and venison during hunting season in autumn) you can find in many various dishes. In quality-aware restaurants they originate from a personally known, local source and are normally served with fresh, local, and seasonal vegetables, besides standard side dishes.

While Fondue (melted cheese in a central pot, dip bread into it) and Raclette (cheese melted in small portions, served with potatoes and pickles) are not really local to Zürich (they originally come from western French-speaking Switzerland) and consumed by locals only during the winter season, they are available at some restaurants aimed at tourists even in summer. 

The bread available in Zürich is generally delicious. There are many varieties, and your best bet is to go to a bakery or a supermarket in the morning or just after work hours when most people are doing their shopping and bread is coming out fresh. A typically Swiss bread is the Zopf, a braided soft bread made from white flour, milk, eggs, butter, and yeast that is commonly served on Sundays (the other name for it is Sonntagszopf, or in High German Butterzopf), or its luxury version called Buurezopf (Farmer's Zopf) made with Buuremehl (Farmer's flour, a combination of wheat and rye) instead of white flour only. 

Try grilled Bratwurst from street stands, served with a large crusty roll of sourdough bread and mustard, or sandwiches made with fresh baked Bretzeln (large, soft pretzels; an original Bavaria treat and just recently "imported" by a shop chain). 

For breakfast, try a bowl of (Bircher-)Müesli, which was invented by Dr. Bircher as a health food in Switzerland. The Sprüngli confectionery store tea rooms serve a deluxe version of this fiber-filled cereal with whole milk, nuts, fruits such as crushed berries, and cream. 

There is a huge variety of cheeses available at the supermarkets, specialty stores, and markets, as well as all kinds of hams and dried sausages. Dairy products are generally delicious, especially butter and yogurts. Do not miss the supermarkets! You should take a thorough look through Migros or Coop and maybe even assemble your own lunch or dinner sometime. Even the cheap, budget prepackaged desserts in the supermarket exceed the quality of what you may be used to. 

Generally, locals prefer local and seasonal produces, though the prices for them are usually higher. The demand for so-called Bio products (aka organic products) is so high that local farmers cannot fulfill it, and therefore a large part of organic produces is imported, but probably come along with less thorough quality checks than the Swiss are usually used to.

For those with a sweet tooth, there's a huge variety of chocolates to enjoy, from the cheapest chocolate bar to individually hand-made truffles. (See the Shopping section above). The chocolate bar displays at the supermarkets will overwhelm you! Also, enjoy pastries and cakes from the various Konditorei scattered around town. In pastry shops, you can also find special pastry from Zurich. The most famous of them probably is Tirggel, a rather hard pastry made of flour and honey. Although traditionally made and eaten during the winter holidays, many pastry shops (including larger supermarkets) sell them throughout the year. Often, they've got sights of Zurich printed on the top, which can be stored for months and thus make up a pretty good and cheap souvenir. Another famous type of pastry is Luxemburgerli exclusively sold by the confectionery chain of Sprüngli (part of the famous chocolatier Lindt & Sprüngli). A typical cake is the Mandelfisch, an almond cake shaped like a fish. 

Like most European cities, Zürich abounds with Cafés where you can enjoy a leisurely cup of coffee, a glass of wine, or other beverage, and watch the world go by. 

There are many international dining options available, too. The current hot trend seems to be pan-Asian noodle/rice/sushi places. However, due to the far distance to the sea and the lack of original, well-trained Chinese/ Japanese cooks, the quality cannot live up to that of the original countries. Instead, Italian cuisine holds the highest popularity among foreign restaurants. They can be found throughout the city and are relatively cheap. Turkish fast food restaurants are also a delicious, cheap option.

Vegetarian food is easy to find throughout the city. Vegans may have a little trouble because cheese is used generously in most food, but should be fine living off supermarkets at the very least. Hiltl, the first vegetarian-only restaurant in Europe, is also worth a visit. You choose from the buffet, where your meal is priced by weight, or from a variety of à la carte menus, which are a bit more pricey but include vegetarian/vegan versions of popular Swiss meals like Züri-Gschnätzlets or Beef Stroganoff amongst Indian food and classic vegetarian plates. Another vegan-friendly restaurant is "Bona Dea", which is located directly at Zurich's main railway station.

Budget 
* Offers delicious Thai dishes to budget prices. Great pit-stop in a Langstrasse pub crawl.
* It is a typical Swiss restaurant with good food and cold beer. It is located in the Red Light District (Langstrasse) of Zurich and is not the ideal place to bring children or acquaintances. Gambrinus looks like a pub more than anything else, but the staff are friendly and speak English. Try the Zürigschnätzlets mit Rösti or the Fondue (one of the best in Town). Prices are from CHF 14 onwards.
* Offers great pizzas, large hamburgers, spicy kebabs, and other Italian and Turkish dishes at reasonable prices. The staff is very friendly and the service is great. Perfect for lunch or a late-night snack.
* 
* 
* Zurich's most famous sausage stand near Bellevue tram stop. Red or white sausage, a piece of bread, and (hot!) mustard is included. Currently located across from the Globus between Bellevue and Stadelhofen train station in a silver travel trailer.

Food courts
* The Migros and Coop supermarkets (several branches all over the city) are good places to assemble an inexpensive and delicious picnic lunch consisting of freshly baked bread, cheese or ham, and fresh fruit. Migros Gourmessa is the 'gourmet' takeaway counter, available in larger Migros stores including the Migros City branch at Löwenstrasse. The Coop Bahnhofbrücke branch near the main station also has a small fast-food restaurant. Note: the Migros branch in the main station is open on Sundays when most other stores are closed, and also until 9PM on weekdays, whereas the Coop Bahnhofbrücke is open 7 AM to 10 PM every day except Sunday. At 8PM the Coop Bahnhofbrücke discounts much of their picnic fares like sandwiches and cheeses by 50% making it the cheapest meal in town. Just look for the large red stickers in the sandwich section.
* Jelmoli, St. Annahof and Manor department store restaurant for a cheap buffet lunch, good salad, and vegetable stand. All are located at Bahnhofstrasse and open during the day.
* In the basements of the Jelmoli and Globus department stores you find the most excellent, but also highest priced food, which can make your self-prepared meals equally expensive as a restaurant visit.

Mid-range 
* Restaurant in complete darkness, served by blind people. An amazing experience.
* Excellent pasta and a busy atmosphere.
* Italian food served late.
* Has the warm feel of an old pub. The house specialty is horse steak, served on a hot stone with fries.
* This relatively new branch of the Globus department store in the Bellevue near the Stadelhofen station is totally dedicated to food. There is a large eatery on the ground floor that serves various fusion-type foods (a decent noodle bowl) and a passable sushi bar. The ground floor has a gourmet food market, and upstairs there are kitchen wares.
* The oldest vegetarian restaurant in Europe (from 1890).
* Tex-mex food in the trendiest part of town, with the best margaritas in Zurich.
*

* Yet another Pan-Asian noodle, rice, and curry joint. Also has a sushi bar.

* Not a real pub or café, they only serve wine or water. But if you succeed in climbing over the roof beams, you get a free glass of wine to drink hanging upside down and you can mark your name on the wood afterward.
* Unrelated to the U.S. Outback Steakhouse chain. Enjoy Aussie tucker-like ostrich, kangaroo, and crocodile, as well as more conventional fare. Popular with locals as well as ex-pats. Has a hopping bar scene (see Drink section). There's also a branch in Winterthur.
* Typical Swiss food including Älplermacrone (pasta with apple purée). Excellent cocktail bar, too.
* Fresh Mediterranean cuisine. Be it pizza, pasta, fish, or meat, you'll enjoy the food. Lavish and quiet terrace on the river in Summer, relaxed and generous rooms in colder times.
* A solid place serving up classic Swiss fare, mainly for tourists. Serves fondue year-round.
* The fast-food outlet of Hiltl, Europe's oldest vegetarian restaurant. Offers a nice self-service buffet of fresh veggies and fruit and a surprising variety. Try the freshly squeezed juices.
* Great place for Asian food. Crowded, closed on Sundays.
* A very good Italian restaurant in the old part of the city (Niederdorf). You should try the Spaghetti al Bacio! Closed for lunch on Saturday and all day on Sunday.
* Offers hearty sausages, stews, rösti potato etc. in a Brauhaus-like setting. Touristy, but good and large portions. Housed in a historical building, built in 1487.
* Offers beer hall fare such as sausages and pork shanks in a somewhat refined setting. The restaurant features a beautiful painted ceiling.
 
Splurge 
* Romantic cuisine in a beautiful building.
* Grill restaurant that offers set menus for lunch and a menu surprise for dinner (either fish or meat). Also has a good wine selection and is very nice in the summer due to a small garden
* The city's most famous restaurant where all the glitterati goes to see and be seen. Good Swiss food and heavenly chocolate mousse are one reason to go, the opportunity to dine among original artwork by famous Swiss and European artists who paid in paintings instead of money. Dress nicely and treat yourself to a drink at the classy bar before or after your meal.
* Traditional French-Swiss food from the French-speaking Kanton Waadt (Vaud). One of many fondue restaurants in Zurich. Mains 25-40CHF.
* 17 points from Guide Gault Millau and one star from Guide Michelin proves that traditional kitchen with Catalan influences as one of the best restaurants in Zurich.
* Very authentic Swiss high-end restaurant. To ensure your meal does not get cold, they split your order into 2 plates and bring you one at a time.

Drink 
Zurich has a lot of places to go out. There are a lot of clubs (around 80 at weekends), restaurants, Cafés, bars (around 500) but also many museums and theaters, one opera and two classical concert halls. The most common drinks in Zurich/Switzerland include Beer. 
 
During the last 20 years, virtually all of the large Swiss breweries have been closed by or sold to huge, foreign owners. Nevertheless, as a kind of counter-movement, numerous tiny and small regional breweries have been founded and are extremely successful, especially in Zurich (such as: TurbinenBräu, Amboss (Back und Brau), or Hirnibräu Another well known Swiss beer and quite well known in Zurich is Vollmond by Brauerei Locher, Appenzell. 

There are many different sites at which local wine is being cultivated and produced (Lac Léman (a majority of white wine: 68% Chasselas), Valais, Ticino (mainly red ones), around the three lakes of Neuchâtel/Biel/Murten, Grisons in order just to name a few major sites). Local productions are almost exclusively consumed locally, only 1-2% are being exported. On average, a Swiss citizen drinks 50 bottles of wine every year Because of the high local request, prices can be quite high. About 170% of the local production quantity is imported from different areas: France and Italy (34% each), Spain (14%), and Germany (4%), as well as from Portugal or South Africa. There are countless many local culinary products you can enjoy, often depending on where you are:

Stay safe
Zürich, like most cities in Switzerland, is relatively safe. Nevertheless, be on guard for thieves and pickpockets. Carry your wallet or purse in a secure way, not in your hip pocket or a backpack's outer pocket. In particular, thieves are known to operate around the Zurich main train station. Do not let your bags out of your sight for even a moment.

Public transport is very safe.

If you decide to bicycle in the city, understand that Zurich is a city of public transport. Beware of tram tracks which can get your wheel stuck and send you flying into traffic, of the trams themselves which travel these tracks frequently (and may scare you into getting stuck into the track as just noted), and the buses, which make frequent stops in the rightmost lane. In short, bicycling downtown should be only done by those experienced with cycling with such traffic.

Gay and lesbian travelers — Zurich is the favorite place to live for Switzerland's (German-speaking) gays and lesbians. The Canton of Zurich was the second canton, after Geneva, to allow registered partnerships for same-sex partners. The city of Zurich is probably the place in Switzerland that offers the most open environment for gays and lesbians. Gays and lesbians need not take special precautions for their safety on the streets. It is always possible for random homophobic behavior to happen, though.

Contact

Cope
Permanence Hauptbahnhof at the main train station provides urgent outpatient care for tourists without prior appointments. There is also a dentist downstairs at the station. For serious emergencies rush to "Kantonsspital", the university clinic which has a 24/7 emergency ward. Tram stop "Universitätsspital" (look out for the golden boy in front, then follow the red "Notfall" signs). They will not send away people with serious, urgent health problems. The ambulance phone number is 144.

If you're on a budget, don't stay out too late — the "N" night buses only run on weekends. When they run, they run only every 30 minutes. On work nights, there is no public transport at all after about 12:30AM (although expensive taxis still exist in case you're stuck).

Stores are generally closed on Sundays including all supermarkets in the city, except those in the main train station and airport. 

On Sundays, there are supermarkets open at the following train stations: Zurich main station, Enge, and Stadelhofen.

Zurich has two police departments, the Stadtpolizei Zurich which is responsible for the city area, and the Kantonspolizei Zürich which is responsible for the whole region. With approximately 1800 and 3000 employees, these departments are the biggest in Switzerland. While police officers in Zurich will happily help you out if you are in trouble or need information, they are also known for approaching "suspicious" persons in order to check their papers. This procedure is annoying but legal as you will probably have a hard time proving you were not acting suspiciously. Carry a photocopy of your passport and your onward ticket with you, stay calm and polite and you probably won't have much trouble.

* . Take a 45 min train ride to see the largest waterfall in Europe, the Rhine Falls. Take the train from the Zurich Airport or Zurich HB (central station) to either Winterthur then transfer trains to Schloss Laufen (from April-Oct) or Schaffhausen then take the city bus #1 or #6 to Neuhausen Zentrum. Schaffhausen is a pretty town located very near the Rheinfall. It is not located within the ZVV area. You can travel either via Winterthur or via Bülach. If you already have an all-zones ZVV card and you are using the S-Bahn S16 (which takes an hour), you should buy 4 zones Z-Pass FlexTax ticket. If you take the S33 from Winterthur (you have an all-zones ZVV card), you only need a 2 zones FlexTax ticket. Another option are regular trains (RE, IR, IC) from Zürich HB (only 38-41 min), or a combination of S5/S22 (change at Bülach, although in the peak, the S5 is instead extended to Schaffhausen), which all travel via Bülach and Eglisau to Schaffhausen. If you do not own any ZVV card/ticket (e.g. as a tourist), then this option is even cheaper: you then only pay 9 zones Z-Pass FlexTax ticket, instead of an all-zones Z-Pass FlexTax ticket for the journey via Winterthur.
* Rapperswil-Jona — Pretty town on the other end of the Zurichsee, accessible by S-Bahn S5, S7 or S15 (35-40 min), or boat (tip), famous for its rose gardens, beautiful old town with a castle and many lake-side restaurants and cafés.
* — Since in winter there is little to do outdoors, people flock to this city, the city of museums. It can be reached by taking regular trains (26 min), or by S-Bahn S7 (34 min), S8 (28 min), S12 (21 min, fastest), or S16 (30 min).
* — A pretty town, accessible by S-Bahn S29 from Winterthur, where S7, S8, S12, S16 and regular trains connect from Zürich, or via Schaffhausen. It is not located within the ZVV area. If you have an all-zones ZVV card and you will travel with the S29 from Winterthur (total time from Zürich is 65 min), then you only need 2 zones OSTWIND ticket.
* . A cozy town just outside Zurich. Accessible by S-Bahn S6 (38 min), or S12 (28 min). It is not located within the ZVV area. If you have an all-zones ZVV card, you should additionally buy a 3 zones Z-Pass A-Welle ticket. If you do not have any ZVV ticket/cards (e.g. as a tourist), you should consider taking the much faster half-hourly and direct IR train which takes only 15 minutes to Baden. Then you pay 5 zones Z-Pass A-Welle ticket.
