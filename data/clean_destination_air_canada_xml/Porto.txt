Porto is 's second largest city and the capital of the .

Understand

Porto is a busy industrial and commercial centre. The city itself isn't very populous (about 300,000 inhabitants), but the Porto metropolitan area (Greater Porto) has some 2,500,000 inhabitants in a 50km radius, with cities like Gaia, Matosinhos, Maia, and Gondomar.

The city was built along the hills overlooking the Douro river estuary, and its historical center was awarded by UNESCO in 1996. It has been continuously inhabited since at least the 4th Century, when the Romans referred to it as Portus Calle

Porto has a semi-Mediterranean climate, although it's strongly affected by the Atlantic ocean, which makes it cooler than other cities with this climate. However, temperatures can rise as high as 40ºC in August during occasional heat waves. Winters are mild and humid, with occasional cold nights where temperatures can drop below 0ºC. 

Porto has always been a mercantile city, and this is evident in the style of the buildings lining the Avenida dos Aliados, the core of the downtown area. The center of town, unlike other major Portuguese cities, which tend towards the baroque, is granite and monumental. Residents of Porto are known as Tripeiros (tripe eaters) due to the fact that the city went without meat in order to provision the capital and the fleet that departed to Ceuta in 1415, had to subsist on tripe stew, still a speciality of the city.

Citizens of Porto hold themselves apart culturally from the South of the country, mainly Lisbon region, as is expressed in the often heard phrase "o Porto é uma nação" (Porto is a nation). This is due to the centralisation of government decisions in Lisbon, which the inhabitants understand it is not always fair for the North and Porto especially. They often say "Porto works, Braga Prays, Coimbra studies, and Lisbon gets the money."

Outsiders used to often consider Porto to be more crass and mercantile than the rest of the country, due to the lack of rehabilitation the city urgently needed. Since the beginning of the century the city has been going through a major reconstruction and now has a more clean and pleasant feeling, attracting many new visitors. Its inhabitants may have a more harsh first impression but they are known for being very nice, accessible and will help you with anything they can.

The city is officially styled "a muito nobre, sempre leal e invicta cidade do Porto" (the very noble, always faithful, and invincible city of Porto). This is usually shortened to "a Cidade Invicta" (the invincible city) a title won because of Porto's resistance to the "Cerco do Porto" (Porto's Siege) during the 1832-34 civil war. 

The city is quite varied architecturally, with medieval as well as modern living side by side. Porto's geography is hard on the feet, but pleasant to the eye. The city is extremely hilly, with many buildings built into a cliff face that overlooks the river. Stairs cut into the stone run up and down the cliff face and offer a laborious but rewarding walking tour. Across the river from Porto proper, in the suburb of Gaia, are located the warehouses of notable companies dealing with Port Wine, such as Cálem, Fonseca, Sandeman, Kopke, and others.

Whilst the local attitude is friendly, to outsiders it is worth noting that locals can respond literally to questions, which may seem slightly off-putting to the uninitiated. An example of this would be to ask in a bar if they have a menu (for food) and to receive a straight 'no' as a response; it's after further questions that one can find out that the establishment doesn't sell food - such a response is not considered rude, it is merely direct and literal.

If you speak in Spanish to a local, you will be largely understood and as a rule they will freely converse with you, but from time to time, more so with the older generation, you may be politely reminded that you are in Portugal and the native language is Portuguese.

Get in

By plane
 Francisco Sá Carneiro Airport, (), Pedras Rubras, Maia +351 229 432 400, . Also known as Aeroporto do Porto or Aeroporto de Pedras Rubras this is the third busiest airport in the country and is about 15km from the city centre. This airport has been awarded since 2006 as one of the best airports in Europe and one of the best in world in its category, it offers really good conditions to all of the passengers since it has been remodelled in 2004 at the same time that the EURO 2004 was organized in Portugal. Just outside of the airport at Platform B is the GetBus. For €2.80 one way/€5.10 return for adults (advance purchase online, 2020) you can reach the Porto Bus terminal (Campo 24 Agosto) in the city centre in 25 mins, but operates only in the daytime. Buses are not always marked on the side of the vehicle so check its destination at the front of the bus, and arrive 15 mins prior to departure in either direction. A similar taxi trip will cost €20. 

The Metro line connects the Airport to the city centre, offering a fast and peaceful ride into the heart of the city, for €2.00 + €0.60 for the rechargeable ticket (type Z4). You can buy 24 hours pass for Metro and buses for €6.20 (Z4 - includes the airport). To reach the city centre, exit at Trindade or Bolhão stations. Casa da Música is also a popular stop, but a bit removed from the city centre. Use it to visit Casa da Música building or if your hostels is in the Boavista area.
At night, after 01:00, the only regular connection is an hourly bus coming from Av. dos Aliados (line 3M) - using a taxi or spending a night at the airport are the only other possibility.

Ryanair offer cheap flights from several cities like , , , , , , , Bordeaux, , , , , , , , , , , and . easyJet also flies to , , , , , , , and .

TAP flies from most European airports and some American airports (Newark, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro) though their presence has become less significant in the past months.

By train

The city is served by two major train stations, the "São Bento" (Saint Benedict) station, and the "Campanhã" station. Trains from and to Madrid (Lusitânia Comboio Hotel) and Paris (Sud-Expresso) are regular. If you come in the Lusitânia train, you'll have to change in Coimbra to an Intercity train to Porto and the Sud-expresso starts at Hendaye/Irun, from which you'll have to change to a TGV train. Other non-domestic destinations vary according to demand and time of year. Domestic trains are very frequent and usually on time. Be careful on the train from Madrid. On at least one route, the computer systems will say you need to change trains at Guillarei in northern Spain. However, Guillarei has stopped trains through Portugal since 2004. Instead, you will need to transfer to a station named Tui which is a few miles from Guillarei. The computer system hasn't been updated even though this change occurred in 2004 for some reason. You can go into Guillarei but you will need to take a taxi (cost €5) to Tui to connect. Sao Bento station is right in the city centre. 

Coming from Galicia, there are two Celta trains daily from , one in the morning and one in the evening. This trains call at just a few stations in Portugal. There are also two other trains but they're much slower and complicated requiring train changes on the way.

By car
The city is served by five major highways: A1, which connects Porto to Lisbon, A29 which connects Porto to Aveiro, A3 connects Porto to Spain, A28 connects Porto to Caminha next to the Spanish Border, and A4, which goes eastwards from the city towards Bragança and the Spanish Border close to Valladolid. The A43 connects Porto to the neighbouring city of Gondomar and the A41 (see below). The A33 connects the A20 to Oliveira de Azeméis. 

The city is also served by 2 ring highways, the A41 which is the outer ring, and VCI/IC23 or A20 which connects all the main places inside the city. 

The A20/VCI and A43 (although there are tolls, but those are for the A41 highway) are free highways. A28 doesn't charge tolls until after the airport. The A1, A3 and A33 are charged by a private company in physical tolls. The A29 and A28 are charged only with automatic tolls, witch, if you are using an foreigner car, you'll have to pay them in advance after entering Portugal using a highway or in a CTT post. The A4 and A41 are mixed charged. 

Generally speaking, the traffic is usually chaotic and very intense, especially during rush hours.

By bus
There are many companies providing direct bus trips from major European countries and also for most of the northern cities of the country. Try Rodonorte for timetables.

From Galicia, ALSA runs up to three non-stop services from (11:10 to 14:15, €31), picking up at along the way at 12:30. Alternatively, AUTNA runs regular services (reduced schedule on weekends) from Vigo.

By boat

 

There is a new very modern (2016) Cruise Terminal in Matosinhos (20 minutes by car from the city center). The light rail system (see "By Metro" below) that goes to Oporto has a stop not far from the terminal.

There is also a very small recreational harbour in the river Douro. As far as a major method of getting to the city, however, sea transport is not really feasible. However, you can use tour boats based along the river (especially in Oporto) to go up the Douro River, one of the most scenic short trips you'll ever make.

Since 2012 you can also find the new marina in Vila Nova de Gaia (south side of the river)that has smaller and recreational boats.

Get around

By car
Porto, like most Portuguese cities, can be difficult to drive in. Roads vary in conditions - from fully paved to cobbled lanes that can make even the shortest of distances vary in time. With that said, keep in mind that the touristic part of the city (the Ribeira and Baixa) can be a maze of narrow streets, local drivers and snakelike alleys. Better to walk, despite the fact that it's very hilly. Be prepared to follow the natural course and rhythm of driving.
Some car rental companies:

*First Rent A Car 
*Hertz
*Avis
*Europcar
*Gold Car (several people have had bad experiences with this company)

By metro

Porto Metro is an incredibly advanced, state of the art light rail / subway system. Developed in 2001 (for the Porto2001 - European Capital of Culture), the metro is still under construction. It has six lines, that run across the centre of Porto, and out to some suburban areas. It is quick, and probably the most efficient way to get around Porto. Some major areas of the city, however, are not that well served by the metro, although new lines are planned and should start being built soon. 

Tickets must be purchased beforehand. They can be bought at the machines in the station (note: if there are no tickets in the machine that day, take the metro to the next station and buy it there!). The ticket is printed on a card called "Andante", and you can purchase as many rides (or travels) as you want, in the zone you are staying in (Porto and surrounding area Z2. Matosinhos Z3. Airport Z4). One trip will take you anywhere in your zone, and you can travel as many times as you want within one hour. If you plan on using it again, Do Not throw away the card! The card can be re-charged (the card itself costs around €0.60). You can also buy daily passes, which is more convenient. 

Be warned that once an Andante card is bought, it is "locked" to the type of ticket which you have bought, and cannot carry more than one type of travel ticket. For example, if you purchased a 24 hour zone 1-2 card, you can only recharge it to another 24 hour type of card. If you wish to travel outside of of the zones within the 24 hour card, then your only option is to buy another card and lock it to single trip (known as titles) travel. Whilst it is possible to change between a single trip card and a 24 hour card, you can only do this at the ticket office in Metro or train stations, and only when the single title/24 hour pass has expired.

To extend a 24 hour card to include more zones, you must wait until that card has expired. For example, if you buy a zone 1-2 card on a Monday, at 15:17, and wish to travel to zone 4 on Tuesday, you can only change the zonage at 15:18 on that Tuesday, after the previous 24 hour card has expired. It is not uncommon to see locals have more than one card, and to see them infuriated at having to carry multiple identical looking blue cards for every travel eventuality.

If you plan on living in Porto, or staying for more than three weeks, it is recommended you get the "Andante Gold". The card costs €6, and will allow unlimited travel, without a time limit. However, the zoning system is a lot different in the "Gold" version then in the "Blue version". There are around 11 zones in Andante Gold (C1, C2, S11, etc.) The centre is C1. When you buy the card, you must purchase another zone (C1 is automatically included). The Andante Gold can be used on all metro lines, the funicular and all buses. When you are buying the Andante Gold, you must have a picture of yourself (your passport photo will do. They can amplify the image from the passport to the card in seconds).

An important note: your andante must be validated before you enter the metro, bus or funicular. There are no barriers to stop you at the metro, but the Metro police enter the cars and check your Andante to make sure you have validated it, and are travelling within your zones.

By bus
 STCP is the best way to move around if you don't want to waste money on taxis. It's the public bus operator in the region, and the only one operating inside city borders. Suburbs are served either by STCP or private companies. STCP buses are the largest eco-friendly fleet in Europe, modern, comfortable, and lines cover the entire city, as well as major suburbs.

Bus colours are white and blue. Line numbers are a 3-digit code. First digit is assigned according to the destination zone (2-west porto, 3-north porto, 4-east porto, 5-matosinhos, 6-maia, 7-valongo, 8-gondomar, 9-vila nova de gaia). For example, line nr. 906 has its destination in vila nova de gaia (9).

You can use two kind of tickets: Andante (see "Metro" above) or STCP own tickets. Andante tickets are recommended: you can also use them on metro and suburban trains, plus they're easier to buy and recharge on any metro station or newspaper seller with "payshop" symbol. Andante blue card costs 0.60€ and can be charged with how many journeys you like.
Every bus stop has at least a timetable and lines served. There's also a code so you can get a (paid) SMS showing minutes left to next arrivals updated in real time. The busiest ones have electronic displays with timetables and city maps. Every bus inside has a display showing the name of next stop, so it's easy to keep track of them.
STCP route 500 is one of the most scenic bus routes crossing Ribeira 's main museums and sights and continuing along the river and then the Atlantic towards Matosinhos 
STCP also possesses a fleet of old trams of which three are still in operation mainly for touristic purposes. Route 1 runs along the river from Ribeira to Foz while routes 18 and 22 cross the city center's main sights.

By taxi
A fast way of getting around the city, although traffic congestions near the city centre might be a problem. However, be expected to pay a high price for these services, especially compared to the other public transportations such as bus and subway.

By boat
There are ferry boats that connect Porto to the neighbouring city of , although you can easily walk or travel by car, metro or bus to the other side. Also the are numerous tourist boats which travel up the Douro river, where you can get fantastic views of the green landscape the region has to offer.

By helicopter
Not exactly a public transportation, but it's a wonderful way to see the city from above. Near the Douro there is a heliport with a helicopter available for people to use to get to know the city as a whole. Travelling accompanied will make the flight cheaper.

By Funicular dos Guindais 
This is a cable railway system. Use this if you don't wish to walk up the steep streets of Porto. This system connects the Ribeira to the Batalha square, in the city centre, it also has a panoramic view of the River Duoro. As of August 2013&, a single trip cost €2. However, if your Andante card (see "Metro" above) has been recently validated (in less than one hour), that you can ride it for free

By Ascensor da Ribeira 
This panoramic elevator runs from the Largo da Lada, and is visible behind the buildings of the Ribeira, close to the Ponte D. Luís.

See

The first place to begin with is the Ribeira, the part of the city near the river, which is also a good place to start visiting the World Heritage area; to the other side of the river you will see the Ribeira de Gaia, a similar area from the city of Vila Nova de Gaia (the two are only separated by the river) and where you could find the Port Wine Cellars. Next go up to the São Francisco church and the Stock Exchange palace nearby, where you can visit the most impressive Arab room in the country. The world known Modern Art museum at Serralves and the Casa da Música (House of Music) concert hall live in the area known as Boavista. From there you can reach the amazing ocean front drive, known as "Foz". Go back to the centre of the city and visit Mercado do Bolhão, a traditional market of fruits, vegetables, fish and meat. Next the Aliados and the City Hall and finally the 6 bridges connecting Porto to Gaia over the Douro river, many of them providing an excellent view to the river.
Porto is a mysterious city that reveals its charm to the visitor through time. Take your time, wander through the mazes and alleys of the city. Take in the old, bohemian spirit of the city. Hike through the Ribeira and Foz do Douro regions (the latter, at sunset). Porto may not be in every tourist's Iberian Peninsula itinerary, but it's well worth a visit if you want to see a city that has changed economically, but that has kept its old traditions, something that is being forgotten in Europe today.

* 

Do

* Visit FC Porto Museum where you can see more than 120 years of history from one of the most successful football teams in Europe. Opened every day.

*Take a cruise upriver - the cost is about €10 and takes about 50 minutes, or you may also choose a day-long cruise for a higher price. Go at least as far as Pinhão - the landscape is absolutely stunning. If you choose to do this in the summer, don't forget your factor 50 sun screen! Look for cruises picking up on the Vila Nova de Gaia side (the same as where the port caves are located), as some of them may offer discounts for cave tours or port purchases.

*Take a port wine tour and visit the various wine caves! This is a must as Porto is the port wine capital. The cellars are in Vila Nova de Gaia, a 5 minute walk from Ribeira across the Douro river, and there are extremely convenient bus pick-ups from easily accessible areas to take you up the winding hills to the cellars. Tours vary in price but generally cost €3-5 and include a tasting. Most all have English speaking tours along with Spanish, Portuguese, and French. There are also quite a number of cellars offering free tastings.

*Visit the Dragão Stadium, home of FC Porto. The team has a rich history, having won the World Club Championship or Intercontinental Cup twice, Champions League twice, UEFA Cup twice and UEFA Supercup once - and the stadium is worth a visit on the architecture alone. If you are lucky you might get to see a game of the Champions League... also, just across from the stadium you have a large shopping centre, according to a joke built to block the wind from affecting the stadium.

*If you feel creative and up to an artistic challenge, take this opportunity to participate in a workshop oriented by local artists and craftspeople. Be sure to take home, not only the memory of the moment, but also the sense of accomplishment through the work produced. Tile painting, glass fusing, gilding, seat weaving, printmaking, creative sketching.

*There're many music festivals in the city, the most interesting ones are Trace Made In Africa (end of June) and Electro Festival (beginning of July). You can check more events in the city in , Portugal section. Porto has quite good club scene. There're many events occurring in summer time.

Work
Porto is a business/financial centre. Some hotels have conference rooms, some with internet.

Buy
For shopping, take a stroll around the Mercado do Bolhão which has a food market and handicrafts stores, and Santa Catarina street (highly recommended, even if only to stroll), which is near Bolhão. Cedofeita street is also a busy shopping street, as well as Boavista. Porto and the suburbs have plenty of shopping centers, including Norte Shopping, Arrábida Shopping, Parque Nascente, Gaia Shopping and Mar Shopping (the biggest IKEA group shopping in Europe). Apart from these you also have less populated shops that are smaller but still great ( Shopping Cidade do Porto, Via Catarina, etc). Almost all the shops are open every day, but are usually overcrowded during the weekends and rainy days. 

Port wine, of course. This is the right place for it, in the city of Gaia, just south of the Douro river.

You can also find great deals on clothes and shoes, especially during discount seasons.

Eat
Porto has some of the finest restaurants in Portugal.

It is said that if you like to eat, you should go to Porto because it is a place where you eat well in terms of quality and amount.

Expect hearty meals, and if you can, try "Tripas à moda do Porto". Be aware, however, that this is a tripe dish. Citizens of Porto are called tripeiros (tripe-eaters) on account of this dish. Also try the salted codfish "Bacalhau" - in any way it is cooked - there are hundreds of different dishes with salted codfish! 

Don't forget the traditional dish called "Francesinha", which literally translated means little French lady. However, in many other northern Portuguese cities you can find a low quality version of it. Essentially it is a toast with layers of meat inside (beef, pork meat, ham...). It is covered with cheese and a spicy sauce, with the option of including french fries on top. Most importantly, this dish must be accompanied by beer and not wine. The "Francesinha" has been considered one of the 10 best sandwiches in the World.

A good tip is taking the bus or subway to Matosinhos in July, there will be the fish festival. Freshly caught fish is being served the same day at barbecues lined up in the streets just a few blocks from the main beach. You choose a fish (only whole fish) and they prepare it on the streets for you - not a fancy restaurant, but together with the local people you are eating the best tasting fish you ever had! Try a dourada, it is delicious. 

Porto is dotted with thousands of different bakeries (Pão Quente) and pastry shops (Pastelarias). Apart from serving delicious (and quite inexpensive) goods, they are also equipped with a side-cafe that serves all sorts of coffees (Pingo, Meia de Leite, etc.) and sandwiches (Tosta Mista-ham and cheese toastie). Note that, unlike the other river side cafes in the city, these establishments do not have picturesque views of Porto (that's expensive, and in the end, you'd be the one paying for that bill). Instead, they attract tourists by offering good food at very cheap prices.

Most locals drink black coffee (espresso).

There is at least one fully vegetarian restaurant in Porto, Paladar da Alma (Rua de Santo Ildefonso 293/5), and some other restaurants which offer vegetarian dishes alongside non-vegetarian options, such as Capa Verde (Rua da Nossa Senhora de Fatima). Vegans may have to ask for dishes to be specially prepared for them, even in vegetarian restaurants.

Budget

* Retiro Do Jardim (with logo of Christiana Cafes) - Campo Mártires da Pátria, 44. For 6 euros you get a homemade soup, main dish like Calamari/Cod fish/Steak with salat/beans, and a drink (soft drink, beer, wine). Staff tries hard to speak english and their Menus are in english, spanish and french, so it's not hard to make an order even if you don't know a word of portugese. Food is excellent for the price! 

* Chien Qui Fume (Cão que fuma) - Rua do Almada 405. One of the oldest and most traditional restaurants in Porto, the food here is superb, and one serving is enough for two people. Small and quaint, with rustic decorations, it is packed to the gills (especially during the weekend), so reservations are recommended. Does not accept any credit or debit card, so take some money with you.

* Centro Cultural Miguel Bombarda, Rua Miguel Bombarda. Right in the middle of the artistic centre of the city, it's a great and cheap place for lunch!

* Âncora d'Ouro (the golden anchor), between the Cordoaria park and the Praça dos Leões. 

The third oldest cafe in Porto, it is commonly known as "O Piolho" (the Louse). The cafe looks out on the street facing a faculty of the Universidade do Porto, and had been a meeting place for students since the 19th century. Plaques donated by graduating medical classes from the early 20th century onward decorate the walls. During the fascist period (1926-1974) it was a regular meeting place of "undesirables" (according to the regimes point of view), and was accordingly under regular surveillance by the secret police. On one occasion it was raided by the GNR (Guarda Nacional Republicana) who have a post nearby, and they charged their horses into the cafe itself. It is uncertain if the place's current disorder results from this or more recent activities. Service is surly, the place isn't at all fancy, but it is usually stuffed to the gills with students. It's also quite cheap.

* Casa Adão Avenida Ramos Pinto, 252 VILA NOVA DE GAIA. 
Located on the other side of the Douro river, is a restaurant that serves generous plates serving one hungry person or two who eat normally.

* Tà-se Bem Largo Sampaio Bruno 25, Vila Nova de Gaia

As one of the last restaurants along the river in the Gaia area,it was a great place to stop and have a lengthy lunch before heading out to do some port tasting. With delicious and hearty selections for a good price, it is also very popular with the local crowd-- during lunch it was completely full of people who work in the area. Skip the touristy cafes and head here for a authentic experience.

*Basic interior but very high quality food! Try the beef steak for two (€20). Bottle of wine between €5-10.

* Mauritânia Grill - Avenida Combatentes Grande Guerra 50,Leça da Palmeira 4450 Matosinhos 

Nice restaurant with excelent views over the Leça Beach. The space is very light with many windows and it has its own parking lot. The decoration varies around the year (one of the few restaurants that does that) for eg. Summer, Christmas, Halloween, Easter etc.
The employees are usually kind and funny. They care about the client. Sometimes they play pranks on you, so don't be surprised if they simulate that they are spilling coffee on you.

Excellent Italian restaurant. Wide variety of dishes. Extremely small, so it's best to call ahead and reserve a table.

* O Paparico - Rua Costa Cabral 2343, 4200-232 Porto A great restaurant serving food using best quality Portuguese ingredients.

* Café Majestic - Rua Santa Catarina, 112, 4000-442 PORTO. One of the oldest cafés in Porto. Inside, the scent of leather upholstery and varnished wood is joined by the magnificent vision of the plaster-decorated ceiling and of the endless Flemish mirrors, is an ensemble that marvels all senses. Add in the combination of marble and metal and it becomes truly exquisite.

Drink
Porto is home to port wine of course, and there are many wineries around the city where port wine is matured. Strictly speaking, port wine can only be called port wine if the grapes are grown in the Douro valley, and the wine is produced and bottled in Porto. Port wines come in many styles, with vintage port being the most expensive.

Bars & Pubs
In the recent years Porto's bar scene has mostly moved to the city center around the "Galerias de Paris" area, close to Av. dos Aliados. Here you'll find two streets full of bars and a couple of night clubs. The area starts getting busy around 22:00 and most bars stay open until 4:00. The dance clubs (Plano B and More) stay open until morning.

Other relevant areas are:
*Cais de Gaia This is a bar region in riverfront area in the neighbour city of Vila Nova de Gaia. It's a modern zone for bars and clubs, usually priced a little higher than normal bars. You have a great view of the river and the beautiful city of Porto.

*Praia do Ourigo Beach bar in Foz. Has to be the bar with the best view in town. Set on stilts over the beach. Has a restaurant too.

*Prioridade Located in the Ribeira region, this bar is one of the cheapest in the area. It's probably the only decent place in the whole of the Ribeira region (and probably, in the city) where you can get a large beer for only a few euros. They also serve spirits and cocktails, at very cheap prices as well. My suggestion, if you are planning a night out, is to get loaded at this bar before clubbing, since the price of drinks in the clubs can be outrageously high and you may find yourself with no taxi fare money to return to your home, hotel, hostel, etc. It's quite tricky to find, since it's tucked away in a rather isolated (but quite nice) place; it's near the D. Luis I bridge. Ask the locals, they'll know where it is.

*Ribeira region This area is full of bars and pubs where you can have a pleasant time with an incredible view, before going to the bigger clubs around the city. Most bars are relatively close to each other, and in some there is no entrance fee. Usually most of these bars close c. 03:00, after which the area becomes deserted. Be sure to go either home or to a club after, because when this area becomes deserted you may feel a bit insecure.

* Ryan's Irish Pub. In the Ribeira, nice cosy atmosphere and friendly bar staff. Always a good place to start 

*Tapas Bar 24, Travesa Do Carmo No. 24, +351 917 166616. This small bar located in an alleyway south of Rua Carmo, 100m west of the University, is one of the cheaper places in Porto to drink. Beers from €1, the bar also has small sandwiches and other tapas-style snacks. The owner, Helder, is extremely friendly. There is a laptop that customers can use to play their own music (please watch your drinks around the computer!). Popular with university students, it's a great place to meet friendly locals. If you go early in the evening it's a quiet bar to enjoy drinks, but later on students show up and turn it into a dance party. Highly recommended.

*Trintaeum In the Foz area near the lighthouse, quite small, cool decoration, and cool crowd and not too pricey. Open till very late.

*Triplex On the Avenida Boavista in a big old house. Fantastic garden bar which is great in the summer. There's a restaurant upstairs too.
* White Hart Sports Bar. Watch live football, eat from an English and South African menu and view a gallery of signed world football memorabilia. On Rua do Breiner, just up the road from Torre dos Clérigos, along Rua do Cedofeita.

* Catraio, Rua de Cedofeita 256, +351 934 360 070. A bar and beer shop selling locally brewed craft beers from the growing craft beer scene in Portugal, with small tapas. The owners are very knowledgeable, and have a rotating number of beers on tap. Good for those who tire of Super Bock. Very highly recommended.

Stay safe
Be aware that there may be in heavily crowded areas and on public buses and trains; however, pickpocketing is not common in Porto. Travelling by bus or metro is generally safe and one of the best ways to go from a place to another.

Porto is generally a safe place to be if you take normal precautions like walking in well-illuminated streets at night. 
One part of Porto, near the Tourist Information Office between the cathedral and the steps to the small church, often has drunk people that could possibly be trouble. There's no reason for alarm as they are mostly harmless, but it is best to use some caution, as you would elsewhere.

If you take the main road from the bus station to the cathedral and tourist information center, walk back to the bus station after you're done and then walk from there to the other sites. Avoid the shortcut from the tourist information center downstairs because near there have been many incidents there.

Call 112 if you have an emergency.
