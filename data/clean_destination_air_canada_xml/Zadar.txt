To get from the inter-city bus station (and train station) into the center of Zadar, or the old town, a local bus stop is located on the main road just outside the station. Bus (costs 10 Kuna) number 2 or 4 will take you directly there, the journey is only five minutes. Taxis (costs 20-40 Kuna, ask first) will also be waiting, however, be advised they have a reputation for ripping off tourists, charging much more than the officially posted rate (as much as five times higher). Do the world a favor and catch public transport or walk - walking will take you about 10-20 minutes dependent upon your location in the Old Town.

Note that many boats now arrive and depart from the "new" ferry terminal, around 5kms from the old town. A public bus is available, inquire at the Jadrolinja office in the old town or check on RAFT Croatia website. Taxi fare was quoted at around 80 Kuna (tourist prices). Uber is a great alternative to taxies.

By car

By Cruise Ship

Zadar is a stop on lots of Adriatic and Med cruises. The ships normally dock at the "new" ferry port south of the town center, and not particularly walking distance to the center. A shuttle will normally be offered to the Old Town by your cruise line, often for a fee, and will take around 15mins.

Another option is to take a public bus. Take bus #9 from a stop near the cruise terminal, and transfer to bus #2 or bus #4 to get to Old Town. In May 2016, the cost was 10 kunas.

Get around

The Old Town is easy enough to get around on foot. To reach the bus/train stations you can walk or catch one of the frequent local buses (bus 2 or 4 will take you there from the Old Town).

Buses in Zadar are relatively new and well maintained, and you will be able to catch a bus to any part of the city from the main hub in the city called Mala Pošta (Little Post Office); ask any local where this is and they can direct you to it. A bus ticket in one direction costs 10 Kuna (cca. US$1.75) while a two way ticket costs 16 Kuna (cca. US$2.80). However, two way tickets are only available for purchase at newspaper stands, although they are easy to find. One way tickets are available for purchase upon entering any bus. Buses are run by Liburnija; an online timetable is available.

Be advised that bus services cease just after midnight during the summer, so if you plan to get back to a hotel that isn't close to the city center after that time, you might have to walk or catch a taxi. Do not attempt to board a bus without a ticket, without purchasing a ticket or avoiding stamping a bus ticket. Bus drivers in Zadar are notoriously militant about enforcing payment, and you could get into trouble.

Taxis - a trip of up to 5 kilometers (enough to get almost anywhere within the city) may cost up to 80 Kunas, as the taxi drivers have a habit of overcharging tourists. Inquire first, as it will be almost impossible to find a taxi for the advertised price of 20-40 Kunas (circa US$3.5-7). Ask before you get in the cab - there should be a printed price list, although many drivers will not obey this list. There are taxis waiting on both sides of the bridge in the Old Town, and around the bus/train stations.
