Knoxville is in , . It is the third-largest city in the state. It is the home of the University of Tennessee's primary campus (UTK) and site of the 1982 World's Fair.

Understand
Knoxville is on the Tennessee River about an hour from the . Once called the 'scruffy little city', the downtown is undergoing a rapid renaissance as young people move into the lofts and apartments created from the factories and warehouses of another era. On any evening of the week, throngs of residents and visitors can be seen at the sidewalk cafes, theaters, restaurants and night clubs along Gay Street and Market Square. The University of Tennessee, with its 27,000 students, is within walking distance of the downtown, separated only by the World's Fair Park.

One can still see remnants of the 1982 World's Fair in the Sunsphere, a rising structure topped with a gold sphere which dots Knoxville's skyline, however, most of the other structures from the Fair were removed to create a large city park which attracts families, students, and artists on weekends and sunny days. The World's Fair brought a lot of attention and development to the city, including high-rise office structures, and the four-star Hilton, Crowne Plaza and Marriott hotels.

Knoxville is home to the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame, but the city seems dominated by the University of Tennessee Volunteers (men only) and Lady Volunteers athletics. The basketball teams play in the 21,000+ seat Thompson Boling Arena, and the nationally recognized football team plays in Neyland Stadium, one of the largest on-campus stadiums in the world at 103,000 seating capacity. During the fall you will find plenty of orange in the foliage, but you will see Big Orange year round with the people of Knoxville.

The city is also the home or birthplace of a number of cultural figures, such as authors Cormac McCarthy, James Agee, and Alex Haley, and filmmaker Quentin Tarantino, who mentions the city in all of his films (remember the watch in Pulp Fiction?) The Everly Brothers attended high school here and began performing on radio in Knoxville. Dolly Parton began her career in Knoxville. Senator Howard Baker, actor David Keith, film director Clarence Brown and opera singer Mary Costa, better known as the voice of Disney's Sleeping Beauty, are all from the Knoxville area. Less culturally - actor, stunt double, comedian and all-around daredevil Philip John Clapp aka Johnny Knoxville is from the city.

By bus
*Greyhound, 100 East Magnolia Avenue, +1 800 231-2222, National bus service.

By boat
The Tennessee Rivers run through Knoxville and is accessible by personal watercraft. Many boaters routinely navigate the Tennessee River for both pleasure and travel.

Get around
Although parking is usually easy to come by in most of the city, it may be mildly difficult at times to locate adequate parking downtown and around the University of Tennessee. Walking is convenient downtown, but in other areas, most major roads are not amenable to pedestrians or bicyclists. In the outer areas of the city, because bus service is infrequent and some places don't have sidewalks, traveling by car is the way to go.

Public transportation

*Knoxville Area Transit, or KAT KAT runs a bus service throughout the City of Knoxville and parts of Knox County. Unfortunately, most KAT bus stops are served on an hourly interval, so exploring Knoxville via KAT bus is somewhat difficult. However, the recent opening of an ultra-modern Downtown Station bus terminal should greatly improve public transportation within the city. All KAT buses are equipped with flip down bicycle racks and many are powered by biodiesel or other alternative fuels. KAT operates special routes for some events, a downtown trolley service, and bus services for the University of Tennessee.

*Knoxville Trolley Lines The trolley runs several free downtown and University routes during business hours and one "Late Line" route on Friday and Saturday nights during the University of Tennessee fall and spring semesters. Most daytime stops are served on ten to twenty minute intervals.

Biking and walking

Knoxville is slowly building a paved greenway system that allows cyclists and pedestrians to travel into downtown from nearby suburbs such as Sequoyah Hills and Island Home.
*Bearden Village Third Creek Greenway Beginning at Bearden Elementary School on Kingston Pike, the Third Creek Trail parallels Sutherland Avenue as it follows Third Creek's wooded path. When the trail ends at Neyland Drive, pedestrians and cyclists can continue on the Neyland Greenway to access Volunteer Landing, the stadium, and parts of the University of Tennessee campus. A spur of the Neyland Greenway connects to the World's Fair Park near Neyland Stadium.
*Sequoyah Greenway Technically, the Sequoyah Greenway is a gravel walking/running path located in the median of Cherokee Boulevard, the main road of one of Knoxville's wealthiest neighborhoods. However, cycling the broad boulevard roadway is a pleasant and reasonably safe ride for a casual or serious cyclist. Keep right and most automobiles will have more than enough room to pass you safely. Sequoyah Hills Park and the Tennessee River parallel much of the boulevard's southern side, and the park is a wonderful place to stop for a picnic. The northern side of the street is lined with stately homes. Much of the Sequoyah Hills neighborhood is pedestrian friendly, so be sure to explore a few of the leafy side streets. The trail is accessible at several parking areas along the boulevard, and at the Laurel Church of Christ parking lot (use the crosswalk at the intersection of Cherokee Boulevard and Kingston Pike.) A spur of the Third Creek Greenway leads to the Laurel Church parking lot. Be advised that this spur is extremely steep and not in the best repair. Bicyclists may need to dismount and small children will need lots of help.
*Jean Teague Greenway Beginning at West Hills Elementary School and terminating at West End Church of Christ, the Jean Teague Greenway is an ideal trail for walkers and families with young children. As the trail passes through West Hills/John Bynon park, it divides to form a loop and winds around numerous athletic fields and playgrounds. Near its midpoint, the trail crosses Winston Road near the YMCA. Parking is available at the elementary school when school is not in session, at the park entrance on Winston Road, and at West End Church of Christ on East Walker Springs Lane. Those wishing to continue on to the Cavet Station Greenway may do so by exiting the church parking lot and traveling westbound on East Walker Springs Lane.
*Cavet Station Greenway The Cavet Station Greenway follows the heavily traveled Gallaher View Road from the intersection of East Walker Springs Road to Middlebrook Pike. Although this may someday be a useful link between greenways, it is a less than idyllic experience for a recreational biker. Nearby residents do seem to make use of it as a convenient exercise path for jogging. A sidewalk is on the opposite side of Gallaher View, and there is a cross walk at the intersection of Walker Springs Road. A Wal-Mart and Sam's Club are located just off of the western side of Gallaher View Road.

Entering the the southern end of the square from Union Avenue, one may pass the bell from the old Market House as well as a statue commemorating Tennessee's role in the fight for women's suffrage. Dotted with benches and tables, Market Square is a lovely place to spend a few hours browsing the shops, dining with friends, or watching children play in the small fountain. A lucky square patron may happen upon anything from a pair of cellists playing Beatles songs to an ice cream give away.

Do
Outdoors

With its ancient beauty and diversity of plant and animal life, the Smokies are a hiker's paradise with over 800 miles of trails. The park and surrounding park areas offer a host of activities, including camping, fishing, auto touring, horseback riding, sightseeing, and more.

*House Mountain State Natural Area.

An interpretive kiosk, picnic facilities, and approximately 5 miles (8.0 km) of trails were constructed in the early 1990s. The park gets quite busy during the "nicer" months of the year.

*Fishing The Tennessee River's bass producing waters feature an abundance of fishing opportunities.

Stay safe
In general, Knoxville is a relatively safe city. Practice the same precautions you would in any other mid-sized American city -- for example, lock your car and don't leave valuables sitting in plain view in your car. Low-income areas downtown should be traversed carefully.
Avoid the area around University and Fifth. You don't even want to go there after dark. This is not at the University of Tennessee. Be careful where you park in the "Old City" area. It's right next to the mission district.
