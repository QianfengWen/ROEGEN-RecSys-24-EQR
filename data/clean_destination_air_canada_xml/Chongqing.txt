Chongqing (重庆; Chóngqìng), (formerly spelled Chungking), is an economically important municipality in West and is the biggest inland municipality of the country with plans for even more massive growth. The term "Chongqing" can refer to either the city of Chongqing (urban area with a population of approximately 8,518,000) or the Chongqing municipality (much large administrative area including non-city areas and a population of over 30 million). 

Chongqing is also the launching point for scenic boat trips down the through the Three Gorges Dam. The Buddhist are located three hours west of Chongqing City in the outlying Chongqing Municipality and is listed as an UNESCO World Heritage Site. 

Understand

Chongqing is one of four municipalities in China. Chinese municipalities are large administrative districts that report directly to the national government but are not a province. China has 3 similar municipalities: Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin. Chongqing municipality is the largest directly controlled municipality in China. While no longer part of Sichuan province since 1997, it was historically and culturally part of it and still shares the same love for hot and spicy food dishes.

Chongqing was temporarily the capital of the Republic of China during World War II, after Nanjing was occupied by the Japanese. The capital was subsequently relocated back to Nanjing after the Japanese surrendered in 1945.

Neighbouring provinces: Hubei (east), Hunan (east), Guizhou (south), Sichuan (west), Shaanxi (north)

Located on the edge of the Yungui Plateau, and surrounded by small green capped mountains, Chongqing City is intersected by the Jialing River and the upper reaches of the Yangtze. It contains the Daba Shan in the north, Wu Shan in the east, Wuling Shan in the southeast, and Dalou Mountain to the south.

Climate
Chongqing has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate with plenty of rainfall throughout the year, measuring 1.108mm on average. It is one of the least sunniest places in China, with 24% possible sunshine every year. Winters range from chilly to cold (the average January temperature is 7.9°C or 46.2°F) with very small temperature variations, around 4°C (7°F). Nights usually feature lows around 6°C (42°F), near-freezing conditions should be expected though. Lows at or below freezing point are extremely rare, since the Siberian winds don't make it this far south and are blocked by Qin Mountains. Snow is also a very rare occurrence. The lowest temperature ever recorded is -1.8°C (28.7°F). Days usually feature highs around 10°C (50°F). There is a little amount of precipitation during these months. Summers are hot and very humid. Chongqing is actually one of the hottest and least pleasant places in China during summertime. Temperatures almost never fail to reach 30°C (86°F) and occasionally surpass 35°C (95°F). This, combined with very high humidity (74% during August, which is the hottest month) makes the heat sweltering. During heat waves highs may reach 40°C (104°F), so that the highest temperature ever recorded is 43°C (109°F). Spring and autumn are transitional seasons and inarguably the best periods throughout the year to visit Chongqing.

*Chaotianmen Station, Buses to points eastward (, , , etc.)
*Chen Jiaping Station, Buses to the west and in particular towards .

Get around
The use of bicycles may not be a safe option due to the driving etiquette and custom in the city is generally poor.

First timers to Chongqing should also be warned it is easy to get lost due to the many hills and valleys found within the city.

The bus systems and monorails are advised as the best forms of transportation as they are cheap and efficient.

By metro/monorail

The first part of Chongqing's new rapid transit system opened as a monorail in 2005. The system was only useful for getting around in the city center, but major expansions have now linked major railway stations, major shopping districts and the airport, with more extensions under construction. Announcements are made both in Mandarin and English. No smoking is allowed and all services are airconditioned, which is a reason alone to board one from April to September! Don't forget your electronic ticket card to get out of the station. If you overshoot your stop just go to the service counter and add value to your card.

Line 10 Liyuchi to Wangjiangzhuang, is the metro line running north-south and connects major transportation hubs including North Railway Station and Jiangbei Int'l Airport.

By bus
Buses are frequent and cheap, but unless you can read Chinese you have to know where they are going and choose the right number bus going in the right direction. If you are going to one of the city centres in Chongqing, simply ask each bus if they go there. There are four city centres, so be sure you know the name of the place you want to go to. 

The four city centers in Chongqing are called Shapingba (Sandplains)(GPS 29.559900-106.457440) NW part of town and is an academic and university centre, Jiangbei (Northplace)(GPS 29.577000-106.528000), Nanping (Southernplains) (GPS 29.530531-106.561379) and Jiefangbei (GPS 29.560454-106.573400), which is one of the oldest centres and a shopping centre and near Chaotianmen harbour where there are lots of small markets and shops (often called the "fleamarkets" locally)(GPS 29.566742-106.583977). 

The bus station in Shapingba is at GPS 29.559300-106.455450. There are two bus stations in Jiefangbei, south and west of the monument. There are two bus stations in Jiangbei near the pedestrian street.

By taxi
Taxis in Chongqing are bright yellow small sized Suzuki sedans. They are relatively cheap, though more than similar cities due to a strong taxi union (starting at ¥10 and ¥2.0/km, ¥11 and ¥2.3/km after midnight) and can be easily found 24 hours a day. Few drivers speak anything but Mandarin, so you must know where you are going. Either have your destination written for you in Chinese, learn how to say it, or be able to direct the driver. A good way to use taxis is to gather cards from hotels, then simply show the driver the one you want to go to or is nearest to your destination.

Caution: Empty Taxis are hard to find on extremely hot days. It is advisable to seek alternative transportation or stay indoors. The reason is due to the fact that most Taxis have A/C running thus making more frequent stops to the natural gas station. Added to the fact that there aren't many natural gas stations around and the pump pressure is frequently inadequate, most taxis will be stranded lining up for gas.

See
On the surface, the city appears rough around the edges and a bit grungy and thus there may appear to be not much to do, but further investigation will uncover a city with truly its own character and a number of interesting sites actually worth looking into.

Chongqing served as the capital of the Republic of China for seven years during the late 1930s and early 1940s during the Anti-Japanese War (World War II). With this political history comes a number of historic sights which are worth visiting. Chongqing has the largest population in West China and is the focus of China's "Go West" strategy to help further develop the western part of China. As a result, it is a very lively and rapidly modernizing city, although it does get a bit hectic at times.

* Zhou Enlai worked as a member of the Communist Party alongside Mao Zedong. Located by the Jialing river north west of Jiefangbei, and now a museum and open to the public for a small fee. It has been preserved as it was the day it was used.

* Near Jiefangbei, a recreation of the old Chongqing, clinging to the side of the mountain with many small shops. A tourist place but you can find recreations of old local crafts here and genuine local food.

*A large public square at the confluence of the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers. Here you can see the importance of the river trade to Chongqing with nice views across the river to the new Chongqing Grand Theatre. Many river cruise ships terminate nearby and the night lights are spectacular to see.

* A very traditional Chongqing hill town trail, lots of young people and a steady stream of tourists, sometimes music festivals in summer, also the ruins of the ancient city walls, large green lawns and stone piers, and lots of filming and live streaming. You can drink beer here, blow the evening breeze and enjoy the summer in Chongqing.

* A renovation project partnered with Harvard University transformed this Republic era banknote printing factory into an artsy space that has gained nationwide popularity. Located at a hilltop in Yuzhong District, TestBed 2 is not just another spot for enjoying the mountainous cityscape, but also a great stop for the best restaurants, bars, cafes and designer shops in the city. From here, a short hike up to Eling Park will take you to the highest viewpoint on the Yuzhong peninsula.

* When Chongqing was the capital of China during WW II, Jiang Jieshi (Chiang Kai-Shek) established his military headquarters up in the Nanshan mountains above Chongqing, on the East bank of the Yangtse River. As a result the Japanese bombers never found it, and it is now a museum, preserved as it was during the war. There are many buildings in the beautiful compound and you can visit his work room with the motto over his desk "all officials must serve the people" (in free translation), his bedroom, and his meeting room, and sit in his chair where he negotiated with the American advisers, with his American educated wife usually to his left. The location is a bit out of town. Bus can take you there but a taxi is the easiest transport. Ask for 抗日遗址博物馆.

* Jiefangbei stands in the most prosperous downtown center of Chongqing. Jiefangbei, or the People’ s Liberation Monument, formerly known as the Monument of Victory in the War of Resistance (usually called the "Anti Japanese war"), is a 27.5 meter highs structure. It is the center of the city marked as Chongqing’s commercial heart, itself completed at the end of 1997, is 400 meters from east to west, and 350 meters from north to south, covering an area of 24,400 m². Around the square are more than 3,000 stores various kinds of shops, with more than two dozen large malls and shopping centers, dozens of star-graded hotels, and offices such as banks, stock markets, trade and finance companies, postal and telecommunication services, and places of entertainment. It is isolated by broad, paved pedestrian square and numerous glassy office skyscrapers and highrise hotels, reminicent of 's or 's district.

* Chongqing people say: "Foreigners go to Jiefangbei, locals go to Guanyinqiao", this is the place for locals to buy things and go shopping. It is also known as the No.1 pedestrian street in the Western China, which is on par with Sanlitun in Beijing or Xintiandi in Shanghai.

* Located in Jiulongpo District, it is a commercial bustling pedestrian street with many shopping malls and restaurants, which should be no less than 5,000 stores. You can also go to often authentic hot pot.

* The Yangtze River Bridge (Caiyuanba) is a coiled road with a newly renovated observation deck next to it, where you can watch the view from the bridge at night. It also brings business, where many businesses sell water, binggao, liangxia, bingfen and other Chongqing's local food.

* Chongqing's Great Hall of the People (and the People's Square in front of the Hall) is an architectural symbol of Chongqing City. Its construction began in 1951, but its design is traditional and mirrors those of China's ancient classical dynasties. It somewhat resembles an enlarged version of the Temple of Heaven in Beijing. The People's Square was only completed in 1997 and is decorated with trees and flowers. The ground of the square is paved with smooth marble tiles; there is magic music fountain; at the southern end of the square stands a stage for performances in the open air. You may see thousands of people dancing on the square in the numerous beautiful lights in the evening.

* This is one of two Guomingdang prisons located in Shapingba, the other being Bai Gong Guan. Both are located at the base of Ge Le Mountain in Lie Shi Mu. A shuttle bus ticket may be purchased for ¥20 in front of the entrances to Zha Zi Dong and Bai Gong Guan, providing transportation between the two prisons and other nearby historical sights. Another shuttle bus (T003) runs between Ciqikou and Bai Gong Guan for ¥10 (round trip). Za Zi Dong offers a unique look at a 1940's era prison and the horrors that took place there when nearly 300 communist political prisoners were massacred at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. The entire area was also once the location of the Sino-American Cooperative Organization (SACO), a camp where Jiang Jie Shi's (Chang Kai Shek) elite troops were trained. Unfortunately the attrocities that took place and the American presence are often connected, while it's not universally agreed that they were. 

* Red Rock Village (Hong Yan Cun, located near Shapingba centre on the road following the river) is a very important tourism site in Chongqing City. This is the location where the Chongqing Negotiations between Mao Zedong and Jiang Jieshi (Chiang Kai-Shek) took place, and the historic aspect of the place is nice. To get to the history, you will have to go through an exhibition center which is worth going to.

* Not far from Red Crag Village is the former residence and office of General Joseph W. Stilwell ("Vinegar Joe" Stilwell), who headed American operations in China during the Anti-Japanese War. Stilwell is an impressive person, not only for his leadership ability but also for his understanding of China and Chinese culture (he could write in Chinese with a brush). His former residence is a 1930's modernist house with great views overlooking the Yangtze river. The main level is set up as it was during Stilwell's tenure. The lower level is filled with photos and bilingual descriptions of the Chinese Front during the Second World War.

* Another interesting site to visit (especially if you're staying at the Hilton Hotel) is Song Qing Ling's former residence, from the period of the Second World War when Japan occupied much of China and Chongqing was the temporary capital. There were three Song (also spelled Soong) sisters. The eldest married a businessman. Middle sister Qing Ling married Sun Yat Sen, the founder of modern China. She was herself an important political figure, especially after his death. The youngest married Chiang Kai Shek. A saying about them is "One loved money, one loved power, and one loved China". Qing Ling is the one who loved China. There is an interesting movie with an English soundtrack and a book, "The Soong Dynasty" about the family. This house wedged in between tall, ugly buildings is a nice German design (the original owner was an engineer who studied in Germany) that is not unlike many of the pre-liberation colonial architecture that can be found here and there in and around Chongqing. The house is located about 100 meters south of the main entrance to the Hilton Hotel.

* Meaning "Porcelain Port" as porcelain has long been made & transported from here, located in ShaPingBa, on the banks of the Jialing River. This is a step back in time with several streets of Chongqing as it was, (and still is in some places). It is mostly comprised of small shops selling tourist stuff, but does lead down to the river where it is possible to board a restaurant boat and where the present Hostel is located. The temple at the top of the hill is worth a visit. Worth a visit for a couple of hours. Unlike similar places in China, this one is still in its original state and not a reconstruction. Walking uphill away from the river and main tourist area, it is still populated by regular families and homes as it has always been.

* A temple complex including a Buddhist monastery and a large golden Buddha overlooking the whole place. Tucked in a green valley on a small lake, surprisingly in the middle of an urban built up area of Chongqing City.

*On the banks of the Jialing River, this is a newly developed park housing many original and relocated historical buildings when Chongqing was China's wartime capital. It includes old bank buildings, government offices and the residences of local warlords. Some military pillboxes are also preserved here. Here you can see the strange view of the light rail passing through the buildings. The light rail reduces its speed and does not affect the residents above, and the entire facade is covered with graffiti.

* Built in 1890 when Chongqing opened its port, while the Treaty of Yantai forced Chongqing to open its market. With the wharf, there was a flow of people coming. This old street, since then has had all kinds of food and fun, and is a good place for walking.

* You can walk from the old street of Bouncy Stone, along the riverside road, all the way to here (passing a bridge). The bustling area of Chongqing can be seen at a glance. The street is narrow and delicate, the road is made of stone and looks a bit old. There are selling all kinds of goods, dining and tea houses. 

* The mountain city of Chongqing really has a lot of trails. This was once a must-go place for ancient Sichuan and Guizhou, also known as the "Silk Road of Chongqing", the ancient road was first walked in the Tang Dynasty. Now there are many eateries where you can drink tea and have food. There is a path in the road that leads directly to Laojun Cave Taoist Temple. If you do not go to Laojun Cave Temple, you can come to the top of the mountain in an hour. The exit on the mountain is the Old Huangjiaoya Street 黄角垭.

* The entrance is across from the University of Posts and Telecommunications and is similar to the general old street. As it is on the South Mountain, many lodges and hotels have been built along the mountain. You can eat hot pot and watch the scenery from above. Not very long, there is a glass walkway to the side.

* In Banan (巴南) district, there are some antique-style buildings, plus a variety of eateries and snacks to stroll around at night. It also overlooks the Baling River.

* There is a safari park inside, and an amusement park. You can drive yourself in the safari park. ￥200.

*Huguang Guild Hall in Chongqing is the largest Kongsi complex found in Chinese urban cities. It dates back to Qing Dynasty and is now listed as a national heritage site. This beautifully restored architecture also serves as a museum that displays artwork and furniture of hundred years old. 

* A destroyer named "168" is moored here, and the pier is very large. ¥50.

Eat
Local food
Chongqing is a harbor city and with this comes what is called dockside culture (matou wenhua). This culture is blamed for a lot of things from cursing to...Hot Pot. While many great restaurants abound in the city, memorable dining is best along Nanbin Lu with incredible night views back across the Yangtze River with the city skyline lit up.

Jiao Chang Kou Night Market (较场口夜市) at the intersection of Bayi Road and Zhonghua Road. It is the largest night market in Chongqing, with about 30 to 40 stalls alongside the road. Because it attracts a lot of tourists, the prices are not cheap. But in general is okay. There is also a Haochi street (好吃街) next to Bayi road, which is also full of restaurants. Because they are right next to the Jiefangbei, they also attracta a lot of people off work. Also, on Tongkang Road (同康路), you can ask for Caijia Night Market (蔡家夜市, Cài Jiā Yè Shì). There is also the S. Garden Shiji Night Market (南方花园夜市) near KeyuanSi Road.

Hot Pot
Hot Pot (huǒguō, lit.: firepot) is one of Chongqing's claims to fame. In cities across China, one can find hot pot restaurants, but only Chongqing people can really stand a real hot pot, so if you want authenticity, get it while you can in Chongqing.

When ordering hot pot you have a a choice between three kinds. First, the spicy version called red soup (hong tang). Then there is one without any spices. This is basically a bone soup, and it is tasty. To get this, simply ask for "yuan wei" or tell them "wǒ bú yào là de” （我不要辣的）which means "I don't want the spicy stuff!" Finally there is a compromise with Yuan Yang Hot Pot (Yuan Yang Huo Guo), which is basically a pot split down the middle with the spicy stuff on one side and the mild on the other. 

For those who like spicy but do not like it too spicy, it is possible to order red soup without the jolt (wei la hong tang). It is a nice mild experience.

Tourist center
There are three tourist centers in the shopping pedestrian street at the Guanyinqiao metro station (Line 3). 
The one close to the station exit is near the end of the pedestrian street to the south (walk straight ahead when leaving the station through Exit 2). The map next to the information booth pin points the other two booths in the area.
The tourist center seems to be sesonal, since they were never opened when we were there (30 Mar - 8 Apr).

Shopping
If you're looking for IT and computer related items, go to Shiqiaopu (stop 10 on metros' red line), and exit through Exit 4, then make a right. All the buildings facing the road up to the over pass intersection sell cell phones, laptops, headphones, video cameras, compact cameras, DSLRs + lenses, printers, LCD screens, and computer related items. If you need computer parts, the building behind the last (closest to the over pass) mall is the best. They've got motherboards, CPUs, GPUs, PSUs, RAM, cases, network equipment, computer accessories (cables, mice, coolers, fans, USB cams, etc). You can even find chineese made vacuum tube amplifiers here.
In the weekends there are stalls set up between the malls and the main street, selling everything from cell phone cases to puppies.

Stay safe

Given its size, Chongqing still remains relatively safe thanks to strong law enforcement. However, minor crimes like pickpocketing and scams are still happening. Use your common sense when dealing with street vendors, and avoid walking alone in back streets at night.

The summer in Chongqing can be extremely sweltering. Heat stroke is very common in July and August. Stay cool and keep hydrated all the time!

Food

Local food can be tricky to most westerners, as they are often oily and spicy, not to mention the hygiene problems of some street food vendors. If you have a sensitive stomach, choose where to eat wisely or better avoid street food all together.
