Sanya (三亚 Sānyà) is on the southernmost point of , at the tip of island.

Understand
Billed as "China's Hawaii", Sanya has 20km long stretches of beach. As the only tropical city across the coastline, it is definitely booming and packed with a lot of water sports such as snorkeling and jet-skiing, rainforest hiking, and innumerable hotels ranging from zero to five stars.

With sunshine all year around, temperatures hover around 25*C even in January and 30*C in the summer time. Its islands and beaches are beautiful and the water in Yalong Bay and Dadonghai are clean enough to have a good swim, but you may also want to head to Wuzhizhou Island or further north to visit unspoiled and natural scenery. 

While tourists come in every season, the peak season starts from 1 October to the end of winter. During the winter, Sanya is a popular escape for Russians who primarily stay at Dadong Hai (大东海 Dàdōng hǎi) and Northern Chinese to escape freezing weather. In the Chinese New Year, the city will be flooded with tourists and expect everything to be extremely expensive.

As the southernmost city in China, Sanya along with often serves as the last stop for backpackers who wish to spend the remaining days of their visa in China.

Districts
* Sanya Bay Beach - stretches around 25 kilometers, but being a public beach it can get very crowded and dirty in particular during CNY and other peak seasons. It is lined with seafood restaurants and both local and international hotels.
* Sanya city - a rapidly evolving city, struggling to keep up with the pace of its development. The main streets can be an assault to the senses with scooters ignoring red lights, buses, cars and taxis beeping and pedestrians competing to get ahead. Locals seem unfazed by all the commotion and are warm and friendly if you make a little effort. You will see locals dancing along the beach in the evenings, and a range of people selling souvenirs, street food and fairground games. A must visit is the #1 Market, checkout the fresh local produce, kitchen/homewares, seafood and even pearl vendors. In the evening cross the Sanya River (三亚河 Sānyà hé) to reach a less touristy, cheaper, and fun part of town. Times Coast complex is lined with lively KTV lounges, bars and dance clubs.
* (大东海 Dàdōng hǎi) - Sanya visitors favorite meeting place, it has a good range of stand alone restaurants, cafés and bars. The bars along the beach are lively and cater for both Chinese and foreigners, particularly Russian tourists. Summer Mall, is the place to go for imported food products, but expect to pay higher prices. 
* (Banshanbandao) - Extensive residential and resort complex with several international hotels, a world-class yacht club Luihuito Golf Course, and the Sanya International School complex opened 2014, please note it is no longer affiliated with the Canadian International School 
* (亚龙湾 Yàlóng wān) - is a 7.5 kilometer stretch of beach, located 40 minutes from the airport and easily accessible on the high speed train, via Yalong Bay station. The area has been developed into a high end holiday destination with luxury resorts, golf courses, restaurants, and a new marina. The beach is well maintained and attracts high profile guests and residents. Definitely worth a visit, but be prepared for pay a premium compared to other parts of Sanya.
* (Hǎitáng Wān) - An up and coming development covering 42.8 kilometers of beach. This area has many international hotels slated to open in the next few years. It is 35 minutes away from Phoenix International airport by G98 Highway, and is home of the largest duty free shopping mall in China. Several luxurious resorts of note are already operating as well as a multiplex and show center.

Get in

By plane
Sanya has an airport with flights to most major Chinese cities such as , , , , and internationally , , , , , , , and . Fares vary significantly, as some flights are seasonal charter air routes. You may be able to get some flexibility by taking a bullet train to and flying out of the provincial capital's larger airport. The Meilan high-speed rail station is in the same building complex with Haikou's international airport. For intercity bus, ticket and overnight lodging can exceed the difference and you should account for travelling 3-4 hours each direction. In addition to the bus, you will easily be able to find "heiche" (黑车 hēichē) taxis that will take you between the two cities, for between 350 and 500 yuan per car. Although strictly illegal, you can find drivers that are courteous, safe and reliable, although this is much more difficult without being able to speak at least basic Chinese.
To get into Sanya city, take bus no 8 from the airport, which goes to Jiefang road and #1 market. Fare is 5 yuan, pay in cash directly to the conductor on the bus. There are several bus routes from the airport, check with your hotel for the right one.

By bus
The 3.5 hour bus ride from East Bus Station will cost about &yen;80(takes around 4 hours). Buses between Haikou and Sanya depart about every 30 minutes; the last bus from Sanya to Haikou departs around 11PM. Sanya's bus station is along Jie Fang Lu (解放路 jiěfàng lù), a few steps south (away from McDonalds) of the east end of "Shopping Street" (步行街 bùxíng jiē).

By train
Sanya can be reached directly by train from (35 hours), (36 hours) and (15 hours). The whole train is loaded on to a ferry for the journey from mainland China to the Island, then continues its journey around the west coast as far as Sanya. As trains leaving the island originate in Sanya, tickets from this smaller town are easier to obtain than if leaving from Haikou.

High-speed train connect all major cities and towns on the eastern coast. It takes 1.5 to 2 hours from Haikou, travels up to 250 km/h. There is a stop at Yalong Bay, Sanya, and Phoenix Airport. Be careful to check the service is stopping at your desired station, there are many express trains.

The new train station in Sanya is far from downtown, approximately as far as the airport. A taxi to Dadong Hai (大东海), the most popular tourist area) is approximately &yen;25-30. A public bus will cost &yen;1. Lines 2 and 4 lead through Sanya city proper and continue through (and past) Dadong Hai.

Get around
Many people stay in beach areas with more-or-less everything within walking distance. Darting in, around, and between Sanya city and Dadong Hai is best done by the city bus lines 2 (fastest) or 4 (adds some stops around Sanya River) for &yen;1. The buses run along Sanya city's Jiefang Road (解放路), which is the street McDonald's is on, and hit Dadong Bay at Luling Road (鹿岭路), just one stop past the Deer Turns Head Square (鹿回头广场).

Taxi fare starts from ¥8 for the first 2 kilometers, and ¥2 for each additional kilometer. Due to the cheap fare, taxi drivers like to hover around anywhere outside the downtown to avoid short-ride passengers. This makes getting a taxi in the downtown a bit difficult. Taxis are quite well regulated and they are mostly okay with using a meter, but drivers are mainly immigrant workers who may not be familiar with every place. Some of them also try to fool tourists that the place they want to go is closed, and try to take you farther. Another problem is that since Sanya is only crowded during winter, there are enough taxis to go around. And the government doesn't hire more taxis because during the summer, there would be too many taxis and the drivers would not make any money. To help with this problem, the government has commissioned another class of yellow taxis that can hailed by phone. Dial 96789 tell them your location and they will pick you up if there is a car nearby you and the rates are the same as regular taxis. During peak season they might add ¥5 to your fare. 

There are also numerous motorcycle and sidecar taxis. You must negotiate the price before leaving. Prices are slightly lower then regulated taxis but it depends on your negotiating skills and knowing what the locals pay for the same trip distance.

For trips farther out of town, you can buy bus tickets at Sanya city's bus station or just hail buses on the road that runs along Sanya's beach. Tickets to most destinations will be &yen;1-30. You could also hire a van with (or without) an English speaking guide from hotels or people with white and blue displays on the streets of Sanya City or Dadong Bay. If choosing to go with a Chinese tour group, beware that there may likely be several hours of scheduled stops at "infomercial" centers, complete with microphone delivered advertisements.

You can also rent an electric motorbike or a car of your own. There are several places to do this, One service provider is called TAILG, address is around #130 on Jiefang St. Prices: for an electric bike &yen;50 per day (&yen;1800 refundable deposit, no driving license needed); for a car prices vary depending on the model. Petrol motorbikes are almost impossible to rent in Sanya. However, any driver who is not familiar with the traffic norms in Sanya should think twice about renting a motorbike. Traffic rules are practiced half-heartedly and road condition can be dangerous even if you are a good disciplined driver. When you crash into a pedestrian, you as a driver are likely the one to pay the compensation. Also electric motorbikes may need frequent recharging if the battery is in poor condition.

When renting a car or petrol motorcycle, you need a valid chinese driving licence (International Licenses are not valid). There is no exemption to this rule and you can be jailed for up to 15 days by driving without a license. In most cases, you will be fine without it, but in the event of an accident, this will be a major issue. If renting an electric motorbike, no driving license is required.

See
* Dadong Sea has Sanya's best balance between development and natural beauty. The town behind Dadong Bay is more expensive than Sanya, but has better restaurants and a gorgeous beach. The shopping, however, is not as good as Sanya city's. The ocean has algae blooms that vary the water from thick green to tropically clear. However, even when "tropically clear" the ocean bed is just sand with a rare school of fish or eel. See the beach both in the morning, at sunset (sets gorgeously over the hills), and at night (when people are very scarce). Check out the trails that lead between tide pools along the Westernmost rocks of the beach. The tip of the trail has a dramatic view of the ocean and a deep and deadly ocean cave. Several locations and service providers have signage in Russian.

* The only non-profit organization promoting sea turtle conservation in China, Sea Turtles 911's primary facility is a floating sea turtle hospital in Xincun, Lingshui beside Nanwan Monkey Island, as well as programs in Sanya and Haikou. While on Hainan Island visitors are welcome to volunteer with the sea turtles and the organization's educational programs. Recommended donation. Go to www.seaturtles911.org for more information. As of October, 2014, the Sea Turtles 911 website's contact form seems to be down to a website error, and there are no sea turtles at the turtle hospital. It's not known if the program is still functioning.

* From Sanya, take the Lingshui (陵水 Língshuǐ) bound bus from the bus station (19 CNY, about 2 hrs). In Lingshui, exit the bus station and walk across the street. Take the right side of this street and walk until you get to the bus stop beside the hospital. Wait for the 新村 Xīncūn bus (5 CNY, about 30 mins) and ride it to the end of the line. Once you get off the bus in Xincun, ignore the people trying to sell you rides to Monkey Island. Simply walk straight down the road and turn left at the end. The park entrance will be about 50 meters on the right. UPDATED (2015/06/02): Take one of the D-class trains departing from Sanya Railway Station to LingShui (25mins). Cost is CNY18.5 for a 2nd class seat, CNY23.5 for first class. Take a taxi from LingShui station to the ticketing center (they will know where it is). Takes about 20-30 mins and should cost around 50RMB. UPDATED (10/2015): New price for Monkey Island is about &yen;150, now (which includes the required gondola ride into the park). In our opinion, it's not worth the trip (too expensive; not worth the day's effort; not enough to do or see on the "island"). There are a few monkeys around to see, but the "monkey circus" is a disgusting display of animal cruelty. They whip and are violent with the animals (monkeys, pony, bear, etc), forcing them to do the same repetitive show over and over all day. Animal slaves. Anyway, the last bus from Lingshui to Sanya in 18 20; the last train is much later (maybe around 2100hrs).

* Purposefully-constructed tourist trap began in 1998 with a gigantic statue of Guanyin (a Goddess of Mercy) on a sea-top platform. The park has few interesting spots (save a monastery bells that you can "gong") but demands a hefty entrance fee over &yen;150. A trolley car can shuttle you around the park for extra cash, but it is best enjoyed without the trolley as it really is not that big. Nanshan is about an hour outside of Sanya city by city bus, which can be grabbed at the bus station or along the city's beach-side roadway (三亚弯路). The surrounding countryside is much more interesting than the park itself, which is a must-miss.

* Gorgeous, remote, and brimming with tropical life, one of this chain of islands was formerly on exotic vacation spot that is now off-limits to travelers, reportedly due to territorial disputes.

* A popular spot for snorkeling and scuba diving, this island has fallen victim to it is popularity. Water is less clear and fish less plentiful than before, so choose dates and times to maximize visibility when visiting. Scuba diving will cost around &yen;400-500. Snorkeling is strictly regulated, only allowed in designated areas, and only with snorkel companies. Swimming is also confined to a small, roped-off section of the island. Swimming in 99% of the island is strictly forbidden. Signs and patrolling guards will ensure compliance. Take bus 28 from Sanya (12 yuan) to the end of the line, then walk forward 200 meters to the parking lot entrace to your left to buy boat tickets (168 yuan). 

* This stretch of beach is rather undeveloped and thus delightfully peaceful (it will probably be only you for a good kilometer on either side). Visiting here is a delightful and mind-cleaning day trip, especially if joined with some hiking around the surrounding farms. Watch out for strong rip tides and pack snacks.

* Hainan is home to a large population of ethnic minorities, predominantly the Li (黎) and Miao (苗) Ethnic Groups, and you can find out more about them at this park, about 30km outside of Sanya. The park is very commercial with a large number of shops, snacks for sale and (paid) opportunities for photographs with locals in traditional costumes or with indigenous animals. Despite this, it appears that there has been a genuine attempt to show the traditional life and customs of the two minorities, and the park appears less tacky than some other similar attractions elsewhere in China. It is probably also a relatively good way for money to be returned to the local community. There is a steep entrance fee (approximately &yen;150 per person) but the park is huge and there are a wide variety of shows; it will take you 3-4 hours to see in its entirety. Be prepared though to fight your way through Chinese tour groups shouting "Blong" as often as they can, the Miao word for hello, and try to eat before you leave as the restaurants outside the park are overpriced. Rental of a taxi from Sanya and backshould cost approximately &yen;200 including the wait in between, but you should negotiate this with the driver before departing. There are also one-day tours on offer in all the hotels, which will offer a discount on the overall price of transportation and entrance tickets, but you will be constrained to the timing of the rest of the group and may have several commercial stops on the journey there and back as well as within the park. The park has excellent signposting in English.

*Yanoda, meaning 123 in Hainanese, is a newly developed rainforest park, well organized and nicely landscaped. An inner bus (add ¥40) takes groups to the start point which also has a great view of Chitian reservoir. Wooden paths then take you on a 40 minute hike up a forest valley, past 1000 year old trees that have grown around rocks, with optional light absailing and rope river crossing. At the top, you enter a landscaped lakeside park with lotuses, colorful flowers and a canteen offering a nourishing herbal buffet (mostly for tour groups). The path continues up into the hills, past labelled jungle trees with huge palms overhead. This park is fairly good value, and in keeping with its subject matter, reasonably natural. At least you know the developers couldn't have maneuvered the hefty trees into place, even for the reputed price of ¥3 billion that the park cost to civilize. Poor signposting in English, especially for the flora and fauna.
* There is nothing to see but a few rocks in the sea with Chinese characters. The beach itself is not really beautiful, but famously alluded to by various ancient Chinese writers. 
* It is located on the cliff in the southeast of the island. Standing on the rock, you can get a bird's view of the whole island and the South China Sea. The Guanri Rock is like a natural stone Buddha facing to the sea. It is also like a huge turtle crawling to the vast ocean. The rock is an ideal place for you to enjoy the sunrise. 
*This is one of the tourist attractions in Sanya. On top of one of the tallest mountains in Sanya stands a statue of a deer looking back, flanked by a Li boy and a Li Girl. The legend goes that the boy was hunting the deer until the deer approaches a cliff, looks back, and magically turns into a beautiful girl and they fall in love. This place symbolizes young couples falling in love. At night you will see green lasers shooting out from near the statue that is visible from all over Sanya. Beneath the statue is an outdoor barbecue seating area that closes at 11:30pm. You will see wild monkeys that take food from humans as well. On the back of your ticket, you will see a map of the park so you can guide yourself. There is an abandoned roller coast up here as well. You will see the rusting tracks and closed off entrance area. There is also a wall with chains on it where you can buy a padlock with your names written on it and have your padlocked locked to the chain to symbolize that your love is forever. Or until the lock breaks. In 2019, 90RMB for one adult and one child for entry and optional shuttle. Shuttle is very frequent and in the heat, a bargain

Do 
Air Tour
Charter a private air tour of Hainan.

Biking
Sanya is a popular destination for pro-amateur bikers who are eager to hover around the whole island. However, almost all bikers take their own bike. Bike rental service is not as omnipresent as other touristy places such as or . Most bike shops are located at Sanya Hexi Lu (Sanya River East Road), you need to pay Y1000 for deposit and prices start from Y40 for 1 day hiring. Several hostels also have a bike rental service. A route from Dadonghai to Yalong bay, then to Haitong Bay has a well-constructed, -lit and smooth road which stretches over 30KM and make it ideal to ride. However, the urban area of Sanya has some of the worst traffic in China and the local police are notorious for being impotent on cracking down traffic violations.

Cruising
* They operates year round cruises travelling to and .

Golfing
Sanya is home to numerous world class golf courses, suitable for beginners and several demanding golf courses for more experienced players. International tournaments are regularly hosted in Sanya golfing venues.

Hiking
In Sanya, you may more likely do more walking than hiking. With its pretty flat landscape and well-developed roads, hiking is not particular popular among tourists. Hikers often take a bus in the Sanya Bus Station at Jiefang Road and head to (五指山）to start their hiking tour. The 90-minute bus is available every hour from 7:00 to 16:00 and fare is around Y16.

Spa
Ease in to island life with a spa treatment at one of the many award winning venues in Sanya. Please note visiting a spa, like most things in Sanya, is not for the budget conscious. You are looking at a starting price of 400RMB for a basic massage, but with the beautiful settings and well trained therapists you don't want to miss out on indulging at least once. Some visitors book treatments before hotel checkin if they arrive on an early flight before their room becomes available or after the check out to give them a relaxing way to kill time before heading back home, this is by far the best option as there isn't much to do at the airport. You must book in advance, walkins are not very common. 
* Highly recommended for those who want to try TCM in a luxury resort setting, they offer: Chinese doctor consultation, acupuncture, cupping, moxibustion, scrubs, wraps and massages. If you stick to the traditional treatments, the spa uses aromatherapy associates as their product.
* This beautiful spa was designed by the famous Bensley Design Studios and you will feel like you've stepped into a Thai fairytale. Even if you are not staying in Yalong Bay, a treatment here is worth the trip.

Surfing
Hainan is China's only destination with consistent, year round surf. In the summer, the south winds bring waves to Sanya's south-facing beaches. In the fall through winter, the peak surf season, Hainan's east coast is the place to go. Hainan does not offer world-class waves, but it offers fairly consistent tropical surf, which is almost completely empty. If you are new to surfing, there are a number of companies to contact.

* Insight Adventures are the largest operator in Hainan and offer surf lessons and rentals, as well as many other outdoor activities such as kayaking, biking, snorkelling and stand up paddle boards. Insight offer safety certified instructors, first aid equipment, sun-protection utilities and English or Chinese guides. Email info@insight-adventures.com

Study Mandarin
With such a beautiful environment, relaxing on the beach and studying Mandarin Chinese is a fun and productive activity for those with more time. It's also easier to focus on the studying without the distractions of the big cities.

Water Sports
Yalong Bay, Dadong Bay, Haitang Bay and Sanya Bay all have a collection of jet skiing, parasailing, paragliding, snorkeling, scuba diving, glass-bottomed boat, and beach ATV enterprises. Prices aren't generally very negotiable (save for scuba and snorkeling), but duration of the ride, however, can. Do not go too cheap on scuba, for obvious safety reasons. the only certified PADI is located at the Serenity Coast marina.

Buy
The area produces pearls in abundance and they are sold everywhere.
Prices are highly negotiable; overcharging tourists is common.
Tour guides get a fat (often 50%!) commission for bringing tourists
to pearl shops; try to go without one and beat the price down.

Coconut powders and teas are also popular Chinese buys, but for Westerners looking for something less commercially produced... the cone-shaped hats that women wear here with pictures inscribed are only 5 RMB at The First Market (第一市场 dìyī shìchǎng) in Sanya city. Lines 2 and 4 have a stop there. Don't head into the department store; instead, stick to the side of it and walk down the road filled with small shops and street vendors.

*The government set up a duty free shopping center for luxury goods in Sanya. Here you can buy all the Gucci, LV, etc. to your hearts content. You need proof of a plane ticket leaving Hainan and you must pick up your goods at the airport when you leave. Please note there is an 8,000 yuan per customer spending limit

Eat

Restaurants
 
There are plenty of good restaurants, including many Sichuan places and some Cantonese. There are two McDonald's (Pineapple Mall Dadonghai & on pedestrian street at Jiefang Erlu) Several Burger Kings (JieFang Lu, La Floret Yalong Bay, Domestic Airport Sanya) and four branches of KFC (105 Jiefang Lu; Duojialian; 63 Guoxing Dadao; Renmin Lu). Seafood is a beach city's speciality. Inspect the tanks for freshness before eating and beware of the different charges that are often handled by different people at the restaurant (fishery, cooking fee, and sitting fee can be separate). Shellfish go for &yen;10-25 per jin (half kilo).
 
*Authentic Italian
*The Continental Restaurant serves a wide variety of food at very reasonable prices. Soups, salads, western food, chinese food, the variety and decor make this a nice dining experience.
*Great atmosphere, dishes are between 20-100RMB. Within walking distance of Bar street on Yuya Lu
*Casual Noodle Bar
*This is not a restaurant, but a live seafood supermarket, and it's worth mentioning because of its popularity. You buy seafood here, take it across the street around the corner and all the restaurants will cook the food for you. They have seafood, poultry, lamb, pork - almost anything you can think of besides beef. As you are shopping for food, you will get approached by touts that give you a business card with their price list for cooking your food for you. If you agree, after you finish buying, they will take you to their restaurant around the corner and prepare the food for you. If you want to eat seafood but don't want to pay the outrageous prices at seafood restaurants, this is a great option.
*Cantonese style cuisine & daily Dim Sum
*Popular place for late night barbecue and beer. Not as big as Shangping Road, but a good alternative if you get sick of shangping road.

Specialities
Hainan is famous for Wenchang chicken or Haianese Chicken Rice, only chickens raised in Hainan province can genuinely be called as such. The accruements are usually: ginger, vinegar, soy sauce all served along a small portion of rice and chicken broth.
Hainan grows a great variety of tropical fruits. Mango, betel nut, pineapples, durian, jackfruit, mangosteen, lycee are very popular. Hainan is famous throughout China for its coconuts and they are worth trying, especially the red coconuts (红椰 hóng yē). Away from the beach, expect to pay about &yen;4-5 for a coconut. Prices increase as you get closer and you may end up paying about &yen;15 for a coconut on the beach. Note that fruit price is fluctuating and cheating on its weight is common. Visit any big and well-established chain supermarkets such as Wan Hao or Nan Guo in the downtown of Sanya along Jiefang Road to check the current market price. 

Street food
A bit after sunset and well in to the midnight, Sanya city's streets are filled with small barbecue stands, noodle stands, and other snack vendors. There is a well-known seafood supermarket called The No. 1 Agricultural Products Market(第一市场)(See address below). You buy live seafood and then take it around the corner to a crowded street where all the restaurants will cook (Jia Gong,加工) the seafood for you for a small fee per dish. It's the most crowded night market in Sanya. You will find a constant assortment of musicians and kids that sell flowers to proposition you while you are eating. It's a great way to save money on eating seafood because there is no markup for the seafood because you purchased the seafood yourself. It's quite a lively environment with guitarists playing, saxophonists playing, customers singing, beer flowing all night long, garbage trucks to come by to pick up the garbage, and the occasional fight. This street starts dying down around the midnight and the crowds head to bar street.

After Bar Street closes, the crowds head to the night food market located at the 1st Lane of Shangping Road (商品街一巷) which is close to Jiefang Road (解放路). Most foods are at the fixed price but try to negotiate a bit for the seafood barbecue. The food and beer flows until the sun comes up.

Another popular after-hours barbecue place is at Wan Jun Long. Not as popular as Shangping Road, but somewhere different.

Night markets in Dadonghai are less impressive, but local people likely head to Xia Yang Tian(下洋田) for some quick and simple food which is usually cheap.

Drink
Coffee The vast majority of coffee shops here open around 10 or 11AM. 

* 
* The restaurant delivers to customers within a 5 mile radius of Dadonghai Beach. English is spoken.

Alcohol - Times Coast Bar Street 

This is where all the hottest clubs in Sanya are, it's one big circle with about 10-11 clubs. The big three first tier clubs with all the tourists are Soho, MJ, and 88. The rest of the clubs are second tier clubs that have mostly locals and are less expensive. To get here, hop in a cab and say "Jiu Ba Jie". The most popular local brew is Anchor (actually Singaporean but produced in Hainan). Ask for the 'red label' or 'old' brew, which is the original. It is very hoppy and can be a great escape from Yanjing (燕京) or Qingdao (青岛) beer. Those are available, of course, as well. There are also local pineapple-based beers. Odd, but worth a try. Red coconuts (红椰) are especially sweet, even if you just pop a straw straight into the coconut!

*second tier club, but full of people always. mostly locals.
*They have their own brewery with German beer. You can see all the big canisters and pipes where the beer is brewed and served to you. There's outdoor and indoor seating. Indoor seating has a live band from the Philippines. If you come here on Wednesdays, all the beer is half price.
*A really upscale restauraut with excellent service with authentic Italian dishes. Prices are fair, the presentation is good as is the taste, as is the quality of food. Clean and well run. Recommended for western foods that will delight the palate. All wines and beer served. English speaking staff. Italian owner who is the Maitre D aided by his Chinese wife. 
*This is the foreigner hangout in Sanya. Live band and western food. You will find mostly Russians sitting outside and a mix of people sitting inside. More description of this bar in the restaurant section.
*Second tier club on the ground level around the corner from Allen Story
*This is a KTV Hostess club. You have to get a room that has a minimum charge of more than ¥1000. Then you pay for girls to drink with you. The girls charge ¥500 tip. 
*They have a big lounge area, but this bar is a "high" bar, most people come here to go to the private KTV rooms on the second floor to do their preferred drug of choice.
*
*They have both and indoors and outdoors section. The outdoors section is more popular. They have a pool table and a live band. Indoors, they have a foosball table. The burgers here are pretty good. Manager's email address herufeng851005@163.com
*They have two floors. On the second floor you can sing karaoke where all the customers can hear and see you - not a common thing in China. They also sell Pizza. This is a relatively new bar and they don't have a lot of customers yet. They do have one problem though - because residents live upstairs, they have to turn down the music after 11pm.
*Really ghetto KTV and lounge where the locals hang out. Sound system is not good either. But if you want to hang out with locals, this is it.

Sleep
Budget
In Sanya city and Dadonghai there are many small, clean moderately priced inns and hotels (&yen;50-100, even in high season, for 1-3 beds). Some may be located in alley ways just off Sanya's beach street, sometimes several floors up without an elevator (but the view is worth it!).

* This hostel has been sold to new owners and is currently open again for guests. It's located on a private back street/alley and has it's own outdoor bar with pooltable. The hostel is incredibly clean - perhaps too clean. The rooms lack character (look more like hospital wards). The bar closes at 11:30, but it's really a nice vibe. Good place overall.
* Small and quiet hostel about 10 minutes walk from Dadonghai beach. Clean, friendly and dorms far cheaper than anywhere in Dadonghai proper. There is no temple here, the name comes from its affiliation with Beijing's Lama Temple hostel.

Stay safe
As a newly developed tourist destination, Sanya exists solely for tourism which is accompanied by annoyances including pickpocketing and overcharging.

Before arrival, travelers should be wary of getting the right address and most up to date telephone number for their hostels/hotels. Some hostels are located in a new district whose roads have just been laid out. Not many people, including the police, know where specific locations are in new districts. When you get lost, always ask drivers to call the staff. 

Para-sailing, diving, snorkeling and boating are popular but operators may not be trained or certified. If you go for diving, always check air tank pressures before. Some Wikitravelers have reported that they received half-empty scuba tanks and found it difficult to inhale smoothly. 

Sanya has a lot of local tour packages. Some tours to outlying islands may look cheap, but once you arrive on the spot, operators may charge you extra money for using their equipment. Masks, snorkels and fishing rods can be shabby and expensive to rent. Other tours are shopping traps, complete with ridiculous commissions for the tour guide. Before you join any tour, ask specifically what is included in the fee (beach chair, drinks, boat, fishing rod, snorkel, mask, transportation, admission fees, return transportation, etc), and what is not (shopping).

Thanks to a heavy crackdown on gangsters, Sanya has become much safer than in the early 2000s. While violent crimes against tourists are rare in Sanya, be wary of pickpocketing, bicycle theft and bag snatching. There are occasional reports of professional drivers zooming alongside a tourist and grabbing their bag. Pickpocketing is common on buses. You should avoid bringing any valuables to the beach as theft is occasionally reported. Note that lockers on the beach, along their showers and beach chairs, are NOT free. They will charge Y20 to Y50, or more, per use.

Sanya is also notorious for overcharging. Scams in seafood restaurants were heavily reported in the Chinese media in 2011. To avoid very unpleasant sticker shock, make sure you know the price of what you are ordering. 

That being said, as a tourist area, everything sold close to the beach will be 30%-100% more expensive than in downtown Sanya due to high rents and the law of supply and demand (lots of tourists, limited prime real estate for restaurants). Furthermore, market prices anywhere in Sanya are slightly higher than Haikou due to the cost of transportation. For seafood lovers who just traveled from inexpensive Haikou, do not expect to pay Y10 for 4 scallops or 6 oysters. 

Traffic rules apparently do not exist. Cars and motorcycles drive on both sides of the road and careen down sidewalks as if they had right of way. Irritating honking is ever-present, even when driving on sidewalks. Tourists should NOT trust the green traffic light and zebra crossings, because changing lights sometimes encourage drivers to speed up. As elsewhere, do not trust drivers to avoid you; you should always avoid them.

Cars will only stop at red lights. Bikes will only stop at red traffic lights if they are managed by police, otherwise you will watch them zip and weave though all directions of oncoming traffic. 

The road dividers on main arterial roads are not there to stop people from running across; they are in place to stop cars from going down the wrong side of the road. Watch a road without these installed and you will see this in practice. 

The tap water, even in nice hotels, should not be considered safe to drink as the tap water in Sanya is generally not potable. Bring or buy bottled water if you plan to be outside of your accommodations for long periods of time. If you have access to a kettle in your hotel room or rented apartment, boiled water is fine to drink.

Hainan is considered an active and region. Note that while there are pills to prevent malaria, there is no way to grow antibodies against dengue fever. If you plan to visit tropical forest zones, bring your own strong mosquito repellent and coil incense.

Get Out
While most tourists visit Hainan for the increasingly vibrant city of Sanya, the island is large and has many other more remote locations to see. The eastern coast, between Sanya and Haikou is home to Shimei Bay (石梅湾 shí méi wān) and Riyuewan (日月湾 rìyuè wān), the former which hosts the large and very secluded-feeling Le Meridien, and the latter which has become a popular spot for surfers on a budget. The cheaper hotel is Y480 a night, so not super budget. Take the slow (non-express) bus to Haikou from the bus station and ask to be dropped off at the respective highway turnoff (Y30, 90min, pay on the bus). Make sure you show them your ticket first or they will take you to another town where a taxi ride back 5 KM they charge Y100. To get back, walk up to the highway and flag down a bus. Note that express buses won't stop to pick you up. A taxi to either location will cost around Y300.
