Understand

Amarillo offers a true Western heritage, a unique geographical area with wide open spaces and breathtaking sunrises and sunsets. Amarillo is also gateway to , America's second largest canyon. With its relatively mild climate, the city is rated as having some of the cleanest air in the country.
Indians, conquistadors, buffalo hunters, settlers, cowboys, adventurers, lawmen, gunfighters, and the railroad all contributed in many ways to the development and growth of the area. That heritage is still felt here, where "cowboy" is still an honorable profession. Here you can enjoy the very best of the Old and New West!
Founded in 1887, the city charter was adopted in 1913. Amarillo is one of the first cities in the nation to use the City Commissioner-City Manager form of government. Now home to close to 200,000 residents (more than 300,000 in the metro area), the city features excellent accommodations, a spacious convention/civic center, symphony, ballet, little theater, opera, and is the home of Amarillo College.

Though technically located on the very northern tip of the , Amarillo has closer ties with the region, serving as the economic, industrial, transportation, and cultural hub of the region.

Climate

}}
Amarillo is at a high elevation (3,605 ft) and has mostly a flat topography, with exception of the Canadian River valley to the north, and Palo Duro Canyon, to the south/southeast. This comes with bright sunshiny days when sunny, and an almost continuously windy condition year-round. Average winds range from 12 miles per hour in August to 15.5 miles per hour in March, but can be much stronger, with or without storms or fronts coming through. While wind can blow from any direction, the prevailing winds in the area come from the southwest. The air is usually dry, especially in winter, so it's a good idea to have lip balm and skin lotion/cream handy when in the area.

Water quality
While the water from faucets is generally clear, the water that comes from city pipes in Amarillo has an unpleasant taste. It is good idea to drink mainly filtered or bottled water when in the area.

Stay safe
As with any area, it is good to be aware of your surroundings. Although the Route 66 path through Amarillo is a draw for visitors, part of its path through town included Amarillo Boulevard. In the decades since I-40 bypassed it, the part of Amarillo Blvd. from the center of town to the east has not been the safest area to dwell in at night. Be aware there during the day, but other parts of town are better at night.
 
LGBT people face attitudes that are hostile here. The Panhandle takes a conservative stance on homosexuality and is not LGBT friendly. Public displays of affection are frowned upon. Violence happen towards LGBT and police turn a blind eye to violence towards the amount of LGBT, join in, or are complicit. Also businesses are not LGBT friendly you will be refused service. LGBT should stay out of Amarillo and the Panhandle.

Another thing to be aware of in the Amarillo area are certain insects and critters; specifics to watch for in the city and surroundings include tarantulas, brown recluse spiders, stinging scorpions, and rattlesnakes. For those who will be in or through Amarillo in wintertime, make sure you have adequate winter clothing, as it can get cold and snowy then, with potentially bitterly cold wind chill values. If driving, you may need additional items such as tire chains/cables or cat litter for adequate traction in inclement weather. The wind in the Amarillo area can get gusty at times throughout the year, which can lead to stiff crosswinds felt while driving, especially if you are on a bridge or overpass, so make sure you are attentive to your steering during those times.
