The entrance fee is ¥20 for adults, ¥10 for students (including foreign students) and free for children under 120cm. Qingxiu Shan is not really a mountain, despite its name.

About:
ShiShan (Lion Hill) Park was founded in 1962 around the Yong Wu forest plantation. Lion Hill Park was once called ZhiQing Bamboo Park but officially opened to the public as Lion Hill Park in 1995. The park encompasses 64.5 square kilometers to the northeast of Nanning city and includes a wedge of water measuring 6.5 square kilometers. It is famous for the natural greenery, architecture and fresh air inside the park. Each year millions of visitors come to Lion Hill Park to walk along the tree and bamboo-shaded walkways and enjoy the marvellous views.

With over 30 different buildings representing South-China's architecture, ShiShan Park focuses on displaying South-China's garden architecture and bamboo art. The park is divided into six regions for tourist attractons as Hydrophilic activity area, Entertainment area, Natural Grass Area, Nature Interpretation Area, Pine-Bamboo Resting Area, Bamboo Shaded Entertainment Area.

Do

Learn
Though older people and some young people mostly speak Baihua (白话 báihuà) which is similar to Cantonese (广东话 guǎngdōnghuà), the younger generation mainly speak Nanpu (南普 nánpǔ) which basically the same as Mandarin (普通话 pǔtōnghuà), but with different tones and vocabularies. Nanning is regarded as one of the most successful cities in China in terms of popularizing Mandarin or 'common language'. So it is a very good place to learn Putonghua for foreigners. Universities offering Chinese courses are many, including Guangxi University for Nationalities and Guangxi University. However, be aware that Nanning people, like virtually all Chinese in the south, have a non-standard pronunciation for many of the basic sounds of Mandarin (which comes from the northern Han people).

Note also that Nanning, as the capital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, embraces the Zhuang ethnic language, and virtually all public building signs in Guangxi display the Zhuang written text alongside Chinese. It is not to be confused with pinyin, the standard romanization of Mandarin.

Work
As a regional capital, Nanning has a lot of work opportunities compared to other cities of Guangxi Province. The booming import and export business exchanges between Guangxi and Vietnam means that there is a big demand for people who can speak both Chinese and Vietnamese. Also, if you are a native English speaker, teaching jobs are also abundant. However,if you do plan on teaching, be aware that government regulations have tightened considerably, post-Olympics, and to gain employment you must be under 60, have two years teaching experience; have a minimum Bachelors degree, and preferably, additionally, ESL/EFL certification. Although, with the demand for teachers far outstripping supply, those who don't meet these qualifications can still find teaching work (just without the comfort/legality of a working Visa).

Buy
*The main shopping street lined with department stores, like Nanning Department Store, and Walmart, in addition other intentional brands and local brands. It is also a nice place to go people-watching, as people from all walks of life can be seen here: youngsters, street performers, roadside vendors, etc.

MixC There is a new shopping mall in the modern eastern part Langdong. You can buy imported products ranging from German beer to Feta cheese.

Eat 
Zhongshan Rd (中山路) is Nanning's food street, with a vast assortment of street stalls serving many kinds of Liang Guang (literally, the two Guang provinces, Guangxi and Guangdong) foods, as well as food from neighbouring provinces, such as Hunan and Yunnan. It is diagonally opposite the Wanda Plaza, home of Wal-Mart. Throughout the city there are many good-value restaurants. Few have English menus. The newly developed eastern end of the city (around Langdong, and the APEC Exhibition Centre) has lots of up-market restaurants, cafes and coffee lounges.

Budget 
There are dumpling stalls and small eating houses all over the city. Fresh, tasty and very cheap. Zhongshan Rd food stalls are also worth a try. Try the local rice noodle soup, laoyoufen (老友粉; literally old friend rice noodle). It is traditionally made with pork based broth, pickled bamboo shoots, fermented soy beans, and other typical Chinese spices. It is an acquired tasted due to the pickled bamboo shoots.

*This is a 300 meter long stretch where you will find a vivid display of various exotic dishes ready to be served.

* Huoju Lu, Nongyuan Lu (火炬路,农园路) A night market popular with students lies in the Northwestern part of the city, next to the university. There are many snack and shopping opportunities. You can stay late eating BBQ and drinking beer outside here. There are a few bars, too (see 'Drink').

Mid-range 
About 90% of the restaurants in Nanning would fall into this category.

* They advertise their wood oven pizzas, which are pretty good. The best one is probably Salami. For 10 Yuan extra they'll give you a lot of cheese. They also serve other Western dishes and wine. It's a comfortable place. They have delivery service for the university area but of course you need to speak Chinese.

* They have good burgers, sandwiches and salad.

* Chain serving traditional hotpot, with lamb the meat of choice.

* Sichuan hot, spicy food.

* National chain serving Hunan spicy food.

* German owned restaurant serving Chinese and German dishes (different sausages, potato salad and more).

Splurge
Anything in/around Langdong or the Five Elephant Plaza (financial district); the YongJiang Hotel, by the river, has an excellent buffet, with fresh seafood, and good quality meat BBQs.
The MixC shopping Mall in Langdong is now the fashionable place to go. There are buffets and international food.

Drink

Many popular bars are to be found along Minzu Da Dao (民族大道), the long avenue that runs from east to west through the city, bisecting South Lake. Many have a cover charge, and offer a variety of international as well as domestic beers, in addition to the standard supply of liquors. 

Bar Street A popular bar and club street crossing Minzu DaDao is Xinghu Lu BeiYiLi (星湖路北一里). 

South Lake (Nan Hu 南湖) More upper class clubs can be found here.

Sunshine 100 (阳光 100) bar area (near the city library) has a cluster of up-market bars and coffee lounges, many featuring live music. 

XK Bar A British owned bar called XK Bar lies in a dark back street near the crossroad of Minzu Dadao and Yuanhu Lu (民族大道园湖路口) in the first West branch of YuanHu Lu (园湖路西一里).

The Queen's Head (英格兰酒吧 YingGeLan JiuBa) owned by two foreigners in JiangBei DaDao 22 near 303 hospital. (江北大道22号三0三医院旁)

A number of more intimate, low key bars and pubs can be found in the university district in the north west of the city, around University Road (Da Xue Lu) and Mingxiu Road. 

Such as Deep Blue Bar (深蓝酒吧 ShenLan JiuBa) in Huoju 1st Branch Road (火炬一支路).

Sleep

Unfortunately there is no restaurant in the hotel so you have to eat out or buy some food and bring to your room. Free Wi-Fi in the lobby. There are four GreenTree Inn Nanning so check the address and not rely blindly on the Map apps and such. On both side of the road outside the hotel there are bus stops. To get to the center, select the bus number 9 on the opposite side of the road from the hotel seen, the journey takes about 10-15 minutes and costs 元 1.

Stay safe
Chinese cities are generally speaking very safe and Nanning is no exception. But petty robberies are quite common. On buses, be extra-careful about your mobile phones and wallets.

Don't swap your phone or buy iPhone 4 offered for sale for 2000 Yuan by men from Tajikistan around the train station. On the street they offer you to inspect a real (non Chinese copy) working iPhone 4 with a SIM card in it. If you decide to buy it they probably take your money and the iPhone 4 to take the SIM card out. Thereafter you most likely will get a working Chinese iPhone which is far from the real one.

Cope
