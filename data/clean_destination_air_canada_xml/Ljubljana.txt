Ljubljana has no world-famous attractions, which is just great: there's no need to hop from one place to another, taking photos and crossing the items on your checklist. You have all the time to stroll around and enjoy the city itself.

In the summer, its center hosts a number of city sponsored events, from children workshops and public playgrounds on the streets that get closed for traffic for the occasion, to Trnfest's off-beat street performances and musical events of all genres. In autumn it shows its academic face as it fills again by students of the state's largest university to whom the city owes much of its youthful character. Cold December days are warmed by thousand of lights, the new year's decoration conceived by local artists, and by food and drinks sold from street stands on the banks of Ljubljanica river. After surviving the boring gray remaining of winter, the city erupts again with spring flowers planted on its streets and crossroads.
 
Understand

Get in

By plane
Ljubljana Jože Pučnik Airport (IATA: LJU) is located 30 km from the city centre of Ljubljana and it is the largest Slovenian airport.

EasyJet is connecting Ljubljana with Gatwick (LGW), Stansted (STN), Tegel (TXL) and Schönefeld (SXF), Turkish Airlines with (IST),WizzAir with Luton (LTN) and Charleroi (CRL), LOT Polish Airlines with (WAW), Transavia with (AMS), AirSerbia with (BEG), Finnair with (HEL), Aeroflot with (SVO), Air France with (CDG) and Montenegro Airlines with (TGD). Arkia Israeli Airlines, Israir Airlines and El Al Israel Airlines are all connecting Ljubljana with Ben Gurion International Airport (TLV).

What LJU does have: free WiFi (Airport Public), bars with coffee, tea, alcohol, local beverages and several food options such as sandwiches and desserts (departures area: one before security check, one after; arrivals area: one in the waiting hall; the visitors terrace is closed due to renovations of the airport), restaurant (departures area: one before security check; no fast food options), shops with souvenirs (departures area: two before security check, duty free after), exchange office (departures area: post office – only open Mo-Fr 8:00 a.m-10:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m.-5:00 p.m.), VAT Tax Refund (departures area: souvenir shop), Tourist-information counter (arrivals area: offering large selection of free promotional material that covers whole Slovenia and free maps of major cities; selling Ljubljana Tourist Card – if you buy it online with 10 % discount, you can just pick it up there; they do not book accommodations, transfers or tours; open till the last flight).

What LJU doesn’t have: storage lockers (you can save your luggage at Ljubljana Train Station for 3,00-6,00 € a day), train connection to Ljubljana, hotel.

Traveling between the airport and the city center: 
* Buses run every hour on the hour between 5 a.m. and 8 p.m. during the week and every two hours on the hour between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. during weekends and holidays. Tickets that cost 4,10 € can be bought directly at the driver. Free rides are included in Ljubljana Tourist Card but only for buses at 8 a.m., 10 a.m., 12 a.m., 2 p.m., 4 p.m., 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. during the week. The journey to the city center takes 50 minutes.
* Shuttles are offered by two companies: GoOpti and Nomago. The ticket that cost 10 € can be bought at their desks at the arrivals area waiting hall. Reservation is only required for destinations other than Ljubljana. The journey to the city center takes 30-45 minutes (depends on the traffic).
* Taxis usually charge around 50 € for the ride to the city center. You can book them upfront online and it will be cheaper, but pay attention that you book with a transfer company that is stationed in Slovenia because international companies sometimes ‘forget’ to pick up their clients (and it is much easier to get a refund if that happens with Slovenian company). Airport taxis have their permission displayed at the left corner of the windshield and if they charge you with an excessive price you can file a report with Ljubljana Airport (just save a receipt). 
* Private transfers similar to taxis but usually booked in advance you have a fixed rate (so there is no room for inflated bills) and drivers wait for you at the airport personally. There are plenty of companies and you can arrange your airport transfer from home well in advance of your travel. You can also book a specific vehicle type or class, ranging from cars to minivans.
One the most experienced and reliable also according to TripAdvisor seems to be Airtrail Slovenia, company based in Ljubljana, which will either pick you up from one of the airports nearby or take you to a trip around the country or even broader.
* Rental car companies offer a large variety of manual and automatic vehicles: Dollar & Thrifty, Agio, Surprise, Atet, Advantage, Avantcar, Avis, Budget, Igma Car, ABC, Europcar, Hertz, Sixt, Anticus, Adria Car, Green Motion, Alamo, Enterprise, National and Interrent.

* Klagenfurt Airport (IATA: KLU)
* Trieste Airport (IATA: TRS)
* Venice Airport (IATA: VCE)
* Treviso Airport (IATA: TSF)

By bus

Bus Station Ljubljana ( is right next to the train station and has services throughout Slovenia, as well as to foreign countries. The station has several useful schedule search engines (also in English) for working out connections; however these do not always have live availability information (i.e., a journey marked as "sold out" or "not available" on the machines may indeed still be bookable at the ticket offices). Generally speaking, a bus can take you almost anywhere in Slovenia within a few hours. Ticket offices are cash only (ATM is available next to the ticket offices).

By train

The Ljubljana bus and train stations are located next to each other at Trg Osvobodilne fronte (Trg means square in Slovenian). The two stations are located just north of the city center and a short walk from most hotels and attractions. The train station has a tourist information center, currency exchange, and left-luggage service.

Ljubljana is the hub of Slovenia's rail system and national operator Slovenske Zeležnice. Local trains run throughout the country - no point in Slovenia is more than 3 hours away. The fastest train is ICS (InterCitySlovenija) which runs from Koper to Maribor via Ljubljana (the most expensive). Local trains, such as LP or RG stop at every station (the cheapest). IC, EC and MV trains connect major cities (Ljubljana, Maribor, Murska Sobota, Jesenice, Koper).

Direct international connections include (2 hours), (3 hours), (3 hours), (4 hours), (6 hours), (6 hours), (7.5 hours), (10 hours), (11 hours). There are two trains per day to (2.5 hours) and eight trains a day in each direction to Villa Opicina (2 hours).

Nearby can be reached with a change of trains in Divača and Buzet. For this route a Pula Spezial ticket (€19 one way/€29 return) is available.

By car
Renting a car is also an option, especially if you are visiting remote destinations outside of Ljubljana.

Get around

On foot
The center of Ljubljana is small enough to cover on foot. You can pick up a free city map at a tourist information center or in the train station. Navigating or finding a street is easy as streets are clearly marked.

By bicycle
Bikes are available for rent at the Slovenian Tourist Information Center (beside the Central Market) as well as some of the hotels in the area (€1 for 2 hours, €5 for the whole day ending 7~9pm depending on season). There is also a system called "Bicikelj" where you can rent bikes for a week for just 1€. It has 300 bikes on 30 stations around the inner city part and you can subscribe with a credit card online. For more information go to this site: 

By city bus

The city's transportation authority LPP operates 26 bus lines, which are clean and run frequently (every 5-10 minutes, 15-30 minutes during the weekend and summer). Most bus routes operate 5am - 10.30pm (Sundays from 6am). Night lines are: N1 (10.30pm - 5am), 2, N3/N3B (9pm - 5am), N5 (9pm - 5am), 6 and 11B/N11 (9pm - 5am). Saturdays and Sundays no service on lines 11 (11B is Saturday and 20Z is Sunday replacement), 15, 22, 24, 28, 29 and 60. Sundays no service on lines 1 (1B/1S is replacement), 7L, 8 (1B/1S is replacement), 18, 20 (20Z is replacement), 21 and 27 (NS Rudnik - BTC - Letališka) does not operate on Sundays, it is replaced with a route 27K which goes from Bavarski dvor to Kolosej in BTC City and it's on service only on Sundays from 4PM onwards.

To ride the buses, you must first purchase an Urbana card (similar to an Oyster Card in ). These can be bought at self-service stations ("Urbanomat") found at the larger bus stops across the city, LPP sales sites, Tourist Information Centers and newspaper agents for €2 and need to be loaded with an amount ranging from €1 to €50. Upon entering the bus by the front door, you need to position the card next to the reader to pay for the route. The confirmation is a quiet beep and an illuminated green light, while a negative response is a louder beep and a red light. After that, you proceed to take your seat / stand.

The cost per journey is €1.30 and includes an unlimited number of free transfers within 90 minutes from the first entry to the bus. Although if you are a regular guest in Ljubljana and have a mobile with a Slovenian operator (for example A1, Mobitel, Izimobil, Debitel etc.) and you have a postpaid contract with them, you can pay the bus route with your mobile - you just dial 1899 at the entry of the bus and approach the Urbana device with your mobile and leave it there until the device approves the payment. It's a 'quite in handy' thing, but it costs €1.30 and you can use it only for the ride you're on (unlike Urbana card when you can have unlimited number of free transfers within 90 minutes from the first entry to the bus) - the amount will be charged from your number and viewable on your monthly payment.

Most lines operate at least once every 15 minutes. Timetables (in Slovene) only have departure times from first bus stop so you can use the webpage to obtain predicted departure times for next three buses from every bus stop.

By taxi
Note that not all taxis charge the same fare.

While taxis ordered by phone are cheap, those waiting on the street will usually charge through the roof, and you can end up paying €25 for a short ride. Unless you're in a hurry, always order a taxi by phone!

If you create a mess in the vehicle or otherwise damage it, you will have to pay for repairing/cleaning, tourist or not. Cleaning a cab usually costs 10-15 euro; if you don't have the money, they'll take valuables from you (phone, passport, jewelry, etc.), and return them if you agree to pay the bill. If things get out of hand, feel free to call the police -- it's your right to call them.

Taxi drivers are generally very nice people, but when it comes to the money, they can get violent quickly. You need to be extra careful when using 'freelancers' in Slovenian 'privatniki'. Ordering a taxi by phone is safer and much cheaper.

You might check out also some of private transfers companies which you preorder in advance and are mostly higher class vehicles and service for a reasonable or even lower rate than taxi. If you know the route you can make arrangements already from your home so everything is set up when you arrive to your destination.

Talk
The main language of the city is unsurprisingly . Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian/Montenegrin is generally understood by most people and frequently spoken fluently by adults, especially those over the age of 40. Most citizens speak at least some English, some speak it fluently. It's also worth trying any major European language you speak, especially German, as you just might be understood.

See

The easiest and most pleasant way to reach all spots described below is on foot, except for the Zoo and the Architecture Museum.

* Designed by Jože Plečnik. Tromostovje consists of three separate picturesque bridges located next to one another. The neighboring Prešeren square with the statue of Slovenian greatest poet France Prešeren is the central location of downtown Ljubljana and a common meeting point. From here, cross Ljubljanica and turn left for Open Market and the Dragon Bridge, or go straight and then right for the old town.

* Squeezed between the castle hill and Ljubljanica river is the old town with two squares, Mestni trg (City square) with the Robba fountain and the city hall behind it, and, further on, Gornji trg (Upper square). Well preserved medieval buildings now house local designer shops, and several popular cafes and restaurants. Although they may look creepy, the perfectly safe narrow lanes lead to charming little squares and buildings.

* Completed in 1901, designed by Croatian Jurij Zainovich. It is guarded by four detailed dragon statues from the city's coat-of-arms. Look out for the dragon motif throughout the city. Be careful around the Dragon Bridge area, as it is on a major busy road just outside the pedestrian zone and near misses (and worse) between inattentive tourists and traffic are common. The dragon bridge is located at the end of the Ljubljana Open Market, just a block or two down the river (north-east direction) from the Triple bridge.

* You can catch the "tourist train" from the Triple Bridge to the castle, or walk up the (quite steep) hill to the castle (5-10min), or take the Funicular Railway (€3/2 (adult/concession), 4€ return for one adult), the lower station is at the top of the main Open market. Entrance to the Castle Courtyard, Chapel, Wall and Gift shop is free, but there is a charge for access to the tower.The tower has magnificent views all over the city.

* The main city park. You can sit down on a park bench and enjoy the sun. There is also a childern's playground and a lot of paths to walk. Rožnik (the hill overlooking Ljubljana from the west) is a short hike away through the woods. This is a popular weekend destination for the locals.

The food is hearty and served in generous gut-busting portions and very good value for money. The fish cooked in a paper bag with vegetables is highly recommended. There is plenty of meat, fish and vegetarian dishes to choose from. The only downside was the house red, which is very sharp and quite cold, but this is a minor quibble.

Most of Ljubljana’s bars tend to cluster on the streets running parallel to the river, radiating from Prešernov trg, which is the main square in Ljubljana.

* Anyone with any interest in wine should visit here. The cosy, candlelit wine bar comes with knowledgeable barmen who can recommend a wine based on your tastes.

The prices can vary from modest to a remortgage.

* Fun, energetic pub. Serves mulled wine in winter.

* Scratch Rock Bar, dedicated to classic, mainstream and underground rock music, offers a wide choice of beers, sandwiches and snacks, and, above all, a varied programme of events related to rock music.

It has also concerts and an outside garden where they also grill in the summer. Gromka is a smaller one usually admission free and the music also differs from night to night. Usually it's rock/alternative hits or rockabilly or fun 90s music. It has also concerts. Menza pri Koritu is the most alternative and it has mainly alternative, metal, punk concerts and after parties. Channel Zero is more about electronics (also concerts) - d'n'b, dub, electro, house. Jalla Jalla is the smallest one with sometimes obscure, experimental music. Tiffany is a gay club with usually electronic parties. In Metelkova everybody can find a place for himself (usually the most is happening on weekends) and you can just walk from one to another club and see what is going on (if there is no admission).

* National and international DJs play electronic music.

* Located on the top floor/roof of a downtown department store, this trendy nightclub offers fantastic views of downtown Ljubljana. Music varies depending on the day of the week.

* Currently one of the hottest clubs in town (as August 2012) - it's opened through summer too. Parties are on Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. On Wednesdays you can experience R'n'B music, on Thursdays dance music, Fridays house and on Saturdays disco music. Entry fee is €5, €100/table for VIP (with it you get a table and a 'boat' for 5 persons). Age limit is M18+/F18+ on Wednesdays and Thursdays, and M21+/F18+ on Fridays and Saturdays. VIP is 25+.

* 
Klub 12 or 'dvanajstka' means twelve in slovenian is the last stop of Ljubljana's nightlife. They are playing Balkan, turbo folk music, it opens at 4.00 and is open till 10.00 in the morning. 18+ sometimes 21+, for women there is no age limits. Enter fee is from 5-15euro, again no fee for womans. 

Some litte saftey advices:

Do not argue with security guards, they are not very friendly!

Do not start or be involved in fight inside the club!

Homosexuals are not very welcome so i would advice them to avoid this club!

Never i repeat never drive drunk around 'dvanajska' club, police is looking for their cut, and the fines are extremly high(1000euro>) involving towing your car away! Always take a taxi, bus or 0,00 alcohol drive.

Stay safe

Ljubljana is possibly one of the safest capitals you'll ever visit. Remarkably safe during the day and night, as a tourist you should have no problems, provided you are not desperately looking for trouble.

Even the rougher parts of Ljubljana, located far from the city centre, are relatively safe, if you don't flash your valuables. These areas, not commonly frequented by tourists, include Fužine, Vevče, Rakova Jelša, Štepanjsko naselje and parts of Šiška, Moste and Šentvid. Firearm and weapon attacks are extremely uncommon, with confrontations being mostly physical. 

After shops close for the night, the BTC shopping center area at the northeast of the city is frequented by reckless drivers, so extra caution is recommended for pedestrians and drivers.

Tivoli Park is generally very safe and a very popular destination for picnics or taking an afternoon stroll for an average Ljubljanian, but just as anywhere in the world it is recommended that you don't put your guard down and avoid larger groups of teenagers hanging around in the park late at night, as thefts and sexual assaults have been reported.

Scam artists and pickpockets are very uncommon, but are still present and target tourists. Take care as you would in any city. Homeless people and beggars are also uncommon and are not violent or confrontational.

Although Ljubljana is for the most part an open and tolerant city, gay-bashings have been reported in recent years, so you'll be better off keeping the nature of your sexual orientation down a bit. Rural regions of Slovenia might be even more hostile towards the LGBT community, though the attacks are limited to verbal confrontations. 

The police in Slovenia is in general trustworthy and helpful.

All in all, Ljubljana is one of the safest cities around the globe.

Get out

 Hills around the city 

* Šmarna gora (662 m), is a popular (and overcrowded on weekends) hill on the northern outskirts of the city. For 30-60 minutes of easy climbing you will be rewarded with a nice view over the entire city. Bus number 8 will take you to the foothill; get off at 'Tacen'.

* Off the beaten track, Krim mountain (1107 m), used to station a military and civilian communication center due to its' strategic position overlooking most of Slovenia. With only the civilian part remaining, the top is open to the public and offers a great 360 degree panoramic view on clear days, especially after it rains. The climb takes 2-3 hours (beware of bears!), with the most convenient access by car. The last 4 kilometers of the road are unpaved and narrow, so even by car the journey will take about 30 minutes each way.
