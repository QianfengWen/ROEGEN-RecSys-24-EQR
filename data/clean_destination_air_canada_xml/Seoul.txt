Seoul (서울) is the capital of . Before, Seoul was the capital of the Korea from 1394 until the formal division of the country In 1948. With a municipal population of over 11.8 million, and a metropolitan population totaling over 25.6 million, Seoul is by far South Korea's largest city and one of East Asia's financial and cultural epicenters. Seoul also serves as the cultural, economic, business and political center of South Korea where skyscrapers towers over its buddhist temples. A fascinating blend of ancient traditions and cutting-edge digital technology, home to endless street food vendors and vast nightlife districts, an extraordinarily high-pressure educational system and serene Buddhist temples, a trend-setting youth culture and often crushing conformism, extraordinary architecture and endless monotonous rows of grey apartment buildings, Seoul is a city filled with stark contrasts.

Understand 

Seoul is the largest city in South Korea as well as the political and economic capital. The city houses 11.8 million people, and the metropolitan area has 25.6 million, which is just over half of the population of South Korea. By some measures it is the world's second largest urban agglomeration, after .

Seoul has a long history stretching far back into Korea's dynastic past. There is evidence for settlement in this area as far as 18 BC but Seoul as the capital city of Korea has a history back to the 14th century. Originally named Hanseong (한성; 漢城), the city was the capital of the Joseon Dynasty from 1392 to 1910, and remained the capital of Korea during the period of Japanese colonial rule which followed under the name Gyeongseong (경성; 京城), or Keijo in Japanese. The Joseon Dynasty built most of Seoul's most recognisable landmarks, including the Five Grand Palaces and Namdaemun. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, the city was re-named to its current name, Seoul. Since the establishment of the Republic of Korea in 1948, Seoul has been the capital of South Korea. Occupied twice during the Korean War by Communist forces, the city was extensively rebuilt and today is one of Asia's primary metropolises. 

While few historical points of interest remain (most of the temples and palaces are reconstructions), much of Seoul's infrastructure is exceptionally modern and clean. Skyscrapers and high rises abound. The subway system is the third-largest in the world and perhaps one of the finest. Seoul is truly vast - though the casual traveler can see most of the main sites in a few days, a dedicated traveler could spend weeks exploring all the alleyways and far-off neighborhoods. As the capital of a country that has gone through massive development in the past sixty years, it is constantly changing at an incredible pace, matched only by the mainland Chinese cities. This frantic pace of life is reflected everywhere - in Seoul's cutting-edge digital technology, in the millions of commuters rushing to work everyday, in one of the vibrant nightlife scene, and in the thousands of buildings still under construction.

In recent years, Seoul has been swamped with tourists from China, Japan, and Southeast Asia, following the success of Korean pop culture. Travelers will frequently overhear Japanese, Mandarin, or Cantonese; many restaurants and stores, especially in the more touristy areas like Myeongdong, will have signs in Japanese and Chinese as well as Korean and English. Long popular among Asians, Seoul has been relatively unknown in the West and frequently passed over by Westerners for nearby , , , and . However, recently things have been changing; tourism numbers to Seoul have been exploding in the past five years or so, with no indications of slowing down or stopping.

Orientation
Seoul is a very well organized city covering over 600 km² with a population of around 11.8 million. It is a new modern city built on an ancient and shining history. The city is located in the north-western portion of South Korea approximately 40 km east of the Yellow Sea and 60 km south of the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The city is roughly bisected by the Han River (한강 Hangang), which runs east to west across the city. Seoul blurs seamlessly into its surrounding satellite cities, most of which are also served by the Seoul metro. The largest of these is Incheon (to the west) in which Seoul's main Airport, and the area's main seaport, are located. Other satellite cities include such as Ilsan (to the north), Gwacheon and (to the south).

Districts

Administratively, Seoul is divided into 25 districts (구 gu), each with an area and population comparable to a small city. The districts are then further subdivided into 522 sub-districts (동 dong). The Han river bisects the city, splitting it into two halves: Gangbuk (강북), the northern, more historical half, and Gangnam (강남), the southern, wealthier and more modern half. The sheer size of the city means that travelers to Seoul will find it difficult to locate a true "center" of Seoul; instead, Seoul is almost more like a collection of cities that happen to be bunched together, each with their own central business and commercial districts. The two largest core areas are Jongno/Jung in the north, and Gangnam in the south. For travelers with more time, there are many more, smaller centers and districts to be explored, such as the island of Yeoui-do and the college district of Hongdae/Sinchon. For the typical traveler, it would be useful to divide the city into the following areas:

North of the River (강북 Gangbuk)
* (종로) &ndash; The Joseon-era historical core of the city, containing most palaces and government offices. This district, along with Jung (중) district immediately to the south of it, makes up one of the main centers of the city. Here you can find the most famous of the Five Grand Joseon Palaces, Gyeongbokgung, with a long avenue attracting many tourists leading up to the main gate. To the east of Gyeongbokgung are clustered Changdeokgung and Changyeonggung, two more of the Five, and Jongmyo Shrine, the main Confucian shrine in the dynastic era designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995. Sandwiched between these two areas is Bukchon, a quaint housing area filled with 'hanok', beautiful traditional Korean houses that also date back to the dynastic era. South of Bukchon is Insa-dong which is the largest antiques market street in Seoul and the cultural heart of the city, and further south is Cheongyecheon, a renovated stream and park that runs through the heart of the downtown area.

* (중) &ndash; This district makes up the other half of the historic core, with Cheongyecheon stream as its northern border. It holds some of the few remaining European-style government buildings left over from the Japanese imperial colonialism era - the City Hall and the Bank of Korea, both in the west, centered around a large plaza often serves as a rallying point for protests and soccer games. Immediately to the southwest of the City Hall is Myeongdong, an large upscale shopping district that gets extremely busy at night and on weekends, and one of the top ten most expensive shopping districts in the world by rent. To the south of the City Hall is Namdaemun Market, another large shopping district that is decidedly cheaper than neighboring Myeongdong. Further south of Namdaemun is Seoul Station and Namsan Mountain, with the Seoul Tower at its summit. Finally, the eastern part holds Dongdaemun, an enormous fashion district with dozens of clothing malls, complexes, wholesalers, and department stores.

* (서대문/마포) &ndash; These two districts lie immediately west of Jongro and Jung, and contain dozens of universities and colleges. As such, this area is home to some of Seoul's most active nightlife districts: Hongdae (홍대) and Sinchon (신촌). Sinchon is close to Yonsei University, one of the most prestigious in Korea, and has hundreds of restaurants, bars, clubs, and stores that are open well into early morning, packed with throngs of students during the weekend. Hongdae is famous for being the center of Seoul's indie and underground arts scene &ndash; expect to see street performers, indie rock bands, graffiti, and independent stores. During the night, Hongdae really comes alive, even more crowded than Sinchon and absolutely enormous &ndash; it's easy to get lost inside this huge nightlife district, and has the second highest concentration of foreigners, after Itaewon.

* (용산) &ndash; Yongsan is home to the US Army Military Base as well as one of the largest electronics markets in the world, Yongsan Electronics Market. On the top floor of this market is a Starcraft Arena - and yes, computer-obsessed Korea does, in fact, regularly broadcast Starcraft matches on national television. This is also where you'll find Itaewon (이태원), perhaps the most culturally diverse area on the entire peninsula and home to dozens of restaurants featuring cuisine from the world over, numerous shops selling everything from custom-tailored suits to antiques, and several Western pubs and bars. Itaewon also has the only mosque in Korea, and as such there are a growing number of Middle Eastern and Pakistani immigrants. Talks are also finalizing on Yongsan International Business District, a $28.8 billion dollar project that when completed, will have a 665m centerpiece tower, the second tallest in the world.

South of the River (강남 Gangnam)
* (강남) &ndash; Gangnam is the glitzy center of modern Seoul, home to hundreds of glass and steel skyscrapers, neon billboards, and some of the most expensive real estate in the country. The core business district runs along Tehran-ro from Samseong Station to Gangnam Station. Gangnam station is the true center of Gangnam - with dozens of high rises, hundreds of restaurants and bars, and thousands upon thousands of neon signs lining Gangnam street, this area is not only a major commercial and nightlife center for young adults, it is Korea at its futuristic, digital, high-tech best. Samseong station at the other end of Tehran-ro is connected to COEX, a huge underground shopping mall with a movie theater, aquarium, hotels, food courts, and a Hyundai Department Store. To the north of this business district (but still in Gangnam) is Apgujeongdong and Cheomdangdong, some of the most affluent areas in Seoul, and home to hundreds of upscale luxury brands and department stores.

* &ndash; a primarily residential district east of Gangnam where you'll find Lotte World, Olympic Park, Seoul (Jamsil) Sports Complex, and the Sincheon nightlife district. Lotte World is an unusual place - just a few bus stops away from COEX, it is yet another enormous shopping and entertainment complex, but with a twist: It holds one of the largest ice-skating rinks in Korea, and the largest indoor theme park in the world. Good for families with children, but be warned: on a rainy day, the shortest lines may be an hour or longer. Sincheon (신천, not to be confused with Sinchon, 신촌) is a large, crowded nightlife area, mainly populated by an older, local business crowd due to its location near Gangnam.

* (여의도) &ndash; An island in the Han River in Yeongdeungpo-gu (영등포-구) and the closest Seoul gets to Manhattan with skyscrapers, the National Assembly and the Seoul Stock Exchange. Though it may seem attractive for tourists, in reality there isn't too much to do here, and the island gets pretty desolate during the weekends.

*Yangcheon &ndash; a district of western Seoul with the Mok-dong area at its centre, home to some of the tallest residential buildings in Seoul, a large Hyundae department store and an ice rink.

Climate
Seoul has a temperate climate with 4 distinct seasons that is heavily affected by the east asian monsoon season and Siberia. Winters are cold and dry and warm clothes are definitely recommended. Most of the season's winds blow from eastern Siberia, leading to colder temperatures than cities in the same latitude such as and in Japan and China respectively. Most nights drop below -5°C (23°F) and days usually remain just above freezing. When strong cold waves hit the country, Seoul is usually one of the first cities that gets affected leading to temperatures sometimes below -10°C (15°F) and on extreme cases below -15°C (5°F). The most recent occasion was in January 2016, when a very strong cold wave affected a large part of Asia, the mercury in Seoul dipped to -18°C (0°F) for the first time in 15 years. The lowest recorded temperature is -22°C (-8°F). Precipitation is usually limited to around 60-70 milimeters each year (2.5-3 inches) and most of it falls as snow. 

Spring and fall are by far the best times to visit since the city doesn't have neither too warm nor too cold temperatures. Just keep in mind that March and November still have chilly nights and that September falls in the Asian Typhoon Season.

Summer is warm and very wet. Temperatures usually hover between 20°C (68°F) and 30°C (86°F) but occasional heat waves can push them as high as 35°C (95°F). The record high is 40°C (104°F) but such high temperatures are rare. What a visitor really needs to watch out during summer are the torrential rains, brought by the East Asian Monsoon. Most of it falls in July and August, in the form of thunderstorms, with these two months accounting for more than 60% of the yearly precipitation. Flash flooding can occur in the mountainous areas so one needs to be careful when venturing there and the weather forecast calls for rain. Typhoons very rarely hit Seoul itself but the remnants of those that hit the southern coast of Korea can bring heavy rainfall.

Get in 

By plane 

Incheon Airport

Most visitors arrive via (),( located on in the neighboring city of and covered in detail . 

Upon arrival, it is worth visiting a convenience store to purchase a . This is a rechargeable transport card that can be used on subways, city/local buses, a reasonable number of taxis and can even be used to make purchases at convenience stores. Along with ₩50 discount upon each bus/subway use, it also gives you discount for connecting buses from subway, or vice versa up to 5 times within 30 mins. You will be surprised that the ATMs in the airport don’t accept most foreign credit cards, therefore bringing cash can be very helpful. 

Getting to Seoul from Incheon Airport

By AREX 

AREX or 'airport train 공항철도' connects Incheon airport to Seoul Station (for further connections to KTX high-speed services) and Gimpo Airport (most domestic flights and some International flights from/to Japan, China, and Taiwan), operating from 5:20 AM until midnight. Two versions exist: Express services to the city (every half hour) takes 43 minutes and cost ₩9,000 or ₩7,500 with a group discount (with WiFi available on board), while all-stop trains (every 6 to 12 minutes) take 59 minutes and cost about ₩4,000. Some subway lines of Seoul are connected directly to the all-stop train, so consider it if you have plans to take subway to go on. If you show your boarding pass from Asiana or Korean Airlines you get a discount when buying the ticket for the AREX Information Booth 

By Airport Limousine Bus

If you have a lot of luggage, limousine buses are a good option. Limousine buses(₩10,000 - 15,000 to/from city for one way, ₩6,500 to/from Gimpo Airport. They travel directly to major areas and big hotels in Seoul, while public buses (₩8,000-9,000) will take you to major transit hubs. If you're visiting for the first time, it's worth paying a bit extra for the limousine bus. For either bus type, consult the big maps or staff to figure out which route best suits your needs; you can then find the shuttles outside 1st floor arrivals (if possible get this information from your hotel before arriving). Or simply, walk out and ask the many ticket sellers (they are wearing vests) which bus goes to your hotel because if it's a popular one or in a popular area, they'll surely know which you'll need. It's best to buy tickets at any of the ticket gates near the bus arrival area but you can also pay the fare using won or a T-Money card. The limousine bus drivers are extremely friendly but don't count on them knowing too much English. There are maps inside the buses letting passengers know which stops are upcoming and these are also announced in Korean and English. Pressing any of the red buttons inside signals to the driver you want off at the next stop.

If you have a late flight and plan on getting into Seoul via bus, make sure you get out to the curb as soon as you can. The last buses run shortly after the last flights land. If you miss your bus, you'll be stuck paying for a taxi, as the trains will stop running too.

By Taxi

A taxi direct to Seoul will cost around ₩60,000-90,000 depending on your destination. You are expected to pay any road tolls on top of the meter fare (usually 6,500 for the main bridge linking to Seoul). Having your destination written down in Korean will be very helpful. As both buses and taxis are subject to traffic, allow extra time for rush hour delays. Beware of drivers that might take detour or fake taxis that charge "tourist prices".

Book a taxi, van, minibus, coach in advance to have the driver meet you upon arrival and pay fixed prices (no surprises). If you have children in tow, big group or lot of luggage, door-to-door service would be helpful. 

Getting to Incheon Airport from Seoul

Take AREX, taxi or Limousine Bus. Leave ample time considering the traffic if you are taking taxi or bus. Rush hours are usually weekdays 8-10am, 5-8pm, all day on weekends or holidays. Traffic will get worse just before holidays. 

It is worth noting that with some airlines you can check into your Incheon flight in Seoul Station before you get on the AREX train. Immigration officers are also on hand to stamp your passport, which means you are processed and can quickly go through the Diplomatic Departures entrance in Incheon Airport. However note, you can only do this if flying from Incheon on Asiana, Jeju Air or Korean Air.

Gimpo Airport
The closer but older Gimpo Airport (김포국제공항, GMP) caters only to the shuttle services to -Haneda, -Kansai, -Songshan, -Hongqiao and , as well as domestic flights within .

Gimpo Airport is easily reached on the A'REX link from Seoul Station or Incheon Airport, as well as subway lines 5 and 9. All lines intersect Line 2 which runs in a large circle through Seoul. Line 9 (Gold Line), a private subway line in Seoul, has three express trains per hour. Travelers coming into Seoul should first have detailed directions to their destination from the nearest station then consult the subway map before deciding on which line and route to take. All three lines cost ₩1,000-2,100 (depending on distance), while a taxi to central Seoul will run around ₩30,000. Discounts for subway fare are available with T-Money cards.

By train 
Seoul is the northern terminus of the KTX high-speed line. There are three KTX stations within city limits:
* Seoul Station (서울역) for trains to , , , , , and . Accessible via subway lines 1 & 4.

* Yongsan Station (용산역), for trains to , , and . Also on line 1 & 4 (Sinyongsan Station).

* The newly added KTX at Youngdeungpo is now running to southern destinations.

Nearly all ordinary (non-KTX) services also use one or both of the above terminals, but services east to or and southeast to via use Cheongnyangni Station (청량리역), to the east of the city on line 1.

By bus
Every weekend approximately 2 million Seoulites leave the city, which goes a long way to explaining why the city has five major intercity bus terminals. 

* Central City Terminal, also known as Honam Terminal, (Metro Lines 3, 7 or 9, Express Bus Terminal stn). Directly adjacent to the Express terminal, serves buses to and . 
 
* Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, (동서울버스터미널), Gangbyeon stn (Line 2). Buses to points east of Seoul ( and some part of ).

* Seoul Express Bus Terminal, (서울고속버스터미널), (Metro Lines 3, 7, or 9, Express Bus Terminal stn). Also known as Gangnam Terminal and Gyeongbu-Yeongdong Terminal, this is the largest of them all and serves pretty much the entire country, but most services head east (incl. , , ). Lines to Jeolla, however, use the Central City/Honam Terminal right next door. For the most part there's no need to buy a ticket days in advance except for maybe during holidays. There's even a ticket window labeled "Tickets for Foreigners" where the attendant can speak English. Fare from Seoul-Busan is about ₩20,000 and buses come continuously throughout the day. Small restaurants and snacks are all throughout the station. Journeys longer than 2 hrs. typically will have a short stop at a rest area. Most buses are very comfortable and extremely safe.

* Nambu Bus Terminal, Nambu Bus Terminal stn (Line 3). Serves places southwest of Seoul (Southern , and nothern ).

By boat
There are ferry services to various points in from the neighboring port city of . Currently no services run from Japan directly to Seoul. is the main port for ferries to Japan (about 2-2.5 hours by KTX train), where several ferry and hydrofoil options are available. 

There is a weekly scheduled ferry service (with dbs ferry) linking Vladivostok in Russia, Donghae in South Korea and Sakaiminato in Japan. From March to November it departs from Vladivostok on Wednesdays, arriving at Donghae on Thursdays and continuing towards Sakaiminato arriving on Fridays. The return trip departs Sakaiminato on Saturdays, to arrive on Donghae on Sundays and to Vladivostok on Mondays. From December to February the route is similar with the exception of spending an extra night in Donhae on the way from Japan to Russia and so arriving to Vladivostok on Tuesdays.

By car
No matter where in Korea you start your journey, there will be tolled expressways (Gosok Doro) and national highways (Gook Do) that lead to Seoul; the most important one is the Gyeongbu Expressway, linking Seoul with . To avoid the daily traffic jam on the Gyeongbu Highway near Seoul, take Jungbu/2nd Jungbu, Seohaean, or Yongin-Seoul Expressway.

Get around
For most Koreans, especially upper class, the car is the preferred mode of transportation, which leads to huge traffic jams and chaotic parking situations, throughout the city. Taxis are common to get around since public transport doesn't cover large parts of the city, but are slow since they get stuck in traffic and can get expensive due to the extended travel time during rush hour. Use the subway whenever possible, but try to avoid the rush hour during weekdays. Street and subway signage is usually written in English as well as Korean.

 A note on walking 
Koreans have been driving on the right side of the road since 1945 when it was more convenient to US and Soviet forces using their imported military vehicles.
Walking however, continued to go on the left side.
It was only in 2009 when it was formally decided to switch walking to the right as well.
You will see many markings on the pavement to encourage people in this.
However. Many people have not changed habits ingrained from childhood (haven't we all...), so many people continue on the left. Be prepared for the ensuing conflicts...
Be cautious when using pedestrian crossings. Cars are legally required to stop for pedestrians but often they won't stop, which can lead to dangerous situations.

By subway

 General 
In Seoul, you can visit most places by using the subway system, the second most used metro transportation system in the world. 
* There are currently a total of 18 lines (nine numbered lines, the AREX express airport line, plus a smattering of named suburban lines), all distinguished by different colors.
* Some colours are quite similar to others, like the blue (or violet?) and dark blue line. In some representations this can be hard to distinguish, so look carefully. Colours also seem to be changed when there are major upgrades on the services. Some (formerly) blus lines are now shown in green on current maps.
* Mobile phone coverage on the trains is excellent, under ground and above.
* Wifi is available, too.
* Transferring between lines might involve longish underground walks and a lot of stairs or escalators.
* Plattforms are accessible through elevators which involves detours, though. While those are clearly marked inside the stations, it can be tough to find them from street level.
* Many exits do not have escalators, so you might have to carry luggage up and down stairs (however, there will always be a lift/elevator available, it just might not be the closest exit to your destination).

 Navigating 
All signs in the subway system are in Korean (both hangeul and if applicable, hanja) and English. Most signs also have Japanese and Chinese written names. The signs leading to the platform for a particular direction of travel on a given subway line typically list the names of a number of stations in that direction. Stations each have a 3 digit number, but locals rarely make use of these numbers, and they're not on most subway maps, so don't rely on them. Note that the first digit gives the line number.

On the platform, directions are indicated by giving the previous and the next station in the direction of travel.

Be sure to search for updated subway maps as the Seoul metro system is constantly expanding and many maps even on the subway cars may not be the fully updated versions. A subway map can be found here: Also be sure to download the KakaoMetro app for IOS or Android to transit around Seoul.

Using navigation apps works on the trains, even underground. If in doubt of your direction or the next station, check on your smartphone.
Also, most trains have electronic displays showing the line, the next station and which side the exit will be on in English.

It is a good idea to check the exit you want in advance using a navigation app. Exits are numbered and shown clearly on the platforms in yellow fields.
Some stations are extensive with long underground walks and getting the right exit lets you avoid detours and crossing busy roads.

 Fares 
 General 
Subway fares are based on the distance traveled, but the shortest ride costs ₩1,250 (base charge with T-Money card) or ₩1,350 (single-ticket journey)

* The base charge roughly covers up to 10km of the journey and ₩100 is added for every 5km beyond that. 
* Single-ride cards can be purchased from vending machines ONLY.
* All vending machines accept coins and bills, up to ₩10,000 notes (and some ₩50,000 notes, but cash exchange machines are at each station).
* Hang onto your card until the end of your trip, as you'll need it to get out. 
* Most of Seoul's automated card machines are equipped with touchscreen and full English support (along with Chinese and Japanese).
* Since ticket machines may be crowded, buying two cards (one for each way) is recommended.

 Turnstile touchpads 
* When entering and leaving a subway turnstile, place the card on the reader (leaving it inside your purse or wallet is fine) and it will deduct the appropriate fare from the card. The same is true for the buses, but be aware that in the countryside only placing it once when entering may be sufficient.
* They show the amount remaining on your card or the number of trips made this day for multi day passes.

 T-Money cards 
If planning on using the Metro extensively or staying for more than a few days, you should consider purchasing a stored value contact-less smart card. 

Using this card will allow you to save ₩100 on all trips, and it will account for transfers between bus, train and subway instead of charging a single trip for each type of transport - these are common with Seoul's extensive subway system. It also saves the hassle from figuring out how much you need to pay or waiting in line to buy a single-use ticket.
* Cards require a deposit ₩500 (refundable if you return the card at designated machines at each station). 
* Cash can be charged onto the card as often as you like.
* Multi-day passes are available at approx. W10.000 per day and are limited to 20 trips per day. So they are useful from 8 trips per day.

 Operating times 
The subway is not open 24 hours, so you may be stranded late at night. The last train on most lines finishes its run by midnight.
Lines stop running earlier(!) on weekends and holidays.
Current locations of stations are available at Seoul Metro website (Korean only) and operating hours are available at Metroseoul (Korean/English/Chinese)

 Facilities 
Many stations double as underground shopping areas. All have convenience stores and offer free toilets as well.
They also have lockers (which are in demand, so don't rely on finding a free one too much) and waste bins (which otherwise are hard to find).

By bus
Seoul also has a very well connected and extensive bus transportation service. 

There are four different kinds of buses: yellow, green, blue, and red and gyeonggi.
* Yellow buses have a short circuit usually around tourist areas.
* Green buses travel around neighborhoods and connect with the subway.
* Blue buses go across town
* Red-and-green 'G' (Gyeonggi) buses are intercity buses.

Buses will only stop at designated bus stops and will not wait for indecisive travelers.

Adult fare is as follows:
* Cash &ndash; ₩1,300
* T-Money Card &ndash; ₩1,200

By using a T-Money card, you can transfer for up to 30min between bus and subway and don't have to pay twice but less or even 0 depending on the distance. Note that if you do not tag the machine as you leave the bus, you will be charged the maximum fare possible by the route.

The city of Seoul provides an interactive bus map at the following site: Seoul Public Transportation System Guide 

By taxi
There are many types of taxis in Seoul. Standard taxis will be an orange or silver color while deluxe taxis are black with a yellow sign and are more expensive than regular taxis but provide better and more comfortable service. For the most part, regular taxi cabs have leather interiors and the drivers are nice--so, for many people, "regular" in Seoul might be "deluxe" in their hometown. It is easy to hail a taxi any time of the day or night along any relatively major Seoul street with bright LED lights in the front of the windshield to denote an available car (빈차) or off if the car is taken. If the LED screen denotes "빈차" it means it is available and if it denotes "예약", it means the taxi is en route to a previously arranged appointment through a call service which may be used without fee when needed. 

You can call a deluxe taxi wherever you are by calling 3431-5100. Sometimes, you can find a visitor's guide taxi or an international taxis exclusively for foreigners, a kind of deluxe taxi, the drivers of which know English and Japanese and can guide you around Seoul.

The basic fare for regular taxis is, as of 2014, ₩3,000 (₩3,680 at night), with a surcharge of ₩100 applied according to time and distance. (The basic fare is up to 2 km, plus ₩100 per 144 m.) In deluxe taxis, the basic fare is ₩4500 and the additional fare increases in increments of ₩200. (₩4500 basic fare for up to 3 km, plus ₩200 per 164 m). International taxi drivers speak at least one foreign language (generally English) fluently. International taxis use the same basic fare as regular taxis, plus an additional 20%.

If there is more than one passenger, and you are traveling only a short distance (like 1-2 metro stops) it is usually cheaper to catch a taxi than to take a bus or subway. 

In general, taxi drivers do not speak English or any other foreign language, so have your destination written in Korean to show to the taxi driver. It is also wise to get your hotel's business card in case you get lost. Some may even reject looking at a map so whenever possible, have the location written in Korean.

All taxis advertise a free interpretation service that can be called if you need help. The phone number for the interpretation is on the window sticker of the back seats. Taxis that have an "On Base Authorized" sticker on the side, or a green sticker on their front bumper, are capable of entering US military bases in Seoul. These drivers are required to speak better English as part of their contract and may thus be easier for any English speaking tourists.

Most taxis accept credit cards and T-money cards and thus have a V-shaped orange card sign on the roof of the taxi by the front passenger seat window. However, drivers generally prefer that you pay cash, especially for short rides.

You can also ask for your receipt ("Yeong-su-jeung" 영수증).

As in any other city, there are some bad apples, and some drivers may take you the long way. Although the drivers often have a GPS device on the dashboard of their car, this is relatively meaningless if you do not know the area or cannot speak sufficient Korean to argue the point. Korean taxi drivers have been known to take "the long way" when arriving to destinations when the passenger seems to be oblivious as to how to arrive at the respective destination. Therefore, it is important to be tough-minded to keep the driver in check and to make sure he knows where the destination is. However, you will have no problem getting to a destination if you have an accurate address as no place in Korea is unreachable due to its immaculate GPS systems. 

In general, make sure the driver turns on the meter, get an idea of the cardinal direction of your destination (north, south, east, west), and use the interpretation service if you want to agree to a fare beforehand. Meters are standard in every taxi in Korea and it is illegal to haggle for a negotiated fare. 

However, keep in mind that there is often road construction or protests around Seoul, so sometimes a long route is necessary. If you suspect you are being ripped off, the most a non-Korean speaker can do is write down or take a picture of the driver's ID (located above the glove box) and report the details to the company. Also, make sure to get into the taxi first then tell the driver of your destination as it is illegal and grounds for prosecution if a driver refuses to take passengers once they have entered the vehicle.

By car
Internationally known car rental companies like Hertz are in Seoul, just be prepared for a driving challenge and long rush hours. In addition, parking spaces are hard, if not close to impossible to find, especially during peak hours. Therefore, unless you are planning to head out of the city, it is not advisable to rent a car and you are better off relying on the excellent public transport system instead.

On bicycle or on foot
Getting around in Seoul without a local escort (be it friend or cab driver) can be tricky, since this is one of the most densely populated cities in the world. While Seoul occupies less land than New York City, it can be more confusing. The major roads twist and turn, the various rail lines, rivers and mountains are obstacles and the smaller roads turn into a labyrinth of alleys. Most people will try to help you find your way around but often won't know themselves; best to familiarize yourself with some landmarks and the nearest subway stations. Learn the landmarks closest to where you are staying. The better-known landmarks in Seoul (such as the N Seoul Tower located in the center of town) can prove helpful at times. A compass will still work when a GPS fails.

Once you know your immediate surroundings, you'll find that Seoul isn't such a huge place and the pedestrian approach can be an enriching experience. 
 
There's usually a subway stop within a ten-minute walk in any direction.

Whether on bicycle or foot, the best way to escape traffic is to learn the rivers and streams. Most of these waterways empty into the Han River or another tributary to the Han, so look to the direction of water flow at any creek; chances are, it's headed for the Han. The Han runs right through town, generally moving West (sometimes Southwest; sometimes Northwest), so knowing where you are in relation to the Han is helpful. 

The Han River as well as most streams are lined with massive parks that feature outdoor gymnasiums, multiple-lane bicycle paths, and 24-hour restrooms. Cars are generally not allowed. Pedestrian bridges on the smaller waterways are common.

Numerous mountains with hiking trails can be found in the city.

Talk

As elsewhere in Korea, a grasp of basic will be helpful. If you plan on an extended visit, consider learning to read the Korean written script, hangeul. It takes very little time to pick up the basics, and it can be endlessly helpful. A quick (free) visit to the Story of King Sejong Exhibition Hall beneath the Statue of King Sejong in Gwanghwamun Square will give you an introduction to the Korean written language and some interactive exhibits to practice. Thirty minutes there will see you recognising and pronouncing some Korean words. 

Shops in major tourists areas, including Insadong, Myeongdong, and Itaewon, will probably have staff that speak at least some English, and some may have staff that speak Mandarin, Cantonese and/or Japanese. While all younger Koreans are required to study English in school, due to a lack of practice, proficiency is generally poor, and most residents of Seoul only know a few simple words and phrases. If lost, a useful tip is to write down your question in simple words and show it to someone young. That being said, it is still possible to get by using only English, though it goes without saying that a basic grasp of Korean will make your trip much smoother.

There is also a huge digital camera market in this area. Take Seoul subway line 4 to Hoehyeon station and follow signs to exit #5.

* Dongdaemun, This market is of equal historical significance to Namdaemun market. While Namdaemun is an old-fashioned market, Dongdaemun market has large department store-like buildings such as Doota, Migliore, and APM that have trendy shops and stalls grouped together so customers can shop efficiently and save time. Many younger people and tourists come here to shop. One of the buildings here, Dongdaemun General Market, sells Chimachogori, which is a Korean traditional dress, or bedclothes. Some of the shops like Nuzzon are open all night.

* Insa-dong. Insadong is known for its art galleries and shops, and is possibly the most touristy place in South Korea. It is a great place to buy cultural souvenirs. There are also a few stores that offer interesting vintage toys and various kitsch. Insadong also contains many traditional tea and coffee shops. It is one of the few places that vegetarian restaurants can be found. 

* Ewha Women's University. At the front gate of Ewha Women's University, visitors can find a dense market geared towards young women. You can find stores that sell clothes, shoes, hats, handbags, and so on. There are also clothes for men. Recently franchise stores have started to move into the area. 

* Yongsan Electronics Market. (Metro Line dark blue ,Yongsan stn)Yongsan Station is in IMall which is another huge shopping mall with two storeys full of electronics. Without negotiating you can have cheaper prices when compared to amazon.com. Yongsan is one option in Seoul if you are looking for electronics goods. Made up of over 20 buildings housing 5000 stores, you can find appliances, stereos, computers and peripherals, office equipment, telephones, lighting equipment, electronic games and software, and videos and CDs. A lot of the products are bought in Japan and resold in Korea by dealers. The market has a reputation for fleecing foreigners, particularly due to its proximity to the Yongsan U.S. Army Base. Be wary as Koreans try to avoid Yongsan for their electronics needs and rely instead on internet shopping as sellers in Yongsan are not averse to ripping you off if you don't seem to know a lot about electronics. If you go, it's best to bring a Korean guide so you can ensure you're getting a good deal. The problem is no or very poor English. Only Korean warranty. Cash prefered. At IMALL they add 5% as tax when you pay by Visacard. At Yongsan Electroland it dependes on the seller. Up to 10% addition is possible.

*Techno Mart. There are two Techno Marts in Seoul: 
** the new store at Sindorim station (use Sindorim station exit 2) has most of one floor dedicated to electronics, so it's a bit of a misnomer. It is more like a department store.
** the original at Gangbyeon station houses over 2,000 stores across most of its floors that sell a variety of high-tech products. From electrical appliances to computers, you will find everything you need. However, do not expect cutting-edge technology or bargains relative to your home country (pricers are similar to what you would pay in most of Europe, for example). 
*** The basement and first floors have clothing, cosmetics, accessories, and stationeries. The second and third floors comprise Korean-made electrical goods, while the fourth and fifth floors sell foreign-made electrical appliances. The sixth floor sells cell phones and their accessories. Computers are sold on the seventh, and on the eighth music and DVD stores. Aside from all the high-tech gadgetry, there are over a dozen restaurants on the 9th floor, and a cineplex and arcade on the 10th.
*** the 9th floor also has a roof terrace which offers a great view of the Lotte World Tower across the Han river.

Fashion
Fashion shopping in Seoul isn't a mere industry, it's an art form. 

Myeongdong, is probably the largest and best-known area; it is definitely the most tourist-friendly fashion area. In the spring and summer, fashion models/sidewalk promoters can be seen strolling the streets of Myeongdong promoting various cosmetics, stores or other fashion-related products. Many regular people also tend to catwalk their newest outfit on these streets. Rows of stores are available to look for that perfect accessory, and most of Korea's major brands can be found here: mVIO, Caspi Conus, WhoAU California, AHM, So.Basic, Noxon, Basic House, UGIZ, 1492, nipper, hang ten, A6, Bean Pole, Jambangee, Giordano as well as a few international brands such as Lacoste, Land Rover, Adidas, Gap, Zara, Koolhaas, Uniqlo, Anna Sui, and Forever 21.

* Migliore, One of the biggest fashion buildings in Seoul. It has 17 floors above ground and 7 basement floors. Information boards in Migliore are written in Korean as well as English, Japanese and Chinese for foreign tourists. US credit cards are often accepted, but ask before haggling if you aren't sure. The outside stage features a "talent show" of local dance groups (mostly high school or college student groups) most nights until about 9 PM; typically they are wearing many of the local fashions, and some of the dancers can be located in the various department stores working as employees.

* The oldest department store in entire Korean peninsula. Original store building is refurbished in 2008 and becomes high-street boutique. Accepts major credit cards, including Amex and JCB.

* A relatively new addition to the scene, located just across the street from Avatar department store. This department store is oriented towards a younger, upscale clientele, and in addition to the usual Korean brands and international brands, the top floor of the space features an assortment of quality eating establishments to replenish your shopping energy. The wine bar is recommended. Sometimes art installations can be found on the top floor. US credit cards accepted.

Apgujeong (압구정), widely known as "The Beverly Hills of Seoul" is the land of luxury, brand name goods. International brands like Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Dior, Gucci and Prada sit alongside Korean designer brands.

* Main store of well-known department store chain.

* A very popular upscale department store. Just several blocks away from Hyundai Department Store. It has a larger than usual modern men's section. Also has a branch in Seoul Station.

Near the Cheongdam Intersection lies the heart of the Korean shoe scene. Cutting edge shoe shops include Sue Comma Bonnie, Hyaang, Heels and Namuhana.

Following the big main road in front of Cheongnyangni station (37°34′50.44″N 127°02′53.38″E) north-east, many shops such as North Face, Adidas, etc. do appear.

Trends often begin in University areas like Hongdae. Hongik University boasts Korea's most famous art school, thus fashion in this area is often influenced by the students' artistic sensibilities. The shops in this area feature funky, punky, boho, and vintage style. Ewha Women's University also has a big shopping area in front of it’s main gate, as do many of the Women's colleges. Many trends also originate here. There are even seamstresses who can help you make your own designs come to life.

Duty free
Won, Yen and US dollars are accepted, along with major credit cards. Most shops have staff who can speak Japanese and Mandarin. There are duty-free shops in both the Incheon airport and the major department stores: Lotte, Shilla Hotel. There are other duty-free shops at Walkerhill Hotel, SKM DFS in COEX Mall.

Eat 

Much of Korean social life revolves around food and the city is packed with restaurants, so it would take a determined person to starve to death in Seoul. This fate may still befall you if you insist on English menus and meals consisting only of easily identifiable, familiar ingredients, so see for a quick Korean menu reader. An alternative is to just point and eat, your hosts generally will accommodate. If you look in the right places, a good meal (lunch or dinner) including side dishes can cost ₩5,000 or less (try basements of large department stores). 

 

In addition to Korean food, Japanese restaurants in Seoul tend to be excellent, featuring excellent sushi and sashimi. Chinese restaurants exist, but are typically adapted to suit local preferences. There are a few Italian restaurants; these are generally excellent, with chefs trained in Italy, although flavors tend to be more or less Koreanized, with sugar in the garlic bread and meatballs.

Big chains are common in South Korea as well, with so many cafes and bakeries. If you ever get a chance to visit Seoul, so many uniquely designed cafes are common there, so one would spend most of their time taking many pictures and eating delicious pastries and dishes.

These are some lists of the well-known chains in Seoul. Paris Baguette and Tous Les Jours are the two main cafes that are situated in some parts of the United States. 

*Paris Baguette: Very popular in Seoul. This cafe serves tasty and delicious pastries, birthday cakes, rice cake breads, shaved iced creams, coffee, tea, and smoothies. The atmosphere is settle and is a good place to gather with people or study. A small chain is located in the U.S in MA,Cambridge, which opened last year in 2014. This chain cafe already exists in New York City and California in Koreatown. This cafe is spreading across the United States, and is under more developments.

*Tours Les Jours: Also very popular in Seoul. This cafe also serves many pastries, cakes, shaved iced creams coffee, tea, smoothies, and rice cake breads. A small chain is located in the U.S in MA, Burlington inside H-Mart, a Korean Food Market as well as in New York City Koreatown.

*Caffe Bene: Very popular in Seoul. This cafe serves shaved ice cream in various flavors, coffee, tea, pastries and more. This cafe is also open in New York City in Koreatown and Boston, Massachusetts.

There are many other cafes which are also popular inside Seoul, which are not yet internationally developed across the United States. 

Cafes such as Dunkin Donuts, Krispy Kreme, and Starbucks are also diversely known. In Seoul, however, these cafes have much more options to choose from such as drink flavors to pastries that are not seen across the United States. 
Seoul has a variety of United States restaurants chain such as TGI Fridays, Baskin Robbins, McDonalds, KFC, and etc. All of these restaurants can be found in the City of Seoul at affordable prices. 

Budget
Seoul has plenty of budget places to eat. Everything from convenience store junk food and noodles to street stall food and lots of 24 hr Korean fast food restaurants. The 24-hour restaurants are great because they've usually got a wide variety of foods, including mandu, odeng, dokbokki, naengmyeon, udon and ramyeon. Prices do vary from about ₩2,000-9,000 at these restaurants. Also open late into the night are Korean BBQ restaurants, which are everywhere in Seoul. These can be very cheap and are usually of good quality. Barbecue options usually are limited to pork and beef, and they often come with a smattering of side dishes. Korean BBQ is, in itself, an experience that makes you feel like a Seoulite. The larger department stores in the city have basement food courts that offer excellent food (not recommended if you care about atmosphere). 

* Along with some Russian, Mongolian, and Central Asian restaurants (including the excellent and cheap Ala-Too Cafe, above a bakery). Wander around and discover the area a bit - you'll be rewarded with delicious food and an exotic experience.

* Justly famous for its manduguk, a soup of gargantuan homemade dumplings stuffed with meat and veggies and served with side dishes for ₩5,000. English menu available.

* Part of a vegan chain, this restaurant serves a mix of vegan Korean and international food, most dishes 6,000w - 10,000w. A soy cutlet is 10,000w and dumplings are 6,000w. It serves food, coffee and non-alcoholic drinks, and has a frozen food section where you can stock up on vegan essentials for home. The menu is in English and Korean and includes pictures. English is spoken by the friendly staff.

Mid-range 
* The only place in Seoul serving authentic greasy American food. Tons of food and drink. Open from 7am to 2am.

*For anyone familiar with Shake Shack, there are at least 13 Shake Shacks currently operating in Seoul.

* Nepali restaurant featuring dozens of delectable dishes ranging from mutton curry to butter naan. Bollywood music videos are free.

* This is a chain serving American-style fried chicken and chips, as well as draft beer. Set apart from the hundred of other chicken bars in the area thanks to a nice, hole-in-the-wall atmosphere and generous portions, not to mention the authenticity of the food.

* Offers a wide variety of burgers, arguably the best for the value, in Seoul. In an area often known as the foreigner ghetto, a popular area for expats to live just west of Itaewon.

* This Korean restaurant specializes in the Jeonju variety of bibimbap, which features different ingredients and spices than other bibimbap dishes. Delicious and healthy.

* Run by a Canadian-Indian owner, ₩15,000 gets you a a wonderful Indian meal. Try the chicken vindaloo, the garlic naan and the samosas.

* Thai restaurant, and perhaps the best in Seoul. With a menu featuring nearly 100 different items, you're bound to find your favorite dishes and make some new ones, too. 

*A French restaurant specialised in pastas, pork meat and Rosé wine. Come here to try the "Pied" with a glass of wine.

Jumbo patties are available for an additional ₩3/000. Burgers can be ordered with fries, coleslaw, and a drink for an additional ₩3,500.

Splurge

* Amazing food and drinks, specializing in sake. The atmosphere is lively with the occasional celebrity sighting. A definite hot spot any night of the week with an innovative menu of Japanese fusion.

* An excellent pizzeria close to the Walker Hill hotel in Gwangjin-gu. As its name implies, the restaurant has a lovely view of Seoul on top of a hill and prices higher than the hill it sits on. However, the pizza is well worth the price. Worth a visit if you hit it big at the nearby casino.

* This Italian bistro in Itaewon is a longtime favorite of foodies and gourmets, with high quality of Italian cuisine (and high prices to match).

Drink
: See for general guidance to nightlife in Korea.

Seoul features a mind-bogglingly large array of nightspots catering to every taste and budget, often being considered the best and most vibrant in the world. While most cities feature only a few areas for nightlife, Seoul features many such districts in staggering size and array of locations to choose from. Not only the sheer volume of bars and restaurants but also the relatively low cost of soju (the number one alcohol sold in the world) attributes to the lively nightlife atmosphere in the city. 

Note: Certain entertainment districts, such as Hongdae, are off-limits to American military personnel, U.S. government employees, contractors and their dependents.

Coffee
South Korea is the land of the coffee shops. It seems the amount of such places can easily compete with the number of convenience stores. Many Koreans dream of having their own coffee place, although with the oversupply of such places the profit is probably very low. There are many big coffee chains around, which you will see repeatedly. You should, however, opt for any one that is smaller and cosier.

*This is a very special place where the owners put a tremendous amount of time into preparing your Americano, Cappuccino or anything else they have on offer. They even roast their own beans using a gas flame and kind of a kids play washing machine. Opt for something with caramel and ask for a real cup. They of course also have WiFi. Exact location: 37°33'59.5"N 126°59'18.7"E

Itaewon
 is Seoul's international district, with a wide variety of Western-styled venues to eat, drink and be merry. Since many foreigners congregate there, Itaewon remains somewhat of a niche nightlife area for Koreans interested in a more international scene. A number of notable bars and clubs spot the area, both on the main street and in the nearby alleys, and the area has become more gentrified as more upscale restaurants and chains move in. Due to Itaewon's proximity to the nearby United States Army base, a large number of American military are found there in the evenings and weekends. However, the US army has decided to move the base to a location outside of Seoul within the next few years, so expect regular changes to the area.

Many bars in Itaewon celebrate Thursdays as Ladies' Night, which often means that women drink free before 12am. There are also a few gay bars located two alleys east of the main street, with a mix of clubs and places to drink. 

* Richard Copycat's All-American Diner, Recently moved locations. Tons of great food and drinks. Serves authentic Buffalo wings in Seoul. They also serve American breakfast.

* Geckos, (opposite Quiznos). A relaxed bar scene and good food. Very popular with GIs and expats. 

* Dillinger's. #in the alley behind Geckos across from Quiznos/Family Mart#. Serves draft and bottled beers and good food. Wednesday night is Wing Night, where 10 wings go for KRW4,000. Sports played on a number of big screens, plus more tables upstairs.

* Metro. A lot of older expats and many Koreans hit up this joint. Only one Korean beer on tap, but free pool. The front #or right side when you go up the stairs# seems to be for the expat crowd, while the back #the left door when you go up the stairs# seems to be more hof style for the Korean crowd. They have the typical range of snacks available and free peanuts for beer drinkers.

* Bless U is another older expat haunt. You better be good with your pool game or you'll be waiting in a long line to go again. Darts are also available. They have great popcorn and decent draft beers. It changed ownership last year and has been running a tight ship since.

* The Rose & Crown. pub with great fish and chips and interior decoration. Darts and sports on the big screen available.

* The Soul. Small basement bar across from the Bungalow that plays classic R&B and soul. The friendly DJ/owner is also a sound engineer, thus the sound system is better than most places in Seoul.

Gangnam
Gangnam station (강남) is the more upscale club area in Seoul. Also set up in a grid structure, clubs, bars, restaurants and other entertainment venues decorate this upmarket location. While not as upmarket as Apgujeong, it definitely is busy and lively. If Apgujeong is the place for rich kids to hang out and look cool, Gangnam is the place for those rich kids to party and look sexy. The station is a transit hub and a ton of buses run through the heart of the entertainment area, so finding your way there is extremely easy.

* Club 88 (클럽 더블에잇) Located near Sinsa Station.English & Foreigner Friendly. Seperate EDM and Hiphop sections. Bottle service starting at 700,000 KRW ($600). Cover charge of 20,000 KRW can be waived through guest list. English Friendly. English Manager
*Club Flex (클럽 플렉스) Located near Sinsa Station, Flex is the old Arena with a new name and "new' owner. Has two floors 1 more EDM and 1 for Hiphop. Overall it is popular because the crowd is young, attractive, and rich. Cover Charge of 20,000 KRW can be waived through guest list. 
 Club Flex Home Page

* Phillies. A Canadian-owned sports bar and grill with a pool table and darts in the basement. Beer prices are par and food is OK.

* Craftworks, Located across Haebangchon in the Gyeongnidan area. Find the NOXA bar and walk past it two or three stores down. No pool or darts, but their 8 craft brews are the best beers you'll find in Korea. Seriously.

* The Workshop. A South African-owned sports bar and grill. Plenty of TVs to watch sports on.

Sinchon
Sinchon (신촌), home to universities including Sogang University(서강대학교), Yonsei University (연세대학교) and Ewha Womans University, is a great place to soak up a more Korean environment. Not to be confused with Sincheon, which is closer to Jamshil, Sinchon is set up like many Korean entertainment areas in which bars, clubs, restaurants, karaoke boxes and sometimes even motels are structured in a grid-like fashion. The only way to familiarize yourself with the area is to stroll the alleys and discover all of the different places. Korean bars tend to be rather anti-social compared with their Western counterparts, with people sitting at tables with friends and not tending to mix. Yet a number of Western-style bars in the area have opened up.

* Woodstock. Around since 1991, the bar has prompted a slew of copycats but is the best place to hear classic rock and pop. The sound system is awesome and the owner/DJ knows his stuff. Expect large crowds Friday and Saturday nights and seeing people dance next to their tables. Great place to mix with Koreans of all ages.

* Nori Ha Nun Saram Dul. A basement bar infamous for both its great rock music and its decrepit interior with writing on the walls. Difficult to find and almost impossible to get a seat after 9 p.m. Secure valuables as theft is not uncommon in the bar.

* Beer O'Clock. This Canadian-run bar serves great pizzas and other grub in addition to showing sports on the big screen and offering darts. Weekends are pretty wild at this joint.

========

Hongdae (홍대), short for Hongik University, is the other premier club area in Seoul. Located around Hongik University, clubs and bars are strewn everywhere around the place. The clubs aren't near the station but aren't hard to find. 

Some good all-around bars are:

* Spill Out Fun spot out Hongdae exit 3 near many of the guesthouses. Good for solo travelers or clubbing pre-drinks. Only 15-20 seats or standing inside, but patio seating is good for warmer months. Run by Americans, good pizza, beer, bourbon, bar snacks, and shot-and-a-beer deals.

* B-Dan on Hongdae's main strip, offers up take-out draft beer by the plastic cup.

* Suzie Q an LP bar playing classic rock and pop, near the 7-11 around the clubs.

* Bricxx A hookah lounge with an intimate atmosphere and a large mixed drink and wine list.

Some of the most popular clubs are:

* M2 Trance/techno.

* Cocoon Hip-hop and dance music. Entrance: Thursday ₩10,000, Friday/Saturday ₩15,000-20,000.

* Psychedelic hippie hangout with psytrance Fri and Sat, 60s and 70s rock during the week. No cover charge.

* nb (noise basement) Hiphop.

* Q-Vo Hiphop.

* Club Saab Small Hip hop Club

* Joker Red Techno club

* Club Tool House Music club

* Club FF Rock music club that is popular with foreigners

* Harlem Hip hop club

* S Club hip hop club.

* Tin Pan (1,2,Euro) A clubs/bars with cheap drinks and a dance floor. You must have a non-armed forces identification to enter.

The place is huge and you could party for a whole week in all the bars and clubs. The best way to see it is to stroll around and find something you like. An interesting note: the entire club district of Hongdae is officially off-limits to U.S. military personnel, Federal employees and their dependents. However, it is not unusual to see crew-cuts here on the weekends since it is rarely enforced.

Near Hongdae Park is Joon's, a popular little venue with a variety of clientele. They have beer pong, darts, and their own DJs. 

Apgujeong
Apgujeong (압구정) is the upmarket area of Seoul. Walk around the streets and you'll see teenagers valet parking their new Benz or Audi, strutting their new designer threads, and looking generally, well, rich. That said, a lot of people who party here aren't necessarily rich and live far away. Apgujeong is rather subdued when it comes to nightlife though it has a few posh clubs and bars. Places where valet is unavailable are unlikely to be great hits traditionally. There are, however, a few small clubs in the area. Expect English to be more commonly spoken in this area, too, due many Koreans in the area having studied abroad or received a lot of private tutoring. This has also meant, however, a certain desensitization to foreigners, so don't expect people to stare or approach you as much as they would in other parts of Seoul. Consider Apgujeong a great place to hang out, not party. If you want to impress a date for example, this is a great place to go to. The backstreets of Apgujeong tend to sprout and lose new clubs seemingly at random throughout the year, so getting off the main drag from time to time can yield a new "hot club of the month."

* Superclub Circle usually playing house music, sometimes hip hop(only availible for private parties as of July, 2009)

* Club Air House/Techno club.

* Elec Small, trendy club that is quite difficult to find.

Dongdaemun (Imun-dong)
*Foreign-owned bar in front of Hankook University of Foreign Studies known for a varied clientele, great pool table, and affordable prices. Has Red Rock and Hoegaarden on tap.

Budget

Seoul's has two unofficial backpacker districts, Jongno (Anguk/Sinseol-dong) to the northeast of the city and Hongdae, Sinchon out to the west. Within walking distance to Dongdaemun Market, Jongno is better located for sightseeing and can be reached directly from Incheon Airport on limousine buses or city bus 6002 to Sinseol-dong stop (₩9,000, 90 min).
Hongdae, Sinchon area is located in university area. Yonsei Univ., Ehwa woman's Univ., Hongik Univ. and Sogang Univ. are around this area. so there are many restaurants, bar, club and shopping center and easy to be reached from Incheon Airport by limousine bus and Arex (Airport express train) in 1 hour.

Alternatively, try a . ₩4,000-15,000/night. You don't get a room of your own, but you can store your luggage into one of the small lockers and you can live quite cheaply for a long time, sleeping in the public sleeping rooms and enjoying the hot-tub and steam room facilities (sometimes a gym is available, also movies and TV shows often play until 11PM or so). To find a jjimjilbang keep an eye out for the the words jjimjilbang (찜질방) or 24 hr sauna (24시 사우나) in Korean. Not all saunas have jjimjilbang stay-over facilities to watch out for that. E.g. try Dragon Hill Spa at Yongsan station, ₩13,000/12h with overnight stay possible, but quite packed sometimes.

* Silloam Sauna, 10 min walk from Seoul Station. This is a very large jjimjilbang with great facilities, but the family atmosphere of other jjimjilbangs is sometimes lacking. The locker-room staff will stow oversized luggage if you ask, and a morning wake-up call can be arranged. Sleeping facilities are excellent, clean, comfortable and usually fairly quiet. There are two large dormitories for men and women, plus a snorers' room which sounds like a dragon's lair. The dormitories are arranged unconventionally into lines of bunk beds, more like an open capsule hotel than a standard sleeping floor. In the communal area there are various hot rooms, an ice room, a large gym, a PC room, singing and games rooms and a restaurant. The sauna area has 6 main pools with supposedly healthy minerals and showers. One night costs ₩12,000, which includes access to public baths, exercise facilities and various entertainment rooms.

Contact 

Internet cafes known as PC bang (PC 방) (pr: pee-shee-bang) are ubiquitous in Seoul, and usually cost anywhere from ₩800-2,000/hr. Most have printers at the front desk. These places cater chiefly to gamers, which translates into fairly fast computers, loud sound systems and large screens. Smoking is generally not allowed anymore. Typically, the computers run a Korean version of Windows Vista/7 and use Internet Explorer. 

You won't find free WiFi in many places, although larger cafes do offer it and most accommodation will provide you with some level of access. Another way to connect Wi-Fi is going through Wi-Fi password sharing application on smartphone. There are many applications such as Wifi Map, Wifi Master Key and Waple. If you are planning to travel in Seoul, Waple could provide most of Wi-Fi network because this application is from South Korea. There are more Wi-Fi password data than other applications. However, three major telecom companies have licensed airspace almost everywhere (including trains, both subway and regional). These three companies are Olleh, T Mobile and LG's U+. You can buy prepaid vouchers for WiFi access to any one of these networks from convenience stores and they also allow you to buy online using a credit card. If you feel you need to be connected a lot but don't want to use your carrier's data when roaming, this could be a good option.

The high-speed KTX trains offer free WiFi for passengers (30MB limit per session).

Console gaming (Xbox 360, PS3) is widely available, and for those with proficiency in Korean language, you might also be able to enjoy a round of online gaming; the fantasy MMORPG Lineage was created in Korea and a slew of MMORPG titles not available anywhere else can be found here.

Post offices are basically everywhere in Seoul, although many are hidden on smaller roads and alleys. If you cannot spot any post office nearby, it is good idea to visit university (every university has its own post office in it). Some post offices are open on Saturdays, Sundays and other holidays (postal service only). Most post offices sell boxes and packing materials. Even the smaller offices typically have at least one English-speaking member of staff.

* Also has a big philately section in basement.

Stay safe

Seoul is a remarkably safe city given its size, comparable in safety to Hong Kong or Tokyo. Pickpocketing is not very common and violent crime is minimal if not almost unheard of. 

If you happen to be a non-Korean male walking hand-in-hand with a Korean female, drunk older Korean men might give you a tongue lashing or occasionally worse. Note that this is far less of a problem than it used to be.

If you do end up in a fight, remember that Korean law is possibly different to your home country. Just because someone else started the fight does not provide you with legal protection if the attacker ends up hurt. As in anywhere else in the world, get out of such a situation as quickly as you can. 

U.S. military personnel now have a curfew 1am-5am 7 days a week on the Korean Peninsula, although the curfew can be extended at very short notice. If you are a westerner then the American Military Police may request to see your ID and, if you refuse, may summon the Korean National Police, who have the right to demand it. (This is done to catch American military personel breaking the curfews.)

Although rare, crimes by American soldiers against Koreans can happen, and when they do they often receive a huge amount of national attention. If you are a westerner then you should exercise some extra care when such a case hits the media, although it is still highly unlikely you would be in any danger.

Large scale demonstrations in Seoul against the government happen from time to time. Often they can result in a riot where there are pitched battles between protesters and riot police. People do get seriously hurt, so try and avoid getting too close to the action.

Cope
Language issues

Over the last 15-20 years Korea has undergone a major English language boom. Korean families are eager for their children to learn English and commonly place them in private language schools. English is also a compulsory subject in public school from elementary grades on. Nowadays, a large number of high school aged to young adult Koreans on the street will have at least a rudimentary grasp of English.

However, note with caution that the majority of Koreans will speak little English if not none at all, particularly the older generations. A few tourist information centers dotted around Seoul are staffed by English speakers, but by and large the average service provider will not speak English. 

English signage is visible everywhere in the city, from road signs to subway maps to shop posters.

* Provides foreign language assistance with regard to public services, but also beyond including help with awkward coping necessities like purchasing a mobile phone.

* A local concierge service people can message for help. Atlas is a real-time travel assistant with local expertise used often by travelers and expats that need help with anything around Korea. On demand interpretation and personalized services: booking travel, placing food delivery orders, reserving restaurants, recommending activities, etc.

Medical
Pharmacies are everywhere in Seoul. While most are labeled only in Korean, the signage and Hangul character is easy to recognize: 약. Most pharmacists speak some English. Pharmacists are not shy about asking about your symptoms and selling you what they think you need.

* Seoul provides an English-language hotline to assist with finding doctors and other medical services.

Medical bills can be expensive, but not too, so make sure you have valid .

Some people with sensitive stomachs should use caution when dining in Korea as some of the local cuisine is heavily spiced with copious amounts of pepper and garlic.

Air Quality

Air quality in Seoul has improved significantly. However, there is pollution coming from China, Korean industries and the growing number of motor vehicles on the road. When approaching metro Seoul via train a visible dome of smog exists. Asthmatics frequently have acute problems, especially in the low-lying areas of town. Pharmacies carry a variety of allergy and smog masks, both of which are a common sight outdoors. If you are sensitive to such things, you may want to avoid visiting in spring and summer.

Mold is common during the hotter months and the rainy season. While most common nearest rivers and streams, mildew and mold are also at many subway stations. 

Mongolian yellow dust storms in spring have always been considered dangerous, but more so in recent years, as these storms blow across China's industrial belt, picking up toxins, before sweeping across the Korean Peninsula. Efforts to mitigate these storms include a donation of several thousand trees from South Korea to China. When dust storms come through Seoul, residents usually wear mask specifically for such dust and try to stay inside. Some locals refuse to travel these storms occur.

Embassies and Consulates

The Korean Peninsula is the political hotspot of Northeast Asia, hence, a large number of embassies are located in Seoul.

Other
Mostly, Koreans are very curious about foreigners. Many will gawk and glare while others will try out their English. For the most part, Koreans are very friendly on the street and will take great pains to be helpful, even approach you on their own initiative, if you seem to need help, despite the above attitudes. 

If working in Korea, one should do a little reading on Confucianism and how it translates into social standing.

Get out

* &mdash; Many tour companies offer DMZ tours which is a day trip from Seoul, the highlight of which is a village lying in the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea. Note that you cannot visit without booking with a tour company, and that some nationalities (including South Korean and Chinese) are not allowed to visit for security reasons.

* &mdash; Beaches, hot springs and fresh sea breezes.

* &mdash; The place where U.S. Gen. Douglas MacArthur landed during the Korean War; it also has the biggest and oldest Chinatown in Korea.

* &mdash; Popular weekend getaway, east of Seoul. A small town in the mountains of Gyeonggi-do, on the border with Gangwon-do.

* &mdash; Filmed in many Korean dramas and movies and now accessible by subway from Seoul

* &mdash; One of Seoul's satellite cities, located 30 kilometers south of Seoul, the city is best-known as the home of Hwaseong Fortress (화성), a UNESCO world heritage site. Built from 1794 to 1796, the fortress consists of four main gates and a 5.76 kilometer-long wall, and features an archery range and other activities. Suwon is also famous for its local football club Suwon Samsung Bluewings as well as galbi with numerous restaurants serving the dish. And you could also go to " Folk village " from there. Suwon has several stops on Seoul Subway Line 1 and is about an hour away from Seoul Station. Several commuter trains travel from Seoul Station to Suwon Station each day, with the trip taking about 30 minutes.

* Take the KTX down to Busan to enjoy the beach in summer. Makes a nice change of pace from Seoul.
