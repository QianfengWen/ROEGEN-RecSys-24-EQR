Obihiro () is a city on the northern island of , It is the capital of sub-prefecture on the Tokachi Plain, a major agricultural area. 

Understand

Founded by settlers from Honshu in 1883, and designated as a city in 1933, Obihiro is architecturally undistinguished except for a few kitsch pachinko (pin ball) palaces. To the visitor it appears a city of car dealers and cake shops.

Arranged on a regular north south grid, most of the city lies in the south western quadrant. Two main features lie diagonal to the grid: the railway line with the main JR station and Midorigaoka Park, a green hill where some of the cities main attractions (the museum, zoo etc.) are located. 

Most Japanese visitors from the south are attracted to the dairy farms of the Tokachi Plain, however foreign visitors already familiar with cows and wheat fields may be more interested in the high volcanic peaks of with its extraordinary alpine flora, or the wildlife in . For these major attractions Obihiro is a gateway, conveniently bypassing and western Hokkaido.

Get around
The center of Obihiro, located between JR Obihiro Station and Fujimaru Department Store, is small and walkable, though most of the larger shopping areas are outside of this. The city as a whole is large and spread out, though easy to navigate. Similar to Sapporo, it is laid out on a grid, and intersections are signed in both Japanese and English (e.g., West 1 South 10). The north-south axis (which lies close to the city center) is called Ōdōri.

City buses exist, though services are less frequent than on the more densely populated island of Honshu. 

By car
A car is ideal, since the main attractions are outside the city. There are some rental car companies at the airport.

See
* Obihiro has a unique type of draught horse racing called Banei (ばんえい) . The horses drag steel 'sleighs', each weighing around 500 kilograms, along a 200 metre sand track with two humps in the middle of the course. The sport originated in a test of strength for farm animals. Most of the horses are a crossbreed of French Percherons and Bretons and Belgian horses. The 'jockeys' lash the horses repeatedly with the reins - animal lovers be warned!
