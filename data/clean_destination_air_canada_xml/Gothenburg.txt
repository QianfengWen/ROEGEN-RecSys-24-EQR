Gothenburg (Swedish: Göteborg, pronounced "Yeutebory") is the second largest city in with approximately 600,000 inhabitants (2019). It is situated on Sweden's west coast at the outlet of the Göta river. With over 40,000 students Gothenburg University is the largest in Scandinavia. Gothenburg has a reputation of being a friendly place, even more welcoming than the Swedish capital. 

Understand
With neighboring provinces Halland and Bohuslän under Danish rule, the Göta River used to be Sweden's only western port, since the 14th century guarded by a fort named Älvsborg.

The city of Gothenburg was founded in 1621 by King Gustav II Adolf, during the height of the Swedish Empire. It was once the center of the Swedish ship-building industry, but with rising competition from foreign ship yards, many of the dry docks closed down during the late 20th century. Much of the inner harbor area has changed from industrial ship building to high technology and education, representative of the general change in the city. Today Gothenburg has both international sporting events, concerts, and conventions as well as a small town feel.

An industrial town, Gothenburg has been a stronghold of the Social Democratic Party.

People
The working-class history is easily visible, for example in the harbour area. Traditionally there were few fashion houses or posh cafeterias, but that has changed in recent years with the reconstruction of the indoor malls in the city centre and with the opening of quite a number of American-style coffee shops. In the city centre, where the university is located, there are many students. 
 
The intonation (which is however neither a dialect nor an accent) of the Gothenburgers is, for other Swedes, associated with cheerfulness and witty humour.

Tourist information
There are two tourist information offices in central Gothenburg - one in the Nordstan shopping center (next to the central train station) and one on Kungsportsplatsen about ten minutes walk from Nordstan. Gothenburg's official tourist website is another source of information. They offer the Gothenburg City Pass which allows entry into many tourist attractions, grand houses, museums as well as offering free travel on trams and buses and free parking. Recently, this pass was made available to people's mobile phones making it not only the most cost effective means of sight seeing but also the most convenient.

In case official tourist information is unavailable, Gothenburgers are usually more than willing to help.

Get in
By plane
Landvetter Airport () is Gothenburg's main airport, located 25 km east of the city. About 30 airlines fly to Landvetter e.g. SAS Lufthansa KLM and Finnair 

There is a Flygbussarna bus service into the city which runs every 15-20 minutes, costs 99 SEK one way (198 SEK return, no price advantage here) if bought online (otherwise 20 SEK extra), and the journey takes 30 minutes. It stops at several locations (first stop near Liseberg; final stop: the Nils Ericson Bus terminal where the Central Train Station is). The ticket from the airport to the city includes a 90 minutes local transportation fare within the limits of Gothenburg. However, you have to ask for this ticket from the bus driver (as of January 2020)!
 
Gothenburg City Airport () previously known as Säve Airport closed in November 2014 and it was revealed in January 2015 that it will not re-open. The airlines that used Gothenburg City Airport (eg Ryanair and Wizz-Air) have now moved to Landvetter airport.

By train

Centralstationen (tram Centralstationen/Drottningtorget) is the main rail station in Gothenburg. From , there are hourly Öresundståg trains which take 3 hours 50 minutes and cost 447 SEK (267 SEK for people below 20); the train also stops at Copenhagen Airport. You can often save half an hour by changing at Malmö from the Öresundståg to the SJ high-speed train to Göteborg; however, the high-speed train needs to be booked in advance (which can be done together with the Öresundståg) and only run every 2-3 hours so check out this site first in advance High-speed trains connect with in about three hours. Finally, Vy trains run from Oslo in Norway to Göteborg in 3 hours 40 minutes.

A daily night train connects with the northern Swedish cities of and .

Also, a new private luxury train named Blå Tåget travels the route Gothenburg-Stockholm-Uppsala daily except Fridays. Journey times are longer than SJ fast-trains but the train boasts generous seating, free WiFi (which, however, is also present on SJ:s high-speed trains) and includes an onboard restaurant.

By car
The roads E6, E20 and E45 pass through Gothenburg. If you come by car from , you should take E4 to , and then national road 40. 

Approximate distances & travelling time:
* to (E6/E20 south): 300 km, 3 hrs
* to (E6 north): 320 km, 4 hrs
* to (40 east, E4): 500 km, 5 to 6 hrs
* to (E6/E20 south): 317 km, 3.5 hrs

Be aware that parking in Gothenburg can be difficult and expensive, as free parking is rarely found. Prices per hour vary between 7 different zones and can be as high as 30 SEK per hour. Free parking on some areas is included in the Gothenburg pass if you happen to own one. However, there is no guarantee that you will find a free spot. In any case, expect to spend some time looking for a spot, and expect to be forced to walk quite some distance. The closer you are to the city centre the more this is true. You can use Parkopedia to find closest or cheapest parking to your destination.

Since January 2013 there is a congestion charge (Trängelseskatt) inside the city for all cars with Swedish number plates, which means that you have to pay 8, 13 or 18 SEK each time you pass one of the borders, depending on the time Your number plate will be recognized by cameras above you. You don't pay between 18:30 and 5:59 and on Saturdays and Sundays.

Also remember that getting around by car is very difficult in the city, and often slower than public transport. Inner Gothenburg is a maze of one-way streets, junctions were you can only turn in certain directions and blocked roads. Bigger junctions can be very chaotic and hard to navigate. Often it is not very clear whether you are actually allowed to enter a street by car or not, especially the inner-city area around Nordstan, Brunnsparken and Korsvägen (Svenska Mässan/Liseberg) is very chaotic. Expect to be stuck between two trams and to wonder whether you are allowed to be there or not.
One-way streets and blocked roads mean you often have to deviate from the direct way - the way you walk is not the way to drive! If you do not know the city very well, driving without a GPS can be very stressful. The vast majority of parking meters accept credit and debit cards (that is, if you can find a parking spot to begin with). If you park without a valid permit, too close to a junction or otherwise not fully compliant with regulations you will be fined, and fines start around 800 SEK.

Some words of caution:
*Sweden has a general right-before-left rule. That means if there is no stop/yield sign or traffic light, a vehicle coming to a junction has the right of way over all vehicles from the left, and has to yield to all vehicles coming from the right. However, the right hand rule is very often not respected in Gothenburg! If you are on a smaller road than the vehicle that is supposed to yield, they will likely not stop for you. There are also many exceptions to the rule, such as on a "huvudled" (priority road) marked by signs with a yellow diamond with a black and white border. Make sure to read up on swedish driving regulations beforehand.
*There are trams in Gothenburg, and they are not very keen to yield for anything else. They may be coming from behind and turning in front of you, so watch out whenever you are near their tracks. You might find yourself in an intersection on the tram tracks while waiting for a pedestrian to cross.
*In Gothenburg, like in the rest of Sweden, Zebra crossings for pedestrians really mean you have to stop for anyone crossing the road. Pedestrians and cyclists will expect you to yield, and the latter often come at very high speeds. It is common for people to cross in the middle of the road, but they will usually be careful when doing so.
*Especially in the dark, watch out for the numerous speed bumps. Some of them are quite violent. Expect them at every pedestrian crossing. They are also indicated by small signs on each side of the road - watch out for these in the dark.

By bus
Several coach services operate in and out of Gothenburg including Eurolines Säfflebussen GoByBus Bus4you and Swebus Express Nils Ericsson Terminalen, located in connection with the central station, is the most common bus stop.

By ship
Stena Line operates ships to/from Denmark () and Germany ().
The terminals are situated near the city centre. Tramway stops: Masthuggstorget (Frederikshavn), Chapmans Torg (Kiel).

DFDS Torline is a cargo line with limited passenger capacity. They can take a small number of passengers (and their car) to Gothenburg from Belgium () and United Kingdom (). The Gothenburg - Tilbury (Essex) route ceased to operate on 30 October 2014.

Get around
Public transportation within Gothenburg (and the west of Sweden) is operated by Västtrafik and consists of trams, buses, ferries and commuter trains. You can find more information about tickets and a journey planner on their homepage.

Public transport in Gothenburg can be very slow: For example, to cross one side of the city to the other can take up to an hour (to cross 10km). However, inside the central area, transport is fairly rapid.

The local transport company (Västtrafik) have removed maps from just about all tram stops, be prepared, have a map ready before you get here. If you own a smartphone, downloading Västtrafiks app "Reseplaneraren", will help greatly. With it you can just type in the adress or tram/bus stop that you want to go to, and it will suggest the best route. If completely lost, you can also use the "nuvarande position" (current position) feature, to get you back on track. The app is in swedish, but the journey planner on the website is available in english as well.

Västtrafik's ticket system
Since 1 December 2009 you cannot buy tickets from the driver on any buses or trams in the Västtrafik system. 
From February 2013 you have to sign up for SMS tickets before you buy them. Register here. 
(All prices actualized March 2013)

:1, 3 or 30 day ticket
Tourists and others planning to travel everyday are advised to buy a 1, 3 or 30 day ticket. A blue card called the Västtrafik card is charged with ticket information. They are bought at Västtrafik's service centres or from seven-eleven or Pressbyrån or some other stores. They cost 80 kr (1 day), 160 kr (3 days) and 505 kr (30 days) inside Gothenburg. They can also be bought from the Västtrafik-app. One can also buy a tourist card from the tourist office which is valid as a tram/bus ticket and for museum entrance fees etc. More info on tourist tickets.

:Single ticket
If you only travel occasionally, you can either buy tickets at the Västtrafik-app, 7-eleven, the Västtrafik "Tidpunkten" customer service centers, the Pressbyrån shops, from the blue ticket machines on the trams - which accepts coins or major credit cards, or via sms if you have a Swedish mobile phone account. During daytime the cost is 24 SEK for an adult within the city zone. During night time you usually pay double the normal price.

:Prepaid card
If you will be travelling more often it might be a good idea to buy a prepaid västtrafik card that also gives a discount. This card can be charged with any amount at a time until the card contains a maximum of 1500 SEK. In addition you must pay a 50 SEK deposit which can be used in part to pay for your trip, but if any of the deposit money is used, another trip cannot be made until you recharge the card again. If you return the card to a Västtrafik service center the deposit will be refunded to you.

If you travel within one zone a fixed price is deducted from your card, which is SEK 18.60 for an adult within the Gothenburg zone. If you travel across a zone border the journey will be more expensive. With the exception of the southern part of tram no. 4 (all stops from Krokslätts Torg to Mölndals Centrum) the entire tram system lies within the Göteborg municipality.

The card is used by holding it to one of the card readers in the vehicle when you board. If you intend to travel in more than one zone you must press the + button on the card reader before showing it. When you leave the vehicle show it again to the reader (otherwise, you will be charged for a journey to the terminal destination of the bus/tram). If you are not sure if you cross a zone, you can always press + before and check out afterwards as the system will then always deduct the correct amount and you will not have to bother about the zones.

The Västtrafik card can be bought from Västtrafik's service centres or from most convenience stores.

You can change freely between buses, ferries and trams 90 minutes after you first used your ticket. If you traveled in more than one zone the 90 minutes time will count from the time you disembarked in the last zone. When travelling between zones, remember to always check in and touch out on each separate vehicle - otherwise you will be charged for each as separate journeys.

One should know that it might seem easy to get on one of the buses or trams without a valid ticket, but if a biljettkontrollant (ticket controller) would find out, you will be charged with a fee of 1200 SEK.

* Gothenburg public transport network map: map of tram and trunk bus lines map of "Express" buses and commuter trains

By tram
Gothenburg has a famous network of trams that covers most of the city. With over 150 km the Gothenburg tram is the largest light rail network in Scandinavia. 
The network consists of 12 tram lines, 1 to 11 and 13, and every line except no 8 and 13 passes through the main tram stop Brunnsparken ('Well Park'). It is located one tram stop or a 2 minute walk from the train station, Centralstationen. The trams runs approximately every 8-10 minutes during daylight and twice every hour at night, at weekends the trams run every 15-30 minutes. Notice that not all lines runs nighttime.
This and the boats Paddan (operating from Kungsportsplatsen) is the best way to see the city as they run above ground at a comfortable yet quick pace.
* Gothenburg tram and Stombuss network map 

By bus
Tram and stombuss (trunk bus lines) are the most efficient way to travel within the city centre, but if you're planning to go further you might need to go by bus. Bus lines heading in the same direction often departs from the same part of the city. No real equivalent thing to the tram stop Brunnsparken exists - they are divided into several "smaller" hubs, which you often reach by tram.
There are several express bus lines leaving the city and connecting to the far outskirts and cities and towns around Gothenburg. Other than the inner-city buses these have comfortable seats, are usually clean and travel quickly.

By ferry
Two ferry services run across the river; Älvsnabben is the regular ferry service with traffic every thirty minutes, and Älvsnabbare that only run between Rosenlund and Lindholmspiren (free of charge) during work hours. Besides transport, this can be a good way to see the city from the river.

Ferries to the southern archipelago run from Saltholmen, with three different lines: Vrångö line, Brännö Rödsten line and the less trafficated Förö line. The service runs once an hour or less.

Styrsöbolaget run the ferry services under licence of Västtrafik - you can still use the city public transport ticket. On their homepage can you find time tables and more information about the islands.

By taxi
There are several taxi companies, for example Taxi Göteborg (031-650000), Taxi Kurir (031-272727) and Minitaxi (031-140140).
Taxi fares in Gothenburg are not regulated and are therefore very expensive. Initial fare from 35 SEK, and then from 10 to 14 SEK/km, plus a by-the-minute charge. Every taxi must have comparing prices well visible according to law, example: and it's often placed in the window. No 1 is daytime, no 2 is rush hour and no 3 is for night time service, and then you see the initial fare, price per hour, price per kilometre and comparing prices for a typical journey.
The lowest comparing price (the one printed big and in bold letters on the window sign) that you can expect is around 300 SEK for regular taxis, around 260 SEK for the Minitaxi cabs (recognisable by their wine-red paint job).
While the comparison prices are for a 10km journey taking 15 minutes, expect real-live prices to be much higher: a 4km trip in the city could easily cost you 200 SEK.
Taxis in Gothenburg are generally clean, safe and have helpful drivers.

However, illegal taxis, called "svarttaxi", are also operating, particularly during Friday and Saturday nights. They are recognized by the anonymous paint jobs and the lack of a meter. They are generally cheaper, but using them is not advised, particularly for women or drunk passengers, since muggings and rapes have occurred involving illegal taxis.

By bicycle
Gothenburg has a nice network of bicycle paths, reaching all parts of the city. You can buy network maps at the tourist information centres, and you can find an online version below. 

You can bring your bike on the ferries, on some trains but not on trams or buses. The service is free on Älvsnabben but cost 10 SEK on the ferries in the southern archipelago. 

You can rent a bike from Cykelkungen or if you are staying at a hostel they can often provide it for you. 

In the most central parts there are an automated loan bike system by reserving an amount on your credit card they are free to use. The bikes are supposed to be used for only 30 minutes and then replaced in another place.

* Bicycle network map Väst - West, Öst - East

By foot
With a compact city centre most sights are easily reached by foot, and it's a nice way to get around. 

Popular walks around the city includes the nature reserve around the lake Delsjön, the park Slottskogen, the botanical garden, on any of the islands in the southern archipelago, or in the neighborhood Haga.

Stay safe
Most crimes against tourists are crimes of opportunity, such as pick-pocketing, bicycle theft, auto theft and auto vandalism. As always, do not leave valuable items in your car or in a cloakroom, and watch your bag in crowded places. Most shops and all major taxi companies accept credit and debit cards, so there is no need to carry a lot of cash. 
Downtown Gothenburg is plagued by illegal taxis by night, and they are considered very unsafe, especially for women. Generally speaking, crime rates in Gothenburg are quite low from an international perspective.

The northern parts of the city (Angered, Hammarkullen, Kortedala, Bergsjön) as well as the outskirts of Hisingen are notorious for high crime-rates.

As of October 2019 there have lately been an extensive amount of robberies taking place all over Gothenburg. Pay attention to your surroundings if you are walking alone at night. If you get robbed, do not try to fight them as the situation might escalate to worse. Just give them what they want, and then call the police at 112 (emergency) or 114 14 (non-emergency).

Get out
* Near Gothenburg is the beautiful southern archipelago. There's a resident population on most islands, so ferries run all year. Private cars are not allowed. Take tram 11 (or 9 in summer) to Saltholmen, and then one of the ferries to Styrsö, Köpstadsö or any of the other islands. Here you can swim in the ocean, buy ice cream and maybe eat at the restaurants on Brännö, Styrsö or Vrångö. Be warned that the tram is packed with people on sunny summer days, especially when the 9 doesn't run, and going by car isn't better since you are unlikely to find a parking place. The ferries, however, usually make extra tours such days. An alternative is to take the direct ferry from Stenpiren in the city at 10:50am which stops at Saltholmen, Styrsö, Donsö and Vrångö. The direct ferry leaves Vrångö at 3:35pm on weekdays and a little later on weekends. It takes 1 hour and 35 minutes. The direct ferry only operates during the Summer season (approx. June 20 - August 20). Styrsöbolaget provides a brochure with more information about the islands.

* Älvsborgs fortress (Älvsborgs fästning) from the 17th century was built on an island to protect the city from being attacked from the sea. Tourist boats make the trip regularly during summer.

* Vinga - the last outpost before the sea and the place where Evert Taube (a famous Swedish poet) grew up.

* Gunnebo House and Gardens , in the neighbouring municipality of Mölndal, is a 18th century wooden mansion built in the neo-classical style with well-preserved interiors set in a Baroque park. There is a restaurant with organic lunch, a gift shop, guided tours and annual markets in the autumn and at Christmas. 

* Tjolöholm Castle, in Kungsbacka municipality south of Gothenburg, is an anachronistic Tudor castle built in the years around 1900 for the Scottish-Swedish merchant and factory owning family Dickson, one of Gothenburg's many generous donors (they founded Gothenburg's first public library and built decent homes for the families of their factory staff).
