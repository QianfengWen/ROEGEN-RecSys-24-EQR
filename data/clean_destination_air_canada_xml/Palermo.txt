Palermo is the capital of the main island of , located on the north coast of the island.

 Understand 
The capital of Sicily was founded by Phoenicians under the name of "Ziz" (which means "flower", but the meaning is still uncertain) and later renamed by Greeks "Panormos", which means "all port". It reached its golden age during the Arab domination (9th to 11th centuries AD), when it became one of the most prosperous cities in the Mediterranean and Europe, known as "city of delights" for its marvelous and lavish gardens, as well as for magnificent mosques and palaces.

After being conquered by the Normans (1060-1080 AD), most of palaces and mosques were destroyed, but the new rulers exploited the cosmopolitan environment of Palermo and the artists, architects and masters from different cultural roots giving the birth to a unique architectural style, the so-called "Arab-Norman Style of Sicily", which is an original mixture of arabesque decorations, Romanesque architecture and Byzantine mosaics.

After being home to one of the most famous emperors of the Middle Ages, Frederik II of Swabia, named "Stupor Mundi" by contemporaries, Palermo began its decadence under the influence of several dominations In the mid-19th century, Palermo was one the leading revolutionary cities in Italy, strongly contributing to the success of the "Mille" (literally "one thousand"), a patriots' expedition lead by the famous Italian national hero Giuseppe Garibaldi which ended with the reunification of Italy under the Savoy dynasty from Turin (1860).

Nowadays, Palermo faces several problems affecting its economic development, mainly because of the presence of the very powerful criminal organization known worldwide as "Mafia" or "Cosa Nostra". The city's economy is based on local government institutions, port, shipbuilding industry and the mechanical industry. It is also seat to some important Sicilian wine making companies (like Tasca d'Almerita, Duca di Salaparuta, Corvo, Planeta, etc.) whose popularity in the world is growing.

Climate
Palermo has a typical Mediterranean climate. Palermo's winters are amongst the warmest in Italy and in Europe, with night lows being around 10°C (50°F) and day highs often reaching 20°C (68°F) or more. That's why Palermo attracts tourists as a year-round destination, appealing to people seeking to escape from the cold weather in other European countries and also northern Italy. Temperatures around 5°C (42°F) are very rare, and in most areas of the city the temperature has never gone below 0°C (32°F). Snow is virtually unheard of, although an exceptional snowfall occurred on New Year's Eve in 2014. Throughout most of the year, precipitation is scarce and mostly falls in the winter. 

Spring and autumn are both very pleasant seasons to visit, characterized by warm temperatures and abundant sunshine. Autumn is warmer than spring, with summer-like conditions persisting well into November.

Summers, on the other hand, aren't as hot as most Italian cities, even in northern Italy. However, when heat waves hit, the mercury can rise in the mid 40s' (well over 104°F) and bring very extreme heat even at night. The record high is 46°C (115°F). Summer is also the driest part of the year and rain is extremely rare.

Stay safe

Beware of and motorcycle-riding snatch thieves targeting handbags, wallets and mobile phones.

Women should not walk alone at night in the historical centre of Palermo and travelers could be wary of La Kalsa, the neighborhood between Via Roma and the water, at night. The area is being renewed and gentrified, but is probably still one of the riskier places to be at night.

Vehicle theft is a major problem in Palermo, so the use of private, secure car parks is to be preferred.

Avoid going outside the city center, except for Mondello (beach and clubs), Sferracavallo (great restaurants), Monreale.
