Datong is a city in , .

Understand
Datong is a small city with little experience with foreigners. People here are friendly and curious, and will definitely stare at foreigners. For simple entertainment, stop at a chuanr (meat on a stick) stand near Red Flag square, or Red Flag square itself and chat up the locals.

Datong itself doesn't contain much to do, with many 'historical' sites currently under construction, but makes for an excellent base for visits to the surrounding attractions. As of Summer 2016 the city is still covered in building sites, especially inside the recently constructed city wall.

Get in

By bus
* - 4.5hr. Buses depart every hour from the Liuliqiao Passenger Transport Hub (Liuliqiao Long Distance Bus Station 六里桥客运主枢纽) in the south-west of the city. To get there, take exits C or D from Luiliqiao Subway station (六里桥), which is on subway lines 9 & 10. Tickets are bought in the Transport Hub ticket office, at a cost of cost ¥133, and buses usually depart from gates 4 or 6. The journey is on very good roads, and includes a 20 minute comfort break about half-way as there are no toilets on the bus.

* - Buses depart from Hohhot's bus station (next to the train station) regularly all day. Just turning up and buying a ticket should usually get you on a bus within an hour, two at most. The journey takes about 5 hours with average traffic conditions, costing c57. The buses terminate at Datong main bus station (a short taxi ride from the train station).

* - Three buses a day in summer from Wutai Mountain from 8am to 1pm.

Get around

 
By Bus

* Bus 4 - runs from the train station into town (6th stop (四牌楼）for 9 Dragon wall, 7th stop (清远街, bus sign “青年宫”) for Huāyuàn Monastery and Youth Hostel , 8th stop (红旗广场）for Red Flag square. The final stop on bus line 4 is the start of bus line 3.
* Bus 3 - runs from the Xinkaili bus station (final stop of bus 4) to the Yungang Caves (end of the line).
* Bus 15 - runs from train station to near the main bus station (the fifth stop from train station 市供排水集团 shìgōng páishuǐ jítuán, from that bus stop walk ahead to crossroads, turn left and main bus station 大同汽车站 is just ahead on left. ) 
* Bus 30 - runs from the train station all the way to the south bus station (新南客运站), the last stop (45+ mins).

Buses within Datong are ¥1. Trips to the Yungang Caves are ¥1.5.

By taxi
* Fares start at 7rmb and then increase in 1.6 increments. You can get around everywhere in the city itself for less than 10rmb, taxi drivers will happily take you further afield.

* It may be convenient and less stressful to hire a taxi to visit the main sites out of town. A trip to the Hanging Monastery and Wooden Pagoda (both out of town - this is about 5 hours travel time) for 2 people cost for ¥400 in June 2016, with the driver waiting for us at each site. It is possible to do this for cheaper but for convenience and speed (plus stops to stretch legs at interesting places such as cave houses and dragon screens en route). If you find a good driver it is worth arranging for them to take you on your other trips as this can save time and money arranging something else.

You can try to find a taxi yourself (eg in front of the train station in the morning there may be taxi drivers seeking this business) or ask at China International Travel Service (CITS, +86 0352 5101816, +86 13008088454). If asking via CITS, do not forget to ask for a new taxi or you may end up in an old car which is not safe for a trip out of town. Local hostels and tours may have shuttle services starting at ¥300 for the Hanging Monastery and Yungang Grottoes, and others for higher prices.

See

* By far the greatest attraction of the area is the 1,500-year-old Yúngāng Grottoes, a . These mountain-side caves and recesses are filled with 51,000 Buddhist statues - the largest being a 56-foot Seated Buddha while the smallest is only a few centimetres tall. In addition to the carvings of the Buddha, there are also scenes depicting Buddhist teachings and famous monks. Unlike Dunhuang grottoes, most caves here permit photography, (notably excepting caves 5&6). The entrances to caves 5 and 6 are fronted by wooden temple structures. The cave walls at these entrances were damaged by graffiti during the cultural revolution although the majority of the site is well-preserved. At least you get the impression that the caves are mostly ancient/original and not reconstructed. Cave 20 may have people praying in front.

* Lodged precariously on a cliff-face, this monastery is one of the more remarkable sights in China: a complex of 40 rooms linked by mid-air walkways. It appears to be stuck into the side of the cliff, but is actually supported by stilts. There is a '3 Religions Hall' with all of Buddha, Confucius and Laozi (founder of Daoism). Built in 490, renovated several times, most recently in 1900, much of the current structure dates from the Ming and Qing Dynasties. Less than an hour to visit. Once finished you can either take the taxi back (25 to 30 yuan per person) to the bus station (浑源站) or walk there (not close but possible), tasty vegetarian food available at stall. From this bus station you can also travel directly to 五台山

* This impressive pagoda is the oldest and tallest wooden structure in China, built in 1056 in the Liao Dynasty. It is located within a Buddhist temple, some of which was rebuilt in the Qing Dynasty. There is an active temple in the back built in 2001. Only the ground floor and the first floor of the pagoda are open to visitors. Maybe half an hour needed to visit. For an additional ¥40 you can visit a small exhibition on the premises. Can see the pagoda from outside the complex and it is not necessarily worth going in but it is well worth a stop on the way to the hanging monastery.

* A small collection of Daoist temples and a peaceful courtyard. A more human scale than the nearby Huáyán Monastery - half an hour at most - unless you are intercepted by a Daoist monk and have a chat / are given an explanation. Completely rebuilt in 2010.

* A large collection of Buddhist temples of the Huayan sect that can be seen in an hour or two. Unusually this monastery faces east, not south. Nice to hear chanting at the back (no photos). Completely rebuilt in 2010. Well worth a trip as it is a beautiful and very serene Temple Complex. Take a trip up one of the towers for a surprising and contrasting view of the monastery, nearby derelict sites, a church and the emerging 'old' city.

* A 600-year-old screen made of glazed tiles and depicting nine dragons, this is the oldest glazed screen in China. Most people will visit this for less than 5 minutes. It is a pity that the pond in front of the screen is no longer filled with water. 

* Like many cities in China, Datong has its own Drum Tower. This is in the centre of town, but not open to the public.

* This is the least religiously important of the 5 Sacred Mountains of Taoism. Due to its northerly location, it has been impossible for pilgrimages by the Chinese to take place for much of its history. 

*The museum covers an area of 5600 square meters, of which 1,800 square meters exhibition area, has now become the second largest museum in Shanxi Province, 1.3 million pieces of cultural relics, a product 132. Most of the local archaeological finds. Meet the public more than pieces of precious relics in 1000, half of the initial display of rare collections. 

* 
A beautiful and newly constructed park surrounds the city wall and is well worth a walk through. The city wall itself is still under construction, it is a modern reconstruction and is by no means an ancient monument. It does, however, look very beautiful at night.

* 
Xiping is a smaller town than Datong about an hour away, there are a field of inactive volcanoes about 4 km east of the town and are a good place to go hiking if you feel up for it. Catch a bus to Xiping (¥5)from slightly up the road east of the Dong Guan Bus Station (Bus to Hanging Temple), not sure why this bus no longer leaves from Dong Guan Bus Station but learn the characters for Xiping and you will see it. Get off in Xiping and walk an hour east and you will see the field of volcanoes (rolling green hills). Its a long day of walking but a good chance to get outside and no entry fees means its a relatively cheap day. Could hire a driver also to explore.

Do
* An area frequented by locals dining on streetfood, socialising and playing games. Most locals are unable to speak much English they will show some interest in foreigners and be willing to play ball/'kick the shuttlecock' or similar. Some very nice food on stalls nearby but not much going on as it is now largely closed off for reconstruction (June 2016). Worth a trip for some streetfood but don't expect an evening's entertainment. As always, although most Chinese who show an interest in foreigners are just curious, or genuinely want to practise English, remember that young female/male con artists may target you in Datong just as in Beijing, Shanghai and elsewhere.

Eat

* 

*A cafeteria-line place that offers cheap and tasty soup noodle variations on the Shanxi specialty of 刀削面 (dāoxiāomiàn - knife-cut noodles). Vegetarian noodle option available, as well as plenty of side dishes."

* Consider for the experience, not the food. Chinese-style western restaurant, designed for Chinese people, not Westerners (ie luxurious sofas as seats, ice in champagne bucket to put in your beer to make it cold, asking for salt&pepper not thought strange but not already at every table, only has squat toilet). You will probably think the thick-base pizza is a reasonable imitation, but you may also realise why some Chinese people say that Western food basically isn’t as tasty as Chinese food. ¥50 up. Other passable Western food.

*A well-known place among locals serving Shanxi hotpot. A picture menu is available to help choosing ingredients. As opposed to hotpot in other places where everyone shares one pot, each person gets their own in the Shanxi version.

*This is a simple restaurant run by a delightful young woman who speaks excellent English. It also advertises wifi. May only be open in the afternoon. Phone for more information.

*
A few small Chinese restaurants are dotted around, especially on DaNanJie (South of the wall) and serve excellent food very cheaply. Menus are in Chinese so know your basics meals. These restaurants all close in the afternoon so if you want a late lunch after site-seeing this is not the place to go.

Drink
* Cups of tea start at ¥10 but you may prefer to try a pot ~¥30. Xīhú Lóngjǐng green tea is worth a try. Best just before sunset if they open the shutters - see sun fall over Huāyuàn Monastery, look out of 2nd floor window onto street below or just relax - actually part of a chain with origins more than 100 years ago that has not spread out of Shanxi yet - but you might not realise it. Don’t step in the indoor stream. There are extra charges if you use a private room at the side (¥28/hr) or want a tea master to stay at your table (after a free quick lesson) topping up your tea pot. (¥60/hr). The prices in the English menu may be out of date - and the Chinese menus may also not be accurate for seasonal teas (eg they may be lower than printed). Spoken English not good - but you should be able to come to an understanding what is available at what price. Free hot water top-ups on request. Freshly-ground coffee (现摩咖啡) , beer (啤酒), popcorn (爆米花), sweets/candies (糖），raisins (‘香妃’／葡萄干），roasted watermelon seeds (烤西瓜字), peanuts (花生）cashew nuts (腰果) and almonds (大杏仁）are available but not on the English menu. Busy at weekends. (2011)

* A very nice hotel with comfortable rooms, a small on sight restaurant and a good breakfast. Don't be fooled by advertising of a rooftop restaurant as this is presently closed or a swimming pool as this is in fact in the nearby 'Datong Grand Hotel' where Binguan guests can swim for 30rmb. There are a few restaurants around the corner and it is situated close to some nice parks. 
* It is a 3 star hotel just across the train station which is very convenient. A price for a night in a room with two beds is ¥265 (as of Dec 2009). Rooms are very comfortable. On the negative side the staff barely speaks English but one or two of the girls at the counter can help you. The hotel has an excellent restaurant frequented by visiting Chinese. You do not have to be a guest to eat here. Meals vary in price from ¥15 to ¥268 plus for duck.The menu has pictures. Around the block are a number of places to eat, bakeries and a supermarket.
* A new and fresh hotel with a decent western breakfast as well as local option. The rooms were nice and there was free WiFi in the lobby. Considering the location it might be a bit pricey, but the standard was very good.
