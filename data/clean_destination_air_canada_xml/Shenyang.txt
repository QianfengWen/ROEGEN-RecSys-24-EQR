Shenyang (沈阳 Shěnyáng), historically Mukden, is the capital of in .

Understand
Capital of Liaoning Province and the largest city in the northeast of China, Shenyang is a city steeped in history. Nu'erhachi built his imperial palace and was laid to rest in one of the first two imperial tombs of the Qing Dynasty, Fuling Tomb. His son is buried in Zhaoling Tomb, which is the second of the first two imperial tombs. The imperial palace and the two tombs are all listed by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites. It was in Shenyang that the Russian army was defeated by the Japanese in 1905. It was also here, on September 18th, 1931 that the Fengtian incident ignited a war between China and Japan that would see the Japanese occupation of all of Northeast China. This city was also the home to the warlord Zhang Zuolin and his son Zhang Xueliang who ruled over the Northeast during the 1920's. The 20th century saw Shenyang develop as a major industrial centre. Today the city is rapidly losing its older structures with large scale construction throughout the city, like all cities in China.

An airport shuttle runs from the airport to the main China Northern Airlines ticket office (117 Zhonghua Road; 中华路117号; Zhōnghuálù) and back frequently.

By car
Shenyang is connected by a major expressway, the 6-lane Jingshen Expressway, from Beijing, some 685 km (425 mi) away. Expressways also link Shenyang with and provinces. The Shenda Expressway connecting Shenyang and Dalian was the first expressway ever built in China (383 km /238 mi). It is the fastest highway (8-lane) linking one of the largest port cities to Shenyang.

By train
Train service is provided through two train stations, the north train station and the south train station (Also known as Shenyang railway station). The north train station handles the majority of the long-distance trains while the south train station handles high speed trains from Beijing, most of the northeast trains and does local service around the province. Some trains travel to both stations so be aware of which station you need to board your train. Both stations are on the subway but on different lines so changing between them will take 20-30minutes, or there is a special ¥1 bus that runs back and forth west to east. Look for it at the bus stop closest to the train station gates. It is marked with a banner on the side (in Chinese) that says something like Shenyang Train Station East-West. If you can understand those Chinese characters, you should be able to catch this frequent bus.

Get around
Sights in the old city, Shenhe District, can be walked between, but other areas such as those in Beiling or Dongling require transport.

The first line of the Shenyang Metro runs east-west across the city and serves the train station. The second line runs north-south.

Shenyang has a comprehensive bus system, but it can be incomprehensible if you do not read Chinese. Make sure you pick up a city bus and area map at either train station. Very handy to help get around. Buses charge &yen;1-2 and major bus lines congregate around the train stations. Bus 203 travels between the two train stations.

There are plenty of taxis whose meters start at &yen;8 for 3 kilometers, then &yen;1.8 per kilometer. Make sure you get a taxi in which the meter is mounted on the dashboard and easily visible from your seat instead of behind the gear shift - it is possible the driver may be pulling some sleight of hand to increase your fare. As with any Chinese city you will find a shortage of taxis in rainy weather, and much use of shared taxis to get around.

See

* Former Imperial Palace - First built in 1625 for Nurhachi, and inherited by his son Abahai (Huang Taiji), the Former Imperial Palace of Shenyang is one of two royal complexes extent in China today. 

The splendid and distinctly ethnic Manchu architectural style of the palace, which includes Dazheng (Grand Politics) Hall, the Ten Princes' Pavillion, Chongzhen (Golden Chimes), Phoenix Chamber and Qingning (Pure Tranquility) Pavillion, are still in perfect shape. On Saturday afternoons during the summer, the palace is the venue for a grand Imperial procession. This is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site alongside the palace in Beijing. It is also an AAAA rated tourist site on the Chinese national scale. A guidebook is available in English at the ticket office, priced &yen;25, which provides a detailed explanation of the exhibits.

This fascinating palace contains finer details compared to the one in Beijing, such as the exquisitely handcrafted detailed carving and painting, which are still clear after four centuries. The throne room in Chongzheng Hall has incredibly detailed scrollwork -even the columns circled by the watchful dragons and on the throne. The palace also shows a significant influence from the nomadic heritage of its builders in the cold Manchuria.

* This is the tomb of the second Qing emperor, Huang Taiji, and his consorts. It was built over a period of eight years during the mid 17th century. The buildings are currently covered with scaffolding as renovation work is undertaken. The site is a unique blend of traditional Manchu and Chinese architecture. The area is listed, along with the other imperial tombs of the Ming and Qing dynasty, as a UNESCO world heritage site and a AAAA rated tourist site on the Chinese national scale. It is one of only three imperial tombs north of the Great Wall of China. Around the tomb is set out the extensive lands of Beiling Park which includes large areas of forest and several lakes. Note may be closed in winter, check locally (Nov-2015)

* This is the first tomb of the Qing Dynasty in which Nu'erhachi, the founder of the dynasty, is laid to rest. It dates to the early 17th century and is constructed in traditional Manchu style along lines of Chinese fengshui. The area is listed, along with the other imperial tombs of the Ming and Qing dynasty, as a UNESCO world heritage site and a AAAA rated tourist site on the Chinese national scale. It is one of only 3 imperial tombs north of the great wall of China. To the east of the tomb site a large area of park land forms Dongling Park. Bus stop name is 东陵公园

* Built in the 1640's and now restored to close to original, these four pagodas stand each about 4km north, south, east and west of the Imperial Palace that was the centre of the old city. Each pagoda is almost identical to the others but the north and south pagodas are in the best condition today.

* This is the largest statue of Mao Zedong in china. Around the base of the statue are images of workers, peasants and soldiers in heroic poses. The square is a popular place for locals to relax. Also called 'Taxi Square' by the locals.

* A high-quality museum featuring Liaoning history from the stone age to the Qing dynasty, with many relics of China's past found in the area (3rd floor). Also houses large collections of Chinese traditional art and calligraphy, plus temporary exhibitions. There may be queues to enter during main public holidays. Closed on Mondays.

* At 22:30 on 18 September 1931, a bomb exploded beside the Japanese run railway line near Shenyang. Though instigated by the Japanese, the Chinese were blamed for the event giving the Japanese an excuse to invade and occupy the whole of the northeast of China. Shenyang was the epicenter of that invasion, so it is most appropriate that the museum for the '9.18 Incident', as it is known, is in Shenyang next to the spot where the explosion occurred. The museum, as one would expect, depicts the incident from a Chinese perspective. It is not for the faint of heart because it unflinchingly displays the atrocities of war. Only the main descriptions are available in English, but it's enough to follow the course of events. The pictures and exhibits speak for themselves, anyway. 

* Shenjing is the old name for Shenyang during the 17th century - jing meaning capital city. This street tries to recreate the architectural styles of the time. It is however only a facard over the front of relatively modern 20th century structures within which a variety of tourist orientated shops operate.

* This is the site of the 2006 International Horticultural Exposition. One of Shenyang's main tourist attractions, it continues to operate though the expo has officially ended. It features international gardens reminiscent of Epcot Center in Disney World in the U.S, (the amusement park is really awesome compared to the gardens, which includes a roller coaster and many other fun activities!). It also features gardens for different provinces and cities within China and the expo's most recognizable feature, the Lily Tower, a massive structure inspired by its namesake flower (for &yen;30, you can take an elevator to the top of this magnificent structure). Before its transformation to the Expo Gardens, this was once the much humbler Botanical Gardens. It opens in the spring and closes in October. Most of the signs are in English and Chinese. 

* This was the home of Zhang Zuolin and his son Zhang Xueliang during the end years of the Qing dynasty and the beginning of the Republic. Zhang became, with the fall of the Qing Emperor, the warlord in control of the northeast of China and for a short time was proclaimed president of China.

* Housing 15 historical locomotives and 3 duplicated historical locomotives. It is the biggest steam locomotive museum in China.

* Beiling airport is the site where China produced it's first modern jet aircraft in the early 1950's. These were initially copies of Soviet MIG fighters but gradually Chinese designs developed. A strong focus is placed on comparing Chinese and American aircraft, in particular those involved in the Korean War of the 50's. They also tell the history of Chinese missile development and other technologies. Civilian aircraft were also produced here and feature in the exhibits. The tour finishes with the modern J-11 fighter, China's new passenger aircraft (ACAC ARJ21 Xiangfeng or Flying Phoenix) and the recent Chinese space flights. This is an AAAA rated site on China's national tourist scale.

* On this location were found the remains of a 7,000-year old, stone age, village. A museum now houses the archaeological finds and the village has been reconstructed. The site is in two sections. The ticket office is on the north side of the road. You will then be directed across to the museum on the south side to view the display before returning to the north side again to enter the reconstruction area. Displays are labeled in both Chinese and English and the site is rated AAA on China's national tourist scale. Use subway line 2 and exit at Xinle stop. The provincial museum has a large section on local stone age cultures that also contains relics from this site.

* The original city walls of Shenyang were destroyed in the 1950's. Some small sections have been reconstructed to give an impression of the former city. These remains consist of two gates, Huaiyuanmen and Fujinmen, at either end of Shenyang Lu.

* A small museum beside the Laolongkou distillery tells the history of Baiju production on the site which dates to the early 17th century. The display includes old maps and photographs of the area. Equipment used in the wine production and a collection of old bottles, labels and trademarks used by the company.

* Opened in 2008 and still under expansion, this claims to be the biggest aquarium in Asia. Currently there are four displays open. The Ocean World display contains sea and fresh water aquariums filled with all manor of aquatic life. The Century Forest display focuses on reptiles. There is also the Narnian Castle which is a theatre where animal shows are performed several times throughout the day (show times may vary throughout the year). Lastly there is Susu world, a soft play centre for children. Each of these displays can be purchased separately or on a combined ticket. Beside this site, in late 2009, Asia's largest water park will open, featuring swimming pools, water flumes and other water activities.

Do

Drink

* Packed even on weeknights, this large Chinese-style club offers a constant cabaret-style variety show with over-the-top dance acts and live singing. One highlight is the male performers seem compelled to chug any quantity of beer bought for them, up to two-liter pitchers, in one go, without using their hands.(is closed and new club has replaced)

* Re-opened in May 2008 with a bar area next to the disco. Used to be a popular spot for foreigners, by now (September 2013) you will only find very few foreigners here. A lot of live shows and free gadgets.(new owner and name)

* A shiny, trendy club with an outdoor patio frequented by expats, mostly Russian ones. Not too crappy music, great food before 23:00, a bit pricey though.

* The oldest foreigner bar in town is like an institution for both expats and locals. Cheap alcohol, darts, soccer games on TV.

* Used to be a great place, now it's your regular Chinese disco.

*Cocktail bar, large selection of imported beers, fine wine and sake.
Many entertainments (Pub Quiz, Live Music, Bingo etc...). 
*Crowded with foreigners after 11pm, they always get buy 1 get 2 on beer and cocktails. Mostly Russian, German, African crowd. Easy place to get to know women, some of them might ask for money. ¥30 for a long island, you get 2 being laowai, might get you drunk faster than you planned. Alcohol used for cocktails is fake/very low quality as at almost any nightclub throughout China. Pretty good live band from U.S. (by Sep 2013). Only nightclub that in town that is packed after 02:00. Service is really bad for a Chinese nightclub, you have to wait for a long time at the bar to get service.

*Night club with international live band.
*Feng Livehouse might be small, but the shows that happen there are mighty! Plenty of good cheap drinks and dive bar/insane-asylum foam padding decor make this worth checking out.
*This place is a Shenyang classic. Come on Friday nights and Sunday nights to meet other expats and listen to great tunes. 
*This a terrific tap house run by a Chinese guy called Caleb, who speaks perfect English and is very friendly. He knows his beers and constantly changes the 12 taps of mainly Chinese craft beer. Would be regarded as a good beer venue in any country.
*Italian style bistro and perhaps the only foreign owned bar outside of the city centre. Run by a welcoming Romanian chef.

* 
This small hotel is non-spectacular, but offers cheap singles (or, if you need "a short rest" will let a room to you for fours hours for &yen;30).
