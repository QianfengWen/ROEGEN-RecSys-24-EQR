is a historical city, with around 380,000 inhabitants. Although it is well known by Italians, it is less so among foreign visitors. English is widely spoken by the local student population. It is the capital and largest city of (a region in northern ). Bologna is famed for having the oldest university in Europe and the whole Western world, a lively student population, exquisite food, typical brick terracotta-roofed architecture and porticos, theatre and nightlife.

Understand

Bologna is famous for its cuisine (la cucina Bolognese). It is also viewed as a progressive and well administered city. It is considered second only to Venice in beauty by many Italians and certainly has one of the largest and best preserved historic centres among Italian cities. Its architecture is noted for its palette of terracotta reds, burnt oranges, and warm yellows, hence the name of Bologna la rossa (Bologna the red). The extensive town centre, characterised by miles of attractive covered walkways, known as "porticos," is one of the best-preserved in Europe. The porticoes are part of the UNESCO World Heritage List.

Bologna is the seat of the oldest university in continental Europe, founded in 1088. 

History

The strategic location of the city moulded its history. Inhabited since the 9th Century B.C., during the Iron age, it was fortified by the Celts and became a municipality under the Romans. The presence through the centuries of the Huns, Goths, Lombards, Franks, Austrians and French, has left traces which are still visible on the city today.

Bologna struggled for autonomy, having been dominated by emperors, kings, and the Church. It was ruled by the Pepoli and Bentivoglio families, and was a papal fiefdom. The papal power made it a city of the Guelphs, while many of its residents supported the anti-papal Ghibellines. Bologna had the first city council in Italy, and was, with the Liber Paradisus law in 1256, one of the first cities in the world to abolish slavery. This political activity was rooted in the lively environment surrounding the Alma Mater, as the university was known.

Bologna was the home of such personalities as Father Martini, a collector, composer and master of counterpoint who was a notable and complex protagonist of European music of the eighteenth century. Among his students were Johann Christian Bach (son of J.S Bach) and the young W.A Mozart. During the nineteenth century the Philharmonic Academy drew important personalities such as Rossini, Verdi, Brahms, Wagner, Puccini and Liszt.

Bologna was named a Creative City of Music for UNESCO in 2006. Music is performed throughout the city: in the Teatro Comunale(the Opera Theatre), by the Orchestra Mozart youth orchestra, founded and directed by Claudio Abbado, and in clubs and pubs where jazz is regularly played. There are open-air concerts and music can be heard at the Conservatory, the Opera School, and hundreds of music associations operating within the territory.

Bologna's scientists have included Luigi Galvani and Guglielmo Marconi. Native or visiting painters and artists have included Giorgio Morandi, Guido Reni, Guercino, the Carraccis, Leonardo (one of the legends about the Mona Lisa tells that this was where he painted his famous masterpiece), Giotto (there was a chapel in Piazza XX Settembre entirely painted with a fresco by Giotto that was destroyed when Bologna was fighting against the Pope), Giovanni Cassini (who made the world’s longest sundial, now located inside the Basilica of San Petronio) , and Michelangelo (on the arc in Basilica San Domenico can be found his sculpture of an angel holding a candelabra). Napoleon re-arranged the urban plan of the city and Charles V was crowned emperor of the Holy Roman Empire in the Basilica of San Petronio.

When to visit
Bologna is at its best from March/April to October, when it is warm and there is much outdoor drinking and dining, or just sitting in squares such as Piazza Santo Stefano and Piazza Maggiore. However, during July and August it may be particularly hot and humid and more populated by tourists. In August, as is the case in much of Italy in the summer, many shops and restaurants are closed for the summer vacation. 

Winter can be cold, but Bologna is beautiful the two weeks before Christmas. January and February often feature cloudless blue skies, but the clear weather is often the coldest: you will need a coat, scarf, hat and gloves.

Get in

By plane
Bologna's closest airport is Guglielmo Marconi (Bologna) International Airport (IATA: BLQ) just a few minutes from the city centre, served by taxi and a special monorail line called the Marconi Express which replaced Aerobus in 2020. The train runs between 5:40 AM and midnight and connects the airport with the central train station. It runs every 15 minutes (every 7.5 minutes during the rush hour) and the ride takes approximately 7 minutes. Tickets cost 8,70 € (16 € for a return ticket) and can be bought at vending machines on monorail's stations, online or elsewhere. A taxi from the airport to the centre costs about €20. . Bus 54 goes towards the west suburbs of Bologna, and will get you on to the 'main' routes. Another bus stop is about 10 minutes walk from the airport (bus stop name: Birra - other side of the elevated motorway, follow the road out of the airport, turn right at the first roundabout and straight through the second roundabout) and you can board buses 81 and 91 which will take you to Bologna Central railway station. Bus tickets are valid for 75 minutes travel and cost €2 (one can buy tickets in the bar on the opposite side of the street or at the airport in Carrefour Express). WARNING: You MUST have a ticket BEFORE boarding the bus! Ticket inspectors will fine you €75 if you don't have one onboard, even if you are a tourist who doesn't know their system. 
Go to the website of the local bus company, TPER, and you will find maps that show all routes including that of the airport bus.
* Ryanair flies to Bologna Gugliemo Marconi. British Airways and Turkish Airlines have 2 or 3 flights per day (depending on season) to/from London Heathrow and to/from Istanbul Ataturk respectively.

By train
Due to its central location and geography, Bologna has emerged as the main rail transport hub of northern Italy, making it very well connected with other major Italian cities. The high-speed train to/from Milan takes only 65 minutes. Bologna is 37 minutes from Florence (or almost 3 hours with the slow train), 2 hours 20 minutes from Rome, 1.5 to 2 hours from Venice, 1 hour from Ferrara.

There is also an overnight sleeper service from Paris Bercy to Bologna. Departs Paris 6:52 pm and arrives Bologna at 6 am. Return departs Bologna 10:30 pm and arrives in Paris at 9:06 am. There are also two direct train connections to Munich per day (6 hours 30 minutes).

By car
The city is at the junction of the A1, A14 and A13 highways, and so is easily accessible from anywhere in Italy. Most traffic from Milan exits the A1 and take the Tangenziale, but beware this road at rush hour because it is horrendously packed. It may take around two hours from the A1 exit to the Tangenziale to the centre at certain peak times over summer busy weekends, especially at the beginning and end of August.

Parking
Bologna is like any big city, parking is difficult but there are many car parks.
Parking in the city centre is available, many are open 24 hours. One of the biggest parking in the city centre is in Piazza VIII Agosto.

Get around

Layout of the city
Looking at the map of the city (get a free one at the Tourist Information Centre in Piazza Maggiore), the first thing to do to orient yourself is to find the Due Torri landmark in the middle of the free map. The centre of the city is surrounded by the Viali, a circular road easily recognisable. The northeast quadrant of the map is the university district (which unlike some US campuses is an integral part of the city and not a separate compound). The two southern quadrants of your city map are residential sections of the city, and not common tourist areas. However, walking outside the city centre, further to the south, you will come upon hills and Giardini Margherita, the largest park of the city.

By bus
The TPER company is in charge of the buses in Bologna. Useful information can be found on their website: 
Tickets may be purchased prior to boarding the bus, or on the bus where there are ticket machines. If you see 2 machines on a bus (usually one red and one yellow) the red one will sell you a ticket (€2.0, valid for 75 minutes) and the yellow one will validate a 'season' or multi-trip ticket. Information and ticket centres can be found in central locations (railway station, coach station, city centere). Useful bus maps are also available there. These main ticket centres often sell multi-trip tickets at a discount (e.g. 10-trip ticket for €14). You can also purchase tickets in many shops (newsagents, tobacconists, cafés). The 24h ticket cost €6.

By taxi
In the city centre taxi ranks can be found at Stazione Centrale (railway station); Bus station; Via Indipendenza (corner with via Augusto Righi); Piazza Malpighi; corner via Rizzoli-via Archiginnasio, near Piazza Maggiore.

On bike
Bikes are most popular amongst the people of Bologna. They are available for hire from various locations around the city (one near the railway station). You can ride on the many bike trails and on the side of the road. 
Be sure to lock them safely with a good lock, as they get stolen all around town, especially around the university.

On foot 
Bologna is a great place around which to travel on foot, as getting around the city is very simple with clear street signs. It is also a great way to find hidden gems such as Pizzerias packed with Italians (so you KNOW you reached the right place). Be a bit careful when crossing roads, the city centre swarms with scooters and small motorcycles (cars banned during the day) and they ride them everywhere.

See
 
The city is famous for its porticoes. There are 38kms in the city centre, and around 15kms outside the city centre for a total of about 53kms. The longest one, and probably one of the longest in the world, is the Portico di San Luca (7.5 kilometers) which connects Porta Saragozza (one of the 12 old city gates) to the Sanctuary of the Madonna di San Luca located on a 289 metres high hill overlooking the whole city. It is well worth the walk to enjoy the panorama. The portico features 666 vault arcades and provides shelter for the traditional procession during the Feast of Ascension.

 Music venues 
Bologna is an Italian hub for rock, electronic and alternative music. There are almost a hundred concerts every year by international bands. Unfortunately many of these locations have moved outside the city center. The main places to check out are The Estragon and Link . 

* a big ex-industrial hangar, features dj-sets and concerts by international rock bands almost every night.
 
* Another occupied location that mostly features experimental music festivals and rock concerts.

* an occupied ex-agricultural market where Punk-hc, rock and electronic concerts are often featured. A very cheap place, great if you don't mind the punk atmosphere. Every Thursday from 17.30 is the organic market. There is also self-managed workshop to repair bikes. it's open on Wednesdays and Sundays from 18 to 22.

* recently moved outside the city, is a large, 2-floor club that features mostly avant garde electronic, techno and hip-hop gigs and dj-sets. A little book shop, mainly on "alternative" subjects, can be found inside 

* the most renowned indie rock club, features rock concerts by a number of interesting bands, but it is quite small and expensive.

* another indie rock club, but friendlier than il Covo

Buy

The key to shopping in Italy is to look in every little shop as you walk around, paying attention to price tags. Please take note that the hours listed usually specify a closure in the afternoons. There is no one place to get the perfect pair of shoes or the perfect ties or the perfect anything: you have to look all over, but this is half the fun. If you can't find what you want at the price you want to pay for it, keep looking, chances are you will find something somewhere else that will work perfectly.

Don't miss the chance to buy local food, such as hand-made pastas and gorgeous cheeses, from any of the hundreds of small vendors and shops to be found in the city. At least half the experience of visiting Bologna is the gastronomic pleasure!

If you have money to spend (a lot perhaps ...) you have to go in 'Galleria Cavour' , near 'Via Farini' with a lot of chic high fashion shops and trendy outlets (Armani, Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent, Versace ... etc ...)

Another "shop street" is "via San Felice" near "via Ugo Bassi" with a lot of small shops that made artigianal dresses (sugarbabe), artshop (elzapoppin), art galleries and (as usual) shoes and dresses shop.

* This is a gormet grocery store connected with the Slow Movement which aims at promoting traditional italian food, beverages together with local and artisanal products.
* One of best places in Bologna to buy and taste coffee, tea and chocolate.

* Since 1985, probably the best deli in Bologna. Fresh pasta, cheese, meat, oil and don't forget tortellini.

Markets
* Historical weekly market (Friday and Saturday), over 400 stalls. The historical cattle market was first set up here in 1251.
* Takes place every second Saturday and second Sunday of the month. Here you will find small antiques, collectibles etc.
* Takes place in December. The portico fills with stalls selling Christmas decorations, gifts, sweets etc. It is among the most loved markets by Bolognese citizens.

Eat

There are many choices for where to eat, as Bologna is generally considered to be the gastronomic centre of Italy, the Food Capital. It is difficult to find a truly poor meal as the Bolognese, like most Italians, use fabulous quality local produce with sparkling ingenuity. Via del Pratello has lots of bars and restaurants/osterie for young people. There's lots to choose from here. Walk past, look at the menus. It is located towards the middle of the 'western' part of the city centre. Via Mascarella and Largo Respighi in the University area feature other notable eateries.

* Located in the historic center of Bologna, the bread basket of Italy, Trattoria Del Rosso serves “piatti della tradizione Bolognese” – “Traditional Dishes of Bologna” – seven days a week. Owned and operated by chef Stephano Curvucci.
* The oldest bakery in Bologna, great cakes.
* Bolognese specialties at reasonable price 
* Excellent restaurant with fish and meat menus
* has twice been voted best in Italy. Great for a stand up sandwich ( Pancetta with Balsamic or a Mortadella Panino) and an excellent glass of the wine of your choice.
* much frequented by students and serves fantastic fish secondi and an excellent ragu'
* Traditional cuisine
* 
* 

* For good service, good wine list and fine food at a price try Camminetto D'Oro in Via de Falegnami or Cesarina in Piazza Santo Stefano. 
*For more contemporary stylish dining try the excellent and good value Marco Fadiga Bistro in Via Rialto or Casa Monica in Via San Felice.

* Probably the most famous restaurant in the city. Elderly Bolognese, tourists and businessmen dine here. The traditional regional cuisine like Lasagne Bolognese, Tortellini in Brodo and Tagliatelle with Ragu are the best choice here and the service is top notch. The daunting bollito misto is still a favorite and 35 Euros will add heaps of shaved white truffle to any dish. Diana is a favorite of Mario Batali but has fallen out of favour with many locals.

* Once upon a time good ice cream (gelato) could only be found at Antica sorbetteria in Via Castiglione. Try the wonderful pistachio ice cream and try almond "granita", though this is better at the recently opened Grom on Via D'Azeglio. The other place for superb pistachio and chocolate and many unique ice cream flavors, like Parmigiano with Pears or Fig and Almond or Watermelon and Jasmine, is Il Gelatauro, in Via San Vitale, considered one of the best gelaterie in all Italy. The newly opened Cremeria in Piazza Cavour is giving everyone else a run for their money with many excellent flavor combinations. 
* Via San Vitale also features L'Antica Bologna, a chic but good and not particularly expensive bar and patisserie. Good Italian coffee is served too.
* If you want reasonably priced but good Italian food, go to to Matusel (Via Bertoloni 2) in the University (north-east of the center) zone (next to Via Zamboni ) and offer a good and tasty meal for as cheap as 10 euros, coffee included. Matusel is renowned for good fish dishes. 
* Many gourmets swear by the simple Bolognese food of the down to earth, reasonably-priced Trattoria Tony in Via Augusto Righi, just 1/2 block off Via Independencia--truly excellent.
* L'antica Trattoria Spiga on Via Broccaindosso is a bit hard to find, but make the effort; it has a very good risotto and wonderful traditional Cucina Bolognese (which does not include risotto).If you are blessed to visit on a Wednesday,don't miss out on the day's special, a platter with crescente bread served with cold cured meats and cheeses for savory and nutella and jams for dessert. As with most places in Bologna, be prepared to know a little Italian. L'Antica Osteria Romagnola in Via Rialto is very pretty and does good food but refuse the abundant (and expensive) antipasto or have that and just one other course.
* Go to Zanarini on Piazza Galvani,1 for a lunch. Best Terrace in town. Stylish waiters serve quality food. A 0,75 l bottle San Pelligrini only costs 2,50 EUR. Good value for your money.
* Osteria La Matta (meaning the crazy woman) on Via Zucchini 9 is a hidden gem quite close to the university quartet. The staff and menu are 100% local, with dishes like tortellini, tortelloni and tagliatelle al ragù, all strictly handmade and delicious. The staff is friendly and funny, prices are good for value, it's a great place to enjoy a quiet dinner or melt with the busy office people who are regulars to La Matta at lunchtime.
*If you've overdosed on traditional Italian food, enjoy some delicious Persian cuisine at Pars. Be sure to make reservations or get there early, the restaurant fills up fast, and for good reason. The food is high quality, the service friendly, and the atmosphere charming.

Drink
Consider visiting the many pubs and clubs of Via Zamboni (university zone); some, such as "The Irish Pub", popular with students and foreigners, give happy hours on Tuesday/Wednesday.

Otherwise, the Via Pratello has many bars and is the center of the city's alternative scene. Worth a look in particular is "Mutanye", whose owner is reputed to have been part of the Red Brigade in his youth, hence the many soviet posters.
