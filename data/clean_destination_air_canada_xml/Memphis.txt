Memphis is the second largest city in the state of and the second largest metropolitan area in the state after . The state rests in the southeastern portion of the . Memphis, with a population totaling more than 653,350 as of 2013, is also the county seat for Shelby County. The city's claims to fame include Graceland, the mansion Elvis Presley lived in for twenty years. Maybe more importantly, Memphis is considered by many to be the home of blues music. 

Memphis is an older city that has been through a lot. With that said, the city has developed a rugged yet, colorful sense of character that locals identify with. A lovely mix of old and new, Memphians have worked hard to build a vibrant community while keeping the city's old-time charm. Memphis has much more to offer than just Graceland with its lively neighborhoods and constant renewal. 

Although downtown Memphis has experienced quite a rebirth and renewal in the last few years, the center of the city is older and while new development is hard to find, revitalization of old areas is beginning to take shape. Areas such as Beale Street and Mud Island have become relatively safe and citizens once again have a vested interest in making downtown safe, exciting, and a great place to visit and relax after decades of abandonment.

Whether visiting or moving to the area, from May to October make it well worth your while to visit the Memphis Farmers Market which formed and began in 2006 - it is one of the brightest shining stars of the early Spring, Summer, and through Mid-Autumn.

A word of caution: Memphis is extremely hot in the summertime, and the humidity can make you feel even hotter! Those who have trouble tolerating high heat and humidity may wish to avoid visiting during July or August.

Get in
Memphis is on the southwestern corner of , with the Mississippi River and the state of bordering it to the west and the state of to the south.

By plane
Memphis International Airport (), Memphis is the primary FedEx distribution center, and, as the world's second busiest cargo airport, the air is always full of planes making your eBay purchase a glorious reality. Delta Air Lines once maintained a hub at Memphis International, but dropped the hub in 2012 resulting in a steep 22% decrease in air traffic. Nashville International as of 2015 is the largest airport in Tennessee, but A few other airlines do squeeze passengers into town:
*Air Canada, Toronto-Pearson
*American Airlines, Charlotte, Chicago O'Hare, Dallas-Fort Worth, Miami, New York Laguardia, Philadelphia, Washington-National
*Allegiant Air, (weekly flights only) Austin, Las Vegas, Phoenix, St. Petersburg, Orlando, Ft. Lauderdale, Oakland

*Frontier Airlines, Denver. 
*Southwest Airlines, Baltimore, Chicago–Midway, Houston–Hobby, Orlando, Tampa. 
*United Airlines, Chicago O'Hare, Denver, Houston George Bush Intercontinental, Newark.

*Archers Direct Holidays, 

The airport is served by the #64 airport shuttle to the Airways Transit Hub, which offers bus service to various parts of Memphis.

By car
*Interstate 40 is a good route into town but doesn't go through Memphis; to get to the other side of 40 you take the north loop which is I-40, or the south loop, which is known is I-240 and is Memphis' beltway. 
*I-55 will take you right into town - just take the Riverside Drive exit from either direction to be at Beale Street in a minute.
*Parking - Except for downtown, parking is usually free. If you're downtown, try the "Parking Can Be Fun" garage on Union Avenue. It's cheap, absolutely bizarre, and right where you want to be. Expect to hunt for cheaper parking if there's an event going on at the FedEx Forum, Beale Street or AutoZone Park. Parking vendors also appear to charge higher prices during these peak times.

By train
*Amtrak, Service available from trains running up and down the Mississippi, as well as connections through major hubs. Great for a jaunt up to for world-class shopping or down to for world-class drinking. However international visitors should remember Amtrak connections to other cities usually take at least two days, and the only example of intercity rail in the state of Tennessee is in Nashville with the Music City Star commuter rail with one line.

The station is just south of Downtown Memphis and is served by the #12, #13, and #39 buses.

Get around

*Driving - Travel by car is really the only way to get around Memphis if you want to do anything other than see Downtown.
*Public Transit - Bus service provided by the Memphis Area Transit Authority (MATA) is available across the city. Some routes are very poorly served in the evenings. At nights and weekends some buses take a different route than during the day which can be a trap for visitors.
**A trolley operates downtown and into Midtown, mostly for the benefit of tourists.

Memphis is laid out in a more or less east/west fashion. Roads primarily go east/west and north/south. The expressway fortunately cuts directly through the city. 

Downtown is to the west; it sits atop the bluffs, overlooking the mighty Mississippi River. (It is referred to as Downtown, not as West Memphis, which is a town just across the river in Arkansas.) Moving east you'll come to Midtown, a charming part of the city thought by some as the best part of Memphis. Beyond that, you will find East Memphis, and then the suburbs of , , , and . The area between downtown and Midtown, referred to by locals as "Crosstown," is coming to life slowly but surely. There is a movement to turn it into an artist community. Members of this movement call the area "the Edge". However, most of the "art district" is on South Main.

Around Town

Take note of Elvis Week (Death Week to the locals) in early August, culminating in the candlelight vigil on the anniversary of Elvis' death. It is a big deal, which can be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on your perspective. Check out the bizarre felt-pen scribblings on the fence, some hip-ironic, some of the psycho-lunatic-fan sort. If you happen to be in Memphis during Birth or Death Week - January and August, respectively - sit downtown for a few hours just to watch the Elvis fans. Not just on Halloween, but at any time of year, dress up like the King (or like Priscilla if you're a girl) and you'll instantly be a star in your own right!

Listen
Soul, R&B, and rock 'n' roll have deep roots in Memphis, and destinations abound for good music today.
*Beale Street in downtown Memphis makes sense as a first destination. A dozen clubs pipe their music onto the street, and each night a single wristband buys entrance to them all.
*Hi-Tone Cafe, Featured musical acts could be anybody, from reggae to country-western acts--all of them party bands, to be sure. Make sure you show up ready to move a little, drink a little and even eat little. 
*Wild Bill's Lounge, 1580 Vollintine Ave. It sits unassumingly in a strip mall three miles northeast of Beale Street, where, as if out of an old movie, the boisterous Memphis Soul Survivors, led by the boisterous Miss Nicki, play to a boisterous crowd.

Drink
*Wine is sold in dedicated, licensed liquor stores in Memphis. Most grocery stores may have an "independent" liquor store conveniently next to the grocery store. Apparently this regulation discourages alcohol use by forcing you to walk a few extra feet to buy your booze. High alcohol content beers are sold in liquor stores. Traditional brands such as Budweiser are sold in grocery and convenient store only. Liquor stores are open from ~8AM usually 10AM-11PM, M-Sa. (Beer can be sold before noon on Su in restaurants.)

This place is very popular and always packed on the weekends, but has a fantastic, efficient staff that get you in and out quickly. Open every hour it's legal: 8AM to 11PM, Monday thru Saturday.
*Joe's Liquor Speaking of booze, if you need packaged goods and you're in midtown, head to Joe's (Poplar and Belvedere) as much to see Sputnik (the vintage, spinning, twisting and working neon star) as for the beverages. Go at dusk for maximum effect.
*Great Wine And Spirits is out east. Probably has one of more extensive wine stocks in Memphis liquor stores.
*Bosco's, Overton Square. Brew pub and food. Featured on many "Best Of" lists. 
*Newby's, Highland Street (called the Highland Strip, near The University of Memphis). "Playboy" magazine rated Newby's the "Best place to party like a Rock Star!"

Stay safe
Memphis is considered a not-so-safe city for tourists in the US. It was ranked 4th in 2018 for violent crimes (2,003 per 100,000 residents). However most tourists will likely experience no problems if they take some basic precautions.

Pickpockets and panhandlers are usually the only thing that tourist should protect themselves from. Always be careful of your personal belongings in crowded areas of the downtown. If you’re walking on or around Beale street, you’re likely to encounter panhandlers asking for money. There are signs in the downtown area requesting that you do not give money or change to panhandlers. However, if you do feel inclined to give, don’t take out your wallet to do so. Most panhandlers are harmless but there are thieves that will snatch your wallet if you bring it out. It’s safer to give loose change from your pocket or avoid giving money to panhandlers entirely. Driving is also a less problematic issue and you always need to drive with caution if you’re unfamiliar with the area and the local road rules. Keep your eyes open for drivers who run red lights, or who drive too slowly in the fast lane of the interstate. Staying aware of what other drivers are doing can help you avoid accidents.

Finally there are some areas where tourists should be careful:
*Beale Street - As mentioned earlier always have an eye on your personal belongings and avoid the panhandlers if you can.
*Downtown - The attractions in the downtown are all close to each other to make it practical to walk. However, it’s safer to use a cab or trolley at night rather than walk too far through the downtown area, especially if you’re alone. There is a spike in crime in the city center after dark.
*Graceland - Graceland is a must-visit site for Elvis fans and history buffs, but the area can be dangerous. Don't stray too far from the tourist attractions especially at night and take proper precautions when visiting such as making sure to lock your car doors and not to leave any valuables in plain sight inside your car while it’s parked (car break-ins are not uncommon). If you walk, be aware of your surroundings. If you have traveling companions, it’s always safer to go walking with a friend than by yourself. 
*Suburbs - Most violent crimes in Memphis happens in suburban areas far away from the downtown and Beale Street. Always do good research if you intend to stay in suburbs as safe and unsafe areas can be separated even by a few blocks. In general East Memphis is the safest with North and South Memphis suffering from the worst crime.

Stay healthy
Memphis has some of the best hospitals in the region. Methodist, Baptist, and Saint Francis are the main hospitals in the city. Regional One (formerly known as "The Regional Medical Center at Memphis", aka: The Med), a city owned hospital, has one of the best trauma and burn centers in the Mid-South. There are many clinics in the area as well, many of which are operated by the hospital systems. Some of the hospitals in the city, though, can have long lines in emergency rooms. If you are not seriously injured, it would be best to go to one of the minor medical clinics or to drive to one of the hospitals in the suburbs of Memphis such as Methodist Germantown, Baptist East, or Saint Francis Bartlett.
