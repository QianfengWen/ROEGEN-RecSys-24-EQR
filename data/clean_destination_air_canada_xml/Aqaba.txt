Aqaba (العقبة al-ʿAqabah) is 's only port city, located on the Gulf of Aqaba in the extreme south of the country.

Understand

Aqaba is Jordan's window on the . Historically the same city as on the i side of the border, plans for a shared international airport and other forms of cooperation have cooled down in the past few years during a period of political tension. Aqaba has seen a lot of development in the last few years. This has improved the infrastructure and facilities. Be prepared for road maps to be incorrect/out of date.

Get in

By boat

Ferries run regularly from Aqaba across to and on 's peninsula, bypassing and the sometimes complicated border arrangements. Taba is the best port for tourists (the crossing is shorter, so cheaper and less likely to be cancelled due to bad weather). Generally there is no visa fee for entering Jordan through Aqaba since it is a part of the free trade zone. For contact details and timetables see 

By bus or car
The Desert Highway terminates in Aqaba. There are frequent buses to and other points along the highway. The JETT buses leave from Abdali at 7:00, 9:00, 11:00, 14:00, 16:00, and 18:00. Tickets cost 8.80 JD. Note that there are several security checkpoints along the way, just show your ID when the police enter the bus. At one checkpoint you may be required to exit the bus, retrieve your luggage from the baggage hold and run it through an X-ray machine. (September 2014)

Amman to Aqaba is about 350km using the Desert Highway. It will take about 4 hours to travel this distance at a reasonable speed. Do remember that service/fuel stops are not very frequent on this road.

The i border at Arava (for ) is only a short hop away. The n checkpoint is also visible on a clear day, but visitors without a visa can only look.

If you are planning to come to Aqaba directly from northern Israel (e.g. from Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Be'er Sheva, etc.) by catching an Egged bus to Eilat, you should ask the driver to let you off at the "Eilot stop to Jordan", which is the last stop before the Egged station in Eilat, and then walk the Originally dating to the 14'th century, although the present structure was built by the Mamluke sultan Qansawh el-Ghawri (1501-1516) and has been revised many times since then.

* 

*Indulge yourself with the authentic home-cooking Chinese food. Cozy and warm yet relaxing atmosphere makes you home away from home.

Sleep

Budget
*Great Backpacker hostel in Aqaba city center. The small hostel has a great atmosphere and its lovely owner does everything to make you enjoy your stay. It is fairly new and the only real hostel in town, so it has become the perfect place for backpackers (2018). You can easily reach one of the great beaches either by foot or via local bus or taxi (they can even lend you some snorkelling gear). The hostel is perfect for arranging your trips into the country (Wadi Rum & Petra) as the owner has many good connections and you can easily team up with other backpackers to share a taxi or a bus.

* Alrachk /Petra Hotel is located 50 meter southwest of Aqaba's central bus station. The sign is written in Arabic only apart from the word Hotel. There is a small passage between Jerusalem Hotel and Jordan Flower Hotel, enter there and you see the entrance. Don't be put off by the shabby entrance, once you are inside you find nice rooms with air conditioning and TV. Ask for a room with window and balcony. The Hotel offers singles/double/triple rooms without breakfast. Most backpackers stay in this place (2017) as it is the best located budget Hotel and there is no Hostel around. The only disadvantage is, there is no internet available in the rooms but ask at the reception, as they want to install it. Originally the hotel was called "Petra Hotel" but they changed the name to "Alrachk Hotel". Even though most people still call it Petra Hotel.

* Jordan Flower Hotel is a good Backpacker alternative to Alrachk /Petra Hotel in case it is book out.
