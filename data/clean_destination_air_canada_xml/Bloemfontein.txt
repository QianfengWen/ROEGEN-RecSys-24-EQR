There is a driving circuit weaving around the edge of the hill and a large statue of Nelson Mandela. You can also park the car near the observatory and go for a walk / have a picnic. 
* Outstanding art museum in a beautifully restored Cape-Dutch style house and gardens. Oliewenhuis hosts ever changing temporary displays of contemporary art and photography, whilst upstairs is a more traditional permanent exhibition. There is a very nice cafe in the sculpture garden at the back and is the ideal retreat from the city's sterile shopping malls.

* This former residence of presidents of the Orange Free Stare Republic has been restored to what it would have been at the turn of the century.
* Exhibitions on the two Boer wars and the apartheid struggle.

Do

* Visit one of the numerous game reserves in the area and go sightseeing / hunting
* Take a walk through the tree-lined President Brand Street and visit the various museums
* Take a drive through the northern suburbs and see the lush gardens
* Visit the City Zoo just behind the Waterfront shopping mall. This zoo is home to a stuffed Liger a cross between a lion and a tiger, that was bred at the zoo in the 1930s. This specimen holds the world record for being the largest ever living cat. And at 798kgs you can see why!
*A pleasant Free State nature reserve close to Bloemfontein. What sets
it apart are the lions in the small enclosure in the middle of the park – although the enclosure is big enough to mean that you are not
guaranteed to see the cats. The rest of the reserve is pleasant with open plains, wooded areas and a dam – there are no dangerous animals in the main park so walking is allowed. There is a one-day hiking trail which follow the Modder River, easy enough for families with young children.

The ongoing expansion of the Waterfront mall means that Bloemfontein now has two branches of each of the standard South African chain stores (the other branches being in the Mimosa Mall 2 km up the road). There is a craft market near the Waterfront mall on the first Saturday of the month. Many shops close Saturday afternoons and all day Sunday.

Eat
People eat early in Bloemfontein - even by South African standards, if you arrive at a restaurant after 7.30pm, especially on a weeknight, you may get some funny looks from the staff, and rushed service as they try to get you out the door so they can lock up and go home.
* The place to go. Excellent food in an interesting atmosphere.
*There isn't much that is Mexican about this place, except for the big Aztec statue that overlooks the dining area. Seafood and Steakhouse. One of the city's more upmarket steakhouses. Fantastic food and service in a beautiful restaurant with a selective bar .Winner of numerous awards for food and service.Come and enjoy!
*Branch of the popular CTFM chain. Worth the trip into the northern suburbs.
*A good choice for breakfast, lunch or a light dinner, and a tad more sophisticated (by Bloemfontein standards) than the chain restaurants in the shopping malls. The only downside is that the terrace overlooks the car park.
*One of the better steakhouses in town, although not the best. Not a bad choice for families.

Stay safe
Bloemfontein is much safer than most other cities. You can walk around downtown during the day time (although it will be eerily quiet after the shops close). The Waterfront and other shopping malls are safe and patrolled with 24 hour security, and 2nd Street (the main restaurant strip) is fine day and night. The dodgy areas to avoid if possible are near the train station and anywhere east of the railway lines (where the traditional townships are located).

If you find yourself arriving at the train station early in the morning, a meter taxi can take you to either the KFC or the McDonald's on Nelson Mandela Ave for R50. They are in a safe area, have free wifi, are open 24-hours, and don't have a problem with travelers "camping out" until sunrise. 

AUGUST 2022: The above information is no longer accurate, Post covid these fast food restaurants are no longer 24 hours.
