Anchorage is the largest city in , located in the region. Anchorage is a port city with a population of over 300,000. The published population density is very low as the city covers over a whopping 1900 square miles, compared with 's 225 square miles or 's 300 square miles. But most of the land in Anchorage's city limits is uninhabited and mountainous. Anchorage is a municipality: essentially a combined city and county. The urbanized portion of the city is a relatively compact area defined by Muldoon Road to the east, Rabbit Creek Road to the south, and Cook Inlet to the north and west. Several small suburbs are within the Municipality of Anchorage, while physically outside what most Anchorageites would call the "Anchorage" proper area. These include Eagle River and Chugiak to the north and Girdwood to the south.

Climate

}}
Alaska is well-known for its cold winters -but most visitors come in the summer, when the days are long and the temperatures are moderate.

Many people consider the period between May and September to be the best time to visit Anchorage. The month of June usually has the best combination of long days, good weather, and warm afternoons.

As you would expect in the high northern latitudes, the longest days come around the summer solstice, 21 June, and they get quite short around the winter solstice, 21 December.

In the summer, Anchorage averages an amazing 19.5 hours of sunlight each day. By March the days begin to feel noticeably longer. By contrast, Anchorage averages just 5 hours of sunlight each day in December. 

The Anchorage-area climate, including the Kenai Peninsula and Prince William Sound, often sees summer temperatures in the mid-70s (24&deg;C). Winter temperatures may see days fall into the -20s and -30s (-30s&deg;C) at different intervals.

Travelers should note that summer heat can feel hotter than the actual temperature. A sunny day in the mid-70s can feel like the 90s. At high latitudes, the sun's lower angle means the body receives a larger area of direct sunlight. (Comparatively, nearer the equator, the noon sun is directly overhead.)

Get in 
Anchorage is served by most major American carriers. Air travel is the cheapest and most efficient form of transportation in and out of the state. Non-stop flights are available from , , , , , , and year-round. Many arriving and departing out-of-state flights are late-night "red-eyes," but there are often many daytime flights to and from Seattle. Anchorage recently completed extensive remodeling and construction at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport () () to help accommodate the upsurge in tourism (unofficial sources have estimated the numbers for 2004 at some four million tourists arriving in Alaska between May and September). For all the domestic flights to anchorage you can call at 
+1-800-683-0266 or check online at airowings llc

Anchorage is also accessible from the contiguous (locally referred to as "the Lower 48") and Canada via roadway. The starts in northern and terminates in . You can get to Anchorage via either the Parks Highway from Fairbanks or the Glenn Highway from Tok (the first major Alaskan town after crossing the Canadian border). The Seward Highway serves traffic entering Anchorage from the Kenai Peninsula to the south and its Alaska Marine Highway System terminals. 

Make sure to pick up a copy of The Milepost which is widely regarded as the premier road guide for western Canada and Alaska. The Milepost has extremely detailed route descriptions of all of the roads, pointing out everything from scenic viewpoints and campgrounds down to the names of small creeks the roads pass over. If you're flying in to Anchorage and then driving around the state, wait and pick up a copy of The Milepost at one of the local Costcos or WalMarts--the price there is around half of list price.

Many cruise lines provide transportation from their terminals to Anchorage and may even include tours or your return air travel out of the state.

Get around
While not nearly comparable to the size of major world cities (the city itself is nearly 2,000 square miles, but much of it is uninhabited and mountainous), the developed part of the Municipality of Anchorage is spread out and not very walkable, with the exception of the compact downtown area.

Most of Anchorage is built on a grid system originally laid out by the railroad: numbered streets run east-west, starting at First Avenue on the north side of downtown (at the Port and train depot) and ending up in the mid-hundreds at the south edge of town. Lettered streets run north-south, starting at A Street in the middle of downtown and going up to the west; east of A Street, the street names begin with sequential letters and are named after Alaskan cities and towns (, Cordova, Denali, etc.). This makes finding yourself on a map fairly easy, although the system gets less coherent outside of the downtown area. Note that the Seward Highway becomes Gambell and Ingra streets, while the Glenn Highway becomes 5th and 6th Avenues.

You'll often hear Anchorageites use the following terms when describing areas of town. These areas were originally separate communities that merged as the city grew.

*Downtown: the historic core of the city located at the northwestern tip next to the waterfront; home to most of the tourist activities, gift stores, hotels, and the railroad depot
*Midtown: the largely commercial area immediately south of Downtown roughly between 15th Avenue and Tudor Road (becoming more industrial south towards Dimond Boulevard). The heart of Midtown is largely defined by Northern Lights Boulevard and Bensen Boulevard, which run west and east respectively as one-way streets through the area. 
*South Anchorage: Dimond Boulevard and south. Largely suburban and residential with some major commercial development at the intersection of the Seward Highway and Dimond Blvd.
*West Anchorage: the area along the water southwest of Downtown, encompassing the historic Bootlegger's Cove and Turnagain residential areas and the famous Earthquake Park
*Spenard: smashed between Midtown and West Anchorage and spilling over and overlapping the boundaries a bit, it was formerly a separate city and catered to the racier aspects of Anchorage living. It's still a bit of a red-light district, especially along Spenard Road itself. Be careful at night. (The airport is at the extreme west end of the Anchorage peninsula and abuts the southwestern edge of Spenard.)
*East Anchorage: everything east of the Seward Highway and north of Tudor Road. Mostly residential; little of interest to the tourist except for the universities, hospitals, and (at the extreme northeastern corner) the Alaska Native Heritage Center.
*Hillside: part of South Anchorage, it's everything east of the Seward Highway and south of Abbott Road. Almost completely residential, and many homes there are on the ritzier side ($350k and up to over $1.5M, where the average home is about $220k). Anchorageites think of the Hillside like Angelenos do of Beverly Hills--if you own a home there, you must be doing well, even if the trees (or your snowmachine trailer) block your view of the lesser people below. Above the Hillside homes is the immense Chugach State Park, popular for easily accessible hiking. (The most-hiked mountain in Alaska, Flattop Mountain, is easily accessed via the Glen Alps parking area at the top of Upper Huffman Road.) The Alaska Zoo and the Anchorage Golf Course are two major attractions in this area. 
*Eagle River, Chugiak, Peters Creek: bedroom suburbs north of the city. Residential only, but they provide access to Chugach State Park, especially Crow Creek Pass and Eklutna Lake. Eagle River has a commercial district with gas stations, grocery stores, and the like. 
*Bird, Indian, Girdwood: small communities south of the city along the Seward Highway. Very small, tourist-service oriented. Girdwood is the home of the Alyeska Resort which is the major downhill skiing area in the area. 

Anchorage's Ted Stevens International Airport is served by all of the major national rental car chains as well as a number of independents. A few companies have off-airport locations and may even offer courtesy shuttles (though these shuttles will not pick up from the airport). Renting from these locations avoids the 11-12% airport concession recovery fee and $4.81 per day airport facility fee. If you're renting for more than a few days, it might be worth the hassle to rent your vehicle at an off-airport location, which usually involves taxi rides or shuffling between hotel and rental car courtesy shuttles. Check with each agency or search off-airport rental cars using an online travel agency to see what cost savings may be available.

If you're arriving in the summer, plan ahead, as most rental companies are pretty much sold out from mid-June through the end of August. In the summer, cars are often not available without reservations, and even if they are, be prepared to pay top-dollar for them, especially four-wheel-drive vehicles. Renting a car in Alaska can be more expensive than pretty much anywhere else in America, ranging up to (and occasionally even over) $200 per day for a large vehicle sufficient to carry multiple passengers and outdoor gear during the peak season. In the dead of the freezing winter, when tourism drops off, you can sometimes grab a vehicle for about $10 per day. Be sure to check your rental agreement. Due to harsh road conditions outside of the city, some rental companies limit how far out of the city their cars can be driven.

Some of the major car rental companies serving the Anchorage area are:

*Alamo (in-terminal): +1 907-243-3406 
*Avis (in-terminal and downtown): +1 907-243-2377 
*Budget (in-terminal and midtown): +1 907-243-0150

Most airport rental agencies are open from about 5:30AM or 6AM to about 2AM (3AM at the latest) in the peak summer season. With the number of red-eye flights serving Anchorage, it's especially important to be sure your flight doesn't arrive after your rental agency closes. None of the major chains is open 24 hours, so the only option for after-hours arrivals is a cab or hotel shuttle to an area hotel or to sleep on a bench until the agencies open.

Two main taxi companies serve the Anchorage area: Alaska Yellow Cab (+1 907-222-2222) and Checker Cab (+1 907-276-1234). The airport maintains a taxi stand on the arrivals level. As of late 2007, the municipality-set rate for all taxis is $2 are the flag drop and $2.50 per mile; time-based rate $.50 per minute. The average fare to downtown runs about $20 one-way.

Uber and Lyft also operate in the city.

Many hotels offer also courtesy shuttle vans that stop at the airport near the taxi stand. Several courtesy phone banks are located inside the baggage claim areas.

 Driving Tips

Driving in Anchorage can be challenging, especially in winter. But even during the summer, many roads are heavily damaged by severe winter conditions and the use of studded tires. Since the developed road network in Alaska is much smaller than other states, it is quite common for roads to quickly transition from well-maintained to uneven gravel and dirt tracks. Frost heaves are common, in which a patch of ice melts underneath a roadbed, creating dramatic dips in road surfaces that may damage car suspensions. Spring mud and summer rain can cause driving conditions to further decay. If you are visiting in winter and not used to driving in winter conditions, be very cautious. Drive well below the speed limit, slow down at all intersections, regardless of green lights. Avoid passing and allow plenty of extra space between your vehicle and others, and allow plenty of time to stop. If it's snowing, no matter what time of the day, have your headlights on (the Seward Highway south of Anchorage requires headlights to be on at all times). Keep in mind that a roadway covered with black ice may look completely dry but provide no traction whatsoever. Anchorage uses sand and gravel instead of salt on its highways, which means loose pebbles frequently damage windshields, making it highly recommended that travelers purchase supplemental damage insurance for rental cars. Anchorage residents may drive a bit faster than most people would want to drive on snowy roads. 
Alternate Transportation

Those determined to save money on transportation have numerous, although somewhat limited, options. Public buses, bicycling, walking/hiking, and even train travel are possible options to get around and out of the city.

 Bus 
The city's public transit system, the PeopleMover, is limited to bus travel only. The fares are $2 per trip, $5 for a day pass, $26 for a weekly pass, $60 for a monthly pass, or $660 for an annual pass. Service is generally every 30-60 minutes, with the #10, #20, #30, and #40 offering 15 minute service on weekdays. The buses can be tracked in real-time at Anchorage's bus system has a stop located at the far south end of the airport taxi stand area, served by the #40 to Downtown and #65 to Dimond Mall. For more information, call the PeopleMover Ride Line at +1 907-343-6543 at 

Numerous bus and shuttle companies also will transport travelers between Anchorage and the cruise ports at Whittier and Seward and between Anchorage and Denali National Park, although most only run during the Summer season between May and September. Prices for the trips are as low as $49 and usually include narrated guide service and/or stops along the way.

Some bus transit companies include:
* The Park Connection -- Provides connections to Denali National Park as well as the cruise ports at Seward and Whittier. Picks up in Downtown, either at the Egan Center or the Anchorage Museum. Prices range from 70-$170 per person.
* Seward Bus Lines -- Prices range from $45 to $65. The higher price includes a stop at the Alaska Wildlife Center. Picks up from 1130 W International Airport Rd in Anchorage.
* Alaska Cruise Transportation -- Connects between Seward and Anchorage with schedules aligned to meet cruise ship schedules. Picks up at Ted Stevens International Airport. Prices range from $45 - $167.
* Whittier Bus -- Connects Anchorage with both the cruise ports at Whittier and Seward. Picks up at Ted Stevens International Airport. Rates are from $40 - $68.

 Bicycle 
Anchorage features an extremely well-developed bike trail system, with over 200 miles (320 km) of developed trails (120 miles of which are paved) winding their way through dozens of parks found throughout the city. Several companies offer bike rentals and trail tours. In the winter, many of the trails are groomed and used as ski trails.

Anchorage's bike trails are loosely organized around four connected green belts. Each belt follows a major waterway through the city, providing scenic views and a bike road network separate from motorized traffic. Each trail generally begins or ends near an adjacent trail, so it is possible to travel all four trail systems in a single outing, although this would result in a one-way journey of nearly 25 miles.
* Tony Knowles Coastal Trail -- This popular trail runs along roughly 10 miles of the western coastline of the city. Starts in Downtown and ends in Kincaid Park near the airport. Features views of Cook Inlet and western mountain ranges throughout as well as wooded areas and wildlife viewing opportunities. The trail itself is well-maintained throughout its length. Most bike rental companies are located in downtown, which means this will be the easiest trail to access. Bikers can return to downtown via an inland loop circling the airport. This has some on-road sections, but passes Lake Hood, a busy and interesting seaplane base. The north half of the trail is very popular during the summer months, while the south section offers more solitude. 
* Chester Creek Trail -- Travels for 4 miles roughly east/west through the area just south of downtown. It starts at Westchester Lagoon and ends behind the University of Alaska Anchorage in the UMed district. The trail traverses a diverse landscape featuring bridges, tunnels, birch forest, and wetland meadows, but also has a reputation for attracting large camps of homeless people. Use caution when passing encampments and avoid traveling this trail at night. A branch of this trail continues east along Northern Lights Boulevard, crossing Lake Otis Parkway and Baxter Road before ending at Muldoon Road. 
* Campbell Creek Trail -- Traverses 7 miles along a winding, scenic creek ecosystem. The trail starts in the UMed district at the terminus of the Chester Creek Trail and continues southwest to Campbell Creek Lake in South Anchorage. Popular with locals, expect to share the trail with joggers, dogs, and families. The most level of all Anchorage's creek trails, so travel is less strenuous. Note that in recent years, as with Chester Creek Trail, it is possible to encounter homeless encampments along this trail. Proceed with caution when nearing encampments.
* Ship Creek Trail -- The least-traveled Anchorage greenbelt trail is also the shortest at only 2.5 miles. It starts at the mouth of Ship Creek near the Railroad depot just North of the Downtown district and travels east along the creek, ending at Tyson View Elementary school in the Mountain View neighborhood. Notable sites along the trail include the downtown salmon fishery and the William Jack Hernandez Sport Fish Hatchery, both major ingredients to Anchorage's sport fishing industry.

 Train 
While Anchorage has no subway or light rail service, the Alaska Railroad is headquartered in Anchorage and is available for trips out of the city (see Get Out section, below). Only two stops on the Alaska Railroad line are technically within the city. The main downtown depot, where most train excursions start, and the Portage Stop in the extreme southeast corner of the Municipality. However, due to the lack of amenities at the Portage station, travelers would be advised to schedule either an out-and-back trip, or continue on to better-developed destinations.

Do
Wildlife Viewing

The Anchorage area is home to moose, brown and black bears, Dall sheep, and many migratory bird species. A visitor should be able to find moose fairly easily by driving any neighborhood on Anchorage's Hillside (actually the foothills of the Chugach mountains). It is not uncommon to hear of bears being spotted in residential areas, but visitors who hope to see wild bears should plan excursions to either Denali or Katmai National Parks. Dall sheep, a species similar to the big-horn sheep found in the American Rockies, can often be spotted by driving down the Seward Highway south of Anchorage. A good way to spot sheep is to notice congregations of other tourists photographing them. A good place to view waterfowl and eagles is Potter's Marsh, located immediately south of Anchorage on the Seward Highway. 

Hiking/Biking

While the greenbelt system welcomes walkers and joggers, the city also has extensive hiking trails in its massive park networks. Trail options accommodate any experience level and time constraint. Shorter strolls of a half-mile or less are numerous while longer, more challenging routes like 23-mile are available for the more adventurous. One of the best places to walk or bike to get to know Anchorage would have to be the Tony Knowles Coastal Trail. Awesome views. 

* Chugach State Park -- Most notable among Anchorage's parklands is the enormous . This mammoth 495,000-acre park is entirely within city limits, making it the largest city park in the world. The Flattop mountain trail (1.5-3 hours), the most popular alpine trail in the state, is located in Chugach State Park. The trailhead can be found by driving east on O'Malley Road (south Anchorage) and following signs for Glen Alps. A shuttle also provides round-trip transportation between downtown and the trailhead for $22, Flattop Mountain Shuttle Parking is $5 for those staying longer than 30 minutes. Note that some find this trail to be challenging due to the steep rock scrambling near the mountain's summit. Crowds at Flattop can be considerable, by Alaska standards, but many other trails branch from the Glenn Alps parking area where the Flat Top trail also begins. There is also a mountain biking trail leading up towards Powerline Pass. This is a great place to see moose in the summer and offers the best view of the city of Anchorage within a 5-minute walk of the Glen Alps parking lot. All the trails are well maintained and there is little risk of being lost in the immediate area, however, for the maximum experience it's a good idea to bring water and plan your hike with a great guide such as "55 Ways to the Wilderness", Southcentral Alaska or Chugach State Park editions, available online or at any local Alaskan bookseller. In the fall, Flattop Mountain is covered with wild blueberries. 
* Kincaid Park -- Overlooking a coastal highland on Anchorage's west shore, Kincaid Park is a mecca for day-trippers seeking untouched virgin forest and both paved and unpaved walking and hiking. The sprawling trails at Kincaid can be confusing, so newcomers should plan to stick to paved trails unless traveling with a guide. Additional activities include mountain bike trails and frisbee golf in the Summer and world-class cross-country ski trails in the Winter.
* Far North Bicentennial Park -- Often considered a well-kept secret among locals, the 4,000 acre Far North Bicentennial Park is nearly five times larger than New York's Central Park and conceals numerous amenities within its green canopy of trees. Hikers can enjoy extensive trails and even enjoy tracing the path of winter dog mushing track. Also available is a Botanic Garden, playgrounds, creeks, and numerous wildlife viewing opportunities.

Alyeska often has the highest annual snowfall of any ski area in North America and has a wide array of intermediate and expert terrain. Beginner terrain is fairly limited, but Alyeska has a fairly good ski and snowboard instruction program so it is not a bad place to learn.

*Hilltop Ski Area is in south Anchorage about 15 minutes from downtown. It is a fairly small area in the Chugach foothills with one chairlift and a surface lift and exclusively beginner terrain.

*Alpenglow at Arctic Valley is a volunteer operated resort with two chairlifts and a T-bar. While the terrain is not as steep as some of the expert-only terrain at Alyeska, it is not for beginners and the snow is often windblown and hard. Alpenglow offers free lift tickets for volunteers, and thus is a great option for skiers and budget travelers.

*Hillberg Ski Area is on Elmendorf Airforce Base to the north of downtown Anchorage, and is technically open to the public. Civilians who don't have authorization to enter the base must be signed in and escorted by someone who does. Hillberg has only beginner terrain, but tends to have shorter lift lines than Hilltop making it a better option for people who can get access.

Eat

For a city its size, Anchorage has a remarkable diversity of restaurants, both in terms of cuisine and price. Long-time residents will often tell tales of beloved and long gone eateries, many of which flourished during the oil boom years of the 1970s and early 1980s. Even with a slower pace of growth, Anchorage can boast of a range of dining options to suit any diner.

Budget
* Basic diner, inexpensive ($4 - $15 per person), from Ted's Big Breakfast to Jenne's Reindeer Sandwich to the homemade Giant Cinnamon Rolls, you can't go wrong. Its home cooking. 
* Remarkably good Himalayan and Indian cuisine in Spenard. Five minutes from the airport. Check the hours online, they are often closed. 
* Good, cheap Hawaiian and Tongan food. Another location on Fireweed. 
* An Alaskan institution and consistently voted Anchorage's best burger. Kitschy Alaskana on the walls, including plaques and portraits of longtime Alaskans and longtime Arctic Roadrunner customers. Try the halibut burger and homemade onion ring pieces. In the summer, the outdoor seating next to Campbell Creek is very pleasant. Family friendly. Cash only; "no checks since 1972." ATM located inside. 
* Run by local celebrity "Chef Al" Levinsohn, famous for his other restaurant in town (Kincaid Grill). 
* An Alaskan institution; must be seen to be understood. Down home Americana meets Alaska (think sourdough pancakes and reindeer sausage). Popular with the locals for good prices and big portions. Old-time Alaskan rusty things hanging on the walls. 

*Possibly the best (and fastest) Mexican food in Anchorage (holds its own against places closer to the border) and with great (for Alaska) prices if you get the right thing. 
* An Anchorage standard famous for their pan-friend chicken but also serving one of the better burgers in town.
* Routinely voted the best burgers and philly sandwiches in Anchorage.

*Vietnamese/Thai restaurant known for their large portion sizes. They also have additional locations in Downtown, Boniface, and Northway Mall. 
* A local counter service chain similar to Chipotle or Qdoba known for serving up some excellent tacos.

*VIP Restaurant is known for being one of the best Korean restaurants in Alaska. Be sure to try their bibimbap and bulgogi.
* The place is not much more than a small kitchen and a counter with room for 10 patrons. Arguably better burgers and definitely better halibut sandwiches than Arctic Roadrunner. Study the menu carefully before daring to order, or Sheri will put you in your place. The food is way worth the attitude, though.

Mid range
* A wonderful pizza location, similar to the Moose's Tooth described below (although the menu differs a bit). It also features a movie theater in which you can eat dinner (they deliver it right to your seat) and imbibe from the wide selection of microbrews and wines. It mainly plays art house films and those that have been released for some time. It's a great place to spend an evening before taking a red-eye flight out of Anchorage as it's quite close to the Anchorage airport. Buy tickets in advance on the weekends--it can be very busy. The attached Bear Tooth Grill offers very different but equally delicious choices in a more traditional bar/grill restaurant setting. 
* Mexican restaurant located at the intersection of Tudor Road and Old Seward Highway that serves up some excellent enchiladas, tacos, etc. They also offer free delivery.
* A very popular place to eat in downtown Anchorage. Wide selection of food, impressive selection of beers from their brewery. Hard to go wrong with this one if you're looking for a place to eat downtown. 
 
*Sushi bar known for their lunch specials and generous portions.
* Brews their own beer and makes some fantastic pizza (all-ages welcome). Good atmosphere and walls covered with memorabilia about Alaska and beer. Can be busy. Frequently has outdoor concerts during the summer on the first Thursday of every month ("first tap" is age 21+). Must-go if you like beer. Has vegetarian selections. Medium prices; it's possible to save by splitting a large pizza. Menu and beer list online.
* Semi-fancy seafood restaurant and bar. On the expensive side, but it's worth it to get some of the best seafood in Alaska (and being Anchorage, there's no dress code). They also have excellent non-seafood selections and a great lunch menu. One of the best views of any Anchorage restaurant; you can also see the sunset over the water by the window. Menus online. 
* While not as popular as Glacier BrewHouse, Solstice Bar & Grill offers meals of a similar quality for a slightly cheaper price. Located in the lobby level of the Westmark Hotel (almost directly across from the BrewHouse), this restaurant can get quite busy during the summer breakfast and dinner times, as Westmark plays host to a number of cruise line guests (its parent company is Holland America Line).
* Fresh seafood and innovative preparations of meats and lighter fare make this a great stop for those heading south or those wanting to get away from the hustle of the touristy areas. Bar with microbrews and a good wine list.
* Open for breakfast and lunch only, except on Wednesdays when there is an excellent Irish jam (and sometimes dance!) from 7PM-11PM. There is often a long wait for a table and for good reason, food is fresh and affordable, breakfast is available all day and there are plenty of hearty fares for the health-conscious.

Splurge
* Club Paris, 417 W. 5th Avenue, between D and E Streets, +1 907-277-6332, An Anchorage institution founded before statehood. Known for its seafood and, in particular, for some of the best steaks in Anchorage. 
* Crow's Nest, 4th and K (top floor of Hotel Captain Cook), +1 907 276-6000, AAA four-diamond rating and Wine Spectator awards. Seafood, "French and American" cuisine. View of entire city and Chugach Mountains. Definitely a splurge. Wine sommelier on staff; 10,000 bottle cellar. Dress code: Business casual. Good place to impress a date. 
* Jens, 701 W 36th Ave (in a strip mall at 36th and Arctic next to a Scandinavian furniture store), +1 907 561-5367, A superb menu of Alaskan seafood with a twist, Danish specialties, and French classics that changes daily. Bar and good wine selection.
* ORSO Ristorante, 5th Ave between H and G Sts, +1 907 222-3232, Located right next to and owned by the same company as Glacier BrewHouse, this restaurant offers higher-priced meals inspired by traditional Italian fare. Located in the same block as a number of art galleries and smaller boutique shops, one can keep occupied while waiting (which in the summer season, is typical). 
* Ginger, 425 W 5th Ave, +1 907 929-3680, New restaurant. Trendy, modern, upscale dining. Sort of an Asian-Alaskan fusion, with things like wasabi mashed potatoes. Extensive sake list. Try the fries for an appetizer; they're freshly made and delicious.

Drink 
Anchorage has many, many bars. Bars must close by 2:30AM M-F, 3AM Sa & Su under municipal law. Bars can stay open until 5AM in the cities of and , about 45 minutes north. Anchorage also probably has more micro-breweries per capita than anywhere else (except maybe Portland, OR).

All bars and restaurants in Anchorage are non-smoking.
* This is a fashionable and friendly "martini-and-cigar" type of place. Good place to sit outside on the lawn in the summer, or to go upstairs to the Paradise Room for a fancy place to have a drink (although the upstairs is often booked for private gatherings). It's popular with well-dressed young people and businesspeople (during the daytime). The evening crowd is generally younger and the bar is embracing a larger hip-hop crowd. Usually busiest after midnight.
* This is the largest bar within about 1,400 miles (2200 km). It's a huge spot that is always busy on weekends. The outside facade is deceptively small - there is a map on their website to navigate through all 10+ bars. There is usually at least one band playing every night (and usually a cover charge). Popular place to pick up dates, if you can hear above the noise.
* A quintessential "dive bar," Darwin's is popular with the locals. If you're interested in avoiding the generic tourist watering holes, Darwin's will wet your whistle. It's just a basic corner bar.
* Humpy's has dozens of beers on tap and a great pub food selection (esp. seafood) until midnight. It's popular with just about everyone. Beer-battered halibut -- yum!

Stay safe

As with any major American city, keep your eyes open and your wits about you. Crime is relatively low in most parts of Anchorage that you're likely to visit however crime can still be a issue. 
Certain areas in the northeast of the city (Mountain View, north of the Glenn Highway and east of Merrill Field airport) and central (Fairview, 6th to 15th Avenue, east of Ingra) have higher crime than other spots. 

As in all other cities these crimes receive a disproportionate amount of attention from local media. These tragic events, however, are typically not random so they will probably not impact your visit. You are more likely to be a victim of crimes of opportunity, however most violent crimes in Anchorage are usually domestic disputes.

Also, areas around the airport like Spenard are known for increased drug activity and prostitution. In earlier times, the downtown area around 4th Avenue was like that, but a concerted effort over the last eight years has mostly cleaned it up. 

A constant problem is car break-ins at parking lots. Do not make leave any valuables visible.

The trails close to and around the university are unsafe when it is dark. During the colder months there are increased attacks on females going to and from the housing and library. 

Also, stay a good distance away from the moose. Although they may appear harmless, they can and will protect their young ones from people, and can charge if they feel cornered or threatened. Never approach them, as they are best viewed from a distance. 

Still, if you follow precautions like everywhere else, you will be safe.

Get out 

There are only two roads out of Anchorage, the Seward Highway which goes south to the Kenai Peninsula, and the Glenn Highway which goes northeast to Glennallen and continues as the Tok Cutoff to Tok where it ends at the Alaska Highway. The Glenn Highway junctions with the George Parks Highway about 40 miles north of Anchorage, continuing northwest to Denali National Park and Fairbanks. Driving from Anchorage to Fairbanks usually takes 6-8 hours (356 miles) and driving from Anchorage to Seattle, WA usually takes at least 3 days, although 5 days is a much more realistic pace.

The Alaska Railroad offers daily service between Anchorage/Seward, Anchorage/Whittier, and Anchorage/Fairbanks during the summer. The Anchorage/Fairbanks run (Aurora) offers flag drop service - it is the only railroad in the U.S. that will pick you up if you flag the train from the side of the tracks, though this only applies north of .

There are numerous small plane flying services which have scheduled flights to small villages, or the capacity to charter flights to different villages. For travel to villages outside of the south central region it is usually cheaper to take a regular commercial flight to the the appropriate regional hub (Bethel, Unalakleet, Dillingham, Unalaska, Kotzebue, Nome, Barrow, Fairbanks, or Juneau) and arrange to fly from there to your destination.
