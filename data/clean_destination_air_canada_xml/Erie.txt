Erie is a city of about 100,000 in Northwestern . It is Pennsylvania's only lake port on the (Lake Erie).

Understand
Erie is the fourth largest metropolitan area in the state of Pennsylvania. However, in terms of size and stature, there is a clear gulf between the first and second cities ( and ) and the second-tier cities, like Erie, Allentown, Scranton/, and . Erie is roughly in the center of Pennsylvania's only coastline, bordering Lake Erie. The city itself sits on Presque Isle Bay, which is formed by a long, narrow peninsula known as Presque Isle that reaches from the west around the north of the city.

Erie was founded in 1795 after the purchase of the surrounding territory from . It made its mark on history during the early 19th century when Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry's small fleet of warships used the bay (then known as Misery Bay) to regroup and repair between skirmishes with the British fleet on Lake Erie. (A reconstruction of the Brig "Niagara" can be found at the Erie Maritime Museum.)

The late nineteenth century brought industrial development, primarily heavy equipment, and the locomotive industry. Like many other cities in the so-called rust belt, this development has slowly withered away to outside competition, with the notable exception being General Electric, which maintains a large and active presence in the rail industry (GE Rail).

Erie's climate is similar to most of the Northern United States, but with a big winter twist known as lake effect snow. Snowfall amounts vary wildly within a 40-mile zone south of the lake. Most of the time the immediate vicinity of the lake receives light snowfall, and the range from three to fifteen miles receives a whollop. Snowfalls are also generally heavier as you go east. The NY/PA border region typically receives the most snow until you move far enough away from the lake for the effects to diminish. The roads are well maintained, but some snow squalls come on so suddenly, that it is impossible to keep up. If you are driving in the winter, be prepared with emergency gear. The good news is that by January, it is often cold enough for Lake Erie to freeze over, greatly diminishing the lake effect.

Get in

By plane
Erie is within a two-hour drive of Buffalo-Niagara, Cleveland-Hopkins, and Pittsburgh International Airports. Erie International Airport () is a medium airport that is worth considering. The airport is served by three major airlines: United (via Chicago-O'Hare), Delta (via Detroit), and US Airways (via Charlotte). Bargains can be had and the airport itself is a breeze to navigate, get in and out of, and also has a full complement of car rental agencies on-site. Parking is easy and will cost less than $3 if you stay in the lot for over an hour. (Erie's airport is not large enough to justify a competitive parking market like most larger airports have - park on-site, get a friend to drive, or take a cab/bus.)

By bus
Erie has a newly built Greyhound Bus Station located right across from the Library and Maritime Museum. Buses come and go frequently from and . Erie can even be accessed from , , and typically with only one transfer. City buses stop at the station, so you can visit parts of the city without a taxi or car, although you will have less freedom.

By train

Amtrak serves the downtown Union Station, although this is not a common method of transportation. The eastbound (Chicago-Toledo-Cleveland-Buffalo-Albany-New York) train arrives at 7:24 AM, and the westbound (New York-Albany-Buffalo-Cleveland-Toledo-Chicago) train arrives at 2:16 AM, making the train a rather inconvenient way to get to the city.

By car

Erie is easily accessible via Interstate 90 and 79. The recently completed Bayfront Connector Highway links the northern terminus of I-79 through the city along the bayfront and then through the industrial Eastside and newer housing and office developments around Knowledge Park and Penn State University (Behrend College). The new highway (completed Summer 2005) is 3-4 lanes but has few buildings or side streets that connect directly with the road, making traffic relatively smooth and making it much easier to get in and out of the downtown. The completed highway is a scenic detour away from the traffic and strip malls of I-90 south of Erie.

Get around
By car
Erie is laid out in an easy-to-understand grid pattern paralleling the Lake Erie coastline. Numbered streets starting with the northernmost 2nd Street run roughly east-west. (The bayfront highway loops around this grid, taking the place of what would be a "1st Street". Major E/W thoroughfares are 6th, 12th, 26th, and 38th Street. The center of town is split north-south by State Street. N/S streets on the west side of town are typically named after trees (Peach, Poplar, Chestnut) and on the east side after countries (French, German, Holland). The two major north-south routes through the center of town are State and Peach (Peach diverges to the southwest after 26th street.) Major N/S streets listed from west to east are Pittsburgh, Greengarden, Liberty, Chestnut, Peach, State, French, Parade, and East. As you can see, this naming convention is not hard and fast and breaks down in all directions the further you get from the city center. The suburbs of Fairview, Millcreek, Harborcreek, Lawrence Park, and Wesleyville also stick to this rough grid pattern to some degree as you move away from the city.

By bus
Bus (EMTA service primarily stretches from Fairview in the west to Harborcreek in the east, and south to the I-90/Peach Street shopping district. Regional shuttles connect the outlying communities of Edinboro, Waterford, Corry, Union City, Girard, and Albion. EMTA is available by phone at +1 814 452-3515.

By taxi
Taxis are rare in Erie - apart from the airport and perhaps the very center of town, calling ahead is a must. Uber operates in the city of Erie, so using it is also viable.

See
*Bicentennial Tower. Constructed in 1995 to celebrate Erie's Bicentennial, the tower stands about 100 feet high and one can easily see out to or over Erie. Located at the foot of State Street.
*The Erie Art Museum hosts over 5,000 pieces of art on State Street, along with 18-20 traveling exhibits annually.
* A good place to get a hands-on look at an early 19th century sailing warship. The U.S.S. Niagara is typically in port but does travel to historical events all across the Great Lakes region, so consider calling ahead or driving by to see if she's around.
*A great zoo comparable to those of larger cities. Summer educational programs for children. Fun train ride though the zoo; great for the kids or kids at heart.
*A small fire station built in 1903, it was used during the age when firefighters used horses to pull a hose on a cart. The horses were used here until 1921 and the fire station closed in 1974. Inside the museum, you can see various contraptions firefighters used to put out fires before the firetruck existed. Hours of operation are limited, but you can call to schedule an appointment during other times.
*A historic mansion built on "Millionaire's Row" in 1891.

Do
*
*The Erie Philharmonic is an orchestra that plays a variety of concerts at the Warner Theatre on State Street, which is on the National Register of Historic Places for its Art Deco style. Tickets can be ordered online, and they go well in advance.
*Erie's oldest theater group, producing around 12 shows per year. Musicals, comedies, dramas, concerts, and youth theater are common events. Shows run Thursdays through Sundays as a general rule
* Go back to the mainland and see the shoreline. The drive (or boat ride) around Lake Erie takes you through the Working Waterfronts around NY, OH, MI, PA, , OH, and southern and is intermingled with beautiful preservations of flora and fauna as well as the history of North America's first westward expansion, the Old Northwest Territory.
*
*Situated on a peninsula starting from about four miles west of downtown and then going north and east approximately ten miles. Most of the lakeside of the peninsula is made up of sandy beaches. The bayside provides launching docks for boats and spots to fish. A fourteen-mile paved exercise and bike trail runs the entire length of the peninsula offering views of the lake beaches and wildlife refuges. Bicycles and boats are available for rental in and around the park. There is also a nature cruise starting near the Perry monument, on the southeastern side of the park. With free entry, copious parking, and miles of beaches, it's not hard to see why this park is the most visited state park in Pennsylvania, averaging over a million guests a year.
*It is another great place to take the kids. Located immediately off of I-90 on Peach Street, this indoor waterpark operates year-round.
*The Tom Ridge Environmental Center (TREC) is an educational center at heart, dedicated to teaching visitors about the unique 3,200 acres of Presque Isle and the many different forms of life that inhabit the peninsula. TREC also serves as a center for research, contributing to conservation efforts and promoting environmental awareness, helping to preserve the unparalleled beauty of Presque Isle, the site of Pennsylvania’s only seashore. While some facilities along the Great Lakes offer environmental education and others do research, none offer research, education, and visitor services in one place, making TREC a unique destination for learning, wonder, and fun. We’re open year-round and offer free admission to our interactive exhibits, glass-enclosed tower, and orientation movie. Learn about the history of Presque Isle and how you can contribute to keeping it pristine and beautiful.

Events

Buy
The main shopping area in Erie is centered around Peach Street, south of the city to its junction with I-90. Many of the typical national chains can be found, many of which are contained in Millcreek Mall, a sprawling single-story mall/strip complex.

Smaller niche shopping is available on the west side of the city in plazas on West 8th, 12th, and 26th Streets. The downtown also has a few stores but has not been a large retail draw since the late 1970s. 

Erie is a popular shopping destination because of Pennsylvania's waiver of sales tax on clothing. Many people from the surrounding states and Ontario make special trips to Erie for this reason.

Eat
Erie has a few local foods unique to the area that you might want to try:

*Greek Sauce - It's kind of like hot dog chili, but with different spices, and usually put on hot dogs and hamburgers, as well as other things. New York Lunch-East Avenue has the 'original' Greek Sauce, and many would agree that theirs is the best.
*Ox Roast - thinly sliced beef cooked in a beef broth, usually eaten as an Ox Roast Sandwich.
*Pepperoni Balls and Pepperoni Bread - Italian Bread with pepperoni baked inside.
*Smith's Hot Dogs - A hot dog brand local to the area that is very tasty. They are so well-liked that there are stories of people from Erie who moved to other parts of the country having Smith's Hot Dogs overnighted to their new home. Good for camping and grilling out.

There are plenty of chain restaurants in Erie as well as ethnic and local places to eat. Peach Street has a large concentration of restaurants as does downtown Erie.

Sleep
Hotels are concentrated along the heavily traveled Interstate 90 corridor, primarily at the Peach and State St. exits. There are also a number of chain and locally-based hotels and motels along Interstate 79 north of I-90 and to the west on 12th and 26th streets towards Presque Isle. Finally, the downtown offers a third option, offering anything from barebones motels to full-service hotels to bed and breakfasts.
* 
* Rodeway Inn Erie is most preferred place to stay for its spacious clean & well maintained rooms available at an affordable price.
* Great campsite located on the water and adjacent to Presque Isle State Park. Pitch your tent right on the beach or in a designated site in the woods. There's also RV parking.
* Accommodations include complimentary Internet, flat screen TV, and pantry area. Guests will also have access to complimentary hot breakfast, complimentary parking, indoor pool and fitness center.

Stay safe
As in the rest of North America, the emergency number for fire, police, and ambulatory services is 911. The city of Erie is served by the Erie City Police Department, while Millcreek is served by the Millcreek Township Police Department. All ambulatory services are served by EmergyCare.

Erie, for the most part, is safe, and an average tourist will have no problems with violent crime, especially in Millcreek, where the mall and other shopping areas are. The East Side, especially near lower Parade Street, can be more urban and rough, but the people are mainly working-class immigrants for the most part, and will not cause a problem. Near the General Electric plant near Harborcreek, however, the depressed, formerly industrial neighborhoods can breed much in the way of criminal activity; it's recommended that a tourist avoid these areas, although these areas do not offer much in the way of what a visitor would wish to see, to begin with.

Erie has, like many other parts of the United States, experienced a drastic uptick in opioid and heroin usage among people of all walks of life. It should go without saying, but do not accept any manner of illicit drug, and watch for discarded needles on the ground in seedier areas of the city.

Perry Square in Erie's urban core has multiple bars that are frequented on weekends by rowdy college kids from Gannon and middle-aged professionals; one must be extremely careful when driving downtown overnight, especially after the final call at 1:30 AM.

Other than these notes, one should just use common sense; avoid flashing expensive articles while in thickly populated areas such as downtown Erie.
