Naples (Italian: Napoli, Neapolitan: Napule), in southern , is the capital of the region. Naples is a major port city in the center of the ancient Mediterranean region. The city is the third most populated municipality (city proper) and a metropolitan area in Italy. 

Districts

Naples used to be divided into 30 quartieri (neighborhoods), however today these neighborhoods don't hold much administrative use but are still used by locals to refer to parts of the city. Nowadays the city is divided into 10 municipalities. However, this page will divide Naples into 5 districts and regions on the point of view of the traveler.

Understand
Both Naples and the local Italian Napoli are acceptable; either way, it's a derivative of the ancient Greek name Neapolis, which means new city. The Greeks first established the city and inhabited the region long before Roman times.

One of the main sources of Naples' economic importance is the Port of Naples, which is one of the largest and busiest in the Mediterranean Sea. A second major driver of the local economy is tourism. Naples has been a major tourist destination since the 1700s and is today seen hundreds of thousands of people visiting the city's landmarks and enjoying its warm, Mediterranean climate every year.

The most widely spoken language in Naples is Italian or a mixture of Italian and Napulitano (Neapolitan). Neapolitan is sometimes described as an Italian dialect, but may be considered a separate language and can sometimes be unintelligible to the general Italian speaker. Neapolitan does not enjoy any official status, but it does have a rich literary tradition and it is still thriving in Campania and adjacent parts of Lazio, Abruzzo, Basilicata, Molise, and Calabria. This said, the official language of Naples (as of all of Italy) is Italian and everyone speaks it.

Neapolitans have strong Spanish and French influences originating from their occupation of the area. Therefore, more Spanish and French words are understood by the locals than in other parts of Italy. English is the most commonly spoken foreign language, although the average knowledge of English is far from excellent.

Like in the rest of Italy, Catholicism is the religion of the majority of its citizens, with pockets of minorities such as Christian Orthodoxy (mostly practiced by immigrant communities from Eastern Europe), Islam, and Buddhism (Naples hosts one of Italy's biggest vihara). However, unlike much of Italy, Catholicism in Naples has notoriously a much more outward form of devotion, with shrines and sacred icons being a ubiquitous sight throughout the central districts, and the cult of San Gennaro being especially visible. Neapolitan devotion however needs to be seen not much as fanatic religiosity but rather in the frame of the larger "superstitious" attitude that historically characterizes the locals, much of which is rooted in pre-Christian practices. In fact, it is not uncommon to see icons of saints juxtaposed for sale or for worship with more "profane" amulets and lucky charms such as the Neapolitan corno.

Naples' patron saint is San Gennaro (Januarius in Latin) celebrated on 19 September. So, the city has many places related to it as Duomo di San Gennaro, the Catacombe of San Gennaro, the Gate of San Gennaro, Obelisco di San Gennaro, St. Gennaro Treasury Museum, or Toledo metro station colorful mosaic with a procession guided by St. Gennaro. At last, the reason Neapolitans get along with the threat of Vesuvius and the fatal end of Pompeii and Herculaneum is that until now it is believed that the city has been protected by the miracle of San Gennaro's blood. Neapolitans fill the Duomo twice a year to ensure that the saint's blood liquefies in the ampoule which ensures safety from the eruption of the volcano.

History
The city of Naples is thought to be one of the oldest continually inhabited cities on the planet, but its recorded history began when Greek settlers established colonies in the area during the second millennium B.C. Later, another colony called Parthenope was founded by more Greek colonists from the Aegean island of Rhodes during the 9th century B.C. Parthenope eventually declined, however, and the true beginning of Naples (as such) was found in the new Greek settlement called Neapolis during the 6th century B.C. Naples's history can be traced back over 2,800 years to the 8th century BC. 

Naples was founded between the 7th and 6th centuries BC by the Greeks and was named Neapolis, which means a new city. The historic center of Naples has earned the denomination. It has one of the biggest historical city centers in the world, and its pride is the 448 historical and monumental churches, the highest number in the World for a single city. 

Neapolis became of major importance within the Greek Mediterranean empire called Magna Graecia (Greater Greece) and an important center of trade. It allied itself with Rome against Carthage during the Punic Wars and again during the war with the Italian Samnite tribe. Ultimately, Naples (Neapolis) became a Roman colony and a key portal through which Greek culture entered Italy and merged with Roman culture.

After the Western Roman Empire fell to the Germanic barbarians in the 5th century A.D., Naples fell first to the Ostrogoths, then to the Byzantines, and then became an independent duchy. By 763 it had fallen under Papal control but regained its independence around A.D. 800. Naples then engaged in numerous local feuds with adjacent kingdoms, until the 11th Century, when it hired Norman mercenaries to gain the upper hand. By 1137, however, the Normans took control of Naples itself along with much of the Italian Peninsula.

Around 1266, Naples became united with Sicily as part of the new Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, and soon, it was made the capital of the new kingdom. Sicily and Naples were then divided and reunited several times over the next few centuries and were, at points, under the Iberian Kingdom of Aragon. Around 1501, Naples came under Spanish control, but after passing again through numerous masters, it was finally again the independent Kingdom of Naples. Naples later became a strong proponent of the Italian unification movement and joined modern Italy in 1861.

Much of the cityscape of modern Naples was built under Mussolini's fascist regime and also during the reconstruction era following World War II. Although Naples never revolted against Mussolini, it was the first city in Italy to rebel against the Nazi occupation and was also the most-bombed city in all of Italy. The city was liberated by American and British forces on October 1, 1943.

Between 1950 and 1984, Naples received financial assistance from the Italian government under The Fund of the South to help it rebuild. In 1980 Naples area was hit by the last and most damaging earthquake. Since then, Naples has continued to build: it constructed a massive business district, a highly advanced city transport system, and a high-speed rail link to both Rome and Salerno. It has also boomed economically and seen unemployment drop. Naples now has the fourth-largest economy of any urban zone in Italy, has one of the busiest sea ports in the Mediterranean, and ranks as the 103rd most wealthy city on the planet.

Sure, the city has a bad reputation concerning the Mafia, and trash crisis (the worst is actually over) and many parts of the city are impoverished and really dangerous, but if you look even further than that and exercise a lot of caution, you will find a vibrant city with plenty to see and do, a city where the large influx of tourists like in Rome, Venice, Florence etc. have not happened (for now) and have thus allowed the city to retain much of its original culture, allowing you to visit a hidden gem just 2 hours south of Rome. Its territory, particularly the iconic sight of the Gulf of Naples (but also Mount Vesuvius, the music, etc.) is arguably one of the most powerful symbolic images of Italy.

Population
Naples's 2023 estimated population is at 2,179,384 though Greater Naples' population was much higher at 3.1 million. This makes the Naples Metropolitan Area the third most populous in all of Italy after and . Historically, Naples grew from 621,000 in 1901 to 1.2 million in 1971 but then declined to its current number as many city residents began to move out into the suburbs.

*Naples has a relatively high birth rate of 10.5 per 1,000. The birth rate in Italy as a whole is 9.5 per 1,000.

Get in
By plane
Naples is served by Naples Airport, also known as Capodichino Airport () 

From the airport you can take a bus for €5 (called Alibus) which has two stops only: Stazione Centrale (Central station), where there is a subway station, and Piazza Municipio, near the main ferry port (Molo Beverello). You can buy your ticket on the bus. Further connections are listed on this page of the official website Some notes: The Alibus ticket is €5 if you buy it from the driver on the bus. Ask the driver / check the signs to make sure you board the correct bus. Schedule 

If you have time to spare, you can take the 3S bus that will take you to the same stops as the Alibus for a cheaper price. The difference is that the Alibus has limited stops but the 3S will take you to the backstreets leading to the Stazione continuing all the way to the port and a shopping district. Also, the Alibus is airconditioned whereas most 3S buses are not.

Beware of illegal, unauthorized taxis and of anyone who may approach you directly. Authorized taxis are clearly visible at the exit; fixed fares exist for a number of destinations, and must be clearly shown in the cab. Make sure they are before getting in the cab and threaten to call the police ("polizia") should the taxi driver try to push back.

By train
The main station is Napoli Centrale - Piazza Garibaldi Station, connected to the Naples subway system. The buses R2 or 601 from the Piazza Garibaldi in front of the train station will take you within three blocks of the ferries at Stazione Marittima. Other stations include Mergellina, a magnificent Art Déco building, and Campi Flegrei. The costs of trains from/to Rome vary a lot, ranging from a 27€ 3-hour regional train to a 1-hour 10-minute high-speed FrecciaRossa starting at 52€ The new high-speed train Italo (provided by the private company NTV) offers prices of 30-53€).

By bus
Many national and international private bus services operate in Naples, generally stopping at Piazza Garibaldi or Piazza Municipio.

By car
Naples is directly connected with by the A1 highway, and the trip takes generally less than 2 hours. Due to traffic jams and parking shortages in the city center, it's advisable to leave your car in a parking lot near the motorway exit or your accommodation and to use public transportation

By boat
 dock at Stazione Marittima, a large terminal located right in the city center, near Piazza Municipio.

*MedMar Group operates several large ferry/passenger ships that connect Naples with (), (), (), and the . These trips usually leave in the late afternoon or evening and arrive at their destination the next morning. 

*Tirrenia Navigazione operates an overnight ferry service that has two separate routes, one to Sardinia () and the other to ().

Get around
Armed with a street map, the savvy traveler can see most of central Naples on foot but for more remote places you have to use transport. Be forewarned: Traffic in Naples may be extremely heavy, just to compare: it very similar to New York or Bangkok. Traffic around the train station is nuts. Before attempting to cross the street, observe the locals. The idea is to spot a gap in the traffic and start across and hopefully, people will stop. 

There are several ways to see Naples and the surrounding area. These include by taxi, train, subway, funicular, bus, and in rare cases ferry or boat.

Taxis are the quickest way to see Naples, but also the most expensive. Before getting into a taxi, make sure it is licensed. Licensed taxis will have a city crest on the door and a taxi number. Also, make sure it has a meter.
By law, licensed taxis must display a list of pre-agreed fares in a number of languages (Italian, English, French, German, Spanish). Check the presence of such fares and agree to them before starting the journey.

You will be surprised how easily you can get around on foot, too. Interesting spots are almost on every corner and most distances – especially in the – are small and can easily be walked in a matter of minutes. 

By public transportation on land
It is fairly difficult to get a clear picture of the public transportation system in Naples since different lines are operated by different companies. Tickets are available for 90 minutes or for daily, weekly, monthly, and annual travel. Biglietto Orario (hourly): €1.50 (valid for 90 minutes from the time the ticket is validated). Biglietto Giornaliero (daily): €4.50 (valid until midnight on the day the ticket is validated) The Unico Campania pass banner which has great integrated maps of the various lines in the city on their website. Naples Sightseeing Pass

*Metropolitana di Napoli There are three lines of underground subway in Naples. Many subway stations are regarded as fine examples of contemporary architecture and artistic urban decoration, being part of the Stazioni dell'Arte project. They are generally safer than other public transport because they are always monitored by cameras and security officers. But the subway does not run frequently, so do not rely on it if you are in a hurry. The most important ones:
:*Linea 1, built recently, connects the city center to the hill quarters, like Vomero and the hospital area. 
:*Linea 2, much older, connects the three main train stations to Pozzuoli. The tracks are shared with the ordinary railway.
:*Linea 6, a new light subway connecting Fuorigrotta to Mergellina.

*Funicolare The subway company also operates four cable cars: three of them connect the city center to Vomero, and the last connects Mergellina to Posillipo.

*Trams ANM operates three tram lines (1, 2, and 4), of which one goes along the shore of Castelnuovo - Garibaldi (Central Station).

*Buses ANM also operated all bus lines within Naples, most of which are circular. Naples suffers from a serious problem of traffic jams and usually buses are overcrowded, so if you can (unless in the evening or on the weekend) try to avoid them. Another point to note is that unlike in Rome, tickets are not sold on buses. The bus company assigns staff to check if a passenger has a ticket. The staff members are notorious for targeting at tourists who are unfamiliar with the ticket-selling system. Once they see the tourists get into a bus, they will ask to see a ticket. No matter how much you explain, they will insist on getting your passport first and then require you to pay a penalty of 41.2 euros. If you do not pay, they will threaten to call the police. Again, if you can, try to avoid taking a bus.

There are three different regional train services that operate in Naples and the surrounding areas. They are listed here:

*Circumvesuviana. The Circumvesuviana railway operates from "Napoli Porta Nolana - Corco Garibaldi" and stops at the lower level of the central train station at Piazza Garibaldi and has six routes that service the local Naples area. One route goes from Naples to Sorrento with several stops in between, including Ercolano (Herculaneum) and Pompei Scavi (Pompeii) for the ruins. Another route travels around Vesuvius. Other routes go to Acerra and Nola-Baiano. The Circumvesuviana website has more information on timings, routes, and cost of tickets. When buying tickets please note that the Circumvesuviana is run by EAV so the Trenitalia machines around the station will NOT work for your tickets so don't waste your (and other people waiting for the machine's) time - you need to line up and buy your ticket from the windows near the platforms. If you are going to Sorrento be careful to check the display announcing train arrivals and departures to be sure you are boarding the route to Sorrento and not Sarno!

*Cumana. This rail line that operates from Montesanto in Naples and follows the coastline for approximately 20 km before ending in Torregaveta (Bacoli). The Cumana runs the urban centers of Montesanto, Fuorigrotta, Bagnoli, Pozzuoli, Arco Felice, Baia, and Fusaro before reaching Torregaveta. 

*Circumflegrea. This rail line also starts in Montesanto and ends in Torregaveta. However, it runs along the western edge of Naples through the districts Soccavo, Pianurat, Quarto Flegreo, Licola, and Cuma. It is also approximately seven kilometers longer than the Cumana. because the Cumana and Circumflegra start and end in the same places one can quickly transfer from one train to the other. Both services are owned and operated by the same company and more information can be found at the S.E.P.S.A website

*Regional Trains. In Addition to the aforementioned trains, Trenitalia operates regional trains from Naples to .

By ferry/hydrofoil
There are several ferry/hydrofoil services that connect Naples and local ports/islands. Ferry and hydrofoil services leave from either Molo Beverello, Mergellina, or Pozzuoli. Some then of them are listed here:
*AliLauro has a hydrofoil service that connects Naples with the islands of Ponza, Ventotene, Prochida, Ischia, Capri, and Eolie, and the towns of Formia, Castellamare, Sorrento, Positano, Amalfi, and Salerno. Alilauro operates from both the Molo Beverello and Mergelina. 
*L.N.G. has a hydrofoil service that connects Naples with the island of Capri, along with Sorrento, Positano, and Amalfi. Schedules and timings can be found on its website.
*Metro del Mare has several lines that connect Naples and Sapri; Bacoli and Salerno and Sorrento; Monti di Procida and Salerno; and, Amalfi and Sapri. Besides the main stops the ferry service also connects many smaller communities. The Metro di Mare webpage has schedules, timetables, and locations of ticket counters.

Just a note: the ferries to Capri can be over rough seas. Get on a ferry with an outside deck, and take Gravol or something similar before you sail. Nothing like being on a boat for 70 min surrounded by people who are vomiting to get your day off to a bad start.

In Naples, some may find the actual conditions of many buildings and streets, and the rampant graffiti, off-putting. Others claim this is "the immense character and culture of Napoli and even the dirt and grime has its flavor a Neapolitan recipe for reality and great fun". Naples' peculiarity is that the city center is not an elegant part of the city. Just do not expect the city center the pristine conditions of many other major European cities, since the historical center, unlike most European cities, is not the "downtown". If you want to visit the elegant part of the city, you can walk around the wonderful lungo mare (the Riviera di Chiaia or Via Francesco Caracciolo), and visit Via dei Mille and Vomero Hill (the main shopping areas).

A 1999 state law gives the right to European Union citizens under the age of 25 for a reduced ticket throughout Italy. Also, EU citizens under 18 are allowed to enter museums and sites for free. Entrance is free for everyone on the first Sunday of each month.

Most sites in Campania (including Pompeii) accept the Campania Artecard for tourists. Some cards also include a pass for the city or regional public transportation. 
* It was a time when Naples was called the “city of the seven castles” for a powerful defense of the Gulf of Naples, today it boasts only 4 of them Castel dell’Ovo, Castel Nuovo (Maschio Angioino), Castel Sant’Elmo, and Castel Capuano in a full stand. Castel dell’Ovo and Castel Nuovo both in are situated straight on the coast of the gulf.
* Naples boasts the highest number of churches in the world: less than 500 of them. Many of them boast the artistic and spiritual heritage of enormous importance accumulated over the ages.
* Wandering around Naples, you can find various fountains, from the simplest to the architectural masterpieces. The fountain of the Esedra (Fontana dell'Esedra) is the largest fountain in Naples. There are many monumental fountains as the Fountain of Neptune, Sebeto Fountain, and Giant's Fountain.
* The word graffiti comes from the Italian graffiato, meaning scratched. Some of the earliest examples of graffiti are Roman, seen in the catacombs of Rome or the streets of Pompeii. In modern Italy, Naples has become the street art capital with artwork scattered across the city. Almost every stop is festooned with spray-can art. Although sometimes controversial in theme, many locals regard Naples’ street art scene fondly, often offering up their walls, shop fronts, and doors for decoration. It’s best to explore with an expert on a guided tour who can translate Italian phrases and help you find some hidden works.
* Naples is rich in different museums and the most recommended museums to be visited are the National Archaeological Museum of Naples, the Capodimonte Museum (art paintings), and the Donnaregina Museum of Contemporary Art. If you are interested in sacred art visit Museo Diocesano in Donna Regina Nuova church. In Pio Monte of Mercy church and gallery see Neapolitan Baroque paintings.
* Street art & graffiti tour is a tourist walk through the Neapolitan historical center among murals, stencils, slogans, posters, and graffiti to discover urban art.
* There are over 200 of them and it is a complex of urban systems that connect various areas of the city. The history of these ramps is mainly due to expansions outside the walls of the 16th century. The stairways of Naples are ancient pedestrian paths that connect the hills with the center and the coast. The oldest graded paths of the city, most of the time, were born thanks to the coverage of streams or springs, which once flowed just outside the city. These paths were also made to easily connect retreats, monasteries, churches, markets, or other urban needs. The stairs of Naples are ancient pedestrian paths that connect different areas of the city, generally joining the hilly areas with the center and the promenade. Are considered real works of art in urban planning and, despite today there being faster and less tiring means of connection, they are still used for their charm. They were built starting from the 16th century when the Spanish viceroy decided to expand the city beyond the Vomero hill towards the "lower town", but over the centuries they were also built in other districts. They are very beautiful to travel to and allow you to experience the city from another point of view, discovering new corners and glimpses always new. Many have disappeared, but there are still tens, and among the most famous there are the Ascent of Pedamentina, Ramps of the Petraio, Calata San Francesco, Salita Moiariello and the Stairs of Sant'Antonio ai Monti. They are still the subject of study and are considered real urban masterpieces.
* The viceroy Fernandez Ruiz de Castro wanted a great palace to host the king and the Spanish court, so he built the Royal Palace of Naples. There is another royal palace in Naples Capodimonte which played the role of summer residence. The Palace of the Spaniards of Neapolitan Baroque architecture has been filmed for many movies and TV series.
* The breathtaking panorama of the Bay of Naples is best appreciated from the seafront or Castel Sant’Elmo. On a clear day, you can see not only Vesuvius but also the shimmering outlines of the islands Capri and Ischia. The Terrace of the Camaldoli Hermitage opens a great panorama of the city of Naples and its Gulf. Belvedere di Sant’Antonio a Posillipo offers a stunning view across the bay to Mt. Vesuvius on the opposite shore. Also, Posilipo has other great viewpoints.
* Naples has very special parks. Visit Vergil Park at Piedigrotta a legendary place where is located tombstone of poet Virgil. Pausilypon Archaeological Park is accessed through the imposing Grotta di Seiano, a Roman tunnel more than 700m long. is an area of intense volcanic activity that has left the area riddled with caves, thermal springs, and craters. Botanical Garden of Naples is the only garden in Naples with ferns, citrus palm trees, and other plants growing there. The Garden was opened in 1807.
* Piazza del Plebiscito is an interesting and fascinating symbol of Naples that reflects an era of the city and which has a high historical value. Piazza Dante in particular represents the authentic soul of the city. Piazza Monteoliveto is popular with young people.
* Visiting Piazza del Plebiscito you will find two equestrian statues of kings. It is worth attention Statue of the god Nile situated on a small square.
* Naples's colorful and chaotic streets have a charm of their own. Originally the heart of the Greek and Roman city, the Spaccanapoli district is a string of narrow, winding streets and is mainly a pedestrian zone so it's a fun place to wander around. Representing 28 centuries of history, the neighborhood is a crowded mix of historic churches, lively piazzas, open-air cafés, and one-of-a-kind shops. It’s also home to local inhabitants whose boisterous lives often spill onto the streets, providing visitors with a glimpse of what it means to be Neapolitan Vecchia.
* Over the past time, the city of Naples has been transforming sections of the subway system into full-fledged art galleries by contemporary artists to make the urban area’s public transport centers more attractive. A total of 14 stations (as of 2014) distributed along lines 1 and 6 of the Metro network have been decorated with over 200 works by more than 100 artists and architects. The underground station in Naples represents one of the most interesting Italian experiments on the permanent insertion of contemporary artwork in an urban context. The first to be filled with colors, mosaics, installations, sculptures, and photographs were the stations of Line 1: Museum – Dante – Salvator Rosa – Materdei – Cilea/Quattro Giornate – Vanvitelli – Rione Alto. Recently built Università, Toledo, Garibaldi, and Municipio. The project also extended to Line 6 with the following stations: Lala – Mergellina – Augusto – Mostra. Try to explore!
:* It is very mysterious with its black little bricks and its suspended escalators (yes, they are suspended!); while Università station is so colorful, Tetris style; so unbelievable! You can go from the Oliviero Toscani collage at Montecalvario to the Fibonacci spiral at Vanvitelli and the Roman aqueduct at Salvator Rosa station.
:* It is impressive is voted no.1 in many rankings. Some artists, really good designers, and architects are contributing to this art program. Now you have at least one good reason to visit Naples. Toledo station is the most probably the most amazing one: it has also been prized as the greatest and most impressive metro in Europe: with its ochre mosaics, followed by the bluestones. When you are halfway on the last escalator don’t forget to look up! Toledo was designed by the Spanish architect Oscar Tusquets Blanca. The most impressive work of this station is Crater de Luz, by Robert Wilson, which connects the inside with the outside and remembers the sea in its many aspects, as well as the wavy walls surrounding it. The brightness and colors that fill the space with different shades of blue fascinate thousands of passengers every year. The same artist is a digital installation that replicates the sea waves for a surface of 24 meters and covers the walls of the corridor leading to the dock, By the sea, you and me is the title of the work. Inside the station, everything remembers the recent history of Naples. On the first floor, you can admire the remains of the Aragonese walls that cradled the area in medieval times, but in the atrium, you can find two events related to the Parthenon people depicted in two beautiful and colorful mosaics: a procession guided by St. Gennaro the patron saint of the city and a scene that recalls the works for the construction of the subway.
:* The metro was so close to the castle and the sea, that they found two whole Roman vessels during the excavations! So they built it placing one side of it on the castle’s walls: just in Naples, you could find something like this!
* Caves Naples was the most heavily bombed city in Italy and the Fontanelle, along with the other underground spaces in the city, served as a bomb shelter. The Fontanelle is a combination of natural caves, tufa mines, and ancient Greek and Roman tunnels. Naples, in the shadow of Vesuvius, is located in the Campi Flegrei an area of intense volcanic activity that has left the area riddled with caves, thermal springs, and craters. The early Greek residents of the area carved and quarried the soft volcanic stone, using some of the underground spaces as their own burial places. The Romans that followed dug networks of tunnels and aqueducts through the hills, often connected with the natural cave systems, all of which left modern Naples and the surrounding countryside riddled with underground spaces of all kinds. Naples is a town floating on the hollow space of underground cavities. Napoli was built on a large stratum of tufa rock. Artificial caves were added to the natural ones since the early years of the city's foundation. Greeks and Romans used the subsoil as a parallel city, opening aqueducts, catacombs, and warehouses. The tufa has been until recent times the main building material and many quarries have been opened just underneath the town. Moreover, through the ages, Naples has developed in a strange way, growing layer by layer on a vertical line, the modern levels added on the oldest ones. That’s the reason why when you walk into the historical center, Naples's past is under your feet.

(Note: The nearby San Lorenzo Maggiore also has underground ruins of the old Roman market, but they are much less extensive and there is typically no guide).
* Naples has many great theatres. First of all, the most famous and prestigious Theater in the world San Carlo, an opera house in Naples opened in 1737. Seeing an opera in this theatre is a unique experience, a show inside the show. The other less prestigious Napulitana (Neapolitan songs), Teatro Bellini (Performing arts), Teatro Augusteo (Performing arts), and Palapartenope Theater.
* The Spaccanapoli course stands out for its color and noise, which is interesting because it divides the city of Naples into two parts. From there, travel to St. Severus Chapel (Cappella Sansevero), which preserves a famous 18th-century masterpiece of the Neapolitan sculptor Giuseppe Sanmartino - "Veiled Christ " (Cristo Velato). The sculpture depicting the dead Christ wrapped in a veil is still a mystery to sculpture fans, who cannot find an explanation as to how the author managed to get such a thin veil out of marble; Walk along the seashore: Via Nazario Sauro, Via Partenope, and Via Francesco Caracciolo. Or you can make the route Via dei Mille, via Filangieri, and via Chiaia which are three of the more elegant and rich streets.

Events
* Ten days of great national and international cinema.
* This fiesta is a treat for pizza lovers across the globe. Naples holds this event in honor of pizza every year.
* It is dedicated to Saint Januarius, the patron saint of Naples.

Learn
Naples is famous for its many high schools. The Federico II University of Naples is believed to be the oldest public university in the world, founded in 1224. It is ranked as the best in Naples in many fields such as natural sciences, agricultural sciences, engineering, social studies and humanities, medicine and health, mathematics, law, informatics, and visual and performing arts.

Another notable center of education is the Istituto Universitario Orientale, which specializes in Eastern culture. It is ranked best in Naples for Languages & Literature.

Another prominent university in Naples is the Parthenope University of Naples. The San Pietro a Maiella music conservatory is the city's foremost institution of musical education. The earliest Neapolitan music conservatories were founded in the 16th century under the Spanish. The Academy of Fine Arts located on the Via Santa Maria di Costantinopoli is the city's foremost art school and one of the oldest in Italy.

Buy
Naples is famous for its outdoor markets and small shops (the city has an impressively high number) and that is where many tourists prefer to spend most of their shopping time. However, it also has other retail establishments of note, such as shopping malls and wine vendors. You can find expensive, upscale items, rare antiques, handcrafted clothing and souvenirs, and just about anything else you are looking for in Naples — and much of it at prices much lower than in Western European nations.

Eat
Pizza

Pizza comes from Naples. Look for pizza Margherita, the original one, with nothing more than fresh tomatoes, basil, fresh mozzarella, and a little olive oil. Eating a pizza in Florence or in Rome is not the same as eating it in Naples! Here the dough is thicker (than in Rome, for example) and is a little chewy.

In Naples, every pizzeria makes a decent pizza. Some places display the label “Vera Pizza Napoletana” (True Neapolitan Pizza) with a Pulcinella mask baking a pizza in a stylized Vesuvio, which indicates that the pizzeria follows the standards of the Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (True Neapolitan Pizza Association) 

If you want to try authentic Neapolitan pizza, go to Pizzeria Brandi, where the pizza Margherita was born (a stone is exposed outside the restaurant explaining the history of the first pizza). The pizza dough and tomato sauce are perhaps a little more delicate here than in other places, and it certainly offers a nice escape from the madness of the Quartieri Spagnoli or Centro Storico, but there is better pizza and far more reasonable prices to be found elsewhere in the city. And really, the “gritty” and irregular character of the dough in this town is what makes Pizza Napoletana what it is!

Today the best choices would be Trianon or especially Da Michele. Both these pizzerias make authentic pizza Napoletana, but are located near Forcella, which some might not be comfortable walking around at night. In particular, Da Michele has a unique feature: they only do pizza Margherita or Marinara (just tomato, garlic, and oregano, and a splash of oil, of course!). They say that these two kinds are the original pizza: if you add too much toppings you’ll lose the real taste of the pizza, which should be very simple, made only of a good, thin base, good tomatoes, and fresh mozzarella. Note that there is usually a queue at these restaurants.

Some other places that are very popular among the Neapolitans are almost all the pizzerias in Via dei Tribunali, in particular Di Matteo, Sorbillo, and his sister, a few doors away (informally known as “la Vecchia” the old lady, from the owner of the pizzeria, a very small place with only 4 or 5 tables, that looks like a pizzeria of 50 years ago — very hard to find, but it’s worth it!)

In general, it is easy to find a good pizzeria, just look for one without tourists! If there is a long line, remember to approach a waiter/waitress and tell them your name and how many people you are - they will call your name when a table is available, so stick around!

General Cuisine
Neapolitan cuisine in general features much seafood, befitting its status as an ancient and still functioning port. You will find many sauces based on garlic sauteed in extra-virgin olive oil, tomatoes, and local red wines. Some of the more popular sauces are arrabbiata (“angry”) or fra diavolo (“Brother Devil”), which means they will contain hot pepper. It’s great cuisine. Mozzarella is also typical of the region, you should not miss the opportunity to taste the fresh real one! Enjoy!

Sweets
The city and region are also famous for their pasticceria (pastries), including:

* babà — found in virtually every cafe, bar, and pasticceria 
* graffa napoletana — staples similar to fried donuts covered in sugar with a base of flour and potatoes
* jaka pastiera — typical sweet of Easter (but found all year long), made of ricotta cheese melted with steamed corn and sugar, and then baked
* roccocò and struffoli — typical Christmas sweets
* sfogliatella — often filled with ricotta cheese (riccia) or cream with citrus flavor
* zeppole — a deep-fried dough ball filled with custard, jelly, cannoli-style pastry cream, or a butter-and-honey mixture.

Pretty much anywhere that serves coffee will have some pastries, Nutella-filled croissants, or other sweets available.

Drink
Naples is becoming increasingly popular with a younger generation of both Italians and foreigners. In spite of false and stereotypical reports of adverse conditions, they flood into the city and lend renewed vitality to its nightlife. The hippest scene is around the bars and cafes on Piazza Bellini, Piazza Santa Maria la Nova, and Piazza San Domenico Maggiore, becoming busy after about 11PM. You should also try the area around Piazza dei Martiri, especially Vico Belledonne a Chiaia, where you can find many crowded bars, a wine bar, and lots of young people, especially at weekends. However, if you are looking for an American/English/Northern European drinking establishment you may be hard-pressed to find what you are looking for as that culture is frowned upon in Naples. There are a variety of small drinking establishments but if you're looking for a crowded beer hall, an Irish pub, or an American college-style dive bar, you'll have trouble finding one.

If you're in Naples and wondering what local beverages to try, the first answer is that Naples is as famous for its extra-strong, semi-sweet coffee as it is for its pizza, and you can try some at places like Gran Caffe Aragonese with a little ice cream floating on top or at Caffe Gambrinus which also serves cakes and cocktails. Amazingly, coffee is so thoroughly Neapolitan that it is commonly sold at local bars as well. 

For those who would like to try the local beer and wine, there is an abundance of options. Beer bars were once rare, beer being traditionally sold with and consumed in pizza parlors, but now they are more common. Wine bars are classic in Naples, which is not surprising since it is the capital of , a major wine-producing region. There are many local varieties of wine you may wish to sample, but the Aglianico is peculiarly appropriate. Aglianico black grapes are grown throughout southern Italy, but Campania provides them with their ideal soil and growing climate.

Some of the main areas of Naples where bars and cafes serving beer and wine are concentrated include:
*On Piazza Bellini, Piazza San Domenico, and Piazza Santa Maria La Nova
*On the street called Vico Belledonne a Chiaia, particularly on weekends
*On the outskirts of town, near the port and the boardwalk called Pozzuoli

Nightlife
Besides the bars in Piazza Bellini, Santa Maria la Nova, Piazza San Domenico Maggiore, Via Carlo Poerio, and Vico Belledonne a Chiaia there are also plenty of great nightclubs and beach clubs outside but not far from the historic center of Naples.

If you wish to try something outside Naples, during the weekend Pozzuoli is packed with bars around the old port (mainly, but not only on Largo San Paolo and parallel streets) and the main square (Piazza della Repubblica), where you will find hundreds of young people hanging out in front of bars loudly chatting with their friends along with some drinks.

Sleep
Accommodation in Naples is normally cheaper than in Rome or northern Italian cities, but the quality may vary a lot. It's not uncommon to encounter hot water shortages, short power outages, and less than luxurious bed and bath linens. Also don't expect a full-sized bathtub in reasonably priced hotels. You may not even get a shower stall in the bathroom, but a drain hole that is in the center of the bathroom with a toilet, a sink, and a showerhead along the plain tiled walls. Breakfast may include weak orange juice (tasting more like the powdered orange drink), hard rolls, and an assortment of hard meats and cheeses. Nothing mentioned here is meant to discourage but to help you view your experience as an adventure in Italian culture.

Stay safe
Naples is notorious around the world for being a very dangerous city. The truth is however that Naples is much safer than it was 5-10 years ago and if you take the right precautions a tourist shouldn't experience any problems in the city.

So let's address the elephant in the room: Camorra, that is the local Mafia is still active in the city unfortunately but not to the extent it was until the turn of the century since its activities are now significantly reduced, and underground so they don't concern most of the local populous. The truth is that the mafia almost never targets tourists. NEVER get involved in Camorra's business. 

Another thing that tourists should definitely watch out for is pickpockets. Always secure your bags with both straps on your shoulders, carry as much cash as needed for your day, and if possible don't have your mobile phones in your pocket. Don't flash around expensive jewelry, cameras, necklaces, or other expensive items. Be alert at all times in buses, trams, and the metro, and don't leave your personal belongings unattended in a cafeteria or a restaurant table. If you have a car: make sure that you don't leave anything valuable inside that can be seen from outside and park in secure parking and not on the street whenever possible. You might have heard about thieves on board Vespas or other kinds of motorcycles running around stealing bags right off people's shoulders. This is not a myth and it used to happen but such occurrences subsided a lot in recent years as the police have stepped up their presence in the city. In the unlikely event that this happens DON'T hold on to your bag; the vespa is much stronger than you and this could result in serious injuries.

Traffic is also a big problem. The Neapolitan streets are chaotic and the drivers are not exactly polite. Cross the street carefully, with other people and always assume that just because you're standing on a pedestrian crossing doesn't mean that cars will always stop for you. It is recommended that you don't drive in Naples. In addition, beware of taxis as taxi drivers sometimes tend to inflate the price. Always make sure the meter is on or agree with the taxi driver about the price before the start of your journey.

There is a general rule in Naples: You should avoid walking alone at night, especially females. Try going out as a group or a couple. Don't get in the city's parks after sunset.

Areas to be careful
Naples has some seedy neighborhoods where tourists should exercise caution or even avoid it completely. Here's a rundown of the neighborhoods: 
*Stazione Centrale - Like many other cities in Italy and the rest of Europe the area around the central train station is rundown, sketchy, and filled with homeless people, beggars, and vendors selling fake products to tourists exiting the train station. A few of them can become quite persistent but most will not bother you if you ignore them. During the day you need to stay vigilant and be careful of your belongings and luggage. If you arrive after nightfall minimize walking around as much as possible and take a cab to reach your hotel; if you walk with your luggage during the night in the area it's like putting a sign on your head saying "TOURIST". That could make you a target for people with no good intentions. There are many cheap hotels here; while the price may seem tempting it's better to pay a bit more to stay at a safer place. 

Be careful when changing large notes at Conad supermarket in the central station. The supermarket cashiers will short-change you.

*Quartieri Spagnoli - Many people find Quartieri Spagnoli quite charming during the day with its colorful markets and beautiful vicolis; even one of Naples' most famous pizzerias is located here! But during the night its narrow and dark streets make it a good place for criminals, drug dealers, and prostitutes. This doesn't mean however that you're automatically in danger; if you want to visit the area during the night just know exactly where you're going and don't linger in the streets for too long. 
*The rest of Centro Storico - Centro Storico is the beating heart of Naples during the day and it can remain quite busy even after midnight. After nightfall just make sure you are walking on the main avenues avoiding narrow, dark vicolis devoid of other pedestrians and you won't encounter any problems.
*Via Marina and the Port - Naples' port is bustling during daytime as many people, tourists and locals alike, board ships for the Amalfi Coast and other places around Campania. But during the night you should definitely avoid walking along Via Marina and don't, for any reason, go to the dockyards or abandoned buildings that are most present on the south side of the port. 
*Suburbs - The Neapolitan suburbs have always suffered from a bad reputation for being filled with trash, drug addicts, and having a low standard of living. The situation has improved a whole lot in recent years but there are still some that should be avoided like Ponticelli, which still has problems with garbage collection, Secondigliano which has a significant population of drug addicts, and the infamous Scampia, a very poor neighborhood often considered the most crime-ridden area in the city; don't go there at any time of day. Still, it is quite unlikely that you will end up in these areas or any areas outside the city center in fact, as there is very little to no interest for an average tourist.
