 Nagoya (名古屋) is the capital and largest city of prefecture, in the region of .

Understand
The hub of the Aichi region, Nagoya is Japan's fourth-largest city after , , and , and is one of the nation's major economic centers. In terms of manufacturing, it is home to automotive manufacturing giants Toyota, Honda, and Mitsubishi Motors.
In this region, the historical center of samurai and ninja culture has evolved, and now it is the center of the automobile and aircraft manufacturing industry in Japan. Toyota Group has been especially prominent in developing the car and heavy industry of the city, and Mitsubishi - which once produced the Zero fighter aircraft during WWII - is now producing a Japanese-designed passenger jet, the MRJ, in this area.
Many parts for Boeing airliners are also produced in this area. The Boeing 787 and 777 aircraft wings, and various other components are manufactured in Aichi Prefecture. These components are transported to the United States from Centrair International Airport in dedicated cargo planes.
If you do decide to stick around, there are plenty of car-related attractions, a restored castle, an ancient shrine, and a surprisingly vibrant nightlife.

History
Now a modern metropolis, Nagoya gets its name from an old manor called Nagono which was built in the area in the 12th century. The manor prospered for two hundred years, and people began to refer to the area by the manor's name. Over time, the pronunciation of the Chinese characters in the name "Nagono" shifted to "Nagoya", by which the city is now known.

Three famous local figures later helped to put Nagoya firmly on the map of Japan. Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu all hailed from around Nagoya, and all shared the ambitious goal of unifying Japan under one government. Tokugawa finally succeeded in 1603 after winning in the Battle of Sekigahara, and established the Tokugawa Shogunate, which would rule Japan for another 250 years.

Soon after uniting the country, Tokugawa Ieyasu ordered the construction of Nagoya Castle for his son. He then ordered the people of nearby Kiyosu (on the outskirts of Nagoya) to move to the area around the castle, and a town soon came into being. Cotton, ceramics and timber were the main industries as the town as it grew into a small city.

Following Japan's opening to the world during the Meiji era, Nagoya rapidly industrialized and established transportation links with the rest of Japan that would allow it to easily export its goods. During World War I, Nagoya became known for its foundries as well as its machinery and heavy industry exports, which would continue to grow throughout the 1930's.

The 1920's marked the beginnings of the automotive industry in Nagoya, which continues in importance to the current day. At the heart of the industry is the Toyota Motor Corporation. Starting from humble beginnings as a loom-making company, Toyota entered into the automobile business in the 1930s. It is now the world's largest automaker, and continues to dominate the local economy along with the car-making giants Honda and Mitsubishi.

During World War II, much of Nagoya's manufacturing infrastructure turned to the production of military goods, making it a prime target for bombing raids. Almost 25% of the city was destroyed during the war, with almost half the population fleeing to the countryside to avoid the attacks.

The end of the war marked a new start for Nagoya. Car-friendly wide streets and boulevards were bulldozed through the rubble of war, making for the city of today. 

Nagoya now ranks as one of the nation's economic powerhouses, and is home to the head offices of Toyota Motor Corporation, Brother Industries, Daido Steel, Makita, Denso Corporation, INAX, Suzuki Motor, Honda Motor, Noritake, NGK Insulators, Olympus Optical, Yamaha and many others. Unlike other parts of Japan, which borrowed heavily for elaborate and expensive public works projects in the bubble years of the 1980's, ketchi (cheap) Nagoya held to a pay-as-you-go philosophy, and has not been as adversely affected by the post-bubble recession as other major centres.

The booming economy has also brought many foreigners to the area, and the region now hosts a thriving community of Japanese-descent Brazilian immigrants, who help to keep the wheels of the local economy spinning. With its strong economy and growing population, Nagoya is a city to watch in the coming years.

Climate
Nagoya's climate varies greatly throughout the year, with average temperatures ranging from a low of 4&deg;C (39.2&deg;F) in January to a high of 35&deg;C (95&deg;F) in August. The city is known for its incredibly hot and humid summers like many cities in Japan, with high temperatures routinely above 30&deg;C (86&deg;F)in August, so those with an aversion to heat would be better off visiting in the milder temperatures of the spring or autumn.

Orientation
While divided into 16 different wards or ku (区), the focal points of this sprawling agglomeration are Nagoya Station (名古屋駅) to the north, Sakae (栄) to the east and Kanayama (金山) to the south.

Get around

Nagoya is a big automotive industry center and it shows. The street network is extensive and even downtown locations can easily be reached by car. On the downside, trains and subways are less convenient than in Tokyo or Kansai, and more expensive. For those travelling with a JR Rail Pass, note that the train network doesn't have many stations in the city and you'll probably find yourself using the bus or subway a lot, something your pass won't cover.

By subway

There are 6 main subway lines:
*The red Sakuradōri Line (桜通線) curves southwest from Nagoya Station. 

*The purple Meijō Line (名城線) runs in a loop around the eastern side of the city, connecting Sakae and Kanayama; the Meikō Line (名港線) spur branches from Kanayama to Nagoya Port. 

*The yellow Higashiyama Line (東山線) connects Nagoya, Fushimi, Sakae and . 

*The blue Tsurumai Line (鶴舞線) connects Fushimi and Osu Kannon, then goes south to Akaike station. From there, it is possible to transfer to the Meitetsu Toyota line which leads to . 

*The pink Kamiiida Line (上飯田線) connects Heian-dōri and Kamiiida. From Kamiiida, it is possible to transfer to the Meitetsu Komaki line which leads to .

Subways run every several minutes between about 5:30AM until about 12:30AM. Fares range from ¥200 to ¥320. One day passes can be bought for ¥600 (bus), ¥740 (subway), and ¥850 (bus &amp; subway). 

On Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays you can also take advantage of the cheaper Donichi-Eco-Kippu (ドニチエコきっぷ） one-day subway ticket which offers unlimited subway travel for ¥600. Please note that this pass is often not available from subway ticket machines and may have to be purchased in person from a station employee at the ticket gate.

City transportation one day passes also offer discounted entry at various attractions in Nagoya, including Nagoya Castle and the Toyota Museum.

Wifi access is available in most subway stations. More information about public transportation in Nagoya can be found on the official website of the Nagoya Transportation Bureau 

By taxi

Taxis are a viable option in this car city, especially as the basic fee is only ¥480 (compared to ¥710 in Tokyo or Yokohama). The catch is that the basic fee only takes you 1.3km compared to 2km in most other parts of Japan. But for shorter distances within the city, a taxi is not only much more convenient than descending to those dark unappealing subway stations, but (from 2 persons) also as cheap as the subway.

It combines the various denominations together in one place. Moreover, there are many interesting things in the temple. The first part is about its history. Nittai-ji Temple was built due to Thailand’s King Rama V because he gave the relics of the Buddha to Buddhists in Japan and this makes we was intimate between two country. Especially, the monasteries of Thailand. Since 1993 when the monasteries of Thailand went to Japan, they also visited the temple. For example, King Bhumipol Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit also went to Nittai-ji Temple in 1987 for celebrating 100 years of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Thailand and Japan. The second part is about the importance of Nittai-ji Temple. Chulalongkorn Day on October 23 of each year. Thai officers and the Japanese community will make an offering to the King Rama Monument V for memorial obligation. In addition, the embassy of Thailand in Tokyo consulate general in Osaka with honorary consulate of Nagoya was also the organizers for bowing to commemorate for 100 years of the death of King Rama V.

Around Nagoya station, there are a lot of places for cheap drinking. Sakae is the big nightlife district, in a loose triangle formed by the Sakae, Yaba-cho and Osu Kannon stations. Sakae has a large red light district as well, but as with most of Japan, there's no sense of danger so don't worry about drifting around. There are countless izakayas around Kanayama station, both cheap chains and more upscale places.

If the bar and club scene is not for you, try Nagoya Friends and their monthly international parties and speed dating events. Always a dynamic mix of foreigners and Japanese. At the party it's all you can drink and eat (~¥3500 reserved ~¥4000 at the door).

Nightclubs

Nagoya has some good clubs. A lot of the DJs who play Tokyo also pass through Nagoya. Many of the most popular clubs are located in Sakae and Shin-sakae-machi (just east of Sakae and south of the Naka ward office). 

Be aware that even on week-ends, on less popular nights, clubs empty or even close early (around 2-3AM) in Nagoya. This is a sharp contrast to Tokyo, where most people come by train and have to stick around for good or for bad until the first train in the morning. In auto-city Toyota, however, many people come by car; they can and will go home early if they are bored.

Be also aware that some of the clubs operate a "no gaijin" (foreigners) policy. Yes its allowed in japan. Just find a more open minded place to dance the night away.
