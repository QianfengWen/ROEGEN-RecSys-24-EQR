Understand

Algiers is the capital city of Algeria in North Africa. Algiers is located on a bay of the Mediterranean Sea and is an important port. Algiers was first settled over 1000 years ago and has now grown to a large city with a metropolitan population of over 3 million. Algiers has also been marred by violence in the past decade. 
Algiers is known locally as El-Djazaïr and the residents speak Berber, Arabic and French.

Travel to Algiers
In Algiers, most of the interesting sights are in the old part of the city known as the Casbah or Medina. The travelers that do make it to Algiers are impressed with the very friendly and hospitable people. The old French buildings, the promenade along the seafront and the food also get good ratings.

Climate
Algiers has one of the most pleasant climates in Africa thanks to its position in the Mediterranean. Winters are actually quite cool for coastal North African standards since the 24-hour average in January is 11°C (52°F), compared to 12°C (54°F) in , 12.5°C (54.5°F) in and 13.5°C (56°F) in . Temperatures below 5°C (42°F) do occur every year but anything below freezing is very rare. The record low is -3.3°C (26°F). Snow is rare but does occur; the last time was in January 2012 when the city received 10cm (3.9 inches) of snow for the first time in 8 years. Winter is also the rainiest part of the year. Summers are cooler than Tunis but warmer than Tangiers and Alexandria. Temperatures during the day are usually above 32°C (90°F) in August but they usually drop around 20°C (68°F) during the night. When heat waves manage to reach the city from the Sahara Desert, the mercury can skyrocket above 40°C (104°F) and the record high is 47.5°C (117.5°F). Spring and autumn are transition periods.

Get in

By plane

Houari Boumediene Airport (, ) is located 20 km (12 mi) southeast of Algiers: the airport is named after former Algerian president Houari Boumediene. The terminal building is rather modern and relatively hassle-free, comparable to airports in southern Europe.

The airport is the home base of the flag-carrier Air Algérie 

Air Algerie serves the most important Algerian cities (such as Oran, Annaba, Tammanrasset, Skikda, Tlemcen, Constantine) several times daily. There also many connections to African capitals such as Bamako, Cairo, Abidjan, Dakar, Tunis, and Ouagadougo.

Air Algerie operates from Hall 1 as Hall 2 is reserved for the international airlines.

Airport Transfer

*

Taxis can be found outside of the Hall 2; as they have no taximeters, a price should be settled in advance. The ride to Algiers Center takes up to 50 min during heavy traffic and should not cost more than 1000 dinars (10euro). 

* 
The bus operates every 30 min in the daytime to the Centre. It costs 25 dinars paid to the bus driver. 

* 
SNTF runs a commuter service between Agha and the Airport once every hour. The price is 80 DZD ( november 2019)

By train 
Algiers Central Train Station is located near the city centre. The station offers regular services to major Algerian cities such as Oran, Annaba, and Constantine. SNTF (the national Algerian Train company) has made big improvements during the last years: new air-conditioned trains have been purchased and new routes launched.

By car
Being the capital of the country most, if not all major roadways in Algeria begin and end in Algiers. So getting into Algiers is quite easy. However, the infrastructure of Algerian roadways is not highly regarded so arriving by road might not be the most desirable option. There are a number of road projects around the country that are aimed at improving the infrastructure, most notably the East-West highway running from Annaba in the east to Oran in the west, of course coming through Algiers.

By bus
La Gare Routiere, Algiers's central bus terminus, located in the commune of Hussein Dey (about 7-10 min drive from downtown), offers a plethora of bus services to most major Algerian cities and towns. It is a very cheap and efficient way to get to/from a pair of Algerian cities. Most of the coaches used are modern and air-conditioned so the rides are, more often than not, comfortable. However, there are a few old coaches still in service, so try to avoid those, for the ride won't be as pleasant.

For long distances as Algiers-Tammanrasset or Algiers-Annaba travelling by plane is recommend due the long duration.

By boat
They are regular ferry services to Algiers from Marseille, Nice, Palermo, Alicante .

Get around

Public transportation
Algiers Public Transportation is lacking but the city is going to make improvements with the opening of the long-delayed first Metro line: there are buses opereating within the city center and to the suburbs.

Metro
After more than three decades of construction (or lack of it) the first segment of Algiers Metro finaly opened on 1 November 2011. Line 1 services ten stations from Tafourah Grande Poste just south of Gare d'Alger, the central railway station, in the city centre to Haï El Badr with stops along several of the most important places in the city.
