Dunedin is the second-largest city and one of the main ports on the of , located in the Otago region. It is known as the of the South and is proud of its heritage. This university town is named from the old Gaelic for Edinburgh and is noted for its unique Victorian railway, said to be the second most photographed building in the southern hemisphere.

Understand
Dunedin has as its heart a statue of the poet Robbie Burns, and many of its streets carry the same name as streets in Edinburgh. It was built in a time before the car was king, when trams and railways moved people around efficiently. It is built in a natural harbor on a relatively small area of flat land surrounded by steep hillsides. Some of its streets are steep: Baldwin Street(slope angle of 19°) is claimed as the steepest street in the world by the Guinness Book of World Records. It has a relatively mild summer, while in winter the hill suburbs will get cold enough for snow several days a year and the entire city will close down once or twice a year due to snow settling. The real issue during winter is black ice on the steep streets surrounding the city.

Dunedin's University of Otago, established in 1869, is the oldest university in New Zealand. It is the South Island's second largest employer, and by far the biggest contributor to the Dunedin economy. Dunedin is a University Town rather than just a town with a university. The students make up over a tenth of the population. A consequence of this is that the city is significantly quieter during the university summer holiday period (approx. November to February), and that accommodation may be harder to find or more expensive during university graduations, etc.

Dunedinites (the Dunedin people) are generally friendly, seemingly more friendly than in the bigger cities of NZ (and the bigger cities anywhere else in the world).

Get in

By plane
* Dunedin Airport, .
* Air New Zealand, 0800 737 000. Flies from , and .
* Jetstar, Flies from Auckland.

The airport is 30km (19&nbsp;mi) out of town on the nearest piece of flat land that was big enough for the runway. Taxis and shuttle buses operate from just outside the terminal and are usually there when flights arrive. All the major rental car operators serve the airport.

By train
The railway station is close to the centre of town. Unfortunately there is no longer a regular long distance passenger train service, but some people arrive in the city by the local scenic trains. These are operated by the Taieri Gorge Railway, which runs out as far as Middlemarch. A connecting bus service to can be arranged.

By bus
There are several daily services from Christchurch, Invercargill, Wanaka and Queenstown. The major operators are InterCity Atomic Shuttles, Wanaka-Connection and Knightrider. (which offers an overnight service from Christchurch to Invercargill via Dunedin). The trip from (or to) Christchurch takes about 6.5 hours.

By car
State Highway 1 passes through Dunedin. Allow 4 hours 30 minutes travel from Christchurch and 2h30 from . Be sure to get a good detailed map as soon as you can. Most hostels have very detailed maps for the CBD with reasonable detail for the outlying areas. Dunedin's urban roads can be very confusing with lots of one way streets, circles, and tight and winding hill routes.

By boat
Port Chalmers, a small port town, is a deep water cargo and cruise port for Dunedin. Port Chalmers is 8 miles northeast of Dunedin and shares the same long, narrow harbor, Otago Harbor. Only smaller ships can proceed past Port Chalmers to the wharves in the Dunedin city centre. The main streets of Port Chalmers and Dunedin are both called George St. The Port Chalmers one is numbered in the 5000s to avoid confusion, and all shops, cafes and services can be found along or near this street. 

Cruise ship transfers to and from Dunedin.

*Cruise ship shuttle bus: These travel direct (20 minutes) and drop off and pick up in the Octagon in the centre of Dunedin for a fee ~$15. They may depart from the ship gangway or up to five minutes walk away, depending on the day's arrangements.
*For about five minutes further walk from ship side to the public bus stop in George St, these hourly buses take 30 minutes to get to the Dunedin city terminus is at Countdown supermarket on Cumberland St.
*Taxis depart ship-side and for the return to Port they are easily found on the side streets of most corners of George St, Dunedin's main shopping street.

Get around
By train

There are no suburban trains. 
The Taeri Gorge Railway tel +64 3 477-4449 is a scenic tourist trip, ending at a small village called Middlemarch. Take your camera and lots of memory. The same company runs trips on the old Christchurch line as far as Palmerston, about 2 hours away. These go about twice a week in the summer.

By bus
The Dunedin Bus Service is fairly average but cheap and does get you around. The main line service, St Clair-Normanby, runs every 15 minutes and is handy to about a dozen of the City's attractions. Most other routes are every 30-40 minutes. Some of the buses are not too attractive looking, but they are being added to by cast-off wheelchair friendly buses from other cities. The blue/gold colored buses operated by Citibus and the beige/dark red buses operated by Passenger Transport share all the town routes. Most drivers from either company will tell you where to find the right bus if you ask nicely, or you can ask the Otago Regional Council or call 0800 474 082 free from a cell phone, but only during office hours.
The Peninsula bus route from the Museum is a good way to see the Peninsula, unless you're terrified by oncoming traffic: in places the full sized buses are wider than the lanes they travel in. The traffic is generally used to this and travels very cautiously. All Buses on the Peninsula service are Wheelchair Friendly.

By bicycle
There is a recycling centre down by the north-east end of the docks (in Wickliffe Street) which generally has one or two reasonable-condition bicycles lying about for $10 apiece. Carefully add air (there's a service station due west back over the bridge) and oil and you're set to go. You will also need a skid-lid/stack-hat/helmet, which are generally unavailable second-hand for liability reasons, but can be had new for $20 from the KMart in Meridian, between George Street and Filleul Street. There is another recycling shop called "The Recover Store" at the Dunedin Landfill on Brighton Road, Green Island.

Dunedin's hills are extremely steep but the town centre is reasonably flat There is an excellent flat ride out along the western shore of the Otago Peninsula to Harington Point, although it's a narrow road shared by lots of tour buses. A cycle track runs along of the industrial eastern shore of the harbour, about half way to Port Chalmers (busy highway the rest of the way).

If you like a bit of a hill-climb, ride out along North Road to the Organ Pipes, a collection of rapidly-cooled rocks which have self-formed into organ-pipe-like structures. The walk along a bush track up to the Pipes themselves is very scenic and well attended by small, harmless wildlife. The ride up along the ridge of the Peninsula to Lanarch Castle is also good high-energy exercise.

If you like pushing a bike up a hill because it's too steep, dive off North Road onto Norwood Street, or cross to the east side of the Peninsula, or head straight up the hill behind The Octagon past the Beverly-Begg Observatory to suburbs with a view like Roslyn.

See

* Garden occupying over 50 hectares (123 acres) is in the north end of the city; an excellent place for a several-hour stroll. Has an aviary along with many themed garden areas such as Rhododendron, Azalea and Rose Gardens.
* The Gallery offers great exhibitions, different events, has excellent selection of British and European paintings and works on paper.
* A futuristic rugby and soccer stadium, opened in 2011 for the Rugby World Cup, it is fully enclosed with a grass surface—the only such stadium in the world. (The roof is transparent, allowing grass to grow). Some are already starting to call the stadium the "Greenhouse of Pain"—a play on "House of Pain", the nickname of Carisbrook, the stadium it replaced.
* Billed as "the only castle" in New Zealand, it's very pretty but technically only a manor house and there is another (ruined, but being restored) building in the same predicament called Cargill's Castle in the southern suburbs of Dunedin. Lanarch Castle has a rich but rather unhappy but interesting history.
* Spectacular rush of horsetail waterfall of 5 m height. There is another fall at the same named stream estuary.
* The city centre - it is shaped like an Octagon instead of the standard square. This part of town is very active and lots of businesses strive to be near it.

* Has some of New Zealand's most fascinating and rare wildlife.
* Expansive three floor natural history museum with taxidermy, fossils, antiquities from Egypt, Mesopotamia, the Mediterranean and the East, a science center, Pacific Island anthropology, and a planetarium. There is free internet in learning section on the second floor.

Seals, sea-lions and other interesting fauna turn up at all of the southern/eastern beaches. Ask nicely, and the locals may even tell you where the good spots are for gathering shellfish, catching Blue Cod, and viewing the wildlife without having to pay for the privilege.
* It has some great old buildings to wander about and see, when Uni's in its a good place to sit, people watch and take it all in, some good food/cafes/bars are nearby too.

* is the only mainland albatross nesting site in the world. It is an hour's drive along the western coast of Otago Peninsula on a road that skirts the water for most of its length without any guardrail. In places, the city buses which frequent the road are wider than the lanes (the local traffic is used to this, and drives very carefully), so if you don't trust your driving reflexes, take a coach instead. Albatrosses may be seen during the summer months, as well as other wildlife at all times of the year. Guided tours of the colony and the old fortifications on and under the headland are conducted daily.
* Enjoy there the astonishing views of the Otago Harbor and beautiful vista of the North East Valley.

Do

* The gun was installed in May 1889 and was recommissioned during World War II. It is the only one of its kind working and is still in its original gun pit. Coastal fortifications were constructed in New Zealand in two main waves. The first wave occurred around 1885 and was a response to fears of an attack by Russia. The second wave occurred during World War II and was due to fears of invasion by the Japanese. The fortifications were built from British designs adapted to New Zealand conditions.
* in Dunedin's North East Valley suburb is, according to the Guinness Book of Records, the steepest street in the world. Take the ten minute walk to the top or drive up to enjoy the view looking down! There is a drinking fountain at the top. Some people have tried, and a few have succeeded, to cycle all the way up Baldwin Street - try it if you're a keen cyclist. That said, you will need to be careful coming back down - chances are the cycle's brakes will do little to slow your descent on such an incline!
* Great place and good choice of 25 beaches within 25 minutes of Dunedin.
* A piece of serenity in the city, with an extensive collection of plants, Chinese materials and home wares forming a quaint and authentic garden setting. An example of a late Ming, early Ching Dynasty Scholar's Garden and is one of only two traditional Chinese Gardens in the Southern Hemisphere, the other, larger one being in . Try some dumplings and Chinese tea.

Seven servants were employed to service the 35 rooms of the home and to manicure the acre of beautiful garden. The home is sited in the inner city and is within walking distance from the city centre.
* It is an outdoor hot salt water pool built on a beautiful site at the southern end of St Clair beach. The only one surviving salt water pool of several in Dunedin.
* Much more fun if you wear a wetsuit. If it's a bit cold, there's a heated saltwater pool adjacent to the main beach a little north of the esplanade.
* The story goes that crazy old Cargill had a steep tunnel cut through the stone cliff, so his daughter could go to the beach. Some stories say she later drowned, but it's a lovely beach all the same, and the tunnel is very spooky. You need to walk over farmland to get there, so access is banned during lambing.

Stay safe
The city is quite safe. There tends to be a 'party atmosphere' on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights and a lot of people enjoying the night life get drunk or boisterous in the centre city and Dunedin North area - generally students having fun and unwinding after a week of lectures and studies. The police station is in Great King Street, next to Countdown, the supermarket. If you do not act aggressively to someone who is a 'wee bit sloshed' you should do OK. Tourists are viewed with curiosity and people are helpful and kind.
