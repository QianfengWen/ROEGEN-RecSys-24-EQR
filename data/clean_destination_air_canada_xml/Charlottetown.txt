Charlottetown Airport is one of the most user-friendly airports. Clearly, some of this is due to infrequent flights and small aircraft. Check-ins usually take five minutes or less. The airport is small, accessible, and friendly -- just like the city itself!

Taxis are cheap. $16 gets you from the Airport to downtown (some drivers charge $1.50 extra to use your card). 6-10$ will get you anywhere around town. All taxis are flat rate by zone. None has any specific licensing information in them; not to worry though, taxi drivers are typically friendly, enjoy meeting tourists, and are honest above all else. Charlottetown is a small highly accessible city, you can walk almost anywhere downtown.

Eat

Charlottetown, and PEI in general, have an abundance of great restaurants. For a city of its size, Charlottetown has a far better selection of Asian, Mediterranean and Indian food than you would normally expect. 

* Great Lebanese food and reasonable prices. They have won many awards and have a great atmosphere. Shish Taouk, Falafel and other traditional dishes are prepared much more thoughtfully and are far tastier than the normal hole-in-the-wall Mediterranean joints in most cities.
* Romantic meal, sophisticated atmosphere, and there is a well stocked bar upstairs called Marc's Studio.
* Home of Gahan Micro Brewery, with great fresh-brewed beer! A favorite is Iron Horse, but the others are all great. The Nachos are a favorite with locals and the best value on the menu. Tourist dished such as the Fish and Chips can be paltry and overpriced.
* Both The Merchantman Pub and The Pilot House restaurants offer great pub fare with a good value overall. Great atmosphere for the mature set:
* 
* 
* Offers one of the freshest and tastiest menus in town. Well-liked by residents, though its prices are considered somewhat high.
* The newly renovated food court in the Confederation Court Mall. They serve the best lunches possible: Simple sandwiches, soups and pizza all run by an in-house chef. This is a great place to feed a family.
* Provides shockingly inexpensive vegetarian meals. Serving a selection of fine Asian teas, dim sum treats like dumplings, and large bowls of noodles, vegetables and vegetarian "ham", you won't go hungry. The menu is small but every item on it is delicious and very reasonably priced.
* Offers simple but well prepared seafood meals at exceptional prices. Start with an order of fresh Malpeque oysters, and then have a lobster roll, some lightly battered fish and chips, or even a 2 lb. steamed lobster.
* Serves authentic Chinese cuisine; well-known for their Kung Pao Gar Ding, Hot & Sour soup, and friendly service.
* "Asian Fusion" cuisine. Formerly a Lebanese restaurant, their menu now contains Lebanese, Indonesian, and Canadian items. Impressively tasty food for a good price. Great Indonesian curries.

*Rated by ZAGAT as the #1 for service and the #2 for food in PEI, the Northern Italian owner Italo and his Italian chef Antonio serve authentic Italian regional specialties that take advantage of the Island's seafood.

Sleep
There is no reason to stay at a chain hotel or motel in Charlottetown. The city is dotted with some of the cutest, and most comfortable, Inns and B&Bs you can imagine. All offer fantastic service and most have locations that allow you to walk downtown. They will often be cheaper and offer much more comfortable accommodations than a hotel. These places live and die by their reputation, so most innkeepers are incredibly helpful.

* Only hostel in Charlottetown. Single-sex dorms, co-ed dorms, and private rooms available. Free wifi and internet terminals. Open April to October.

* Elmwood Heritage Inn was the first 5-Star Bed&Breakfast in Charlottetown and is still one of the best. InnKeepers Jay and Carol are known to be some of the most helpful.

* The Great George Charlottetown's Historic Boutique Hotel. Probably the best location in all of Charlottetown. It is getting pricier over time, but it is probably still one of the best overall values in town. It is right in the middle of it all.

* Fitzroy Hall is another well located Bed& Beakfast and is typically well maintained. The Shipwright Inn is right next door and is highly rated, and The Dundee Arms is right across the street and is an Inn with an attached motel. The Dundee has a nice pub frequented by locals.
