Get in
Camarillo is served by more and more frequent Amtrak and Metrolink Commuter Rail service from San Diego, Orange County, Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley to the south and San Luis Obispo to the north. The station is located at the intersection of Lewis Road and Ventura Road at one end of Old Town. The From here, you are not far from many eateries, a wonderful Saturday morning farmer's market and the famous Camarillo Premium Outlets. Several destinations, including the train station and the Camarillo Premium Outlets, are served by VISTA inter-city bus routes. Most people, however, will chose to drive and that is very easy, given that Camarillo is right on the US 101 Freeway. Camarillo Airport (CMA/KCMA) is a major general aviation hub.

Get around
Camarillo has the CAT (Camarillo Area Transit) bus service. The fixed routes are limited, but they have a dail-a-ride service that will pick you up and take you anywhere in the city for $2.
