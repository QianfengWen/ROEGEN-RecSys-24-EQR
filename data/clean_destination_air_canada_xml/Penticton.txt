Penticton (The 'Peach City') is a beautiful spot in the south nestled between two lakes: The 155km long Okanagan Lake to the north, and the smaller Skaha Lake to the south. Tourism in Penticton is largely seasonal. In the summer tourists double Penticton's population to 60,000. Historically, in the winter things were very quiet, but now that World Cup Freestyle Skiing stops at local Apex Mountain every winter, the winter scene is picking up. 

Understand
This area has been inhabited for thousands of years by the Salish group of First Nations people. They called their settlement in this area Snpinkten which translates as 'a place to stay forever' and gives Penticton its name. The first non-native settler Thomas Ellis preempted land in Penticton in 1869 and started a very successful cattle ranch. The arrival of steamboat service in 1892 with the C.P.R. paddlewheeler S.S. Aberdeen started the growth of Penticton, bringing settlers and immigrants, supplies for the mining community of Fairview south of Penticton and the area's cattle ranches and orchards.

With the arrival of engineering marvel Kettle Valley Railway the boom in Penticton had begun. Penticton was officially given life as a municipality in 1908, and received 'city' status in 1948.

Since the beginning Penticton's climate was well suited for agriculture, and thousands of fruit trees were planted all along the west and east bench areas overlooking Okanagan Lake. From cherries in early July to apples and pears in early September, Penticton has always been a large producer and exporter of non-citrus tree fruit. Many local oldtimers decry the trend of ripping out perfectly healthy and productive orchards for the more lucrative vineyards which supply grapes for the regions more than thirty boutique wineries. Today Penticton's two largest industries are tourism and the growing wine industry, which threatens to eclipse the fruit production industry.

Penticton's climate and geography is a northern, four-seasons version of what some call mediterranean. Large clay banks, benches, and scrubland skirt the mid-level mountains that frame the valley on the east and west sides. Summers are hot with an average temperature of 27C, and peaks of 35-40C are not unheard of. The large size of Okanagan Lake tempers the climate in winter which sees an average high of 0.9C in January. It can and does snow occasionally, but generally only during December and January will it accumulate in modest quantities. You can check the snow level with a quick glance to the mountains, which will have a white apron about half to three-quarters of the way up. Penticton sees about 2000 hours of sun per year, which is a higher average than .

* The Peach is a concession stand located at the foot of Winnipeg Street on Okanagan Lake shaped and painted as a giant peach. While it isn't that interesting in and of itself, it has an interesting history and is one of the most photographed spots in town. Film buffs may recognize it from the movie My American Cousin which was filmed in the Penticton Area. Note that this is actually the second Peach, as the first was pushed into the lake during the 1990 Peachfest riot (Note: The riot was an isolated incident, Penticton is really quite safe). 

* Munson Mountain Park is home to the large 'Penticton' sign (a la 'Hollywood') that greets travelers coming in to town from the north. The sign was created with thousands of small white stones. The original stones have since been replaced with letters made of concrete. The park itself affords visitors with stunning 360 degree panoramas of the South Okanagan valley. To get there head east on Vancouver Ave. and follow the signs.

* Challenge Canada, The last Sunday in August sees Penticton pretty much shutdown as everyone moves to Lakeshore and Main Street to watch the thousands of competitors in the triathlon.

Wineries and Viticulture

The immediate Penticton area has many wineries, and indeed more seem to spring up everyday. The terroir of the Naramata Bench is considered the premier wine growing region of British Columbia for its climate and geography (though growers in the Golden Mile region of to the south may disagree). The popularity of this relatively new industry has driven the price of local products well over the price of a comparable French or Italian bottle. Most wineries offer free tastings and tours, and will almost certainly sell their products directly. To be sure of the best quality look for bottles that sport the VQA designation, which ensures authenticity of origin, and a minimum standard of quality during grape growth, harvest, and production.

* Bonitas Winery offers a Mediterranean style winery with award winning wines and sun-drenched patios on Okanagan Lake. Additionally, unique heli-wine tours offer views from above.

Do

Outdoors

Perhaps the best thing to do in Penticton is to join the locals at the beach, and enjoy the blisteringly hot summer sun. Okanagan Beach follows pretty much the entirety of Lakeshore Drive on Okanagan Lake, and is generally the more family oriented beach. Skaha Beach to the south on Skaha Lake is where Penticton's younger crowd go to see and be seen. Sudbury Beach and Airport Beach are also on Skaha Lake, located west of Skaha Beach on the south side of Highway 97 (Caution: Sudbury is used as a kitesurf launch during the off-season.). Three Mile Beach is a good bet when the crowds at the other beaches are getting you down. Located just north of town, follow Naramata Road north, turn left at Three Mile Road, and follow down to the lake. If you walk along the beach to the north you will find an unofficial nudist area. 

Golfers will find themselves at home, with four golf courses in the city limits, and several more just beyond:
* Pine Hills/Sage Mesa, 3610 Pine Hill Drive, +1 250 492-5731. Two different 18 hole courses set high on a plateau overlooking Penticton and the lakes.
* Penticton Golf and Country Club, 600 Comox St, +1 250 492-5626, Don't let the name fool you, the public is welcome. $27 for 9 holes; $50 for 18.

* Mini Golf, 75 Riverside (just steps from the S.S. Sicamous), Family-friendly outdoor mini golf course. Adults $8, children $6.

 will want to check out the renowned Skaha Climbing Bluffs located adjacent to Skaha Lake on the southern edge of the city. Access is controlled and a daily access fee is charged to hike into the bluffs, see for maps and details. "Skaha" as it is known among climbers, has over four hundred established routes with a near equal split of traditional (gear) and sport (fixed bolt) lines that range between 5.6 and 5.13b. An excellent guide book is available locally and provides a map, directions, and grades (Yosemite).

Cyclists and hikers will want to visit the stunning Kettle Valley Trail which follows the old railway grade from Penticton through Naramata's bench wineries, and farther along, a system of tunnels and trestles leading all the way to Castlegar and beyond, some several hundreds of kilometers. Part of the Trans-Canada Trail which bills itself as the longest recreational trail in the world. You can also travel the railway grade on the opposite side of the lake 10km to Summerland which is gatewayed by the dramatic Trout Creek Railway Trestle, the highest in British Columbia.

Another traditional pastime in Penticton is floating down the River Channel, which is a small shallow river that flows south from Okanagan Lake to Skaha Lake. This leisurely trip takes from 2 to 3.5 hours depending on water levels in the channel. Be sure to bring sunscreen or you will burn up! Coyote Cruises (215 Riverside, +1 250 492-2115) operates a shuttle bus service to transport you back to the parking area on the north side of town. $2 for them to inflate your tube or they also provide tube rentals if you don't have your own. $10 for tire inter-tube and transportation. If you have your flotation device and can work out the logistics of getting a ride and keeping your valuables dry you can do the full channel for free. Otherwise Coyote Cruises is a convenient way to go but only covers about half the channel length.

Festivals

Penticton is also a city of events and festivals. Indeed, in the summer there is rarely a time when there isn't some sort of festival going on. Dates and venues can change from year to year, check the websites for current information. A brief survey of the major festivals includes: 

* Okanagan Fest-of-Ale April). This two day festival pairs local breweries with local restaurants to show off their wares alongside live entertainment. Hundreds of locals volunteer for the free beer.
* Penticton Elvis Festival (Late June). Despised by some of the locals, and criticized due to prohibitive costs, this festival brings the best of the best of Elvis impersonators to town. Some free events.
* Peach City Beach Cruise (late June). This crowd favorite brings over 400 hot-rods and classic cars from all over to Lakeshore Drive. The road is closed to normal traffic allowing close up views of the cars. At night some of the drivers put on a smoke show to the delight of the crowd, though police seem to be cracking down on this lately. Lasts three days.
* Penticton Highland Games (early July). Come watch the caber toss and other heavy events accompanied by traditional Scottish pipes, drumming, and dancing. If you have what it takes you can register and compete.
* Beach Blanket Film Festival (late July). This unique festival invites people to lay down a blanket on the beach, bring a picnic and watch films on a floating screen in Okanagan Lake.
* Peachfest (August). Long since stripped of its 'party get drunk' image of the past, Peachfest is now an event to be enjoyed by the entire family. Includes arts/crafts exhibits, food and drink, live entertainment, parades, fireworks and much more.
* Pentastic Hot Jazz Festival (mid September). Various venues host live Dixieland, Jive, Swing, and other forms of Jazz music.
* Okanagan Fall Wine Festival (September-October). More of an 'Okanagan' festival than a Penticton one. Many wine-diner pairings featuring local wineries and restaurants, stretching from Osoyoos (at the US/Canada border) to Vernon at the northern end of Lake Okanagan. Several of these take place in Penticton.

Nightclubs

There are only two in town and they are both pretty much the same. Loud top-40 music and the occasional live show. Covers are reasonable: $2-$7, more if there is a special event. Smoking is prohibited in all bars, but The Mule has a separate outdoor smoking room. The clubs start to get busy between 11PM and midnight in the summer. You may want to show up early to avoid the queue. If one is empty, try another, as they are within walking distance of each other, and business generally depends on the nightly drink special. This doesn't apply as much in the summer when they are both generally packed. At 2:30AM hundreds of drunken revelers pour out into the streets, causing a large police presence to keep the peace. Do not taunt the police unless you want to spend a night in the drunk tank! (Hint: you don't).

* The Mule, 218 Martin. The Mule used to be a country bar, but they changed the format to get more business several years ago. You may still hear a few country songs throughout the night however. The Mule seems to be the most popular these days. Wednesday nights feature $2 highballs, the locals buy triples in a mini-jug to avoid long bar lineups. Three bars plus table service. This is one of the best clubs in town. It is famous for its smiles and music of all styles. The service is great and the bar is clean. Anyone from 19-99 will feel very welcome there.

Sleep

As with restaurants, the amount of accommodations available in Penticton is disproportionate compared to the size of the city. Still, Penticton is very popular in the summer and the area hotels can and will be fully booked, especially on long weekends and Ironman weekend. Prices listed here are high season, as this is when most visitors come. Low and shoulder season rates may be drastically lower depending on the facility. The listings here are but a mere smattering of what's available.

Stay safe

There is not much to worry about in Penticton. The streets are generally safe after dark and the huge amount of tourists on the streets ensures you are never alone. The biggest safety issue may be the occasional bar brawl that occurs when the clubs close. Make sure you do not get involved or you will end up spending the night in jail.

If you are hiking or biking in the surrounding hills be aware the area is home to rattlesnakes and bears. The snakes, easily detected by their distinctive rattle, do not attack humans unless you enter their space and/or startle them -- such as abruptly walking into one along a trail. If you hear the rattle, understand it as a warning and keep your distance; the snake's bite can be fatal. Similarly, black bears inhabit the region surrounding Penticton and are happy to avoid humans unless surprised, cornered, and/or their cubs are threatened. Bear attacks are extremely rare but if you spot a bear in the area, it is best to steer clear. Cougars are being spotted by the locals more
