Orientation

Tampa is divided into five main districts fanning out from Downtown in the south-center between the Hillsborough River and Ybor Channel. West Tampa, once a separate city, lies across the Hillsborough River to the west of Downtown. South Tampa, a large residential area, extends south along the Interbay Peninsula. Historic Ybor City (sometimes considered a part of downtown) lies on the northeast side of downtown. East Tampa, the historically African-American side of the city, lies north of Ybor City. North Tampa forms the urban/suburban sprawl north of Busch Boulevard. A significant suburban area, often considered a part of "Tampa", extends many miles to the northwest, north, and east of the city.

Within Tampa proper, there are six official "historical districts" (Hampton Terrace, Hyde Park, Seminole Heights, Tampa Heights, Historic West Tampa, Ybor City) and at least 86 named neighborhoods.

History

The Tampa Bay area was visited by many Spanish explorers, beginning with Panfilo de Narvaez in 1528. However, no long term permanent settlements were created until 1824 when the US federal government created a reservation for north Florida Seminole Indians. At the same time, the US created Fort Brooke to oversee the reservation as well as protect the strategic harbor. 

The 1880s saw the town's first population boom. In 1883, phosphate was discovered in the area, spurring the development of the mining and shipping industries in the area. Shortly after, Henry B. Plant completed work on his railroad linking Tampa to Jacksonville. He began promoting Tampa as a holiday spot and built the grand Plant Hotel as a luxury resort destination. In 1886, Vicente Martinez Ybor opened Tampa's first cigar factory in Ybor City which encouraged the immigration of many Spanish, Cuban and Italian (primarily Sicilian) workers.
During the Spanish American War at the turn of the century, Tampa was the main port of departure for troops heading for Cuba. During this time, the Plant Hotel was converted into officer's accommodations, housing the Rough Riders and Teddy Roosevelt.

In more recent times, MacDill Air Force Base was created in 1939 and the University of South Florida in 1956. Over the course of the Twentieth Century, Tampa has grown into the center of a large metropolitan area; it now hosts the regional headquarters of many international companies, has acquired numerous professional sports teams, and has even bid for the summer Olympics. 

People

Tampa is a very diverse city. The first residents were the members of the Seminole Indian tribe that was relocated there from northern Florida and the soldiers stationed at Fort Brook to control the reservation. The town remained a mostly military town until the 1880s when Tampa saw its first major waves of immigration from Cuba, Spain and Sicily. The major growth of the area did not occur until air conditioning became common in the years after World War II, but the region has been growing steadily since then. Tampa is now home to many native Floridians, including Seminoles, Cubans, Spaniards and Italians, as well the residence of many 'transplants' from the Midwest and other areas of the states and new immigrants from the Caribbean and central America. Tampa's population swells during the winter months with the arrival of the 'snowbirds,' retired persons from the northern U.S. and Canada who come down for a few months to enjoy the relative warmth.

Economy

Tampa has a growing economy and serves as a major port. Among others, Raymond James, Home Shopping Network, Outback Steakhouse, and a major portion of Citigroup are all headquartered in Tampa. Tampa's major industries today are phosphate mining, shipping, citrus processing, shrimping, and tourism.

Weather

Tampa has a humid subtropical climate. It is located on the Gulf of Mexico allows the warm Gulf Stream to create mild winter weather. However, cold snaps do occur in winter in Tampa occasionally, bringing temperatures at night around freezing. Temperatures in the teens, and snow, have been recorded. However, this is very rare. From spring through fall, weather is very warm and humid, sometimes making the weather unpleasant for outdoor activities.

The main freeways in Tampa are Interstate 275, Interstate 4, the Veterans Expressway (toll FL 589), and the Leroy Selmon Crosstown Expressway (toll FL 618). Some of the main east-west roads through town are Kennedy Boulevard (SR 60), Gandy Boulevard (SR 694), Hillsborough Avenue (US 92) and Fowler Avenue (SR 582), while some of the north-south roads are Dale Mabry Highway (US 92) and Florida/Nebraska Avenue (US 41). Traffic is especially bad during the rush hours: from about 7:30 to 9:30 AM and 3:30PM to 7:30PM. During these times, try especially to avoid I-275, especially between I-4 and SR 60 (by the airport) as this section runs by downtown and is currently being rebuilt.

Luxury limousines, sedans, and party buses are available for rent with Tampa Limousine VIP. 

By bus

HART, provides extensive bus service throughout Hillsborough County. There are three types of routes offered: "local", "Commuter Express", and Trollies (see below).

The line is useful for tourists and convention goers. The line runs by many local shops, restaurants, and attractions including the convention center/ Embassy Suites, the Tampa Bay Times Forum, Channelside, the Florida Aquarium, and through Ybor City. There are 3 types of streetcars in operation: 9 "Birney Safety" replicas (picture, right), one "Breezer" open-air replica (picture, left), and one original "Birney" car (#163, not pictured) which operated in Tampa from 1923-1946 and went through 10,000 man-hours of restoration.

As of May 2012, a one-way fare is $2.50. A one-day, unlimited rides pass for streetcars and trollies is available for $5.

Splurge
* Considered to be one of the best steakhouses in Florida: it claims to have the largest privately owned wine lists in the world, with over 7000 labels and a million bottles. It is commonplace to have a tour of the kitchen and wine cellar after dinner, but expect to spend at least a few hours. Their menu is host to some cuts not often found in American steakhouses.

* A bit cheaper than the Columbia Restaurant, yet the quality seems to be much better.

* Spanish, a landmark in the Ybor City neighborhood since 1905. One of the few places in the country and the only restaurant in the area that serves the originally cut Delmonico steaks.

* 

* 

* Outstanding choice to enjoy a Prime steak, glass of wine or handcrafted cocktail. 

Drink

* Ybor City is a historic area of Tampa which now hosts the region's best known bar and nightclub district. It is a nationally known arts/bar/dining district and one could take several days visiting all of the bars and places to eat here. You can find any type of bar, from punk rock/metal, hip-hop, house, blues, indie, country, or dive. Strong LGBT scene, especially in the western quarter of the district, which has been designated as GaYbor.
**Tampa Bay Brewing Company 1600 E. 8th Avenue, Ybor City section of Tampa. Tel. (813) 247-1422. Good variety of well made beers.

*Hyde Park is the epicenter for upscale and trendy nightlife in the bay area. Myriad upmarket bars are accounted for, fancy restaurants that feature a bar scene after dark, plus almost as many dance clubs as Ybor City. The crowd in these clubs is a bit older and swankier than Ybor.
**Ciro's Speakeasy 2109 Bayshore Blvd. Tampa, a few blocks south of most SoHo action but worth it. Tel. 813.251.0022. Upscale but mellow haven for high-end mixology.

*Channelside also has plenty of nightlife. For the cooler local joints, stay away from the Bay Plaza and explore the alleyways between all the condo towers, especially 12th Street. Downtown also has a burgeoning bar scene and is easily accessible by streetcar or simply walking west on Kennedy or Twiggs.

*Seminole Hard Rock Casino is an upscale 24-hour venue featuring loads of bars, a Hard Rock cafe, and of course games.

*International Plaza, that upscale mall mentioned above, has a solid nightlife scene in the outdoor Bay Street alley.

*Seminole Heights is about two miles north of downtown, a beautiful historic neighborhood with a more bohemian scene. It is unfortunately not dense for barhopping, but there's still a good range of bars here with a "hipster" vibe well worth checking out.
**Independent Bar 5016 N Florida Ave, Tampa. Tel. (813) 341-4883. Hipster microbrew gastropub hangout.

*USF is a huge college about 12 miles north of downtown. Within a two mile radius of campus there are quite a few bars and a couple clubs, mainly catering to the student set and alumni. Unfortunately no critical mass for barhopping.

* Cigar City Brewing 3924 West Spruce Street, West Tampa section of Tampa close to Dale Mabry and International Plaza. Tel. (813) 348-6363. Very popular craft brewery with a tasting room.

Stay safe
Be aware while in Suitcase City, the part of town surrounding Busch Gardens, USF and University Square Mall. Hitchhiking is also prevalent in this area, but do not stop! East Tampa also has some rough areas, but overall not much to worry about. Sulphur Springs north of Seminole Heights, and Old West Tampa west of Downtown across the river are also a bit shady but it's kept to a dull roar all over the city mostly.
