Changchun (长春; Chángchūn; lit. Long Spring) is the capital of Province and was formerly the capital of the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo. With a population of more than 6 million, it is one of the major cities in Northeast China (东北; Dōngběi), and is the largest center for China's automotive industry. In 2007, the city hosted the Asian Winter Games.

History

The ancient period
Changchun in its present form is a new city with only about 200 years of history. 
But there used to be a city thousands years ago known by different names. The ancient city had changed its name several times, 'Xidu','Helong', 'Tiangang'（Han Dynasty）, 'Shushan'（Tang Dynasty）,'Longzhou'（Liao Dynasty）, and 'Kuancheng'(Jin Dynasty). At last, Kuancheng was destroyed by the Mongolian army, leaving nothing except mention of their conquering in the annals of history .

In 1800(Qing Dynasty), Emperor Jiaqing decided to build a town, as one of the junctions on the way from the capital , to the , the holy mountain of the Qing royalty. The Emperor gave the reborn town a name with blessing : 'Changchun'. In some tales, this new name came from a couplet made by the Emperor Qianlong, the father of Jiaqing. This couplet was made when the old emperor on his way to the Changbai Mountains, to praise the spring-like summer of the Changchun area.

The Semicolonial period
After defeating China in the first Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), had desires to expand, including plans to overtake the eastern lands of Fengtian Province (Liaoning Province today) from China. This expansion clashed with the wishes of , , and ; Japan had to settle for money from China instead (about 30 million liang). For their part, Russia got the rights to build a railway in the sought-after lands. 

In 1896, Russia built a railway station and a settlement in Changchun.

In 1906, Japan defeated Russia in the Russo-Japanese War, and gained the right of the railway in southern Northeast China. Changchun became the junction between the Japanese-owned South Manchurian Railway and the Russian-owned Chinese Eastern Railway, which had different rail gauges and permit licenses. There were railway repair shops, and branch lines originating in Changchun extended into Korea and . An epidemic of pneumonia occurred in many parts of Manchuria from 1910-11. 

On 18 September, 1931, Japan invaded Manchuria. The leader of the area, Zhang Xueliang, commanded his army to retreat without counterattack, and pinned all his hopes on the intercession of the League of Nations.

The city's name was changed on 1 March, 1932, to Xinjing (新京), the capital of Manchukuo, and Pu Yi, the last emperor of the Qing Dynasty, was its designated overseer. The new tenants gave it a grand blueprint with broad avenues and modern public works. The city underwent rapid expansion in both economy and infrastructure and provided materials for Japan's wars.

The Civil War
The area changed hands again when on 20 August, 1944, the Soviet army took over the city. They stayed until 4 April, 1946, and took away all the machines and materials they could move. At that time, the army of the Republic of China took over the city. Two months later, the Chinese Civil War began, and Changchun once again became a battlefield.

From May to October of 1948, the Kuomintang army was besieged by the Communist army. The Kuomintang army looted food from citizens and the Communist forbade anybody to leave. Upwards of 300,000 citizens may have died in this siege from starvation, but the details of this are not usually discussed openly. At last, the Kuomintang army surrendered and the Communist army got the city.

Today
After the Civil War, Changchun became the capital of Jilin Province in September of 1954. Nowadays, it is a quiet northern city having short, windy springs and cool summers, as it has enjoyed since before all the wars. It is also an important domestic optical research centers, along with automobile and train manufacturing bases. 

New train tracks have been laid, decades after world powers fought for resources. On 27 May, 2010, China's fastest high speed train, the 380A which can reach 380 km/hr, began operations as the city continues to make its own history.

Districts
Changchun has a total of 6 districts, 3 other cities and 1 county. Five of the districts are close to the city centre: 
* Chaoyang District (朝阳区) 
* Nanguan District (南关区)
* Kuancheng District (宽城区)
* Erdao District (二道区)
* Luyuan District (绿园区)

Further afield are: 
* Shuangyang District (双阳区)
* West New City Development District (西部新城开发区）
* Yushu City (榆树市)
* Dehui City (德惠市)
* Jiutai City (九台市)
* Nong'an County (农安县) 

The city is home to the following special economic zones:

Climate

Changchun has a monsoon-influenced climate, with great seasonal temperature extremes. Winters are long, very cold, and windy, with a January high of −10 °C (14°F). However there is little snow and the air is dry. Summers are very warm and humid, with extended periods of 30°C (86°F) highs, though the average high in July is 28°C (82°F).

Get in

By plane
Changchun Longjia International Airport (长春龙家国际机场; IATA: CGQ) has been in operation since September 2005 and is around 30 km east of city center. It has recently been expanded with the opening of a second terminal in 2019. Longjia replaced a smaller military airport that had been adapted for commercial use. The airport is large and clean, and passengers can find standard amenities such as restaurants, cafes, shops, lounges, credit card acceptance, etc. For first class passengers there are two lounges available, but the standard is far below of the lounges of international airports. 

Different local flight destinations are available, but the major routes throughout the day are to domestic destinations (2:20 hours) and Beijing (1:40 hours). There are also some international flights to , , , and 

From the airport there are regular coach services (¥20-30 one way) available to the center (e.g. People's Square (人民广场)). Travel time is around 45 minutes. A taxi to/from the city costs around ¥80 including toll, but from the airport to the city most of the taxi drivers reject a drive if you are not willing to pay at least ¥100 (do not discuss it, do it or take the bus). The most convenient transport to the city is by train from Longjia station, which is directly connected to the airport by a walkway underneath the parking lot. The fare to Changchun main station (15 minutes away) is a very modest ¥8.50. Trains run approximately every hour, and you can find a schedule online. Note that to reach the ticket office, you actually have to "exit" the train station (riding the escalator up to ground level), only to reenter the main doors of the train station. To purchase a train ticket, you will need to provide the ticket agent with your ID or passport. Fares are UnionPay or cash only.

A small cluster of ATMs are available at the departures level and accept international cards.

By train
Changchun has four passenger railway stations: Changchun Railway Station (长春站), Changchun West Railway Station (长春西站), Changchun East Railway Station (长春东站) and Changchun South Railway Station (长春南站). The latter two stations are very small and only local trains stop there.

Changchun Railway Station (长春站; Changchun Zhan) is situated at the north end of Renmin Avenue (人民大街). Although it is large and chaotic, providing you read Chinese and speak some Mandarin and are prepared to fight through the queues, you can buy a ticket to almost anywhere in China from here. Some of the staff at the ticket office may speak modest amounts of English.

Changchun West Railway Station (长春西站) started operating in December 2013. Fast trains to e.g. Beijing, Shenyang and Harbin leave from here.The station is located close to FAW-VW.

If you need to get between Changchun West Railway Station and Changchun Railway Station, you can take a taxi for about ¥30. The ride takes around 35 minutes, but budget for traffic. There is a new subway connection. Take the line 2 subway eastbound to Jiefang Dalu Station and change for the Line 1 train northbound to Changchun Beizhan. Subway takes about 30 minutes and the fare is ¥3.

Thanks to the railroad-building efforts of Japanese in the early- to mid-1900s, the rail network in Northeast China is extensive and no place is very far by rail. 

Rail travel is by far the cheapest way to travel in and out of Changchun. If you do not want to go to the train station yourself, you can go to any good travel agent who will do this on your behalf, usually for ¥10-20 extra.

By bus
There are long distance coaches that regularly go from/to Beijing available from the coach station on Huanghe Road (黄河路), just off Renmin Avenue (人民大街). There is also a long distance bus station at the south end of Renmin Avenue (take bus Z306 from the train station). 

You can also catch coaches and buses from pretty much anywhere in Jilin Province, though they have a reputation for being dangerous and are slightly more expensive, though faster, than the train.

The main Long-Distance Bus Station is at 226 Renmin Avenue.
* Beijing - takes about 8 hours
* Dalian - takes about 8 hours
* Harbin - takes about 4 hours
* Jilin - takes about 2 hours
* Shenyang - takes about 4 hours

Get around
Changchun is a very compact city planned by the Japanese with a layout of open avenues and public squares (guǎngchǎng). It is pretty easy to travel from one place to another; however, with the increase in private car ownership, traffic is getting worse by the day. 

By taxi
Taxis are by far the best way to get around. They are cheap but you should have a piece of paper with the address in case you do not speak Mandarin.
Taxi fares start at ¥5 up to 2.5 km (plus a mandatory ¥1 fuel surtax), after that ¥1.30/.5 km. Several taxi companies are serving the city and they rarely try to cheat you. It is common for drivers to pick up other passengers who might be going in the same direction if there are unused seats, beware if taxi driver starts to take the other passangers to far away places(not same directions) and try to make you pay for the whole trip taximeter.

Taxi drivers might ask for extra ¥1 to ¥2 if you ask for taxi invoice (fapiao).

However, in case driver is taking you in circles - in this case complain for example at the hotel drop-off point. The staff there normally will support you in such cases. For other cases simply pay not more then shown on the meter. In general: Make sure you know the name of the places you are going to in Mandarin or have a paper with the Chinese address with you. It would not hurt either to travel during the day and have one of Shangri-La's English maps, or even one in Chinese from Xinhua bookstore.

On foot
From May to October, Changchun is a decent walking city, as the weather is fine and there are no hills. The city does tend to be spread out, so travelers should plan on using other forms of transportation. During the winter months temperatures are too cold to walk longer distances in Changchun, so other forms of transport should be considered.

By light rail
The light rail (轻轨; qīngguǐ) currently goes from the west side of the train station (长春站) to Changying Movie Wonderland (长影世纪城). It travels past Changchun University (长春大学) approximately half-way along the route, and takes 63 minutes to complete the entire journey. A ticket, purchased at any light rail station, costs ¥1-4 each way, based on the distance traveled. Operates 6AM-9PM daily.

The new South-North line is fully open.

By bus
An extensive bus network and most of the buses cost ¥1; however, those who can not read Chinese will find it nearly impossible to use the network.

Most buses go to the bus station outside the train station, and other central areas such as Guilin Road (桂林路), Chongqing Road (重庆路) and Hongqi Street (红旗街). Be aware that the buses are often extremely crowded and especially uncomfortable during the hot summers as there is no air conditioning.

Important bus numbers include:

*362 - 6AM-8:30PM daily. From the train station to Hongqi Street (红旗街), Chongqing Road (重庆路) and Guilin Road (桂林路). 

*306 - 5:50AM-11PM daily. Busy route that goes north/south along Renmin Avenue (人民大街) from the train station to Changchun University (长春大学). 

*80 - 6AM-8PM daily. Circular route around Changchun that goes pretty much everywhere including Hongqi Street (红旗街), Chongqing Road (重庆路), Guilin Road (桂林路), the train station and the zoo. 

*240 - 6AM-7:30PM. Satellite Square (卫星广场) to Culture Square (文化广场) via Guilin Road (桂林路).

By tram
Despite the city once having the most complex tram system in Northern China, there is now only one remaining route still open. The number 54 runs down Hongqi Street (红旗街) to the far west of the city (where there really is not much). Many of the trams still in use today are the original cars from 1940, so it is worth the ¥1 ride just for the experience of yesteryear.

By minibus
If you are in need of an adrenaline rush, look no further than one of the minibuses that tear around the city streets. Some places out in the suburbs are only serviced by such buses, and the fare is usually ¥1-2, but the drivers seem to think that they are on a giant racetrack most of the time and you will get thrown around. Expect the front passenger to sit at the side-door, calling out to potential customers, and to be encouraged to hop on the bus while it is moving ever so slowly. If you were old, they would probably stop, or expect you to take a taxi for a little more. Very crowded at times.

By bicycle
Travelers should be cautious of bicycling in Changchun. For half the year it is generally too cold and during the summer months, too dangerous. Unlike other big cities in China, Changchun does not separate cycle lanes from the main traffic, which leads to buses, taxis, cars, and motorcycles sharing the same space as the cyclists. The whole situation is dangerous and this is perhaps the reason why by Chinese standards there are few people who regularly cycle here. The other problem is that because of the city's layout, there are plenty of large roundabouts where 4 or 5 busy roads converge on one another, making it extremely difficult to cycle without having to continually dismount.

If you want to bike around, it is recommended that you follow closely behind one of the local people on cargo-bike, merchant-bike, or donkey. There are off times during the day when biking would be less challenging. Drivers are not overly aggressive towards bikers.

By three-wheeler
There are brightly coloured three wheel plastic taxis, available from near Changchun University (长春大学), which only operate for short distances in the south of the city. If you are in the Jingyuetan (净月潭) part of town, this is the easiest mode of transport as there are few taxis operating there. It is fairly easy to find a taxi anywhere in Jingyuetan. They are cheaper and slower than regular taxis. There is no meter, so expect to negotiate with the driver. A typical ride should not exceed ¥5.

By motorcycle
If you need to get somewhere fast then jump on one of these. They generally hang around in the south of the city and out in the suburbs. They are unlicensed to carry fare paying passengers, so bear in mind that if there is an accident, you might find yourself in trouble. However, they tend to drive in the cycle lanes at quite low speeds and so are safer than you might expect. Expect to pay as little as ¥1 for a short trip.

See
* A large park which is a favorite picnic and recreation spot for locals. In the summer, the lake is used for boating and water sports, and there is a stand of huge lotus plants near one part of it. In the winter, the lake freezes over and serves as a natural skating rink. In winter months it's a romantic and quiet place - but you have to suffer the low winter temperatures. The park almost feels like it is not part of a city, except that there is a good view of the skyscrapers in downtown Changchun across the lake. The park is a very safe place to wander around in the early evening.

* Starting north of the crossroads of Xinmin Dajie (新民大街) and Jiefang Dalu (解放大路), is a pleasant urban hangout which offers a glimpse into Changchun's Japanese imperial past. The square is surrounded by several historical buildings from the Manchukuo era. On the north end of the square sits the majestic former New Palace of the Emperor of Manchukuo (新帝宫), which was intended to replace the Puppet Imperial Palace mentioned below. On the south end of the square are the former Manchukuo State Council and Military Affairs buildings. These buildings, which are now affiliated with Jilin University, offer prime examples of early Twentieth Century Japanese architecture. On the square, vendors sell kites and various other products. Many people fly kites from this square, while others play traditional Chinese instruments or just sit and relax. More formal performances are sometimes held on a temporary stage set up near the high school. For casual visitors to Changchun, this is probably a good place to visit by taxi. 

* Another place to visit to take in historical Manchukuo. The palace was the home of Pu Yi, the last emperor of China and puppet emperor of Manchukuo, and this centre of the Manchukuo administration may be worth a visit. Signage is available in English (and Japanese) although many of the artifact descriptions are in Chinese only. There is an audio tour rental fee of ¥20 although the recordings do not add much to what is already provided by the signage (¥100 deposit for equipment). The grounds are nicely restored since nearly all buildings were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution. Scenes from the acclaimed 1987 film The Last Emperor were filmed here.

* It is the largest man-made forest park in Asia, and a great place for skiing in the winter.

* In the Chaoyang District around the cross streets of Xi'an Lu (西安路), Renmin Dajie (人民大街), and Changchun Dajie (长春大街). It is one of the focal points of Changchun. It is close to Baishan Park (白山公园), and a mini "Culture Square" of sorts. The site commemorates the Russian soldiers, and specifically Russian pilots that died to liberate Changchun during the Second World War.

Do

* The park offers activities such as a petting zoo and bumper cars (summer) and a frozen pond for skating (winter).

Learn
Changchun is a very good place to study Mandarin. The following places provide various courses for all levels:

* Jilin University (吉林大学)

* Changchun University (长春大学)

* Changchun Normal University (长春师范大学)

* Changchun University of Technology (长春工业大学)

* Northeast Normal University (东北师范大学)

There are also private training centers that will provide either small group Mandarin lessons, one-on-one lessons, or even a home tutor. The rates are around ¥40 for a one hour or longer lesson with a professional teacher.

Buy

Currency exchange is available at the airport, various hotels and banks, including Bank of China on Xi'an Dalu (西安大路）.

There are three major shopping areas: Chongqing Road (重庆路; Chóngqìnglù), Guilin Road (桂林路; Guìlinlù), and Hongqi Street (红旗街; Hóngqíjiē).

Local products
* Ginseng - as the region around Changchun is a top producer of ginseng, it is available at most pharmacies in the city. 

* Kites - attractive and cheap kites are sold by vendors around Culture Square.

Shops
* Sanfo is the leading outdoor gear stores in China and local store is at 668 Xikang Hutong, Ziyou Dalu District.

* People's Square Here is the biggest selection of clothing shops and department stores in the whole city. Shopping runs along both Xi'an Da Lu and Changchun St. A well-visited mall, Charter Mall, (Zhuōzhǎn 卓展), on Xi'an Da Lu across from the Shangri-la Hotel. One can find luxury brands co-existing with the likes of Wal-Mart. 

* Guilin Road (桂林路) area is about 1.5 km (2.5 mi) to the south of Chongqing Rd along Tongzhi Jie (同志街) and is the most cosmopolitan part of town. The area along Guilin Lu, Tongzhi St, and the surrounding side streets offer much to see, buy, and eat. There are many restaurants in this area especially if you are interested in Korean food. Be careful with Korean food in Changchun as many Korean restaurants specialize in "Dog pot." There is less overall choice than Chongqing Lu, but if you are looking for specifics - e.g. Korean fashions then is the best place in town - though the shops in this area are a little more expensive. This area can be extremely busy, and it is definitely a target area for younger shoppers. Many places will not haggle price.

* Hongqi Street (红旗街) is to the west of Guilin Lu and is the smallest of the three shopping areas. It is dominated by one of the better department stores in Changchun: Ouya (欧亚). The 6th-8th floors of Ouya contain the largest electronics market in the city. You can find anything electronic here, from mp3 players to laptops. Prices can be very high.

* The Underground Markets (Dìxià Shìchǎng 地下市场): These are now extensive underground shopping areas, originally dug out by POWs during the occupation, intended to be used as bomb shelters. There are three of these places in Changchun: Chongqing Lu (重庆路), the Train Station (长春站), and Hongqi Jie (红旗街). If you want anything cheap (and probably fake) then these are the places to come. There are hundreds of small shops selling relatively undifferentiated products, and the term buyer beware definitely applies. There are some good deals to be had, but some products are poor quality and have high ticket prices. Therefore, be prepared to haggle as the shopkeepers will try to get you to pay the sticker price, which the local shoppers will never pay. If you don't speak Chinese, bring a pen and paper to help negotiate your price. Start at 50% to 75% off the ticketed price. If the shopkeeper balks at your offer, go to another seller. More often than not, if the shopkeeper wants the sale, they will call after you. This can be a fun shopping experience, but you may get your best deal at a discount retailer at home.

* Beifang Market (Beǐfāng Shìchǎng 北方市场）

* Zhongdong Market (Zhōngdōng Dàshìchǎng 中东大市场）

*Eruasia Shopping mall (ouya maichang) Southwest Changchun. Ask a taxi driver to drive you, as this is quite popular and he will know what you are talking about.

Great for buying jade jewelery,pearl jewelery, or other types of necklaces , earrings, bracelets, or watches. has 3 levels of food courts, and a supermarket. hundreds of clothing brands, and an indoor ice rink.

Eat
Very good flatbread is available in Changchun. Look for it on the streets or in markets.

Definitely grab some lamb skewers and ZhaJiangMian while you're in Changchun. The peaches are deliciously tasty as well, bold in flavor. 

Do be careful, especially if you just arrived in China. Street food tends to be less sanitary than food in restaurants (although not dangerously so). Many people need a week or so to acclimate to the change in environment, including the different array of germs, and might suffer some stomach discomfort if they try to eat street food too soon upon arriving in China. If you do feel uncomfortable, check out a pharmacy for OTC medication.

Drink
Beer (啤酒）is probably the cheapest and safest thing to drink - and being Northeast China - comes in many varieties and is available almost anywhere. A big bottle (500 ml) should cost between ¥3-10. In the summer months good draft beer is available from most small restaurants, the black beer(黑啤) being particularly good.

Huadan (华丹), Jinshibai (金士百） and Yinpu (银浦) beers are all brewed in Jilin Province. There are also various Harbin beers (哈尔滨啤酒) available, as well as Bing Chuan (冰川) from the Korean prefecture of Jilin Province.

Like all cities in China, avoid drinking bottled water from street vendors and try instead at a supermarket or convenience store.

Bars
There are a number of western-style pubs in Changchun. There is a really big bar and club scene on Longli Lu (隆礼路) which are pretty hot during weekends. The beer there is cheap, about ¥6/cup. Occasionally there are some parties which are organized by "Changchun friends" or foreign teachers. Usually, they play the music themselves. The atmosphere is quite comfortable and people are very nice.

* This is the default meeting place for a lot of foreign teachers and other young and english - or russian - speaking people

* The interior, music collection, drinks menu and all other aspects of the pub were designed by British, Italian and American engineers. The music is all western and the drinks menu includes English ale and Irish stout. This is the only place in Changchun to have a beer and a game of pool in peace. A front terrace away from the main road to have a beer on a summers evening in pleasant surroundings.

* Serve Flensburger beer exclusively. Western fare available.
