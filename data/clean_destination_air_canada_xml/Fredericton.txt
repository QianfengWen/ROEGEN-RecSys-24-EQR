By Bike

Fredericton benefits from a large network of predominantly well - signed, well - maintained trails, which are well suited to bicycles and other active modes of transportation. Pathways link the city's downtown with most surrounding and suburban areas, including some less common attractions. Many of the paths are attractions unto themselves as well.

 Eat 

 Downtown Core 
* Pricey in the evenings, but a couple of decent vegetarian lunch items (one pizza, one pasta, one sandwich, one appetizer) They serve a mussels in garlic and parmesan sauce which is incredible, as well as a baked brie that, while small, is very tasty.
*Recently opened Cafe offering Capulin coffee espresso drinks, all day breakfast menu (eggs, wraps) lunch menu (paninis, soup & salad, rice dishes, burgers) Daily specials are unique and many use family Italian recipes. All items are made to order or homemade and prepared in our kitchen using fresh ingredients, locally sourced in NB if possible. Vegan, Vegetarian and Gluten-free options available. Outdoor seating and free Wi-Fi.
*Brightly-coloured dining room serving Caribbean food, with very friendly service. Over-priced but some items are good. Some vegetarian options. 
* Chain restaurant. Busy all the time despite the price. Expect to line up for unexciting and overly large portions of omelettes and crepes with lots of fruit garnish. Okay for vegetarians.
*Really good Greek food! The prices are very reasonable. Vegetarian moussaka, and of course the usual hummus, salads, etc. Veggie pita is disappointing feta cheese sandwich. Meat dishes are fine though, the soulavki was great and the Greek salad was nice. 
*Casual dining in a relaxed atmosphere. Huge summer patio, great service, creative food, and an extensive wine and draught selection. Come early to get a seat as its usually packed!
*Largest slices, pies and donairs in town. Open late. 
*Best pizza in Fredericton is not saying much. They are pretty good if you order a whole pie, but the slices can be disappointing (if not fresh). The caesar salad is great though. The restaurant portion is a nice, decently priced placed for Italian. 
*The vegetarian fajitas are not particularly authentic, but they are tasty and the veggies are plentiful. Not the worst choice if you are on the road and could really use a meal that incorporates a lot of vegetables. The meat dishes are better. It's the sort of place people go to over and over again for burritos and drinks. 
*Lunch only. Their soups are good and there is generally a vegetarian choice. Some of the sandwiches are veggie. Great baked goods! 
*Gets mixed reviews. Often thought to be overpriced and lacking in atmosphere. Avoid the lamb, the sauce is so excessive and overpowering that you may as well have dog meat on your plate for all the taste you get. Other dishes are passable. 

 South-side surrounding areas 
*This place could define the term greasy spoon restaurant. Typical diner, the food is sometimes great, sometimes not so good. 
*Typical diner fare, with pancakes to die for, at unbeatable prices! 
*Next to the Delta hotel. 24-hour family restaurant with breakfast and a Chinese buffet (buffet is very Canadianized and heavy on meat and deep fried items). 
 
 Other listings 
*Good quality and tasty. The fatoush salad is great! Authentic, very garlicky, large portion and possibly vegan. 

Drink
* Cute little cafe, the owners are the nicest people in all of Fredericton. Delicious paninis and a wide selection of sweets. Fair Trade options, and some of the coffee beans are now roasted on site. In warm weather the front patio is a great place to hang out. 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* Very noisy at peak hours but one of the more decent places to get a simple meal and very good beer without being gouged. The roasted vegetarian sandwich is tasty and there are some other veggie options, especially at lunch.
