Colombo (: කොළඹ, : கொழும்பு) is the largest city and the financial and commercial capital of .

Understand

Colombo remains both the commercial and financial capital of Sri Lanka even after the administrative capital has been moved to , a suburb east of the city.

Colombo is a huge, sprawling city, which can be visited any time of year due to its tropical climate. The traffic can feel somewhat overwhelming at first but it is organised and much more manageable when compared to other major cities of South and Southeast Asia. Colombo as a city has been discussed in historical records for over two millenia. The city boasts an incredible level of cultural diversity that can be experienced through its eclectic architecture and cuisine. Sri Lankans are very friendly, highly educated and worldly. In Colombo you will experience tradition blending with progressive values with English being spoken widely.

Get in
Electronic Visa (ETA) Electronic Travel Authorisation System can be obtained prior to arrival at a cost of USD35. SAARC country nationals pay USD33. For VOA at the airport most OECD nationals will have to pay for a USD35 visitor's visa prior to going through passport control at the airport. You can pay this using a credit card. Visa is valid for two entries within a 30 day period. If you are transiting, you may leave the airport for up to 24 hours (the transit time allowed is 48 hours) without a visa but the immigration officials would try to persuade you to get one, unless you have a hotel voucher supplied by Sri Lankan Airlines or ask for a bribe - typically half the cost of the visa. In case of the latter, say you will get a visa (paying with a credit card, of course!), leave the Immigration counter and head back towards the VOA desk and speak with the head of Immigration on duty in the office adjacent to the VOA desk.

By plane
There are currency exchanges in the arrivals hall with an ATM. Another ATM available outside the airport in the drop-off / pick-up area; leave the building and turn left.

There is air service to and from Colombo provided by the national airline, Sri Lankan Airlines. Flights are available from origins throughout Europe, United States, Southeast Asia, Australia, China, Japan, the Middle East, India, and Pakistan. Other airlines include Malaysia Airlines, Qatar Airways, Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Etihad and Emirates with transits typically in middle-eastern countries. British Airways have direct flights from Gatwick Airport to Colombo. 

Sri Lanka's prime international airport, Bandaranaike International, is at Katunayake, close to Negombo, on the coast north of Colombo. The journey to Colombo will take about an hour by taxi with heavy traffic and just half an hour otherwise. Note: There is a charge of 300 rupees to get into the arrivals hall (no matter what your skin colour) from outside. If you plan to meet a friend, bear this in mind. Foreigners can get away with claiming they're re-entering (but you will need to know a recent flight that has arrived and perhaps an excuse such as foreign exchange).

Trains operate from nearby Katunayaka South Railway to Fort, Colombo. A single one way trip costs LKR500 per person. Trains run only once a day and at different schedules on each day of the week. 
 Train timetable info is also available on a Government site. For foreigners, online booking is available

A secondary international airport "Rajapaksa International" is located in the southernmost city of Hambantota a 5 hour drive to Colombo.

Katunayake airport to Colombo
The international airport is located about an hours drive from Colombo. Depending on the time of your arrival and traffic conditions, the journey usually takes about one hour. Since 2015, there is a highway that connects the airport to Colombo and at night time, the journey takes upto 40 mins. 

By taxi
Airport Taxi
There are some taxi counters, some belonging to 4 / 5 star hotels, providing air conditioned taxis on a fixed price basis depending on the destination. It is highly recommended to agree on the fare beforehand to avoid being overcharged. As of March 2015, the fare was between LKR 2,500 & 3,000 to Colombo so do shop around for the best rate. 

Uber
Uber is now a great option coming from the airport. As of January 2019 an uber cost LKR 2000 to Colombo. 

Kangaroo Cabs is a very reputable taxi company in Colombo that has special deals starting at LKR 1750 from the airport to Colombo in new air-conditioned taxis.

There is also a mini van taxi service counter in the arrivals hall providing transport services. The rates are not cheaper than air conditioned taxis but a mini van will seat more than four passengers. The services are primarily for the locals so if you do not hold a Sri Lankan passport, they may refuse to offer you one.

By bus
This is the cheapest way to get into Colombo. The air-conditioned public bus (number 187-E3), is operated by Sri Lankan Transport Board (SLTB), to Colombo central bus station from the airport. As of April 2017, the bus picks up from the bus stand across the street from the terminal (i.e. come out of the terminal and keep walking straight; the bus stop is within the perimeter of the airport). The fare is 120 LKR, and it takes about 30 minutes as it takes the expressway to Colombo. The buses do have luggage storage space at the rear but be warned that someone pretending to be associated with the bus company may help you load your luggage. If this happens, they would expect you to tip them or the conductor will tell you that there is a LKR 100 charge for the luggage, even though there isn't one for it. It is a scam and do not fall for it! There are smaller overhead compartments in the bus, and in most cases, you can take an extra seat to keep your baggage as the buses leave to a schedule, regardless of the number of people in the bus. The last SLTB-operated bus from Colombo is 7.30 pm, and last bus from the airport leaves at about 8pm. Note that the schedules are not fixed, but expect a bus at twice an hour.

If you do not see an SLTB-operated bus, don't worry there will be a privately-operated bus all the time, even at the nights. These buses stop at the same spot SLTB buses start from (airport), or the road next to it. From the arrival hall, exit, and walk all the way to your left until the end of the building. This is about 50 meters. The SLTB bus, or the private bus alternative should be across the road, but if you do not see any bus there, continue to the road at the right side. You will be at the main road (this is a two-way road, and keep in mind that vehicles travel from the left side). Cross the road, and you will see a bus stopped at about 20-50m to your left. The route number is 187. If the bus takes the expressway, the number would be 187-E3.

From Colombo, after 7-8pm, your only bet is the privately-operated ones (187-E3 or 187), which start from the Private Bus Stand just opposite the SLTB Bus stand and next to the Colombo Fort Train Station. These cost LKR 200 (April 2018) and smaller buses, with a seating capacity of about 40, and leaves when full. Bus will take you to the departure area; ask the conductor if you have a problem finding it. 

Note that all buses except the SLTB buses usually serve locals who commute to work in the airport, nearby shops, or even at the smaller cities along the way. There can be several stops to drop and pick passengers. The travel time is roughly 1 hour. Buses that leave from the airport make another 10-15 minute stop at the main road near the departure hall. Buses can be packed, and as a courtesy, offer to hold onto the bags of others if you can. If your bag is huge, the conductor will charge you for two seats. In that case, it is better to take a seat near the door of the bus. The seats right behind the driver are usually reserved for the clergy. Do give your seat if you see anyone, but you are free to take that seat otherwise. 

There are many other buses destination "Airport" but it only refers to the bus terminal in Katunayake. For example, there is a larger 2-3 seat bus leaving at the opposite of the Fort railway station. Again, many locals use this bus, and travel time can be as much as 90-120 minutes.

Once you reach the bus depot, you can get a tuk-tuk (a three-wheeler) or a Nano taxi to get to your destination. The Nanos will have a meter and the tuk-tuks are required to have one now but most waiting within the bus station won't have it. Tuk-tuks without a meter and touts are best avoided. The ones with a meter will have a 'Metered Taxi' sign on the roof and you may have to walk out of the bus depot and on to the main road to find one. It would cost about LKR150 to go to hotels near Galle Face (e.g. Cinnamon Grand, Taj or Galle Face Hotel). There is no need to tip the driver but rounding up to the nearest 10 would make things easy. Before leaving the airport, ensure you have some LKR 100 notes as most taxi drivers won't have a lot of change.

By train
This is probably the most unknown way to get into Colombo, but completely possible. Take either the free Airport to the bus station and then follow the road (Canada Friendship) to the Katunayaka South station (around 1km, if you don't have luggage) or, if you've luggage, best just to take a Tuk Tuk right from the airport to the train station. Should be LKR100, if you're good at haggling you might get them down even a bit more.
Then, at the train station, get a ticket to Colombo Fort, you'll be arriving right next to where the buses drop people off. Price is LKR30. Trains are sometimes delayed, but driving relatively frequently, around 1 per hour, more during rush hour. It will take around 1 hour to get to Fort station, so definitely quicker than by travelling by bus, if you manage to just catch a train without much waiting. Check for Katunayake (not Katunayake Airport station) to Colombo train online timetable on one of the free computers in the terminal when arriving about the next train, if it suits you, it's an easy way into the city for very little money.

Note that trains run only 11 times/day to Colombo (March 2015) so ensure that there is a train for you before leaving the airport.

Tri-shaw (Three wheeler, tuk-tuk)
The cost of a tuk-tuk to Colombo will not be that much cheaper than an air conditioned taxi.

By bus
The Sri Lanka Transport Board is the nationalized bus service. Buses are the principal mode of transport in the country. Even if you cannot speak or understand Sinhalese, you should be able to cope up with basic English with locals and its entirely feasible than train travel since the frequency is more (every 5 minutes during daytime and half an hour during night). Prepare for over-crowding at peak times (mostly office hours) and make sure to confirm your destination with the driver and conductor of the bus.

Route No 187 connects the Katunayake Airport to the city of Colombo, and buses are available throughout the day.

By boat
Though there were some Indian cruise liners operated to Colombo since recent past, currently there are no boat services to Sri Lanka.

However a Navy ship turned into a cruise liner operates in and around Colombo seas from the harbour area.

Get around

Tuk-Tuk

Getting around by Tuk-Tuk (Three wheeler, Tri-shaw) is generally the most convenient option in Colombo. 
Tuk-Tuk Taxi

Nowadays more three-wheelers are fitted with meters and it is always better to catch one with meter. These will have a Metered Taxi sign on the roof. In March 2015, the meter starts at LKR50, 4-5km should be around LKR200 and 6km should be around LKR250. If you can't find a metered tuk-tuk, do not settle for first one you get, they will fleece you that way. Most tuk-tuks parked outside the hotels are unlikely to have a meter so avoid them and flag a passing tuk-tuk or take a bus. Also, be prepared to be hassled by tuk-tuk drivers every time you leave your hotel or are walking around the city - best just to politely ignore them.

The Sri Lankan Tourist Development Authority also operates its own fleet of 'tuk-tuks' around Colombo which are tourist friendly and metered to ensure that travellers are aware of the price being paid. Tourist board tuk tuks are distinguishable by their unique liveries. These three-wheelers can be booked 24 hours a day by calling +94 712 500 800 or +94 772 299 299.

Taxis
There are 'TATA Nano' cars in service nowadays and the charges start from LKR40/km with air-conditioning and it is also a safe and convenient way to travel. Taxis are much safer than a three-wheeler. 

Try Budget Taxi ☎ +94 11 729-9299. Quote of LKR2,800 (March 2015) from Galle Road to the airport.

Local Buses
There is a good, cheap public bus service but you need to know the route number of the bus that you would have to take to your destination. There does not appear to be a website providing any timetable information, but Wikipedia has several posts about bus routes.

Long Distance Buses
There are two bus depots in Pettah on either side of the road, near Fort train station. Sri Lankan Transport Board public (non air conditioned) buses operate from one and mini, air conditioned ones from the other. These buses go to all of the main cities but do not provide any luggage space.

Air conditioned buses with luggage space to Jaffna go from Wellawatta. These run over night and there are no advertised departure points. If you would like to catch one, go to Wellawatta and ask a few people on Galle Road a day or two before departure to establish where exactly these buses depart from.

The new highway express buses to the South all run from the Makumbura Multimodal Center (MMC) in the Kottawa suburb of Colombo. Timetables cab be found on the NTC website or on businfo.lk.

Trains
Train services are available to some of the main cities from Colombo but they are infrequent. Some 1st and 2nd class tickets may be booked up to 30 days in advance but these go quickly, especially for popular destinations such as Jaffna. Schedules and fares are listed at Sri Lanka railway website.

You have to bargain extensively and it is recommended that you take a local you trust along with you. Even if you don't buy anything, Pettah, or Colombo 11 is an experience in itself being a very typical, loud and crowded oriental market place full of Color and character. Each street in the market has its own specialty, for example, in 1st Cross Street you can find Sri Lanka’s biggest grain and rice merchants, 2nd Cross Street has electronics and so on. The Pettah market is extensive and one suggestion to begin the walk from Main Street at the Clock Tower and keep walking north towards Dam Street and New Moor Street. All the shops are major wholesalers and do not cater rock tourists per se. If you have a question, just walk in and ask politely. They all speak English.

Eat

Budget
Buy a "lunch packet" from street stands practically anywhere in the city. Typically, it will be a filling meal of rice and vegetables for about LKR120.

Also available everywhere are small bakeries selling rotis (either flat or folded into triangles filled with egg, vegetable or fish), hoppers (bowl shaped pancakes made with coconut milk), and other "short eats" (bread based snacks or fried foods). The price of individual items range from LKR10-50.

Around Fort Railway Station there are several local restaurants with the sign "Hotel", these actually are restaurants and not hotels, this usage of the word "Hotel" seems to be unique to Sri Lanka and India. These places have some hot dishes as well as various local baked items. The prices are very cheap, though if you are picky about hygiene you might want to avoid these.

Colombo has a McDonalds on Galle Road, which actually has some unique local offerings, as well as several KFCs, and a Pizza Hut in the Fort area near the Hilton that serves some combo meals for around 500-600 LKR. Though these are certainly not an authentic experience, they are one of the few air conditioned places you will find, and can be a life saver if you are about to die from heat stroke.

Hotel Pilawoos, 417 Galle Road, Colombo 4 
Probably the best place to eat in Colombo city. The food ranges from wonderful meat and vegetable curries to delectable Chicken Biryani to Cheese Kotthu. They also serve fresh juices.

Drink
* Thembili තැබිලි (Orange Coconut juice) is the safest, since they cut it open in front of you (uncontaminated).
* Spring water with SLS certification are safe to drink.

Mount Lavinia is a great place to be. The beach and the friendly people always draw visitors there and keep them for awhile. Unlike the South of the island, Mt.Lavinia is only abut 20 minutes away from the city and entertains a good deal of nightlife. Along the beach are a variety of restaurants that serve liquor (by restaurants along the beach I mean they are literally ON the beach, 50 feet away from the water and tables on the sand) have great food catered to suit every budget. The variety of the the beach spots themselves are interesting, from nice little coves for a quiet chat a and a drink to well lit, busy places with dance floors, music courtesy of a live DJ and well stocked bars. Try Jo Jo's, a quiet little place where they serve pretty decent food and drink and has a nice homey feel to it.The Owner Mr Jo, Jo, (Mr Nihal) better know, is a nice person. Buba, on the other side of the Mount Lavinia Hotel which divides the public beach is also a cool hang out.

Mount Lavinia also serves as the gay district of Colombo. Although not home to any gay bars, it is a very gay friendly town and always plays host to Colombo's Gay Pride week in June. Do not be surprised if some bars have the rainbow flag flying on the beach.

For those night owl's Colombo's nightlife is on par with most other Asian destinations and feature a number of nightlife establishments, that offer decent music and drinks, served in a pleasant atmosphere. The major hot spots as of July 2011 include Amusuem at the Galle Face Hotel, Kama (near the Ramada Hotel), Silk (near independence Square) and R&B on Duplication Road.

Expect the music to range from 80's retro to modern chart toppers as elegant partygoers dance the night away sipping the poison of their choice. Most clubs shout around 4AM, R&B perhaps a little longer after. Please do not drink and drive, hop a Three wheeler, its easier....

Popular watering holes include Whitehorse (Nawam Mawatha), Inn on the Green (Galle Face Hotel - looks expensive from the outside but very reasonable food and drink prices), Rize Bar (Dharmapala Mawatha), Seven Degrees North (Cinnamon Lakeside Hotel) and Cheers (Cinnamon Grand Hotel)

Most nightclubs may charge admission and smart/casual dress is encouraged with longs/shoes a must.

After a night out, some people will end with a late night snack, try e.g., Hotel de Pilawoos along the Galle Road in Kollupitiya to enjoy a Chicken Roti (chicken and cheese wrapped in a roti) followed by an iced Milo (sweet chocolate and malt flavoured drink)

Sleep
Budget
Colombo is not friendly to budget travelers, if you visit expecting to find a 15-20 USD room that's acceptable, you will be disappointed. There is accommodation at this price range, but the standards of hygiene and cleanliness will be unacceptable to anyone except the most hardcore travelers. The rooms are filthy and in a state of disrepair, lacking security and sometimes privacy. Expect to pay around 40 USD for a room that is up to international standards of budget accommodation, the same type of room you would get for 10-20 dollars in South East Asia.
It is highly recommended to book accommodation in advance instead of arriving to look for budget accommodation. (as of December, 2015)

Colombo's cheap lodgings in the center of town, apart from the famous YMCA (containing a gay bathhouse), are mostly concentrated along the road opposite the Colombo Fort Railway Station. Many rooms are available but with shared bathrooms starting around 900 LKR. Note: The quality of these hotels is extremely poor as described above.

*Clean rooms and nice beds. Getting the wifi-password will Free of Charge. The toilets are clean but the (cold) showers are very clean and lack privacy (the doors wont lock). 

*Clean rooms and nice beds. Getting the wifi-password will cost you an extra LKR200. The toilets are clean but the (cold) showers are a bit dirty and lack privacy (the doors wont lock). 

Moving south along Galle Rd., one can find a lot of more reasonable housing. Around Kollupitiya, you will still be dealing with air-conditioned concrete boxes where a sleazy clerk will tell you that they have a "budget single room for only 57 dollars". Further down south, prices and people will get more reasonable. There are quite a few small hotels in the side streets off Galle Rd. in Wellawatte area. If you continue south and get as far as Mt. Lavinia, there will be hundreds of small guesthouses, some of them very affordable, in a quiet old-fashioned area with a lot of greenery and right by the sea (the only problem being that it's far from the center). As of May 2014, you should be aiming at LKR1000-2000, depending on the room quality. Buses 100, 101 and perhaps some others go down Galle Rd. from Colombo Fort station (LKR20 to get to Wellawatte).

*This modern and ultra clean hostel has all the amenities: free wifi, hot water, AC, a lounge with tv/dvd player, and a free kitchen. The dorms are spacious with very nice shared bathrooms at the end of the hall.

* A small establishment run by friendly people. Rooms are functionally clean, but far from shining.

* Four out of the five rooms at The Regent have air conditioning units in them. They also have their own attached bathrooms which come with hot water. The fifth room is a dorm style room that has a common bathroom and no air conditioning in the room, only a fan. One minute walk to the world trade center and old Dutch hospital.

Stay safe

Colombo is like most other South Asian capitals. Although, it is not as dangerous as one would think, tourists should be very vigilant. Many first time travelers to Colombo find themselves falling victim to scams and touts, however, seasoned travelers to Sri Lanka are rarely scammed and it is very simple to avoid being a victim of scammers as long as you take precautions such as:

*Being on guard for anybody trying to help you by giving you unsolicited directions or travel advice. Take any advice from taxi and auto drivers with a grain of salt, especially if they tell you the place you want to go to is closed, dangerous, non-existent etc. If you are unsure, check a map.

*Not engaging in business with people who have to actively approach you for business such as Tuk Tuk drivers, street vendors etc. If people have to approach or make overtures to you for business without you seeking them on your own volition, then they shouldn't be considered for business dealings. Because, you will likely be overcharged, as you have been denied the option of shopping around for the best price.

*If you have been told your hotel is closed or full, give them a call. If you are a first time visitor to Sri Lanka, don't admit it as it will make you a target for the scam artists.

Once you are past the scammers, Colombo is a far more welcoming destination than other South Asian cities. Certainly single women, although not advised to explore every nook and cranny of the city on their own late at night, will not find the pestering attentions of leering men. Sri Lankan women are also very "western" in their dress sense, so it is very normal to wear skirts, tank tops, etc. You may get a few whistles and hellos from bored school boys, but they are more friendly and not meant to be threatening, so just ignore it and they will leave you alone.

Respect
*Seemingly innocuous public displays of affection between lovers such as kissing and/or hugging is not culturally acceptable in Sri Lanka as it is considered to be secluded behaviour (this does not apply to private functions or establishments designated for adults such as nightclubs, casinos and beach parties). Much lenience is given to foreigners and holding hands and public affection between parents and their children is not frowned upon.

*In most buses, it is local etiquette to provide or give up the very front passenger seats to members of the clergy, such as monks or priests if they are present.

*No photography of sensitive locations (inside and outside), and inside of shopping malls and tea factories (outside is OK). Be especially careful in Fort, Colombo (except on the beach). If soldiers are guarding something, it probably shouldn't be photographed. Don't rely on signs alone, as sometimes they are old or missing. For example, one end of a bridge may have a "No Photography" sign, but not the other.

*Do not turn your back to (or be alongside) a Buddha statue when within a reasonable distance (observe what others are doing). This includes posing for photos. It's OK to photograph a statue, but all persons should be facing it.

*Public nudity is illegal in Sri Lanka. Nude or topless sunbathing and skinny dipping should be avoided at beaches, except in the few private beach resorts which allow it.

Get out

*
*, located 100 miles northeast of Colombo, is a very important Buddhist site in Sri Lanka. The remains of the ancient fortress and city date back to 477 AD. Legend has it, King Kasyapa built it in order to protect against attacks from his brother, whom he had stolen the throne from. The only way into the city is through the giant lion's jaws. The site is also famous for its 5th century frescoes. Sigiriya is approximately 2-3 hours away from Colombo, and can be reached via train, bus, or car. It is open daily from 8:30AM to 6PM. For Foreign nationals, they charge up to USD30 / LKR3900 to gain entry.

* is considered a place of worship and pilgrimage by many religions. The 7,297 foot peak, also known as Sri Pada, is home to a foot imprint on a rock at its summit. Depending on the faith, the foot print has been considered that of Buddha, the god Shiva, St. Thomas, and even, Adam after he was expelled from the garden of Eden. The stairway to the top is believed to be one of the longest in the world. After reaching the top, climbers can ring the bell to mark the journey the just made. The panoramic view that one gets makes the journey well-worth the effort. Reaching (The town at the foot of Adam's Peak) from Colombo can be an adventure in itself, unless you are lucky enough to find a direct bus. The route is Colombo-Hatton-Maskeliya-. The distance is quite short on the map but can take 6-8 hours.

*, Located 75 miles (around 4 hours) outside of Colombo, is a small, tranquil town that holds the sacred tooth of Buddha, a sacred relic of the Buddhist faith. According to the legend, the tooth was taken from the Buddha on his funeral pyre and was smuggled into Sri Lanka hidden in the hair of a princess in the 4th century. The Dalada Maligawa, or Temple of the Tooth, is a main attraction for pilgrimages. Each July and August, the tooth is carried in a procession. Although one cannot see the tooth, the festivities are a sight to see.

* is easily accessible by direct busses that leave regularly (every 30 minutes) from the main bus terminal. The journey takes 6 hours and costs LKR236.
*, different culture, different people.
*
* Just over an hour's drive south from Colombo, Bolgoda Lake is one of the largest freshwater lakes in Sri Lanka. The mangrove like environs, birds, crocodiles & fishing make it a unique tropical experience well worth a visit. 
* App. 55 miles from Colombo, off the Colombo – Kandy road is Pinnawela, where an orphanage was started in 1975 to house the abandoned and the wounded elephants. The number of elephants has increased to more than 65 now; including Baby Elephants brought from various parts, as well as the 23 babies born, as a result of the captive breeding program. The best time to visit is the feeding time from 0930-1000 hrs and 1330-1400 hrs and the bathing time from 1000-1030 hrs and 1400-1430 hrs when all the elephants are taken to the river close by.
*Millenium Elephant Foundation, cheaper than the former but equally less touristic. See about it on the page.
