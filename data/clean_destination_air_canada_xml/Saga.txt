Get in

By plane

Saga Airport is small but has daily flights to (Haneda) and (Itami). It also has flights to (Pudong) every Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday on Spring Airlines, as well as flights to Seoul on T'Way and to Taipei on Tiger Air. From the city it takes about 30 minutes by bus and costs 600 yen.

Buses also connect Airport to Saga (70 minutes, &yen;1000). This option to travel via Fukuoka is much more practical unless you need to use Saga Airport (flying in directly from Shanghai is going to be cheaper, but also less comfortable, than via Fukuoka due to the low-cost nature of the operating carrier).

By train
Saga is a stop on the JR Nagasaki Line.

Trains run directly to Saga in about 40 minutes at a cost of &yen;1970 (adult, unreserved seat). It is best to get the return ticket, as it costs the same amount but you save yourself the trouble of having to purchase another ticket to get back to Fukuoka. Even if it is unused, it doesn't hurt to get it as it doesn't cost you any extra.

Local trains from Hakata cost only &yen;1130, but you will have to change trains in and the travel time will be about 75 minutes or more, depending on the timing of the connection.

From to Saga it takes 75-90 minutes on the limited express (&yen;3420 adult, unreserved seat), or about 2½ hours on the local service (&yen;2170). From it is about 65 minutes by limited express (&yen;2150 adult, unreserved seat)) or about 90 minutes by local (&yen;1310).

*Hasuike Park - A quiet and tranquil par that was the former site of Hasuke Castle. Near the end of March it also is a beautiful cherry blossom spot.
