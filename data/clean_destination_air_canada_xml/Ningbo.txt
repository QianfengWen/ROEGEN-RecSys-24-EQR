Ningbo (宁波 or 寧波; Níngbō) is a city in . The name is also used for the 9,365 km² (3,615 mi²) territory which it administers, including an extensive suburban area, three satellite cities, and two rural counties.

Understand

Ningbo is among the busiest ports in the world. Its hinterland, particularly nearby Putuoshan, are popular tourist destinations in Eastern China.

Ningbo's "old town" and urban core is centered on the confluence of the Yong and Yuyao Rivers. The area was anciently known as Yǒng (甬) from nearby Yong Hill; Yong is still used as Ningbo's abbreviation in modern Chinese. The Yong empties on Hangzhou Bay and the East China Sea and the Ningbonese have had a deep affinity for the ocean throughout their history. The voyages of Xu Fu, sent by the First Emperor in search of the islands of immortality and sometimes credited with initiating the sinicization of Japan, departed from here. Its temples later served as an important staging point in the introduction of Buddhism to Japan. During the Middle Ages, Ningbo was sometimes the sole approved port for foreign trade. During this period, Ningbo included ghettoes for Muslim and Jewish merchants. The Portuguese reached "Liampo" around 1522. They received permission for a settlement in 1542 but their piratical behavior provoked an officially-sanctioned massacre within three years. The British captured "Ningpo" during the First Opium War and&mdash;along with Canton (), Amoy (), Fuchow (), and &mdash;it was one of the five Treaty Ports opened to unrestricted foreign trade by the Treaty of Nanjing in 1842. (The spellings changed after the gradual adoption of the Mandarin-based pinyin system since the 1950s.) The Old Bund and the foreign buildings erected around it prior lie in Jiangbei District. Fenghua was the hometown of Chiang Kai-shek.

The long-stagnant economy began a period of regrowth with the establishment of development zones under Deng Xiaoping in the 1980s and 1990s. It is now thoroughly privatized, with state corporations making up less than 20% of the area's GDP. Ningbo includes the only free trade zone in Zhejiang and the Nordic Industrial Park, one of the only wholly foreign-owned industrial parks in China. Foreign and domestic investment have increased substantially since the completion of the Hangzhou Bay Bridge connecting it directly to southern . Today, primary exports include consumer electronics, textiles, food, and industrial tools. The local GDP per capita is about three times the national average and Tianyi Square is a major shopping area in the urban core.

Ningbo's tourist industry includes museums, the few historic sites downtown and its temples, nature reserves, and preserved ancient towns in the countryside. The Siming range lies within the municipality, as does the Hemudu archaeological site. Hemudu was the type site for the Yue civilization that flourished south of the Yangtze River prior to its sinicization by trade and invasion during the Zhou dynasty. Ninghai and Xiangshan Counties lie south of the main Chuanshan Peninsula.

 Climate 
Ningbo enjoys a subtropical monsoon climate featuring high relative humidity but distinctive seasons. July is the hottest month (average daily temperature 29°C/84°F) and January the coldest (4°C/39°F).

* (bus 759 or 790 from Ningbo East Bus Station) Legend says the Sheli Pagoda here wasn't built, but rose from the ground. This active monastery 20 km (12 mi) from Ningbo houses a bone fragment of Sakyamuni, Buddhism's founder, as well as artifacts, paintings and calligraphy - some personally written by Chinese emperors. Legend has it that the monk who found it was looking for one of the many Sheli pagodas that the Indian ruler Ayuwang (Ashoka) had established throughout the world. The monk was walking in the area and heard a bell ringing from underground. He sat down and prayed for three days and three nights, at which point the pagoda came surging up from beneath the ground. A temple was eventually completed on the site in 522 and named.

A total of 119 Chinese herbal medicines found here are included in the China Pharmacopoeia. For this reason it bears the name "natural botanical garden in east Zhejiang Province."

*Nanxi Hot Spring lies in in the outer district of Ninghai, Nanxi Village of Shentianchuan Township, 76 km (47 mi) to the downtown of Ninghai County. With a forest resource of 9,627 hectares or 9,627 mu, the scenic area was approved by the State Department of Forestry in 1991 as a national forest park, and thus it became one of the ten best scenic spots in Ningbo. As a well-known hot-spring resort in Zhejiang, the park is featured in its peaceful mountains, clear waters and dense forests.

*Xikou Xuedou Mount Scenic Spot located in the outer district of Fenghua, labeled as the abode for immortals on the sea, is 35 km (22 mi) away from the downtown area.

*Shanglin Lake Kiln Site is situated in the area near Shanglin Lake, Cixi City. It is a national key cultural protection unit. The celadon produced by the kiln is famous for its color and quality. Shanglin Lake is an important source and base for celadon in China. The ancient kiln from Han Dynasty to Song Dynasty number more than 100.

*Qiantong or Qiantongzhen is an ancient town south of the Yangtze River. About 10 km (6 mi) from Ninghai (and about 100 km from Ningbo), it is straightforward to get to because the G15 highway from Ningbo heads directly there with an off-ramp nearby. If you have a car, driving is the best way, it takes about 60 to 90 minutes get there. It is also possible to go on a bus from Ninghai, which can be reached from the long distance bus station in Ningbo. Among the 2000 household here 80% of them have “Tong” as the surname. Since it is located in front of the Baixi river, it is named Qiantong (“Qian” meaning “before” or "in front of"). The town has been around more than 760 years, successive generations of Tongs choosing to remain here. If you've been to other "ancient towns" in China, you will know that they run the gamut of being fully functioning towns as just as they were hundreds of years ago, to tourist dumps with nothing but trinket shops and unwashed hordes. This town receives about 300 to 500 tourists a day (according to the locals) and is large enough that you can spend about an hour wandering around. The level of preservation is still very good, although there were a few buildings being rebuilt in the "old style". This town strikes a decent balance between having some tourists, while maintaining its role as a functioning village. It seems like they've built up the infrastructure to really push more tourism though, despite relatively few making the trip out, so you might want to check the place out now before it becomes overrun. 

*Huge sweeping views of lush green countryside, water runs through the canyon as you follow a rough and ready trail.

*Located in Ningbo's outer district of Xiangshan it is about 140 km (87 mi)from Ningbo.The city wall that surrounds Xiangshan Film and TV City in Zhejiang province of China is 400 m long, 10 m high and 6 m wide, with two city gates.

*Shipu, or Shipuzhen, is an old fishing village on the southern edge of Xiangshan Bandao, the Elefant Mountain Peninsula, about more than 100 km south of Ningbo. The ancient town is situated north of Shipuzhen, in an area called Da'Ao. The ceremony of China Fishing Festival is held here and thousands of fishing boars setting out to the sea from the harbor constitutes a spectacular scene. The Shipu Harbor is now one of the four multitude fishing harbors in our country, a window to get contact with Taiwan and the second-class opening port of the country.

The whole pavilion and the milieu feature the style of private gardens south of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. During its rebuilding in 1933, the Zunjing Pavilion of Confucian Temple in Ningbo was moved to the backyard. Steles from the Song (960-1279) to Qing Dynasties in Ningbo City were also put there.

Drink
Beer in Ningbo is typically served lukewarm. Large cans and bottles are available at convenience stores and are usually refrigerated during the summer months but not winter. 

The principal bar district is called Lao Waitan. Ningbo bars tend to run "happy hour" specials all day until 8&nbsp;pm. Typical deals include buy-one-get-one-free or buy-two-get-one. Just ask before you order. Le Cargo is the town's dive bar, with brawls and visits from the police a common occurance.

The bars beside the Sheraton attract the new businessmen in town, rubbing shoulders, comparing notes from guide books, or offering each other shares in an idea! before running back to the safety of their hotels. You will also find some foreign students trying to cross over into business around here too.

Bars have also been springing up in the business districts around the port in Beilun, catering to the businessmen before they make the short trip back downtown. (There is usually a cheap hotel nearby as well, if you don't have a driver and fancy a few more drinks.)

If you're staying in a hotel, ask for a business card or two before leaving, so you can easily guide the taxi home no matter how bad your Chinese is!

 Bars 

*"LBB", 14 Da He Alley (大河巷14号）Tucked away down a little alley, you will find the oldest bar in Ningbo, a cool, sophisticated, yet unpretentious bar where you can relax and unwind from a hectic day. Often referred to as "The Bar". LBB is a great place to meet other foreigners and exchange stories and contacts. LBB is out of the way: they don't advertise, the bar is far removed from the Lao Waitan crowd, and they seem to like it like that. The bar has a great atmosphere, medium-range prices, and a relaxed and friendly vibe. The long-running pool competition on Thursdays attracts a mixed crowd of teachers, business men, and locals alike. Choose your own music, free Wifi, bar snacks, satellite TV, good range of cold beers. Open every day from 7:30pm and stays open till the last person goes home. LBB is the closest thing you'll find to your local bar from back home: the cute staff speak English and there's no funny business with the bill. Locals run tabs and buy bottles.

*"CMK Music House", Qian Hu Tian Di (钱湖北路399号) The wandering music house has finally (and thankfully) found a permanent home in Yinzhou. Atmosphere is good downstairs, but the upstairs plays host to live shows which are well managed. Recently there have been themed dance parties which are cheap or free and usually play fun, unpretentious music. Fun place, and a good place to get your music venue fix when they've got shows. Ask around or check their Facebook page for events.

*"dsky home" Qian Hu Tian Di (钱湖北路399号) This coffee shop/wine bar/furniture store hybrid (?) nails the atmosphere. Desserts are good, probably the only Key Lime Pie you'll find outside of or . One of the best wine lists in town. Everything in the store is for sale and the shop plays host to English board game nights on Tuesdays. Very chill and quiet.

*One of the infamous girlie talking bars where unsuspecting tourists or business men buy rounds of drinks for the girls with the expectation of a little more change at the end of the night than they actually get. Do not run a tab and pay for the drinks as you get them. Experience the most stinky bathroom in Ningbo.

*Cool decorations with hand-painted pictures on the walls and Chinese-style stool-based seating. Go for the shots, the location, and the pretty staff.

*Getting a drink is not easy as the bar staff do not speak one word of English, terrible Chinese band tries there best, often empty. right

*A great place when the weather is not too hot and not too cold, outdoor seating next to the river with super cheap drinks and student music makes this the choice place for students and those on an extreme budget.

*A great feeling about the place: pool table, decent food, live music, clean American style bar. Nice but always empty

*A whole evening wrapped into one with Thai being served upstairs and a full bar downstairs. You can enjoy a few drinks while waiting for a table or enjoy a few Thai snacks at the bar over a cold beer.

*Late night pick-up joint complete with bar brawls and police raids. Standard disco music to get the local girls and students strutting their stuff. Small and cram-packed at the weekends.

*One of the infamous girlie talking bars where unsuspecting tourists or business men buy rounds of drinks for the girls with the expectation of a little more change at the end of the night than they actually get. Don't run a tab: pay for the drinks as you get them. Experience the stinkiest bathroom in Ningbo.

*The young and beautiful with stacks of cash flock to this bar. Great shows here but expensive.

*One of the better bars in Lao Waitan, a small intimate bar that is well lit with a mini stage for live music.

*Nice bar for having a drink or two and a good chat with the girls. The girls speak good English. They dance salsa on request. They regularly do dance shows (salsa, jazz, freestyle) to entertain the guests. It's good fun. The girls are quite good at playing pool too.

*Latin music bar with live band that starts at 9:30&nbsp;pm. Recently redecorated and rewired to give a superb Latin sound and feel.

*A typical Irish bar, with Guinness and a friendly bunch of visitors. Standard pub fare at expat prices, but very well-done.

 Beilun bars 
*The best bar in Beilun, outdoor seating, large wine selection, and German beers on tap. Very Busy on Friday nights.

*Small but nice and right next door to Marco Polo.

*Located in the outer district of Beilun, Marco Polo offers a friendly bar where foreign guys and local girls talk the night away.

*Situated on the busiest bar street with well over 20 bars, Only Pub is run by a tight group of young fun-loving people. A simple bar with little choice but a sound start for a good night out.

*Another small Beilun bar with attractive staff selling Erdinger for ¥25.

*The first of many bars on Beilun's main bar street.

*A tiny little bar, the only foreigners' bar in Yuyao, run by a German guy and his Philippine helpers who will rustle up some food for you if you call ahead. An ideal place to stop on the way home if you've been busy buying plastics all day in Yuyao.
