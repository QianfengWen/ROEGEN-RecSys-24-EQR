Zhengzhou (郑州; Zhèngzhōu) is a city on the south bank of (Huang He) in China. It is the capital of . Sometimes it is called the Green City, for the number of trees it has, or rather had.

Understand
The name Zhengzhou comes from a city in the Sui Dynasty, but its actual location was in modern day . During the Tang Dynasty, the name switched here. The area remained unimportant until it was selected for development by the Chinese Government after 1949. Strategically located in the center of the country, Zhengzhou is now a major transportation hub and rapidly growing city. To travelers, Zhengzhou is a convenient start point to explore a series of Chinese cultural sites, like Kaifeng, Luoyang and Shaolin temple.

Get in

By plane
The airport that serves Zhengzhou and its immediate area is Zhengzhou Xinzheng International Airport. It is the main international gateway to Henan Province. 
The airport is about 30 km outside of town.
All flights now land and depart from Terminal 2 of the airport. Terminal 1 has been closed since 2017. 

There is a Ground Transport Centre (GTC) located next to the terminal, which has metro, high speed rail to Zhengzhou East HSR station, long distance bus terminal and a carpark. GTC is a 5 minutes walk from the arrival gate. 

An airport shuttle bus leaves from Zhengzhou Hotel opposite the train station, centrally located and costs 22 rmb. Be careful of a scam that is currently operating at the bus ticket office. You will be told the bus is full or not leaving and then offered a taxi instead for 150 rmb. Make sure you go into the office and don't listen to the scammers on the street outside (June 2014).

A public bus runs from the airport to the Aviation Hotel (民航酒店 mín háng jiǔ diàn) on Jin Shui Road （金水路 jīn shuǐ lù). It costs 20 rmb.

Taxis to the airport will cost around 120-140 Yuan. While the distance implies it should only be 60 yuan, you're charged for the round trip driving. Unfortunately, bartering seldom helps as locals pay this price as well.

By train
Zhengzhou is China's biggest train hub; you can get here from nearly every major metropolitian area in . There are several arrivals each day from (about 8 hours, or 3.5 hours by high-speed rail), (about 17 hours, or 6 hours by high-speed rail), (about 6 hours, or 2 hours by high-speed rail) and (many train types ranging from 7 to 15 hours). Trains arrive from other places less often. The Hanoi to Beijing train also stops here.

By bus
Across from the train station, you will find a long-distance bus station. Buses arrive regularly from almost anywhere in Henan province. Buses may be less comfortable than the trains, but are cheaper and you do not have to push and shove your way in and out of the train. You are guaranteed a seat but sometimes buses wait to fill up, rather than leaving at a set time, and be aware that long-distance buses may be sleepers rather than seated if the trip is very long.

Get around

The city's focal point is Erqi (February 7) Square (二七广场). This large public square comes alive at night, when an entire market fills the space with vendors and locals hanging out. Beneath the square are several levels of shopping extending about a kilometre. Here you can buy a huge variety of items, from budget clothing to arts and crafts to many different kinds of Chinese and foreign cuisines. From the square, several main streets fan out to different areas of the city.

Since Zhengzhou was handpicked to serve as a transportation hub - and does not have a very long history as a large city - the urban planning is more noticeable here than in other places of China. This means there is plenty of green space, tree-lined streets and logical arrangement to the city.

Zhengzhou is relatively spread out, but most sites are accessible by public bus, which costs generally ¥1 per ride. 

A recent addition to the public transport network is a modern, clean subway line, travelling across the city from east to west in both directions. More lines are currently under construction. 

Taxi fares begin at ¥8 in the day, and ¥10 late at night (after 10 pm), with each kilometer after the second costing ¥1.5. All taxis are metered but sometimes the drivers will try to cheat foreigners.

Landmarks
* Museum inside a rather garish double pagoda that looms over February 7 Square. Inside there are exhibits explaining the city's development.

* You can see remants of the wall in the east side of town. This city wall, which is now a tall-dirt wall, dates back to the second millenium BCE. From that point of view, this part of the wall is definitely worth a while to scrutinize. A hundred meters east of the front gate of the ruins is more remnants of the Shang-era-city wall. Enter through the gate to the Shangcheng Bonsai Garden (商城盆景园/shāngchéngpénjǐngyuán); the gate is open 24-7. The path will split in two: left is up some steps to the top the city wall, where you can walk for a bit, and straight ahead is the path to the quaint bonsai gardens. If the care taker is around you can take a walk through the gardens.

* Famous for its connection to Shaolin Kung Fu.

* Northern Song Dynasty imperial mausoleum is located in Gongyi City, West Village, Zhida, downtown, Huiguo town area, the Nine Emperor, except the emblem, chin two emperor Jin Binglu to die of five outside the city, the remaining seven emperor and Zhao Hongyin ( Zhao Kuangyin's father ) were buried in Gongyi, known as the" seven emperor of eight hills", plus the empresses and the prince, Wang Sun and wilder, Cai Qi, Kou Zhun, Bao Zheng, Zhao Pu, Yangliulang hero 's total nearly 1000 mausoleum. 

Museums
* This monolithic pyramid-shaped museum is worth a visit. Learn about ancient civilizations in the area (most of which were not based in Zhengzhou, but nearby cities such as and ), and even see a dinosaur bone or two in the area. If you are into modern art, this is not the place for you. It generally has acceptable squat toilets on the first floor. There is an English audio tour you can rent, and there are cheap lockers to store your stuff. Come to see old pottery from the Song dynasty, old bells, bronzes, things like that, but anything more recent does not have English captions. Note: As of 2016, the museum is under renovation. Enter through the west gate, as the front gate is closed. The main building is closed, but an annex with the highlights of the museum's collection is open. 

* Fascinating insight into Chinese children's education. Play on crumbling science exhibits, gawk at the garish space tributes and meet local families.

* built in 1955, is based in the Yellow River as the theme of the natural science museum. To build a house for more than forty years, by domestic and foreign audience praise. You can take 101,9,26,27,66,86,87,208 bus to there directly, and the ticket is free.

* New museum facility opened in May, 2021. Alongside with Zhengzhou Art Center and Zhengzhou Grant Theatre, it is a must-visit and a new candidate for Zhengzhou's landmark. It is reachable via metro Line 14 getting off at Olympic Centre station (奥体中心, pinyin: Ao Ti Zhong Xin); or Bus S113, get off at Danshui Dadao/Zhihui Lu stop (丹水大道汇智路站).

If you don't have a smartphone, or need to use passport, HK/Taiwan travel document, you can still get a paper-based museum ticket at the customer service center of its south gate (南大门综合服务处) using your photo ID (although this walk-in ticket is not guaranteed due to daily maximum visitor of 8,000 at this pandemic time).

Parks and nature
*Zhengzhou National Forest Park (郑州国家森林公园), placing the old forest park, it surrounds the western part of Long Lake in the north of Zhengdong New District. The Forest Park is the lung of the city and the largest urban park in Zhengzhou. Endless walking and jogging trail make it the best place to have a morning jog or sunset photography. You can get to the Forest Park from different roads and entrances. If by metro line, take metro Line 4, get off at Sen Lin Gong Yuan Bei station (meaning North of Forest Park station, 森林公园北).

* Scenic area consisting of five scenic spots, Five Dragons Peak, Camel Mountain Range, Yueshan Temple, Stone Figures, and the Ancient City of Liubang and Xiangyu. Entrance fee is 60 RMB or 96 RMB including cable car. 

* More depressing than it is impressive in any way. Some of their imported animals include kangaroos and emus from Australia, as well as turkeys and coyotes which might be interesting for a local but hardly for a foreigner. The park is nicely landscaped, and directions to the various displays are clearly displayed in both Chinese and English. There is also a sizeable amusement park with many different rides, including a modest roller coaster. There is also a cable car ride across the zoo, at a cost of 20 yuan return, providing a more birds-eye view of some of the animal enclosures. If you generally enjoy zoos, however, you may very well walk away sad at how the animals are cared for, or not in this case. Nevertheless, some construction work currently underway holds promise of perhaps better habitats for some of the animals.

* Has a theme park inside with a quaint Ferris Wheel that is worth riding.

* Another park worth going to. It is quite a huge amusement park. Be aware most rides have a 90kg limit for anyone using them, sometimes staff can be strict and refuse to let you ride even after you have paid to get in.

*Emperor Palace Aka Yunyan temple, located37 kilometers southwest of Zhengzhou City, the eastern city of Xinmi on the northern shore of Lake Wuding, was Xuanyuan Huang Di, a palace Zhudian training military, a study of eight maps place, known as the" human ancestor of the Chinese Shrine"," the best in all the land sector".

*Bisha Hillock Park , or knowns as Bishagang "碧沙岗", firstly built in 1928 for memorial of those sacrificed in Northern Expedition war of China. Located at 31 Jianshe East Road (建设东路31号), you can get here by metro Line 1, get off at Bishagang Station, try Exit B. It's a nice place to see how local residents live and relax daily at the heart of old town Zhengzhou. 

*The Forest of Zhengzhou (郑州之林), attached to the west of CBD of Zhengdong New District, it is definitely one of the best places to jog in the city.

*Longzi Lake Park (龙子湖公园), at the heart of Longzi Lake college hub, it serves tens of thousands college students as the best place to hang out and do exercise. There are more than a dozen collages and universities at the fringe of the park. Longzi Lake is a ring-shape water body, well built trails form two loops that are about 7km and 5km in length for the outer lake and inner lake green space, respectively.

Do
You can spend an enjoyable day in Zhengzhou exploring one of its parks, visiting a museum, or going shopping. A possible evening might involve eating at a Sichuan or Henanese restaurant, buying a bottle of Dynasty wine, socializing with the local clientele, and then rounding off the evening at a KTV bar.

*One thing worth knowing about is that the museum area is also the area of the two branches of government - federal and communist - so the area is much nicer. We are talking trees and some flowers along with a more neighborhood feel that might remind you of Shanghai. Do not expect wild nightclubs, but it is a more pleasant place to be if you are looking for a walk. Erqilou is fine, but a bit dirty, so see this other side of Zhengzhou if you get a chance. Also, some nice places to eat are in this area.

* In the north western part of the city, south of the Donggengqu River, there are still streets completely shaded by impressive trees. The entire city was this way until the 90s, when road widening projects removed many of the trees. On a warm day, a shaded stroll can be quite comfortable, especially if your hotel has no air conditioning. Hongqi Road is a nice play to walk and stop for lunch and a beer. Go with the local Red-Star Beer. It's pretty good. The locals are very friendly, but don't let them sell you a Budweiser.

* If you have the opportunity, try to find some . It is the famous local music Henan Provence is famous for. Even if you do not speak the language, the melodies are pleasant.

Buy
Large department stores and international brands tend to be concentrated around Erqi (February 7) Square. Two of the major department stores are Kingbird (金博大) and Beijing Hualien (北京华联), which are next to each other. Both stores have supermarkets in their basements. A short walk away are two new, modern shopping plazas, Mixc and David Plaza. There is an ice-skating rink on the 5th floor of David Plaza, with a western-style hamburger store alongside it. The burgers here are to die for!

Some of the most interesting gifts can be purchased at the city's antique market. Most of the shop owners will have a calculator handy so you can bargain by typing in prices. Consider that you got a good deal if you pay half of what they originally quoted. The people are friendly but many of the shops sell fake antiques made to look old. Nevertheless there are interesting items that will decorate your walls or look great on a stand back at home. You can even impress your friends by telling them you bought them an antique from China. 

Some of the small shops sell real antiquities. You'll know when you're buying one because the prices will rise dramatically from about ¥100 or less for fake goods to well over ¥5,000 for the real deal. 

If you are a collector, China will not let foreigners take antiques out of the country that are over 200 years old or possibly even more recent items depending on their cultural value. 

Western goods are available at Walmart near the centre of the city. There is also a Carrefour supermarket, also near the city centre. If things cannot be found in either of these supermarkets, if you can get access (you may need a business account), there is a large METRO Cash & Carry in the Zhengdong International Logistics Park (a map may be found here ). This has many western goods. There are also supermarkets in the New Shanghai Mall and Mixc Plaza in the city centre (Erqi) which have many western goods such as cereal, baked beans, butter and cheese - however, these are very expensive. 

There is nowhere you can buy fresh milk in Zhengzhou, but most supermarkets stock various brands of UHT long-life milk. Some imported brands can be purchased from Carrefour and Walmart supermarkets. 

There is a technology market on the south west corner of Dongfeng and Wenhua Roads. Most of the items being sold are a little older, but the visit is a great deal of fun, like out of a Gibson novel.
As of 2015, the technology market became more of a market with hundreds of small shops selling computers, mobile phones, tablets and other electronics. Only one or two people on all of the floors actually repair anything.

Make sure you know where your wallet is at all times. There are some unsavory characters in the markets. This is, in fact, true of Zhengzhou in general, which has a reputation for pickpockets. Buses are especially risky. Keep your wallet in your front pocket.

Eat
Zhengzhou has a diverse array of fine Chinese cuisine. Its location at China's center means you can find almost any type of Chinese food here. The city is big enough to have a scattering of cosmopolitan restaurants, and while there are a number of Korean, Japanese, Indian, and Western options about, you will do best to stick with Chinese food.

Budget
There is the usual assortment of dumpling shops and noodle joints on every street and back alley.

There is a good number of Sichuan restaurants, which makes sense considering the proximity to the Province of Spice.

You should not miss a special breakfast in Zhengzhou (hulatang), it is a special soup, a little spicy. You better go to Shunhelu where you will find the best hulatang in town.

Noodles, especially the mutton noodle (羊肉烩面; yangrouhuimian) and beef noodle (牛肉拉面; niuroulamian) are must-eat in Zhengzhou. There are three good yangrouhuimian restaurants with many locations, ask a taxi driver to take you the nearest one, and you will tast the best delicilous huimian in zhengzhou:

Make sure to ask for the dishes to come one at a time for the best dining experience.

* A very good Italian style restaurant in North-eastern Zhengzhou. Considering the owner and staff have never been outside of Zhengzhou or China, it is pretty decent food, and not badly priced. Lasagna noodles are made in house and they have recently hired an American Chef to try to help them become "more authentic". He recently updated the Caesar Salad dressing, and it is well worth a try!

Expect IPA,porter and beers using Tibetan grains. Prices for beers brewed in the brewery are from RMB 38 to RMB 58. Happy hour (two for the price of one) is from 6 pm to 8 pm, Monday through Sunday (only those on tap).

Other areas:
* For an unusual drinking experience, consider this pub, located in a bunker-like concrete building. This place features a cabaret-style show with a mix of song, dance, and jokes. Unless you understand Chinese, it will be mostly incomprehensible, yet the experience will give you insight into Chinese drinking culture. The place is noisy, smoky, crowded, and occasionally bizarre. You can order half-a-dozen or so bottles of beer by the bucket. Try to get there early, around 7PM, as the show ends around 10 or 11PM. This building also houses one of Zhengzhou's movie theaters.
*Next to Target Pub, there is a fairly new bar called Beer Factory. It has a large selection of different beers from around the world. It also has a very friendly staff, who can speak English particularly well. The bartenders here are able to mix many different drinks for you, including a really good whiskey sour. Definitely worth a visit!!

Sleep

Budget
Zhengzhou is not a major backpacker stop, so there are few cheap lodgings in the city. That said, there are some hotels that offer real value for money if you are more than two people. As with most Chinese cities, there are several a bit run down hotels to be found near the train station. These might be your cheapest options. Most likely English is not spoken but you can get a room for &yen;50 or even cheaper if there are two people splitting a bill for a double room. Bargain, especially if you are staying more than one night.

* This hotel might be a little loud at night.

* Caters toward business travelers.

* Chain of business hotels scattered about the city. Their rooms are clean and have a style that invokes a SoHo loft more than a Chinese hotel.

* This is your best bet on a budget hotel. It is a relatively new chain with several locations around town. This listing is the most centrally located. Another good location is on Zhengyi Steet (政一街) near Jinshui Road (金水路). The rooms are super-clean with tile and laminate floors and a fresh coat of paint. Complimentary high-speed Internet hookups are installed in all the rooms.

* Double rooms have one large and one standard bed. There is another branch on 46 Zhonghanghailu.

* Massive Chinese-style business hotel with well-worn carpets and paper-thin walls, but otherwise functional.

*Another great city nearby by is , home to the . The city itself is worth a look, with an interesting old section and easy walking downtown. It's about three hours by bus, which leave Zhengzhou every hour or so. An express - the "elephant bus" or kuai che - costs ¥40.

* is a small and relatively undeveloped city, off the main rail network, but well worth a visit to see the Jun Royal Kiln Museum and to get an insight into life in Henan off the tourist trail. One and a half hours by bus, and very walkable once you get there.
