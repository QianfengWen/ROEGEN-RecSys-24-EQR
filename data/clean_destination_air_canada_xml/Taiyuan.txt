If you want to switch to a station, click to the top left of the 3D panel to switch it. The third button has a clock, and it shows the train timetables of the first and the last train.

Stay Safe

Thieves in Yingze Avenue are savage. They always move in group and do pickpocket (snatch sometimes) brazenly at the daytime. It's necessary to walk away or take a taxi immediately as you face with these groups.
