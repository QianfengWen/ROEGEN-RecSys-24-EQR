It houses collections of various color-painted potteries of Neolithic Age and treasures of ancient grottoes. In addition, the museum is home to precious linen and silk fabrics, books, wooden and bronze vessels, a great many bamboo slips for writing from the Han Dynasty (206 BC-220), frescos and so many other items. A 4-meter-tall Mammoth fossil replica is stored in the museum whose remains were excavated from the Yellow River basin in 1973. Aside from the prehistoric presentations, there are also rare animal exhibits, such as pandas, golden monkeys and red -crowned cranes.

The world-famous bronze Galloping Horse's Hoof Stepped on a Flying Swallow, also named as Galloping Horse, is a treasure of Gansu Provincial Museum. Excavated in 1969 in Wuwei County, Gansu Province, the piece depicts a vigorous horse with long tail waving and head perking. Its three hooves are in the air, galloping like lightening. What makes this sculpture amazing is the right back hoof of this galloping horse lands on the back of a small flying bird. The bird turns in surprise to look at the big creature on its back. At the same moment, the horse's head also turns slightly in attempt to know what has happened. The whole statue is honored as the mysterious and rare treasure in the history of Chinese ancient sculpture art. You need to show passport or Chinese id card at the street gate to get a free ticket to enter at the front door.

* Cave grottoes with Buddhist sculptures on the banks of the Yellow River. This place is not easily accessible, but definitely worth the effort. One-day trips are offered by travel agencies, e.g. Western Travel Service (西部旅行社） at Lanzhou Hotel starting from 150 RMB, and first go by bus to Liujiaxia （刘家峡）reservoir and then by boat to the grottoes. Starting in the fifth century AD more than 200 caves have been cut into the rock with colourful mural paintings and beautiful sculptures ranging from tiny statues to a giant Buddha.

It is all pretty easy and private transportation is definitely not necessary for a day trip there
1. Get to Lanzhou west bus station and buy a ticket from the counter to LiuJiaXia/Bingling Si (1,5 - 2 hours,25 yuan). These buses run every 20 minutes fro 7 AM. 
2. Just say Bingling Si to the bus driver and they will drop you of about 200 meters from the tourist center, at the level of the dam.
3. Ignore everyone wanting to sell you a boattour, it's far more expensive then the official ones at the immense tourist center which you will definitely find when walking up towards the dam. It's a big complex on your left hand (when leaving the bus)
4. Buy a speed boat ticket (around 125 yuan - 120=5 for insurance) They will bring you to the Bingling Si caves 55 kilometers further in about 1 hour.
You will need to be at least 7 before the boat to leave but we did not wait for more than 15 min.
5. They give you 1,5 - 2 hours to explore the caves and bring you back in another hour.
6. At Bingling Si you have to buy the entrance tickets for the park (50 yuan or so). But students get a 50% discount!
7. Taking the bus back: just go to the point where they dropped you of and wave when a bus is coming.

Note: there are also slow/big boats running, which are less expensive. But they will take around 3 hours for the 55 km trip, so this way you won't get the last bus back to Lanzhou.
You don't necessarily need to take the earliest bus, we did though and while we were leaving the site, huger groups were coming in. This also allowed us to take a bus back from Bingling Si at 3 PM (last bus back runs at 6.30PM we think).
