Understand
Nicknamed the Phoenix City, Yinchuan is a rising northwest Chinese industrial city and the capital of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. Being one of a very few parts of China where an ethnic minority (Hui people) hold the power of governance, it is a treasure of Chinese-Muslim culture.

Rapid growth over recent years has been quickly drawing these two distinct centers together as foreign investment grows.

Yinchuan historically served as a trade route town made large for its convenient location between Western Chinese cities such as and the Eastern ones such as and .

See
* A nice, medium sized garden area with classic Chinese buildings/architecture. The tower dominates the garden and the view from the top is one of the best you will get of Yinchuan. Currently closed until the H1N1 scare is past.

* 

* 

* - Western Xia Tombs, These are 193 tombs of high officials of the Xia Kingdom. Buses leave in the morning from Xue Yuan Square, 9 AM and 10 AM. Same buses stop by the Train Station at about half past. About 10 RMB each way. 

* This part of the wall is in various states of decay, but maintains some impressive examples ancient masonry. The site is undeveloped and you are free to wander about/climb on it as you like. Sections of the Ningxia Great Wall originate primarily from the Ming Dynasty. It is about 1km in length, and continues up the mountains and further out in both directions. Well worth the trip, but be forwarned, brightly coloured clothes will attract butterflies! There is nothing else around (no people/shops/etc)--its at the edge of the desert. Bring water.
** From in front of the Alashun Hotel or at the bus depot hidden away down the street from the train station in the New Town (what once was the bus station entrance hall is a furniature store, the main station entrance looks like a small shop but is in the same building next door). Public buses going there do not have numbers but are white with blue lettering and travel between Yinchuan and Zuoqi, get off at Sanguankou (the wall is clearly visible from the highway, infact the highway goes through the wall). Just wait on the road and flag down any bus you see headed towards town to return. The last returning bus passes the wall daily at 5:50PM (be on the road a few minutes early), locals may stop and offer you a ride back to town if you are waiting on the main road.

*It takes about one hour to go there by bus. Buses leave from the bus station regularly and a one-way ticket cost ¥19 in July 2011. At Shahu it's easy to find a bus back to Yinchuan.

Do
* 
*The best thing in Yinchuan is the people and the Hui neighbourhoods, so the best option is just to take a bus in any direction and getting down in a street market or in a park. It is also recommended to go to the main square in the night where there are dances and games.

Buy
Eight Treasures Tea is a muslim specialty and in good supply around Yinchuan. Wolfberries found in Yinchuan are said to be the best in the world.

* The economic centre and shopping centre of Yinchuan with many large malls and department stores and all the large clothing chains (Nike, Disney, Jack Jones, etc). Do not expect to bargain here.

Eat
* A wonderful ESL school/Christian bookstore/library/teahouse/restaurant run by one of China's top entrepreneurs. It provides a retreat from the chaos of the city and serves a variety of foreign foods. Recommended platters are the chicken curry and the beef with rice soup (which is Chinese food directed at Western tongues).

* The only real American style pizza in Yinchuan. Owned by Robin, a Korean-Chinese man, you can find authentic home pizza. The Meat Lovers, Vegetarian and Pepperoni pizzas are all full marks. The staff speak very good English here. It is also the only restaurant in town to find Dr. Pepper. They have two locations. One is in the Old City at #278 Beijing Dong Lu. It's a very small place, easily missed. The other is in the Xi Xia District (西夏区) on Shuo Fang Lu (朔方路) at the north side of Wu Tong Hua Yuan (梧桐花园), between Ningxia University and the Northern Minorities University. They deliver in New Town and Old Town Areas. Both locations now offer espresso-based specialty coffee drinks.

* A curious blend of western dishes and chinese ingredients. Though it is well marketed the food in Napoli generally does not appeal to foreigners. If you are looking for something to remind you of home, you are better off finding an alternative.

* For when you need a Western food break.

Drink
* A well decorated bar, and the best in New Town. The staff is very relaxed and friendly, and there are unobtrusive musical performances every night starting 8PM-9PM.

* Boasting comfortable seating and a younger crowd, you can sit back with any of the local beers and relax.

* Popular club featuring dancers and a very impressive layout.

* Popular club featuring dancers and a very impressive layout.

* Although traditional western coffee is hard to come by, this drink chain (which can be found almost everywhere in Yinchuan) sells their version of a coffee drink that can be served hot or cold. While it is still not western style coffee, it is quite good, somewhat similar to Starbucks' caramel macchiato.

*Bob and Leo (chubby and happy twins) have some of the best BBQ chicken in Yinchuan, if not China. They both speak English and are extremely friendly. It is an outdoor grill with great selections of mutton and fish as well as a selection of vegetables. Cheap beers and the occasional expat make it a must visit. Open late or until you stop buying beers...
*Laid-back rock n’ roll student bar. Imported beers and spirits. Live bands and alternative music. Hao Ting Ting is the bartender and she is very friendly, open minded and speaks English. Just as likely to see teenaged art rockers and students as grisly punks and misguided foreigners.
