Understand

History
Winnipeg lies at the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers, a location currently known as "The Forks". This point was at the crossroads of canoe routes travelled by Aboriginal peoples prior to European contact. The name Winnipeg is a transcription of the western Cree word wi-nipe-k meaning "muddy waters"; the general area was populated for thousands of years by First Nations.

Winnipeg started out as a fur trading post located at the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine rivers, and was a crossroads for many early settlers. Many trails converged on the city and later became streets (which is evident when you see the city's somewhat haphazard road layout). 

In 1869–70, Winnipeg was the site of the Red River Rebellion, a conflict between the local provisional government of Métis, led by Louis Riel, and newcomers from eastern Canada. This rebellion led to Manitoba's entry into the Canadian Confederation as Canada's fifth province in 1870. On November 8, 1873, Winnipeg was incorporated as a city.

After the construction of the CP railway across Canada, Winnipeg became a major transportation hub and "Gateway to the West." The city experienced a boom during the early 20th century, and for while was western Canada's major economic centre. Fortunately for the visitor, the economy slowed around the middle of the century, leaving intact a remarkable collection of period architecture, primarily in the city's downtown Exchange district.

The Red and Assiniboine rivers form Winnipeg's most prominent geographical features, and have played an important role in this city's development. "The Forks," where the Assiniboine flows into the Red, has been a meeting place since Aboriginal peoples first came there to trade. Today, it's the city's top tourist destination, with shops and restaurants representing the city's many ethnic groups, and a well-maintained expanse of riverside park.

Winnipeg is off the tourist trail for most visitors to Canada, and the visitor will experience an authentic and friendly Canadian Prairie City which leaves many pleasantly surprised.

Multiculturalism
Winnipeg is a multicultural city. As of the 2016 census, visible minorities make up 28% of Winnipeg's population, and aboriginals 12.2%. Much of Winnipeg's population is of European descent, notably from England, Scotland, Germany, Ukraine, France, Ireland and Poland. In recent years, Winnipeg has become home to the largest Filipino community in Canada outside of Toronto. More than a hundred languages are spoken in Winnipeg. The city celebrates its diversity with the Folklorama festival, the longest running multicultural event of its kind. Winnipeg is home to one of Canada's largest French speaking populations outside of Québec, and the largest in western Canada.

 Climate

Winnipeg has a humid continental climate with extremes of hot and cold. The longest day of the year lasts for over 16 hours, and the shortest day of the year lasts for 8 hours. 

Winnipeg is ranked as Canada's second sunniest city year-round and second for clearest skies year-round. Summers are typically warm and often humid, particularly in July, with frequent night time thunderstorms. On average, Winnipeg has 45 days a year where the humidex (combined effect of heat and humidity) reaches above 30°C.

Spring and fall tend to be rather contracted seasons, each averaging a little over six weeks. In general the weather during these seasons is highly variable, and rapidly changing. It is typical for the day to start off quite cold in the morning, but heat up considerably in the afternoon. It can be difficult to judge how to dress during this time, so layers are the best option.

Winters in Winnipeg are usually dry, and can feel colder due to the often windy conditions. The winters are long and overnight minima average below -15°C with rare extremes going down to near -40°C, though there is still much to enjoy during these months. Snow cover can be expected from mid-November to late March. The city turns on what is arguably Canada's best display of Christmas lights from late November until well into January.

Winnipeg is also known for its high mosquito population, particularly during early summer. Dusk and dawn are the most active time for mosquitoes. Late August and September tend to provide the most pleasant environment for summer visitors. More detailed climate information is available from Environment Canada

Particlarly when flying to and from other points in the United States, this can result in very substantial savings. The international boundary at Pembina, North Dakota & Emerson, Manitoba is open 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Then call the shuttle service to get to or from Winnipeg. 

Public Airport Transportation

Public transport is offered by Winnipeg Transit's Route 15 & Route 20 buses which run every 10 to 25 minutes between about 6:00AM to 1:00AM weekdays, (Saturdays & Sundays/Holidays both have their own bus schedule) and will take you downtown in about 30 minutes. Fare is $2.45. Use Winnipeg Transit's Navigo Trip Planner for specific directions. 

Private Airport Transportation
There are usually, but not always, taxi cabs and Limo Sedans-for-hire waiting at the airport.
*Taxi - Expect to pay around $20 plus tip (15-20%) for a taxi (room for about 2-3 people depending on luggage) to central Winnipeg. Maximum fare to anywhere in the city is about $55 depending on traffic. 
*Limo or Shuttle - Limo-Sedan fares (up to 4 people with luggage) are generally $30 flat rate and up. The Limos can actually be cheaper per/person than a taxi depending on where you are going and because your price is pre-determined, the traffic and time it takes is not a factor. If you need a Limo or Shuttle Van (up to 10 people with luggage) you should have it pre-booked to guarantee it will be there, especially in the winter. Pre-booking a Limo will cost you a little more, but it will be there when you arrive and waiting, just for you. 
*Rental - The Winnipeg airport has five car rental companies on-site: Avis, Budget, Enterprise, Hertz and National. Car Rental counters are located on the main floor of the Parkade across from the terminal.

By bus

*Greyhound Canada and Grey Goose, +1 (800) 661-8747, provide service to Winnipeg from across the continent; routes also extend throughout the province of Manitoba. The bus depot is at the airport.

By car

Winnipeg is on the Trans-Canada Highway 
*From the south, take US Interstate 29, which then becomes Provincial Highway 75, and Pembina Highway once inside Winnipeg's city limits. Winnipeg is one hour from the Canada-US border and two and one half hours from , ND. 
*From the west, the Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1) leads directly to Winnipeg from Regina. Winnipeg is 3 hours and 20 minutes from the Manitoba-Saskatchewan border. 
*From the east, Ontario Highway 17 becomes Highway 1 at the Manitoba border (at which time it becomes a 4-lane divided highway). The journey from the Ontario border to Winnipeg's outside "Perimeter Highway" is about 1 hour and 30 minutes and about another 30-45 minutes to DTN, depending on traffic. 

Approximate driving times from nearby cities to Winnipeg are about 8 hours from Saskatoon, 6 hours from Regina, 2.75 hours from Kenora, 8 hours from Thunder Bay, 3.5 hours from Fargo, 6 hours from Bismarck and 7 hours from Sioux Falls or Minneapolis. It is 14 hours from Edmonton, Calgary or Chicago.

Get around 
Winnipeg is a large, spread-out city, and it can take a while to get around. Unlike most North American cities this size, there is no urban freeway network in the city. Public transportation service is adequate to good in the inner part of the city and on main suburban roads, but only fair to poor in outer suburban areas and some bus routes run only infrequently during the evening or on weekends. Traffic jams, particularly in the downtown area, are common during the rush hour periods which are generally from 0730 to 0900 and 1530 to 1730 Monday to Friday. Much of Winnipeg's downtown real estate is devoted to parking, with ubiquitous and cheap surface lots continuing for multi-block stretches. It is worth considering renting a car, especially if any excursions outside of the city are planned.

Navigating
Highways. Winnipeg is one of the first Canadian cities of its size to have a ring road (Highway 100/101), which provides a by-pass for travelers on the Trans-Canada Highway. Portage Avenue, the city route of the Trans-Canada Highway, follows regular city streets.

Street names. All streets in Winnipeg have names. Major routes will have both names and route numbers, but will almost always be called by the name. A notable exception is Route 90, which is commonly called Kenaston in the southern half of the city and Route 90 in the northern half. Many streets change names as they wind through the city, which can be extremely confusing, even to locals. The most known example is the street that is Salter in the north end of the city, but as it goes south becomes Isabel, Colony, Memorial, Osborne, Dunkirk, and finally Dakota in the south end, with no clear indication when it changes. 

One-way streets. Many downtown streets are one-direction, which can make navigating downtown quite confusing. One-way streets are rare outside of downtown

No left turns. Many busy streets limit left hand turns, particularly during rush hour. This is especially prevalent downtown, but is common in the rest of the city as well. 

Confusion corner. This intersection is mainly where Osborne St and Pembina Hwy meet, but other streets connect as well, and there are bus-only lanes. There are many lanes going different directions, and it can be very confusing to know which lane you need to be in, which has given the intersection the name "confusion corner".

North End. The area of the city just north of downtown is known as the north end. This is the poorest part of the city and extra precautions should be taken when traveling through here, especially at night (though most crime is gang related rarely involving innocent bystanders). There is a very noticeable drop in the quality of infrastructure when you cross from downtown into the north end, but it is also a very sudden change so it is important to be mindful of your surroundings.

On foot

Winnipeg is generally not a walking-centric city. Because municipal law mandates that all new buildings must contain large amounts of parking between the sidewalk and the building itself, pedestrians will be confronted with a morass of cars in all directions. Winnipeg's main arteries all contain boulevards and are extremely wide by world standards, with Main Street having ten lanes where it meets Portage Avenue downtown. However, this pedestrian-unfriendliness is primarily perceived rather than real. Virtually all streets contain sidewalks on both sides running for the street's entire length, and stoplight crossings are frequent even on highways.

One should note that walking across Portage and Main is prohibited and physically impeded by concrete barricades. Since the 1970's, and despite protests, pedestrians have been required to cross this famous intersection through an underground concourse, which has a variety of entry points in or near the office towers on all four corners. 

Distance from Portage and Main to:
*The Forks: 10-15 minutes
*St. Boniface: 15-20 minutes
*Osborne Village: 20 minutes
*Corydon Ave: 30 minutes

Interesting walks in Central Winnipeg: 
*River Walks along the Red and Assiniboine Rivers (notably from the Legislature to The Forks)
*Esplanade Riel from The Forks to St.Boniface
*Tache and Provencher Avenues in St. Boniface
*Broadway from Osborne to Main
*Exchange District, all around. 
*Osborne St from River to Pembina. 

Winnipeg Walkway

As it can get very cold during Winnipeg's winters, the downtown area has a network of tunnels and sky-walks. The Walkway is a system of 14 skyways and 7 tunnels connecting 38 buildings and allowing for a maximum protected walk of 2 km. As far east as the Fairmont Hotel east of Main Street all the way west to One Canada Centre on Portage Avenue (across from The Bay). It connects you to all of the buildings around Portage and Main, Winnipeg Square, Cityplace and Portage Place malls, the Millennium Library (Winnipeg's central library branch) and the MTS Centre arena. It has many shops along the way, making travelling during the winter a lot easier.

By bike

Winnipeg is not a very cycle-friendly city. Visiting cyclists should be especially cautious when riding anywhere in Winnipeg (it is noteworthy to mention that cyclists are entitled to occupy an entire lane if safety is a concern). Winnipeg drivers can be very impatient and reckless. Bicycle theft is common throughout all areas of the city. 

There are few bicycle lanes in the city. These are denoted by diamond markings on the lane. The lanes are often shared with buses. 

There has been some effort made to expand bicycling infrastructure in recent years, with the city's "Active Transportation" website listing some of the completed and partially completed bicycle lanes 

If cycling through Winnipeg in winter, it's recommended that one dresses in layers and reflective materials. It gets dark in the late afternoon in late November, December and January.

By public transit

Winnipeg Transit, +1 (877) 311-4974 or 311 (local), has bus routes running throughout the city. Service is generally good on major routes in the inner city but only fair to poor in the outer suburban areas. The Winnipeg Transit's website includes schedules and a helpful travel planner called Navigo. Automated schedules are available through Telebus, +1 (204) 287-7433. Handi-Transit, +1 (204) 986-5722, is available for disabled persons. 

As of November 9th, 2013, adult bus fare is $2.55 (CDN). There is a reduced fare of $2.05 for children 6-16, high school/college students, and seniors (65+ years of age), for which identification is required. Children 5 and under are free with a fare-paying adult. Drivers will only accept exact change in cash. A transfer can be requested when you pay your fare, which entitles you to ride as many buses as you like within the next 60 minutes. You may also purchase tickets at reduced rates at almost any convenience store.

There are a variety of passes available, which can also be purchased at any convenience store. Of note to travelers is the Max 5 pass, which can be used Monday to Friday, and the Superpass, which can be used from Monday to Sunday. Please keep in mind that the Max 5 is only available for adults.

By taxi
Taxis are licensed in Winnipeg and every driver must have their identification visible. For security purposes, taxi drivers are protected by a shield and have video surveillance. By law, fares are non-negotiable and determined by a meter. Smoking and open alcohol are not allowed. The most common taxi model is the smaller Toyota Prius. 

Winnipeg Taxicab Tariff: Starting fee: $3.50 with 72.5 metres, then $0.10 for each additional 72.5 metres + $0.10 for each 13.18 seconds of time. Whenever the taxi stops, there's a "waiting time charge" of $0.10 for each 13.18 seconds of metered waiting time. A 10 km ride works out to about $17.20 + any waiting times + tip (15-20%).

*Vital (handicap) Transit Services Limited +1 (204) 633-2022 
*Winnipeg Shuttle & LIMO XTRA SERVICE +1 (204) 981-0981 

By car
Driving is the easiest way to get around Winnipeg. On-street parking, which ranges from $1-2/hr can usually be found in popular areas if you are willing to search. Keep in mind that during rush hour, most of these spaces will turn into no stopping zones in order to facilitate traffic flow. If these are unavailable, there are parkages or parking lots which will provide a variety of hourly rates. These are roughly twice as expensive as street parking, but they are convenient and located all over the downtown area. If visiting the Forks, keep in mind that there is a large parkage and two lots which provide free parking for visitors.

Auto theft is a serious problem in Winnipeg. Anti-theft devices are strongly recommended, especially immobilizers. Never leave your vehicle running and never leave any objects visible inside, especially aftermarket stereo equipment.

Sports

*Winnipeg Jets Ice hockey (National Hockey League): Canada Life Centre, Portage Avenue and Donald Street.

The team resurrected the Jets name that had been used by two other Winnipeg-based hockey teams, most notably the city's former NHL franchise. The Jets play at Canada Life Centre, built in 2004 and a first-class venue for hockey games and concerts, though small by NHL standards. The hockey season begins in October; the regular season ends in mid-April, followed by the Stanley Cup playoffs that run into June.

They have been riding a wave of success with three consecutive Grey Cup appearances, with the team winning the CFL championship in 2019 and 2021. The CFL season starts in June and ends in November. Their home stadium, IG Field, was opened at Chancellor Matheson Road and University Crescent on the University of Manitoba campus at the beginning of the 2013 season. The facility is considered one of the best of its kind in Canada. 

*Manitoba Moose Ice hockey (American Hockey League): Canada Life Centre, Portage Avenue and Donald Street. The Manitoba Moose are best known these days as the AHL affiliate of the Winnipeg Jets, but they have a history of their own in Winnipeg which dates back to 1996.

Tickets are more affordable and plentiful than ones for the parent club, and the games are especially popular with families.

*Winnipeg ICE Hockey (Western Hockey League): Wayne Fleming Arena, 109 Sidney Smith St., on the University of Manitoba campus. After a long absence from Winnipeg, the Western Hockey League (WHL) brought major junior hockey back to Winnipeg with the Winnipeg ICE.

Stay safe

Winnipeg has a moderately high crime rate by Canadian standards, but low violent crime by American or global standards. Much crime is gang or alcohol related and rarely involves tourists who exercise the same degree of caution they would in any other urban center. Areas where higher degree of caution is advised at night include areas north of City Hall on Main Street and the area surrounding Central Park. 

Panhandlers are less numerous in Winnipeg compared to cities like Vancouver and Victoria, BC and they are very seldom aggressive, however displays of obvious wealth such as jewelry and expensive digital cameras should be kept to a minimum. It is best not to acknowledge panhandlers and to keep walking. 

Winnipeg has a history of substantial auto theft and "smash and grab" problem, though the problem has been reduced in recent years. As in any city, common sense should prevail. Never leave a vehicle unlocked and under no circumstances should any object be left in the car interior where it can be seen, no matter what the value (includes CD's, gloves, clothing, tools, etc). Keep all items in the trunk. Most importantly, never leave any coins, no matter what the amount in your ashtray or console. An individual with drugs or alcohol dependency will not hesitate to smash a car window even for less than $1. 

If you rent a vehicle, ensure with your rental agency that it is equipped with an immobilizer. If you drive your own vehicle here, Manitoba Public Insurance offers a most-at-risk vehicle assessment While this is aimed at those intending to register vehicles in Manitoba, tourists may use this to consider if their vehicle is at an elevated risk for theft. Out of province tourists may also consult with their automobile insurance agent.

Consulates
