Kristiansund is a city and municipality on the mid-western coast of , located in county. It is arguably the city with the most special and interesting architecture of Norway, which originates from the aftermath of World War Two, when nearly 80% of the city was demolished by bombs. Situated on five islands slightly off the shore of main-land Norway. The natural harbour formed by the islands is considered to be very unique and particularly beautiful, protecting the city centre from winds and weather outside in the Atlantic Ocean. 

Understand
Name and history
It is believed that some of the very first Norwegians settled in what is now Kristiansund as the area was ice-free in the wake of the last ice age. Kristiansund gained some importance in the 17th century as a customs station for freight on its way to Trondheim. This resulted in a small settlement named Lille-Fosen in which now is Kristiansund. By the end of the 17th century, Dutch sailors brought the knowledge of clipfish production to the area which resulted in Kristiansund being Norway's largest exporter of clipfish for a number of years, mostly serving markets in the Mediterranean region. This sparked economic growth to the settlement which was awarded town status in 1742 and named Christianssund ("Christian's strait") after the Dano-Norwegian king Christian VI. The town's name was later modified to Kristiansund to reflect Norwegian language standards rather than Danish. 

Geography

Kristiansund is built on four main islands (known as "lands" by the locals), namely Nordlandet, Innlandet, Kirkelandet/Gomalandet and Frei that are connected by a series of bridges. The city center is located at Kirkelandet and the surrounding islands form a natural harbor protecting it from the harsh whether conditions of the Norwegian Sea. Additionally, Kristiansund encompasses a number of smaller islets, most notably Grip; a deserted fishing village now popular as a summer tourist destination due to its location out in the open sea and distinctive architecture.

Kristiansund is very densely populated; especially on the islands of Nordlandet, Innlandet and Kirkelandet/Gomalandet. The relatively small size of these islands and the constricted harbor has resulted in Kristiansund having what is arguably Norway's most urban small city center.

Climate
According to the Köppen Climate Classification, Kristiansund has a maritime, temperate climate with cool to warm summers and relatively mild winters. The sheltered harbor and the city's maritime location moderate the year-round temperatures. The summers are therefore on average cooler than farther inland and the winters are much milder – snow on the ground rarely lasts more than a couple of days at a time in winter. The weather is however very varied and unpredictable and Kristiansund often experiences "four seasons in one day" throughout the year.

Drink
There is a broad array of bars and nightclubs available in Kristiansund. Opening hours vary depending on day and venue but on weekends (Friday and Saturday) most bars and nightclubs close at 2:30 AM. Nightclubs tend to open relatively late (10–11 PM) while bars run on longer hours (some open early afternoon).

Norway maintains two legal drinking ages (18 for alcoholic beverages up to 19.9% ABV and 20 for 20% ABV and higher). Bars and nightclubs therefore tend to require guests to be at least 20 years of age to enter, thus avoiding checking the age of every individual when purchasing drinks. Some venues allow those between 18 and 20 to enter certain times of the day or certain days of the week (during which time IDs are checked upon purchase). Others have secluded areas where alcoholic beverages stronger than 19.9% ABV aren't served. Be prepared to document your age at the doormen before being allowed to enter any bar or nightclub. Regulations relating to the consumption of alcoholic beverages are very strict throughout Norway and strongly enforced. A valid proof of age should be government issued, like a drivers license, national ID card, debit/credit card with photo and date of birth imprinted, passport or equivalent. 

It is strongly discouraged to attempt gaining entry to bars and nightclubs using a fake ID. If caught, using someone else's ID will most likely result in a hefty fine. Those caught modifying one's own ID in order to appear old enough to enter run the risk of being charged with forging a government issued document; a serious crime under Norwegian law.
