Guilin (桂林; Guì​lín) is a city in , . Guilin is a scenic town and one of the best-known tourist destinations in China. There are many scenic places within short traveling distance of Guilin. These include with its famous Longji rice terraces; the , a scene of which is printed on the back of ; , a small county downstream from Guilin; and much more. This makes Guilin an excellent base for exploring the northern end of Guangxi Province.

Guilin is a beautiful city. The town center is surrounded by two rivers and four lakes and studded with sheer sided karst mountains. Outside the city center, the buildings are less well kept. The main industry in the city is tourism so the city is much cleaner than other Chinese cities.

Guilin itself is like most other medium size Chinese cities, other than that it has a large number of western-style hotels, tourists and is relatively free of air pollution. Many Chinese domestic tourists also flock to this area. What makes it special is its proximity to many picturesque limestone mountains and formations.

Avoid traveling during December-February if you can as the weather tends to be depressingly cold and rainy almost every day with a fog that obscures most views. January especially is the low season. Only a couple of boats operate the Li river cruise from Guilin to Yangshuo (no boats to Xingping) during this time.

Understand

Separated from the center of China and the Yangtze River basin by the Nan Mountains, Guangxi has always been distinct from the rest of China. The Han Chinese empire first expanded into Guangxi in the 2nd century BC. The Ling Canal was cut around the time, allowing small boats to transit from the Yangtze to the south flowing Xi River via the Xiang River.

Trade grew along the canal and river routes. Guilin was founded as a trading post in the 1st century BC on the West bank of the Kuei River. During the Ming dynasty, a garrison was set up in Guilin and the surrounding area gradually civilised with the development of farmland. The city had a population of over two million at the time of the Second World War, but was utterly destroyed during the war. The population slowly recovered with post-war construction of several factories for the production of paper, chemicals and agricultural equipment. However, market forces have caused several of these industries to relocate out of Guilin.

Guangxi and Guilin are home to 12 different ethnic minorities besides the Han Chinese. Guangxi is an autonomous region for the Zhuang ethnic group, rather than a province. See . Various other minorities, such as the Dong, are also found in the area.

Guilin is the third largest city in Guangxi, after Nanning and Liuzhou.

Get in

By plane
There are daily flights to Guilin Liangjiang International Airport (KWL) from major mainland cities and from , , , , , and . Book air ticket early as the price will increase as it approaches your traveling day. At off season, air ticket may be cheaper than train ticket (even the hard sleeper price), it is worth a try to check the difference.

 provides flights to Guilin from 4 times per week.

Airport bus to town is &yen;20, but drops just south of the city center at the Aviation Hotel where you can find taxis waiting. From the airport, a Taxi should then be around &yen;100 to most hotels in the city center. Request meter 'da biao' at the airport taxi rank and overall pricing to downtown hotels should be slightly less than 100 CNY. Many hotels arrange for a "shuttle" (in practice, a taxi). Also, be wary of hotels arranging 'free pick-ups' as some persistently try to sell tours during the journey. Travel time to the city center by taxi is roughly 40 minutes. The airport bus only leaves when full-ish so there may be a wait as the bus fills up. 

Back to the airport, a hotel may arrange the trip for &yen;80.

By train
Guilin has three train stations. Guilin Station (Guilin Zhan) is in the centre of town on Zhongshan Nanlu, Guilin North Station (Guilin Bei Zhan) is far away from downtown area, and Guilin West Station (Guilin Xi Zhan, started operation in January 2016) is even farther from downtown (north west to Guilin North Station). Most, but not all, trains which originate/terminate in Guilin go to or come from Guilin North; trains which come through Guilin from elsewhere usually only go to Guilin Station and not Guilin North; and Guilin West Station is on Guiyang-Guangzhou High-speed Railway. High speed trains are now serving Guilin (January 2014) from Nanning to Beijing significantly cutting down journey time (Guilin to Nanning 2 hours), (Guilin to Liuzhou 1 hour) & (Guilin to Beijing 10 hours).

There are trains from North (Beijing, Changsha, Wuhan, Shanghai, Xian), West (Kunming), South (Liuzhou, Nanning, Zhanjiang), and East (Guangzhou, Shenzhen).

*From &mdash; If for some reason you need to rush from Beijing to Guilin or vice-versa, there are three trains on either direction. To Beijing, trains depart from Guilin (not Guilin Bei) at 12:59AM (train from Zhanjiang), 3:06PM (from Nanning) and 7:30PM. Journey time is between 10 hours and 30 hours, with the 3:06PM train being the fastest. 

*From via &mdash; Take MTR to Lo Wu via the East Rail line. After going through immigration and customs, keep to the left when exiting. To get to the area for long distance travel, you need to walk past the trains area. And then follow the text below.

*From and &mdash; The bullet(high speed) trains have started to run. There are trains between Guilin and Guangzhou almost every 2 hours and it takes a bit less than 3hrs. There are only 3 bullet trains between Guilin and Shenzhen. It takes about 3.5hrs and costs CNY212 for a seat in 2nd class.

*From via &mdash; It is relatively easy to book a train ticket to either Shenzhen or Guangzhou on MTR, however note that if going to Guangzhou there are two stations in this city, the MTR trains terminate in Guangzhou Station and the domestic trains depart from the other East Station, which is on the other side of the city and a fairly long metro ride (English is on the Metro ticket machine). There is a metro entrance in the train station when you arrive in Guangzhou, and it is a bit of a pain to find, just look for the stairs going down in a corner of the station. And then follow the text above.

*From &mdash; There are 3 D trains between Kunming and Guilin: D3942 (07:38/15:35), D3944 (11:02/18:42), D3946 (15:25/22:49). The fare of second class ticket is ¥373.5. The conventional train T382 departs Kunming at 21:15, and arrive in Guilin at 15:19 in the following day. The fare of hard sleeper class is ¥261.5.

*From &mdash; D trains began to run between Xian and Guilin in early 2018, which takes nearly 11 hours. The fare of second class ticket is ¥544.5. The conventional train K318 is still in operation, which departs Xi'an at 19:07, and arrives at 21:18+1, 26 hours later. The fare for hard sleeper class is ¥343 per ticket (hard seat ¥201). The train's final stop is Nanning.

*From &mdash; There are many high speed trains (under 3 hours) and a few conventional trains (4-6 hours). It is very convenient to travel between the two cities. One way second-class ticket of high speed train costs ¥108.

*From &mdash; Since January of 2018, D trains have been launched between Chengdu and Guilin. Currently there are 8 departures a day. More will be added in the near future. The travel time via high speed rail varies from train to train, around 7 hours. The original train K652 is not in operation anymore. The fare of second class ticket is ¥315.5.

Once you get out of the train station, you will be approached by cab drivers/other drivers alike. While their cab meters are trustworthy, they might use a few tricks to cheat you out of some RMB, for example, aggressively pushing tours or adding false charges to the tab.

By car
There are some expressways locally and within the province, however for any long distance journey, it is a two lane road. Drivers need to have a local Chinese license and international driving license doesn't work.

By bus
*From &mdash; Minibuses (RMB20, Oct 2013) depart when full from the square in front of the Guilin railway station. Although the signs are written in Chinese, there are always conductors yelling out Yangshuo. As the buses pick-up and let down passengers along the way, the journey time can take anything from 1.5-2 hours. Express buses (RMB23.5 incl. 1.5RMB mandatory insurance on separate slip, Oct 2013) depart from the Guilin bus terminal off Zhongshan Nanlu, several hundred metres north of the railway station (and on the same side of the road as the station). Buses depart about every 20min from 7AM. Buy tickets from the ticket office in the bus terminal or from conductor inside the bus. These buses are big with big space for your legs and depart on time, no matter if they are half empty without passengers, they don't stop on the road so journey takes convenient 80-90mins, highly recommended option compared to small buses departing from front of train station. People selling tickets on the street are actually swinders and their 'tickets' are not accepted.

*From elsewhere &mdash; Buses link Guilin with a multitude of destinations, including , , , and further afield. Buses depart from the Guilin bus terminal on Zhongshan Nanlu, several hundred metres north of the railway station. The direct bus to seems to no longer be running, as of November 2013.

By boat
You can get to Guilin by cargo boat from via , but there are no passenger boats to Guilin anymore, except the boats to and from . You can take a cargo boat if you want to at almost no cost from to .

Get around
Getting a local map from a tourist guide or shop for ¥5 is a good idea. This will show the location of most of the sights as well as details of bus routes. Buses are an ideal way to get around Guilin on a budget. Many city parks and river spots can be accessed easily by bus. All the buses starting with 5# are free. A useful one is bus 58 which runs from the train station (and bus station) to many of the attractions. Bus fare are capped at ¥2 per trip. 

Taxis are also inexpensive and easily hailed within the city. Usually hard to catch during peak hours (5:30PM-7PM). Taxi meters begin at ¥9 for 2km. Avoid taxi drivers at the train or bus stations asking for a fixed price that is usually more than running the meter. As always in China, ask them to run the meter( "Da Biao") and if they refuse, better to find another taxi. 

Another inexpensive way for a day-trip to scenic spots in the city area of Guilin is to get a driver for a whole or half day. Off-season a whole day is about ¥100, half is ¥50. Most hotels or hostels arrange this service, also telling the driver where you want to go if one is not capable of speaking Chinese.

By Car
Hiring a private car is a good way to explore Guilin. A full day trip with driver is about CNY500-600 for Private Guilin Transport, including fuel fees. Make sure you specify exactly where you'd like to visit beforehand and ensure that all drivers/transportation don't simply take you to the various factories and tourist shops that pay drivers commissions.

Landmarks
* 51,400 square meter large gathering place in the centre of town. Here you can watch a giant atlas on the ground and an artificial waterfall every evening at 8:30PM.

* In the center of the city lies a small forbidden city. Once home to the princes of the area. The palace buildings are now a museum. At 130RMB, it costs as much as the Taj Mahal or Angkor Wat....

*Although there is nothing much to see inside the pagodas, the view from the outside as well as the surrounding lake offers a good respite from the traffic and noise of Guilin's city center.

Museums and galleries
* 

* Newly opened at the end of 2016, Guilin Museum was moved to Linggui New District (16 km west of city downtown), collecting over 30’000 pieces of culture relics including 22 pieces of national first-class relics, 687 pieces of national second-class relics and 2592 national third-class relics. For foreigners, passports may be required to get free admission tickets. 

* Exhibits folk art, handicraft, architecture, food and culture of various local ethnic groups. The center also stages local music and dance shows. As of July 2017, closed for renovation. 

Parks in the city

* Together they form single mountain range as well as a single recreational zone. There's a plenty of restaurants at the bottom of Pagoda hill. An easy stepped pathway brings you to the Ming dinasty (before 1644 A.D.) multi-eave Longevity Buddha Pagoda. Another free pathway (on the other bank of Li river channel) takes you up the Penetrated Hill. Both hills have very beautiful view of southern Guilin and rustic beds. Guards at the park entrance easily omit chinese looking people, but if you're caucasian, they'll try to take money from you.

* One of the oldest botanical gardens in China. Nothing pecular, many closed areas inside the park.

* A large park with a small zoo area on the east side farthest from the entrance with the main attraction being the giant pandas and the red pandas, additional fee to enter the zoo of ¥32, the staff host a small show with monkeys, bear, tigers and lion at scheduled hours. Additional ¥60 fee to enter Seven Star Cave inside the park.

* Park with a lake, temples and hundreds of Buddhist statues. In the park is also the Hidden Hill with a number of caves. Guilin Museum is also here, see separate listing.

* 300,000 square meter area with tigers, bears, lions and other wild animals. Here you can witness research, breeding and entertainment. The place is a bit shabby and you will not see the animals in their natural environment, but you get close to the animals and can see them being much more active than in a zoo. This attraction is subject to international media controversy regarding its treatment of animals (circus animals, mistreatment of tigers & a live show showing where a tiger is placed in a pen area with a cow and subsequently hunts/attacks the cow). Western visitors will often be accompanied around the Zoo with security to ensure video recordings aren't made.

Landscape close to the city centre
* A park built around several peaks, which are climbed using stone staircases. There is also a small aviary and butterfly museum with examples of pinned and mounted butterflies and moths in the park.

* Contains historical stone carvings from the Tang Dynasty and Buddhist inscriptions. The hill itself is an impressive sheer sided rock.

* Hill with a large natural arch cut into it. This resembles the trunk of an Elephant dipping into the river. This scene is frequently used as a symbol of the city and so has developed some fame. There is a funny and cheaper alternative to get into the park, you can go all the way to the river on the street just at the right side of the west gate, you will find some people asking if you want a boat that they drop you in the park for half-price of the official ticket. It is pretty much impossible to get a good view of the natural arch without going on a boat tour as trees have been planted to prevent people from freeloading the view. But you can walk along river for few hundred meters and then use stairs and go to shallow water and some concrete islands in river to see what you are not missing by not paying 75RMB. Except planted trees there is also barbed wire under electricity (there are warning signs ocassionally, didn't try) to make sure nobody will see nature for free!

* This is a river going through the western parts of town. Beautiful and relaxing area. As the name indicates, here you can see the peach blossom in spring our the red leaves in autumn.

* This limestone cave with impressive stalactite and stalagmite formations is worth a visit if you have not seen such caves before. An English-speaking guide will take you around the various artificially lit formations supposedly resembling lions, monkeys, old men, the skyline of Guilin, etc. There is also a brief laser/light/music show inside the cave. You may have to wait a while for a large enough group to accumulate. Avoid the hawkers by taking the elevated path on the side of the hill, rather than the tarmac road.

* Rises dramatically above the center of Guilin and offers spectacular views of the city and surrounding countryside. As with so many peaks and rocky upthrusts in and around Guilin, centuries of visits have led to the creation of a carved stairway leading to the summit. The pathway starts at Wang Cheng, the Ming Dynasty palace in the center of town, now home to the campus of Guangxi Normal University and also the site of nightly performances by local ethnic minorities. Only the city walls and some of the foundation of the original buildings are left, the buildings themselves are all recent. Ticket costs RMB130 (Oct 2013) which is basically same as tickets to Forbidden City and Summer palace and Great wall combined together, avoid this tourist trap and don't waste your time here.

* This is a large country park which encompasses the highest peak in the area. Foot paths run to the summit, however the chair lift provides an effortless way to attain the top and enjoy the scenery. There are extensive views of the surrounding area from the summit. There is a wheeled toboggan run down part of the mountain for additional ¥45. To access this, dismount the chairlift at the station half way down the mountain. A taxi to and from the park will cost about ¥25 each way. If you plan to do this, alert the staff at the ground station so personnel at the midway station can help you get off. There is a Ming Dynasty Mausoleum nearby as well. The park is not listed on any of the tourist maps so you may get some looks on asking where it is.

* Feng Yuyan due to river where oil abundance of fish named, known as " one through nine, Miao Jing must the world " reputation, known as "Asia's first hole".

Parks and landscape outside the city centre

*A 3km section of the cave is currently open to tourists. At the entrance of the cave, take the elevator and venture 30m deep into the cave. After looking at the various stalactite and stalagmite formations, you can also visit the waterfall (&yen;5) inside the cave. After that, take the monorail to admire the largest and most beautiful section of the cave. To exit the cave, you can either travel back to the entrance point, or take a boat that will travel from the cave to the banks of the Li River.

* Waterfall with water comming from springs.

Nearby towns and villages
* Ancient town at the east bank of the Li River dating back more than 1,000 years. The town is beautifully located close to the Millstone Hill and the Snail Hill. The heart of town is the 2 km long Bluestone St with many well preserved buildings. The town has lots of attractions dating back hundreds of years including the Gauzu Temple, The Hanhuang Temple, the assembly halls, the Longevity Bridge and the Seven Stars Tombs.
*Karst topography - Karst topography is a landscape formed from the dissolution of soluble rocks such as limestone, dolomite, and gypsum. It is characterized by underground drainage systems with sinkholes and caves. It has also been documented for more weathering-resistant rocks, such as quartzite, given the right conditions. The Karst topography in Guilin is one of the largest in the world and thanks to the receding water from hundreds of millions of years ago, the gulf in Guilin bared hills made from limestone and dolomite rocks. As the hills protruded in the newly revealed landscape, rain, wind, and countless rivers develop the unique contours of the hills and the magnificent structures in the caves. All of these took 70 million years for nature to pull off. As acidic water slowly eats the bedrock by flowing to the fractures on the ground, these cracks became wider and allow more water to pass through them accelerating the formation of underground drainage creating caves and underground rivers. The Guilin Karst landscape is a classic example of large scale bedrock dissolution process, dissolving more bedrock than it eventually left out. This made the towering Karst hills possible.
In fact the sharp, slender slopes made the Guilin site very unique from other Karst landscapes of the world. This explains the extensive underground structures – a lot of water was channeled from the hills to the ground creating enormous cave complexes. The scale of the hills and the huge number of interconnected caves and rivers made this area a wonderful place to just be amazed of the natural sites on your every turn. Two types of karst landscapes predominate in Guilin: fenglin or peak forest (isolated towers) and fengcong or peak cluster (linked-base towers). The two types may have evolved sequentially from peak forest to peak cluster, or they may have evolved simultaneously. Beiersdorfer described this landscape, which he saw during a recent visit to China: "China in general and the Guilin area specifically boasts some of the most spectacular karst topography in the world."

Stay safe

Guilin is quite safe by both Chinese and International standards, but having said that :

* Watch your valuables very closely in the central city, (money belt) as in many tourist locations is a common occurrence. The bus station is the most dangerous place in the city. Keep on guard when boarding and disembarking your bus! Never carry your wallet in your pocket! Organized gangs of pickpockets operate in this area and they will focus on you if you are of non-East Asian decent.
