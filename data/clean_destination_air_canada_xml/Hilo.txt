Hilo is a city on the of . The county seat and largest city in Hawaii County, Hilo is one of the best starting points to explore the eastern half of the island, including Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.

Get in
Hilo International Airport Hilo Airport is the main airport serving Hilo and the eastern side of the Big Island. The majority of flights to Hilo originate from Honolulu via Hawaiian Airlines and Southwest. There is also one flight from Kahului daily, and one non-stop flight from LAX daily, operated by United Airlines.

Most of the visitors bound for Hilo will arrive via one of the inter-island Airlines (Hawaiian and Southwest), or as a day stop from one of the frequent cruise ship visits.

Get around 

As public transportation on Hawai`i Island is minimal, virtually all visitors rent a vehicle from one of the many rental agencies upon arriving at Hilo International Airport. As an alternative, taxis are also available at the airport through renting a car is almost always more practical. The county's Hele-On Bus system ($1 fare) does not serve Hilo International Airport, though, for those who travel light, it's theoretically possible to walk to Mamalahoa Hwy in the heat to catch a bus, which runs only a few times a day, please check schedules. It's a good idea to make car reservations in advance, as special events or active conditions at the Volcanoes National Park can quickly deplete the supply of available vehicles.

See 
* The Big Island's only general art museum, and has a growing collection of art from around the world. It is in the historic Hilo Iron Works building with a breathtaking view of Hilo Bay.
* Hilo Masonic Lodge Hall is a historic structure in Hilo. Constructed between 1908 and 1910. It was designed to house commercial space on the ground floor and a meeting hall for a local Masonic lodge on the second floor. The Masons stayed until around 1985. The building is located on the northwest corner of Keawe (originally known as Bridge Street) and Waianuenue Streets in Hilo, Hawaii. The Kilauea Lodge is one of two on the island today.
* 
* King Kamehameha Statue - Erected in 1997 at Wailoa State Park, the statue of King Kamehameha is perhaps the most impressive of the four found throughout the state. A gift from the island of Kauai failed to erect the statue due to the historical significance of being the only island never to be conquered by Kamehameha the Great. Standing at 14 feet tall, the statue now overlooks Hilo where the first King of Hawaii established his seat of government.
* Lili'uokalani Gardens - Located on Banyan Drive, this authentic Japanese garden was built in the early 1900s as a memorial to the immigrant Japanese who developed the old Waiakea Sugar Plantation and is named in honor of Hawaii's last reigning monarch, Queen Liliuokalani. The park lies southeast of downtown Hilo, on the Waiakea Peninsula in Hilo Bay. Much of the park now consists of Edo-style Japanese gardens and is said to be the largest such garden outside Japan. The gardens contain Waihonu Pond as well as bridges, ponds, pagodas, statues, torii, and a Japanese teahouse.
* Mokuola (Coconut Island) - Mokuola is a small island in Hilo Bay. It is a small park and is connected to the main island via a footbridge. The island includes a large grassy field, picnic areas, restroom facilities, and a few tiny sandy beaches. A popular recreational activity is to jump off the tower into the waters of Hilo Bay. The name Mokuola translates as "healing island" or "island of life" from the Hawaiian language. Moku meaning "island" and ola means "life." It was the site of an ancient temple dedicated to healing. It is located off Banyan Drive. Legend tells that anyone who was sick or feeling ill would be healed by swimming around Mokuola three times.
* It was prophesied that the man who moved the Naha stone, which weighs nearly 5000 pounds, would unite all of the Hawaiian islands and be the greatest king of all Hawaii. Kamehameha, at the age of fourteen, not only moved the stone, but lifted it end over end, and he eventually fulfilled the prophecy. The Pinao stone, which sits next to the Naha stone, once guarded an ancient temple.
* This museum features a restored missionary house (hourly guided tours). They also have a small collection of local artwork, historical exhibits, and the 9th-best mineral collection in the United States.

* Serves as a living memorial, and a reminder for a generation yet to experience such fright. A tsunami, Japanese for “harbor waves” is a fact of life in Hawaii, especially in Hilo. On 1 April 1946, and 23 May 1960, Hilo suffered devastating tsunamis that reshaped its social and economic structure. The goals of the Museum are to promote public tsunami education and to preserve history. The Museum serves as a living memorial to those who lost their lives in past tsunami events.
* Rainbow Falls: If you don't have time to make it up to Akaka Falls, or you don't like hiking, Rainbow Falls is worth a visit. Try to visit early in the day. You have a better chance to see the rainbow created by the mist. Drive-up Waianuenue Avenue from downtown, following the signs. If you pass the hospital, you have gone too far. Very wheelchair accessible, but the Boiling Pots will require some hiking. 
 
* Waiakea Pond: The largest natural lake on Hawaii's Big Island is Waiakea Pond. Waiakea Pond is connected to Wailoa Stream which meanders on its journey down from the lower reaches of Mauna Loa volcano in the center of the island toward the ocean at Hilo. It collects freshwater from a number of springs, with excess water flowing out through a channel to Wailoa Stream which empties into the ocean at Hilo Bay. Waiakea Pond is regularly used for fishing, with the portion of the lake south of the footbridges designated as public fishing waters.

Do 
* This park offers a quick diversion into a lava tube. You can descend on a metal ladder into a skylight in a lava tube that was created by an 1881 flow from Mauna Loa. The Caves are fun to explore and it's free. You should bring sturdy shoes and your own flashlight. There are no admission fees, and the park features restrooms and picnic tables.
* Popular tour with flights over macadamia nut plantations to the lava flows at Kilauea. Doors off tours over the volcano let you feel the heat from 500 feet above.
* Other ocean fun can be found at Richardson's Ocean Park at the end of Kalanianaole (Highway 19). This is a popular spot for family cookouts and has occasional waves. Snorkeling is a popular activity here. You can also find people relaxing on the beach or on the grass reading and visiting. 
* Many of the activities that are available are strictly daytime and focus on the ocean. Surf culture is big, and boards may be rented from Orchidland Surf, located in the Bayfront district. Stan, the owner, will be happy to fill you in on where to go as well as the current conditions.
* A popular swimming spot, also located on Kalanianaole, before you get to Richardson's. Though there is no 'beach', it is rather like a large saltwater swimming pool, with a sandy bottom, protected from the ocean by a reef. The brackish water is colder, a mix of the ocean and freshwater springs. If you go early afternoon you are likely to see large sea turtles that have swum in from the other side of the reef.

Events
* The Merrie Monarch Festival is an internationally renowned hula competition. The festival also has a parade, and arts and crafts. The festival runs a week and takes place every spring.

Prince Kuhio Plaza Area

The Prince Kuhio Plaza is the main retail center in Hilo. It is surrounded by many larger retailers and shops. It is best to have a car, as Highway 11 from Banyan Drive to the Plaza is not the most pedestrian-friendly boulevard.

Eat 

Hilo is known for its locally-made ice cream. It's some of the best on earth and can be found several places, including Hilo Homemade Ice Cream downtown at 41 Waianuenue Avenue.

The Hilo Farmer's Market, on the corner of Kamehameha Avenue and Mamo Street, has lots of cheap eats. If you love tropical fruit, this is the place to go. There's a great tamale stand in the west corner of the market serving very tasty $2 tamales. Market open daily 7AM to 5PM, with extended hours on Wednesdays and Saturdays. The small town of Pahoa offers The Pahoa Market, which is a flea market open on Sundays, has more pre-prepared food. Take Highway 130 on the way to Pahoa.

Budget

* Falling into the category of "plate lunch" place, Blane's has a large, inexpensive menu. Perfect for a heavy lunch after surfing for a couple of hours. A plate lunch, for those who don't know, usually consists of 2 scoops of steamed rice, a scoop of macaroni salad, and your choice of a variety of extremely fattening delicious goodness. For the less adventurous, they also serve up burgers, fries, chili, etc. They are famous for their loco mocos. 

* In honor of the famed 100th Infantry Army Battallion, Mr. Miyashiro who served in the 100th during World War II, established this local restaurant with his wife in 1945. Destroyed twice by the devastating tsunamis, Cafe 100 offers good food at a great price. Known for their "Loco Moco" consisting of a bowl of rice with a hamburger patty, gravy and an egg, it is one of the best places to "grind" on the island and a local favorite.

*Great light breakfast and locally made lunch specials daily. Some of the best Portuguese Bean Soup around, shoyu chicken, kalua pork, chicken, and veggie wraps made to order. Lots more. Friendly staff, great smell of coffee, tours, and unique coffee from around the state. Full espresso bar. Coffee roasted on-site.

* Don't let the name of this place throw you off. They have an amazingly varied menu, and perhaps more importantly, they are the only 24-hour eatery in Hilo.

* Home of the one pound Lau Lau!

* Ocean Sushi features low-cost original and creative sushi along with local-style Japanese food. Some favorite sushi: eel with cream cheese, scallop roll with melted cheese on top--yum! 

Mid-range

* If you have a memory of coming to Hilo as a child, and eating in a reasonably nice restaurant with a view of the bay, chances are it was Cafe Pesto. They have a wide range of food, everything from pizzas to furikake-crusted ono. It's also open late, which is a definite plus in Hilo.

* Weird name, but original Thai food.

* This restaurant was started by the owners of a local health food store (Island Naturals) and features excellent cuisine, featuring local organic produce, etc. A great place for a date. Try a Mojito. The name is somewhat misleading since it's actually located in the Prince Kuhio Mall, close to Wal-Mart. Strange location, fabulous place. Reservations may be required on Friday or Saturday nights. 

*Flavorful Thai food with very fresh ingredients. If you want it spicy, you have to ask for that.

*Hilo's best (and perhaps only) Mexican restaurant. Large portions of surprisingly authentic and tasty Mexican staples. Sue, the co-owner and bartender, pours the best (and VERY strong) margaritas in town.

* Japanese 'izakaya' type menu.

* Place sits only 10 people--cozy.

Splurge

* Excellent entres including Chicken Mauna Kea, Fillet Mingnon, fresh fish dishes and desserts such as Naughty Hula Girl Mud Pie (enough for a family of 4!) and mac nut ice cream. 

* A good northern Italian restaurant downtown. The ahi carpaccio is not to be missed. 

* An upscale Japanese restaurant, ask about their famous Chirashi bowls, you won't be disappointed.

* One of the best places to be served an "ono" and fresh seafood lunch or dinner. Seaside can be found on Kalanianaole street across from 4-mile beach.

Drink 
*Small batch craft beers are brewed at this location, 6 are rotated on tap for tastings. Can also purchase logo wear and 6 packs, growlers and fills, or rent kegs for your next party. They are the only brewery in the islands that produce and bottle all of their beers on site. Conveniently located on the way to the volcano, waterfalls, and beaches.

Bars

Hilo is a small town, and as such, there is not a lot of public drinking to be done. Despite of a very lackluster nightlife, almost every bar has a cover charge. Still, there are a few places to wet your whistle, and maybe catch a live act. 

* General sports bar not a spot for nightlife.

Coffee

* Good waffles, lame hours.
 
* Hilo Shopping Center location closed" directions (new owner) Moved to new location. Uncle Billy's convenient store located next door to the Naniloa Hotel. Best coffee and ice cream on Banyan Drive! 

* Great sandwiches and pastries and 100% pure Kona coffee.

* One is on Kilauea, the other is in the Prince Kuhio shopping center. Also at Safeway and Target, across from Home Depot.

* Great food, wonderful coffee, and the best atmosphere.

Sleep
Budget
*The Hamakua House is a rustic guest house located on the south end of Hawaii's breathtaking Hamakua Coast. Make your next getaway greener by staying in this off-the-grid house. The Hamakua Coast (Hawaii's 'green' side of the island) is the perfect place for an adventure vacation.

* 

Mid-range
* Custom built as a B&B on a lagoon at Hilo's favorite swimming beaches. One of a kind tropical setting, privacy, comfortable rooms, friendly, good food, and a great location. Beautiful house and garden with great tropical fish and plant collections. Computer station and WiFi. Cable TVs, and private phone lines in all the rooms. Lounge with books and music.

* Modest, clean accommodations. 13 Rooms. Rooms have kitchens, crockery + small eating table.

* Bed & Breakfast.

* 

* Older hotel of 286 rooms with great views. It is clean, the staff are friendly, but it is really showing its age. Beds for instance, feature bedspreads which are clearly 20+ years old. Plus, air conditioning in each room is a small corner unit that works, but is hardly central air. Internet access in rooms, but the TV is 15 inches.

*5 nice, newly restored rooms in the second floor of an old building in downtown Hilo. Free Wi-Fi, ocean or mountain views, key-less doors, very short walking distance to all the downtown Hilo offerings. Be there Wednesday or Saturday mornings for the Hilo Farmer's Market action. 

Splurge
* A restored 1912 plantation home that features 4 guest suites with private baths and lanai (porches) overlooking koi ponds, streams and Hilo Bay.

Stay Safe
Hilo is generally safe. There are usually homeless people loitering around public parks and sometimes they can be a little aggressive, just be aware of your surroundings.

Respect
*Haole: Though many think that "haole" just means white person, it refers more to an attitude than anything else. Hilo is a workaday town that more represents "old Hawai'i" and sees a limited number of tourists. Locals, known as kama'aina, deal with tourists less often than in the resort areas, so respecting the local people and culture is very important.
 
* Those who speak the Hawai'ian language tend to be either young or very old. A large portion of the population speaks Hawai'ian pidgin, but does not attempt to speak it. If a much younger person calls you "Unko" (uncle) or "Antie" (aunt), it is simply a sign of respect and acceptance. But do not call someone close to your own age "Unko" or "Antie," because it could be taken in a negative way. And, sadly, "thank you" has become more common than "mahalo" even in Hilo.

*For Surfers: If your home break is aggressive, do not bring that attitude with you. Especially when the waves get heavy, do not be a wave hog or try to drop in on others. You will find trouble if you don't know the rules.

* If you remember only one thing in this section, Hawai'i like most places in the world will be a fun adventure if you just smile and be polite. If you will simply do that, then much aloha will come back to you. As the saying goes, "Come to Hawai'i with your aloha...or don't come at all."

Get out
Check with your car rental company before driving to the Mauna Kea summit. Four-wheel drive is highly recommended.

* This awe-inspiring waterfall is the highest falls on the island. The loop trail is an easy walk through the tropical rainforest and provides several viewing opportunities. Kahuna Falls can also be viewed from the trail, though it is much less impressive than Akaka Falls.

* Nani Mau, which translates as "forever beautiful", features over 50 acres of artistically-landscaped displays of native and exotic tropical flowers and plants, a spectacular orchid garden, rare palms and tropical fruit orchards. First opened to the public in 1972, this tropical garden claims to have every flowering plant in Hawaii.

* This is the only zoo in the U.S. situated in a tropical rainforest - a playground for exotic birds and animals, including a white Bengal tiger and pygmy hippos. Three squirrel monkeys from the old Pearl City Tavern (now closed and razed, replaced by an auto dealership) are there as well. (Namasté, the tiger died on January 16, 2014. The zoo has plans to renovate the enclosure before obtaining another tiger.)

* - The entrance to the park is in the town of Volcano, roughly 40 minutes drive from downtown Hilo. Many people can spend several days exploring all that the park has to offer. There are a number of excellent hikes, showcasing most of the flavors of Hawaiian geological activity. Of course, the thing that most people come to see is the active flow zone of Kilauea. Entrance fees are consistent with other U.S. National Parks.

* Mauna Kea - It is a dormant volcano. Go to Saddle Road via State Highway 11 (either turn right on E Puainako St, and then reaching the end of a T-intersection, turn right and then make a left and with an unsigned Hawaiian Route 200; or take the Waianuenue Ave (changes into Kaumana Dr), and then after you reach an end, turn right and you will be on Saddle Road). Four-wheel drive is required to reach the summit, but the Visitor's Center, which is at approximately 9,300 feet, is reachable by a good 2-wheel drive car with excellent brakes (for the descent). An optimal view of the night sky can be seen thereafter sunset, enhanced by large telescopes set up for free viewing. However, check the phase of the moon; if the moon is full, you will not be able to see any stars or planets, but only the moon, in the telescopes.
