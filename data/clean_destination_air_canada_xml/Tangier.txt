Tangier (طنجة) is an important port city in .

Understand

Tangier is a fascinating Moroccan city to visit. It has many of the things that travelers love--a sense of exotic mystery, interesting history, beautiful vistas, and unspoiled beaches. It's easy enough to navigate if you're used to Western cities, while being clearly different from those Western cities. 

An uncontrolled mix of north Africa, Spain, Portugal and France, Tangier is located in northern Morocco, and was under joint international control until 1956. The city is separated from Spain by the 20 miles of the Strait of Gibraltar. Frequent ferries make the short crossing from Europe each day, and many cruise ships sailing between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic often include Tangier as a port of call.

Get in
By ferry

Regarding the crossing: take the ferry from Tarifa Port. The first ferry departure from Tarifa, Spain, to Tangier is at 9:00 a.m. and every two hours thereafter; a round trip ticket costs about 57 euro. From Tangier, the latest FRS ferry back to Tarifa departs at 22:00 p.m. The ferry from Tarifa docks in Tanger-Ville Port, situated in the city close to the Medina. 

If you take the ferry from , you'll arrive at Tangier new port (Tanger-Med), situated about 40 km from Tangier (one hour each way from Tangier). There is a bus that costs 7d, and you'll have to walk out from the port to the main road until you come to a white unmarked stand, this is the bus stop. The taxi drivers might try to convince you that the bus isn't running for some reason, just ignore them. If you want to take a taxi you shouldn't pay more than 250d.

By plane

Tangier-Ibn Batouta Airport (TNG) is located 12 km (7.5 miles) from the city (travel time about 20 minutes). Taxi 100 Dh (10€) from Tangier, 150 Dh (15€) at night or from the airport to Tangier Ville (to train station: 120 Dh). At present Royal Air Maroc, easyJet, Ryanair, Iberia (Air Nostrum), Jetairfly, germanwings, Corendon Dutch Airlines, Transavia and Air Arabia Maroc fly here. All persons entering or leaving Morocco are required to complete an entry/exit card and non-residents are permitted to remain in Morocco for a total of 90 days. 

Coming in by plane is the easiest and hassle free way of coming to Tangier: there are no touts at the airport and the prices of the taxis are fixed by the government. Beware of long queues at passport controls before flights bound for the Schengen area.

In the arrival hall of ibn Battouta Airport, you will find 6 international car rental agencies and several ones in the parking of the airport (meet-and-greet service). You can rent a car directly, however, make sure to have a credit card for the deposit. If you do not have one, consider renting outside of the airport. To get better prices, consider booking a vehicle earlier. local sites like Tanger Airport Rental can be a good choice to compare quotes.

If you’re on a shoestring and need to get to the airport, take a grand taxi to Assilah (20Dh) or Gueznaia and exit when the road goes off to the airport (it's signposted). It’s only a short walk from there (1.8km). You can also catch a grand-taxi from Avenue Belgique which goes in the direction of the airport. Some taxis may go to the Grottes d'Hercule so you need to get off before they turn that way which is at Aswakas Salam Supermarket the fare is 5dh per seat. From there you can take another taxi in the direction of airport and just get off at the roundabout of the airport the fare is 3-5dh per seat and walk from there to the airport (20-30mins)

Coming from the airport, a grand taxi running into Tanger (10Dh) can be easily caught at the roundabout.

By rail

ONCF opened a new train station, Tanger Ville, in 2003, which is now the end of the line. While it's closer to the city center than Tanger Morora, the original end-of-the-line, it's still quite a long walk so take a petit taxi for 15dhs or so. A petit taxi ride to the Medina area costs 40 - 50 dhs. 

The country has an excellent railway system with 1,893km (1,176mi) of track and a fine intercity passenger service. For example, visitors flying into Morocco through Casablanca can travel by train (the station is connected to the airport's lower level) to Tangier which takes approx. 3 hours. Buying first-class tickets on the day is recommended (430 dhs) since your seat is guaranteed, and you can avoid the crowd rushing the gates. Your ticket will also specify the car number in addition to the seat number -- this is important since seat numbers are duplicated between train cars, and you do not want to be that tourist who proclaims that someone else has stolen your seat before checking whether you're in the right car. 

Overnight train services running throughout Europe can connect with Morocco. Most of the time, non stop trains are fine but those which are not direct sometimes make unscheduled stops en route but do not panic as you will reach your destination eventually.

There is a night-train leaving from Tangier to at 9:05PM costing 350 Dirhams for a couchette. There is a daily Train service to for 155 Dirhams for a first class fare (5 hour journey)

When travelling overnight by train, it is usually cheaper to buy a couchette ticket than a first class ticket.

Notice If you are taking the night train, and not using the sleeper cars, you will probably not get a good night sleep. This is due to the lights being on, movement of people in the train, and conductors checking you ticket numerous times. It is probably a good idea to travel with someone who'll present your tickets, put on eye covers and take a sleeping pill. If your finances permit, paying for a sleeper car (even a solo unit) is recommended.

By car or motorcycle
When coming into Tangier by car, be careful of hustlers on motorbikes who will ride alongside you and attempt all manner of dodginess. 

You can come by car by ferry from and in or through the Spanish exclave of Ceuta (reached by ferry from Algeciras and ports in Spain). The ferry crossing varies from 1 to 3 hours. Shortest and cheapest will be from Tarifa to/from Tangier taking around 60 min. Tarifa is probably the most laid-back option as far as ports are concerned. 

Coming by car or motorcycle can be a daunting process especially if you are new to Morocco. You have to complete a temporary import form for the customs ("Douane" in French). Sometimes this is done on the ferry (usually in the busy summer months) and at other times at arrival in Tangier. Like at the airport all persons entering Morocco also have to complete an entry/exit card. The Police and the Customs will both search your car - often not together so you need to be patient. 

In recent years, things have improved considerably for tourists and you are not likely to be bothered too much but you will have to go through all the formalities of bringing your car into Morocco like everyone else. You can only bring your car in for 6 months in any one year. You are not allowed to leave it in Morocco unless you are prepared to pay the tax for the car which can be up to three times the actual cost of the car. This applies even if your car breaks, but if your car is written off, you will need to notify the customs authorities to avoid paying tax on a car as an import. There are strict regulations on bringing a car. For example, customs will not allow someone else to the leave the country with a car entered under someone else's name. Exceptions applied for relatives.

Check with the car rental company before bringing a rented car into Morocco.

You must have "green card" insurance for your vehicle when driving/riding in Morocco. You can get this insurance from many companies in Europe, or in Morocco at the port in Tangiers. If you are stopped, you must show this insurance to the police. (Police have had a recent directive not to hassle tourists, so you may not be stopped at all, but still you'd better have the insurance in the unlikely event of an accident.) If you do not have insurance from your home country, then local insurance can be purchased at small insurance booths situated at the port. The insurance companies are reasonably reputable and will pay out if you have an accident. Note that this insurance policy has limitations and you are likely to have much more comprehensive cover from insurers from your own country. Most European insurers will cover Morocco and many include it under their standard level of European cover.

If you have problems with your motorcycle in Morocco, Peter at Bikers Home in Ouarzazate can help you get it back in working condition or by trailer to a ferry back to Europe.

By bus
Tangier has two long distance bus stations. The first, at the CTM offices near the port, is the arrival point of most CTM buses. Some other CTM buses, and those from other companies, arrive at the station on Place Jamia el-Arabia.

Private car
If you are coming to Tangier and you need private transfer from the port or from the airport,Tangier has many companies who provide private transfers to or from Tangier to all major Moroccan cities and airport, with private cars, vans with English speaking drivers. Once arrived to the Ibn Battouta Airport, you can rent a car locally from 6 agencies located in the Arrival Hall. Franchises like Budget, Avis, Hertz and Dollar are available from the platform Tanger Car Rental 
*JTT Morocco: BP5271 Tanger Dradeb Tangier 90040 morocco Tel: 00212.610.047.712 www.aaa.ma
* Tangier Taxi: 2 Route California, Tangier, Morocco. Private transfers to Chefchaouen, Asilah and others. More expensive than the public taxis but still well-priced.

By boat
The port is located beside the Medina, and a few hundred metres from the ville nouvelle. (Note that Port of Tangier, and Port of are different ports. Port of Tangier is normally served from Tarifa, Spain; and Tanger Med, the new commercial port, is served from Algeciras, Spain. Tanger Med is the French spelling, which is used in road signs and in GPS maps.) Although the government has been partially successful in reducing the number of touts, money changers, taxi drivers and faux guides hassling people arriving by boat, expect to be mobbed. Look like you know where you're going, politely refuse any offers of help or ignore the "the fake guides" completely, or if you really feel like you need to escape jump in a taxi to escape the throng; just make sure that the taxi driver is no worse than the mob you are trying to escape. The taxi rank is inside the port area - you are likely to be mobbed by requests from many drivers. There is no queuing system - just take the taxi which you have agreed a fare with and are comfortable with. The blue coloured petit taxis are substantially cheaper and used more by locals and are preferable to the cream coloured grande taxis who are mostly unmetered. The grande taxis generally also will still try and charge you more even if you have agreed price, be insistent and get all your change back. 

There are many fast hydrofoils daily on FRS Ferry Serice from Tarifa in Spain for about 37 Euros one way, or 67 Euros round-trip (as of November 2010). Several times a day there are also fast Balearia ferries from Algeciras, Spain to the new Port (25 miles from downtown Tangier) for 33 Euros one-way or 45 Euros round-trip (as of June 2019). Passengers should be aware that the boats often run slower than the advertised time (because they depart later than scheduled time or simply take longer to get across). So give yourself an ample time cushion (1 hour minimum) if you plan to catch another transportation after you get off the ferry. For example, one speed catamaran between Tangier and Tarifa advertises one hour travel time between Tanger and Algeciras on their brochure (35-minute boat travel between Tangier and Tarifa, then 15-minute bus travel from Tarifa to Algeciras), but in reality, this trip will take over 2 hours. Example: the boat frequently leave later (by 15-30 minutes) than the scheduled time, then once at Tarifa, the bus does not depart until everyone on the boat clears customs (which takes 30-45 minute), then the bus will take 20-25 minutes to travel from Tarifa to Algericas. 14:28, 28 June 2019 (EDT)

There're also connections with Genoa and Barcelona.

Get around
Walking is perhaps the best way to see the relatively compact Tangier. Petit taxis (blue in color) are common in general but during peak times (evenings) it can be impossible to find an unoccupied one. The Careem app (the Middle East's version of Uber) is available. 

Tangier is very easy to navigate around; the two main roads are Boulevard Mohamed V which runs from near the Medina through the ville nouvelle and Boulevard Mohamed VI (formerly Ave des FAR) which runs along from the beachfront from the port to Malabata. The Medina area is a complex array of alleyways some of which can only be accessed on foot, so if your hotel is located in these alleyways then it's a good idea to have the hotel arrange to meet you at the closest logical drop-off point for taxis. Some roads are quite steep so be prepared to walk uphill. 

Mohamed V has a whole range of clothes shops, pharmacies and cafes as well as Hotel Flandria, Hotel Rembrandt. Hotel Minzah lies just off this road. Mohamed VI runs along the beach front where you will find numerous hotels (Rif, Ramada, Sherezade, Solazure, Tariq, Movenpick,Hilton), bars, discos, restaurants and cafes. Most hostels are situated on the roads heading uphill near the port area.

Most locals in Tangier will be unfamiliar with what we call the "ville nouvelle". To help with agreeing fares and generally with navigating using taxis - the central main thoroughfare is simply known as the "Boulevard", the beach area as "Playa", the port as "Marsa", the medina as "souk barra", the hilly area to the west of Tangier with the Golf Course and Race Track as "California", the residential area heading towards the main road to Tetouan as "Idrissia", the thieves market as "Casa Barata".

See

Take a simple walk along the beach (Ave Mohamed VI) to enjoy what the city is famed for.

* The Kasbah

* The Tomb of Ibn Battouta, a famous 14th century traveller who was born in Tangier. Pay tribute to a fellow traveller.

*Teatro Cervantes, rue Salah Eddine et Ayoubi. Closed and falling to pieces but take a photo from outside the gates as you pass by on the way up to the Grand Socco.

* The Tangier American Legation Museum (TALM), a thriving cultural center, museum, conference center and library in the heart of the old medina in Tangier, is housed in the only historic landmark of the United States located abroad. The museum exhibits a large collection of art and historical items. It also has a Paul Bowles Wing dedicated to the writer and composer who lived most of his adult life in Tangier. 

*Musée d'Art Contemporain de la Ville de Tanger. Closed until further notice.

*The Kasbah Museum, the former Sultan's palace, deserves to be seen not only for its collection of artefacts from the Phoenician to modern times, but also for the building and garden. There is a small entry fee (20 Moroccan Dirham or about $2USD as of Jan 2018) and varying opening times winter and summer.

Do

*People watching on the Terrasse des Paresseux, boulevard Pasteur or on Sunday along the beachfront Avenue Mohammed VI.
*Drink a mint tea at the Café Hafa and enjoy the view of the ocean. Toilets here are in extremely poor condition so plan accordingly.
*Mnar Park aquatic park with a tremendous view of the coast. Open in 2005 it costs 5€ for children and 10€ Adults has aqua slides, karting circuits, café, romantic restaurant. (Excellent pancakes!).
*Get happily lost in the medina, which is most active in evening and night.
*Visit the American Legation Museum in the walled city. (Morocco was the first country to recognize the United States, in December 1777 with the hope of promoting commerce with the new republic. This act by the Moroccan sultan was the first public recognition of the U.S. by a head of state.)
*Go to the souk on Thursday or Sunday mornings to see the Jbala mountain women in their colorful costumes selling their produce and dairy products all along the wall of the St. Andrew's Church(English Church).
* Visit Casa Barata. You can take a shared grand taxi from the staion just next to English Church. It's just 5 minutes ride by taxi and the fare is 3 Dhs each person. It's a vast market which sells literally everything. You never know what you'll discover there.
* Visit "Cap Spartel". Located at the virtual junction between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic Ocean, this lighthouse offers nice views of the surrounding. There's an entrance fee to get to the lighthouse. Most people take gigantic two stories tour busses to get there or rent a petit or grand taxi. For backpackers, an Alsa city bus (Line 5) from Place du Koweït going to Mediyouna can bring you near the cap (4km). From there, it's a nice walk through the park to reach the cap. The bus runs every hour or so and costs 3.5 dirahm (2022). Walk back through Sloquea for additional vistas on the way back. 

* Visit Hercules Cave (Grottes d'Hercules). The small caves of Hercules, located just 14kms west of Tangiers, are a place of stunning natural beauty and archeological significance. Apparently, this is where the mythical figure, Hercules, used to rest after finishing his 12 labours. The cave also bears a mirror image resemblance to the continent of Africa. Get there by private taxi costing about 160-200 dirham and takes about 15 minutes. Or take a grand-taxi for 10Dh from Avenue Belgique. It costs 60 dirham (2022) to get into the cave, do not bother with a tour guide. The cave is within a kilometer of a beautiful sandy beach (Plage Achkar), great for sunbathing or swimming. Buy bread and fruit before you leave, pack a picnic, and make a day of it.
*Trip Boat is a company that proposes boat trips from the port of Tangier, half day or full day, as well as fishing trips aboard an italian boat propelled by its two engines 200CV each.

Buy
Most brasswork is made in other towns but is available here. Leather goods are also available. Stay away from the tourist traps and you may find the price quite agreeable. There is an infamous market in Tangier called "casa barata" (the house of cheap things) - there are bargains to be had here but be wary of forgeries and stolen goods (these are sold alongside vegetables, electronics, clothing, shoes, spices, carpets, ironmongery and everything else one can think of!). There are other markets notably the souk in the medina (mainly vegetables, clothes and tourist items) and in Ben Mekada (vegetables). The latter does not cater for tourists at all and is known as one of the "rough spots" of Tangier and back in the 1980's there were bread riots here.

Colorful leather slippers with pointed toes are great gifts to take home. Cheap ones cost about 60DH a pair. Good ones should be still below 200DH. If you can bargain, especially with some Arabic, you can get the same shoes for 100DH - a typical price for a Moroccan customer. Mens and womens clothing can be had for reasonable prices too, in the medina.

Eat

There are many choices of different cuisine available. Many of the luxury hotels offer a good selection of both Moroccan and Continental Fare, though at prices much higher than what you will find elsewhere. There are also many restaurants along the Ave Mohamed VI (the beachfront) where one can enjoy a nice meal with a glass of wine on the beachfront.

In the evening, go to the plaza next to CTM bus station. There are several cafes and restaurants facing the plaza. The price and services are good because of the keen competition. Just wandering around in the medina will bring you across numerous Moroccan restaurants offering similar dishes, quality, and prices (main dish around 7 dollars), so you can basically just choose one at random and probably be satisfied.

There is also some fresh off-the-boat seafood restaurants for locals in the port. If you speak some French/Arabic and have a sense of adventure it's highly recommended. After the port entrance, keep to the water side for a couple of minutes then go down the street with the bank on the corner. It's then along the docks towards the farthest point out behind the row of white warehouses. All outdoor basic seating outdoor seating and be prepared to be the only foreigner! No menus or prices but it's amazingly cheap and authentic. Huge platter of prawns, calamari and enough fish to feed a small army.

Some of the popular restaurants and places to eat in Tangier are as follows:
*Vandalusia - located around the corner of Dar Tangier Medina ( rue gzenaya 7), the most inviting classic restaurant in Tangier! Great food and the people in the place will make you feel like at home. Classic tagines at great prices. Both locals and tourists eat here and it is great. 

* Cafe Restaurant El Teatro - located near teatro cervantes at rue salah eddine al ayoubi 108, a wonderfully decorated place with the best value for money food and drinks.
* Cafe A L'Anglaise ( International Organic cuisine ) - located in the heart of the Kasbah, excellent cuisine

Street Food

You may quickly bore of tagines and street food is a great option for snacking throughout the day. Fresh orange juice costs about 5D; sandwiches of egg, peppers, and sauce are about 10D. Yogurt mixtures can be particularly creative, such as avocado and almonds, or fruit mixtures. Tiny stalls in the souk sell cooked vegetables like eggplant, with rice, and other tasty treats and a meal there can cost 10D or so. In the early evening you may find squares of chickpea cakes sprinkled with salt and paprika.

Breakfast
In the morning a "locals" cafe will give you a cafe au lait for 5D. (Cafes where tourists congregate will charge you 10D.) Usually there is a bread vendor at the cafe (by the port or the madina) who will serve you bread with cheese and honey for another 5D. It's perfectly okay to buy your bread/breakfast elsewhere and eat it outside at the cafe. If the bread guy is next to the cafe the waiter will often collect.

Vegetarians
* Cafe A L'Anglaise: This charming sidewalk café is reminiscent of dining at a friend’s home. The owner gives each customer special attention by greeting them personally before preparing their meal. She also happens to be an interior designer, so the atmosphere inside is very welcoming and pleasing to the eye. Some walls act as a gallery, and feature art from local Moroccan artists. Enjoy fresh juices, crispy, flavorful chicken dishes, and traditional couscous.
Price: Low
Opening Hours: 10:00am-10:30pm Thursday-Tuesday
Vegetarians will find plenty to eat in Tangier and Morocco in general, but vegetarian tagines can become boring after a couple of days and often contain lamb stock. Street food is a lot more creative and fun. If you've brought a camping stove, shop at the souk and make your own. Or you can opt for Pizza, Japanese, Chinese or Indian all of which are available in Tangier.

Drink
There are many places in Tangier to drink - people have their own favourite haunts. Much depends on the current owner who tends to give the place a certain ambiance. Favorite bars/discos with foreign (and local) clientele include Casa Pepe, Sable D'or, Morocco Palace, Marco Polo (popular with truck drivers) and hotel bars such as Ramada and El Minzah.

You could opt for a coffee instead - there are no shortage of cafes; some of which are the best in the country. Some have amazing views (cafe Hafa), some good coffee, some are popular (cafe Tropicana, cafe Celine Dion), some with music (cafe in the Dawliz complex), some have good cakes (cafe Oslo), some are places to relax after a hard day shopping (cafe Madam Porte, cafe Vienna), and some are just plain sleazy - the choice is yours.

Fresh fruit juices are sold by street vendors during the summer months. The cafes also serve fresh juices and often have what is called a panache - a mix of fruit juices often with milk, apple and almond - try it - its delicious.
*Nice view on the Straits of Gibraltar. Drink tea while looking at boats passing by. Hard to find but worth it. Toilets are in extremely poor condition so plan accordingly.

Sleep

Budget
There are an enormous number of small hotels and hostels in or near the medina. (50 - 300 Dh)

* Hotel El Widad Right in the Petit Zoco and near the big Mosque. Free Wifi, hot shared showers, clean. Rooms starting at 60Dh. Rue Sekka n20

* Pension Touahins Decent little hotel with wifi and shared bathrooms. Single 70-100Dh and Double 140Dh. It is right at the edge of the old medina on the south west side (just in from Grand Socco/Place du 9 Avril), address 7 Rue Touahin.

Worth every penny. The hotel says this is a 50% discount for winter season, they will not barter. Computer with internet available for guests, everything is clean and looks pretty much safe. It is in the medina just next to the mosque - find the small square close to the port (Place Petit Socco), face the mosque and take the route that is "forward right" (Rue des Postes), you will see the sign with hotel name overhead.

* Rue Sahab Eddine El Ayoubi. Packed with them: Valencia, Madrid, Miami, Detroit, Atou and others.

* In the medina go near the Zoco Chico, there are the Becerra, Fuentes and a whole lot more. Try also the street which starts on the stairs of the La Gitana restaurant, on the port entrance to the medina, and the area around the Petit Socco just in the center of the Medina.

* There are also a lot of small hotels at the port, which is walking distance to both the medina and the new city. To find these little hotels you exit the port of Tangiers and in about 100 meters you'll see the Hotel Biarritz (white with hand-lettering in blue). Turn right up the rutted, dirty little alleyway next to it (yes, this is a street) and wind your way uphill to find several small hotels off the main drag on the unmarked Avenue Magellan. 

* Magellan Hotel is one of the hotels here, quiet and very basic, hot showers, has a garage for your car or motorcycle, and costs 150D/night w/20D for parking. Front rooms 2nd floor have Bay of Tangiers view and cooling breeze.

Mid-range
* Hotel Continental, 36 Rue Dar El Baroud, Tel: 039 93 10 24. This hotel, situated in the medina and within easy reach of the port, is very much in the 'former glory' category, with past guests including Degas, Churchill, Kerouac and friends. Definitely spend extra for a nicer room if given the opportunity, it is not a lot extra and the best rooms were absolutely palatial. Get one facing the port if you can. It has a really nice terrace out front where you can enjoy mint tea with spectacular views of the harbour. Make sure not to confuse it with the Intercontinental which is a more modern hotel and not as central. The price of 365-420 dirhams for a double translates to around €33-38.

* Hotel Sherezade, Ave des FAR - next to Ramada. On the beachfront, clean and comfortable, cheap and cheerful (30-35€)

* Hotel Solazure, Ave des FAR. On the beachfront but caters mostly to package tourists. Poor service and not particularly clean or cheap. About 50-60€

* Kasba Blanca, next to the Kasbah Rose. This guesthouse was established in 2021 and the staff are excellent. The interior, though small, is stunningly beautiful, cozy, and clean. Even the bathroom faucets are works of art. There are small touches of thoughtfulness throughout the common areas: a low seat next to a small window, blankets on the rooftop seats for chilly nights, etc. The winding stairs and transparent parts of floors are charming, but ladies with dresses should be mindful of them. No air-conditioning but in the summertime fans are provided next to each bed which makes it bearable. Breakfast is on the roof and is very, very good. Approx. 700 dhs per night. Airport transfers are 200 dhs and are available upon request. 

* Dar Jameel, No.6 rue Mohammed Bergach, Dar El Baroud, Tel: 00-212-61092780. This new guesthouse/ boutique hotel is a stone's throw from the Hotel Continental and needs to be seen. A former restaurant and gallery, the house has been amazingly restored with typical Moroccan style. The view from the large terrace and penthouse is 360 degrees, taking in the medina, the bay of Tangier, Gibraltar and Spain. The 8 rooms/suites vary in price from 45 euros to 120 euros a night.

* Hotel Marco Polo, on the corner of Ave. d'Espangne and Rue Marco Polo. Clean, modern and decent sized rooms with air conditioning and satellite television. A double room will set you back around 600 DH although this can be negotiated down to 450 DH. The reception will let you use the spare computer for internet access free of charge. Breakfast is sadly not included.

Stay safe
Tangier is not the safest destination to travel to in Morrocco. Some troubles include theft, which can range in severity of danger. This is due to the techniques of the thieves who ride motorbikes in the country and aim their targets at unsuspecting tourists. The thieves are reckless in Tangier and are willing to run you over for your priced goods so be very careful. Another trouble you may encounter is the persistent touts whom you should ignore, or the con-men ready to overcharge you. You will encounter these characters mostly in and around the medina and along the beach front promenade. Some touts are obvious while others may present themselves as friendly locals. The latter, referred to sometimes as 'false guides', will quickly begin to you give you a tour of the town and accompany you for as long as they can, then ask you for money. The longer they accompany you, the more aggressive they can seem if you do not want to pay them for their time. 

Generally, tourists have every opportunity to firmly and clearly decline these touts straight away. Ceasing to engage and ignoring the touts is also highly effective, and can be done in a way that is polite. 'La Shukran' means 'No Thank You' and when said as if you mean it, is very effective in reclaiming your space.

Dressing like a local - as opposed to white shorts, shoes, and a backpack - will help you blend in and get good reception from merchants, who will often quote you actual prices instead of inflated tourist prices. Tangier is considered one of the more moderate cities of Morocco and it is quite normal and acceptable to see foreign women without head coverings. It is not usual, however, to see foreign women wearing revealing clothes in Tangier.

If you are lost in the medina, you can easily find your way out by going uphill (souk/English church/Nouvelle Village) or down (port). Kids and young men may ask you for money to lead you out (a dirham or two), or to the Cafe Central, but if you are asked if you are lost and do not want help, say "Yes, but happily," and usually that gets a laugh and solitude.

Tangier is a safe place for solo women travelers. Common sense is advised and personal safety precautions you would usually take anywhere apply in Tangiers too.

* Left luggage: Many visitors are only in Tangier for a day before taking a night train or ferry and face the problem of leaving luggage somewhere. Due to increased security the ONCF station Tangier Ville will not take left luggage. The CTM bus station will but only if you have a CTM ticket out.

Get out
You can buy train, bus and ferry tickets at the stations and ports listed above, although you may find it easier to purchase ferry tickets from travel agents rather than face the gauntlet of touts at the port. If you plan on leaving by ferry, it is important to note that the ferries to Algeciras often do not follow a set schedule, and departure times can change even within a day of having purchased tickets. One alternative is to take a fast ferry to Tarifa, because these are more likely to run on time and at least one of the companies provides a free bus to the port at Algeciras. You can also flag grand taxis at the major bus stations and ferry port.

The stunning 'Blue City' of is a 2h car ride away and is a good day trip from Tangier. 

If the South Atlantic region of Morocco (e.g. Agadir) is next on your itinerary, a 1h domestic flight from TNG is recommended. The alternative would be to take a train which only goes as south as Marrakech, and then transfer to a bus the rest of the way.
