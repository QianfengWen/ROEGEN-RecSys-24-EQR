The capital of Portugal, Lisbon (: Lisboa) has experienced a renaissance in recent years, with a contemporary culture that is alive and thriving and making its mark in today's Europe. Perched on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean, Lisbon is one of the rare Western European cities that faces the ocean and uses water as an element that defines the city. Lisbon enchants travelers with its white-bleached limestone buildings, intimate alleyways, and an easy-going charm that makes it a popular year-round destination.

Understand 

Like , , , , , , , , , , and , Lisbon is built on seven hills.

The sparkling new Lisboa Ask Me Centre (Pç. do Comércio, ☎ +351 21 031-2815, open daily 09:00-20:00) will help you find accommodation and the staff are happy to dispense advice, maps and brochures. Smaller Ask Me Lisboa kiosks are dotted about the Rossio district and airport and their multilingual staff also have maps and brochures.

The Lisboa Card, which can be purchased from tourist information outlets, offers free use of all public transport in the city and free or reduced price tickets to many museums, galleries and tourist attractions. They can be purchased in 24-hour adult €18.50, 48 hour €31.50 and 72 hour €39 denominations (prices as of June 2014). They are not a very good value unless you plan to visit a lot of museums. Especially if you are a holder of a student identification card (international or national) since the student discounts to these attractions are often the same as for the Lisboa Card.

Climate
Lisbon enjoys a warm climate with mild winters and very warm summers. Strongly influenced by the Gulf Stream, it is one of the mildest climates in Europe. Among all the metropolises in Europe, here are the warmest winters on the continent, with average temperatures around 15°C (59°F) during the day and 9°C (48°F) at night in the period from December to February. Snow and frost are very rare. The typical summer season lasts about six months, from May to October, with an average temperature of 25°C (77°F) during the day and 16°C (61°F) at night. Although, sometimes in November, March, and April there are temperatures above 20°C (68.0°F) with an average temperature of 18.5°C (65°F) during the day and 11.2°C (52.2°F) at night. Rain occurs mainly in winter and the summer is very dry.

Lisbon is very close to the ocean, which brings windy and fast-changing weather, so you'd better bring extra outerwear or an umbrella with you, at least in winter, spring and autumn.

Orientation
The city stretches along the northern bank of the river Tejo as it flows into the Atlantic Ocean. As the terrain rises north away from the water, steep streets and stairways form the old tangled districts or give way to green parks in the western suburbs. 

In the city centre, the vast Praça do Comércio, facing the river at the base of the pedestrianized grid of Baixa (lower town), occupies a central position. Further northwest from Baixa stretches Lisbon's "Main Street", Avenida da Liberdade, a broad boulevard resplendent in leafy trees, chic hotels and upmarket shops, terminating at the circular Praça de Marques de Pombal. To the east are old districts of Mouraria and Alfama, both relatively spared during the Great Earthquake (as they are on a firmer rock) and therefore both retaining the charm of the winding alleys and azulejo-covered crumbling walls (further north lie relatively boring residential quarters). To the west, the hill rises steeply into Bairro Alto (upper town; prepare to trek up, or take one of the elevadores, or funiculars); still further west are the rapidly gentrifying former docks of Alcantara, dominated on the western end by the supports of the gigantic new bridge over the river, and the suburbs of Santo Amaro and Belém.

Get in 

By plane 
Portugal's largest international airport is the Aeroporto da Portela () located between Loures and Lisboa. ☎ +351 21 841-3000, Fax: +351 21 841-3675

It is the main air hub for TAP Portugal, a Star Alliance member airline that covers an extensive network throughout Europe, Africa (Morocco, Algeria, Senegal, Guinea Bissau, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Angola, Cape Verde, S. Tome e Principe) and the Americas (US, Canada (starting June 2017), Venezuela and Brazil). SATA (Air A&ccedil;ores) provides regular service to eastern North America (Boston, Montreal and Toronto).

There are also several other airlines flying into Lisbon, such as United Airlines, American Airlines, Emirates, Easyjet, British Airways, Brussels Airlines, Aigle Azur, Air France, Air Transat, German Wings, TAAG Angolan Airways, STP Airways, Swiss, Transavia, Turkish Airlines, Lufthansa, Finnair, Iberia, Vueling and KLM, amongst others.

Getting from/to the airport
In general, if you are arriving by plane in Lisbon and it is still day time, it is almost always better to use public transport - buses or the metro system - to your hotel or final destination. The airport information desk at Lisbon airport can provide you with all the required information. Taxi drivers at the taxi stand at Lisbon are infamous for their dishonesty and unreliability and if they can rip you off, they will. If you do not speak Portuguese or if you don't know the shortest way to your destination, avoid using a taxi unless there is no other option. If your final destination is less than 1 mile from the airport, taxi drivers will refuse to take you although they are not allowed to refuse destinations. If you are not carrying too much luggage and it is not late in the night, you are better off simply getting a bus or the metro to the city center.

* Metro costs about €1.90 from the airport to any place in the city centre. The daily pass costs €6.40 (plus €0.50 for the reusable card) and is valid for 24 hours after the first activation, good on all public transportation (metro, bus, and tram). The daily pass cannot be used for the commuter ferry and the bus from Cacilhas to Cristo Rei. Lisbon Airport metro station is the final destination of the Red Line (Linha Vermelha from São Sebastião to Aeroporto). The journey to Saldanha takes about 16 minutes and less than 25 minutes are enough to get from the Airport to Baixa-Chiado (Lisbon city centre). You should avoid riding the metro late at night (after 22:00 some stations are occasionally targeted by groups of muggers looking out for unsuspecting tourists), but in general, the Metro system in Lisbon is very reliable and safe and is usually the best way to quickly get around the city.

* Bus lines 705, 722, 744, 745 or night bus line 208. Bus 744 takes you to the Oriente railway station in about 10 minutes, where you can change for the metro and continue to the city centre. The board fare is €1.75. Viva Viagem transport card (see ) can be used which can be bought at the airport post office. The bus service is moderately reliable - the buses are modern and in good condition, but during rush hours you should expect delays. Note that you are not allowed to take large pieces of luggage on these buses.

* Ridesharing services such as Uber, Cabify, Bolt and Kapten are also available at the airport. The ride will cost approximately 8€ to the city centre. The pickup point is outside in the Terminal 1 departures passenger drop off area. Book your ride after you find the pick up area as drivers can only remain in that spot for 10 minutes before they get charged. Cars that provide these services are licensed with the Portuguese authorities and carry a white "TVDE" badge on the rear windshield.

* Carsharing services such as DriveNow and Emov, which can be booked on the spot via their respective apps, allow you to rent a car for a few hours or minutes and park it anywhere inside the respective service areas, which include most of the city. These cars can be found on the 112/113 car park near the TRYP hotel.

* Taxis cost about €10.00 from the airport to the city centre. Caution is required since Lisbon taxi drivers are notoriously dishonest, rude and unprofessional - in general, you should avoid taxis at the airport unless you are in a hurry or have too much luggage to carry around. The charge is according to the meter, adding €1.20 per item of luggage. Taxis are required to have working meters (it is illegal to drive without one) and fares posted to the window in the rear seat. Be sure to ask the taxi driver if he has a working meter before getting into the taxi, and be careful of drivers trying to grab your luggage and usher you into the taxi before you can make these inquiries. As with many cities, watch out for dishonesty and if you think you are being charged significantly more (paying €45 to get into the city but only €6 back to the airport is not unheard of, as are claims of broken meters or fixed fares) ask for the driver's name, registration number and a receipt, take note of the car's license plate and make it clear you plan to complain. 

:Any policeman should take care of the situation if there are signs of fraud - if police officers are nearby, you should call them immediately. Lisbon people, in general, also hate dishonest taxi drivers, so you might also have a chance of a local citizen helping you out in case of a conflict. To avoid fraud, you can buy a taxi-voucher at the airport (€18 - a lot more than the average real meter price) which is good to go anywhere in the centre, with luggage. 
:Make sure to ask the driver how much he estimates the fare will be before getting in the taxi, which will diminish the chance for a surprise bounce in the price. If you want to take a taxi, go to the Departures area where it is more likely to get an honest driver - never catch a taxi in the Arrivals area! Make sure the driver starts the meter only when the journey starts.

By train 
There are two main stations, Santa Apolónia in the city centre and the Gare do Oriente, a bit further out and used by the high-speed trains. However, if you are entering Lisbon from the south, you may want to get off at the smaller stations of Entrecampos or Sete Rios. Their metro stations are a few stops closer to the central and old town. Also, local trains connecting with the resort on the Estoril coast use Cais do Sodré station. Train tickets may be booked directly with the train company, Comboios de Portugal 

Two international services are avalible, the overnight Sud Express leaves on the border between Spain and France every day at 18:20 hours. There is no physical connection with the TGV train from which only goes to Hendaya at the French border. The train calls at Oriente station 07:22AM the next morning before arriving in Apolónia just ten minutes later. There is also a daily sleeper train from named Lusitania leaving Chamartin station at 10:25PM, arriving early next morning 7:30AM in Oriente and a few minutes later at Apolónia. Prices starts at €90 for a single-journey in Turista-class.

The domestic high-speed line Alfa Pendular connects , and with Lisbon from the north and from the south. Prices between the major cities starts at €40 in second class. All trains call at Oriente, only some in Apolonia.

By car

Lisbon can be accessed from six main highways. Coming from the south (A2) or east (A6 - the main route from Madrid), there are the two bridges:

From/to south: The A2 goes all the way to the 25 de Abril bridge, which usually has lots of traffic getting into Lisbon, especially on weekday mornings. This is the best option if you want to go to the center of Lisbon or to the west (A5 - , , ). 

To north / to east: If you branch from the A2 into the A12, you'll get to the Vasco da Gama bridge, the longest bridge in Europe, it usually has less traffic than the older 25 de Abril bridge (but a more expensive toll). This is the best option to go to the eastern/northern section of Lisbon (to the airport and to the Parque das Nações - the former Expo 98 site), and also to take the A1 or A8 going north.

From/to north and the airport: Coming from the north, there is the A1, that connects Lisbon to , , , , , . The A1 ends near the airport. There's also the A8, which goes to Torres Vedras, Caldas da Rainha, Alcobaça, Leiria.

From the west, there is the A5, which connects to , , and the IC19 that crosses all the suburbs and ends near Sintra.

Lisbon has three ring roads: The 2ª circular, which connects the A1 to the IC19; the CRIL IC17 (still incomplete), which connects the Vasco da Gama bridge with the A1 and A8; and the CREL A9, which connects the A1 with the A8, IC19, A5, and goes all the way to the Estoril coast.

By bus
All nearby cities and most major cities in Portugal have direct buses to Lisbon. The main bus terminal is at Sete Rios (metro: Jardim Zoológico).
The main operator for long-course buses is Rede Nacional de Expressos 

if you want to go around the city in a easy way you can use the bus of Carris 

By boat
You can get a boat to Lisbon from the following stations: Barreiro; Trafaria; Montijo; and Cacilhas. It's an excellent sightseeing opportunity crossing the river Tagus to Lisbon.

Many cruise ships dock at several places along the river on the Lisbon side, with variably good access to public transport throughout the city. Many lines offer shuttles to key points nearby. 

By bicycle
From airport: Due to the relative proximity of Lisbon's airport to the city center, it is quite easy to cycle from the airport to the center, and could be recommended if you arrive for a cycling trip.

After leaving the airport and negotiating a roundabout, merge onto the long and straight dual-carriageway Av. Almirante Gago Coutinho (you should be able just to follow the "Centro" ("Downtown") signs.) After merging, the route to Baixa is simple and straight. This street later turns into Av. Almirante Reis, and then Rua de Palma, at the end of which you will be right in Baixa.

Cycling outside Lisbon can be a challenge, as Lisbon offers far easier cycling than what you may find outside of the city. The further you get from Lisbon however, the easier the cycling gets. You may wish to take advantage of certain regional trains that take bicycles in a separate luggage carriage, allowing you to start your cycling some 50 or 100km outside of the city.

Get around

Metro and Buses
 

Lisbon has a very efficient public transport network that covers the entire city in addition to the surrounding areas.
Lisbon's recently refurbished metro system is clean, quick, and efficient. While metro announcements are made only in Portuguese, signs, and ticketing machines are generally bilingual in Portuguese and English.

The extensive bus and electrico (tram) network is run by Carris. 

The best and, in many cases, the sole way to pay for city transport is buying a rechargeable green-coloured card 7 Colinas (Viva Viagem). It's valid for metro, trams (electrico), urban trains, most buses and ferries. 

The exception is buses not run by Carris&mdash; other bus companies have their own tickets. The card itself can be purchased for €0.50 (this price doesn't include any trips&mdash; add as many trips as you want) and remains valid for a year.

The Viva Viagem card can be charged in three different modes. You choose the mode when you charge the card. For example, you can choose the "single ticket" mode, and put €1.40 on a card (the machine will give change), and ride the tram to your hotel. Next day you wake up, and put €6.15 on the same card and choose the Day pass mode, making your card "Day pass" now. (Be aware that by using the CP (green colored) terminals the day pass ticket is ONLY valid for the trains - which costs 6€; for the Metro/Tram/Busses look for a Carris terminal: here a day pass costs 6.15€) The modes are as follows:
*Single tickets for the bus (€1.50; €2 if bought on the bus) or metro (€1.50). You put this exact amount on this card. Unlike Zapping mode, this ticket allows free transfers within one hour.
* Day pass for metro and buses (€6.40), valid 24 hours from the time of first use.
* Zapping. This is a 'stored value' mode, similar to the Oyster card in London. The rates are also cheaper comparing to single ride: every journey costs €1.34, but the transfers are not free - although you get a small discount for two contiguous journeys, e.g., if you change from metro to bus. If you have a bit of unused money, it is wise to go to the ticket desk and there they do zapping for any amount. This way you can fully utilize your money on the card before going back to your country. You won't be able to get a refund, so make sure you don't put away more than you intend to spend.

There are ticketing machines located at the train or metro stations, which also provide instructions in English. You can also buy the ticket from the driver or machines on board (the latter only available in some new trams). Tickets purchased from a driver will not include a Viva Viagem card and will cost more (€1.80 for bus and €2.85 for trams instead of €1.34 if you use the rechargeable card), so it makes more sense to buy the ticket before starting the trip. 

When using suburban trains, your tickets are charged onto the same kind of Viva Viagem cards. You cannot have more than one kind of ticket on one card, however, so you will probably need at least two of them, one for zapping (regular bus and metro use), one for suburban travel. The TransTejo (TT) ferries can make you buy yet another "Via Viagem" card with the white stripe in the bottom, claiming that CP or Carris "Via Viagem" cards are not valid for them.

If you plan to be in Lisbon for an extended time (1 week and more), you can purchase an unlimited pass that covers buses, metro, and funiculars at the Carris station in Santo Amaro, or at the Metro stations Alameda, Marques do Pombal and Campo Grande. It's €12 for the Lisboa Viva card, plus €29 for a one-month unlimited pass. Bring a photo ID (passport) and cash.

By bicycle 
Cycling within the city is now much easier because of the work the municipality has been putting in with bike lanes, slowing car traffic, changing car traffic patterns and adding speed bumps, etc, but of course, parts of the town will always be part of the surprisingly hilly outlet of Lisbon. If you plan to cycle these, some of these streets do have tram lines, potholes and an absence of designated bicycle lanes, so visitors wishing to venture into city traffic by bicycle should be used to urban riding. Riding on the footpath is not recommended. It is advisable to get advice at local bike shops.

Although better than in recent years there are still bike lanes in town the newest, nice and safe stretches from Baixa to Belem along the beautiful river Tejo water front aptly known as the Poetry Bike Lane

These days car drivers are often weekend cyclists and way more careful with cyclists, more than ever before. 
Good spots for anyone to cycle safe are along the flat river-front area stretching from Parque das Nacoes, to the central area of Cais Sodre, where you can rent bikes look below for bike Iberia, and particularly from here to Belem. 
Must do for all travellers or cycling enthusiasts: A scenic and safe bike ride on bike lane from Baixa along waterfront to the historical area of Descobertas-Belem-Jerónimos.

Just outside of Lisbon - you can travel with a bike on trains or ferries - along the coast from Estoril towards the beautiful beach of Guincho, reach , or . Although there are some bikes for free use in Cascais they often in poor condition and are limited offer. If travelling from Lisbon (and back) you should consider renting a bike before going as there are no restrictions, nor additional charges, on travelling with bicycles on commuting trains.

If you take a bicycle on public transport beware of the following:
* Metro: During working days you are allowed to carry bicycles in the metro only after 20:00. On weekends, it's allowed and it's free of charge.
* Commuting trains: You are allowed to carry bicycles in the trains for free, everyday of the week just be reasonable and avoid rush hour passenger patterns.
* Ferries: Bicycles travel for free, you are allowed but there are strict limitations on the number of bikes allowed depending on ferry lines and ferry boat type, arrive early and you shall avoid disappointment.
* Bike Buses: There are 6 lines of the public bus company "Carris" in which you can put your bike inside. Up to 4 bicycles per bus can be carried. 

Bike shops in Lisbon town centre are rare. You can find a SportZone near Rossio or in major shopping malls. Ask there for specialist shops, shop assistants are usually very helpful.

For guided bike the sights in Lisbon, Sintra, Arrabida or Cascais, and bike rentals, you can always check out Bike Iberia ☎ +351 96 963 0369, located in Baixa-downtown, next to Cais Sodre and the Praca Comercio square; they are professional, friendly and very helpful on providing Lisbon Bike Tours, bike rentals with delivery to your hotel doorstep, touring equipment, mountain biking gear, very family friendly and native insider's knowledge.

By scooter, moped or motorbike
Riding a scooter is always a great and affordable way to get around Lisbon, one of the "must do" things. You may also venture into beaches, riding around Caparica, Cascais, Sintra or Cabo da Roca. Also, the only way to cross over the bridges in Lisbon on two wheels.

Quality scooters are available for rent at affordable prices (you need to be at least 18, have your passport and a valid driving license). Riding around is generally safe, relaxed and lots of fun!

Companies operating in Lisbon include Scooter Lisbon ☎ +351 96 963 0369) located in Lisbon's city centre right off the train station of Cais Sodre (end of the line from Cascais train station) on Largo Corpo Santo, 5. They're open Monday to Sunday from 09:30 am offering quality 125cc vehicles with automatic transmission. Check with them for Scooter Guided Tours or Rentals from only a few hours to multi-day rentals.

By car 
Think twice before using a car in the city unless you are prepared to spend hours in traffic jams and looking for parking space. The busy traffic and narrow streets with blind corners can be overwhelming to tourists. Also, due to lack of space and overcrowding, parking is difficult and annoying, as well as potentially dangerous - check the "Stay Safe" section below, regarding potential problems with criminals and homeless people who stand near parking spaces to "help" you park your car and then attempt to extort money from you.

If you choose to return a hire car near your hotel, don't rely that the agent comes exactly at the agreed-upon time: for an agreed 12:00 return he can easily arrive at 09:00 (and will come again upon your call).

By walking 
If your accommodation is in the centre of the city, walking is a great alternative. Many of the attractions of the city, such as the Castelo and the Alfama and Bairro Alto districts, are within easy walking distance of the Baixa.

If you become lost or cannot find the location you are looking for, try to locate the nearest Carris bus or tram stop. Most of these stops (not all) have a very good map of the city with your current location clearly marked on the map. All the prominent tourist sites in Lisbon are also shown along with an index at the bottom of the map. A quick consultation with one of these Carris maps should point you back in the right direction.

You may also use the . Day passes for public transportation are also valid for those.

By ferry 
Ferries connect Lisbon to the suburbs across the Tejo river in the south. Taking a ferry to Cacilhas is a good opportunity to see Lisbon from the water. A ferry is paid for just like a metro trip; you can even use your zapping (using this system will give you a €0.05 to €0.10 discount on the single ticket) Viva viagem card.
The ferry boat takes you to (the journey takes 10 minutes) or () (€1.15), (€2.30), (€2.6) or (this journey takes half an hour) (€2.25).
The boats are operated by Transtejo.

Talk
As with the rest of Portugal, is the main language in Lisbon. However, almost all younger people know enough English for basic communication, and it is possible to get by speaking only English. 

Because of its linguistic connections to Portuguese, is widely understood, though few are fluent in it, and many locals will respond more readily to English than to Spanish. It is even more prefered to speak English to Spanish due to Spain bordering Portugal. It is also common for older people (above 50 years of age) to have some knowledge of . Nevertheless, any attempt to speak Portuguese is always appreciated, and even simple things like basic greetings will often draw smiles and encouragement from locals.

See 
*Similar to the Christ statue in Rio de Janeiro, this statue stands over 100 meters tall on the opposite bank of the Tejo River from downtown Lisbon. Views from the top of the statue are breathtaking, although the elevator up will cost you €5. 

Speciality transport

*Instead of paying for a ride on one of the costly tourist trams, try Tram 28. Tram (or "Eléctrico" in the Portuguese) Line 28 is one of only three traditional tram lines that still operate in Lisbon. These trams, which until the late-1980's ran all through-out Lisbon, were manufactured between 1936 and 1947. Tram 28 winds its way through the "Old Town" of Lisbon (dating from the 17th century) beginning in Graça then down to the Alfama and to the Baixa then up through Chiado to Bairro Alto and then down to Campo Ourique, taking you by many of Lisbon's most famous and interesting sites including monuments, churches and gardens. The trip is hilly, noisy and hectic but it affords many beautiful glimpses of the city. And, although the tram can sometimes be overrun with tourists, you will definitely get a flavour of the locals, as many "Lisboetas" commute daily on these historical trams. Tickets cost €1.05 if paid by "Viva Viagem" card and €2.85 if purchased on-board or at a vending machine (note that these machines do not accept notes, and are sometime even out of change, so make sure you have the correct change!). From start to finish the ride takes around 30 minutes. Beware of pickpockets!

Funiculars
*Inaugurated on 24 October 1885, this funicular was the second to be placed in Lisbon. It is the most visited one in the city. In 2002 it was classified as a National Monument.

*This funicular was inaugurated on 28 June 1892 and its route is known as the most typical of the city. In 2002 it was classified a National Monument. Ticket price is €3.50 for a round trip, however day cards are valid for it.

*The oldest funicular of Lisbon was inaugurated on 19 April 1884 and on that day it worked for 16 consecutive hours, carrying more than 3,000 passengers free. In 2002 it was classified a National Monument.

*Located downtown, this elevator was designed by a follower of French engineer Gustav Eiffel and connects downtown to Trinidade, located many metres uphill. 7 Colinas valid. Inaugurated on 10 July 1902, it is the only street lift in Lisbon for public service. It was built by the architect Raoul Mesnier du Ponsard in cast iron enriched with filigrana details. In 2002 it was classified a National Monument. This monumental elevator is popular with tourists and has a nice viewpoint on the top. The fare is €5 however, and sometimes there are long lines of people wanting to take the ride up. Realistically you can walk up faster than the queue clears and it would be cheaper to take a metered taxi if you don't want to wait or walk.

Architecture
*Located up the hill, with a great view over the city and the river. If you have the energy, get there by walking from downtown, going through the fantastic old neighbourhood of Alfama. The ticket office is way before the entrance (where the line is), make sure you buy the ticket first, or you'll be turned back when you eventually reach the entrance.

*Along the way from downtown to St. George's Castle.

*This sister bridge of the San Francisco Golden Gate Bridge was designed by the same architect in 1966 to connect Lisbon with the Setubal peninsula across the Tagus (Tejo) River. Formerly known as the Salazar Bridge, it was renamed after the Carnation Revolution, which on April 25, 1974 ended the dictatorship!

*It is the longest bridge in Europe (including viaducts), and ninth longest in the world, with a total length of 17.2 km (10.7 mi), including 0.829 km (0.5 mi) for the main bridge, 11.5 km (7.1 mi) in viaducts, and 4.8 km (3.0 mi) in dedicated access roads.

*This is a historic aqueduct in the city of Lisbon, Portugal. It is one of the most remarkable examples of 18th-century Portuguese engineering, including the largest stone arch in the world. The main course of the aqueduct covers 18 km, but the whole network of canals extends through nearly 58 km. The Mãe d'Água (Mother of the Water) reservoir of the Amoreiras, the largest of the water reservoirs, was finished in 1834. This reservoir, with a capacity of 5,500 m³ of water, was designed by Carlos Mardel. It is now deactivated and can be visited as part of the Museu da Água (Water Museum).

* Church of St. John the Baptist, situated nearby to Paço do Lumiar. 

Districts
 
*Rossio is the main square in Lisbon, the equivalent of Madrid's Puerta del Sol, Tokyo's Shibuya or London's Trafalgar Square, which is a common meeting place for locals. This is a must visit for all visitors to Lisbon to experience city life.

* The trendy district with all the fancy shops is just a 5 minutes walk from Bairro Alto 

*Take a stroll along the historical streets of this elegant shopping district, stopping for a cup of coffee with the statue of Fernando Pessoa, Portugal's great Modernist poet. Head uphill to Bairro Alto, for stunning views of the city and some wild partying in Lisbon's most popular nightclub district.

 
*This part of the city was completely rebuilt after the 1755 earthquake by the Marquês de Pombal. The planned layout, greatly different from what you will see in the more ancient neighborhoods, is a testimony to the ideas of the Enlightenment.

*This neighborhood still bears signs of the Moorish presence in the city, with the buildings very close to each other, and very irregular streets.

It's very atmospheric and a great spot in which to wander around.

*This magnificent plaza, facing the river, is the beginning of Lisboa's downtown. It is also known as 'Terreiro do Paço', meaning 'Grounds of the Palace', relating to its function before the Great Earthquake of 1755.

Belém
This monument-packed neighbourhood is a must-see place. 

Take bus 28 to the west (Restelo direction), which follows the coast line and provides an express service with few stops.
Train Cascais suburban train (line "Cascais todos" or "Oeiras"; the express trains don't stop in Belém) to Belém and walk to the attractions.
Tram 15 to the west (Algés direction), which follows the Junqueira residencial line. Check the route map inside the tram: it helps to find a right station for most famous of Belém attractions. 
The extensive bus network also serves Belém from various departure points around the city and can be less busy than the tram.
The main monuments are well separated from each other and there is a road/rail highway between them that can only be crossed at a couple of places. In addition it is mostly open and unshaded, so be prepared for a lot of walking in the hot sun.

The neighbourhood features:

* Open 10AM-5:30PM in winter, 10AM-6:30PM in summer (with the last entry allowed 30 minutes before closure). A ticket package for both the Belem Tower and Jeronimos Monastery is offered for €12.
Be aware that access to the top of the tower, and intermediate floors, is via a very narrow, steep spiral staircase. This is used in both directions and is potentially unsafe (also females may be groped in the crush).

* Try to avoid the morning rush of tour parties (with pushy tour guides) as admission is slow and you could queue for a while.

* There is a well-concealed pedestrian subway in line between the Monastery and the Monument.

* The modern CCB holds a permanent contemporary art exhibition, from the Berardo Collection - it features works from Picasso, Dalí, Duchamp, Magritte, Andy Warhol, among others.

* Housed in the former riding school of the palace, don't miss the world's largest collection of coaches and royal vehicles

* In front of the former Royal Palace of Belém, now the Presidential Palace, there is a massive statue looking out to sea, representing Afonso de Albuquerque, second ruler of Portuguese India in the early 16th century.

* Lumiar, a nice residential area with parks and shops

A stroll around its many gardens enjoying the river's bright blue is also a must.

Museums and galleries
Most of Lisbon's museums and monuments (especially those in Belem) close on Mondays.

*Considered one of the best museums in Portugal, it comprises two art collections that are located in distinct buildings connected by a magnificent garden. It gathers a collection of artworks that cover more than two thousand years of Art, from Ancient Egypt to Contemporaneity.

* A hidden gem. It was created several hundred years ago, by a King of Portugal at the time of the Discoveries. The story goes that this King wanted one of every type of plant in the world, and although that's unlikely, there is a huge collection dating back by three or four centuries which is worth checking out. Also some weird and wonderful bizarre grafted trees - the roots hang down like fingers and toes where one tree has been grafted onto another, sometimes completely different, species.

For more of a clubbing or disco experience, try the Docas district along the marina overlooking the Ponte 25 de Abril, or the Cais do Sodré area (just below Chiado and Bairro Alto, near the river), where, next to a couple of old dodgy sailors' bars and a prostitution area, new trendy night clubs have recently opened which are attracting new crowds - here you can also go clubbing and occasionally catch live music ranging from pop, rock and jazz to electronica.

Eat 

Portuguese dining rituals tend to follow the Mediterranean siesta body clock.

Most restaurants are very small, family run and generally cheap. Some of them have a sheet on the door with the "pratos do dia" (dishes of the day) written on it. These dishes are usually cheaper and fresher than the rest of menu there, and unless you're looking for something specific, they're the right choice.

During the dinner the waiter will probably bring you some starter dishes you did not request (called couvert): as those are not free, feel free not to touch them and they will not be charged on your bill (but check it!). 

Never ask a taxi driver about what restaurant you should go, they will take you to an expensive tourist-oriented restaurant, where they will receive a commission.

Where

For Portuguese traditional cuisine at its finest, head to the area of Chiado.

Tourist traps with laminated menus and meal deals are mostly concentrated in the Baixa area.

It has an exception, however: Rua das Portas de Santo Antão (north-east from Praca dos Restauradores, parallel to it)--it's the seafood strip, and home to the best greasy spit-roasted chicken this side of Louisiana at the Bonjardim restaurant (Santo Antão, 11), appropriately nicknamed Rei dos Frangos.

For a familiar taste at one of the many chain eateries, head to Doca de Santo Amaro (train/tram 15 station Alcantara-Mar) and Parque das Nações (metro Oriental).

All the culinary and clubbing kudos is right now concentrated in Doca de Jardim de Tabaco (piece of river waterfront right under Castelo de Sao Jorge).

Quality dishes for a high price are in well-to-do Lapa.

Tour groups primarily feel at home in Alfama.

Traditional Portuguese restaurants are in Bairro Alto, scattered abundantly through its quirky narrow streets.

Fado
Make sure that you dine at a restaurant that plays traditional fado music. Beware that you'll pay more than in normal restaurants, and the food and drink quality may not be up to the price, you're paying for the music experience.
You could also consider attending Fado Vadio (vadio literally translates to bohemian or vagabond). It is typically free or quite cheap, and has several performers do 3-4 songs each. The performers are a mix of amateurs with the occasional professional, but all are passionate about the music.

Pastelarias
Try the magnificent pastéis de nata at any pastelaria.
* They are served right out of the oven there, with the side of confectioner's sugar and cinnamon; as you navigate through the azulejo-decorated labyrinthine passages of the expansive shop, stop to look at the workers behind glass panels turning the endless stream of these delicacies, just baked, each in its own little ramekin, over onto the waiting trays. These are absolutely a must eat and you can't possibly regret it. It's good to accompany your treat with a cup of coffee. Cafe culture is a mainstay of Portugal but the local names are different. Cafe - Espresso, Cafe Pingado - Espresso with a few drops of milk (like a Macchiato), Meia de Leite - Half coffee, half milk.

If you don't feel like traveling all the way to Belem, another great place to get pasteis de nata is Manteigaria Their main bakery is near the Chiado station, where you can watch them bake delicious pasteis de nata in front of you.

Budget

You will find traditional meals served in small coffee shops/restaurants, especially in the old parts of town. Some will be better than others, just check if there are a lot of locals eating there! They will be very cheap (as low as €5 for a full meal) and home-style cooking. The owners probably wont speak English and the menu will probably be in Portuguese only!

* A good and selected combination of cheap and mid range dishes. The owners are very friendly and speak English, as well as Portuguese. (It is a good restaurant if you want to eat South American grilled meat.)

* Authentic Peruvian food in a down-to-earth environment. Family run restaurant with Peruvian chefs serving authentic recipes from Peru, featuring iconic dishes like Ceviche, Lomo Saltado and refreshing Pisco Sours. Friendly staff and fair prices.

* Incredible Portugese food at incredible prices. Pretty quick walk from the Baixa, and usually packed with locals, including those waiting outside in the terrace courtyard with a glass of wine.

Mid-range

* Under the French culinary concept of “bistronomy”, the restaurant combines bistrô and haute cuisine into high-quality food at affordable prices. This innovative concept is served in a relaxed atmosphere, with a simple menu and market produce. Bistrô4 is the five-star PortoBay Liberdade hotel's restaurant

Alfama

Downtown (Baixa and Chiado)
*On the location of a historical cafe (the "leitaria"), this place focuses on only a short number of dishes (meats, fish & seafood) but makes up for this in quality and portion size. For an atmospheric presentation ask for one of their "espetada"s. The wines compliment the dishes and you can end the meal with a dessert. For someone looking for great value for their buck (no compromises on quality), it's a good place to start (or end) an evening.

*Features daily lunch menu; Portuguese and Mediterranean cuisine. A place dedicated to the promotion of Portugal's wine and gastronomic culture.

* Small Indian restaurant.

* Vegetarian restaurant affiliated with a Buddhist center. Vegan friendly. Juice bar.

Docas
*Spanish food restaurant with fabulous seafood with a great view of the Tejo river and the Ponte de 25 Abril. Excellent service and really fresh food. Don't miss the tamboril (monkfish) with the tomato and asparagus sauce. Really worth the effort to get there, the Docas area is fairly newly developed, and the railway line makes it hard to find a way across the main road, but with determination it's a great spot to go to. It's one of a number of restaurants of varying types along this stretch of the quayside, but it stands out for quality and value. Check it out before it gets 'trendy'.

Prazeres
*Traditional style fresh pasta dishes, various starters, risottos, meats and wood-oven pizzas are produced from a wide selection of prime quality fresh ingredients. Extensive wine list procured from both national and Italian producers and a delightful choice of desserts carefully picked from the Italian classics.

*A restaurant with a variety of traditional Portuguese dishes very appreciated by the tourists. Friendly environment, great service. Make sure you try the appetizers.

* Mediocre quality and rude service, but has veggie options.

*Decent Indian food, but far from the best. The location is great though for starting a night out on the town. Ask for the shoot drinks!

*A popular restaurant that offers a diverse menu of traditional Portuguese, international and vegetarian cuisine. The difficulty will be in choosing what to eat as this mid-range restaurant’s menu is both broad and deep in terms of tantalizing dishes on offer. The solution for a couple is to agree on the dishes and swap over half-way in order to double the gastronomic experience. Their specialty “Champagne” Sangria is a must do. The opening hours accommodate those that like to eat before 9pm and for those that dinner is an after 10pm affair. The waiting staff speak English and will humorously and patiently (with one raised eyebrow) assist you navigate your attempts to order in Portuguese. If you have the funds, there are various works of art on the walls available for purchase. Open from 7:30pm to 2am; Closed on 2nd Wednesday

Stay safe

Lisbon is a fairly safe city but use common sense precautions, especially at train stations, on public transport and when going out at night.

Crime

The most common crime against tourists is pickpocketing and theft from rental cars or on public transport, i.e. crowded cable cars, trains or buses. Simple precautions are enough to maintain your safety while travelling on them.

Violent and/or drug related crimes are known to take place in areas such as Bairro Alto and Santos, especially at night. Chances are you'll be approached at least a few times by certain types offering 'hash' or 'chocolate', especially in the downtown area on and around Rua Augusta, or near the Chiado Plaza. If you are of fair complexion or obviously a tourist you are more likely to be approached (young tourists out for drinks are also very likely be approached). These approaches are usually done by drug dealers and scammers and may degenerate into mugging. Also be aware that more often than not the substance they claim to be "hash" is just pressed bayleaf. 

Due to soaring house prices caused by speculation, the "Baixa" area has become depopulated. Its back streets are often fair ground for muggers, although Terreiro do Paço and Chiado are relatively safe due to their status as night spots. The Intendente and Martim Moniz were formerly known for prostitution and drug trafficking, but after a recent renovation and the opening of several new bars and nightspots, they have become much safer.

ATM / bank machine muggings are commonplace in the city center. Groups of adolescents occasionally stay close to the ATM / "multibanco" and wait until you have entered your PIN. They then force you away from the machine and withdraw the maximum amount (€200 maximum per withdrawal; however, two withdrawals of €200 per day per bank card are allowed). Try to withdraw money earlier in the day.

Car jacking is rare, but has increased in frequency. Usual targets are luxury/top brand vehicles or unescorted female drivers. Make sure your car doors are locked even during daytime. 

Criminals in Lisbon are witty and continuously come up with new scams. Examples include: 
- someone approaches you for no apparent reason and distracts you with conversation or begging, while someone else pickpockets you; 

- someone pretending they need to "borrow" money from you, promising to pay you back in a few hours; 

- another well known scam involves one person offering you drugs, while a second person will suddenly approach you pretending to be a police officer, and asking you to pay a "fine" if you want to avoid "jail". 

A firm 'no thank-you' or "não, obrigado", if you're a female; "não, obrigada", if you're female should be enough to deter them. Another possible option is simply walking away and avoiding any interaction from the first moment. 

Car parking scammers - Finally, when driving, be on the lookout for one of Lisbon's greatest plagues: "arrumadores" - "ushers" or illegal parking "assistants". These are drug addicts, petty thieves or simply homeless people who stand near vacant car parking spaces and "help" you to park your car even though no help is obviously needed. As soon as you step out of the vehicle, the "arrumador" will try to extort money from you as payment for the so-called "service", through begging at best or physical abuse in the worst situations (rare). They might also pretend to be "official" parking space "guards" or "security" and promise to keep an eye on your car - naturally, they will disappear as soon as you give them money. 
If you are not in an isolated area (i.e. other people / witnesses are around) and decide not to give them money at all you may simply ignore them and walk away after parking your car - should you do so, however, bear in mind there is a risk of having your car damaged or broken into once you are gone, but most times the "arrumador" will just move on to other targets.

Although "arrumadores" are not usually dangerous, caution is always needed: many have been known to use this scam to attack or rob people (especially when they act in groups), and instances of car jacking have been reported, especially when unescorted female drivers are concerned. 

Generally, the best course of action is to park somewhere else (preferably in areas that are not too isolated) or just pay for a place in an official parking lot - a bit more expensive, but hassle-free.

Walking, Cycling and Driving

Lisbon drivers are somewhat unreliable, with a tendency for speeding and disregarding basic traffic rules during rush hour or near night spots. Taxi drivers are notorious for aggressive and even violent behaviour towards other drivers. Motorbike riders also tend to indulge in speeding and skipping lanes without warning. Also, drinking and driving is a common offence in Portugal and Lisbon is no exception.

Although most Lisbon drivers will be cautious and polite with pedestrians, they are generally very disrespectful and intolerant towards cyclists and will frequently heckle them and display aggressive behaviour. Situations where cyclists are assaulted or even thrown off the road by car drivers are common.

Cycling in Lisbon is pleasant and danger-free in parks and near the river, but it is generally a dangerous activity elsewhere in the city centre and other areas where bike lanes are still not available. 

In any case, there are still quite a few areas safe good for cycling and do not be put off by Lisbon's hills. For 7(Seven) EUR, a Lisbon Bike Map 
is available with valuable information, provided by some of the local and experienced cyclists.

Start by riding up hill on the pleasant Monsanto Forest Park and west part of the city. 
In some other areas you find the new city bike lanes, many of which are located along over the river waterfront. 

Just outside Lisbon, Sintra, Cascais and Arrábida are all great and normally safe place where drivers are used to local cyclists often out riding.

In case of Emergency

Ambulance, fire brigade, police: call 112. English-speaking operators are available 24/7.

Same number is used with both land line and mobile phone. The number works on any mobile phone, whether it is keylocked or not and with or without SIM card.

Contact
Private international call centers and public telephone booths are common throughout Lisbon. Be warned, however, public phones can be less generous than slot machines: many times they'll swallow your change and give you no credit. You're better off purchasing a Portugal Telecom pre-paid card you can insert into the phone, or even a discount calling card which connects you via a toll-free number. These can be purchased from street kiosks and convenience stores. Most payphones also allow you to pay by credit card, although support for this feature is somewhat expensive. 

Internet cafes are also abundant in the Rossio and Restauradores districts as well as in the Bairro Alto (opening late there). Expect to pay between €2 - €3 per hour.
