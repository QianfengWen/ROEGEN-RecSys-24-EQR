Lyon written as Lyons in English, is the third largest city in and the center of the second largest metropolitan area in the country. It is the capital of the region and the department. 

Understand
Founded by the Romans, with many preserved historical areas, Lyon is the archetype of the heritage city, as recognized by UNESCO. Lyon is a vibrant metropolis that makes the most out of its unique architectural, cultural, and gastronomic heritage, its dynamic demographics and economy, and its strategic location between Northern and Southern Europe. It is more and more open to the world, with an increasing number of students and international events.

The city itself has more than 522,000 inhabitants. However, the direct influence of the city extends well over its administrative borders, with the population of Greater Lyon (which includes 57 towns or communes) at about 2.1 million. Lyon and its metropolitan area are rapidly growing and getting younger, because of their economic attractiveness.

It is known as a gastronomic and historical city with a vibrant cultural scene. It is also the birthplace of cinema.

Districts
Lyon is shaped by its two rivers, the Rhône River (to the East) and the Saône (to the West), which both run North-South. The main areas of interest are:

Fourvière, Vieux Lyon, Croix-Rousse and a large part of Presqu'île are classified as a .

Lyon has nine administrative subdivisions called arrondissements, which are designated by numbers. They correspond approximately to the following neighborhoods:
* 1st arrondissement (center): North of Presqu'île and slopes of the Croix-Rousse hill; home of the canuts (silk workers), and still a 'rebel' neighborhood.
* 2nd arrondissement (centre): Most of Presqu'île; basically, this is where the action takes place.
* 3rd arrondissement (East): Part-Dieu, North of Guillotière, Montchat, North of Monplaisir; the most populated arrondissement with wealthy and popular neighborhoods, former industrial or military sites, and a modern business district.
* 4th arrondissement (North): Plateau of the Croix-Rousse hill; historical area with a "village" mood.
* 5th arrondissement (West): Vieux Lyon, Fourvière, Saint-Just, Point du Jour; historical sites and quiet residential neighborhoods.
* 6th arrondissement (Northeast): Brotteaux; the wealthiest part of the city.
* 7th arrondissement (South): South of Guillotière, Gerland; from popular neighbourhoods to high-tech industrial zones.
* 8th arrondissement (Southeast): South of Monplaisir, Etats-Unis, industrial and popular neighborhoods built mainly in the 1920s-1930s.
* 9th arrondissement (Northwest): Vaise, La Duchère, St Rambert; some of the areas which have evolved the most in recent years.
* Don't forget to visit Sainte-Foy-lès-Lyon, a nice little town on the western hill of Lyon, across the river Saône, where you can enjoy a walk halfway between the city and the countryside, with marvelous perspectives on the city.

Zip codes for Lyon begin with 69 for the Rhône département and end with the number of the arrondissement: 69004 is therefore the zip code for the 4th arrondissement. Special zip codes may be used for businesses.

History
All periods of Lyon's 2000-year history have left visible traces in the city's architectural and cultural heritage, from Roman ruins to Renaissance palaces to contemporary skyscrapers. It never went through a major disaster (earthquake, fire, extensive bombing) or a complete redesign of urban plans. Very few cities in the world boast such diversity in their urban structure and architecture.

Early traces of settlement date back to 12,000 BC but there is no evidence of continuous occupation prior to the Roman era. Lugdunum, the Roman name of the city, was officially founded in 43 BC by Lucius Munatius Plancus, then Governor of Gaul. The first Roman settlements were on Fourvière Hill, and the first inhabitants were probably veterans of Caesar's war campaigns. The development of the city was boosted by its strategic location and it was promoted Capital of Gauls in 27 BC by General Agrippa, emperor Augustus's son-in-law and minister. Large carriageways were then built, providing easy access from all parts of Gaul. Lugdunum became one of the most prominent administrative, economic, and financial centers in Gaul, along with Narbonne. The main period of peace and prosperity of the Roman city was between 69 and 192 AD. The population at that time was estimated between 50,000 and 80,000. Lugdunum consisted of four populated areas: the top of Fourvière hill, the slopes of Croix-Rousse around the Amphithéâtre des Trois Gaules, the Canabae (around where Place Bellecour is today), and the right bank of the Saône river, mainly in what is today St Georges neighborhood.

Lugdunum was the place where the first Christian communities of Gaul appeared. It was also where the first martyrdoms took place, most notably in 177 AD when the young slave Blandine was killed in the Amphithéâtre des Trois Gaules, along with 47 other martyrs.

The city lost its status as the Capital of Gauls in 297 AD. Then, in the early years of the 4th century, the aqueducts that brought water to the top of Fourvière suddenly stopped functioning. This was due to a lack of funds for their maintenance and security; the lead pipes that carried the water were stolen and could not be replaced. The city was completely deprived of water overnight. This triggered the end of the Roman Lugdunum, which lost a large part of its population and was reorganized around the Saône.

In the Middle Ages, the city developed on both banks of the Saône. The name "Lion" or "Lyon" appeared in the 13th century. The early Middle Ages were very troubled politically. Since the political geography of France kept changing, the city belonged successively to multiple provinces. It then belonged to the Holy Roman Empire from 1018 to 1312, when it was given to France at the Vienna Council. At that time, the city was still of limited size but had a largely religious influence; in 1078, Pope Gregory VII made the Archbishop of Lyon the highest Catholic dignitary in the former Gaul (Primat des Gaules).

In the Renaissance, fiscal advantages and the organization of numerous trade fairs attracted bankers from Florence and merchants from all over Europe; the city became more and more prosperous and experienced a second golden age. The main industries were silk weaving, introduced in 1536, and printing. Lyon became one of Europe's largest cities and its first financial place, helped by the advantages given by King François I who even considered, at one time, making Lyon the capital of France. Around 1530, the population of Lyon reached 50,000.

In the following centuries, Lyon was hurt by the religious wars but remained a major industrial and intellectual center, while the financial activity moved to Geneva and Switzerland. In the 18th century, half of the inhabitants were silk workers (canuts).

The eastern bank of the Rhône was not urbanized before the 18th century when the swamps (called Brotteaux) were dried out to allow construction. Those massive works were led by engineer Morand. In the meantime, works conducted by Perrache doubled the area of the Presqu'île. The extension works were halted by the French Revolution but started again in the early 19th century.

During the Revolution, in 1793, Lyon took sides against the central power of the Convention (Parliament), which caused severe repression from the army. Over 2,000 people were executed.

In the early 19th century, the silk industry was still developing, notably thanks to Jacquard's loom which made the weaving work more efficient. Social crises, however, occurred: in 1831, the first revolt of the canuts was harshly repressed. The workers were protesting against the introduction of new technology, which was likely to cause unemployment. Other riots took place in 1834, 1848, and 1849, especially in the Croix-Rousse neighborhood. From 1848, the Presqu'île area was redesigned in a way similar to Haussmann's works in Paris. In 1852, the neighboring towns of Vaise, Croix-Rousse, and Guillotière became districts of Lyon. The traditional silk industry disappeared at the end of the century because of diseases affecting the French silkworms and the opening of the Suez Canal which reduced the price of imported silk from Asia. Various other industries developed at that time; the most famous entrepreneurs of the late 19th century were the Lumière brothers, who invented cinema in Lyon in 1895.

Edouard Herriot was elected mayor in 1905 and governed the city until his death in 1957. He initiated a number of important urban projects, most in collaboration with architect Tony Garnier: Grange Blanche hospital (today named after Herriot), Gerland slaughterhouses (now Halle Tony Garnier) and stadium, the Etats-Unis neighborhood, etc.

During World War II Lyon was close to the border between the "free zone" and the occupied zone at the same time, it was a key strategic location for German and French resistance. Jean Moulin, head of the Resistance, was arrested in Caluire (North suburb of Lyon). On 26 May 1944, Lyon was bombed by the Allied aviation. The Liberation of Lyon occurred on 3 September.

In the 1960s, the construction of the business district of Part-Dieu began; its symbol is the "pencil" tower, the tallest building in Lyon. Meanwhile, the association "Renaissance du Vieux Lyon" (Rebirth of the Old Lyon) managed through the government to have this Renaissance area classified as the first preserved landmark in France, while it was threatened by a highway construction project defended by Mayor Louis Pradel. Pradel was a convinced "modernist" and supporter of automobiles. He also backed the construction of the Fourvière tunnel, which opened in 1971, and of the A6/A7 freeway through Presqu'île, near Perrache station, a decision later described as "the screw-up of the century" by Mayor Michel Noir, in the 1990s. In 1974, the first line of the metro was opened. In 1981, Lyon was linked to Paris by the first TGV (high-speed train) line. In the 1980s and 1990s, a huge number of buildings in Vieux Lyon and Croix-Rousse were renovated. The landscape of Lyon is still evolving, notably with the new Rhône banks promenade or the construction of new skyscrapers in Part-Dieu.

In the future, the banks of the Saône also will be given a second youth. The completion of the Lyon beltway on the western side should relieve the central areas from some of the traffic. A high-performance train network serving exurban areas (like the RER around Paris) is also planned.

Politics
A city of merchants and industry, Lyon has a long tradition of center-right governments and mayors, even if some neighborhoods, most notably Croix-Rousse, have a very strong left-wing inclination. In 2001, however, Gérard Collomb, a member of the moderate left-wing Socialist party, was elected mayor. Although many controversies surrounded Collomb, he adopted a strategy of creating public infrastructure projects to gain popularity.

Economy
The silk industry was the main activity for centuries. Since the end of the 19th century, it has been successfully replaced by several others. Feyzin, a southern suburb, is home to a major oil refinery, and a large number of chemical plants are also located along the Rhône River south of Lyon. Pharmaceutics and biotechnology are also important; they were historically fueled by Lyon's importance in medical research, and the local authorities are trying to maintain international leadership in these industries. The southeastern suburbs of Vénissieux and St Priest host large automotive plants, such as Renault's truck and bus factories. But as in most Western metropolises, the service industry is now dominant. Many large banking and insurance companies have important offices in Lyon, and the IT services industry is also well-developed. From an economic point of view, Lyon is the most attractive and dynamic city in France. This may be explained by the easy access from all over Europe (probably second only to Paris in the country), the availability of qualified workforce and research centers, and lower real estate prices compared to the capital.

Climate
Lyon has a "semi-continental" climate. Winters are cold but temperatures under -5°C (23°F) remain rare. You can, however, experience an awful freezing sensation when northern winds blow. Snowfalls happen but snow-covered streets are generally not seen for more than a few days every winter. Summers can be hot; temperatures around 35°C (95°F) are not exceptional in July and August. Precipitations are moderate and happen throughout the year; the mountains to the west (Massif Central) protect the area against perturbations from the Atlantic. During the summer, especially in August, precipitations often take the form of thunderstorms whereas in winter, lighter but more continuous rain is more common. Spring and early autumn are usually enjoyable.

Language
The language of the city is French. The local dialect (patois, basically French with many typical local words or expressions) has practically disappeared since one out of two inhabitants were born outside the Rhône department. 

Hotels, tourist attractions, and restaurants in popular areas generally have staff capable of speaking in English. You could, however, experience difficulties in more remote areas. The transportation system also has little information written in English. On the street, many people (especially young people) speak at least basic English, but they will appreciate a little effort in French. Using basic words like bonjour (hello), s'il vous plaît (please), merci (thank you), or excusez-moi (excuse me) will certainly make people even more friendly and willing to help you.

The only measurement system used is the metric system. Most French people have no idea what Imperial units mean.

Smoking
Everywhere in France, smoking is prohibited in all closed public places, including bars, restaurants, and nightclubs.

Tourist information
* The office is in the southeast corner of Place Bellecour.

Get in
By plane
* It is a rapidly developing airport. The Airport hosts a few intercontinental flights, the only regular flight from North America is with Air Canada from Montréal, but can easily be reached via a European hub (, , , etc). Air France serves most airports in France and major European airports. EasyJet serves many destinations in Europe (including , , , , and ) along with a few domestic destinations which are not easily reached by train (, , ). Most other major European airlines also operate flights between Lyon and their respective hubs.
:*Rhônexpress tram-train links the airport with a central part of Lyon. It is faster (30 min) and more reliable than the old buses, but it is aimed at business travelers given the upscale onboard service for a tram (free wifi and power sockets at each seat) and the high price It is slightly cheaper if you purchase the ticket online. If you purchase a return ticket online at least 1 or 2 months in advance, a greater discount is available. Discounted tickets are available for young people up to the age of 25. The Rhônexpress connects the city at the main Lyon Part-Dieu station, in addition to connecting with the metro (line A) at Vaulx-en-Velin La Soie (second stop), which is convenient if you are staying in Presqu'île or Villeurbanne. Trains run from 5:00 to 24:00 (midnight) and depart every 15 (6:00-21:00) for 30 min. To find them, follow the red signs in the airport terminals. You have to walk through the TGV station, which can be as long as 10 minutes in time if you arrive at Terminal 3 (which is served by low-cost airlines).
:*As of 2019 there are provided new shared shuttles to and from the airport. 
:*A taxi to Lyon costs around €40-50 depending on the exact destination, so if you are a group of four people this could be an option. Ask to be dropped off at one of the metro stations located on the eastern side of town (Vaulx-en-Velin La Soie, Mermoz-Pinel) to save money. Taxis are available at the taxi rank outside Terminal 1 (follow the signs). See the 'By taxi' section below if you want to book a taxi in advance.

* It is served by some low-cost airlines. There are bus services from Grenoble-Isère Airport to Lyon.

* It saves money by using low-cost airlines. You can take the train from Geneva Airport to the main railway station in Geneva (Cornavin) free of charge by picking up a complimentary ticket in the baggage reclaim area, and then take a train from Cornavin to Lyon. The journey takes around 2.5 hours.

By train
From the rest of France, the train is generally the most convenient way to reach the city, except for some regions, the Southwest for example. Lyon has three main train stations serving national and regional destinations:
* Lyon-Saint-Exupéry-TGV (the station is outside the city and serves the airport), 
* Part-Dieu station (M/T: Part-Dieu), was opened with the first TGV line in 1981. It is in the heart of Lyon's main business district.
* Perrache (M/T: Perrache) is the historical station. The transit station is just a short walk away from Place Bellecour and is generally easier if you are staying in the city center.

There are smaller stations serving suburban and regional destinations: St Paul (B: C3-Gare St Paul), Vaise (M: Gare de Vaise), Jean Macé (M: Jean Macé), Vénissieux (M: Gare de Vénissieux) and Gorge de Loup (M: Gorge de Loup).

Lyon is linked by TGV (fast trains) to (2 hours) and (1 h 36 min). Many other domestic destinations are served directly, and there are several direct trains to every day (4 h). TGVs to and from Paris serve both Perrache and Part-Dieu stations; other TGVs generally serve only Part-Dieu.

Coming to Lyon from London by Eurostar may be interesting. It is faster and easier to change trains in Lille rather than Paris. Hence, if you are traveling from , England, the best way would be to take Eurostar from St Pancras Station to Gare de Lille Europe and take High-Speed Train TGV. If you prefer Paris Gare de Nord, you would need to take RER D to Gare de Lyon Station. The total journey time from London to Lyon will be approx 5h30min. From , you will find other local trains to reach Lyon.

Lyon is a major automotive hub for central and southern France: 
* A6 to the north — .
* A7 to the south — , , , .
* A43 to the east — , the Alps, Northern Italy.
* A47 to the west — Saint-Étienne, Clermont-Ferrand, Massif Central, west of France.
* A42 to the northeast — Bourg-en-Bresse, (), .

 Get around 

Lyon's public transportation system, known as TCL is regarded as one of the most efficient in the country. Central areas are very well served. The campuses are in the eastern suburbs, where many jobs are concentrated. The western suburbs are more residential and can be difficult to reach. As everywhere in France, the network can be perturbed by strikes from time to time.

Metro
There are four metro (subway) lines (A to D) The first line of the network was line C in 1974 (lines A and B were already planned but line C took less time to complete because it used an existing funicular tunnel). Line A opened in 1978. Trains generally run every 2-10 minutes, depending on the line and the time. Information screens above the platforms display the waiting times for the next two trains and useful information such as delays, upcoming closures, etc.
* Line A (red, Perrache - Vaulx-en-Velin La Soie) serves Presqu'île, the neighborhoods around Parc de la Tête d'Or and then runs under Cours Emile Zola, Villeurbanne's main artery. The last two stops (Laurent Bonnevay and Vaulx La Soie) provide numerous connections with buses to the eastern suburbs. Line A connects with Line D at Bellecour, line C at Hôtel de Ville, line B at Charpennes, tram lines T1 and T2 at Perrache, and T3 at Vaulx La Soie. It is very busy during rush hours, especially between Bellecour and Hôtel de Ville.
* Line B (blue, Charpennes - Gare d'Oullins) serves most notably Part Dieu station and Gerland stadium. It connects with line A at Charpennes and line D at Saxe-Gambetta.
* Line C (yellow, Hôtel de Ville - Cuire) uses a short cog railway and serves the Croix-Rousse hill. Due to the configuration of the infrastructure, the frequencies are not very good.
* Line D (green, Gare de Vaise - Gare de Vénissieux), the busiest of the four lines, is entirely automated; this allows good frequency in off-peak hours, especially at night and on Sundays. There are many bus connections to the suburbs at Gare de Vaise, Gorge de Loup, Grange Blanche, Parilly, and Gare de Vénissieux.

Metros run approximately from 5AM to midnight. Some bus lines do not run after 9PM. Check the TCL website for details.

Funicular
The metro is generally reliable, clean, and comfortable. Besides the classical metro, two funiculars run from Vieux Lyon metro station to Saint-Just and Fourvière Hill respectively. The route is mainly underground with a total length of 427 meters.

Tram
There are also five tram lines (T1 to T5). They are not very interesting if you stay within the city center; they are most useful to reach campuses and suburban areas. Trams run approximately from 5AM to midnight. Some bus lines do not run after 9PM. Check the TCL website for details.

Buses
With more than 100 bus lines you should be able to go virtually anywhere reasonably far away from the center. Some of them use trolley (electric) buses. Lyon is one of the few cities in France which still use this system. There are two special bus lines: C1 and C3, where you will find big articulated trolley buses which run very frequently. These are sometimes referred to as Cristalis (actually the brand name of the vehicles) but people do not really use, or even know about this name.

The buses do not run after 9PM. Check the TCL website for details.

Tickets can be purchased from electronic kiosks located at the stations, but it is important to note that they do not accept paper money (only coins) and foreign credit cards are likely to be rejected. Tobacco shops and newsagents showing a "TCL" sign also sell tickets. Single tickets can be purchased from bus drivers but the price is €2.2 in that case. Group tickets are available from the tourist office. 

 By car 
Lyon has close to 50 car parks. Lyon has 4 parking zones:
*Red zone which is the most expensive zone: 11€ for two hours for example.
*Orange zone which is more advantageous: 2,80€ for two hours.
*Green zone which is free (7 days maximum).
*Black zone is prohibited in the parking lot, it is reserved for pedestrians.

Traffic is dense, parking is either very difficult or quite expensive, and there are quite a few directional signs Avoid driving within the city if you can. For the city center, look for signs reading "Presqu'île". In the Presqu'île and other central neighborhoods, it is strongly advised not to park in 'prohibited parking' areas; you could be towed. Tickets for unpaid parking are also commonplace; a specific brigade of the city police is in charge of checking parking payments in the city center. The penalty for unpaid parking is €11 (you might get several tickets on the same day in central neighborhoods); the penalty for parking in a prohibited area is €35. If you park in a dangerous place (e.g., you block an emergency exit), the fine can be up to €135.

The minimum age to rent a car is 21 and an additional charge may be required for drivers under 25 years old. Major rental companies have offices at Part-Dieu and Perrache railway stations and at the airport. Best to hire from Part-Dieu, as the subsequent navigation is much easier.

Taxis
Taxis are quite pricey. The maximum limit of fares is fixed by the authorities: €2 when you board, then per km: €1.34 (daytime, 7AM-7PM) or €2.02 (night, Sundays, holidays). The driver may charge a minimum fare of €7 for any trip. There are also several possible extra charges: for the 4th passenger, per animal or large piece of luggage, for a pickup at a train station or airport.

You can call a taxi from the following operators:
* 
* 
* Personal Welcome Lyon Airport, City and Wine tours. You can reserve a private-hire vehicle (with a driver).
* Lyon Taxi Prestige, for the regular cost of a taxi, provide high-level taxi service in Lyon and everywhere in France. Executive and VIP Service with a personal welcome at Lyon Airports and Train stations. City tours and Wine tours. Ski resort transfers, and free Wifi on board.

By bicycle
Lyon has an increasing number of safe cycling routes. Problematic points remain, especially when it comes to crossing the major roads. Also, keep in mind that there are two hills with steep slopes. 

Since May 2005, Lyon has also had a public bicycle service called Vélo'v which allows travelers, after registering a credit card, to pick up, and drop off cycles to and from over 300 points around the city. You need a credit card (Visa/MC/French CB) to make use of the service. 

If you have taken a bike and realize that it has a problem (broken chains, warped wheels, flat tires, or even missing pedals are commonplace), just put it back into its place and repeat the procedure to take another one. Be sure to rotate the seat of the damaged bike 180 degrees to indicate to other would-be users that the bike contains problems and should not be taken. There are so many bikes that it can sometimes be a problem to return them.

Note that the system has been broadened to accept most worldwide credit/debit cards. If you do have trouble having your card accepted, the transaction is aborted, and no explanations are given on the terminal. Terminals are supposed to accept all cards with a chip, and most previous difficulties are solved. Also, note that you must rent a bike immediately after purchasing a temporary pass or the ticket will become inactive (this is only true for the first rental). The terminals have only limited English translation making it a rough start, but once you get to know the system, it is a great way to move around the city. 

There is an iPhone app called Vélo which can help you find a bike or a free parking slot.

More classical bike rental service is available from:
* Also rents scooters and motorbikes.

 On foot 
The city center is not so big and most attractions can be reached from each other on foot. The walk from Place des Terreaux to Place Bellecour, for example, is about 20 min. The rule of thumb is that metro stations are generally about 10 min walk apart. Be careful when crossing major axes: traffic is dense and running red lights is a very popular sport.

See
Lyon may not have world-famous monuments such as the Eiffel Tower or the Statue of Liberty, but it offers very diverse neighborhoods that are interesting to walk around and hide architectural marvels. As time goes by, the city also becomes more and more welcoming for pedestrians and cyclists. So a good way to explore it may be to get lost somewhere and enjoy what comes up, and not to always follow the guide.

Another local feature is painted walls or murals: about 100 trompe-l'oeils of all sizes can be seen around the city.

A good point for visitors is that most attractions will not cost you a cent: churches, traboules, parks, etc. For those intending to visit several museums (which are almost the only attractions you cannot see for free), the Lyon City Card may be of interest. Available from the Tourist office. It includes unlimited rides on the public transport network, free or reduced entry fees to major museums and exhibitions, and one guided tour per day per person (Vieux Lyon, Croix-Rousse, etc.). The price is still a bit high, so count before you buy to see if this is a good deal considering your plans.

Do not hesitate to buy a detailed map with a street index from a bookshop or a newsagent; many places of interest or good restaurants are located in small streets you will not find on simplified maps, such as the ones you can get from the Tourist office.

Whatever the time of year (except for the Fête des Lumières), tourists are not very numerous yet, but they concentrate in a few small areas, especially Fourvière and Vieux Lyon, where the pedestrian streets are just as crowded as the Champs-Elysees sidewalks on sunny weekends.

The most popular places to visit: Fourvière Basilica and the view from it, Musées Gadagne, Parc de la Tête d'Or, Streets and traboules (secret covered passageways) in Vieux Lyon, St Jean Cathedral, Traboules in Croix-Rousse.

Confluence
The area south of Perrache is turning from a mostly industrial area into one of the most interesting neighborhoods in the city. There were until very recently two prisons (closed down in 2009), a wholesale food market (moved to Corbas in the southern suburbs), and large warehouses and workshops belonging to the national railway company SNCF. One of the largest development plans in Europe was put underway with the construction of a new tram line and the opening of a cultural center (La Sucrière). The Western side of the area now boasts several new buildings, most of which are interesting pieces of contemporary architecture. The new headquarters for the government of the Rhône-Alpes region was put into service and a new mall was opened. A new phase of the project is about to start with the demolition of the huge former wholesale market. Also, since 2015, the Musée des Confluences has been opened, it has a very ship-like futuristic architecture all of glass and metal, and its main exposition is about the evolution of life on earth.

Apart from the mall and the museum, there aren't many places to visit here, but it is interesting to take a walk and cycle there to see how Lyon can still evolve after 2000 years of history.

Croix-Rousse
The name "Croix-Rousse" comes from a limestone cross that was erected at the top of the hill at the beginning of the 16th century. It was then destroyed and rebuilt several times. A replica installed in 1994 can be seen on Place Joannès Ambre (between the hospital and Croix-Rousse theatre).

Croix-Rousse is known as the "working hill" but for centuries, it had been as much of a "praying hill" as Fourvière. On its slopes, the Roman Federal Sanctuary of the Three Gauls, which comprised the amphitheater, was built in 19 AD, and an altar was built in 12 BC. This sanctuary was abandoned at the end of the 2nd century. In the Middle Ages, the hill, then called Montagne St Sébastien, was not part of the free town of Lyon but of the Franc-Lyonnais province, which was independent and protected by the King. The slopes then were used to agriculture, mostly vineyards. In 1512, a fortified wall was built at the top of the hill, approximately where Boulevard de la Croix-Rousse is today. The pentes (slopes) and the plateau were therefore separated. The slopes became then part of Lyon while the plateau was outside the borders of the city. Up to thirteen religious congregations then settled on the slopes and acquired vast pieces of land. During the French Revolution, their property was confiscated and many buildings were destroyed.

Croix-Rousse is known as the main silk production area, but the industry did not exist on the hill until the early 19th century, and new weaving technologies were introduced. At that time, silk had already been produced in Lyon for over 250 years. The industry gave birth to a unique architecture: the canuts apartments had very high ceilings to accommodate the newly introduced Jacquard looms, which were up to 4 meters high; tall windows gave the necessary natural lighting for the delicate work; and mezzanines provided space for family life. The neighborhood is still one of the most densely populated in Europe. The first revolt of the canuts in 1831 is regarded as one of the first social conflicts of the industrial era. It gave the hill its reputation as a "rebel" neighborhood. In 1852, the commune (town) of Croix-Rousse, actually the plateau, was made a district of Lyon. Local people still talk about "going to Lyon" when they go down to the city center. Then important works were undertaken, such as the construction of the first funicular in the world, linking the plateau to central Lyon (it started in Rue Terme; the tunnel is now a road tunnel), or the creation of the Croix-Rousse hospital.

Nowadays the plateau keeps a "village" mood, and the slopes still have a "rebel" spirit, with many artists and associations based there, but the sociology of the neighborhood has considerably evolved with the renovation works and the subsequent rise in real estate prices and massive arrival of upper-middle-class families (bobos). Local authorities, however, are committed to preserving social diversity.

The area, especially the traboules, may be worth taking a guided tour (available from the tourist office).
* This Roman theatre is the place where the first Christian martyrs of Gaul were killed. Documents say that it was the largest theatre in Gaul at that time, but nobody knows exactly how far it extends under the neighboring buildings, nor what remains from the Roman era after centuries of construction. After the recent closing of the old Fine Arts school (the grey building overlooking the theatre), a debate was initiated about what should be done with this exceptional archaeological site. The theatre can be seen from the street but is not open to the public for safety reasons.
* This steep street has Renaissance buildings and offers a very beautiful view over the city from its top.
* Look for the lanterns over the doors and the specific signs.

The garden is a fine mixture of mineral and vegetal elements, in a style influenced by Gaudi's works in Barcelona.
* The only Baroque church in Lyon. The interior is magnificent, especially the altar (by Servandoni, modified by Soufflot, 18th century) and the canopy (by Servandoni).

Fourvière, Saint-Just
Take the funicular up the hill from Vieux Lyon metro station, or if you are fit, walk up Montée des Chazeaux (starts at the southern end of Rue du Boeuf), Montée St Barthélémy (from St Paul station) or Montée du Gourguillon (from the northern end of Rue St Georges, behind Vieux Lyon metro station). This is a 150 m (500 ft) vertical ascent approximately.

Fourvière was the original location of the Roman Lugdunum. In the 19th century, it became the religious center of the city, with the Basilica and the Archbishop's offices.
* Built in 1872 and dedicated to the Virgin Mary and the saint patron of Lyon, this massive church made of white marble could be compared to an elephant with its feet up. It is a typical example of the 19th-century "eclectic" style, with architectural elements recalling antique, classical, and Gothic eras. The Byzantine-style interior decoration is extremely exuberant, too much so for some people.
* Next to the basilica stands a smaller (86 m, 282 ft) replica of the Eiffel Tower, completed in 1894. Its construction was supported by anticlerical people to have a non-religious building as the highest point in Lyon, which has an altitude of 372 m (1272 ft) at the top. It now serves as a radio and TV antenna and is closed to the public.
* Next to the basilica is the panoramic viewpoint, with the best view over the city. If the weather is clear, Mont Blanc can be seen in the distance. This is a very good point to start your visit to the city because you can see its general layout. To go down from there, you can take Montée Cardinal Decourtray, then Rue Cléberg and Rue de l'Antiquaille which lead to the Roman theatres, or walk down through the Jardins du Rosaire, a nice garden; then stairways lead to Rue du Boeuf in Vieux Lyon. Of course, you can also take the funicular.

* These two well-preserved theatres are the most important remnant of the Roman city of Lugdunum. The Gallo-Roman museum was built next to them. The summer festival "Nuits de Fourvière" takes place here every year, which may cause access restrictions in the evening from June to early August.
* The oldest church in Lyon, and one of the oldest in France. The site is built on a Gallo-Roman necropolis which was in use for centuries, until the Middle Ages. Some sarcophagi from the 5th or 6th century are visible in the courtyard. The crypt dates back to the 9th century and was renovated in the 19th century. Early Christian remains (from the 4th-6th centuries) are kept inside. The church was rebuilt in the 19th century in a neo-classical style with a Byzantine influence. An arch from the 5th century remains. Behind the church, the calvary was built in 1687 is also a great viewpoint.

Other areas
* This charming island on the river Saône is the only inhabited island in Lyon. In the 5th century, one of the first monasteries in Gaul was founded there. It became a powerful Benedictine abbey (from the 9th century) but was finally ruined in 1526 by Protestants, during the religious wars. Of the three churches that existed on the island, only the Romanesque Notre Dame remains. The island also has other old buildings in a quiet and green environment. The suspension bridge was built in 1827.
* This neighborhood was built by the famous local architect Tony Garnier in the 1920s to house industry workers. Along with Edouard Herriot Hospital, it is one of the masterpieces of this visionary architect. The main axis of the neighborhood, boulevard des Etats-Unis, was named to honor the U.S., which had just entered World War I when the street was opened in 1917. 25 wall paintings made in the 1980s and 1990s show examples of Garnier's work and his "ideal city projects".
* The neighboring city of Villeurbanne can be seen as the 10th arrondissement because the urban continuity with Lyon is obvious. It has, however, a strong identity of its own. As an industrial town, Villeurbanne has always had a very strong left-wing political inclination. It was governed by the Communist Party for the first decades of the 20th century. A strong testimony of this era remains in the form of massive Soviet-style buildings erected in the 1930s. The Gratte-Ciel (skyscrapers) ensemble comprises the city hall, the National Popular Theatre, and housing buildings, including the skyscrapers themselves. These are 19 stories high. They are not skyscrapers to non-European eyes and were not even in the 1930s, but they were considered huge by European standards at that time.

* This business and residential area is the most important urban project Lyon has seen in recent years. Designed by the famous Italian architect Renzo Piano (also known for Beaubourg Modern Art Center in Paris and part of the Potsdamer Platz area in Berlin), it comprises a convention center, hotels, and luxury apartments just between the Rhône and Parc de la Tête d'Or.

Presqu'île
For the people of Lyon, Presqu'île is the place to go for shopping, dining or clubbing. It also represents a large part of the city's economic activity.

This narrow peninsula between the Rhône and Saône rivers was largely shaped by man. When the first inhabitants settled on what was then called Canabae, the junction of the river was located near the current site of St Martin d'Ainay Basilica. South of this point was an island. From 1772, titanic works led by engineer Antoine-Michel Perrache reunited the island to the mainland. The swamps that existed there were then dried out, which allowed the construction of Perrache station, which opened in 1846. Northern Presqu'île was largely redesigned in 1848; the only remaining Renaissance part is around rue Mercière.

Most of the action on Presqu'île takes place between Terreaux and Bellecour. Between Bellecour and Perrache, the neighborhood of Ainay is traditionally home to the Catholic bourgeoisie. Perrache station and its "exchange center" (freeway interchange, car parks, metro, and bus station) are a very important border; going from one side to the other is a challenge, be it on foot or by car. The area south of Perrache is dealt with in the next section.
* The only entirely Romanesque church in Lyon, dating back to the 11th-12th centuries. The abbey of Ainay was one of the most powerful in France between the 13th and the 16th centuries. A must-see for its very nice atmosphere.

* The city hall, built in the 17th century, has a very beautiful facade on Place des Terreaux. The most notable feature of this facade is the sculpture representing King Henri IV on horseback (in the middle of the upper part). Unfortunately, it is impossible to visit the building except during the "Heritage days" (Journées du Patrimoine) in mid-September.
* The state of this square was typical of the "automobile-friendly" urban planning of the 1960s: it was covered with tarmac, too much so given the reasonable traffic around it. The latest renovation gave the square a greener aspect and more space for pedestrians. The main interest is the central fountain (1885) by architect Gaspard André and sculptor Degeorges. The four statues portray Lyon-born artists: painter Hippolyte Flandrin (1809-1864), engraver Gérard Audran (1640-1703), sculptor Guillaume Coustou (1677-1746), and architect Philibert Delorme (1510-1570).
* This impressive painted wall portraits some of the most famous people who were born in Lyon, from Renaissance poet Louise Labé to the Lumière brothers, the inventors of cinema, and the chef Paul Bocuse.
* Opposite the City Hall stands the opera house. The 1826 theatre built by Chenavard and Pollet was completely redesigned by Jean Nouvel who kept only the façades and the foyer on the first floor. The building was reopened in 1993. The history of these works was epic: a lot of technical problems occurred and the final cost of the project was six times the initial estimate. Today, the glass top has become a classical landmark of the city but the interior design is criticized, for both aesthetic and functional reasons.

* The largest clear square in Europe. In the center stands the equestrian statue of Louis XIV ("under the horse's tail" is a usual meeting point for locals). Apart from this, it is rather empty, windy, and not so pleasant. A renovation project is underway. Between the southeast corner of Place Bellecour and the river Rhône is Place Antonin Poncet. There was a hospital there (Hôpital de la Charité) , built in 1622 and demolished in 1934. The only remaining is the bell tower ('Clocher de la Charité') built in 1667.
* This large square was completely redesigned in the 1990s by the artist Daniel Buren. On the East side stands the City Hall. On the North side, you will find the fountain sculpted by Bartholdi, the 'father' of the Statue of Liberty; this fountain was moved from the West side when the square was renovated. It now faces Palais St Pierre, which hosts the Museum of Fine Arts.
* A charming neighbourhood square planted with old plane trees. Just sit at a terrace, watch the locals playing pétanque and enjoy the mood.
* This cobblestone pedestrian street is the only significant remain from the Renaissance in Presqu'île. The name of the street refers to the clothing industry. There are traboules connecting the street to the buildings on the Saône bank. The street hosts very numerous restaurants which are far from being all good.
* Very nice church of flamboyant Gothic style.

Vieux Lyon
The Old Lyon current organization, with narrow streets mainly parallel to the river, dates back to the Middle Ages. The buildings were erected between the 15th and the 17th centuries, notably by wealthy Italian, Flemish, and German merchants who settled in Lyon where four fairs were held each year. At that time, the buildings of Lyon were said to be the highest in Europe. The area was entirely refurbished in the 1980s and 1990s. It now offers visitors colorful, narrow cobblestone streets; there are some interesting craftsmen's shops but also many tourist traps.

The Old Lyon is divided into three parts which are named after their respective churches:
* St Paul, north of Place du Change, was the commercial area during the Renaissance;
* St Jean, between Place du Change and St Jean cathedral, was home to most wealthy families: aristocrats, public officers, etc;
* St Georges, south of St Jean, was a craftsmen's district.

The area is generally crowded in the afternoon, especially at weekends. Therefore, to truly enjoy its architectural beauty, the best time is in the morning. Around lunchtime, the streets somewhat disappear behind restaurant terraces, postcard racks, and the crowd of tourists.
* This picturesque montée (sloping street on a hillside) starts behind Vieux Lyon metro station and ends quite close to the Roman theatres of Fourvière. It was the main link between the river Saône and the top of Fourvière throughout the Roman era, Middle Ages and Renaissance. Nowadays it keeps a medieval spirit. Around numbers 5-7 is Impasse Turquet, a small cul-de-sac named after Etienne Turquet, an Italian who is said to have founded the silk industry in Lyon in 1536. In this small passageway are the oldest houses of the city, dating back to the 13-14th century, with wooden balconies.
* The historical court house, also named "the 24 columns", was built between 1835 and 1842 by architect Louis-Pierre Baltard. It is a fine example of French "neo-classical" architecture. Now it hosts only the criminal court (Cour d'Assises) and the Court of Appeal. The other jurisdictions moved to a new building in Part-Dieu in 1995. The most famous trial held there was that of the former head of the Lyon Gestapo, Klaus Barbie, in 1987.
* The largest square in the area has two remarkable buildings. The Loge du Change, on the west side, was partially built by the great architect Soufflot. It is now a Protestant church known as Temple du Change. It can be visited on Saturdays. Religious services on Sundays, 10:30AM. Opposite is the Maison Thomassin, with its Gothic-style 14th-century facade. The Thomassins were a powerful merchant family in the Renaissance. Above the 2nd floor windows are the arms of the King of France, of the Dauphin (heir of the Kingdom), and of Duchess Anne of Brittany. Unfortunately, the courtyard is closed to the public.
* Besides the buildings cited above, some have very beautiful courtyards but no real traboules (that is to say, no crossing from one street to another). The most outstanding are: Maison du Chamarier (37 rue St-Jean) and Maison du Crible (16 rue du Boeuf), in which stands the famous "Pink Tower".
* A 188-meter cobbled pedestrian street. Parallel to Rue St Jean, this street is much more quiet and just as beautiful. It also has many restaurants, more expensive than in rue St Jean but, on average, much more worth the money.
* Another typical street of Vieux Lyon. It is named after the Jewish community who originally settled there but were expelled in the 14th century. Check out the back courtyard at Hôtel Builloud (number 8); it has a magnificent gallery on the first floor, designed by Philibert Delorme who was one of the most prominent local architects during the Renaissance.

* This cobblestone pedestrian street is the main axis of the area. It is full of souvenir shops and restaurants mainly intended for tourists. On a sunny Sunday afternoon, it may be hard to walk because of the crowd of both locals and tourists. You can also check out the more quiet rue des Trois Maries which runs parallel to rue St Jean, between Place de la Baleine and Rue du Palais de Justice.
* Next to St Jean cathedral (on the northern side), this small garden shows the remains of the religious buildings which occupied the site before the cathedral was erected. The oldest remains date back to the 4th century (baptistery of the former St Etienne church).

* Officially, the cathedral is dedicated to both St John the Baptist (St Jean-Baptiste) and St Stephen (St Etienne) and has the title of primatiale because the Bishop of Lyon has the honorary title of Primat des Gaules. Built between 1180 and 1480, it is mostly of Gothic style with Romanesque elements; the oldest parts are the chancel and the lateral chapels, and as one goes towards the facade, the style becomes more and more Gothic. The Cathedral hosts a spectacular astronomical clock originally built in the 14th century but modified later. However, since renovations, the clock has been stopped. Over the main door, the rose window, known as the "Lamb rose window", is an admirable work of art depicting the life of St Stephen and St John the Baptist.
* St Georges is the name given to the south part of the Vieux Lyon. It has nice Renaissance buildings which, however, do not compare to the palaces of St Jean; on the other hand, it is much more quiet than the St Jean area.
* A very nice church, with mixed Romanesque and Gothic styles. The oldest parts are from the 10th century.
* The traboules are a typical architectural feature of Lyon's historical buildings. They are corridors that link two streets through a building, and usually a courtyard. Many traboules are unique architectural masterpieces, largely influenced by Italy and especially Florence. To open the doors, just press the service button next to the door code keyboard. If you are unable to enter from one side, try the opposite entrance. In the morning, many other doors are open for service (mail, garbage collecting), so more traboules are accessible. There are traboules in almost all buildings between Quai Romain Rolland and Rue St Jean/Rue des Trois Maries, and others between Rue St Jean and Rue du Boeuf.

Museums and Galleries
* Located in the former Gestapo regional headquarters, this museum depicts the daily life in Lyon under the German occupation and keeps memories of this tragic period. Often holds exhibitions (mostly photography).
* There are exhibited paintings.
* The second largest museum in France. It has all kinds of things relating to Rhone-Alps history. A free visit to the Roman theatres may be just as interesting for those not into the details.
* Located in the Lumière brothers' house, this museum presents an interesting history of cinema through various items and film excerpts. Also is worth seeing for the lovely architecture.
* After 10 years of major refurbishment works, these museums dedicated to the history of the city and to puppets (like the famous Guignol from Lyon) were reopened in June 2009, with great public and critical success. The building itself, a magnificent Renaissance palace, is worth a visit. A nice garden and cafe have also been created at the top of the building (free access).
* Created by artist Dan Ohlmann, this private gallery shows about 120 miniature models of all kinds of scenes: houses, restaurants, workshops, schools, etc., from Lyon or elsewhere, historical or contemporary. The accuracy of the models is astonishing and some sections will be really fun for children. Movie sceneries are also presented. The gallery is in a large 16th-century building called Maison des Avocats (Lawyers' house).
* At the heart of a monumental building made of metal and glass, enjoy the original experience of retracing the great adventure of humanity from its origins to the present. Be guided through time and space and discover curiosities such as meteorites, pterodactyls, hummingbirds, female homo sapiens, microscopes, a Siberian tiger, Sputnik, Samurai armor, and more.

* If you have time to enjoy this impressive collection of art sculpture from many places of Egypt. Amazingly most objects date back 1-2 thousand years. Audioguide is highly recommended.
* Visit it only if you're a printing specialist, the collection is important, but it is presented in a outdated way.
* This museum was created during the renovation of the Etats-Unis neighborhood in the 1980s and 1990s, and the inhabitants were strongly involved in the project. The museum comprises a recreated apartment of the 1930s, which shows what life was like in these very modern housing units, and the 25 wall paintings depicting Garnier's work and ideals. You can also see the walls on your own but you will miss the interesting comments on the history of the area and the social project behind it.

Parks and Gardens

* The right bank of the river Rhône has recently been turned from an ugly car park into a 5-km promenade with various landscapes and great views over the Croix-Rousse and Presqu'Ile areas. The place had immediate success among locals. A bicycle is perfect to enjoy, except on sunny weekends when it is too crowded to ride safely.
* Small garden hidden in the bottom of a street/car park, behind a metallic door. It was designed by Canadian artists in a surrealistic spirit (recalls Magritte or Dali). Also it is a very nice viewpoint over the southern part of Lyon.
* The Rhône banks promenade ends here. This recent park does not have the majesty of Parc de la Tête d'Or but it is far less crowded and boasts some nice examples of modern landscaping. Still under development, it should cover 80 hectares when completed.
* Completed in 1862, this 105-hectare English-style garden is one of the largest and arguably one of the most beautiful urban parks in France. It is a popular place for families as well as joggers. The highlights of the park include the large greenhouses, the botanical garden, the rose garden, and the recently added "African plain" in which animals wander in a natural-style environment, perfect for children.
* Located between the metal tower of Fourvière and the Loyasse cemetery, this is rather a promenade with a nice footbridge offering great views towards the Monts d'Or and Beaujolais. There is an aerial adventure course, a skiing and mountain bike slope.
* It contains one of the richest collections in Europe, including 15,000 species of plants.

Cinemas
* Two independent cinemas; the Bellecour branch has the most avant-garde program. All foreign movies in the original version.
* After a few years of closure followed by refurbishment works, this independent cinema is now very comfortable and has a relatively avant-garde program. All foreign movies are shown in the original version.
* This major national firm has four theatres in Lyon (Cordeliers, Bellecour, Vaise, Carré de Soie) offering essentially American blockbusters and mainstream French movies. The Bellecour branch has foreign films in the original version.
* The other major cinema firm, has three theatres in Lyon (Part-Dieu, Cité Internationale, Astoria). The Astoria (M: Masséna) has foreign movies in the original version.

Events
Cultural events are listed by two weekly magazines: Le Petit Bulletin (free, available in cinemas, theatres, some bars, etc., and online 
* Lyon alternatively hosts dancing (in even years) and contemporary art biennales (in odd years) from September to December and January. The dancing and biennial are traditionally opened by a street parade in which inhabitants of the Greater Lyon take part through neighborhood associations. If you are in town at this moment, do not miss this colorful and funny event.

* It is by far the most important event of the year. It lasts four days around the 8th of December. It was initially a traditional religious celebration: on December 8th, 1852, the people of Lyon spontaneously illuminated their windows with candles to celebrate the inauguration of the golden statue of the Virgin Mary (the Virgin had been the saint patron of Lyon since she allegedly saved the city from the plague in 1643). The same ritual was then repeated every year. In the last decade or so, the celebration turned into an international event, with light shows by professional artists from all over the world. Those range from tiny installations in remote neighborhoods to massive sound-and-light shows, the largest one traditionally taking place on Place des Terreaux. The traditional celebration lives on, though: during the weeks preceding December 8th, the traditional candles and glasses are sold by shops all over town. This festival attracts around 4 million visitors every year. It now compares, in terms of attendance, to the Oktoberfest in Munich for example. Needless to say, accommodation for this period should be booked months in advance. You will also need good shoes (to avoid the crowd in the metro) and very warm clothes (it can be very cold at this time of year).
* The Roman theatres host various shows such as concerts (popular music, jazz, classical), dancing, theatre, and cinema. International artists who usually fill up much larger venues are often seduced by the special atmosphere of the theatres.
* An increasingly popular festival dedicated to electronic music, every year in May.

Music, dancing and opera
* The Lyon National Orchestra plays in this impressive, modern concert hall which also hosts some jazz and world music concerts.
* A theatre dedicated to modern dancing. Also a fine example of the architecture of the 1960s.
* The old opera house was completely redesigned by Jean Nouvel in the 1990s and hosts opera and dancing shows, along with a few other concerts (especially jazz) in the smaller "Amphithéâtre" room.
* The medium-sized hall (capacity 1,500) for rock or popular music concerts.

* The Stadium was built in 1926 and was the first stadium in Lyon.
* The local football (soccer) team have been national champions from 2002 through 2008 Olympique Lyonnais plays its home matches at Groupama Stadium. Their ladies' team also dominates the championship. They play at Gerland Stadium, built by Tony Garnier in the 1930s and renovated for the 1998 World Cup. Tickets are not too difficult to get, except for major European matches.

Theatre
Lyon has a large number of theatres ranging from tiny "cafés-théâtres" to big municipal institutions. You can enjoy any type of show from comedy to classical drama to avant-garde productions.
* It is a very nice way to spend an evening with a show (usually comedy), drinks, and food.
* The historical theatre beautifuly designed by Gaspard André in the 19th century. The building has an Italian-style facade. Behind the theater, in the middle of a quiet square, there is a strange periscope where you can see rotating geometric shapes, like a kaleidoscope. They were actually painted in the car park beneath the plaza by the famous artist Daniel Buren and they are reflected by a rotating mirror.
* Two rooms and talented young comedians.
* The other theatre with a more avant-garde program.
* Spend a time in an evening of laughter. The café-théâtre will help you.
* The largest Guignol theatre, showing original creations for children and adults. The 200-year-old Guignol is a very famous character in puppet theatre. This irreverent canut who frequently challenges the law in his adventures was created by Laurent Mourguet, a canut himself, in 1808. The main side characters in Guignol's shows are his wife Madelon, his Beaujolais-drinking friend Gnafron, and the policeman, who always ends up being ridiculous. It was the 1950s when Guignol became a children's favorite. Nowadays, a few theatres perpetuate the tradition for children and adults.
* Especially intended for children. This outdoor theatre is conveniently located within the park, near the lake and the zoo.
* This is the only theatre in Lyon showing popular comedies in the Parisian "boulevard" style.
* Jean Vilar's spirit of 'popular theatre' lives on in the historically left-wing Villeurbanne..

 Learn 
Lyon is an important university center. French language courses are available at Alliance Francaise Lyon-Bleu and Ecole Interculturelle de Francais 
* Alpadia runs one of his European language schools in Lyon (all year round French intensive language courses, exams preparations, and universities pathways to name a few).
* French/English Language Exchange event in Lyon, every week in some of the best venues across Lyon. Practice your French while having a good time meeting locals. Discover the format of 14 minutes of one-to-one conversations (7min in French, 7 min in English).
* Inflexyon the French Intercultural Center of Lyon where you can also pass French Language Diploma as DELF.

 Work 
Money can be made by giving private English lessons. Most French are keen to speak English. Some schools accept non-TEFL-qualified teachers, but obviously, a qualification helps. Try Berlitz or Demos. Several anglophone pubs employ young anglophone workers, occasionally with limited French. Speaking French to a reasonable level is often a must, even though bar vocabulary is limited. There is an ANPE next to the Opera on Rue de la Republique. Just go in, you don't have to book, and there are lots of job vacancies to be found. Also, search for a shelf with black folders on it. They contain details of better-paid jobs.

 Buy 
The usual hours for downtown shopping are 10AM-7PM, Monday through Saturday. Some larger places close a bit later at 7:30PM. Shops are closed on Sundays, except in December and in Vieux Lyon where Sunday is the busiest day of the week!
* Shopping mall with fashion stores, restaurants, and a cinema multiplex, in a developing suburban area.
* Parallel to rue Victor Hugo, this is where you will find most antique shops in Lyon.
* This pedestrian street is the main downtown shopping spot. Also, check out Rue du Président Edouard Herriot (more expensive in general) and Rue de Brest; these three streets run parallel to each other along Presqu'île.
* In the "golden square" between Place Bellecour and Place des Jacobins, you will find several famous luxury brands.
* Brand names and tourist traps south of Bellecour.
* A huge shopping mall with most major fashion brands. Avoid Saturday afternoons, the place is crowded.

Food

* A large Oriental shop, with all kinds of exotic foods, especially North African. In the heart of the picturesque Guillotière neighborhood.
* Very popular and typical market mith many local producers. On Tuesdays, also sells non-food items. Very crowded on sunny Sundays, but this is the right time to enjoy the particular mood of the neighborhood.
* Formerly located on Place des Cordeliers, the Halles moved to the Part-Dieu area in 1971. If you want the very best food, this is the right place to go. But it comes at a price.
* The other major market, in a wealthier part of town. Also some local fruit and vegetable producers. Eating oysters by the Saône is a very pleasant occupation before Sunday lunch.

 Eat 
Restaurants have their menus with prices displayed outside. As everywhere in France, the prices always include service, bread, and tap water (ask for a carafe of water). Tipping is rare and only expected if you are particularly satisfied with the service. This is especially true in budget or mid-range restaurants, maybe less so in expensive places where it may be considered more appropriate; nothing is compulsory, though. Typical tips depend, of course, on the price of the menu and your level of satisfaction but they are generally not as high as in the US. If you pay by credit card and wish to add a tip, you can tell the person in charge how much he/she should charge your card.

Meal times are generally 12PM-2PM for lunch and 7:30PM-10PM for dinner. Visitors from areas such as North America and Northern Europe might be surprised to find many places still closed at their usual dinner times. Places offering all-day service are located in tourist areas and are unlikely to serve quality fresh food. Late-night service is quite rare in quality restaurants, but you can always get the usual fast food or kebab.

The traditional restaurants in Lyon are called bouchons; the origin of the word is unclear (it means "cork"). They appeared at the end of the 19th century and flourished in the 1930s when the economic crisis forced wealthy families to fire their cooks, who opened their restaurants for working-class clientele. These women are referred to as mères (mothers); the most famous of them, Eugénie Brazier, became one of the first chefs to be awarded three stars (the highest ranking) by the famous Michelin gastronomic guide. She also had a young apprentice called Paul Bocuse. Eating in a good bouchon is certainly a must-do. They serve the typical local dishes:
* andouillette: sausage made with chopped tripes, usually served with a mustard sauce;
* cervelle de canut (cervelle' = ' brain): fresh cheese with garlic and herbs.
* gratin dauphinois: the traditional side dish, oven-cooked sliced potatoes with cream;
* quenelle de brochet: dumpling made of flour and egg with pike fish and a crayfish sauce (Nantua sauce);
* rognons de veau à la moutarde: veal kidneys in a mustard sauce. Delicious and textural experience.
* salade lyonnaise (Lyon salad): green salad with bacon cubes, croutons and a poached egg;
* saucisson chaud: a hot, boiled sausage; can be cooked with red wine (saucisson beaujolais) or in a bun (saucisson brioché);
* tablier de sapeur: marinated tripes coated with breadcrumbs then fried, even locals often hesitate before trying it.

These dishes are very tasty. They were originally workers' food, so they are generally fat and the portions are usually quite big. The quality is very variable since the bouchons are one of the main tourist attractions of the city. A good tip: never trust big signs reading Véritable bouchon lyonnais (genuine bouchon) or with a list of typical dishes on the front window. Those who need to write this are most often tourist traps. In tourist areas, most notably Rue St Jean, pay extra care and stick to trustworthy recommendations if possible. And if someone on the street tries to get you into a restaurant, run away. A good bouchon, however, offers very good value for money.

In bouchons and other lower - to mid-range restaurants, basic wines can be served by the pot, a typical bottle containing 46 cl and filled from a cask or wine box. The smaller fillette (little girl) contains 28 cl. This is cheaper than a 75-cl bottle, but the quality is not always guaranteed.

Lyon was named the capital of gastronomy by the great gastronomic writer Curnonsky in 1935. At that time there were no exotic restaurants, no diets and nobody was talking about fusion cuisine or bistronomy. Fortunately, the local gastronomy has considerably evolved since then and there is now far more to dining in Lyon than the bouchons. Kebab shops, Asian food, bistros, three-star restaurants: Lyon has them all. 

The locals are generally fond of eating out and the best places get known quickly by word of mouth. Moreover, the restaurants are quite small on average. It is strongly advised to book a table, especially for dinner, otherwise, you may end up in one of the multiple tourist traps. Since many good local chefs seem to enjoy a good family weekend, there are a lot more interesting options on weekdays.

Bakeries
* Many bakeries offer good quality sandwiches, made with fresh baguette of course.
* In this small bakery, you will find good praline tarts, a popular local dessert.
* Superb baguettes, excellent sandwiches, and pastries. Eat-in or take away, gets rather busy around lunchtime.
* 
* 

Budget
* A traditional bouchon (restaurant) with good food for a very reasonable price.
* 
* 
* Look especially near Place des Terreaux (M: Hôtel de Ville).
* A typical French restaurant where the atmosphere is friendly. You will enjoy the large range of wine, the menu explanation, and the wine suggestions of the waiter. English speaking/menu in English. Terrace in summer.
* If you're looking for something other than French food, this Chinese hotpot is worth trying. The all-you-can-eat lunch includes your own hotpot, a warm meal, drinks, and desserts. The place is packed with Chinese customers, which should tell you enough.

Mid-range
* Croix-Rousse has more and more interesting restaurants, and this one is a fine example. In a "flea-market-meets-art-gallery" decor, you will enjoy a fresh and creative cuisine with Mediterranean and Asian influences. The nice wine list and it is still possible to get a table at relatively short notice.
* An exceptional traditional Brewery, serving traditional food with an Alsatian leaning in a fine interior. A real Art Deco treat. Founded in 1836, with a tradition of high-quality service. It also contains a brewery and bar and the interior is worth a look even if you don't want to eat.
* A very good bouchon serving huge portions. Noisy and friendly.
* Traditional local cuisine, but the place is more comfortable than a bouchon. Delicious, genuine, homemade dishes served in very large quantities, and a very good wine list favoring the locals - a very good place to taste the real Beaujolais. Upon reservation, the restaurant can accommodate quite large groups.
* Small no-tourist restaurant in a no-tourist area. Friendly, professional service, short menu but very creative, high-quality cooking. Good (although short) wine list. The best bottles are at amazingly low prices given their "constant mark-up" policy.
* In another street full of tourist traps, this restaurant offers very good, classical local and French cuisine. Try the grenouilles (frogs). Very nice terrace. Good wine list at interesting prices.
* This restaurant serves traditional French cuisine made from very good and very fresh products, with a Mediterranean influence. The chocolate fondant dessert is amazing. Very good wine list too. The lunch menu is an absolute steal.
* Very good classic French cuisine, made from quality products, in a nice decor. One of the best places in the area.
* 
* A brasserie owned by Paul Bocuse, near the river Saône. The specialties are fish and the cuisine of the Caribbean.
* Cozy place. Great selection of wines. A small but complete menu in tapas style and homemade bread is served there.

Splurge
* If you can book at least two months in advance and are ready for a "surprise" menu, this tiny place (16 seats!) run by Japanese chef Tsuyoshi Arai is a rather unique experience. Just tell your waiter what you don't like or can't eat, and you will be served a five or nine-course menu that changes every day. The cuisine is French with Japanese hints, amazingly creative, and most importantly, it's delicious.
* The restaurant opened in 1921 by the legendary Eugénie Brazier was recently taken over by the talented young chef Mathieu Viannay and awarded 2 stars by the Michelin guide only a few months after its opening. An all-time classic revisited (Bresse poultry with truffles, artichokes with foie gras).
* One of the best places in Lyon, in a 17th century building on a lovely island on the Saône.
* Prestigeous cuisine.
* A new address for a well-recognized chef. The previous restaurant had a classic dining room on the banks of the Saône. Têtedoie is now taking his restaurant to the next level with a prestigious location offering one of the best views in the town and very contemporary decor, with the same culinary spirit and prices. The wine list is so big they have to carry it around on a trolley. The place also features a wine bar, a "bistro-style" terrace (€40/50) and an Italian restaurant.

Drink
Lyon offers some nice nightlife. A good starting point is Place des Terreaux and then upwards towards the Croix Rousse. In the streets that climb the hill, there are many nice places.
* This tiny shop has an exceptional selection of wines from all over the world. Very interesting selection of Rhône Valley wines and, an amazing collection of old Burgundies. Very reasonable prices. Also a must-see for port amateurs, with the largest selection in France and prices ranging from €12 to €3,000.
* This wine store is specialized in organic and natural wines. It is also a wine bar, all bottles of the shop can be drunk there with a price supplement of €6.

Bars
* This is a genuine cocktail bar they know their cocktails. A cozy atmosphere and friendly staff.
* 
* 
* The name means The Drunk Parrot. There is cheap rum, the inside is decorated as a pirate ship.
* There you can join some crazy French listening to crazy French music. An experience, though not everyone's cup of tea.
* 
* 
* 
* This nice pub is a good spot for drinks and live sports, but also serves good British and French food in large portions.

Boats
At the Quai Albert Augagneur is another center of Lyon nightlife. Along the Rhone River are several out-of-duty riverboats (péniches) that serve as nightclubs or bars.
* There you will get nice alternative hip-hop, retro soul, etc. Sometimes theatre performances.
* A musical and festive bar created in 2002 on a barge moored on the banks of the Rhône. Live events almost every day of the week. On weekends, there are two dance floors with all kinds of music. No dress code! Nice.
* Another boat, the hype crowd will feel at home.

Cafe
* 
* Also there are bike rentals and tours.
* 
* 
* 
* Delicious ice cream with very original flavors, served on a very pleasant terrace. Completely overcrowded on sunny weekends, so be prepared to queue but it is worth the wait if you are a real ice cream fan.

Live music
* Community bar, nice music, affro, dance hall, Latin! Good atmosphere. Open until very late.
* This is a modern-day institution in Lyon. Ninkasi has two places for live music: Kafé (free shows, essentially electronic music) and Kao (a concert hall dedicated to rock and electronic music). It is also a beer brewery and has bars all over the Presqu'île, and also in Villeurbanne.

Pubs
Foreign students often gather in English or Irish pubs, which are more particularly concentrated in the Vieux Lyon area. English-speaking staff everywhere.
* Beer, whiskey and rock. The best pub quiz in Lyon.
* There is a great experience to watch the sports events. The dishes are delicious. The prices are very reasonable.
* Nice, an authentic Irish pub with good music and some live performances.
* Irish pub, live music on Saturday, Irish music sessions on Thursday, quiz every Monday, pool, darts, Irish and English pub food, air conditioning.
* Perfect little pub in the Croix-Rousse area, off the beaten path. Live music sessions every Thursday, Pub Quiz on Tuesdays.
* English pub, quiz on Tuesdays. Air conditioning.

Wine bars

Lyon is certainly a great starting point to explore the French vineyards: Beaujolais, Burgundy, Rhône Valley, and the less-known Jura, Savoie, and Bugey are all within a two-hour drive. It is therefore unsurprising to see an increasing number of wine bars in Lyon. Here are a few addresses.
* Opened over 20 years ago by "Jeannot", the picturesque and loud-mouthed owner of the other bar next door, this small and friendly wine bar has built a wide and interesting selection of several hundred wines over the years. Of course, the locals are well represented (Beaujolais, Burgundy, Rhône Valley) but the list also keeps expanding geographically. Also serves some quality food: ham, sausages, and cheese.

 Sleep 
It is usually not difficult to find a hotel room in Lyon, except for the Fête des Lumières and during some important professional trade shows like SIRHA (food, hotels, and restaurants) and POLLUTEC (environment technology), when every last room in and around Lyon is booked. The dates of those events can be found on the exhibition center's website 

Budget

Splurge
* Located in an exceptional 14th-century building in the heart of the old town.
* Set a block from La Saône River in a 19th-century townhouse. The rooms are uniquely decorated.
* The majestic Hôtel-Dieu was the oldest hospital in Lyon and is one of the largest buildings in Presqu'île. The facade along the river Rhône is over 300 m (984 ft) long. The first hospital was built in 1184-1185; it was modified several times before Soufflot designed the current building, built from 1741 to 1761. The large dome was completed in 1765. The newly built Grange Blanche hospital (today Edouard Herriot) became the main medical center in the city in the 1930s. Hôtel-Dieu doctors were pioneers in numerous specialties, including radiology (Etienne Destot), oncology (Léon Bérard), surgery (Joseph Gensoul, Matthieu Jaboulay) and orthopedics (Louis Léopold Ollier); they contributed in making Lyon the second medical center in the country after Paris. The building no longer fits the needs of modern medicine, therefore the hospital was closed down in 2010. So, now there is a hotel.
* Luxury hotel close to the famous Place Bellecour. A large number of meeting rooms for conventions.

Stay safe
Real security problems in the Lyon center are rare, but the usual advice applies.

Rue Ste Catherine, behind Place des Terreaux, is locally famous for its bars; on weekend nights there are a lot of drunk people on the street, who might be violent. The police keep a close watch but it is probably better to avoid the area if you are on your own, especially after 3AM when the bars are closed. Similar problems may be encountered in Vieux Lyon.

In populated places such as Rue de la République or outside Part-Dieu station, you may come across people advertising for charities; they can be recognized by their specific, colored clothing. They will not ask you for money but rather give you information documents that encourage you to donate. Homeless people sell newspapers such as Macadam or Sans-abri which help them make some money without begging; they should have an ID card issued by the editors. But there are also people trying to trick you into getting money for some imaginary charity, sometimes by selling postcards or other items. Never give money directly to someone on the street who claims to be working for charity and does not have official documents, or if the documents look doubtful.

When in the metro, particularly at Part-Dieu station near the main train station, you may be approached by people trying to sell you metro tickets. Ignore them and use the ticket machines (which can be set to several different languages for your ease of use) or ask a metro employee for assistance.
