* Kororipo Pa stands at the head of the Kerikeri Inlet which was known as Te Waha o te Riri (the inlet of war) not long after the missionaries arrived. It was once once Hongi Hika’s fortressed pa, and fishing village.

* Steam Driven Sawmill, not quite perpetual motion, but this mill provides its own fuel and is a great favourite with tourists and steam engine buffs alike. The whole mill is powered by a large steam plant which is fired by waste wood from the trees being milled. 

*Art Gallery of NZ and internationally acclaimed artists. Focus on printmaking.

Do

Although the water at the Stone Store basin is part of the Bay of Islands where overseas yachties tie up regularly, especially in the hurricane season, Kerikeri township does not have a beach. But not too far away there are wonderful swimming beaches, at Matauri Bay which boasts impressive views of the Cavalli Islands, Te Ngaere and Tapuaetahi. 

* Fishing. The Bay Of Islands has been renowned for its big-game fishing since American author Zane Gray put it on the map in the 1930s. But there are smaller fish in the bay as well, and charter operators are busy all year round.

* Swimming. As well as the marvellous nearby beaches, and various places to swim in the Kerikeri River like the Fairy Pools, Kerikeri has a modern swimming pool with diving facilities. Sited at the Kerikeri High School, it is a community pool. 

* Walks. There are lovely walks at Kerikeri and several others in the district. The 4 km stroll from the Stone Store to Rainbow Falls can be undertaken by most people.

Another fine walk is from opposite St James Church to the Fairy Pools past Wharepoke Falls on the south bank of the Kerikeri River. The Fairy Pools can also be reached via a track from the Youth Hostel.
:* Fairy pools, These delightful pools were given to the nation by Caroline Little who was captivated by them in 1928 on her first visit from China.
