Brasília, the capital of and the seat of government of the , is a planned city. Inaugurated in 1960 in the Central Highlands of Brazil, it is a masterpiece of modernist architecture listed as a by UNESCO and attracts architecture aficionados worldwide. Brasilia is also an important transportation hub for travel within Brazil.

Understand

The basic structure of Brasilia was completed in just four years, from 1956 to 1960, under the leadership of President Juscelino Kubitschek, with the slogan "fifty years of progress in five", and the city is in a sense a memorial to him. The cathedral has six columns representing two hands reaching up to almighty heaven.

The city is designed in the shape of a giant bird or airplane, with various separated zones assigned for specific functions such as housing, commerce, hospitals and banking. Running down the center of the "airplane's" fuselage is the thoroughfare called the Eixo Monumental ("Monumental Axis") and at one end lay the government buildings. The arched "wings" are residential zones, with several rows of medium-rise apartment blocks with small commercial districts. The intersection is the commercial and cultural hub, with stores, hotels, and the cathedral. A huge artificial lake serves the city as both a leisure area and to diminish the effects of low humidity in drier months (see Climate below).

Fifty-three years after its creation (1960), Brasilia is still developing a culture of its own. The city has often been criticized as a failed utopia where rationalized modernist planning has buried the human element. Yet Brazilians are quite proud of their capital, embodying a vision of a future when Brazil is no longer considered merely a "developing" country.

Orientation and addresses

Getting a grasp of Brasilia's addresses may be a little perplexing at first, as they are usually shortened to acronyms. Here are some useful tips:

The Monumental Axis divides the city into north and south sectors. Acronyms ended in N refer to sectors on the northern side, while those ended in S are on the south.
* SHS/SHN - Hotel sectors (Setor Hoteleiro)
* SCS/SCN - Commercial sectors (Setor Comercial)
* SQS/SQN - Residential sectors (Superquadras)
* CLS/CLN (or SCLS/SCLN) - Local commerce sectors (Comércio Local) along the wings.
* SES/SEN - Embassies sector (Setor de Embaixadas)

Climate
Temperatures seldom hit extremes. 17°C to 28°C (63 to 82°F) are the average lows and highs, but it can get as low as 1°C (34°F) in winter and get as hot as 34°C (92°F) in September/October. In dry season (August–September) the city's landscape, normally very green, becomes desert-like and everyone must drink lots of water to prevent the unpleasant effects of dehydration. On the other hand, during those months the city is blessed with a gorgeous sunset in spectacular shades of orange, pink and red. The best months to go are probably May and June - still green, but no longer so hot, with fewer chances of rainfall.

Tourist information
Official tourist info can be obtained from State Secretariat of Tourism of the Distrito Federal (in Portuguese).
There are also stands in the airport, the new rodoviaria and the Praça dos Três Poderes.

Get in
By plane
Due to long distances and falling prices in air travel, flying has become a practical way of getting to Brasilia. The city is a national air travel hub, and there should be plenty of flights. In fact you may find your plane touching down at Brasilia airport even if you're not starting or ending anywhere near, such as to . On the other hand, despite being a major international capital, getting in directly from abroad is difficult in most cases. Most flights are domestic, and you will have to go through Brazilian customs and immigration elsewhere and re-board. However, there are currently several international non-stop flights from: (TAM), (Aerolineas Argentinas), (Air France), (TAP Portugal), (AviancaTaca) (TAM Brazil) and (American Airlines), (COPA), (Pluna), (Amaszonas Airlines), (Delta Airlines), (TAM), and seasonal to and (GOL).

Presidente Juscelino Kubitschek International Airport (), Brasília's airport (phone:+55 61 3364-9000, fax: +55 61 3364-9251), is situated 11&nbsp;km (7&nbsp;mi) from the city center and has one of the few tourist information services in town (phone +55 61 3033.9488, from 7:30AM-10:30PM). It also has an exchange office at the arrivals area, another one at Banco do Brasil (open Mo-Fri 11:00-16:00, departures area) and several ATMs.

There is an Executive Bus from airport to hotel zone and the central region for R$10.

Taxis are annother convenient means of getting from the airport into the city. They are relatively expensive for Brazilian standards and the 20-minute drive to the hotel zone should cost about R$30–40. Regular buses number 102 and 102.1 are frequent and significantly cheaper. They link the airport to the main bus terminal at Rodoviária, from where you can catch buses or the subway to other parts of the city.

By bus
Due to its central location, Brasilia is well served by a bus network that connects it with the rest of Brazil. Travel times are about 15 hours from , 18 hours from , 10 hours from and 3 hours from . Buses from other states arrive at a dedicated bus station called rodoviária (phone:+55 61 3234-2185), that is located at the central road (EPIA) and is connected to the city center by bus (number 131, frequency each 10–20 minutes, from 5AM to midnight) and taxis.

By car
Drivers coming from southern and Center-west states will arrive by the Saída Sul entrance. From other states, you'll enter Brasilia by Saída Norte. After you're inside the Federal District, keep following the Brasília indicating traffic signs and Zona Central if you're staying at the hotel sector.
The Eixo Rodoviário Road, that crosses the city's south, central, and north sectors, can be identified by the characteristics double strip of yellow raised pavement markers (Cat's eye) separating the two lanes of the road.

Get around

Rent a car, ride the buses, take a cab, hitchhike, but whatever you do, don't plan on getting around Brasilia on foot. The city was designed under the assumption that every resident would own use public transport considering the population a quarter of it is today. Obviously things didn't turn out that way, and the city's public transport is not quite a solution to an almost deliberately designed problem. Fortunately it works fairly well some hours of the day. Note that the roads have few crosswalks or traffic lights, so being a pedestrian also requires some caution.

By bus
Most local buses start from or go through the rodovi&aacute;ria, at the precise center of the city, and run along the "wings" - serving the residential zones - or through the Monumental Axis.
Some bus lines are very useful for moving around, as they link the central area of Brasilia (Setor Comercial, Setor de Diversões etc.) to Esplanada dos Ministérios, the airport and some of the main avenues (L2 and W3). These used to be stripped red-and-white buses called "zebrinhas" (little zebras) but now they are only distinguished from other bus lines by their numbers.

Unlike many other Brazilian cities, passengers in Brasilia board buses by the front door. Buses must be flagged, otherwise they will only stop when a passenger requests to hop off.
Single fares are R$3.00 for travel within Brasília. There is no advance sale of tickets, pay as you board.

By taxi
Taxis are relatively expensive in Brasilia and usually cannot be hailed on the streets. Taxi stands, however, are close to all tourist attractions and any hotel will be able to call a cab or provide the phone number of the best known dispatch offices. All taxis must have taximeters and can start charging only after the passenger has boarded. When arriving at Brasilia airport, taxis are located immediately outside the arrival terminal. Although the airport is not far from downtown Brasilia, taxi prices are expensive compared to other cities in Brazil, and often there can be a long wait before a taxi become available. Pre-booking taxis or airport transfers is possible, although somewhat limited, through companies such as Brazil Airport Transfers. UberX is recommended to going anywhere when less than 05$, otherwise, mix it with buses and subway.

By subway
The Metrô subway system started operating in 2001. Its Y-shaped line starts in the main bus station (Rodoviária de Brasília - "Central" station) and makes its first stop at Setor Comercial Sul ("Galeria" station), which is fairly near some hotels South of Monumental Axis. It runs along the south wing, stopping at blocks 102, 108, 112 and 114, then going through suburbs. The subway uses to operate 6AM-11:30PM from Monday to Friday (some stations stop selling tickets at 10:30PM), and from 7AM-7PM on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. Its common to be offered special timelines on some holidays, like New Year's Eve and the April 21st (city's anniversary).

It's not particularly useful for tourists, as it does not visit the main attractions but does stop at attractions such as the Buddhist Temple (EQS 115/116, access by "114 Sul" Station). Single fare: R$5.00 (R$3.80 with the rechargeable metro card). Some stops are still under construction (Jun 2018) and are indicated with a black dot (as opposed to white dot) on the metro map.

Before going on the subway remember to have pocket money in small bills or coins - the Metro doesn't accept credit cards and won't give change above R$20.

By car
If you are not using "city tour" services, it would be a good idea to have a car available. The urbanistic plan of Brasilia was highly based on individual motorized transportation, so it is not surprising that a visit to the city will be much more pleasing having a car.

Unlike other Brazilian big cities, traffic in Brasilia is not a major problem, although there are some jams during rush hours.

There are public parking lots available at main sites, although it can be hard to find spots sometimes. As in other Brazilian towns, there usually are some "watchers", people that offers to watch your car (supposedly to protect it from robbers), expecting to get some money in return; they usually behave like beggars, although they can turn violent towards the cars if not paid, scratching or chipping the paint job, so it would avoid some trouble to just give a little money, something around 2 reais. If it bothers you, you can always park your car a little further from the main destinations, where there are no watchers, or in a paid garage, when available.

Also, drivers behave a little differently than in other places in Brazil:
* Stop at pedestrian crossings - pedestrians will wave a hand before crossing or usually simply start walking. Keep an eye on the sidewalks at all times. Policemen enforce this rule and you can get fined if you disrespect it. Other cities are beginning to enforce this law as well.
* Use of horns - do not honk unless you really need to for safety reasons. Brasilienses hate it and really appreciate their driving to be as silent as possible.
It is paramount to have a detailed map in hand when driving through the city, especially in the central area. It is far more convenient to have a good GPS system or using of Waze and Google Maps, because the access of some streets can be confusing, as there are lots of elevated interchanges and ramps. Do not expect the signs to be clear and ubiquitous, there are no signs telling you on what avenue you are on and streets rarely intersect. Smaller streets do not have names as they are defined by being between this and that square. This said, once you have understood the logic that rules ramps and intersections, theoretically you can throw your map away.

City Center

* With its sixteen curved 90-ton concrete pillars and stained-glass panels, is one of the world's most amazing modernist buildings.
* Brasilia's museum built to be the city's home for renowned national and international exhibitions. As of 2012, the outside space has become a regular venue to free concerts and events, and very popular for skating, but its collections are temporary and severely lacking both in size and importance. However, give it a try, it's free.
* Interesting permanent display of historical items. Usually holds photography, musical concerts, movies and contemporary arts exhibitions. Entrance is free most of the time.
* Daily, Brazilian National Congress offers a guided visit. It starts every half hour from 9AM, in Salão Negro (access the main ramp). It lasts for 50 minutes. Note that you cannot enter wearing shorts and slippers from monday to friday.
* A gallery that has many works of contemporary art. Mostly sculpture and paintings.
* Houses the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and stands out among the ministry buildings at Esplanada dos Ministérios for its beautiful architecture and sculptures.
* Museum dedicated to the life and accomplishments of the president, and houses his remains as well. It's located underground and has a slightly spooky 1960's science-fiction feel to it.
* Brasilia's main theatre features 3 main halls for plays and concerts, art galleries and temporary art exhibitions.
* The President's official residence, by the Paranoá lake. Not open to visitors. Its arches are icons of the capital.
* The façade has waterfalls that contrast with its stern geometrical beauty.
* Some of the finest Brazilian artists have created works in Brasilia: Burle Marx (landscape design), Athos Bulcão (geometric tile panels), Oscar Niemeyer (buildings and sculptures) Ceschiatti and Bruno Giorgio (sculptures). These can be seen on the streets, open air and for free.
* In the middle of the Monumental axis, it used to be the best place for a sweeping panorama of the city, until the opening of the new Digital Tower. It's the second best now. There is also a crafts and typical food market at the base of the tower.
* Includes the seats of the country's 3 highest authorities: the Congress, the Presidential Palace (called Palácio do Planalto) and the Supreme Court. The axis itself is aligned such that on April 21 (Tiradentes Day, marking the death of the Brazilian independence martyr), the sun rises precisely between the two towers of Congress. The bronze statue of two abstract figures is named Os Candangos and represents the pioneering spirit of the workers who built the city. There's also a "blind justice" statue by the Supreme Court, a small museum about Juscelino Kubitschek, the Pantheon, the Eternal Flame monument, and a model, built to scale, of Brasilia itself, in an underground space.

Along the Wings

* Holds all kinds of exhibitions and cultural events. Russian paintings, musical concerts, documentaries, plays, thematic movie festivals, photography, you name it. There is no permanent exhibition or attraction so you've to check the program before going or just go there and enjoy what's available. The easier way to reach it is through its own free bus line that runs from the city center and back.
* This wide green area is the city's hot spot for sports such as jogging, cycling, skating and even kart racing, as well as barbecues and other outdoor activities.
* A government-maintaned building for cultural events. Commonly used for musical concerts and plays. No official schedule available.
* Known as 'Igrejinha' (Little Church).
* Pontoon has lakeside restaurants and a park while the Ermida Dom Bosco (near SHIS QI 29, bus line 100/123) chapel provides gorgeous views of the city from across the Lake, an excellent place to watch Brasilia's famous sunsets. You can swim in the lake at the Ecological Park next to the Ermida.
* A park in the northern wing of the city that is mainly used for jogging. It also has many springs, streams and a small pond. Many of its facilities include a playground and two outdoor gyms.
* Beautiful modern church built on concrete and blue stained glass. Bosco was a 19th-century Italian priest whose writings, some say, prophesied the creation of Brasilia. It's impossible not to notice the huge crystal chandelier hanging from the ceiling in the middle of the square church.
* Features very interesting modern architecture, from the 60s until the 2010s. Its Olympic Center is by the lake; not much visited by tourists, but has some nice options for hiking/jogging/swimming. Also, large public university known for programs in science, international relations & mathematics.

Outside the wings
* A waterfall forming beautiful blue pools on a quartz rock.
* Vegetation and fauna, plus natural swimming pools.
* monument, chapel, and park on the edge of the lake, dedicated to an Italian monk who prophesied the construction of a new civilization at the site of Brasilia.

Two glass observatories complete the structure. The highest one, 80 m above the floor, will contain a restaurant with a panoramic view. The other one will be used as an art gallery.

Do
* Cinema Festival - Brasilia hosts one of the most important festivals of Brazilian cinema.

* State Secretary of Culture of the Distrito Federal | Agenda - The biggest cultural schedule of Brasilia. It keeps track of all exhibitions and shows playing in the city. You can choose the listings by month or type of attraction or see the complete schedule for the current month.

Sports
* Basketball - If you happen to be in Brasilia between January and June, you should not miss the games of Brasilia's home team Universo BRB for the national league of basketball. Runner-up of the 2009 season, Universo is well known for playing great games and drawing a big audience (for Brazilian standards), which peaked 11.000 people during the 2009 finals. The season games happens in 'Clube da CEB' (CEB's club), at SGAS 904. Ticket costs R$10.00. If you actually want to play basketball, the city's park has plenty of courts available for public use. Your best chance to catch some locals playing is going on the weekends.
* 
* Jogging - Brasilia's most popular sport by far. There are running tracks in the National Park and in the City's Park. The Eixo Rodoviario road is closed to traffic on Sundays (8h-18h) and can be also used for jogging, cycling and skating. Jogging on weekends in the City's Park is one the most popular activities among locals. Don't miss the coconut water vendors. Besides that, 5&nbsp;km and 10&nbsp;km races happens almost bi-monthly.
* Wakeboard - Wakescola de Brasília. The only wakeboard school in the city. Tel +55 61 3380-2171 / +55 61 9982-3562. Expensive.

Buy
Brasilia's residential wings have many local shops such as groceries, drugstores, bakers, restaurants, hairdressers and so forth, and that is where townspeople do much of their daily shopping. The now somewhat decadent W3 avenue used to be the equivalent of a city's high street and still concentrates a large portion of the city's street commerce. Shopping malls, however, also play an important part when it comes to shopping in town.

* The Setor de Diversões is a fairly nice shopping area at the center of the city, very close to Rodoviaria. The northern side, called Conjunto Nacional, is a bit more upscale, while the southern side has interesting small shops with books, music, and clothing that appeal to the local skateboard-riding youths. Notice that this southern side at night is very dangerous, being the favorite spot for hookers and drug dealers.

* On Sundays there is a flea market at the base of the Television Tower. Half of the stands are also open during the week and you can get local crafts and souvenirs hard to find in shopping malls.

Some off-center places can also be of interest for travellers:
* The imports market (popularly known as Feira do Paraguai) is the place to go for cheap electronics (cameras and replacement accessories, batteries etc.) and other travel items such as backpacks, flashlights and so forth. From Rodoviaria, take bus 124.2 (shorter trip) or bus 124.
* Records and books - FNAC, at the Parkshopping mall has a good assortment of English-language travel guides and Brazilian music CDs. Livraria Cultura, at the Casa Park mall, has bilingual staff and an extensive collection of Brazilian CDs and foreign-language literature (especially in English, French, Spanish, Italian and German). Both malls are close to each other and can be easily reached by subway through the (almost self-explanatory named) Shopping station.

Eat
Brasilia does not have a traditional, regional cuisine. Nevertheless, restaurants serve food from many Brazilian states, as well as international fare.
Self-service (por quilo) restaurants are very common and usually cheaper than their à la carte counterparts. 
Most of Brasilia's "real" (table service) restaurants are located at the residential wings, usually a bus or taxi ride away from most tourist attractions. One of the most popular streets is the CLS 405 (from rodoviaria, take bus 114), with choices ranging from sushi to Brazilian, Mexican and French food.
Regarding tips, visitors are expected to pay at least 10% of the bill. Such amount is commonly printed on the invoice and most of the time it's OK to include the tip in your credit/debit card since most of the restaurants share the total amount with all employees. Self-service restaurants usually don't charge tips.

Budget
* A convenient place for finding reasonably priced food is the food court of the Conjunto Nacional mall (also see Buy, above). The mall is located right beside the main bus terminal (rodoviaria) and at walking distance from many hotels and of the main attractions such as the Three Powers Square.

* Arrumadinho - CLN413 Bloco E. This is the place to taste the best of Northeastern food at a very reasonable price. Arrumadinho and Feijaozinho are the specialties of the houve.

* SCLS 201. Right beside Banco Central's main building, this street is packed with cheap self-service restaurants and a few ranging from mid-range to splurge. 
* Local chain Giraffas (several locations around town) rivals McDonalds in the fast food market by serving sandwiches and cheap beef/chicken + rice-and-beans set meals.

Although the city's music scene is no longer as vibrant as it was in the 80s - when it bred some of the greatest pop/rock talents of recent generations with bands like Capital Inicial and Legião Urbana - live shows of local bands are frequent. Daily listings in Portuguese can be found at the local newspapers or the Correioweb and Candango websites.

Sleep
Most of the city's accommodation is located at the Hotel Sectors (SHS and SHN), two central areas located on both sides of Eixo Monumental. During weekdays, hotels are usually busy due to the capital's political activity and it is advisable to book in advance. Typical prices are R$200 for a double room and R$95 for a single. Most ot the hotels have an off-price for the weekends.

Many simple pousadas are located at W3 Sul avenue. They are often non-regulated by tourist authorities and their quality and security may vary greatly. In 2008, the local authorities shut these pousadas; do not rely on them existing anymore.

Designed by Oscar Neimeyer and inaugurated in 1958, this hotel completes the Brasilia/Neimeyer experience. It was the first hotel in the city. Recently revamped maintaining the strict modernist 60's style.

Always remember though, never show off any of your 'splurging'. Not only will this be considered as an insult to less fortunate citizens, you will be an advertising for a mugging.

Stay safe
Brasilia is (somewhat) a safe city, but usual measures should be taken. At night, the area near the central bus station is not considered to be safe (prostitution and drugs). Avoid walking alone at night throughout the city.

There are an increasing number of cases of "flash kidnap". This consists of attacking people near or inside their own car, robbing and getting away with the car, and sometimes driving with the owner to make them withdraw money from automatic cash machines or even committing other kinds of violence. The local Police give some advice on how to avoid these crimes:

* Try to walk with company, avoiding deserted places or those with bad illumination. Be aware of people approaching to ask for information, especially during the night;

* When coming out of a bank, verify if you are being followed or if there are suspicious people near the vehicle;

* Approaching your car, have the keys ready, to make it easier to get into the car;

* Going home (or to your hotel), do not park immediately. Watch the sides of the buildings and corners and only then stop the vehicle. Do not react to any kind of crime, as the criminals do not act alone.

Police officers are usually polite, but as they have to deal with considerable violence they might appear harsh in situations when they have to be alert. Respect is the key for good interaction. In case of police intervention at a crime (i.e. when they withdraw their guns), lay down on the floor and put your hands on your head and don't make any subtle movement. Do not react if searched. Follow instructions and, as it is possible, inform someone of your situation by phone.

To get police assistance, dial 190 in any public or private phone. For medical emergency, dial 192. Be mindful that English-speaking operators may not readily available, and you will be facing a language barrier.

Although drug consumption does not lead to incarceration, it is still a crime in Brazil, and being caught with small amounts of illegal substances may lead to bureaucratic complications when leaving the country. Selling or transporting drugs for use of others is considered trafficking, a very serious crime, and will lead to severe consequences. So, do not use or carry drugs of any kind.

Connect
The area code to Brasilia and region is 61 (also add Brazil's 55 if dialing from abroad). All 7-digit telephone numbers have recently been converted to 8-digit by adding a 3 before the number. To reach a number like 241-0000 from abroad, dial +55 61 3241-0000.
