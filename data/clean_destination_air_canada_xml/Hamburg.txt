The city of Hamburg has a well-deserved reputation as 's Gateway to the World. It is the country's biggest port and the second-busiest in Europe, despite being located astride the River Elbe, some 100 kilometres from the North Sea. It is also Germany's second largest city with a population of over 1.8 million and the Greater Hamburg Metropolitan Region has a population of over four million. Hamburg is proud of its status as a "Free and Hanseatic City" and thus shares the same status as a province, making up one of Germany's 16 federal-states or Bundesländer.

Understand

It values its status as being as independent as possible of other states that have existed or currently exist in Germany. Over the centuries, Hamburg has always been an international city. This is not only because of its position in international trade, but also in political dimensions.

One of the most important harbours in and the world, Hamburg takes great pride in its mercantile background, which built the city's wealth in the past centuries. From 1241 on, it was a founding member of the Hanseatic League, a medieval trade monopoly across Northern Europe. In the 19th and beginning of the 20th century, millions left Europe on their way to the new world through the Hamburg harbour. Today, the harbour ranks second in Europe and eleventh world-wide. Consequently, one of Hamburg's tag lines is "The Gateway to the World" (derived from the city’s coat of arms, showing a white city wall with a gate and crowned by three towers on a red background). Hamburg is known to be one of the richest metropolitan area in the European Union, in the company of and .

The harbor is the heart of the city, however, Hamburg is also one of the most important media hubs in Germany. Half of the nation's newspapers and magazines have their roots in Hamburg. And, unknown even to some locals, is the fact that, with one of the Airbus aircraft assembly plants, Hamburg is a major location of the world's aerospace industry, right after Seattle (USA) and Toulouse (France).

The mercantile background reflects in the city's architecture. The most notable palace in Hamburg is the town hall, which houses the citizen's parliament and the senate. The only other palace of the city is located in the urban district of Bergedorf. Apart from that, the city has a few impressive mansions in public parks and still has large quarters with expensive houses and villas. These residences were home to merchants and captains, surrounded by lots of greenery. Large parts of the city were destroyed during the devastating air raids of World War II, particularly the port and some residential areas, killing tens of thousands and leaving more than a million homeless, yet much of historic value has been preserved, although not as much as people would have wished for, as like many German cities,it's cursed by horrible post war buildings and disgusting office blocks.

Hamburg still keeps its tradition of being an open, yet discreet city. Citizens of Hamburg, just like most Northern Germans, may appear to be quite reserved at first. Once they get to know with whom they are dealing, they'll be as warm and friendly as you'd wish.

The people of Hamburg are known as "Hamburger" (pronounce the a like you're saying "ah", and it won't sound as silly). The beef patties on a bun were named after this city, where presumably they were invented. See also "frankfurter" () and "wiener" (Wien, aka ).

Get in

By plane 

Airport Hamburg-Fuhlsbüttel () ()
Hamburg has the fifth-largest international airport in Germany, so arrival by plane is an obvious choice for those visiting from far away. There are plenty of connections within Europe, although only a few intercontinental direct services are offered. 
Low cost carriers Ryanair & Wizzair, as of autumn 2016, operate flights to a host of european destinations including (but not limited to) London Stansted (England), Shannon and Dublin (Ireland), Glasgow Prestwick (Scotland), Stockholm Skavsta (Sweden), Milan Bergamo (Italy), Pisa (Italy), Kiev (Ukraine), Sofia (Bulgaria), Skopje (Macedonia) and Gdansk (Poland). 
The airport has been thoroughly modernized with new terminals, airport hotel, streamlined infrastructure, and facilities that are by and large adequate, so you won't get lost. Depending on the gate your flight arrives at or leaves from, walking longer distances might be necessary as on any other airport too.

Hamburg Airport is connected to the city by the S-Bahn S1 commuter train line, which connects to the Central Station (Hauptbahnhof) and the city centre in about 30 minutes. There are trains every 10-20 minutes, and a single fare is €3.30. Beware on the way back from the city centre to the airport: All trains are divided at Ohlsdorf, with only the first three cars going to the airport, and the rest going to the suburb of Poppenbüttel. There are no trains between midnight and 4 AM, but a bus runs along the same route. As there aren't any flights between 11PM and 6AM this may not affect your journey at all. Train timetable S1: 

The airport, which is hugely popular with plane-spotters, is surrounded by Schrebergärten (meticulously maintained allotments), park lands, and open green spaces, crisscrossed by bicycle and walking trails. The popularity of this area is not only due to the many viewpoints, but also because Lufthansa Technik (Lufthansa's maintenance service) operates some large hangars on the airport, which means that the site is visited by a variety of rare and interesting aircraft (including VVIP).

Airport Lübeck-Blankensee aka "Hamburg-Lübeck" () ()

Not really in use anymore by scheduled flights; low cost carrier Ryanair used to fly into Lübeck-Blankensee airport (not to confuse with Hamburg's quarter Blankenese), which is 65 km from Hamburg via motorway A1 until it first did move operations to nearby Bremen and eventually initiated flying into the main airport, Fuhlsbüttel, in autumn 2016. The same did Wizz Air 

Buses connecting to the airport go from Hamburg's central bus station ("ZOB", adjacent to the main train station). They cost €12 for single way and take about one hour and 10 minutes. The buses departed about two hours and 50 minutes before every Ryanair departure, met every arrival, and waited for delayed flights.

Hamburg-Finkenwerder Airport () ()

Situated just across the Elbe river, Finkenwerder Airport would undeniably be the most convenient airport for travellers visiting Hamburg. But unfortunately, due to being associated with an Airbus aircraft plant, for security concerns, usage is restricted to Airbus employees only. For them, two daily flights are available to/from , but most of the time the runway is used for freight (up to complete sections of passenger planes using the Beluga aircraft or the delivery of new planes.

The runway, as well as the aircraft parking lot, can be observed from the public street Neß-Hauptdeich. The parking lot is on the other side of the street, so a few times a day planes actually cross the street, including the world's largest passenger aircraft A380.

There are public tours of the Finkenwerder plant of about 2½ hours. Tickets cost € 13, reservations are required at least four weeks in advance, payment has to arrive 14 days in advance. You must bring your passport, leave cameras and mobiles at your hotel. Visitors have to be at least 14 years old. Be warned, security is tight, strictly follow the rules.

The plant is located not far from the centre, however, it's on the other side of the Elbe. Using public transport, Airbus is accessible by harbour ferry 68 from Teufelsbrück. Ferry 62 from Landungsbrücken 3 will bring you to the town of Finkenwerder, from there take the number 150 bus to the Airbus bus stop. Bus 150 starts at Altona's train station and uses the Elbe tunnel (not spectacular, but still one of the longest river tunnels in the world), that would be your third option. To observe the runway, exit bus 150 at stop Neuenfelde, Rosengarten (next one after stop Airbus).

Hamburg-Uetersen Airport ()

Air Hamburg serves several German islands from this airport. The only way to reach it is by taxi, the nearest railway station being Tornesch.

By train

DB Autozug also operates car transport and sleeper trains to several European destinations. They can be a convenient -if a bit expensive- way of travelling within Europe while still keeping your car around. 

Use the German railway's online trip planner to find connections to/from Hamburg and buy tickets.

By car

via the Autobahn:
* A1 to/from (north-east) — To get to the city change to the A24 at "Autobahnkreuz Ost".

Be prepared to pay for parking. Hamburg has a wide selection of P+R (Park+Ride) parking areas outside the city centre, where you can park for free and very easily use public transport to get into the city.

By bus

Buses serving other cities (regional, national, and European destinations) arrive at or depart from Hamburg's central bus station ("ZOB") which is located near the central railway station (Hauptbahnhof) (two minute walk). Destinations include (several times a day).

Buses to depart from Wandsbek.

Buses to Bosnia are run by Salinea. 

By carpooling

Throughout Germany and Europe, there is a broad culture of carpooling. Drivers save on fuel costs by sharing the ride with passengers who usually pay around 5€/100km. Several hundred thousand direct lifts to/from Hamburg and other European cities are offered on carpooling platforms like carpooling.com at any time.

By boat

, about an hour away by train, is a major Baltic ferry port. Ferries are available to and . Occasionally also longer trips to , and are offered.
Hamburg is also a major cruise port. Mostly during the summer months trips to Nordic countries are offered. However, there are also transatlantic services mostly to .

Hitchhike

You can leave Hamburg to the south (A7-Hannover/Frankfurt/Munich) and southwest (A1-Bremen/Cologne/Netherlands) from the filling station known as "HH-Stillhorn" you can get there with the number 13 bus from suburbanstation S-Wilhelmsburg.

To Berlin you can start at the "Horner-Kreisel" and take the number 161 bus from S-Berliner Tor or walk from U2-Rauhes Haus.

You can find cars driving to most German cities for €10-20.

From the UK, it may be an idea to take a ferry to Denmark and then hitch down rather than going via Holland.

Generally, try and have a cardboard sign which reads the local number plates of the place you wish to travel to, i.e. B for Berlin, HL for Luebeck, LN for Lueneburg and so on.

Get around

Public transport

Hamburg has a well-developed public transport system. Buses go around the clock. At night, a special "Nachtbus" (night bus) service connects the outlying districts and the city center. The buses depart and arrive at "Rathausmarkt", near the town hall and operate all through the night. The S-Bahn and U-Bahn (metro) train services (underground and overground) run from approximately 5AM until 1AM in the central city, but there is often no service past 11PM in outlying districts. On weekends, it runs all night.

Vending machines in the rail stations (and at some bus stops) sell short distance, single ride, and day tickets. Group tickets are also available. On the buses, the driver will sell you what you need. To buy week or longer tickets, go to Hauptbanhof or Bahnof Altona, get passport photos in the automated photo booth, and buy your pass in the information office. You can also buy a Hamburg Card, which includes the public transport system, museums, and other things. You can get the Hamburg Card at all ticket offices and from the bus drivers. Another option is the Hamburg City Pass - an all-inclusive pass - which includes free admission to Hamburgs top attractions, museums, tours and also free use of transport (underground, tram, buses, ferries): Hamburg City Pass. 

Hamburg's public transit operates on a proof-of-payment system. Officials in red waistcoats make spot checks, but aside from that, you simply get on and off as you wish with no turnstiles or gates. From 2012 on you are required to show your ticket while entering a bus to the driver. The exception are the crowded bus lines 4, 5 and 6, except after 21h and on Sundays.

Try to avoid rush-hour before 9AM and between 4-7PM. If you start your travel after 9AM, buy a "9 Uhr Tageskarte". You are not allowed to take bicycles into subways before 9AM and between 4-6PM, unless it is a folding bike like a Dahon, Brompton, Bike Friday, etc. Folders are allowed on Hamburg public transit at any time of the day.

Six ferry services operate in the harbour and along the River Elbe as part of the regular public transport system. (Tip: take ferry line 62 from Landungsbrücken to Finkenwerder and back to enjoy a scenic trip through the harbour on a day ticket.)

On the two Alster lakes, a ferry boat travels once every hour from Jungfernstieg in the city centre to Winterhuder Fährhaus. These boats are not in the general HVV ticket system, thus more expensive, however, they offer a splendid view to some of the wealthiest neighborhoods of Hamburg.

If you are traveling to Hamburg using a Niedersachsen ticket or Schleswig Holstein ticket, you have access to all the HVV lines.

By taxi
There is a good supply of taxis in Hamburg 24 hours a day, both at taxi stands and in the streets. You can identify a taxi rank by a green box on a post somewhat like an over-sized parking meter or alarm post. You will have to wait there or phone one of the numbers below, since the boxes can not be used to call a cab. Almost all vehicles are still in the traditional ivory white colour, but even if not, a yellow and black sign on the roof reading "Taxi" indicates a licensed cab. As usual, the sign is switched on to indicate vacancies. The meter starts at €2.80. A trip in the city area will be between €6-12. For a trip from the city to the airport, expect to pay roughly €25. Most taxis accept credit card payments.

By rail
Hamburg has six S-Bahn (commuter railway) lines and four U-Bahn (subway) lines, including the line U4. This line has been introduced in 2012 and it links the Jungfernstieg and Main Station (the city centre) with the new developments in the Hafencity. All lines run partly over and underground, in the city, and in the outskirts. The only difference is that these are two companies, but there is a unified fare system. 

All train platforms have signs showing the next train, where it is headed, and how many minutes until it arrives. Trains are described by a number and the final station. Note that the final station may vary. For example, half of the S1 trains heading west go all the way to Wedel, but the other half go only as far as Blankenese. Also, all S-Bahn trains with one-digit numbers go via Landungsbrücken and Jungfernstieg and all S-Bahn trains with two-digit numbers go via Dammtor.

Note that train doors do not open automatically. You have to press a button or pull a handle on the door. Wait for the passengers to get off first before you enter. In the cold season, close the door after getting on the train if it looks like a longer stop. Either push the handle or press the closing buttons on the inside until the door is closed.
All signs and notifications at stations and in trains are shown in at least two languages (German and English).

By bike
Hamburg is an extremely bicycle-friendly city and during the warmer months, many of the cities residents will use bicycles as their normal form of transportation. Several hotels within Hamburg provide residents with access to hotel bicycles. 

The city itself also offers bike rental services. This service is called StadtRad and there are several kiosks located around the city. To use this service, customers must register On the Stadtrad website and create an account with a credit card or e-mail and telephone. Once the account has been created, you can go to any one of these terminals and use one of their bikes as long as you want. You can choice one of three fares: Normal, HVV/BahnCard or Day pass. All fares except Day pass are require annual fee of €5 (renewed automatically). Note that one can even take two bicycles at the same time with just one account. Moreover, it is possible to take out a bicycle and return it after 29 minutes, only to rent another right away. By doing so, you could ride the whole day without paying anything, as the '30 minutes free' rule applies over and over. Check up to date prices on the StadtRad prices page.

 Donkey Republic public bicycle rental system. Bikes can be taken and should be returned only at approved drop-off locations scattered all over central parts of the city, but they can be locked at any time and any place without breaking the current ride. The longer you ride the cheaper it gets, for example: 15 min ride will cost €1.5, 6 hours - €8, 1 day - €12, etc. No initial fee, you pay only at the end of the ride. Broken bicycle can be exchanged without stopping the timer.

Alternatively, Hamburg City Cycles (working with the bicycle store next door) rents bicycles for €23 for 2 days and €7 for each additional day. Hourly rates are also available. The bicycles are large "cruiser" style bikes and the rental includes a lock, air pump, and toolkit if desired.

By scooter
Several scooter rent services are available:
* Bird €1 to unlock, + €0.25 per minute. Supports credit cards, PayPal and Google Pay.
* Circ €1 to unlock, + €0.2 per minute. Supports credit cards and PayPal.
* Tier €1 to unlock, + €0.19 per minute. Supports credit cards and PayPal.
* Voi €1 to unlock, + €0.15 per minute. Supports credit cards and PayPal.

All scooters are available only within central city areas, and ride can't be ended outside of it. It's recommended to check map in the app to find suitable service.

Even though wearing helmet is not legally required - it is highly recommended for your safety.

 Parking 
There are generally 2 options:
*Parking in the city centre: most likely, you will have to pay for parking. However, the maximum fee is €12 for 24 hours. This is a viable option if you would like to walk around the central area and you/your friends will not use the public transport.
*Parking in HVV P+R (Park & Ride): HVV offers free parking lots outside of the city centre. The idea is that you leave your car there and use the public transport to get around. If you and/or your company merely would like to travel around the city centre on foot, the first option is cheaper and makes more sense.

City Centre

 Around Mönckebergstraße 

The area west of Hamburg's central railway station is mainly a shopping area with the streets Spitaler Straße and Mönckebergstraße, leading to Hamburg's town hall. Close to the Mönckebergstraße you find the churches St. Jacobi (at road Jakobikirchhof) and St. Petri (at road Bergstraße), two of Hamburg's five main churches. Directly beside St. Petri there is the Hulbe-Haus, originally built as an arts and crafts house and dating from the beginning of the 20th century as most buildings around, but looking much older. 

Behind the Hulbe-Haus, under the building of "Radio Hamburg", you can visit the remains of the bishops tower, from the 11th century. On the other side of the road, you can currently see excavations in progress, seeking the remains of the small fortress Hammaburg, which was erected in the 9th century giving Hamburg its name.

 Around city hall 

The Mönckebergstraße ends at Hamburg's impressive city hall ("Rathaus"). It was built in 1897 out of sandstone in Neo-Renaissance style, including a 112 m tower. Inside there are several magnificent halls used for representative purposes and sittings of government and parliament. These can be visited in guided tours (M-Th 10AM-3:15PM, F-Su 10AM-1:15PM, half-hourly in German, hourly in English and French. Closed during official events. Admission is €4 for adults, €3 for Hamburg Card holders and free for children under 14 years of age).

The building behind the city hall is Hamburg's House of Commerce ("Börse"). Between the buildings, there is a little place called Rathaushof with its fountain Hygieia-Brunnen. The place in front of the city hall is the Rathausmarkt, hosting many events especially in summer. 

North of the Rathausmarkt, you find white arches at a canal called Alsterarkaden. The whole area behind is full of indoor shopping arcades. The most well-known one is the Hanse Viertel. 

Following the canal to the right and crossing the traditional shopping road, Jungfernstieg, you quickly get to the artificial lake Binnenalster. Boat tours take you to the even bigger artificial lake, Außenalster, directly behind the Binnenalster with lots of sailing boats in summer.

 Around St. Nikolai 

From the House of Commerce into the road Börsenbrücke, you get to the house of the Patriotische Gesellschaft. Behind the building to the right, you'll find the bridge Trostbrücke with the statues of Graf Adolf III and Bishop Ansgar on both sides. Following the water to left, there is Hamburg's oldest remaining bridge, Zollenbrücke, from the 17th century.

At the other side of the Trostbrücke, there is the ruin of the church, St. Nikolai. All five main churches of Hamburg were damaged in World War II. But in contrast to the other four, St. Nikolai has not been re-erected making it a memorial against war. The steeple is still standing and visitors can take an elevator to the top for a view of the city. The price to take the elevator is €3.70. At the side of St. Nikolai, there is the hop market ("Hopfenmarkt") with its fountain Vierländerinbrunnen. 

Following the bridge over the huge street Willy-Brandt-Straße and keeping right takes you into the road "Alte Deichstraße" with its ensemble of traditional half timbered merchant houses and the canal Nicolai Fleet at the rear. This is the site where Hamburg's harbour was some centuries ago.

 HafenCity 

At the southern end of the Alte Deichstraße, you see where the harbour moved afterwards. There is a canal called Zollkanal. Looking to the left, you see the Speicherstadt, a large district of warehouses from around 1900. Some are still in use, but others have been converted to apartments. It's a 'typical' location and worth a visit. It houses museums (International Maritime Museum, Speicherstadtmuseum, Spice Museum, Automuseum Prototyp) and also attractions, such as the "Hamburg Dungeon" and the "Miniatur Wunderland".

* The Hamburg Dungeon is a live-action presentation of the "darker times" of Hamburg. It is probably mostly suited for a younger, easily impressed audience. But it might not be suitable for young children. Tickets: 23 €.

* The Miniatur Wunderland is the world's largest model railway layout. The panoramas include parts of Hamburg, the Alps, the American west, and a Scandinavian exhibit which features automated ships on a body of water. It also has an airport exhibit with automated planes which taxi and fly. Tickets Adults: 20 €, kids The museum is a leading centre for art, applied art, and design. Its collections of work from Europe and the Middle and the Far East are of the finest-quality and span all epochs from the Ancient World to the present day. They also have many activities and concerts (see the Classical Music section). The museum is housed in an 18th century palace, which has the original roofs and ceilings. 

* Kunsthalle (art museum), Glockengießerwall, north of Hauptbahnhof, Tel: 428 131-200, Fax: 428 54-3409 Open Tu-Su 10AM-6PM, Th 10AM-9PM. Adults 12 €, Concessions 6 €, Family Day Ticket 18 €, under 18 free admission. The museum houses an important collection of paintings from the 19th century with works from Max Liebermann, Lovis Corinth, Philipp Otto Runge, Caspar David Friedrich, Adolf Menzel, and modern arts. It rises on both sides of a paved court. The Baroque building on one side has the older works. The areas under the courtyard and the other, modern looking building house an extensive collection of very modern art. There are some extremely fine pieces, but the quality is uneven and the curacy curious at times. For instance, in a far back corner with minimal climate control and no observation are four or five gorgeous French Impressionist paintings which are among the finest in the museum.

* Deichtorhallen — The Deichtorhallen is one of the best known exhibition galleries worldwide. The historical buildings are divided into an exhibition hall for contemporary art and the "House of Photography". Together the two buildings organize a highly diverse program of changing exhibitions.

* Hamburg Museum (former: Museum für Hamburgische Geschichte), Holstenwall, close to Underground station "St. Pauli". This is the museum of city history, bringing the past to life with a lot of models showing the development of the harbor and the city. The club "MEHEV" is showing a 40-year old and one of the largest scale model railroads here. 

* Originally built in 1892 under the guidance of Albert Ballin, the complex was built to provide medical care and accommodation to migrants, who were emigrating to the United States on HAPAG ships. The complex was converted into a museum, though its original design and layout is not the same because parts of the complex were destroyed. The museum is dedicated to the five million persons who emigrated via Hamburg. It has a computer terminal where visitors can look up information on their emigrant ancestors. At €12, it's pricey, and the English translations can be sparse and superficial. Unless they can read the German documents, American visitors who have been to museums such as Ellis Island will find much of the content familiar.

* International Maritime Museum – Privately owned museum in HafenCity district houses a collection of thousands model ships, construction plans, uniforms and photographs on ten floors in the oldest preserved warehouse in Hamburg (from 1879). Opening Hours: Tue - Sun 10.00 - 18.00 h, Normal ticket € 12.50, family € 24.50, Audio-Guide € 3,50, Koreastraße 1, Tel. +49 (0)40 300 92 30–0.

* Speicherstadtmuseum (Dockland Museum), branch of Museum of Labour located in docklands warehouse. History of the district and tea and coffee trade. Entrance: 3.60 €, discounts apply. Am Sandtorkai 36, Tel. 040 / 32 11 91

* Automuseum Prototyp HafenCity, Shanghaiallee 7. Museum of car prototypes, nice shop inside. Open 10AM - 6PM, Mondays closed. Tickets 9 EUR, kids Although not a regular public transport, some trips let you get on or off at other stops around the outer Alster lake.
 
The small cruise boats are often hired for weddings. Contact Alster Touristik on 35 74 24-0 or check out the website at www.alstertouristik.de.
There is also the independently operated Alster Steamboat, which might offer a more authentic feeling. 

You might also chose to rent a rowing boat or a paddle boat to explore the Alster and the canals linked to it at your own pace.Bear in mind that 
* you may only stop at a very few designated spots and private properties reaching down right to the waters edge are, of course, out of bounds
* tour boats run along the sometimes very narrow canals, so a bit of caution is advisable and you might have to squeeze next to the bank
* regular powered boats and sailing boats have right of way

For those who can do it, sailing boats are available for hire (taking 4 persons max., proof of skill will be necessary, be sure to remember the special right-of-way rules on the Alster)

You will usually need to leave a passport/id card as a deposit for any boat hire.

There are no powered boats for personal use.

Harbour boat trips
At the Landungsbrücken (floating landings for embarkation) area you will find a number of companies offering tours around the harbour. They last from about one hour up to three hours if it includes a downriver stretch.

Note that tours around the 'Speicherstadt' (historic warehouse district, now a World Heritage site) depend on tides and captains may decide on short notice if they can navigate the shallow canals. Check for high tides to plan your trip.

Regular ferry services
Popular among locals and tourists alike are the local ferry services along the Elbe river, especially the lines running between the Elbphilharmonie and Finkenwerder (the Airbus factory site). They offer a lot of the views you will get from the tours (minus the commentary and the Speicherstadt) with the fare usually being included in flat rate public transport tickets (tourist tickets, day or multi-day passes, etc.). Be prepared to queue at busy times.

 Theatre, Opera and Musicals 
Hamburg is home to the Hamburg State Opera House (Staatsoper Hamburg one of the leading opera houses in Germany. It holds great historical significance, as in 1678 the first public opera house in Germany was built in Hamburg at Gänsemarkt Square, which is where the opera house is still located today. The In 2011 the Staatsoper celebrated 333 years of opera at Gänsemarkt.
Hamburg also has many theaters, and is known to host a number of different musicals, as well as other music events.

Classical Music

The Laeiszhalle is the main classical music hall in Hamburg, with two halls: the klein Saal and großer Saal. You can see the schedule on their website. For online ticket purchases, use Ticket Online 

The Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg has many smaller concerts — something almost every day — and is much cheaper than the Laeiszhalle. The programs range from the curator of their early keyboard instrument collection playing them and giving a spiel on the music and the instruments (in German only!) to formal concerts of renditions of Schubert's Die Winterreise. Pick up a schedule at the desk of the museum (down the street from Hamburg Hauptbanhof).

 Sports 
* The Volksparkstadion (from 2001 to 2015 officially known as Imtech-Arena, HSH-Nordbank-Arena and AOL-Arena respectively, before 2001 and since 2015 officially called Volksparkstadion, but always called that way by fans anyways) is the stadium of the local Bundesliga football/soccer club HSV. Newly constructed and reopened in 2000, it is arguably the prettiest stadium in Germany with a great atmosphere. In addition to guided tours, it also features a museum presenting the history of the club. See also the HSV website 

* The Millerntor-Stadion is the home of the famous Bundesliga football/soccer club FC St. Pauli It lacks the modernity and prettiness of the Volksparkstadion, yet its atmosphere during games is unique and well worth a visit.

Learn
There are 11 universities in Hamburg, the biggest of which is the University of Hamburg 

Many courses and programmes are held in English.

Hamburg is home to schools from countries such as Japan, Sweden, France, Britain and more, where the pupils are taught in their native language. The International School Hamburg opened in 1957 as the first of its kind in Germany.

Work
The harbour is the fastest growing job sector in Hamburg. Numerous minor and major companies work in that area. You should be able to speak German because due to the high unemployment rate in Germany's jobseekers are attracted by the relative lower unemployment rate in Hamburg. This results in high numbers of applications. Hospitality and media are the two main other industries.

Note that living costs in Hamburg may be significantly higher than in other big cities in Germany depending on your demands. Due to heavy destruction during World War II, especially apartments, older victorian style homes built at the beginning of the 20th century are rare but highly demanded. Be prepared to compete for apartments in attractive areas in town with well-paid media professionals, freelancers and spoiled kids with unlimited resources in their parents' bank account. Inner city areas have become quite popular among doctors, lawyers and architects as well in the last years.

Buy
 
Full shopping tour starts at central station, down to town hall, then Poststrasse towards Gaensemarkt square and back on Jungfernstieg at the Alter lake side

Shops are mostly open daily 10AM—8PM and on Thursday and Friday until 10PM.

* The Schanzenviertel is also getting more popular nowadays for unique designer boutiques. Younger people especially enjoy being here. Subway "Sternschanze"/"Feldstraße". 

One of the coolest shops in this area (and really all of Hamburg) is called Mitali Fashion Shop, and it's been in the city for almost 30 years, if not longer. Go in and talk to the owners. It's a small, family run business, with interesting things from all over the world. You can get incense, figurines, clothes, wall hangings. To get to the store, take the U-Bahn to Feldstrasse. When you come out of Feldstrasse, cross the road, walk onto onto Marktstrasse and you'll see a quaint street full of shops, cafes, and restaurants. Mitali Fashion Shop is across the street from the park slightly below ground. You can also have some great beers and snacks around. The neighborhood, Schanze, is one of the most fun areas in Hamburg!

* The main shopping area of Hamburg is the Mönckebergstraße in the centre of the city. Take the subway to either central station, Rathaus (town hall), or Mönckebergstraße. Also check the side-street Spitalerstraße.
West of town hall towards Gaensemarkt are the more pricey shops like Hugo Boss.

Eat

 Cuisine 
Original Hamburg dishes are Birnen, Bohnen und Speck (Low Saxon Birn, Bohn un Speck, green runner beans cooked with pears and bacon), Aalsuppe (Low Saxon Oolsupp, often mistaken to be German for “eel soup“ (Aal/Ool translated ‘eel’), however the name probably comes from the Low Saxon allns ʔaˑlns, meaning “all”, “everything and the kitchen sink”, not necessarily eel. Today eel is often included to meet the expectations of unsuspecting diners.), Bratkartoffeln (Low Saxon Brootkartüffeln, pan-fried potato slices), Finkenwerder Scholle (Low Saxon Finkwarder Scholl, pan-fried plaice), Pannfisch (pan-fried fish), Rote Grütze (Low Saxon Rode Grütt, related to Danish rødgrød, a type of summer pudding made mostly from berries and usually served with cream, like Danish rødgrød med fløde) and Labskaus (a mixture of corned beef, mashed potatoes and beetroot, a cousin of the Norwegian lapskaus and 's Scouse (food), all offshoots off an old-time one-pot meal that used to be the main component of the common sailor's humdrum diet on the high seas).

Alsterwasser in Hamburg (a reference to the city's river Alster with two lake-like bodies in the city centre thanks to damming), a type of, a concoction of equal parts of beer and carbonated lemonade (Zitronenlimonade), the lemonade being added to the beer. 

Hamburg is also home to a curious regional dessert pastry called Franzbrötchen. Looking rather like a flattened croissant, the Franzbrötchen is somewhat similar in preparation, but includes a cinnamon and sugar filling, often with raisins or brown sugar. The name may also reflect to the roll's croissant-like appearance &ndash; franz appears to be a shortening of französisch, meaning "French", which would make a Franzbrötchen a “French roll.” Being a Hamburg regional food, the Franzbrötchen becomes quite scarce outside the borders of the city; as near as () it can only be found as a Hamburger and is not available in at all.

Ordinary bread rolls tend to be oval-shaped and of the French bread variety. The local name is Rundstück (“round piece” rather than mainstream German Brötchen, diminutive form of Brot “bread”), a relative of Denmark's rundstykke. In fact, while by no means identical, the cuisines of Hamburg and Denmark, especially of Copenhagen have a lot in common. This also includes a predilection for open-faced sandwiches of all sorts, especially topped with cold-smoked or pickled fish. The American hamburger seems to have developed from Hamburg's Frikadelle: a pan-fried patty (usually larger and thicker than the American counterpart) made from a mixture of ground beef, soaked stale bread, egg, chopped onion, salt and pepper, usually served with potatoes and vegetables like any other piece of meat, not usually on a bun. Many Hamburgers consider their Frikadelle and the American hamburger different, virtually unrelated. The Oxford Dictionary defined a Hamburger steak in 1802: a sometimes-smoked and -salted piece of meat, that, according to some sources, came from Hamburg to America.

Sleep

Budget

On the floor

There is a Church mission on the West side of the main train station, mainly for homeless people and people with problems. But it's very clean, people are friendly, and if one is humble and polite, there is a good chance you can enter to chat (even in English) and sleep there on the floor in your sleeping bag. The night shift opens the place at midnight and everyone has to leave before seven in the morning. 

Nevertheless, as a traveller, you should contribute some money to run the volunteer's service or at the very least offer some help. Remember: This is not a place for the unprepared traveller and definitely not a hotel!

Stay safe

Generally, Hamburg is a safe city. 

The usual precautions should be observed against pickpockets, especially in crowded situations and along the tourist and shopping areas.

Some extra care should be taken on visits to the Reeperbahn area:
* Police extensively patrol the area
* Any kind of weapon is prohibited during weekend party times. This includes glass containers.You may not bring glass bottles. Bars or clubs will not let you exit with glass bottles in hand and shops will not sell glass during that time.
* Sex workers offer their services on the sidewalk and can be very insistent, even holding on to you and coming after you a few steps (until they come to another's spot).Male-only groups are especially targeted, female company will give you some 'protection'.Pickpocketing might be attempted in this situation.
* Table dance bars have been known for extortionate billing with innocent requests from girls for drinks and then ordering the most expensive item at the slightest semblence of agreement. Settling the 500-Euro-or-more bills might include threats of violence, even a forced trip to the nearest ATM with your company being kept behind.You might want to report such incidents to the police and chances are that they will believe your story.
* Reeperbahn train station can be very rowdy on weekends, especially at late hours with groups of drunk people causing conflicts. Try to avoid contact.

Keep your distance from demonstrations unless you wish to get involved: both leftist groups and the Hamburg police are known for their heavy reactions in such situations.

Things to know about water include
* Ships passing a beach may create big waves and/or undercurrents tossing the unwary swimmer around or onto stone abuttments, piers, etc.
* Spread your blanket well away from the waters edge and keep an eye out for children.a 1,5m wave might not look like much at first, still, it is many tons of water dragging you up and down the beach.
* Do not jump into the water. With ships passing by in dredged channels, water near the river banks might be shallow, especially during low tide or covering underwater structures like pilings, pipes or stones.
* Tidal flow is very strong. You will not be able to swim against it once you are too far away from the banks.

*Swimming in the Outer Alster lake is possible, though swimmers are rarely seen. The water is fairly clean. The lake is only about 2-3 metres deep.
*Tap water is very clean and safe to drink, even to prepare food for infants.

Important phone numbers in emergency (dial without any local prefix all over Germany/always free of charge):
* 112 = Medical emergency and fire department
