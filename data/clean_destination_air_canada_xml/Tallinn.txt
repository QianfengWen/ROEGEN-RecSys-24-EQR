Tallinn the capital of , lies on the southern coast of the Gulf of Finland, only 70 km (43 mi) south of . At the historical and medieval heart of the city is the hill of Toompea, covered in cobbled streets and filled with medieval houses and alleyways. The lower town spreads out from the foot of the hill, still protected by the remnants of a city wall. Around the city wall is a series of well-maintained green parks, great for strolling.

The city's old town has been astonishingly well preserved and was inscribed on the in 1997. It is now in better shape than ever, with the bigger roads converted into fashionable shopping streets reminiscent of or . Especially in summer, the Old Town is packed with tourists, with the traditional day-trippers from increasingly supplemented by other Europeans taking advantage of cheap flights.

Alas, the new town sprawling all around is largely built in typical concrete Soviet-style, now joined with glass-and-steel cubes celebrating the post-Soviet economic boom. The new center of town is Vabaduse väljak (Freedom Square) at the edge of the old town, and nearby is the giant matchbox of Hotel Viru, the former Intourist flagship and notorious den of Cold War intrigue (every room was tapped and monitored by the KGB!).

Understand

 
Tallinn is a historic city dating back to medieval times and it was first recorded on a world map in 1154, although the first fortress was built on Toompea in 1050. In 1219, the city was conquered by Valdemar II of Denmark, but it was soon sold to the Hanseatic League in 1285. The city, known as Reval at the time, prospered as a trading town in the 14th century, and much of Tallinn's historic center was built at this time.

Tallinn then became a pawn in the geopolitical games of its big neighbors, passing into Swedish hands in 1561 and then to Russia under Peter the Great in 1710. By World War I and the ensuing brief Estonian independence (starting 1918) Tallinn's population had reached 150,000.

Estonia was eventually occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940, only to be conquered by Nazi Germany (1941-44) and then retaken by the Soviets. In World War II, the city was quite extensively bombed by the Soviets, although luckily the medieval town remains. The Soviet Union undertook a program of massive Slavic migration, and just over 36% of Tallinn's current inhabitants are of Russian ethnicity (compared to an average of 25% for the entire country). On August 20, 1991, Estonia declared independence and Tallinn became its capital once again.

Today, Tallinn is a bustling, gleaming metropolis of over 430,000 people. However, among the tall glassy buildings and corporate headquarters, Tallinn retains an inner charm seldom found anywhere else. Estonians consider themselves to be living in a Northern European/Scandinavian or an eastern European country depending on who you ask, with very close ties to (ethnic, linguistic, and cultural), and visiting Tallinn you will find a mix of at least three architectures in this very visual city -- old Europe (the city walls with rustic buildings and charming living areas with well-preserved and colorful wooden houses of bourgeois taste of the 1920s), Soviet Brutalist (concrete apartment blocks), and modern Europe (including McDonald's next to the city walls!).

Get in

By ferry
The most common ferry route is from , to Tallinn Port which has upwards of 20 departures daily. Depending on the ferry, journey time is anywhere from 1.5 to 3.5 hours. Prices average €16-30 one way, depending on the operator, season (summer costs more), day of the week (Fri and Sat cost more), and time of day (to Tallinn in the morning and back in the evening is popular and hence more expensive). Particularly popular are day cruises, which can go for as little as €19 return. All ferries can also carry cars, from €25 one way. 

The following companies operate ferries between Tallinn and 

* Eckerö Line Operates only one ship, the 2000-passenger Finlandia (2.5 h one-way). Often has the cheapest fares.
* Tallink Silja – Up to 6 departures daily on large Star and Superstar ferries (2h). They also operate the Baltic Princess (3.5 hours), a slick new 2800-passenger behemoth with cabins for easy overnight stays in Tallinn. Discounts are available to Eurail pass holders.
* Viking Line – Large Viking XPRS ferry (2.5h), two sailings daily.

Tallink also offers a year-round daily overnight service from taking 16 hours.

All ferries dock at Reisisadam port, to the north of the center. Tallink uses Terminal D at the south-eastern side of the bay and Eckerö and Viking the Terminal A/B at the northwestern side. From there, bus #2 operates to both the city center (A. Laikmaa stop), intercity bus station (Autobussijaam stop), and the airport (Lennujaam stop). Alternatively, you can take a leisurely 15-minute walk, first west to Mere pst and then down to Viru Square. View a map of route 2

By cruise ship
 region.]]
Port of Tallinn is one of the biggest cruise and passenger ports in the Baltics. Over 30 cruise lines call on the port of Tallinn during the tourist season. Cruise vessels are mainly accommodated in the Old City Harbour, which is less than a mile northeast of the Old Town. Within the port area, there are several passenger terminals; free public WiFi areas are in both A and D terminals. 

Buses, trolleys, and trams operate regularly from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. You need to buy a Ühiskaart which has 2€ deposit (ask how to return it where you buy it) if you want to buy Tallinn public transportation tickets because drivers don't sell them and the price is 1.50€/h. Bus no. 2 runs between the harbor (bus stops at A and D terminals) and the airport via the city center. You can also hop on a red hop-on/hop-off bus stopping in the harbor, only the price is a lot higher. There is also a tram (tram lines 1 and 2) stop in the proximity of the harbor area. 

If you take a taxi, take a close look at the yellow price list, which is posted on the right-side rear door. Make sure the taxi driver holds an operator’s card – a white plastic card with the driver’s photo and name, attached to the middle of the dashboard. When starting out make sure the taximeter is turned on. The driver is not allowed to charge more than indicated on the meter. The driver must be paid in Euros. Ask the taxi driver for a receipt from the meter’s printer. If the meter or printer is out of order, the driver should not be in service, and you have the right to refuse from paying the fare.

Perhaps the easiest way to get to Old Town is by walking, less than a mile to the southwest (see map Find the blue line painted on the pavement, and follow it to the Port Gate. After exiting the port gate, proceed across the street, then turn left with the crosswalks. At the next big cross street, Sadama, turn right (west). Walk a couple of long blocks west on Sadama, then you will come to a confusing intersection with many lanes of traffic. Make your way carefully across the lanes of traffic and head towards the tall church spire (St. Olav's). A round stout stone tower (Fat Margaret Tower) should come into view; the north gate is to the right of it.

By plane

Tallinn Airport (AKA "Lennart Meri Tallinn Airport" or "Ülemiste Airport") () () is a small airport located 5 km from the city center on the eastern shore of Lake Ülemiste. The flight timetable is available online A decent and reasonably priced cafe (open 8&ndash;20) can be found on the 2nd floor, above the departure area (before security control). Cafes beyond the security are more expensive, as usual. Free Wi-Fi is available throughout the terminal building. There is a designated room for smokers - a glass "gas chamber", with a few tables, but ventilation is imperfect.

The following airlines operate service to/from Tallinn Airport:

* airBaltic (, -Tegel, -Charles de Gaulle, , , )
* Avies (), ()

Around midnight, taxis often collect passengers from far before the taxi column, so booking one before arrival is highly recommended.

* Bus #2 stops right in front of the airport. The journey to the entrance to Old Town (A.Laikmaa stop) takes approximately 15 minutes. Be careful because both inbound and outbound line #2 buses use the same bus stop at the airport. To get to the city center, catch the bus traveling towards "Reisisadam" (the passenger port) (and not towards "Mõigu", which is a residential area on the outskirts of the city). The bus stop in the city center (A. Laikmaa) is located between Hotel Tallink and the Viru Center shopping mall/ intra-city bus terminal. The bus does not stop in the intra-city Bus Terminal itself. You can buy tickets at the R-Kiosks all around the city, in the bus terminal, or on the bus. View a map of route 2 The tour from the harbor D-terminal (very close to the city center) to the airport costs 2 Euros (12.08.2018).

* Tram #4 line was extended to airport. On Mondays through Saturdays, the first tram arrives at the airport at 5.25 AM and at 5.45 on Sundays. The last tram from the airport to the city center leaves at 0.45 AM. The journey to the city center takes about 15 minutes. A single ticket costs 1.50€ per hour and you need Ühiskaart. You can get from R-Kiosk. If you have a card, you can get a QR ticket from the machine right by the airport exit door for 1,5 euros for a single ticket.

* Lux Express 

Get around

The Old City is best navigated on foot. A network of buses, trams and trolleybuses covers the rest of the city. There is an abundance of relatively cheap taxis. Before you jump in a random taxi car make sure you check the price on the window of the car. In Tallinn there are more than 20 different taxi companies and some can be a rip-off. 

By public transport

 tlt operates frequent buses, trolleys, and trams between 6AM and 12AM. 
Timetables in English can be found here: and maps can be found here:
Map: Baby prams can be carried in most of the buses, trolleys, and trams except for a few which have steps. For getting out of Tallinn, Peatus.ee is the public transport route planner for all of Estonia, searchable by points on the map or names of places.

When traveling by public transport, you need an Ühiskaart, a smart card where you can add money to buy tickets. They are available in many locations, most commonly in R-Kiosks. It costs a 2€ deposit plus the amount you wish to add to it. A 1-hour ticket costs 1.50€ and the card must be validated every time you enter a public transport vehicle. They work on trams, buses, and trolleybuses. When you leave Tallinn, you can return your card and get your deposit plus a balance of up to 20€ back in Tallinn airport R-kiosk, passenger port A and D terminal R-kiosk, train station R-kiosk or regional bus station T-ticket service desk. More information is available here: Discounts are given to students and Tallinn residents. The Tallinn Card includes unlimited use of public transportation.

By bus

The bus network covers the whole city. Those are green buses with line numbers that have one or two digits. 

Tourist bus tours (look for the red-colored buses) are also available at designated stops in the Old Town.

By tram

The tram network covers the city center. There are 4 routes and they all meet at Viru Center, at stop Hobujaama. About 15 carriages have a lowered middle section, which makes trams wheelchair-accessible. Departure times of those carriages are marked with a yellow background in the schedules. Usually, these vehicles serve routes 1 and 4. 

By trolleybus

All trolley lines have a direction to south or west. They operate on electric lines. There are four lines, 1 and 3-5.

By Hop-Off-On Sight Seeing Bus

For first-time visitors or day visitors, another option is to take the Sight Seeing Buses. It provides good commentary on the history of the city and its various attractions. The tickets are available inside the terminal just near the exit gate or at the bus stop itself. Please note there are around 2-3 operators - City Tour, City SightSeeing Tour and they have similar buses and prices but the tickets are not interchangeable. Ticket rates for one day are 13 euros for just the RED line and 16 euros for ALL lines (consisting of RED, BLUE, and GREEN lines), while it is 20 euros for 3 days for all lines. Buying for ALL lines is preferable as the RED line route is very small and can be covered by walking by young people. Also, check the timings of these buses at the various stops. These buses operate mostly from 10 am to 4-4:30pm, so plan your stops accordingly.

By taxi
Tallinn has many different taxi companies and independent taxis. The maximum and very expensive rate allowed in Tallinn is 5,50€ starting fee, 1,10€ per kilometer fee, and 24,20€ hourly fee. The usual rates should be around 2-3€ starting price and 0,50€ per kilometer. As long as those prices are displayed on the sticker in the window and on the dashboard, they are completely legal. Needless to say, the locals never take those taxis, their sole modus operandi is to prey on ignorant tourists. Do as the locals do and order a taxi by phone. Rarely should you pay more than 10€ for a taxi ride in Tallinn unless you are going from one end of the city to another, sit in traffic, or are desperately lost at nighttime. Ride-hailing apps such as Bolt and Uber are much cheaper than traditional taxis in Tallinn.

The city government has fought hard against scams. The harbor and the airport now have reputable partners who can park their taxis in front of the terminals. They are reliable but on the expensive side - if you want to save money use the taxi companies or apps below. At night, however, some scam artists still find a way to the city, so take extra care. The same goes for any taxi that looks shabby or does not carry the logo of one of the reputable companies. Also, be wary of taxis that look overly luxurious: large Mercedes, TV screens inside, usually only a very small and vague logo on the door. Avoid any cars offering carriages that do not have Estonian plates. Taxis hanging out in front of nightclubs often have the highest prices. Many companies also raise prices from 23-06 - always check the yellow sign on the window for prices!

Reputable taxi companies are:
* Tallink yellow Mercedes B-class, Audi A6, Skoda Superb, or Hyundai I30 Wagon (not to confuse with Tallinn Taxi, who also have their cars painted yellow). Tallink is also one of the more expensive taxi companies.
* Forus Takso also known as Airport Taxi. Somewhat expensive but reliable with the opportunity to pay by card.
* Sõbra "economy" taxis with a mixed car fleet, somewhat cheaper than the competition. Unlike many other economy taxis, the cars are clean and the drivers competent.
* Luxlimu Sclass Mercedes and Stretch Limousine Transfers

By car

Like other large cities, Tallinn has its fair share of traffic jams and therefore is not for the faint-hearted. The road rules and driving style can be confusing to tourists. The one and two-way roads change frequently and some signposts are not descriptive. That being said, traffic jams in Tallinn clear very quickly and if you are from a large city, they will seem like speed-humps rather than traffic jams. 

The speed limit in Tallinn is 50 km/h, except for some major streets such as Laagna tee, Pärnu mnt., Paldiski mnt., Peterburi tee, etc., which have a speed limit of 70 km/h. 

There is an abundance of parking, but you have to pay for it. The locations of ticket machines, and other methods for paying for parking, aren't always obvious. The ticket machines are not posted clearly. Here are a few helpful tips to avoid being fined:

# Each rental car should come with a clock mock-up on the dashboard that should be clearly visible from the outside of the car. Every car in Tallinn gets 15 minutes free parking in paid parking areas. The clock mock-up is used to indicate the beginning of the parking. For example, if you park at 5:30, your plastic clock mock-up should show 5:30. You can park for free until 5:45. 
# Find a bright-orange vested parking inspector in order to determine what type of parking ticket you need.. To ask for a parking ticket, say "Palun, üks parkimispilet" in Estonian. It will help to use a combination of sign language and a phrasebook if your Estonian is limited or non-existent. You may want to simply buy the €1.50 parking ticket to be safe. 
# Scratch the correct date and length of time you'll be parking. When you get your parking ticket, it will look more like a lottery ticket. The ticket is split into sections and they are written in both Estonian and English. Scratch off the date of usage. Then scratch off the time you wish the ticket to start. Make sure it is clearly visible next to the clock on the dashboard.
# Mobile phone payment is very popular, but you will need a local phone number to use it.

Signs prohibiting parking are not always well visible, one example is the area between Terminal D in the port and the Nautica shopping center. One thing to look out for is signs in one form or another with the word Eramaa - this is Estonian for "private land" and means that parking is either prohibited or available against a fee.

By bike
There are a few bicycle paths and lanes in Tallinn, maybe 5 km in total. The other paths are shared between pedestrians and cyclists ("cyclist and pedestrian road" - typically a rebranded sidewalk). Those are not always marked appropriately so you might end up on the pavement where riding is legally not allowed. But the police do not care so long as nobody gets injured. Ride where it's safe without hitting anyone and not getting hit by anything. A helmet is highly recommended when interacting with cars. During evening rush hour getting around by bicycle is on par with cars or even faster.

* Over 150 bicycles and lot of extra gear, €15 for 24 hours. Real cyclist center with experienced staff, opened in 2003.

* Alternative bike tours run by local youth. Tours start from the Tallinn Traveller Info tent (corner of Harju and Niguliste Street) or from the Tallinn Traveller Info office at Vana-Posti 2 (off-season).

* Remember to not leave any bicycle during night time (or a long time) outside unattended, there is a probability that the bicycle would get damaged/stolen, many hostels provide safe space to store it.

On foot
The Old Town of Tallinn is very comfortably covered on foot.

If you have a mobile phone, mobile tours in English are available for download on the internet. 

Audio guides in several languages are available for a small charge at the tourist centers.

Tips for First Time Visitors 
If you are on a day trip to Tallinn for a few hours only, then you can walk down to Viru street (10-15 min walk from Ferry Terminal) or take a taxi to get there and then roam the old city on foot. There are some great "lookout" points, where you can take in spectacular views of the rest of Old Town.

See

The Old City

* Excellently preserved, built in the 15-17th centuries. This compact area is best explored on foot. Call a tour guide for 56 Euros for 2 hours for two. It will give you a lot of stories that you won't have been aware of. It's worth the money.

* This section of town is known as All-Linn or "Lower Town", as it's where the merchants and artisans of old Tallinn lived. Today, Viru is still Tallinn's trendiest shopping street and the entire All-Linn is the busiest (and most touristy) bit of Tallinn.

* The square in the heart of the Old City, ringed with cafes and restaurants. Houses a cute Christmas market in late November and December.

* Built in 1371, this heavy stone structure dominates the square. It now houses the Tallinn City Museum.

* According to myth, the hill was built on top of the grave of legendary Estonian king Kalev, but more historically, it's solid limestone and the site of the Danish castle that founded the city in 1219. Toompea was the home of the Danish aristocracy and relations between the toffs and the plebs were often inflamed, which is why it's surrounded by thick walls and there's a gate tower (1380) guarding the entrance. Check out the viewpoints, some of which give great views over the city. There's also a cluster of amber (merevaik) shops around here (no Estonian origin but popular among cruise tourists).

* a classic onion-domed 19th-century Russian Orthodox church that has become a touristy symbol of the city, to the annoyance of some who regard it as a symbol of oppression. It was almost demolished in 1924 during Estonia's first brief spell of independence, but the Soviets left it to molder and it has been restored to its former glory.

* Estonia's Parliament, pretty in pink.

* The oldest church in Tallinn, originally built as a Catholic church in 1229 but renovated and expanded many times since then, becoming a Lutheran church in 1561.

* Describes the life conditions under Soviet and Nazi regimes. 

* A section of the City Wall can be climbed from the corner of Suur-Kloostri and Väike-Kloostri, with entry into three towers possible. Quite frankly, the views from up on Toompea are better, and the spiral staircases are steep and somewhat claustrophobic.

* Now the Interior Ministry and not generally open to the public, this is where the KGB detained and tortured suspected dissidents. A Soviet-era joke says that this was the tallest building in Estonia: even from the basement, you could see Siberia. Interrogations were indeed conducted in the basement and you can see even today how the windows were crudely bricked up with concrete to mute the sound.

Outside the Old City

* An imperial Russian summer residence built by Italian architect Niccolo Michetti for Tsar Peter the Great in 1718. It is situated in a 90 ha (222 acres) park in the eastern part of the city. The Tsar himself, a classic and mysterious Russian soul, preferred to stay in a modest house nearby. This event signified the beginning of Tallinn's fame as a summer resort for noble and rich Russians for most of the 18th and 19th centuries. Currently, the palace is housing some paint collections and other art. A portion of the complex is now occupied by the Office of the President and not available to the public.

* A beautiful and rich seaside resort district with mostly wooden buildings from the 18th to 20th centuries, as well as 20th century Art Deco and Functionalist structures. It also includes the baroque pearl of Estonia, the Kadriorg Palace and Garden. 

* The oldest suburb of Tallinn, dating back to the 14th century. It was probably inhabited by fishermen (Kalamaja means "Fish house") and mostly houses workers. The current wooden buildings are from the 19th century.
 
* An industrial district between the City and the Tallinn Port. The buildings are from the 19th and 20th century, with motifs of Art Nouveau and Historicism. New and stylish apartment buildings with shopping centre have now been built there widely regarded as architectural masterpiece in Tallinn.

* A fine example of Soviet Brutalist architecture designed by Raine Karp and Riina Altmäe and built for the 22nd Moscow Summer Olympic Games in 1980 for sailing events held in Tallinn. Scale the exterior of this crumbling monumental eulogy to mass culture and marvel at the fact that beneath its crumbling exterior lies a 5,000 seat amphitheater (that held a concert as recently as 2008) and a 3,000-seat ice rink. Currently closed to the public as negotiations regarding its redevelopment continue - maybe the last chance to see part of Tallinn's overlooked architectural heritage in its current form. Linda line runs their catamaran service to Helsinki from offices adjacent to/underneath the helipad. 

* Completed in the early 90s, the exterior of this building looks like a Freemasons building and the interior is like a neo-futuristic dungeon.

* A monastery of Scandinavian female saints, as well as a landmark of 16th century catacombs and ruins. It includes a guest house operated by the nuns. 

* Tallinn's most famous cemetary, housing Estonia’s presidents Konstantin Päts and Lennart Meri, as well chess player Paul Keres. If you're not there to see the graves of Estonian celebrities, it's a peaceful experience to just stroll among the trees.

* A huge Modernist structure where the All Estonian Song Festival, which is held every five years, features 34,000 singers and dancers in addition to a massive audience.

* Includes forest parks, Botanic Gardens and Metsakalmistu (the last resting place of well-known Estonians). A few kilometers east of the city center along the seaside road.

* The Tallinn Botanic Garden is in the eastern outskirts of Tallinn, 10 km from the city centre and 3 km from the Pirita Sailing and Recreation Centre.It is a must-see destination for nature and plant lovers. The "greenhouse" located near the ticket office houses a variety of plants, flowers, trees, cactus family, and a lot more. Spring temperature is maintained always inside the greenhouse, even during the winter season. The outdoor garden is vast and has varied flower collections.

* A 2.2 km route built on an old railroad. The walkway passes by some interesting destinations including Katel (Tallinn Cultural Hub), Fish market (Kalaturg), the historic Patarei Prison, the Seaplane Harbour (Lennusadam) and ends at the end of Kalamaja park on Tööstuse street.

* An old quarry in Tallinn's biggest sleeping district which has been turned into a lovely park. You can also see a lighthouse in the middle of the city.

Do

* New maritime museum where you can visit the submarine Lembit which was the oldest submarine afloat in the World when it was hauled out in 2011. The hangars exhibition has different kinds of vessels, old (air defense) cannons, sea mines, etc., and has a lot of multimedia information screens, and also some activities for children. It also has the remains of the oldest wreck found from Estonian waters (the ship was built about 1550). The museum ships are at the harbor and include the steamship Suur Töll which is the biggest icebreaker in the world preserved through two world wars and border control boats. In front of the hangars is an exhibition of different kinds of army vehicles of different ages.

* A 314-metre high, free-standing structure with an observation deck on the 21st floor, which with its 170 metres, is the highest in Northern Europe. It offers spectacular views across Tallinn and, on a clear day, you can see Finland.

* Opened in February 2006, this is the largest government-built building since the liberation and it is an almost 50,000 m² (538,196 ft²). The museum, whose architecture is by itself enough to justify the visit, houses a cyclopic house, partly cut out of limestone rock. The permanent exhibition is obviously focused on Estonian art in a wide interval of time. The quality of many pieces is very good and well worth a visit. Also very interesting is the (not too spontaneous) turn of interests of artists toward socialist themes during the USSR period. Exhibitions of modern art, mixed with net/social applications, are often surprising and amusing. Not to be missed or overlooked.

* This is an enormous area. Among its live exhibits, you'll find the world's best collections of mountain goats and sheep, which means there are a lot of them! Tallinn Zoo defies the realities of a relatively modest town -- it features all the elephants and crocodiles a visitor would expect to see in a larger zoo, as well as a breathtaking maze of lake-size ponds that host birds in the summertime.

* This museum includes 72 buildings of Estonian vernacular architecture and village milieu of the Tsarist time of rule in a dark, dense forest. This museum provides a picture of life and its hardship in the old times. Folklore Society Leigarid gives free dancing performances here at 11AM each Saturday and Sunday. The museum organizes special events during Easter, which provide more insight on Estonian traditions and culture.

* Fotografiska A large gallery with several photographic art exhibitions at the same time and generous opening hours. Opened in 2019, this is the Tallinn branch of a Stockholm photographic gallery. 

* Saku Suurhall, Rocca al Mare, Estonia's largest concert and exhibition space, the venue for the 2002 Eurovision Song Contest. The hall and its facilities include an excellent shopping center that can easily be reached by trolleybus 6.

* Schooner Kajsamoor, Lennusadam, Daily, Sailing Sightseeing tours on the Bay of Tallinn with guided tours and lunch. Visitors can contemplate the amazing view of Tallinn’s Bay and enjoy listening to the Old Port Life’s stories. Tours run from May thru mid-September. Private tours and events can also be organized. The schooner is located at the Seaplane Harbour.

Beaches

A flag system that regulates swimming. A green flag means it is safe to swim, a yellow flag means you can swim, but it isn't recommended and a red flag means swimming is not advised, go in at your own risk.

* the yachting venue for Moscow 1980 Olympic Games. It features a large sandy beach and in the summer it's full of locals and tourists. 

* The water is clean and warm, and it is the gay friendliest beach of Tallinn.

* small lake that draws a lot of people. The lake gets dirtier by the year and swimming is not always recommended. Watch out for the vipers on the shore! 

* The water is one of the purest in all of Tallinn beaches.

* The water quality is fairly good and it gets deep quite soon when you go in. The huge waves coming from the ships break on shore for the joy of all swimmers. The historical Katariina Pier is nice to walk on. 

Sporting & Relaxation

Tallinn offers a lot of sporting opportunities - from ATV rentals to ice skating.

Tourists from European countries often opt for spa holidays in the city.

Film Festivals

* The festival combines a feature film festival with the sub-festivals of animated films, student films and children/youth films.

Music Festivals

Boutiques and Souvenirs

For boutiques and souvenirs, your best choice is Viru street in the Old City and its side streets. There are many stalls selling traditional items like woolen pullovers, crystal, and amber. Prepare to .

Fashion-interested people could visit Estonia's first Post-Sovietic designer brand Ivo Nikkolo [The main store is located in Old Town, Suur-Karja street 14.

Rotermann Quarter

The Rotermann Quarter is a downtown shopping area with clothing and department stores and restaurants. It's situated between Viru Keskus, Tallinn port, and the Old Town.

Eat

The Old City is packed with restaurants claiming to offer authentic Estonian food, particularly on and around Raekoja plats. Prices at restaurants near the Raekoja Plats are generally more expensive, yet offer the same quality of food, as restaurants off this main square. Prices are steep by Estonian standards, but still much cheaper than neighboring Helsinki, which explains why on weekends they're always packed with day-tripping Finns.

The new neighborhoods on the rise are Kalamaja and Kopli. Here you can find quite a lot of trendy restaurants opened up in old factories and such. There are no touristy restaurants or party pubs but nice, affordable restaurants popular among local people. It may not be too easy to find restaurants by just wandering around so it's recommended to check the addresses beforehand.

Budget
* Popular restaurant in an old factory building serving international cuisine. The restaurant hall is nicely decorated and divided into different areas.
* Pleasant and affordable tourist trap in basement. Located in the middle of Old Town.
* Cafe Narva boasts its old-style interior preserved from USSR times. Ladies at the counter are also somewhat brusque and mostly Russian-speaking, although this should not prevent you from enjoying traditional food of Soviet workers as well as delicious pastries baked on the premises. 
* Sesoon was opened in March 2013 and it has also gained such popularity that you may need a reservation (not usually though). Located on an inner yard of a building by the quiet Niine street and serving international cuisine. Apparently, some of the chefs are the same who made F-hoone popular.
* This place offers an assortment of huge and delicious pancakes at great prices. Don't give in to the temptation to order two portions, one pancake is usually enough.
* A great local pub, featuring cheap food with hearty portions.
* Beer selection is amazing. 80 different beers from countries: EST, FIN, GER, CZE, BEL, FRA, SCT, ENG, LVA, DEN, NLD. The beer prices are cheap, e.g., 2-3 EUR for draught beer and 3-6 EUR for bottles. Gourmet food for relatively cheap, €5-12. Note that dishes take quite some time to make (think 45-60 minutes), so you may want to have a beer or two after you place your order and when the food actually arrives.

Mid-range

* A very nice little Italian restaurant stashed away in a small side passage in the Old Town. Offering genuinely excellent food at reasonable prices with good service. Its only 'flaw' is that it's hard to get into and is most often completely full, even on off-season weeknights. You may want to call ahead and make a reservation. Pizzas and pasta dishes are around €10.

* This open kitchen type restaurant serves good flame-grilled food at decent prices, especially popular for its daily lunch specials, King Club Sandwich and Burgers. 

* Georgian food as it is done in Georgia. It's well out of the way, but that's a good thing. Almost everyone at this restaurant is local (although the menu has English), and tourists are not in sight, so the food here is good and great value. Try the Khinkali or the Harcho.

* Offers generous portions of Russian food. In the warm summer months, people dine on the terrace. In winter, they head down to the warm cellar. To fill up, get a small zakuski (which is anything but small) appetizer plate. It's big enough for three and costs €9, then dip your pelmeni dumplings (costing €6) in smetana or the other sauces provided and wash it down with a shot of vodka (€5).

* The "Vikings' Village" is 29 kilometers from the city, next to Pirita river and Tallinn-Tartu highway, but in a deep forest is a scenic place with a tavern, accommodation and its own small lake, from where everyone can catch their own fish and let it cooked. It is suitable for a day out with kids but too tacky for adults.

Splurge

* Modern Asian kitchen supervised by Alan Yau from Hakasan, London. The modern and warm interior make you feel like you're in Singapore. Reservations recommended.

* Good traditional Estonian restaurant close to the main square. Try the house beer or vodka and fresh buckthorn and honey apertif with your blood sausage or the famous pork knuckle with extra spicy mustard. The traditional desserts are also worth a try. From Sept to May on Fri and Sat nights live traditional music.

* The ruling king among Tallinn's purely touristy restaurants with some of them trying to copy its style. The place is simply medieval, not just in terms of food but also in the sense of performance - no electricity, no music except live and authentic, no modern inventions. The house special is bear meat "marinated in rare spices and cooked over a fire in honor of Waldemar II, the brave King of Denmark" costing €40+. Try one of the extraordinary beers, such as honey beer. It is not likely that you will meet any locals here. Worth going here just to see the toilets.

* Tasty medieval fare, great wine & cheese. Book at their website.

Drink

Tallinn's crazy nightlife is out of proportion to the city's small size. The days of armed mafiosos are over and these days any drunken fights tend to involve British or German stag parties. Exercise some caution in choosing your venue, as some strip clubs and regular clubs make their money by fleecing tourists who come in for a drink. In local places, beers cost €3,5-5.

Bars and pubs

* Plenty of beer types to choose from in this large authentically styled and decorated Bavarian Beer hall, including 5 of their own beers made on site. Try the Medovar Honey beer.
* Small bar. Only plays Depeche Mode.

* British-style pub, with one of the widest selections of beers in the Old Town. Good English-style pub-grub, featuring award winning fish and chips. Not the cheapest place in town, but it's usually worth stopping off for a pint. Can get quite busy over weekends, but stag parties usually don't find it.

* The name means 'the gentle wolf' in Estonian. A comfortable and homey pub in the Old Town and offers a wide selection of beers (including two of their own brews) and some pretty decent food. Don't miss the spare ribs.

* Founded 1935 by local art community and claiming to have had the best accessible cuisine in whole former USSR since 1958 during the Russian occupation.

* Laboratory themed bar known for its shots in testtubes. You should definitely try The "Brain Scan".

* A cozy alternative bar in Old Town with a small dance floor.

* Located on the top floor of the Radisson Blu Hotel, it offers spectacular views of Old Town and the Baltic sea from a trendy indoor setting and a breathtaking outdoor terrace. Lounge 24 serves a variety of light fares to full dinner menu, and a wide selection of beverages. Open to the general public.

* Legendary place with perhaps the worst service in town, popular with tourists. Good sports bar, but usually overrun with drunken tourists from all around. If that's your kind of thing, go for it.

* Estonia's first gourmet beer bar. Serves some excellent imports from some of the best brewers around the world. Probably the most expensive pub-cum-bar in the city, and nothing bigger than snacks served in the way of food, but the beer is truly excellent.

* Texas-style cantina is a casual place to knock back a Corona or a Bud, or even to try out the frozen margaritas churning in the electric mixer behind the bar. More serious drinkers can try the ‘tequila flights’ - 3 or 5 shots of different tequilas to give you a sampling, not that you’re likely to remember which was which next time around. 

* An avant-garde theatre/bar.

Nightclubs

* This is a large matchbox of a building and, for a long time, it was the tallest modern building in Tallinn. It's very centrally located at the edge of the Old Town. In the Soviet days, when Tallinn was a hotbed of espionage, Viru was the city's premier hotel and every single room was famously bugged by the KGB. Today it's just a very good Finnish-run business hotel, and even the gray facade has been whitewashed.

Stay safe

While Tallinn is generally safe, various governments warn against the dangers of being pickpocketed or mugged, particularly in the Old Town. Watch your valuables closely, especially on public transport and around Viru Street.

The biggest trap to tourists in Tallinn is getting ripped off by taxi drivers or in "gentlemen clubs". Many of the latter are known for their exorbitant prices and hidden "fees". Credit card skimming and other similar scams are common practices in those establishments. Stay away, unless you particularly enjoy losing your month's pay in just a few hours. Both of the formerly stigmatized outskirts, Kopli and Lasnamäe respectively, are in fact very safe, particulary in comparison with the "bad neighborhoods" in Western-European or North-American cities.

People who arrive in Tallinn by camper van or just by car should be careful and not leave their valuables in their vehicles. Unfortunately, foreign-plated cars getting looted is quite commonplace. These kinds of crimes are committed mainly in the area of Tallinn's passenger port and nearby streets, where most of the camper vans stop. There are safer official parking lots, but they are often harder to find, their location might not be very convenient, and you have to pay quite a bit of money for parking there.

Watch out for "bike taxis" or cycle rickshaws on the streets surrounding Old Town and the port area (they are banned from entry to most of Old Town)! Firstly, you might get run over by one as the drivers are rather reckless and often ride on sidewalks. Secondly, and more likely, you might end up being asked for up to 50-60 euros for a very short and rather unpleasant ride.

Get out

* Taking a ferry to Helsinki will take you between 1.5h to 3h, depending on the ship. Make sure you depart in the morning so that you can enjoy what the city has to offer without worrying about time. For more details about the Finnish capital, see the article. 

* is about 100 miles south of Tallinn and is known for its swamps and bogs (Soomaa means "land of bogs" in Estonian). Surprisingly, swimming is popular and is said to rejuvenate the skin.

* is about 50km east of Tallinn and is a place to find some nice forests, seasides and swamps, and bogs. One of the most suggested places to go there is Viru Raba (Viru bog), which has a 5km foot track and watching tower. You can also start and finish in the same location if You go to the tower and back or take a round trip back to start around the bog. There are good maps and information tables on the track. Popular tours to National Park are organized by City Bike, daily.

* village is about 40km east of Tallinn on the coast. The village has 2km long beach area with pine tree forests edging right up to the shore.

* - Estonia's student town, 2-3 hours by car or bus to the southeast.

* Kau Manor is one hour drive from Tallinn and it is worth visiting as it is one of the oldest manors in Estonia. Nowadays there is a luxurious hotel.

* Jägala Falls. The Jägala Falls (Jägala juga) is Estonia's largest waterfall. It is better to go early in the morning to catch the soft dawn light or in the evening when the sun shines on the falls. During cold winters, Jägala Falls freezes in a spectacular fashion and is well worth the effort of reaching there. It is located 34 km from Tallinn, in the direction of the E20 highway to Narvu. To reach, rent a car (a 15-30 min car drive) or take one of the not-so-frequent buses to Koogi Kauplus from Tallinn (J1, 154, or 152B). From Koogi, it is a 1-km walk down Jägala-Joa tee. Alternatively, take a bus that stops on the E20 highway (242A), but it is a long walk (~3 km) and signboards are few. Carry your own food and water; there are no shops or cafes at the waterfall. There is a small supermarket at Koogi near the bus stop, selling packed snacks like biscuits and pies.
