Understand

The word Vilnius is a masculine form of the Vilnia river's name (which is feminine) and refers to the river surge. Therefore, the spelling in other languages (Vilna, Wilna, Vilno, Wilno) is the same word adapted to the corresponding grammar. The area has been inhabited since the Mesolithic era, but it only became a capital city in 1323 when Grand Duke Gediminas transferred the Seat from to Vilnius. A monument to Gediminas (author of the concept is a Lithuanian-American sculptor Vytautas Kašuba) stands in Cathedral Square near the site of the former pagan temple. The Grand Duke is depicted at the monument when he made a final decision, dismounted from his horse, and blessed the land which essentially became the capital. It's known that its glory would echo like an iron-wolf-like sound throughout the world. The howling Iron Wolf from the Grand Duke's prophetic dream is depicted below. You can find these two key names, Gediminas and the Iron Wolf (Geležinis vilkas), along with the motif of the howling iron wolf quite often everywhere in Vilnius. They are branched into the forms of daily life so they are often overlooked unless you're purposely looking for them.

History and people

Vilnius has always been a multi-national city populated with Lithuanians, Poles, Germans, and Slavs from the immemorial time, later on with Jews as well. Although the original city location was lost due to erosion, the present-day Old Town reappeared in the Middle Ages. These inhabitants were forced to settle down there since the heights of a Vilnia river bank made it impossible to live elsewhere. The colonies of German and Ruthenian merchants and missionaries existed prior to that and evolved into German Town and Ruthenian Town. Then afterward, the towns turned into suburbs and finally fully integrated into the city. Now, they can be identified by a cute Lutheran Kirche hidden in numerous courtyards of the Old Town or a complex of the Orthodox Monastery and Church of the Holy Spirit. Since 1652, Vilnius formally became one of the principal cities for Lithuanian Jews and became a symbolic capital of Jewish culture in 1661. The Jews of Vilnius in the 19th century were constantly increasing the economical factor, which remained so until 22 June 1941. According to the data of the Jewish Community of Lithuania 70,000 out of the 100,000 victims murdered by the Nazis and their Lithuanian collaborators at the forest of Paneriai were Jews from Vilnius (mostly polish jews) and surrounding regions.

After the decisions made at the Yalta Conference after the war, the Soviets expelled most of the urban Polish population to and the newcomers (mostly workers and military) arrived from Russian SFSR. During extensive urbanization through 1950-1970, more people from other parts of , neighboring parts of , as well as , and other Soviet republics arrived and became an integral part of the city population.

By plane
*IATA|VNO Lost baggage information: +370 610 75212, lostfound@bgs.aero. The largest civil airport in Lithuania is located 4.6km south of both bus and train stations, and 6.22km from the city center, as measured by the transport routes. The airport is very compact and consists of one dual building. The original part was constructed in 1944 in Socialist Classicism style, but now serves as an arrivals terminal and retains all flaky Soviet-style details, except for the gloomy mood. In 1993 the building was substantially expanded by constructing a new modern departure terminal in late High Tech Architecture style, best seen when viewed from the side of the runway. The city bus stop is immediately next to the main entrance and the taxis can be found just in front of the arrivals terminal.

The bus number's trailing letter "G" on a green background stands for "Greitasis" which means "Express bus". It stops at all relevant stops in the center while skipping some regular stops before and after the center.
*Taxi. It is recommended that you follow the local practice and book the taxi before arrival. Use taxi apps for mobile phones like Taxi.lt, Bolt, Uber, or eTaksi. These apps show the estimated fares before your ride. There are also taxis waiting at the airport in front of the arrivals terminal. In order to avoid misunderstandings, know your destination because all average prices are for the distance from the airport to the bus station (c. €10) or the center (c. €15), but if your hotel is somewhere further than the price it can be double or triple. Prices per kilometer are not fixed so they are highly dependent on fuel prices therefore all figures above should be interpreted as approximate.

Get around

Bellow, in many places there will be mentioned "New Town" one of the Vilnius regions "Naujamiestis" which have long since ceased to be a new town. That was the name of that era.

By Public Transport
"Susisiekimo paslaugos" operates buses and trolleybuses in Vilnius. A single ticket for either bus or trolleybus use costs ~€0.70/30min if a Vilniečio kortelė (Vilnius Citizen Card) is purchased on the mobile as Trafi app, also from a kiosk, "PayPost" outlet, Post office, or "Maxima" supermarket for €1.50. When changing buses, be oriented for a limited time. Tickets need to be validated at the yellow electronic readers. Validate your ticket immediately after boarding the vehicle.

Taxi from the airport to the city center is very expensive if you take it to the taxi stop and a better option is to take the public bus or rent a car.

See

*It is one of the last surviving parts of the city’s historic wall, built in the 17th century.
*57m high belfry was erected in 16th century on a base of the Gothic tower of the Lower Castle defensive wall. The tower base is round, while the Baroque belfry features an octagonal plan. Approximately between the Bell Tower and Cathedral, in the square, look for a particular tile with the word "Stebuklas" (Lithuanian for "miracle") written on it. Stand on it, make a wish and turn around three times. Your wish should come true. This tile also marks the southern end of the Vilnius-Tallinn in the 1989 protest of the Soviet Union.
*The castle name, usually translated as "Crooked" or "Curved", refers to its irregular plan. A remaining archaeological site locates on Bleak Hill, also known as Three Crosses Hill. This and a few other nearby hills mark the site of the original irregular "Y" shape citadel with perimeter defense fortification. River Vilnia below in the west was an additional natural obstacle. Dwellers lived further east. Deep ravines between the hills reflect the position of the former unpaved streets which was the cause of the ensuing massive erosion. The Crooked Castle was besieged in 4-16 Sept 1390, broken in using the Welsh Cat technique and burned down by the Prussian-Livonian army, with the help of French and English mercenaries. It was a conflict between two Lithuanian monarchs: Grand Duke Vytautas allied with the Teutonic Knights against his cousin Jagiełło, who by that time became the King of Poland.
*Reserve was established in 1997 to preserve historical, spiritual and cultural center of the state. Covers an area of 57.5 ha and comprises both Upper and Lower Castles, a Cathedral with surrounding lowland called Šventaragio slėnis (Holy Horn Valley), the western part of Kalnų parkas (Hill Park) along Vilnia river. The latter now has several hills and many ditches, which before erosion were the steep strong and fortified banks of the Vilnius River, the first original place in Vilnius.
*It is a city area which began to develop extensively around the Middle Ages and it eventually became surrounded by a defensive wall after some time. The wall has long been distinguished by a solid environment and form, but now this area is called the Old Town and has a separate status in the administrative division of Vilnius. While the urban structure reflects the earliest development from the 14th century, the architecture of the buildings is mostly from the Baroque and Classicism periods with some examples of Renaissance and Gothic, to a lesser extent. One should keep in mind that medieval Vilnius was once a wooden city. The huge fires ravaged Vilnius several times from 1513 to 1749. Therefore, many buildings of the 19th and 20th centuries (still considered new) have Gothic and Renaissance cellars, many of which now are occupied with restaurants, bars, or shops. One particular nice area is a block of artisan guilds that is notorious because of its evil fate of 6 September 1941 when the two Jewish ghettos, commonly known as Vilnius Ghetto, were established. The ghetto operated until 24&nbsp;Sept&nbsp;1943. In 1994, the Old Town was added to the .
*Gediminas castle tower, Three Crosses Hill, Bokšto skveras Puckoriai outcrop observation deck, Palace Verkiai observation deck.
*This large palace dates back to the 16th century, when it was used as the Bishop's Palace. In the 18th century the building was enlarged and became the Governor-General's residence. It was visited by Tsar Alexander I of Russia, King Louis XVIII of France, and Napoleon. Since Lithuania's independence in 1991, the palace has served as the official residence of the President of Lithuania. If the Standard (a dark red flag with the country's coat of arms) is flying over the palace, the President is at home. The Changing of the Guard takes place daily at 18:00. However, if you want to see traditional pageantry, then go to the palace on Sundays at noon and watch the soldiers take part in a flag-raising ceremony, wearing ceremonial uniforms and medieval armoury. Tours of the palace are by appointment only.
*Reconstructed early Baroque style Royal Residence has 2 exhibition tour routes related to the historical functions of this palace: the 1st one shows its historical and architectural development, the 2nd route brings you into the ceremonial halls and the special Treasury Hall.
*Small artworks, dedications mounted on the walls of the street. Dedications to the literature workers: writers, translators, everyone who has a link with Lithuania and is important for Lithuanian or world literature. Artworks crafted in various outdoor-proof techniques: ceramics, sculpture, glass, wall painting.
*The red-brick tower, a part of the Upper Castle fortifications. Houses an exposition of archaeological findings and other exhibits. The national flag was first raised on its top in 1919 when the country regained independence from Russia. Since then the tower is an important state and historic symbol of Vilnius and of Lithuania itself. Visitors can ascend the mountain by a historic path and a lift from the inner courtyard of the Old Arsenal.
*Central building of the Old Town. The first Gothic style Town Hall was built in 1432 in the very same place as it is today. It was reconstructed several times until the city clock tower collapsed and damaged the significant part of the main building. The new Classical style building was completed in 1799 and so remains to date. Since 2001 it operates as a public institution, organizes representative and protocol events, various ceremonies, celebrations of public holidays, overall about 300 cultural and educational events are held every year.
*Erected on a top of a large hill-fort in the 9th–14th centuries by Dukes of Lithuania. Approximately at the very end of the 13th century, the Seat due to strategic reasons was transferred from Trakai to Vilnius and the castle was substantially reconstructed. The first castles were wooden, and only in the beginning of 15th century everything was rebuilt in brick and stone. The preserved ruins of Gothic Ducal Palace and surrounding fortifications remain to date. The top of the largest and the only survived tower of the defensive wall offers the best view of Vilnius.
*Part of the Old Town, a largely unrestored area primarily occupied by artists, dreamers, squatters, and drunks. In 1998, the residents unofficially declared the area to be an independent republic, with its own president, anthem, flag, and constitution. Great to visit on April Fools day, when mock border guards stamp passports and the entire area erupts into a party.
*Catholic Cathedral. An original wooden Cathedral was built here in 1251 on a site of the pagan temple. Later, in 1387, a Gothic-style cathedral was built. Now it is a Classical style cathedral built-in 1783-1801 including various forms of previous centuries chapels into a coherent whole so that the most beautiful Baroque chapel of Saint Casimir (originally built in 1623–1636) remained untouched. There were 27 crypts of different depths and sizes under the Cathedral floor. Often overflowed during the spring floods, many times devastated by soldiers looking for treasures during the wars and upheavals, 1968-1989 the crypts were put in order, the permanent exposition was arranged. Visiting crypts is permitted only accompanied by a guide.
*Vilnius University was established in 1579 and is considered to be one of the oldest universities in Central and Eastern Europe. Vilnius University’s St. Johns’ Church Bell Tower is the tallest building in Vilnius Old Town (68 m). 193 authentic wooden stairs lead to the Bell Tower. These stairs or a modern elevator take visitors to the observation deck and open the view to the impressive panorama of the Vilnius Old Town. For guided tours with a museum guide, visitors need a registration.

Drink
The drinking age in Lithuania is 20. Drink carefully as most bars will politely ask you to leave if they notice that you appear drunk (staggering, yelling, grabbing strangers). Falling asleep in bars is not tolerated. If you break a glass, many places will expect to be repaid for it on the spot but it's usually a very reasonable price.

Smoking is banned in all public places, however, a number of nightclubs have internal smoke rooms; the ventilation can be of variable quality. If you leave a club to smoke outside, make sure you get stamped and get eye contact from the bouncers so you won't have problems getting back in.

Stay safe

Vilnius is a relatively safe city; however, crimes do occur. Use typical common sense. 

The area around the central train station is particularly dodgy and frequented by prostitutes and their clients. Being drunk and acting obviously foreign in the middle of the night is a bad idea. If you have traveled from out of town to visit a nightclub or other venue, take a taxi to and from your venue, and on return to the railway station remain in the ticket hall, which is patrolled by security guards.

It is recommended not to enter South Vilnius suburbs, including Naujininkai and Kirtimai, especially at night, as well as some parts of Šnipiškės which are located any deeper than its business district.

Taxis in tourist areas can overcharge 3 times the normal rate.

Cope

Emergency number
Similarly to the rest of Europe, the emergency number is 112, it would work for free even when roaming (even in a phone without a sim!)

Left luggage
The coin-operated baggage lockers in the cellar of the railway station are a secure place to store bags and other items. Ensure that nobody is around when you are getting the receipt, because there are thieves who pretend to be station staff.
