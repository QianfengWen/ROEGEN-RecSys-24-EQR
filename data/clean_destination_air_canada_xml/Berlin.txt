Berlin is the capital city of and one of the 16 states (Länder) of the Federal Republic of Germany. 

Berlin is the largest city in Germany. Berlin is best known for its historical associations as the German capital, internationalism and tolerance, lively nightlife, its many cafés, clubs, bars, street art, and numerous museums, palaces, and other sites of historic interest. Berlin's architecture is quite varied. Although badly damaged in the final years of World War II and broken apart during the Cold War, Berlin has reconstructed itself greatly, especially with the reunification push after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.

Now it is possible to see representatives of many different historic periods in a short time within the city center, from a few surviving medieval buildings near Alexanderplatz to the ultra-modern glass and steel structures in Potsdamer Platz. Because of its tumultuous history, Berlin remains a city with many distinctive neighborhoods. Brandenburger Tor is a symbol of division during the world war, which now shows German reunification. It was built after the Acropolis in Athens and was completed in 1799 as the royal gate of the city. 

Germany was later on divided into east and west, In August 13 1961, East Germans permanently closed the border between East and West. The wall had 45,000 sections of reinforced concrete and included 79 miles of fencing, nearly 300 watchtowers, and 250 guard dogs. Still, more than 5,000 people escaped to freedom. 

Districts
Its boroughs can roughly be grouped into six districts:

History
The foundation of Berlin was very multicultural. The surrounding area was populated by Germanic Swabian and Burgundian tribes, as well as Slavic Wends in pre-Christian times, and the Wends have stuck around. Their modern descendants are the Sorbian Slavic-language minority who live in villages southeast of Berlin near the Spree River.

At the beginning of the 13th century, two towns (Berlin and Cölln) developed on each side of the river Spree (today the Nikolaiviertel and the quarter next to it beyond the river). As the population grew, the towns merged and Berlin became a center for commerce and agriculture. This area stayed small (about 10,000 inhabitants) up to the late 17th century, because of the 30 years of war at the beginning of the 17th century, which led to the death of about half of the population. 

Since the late 17th century, when large numbers of French Huguenots fled religious persecution, Berlin has welcomed religious, economic, and other asylum seekers. In 1701 Berlin became the capital of Prussia and in 1710 Berlin and surrounding former autonomous cities were merged into a bigger Berlin. 

In 1871 Berlin became the capital of the newly founded German Reich and a few years later, it became a city with more than one million inhabitants because of the immensely growing industry. 

Shortly after the first World War, in 1920, the last of the annexations of the surrounding cities of Berlin led to the foundation of Berlin as we know it now. After the coming into power of the National Socialists ("Nazis"), Berlin became the capital of the so-called Third Reich and the domicile and office of Hitler (although the triumph of Hitler and his henchmen started in the south of Germany).

WWII led to the destruction of most of central Berlin, thus many of the buildings which we see nowadays are reconstructed or planned and built after the war, which led to a very fragmented cityscape in most parts of the inner town. Berlin was divided into four sectors (West Berlin into the French, American, and British sectors, and East Berlin belonged to the USSR). In 1949 the German Democratic Republic ("East Germany") was founded with East Berlin as its capital. West Berlin remained occupied by the western Allies and kept a close relationship with West Germany (with as the capital) and was an exclave (political island) in East Germany. Because of the growing tensions between West Germany and the GDR, the GDR built a militarized and increasingly impassable border between the states, and then in 1961 surrounded West Berlin with a wall. 

In late 1989 East German citizens began to peacefully demonstrate in increasing numbers; this led to the fall of the Berlin Wall. In 1990 West Germany and East Germany were united. Berlin became once again the capital of Germany.

After WW2 and the building of the wall, large numbers of immigrants from Turkey were invited to West Berlin to work in the growing industry sector; in East Berlin, the jobs were done mostly by Vietnamese immigrants. But also people from other communist countries, including the former Yugoslavia, not to mention Soviet soldiers who refused to return home, have helped to make Berlin more multicultural than ever. 

Berlin is also a youth-oriented city. Before German unification, West Berliners were exempt from the West German civil/military service requirement. Social activists, pacifists, and anarchists of all moved to Berlin for that reason alone. Musicians and artists were given state subsidies. It was easy to stay out all night thanks to liberal bar licensing laws, and staying at university for years without ever getting a degree was a great way to kill time. In contrast with most of Germany, Prenzlauer Berg is said to have the highest per-capita birth rate in Europe (in fact it just seems so because of the high percentage of young women in the district).

After the fall of the wall, Berlin - especially the former East - has evolved into a cultural hub. Artists and other creative souls flocked to the city in swarms after reunification, primarily due to the extremely low cost of living in the East. Despite the increased prices and gentrification, as a result, Berlin has become a center for art, design, multimedia, electronic music, and fashion among other things. The particularly high number of students and young people in the city has only helped this cause. Just stroll down a street in Prenzlauer Berg, Friedrichshain, or Mitte to get a glimpse of the new East Berlin.

Some famous artists of the region and their best-known works include Lucas Cranach the Elder, Lucas Cranach the Younger, Johann Gottfried Schadow, Marlene Dietrich (The Blue Angel), Leni Riefenstahl (Triumph of the Will), Bertolt Brecht (Threepenny Opera), Käthe Kollwitz, Kurt Tucholsky, Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Walter Gropius, Paul Klee, Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau (Nosferatu), Fritz Lang (Metropolis), Volker Schlöndorff, Wim Wenders (Wings of Desire (German: Der Himmel über Berlin)), Blixa Bargeld/Einstürzende Neubauten, Christopher Isherwood, Gunter Grass (The Tin Drum), members of the Bauhaus architectural movement and many more.

People
Berlin is a relatively young city by European standards, dating to the thirteenth century, and it has always had a reputation as a place filled with people from elsewhere. It may seem tough to find someone born and raised here! This is part of Berlin's charm: it never gets stuck in a rut.

A certain uneasy détente still exists between some former residents of East and West Berlin (and Germany). Wessi evolved as a derogatory nickname for a West German; its corollary is Ossi. The implication here is that after reunification, the West Germans automatically assumed the way they do things is the right way and the way the Easterners should start doing it, too. Westerners got a reputation for being arrogant. They saw the Easterners as stubborn Communist holdouts interested only in a handout from the "rich West." Consider a shirt for sale in a shop inside the Alexanderplatz Deutsche Bahn station: Gott, schütze mich vor Sturm und Wind/und Wessies die im Osten sind ("God, protect me from the storm and wind, and Wessies who are in the East"). Another such stereotype is reflected by the short poem: Der Ossi ist schlau und stellt sich dumm, beim Wessi ist es andersrum ("The Ossi is sly and pretends to be simple-minded, and with the Wessi, it's the other way around"). However, most of the younger generation do not share such prejudices.

Talk
German is of course the main language in Berlin but you can easily find information in English and sometimes in French. Due to the football World Cup in 2006, all public transportation staff got language training and should be able to help you in English (although probably with a strong German accent). If you seem to be lost or hesitating in a public transport station a member of staff could come to your assistance but don't count on that. You can easily approach a group of (preferably young) bystanders and ask for advice in English.

Most people under 40 in Berlin are able to speak English with varying degrees of fluency, but it might not be as widely spoken as you might expect, so a few key German phrases are worth having, especially in the suburbs and less touristy places. Basic French and Russian is partly spoken because French in West Berlin and Russian in East Berlin were taught in schools.

There are also 400,000 people of Turkish origin living in Berlin - mainly in the Kreuzberg, Wedding, and Neukölln districts. Many of them arrived in the early 1960s from remote villages in Anatolia as guest workers but stayed on. Do not expect them to speak decent Turkish, or any willingness to speak any Turkish at all.

There are some words in Berlin that differ from regular German, especially in the former East Berlin. Here, the language preserved a certain level of dialect.

Stulle: Sandwich.

Broiler: grilled chicken (people from west Germany probably won't understand this, they say Grillhähnchen instead).

Bulette: meatball

Pfannkuchen: doughnut (pancake elsewhere in Germany; those are known here as Eierkuchen, literally "egg cake")

Orientation
Berlin is - at least in many parts - a beautiful city, so allow enough time to get to see the sights. A good map is highly recommended. While the public transport system is superb, it can be confusing to visitors, due to a lack of directional signs in some of the larger stations, so a good transit map is also essential. 

Be sure to note the final station/stop of the S-Bahn or U-Bahn, since that is usually the method by which the direction of travel is indicated. Roads into Berlin can also be confusing, so study your route and drive carefully. Signs point to city boroughs or districts rather than indicating compass directions, so it's a good idea to get to know where the various boroughs or districts lie in relation to each other. This also applies to cyclists.

Berlin's Tourist Information Office is an excellent resource for finding out more about Berlin, providing a wealth of practical information and useful links.

Get in
As the city was divided into two during the Cold War, many major parts of Berlin's infrastructure &mdash; such as airports &mdash; were built on both the east and west sides. After the demolition of the Wall, the challenge has been to merge these formerly independent systems into one that serves all people in the metropolitan Berlin area.

Whatever your departure and destination are, if you're planning to move by public rail transport, the Berlin-Brandenburg public transport company offers a very comfortable and customizable service in order to plan your trip just go to their website. 

By plane
Berlin Brandenburg Airport (German: Flughafen Berlin Brandenburg), (), 

The airport is served by the S-Bahn and regional trains. S-Bahn trains to the city leave from Terminal 1 every 20 minutes until 2:00 AM. There are also less regular but faster regional trains (FEX) that cost the same and stop at these major train stations too. In S-Bahn and regional trains between the airport (zone C) and the city (zone AB), the public transport ticket (zones ABC for €3.40) can be used. Stamp the ticket to validate it before boarding.

By train from Berlin. A ticket that will get you anywhere in Berlin will set you back a mere €3.20. Choose the ‘ABC’ single journey ticket (Einzelfahrschein). Now here is the top tip for getting to/ from the airport quickly. A lot of visitors make the mistake of jumping onto the S-Bahn when they arrive. Now it is true that all the guidebooks advise this because the S-Bahn departs every 10 minutes or so. But it is a slow service that stops all the time and can if you are traveling late at night, easily takes you an hour to get to the middle of Berlin. A far better, quicker and more comfortable option is to use the Regional trains. So… make sure you are taking an Express Train (RE7 or RB14) rather than the S-Bahn (S9 or S45). These Express trains run to and from central Berlin (Mitte) every half hour from 5 am-11.30 pm and take approx 25 min to/from Alexanderplatz; 30 min to/from Berlin Hauptbahnhof and 35 min to/from Zoologischer Garten. There are two of these every hour (look for the RE7 or RB14) and, as of the time of writing, they leave the airport station at 25 minutes and 55 minutes past the hour. The trains are big and comfortable and run a far quicker service.

And if you do find yourself on either the S9 or the S45 in error, don’t panic, you’ll make it in the end. The S9 runs every 20 minutes and if all goes smoothly, it will take you approx 30 min to/from Ostkreuz and 45 minutes to/from Pankow, while the S45 connects to the circle-line (Ringbahn) and also runs every 20 minutes.

Various providers offer taxi and limousine services at the airport. As a normal paying guest, just take a taxi from the "official" stand. There is no chance of getting a cheaper deal. Pay the official tariff, and persist on the taxi driver to switch on the meter. There is one caveat: Taxi clients may request a specific path to be used (e.g. use the freeway instead of city roads). Suggestions from drivers might lead you through an expensive detour. The magic formula to answer all "tour suggestions" would be: "Please use the shortest way as you learned it at taxi school".

"Special deals" outside the meter are rare in Berlin. The Taxi service is extremely regulated here: Taxi driver unions and courts are - successfully - eager to ban any services which are not licensed according to the vigorous taxi licensing regulations from driving paying guests, and airport authorities will not allow any non-licensed car pick-up clients at the terminals. Thus, there are no "deals" available at the terminals. There might be pre-booked limousine services available to businesses that frequently transfer people from the airport to the city.

Car rental is available through the centralized rental office, located on the western side of the "loop" in front of the main terminal.

There are numerous direct flight connections between Berlin and major German & European cities. For historical reasons intercontinental direct flights to Berlin were limited. The German flag carrier Lufthansa will mostly fly to its major hub airports and and offer connecting flights to Berlin on a near hourly basis.

By bus
Berlin is serviced from over 350 destinations in Europe. Long-distance buses arrive at Zentraler Omnibusbahnhof (Central Bus Terminal) in , Masurenallee. There are numerous buses in all directions or a 5-minute walk to the U-Bahn (Theodor-Heuss-Platz or Kaiserdamm or to the S-Bahn (Messe Nord/ICC). Follow signposting.

Berlin Linien bus serves over 350 destinations in Europe.

Flixbus serves main German and many European cities, including Munich, Stuttgart, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Freiburg, as well as Stockholm, Copenhagen, Prague, Budapest, Zurich, etc.

By train

Berlin is served by ICE, InterCity, and EuroCity trains by the national German train corporation Deutsche Bahn (DB) which offers connections between Berlin and other German and major European cities. 

Night trains from , , and run every day. Popular with backpackers so reservations are strongly recommended. 

Long-haul trains from Eastern European cities, , , , , and amongst others, stop both at Hauptbahnhof and Ostbahnhof. Make sure you have a reservation because these lines are also very popular.

Some private train companies offer connections to smaller cities in Eastern Germany.

Stations
During the times of its division, Berlin had two main train stations Zoologischer Garten (colloquial name Bahnhof Zoo) in the West, and Ostbahnhof in the East. The new 'Hauptbahnhof' may be titled 'Lehrter Bahnhof' on older maps & is situated between the S-Bahn stations Friedrichstrasse and Bellevue. Since the opening of the Hauptbahnhof, most ICE and international lines now bypass Zoologischer Garten, although it is still in operation for regional Deutsche-Bahn service and as a S/U-Bahn station.

The new building for the central station Hauptbahnhof was opened in May 2006 and together with Südkreuz (southern cross) and Ostbahnhof (eastern station) - plus minor Gesundbrunnen in the north and Spandau in the west - form the backbone of all connections. All are connected to either S- or U-Bahn (and in the future, both). All trains travel through a central station and a second major hub (depending on the destination you travel to or arrive from). Trains in the regional area (Berlin and Brandenburg) mostly use these stations. Regional trains stop at several stations within Berlin.

By car
Berlin is encircled by a motorway ring (A10 Berliner Ring), which runs up to 30 km outside the city limits. Following motorways (clockwise) yield to the ring: A 11 to at Dreieck Schwanebeck, A 12 to / at Dreieck Spreeau, A13 to / at Kreuz Schönefeld, A 9 to / at Dreieck Potsdam, A 2 to / at Dreieck Werder, and A 24 to at Dreieck Havelland.

From the ring, there are motorways towards the city: A 111 from the northwest at Kreuz Oranienburg, A114 from the north at Dreieck Pankow, A 113 from the southeast at Schönefelder Kreuz and A115 from the southwest at Dreieck Nuthetal. B96 from the north and the south, B2 from the northeast, B5 from the east and west, and B101 from the south are dual carriageways, which also connect to the city.

Inside Berlin, there is a heavily congested ring motorway (A 100), which encircles the north, west, and south with the northeastern bit missing. Berlin driving is not for the fainthearted, but manageable as there are wide streets and reasonably good parking conditions at least in most parts of the city. Orientation is easier than in most of the central European cities, once you got the system: There are a couple of ring roads (like an onion) and several radiating trunk roads.

Berlin does have a low emission zone (Umweltzone), which contains all areas within the S-Bahn ring. All vehicles moving inside this zone are required to bear a green Emission badge (Feinstaubplakette). There are exceptions eg. for historic cars, but not for foreign number plates. Obtaining a sticker must be done at least several days in advance. The sticker can be ordered online at 

MFG
There is also the option to do carpooling, which is very popular in Germany Mitfahrgelegenheit in German (abbreviated to MFG) is the website where a lot of drivers post their travel destinations, and sharing the ride and fuel costs with one of them can get you to Berlin from Hamburg for as cheap as €10. Usually, on weekends there are cars leaving roughly every 30min throughout the day. Requires a cell phone and sometimes some knowledge of German.

By ship
Being 200 kilometers inland, Berlin does not have a seaport. The nearest seaport is -Warnemünde, which is between two and a half and three hours away by train. Still sold by many cruise ship operators as "Berlin", so don't be surprised. There are similar distances to the seaports of and . 

Some river cruises start or end at Berlin, using Havel, Spree and some canals for cruises to or the Baltic sea.

Get around
Berlin is a huge city. You can make use of the excellent bus, tram, train, and underground services to get around. Taxi services are also easy to use and a bit less expensive than in many other big Central European cities. You can hail a cab (the yellow light on the top of the cab shows its availability), or find a taxi rank (Taxistand). Taxi drivers are in general able to speak English. If you ask for a short trip (Kurzstrecke), as long as it's under 2 km and before the taxi driver starts the meter running, the trip normally is cheaper. This only applies if you flag the taxi down on the street, not if you get in at a taxi rank. Also, some online services like Talixo facilitate the online and in-app booking.

Check the Berlin route planner (in English) to get excellent maps and schedules for the U-Bahn, buses, S-Bahn, and trams, or print your personal journey planner. The route planner can also calculate the fastest door-to-door connection to your destination for any given day and hour. 

If you don't know how to get somewhere, or how to get home at night, call +49 30 19449, the Customer Service of the BVG. There are also facilities in most U-Bahn and some S-Bahn stations to contact Customer Service directly. In 2005 the BVG introduced Metro lines (buses and tram) that run 24 hours a day, seven days a week. All lines are marked with a big orange plate and a white M.

It's also worth noting that the house numbers do not necessarily run in one direction (up or down). On a lot of streets, the numbers ascend on one side and descend on the other. Especially on long streets, check the numbering scheme first: you can find the name of the street and the numbers on that block at nearly every street corner.

Different from what is usual in some English-speaking countries, in Germany, you would have to add the word for "street", "square", "park", etc. when you mention the name of a locality. The simple reason for this is that the annex defines the locality and is part of its denomination. Thus, they would not simply refer to "Kurfürsten" when talking about Kurfürstenstraße (Kurfürsten Street), as this could also mean "Kurfürstendamm", which is a different road at a different place. "Schloss", which simply means "palace", could refer to any of the palaces in Berlin, as well as to one of the two roads called "Schloßstraße", a shopping center called "Das Schloss", or the "Schloßplatz" in the Mitte district.

Public transport ticketing

Berlin uses a zone system, but you are unlikely to need to go beyond zone A and B, except on trips to or to the Schönefeld Airport (SXF). This is a very large area. The public transport system (U, S-Bahn, bus, tram, regional rail) uses a common ticket.

Standard tickets are valid for any travel within two hours of validation, in a single direction, within the appropriate fare zones. There is no limit to transfers. For a single journey, you can buy a cheap Kurzstrecke, but this is only valid for 3 stops on the U-Bahn or S-Bahn (six stops by bus or tram); no transfers are permitted. Reduced tariffs apply for children 6 to 14. Under 6 y/o ride free.

*Berlin WelcomeCard available in 10 different versions. Free travel with all methods of public transport for 48 hours, 72 hours from the hour of validation, or 4, 5, or 6 days from the day of validation (including that day); save up to 50% on more than 200 tourist and cultural highlights; Handy guide in pocket book format with insider tips and tour suggestions; City plan for Berlin and Potsdam and a Network plan for public transport. You can order the Berlin WelcomeCard at various sales points (Berlin airports, main stations, Hotels, or online).

*There is also a Monatskarte which is good for a month - either a calendar month (e.g. March) or a 30-day card (e.g. May 15 to June 14). At the airport information booth near the baggage claim exit, they will direct you outside where there is a ticket booth and you can buy whatever card you want. You don't have to validate it each time you get on any or all of the public transportation (tram, bus, U & S Bahn, Regional express train). You are given a little transparent plastic folder to keep it in (dates are on the card) and you show it only when asked. Getting on the bus, you show it to the driver.

Purchasing tickets
All tickets are available at vending machines on U - and S-Bahn platforms. English and other European languages are available. Payment is mostly by local bank cards, coins, and banknotes. VISA and MasterCard are accepted if you buy your tickets from a manned ticket counter or some ticket machines at Tegel airport. Ticket machines may not take banknotes bigger than 10 euros. If you need assistance most larger stations have staffed ticket counters where you can ask questions and buy tickets. Also, stores that flag a yellow sign with the writing "BVG" sell tickets, but rarely accept credit cards issued abroad. Single tickets and day tickets can be bought by bus drivers. Buses will accept cash, and make changes for tickets. Hotels may sell tickets as well.

The transport authority BVG offers personalized printout tickets, which can be and printed at home. This option applies to all types of tickets that are valid for one day or more. They are only valid for the person whose name has to be stated when ordering, and who is printed on the ticket. That person has to be able to show an "official photo identity card (ID Card, driver's license or passport)" together with the ticket. The first day of validity has to be indicated when ordering. Printout tickets need no further validation at the validator machines.

Furthermore, BVG offers smartphone apps that allow the purchase of tickets, also single tickets, by smartphone after registration. Beware that the validity of those tickets starts only two minutes after the purchase, to prevent people from quickly purchasing an online ticket when, but only when, an inspector shows up.

In some places like Zoologischer Garten and Eberswalder Straße, people may try to sell used tickets to you. Be aware that you can go only in one direction with a single-journey ticket (check the validation stamp and be careful as this could also be a pickpocket ruse). As cases of ticket forgery are not uncommon and fraudsters focus on tourists who wouldn't recognize a forged ticket, it is recommended not to buy tickets from non-authorized dealers, as this could lead to difficult questions if found, on inspection, with such a ticket.

Validating tickets
You need to validate your paper ticket using the machines on the U - and S-Bahn platforms or on the bus. The machines are yellow/white on the U-Bahn and the bus, and red on the S-Bahn platforms. Validation simply means the machine prints a time stamp onto the ticket. Once validated, a ticket that is still valid will not have to be re-validated before every single trip. Unlike other metro systems, the Berlin U - and S-Bahn systems rely on honesty. You can not pay for a ticket and get on a train. However, whilst it might be tempting to try to avoid buying a ticket, be advised that plain-clothed inspectors do patrol the trains frequently. They will stand at the front of the car and ask everyone to pull out their tickets for inspection. There is a civil fine if you are caught with an unvalidated ticket, but the glares you will get from other paying passengers may be worse. That fine is legally construed as a contractual supplemented transport fee, and not as a criminal sanction, which allows the transport authorities to collect those fees at many jurisdictions abroad - and this is actually being implemented. Such fines have successfully been collected in the United Kingdom and in the United States (together with additional lawyers' and courts' fees).

By train
 If you need to get around the city quickly, take the S-Bahn Especially the Ringbahn that goes all around Berlin in a circle lets you get to other parts of the city really fast. If you're looking for the way, use BVG.de, that site includes Buses, U-Bahn, S-Bahn, Tram, and even ferries. You can simply enter the departure address and arrival address to see the optimum connection, it's an excellent service. 

An option to reach Schönefeld airport is to use U-Bahn line 7 until the terminal station Rudow and then take the bus.

In the center, most S-Bahn lines S5, S7, S75 run on an east-west route between Ostkreuz and Westkreuz via the stops Warschauer Straße, Ostbahnhof, Jannowitzbrücke, Alexanderplatz, Hackescher Markt, Friedrichstraße, Hauptbahnhof, Bellevue, Tiergarten, Zoologischer Garten, Savignyplatz and Charlottenburg. Other lines run along a circular track around the city, most notably the S8 and the S41, S42, S45, and S46 lines, and there's also a north-south connection S1, S2, S25 from Gesundbrunnen through Friedrichstraße and Potsdamer Platz to Südkreuz or Schöneberg.

Regional trains run along the same central east-west connection, but stop only at Lichtenberg or Karlshorst, Ostkreuz, Ostbahnhof, Alexanderplatz, Friedrichstraße, Hauptbahnhof, Zoologischer Garten, Charlottenburg, and Spandau or Wannse, as well as other lines connecting north-south from Jungfernheide or Gesundbrunnen through Hauptbahnhof, Potsdamer Platz and Südkreuz to Lichterfelde-Ost. Long-distance trains mostly run to Hauptbahnhof, often with one or two extra stops at other stations.

By underground

 The Berlin U-Bahn (subway/metro) is something to behold; it is so charmingly precise! All U-Bahn stations now have electronic signs that give the time of the next train, and its direction based on sensors along the lines. 

Detailed maps can be found at every U-Bahn station and on the trains. Don't be confused by the alternative tram maps. U-Bahn stations can be seen from far by their big, friendly blue U signs. The U-Bahn provides a transportation network throughout greater Berlin that is extremely efficient and fast. On weekends (Friday to Sunday), as well as during the Christmas and New Year holidays, all U-Bahn and S-Bahn lines (except line U4) run all night, so returning from late-night outings is easy, especially given the average start time of most 'parties' in Berlin (11 PM to 1 AM). During the week there is no U-Bahn or S-Bahn service from appr. 1 AM to 4:30AM, but metro trams/buses and special Night Buses (parallel to the U-Bahn line) run every half an hour from 12:30AM to 4:30AM.

By tram
 The trams (Straßenbahn) are mostly found in East Berlin, as in West Berlin the tram lines were removed to facilitate more vehicular traffic. If you don't have a ticket already, you can buy one inside the tram.

Two types of tram service are available. Metro trams frequent more often as well as by night. 

By bus
 Although buses are the slowest form of public transport, the yellow double-decker buses are part of Berlin's transit landscape and they will take you to almost anywhere in Berlin. Besides the normal metro buses, there are also express buses (indicated by an X), but these don't halt at every stop. 

The most famous bus line, especially for tourists, is bus route 100 or 200, which leaves from Zoo Station ("Berlin Zoologischer Garten") or, if you want to take the other way round, Alexanderplatz. This crosses most of historic Berlin, including many of the sites listed here. For the price of a city bus ticket or daily pass, is possible to see many of the landmarks of Berlin from one of these yellow double-decker buses. Sit up atop as it's easier to see the Bundestag, as well as the many historic buildings on Unter den Linden. If you're lucky, you'll get the legendary bus driver who delivers a commentary (in Berlin-accented German) on the trip. Line 200 takes nearly the same route, but it goes through the modern quarters around Kulturforum (Philharmonie, museums) and Potsdamer Platz. Either ride is a must for any visitor to Berlin.

By bike
Cycling is another great way to tour Berlin. Berlin has no steep hills and offers many bicycle paths (Radwege) throughout the city (although not all are very smooth). These include 860 km of completely separate bike paths, 60 km of bike lanes on streets, 50 km of bike lanes on footpaths, 100 km of mixed-use pedestrian+bike paths, and 70km of combined bus-bike lanes on streets. Bicycles are a very popular method of transport among Berlin residents, and there is almost always a certain level of bicycle traffic. Seeing Berlin by bicycle is unquestionably a great way to acquaint the traveler with the big tourist sites, and the little sprees and side streets as well. Although it's good to carry your own map, you can also always check your location at any U-Bahn station and many bus stops. 

Even if you are a tourist, be careful of other tourists in very "touristy" areas. Many of them do not know the concept of bicycle paths (Radwege). Once they stay in your way, do not expect them to understand that they have to move, or what a bicycle bell ring might mean, and rather plan for a workaround. Ask fellow tourists to stay clear of marked bicycle paths for their own safety. In general, get acquainted with the basic rules of the road, but do not necessarily expect everyone else to act according to them. Particular attention should be given to motor vehicles on your left which are about to turn right.

See
Art galleries
As Berlin is a city of art, it is quite easy to find an art gallery on your way. They provide a nice opportunity to have a look at modern artists' work in a not-so-crowded environment for free.
Some gallery streets with more than about a dozen galleries are Auguststraße, Linienstraße, Torstraße, Brunnenstraße (all Mitte, north of S-Bahn station Oranienburger Straße), Zimmerstraße (Kreuzberg, U-Bahn station Kochstraße) and Fasanenstraße (Charlottenburg). You can find a list of all the exhibitions and gallery openings as well as a map on Berlin Art Grid A directory listing of all Berlin's art galleries can be found on The Art of Berlin: Complete Berlin Art Gallery Directory 
*Galerie Eigen & Art, Auguststraße 26, Tel. +49 30 280 6605 One of the most famous German art galleries, home to the Neue Leipziger Schule (Neo Rauch et al.).
*loop - raum fur aktuelle kunst Jägerstrasse 5, 10117. Known for being the "incubator" of future famous Berlin artists. Primarily featuring sculpture videos and paintings.

Churches

There are some historically interesting and architecturally remarkable churches which are the following:
*Berliner Dom The biggest and most impressive church in Berlin, built at the turn of the century (19th/20th) as an expression of imperial power. Located next to the museum island. You can climb on top of the dome for a beautiful view of the Berlin center.
*Kaiser Wilhelm Gedächtniskirche Highly symbolic church, dating back to 1891-95, with two modern buildings designed by Egon Eiermann in 1961, a hexagonal bell tower and an octagonal worship hall, aside the ruins from World War II.

*New Synagogue (Neue Synagoge), Oranienburger Straße, Today the building houses the Centrum Judaicum foundation which opened in 1995, an institution for the preservation of Jewish memory and tradition, a community congregation center for study and teaching.

*Zoo. Berlin has two zoos and an aquarium The Berlin Zoo in the west is a historic zoo that has been a listed company since its foundation. It's an oasis in the city and very popular with families and schools.

History

Berlin does not attempt to hide the less savory parts of its history: a visit to the Topography of Terror (Niederkirchnerstraße 8), for example, provides interesting but sobering insights into the activities of the Gestapo in Berlin during the Nazi years (1933-1945). Many of the walking tours also discuss scenes both of Nazi activity and of Cold War tension and terror.
*Berliner Mauer in Bösebrücke (Address: Bornholmer Str. 70, 13359 Berlin)]

*Checkpoint Charlie. It is a crossing point between East and West Berlin during the Cold War, is no more. Formerly, it was the only border crossing between East and West Berlin that permitted foreigners passage. Residents of East and West Berlin were not allowed to use it. This contributed to Checkpoint Charlie's mythological status as a meeting place for spies and other shady individuals. Now the remains of the Berlin Wall have been moved to permit building, including the construction of the American Business Center and other institutions not given to flights of John Le Carré-inspired fancy. At the intersection of Zimmerstraße and Friedrichstraße (U-Bahn Kochstraße U6) is the famous "You Are Leaving the American Sector" sign. The actual guardhouse from Checkpoint Charlie is now housed at the Allied Museum on Clayallee. For a more interesting exhibit go to the Haus am Checkpoint Charlie. This is a private museum with kitschy memorabilia from the Wall as well as the devices GDR residents used to escape the East (including a tiny submarine!). Checkpoint Charlie gained its name from the phonetic alphabet; checkpoints "Alpha" and "Bravo" were at the autobahn checkpoints Helmstedt and Dreilinden respectively. Checkpoint Charlie's atmosphere was not improved at all on 27 October 1961 when the two Cold War superpowers chose to face each other down for a day. Soviet and American tanks stood approximately 200 meters apart, making an already tense situation worse. 
*Domfriedhof St. Hedwig (Intersection of Liesenstraße & Gartenstraße) Domfriedhof St. Hedwig, Liesenstraße 8, 10115 Berlin / St. Hedwig-Friedhof I, Liesenstraße 8, 10115 Berlin / Dorotheenstadt Friedhof II, Berlin
*Gutspark Groß Glienicke / Berliner Mauerreste (Address: Am Park 14B, 14476 Potsdam)
*Mauerpark (Address: Bernauer Straße 63-64, Berlin)
*Memorial is on Bernauer Straße which itself is a street with a great deal of Wall history: the notorious killing by guards of Peter Fechter was here, as was one of the famous tunnels and the famous photograph of the GDR border guard leaping over the barbed wire. Various monuments can be found along the entire length of the street, documenting nearby escape attempts and tunnels; captions are in German, English, French, and Russian. The Memorial itself is a complete section of the 4th generation wall - both inside and outside sections, and you can peer through from the east side to see the remains of the electric fence and anti-tank devices in the death strip. It really helps you understand what an incredible feat it was to get from one side to the other -- and why so many died doing it. Memorial site opening times: Daily, 6:00 AM – 10:00 PM. Documentation and Visitors‘ Centre opening times: Tu – Su 9:30 AM – 6:00 PM. Free admission.
*Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe Opened in the spring of 2005, this gigantic abstract artwork covers an entire block near the Brandenburg Gate, including an underground museum with extensive details on the Holocaust and the people who died during it. The blocks start out at ground level on the outer edges of the memorial and then grow taller towards the middle, where the ground also slopes downwards. 3.5 million visitors in the first year make it one of the most visited memorials in Berlin - and it's worth it, as it's one of the most impressive memorials in Berlin.

*Remains of the Wall at the cemetery Invalidenfriedhof It is not widely known but at the Invalidenfriedhof you can still see very well where the Berlin Wall was. Some parts are still there to check out. Watchtower Berlin Wall at Kieler Strasse At Kieler Strasse, near the Invalidenfriedhof, you can find one of the most interesting watchtowers of the Berlin Wall. Not only because it is one of the few remaining watchtowers. But mostly, because it is a small museum for the first victim of the Berlin Wall: Gunter Litfin. 
*Schlesischer Busch, Lohmühlenstraße 1, 12435 Berlin. The East German border installations once ran in parallel to the Flutgraben channel. This former border strip between Treptow and Kreuzberg has become a green zone along the length of the Flutgraben. A few meters of the hinterland Wall painted after the fall of the Wall have been preserved. The Schlesischer Busch watch tower also remains and now hosts a changing series of exhibitions. 
*Tempelhof airport was used in the Berlin Airlift (Berliner Luftbrücke) in 1948-49; in 1951 a monument was added to commemorate the airlifts over the Berlin Blockade. The airport was featured in movies like Billy Wilder's "One Two Three". The terminal building is still fascinating; the halls and neighboring buildings, intended to become the gateway to Europe, are still known as the largest built entities worldwide, and were described by British architect Sir Norman Foster as "the mother of all airports".

Landmarks with observation decks

While Berlin has relatively few high-rise buildings, there are several monuments with observation decks. Probably the most famous of all is the TV Tower near Alexanderplatz, the tallest tower in Germany and the second highest in Europe.
*Berliner Fernsehturm, Alexanderplatz This TV tower is Germany's tallest construction at 368m high. The observation deck is 204 m above ground. Be wary of the weather changing; the fog can come in during the rather long queues and you may not be able to see anything at the top when you eventually reach it. There is a rotating restaurant at the top spinning 360 degrees in just 30 minutes and a bar in the observation deck. You need to buy tickets from the ticket office, then join a separate queue to get into the tower. The last elevator up is at 23:00 and the last down is at 23:30.
*Berliner Funkturm 150m high lattice tower with an open-air observation deck 124m above ground. The only observation tower on insulators! Located in the Western fair district, outside the city center.
*Kollhoff Tower Potsdamer Platz. The fastest elevator in Europe takes you approximately 100 meters high. Daily 10:00-18:00. 
*Reichstag building - Bundestag. The German Parliament building near the Brandenburg Gate, was renovated by Sir Norman Foster and reopened in 1999 with a spectacular new glass dome, which offers a great view of Berlin. Visitors may book free tours of the building and enter with confirmed reservations at scheduled times through the north portal. Due to continued terrorist threats, individual visitors need to register in advance to visit the glass dome and terrace. Book well in advance as individual entry is limited to a daily maximum. 
*Siegessäule (Victory Column), Tiergarten. An old (1865-1873), 60m high monument with panoramic views of the very center of the city. Unfortunately, there is no elevator, so be prepared for 285 steps. The statue of Victoria on the top is the place where the angels congregate in the famous film Der Himmel über Berlin by Wim Wenders. It has also become something of a symbol for the annual Love Parade techno music festival.

Museums

Berlin has a vast array of museums. Most museums charge admission for people 18 years of age or older. Discounts (usually 50%) are available for students and disabled people with identification. Children under 18 years free. A nice offer for museum addicts is the three-day pass Museum Pass which grants entrance to all the normal exhibitions of the approximately 55 state-run museums and public foundations. Most museums are closed on Mondays; notable exceptions include the Neues Museum and the Deutsches Historisches Museum, which are open daily. Museumsportal Berlin a collective web initiative, offers easy access to information on all museums, memorials, castles, and collections and on current and upcoming exhibitions.

A short list of important museums (for a more detailed list check the district articles) are:
*Berlin Wall Memorial(Gedenkstätte Berliner Mauer), Gesundbrunnen/Mitte, Visitor Center: Bernauer Straße 119, Documentation Center: Bernauer Str. 111, The central memorial site of the German division is located in the middle of the capital. Open-Air Exhibition and Memorial Grounds: All year round M - Su 8am - 10pm, Visitor Center and Documentation Center: Tu - Su 10:00am - 6:00pm. The outdoor grounds are open daily 08:00 – 22:00. Admission is free. Nordbahnhof S-Bahn station S1, S2, S25, Tram M10. Follow the signs in the stations - a wall is Mauer in German). Often missed by tourists but an absolute must for anyone interested in this part of the city's history. It's a memorial to those who died crossing so you won't, fortunately, get the tackiness of the Checkpoint Charlie area; instead, you will be left with a haunting feeling of what life with the wall may have been really liked. The monument itself is a gigantic wasted opportunity, blank and featureless. The inscription on the outside, declaring it a monument to the victims of the "communist reign of violence", has sparked emotional debates and angered many local residents. The documentation center across the street on Bernauer Straße is excellent although most of the documentation is in German. The viewing platform gives you a tiny hint of the true scale of the Wall and how terrifying the "no man's land" between the two sections of walls must have been. When the documentation center is closed, both walls can be visited. There is some space between the concrete plates which allows you to look at the area between the walls. There are also several small holes.
*Berlinische Galerie, Kreuzberg, Alte Jakobstraße 124-128, is the city museum for modern art, architecture, and design. The museum is just around the corner from the Jewish Museum.
*DDR Museum, Karl-Liebknecht-Straße 1, A small museum just over the river from the Berliner Dom. It can be extremely crowded and it's a small place. All the displays are in German and English, giving a good insight into life in the former GDR.
*Deutsches Historisches Museum in the Zeughaus, Mitte, Unter den Linden 2, German historical museum covering everything from prehistory right up to the present day. One can spend many, many hours here!
*Deutsches Spionagemuseum, Mitte, Leipziger Platz 9, The German Spy Museum gives a unique insight into the world of espionage from ancient times to the present. Lots of intriguing objects and interactive installations. Open every day from 10:00 to 20:00.
*Hamburger Bahnhof Museum für Gegenwart, Moabit, Invalidenstraße 50-51, Museum for Contemporary Art located in former train station. Big halls filled with artworks made since the 1960s.
*Jüdisches Museum, Kreuzberg, Lindenstraße 9-14, Jewish Museum. Learn about the history of Jews in Germany. Permanent exhibition on two millennia of German-Jewish history, changing exhibitions, and impressive modern architecture by Daniel Libeskind. Also, there is a small unrelated Jewish Museum at the Oranienburger Straße Synagogue. 
* located close to Potsdamer Platz is another cluster of cultural buildings, museums among them. Some of them are Gemäldegalerie - thousands of European paintings from the 13th to the 18th century, works from Dürer, Raffael, Tizian, Caravaggio, Rembrandt and Rubens; Neue Nationalgalerie designed by Mies van der Rohe, with art from the 20th century (there are also temporary exhibitions during which the permanent collection is usually not on display) and Musikinstrumenten-Museum a part of the Staatliches Institut für Musikforschung PK that has an amazingly wide range of historic and unusual instruments on display.
*Mauermuseum at Checkpoint Charlie This museum is situated at the most famous historical checkpoint between the two Berlins. Admission.
* – Schloss Charlottenburg (Charlottenburg Palace, Belvedere with Porcelain Manufactory (KPM), Mausoleum, New Pavilion) Museum Berggruen (temporarily closed), Bröhan Museum Museum Scharf-Gerstenberg
*Museen Dahlem – in the district of Dahlem three museums are located: Museum of European Cultures - the biggest of its sort in Europe. Ethnologisches Museum - again one of the world's most comprehensive museums (Well worth a visit for its splendid collection of Pre-Columbian archeology!). Museum of Asian Art 
*Museum für Naturkunde, Mitte, Invalidenstraße 43, Near the main railway station. Natural science museum with a big collection of dinosaur skeletons, fossils, and minerals. 
* Literally "Museum Island", this area is best known for the vast Pergamon-Museum which houses an extensive collection of ancient Greek, ancient Middle-Eastern and Islamic art and architecture. Photography is allowed but is careful of what you lean or rest on, the staff is fussy! Other museums which belong to Museum Island are the Altes Museum (with the Egyptian and the antique collection), the Alte Nationalgalerie (with mainly German paintings of the 19th century) and the reopened Bode-Museum with its fantastically presented sculpture collection and Byzantine art. The Neues Museum houses the Egyptian collection, Neanderthal and other prehistoric archaeological finds, and some of the treasures unearthed at Troy. This is the only museum on Museums Insel that requires a timed entry ticket. It's best to get a timed ticket online ahead of time as time slots fill up quickly.
*Stasi Museum At the northeast corner of Frankfurter Allee and Ruschestraße is a complex of buildings housing hospitals and clinics. In the communist era, all these buildings belonged to the Stasi with their massive apparatus for spying on East German citizens, including opening tens of thousands of pieces of mail every day. Now just one of these buildings is used as a museum of the Stasi. It is almost impossible to find the street address since the number is out of sequence with the rest of the street. Walk up Ruschestraße from Frankfurther Allee. On the right side of the street, there is a small sign for the Stasi Museum at the entrance to the clinic complex. Walk in and go straight ahead to the far end of the car park.
*Story of Berlin Kurfürstendamm 207-208i, close to the Uhlandstraße metro, the last stop on the U1. Museum in the center of a mall. In addition to the history (including the World Wars), culture, transportation, architecture, and an exhibit of life in the city since medieval times, it is unique to feature an authentic cold-war era bunker. The 20-minute tour is included in the cost of the entrance ticket, and is at the top of each hour, alternating in German and English.
*Technikmuseum Few branches, most interesting at Trebbiner Straße 9 (Kreuzberg), about midway between Gleisdreieck and Möckernbrücke U-Bahn stations. Steam trains & engines, aircraft & flight, ships & sailing, and much more.
*Topography of Terror, Niederkirchnerstraße 8, This open-air museum documents the terror applied by the Nazi regime. It consists of excavated prison cells located directly under a remaining stretch of the Berlin Wall. The border between Berlin-Mitte (formerly East Berlin) and Kreuzberg (formerly West Berlin) runs for some 200 meters along Niederkirchnerstraße. Behind what remains of the Wall here is home to the permanent exhibition Topography of Terror on the site of the most important institutions of the Nazi persecution and terror apparatus between 1933 and 1945. This is the only free museum in Berlin to encourage visitors and it is well worth going to. It’s as it says, topography or the terror from the Gestapo and SS leading up to the war and during.

There are about a hundred cinemas in Berlin, although most of them are only showing movies dubbed in German, without subtitles. CineStar (listed below) shows movies in their original English version, without any subtitles, so it's a perfect place to catch up on any movie you would've gone to back home.

* Technical university founded in West Berlin after World War II with a good reputation for its research.

There are several smaller universities and colleges in Berlin but the current restructuring of the university makes it difficult to give an overview. The responsible senator of the City of Berlin has a good overview page. 

Learn Languages
Berlin has also a myriad of language schools, ranging from government-supported integration courses to private language schools, there is always a way to learn languages in such a multicultural city like Berlin.

Work
The current economic climate is stable but finding work in Berlin is not easy. A sound level of German improves your chance as only a few multinational companies are present in Berlin. Any kind of skills (especially language) that separates you from the masses will definitely improve your chances for a job. 

If you have an academic background then teaching English (Spanish, French & Latin are good, too) or private tutoring (e.g. math) for pupils is always a possibility as Berlin is a young city and education is in strong demand. Otherwise working in a bar might be an option but it'll be tough because wages are low and big tips are uncommon. Chances are much better when big trade fairs (e.g. "Grüne Woche", bread & butter or ITB) or conventions take place so apply at temp & trade fair agencies. The hospitality industry and call centers are constantly hiring but wages are very low unless you can offer special skills (such as exotic languages) or background.

There is a flourishing scene of IT startups in the city; if you are in a profession related to software and IT chances of finding a job are good. 

Berlin has a growing media, modeling, and TV/movie industry. For daily soaps, telenovelas, and movies most companies look for people with something specific. Apply to the bigger casting and acting agencies.
* Due to the refugee crisis, Berlin is, just like the entire of Germany, currently hosting many refugees and refugee shelters are always looking for volunteers. As of February 2015, Berlin is hosting over 80,000 refugees. Volunteering is also a great way to interact and work with locals. The shifts are flexible and there are plenty of different things you can do. It is the best way to register for shifts at refugee shelters in Berlin. The website was created especially for refugee shelters in Berlin. The website is also offered in English. They have been expanding to other cities, so make sure you check the filter "Berlin" at the top of the page. Each place includes directions and mostly a way to contact them. Please read the descriptions to make sure you can volunteer. A few places require something that's called "Führungszeugnis".

Buy

Currency
Generally, the currency is the Euro. Some large department stores may take foreign currencies at their information desks, but do not count on that, and accept exchange rates that are not to your advantage. Shops usually do not accept traveler cheques, but do accept debit cards (domestic girocard as well as international Maestro and V Pay), and increasingly also credit cards (Visa and MasterCard most widely accepted). Banks are generally open M-F from 9 AM to 4 PM. Many banks have ceased changing foreign currencies (cash and traveler cheques), but bureau de change services are offered by ReiseBank (branches at many major rail stations such as Hauptbahnhof, Zoologischer Garten, and Spandau).

Cash machines are widespread, also in shopping malls and even sometimes in large department stores or supermarkets. With a domestic German debit card, using cash machines of major banks - at regular bank branches - often results in lower fees than using machines of rather exotic banks, which might install their machines next to small stores. Watch the fee notices on display, and, if the fee on display appears to be odd, rather cancel the transaction, and ask locals to indicate the way to the next branch of a regular bank, which is never more than a five minutes walk away, as fees there will be considerably lower. With an international debit or credit card, almost any cash machine in Berlin will offer you unilaterally free cash withdrawals, as the only fees that apply will be set by your own bank.

Credit Cards
Credit cards are rarely accepted as Germans still largely prefer cash, as well as the standardized German debit cards, which used to be branded "EC" and now "girocard", and which are mostly co-branded with "Maestro" or "VPay". In some places in tourist zones, almost all department or larger stores, and a few supermarkets or major chains will accept credit cards, but you should prepare to bring cash. Many restaurants require a minimum check amount, sometimes in excess of €30. Increasingly, restaurants, also in the higher medium segment, have ceased to accept any other payment method than cash as merchant fees for card payments were traditionally very high in Germany, and the informal sector is still going strong in Germany.

For Americans, Germany uses the EMV (chip-and-pin) system so you may have trouble at places like unattended gas stations and automated ticket machines. Canadians won't have a problem with this as they have chips in their cards. Often, a cashier will be able to swipe the magnetic strip, but don't be surprised if someone refuses your credit card because it doesn't have a chip.

If credit cards are accepted, it is usually limited to Visa and MasterCard, you will often run into issues when trying to use American Express. Acceptance of Discover, Diners, JCB, and UnionPay is generally weak.

Visa Debit and Debit MasterCard cards are processed as credit cards by German card payment acquirers. If a merchant only accepts "debit cards" or "EC cards", acceptance will usually be limited to domestic girocard, and international Maestro, V Pay or Visa Electron cards may or may not work.

Most credit card slips which are produced by German card terminals do not contain any extra space for adding a tip in handwriting. No restaurant which accepts credit cards will raise objections when you tip their staff by increasing the amount to be deducted from the credit card. If you want to tip this way, be prepared to announce the total amount you want to pay in total, including the tip, before staff type the amount into the machine.

Shopping

There are no legal restrictions on shopping hours Mondays through Saturdays. However, closing times depend on the area, the standard seems to be 8PM, though it can be earlier in remote areas. Most of the bigger stores and nearly all of the malls are open additionally until 9 or 10PM on certain days of the week, often between Thursday and Saturday. 

Sunday opening is by law limited to about a dozen weekends per year, often in combination with large events, watch for announcements in the shops and local media. Some supermarkets located at train stations (Hauptbahnhof, Bahnhof Zoologischer Garten, Friedrichstraße, Innsbrucker Platz, and Ostbahnhof) are open late and also on Sundays. Many bakeries and small food stores (called Spätkauf) are open late at night and on Sundays in busier neighborhoods (especially Prenzlauer Berg, Kreuzberg, and Friedrichshain). Also, Turkish bakeries open on Sundays.

The main shopping areas are:

Ku'Damm and its extension, Tauentzienstraße remain the main shopping streets with flagship stores of many international brands. KaDeWe (Kaufhaus Des Westens) at Wittenbergplatz is a tourist destination in its own right, not least for the vast food department on the 6th floor. It's reputedly the biggest department store in Continental Europe and still has an old world charm, with very helpful and friendly staff.

Friedrichstraße is the upmarket shopping street in former East Berlin with Galeries Lafayette and the other Quartiers (204 to 207) as the main areas to impress wealthy shoppers. Galeria Kaufhof department store at Alexanderplatz is also worth a visit. Other shopping streets in suburbs include Schloss-strasse (Steglitz), Wilmersdorfer Strasse (Charlottenburg), Schönhauser Allee (Prenzlauer Berg), Carl-Schurz-Strasse (Spandau) and Karl-Marx-Strasse (Neukölln).
Large Shopping Malls with well over 100 shops and food courts are for example the Alexa (Alexanderplatz/Mitte), The Playce (Potsdamer Platz/Mitte), Mall of Berlin (Leipziger Platz/Mitte) Gesundbrunnen-Center (Gesundbrunnen Station/Wedding) Gropius-Passagen (Britz) Linden-Center (Hohenschönhausen) Spandau-Arkaden (Spandau) Forum Steglitz (Schloss-strasse/Steglitz) Ring Center (Friedrichshain)
 
The main upmarket shopping area for the alternative, but still better-off crowd is north of Hackescher Markt, especially around the Hackesche Höfe. For some more affordable but still very fashionable shopping, there is Prenzlauer Berg, Kreuzberg, and Friedrichshain with a lot of young designers opening shops, but also lots of record stores and design shops. Constant change makes it hard to recommend a place, but the area around station Eberswalder Straße, Kastanienallee in Prenzlauer Berg and Torstrasse in Mitte, around Bergmannstraße and Oranienstraße in Kreuzberg, around Boxhagener Platz in Friedrichshain and Eisenacher Strasse in Schöneberg is always great when it comes to shopping.
For souvenirs, have a look just in front of the Kaiser Wilhelm Gedächtniskirche; these shops sell almost the same items as others but are cheaper, and not all the staff speaks English. You can also get cheap postcards there. For collectible stamps go to Goethe Straße 2 (Ernst Reuter Platz, U2), where you can find a Philatelic Post Office from the Deutsche Post. They generally speak English. For alternative souvenirs (design, fashion, and small stuff from Berlin designers and artists), go to ausberlin near Alexanderplatz; it's a bit hidden on the other side of Kaufhof at the Karl-Liebknecht-Straße.

Flea markets
You can find dozens of flea markets with different themes in Berlin (mostly on weekends):

Eat

A staple in Berlin is currywurst. It's a sliced bratwurst covered in ketchup and curry powder. You can find them all over Berlin from street vendors. It's a must-try when you are in Berlin and for those who don't eat meat or prefer a less fatty meal, it also comes in animal-free versions. Three renowned Currywurst stands are "Konnopke's Imbiss" below Eberswalder Strasse U-Bahn station on line 2, "Curry 36" opposite the Mehringdamm U-Bahn station in Kreuzberg (only two stops south of Checkpoint Charlie) and Yoyo Foodworld (close to U-Bahn station Frankfurter Tor, U5) where you can get a vegan Wurst. All of these offer far friendlier service than many of Berlin's more upmarket eateries.

Another famous thing to eat in Berlin is Döner. This is a flatbread, filled with Lamb or chicken meat or seitan, salad, and vegetables, and you can get it at many Turkish stands. The most famous vegan Döner is called Vöner and is served in the eatery carrying the same name close to S-Bahn station Ostkreuz. Other immigrated popular foods include Falafel and Maqali (fried vegetables) sandwiches.

In September 2015 Berlin was named the vegetarian capital of the world by the culinary magazine Saveur. Considering all the vegetarian options in regular restaurants and especially the amount of exclusively vegetarian and even vegan restaurants and coffee shops this title seems well-deserved and it reflects the recent vegan trend in all of Germany which does away with the cliché of the meat-heavy German cuisine.

Eating out in Berlin is incredibly inexpensive compared to any other Western European capital or other German cities. The city is multicultural and many cultures' cuisine is represented here somewhere, although it is often modified to suit German tastes.

All prices must include VAT by law. Only upmarket restaurants may ask for a further service surcharge. Note that it is best to ask if credit cards are accepted before you sit down – it's not that common to accept credit cards and cash is usually preferred. Most likely to be accepted are Visa and Mastercard; all other cards will only be accepted in some upmarket restaurants.

One of the main tourist areas for eating out is Hackescher Markt/Oranienburger Straße. This area has dramatically changed during the years: once full of squats and not-entirely-legal bars and restaurants, it had some real character. It is rapidly being developed and corporatized, and the artists of the most famous squat - the former Jewish-owned proto-shopping mall "Tacheles" - were evicted and the area has had a bit of a facelift. There are still some gems in the side streets. 

For cheap and good food (especially from Turkey and South Europe) you should try and with their abundance of Indian, pizza and Döner Kebab restaurants. If you are looking for a quick meal you could try getting off at Görlitzer Bahnhof or Schlesisches Tor on the U1 line - the area is filled with inexpensive, quality restaurants.

Kastanienallee is a good choice too - but again not what it used to be since the developers moved in (much less exploited than Hackescher Markt, though). It's a popular area with artists and students and has a certain Bohemian charm. Try Imbiss W, at the corner of Zionskirchstraße and Kastanienallee, where they serve superb Indian fusion food, mostly vegetarian. Further up the street are the Prater Garten, Berlin's oldest beer garden and an excellent place in the summer.

 Waiters and tipping 
There is no culture of tipping in Germany, similar to most of Europe. The custom in Germany is to tell the waiter how much you’re paying (including the tip) when you receive the bill — usually rounding off the bill (like Euro 40 for a 38 bill). If there is confusion with the tip, remember to ask for your change, Wechselgeld (money back).

If you pay by credit card, tell the waiter the amount you want to pay in total, including the tip, before the amount is typed into the machine, as payment slips produced by German machines usually do not provide extra space for adding a tip in handwriting.
 
Round up to the next Euro to the bill in a bar. In a restaurant, you may tip a little more if you are satisfied with the service (5-10%). However, tips grossly exceeding 10% of the bill are rather unusual, as waiters in Germany are paid living wages and do not predominantly receive their income from tips.

Sometimes, staff at fast food places set up donation boxes for charities, which is a decent hint that they do not want to get tipped personally, but rather prefer you to donate.

Breakfast
It is very common to go out for breakfast or brunch (long breakfast and lunch, all-you-can-eat buffet, usually from 10AM to 4PM, sometimes including coffee, tea or juice). 
* Buffet breakfast and institution for parents and prepared for children of all ages, indoor play room!
* Excellent Russian breakfast buffet.
* Classical style, waiters in livreé.
* Breakfast from 9-10:30AM at the top of Germany's parliament.
* Playground next to the restaurant and good breakfast.
 
Drink
*At Warschauer Straße (which you can reach via S-Bahn and U-Bahn station Warschauer Straße) and more specifically Simon-Dach-Straße and around Boxhagener Platz, you can find a wide variety of bars. It is common for locals to meet at Warschauer to go to a bar there. Also, Ostkreuz (Eastcross) and Frankfurter Street have very famous meeting points. Especially to visit the alternative ("underground-/left-szene") locations in house projects (so-called squats), or famous alternative clubs on Revaler street. 
*If you want to get some tap water in a bar ask for Leitungswasser (if you just say "water" (Wasser), you will receive mineral water.) This is common if you drink coffee. They should not charge you for it but you should order another drink as well.
* 
* 
* brew and sell their own beer on the premises. There is usually a public viewing area of the brewery.

Bars
There are lots of Irish bars all over the city, as there are in all European cities. If you like off-the-shelf Irish bars or watching football in English then you won't be disappointed, but in a city with new cool bars opening pretty much daily and a huge range from which to choose, you'll find that these cater mostly to the Irish construction workers and Germans attracted by Irish music, which is often played in them. The Irish pub in the Europa Center at Tauentzienstraße is famous. Located in the basement of a skyscraper, you will find a big Irish pub and a rowdy crowd on the weekend. It also claims to have the longest bar in all of Berlin!

Berliners love to drink cocktails, and it's a main socializing point for young people. Many people like to meet their friends in a cocktail bar before clubbing. Prenzlauer Berg (Around U-Bahnhof Eberswalder St, Helmholtzplatz, Oderberger Straße & Kastanienallee), Kreuzberg (Bergmannstraße, Oranienstraße and the area around Görlitzer Park and U-Bahnhof Schlesisches Tor), Schöneberg (Goltzstraße, Nollendorfplatz, Motzstraße for gays), and Friedrichshain (Simon-Dach-Straße and around Boxhagener Platz) are the main areas. There aren't as many illegal bars as there were in the '90s but bars open and close faster than you can keep up - check out the bar and cocktail guides in the bi-weekly magazines Tip or Zitty. For recommended bars, have a look at the district pages.

Clubs
For clubs, have a look at the pages.

The club scene in Berlin is one of the biggest and most progressive in Europe. Even though there are some 200 clubs in the city, it's sometimes difficult to find the right club for you since the best ones are a bit off the beaten track and most bouncers will keep bigger tourist groups (especially males) out. The entrance is cheap compared to other big European cities.

The main clubbing districts are in the east: Mitte (especially north of Hackescher Markt and - a bit hidden - around Alexanderplatz), Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg (around Schlesisches Tor) and Prenzlauer Berg (around station Eberswalder Str.). Some mainstream clubs are located in Charlottenburg and at Potsdamer Platz. Electro and techno are still the biggest in Berlin, with lots of progressive DJs and live acts around. But there are also many clubs playing '60s beat, alternative rock, and of course mainstream music. Clubbing days are Thursday, Friday, and especially Saturday, but some clubs are open every day of the week. Partying in Berlin starts around midnight (weekends) and peaks around 2AM or 3AM in the normal clubs, a bit later in many electro/techno clubs. Berlin is famous for its long and decadent after-hours, going on until Monday evening.

Sleep
After the end of the Cold War, Berlin witnessed a construction boom of hotels and offices. The boom led to a significant oversupply of hotels which resulted in comparatively cheap prices. Especially for a short visit, it may be best to stay at a place in Berlin-Mitte (around Friedrichstraße example), as most of the main sights are located there. Due to its history, most hotels in Berlin are still located in the City West (i.e. Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf), especially close to Zoo station. Alexanderplatz and Anhalter Bahnhof have clusters of budget hotels (i.e. Ibis, Etap). All major hotel chains are present in Berlin. A good idea to check that the hotel is close to public transport (U-Bahn or S-Bahn) to avoid too long walks. 

The cheapest are youth hostels (called Jugendherbergen, only for members) and hostels (similar to youth hostels, but for everyone, mostly backpackers stay here, usually in one to 32-bed rooms). You will also find bed and breakfast offers (often private) and boarding houses (Pension, more familiar and smaller than hotels). Be aware that the majority of private flats on platforms like Airbnb are offered illegally in Berlin and contribute to the ongoing housing crisis. Try to choose your accommodation responsibly!

Contact
You can find internet cafes and telephone shops all around Berlin. Do a bit of research with the telephone shops because most have a focus region in the world. Many bars, restaurants, and cafes offer free wi-fi for their guests. 

The mobile network (3G/GPRS/GSM) covers the whole city. If you are coming from a non-GSM standard country (e.g. the United States) check your mobile phone for GSM compatibility. Note: The GSM iPhone, which works with AT&T and T-Mobile in the U.S., works perfectly in Berlin.

Stay safe
Berlin is a safe place but it has some not-so-well-maintained areas, too. Most tourists would not encounter any criminal activity in Berlin once they use the same precautions that they would use in a similar city in their home country, as well. Berlin is generally safe to walk at night and at the daytime. Private transportation or the use of taxis is not required for safety reasons. Fraudulent taxi scams do not exist.

In public transportation and tourist areas, pickpockets are a problem. Watch your bags during rush hours and at larger train stations. Pickpockets are not just a problem for tourists, but also Berliners suffer from their tricks, which are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Please consider that they are not only present on public roads or in public transportation, but also in clubs or pubs.

The police in Berlin are competent and not corrupt. Attempting to bribe officers will likely result in at least a night behind bars to have your background checked. The police are generally helpful to tourists. Most of the officers are able to speak English, so do not hesitate to approach them if you are frightened or lost. The nationwide emergency number is 112 for medical emergencies and fires, while the police emergency number is 110. Berlin Police are ready to sincerely investigate petty crimes and have formed special units to investigate them and are present in plain clothes at tourist hot spots and, with the consent of the owners, also in some clubs. Thus, calling the police emergency number once you fell victim or witness a petty crime as soon as possible might help police to track down perpetrators, or to identify some stolen goods belonging to you.

In public places which are frequently occupied by tourists, shell-game players (German: Hütchenspieler) try to involve visitors in a pseudo-game where a considerable bid has to be paid by the victim before a professional player places a nut or small ball below three small shells, rapidly moves the shells and asks the victim to determine under which shell the nut or ball item is now placed. Expect those pseudo-games to be fraudulent. Persons who appear to win the game before you bet are mostly part of the gang, even if they appear to be "original Germans" from their looks. Under German and Berlin laws, conducting those games is illegal. Never participate, as you are guaranteed to lose your money. If you want to support police efforts, keep some distance (as those groups use watchmen around the scene), and inform the police on 110.

Since the 1980s, there have been localized riots on Labor Day (May 1st). In general, these take place in Kreuzberg around Oranienstraße/Mariannenplatz. Nowadays they usually begin the night before 1 May, especially in the Mauerpark (Prenzlauer Berg), at Boxhagener Platz, and in Rigaer Str. (Friedrichshain), only to flame up again in the evening of May 1st in Kreuzberg and the areas mentioned previously. The violent riots have become rather subdued since 2005 due to well-coordinated police efforts and the simultaneous presence of thousands of peaceful citizens celebrating "Mayfest", a colorful street festival in Kreuzberg. For the faint-hearted, it is still advisable to stay out of these areas from 8PM until sunrise. Vehicles should not be parked in these areas during Labor Day as damages are nearly guaranteed.

Racial violence has now become very rare, but the risk might be higher on the outskirts of East Berlin. 

In the bordering neighborhood of the districts Neukölln and Kreuzberg (between Hermannplatz, Schönleinstrasse to Kottbusser Tor) and Wedding (Moabit and Gesundbrunnen) the risk of falling victim to robberies and assaults is slightly higher. Tourists should visit these areas with some caution during the night as a mixture of intoxicated party-goers and low-income neighborhoods might lead to trouble. Some care should be taken as well in the larger Alexanderplatz area.

In Berlin, some organized groups try to receive tips from car drivers stopping at red lights. They try to wash the car windscreen, or they show some more or less artistic exercises, just in order to collect money from drivers. Some of them get aggressive if payment is refused. Those groups do not reflect any traditional local culture, and they are considered a nuisance by many inhabitants, as well as by Berlin state authorities, and many Berliners would be grateful for not supporting them. (Similarly, groups of "musicians" playing records with a portable CD player have been observed roaming underground trains in central Berlin trying to collect tips).

Get out
*
* is the capital of the surrounding federal state of Brandenburg, not far southwest of Berlin, and makes a perfect day trip. Especially the park of Sanssouci, a world heritage site with its great famous palaces, is worth a visit. You can get there with the S-Bahn S7 or Regional-Bahn RE1 to the station Potsdam Hauptbahnhof or Park Sanssouci (fare zone C). It takes about half an hour from Berlin Hauptbahnhof or Friedrichstraße. Take Bus X15 from Potsdam Hauptbahnhof to Sanssouci. The grounds of Sanssouci are huge (over 200 hectares, 500 acres). It takes all day if you visit all the buildings.
* is in outer Oranienburg, a quiet suburb housing the remains of one of the Nazi concentration camps on German soil. There's also a small palace in the center of Oranienburg.
