Bucharest (Romanian: București) is 's capital and largest city, as well as the most important industrial and commercial center of the country. With 2 million inhabitants in the city proper and more than 2.4 million in the urban area, Bucharest is one of the largest cities in Southeastern Europe, the largest city between Berlin and Istanbul. 

Bucharest is the 5th largest city in the European Union by population within city limits, after Berlin, Madrid, Rome, and Paris.

Understand

Bucharest is the primary entry point into . Bucharest is a booming city with many large infrastructure projects changing the old face of the city. Known in the past as "The Little Paris," Bucharest has changed a lot lately, and today it has become a very interesting mix of old and new that has little to do with its initial reputation. Finding a 300 year old church, a steel-and-glass office building and Communist-era apartment blocks next to one another is a common sight. Bucharest offers some excellent attractions, and has, in recent years, cultivated a sophisticated, trendy, and modern sensibility that many have come to expect from a capital. Bucharest has been undergoing major construction and modernization works in recent years, such as the Basarab Overpass and the National Arena. Bucharest has benefited from an economic boom along with the EU grants that have helped rebuild neglected parts of the city, such as the historic Lipscani area.

Language
The official language is , a Romance language which claims to be the closest currently-spoken relative to Ancient Latin; but which contains around 20% of loan words from Slavonic languages. Most younger educated people will speak English very well indeed; and the drawback of this will be that they will certainly NOT want you to try your Romanian, to the point of pointing your inefficiency out! Also, they will likely be proficient in one or more second Romance languages; most educated people born before about 1970 will speak French, Spanish or Italian reasonably well. The Roma people speak their native Romany, as well as Romanian, and sometimes English as well. Beyond that, as in any major city, there will be a smattering of other languages like Chinese, Arabic, Turkish, Hungarian. Contrary to popular belief, Russian is not spoken in Romania. Despite being part of the Eastern Bloc, use of Russian was and is frowned upon. The only exception to this are in the small Lipovan communities in Dobruja.

Climate
Bucharest, owing to its position in the Romanian Plain, has a humid continental climate with cold winters, hot summers and moderate rainfall (640 milimeters on average). Winters are damp, snowy and very cold (for the city's latitude). It actually gets colder in Bucharest than it does in , and which are all located at very high latitudes. Night temperatures in January are around -5°C (23°F) and day temperatures are usually between 2°C (35°F) and 5°C (42°F). However, it may feel much colder as the average humidity is 88%. There isn't much activity during those months as most locals choose to stay home to avoid the cold. When cold waves from Siberia hit southern Romania, the mercury can dip as low as -15°C (5°F) and in rare cases below -20°C (-6°F). The last case of this happening was in January 2017 when Bucharest recorded a low of -24°C (-12°F), 8 degrees sigh from the record low of -32°C (-26°F). Snow is also the main type of precipitation during these months of the year. The city has on average 31 days of snowy weather from November to April.

Spring comes late in Bucharest as March is still really cold and snowy. April has warmer days but there very large variations between day and night as the average high is 18°C (64°F) but the average low is 4°C (40°F). April also has 1 snowy day on average and temperatures do drop below zero 2-3 times in the month. May is considered to be the best time to visit (along with September) as it has pleasant weather with warm days and cool nights.

Summer lasts from June to August and it's characterised by hot days and cool nights. There are large variations in temperature between day and night. While during the day they can get above 30°C (86°F) in the afternoon, they drop down to 15°C (59°F) during the night. Hot waves coming from the south can push the mercury above 35°C (95°F) occasionally but the city feels much hotter due to the presence of concrete, trapping the heat. The record high is 42°C (108°F). During August many of the citizens leave the city to go on holiday. Some head to or while others choose closer destinations like the Black Sea coast in or Romania. Many also head to during the weekends.

The first weeks of September can still be hot (30°C+) but the latter part of the month is pleasant. When October rolls around, nights start to get chilly, around 5°C (42°F), and days are at around 18°C (64°F). November is when cold really begins to settle and it is also when the city gets its first coat of snow.

Time
Bucharest is in the Eastern European time zone (UTC+2, with a DST of UTC+3 from April to October).

Connections and airports
Bucharest has reasonable connections with most European capitals and with the largest cities in Romania, but it can be difficult to find a direct flight to Bucharest from outside of Europe or the Middle East. 
The city is also reached by a large number of low-costs flights, mainly from destinations in and as well as from some major cities in , , the , , , , , , etc.

All scheduled flights, including those operated by low cost airlines, land at Henri Coandă International Airport () located in , 18 km north of downtown. Henri Coanda airport is often referred to as Otopeni on airline bookings, because of its location . The airport, built in 1968, underwent a massive modernization effort since the late 90's and is set to be further enlarged. It is the main hub for the Romanian flag carrier Tarom All concessions inside the airport (shops, cafes, restaurants) are extremely expensive (everything is about twice more expensive than in the city). The one exception is a grocery store (Carrefour) with prices similar to the prices in the city. It is in the basement of the arrival area where the buses are located. Avoid exchanging money in the airport, exchange rates are 10-15% worse than what you would find in the city - you are advised to use an ATM in the lobby for immediate needs and exchange money downtown. 

The smaller Aurel Vlaicu International Airport () was used for commercial flights as early as the 1920s and became a low cost hub in its final years. From March 25th 2012 it is no longer used by passenger airlines. It's located inside the city, in , about 4-6 km to the city center and is set to become a sort of business airport.

Airport transfers
There are several options to get from Henri Coandă airport to Bucharest: 

*Bus
Express bus 783 goes from the airport to downtown Bucharest (Starting with December 2nd 2023, the 783 line was replaced with line 100, which is even faster, having less stops). It runs approximately every 20 minutes, daily, including weekends and holidays (every 40 minutes during the night). Timetable for departures from Henri Coandă Airport to the city center is available here: 

Expect the trip with bus 783 to be about 40 minutes long (from Piaţa Unirii to the airport) or even longer during rush hour traffic. At night the bus can be much quicker, making the journey is 20 to 30 minutes.Buses that operate the line are modern with stop announcement system which however might stuck in the middle of the route(April 2016).If however you want to avoid all the route until Uniri, simply disembark at Victory Square where you can take the metro(M1,M2).

Express bus 780 links the airport with the main train station, Bucuresti Nord (Gara de Nord). It runs approximately every 40 minutes, daily (including weekends and holidays) from 5.30AM to 11PM.

When taking the 780 bus from Gara de Nord train station to Otopeni airport, note carefully that Gara de Nord is not the end of the bus route, hence, the 780 buses that pass Gara de Nord actually run in two directions. Therefore, at Gara de Nord, to catch the 780 that takes you to Otopeni airport, you need to catch it from the 780 bus-stop that requires crossing a road, i.e. not the 780 bus stop that is directly outside the Nord station. Best to ask locals where the correct bus stop is. 

Lowest price option for any of these express buses is 8.60 lei (two rides uploaded on a Multiplu card)(August 2018). 
Cards can only be purchased from the booth in front of either the Arrivals(daily from 6:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.) or Departures terminals (respectively on the return trip from ticket booths in stations along their route), they can't be bought from the driver. A 'to and fro' ticket (without "Activ" card) from Airport to city center and back costs 8.6 Lei, which is also cheap. (NOTE: The normal transport passes do not work on these Express buses No. 780 & No. 783). As of April 2012, there is a ticket machine in front of the Arrivals terminal in service 24 hours a day. Remember to always validate your ticket on boarding the bus, these two bus lines are a prime target for ticket inspectors.One 'Activ Card' costs 3.70 Lei (about $1.25). To ride the bus you will also need to add value to your card (add 7 Lei for two trips from / to the airport or 3.50 Lei for one trip). For two persons who plan to use Trams and buses inside the city simply add 50 Lei when you buy the card and use it accordingly. After you validate in the touch screen of the bus simply press number 2 in the validating machine and revalidate for the second person(April 2016). The bus is far superior to the train in terms of both time and cost.

*Train
There is a direct train to Bucuresti Nord station. 

Tickets can be bought inside the train station (arrival Terminal) CFR ticket counter; price is 4 lei. The total duration of the trip from airport to the Gara de Nord is approximately 20 minutes. From Gara de Nord you can take public transport (metro and buses) or you can depart by train towards other cities in Romania. The service runs approximately once every 30 minutes. Timetable for Henri Coandă Express is available here: 

*Taxi
Update 8/28/2019: Continue to use caution with the taxis in the arrival hall. The ticketing system has been impacted by recent changes to which taxis are allowed at the airport, and as such, expect long queues. Often, the ticketing machines are unable to match with any available taxis. If matched with a taxi, do not hand over the receipt - this is your only document of the taxi and must be retained in the event of a dispute or other complication. Taxi drivers will attempt to keep the ticket. Also beware of any driver who forces you to put small carry-on sized luggage in the trunk/boot. Separating tourist from their luggage for no reason should always be a red flag. Uber may be unavailable FROM the airport, but is very easy and affordable TO the airport and around town. Highly recommend avoiding taxis whenever possible. 
In the past taking a taxi from Bucharest Henri Coanda airport was a hazardous experience, as indicated in the text below - there was a long running scam with tourists. However, please note that this has now been resolved through the introduction of the ticketing system where taxi customers should get a ticket from the booths as coming out of the arrivals hall. Once you have a ticket wait for the taxi with your number on the side to arrive outside and after that the fare should be as per the meter (usually 1.39 lei per kilometre, around 30 lei to the centre of Bucharest - very cheap indeed). The issues below are still concern outside hotels and main shopping areas and especially Gara de Nord railway station - but only usual caution is required at the airport now - i.e just ensure the driver has the meter on, and don't negotiate a fixed price. 

Be extremely careful when taking a taxi from the airport to the centre, and avoid it if possible. Even official taxi drivers will likely try and extort some extra money out of you if you don't speak the language and seem clueless enough. Taxi scams are one of the most common crimes in Bucharest, so think twice before delivering yourself to the mercy of an unknown driver. Common tricks are:
- You get offered a ride for 20 lei, cheaper than a normal taxi. Once driving, it's suddenly 20 lei per kilometer.
- You are driven to a remote forsaken place and have to pay up if you want to be driven to your destination.
- You are promised a ride for 50 lei, which sounds pretty normal, but then 'taxes' for another 50 lei are added, and if you want a receipt it's suddenly another 50 lei.
- The second before setting off, another man jumps in the car, and together with the driver, threatens you out of your money one way or another.
- With excuses like "it's after midnight" or "this is a private taxi" or "delivery to a hotel has a special price" a taxi driver may ask you for 50 lei for a route that normally costs under 10 lei.

Should you end up in a situation like this, where the car is driving and the doors are locked and your luggage is in the trunk, then the only way out is to buy your way out through bargaining and lots of yelling back and forth. When lucky you might be able to settle for 120 lei with the driver, but 200 lei or more is not unheard of, especially when you end up having to pay a 'personal escort' of multiple people. 

The safest way to get a low cost taxi - Dacia Logan(1.39 lei/km) or premium taxi - Mercedes-Benz (up to 3.49 lei/km) is to order one using the electronic touch-screen kiosks on the Arrivals level (after you claim your luggage and exit). This will provide you with a printed ticket (which you should be sure to keep) for a specific taxi which will arrive within minutes. Just wait outside for it , show the ticket and keep the ticket for complaining if you have "surprises". Never let the ticket to the driver. Check nonetheless the rate before getting in (it should be written on the taxi's doors) and also check that the meter is turned on. With a normal-rate taxi the ride to the city center should cost only €10 (30-50 LEI) and for premium taxis should not exceed €20 (80-90 LEI).

Most taxis take only cash. Ask before you get in if you want to pay by card or SMS. All genuine taxis are marked in a clear way with the word "TAXI" on top in a light-bar as well as a car number. They’re not all necessarily yellow but a lot of them are. The vast majority of taxi rides are safe, economical ways of getting around town when it’s either too far or else you’re tired or have been drinking. The drivers are professionals and get you where you want to go at a set rate and all goes well.

Bucharest taxi companies worth trying include Meridian (021 9444), Cristaxi (021 9466) and Cobalcescu (021 9451). While English may be spoken, do not rely on it. As such, it is worth downloading a taxi app before leaving home. There are two recommend: Star Taxi and Clever Taxi. Both apps offer cheap and reliable taxis from a wide range of Bucharest taxi companies.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES accept the offer of the people near arrivals terminal who ask you if you want a taxi or offer to carry your luggage.

The driver will pick you up in the International Arrivals Parking Area just across the street from the main terminal (where others are getting picked up curbside) on the upper level.

By bus
Buses are a good option to get to Bucharest if coming from , , and to some extent , given the low frequency and speeds of trains between these countries and Romania. 

If you're willing to make extremely long bus rides it's also possible to get to Bucharest from a large number of cities in Western and South-Western Europe; these lines are operated by Eurolines and their local affiliate Atlassib 

The city has several bus terminals: Băneasa (located in the northern part of town), Obor (east), Filaret (south), Rahova (south-west), Militari (west), Griviţa (north-west) as well as many other smaller stations.

*Buses and minibuses from (seven-eight buses every day, about 10 hours travel time, tickets around €15) arrive mostly at Filaret bus station (linked to downtown by tramway 7 and bus 232);
*Buses from (three-four buses per day, 12-14 hours travel time, tickets around €45) arrive at multiple stations along Viilor road (linked to downtown by tramway 32 from the northern end and tramway 7 from the southern end);
*The only daily bus from (7 hours travel time, €18) stops near Tineretului subway station (one station away from city center);
*Buses from (one or two buses daily only between late May-early September, 5-6 hours travel time, tickets around €30) usually stop in various squares in downtown;
*Buses from (several times per week, 16-20 hours travel time, tickets around €60) arrive at stations along Viilor road;
*Transfer buses for routes from Western Europe usually arrive at Rahova bus station (tramway 32 links it with the city center);

Bucharest also has bus connections to a vast number of cities in Romania. They're a convenient choice primarily when coming from places from which railways are under repair (like and the Black Sea resorts) or too indirect (like ).

Timetables for most domestic routes and several international ones are available on 

By train

Bucharest is linked through direct daily trains to most neighboring countries’ capitals ( , , , ), as well as to , , , , and of course to main cities in all of Romania’s 41 counties.

All international trains and most long distance internal trains arrive at Gara de Nord (Northern) station, located quite near of the city center, to which it is linked by subway and several buses, trolley, and tramway lines. Trains from Chişinău depart at 16:35 and arrive in Bucharest Gara de Nord at 06:00 the next day, costing 494 Moldovan leu for tickets purchased on the day itself, or 600 leu in advance.

Some trains to and from the use either Gara de Est-Obor (Eastern) station, or Băneasa station, as well as the main Gara de Nord station (most of the trains). Currently the route between Bucharest and , the main city in the Black Sea area, has been modernised and the trip duration was lowered to 2:30 hours on direct trains. Following further modernisation expected to finish in 2012 the duration is expected to get to 2:10-2:15 hours.

The other three smaller stations (Basarab, Progresul and Republica) are used exclusively for local and regional trains.

The timetables for domestic routes are available here: 

Do not use any exchange services around the train station: they offer about 30-50 percent below the actual exchange rate--use an ATM instead or walk a few blocks to get a much better rate, then take the subway system, which is reasonably priced (~1 euro for 2 uses, as of January 2013) and has clearly marked maps and schedules. 

Watch out for the shady private taxi services and avoid taking taxis near the stations as they are often rogue operators who may take advantage of less prudent tourists. You should know that near the stations all of them will try to cheat you and you will have to be both vigilant and lucky to avoid being ripped off. Always look to see if the cab driver starts the meter and alert him by saying "aparatul" (ah-pah-RA-tool) while pointing at the meter. There will be drivers offering rides - be extremely wary. It is recommended to ride only with drivers who use the meter and have the general tariff (currently 1,39 lei/km, January 2013). The tariff is written on the front doors of the car. Never accept bargains and other offers, they are usually more than double than the route is worth.

By car
The city’s entrances from the north (the E60 road coming from Braşov), west (the A1 highway from Piteşti), east (the A2 (Sun) highway from Constanţa), south (the E20 road from Giurgiu) and the avenues in the city center are very crowded, especially at rush hours. Inside the city there are few parking spaces and some of the secondary streets are in bad condition.

Get around
Bucharest has one of the most extensive systems of public transport in Europe, even though it can sometimes be confusing and crowded. 

Note that most of the neighborhoods and urban areas are known and called using the name of the nearest Metro station. The other well-known areas without Metro stations are Dorobanţi in the Northeast, Rahova and Ferentari in Southwest (best avoided) and Lipscani - the old city centre situated between Unirii and Universitate Square.

Metro (Subway)

The metro, which has four lines (M1, M2, M3, M4, M5) and covers the city quite extensively, is usually a cheap (6 lei for 2 trips, 25 lei for 10 trips and 80 lei for a monthly pass) and easy way to get around even though there are surprisingly few stops in the city center, since the system was originally built to transport workers and commuters from outlying neighborhoods through the city to peripheral industrial areas. If you're staying outside the city center, or even if you want to travel within it, the Metro can be a very fast and convenient way of traveling to your destination, avoiding the traffic jams and crowds that frequently characterize surface transport.

The network is arguably frequent and fairly comfortable, reliable and easy-to-use. Surprisingly for some, it is by far the safest way to travel through the city. Since 2002, Bucharest Metro has embarked on a comprehensive modernization plan, including the replacement of old train-sets with state-of-the-art Bombardier Transportation trains and the renovation of stations and tracks in collaboration with Alstom. 

Line M1 starts in the eastern part of the city and then goes through the downtown on a circular route, passing by the main train station Gara de Nord and meeting up with the M2 line (which runs north-south) at Piaţa Unirii and Piaţa Victoriei stations. Line M3 links the western and eastern parts of the city. The central section on the M3 between Eroilor - Nicolae Grigorescu is shared with M1 and trains from both lines run in tandem having the terminus displayed at the front of the cab. Line M4 is a short shuttle line starting from Gara de Nord 2 going to Parc Bazilescu in Bucureştii Noi neighborhood (as of 2011). Even though Gara de Nord and Gara de Nord 2 are in close proximity, transferring between the two is taxed as a separate trip. The only platform to platform link between M4 and M1 is at Basarab station. M4 line is planned to eventually link the city with its airports. The M5 line links the western hub Eroilor to the Drumul Taberei residential neighborhood, and will eventually link to the eastern neighborhood of Pantelimon.

Maps of the subway can be found on the Metrorex official site 

Buses, trams and trolleybuses

Bucharest has a very complex network of buses, trams, and trolleybuses which is, at first glance, fairly confusing to the tourists. This is not because of any inconsistencies within the network, but rather due to the intricate web of hundreds of bus, tram, and trolleybus routes found in the city. Once you know your way around the network, however, public surface transport can be a very good way of getting around since there is a bus, tram, or trolley bus stop virtually everywhere in this city. The vehicles are usually very frequent, although they can also get crowded at peak hours. 

All stations for public transport are signalized with a small white plate and red writing with the station's name and the number of all the other buses and trolleys that stop there. They include the night buses, which contain an "N" before their number.

Make sure you know the stop you're getting off at - even though in most trolleybuses and in some modern buses and trams, the following stops are announced automatically and displayed on a screen inside the vehicle. Note that the audio volume announcement in the older trolleybuses can be quite low, although the buses work fine. If you are uncertain if a stop is the one you want, you can always ask your fellow travelers.

The ticketing system uses contactless smart cards, called Activ cards Once bought (you will need some ID to do that) the cards can be loaded with various ticketing options, including some that allow usage on both the subway and surface networks. To validate the card after entering a vehicle (or subway station) hold it still in front of the validating device (an orange box with a small LCD screen) until you hear a short beep (The LCD will show "Calatorie Placuta" = Have a nice trip). If you hear a long beep followed by the message "Repetati validarea la acelasi validator" = "Repeat the validation on the same machine" or any other message, please validate the card again. It is very common in this system to give errors very often, so it is recommended to be sure that you have paid for your trip. If you want to be sure that you have paid, press button 1 and hold the card near the validator, it will mention the amount left and for how many passengers it was validated. To validate it for more than one passenger (this is available only for electronic wallets not for daily/weekly/monthly passes), you have to press the button no. 2 and hold the card near the validator. For any other additional traveler, you have to press 2 again and receive the message "Calatorie Placuta" for each passenger. The paper tickets valid for one ride on one route are not available anymore (they were removed starting in May 2011). Be warned that you cannot buy tickets/cards in the vehicles and if caught by an inspector (controlor) you could be fined 50 lei. Some buses still use the old system of paper tickets, essentially a strip of paper that needs to be validated inside the bus. Be sure to validate your ticket according to instructions displayed on ticket booths, enforcers will take advantage of even the slightest mistake made by visitors unfamiliar with the system as an opportunity to extort heavy bribes by raising the fine above 50 lei and threatening to report to the police. A ticket is valid only on the bus/tram/trolley where it was validated. If you change the bus/tram/trolley, you have to validate again the card. Also, the ticket is valid only for one trip with the transport vehicle from one end to the other. However, in Bucharest most of the buses and trolleys will have one end (usually downtown, where there is no space for creating proper "end of the line" stops) without any distinct stop, so you will not be aware that you have to validate again, being liable to receive a fine. 
For this reason, is better to buy a daily (8 RON = 1.8 Euro) or weekly pass (17 RON = 4 Euro) for your trips in Bucharest, because the pass will not require any validation. The prices are very small compared with the travel options available (buses, night buses, trams, and trolleys), so the pass will help you to have a trip without any headaches. 

Starting with July 2011, the night buses are also available. They will run between 23:00 to 01:00, every 30 minutes, 1:00 to 5:00, every 1 hour, and 5:00 to 6:00, every 30 minutes. 

Rent-a-car
Car rental in the Pache Protopopescu Street or Europcar are all at the city and airport. You can find all international car rental companies (Avis, Hertz, Europecar, Ascar, TOP Rent a Car, etc.) at the Otopeni Airport. You can find local car rental companies also ( Inchirieri Auto Otopeni )
Some even offer free delivery to the airport. The average price for a day rental is about €20 for the cheapest car.

By taxi
There are a lot of taxi companies in Bucharest and you'll easily find a cab here. But be aware! Don't take any independent cab drivers, but use only the services of big taxi companies. Cars from these companies have the rates displayed on the door. Each door used to contain an initial "sitting" fee (between 1.6 to 3 lei), a per km fee (1.4 to 3.6 lei) and per hour fee. However, taxis now display a single number which is both the initial "sitting fee" and the per km fee. The per hour fee is not listed, but should be around ten times the per km fee. Independent have significantly higher fees (up to ten times the average!) If a taxi does not display these prices on the door it is best not to take it and find another, as you'll probably be charged a rate five to ten times higher than usual. Also, it should be noted that some taxis now have a low "nighttime rate" listed in a large font with an expensive daytime rate listed in a small font. So, read carefully and remember that noapte means night. And you should insist the driver starts the meter, and pay the sum displayed on it. If you are traveling outside the city limits (say to or from the airport) prices per km and per hour are often doubled, or an extra 10-15 lei is added to the fare. Be wary of taking taxis from places where a lot of tourists pass through, especially from Gara de Nord. Many of these taxis may be operated by con men. Tourists being asked to pay large sums to recover their luggage from the trunk or even muggings after taxi rides are not unheard of. It is not necessary to take a taxi from the front of the queue in Romania, in fact it is usually safer to take the last taxi there. Always stick with the large safer companies, these include Speed Taxi, Meridian, Taxi 2000, National Taxi, Cobalcescu and Dartex. Avoid Cris Taxi, Leone, Titan, Street, Decebal and Aresenal, these are often criminals. Also be careful to read the side of the taxi closely, there is not a trend of less reputable companies copying the logo of trusted companies (for instance Street copies the logo of Speed).

Uber and Bolt are cheap, widespread and legal. They operate around the city, including to and from the airport.

Landmarks

 
*Parliament Palace - In the center of Bucharest, near Piaţa Unirii (Union Plazza), the tourist can see the largest parliament building in the world, formerly named "Casa Poporului" (People's House). The building, which was built in 1984 by Nicolae Ceauşescu, spans 12 stories, 3100 rooms and covers over 330,000 sq m. 1/9 of Bucharest was reconstructed to accommodate this magnificent massive building and its surroundings. There are 30-45 minute tours every half hour which lead through the building's vast collection of marble rooms and culminates in an impressive view from Nicolae Ceauşescu's balcony. The marble and all the original decorations are 100% from Romania. There are different Tours ranging in price from 35 RON (18 RON for students, proof required) up to 55 RON (taking photos is another 30 RON). You have to show your passport or national ID card to buy a ticket. The basic tour includes the halls and the balcony, worthwhile is the terrace addition (10 RON) for the wonderful view from the top of the building. The basement addition on the other hand is not worth the extra 10 RON. They only show two rooms containing airducts, no additional facts and it lasts only 5 minutes! The tourist entrance is on the north side of the building.

*Old center (Lipscani) - A part of the city's historical heart was not demolished by Nicolae Ceauşescu.

Among the city's most notable theaters are the National Theatre, Teatrul Bulandra (two stages in two different locations in Central Bucharest), and the Odeon, but there are a good half dozen others that range from good to excellent.

Eat

Prices usually go anywhere from €5-7 to €30-40 for high-end dining for a single person menu consisting of a meal (most places offer €5-7 Euros menus that include an Entree, Main Dish and Dessert or a Drink) and a soft drink.
The most popular fast-food is undoubtedly Shaorma, with hundreds of places selling it in almost every Square, Mall or street crossroads. Objectively, the most popular places with Romanians are Dristor Kebap, Calif or Dines. 

Cuisine-wise, you can find many places which offer Romanian or other cuisines, especially 
Turkish ( Divan, Saray, Sultan), Italian ( Trattoria Verdi, Trattoria Il Calcio)and French cuisines ( French Bakery, Bon), but also Chinese ( Peking Duck, 5 Elemente), Spanish ( Alioli), Indian ( Kumar's Agra Palace, Taj), Greek, Japanese ( Zen Sushi).

* One of the most famous places to eat in the old city centre, it is situated in a wonderful building, with an extraordinary architecture. Present in Bucharest from 1879. Known for their home-made beer. The food is amazing and the decor is a work of art. Make a reservation beforehand (specially during the rush hours). They have quite a good and cheap 3 course lunch menu (only during the lunch hours on weekdays). Particularly good value is a lunch deal for seniors - available on weekdays before 1pm. This includes a beer which is very welcome because though food prices are reasonable, drinks are expensive (eg glass of wine 5 euro; 400 ml fraught beer also 5 euro). 

* The Palace of the National Military Circle was built in 1911 using French neoclassical style. The restaurant and the terrace are open to the public for affordable prices. 

* Opened in 2005, it is a hangout of the city's newly wealthy. It comes complete with a German car ads at the entrance and an extensive wine list. Food (Italian inspired) and ambiance are at best good, but portions are small and prices are far above average for Bucharest. A 3-course meal for two with local wine will set you back over 400 Lei.

* A bistro with an urban cuisine using fresh ingredients, homemade drinks and dishes, Romanian craft products & epicurious recipes. Located in Bucharest's uptown.

* Beautiful historically themed restaurant, live traditional music, old Romanian specialties... but always check the bill thoroughly. Reservations are compulsory.

* 

*A club with a German concept – ”the culture house” – a place where all sort of cultural events (such as live music concerts, art exhibitions, film projections) take place. Kulturhaus is very cheap – no entry fee (except for music concerts) and low prices – it is the cheapest club in town – maybe this is why the place is crowded every Friday and Saturday night until 05:00.

* Like Gay clubs the world over, this place has become tremendously popular with a hetero set fed up with the meat market atmosphere at so many of the city’s other locations. That, together with superb music, makes this an essential stop for hedonists of all persuasions. Shake it. It can become quite crowded so watch yourself."

*Great atmosphere and drinks with beautiful Romanian girls.

*Night Club & Pool with unique daytime clubbing in Bucharest

Bucharest LGBT Scene
Bucharest is home to the leading gay community in Romania, the city being a lot more lenient towards LGBT couples than any other Romanian places. Romania is just starting to get accustomed to LGBT individuals, as being gay was criminalized during the Communist Era (1947-1989) and people still have a shallow and intolerant understanding of the matter. 
Usually the worst thing that can happen is to be frowned upon or at most being made fun of, but during the day it is extremely rare. It is advisable to keep interactions between gay couple at a minimum at night.
There is currently one gay club in Bucharest: the Q Club (ex Queens, located on Carol I boulevard, corner with Latin street). 

There are multiple gay-friendly cafes or bars, like the open-air Gradina Eden, the fashionable and eccentric Gaia Boutique Club, the traveler-popular Ceainaria Cinci or the hipser Acuarela.

Stay safe
Buses are safe, but use your common sense, and put your things in internal pockets, just to be 100% sure.

If you choose to take a regular taxi rather than using an app such as Uber or Bolt, be aware that some of these taxis may be operated by con men waiting for an unsuspecting victim. This is especially true for taxis around Gara de Nord where their associates actively try to lure you into such cars. If possible, avoid taking cabs from Gara de Nord unless you are familiar with the taxi operators there. One rule of thumb is to go with older taxi drivers, since they will be more cautious and only try to get a bit extra out of you if they scam you, unlike young drivers who will claim a trip costs 3-5 times as much as it should, may claim the meter does not work, and may try intimidation tactics to make you pay.

Prostitution is illegal as is soliciting. Be very mindful of this and do not accept any offers, especially from intermediaries that "know a place"(pimps,taxi drivers,etc.) because the girls are most often coerced and if you get caught you will be charged with a crime related to human trafficking which usually ends in a prison sentence. This also applies to the numerous erotic massage parlors that have opened in recent years.

Be very careful of unsolicited offers of help by passersby, even if they have good English. In particular if a stranger offers to accompany you to your hostel or hotel in a taxi to show you the way, decline immediately. They are often working in tandem with unlicensed taxi drivers who will attempt to scam you, drop you at incorrect (and remote) locations while demanding exorbitant payment, or who will simply steal your luggage. A common scam is for a stranger to tell you that a place is not safe, and to direct you to an official "government" or "student" taxi, that is driven by an accomplice. They will then drive you a remote location, and demand high sums of money, possibly threatening you with violence if you don't comply. 

Be also careful when boarding or leaving trains. Scamsters have been known to impersonate other passengers, and enter couchettes or sleeping booths on trains while the occupant politely waits outside, and then steal from luggage. When requesting assistance on boarding trains, deal only with the conductor and if anyone asks you for information, demand to see ID.

Although statistically, Bucharest is one of the safer capitals in Europe, violence is not an uncommon sight in certain areas, towards locals or towards foreign looking men (minorities, out of place individuals, etc.) Nightclubs and bars, where heavy drinking occurs regularly, are especially prone to this, particularly those playing ethnic music. However, just avoiding any conflict, particularly with people who have the air of "owning the place" or a mafioso look would reduce your chances to almost zero.

In the past, Bucharest had a stray dog problem. These days however, it is far more likely that you won't see any dogs whatsoever on a trip to the city. There are no longer roaming packs or problems with being bit. As you get into the countryside, particularly with cyclists, dogs may assert themselves to protect their territory. Simply getting off your bicycle and walking will cause the dogs to give up the "game". 

Like most other big cities, walking around at night isn't safe in some parts of the city like Pantelimon, Ferentari, Giulesti, and the Gara de Nord area. If you must travel into these neighbourhoods, it's safer to take a taxi.

In the event that you do get caught in a police raid, do not attempt to bribe your way out of it with so many of them around as you might get into serious trouble. Police are more inclined to take bribes from locals than from foreigners so do not contribute to this phenomenon that has been plaguing this country for so many years. Police corruption has been vigorously fought in the past years, and it is not as generalized as it used to be in the 1990s. It's always better to walk on boulevards and avoid alleys and backstreets. 

The crime rate is low, but a traveler must always be cautious. Violent attacks are very low, but if attacked just yell, "Ajutor!". It is very difficult for anyone to get away with violent crime because as everything is packed so closely together, any loud noise will attract attention. This is truly a city that doesn't sleep. You'll find people out and around at all hours in most parts of the city. Police men are pretty friendly and most of the younger ones speak English, so you can ask directions. In the event that you do need to report a crime to the police, do not hesitate and proceed to the nearest police station. They will often help you to the best of their ability.

One must be careful as a pedestrian. Drivers can be inconsiderate. Don't assume a car will stop for you at a red light or cross walk. However, unlike some European countries, drivers are supposed to stop for pedestrians at crosswalks. You do have the right of way as a pedestrian.

Stay healthy
Those with allergies may find Bucharest annoying in that it is both hot and very dusty in the summer, with temperatures easily exceeding 30 C in July and August, so bring whatever you might need to stay comfortable. Please note that during the summer, sun strokes and heat strokes can be very dangerous.

Pharmacies are usually open between 9 AM and 6 PM, but some will stay open through the night. In Romania, there are relatively few over-the-counter drugs available, but pharmacists are allowed to dispense limited quantities of some prescription drugs (such as pain relief medicine) for what they see as immediate needs. Bucharest has 6 designated emergency hospitals and a modern ambulance service, plus a large number of additional public and private hospitals, clinics, and dental practices.

Do your laundry
This can be a small issue for any traveler going to Bucharest. If you want to wash your clothes there are these "curatatories" that you'll find everywhere (dry cleaners) and a couple of laundromats. The cost to launder your clothes in one of these "curatatories" is pretty high (around 4 euros for a t-shirt), so the laundromat is the only solution (about 2 euros for a washing machine). There are three laundromats. Two are located in student campuses, one near Timpuri Noi, and one in the Crangasi area. The other one is located at Piata Unirii, behind the Horoscop Hotel and in front of the private clinic MedLife. One of the laundromats, WASHescu also has a convenient delivery service that operates in the evening and brings fresh laundry to your location anywhere in Bucharest:

* The laundromat is inside a student dorm but visible and easily accessible from the street. It has wifi, A/C and all staff is English speaking. Here you can get a complete service: wash, dry and iron. WASHescu is also the only laundromat that offers a delivery service from and to your home or hotel room starting from 5.5 euro/laundry bag. Access the WASHescu Delivery English website from the main link above.
