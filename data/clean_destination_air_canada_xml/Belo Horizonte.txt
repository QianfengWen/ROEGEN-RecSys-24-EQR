Belo Horizonte is 's sixth-largest city, the center of its third-largest urban area and the capital of the state of . With its orderly grid plan and tree-lined avenues, it's a pleasant metropolis. For travelers, it's a good stopping point on the way to the beautiful colonial towns such as and , with interesting natural tourist spots (waterfalls, camping, hills and trails) and cultural venues (museums, parks and threatres).

Understand
Belo Horizonte (or simply "BH" (bay-ah-GAH) to locals) is a little over a century old, founded in 1897. With a metropolitan population reaching more than 5 million (edging out Salvador), it was built as a planned city, with its layout inspired by Washington, D.C., to take the place of Ouro Preto as the State's capital. Its layout features square sections drawn out by broad avenues, intersected diagonally by smaller streets, mainly inside the Contorno Avenue blocks (the first plan of the city).

The city lies in the center of Minas Gerais state, and is intended to bring together the many parts of this very diverse state.

Get in
By bus
BH is a major national hub for bus travel. The bus terminal rodovi&aacute;ria is at downtown at the northern end of Av. Afonso Pena (avenue). 
Approximate travel times from other capitals:
* - 10 hours
* - 12 hours
* - 6 hours
* - 22 hours
* - 8 hours
* - 8 hours

By plane
BH is served by two airports:

Confins (Aeroporto Internacional Tancredo Neves - CNF)
Rodovia MG 010 S/N, 40 km - Confins/MG. Phone: (31) 3689-2700. Direct flights to the USA, the Caribbean, Europe and to most major cities in Brazil and South America. It's located about 40 km from downtown.
To get to the city center, there are two options:
*Taxi/Uber: R$ 80-140 to get downtown, pre-purchased from one of the kiosks in the departure hall or by using Uber/99/inDriver apps.
*Conexão Aeroporto to Rodoviária (Main bus terminal - Downtown): Ônibus Convencional (Basic bus, R$ 16,80), Ônibus Executivo (Mid-level bus, R$ 36,45). Mid-level buses also offer WiFi and air conditioning. Information booths are available right outside of the Airport waiting hall, and there are multiple stops where you can drop off (not only downtown). Link: Conexão Aeroporto

Pampulha (Aeroporto Carlos Drummond de Andrade - PLU).
This airport is used for some domestic flights, especially within the state of Minas Gerais. 9 km from downtown. More flight options are being offered through it, but you're most likely to use CNF.

Get around

On foot
If you plan to get around the city center on foot, you might want to take a map (or, preferably, get a SIM card with a local plan to check map apps), since the city grid is laid out with both ordinals and diagonal streets. It's very easy to take a wrong turn, many streets look similar and, for those unfamiliar with Brazilian coastal states (which are used for the streets' names, in order), the naming isn't going to be helpful. Also, the land where the city was built on is very hilly, so one should wear comfortable shoes to go up and down the streets. At night, don't stray from the main avenues and streets for safety, because the city can get pretty dark in certain places and can be dangerous, especially for small groups or lone travelers.

By bus
BH is well-served by buses. The SC (circular) buses circulate through around Downtown, on Contorno Avenue; others serve outlying neighborhoods.

The buses are color-coded:
* Blue buses go from one region of the city to another, passing through Downtown;
* Red buses go from one region of the city to Downtown, and then go back to the same region (often serving more distant neighborhoods);
* Yellow buses are called "circular" buses - they circulate within a same city region (Downtown, mainly Contorno Avenue);
* Orange buses go from one region of the city to another without passing through Downtown (there are very few lines like these);
* Green buses serve BHBUS bus terminals, passing through other terminals and Downtown, then back or connecting two different BHBUS terminals.
* MOVE buses are part of the BRT system and pass through bus corridors in certain areas. They are quicker and connect main regions of the city, but use the same bus passes and have stops in regular bus stations. You'll recognize them by their tag, "MOVE."

Sometimes, some companies use temporary replacements buses with a different color, so even thought the colors are helpful, always pay attention to the line number (shown in front, back, and sides of the bus). The fare is currently R$ 4.50, and you can also get the BHBUS card, which is helpful for connections (such as getting the subway right after a bus ride or two buses, by using one of the terminals).

The best way to plan your route is by using Google Maps which has great public transit coverage for Belo Horizonte.

If you are not in the Downtown area (inside Contorno Avenue), it is cheap, effective and quick to take a blue bus there. There is no complete bus map, but you can use the apps SIU Mobile BH and Moovit to check which lines are served by the nearest bus station and how often the buses arrive there. Nowadays, you can also use Google Maps to see the shortest public transport route you can take to get where you need to be. Check BHTrans-Ônibus for more information of buses. 

The buses are full during rush hours. Don't go anywhere by yourself without properly planning your itinerary first. If budget is not a concern, using Uber and 99 are the best choices to get to places quickly and with less of a hassle.

By subway
BH's subway has only one train line and is mostly used by commuters, with more residential areas being served. It might come in handy if you know people in the city, but it is not very useful for tourist areas. If you need to take it, the station Downtown is Central Station (Estação Central), where you can go all the way up to Contagem, one of the metro area cities.

The Metrô snakes through the city, from Eldorado northeast to Vilarinho, tangential to the north side of Downtown. Lagoinha Station is near the Rodoviária (main bus terminal), Gameleira Station is near the ExpoMinas Convention Center and Minas Shopping Station is near the Mall of the same name and Ouro Minas Palace Hotel. Unfortunately, the subway lines, although important to connect the two biggest cities in the metro area, Belo Horizonte and Contagem, do not cover most of the city and some stations might be unsafe.

By taxi
Belo Horizonte relies on a big and reliable taxi fleet - one of the best in Latin America. The service is also relatively inexpensive - a trip accross downtown costs around R$ 15 - ranking number 10 among the major Brazilian capitals.
 
The official color is white. Below is the fare table as of March 2021 

*Initial Fare: R$ 4.70 
*Km traveled (Bandeira 1): R$ 2.91
*Km traveled (Bandeira 2): R$ 3.53
*Idle time: R$ 26.23 per hour

Bandeira 2 applies between 10 P.M. and 6 A.M. Monday through Friday, and after 2 P.M. on holidays and weekends.
You may use this handy fare calculator: 

Coopertaxi is a popular taxi company: 0800-979-2424 / (31) 3421-2424 / (31) 2108-2424

By transportation apps
BH has an extensive fleet of Uber and 99 (Didi) drivers, which will often be cheaper and more comfortable than taxi drivers, so don't be afraid to use those apps while you are visiting. Lyft is not available. Another option is using inDriver, which has an auction-style fare system.

See

Note that a lot of places including museums, Parque Municipal (City Park) and Mangabeiras Park are closed on Mondays.

*Pampulha - This 1940's neighborhood has some of the highlights of Brazilian modern architecture, including the São Francisco de Assis Church. The building is not impressive by itself, until you realize it was meant to be a church. Not surprisingly, the Catholic Church refused to consecrate it for more than one decade. Next to the church, there's Parque Guanabara, an amusement park that is small, but worth visiting. Pampulha is also where you can find the world-famous Iate Tênis Clube, founded along with the Pampulha Architectural Complex designed by Oscar Niemeyer. Invitations to the club can be bought at the place (they are free if you know someone affiliated to the club).

*Mangabeiras Park - This is an amazing place for nature lovers, a place where the Cerrado mixes with the Atlantic forest. This is a great place to visit with children and family. 

Praça da Liberdade & Circuito Cultural - A beautiful palm tree-lined square, sidelined by interesting buildings from the 19th century, including the historic seat of the State Government and a curvaceous (yes, you can use this word to describe an Oscar Niemeyer building) edifice from the 60s. Nowadays, many of the historical buildings that once housed State Secretariats are now museums.

Drink
*BEWARE: Brazilian law has a ZERO tolerance for drinking and driving.
Recently, major cities such as BH started to heavily enforce these laws with daily random DUI checkpoints. The penalty is severe and the police does not need you to comply with the breath analyzer (they may arrest you on suspicion alone). If caught, you will probably be taken to jail and have to pay a fine of about R$2,000 and this is just the best case scenario 

*There are usually plenty of taxis in front of popular bars and nightclubs during all hours.

*The state of Minas Gerais is famous for their cachaça. The price stars from R$1,00 to R$50,00 and above, for some high-end brands. It is the main ingredient of the famous "Caipirinha" cocktail, but Brazilians enjoy drinking it pure as well. Whenever you are at a classic local bar, ask the bartender for some options.

Bars
People from BH are famous for their love of bars. The Savassi neighborhood has dozens of bars.

 Stay healthy 

To keep hydrated, drink bottled water or water from drinking fountains, usually located at malls.

Tap water provided by COPASA (sole provider for the city) is regarded as fully potable (filtered, sterilized, PH controlled and fluoridated), but it is important to note that due to historical unreliability of water supply in Brazil, the vast majority of buildings have water tanks, so even if it is provided by COPASA, if you are unsure of the sanitary conditions of the building water tank, you should avoid drinking it before filtering, boiling or ozonizing it.

Even though bottled water in Brazil is labeled as “mineral water”, you should be careful and use good sense when buying it. Cases of tap water and untreated water being bottled and labeled as “mineral” are not uncommon. Always check the color of the water, the general aspect of the bottle and the seal. Some Brazilians are used to untreated water but it is very likely that tourists will have serious issues with it, including diarrhea, vomits, fever, headaches and muscular pain. It is usually safer to drink COPASA tap water then bootleg bottled water.
Free healthcare is widely available, but waiting times may be long (even on minor emergencies), for non urgent cases go to the free “Posto de Saúde” near where you are staying (there are plenty all over the city). Private hospitals usually have faster service and better facilities and you can pay your treatment with either cash or with your insurance. Check with your insurance company the hospitals and clinics covered beforehand. If you have any allergies or known health problems, it is wise to learn some Portuguese words to describe it as it is very likely most of the hospital staff won’t speak English except for more qualified MDs, nurses and social workers. Although you might not see any initial difference, nurses are divided into “college nurses”, “technical nurses” and “auxiliary nurses”. You are more likely to find an English speaker amongst the college nurses (they are called Enfermeira or Enfermeiro and usually act as sector supervisors in a hospital).

Belo Horizonte can get very hot during summer, so avoid staying out in the sun for too long, specially between 10am and 3pm. Even though it is not on the coast, sunscreen is advisable, especially if you have light skin.

Public restrooms can be found at malls and public buildings. A small fee may apply. Also, bars and restaurants are required by law to have a restroom available to its customers, but even if you are not buying anything, just ask nicely and they will let you use it.

Smoking in Belo Horizonte is banned from closed buildings. This includes malls, restaurants, bars (except if you are sitting outside), clubs, public buildings, airports and others. Smoking has been increasingly regarded as a bad habit and even on the sidewalk people might get annoyed by it, so it is best to smoke privately or away from non smokers.

Stay safe
When crossing the street, watch for motorcycles, which can appear out of nowhere and sometimes ignore stop signs. At some intersections with divided streets, you can cross only one side at once.

Minas has both the military police (polícia militar) who are the enforcers of the law at street level, however not linked to the Brazilian Military and the civilian police (polícia civil) who conduct further investigations like the British CID. Note, though, that most officers don't even have a knowledge of basic English. The uniform of the Minas Gerais state military police is brown.

The emergency number (by which you can reach the military police) is 190.

The city has its own police, the Municipal Guard, the uniform is blue and officers are found in parks, near monuments, schools, hospitals.

The city has seen a recent surge on crime related to drugs. It is wise to avoid walking alone at night or carrying expensive electronics such as cameras, notebooks, iPods or jewelry. It is not uncommon to be mugged at traffic lights or walking during the day or night. Despite Brazil's huge ethnic diversity, tourists can be easily identified by bad guys as people who carry electronics carelessly and seem to be always wondering where are they going. Be discreet. 

If you want to stay in the city it's best to stay in the center; the suburbs of Belo Horizonte are dangerous. 

If someone mugs you, don't react. Your life is worth more than a hundred dollars.

Contact

By net
*MP Games, Rua dos Inconfidentes 868, between Pernambuco and Paraíba, Savassi. You can bring your laptop. 3 R$/h.

There are many LAN Houses and Cyber Cafés throughout the city, even inside Shopping Malls, so checking your e-mails or browsing the internet won't be a problem. Rates go from R$2 to R$5 per hour.

By phone
Brazilian phones are made up of the Country Code (+55), a 2 digit Area Code (a), followed by a 2 digit Service Provider Code (s) and finally the 8 or 9 digit Phone Number (p), formatted as +55 aass ppppp-pppp or +55 aass pppp-pppp. For national calls, +55 is replaced with a single 0, rendered as (0aass) pppp-pppp. Since you can pick any service provider to route your call, people usually also omit the Service Provider Code from the number, therefore (0aa) pppp-pppp would be the most commonly formatting seen in the city. It should be noted that Service Providers may charge extra fees for calling phones served by other providers.

For local calls, it is possible to remove the Area and Service provider codes and call the number directly. It should be noted that sometimes cities sharing the same area code will still be considered long-distance calls and force you to type out the full number instead of just the phone number. E.g. A call from Belo Horizonte to Ouro Preto requires you to dial 031ss pppp-pppp.

Here is a list of the most common Service Provider Codes:
* Oi (31)
* Vivo (15)
* Tim (41)
* Embratel / Claro (21)
* GVT (25)
* CTBC (12)

Finally, large urban centers should have decent enough 4G coverage and VoIP applications such as WhatsApp are very popular for making cheap long and short distance calls.
