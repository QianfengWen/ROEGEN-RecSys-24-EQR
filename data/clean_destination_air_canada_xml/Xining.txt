Xining (西宁; Xīníng; Tibetan: Sulang) is the capital of Province and the capital of Xining City District, a prefecture of Qinghai.

Understand

The large city of Xining acts as one of the major gateways to the Tibetan Plateau. It is an ancient highland city on the Yellow River which offers many scenic spots and historical sites. Although the city itself has a strong Islamic flavor, as it is home to many Hui people, you will start getting a more Tibetan feel as you move away from the city.

Taxis run on the meter (¥8 flagfall) but some drivers are open to negotiation, especially late at night.

See

* Taoist Temple in the hills. At the moment a lot of it is closed for safety reasons. This includes the walkways between man-made caves in the mountain. There is a pagoda above, on the hill. From here there is a great view over the city.

* A nice park set above the city centre area from which you can see a panorama of the city from the viewing platform at the top, past the Muslim Mausoleum. Most parts are secluded by some nice trees and small lakes which enables you to feel you are a little bit away from the bustle of the city.

* The main mosque in Xining. A spectacular site when ten of thousands of Muslims gather for prayer during the morning of Hari Raya Puasa.
 
* See the Taoist Tulou (Rammed-earth Pavillion)

* 

* 

* 

* Nice place for those curious about Qinghai's history and ethnic relationships.

* 

* The zoo is a little rundown and if you have never been to a Chinese zoo then you may not like the way the animals are kept. That said, some of the animals (Monkeys and big cats) are actually pretty good and seem healthy and happy. The zoo won't be winning any awards but if you have some spare time and want to spend 2 - 3 hours somewhere, the zoo is an ok distraction

* the lake inself has unfortunaltelly been turned into a disney like sceneray for chinese tourist as usual. you will not be free to go anywhere you want, followon the same path that others chinese tourists taking pictures of themselves. Additional 50 yuans for a trip with the small train. remark than in early spetember the lake was not dry yet, temperature were mild (even though we were at more than 3000m)

Do
Plan your trip to Eastern Tibet (Rebkong/ Tongren, and Labrang) from Xining or to Tibet Autonomous Region by taking a train or a flight to Lhasa.

Buy
The Banks in Xining only accepts foreign credit cards, not debit cards. The only exeption is the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China(中国工商银行）, and "China Construction Bank"（中国建设银行） accepts Bank of America debit cards. (As of 03/09/2012, Bank of China accepted a foreign Visa Debit Card with no problems)

Handmade Tibetan Handicrafts and jewelry made by Tibetans in Qinghai can be bought at the AmdoCraft Shop . The shop is located at the South Gate of JieSenHuaYuanat the Hutai 3rd Alley (冷湖路2 杰森花园)

There is a very interesting Tibetan Market close to the Eastern Railway Station and opposite the long distance Bus Station.

Eat
Xining's main minority groups provide a large portion of the food on offer. The Hui, a broad term for Chinese Muslims, serve up spicy noodles, lamb kababs and flatbread (bing). Tibetan food choices are concentrated around the train station, mostly small places that serve momos and noodles and seat guests on small coaches.

Local Food
There is a restaurant area right next to the Shuijing Xiang Bazaar, in the center of the city, and throughout the evening and into the night there are many street stalls serving good food around Ximen and on the western side of Jianguo Road.

* The front end of the market has many small snack stands selling spicy ground meat birds egg pizza-style bing (¥3), spicier Liangpi noodle (¥4.5) and mouth cooling bowl-set yoghurt with a creaming texture and slightly sour/citrus flavour (¥3). Further into the market mounds of dried fruit and nuts from the region can be bought by weight.

* This bustling alleyway is like Xining's China Town. The whole alley is line with many different types of Chinese cuisine, including a Uyghur Restaurant.

Western Food

Western food options are slim, but you can get various options if you know where to look. The two best areas are on XiaDu DaJie, near GuoJiCun XiaoQu (International Village Complex) and in the WangFuJing Plaza, off WuSi DaJie.

*There are a total of three KFC's in the city, but this is by far the most centrally located.

*There is another Pizza Hut on the western side of the Xining Plaze, but this one is the most centrally located.

*As good as Pizza Hut, but like them, if you are a large group ordering a lot of Pizza's they may take a while.

* as to October 2013 Casa Mia does not exists anymore. It has been replaced by a ripoff called Bolonia that has mediocare chinese version of italian food.

*Options for western food here such as burgers and pizza.

*Despite the name they also do some western food such as Pizza, takes a little while to arrive but very good quality.

Drink
Cafes

The city is littered with small coffee shops, especially around the newer apartment complexes that are being developed. See below for some of the better ones.

*This coffee shop, which also offers AmdoCraft Tibetan Handicraft products, provides a relaxed, quiet atmosphere in which to sip and sample real, fresh-brewed coffee, or sup on steaming pastries, cakes, and cookies. The coffee is some of the most inexpensive real coffee in the area. Free WIFI.

*Expat couple from the UK opened this cafe in 2009. Excellent coffee and home-made food at a great price. Favourite dishes include Mexican Wraps, Chilli, Bagels of all kinds, Pancakes & Waffles with sweet or savoury toppings. Also a great place to meet other foreign residents or expats in Xining. Free wifi.

*Great little cafe opened up by an American expat in Xining. Relaxed atmosphere, good wifi, and, some say, the best coffee in the city. They have desserts and sandwiches as well. 

Bars

A number of bars are located at the end of the city's main snack street. These tiny places each have only a dozen tables, and all offer extensive drink specials. Beer starts at ¥6 for a Tsingtao, but expensive imported liquor is also available. There is usually no cover charge.

*A complex of bars by the riverside, built around an atrium. You can't see them from the road, but just below the bridge you will see a number of cars parked, with steps down into the park. About a half dozen or so small bars.

*A large complex with about two dozen bars over three different floors with an open center atrium. You can choose between more relaxed lounge bars, live music venues, or one or two bars that have dance floors on the ground floor. 

Night Clubs
*SOHO is Xining's most popular nightclub, usually busy past 2am most nights. Lots of tables and a bar, but there is no dancing. Music is mostly live. SOHO is a nightclub franchise in China, but this one apparently is an "unofficial club."

*Similar to SOHO bar, but a larger dance floor. Crowded on the weekends, but a bigger crowd at SOHO.

Sleep
Budget
There are dozens of small guesthouses near the train and long distance bus station. Look for the characters "招待所," which in this part of town are on every other building. Most places seem aimable to taking foreigners, and prices range from ¥10 in a grimy four-room bunk (expect the other occupants to smoke in the room all night long) to ¥100 for a deluxe double. More guesthouses can be found around the town's West Gate, or Ximen.

Trips from Xining travel agencies offer apparently cheap 60 yuan day trips to Qinghaihu National Park. This price does not include entry to 丹噶尔 old town (50 yuan), 赞普林卡 (40 yuan), 日月山（40 yuan) or the wharf at Qinghaihu (100 yuan) the 'park' itself. The last of these seems the most overpriced for what it is - but you are expected to pay. There may be a couple of forced shopping stops, including a minimum 30-minute wait at a jade/crystal sales outlet.
