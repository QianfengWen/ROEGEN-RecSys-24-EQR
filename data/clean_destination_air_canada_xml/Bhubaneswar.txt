Bhubaneswar is the capital of the state of (formerly known as Orissa).

Understand
Bhubaneswar, the capital of Odisha, is known for its architecture and ancient temples. It is also a Buddhists and Hindu pilgrimage destination. The 10th century Lingaraja temple, dedicated to Shiva, has been described as "the truest fusion of dream and reality." The surface of the 55 meter high Lingaraja temple is covered with carvings. Sculpture and architecture fused elegantly to create a perfect harmony. The best times to visit are between October and March.

This city is most renowned for changing the conqueror Asoka to the conquered. The great Kalinga War took place here between Emperor Asoka and Kalinga (the old empire of Odisha). Asoka was overwhelmed at the gory of blood that flowed like a river. Asokan inscriptions still stand testimony for this. Having merged its intriguing past so uniquely with its modern aspirations, it forms an integral link in the Golden Triangle that incorporates the holy city of Puri (Jagannath Temple) and Konark (Sun temple). The twin cave groups of Kandagiri and Udayagiri are evidence of the region's antiquity, dating to the 2nd century BC or the early Jain monastery.

Modern Bhubaneswar is a well planned city with wide roads and many gardens and parks. The plan was made by Otto H. Koenigsberger, a German town planner. Though part of the city has stayed faithful to the plan, it has grown rapidly over the last few decades and has made the planning process unwieldy.

Bhubaneswar is one of three cities that make up three temple towns of Odisha and make the golden temple triangle of Eastern India. Bhubaneswar is a very religious center for Hindus and Buddhists. Bhubaneswar is also known as the temple city and there are many excellent examples of Oriya architecture in the old part of the city. 

* Almost all the famous temples of Bhubaneswar are located here most of which were constructed in the 11th to 13th century period. Around 400 temples of varying sizes are located here. Be sure to visit Traffic Mahadev, a small temple which acts as a road divider.

* The 10th or 11th-century Lingaraja temple of Bhubaneswar has been described as "the truest fusion of dream and reality". A rare masterpiece, the Lingaraja temple has been rated one of the finest examples of purely Hindu temple in India by Ferguson, the noted art critic and historian. Every inch of the surface of the 55 m-high Lingaraja temple is covered with elaborate carvings. Sculpture and architecture fused elegantly to create a perfect harmony. Non-Hindus are not permitted inside. However there is an elevated viewing platform next to one of the boundary walls. To reach the platform, face the temple's main entrance and walk around to the right. There is a laneway leading to the back of the temple and the platform.

* This large lake near to Lingaraj and Ananta Vasudeva temples keeps a drop (bindu) of every holy river in it.

* These twin hills served as the site of an ancient Jain monastery which was carved into cave like chambers in the face of the hill. Dating back to the 2nd century BC, some of the caves have beautiful carvings. The Rani Gumpha (Queen's Cave), one of the largest and double-storied, is ornately embellished with beautiful carvings. In the Hati Gumpha (Elephant Cave), King Kharavela has carved out the chronicles of his reign.

* Looking down on the plains that bore witness to the gruesome war waged on Kalinga by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka, stand the rock edicts of Dhauli. It was here that King Ashoka, full of remorse after the Kalinga War in 261 BC, renounced his blood-thirsty campaign and turned to Buddhism. The edicts are a living testimony to the King's change of heart. He urges his administrators to rule the land with justice and compassion. The edicts are so remarkable that they have been excellently preserved, despite the fact that they date back to the 3rd century BC. A sculpted elephant, the symbol of the boundless powers of Lord Buddha, tops the rock edicts. The Shanti Stupa or the peace pagoda, built through the Indo-Japanese collaboration, is located on the opposite hill.

* Dating back to 10th century this temple marks an important transition point between the early and the later phases of the Kalinga architecture. The highlight is the magnificent torana - the decorative gateway, an arched masterpiece, reminiscent of Buddhist influence in Odisha. This temple is considered to be the gem of Odishan architecture. The beautiful sculptures eloquently speak of the sense of proportion and perspective of the sculptor and their unique ability in the exact depiction of the minutest objects. Mukteswara means "Lord of freedom".

* This temple got its name from a red-gold sandstone used, which is called Rajarani locally. It has no presiding deity but many intricately carved figurines in various stages of daily chores. 

* Housing a rich collection of sculptures, coins, copper plates, stone inscriptions, lithic and bronze age tools, rare manuscripts written on palm leaves, traditional and folk musical instruments. Rare epigraphic records are preserved in the Epigraphy Gallery.

* Non-Hindus and foreigners who desire to visit a Hindu temple can go to this temple - the devotees are friendly and there is a cheap and clean vegetarian restaurant.

* The zoo has some rare species of animals and is particularly well known for white tigers. There is a nice lake inside for boating, a ropeway, also the Botanical Garden is adjacent to the zoo. Avoid visiting the park on weekends when it gets pretty crowded. Open 8 am - 5 pm.
Every Monday closed.

* The museum gives an impressive insight into the culture of the many different tribals living in and around Odisha. Tools, clothes and artwork is presented over several halls. In every area a guide of the museum will take care of you and give you extensive explanations - you really get to know something about the things you see. Anyway there is no entry fee.

*Deras Dam: It is situated near Chandaka Sanctuary, around 20 Kms away from the Bhubaneswar Baramunda Busstand. It is a pristine, quite lake in the midst of the nature.

Do

* Just walk on the streets, particularly the main markets at Unit 1 or Unit 2. You can experience the Oriya flavor from the street hawkers, shopkeepers, their customers, practically everyone. Visit the scores of parks in the city. The planetarium for one is good. The science park refreshes your basics and takes you back to school days. Or go around the rose garden in CRPF square or the recent NICCO park. 

* There may be an odd play going on in Rabindra Mandap, opposite the General Post Office. Or a dance program at Soochana Bhavan. This place also had radio news broadcasts (May1998) and a newspaper library. Visit places such as the hall of dance called Natamandira or the bhoga-mandapa, meaning hall of offering. Though these particular places can be found around the temple, the temple itself is off limits to non-Hindus.

* Enjoy the architecture of both ancient temples and the modern buildings in Sachivalaya Road, or just take time and enjoy the architecture of the temples and experience the religious culture.

* Take a short trip to nearby places like the above mentioned the Dhauligiri or the Khandagiri-Udaigiri, those moments will always mingle in you memories.

Stay safe
Bhubaneswar is one of the greenest cities in India and it has a clean look, with adequate arrangement for dustbins made by the local municipal authorities. It is a generally peaceful city with hardly any history of violence. Nevertheless, you should avoid travelling late in night as the city tends to sleep early. Also, wear cool, white clothes in the summer.

Respect
The temples are managed in the age-old traditions so be aware of the Hindu rituals and traditions before entering them. Make sure to take off your footwear when you enter a temple or any household. Women in particular needed to be cautious in their clothing and so-called hygiene, but things are more equitable now.

Cope
It tends to be too hot in summer. So be careful if it comes in itinerary during April/May. Otherwise, it is welcome weather all through the year. The evenings are very tender and cool.Be aware of the many touts near to the tourist places--railways, temples, and hotels. The 'Pandas' can be notorious if not shown respect. But be within your limits and a polite no (sometimes repetitive) will be ok to avoid getting cheated.in case you have an issue with an auto rickshaw driver or taxi then please report immediately to a police outpost. There is always one around the corner. The police are also very helpful or just call 100.
