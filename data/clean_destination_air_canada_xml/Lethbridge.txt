Lethbridge is located in southern , . The city is a commercial hub for the many smaller farming and ranching communities in the surrounding area. It is quiet and on the small side, but has a friendly population. Lethbridge has approximately 83 000 people, and that number is growing fast. The natural beauty of the area is in its starkness. The coulees are a valley formed by erosion. The Old Man River runs through this interesting landscape. The valley provides some shelter from the wind, which can be quite strong at almost any time of the year.

Understand
Before European settlement of Lethbridge the area was under the control of the Blackfoot tribe of Native Americans. As more and more European settlers came many Natives were forced into a new life and eventually the Natives signed over their control of the territory to Canada. Before the Canadian government established full control over the area a booming whiskey trade took root. It took the intervention of the NWMP (North-West Mounted Police) to stop these illegal activities. Soon after this a major coal mining operation started to develop in the coulee regions of Coalbanks. Coalbanks was renamed Lethbridge in 1885. Lethbridge received city status in 1906. 

During World War II, many Japanese Canadians and German POW's were interned in Lethbridge. After the war many stayed having established a new life. As a result, you'll see some influences of Japanese and German culture blended with the surrounding Ukrainian, Dutch, Mormon, Native and Hutterite cultures.

Today Lethbridge is undergoing a strong economic boom and as a result many new businesses are cropping up. There is also a large population boom but many businesses are still looking for people to work because there are still so few people to work.

Get in

By Car

The roads coming in to and out of Lethbridge are Highway 3 (runs east-west, also known as Crowsnest Highway), Highway 4 (which leads south to the United States) and Highway 5 (taking you to Waterton).

If you are coming from the United States through the Coutts border crossing, you'll likely enter the city on Highway 4. As you enter the city, you can take a right on 43rd Street to connect to Highway 3. If you continue straight, the next large intersection is Highway 5 (Mayor Magrath Drive within Lethbridge). Left (or South) on Highway 5 will take you to most of the city's big box stores (Wal-Mart, Superstore, Costco, Home Depot, etc) and eventually the airport. 

If you are coming into the city from Waterton, you'll enter on Highway. This will take you past the airport and the big box stores mentioned above. Highway 5 turns into Mayor Magrath Drive within the city, one of the city's main thoroughfares.

If you are coming from or anywhere east of Lethbridge, you'll enter on Highway 3. Highway 3 becomes Crowsnest Trail and goes through the heart of Lethbridge.

If you are coming from the west (, , ) or north (, assuming you didn't miss the turn at ), you'll enter the city on Highway 3.
