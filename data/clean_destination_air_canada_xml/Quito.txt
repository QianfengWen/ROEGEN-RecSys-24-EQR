Quito, formally San Francisco de Quito, is the capital city of , and at an elevation of 9,350 feet (2,800 meters above sea level), it is the second highest official capital city in the world, after La Paz, Bolivia. Located in Ecuador, South America, Quito is situated in the Guayllabamba river basin, on the eastern slopes of Pichincha Volcano, an active stratovolcano in the Andes mountains. With a population of 2,671,191 according to the last census (2014), Quito is the second most populous city in Ecuador, after . It is also the capital of the Pichincha Province and the seat of the Quito Canton|Metropolitan District of Quito. In 2008, the city was designated as the headquarters of the Union of South American Nations, UNASUR. Quito, a beautiful city and capital of Ecuador, offers great cultural activity throughout its districts and is a great starting point for visits to the rest of .

The historic center of Quito has one of the largest, least-altered and best-preserved historic centers in the Americas, and is undoubtedly one of the cities main tourist attractions. Quito, along with , were the first World Cultural Heritage Sites declared by UNESCO in 1978. The central square of Quito is located about 25 km south of the equator; the city itself extends to within about 1 km of zero latitude. A monument and museum marking the general location of the equator is known locally as "Mitad del Mundo" (the middle of the world), to avoid confusion, as the word "ecuador" is spanish language for "equator".

Understand

Quito lies between two mountain ranges and its altitude is 2,800 metres or about 9,200 feet. It may take you a couple of days to get accustomed to the altitude. Quito is said to have "all four seasons in a day". Because of its elevation and its proximity to the equator, Quito has a fairly constant cool climate. The average temperature at noon is 18.7 °C (65.7 °F) with a normal night-time low of 9.3 °C (48.7 °F).14 The annual average temperature is 14 °C (57 °F). Throughout the year, the city is considered to have two seasons: winter and summer. Winter is usually very rainy, specially during the month of April. Summer becomes very dry and windy. Once the sun goes down it can get downright cold, so dressing in layers just in case is a good idea. A common first time visitor's mistake is assuming that since the city is near the equator, the climate is going to be really hot, and doesn't bring along warmer clothes. Don't be that person.

Be prepared to speak some basic Spanish in order to get along. Quito is an excellent city in which to learn Spanish before heading off to other places in South America. The Spanish spoken in Quito is very clear and it is spoken slowly in comparison to coastal areas. Dozens of Spanish-learning institutions have locations all around town. Very few locals speak English except in the touristy areas of North Quito which includes "La Mariscal" quarter, where most tourist businesses are located. This quarter also happens to be city's favorite local night life destination, so be prepared to mingle. Bars, nightclubs, restaurants, hostels and internet cafes abound. Young people from many countries tend to congregate there.

Ecuador, especially the Sierra region that includes Quito, is culturally a conservative society. This is reflected in manner of dress. People of all socio-economic backgrounds tend to dress up in Ecuador. For men, this means a pair of trousers and a button down shirt. For women, slacks or dresses are acceptable. Men and women seldom wear short pants in Quito, although in recent years casual clothes have become somewhat more accepted especially among the young. Some popular nightclubs and restaurants enforce a dress code, so please keep that in mind if you are planning on making a reservation. 

The Quito Visitors Bureau has several information centres around the city. These include at the International Arrivals terminal at the airport; the small Parque Gabriela Mistral, on Reina Victoria in the Mariscal quarter; the Banco Central Museum in the Mariscal District; and finally, in the Old Town, on the ground floor of the Palacio Municipal on one side of Plaza Grande - their main location. This includes helpful staff, lockers for leaving bags, maps, leaflets and books for sale, a store of Ecuadorian crafts. This offices offers subsidised guided tours, with various routes available. The contacts for the main office are: +593 2 2570-786 / 2586 - 591, info@quito-turismo.com The Visitors' Bureau publishes a useful A3-size map with most of the city's attractions. You can pick it up at their information offices. They also publish a number of pocket guides on various themes, including walking guides, a guide to the city's Viewpoints, a guide to the Mariscal, routes north, south and northwest. Their website has an interactive map; listings of hotels, restaurants, videos and more useful information for your visit.

If you are planning to travel to the rest of the country, a good place to visit is Ecuador's Ministry of Tourism office, which is located on El Telégrafo E7-58 entre El Tiempo y Av. De los Shyris, south of La Carolina Park. 

Districts
Quito is roughly divided into three parts: the Old City (Centro Histórico) in the middle, with South (Sur) and North (Norte) districts to either side. 

* The South part is mainly industrial and residential, a working class area. It is the most inhabited district. Everything here tends to be cheaper in cost than the other districts. The past two decades have seen a lot of development regarding infrastructure in this area. The city's main inter-province bus terminal is located here in the Quitumbe district, as well as the main train station.

* The North part is the modern Quito, with high-rise buildings, shopping centers, the financial district (locally known as the "micro-centro", and upper-class residential areas and some working-class housing areas. This area of Quito is also home to several museums, art galleries and the cities most renown education institutions, as well as home to a variety of restaurants and nightlife options. The North Part of Quito is also home to the city's largest concentration of parks, with the most new one being Parque Bicentenario.

* The Old City continues to be Quito's main attraction: it boasts no fewer than 40 churches, 17 plazas and 16 convents and monasteries (many of these with guided tours). It's been called the 'Reliquary of the Americas' for the richness of its colonial- and independence-era architecture and heritage. It's a great district to wander, with several excellent museums, theatres, and plenty of restaurants and terrace cafes for a rest while sightseeing.

* Quito's surrounding valleys (Valle de Tumbaco & Valle de los Chillos) also are great weekend get aways, with excellent local ecuadorian cuisine, as well as some great outdoor eco-tourism opportunities (bicycle routes, mountain biking, etc).

Get in

By Plane
* Aeropuerto Internacional Mariscal Sucre() (), is the busiest airport in Ecuador and one of the busiest airports in South America. It is located in the Tababela parish, about 18 kilometres (11 mi) east of Quito and serves as the largest hub of TAME, the flag carrier of Ecuador, with an average of over 220 daily flights. It is well outside the city--between the towns of Tababela and Puembo. It features one of the longest runways in Latin America: 4,100&nbsp;m long by 45&nbsp;m wide, that allow an average of 44 take-offs and landings per hour. It opened in February 2013 and replaced the old Mariscal Sucre International Airport, which is now a park called Parque Bicentenario.

You no longer have to pay an airport fee when leaving Quito by air (2/2011). As of February 2011 international fares should already include the tax in the price of the ticket. 

The travel time from the new airport to Quito can range from 45 min to 60 minutes (depending on where in Quito you want to go, and which transportation option you choose). There are several ways of doing this:

*Public Bus - A public bus travels between the airport and the city. Coming from the international arrivals, look for the sign 'transporte colectivo'. You will find the local bus (green, modern bus) right next to the taxi line. Buses depart every 15 min to Rio Coca terminal (service from 6.20 am to 9.30 pm for Airport --> Rio Coca terminal and from 5.45 am to 9.30 pm Rio Coca --> Airport) and will cost you $2. After about 1 h you will arrive in Rio Coca terminal where you can switch to a Metrobus Rojo or Ecovia bus that can bring you to Mariscal Sucre or the Old town within 30 min and for $ 0.25, if you take a taxi from Rio Coca terminal to old town, it's about $5~6. If you are going to the airport, Rio Coca is the last stop on the red line (Ecovia).
*Airport Express Bus - The express bus departs from the old Quito airport and goes directly to the new airport without stops. The buses have free WiFi. Journey Time: up to 1 hr. Departs: every 20-30 min / 24 hours per day. Cost: $8. Tickets can be purchased on-line and also at both of both airports. You are permitted 1 piece of luggage up to 23&nbsp;kg, and one piece of hand luggage. For additional luggage, there is a surcharge of US$2 and for over sized luggage the surcharge is US$2.50.

*Taxis - The estimated cost of a taxi between the city and airport is US$22-46. Taxis have a fixed fare towards and from the airport, which varies depending on which part of Quito you are travelling to, you can get the voucher with price at the official counter of the taxi queue. Towards the airport the fare is generally around 2~4$ less expensive than from the airport. The fare for the most probable tourist destinations (La Mariscal area) is 24$ or 26$ (old town). If your destination is in the Tumbaco Valley (where Cumbaya is located), the fare is 13,5$, from the airport.

By Bus
Coach buses from over 100 companies connect Quito with the surrounding area and the rest of the country. For complete schedules and more bus info, see Getting Around section of page.

The single, old "Terminal Terrestre," which was located in Cumandá (Old City)has been replaced by two new terminals, which are linked by an inter-city bus ($1, 1.5 hours - May 2022) that leaves every 10 minutes: 

1. Terminal Quitumbe (located in the south of Quito), services all the buses that go to any destination south of Quito: Basically all of the coastal provinces, all of the amazonian provinces, and all of the mountain region (Sierra) provinces except two: Carchi and Imbabura. This terminal can be reached by local buses (which often leave La Marin in Old Town) or by the Trolebus and Ecovia bus systems. It takes about an hour to get from Centro Historico to Quitumbe using Trolebus or Ecovia.

2. Terminal Norte Carcelén (located in the far north of Quito), services buses that go towards Carchi and Imbabura provinces (where Otavalo and other tourist attractions are located) . This terminal can be reached by local buses (which you can catch at La Marin in Old Town or El Ejido in New Town) or by Ecovia, Trole and Metrobus. By Trole, take it northbound to the "La Y" station, but get off at the stop AFTER "La Y" called "Terminal Norte de Trolebus". It is a big bus station. There is a connecting bus from "Terminal Norte de Trolebus" station to "Terminal Norte Carcelén". (Reverse to get back.)

*Some bus companies have their own terminals near La Mariscal. These include Panamericana (right on Colon Av.), TransEsmeraldas (one block north of Colon Av.), Flota Imbabura (above El Ejido), Reina del Camino (also above El Ejido), Transportes Ecuador (right on Juan Leon Mera Avenue, parallel to Amazons Ave.)

Inter-city bus fares are fixed according to the route but generally the price is already established. So if for some reason, your bus trip takes double the time to get to your destination, for whatever reason (damaged road, too much traffic, etc.) you don't have to pay extra hours. The travel time to Guayaquil is 9 hours. It is recommended for longer rides to usually make arrangements at night, as usually you'll arrive in the morning and more transport options will be available to you in your destination. Complete bus schedules, as well as trains and shuttles can also be found at AndesTransit and EcuadorBus.

In all bus stations, wether private or public, the same safeguards apply: as long as you hold on to your belongings and don't hang around there at odd hours, it is safe. People walk around the bus terminal, and will probably shout at you asking where you are going. They either work for a bus company and want to get you to buy a ticket with that company or want to help you find the bus you are looking for in exchange for a tip. If you arrive with a lot of luggage it's best to avoid the public transportation system in Quito and take a taxi to your hotel. Ecuadorian long-distance buses will generally let passengers off anywhere along their route.

Ecuador Hop is a new and refreshing hop on-hop off bus service that takes you to discover the real Ecuador. It now joins its sister companies, Peru Hop and Bolivia Hop, who have helped over 150,000 travellers discover South America. Find out more on how it works here.

Get around

Orientation
Orientation is not a big problem in Quito. The city is elongated. The Panecillo separates the South from the Old City, and the areas between Parque La Alameda and Parque el Ejido is generally regarded as the start of the North. To the west, is the imposing Rucu/Guagua Pichincha volcano, that overlooks the entire city, no matter where you are. To the east of the city, is the Valle de Tumbaco, which is also the location of Quito's Mariscal Sucre Airport.

Public Transportation
There are 3 independent public, 'enclosed stations' systems of buses. They are very inexpensive ($0.25 for a single ride). These lines follow north-south-lines down through the heart of Quito, and they have stations close to La Mariscal where most tourist hotspots are located. Take note that there is no tradition of waiting for people to disembark before people board, so this may take some getting used to.

* El Trole or The Trolley: Green stations, buses of different colors, run from station La Y in the north (near The Plaza de Toros), to Quitumbe in the south, which could take one and a half hour from start to finish. This is the main and most used system by the locals, and also has the most stops. You can get to the bus terminal in the South (Quitumbe), but Ecovia is recommended as it has an express lane.

* Metrobus: Blue stations marked with a Q, buses of different colors, run from Universidad Central in America Avenue, next to Prensa Ave, and then to Diego de Vasquez Ave. until Carcelen in the far north of the city. This is the best bus system you have to use for visitors who want to visit the Mitad del Mundo Monument. In the Ofelia bus station there are public buses which go to Mitad del Mundo, which costs an extra $0.35 fare.

* Ecovia: Red buses and stations marked with an e run from Rio Coca Station (north) to La Marin Station inside the Quito historic Downtown. Serves stations close to Casa de la Cultura and Estadio Olímpico, as well as the popular La Mariscal area. Has an express lane towards the "Quitumbe" bus station.

* A subway system is currently being built. It is expected to start operation in 2018-2019. The entirety of the city's public and private transportation is also being redesigned around this main backbone, so expect several changes in the following years.

Private Transportation

* Private bus companies also have hundreds of lines that go all around the city. You can identify them by their blue color. The fare is $0.25 for a one way trip. The routes are too many to list. If there is an avenue, you can be sure there is a bus line that goes through it. These buses usually have placards with a list of destinations on its front windows. It is recommended to ask knowledgeable locals for tips on getting around the city using these buses. 

* To travel towards the Tumbaco Valley, and for cheap buses to the airport, Ecovia's Rio Coca Station is also right beside the Interprovincial Private (Green Bus) Station. The buses are painted green, and the fare depends on which part of the Valley you are travelling towards. The fare to the main part of Cumbaya is $0.25, and the fare towards the airport is $2.00. The fare is usually paid when you get off the bus in your destination.

* Taxis are everywhere and are relatively inexpensive compared to other cities in the world. A taxi ride costs a minimum fare of US$1.45 during the day (from 6AM to 7PM) and a minimum fare of US$1.75 at night. Most rides are short, and local hotspots are close to each other, so it's rare for a ride to exceed 5$ in price. A general guideline is to only use official taxis (yellow with a number painted on the door). Make sure the driver turns on the taxi meter if you don't want to get ripped off and find another taxi if they claim the taximeter device is broken. At night or if they refuse to use the taximeter, negotiate the price before getting in, or wait for the next cab. Carry small denominations of money and have exact change for your taxi fare. If you do not have exact change, taxi drivers conveniently won't be able to make change for you and will try to convince you to make the change a tip instead (tipping is not done in Ecuador). When taking a taxi be sure you are aware of the fastest route; if a driver is using the meter he may take the scenic route. Most major hotels have taxis that they have approved as safe and legitimate. If unsure about a taxi, call your hotel and they can generally have a safe taxi dispatched to your location.

* If you have a smartphone, or a tablet, and have internet access (Wi-fi), it is highly recommended to download a local taxi calling app. The most popular one is EasyTaxi, but there are several others, like SmartTaxi. Calling a cab with this app is extremely fast, with an experience similar to what UBER offers in major cities in the USA. The best part, is that the fare is exactly the same as if you hauled a cab in the street, no extra charge is included. Just pay what the taxi meter says. Taxis called using these apps will be more reliable and won't try to rip you off as the drivers can be banned from the service if they get too many complaints.

Bikes
A bike renaissance is happening in Quito, despite its hilly topgraphy. More and more locals and tourists are starting to use bikes as their main form of transportation. New permanent bike lanes (opened in 2012) and other bike related activities, such as nightly bike tours in the Old City, are frequent. If you rent a bike to travel around Quito we do recommend you are careful and use a helmet, it is a nice adventure and a cheap way to get around.

* Since 2012 Quito has a public bike sharing system, called BiciQuito. The cost is currently 25$ a year, and the system currently has most of its stations in the North part of the city, with several in the Old City as well. Might be a good option to consider if you are planning on staying for more than just a couple of days.

* A great way to get to know A LOT of Quito is to participate in the weekly Ciclopaseo, that is done every Sunday. The Ciclopaseo is a project organized by the local organization Ciclopolis to promote urban cycling, sustainable transportation, and community building in Quito. A route of 30 km running from the North to South of the city is closed to traffic every Sunday from 8 am until 2 pm to give preference to bicyclers and pedestrians. The project is run in cooperation with the Municipality and features diverse locations of the city from Carolina Park, Ejido Park the The Historic Center of Quito, Avenue Rio Amazonas, and the The Panecillo.

Other

* You can rent a car in Quito, but it's not recommended for getting around the city. It's not worth the effort with taxis so cheap. Renting a car is a possibility for exploring further afield, to the Cotopaxi or Otavalo or Papallacta areas, for instance, but is only recommended for those who speak a bit of Spanish and can handle the tension of Ecuador's 'lax' driving rules.

* The railway station is at the south end of the old city, close to the El Trole route, in the beautiful Chimbacalle neighborhood. The trains rides mostly service tourist destinations south of the city, like El Boliche National Park, and last year saw the inauguration of the "Tren Crucero" a luxury train ride that goes to Guayaquil and takes about 3-4 days to complete. More information can be found in the Tren Ecuador website.

* City Tours: A variety of tour operators offer half-a-day to full-day city tours to get you orientated, see the main museums, plazas, churches and palaces. Among them is Cuyabeno Lodge, operating out of its Quito office; ☎ (++593) (2) 521212 and cell (++593)(0)9980 3395; email: info@cuyabenolodge.com

The sculpture represents a winged virgin stepping on the devil's head (in the form of a serpent) and is displayed in the main altar.

Sightseeing

*Teleferico. This is the world's second-highest cable car. It's located on the eastern flanks of the which overlooks the whole city. It hoists visitors up to an amazing 4,000 meters (12,000 feet). On clear days, one can spot half-a-dozen volcanoes and spy the entire city below. You can also hike up from here to the Guagua Pichincha Volcano, which is active. See Teleferico website for details It is $4 for locals, but $8.50 (as of 2019-05-30) for foreigners. There is also an express lane option for more money. Get a taxi to take you to the teleferico. A colectivo takes you back to the old town for $1.

*Calle de la Ronda. This street in the Old Town was restored by Municipality and FONSAL in 2007. It was transformed with the help and cooperation of the local residents. It's a romantic cobbled street just off the Plaza Santo Domingo (or it can be reached via Garcia Moreno by the City Museum). There are shops, patios, art galleries and modest cafe restaurants now, all run by residents. Cultural events are common at the weekends. 

*La Vírgen del Panecillo. Adjacent to the Old City, El Panecillo is a large hill on top of which is La Virgin del Panecillo, a large statue of the 'winged' Virgin Mary. She can be seen from most points in the city. Local legend has it that she is the only virgin in Quito. Never walk up the hill, always take a taxi or a bus as the walk up can be dangerous.

*Mitad del Mundo. Just outside of Quito is where the measurements were first made that proved that the shape of the Earth is in fact an oblate spheroid. Commemorating this is a large monument that straddles the equator called Mitad del Mundo or middle of the world. Note, however, that the true equator is not at the Mitad del Mundo monument. Through the magic of GPS technology, we now know that it is only 240 meters away. The entrance for the park is $5 (08/2018 included entrance to small museums). For some of the attractions you have to pay extra. To get there you can take Metrobus to Ofelia and then another bus to Mitad del Mundo. There is also a direct bus from Miraflores in central Quito to Mitad del Mundo ($0.40 Dec 2015). Catch this bus on calle 18 de Septiembre, close to the corner with Av America. It later stops at Universidad Central and all along Av Mariscal Sucre (aka Av Occidental). The ride takes about an hour. 

*The Intiñan Solar Museum is right next to the Mitad del Mundo monument on the other side of the north fence, and located along the true equator as verified by GPS (as opposed to the Mitad del Mundo monument). For $4 you can have a tour of this little museum. They demonstrate the Coriolis effect and even let you try it (ask for repeating the experiment on your own and they will deny it). Other "experiments" showing effects that apparently only occur on the equator are also scams. The tour is completed by some untrue facts about indigenous cultures in Ecuador and is just straining after effect. In spite of the sprinkling of inaccuracies, some people find the museum much more interesting and informative than the Mitad del Mundo. At the end of the museum tour, you can also receive a stamp in your passport indicating that you've visited the exact equator. When you go to the middle of the world, you can just take a bus ($0.40) straight there, or go with a tour, or hire a taxi driver by the hour. The hourly rate should be in the $12 or less range. Buses leave from the Occidental or Av. America for $0.40 and have "Mitad del Mundo" clearly written large on the front. This is the most economical option and tours of the Intiñan Solar Museum are $4. Entry to the monument nearby is $2, but only worth it for a photo straddling the equator - which you can do at the 'real' equator nearby at Intiñan. Although, some say that the Intiñan's marked line for the equator is also slightly inaccurate, and that the true equator lies closer to the museum's ticket booth if you check by GPS.

Parks

*Parque La Carolina is one of Quito's most frequented parks. On weekends, thousands of locals go to have picnics, play some sports, and overall just enjoy what the park has to offer. It has a lot of sport and recreation areas, a well as a running track, and several bike routes. Food carts with local eats abound. The southern portion of the park feature a beautiful artificial lake with several islands, as well a decently sized skate park. The center of the Park is home to the Botanical Garden, as well as a youth cultural and scientific institution called Mundo Juvenil.

*Parque Metropolitano del Sur. Quito's biggest park, at 750 hectares, located in the South of the city, right beside Avenida Simon Bolivar. Lots of recreational facilities, bike and ecological trekking routes. It is also home to a part of the ancient "Qapac Ñan" or "Camino del Inca (Inca Trail) route.

*Parque Metropolitano Guanguiltagua Quito's second biggest park at 557 hectares, located in the North of Quito.

Do

* Explore the Old Town With its gorgeous mixture of colonial and republican/independence era architecture (Late 1500's to 1800's), relaxing plazas and a stunning number of churches. If you happen to be there during Christmas or Easter, you'll be amazed at the number of events, masses, and processions that bring out the crowds. You'll find craft shops, cafes, restaurants and hotels across its grid of streets. 

*Have lunch in traditional Mercado Quito's population have a tradition of shopping for groceries in "Mercados", which are all over the city. They are usually big buildings that occupy an entire city block. Check out Mercado Santa Clara and Mercado Iñaquito in the north. If you feel more adventurous, head out to the weekend only open air Mercado La Ofelia in Cotocollao in the north. Besides cheap groceries, most of these markets also offer cheap traditional eats as well, with fresh ingredients. If you aren't that hungry, then have a big glass of freshly made juice. You won't regret it!

* A recommended walking tour that could enhance your vision of the Historic Center is as follows. Take the trolley (watch your belongings) south until "Cumanda" stop. Get down, you are on Maldonado street. There you will have an impressive view of what once was the "Jerusalem" ravine, which stands between Panecillo and the core. Walk north past the trolley stop and go down a narrow stairway that brings you to La Ronda street, of Pre-columbian origins. Walk up picturesque La Ronda until you reach Av. 24 de Mayo. This boulevard was built on top of this section of Jerusalem ravine to connect the two sides of town. On Garcia Moreno Street turn north and you will arrive to the Museo de la Ciudad, which provides an easy and interactive history of Quito. Then walk on Garcia Moreno street until Sucre, which is a pedestrian street. La Compania is at the corner and if you go up Sucre street you will reach San Francisco. If you continue on Garcia Moreno you will reach the Main (independence) Square. If you go to San Francisco, then walk to La Merced and down to the Main Square. This itinerary follows a chronological and logical sequence of sites. Most people do it backwards, turning La Ronda and Museo de la Ciudad as distant points where you're usually worn out by the time you get there. In any event, the Historic Center is so vast that you need more than one visit to see it all. The recommended walk provides you with a good overview if you're short of time or want to see as much as possible on a first day.

Stay safe

Crime
As in every big city tourists should take special care in certain areas. Generally at night, it is not recommended to walk around alone.

*Do not travel up El Panecillo on foot; use a taxi even during the day. Not only is the neighborhood bad, but the road leading up the hill has very narrow sidewalks, and sometimes no sidewalks at all. This presents a risk of being, at best, overwhelmed with diesel fumes as buses chub by, at worst, getting run over.

*At night, much of the main plazas of the Old Town are patrolled by police and well-lit, so it is fine for a stroll in a group at night. During the day, it is perfectly fine, bustling with locals, shopkeepers, hawkers and tourists, and well patrolled by police, especially at the main tourist attractions. Nevertheless, pickpocketing and purse snatching can be a problem, so take normal precautions. The plaza and doors of the San Francisco church, and the main trolley station near Plaza Domingo are particularly notorious areas for this. Pickpocketing is done by highly skilled groups of 3 or 4 people. You're best off not bringing a wallet at all--just some bills split between various pockets. Also, watch out for the buses and trollies while in old town. On many streets, sidewalks can be very narrow, so it is best to pay attention at all times so you can flatten against the wall and cover your face (diesel fumes!) if you need to let one pass, especially when the sidewalk is crowded.

*Parks among other areas can be unsafe at night so taxis are advised for even short distances. You should always book these by phone from a reputable company - so called 'express kidnappings' from hailed taxis are on the increase and hailing a taxi at night puts you at risk. Keep your belongings as close and as secure as possible, and if you feel in danger, duck into a bar or shop, and then call a taxi. Beware of credit card fraud, which is an increasingly serious problem in Quito as tourists are being targeted in the Mariscal area. 

*The area near Hospital Militar is quite dangerous, even in the late morning. The road "Solano" where Casa Bambu Hostel is situated is especially dangerous. Armed robberies have become more common. Men have been known to jump out of cars to target and physically threaten foreigners in order to steal their belongings. Although its views are amazing, exercise caution when walking to and from your accommodation. Taxis travel up and down this road frequently so if you can spare $1.50 to get into Mariscal Sucre Avenue, do so. Parks nearby are also dangerous. Perhaps walk around the parks instead of going through them.

*When buying bus tickets at the bus terminal, some companies, including "San Pedrito" will tell you a false price and overcharge you. Always check directly if the amount you paid matches the amount on the ticket they give you, ask locals for prices before if possible. If in doubt, contact the police which is around and often speaks basic English

Health 

- Travelers Diarrhea 
It's a common disease among travelers. It is caused by the different kind of bacteria in the environment. If you have the following symptoms:
 - Abdominal Pain 
 - Nausea
 - Vomiting
 - Fecal Urgency
 - Excessive gas/Flatulence
 - Feeling of need to pass stools without being able to do so 

You should contact the nearest health centre or visit www.diarrheaecuador.com where you may qualify for a Clinical Study and receive free treatment.

Due to the city's altitude (2.800m or 9186ft) altitude sickness is also something that travellers should be aware, especially the ones that come from or near the sea level. To eliminate the symptoms (dizzyness, difficulty in breathing etc.) you must travel in a city with lower altitude (1.500m or 4.921ft), stay at least one night there and then ascend to Quito.

Con artists
The main bus station is an area known to target travelers (foreigners or locals alike). You need to watch your bags closely, before departure, during departure, even once on the bus. It is best not even to put your luggage in the overhead shelving or under your own seat, as you can be easily distracted and have all your key possessions stolen before realizing it. Unfortunately you need to watch your bags on top of, or under the bus, at every stop until you arrive at your destination. There are two important sorts of scams that you may encounter on buses:

* One common one scam involves a thief impersonating bus staff (this can be easy because those of many companies have no uniforms) who will direct you to a seat and finding some excuse to ask you to put your bag in the overhead compartment or directly under your own seat where you cannot see it; an accomplice seated directly behind you will then slash open your bag and steal the belongings. Having the bag between your legs is not safe either as children are commonly used to climb down under the seat (from behind you), slash the bag, and remove belongings without you ever feeling a thing. Always have your bag on your lap.

* Another scam will often have an accomplice who will provide a distraction such as pretending to sell sweets before spilling them all over you, giving their friend the chance to steal your belongings. This can't be emphasised enough: never let your belongings out of sight. If something suspicious is happening like this on a bus, just refuse to co-operate and hold your belongings close to you. Robberies of this kind are common, particularly on buses leaving Quito. It is worth considering paying $3 or $4 more for a trip on a more high-class bus as these often have additional security measures, which can prevent robberies of tourists and locals alike. On city buses, it is best to not bring a backpack. If you absolutely have to bring one, wear it on your chest, not your back.

Another scam is someone spraying some mustard on your clothing. An accomplice will then say it's bird droppings and try to help clean your clothing but they will ask you to remove your camera or set your bag down. At this point, another accomplice will swoop in and take your belongings.

Finally, several neighborhoods located to the very north and south of the city are infamous among locals for having gang/delinquent trouble. "La Ferroviaria" to the south and "La Bota" to the north are specially notorious.

Wearing "gringo" clothes (fishing vests, travelers pants, bright colored t-shirts, dirty sandals) will make you a target. Ecuadorians in Quito generally dress conservatively; a pair of nice black pants or dark jeans and a non-descript white/off-white t-shirt will make you look a business person who knows his way around and not just another tourist posing as a Haight-Ashbury hippie.

Travelers in Quito are likely to be approached at some point or another by con artists, locals saying they are lost and need directions, or persons with "sob stories". Ignore such persons and be wary of anyone asking for money under any pretext, including begging children. If you feel charitable, Ecuador has lots of legitimate charities you can support, like the Red Cross.

If you have had something stolen from you, try taking a look in "Centro Commercial Montufar" (next to Terminal Marin on the Ecovia Red line), which is where many stolen items are sold on the blackmarket. Wise travellers will have their equipment serial numbers written down for safekeeping, which will help prove that the items are indeed yours. Quito police can assist in retrieving stolen items. Do not try to go alone, always have someone with you.

Drugs
Avoid associating at all with the drug trade in Ecuador. Ecuador has strict laws against possession, transportation and use of illegal drugs and foreigners caught transporting drugs at the airports have been sentenced to long prison terms. Unfortunately, any foreigner with an "alternative" or "hippie" appearance (such as men with long hair) may be assumed by some Ecuadorians to be looking for drugs. If you are approached about drugs in any context, it safe to assume the person approaching you is up to no good.

One exception is use of entheogens by indigenous people. Interest in ayahuasca is prompting increasing numbers of Americans and Europeans to travel to South America in order to partake in traditional ceremonies, and Ecuador is one such place. It is advisable to plan such a trip with a reliable guide before you travel there.

Police
All Ecuadorian citizens and visitors are required to carry ID at all times. If your stay in Ecuador is for a few months or longer, sooner or later, you will encounter a roadside police check and be requested to show ID. You can show your passport; however, carrying your passport around all the time is not advised due to the risk of loss or theft. A better option is to have a copy of your passport certified by your embassy and carry that. Students and long-term residents will be issued an Ecuadorian "censo" card that can also be carried in place of a passport for ID purposes. 

If you are the victim of a crime it is suggested you report it to the Ecuadorian National Police (by law, you must report within 72 hours of the incident), as well as to your home country embassy and to the South American Explorers Club. 

In 2009, two Visitor Safety Service offices were opened or revamped. Their job is to help with filling out forms, embassies and passports, etc. They have two vehicles for further assistance. Some staff speak English or other languages:

Corner of Roca y Reina Victoria, Edif. Relaciones Exteriores (Pasaportes)
Opening Times: 24 hours, 7 days a week.
Tel: (+593 2) 254-3983
ssturistica98@yahoo.com
Be prepared to offer English lessons as a "bribe."

Historic Centre
Plaza Grande (north side of the square on calle Chile, between Venezuela and García Moreno), Edif. Casa de los Alcaldes.
Opening Times: 24 hours, 7 days a week.
Tel: (+593 2) 295-5785
This office is known for its slow responses to crimes that are taking place; it is not uncommon to see locals yelling at these officers for not doing their jobs.

Contact

A good place to start is the Quito Visitors' Bureau It has several information centres around the city. These include at the International and Domestic Arrivals terminals at the airport; the Parque Gabriela Mistral in the Mariscal District (just north of Plaza Foch); the Banco Central Museum in the Masiscal District; and finally, in the Old Town, on the ground floor of the Palacio Municipal on one side of Plaza Grande - their main centre. 

The main centre includes helpful English-speaking staff, lockers for leaving bags, maps, leaflets and books for sale, a store of Ecuadorian crafts. This centre also offers free guided tours of the Old Town, where visitors only pay the admission fees to sights. The contacts for the main office are: (+593 2) 2570 - 786 / 2586 - 591, info@quito-turismo.com mailto:info@quito-turismo.com

The main iTur (national tourist information offices, is located in northern Quito, close to La Carolina park and El Jardin malls, to one side of the Ministry of Tourism, Av. Eloy Alfaro y Carlos Tobar.

As of June 2017 there are two locations where you can buy SIM cards at the airport. The first is the Claro store, and the second is the turquoise "travel SIM" booth, which looks a bit like a work of modern art. Both are on the second floor of the Airport Center building, which is located across the pedestrian bridge from the airport's departures hall.
* Claro is generally considered to have wider coverage, particularly outside of major cities, but more costly plans ($6 for 6 days and 400 MB of data). The Claro SIM costs ~$7, and does not come with a pre-loaded plan. 
* The "travel SIM" booth sells SIM cards from a mobile provider called Tuenti, which uses the Movistar network. These SIM cards cost $20 at the booth and include 1 week of service + 750MB. Tuenti plans are considerably cheaper than Claro ($5 for 1 week and 750 MB), with faster speeds in the cities, but Tuenti (and Movistar) offer less coverage outside of urban areas.
You can read more about Ecuadorian mobile providers here: The "travel SIM" booth was familiar with the process for registering a SIM card to a foreign passport, and the process took approximately 10-15 minutes. Movistar or Claro SIM cards can also be purchased at many stores throughout the city, though not all stores offering top-ups ("recargas") are able to sell SIM cards.

Get out
Quito is surrounded by a variety of places that could interest all kinds of tourists. A couple of hours on a bus ride is all it takes to reach them:

*To the North, all tourists should visit the province of , which has beautiful lakes such as Yaguarcocha and San Pablo. Hikers and mountain climbers can also ask for adventures in Cayambe National Park, home of the 3rd largest volcano in Ecuador. It's inactive. For tourists who want to shop a bit, they should take notice of the town of ; its indian market is famous worldwide for the quality and variety of products on sale. Don't forget to haggle for your preferred price!

*80 km to the north of Quito can be found the Maquipucuna Cloud Forest Reserve and Ecolodge, the closet pristine rainforest to Quito. This 6000 hectare (15,000 acre) reserve is home to 400+ species of birds, 50+ of mammals (including the famous Spectacled Bear), and 2000+ of plants, a spectacular display of Ecuador’s biodiversity. Accommodation on site is possible. 

*To the North West of Quito lies the region of Mindo, a subtropical rainforest paradise, full of rivers, majestic waterfalls, unique wildlife and more. The region is home to a variety of animal wildlife sanctuaries, and is famous locally and internationally because of its beauty. At a slightly higher altitude to is the Cloudforest. The variety of plants, birds and butterflies is wonderful. The guides carry good quality binoculars to help you spot some of the many varieties of birds. After each guided walk you can return to the lodge for meals. Near the main buildings there are many hummingbird feeders which attract many of the energetic and luminous birds. Accommodation is simple but very clean and pleasant with balconies from which you get beautiful views into the forest. You can visit the butterfly and humming bird farm too for about $3. The staff will show you around and explain to you in Spanish the life cycle of the butterflies (very worthwhile!) Landslides are known to occur on the roads to and from Mindo. Traffic can be held up for hours if this occurs. Trout (trucha in Spanish) is a specialty of Mindo and a dish of this should cost around $6. To get to Mindo from Quito, catch a taxi to Ofelia bus station ($5-6) and at the North bus terminal buy a ticket to Mindo for $2.50. The frequency of these buses differs between weekdays and weekends and travel guide times may be out of date. The earliest bus on a weekday is at 8am (13th April 2010). The bus trip is around 2 hours in length.

*To the east, lies which is a thermal water resort town. If you're into spas and relaxation, dipping into one of the natural hotwater pools for a couple of hours is a no brainer. The trucha (trout) dishes that are served here are also exquisite (~ $5.00).

Take a taxi to Cumbaya bus station (from Mariscal Sucre it should cost c. $8) and from there you can catch a bus ($2.50) to Papallacta. Just ask the buses that stop if they are going there. The bus will drop you in the centre of the town or on the main highway just a few minutes walk from the town (be sure to remind the driver to let you out!).

Another option is the Cooperativo Baños bus leaving from Tumbaco. They have a ticket office and bus stop (QJM2+3H Tumbaco, Ecuador), price to Papallacta is $3 (November 2019).

You can get on the back of a Ute by hailing it (with wooden seats) for about 50 c per person to get to the hot springs. Entry into the hot springs is about $7.00. Be careful with your belongings here. You can hire lockers (50 c per locker plus a $5 deposit) but staff advise that you leave your expensive valuables behind the counter. The choice is up to you.

*To the south, you can visit Cotopaxi National Park, Baños de Aguasanta which is another popular thermal water resort town, right beside Tungurahua Volcano. 

*To the west, just several short hours away lie the coastal provinces and their magnificent beaches. Buses to the provinces of Esmeraldas, Manabi, Guayas and the rest of the coast depart from Quitumbe terminal in the South of the city.

* Information about bus schedules and availability can fe found at AndesTransit

*By Train - There are trains to Latacunga from Thursdays to Sundays leaving at 08:00. The train makes a stop for breakfast and at Cotopaxi National Park. It arrives in Latacunga at 12:00 and heads back to Quito at 14:00, arriving there at 18:00. The price is $10 for the return trip. You can use it as an excursion from Quito or get off at Latacunga and travel on from there by bus.
