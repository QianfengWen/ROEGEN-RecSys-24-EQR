This article is about the island of Rhodes. For the city of the same name, capital of the island, see the separate article .

Rhodes is one of the largest and most fertile of the Greek Islands, and is one of the most visited because of its combination of beaches, archaeological sites, and extensive medieval town. The climate is particularly good, with the weather typically sunny and mild. The island is usually counted as one of the , but its importance for travelers is considered separately here. 

The rock-rose is so prolific here that it has been named the 'Island of Roses,' though modern scholars doubt the ancient theory that the island's name comes from the Greek word for rose. While the northern coast is renowned for its lively tourist resorts the south offers tranquil beaches and a slower, more simple pace of life.

Understand

Rhodes is a major tourist attraction for the seekers of sunny beaches. While many of its beaches are gravel, not sand; the island can boast 300+ sun days in a year. Consequently, you will stumble into tourists and hotels and beaches full of deck chairs for rent, into shops and restaurants that cater to these tourists. It can be overwhelming at times. If this bothers you, Rhodes is probably not for you. Still, there are some areas where mass tourism has not yet penetrated too much. And there are advantages too, accommodation on Rhodes itself can be purchased for relatively low prices, and most of the locals speak at least English and German and often some other languages, like Swedish, French, Turkish, Italian or even Finnish. Look for bays, beaches frequented by Greeks, and areas at or beyond Lindos. 

Rhodes has one of the longest and most splendid histories of any place in the world. Inhabited since Neolithic times, the island had important Bronze Age settlements, and at the dawn of the historical era was already famous for its three powerful cities of Lindos, Ialysos, and Kameiros, as mentioned in Homer. In 408 BCE these three cities joined to found the island's capital city, also called Rhodes. Rhodes city and island played a vigorous role in subsequent ancient Greek and Roman history, its most memorable episode doubtless being the prolonged siege of the city by Demetrios Poliokertes in 305 BCE. In Hellenistic times Rhodes became extremely prosperous through trade and was one of the most influential cultural centers of the Greek world. Later as a province of the Roman empire, Rhodes' influence declined, though it was still an important regional capital and was one of the earliest centers of Christianity. 

Rhodes later became part of the Byzantine Empire and from the 7th century on fell under the general eclipse of the Dark Ages. Later in the Middle Ages, Rhodes' importance again increased, as it came under the influence first of the Venetians, then of the Genoese, and finally of the Knights of Saint John, an organization of Crusaders who took over parts of Palestine but were later expelled by the Saracens and the Knights Templar and took refuge in Rhodes, wresting control of the island from the Genoese in 1306, ruling for two centuries, and building Rhodes once again into a major maritime power, until the island was conquered by Süleyman the Magnificent in 1523, becoming part of the Ottoman Empire.

The local tourist information office for the Dodecanese Islands is located in Rhodes city at Makariou & Papagou Corner (opposite the New Market). ☎ +30 2241 410 44335, +30 2241 410 44336, (Fax +30 2241 026955).

Talk

 is the native language of the people of Rhodes. However, due to the high level of tourism English, and to a lesser extent German, is likely to be spoken by most people the traveler comes into contact with. The local dialect can be described as a 'sing-song', with strong Turkish and Italian overtones. Many words used by Rodites (Rhodians) will not be readily understood by mainland Greeks.

Get around

By bus

All public bus lines radiate from Rhodes town and reach almost every relevant place throughout the island. 

The main bus terminal in Rhodes city is the Neá Agorá (New Market). Buses run by both companies stop there, but ticket booths, as well as timetables and prices, are distinct. Rhodes town lines are run by Roda, but have a separate stop, along Mandraki sea promenade, across the street from the new market. One interesting line is n° 5, which goes up to the Acropolis, price €1.

Tickets can also be bought on the bus from a cashier or directly from the driver. Keep your ticket until the end of your voyage. The price of a bus ticket will depend on the destination. For example, a trip from Rhodes city to Faliraki will cost €2.20.

Bus stops on the road are marked by a sign but do not hesitate to signal a bus driver that you wish to board. The buses are often very full and so remember to be actively moving backward in the buses. Sometimes the driver jumps out and peeks in from the middle door to urge tourists to move backward. Only part of the bus stops have the timetables displayed, and the buses are often late. Also, note that most villages and resorts have more than one line passing through and stopping in different places. For example, Faliraki has got three, one along the main street, one at the town center, and one right along the sea promenade. make sure your bus goes to your preferred stop, or you'll need to walk a bit.

Bus service timetable 

By taxi

Taxis on Rhodes are dark blue with white roofs. There is a list of expected maximum taxi charges you can obtain from the tourist information office. For example, a trip from Rhodes city to Faliraki should not cost more than €13; the trip from the Airport to Rhodes city a maximum of €16. The minimum fare for each trip is €4, the taximeter starts at €0.85. Never let the driver turn off the meter. Each suitcase will be also be charged, €0.50-0.60 each.

You can radio a taxi via telephone number ☎ +30 2241 069800. This adds a standard surcharge of €1.50. Waiting for fare is €7.90 per hr. Between midnight and 5 AM you will have to pay twice the normal rates. You can book ahead to avoid delays at high traffic times such as weekends.

Within Rhodes city limits, fixed rates are applied. If you get a taxi from one of the taxi stations or stop one in the street, the fare is €5. At the main taxi station, close to the New Market (Mandraki), there are hosts that try to cut down the waiting time by making sure that the taxis don't leave half-empty - especially if you are going a bit further. If you share a taxi within the Rhodes city limits the fare is €4.

By car

It is not worth the hassle to bring your own car to the island, although it is in theory possible. You can rent a car at the airport or via any hotel and at many local dealers. Local dealers are the best option for rending a car on the island, the services provided by some of the companies are outstanding!!! They can give you all the insider tips you will need so your road trips around will give you the possibility to discover all the natural beauties and enjoy your visits to the endless archaeological sites and places of interest on the island.
The prices especially at the start and the end of the summer start from 20 euros per day. 
Asphalt highways will allow you to reach the entire island, especially in the last couple of years the road system is improved a lot!
You have also the option to rent a car with a driver. There are also many local companies who offer this kind of service. Just notice that you need a pre-booking. The prices are similar to taxi ones and usually, this service is provided by travel agencies like Rhodes Airport Transfers, GREtour etc.

By boat

Explore the southern east Rhodes island by boat. Book a daily sea cruise or a private trip from Mandraki port, for visiting crystal clean waters and beaches like Lindos, which is the most popular in the island. Reaching the port you will find many available boats for your sea cruise. Ask for the price in their kiosk.

By motorcycle

Motorbikes and mopeds are popular alternatives to cars. Especially mopeds are frequently used by local youths and can go to many places that cars cannot go - for example, the twisted narrow streets of Rhodes city. An additional advantage is that they are cheap to rent - €10-15 a day is the usual price. 

If you start a day trip with a moped, make sure you do so on a full tank, as gas stations are sometimes hard to find. An extra stop at a gas station can save a lot of nerves. When renting a moped, check if the profile of the tires is ok and if the brakes work properly. If it is the last vehicle in store, be suspicious - it could be the one that needs a repair badly. Though helmets are not required on the streets, (although you might well be stopped and fines €50 if you are not wearing a helmet on the main roads) it might be a good idea to ask your rent-a-bike for one, especially if you intend to drive on streets with more traffic.

By chauffeur-driven car

Another option is to hire a car with a professional driver. This service become more and more popular and is not as expensive as you may believe. Costs are similar to taxi charges, the only difference is that you need to pre-book your private transfers or private tours.

See

* Asklipio Inland from Kiotari. In the little church, there are fascinating displays, honoring the continuity of the cult of healing from ancient times to a modern midwife and nurse. In Greek mythology, Asklepios was the son of the god Apollo who created the art of medicine.

* Cape Prasonisi. The southern-most tip of Rhodes. There is a peninsular connected to the main island by a sand bar. Unless you have a 4x4, think twice before driving your car across the sand bar. It becomes progressively less solid and it is easy to get stuck there in the sand.

* Castle with acropolis over Lindos

* Castle of Kastellos.

* Castle of Monolithos.

* Epta Piges. (Seven springs) and that is literally all there is to see there except for a short forest walking trail. In the hot summer months, the cool shade provides a pleasant respite from the sun.

* Filerimos Hill. Medieval remains a monastery and chapel. Good views over the north of the island.

* Kamiros. Ancient ruins.

* - Palace of the Prince Grand Master, Street of Knights, Fortifications.

* Tsambika Peak.

* Valley of the Butterflies. Since the butterflies - which are actually colored moths - in this area need quietude for their procreation and since the area is visited by many tourists, the population of the Petaloudes "butterflies" is constantly on the decline; even to a degree that it does not make any sense anymore to go there, as you will hardly see any of the moths. It is still a beautiful area regardless.

Do

* Sunbathing

* Swimming

* Snorkeling

* Diving 

* Surfing and Kitesurfing on the west coast and especially on the south end of the island

* Yachting 

*A wide selection of popular sailing yachts and catamarans for bareboat or skippered charters. 

* Many hotels will offer activity programs

* Most tour operators will offer excursions

* Climb Mt Attavyros. A challenging 2-3 hr climb to the island's highest point (1215 m). On leaving Embonas on the road towards Siana, drive up one of the agricultural roads on the left and find a place to park. On foot, you continue up through the wine-growing area in the obvious direction. There is no explicit marked path but red paint on rocks towards the top marks the best route. It is a steep climb with many large loose rocks. The descent can be especially tricky. It is also possible to drive up the mountain: the approach road comes from the South.

* Prasonisi Surfing and quiet unspoiled beaches distant from the main tourist areas. Lately, this coastal region beach is beginning to develop with new hotels and villas belonging to people from Rhodes. The sandy shore from Gennadi to Prasonisi is among the last unspoiled stretches of coastline left on Rhodes.

* Kamiros and Mt. Profitis Ilias

Beaches

There is a good variety of beaches on Rhodes. The east side of the island has almost continuous sandy beaches with calm waters. Beaches on the west are mostly stonier. The wind mostly comes in from the west and also the sea tends to be somewhat rougher to the west so that side of the island is better suited to surfing or kiteboarding.

* Rhodes Town.

* Lindos. The stunningly beautiful town beach on the bay. Very trendy, so wear your thong bikini here if you want to fit in. 

* Kalithea. Just north of Faliraki, this was originally an Italian-built spa. It is a very pleasant spot but can be crowded. Currently, building work is ongoing to build what looks like it will be a modern spa adjacent to the original buildings. A number of separate beaches, each seemingly with its own taverna lie just south of the spa.

* Faliraki. A long sandy beach with plenty of tavernas to choose from. There is also no shortage of people to rent jet skis from or to organize other activities. At the southern end, there is a quieter, more rocky beach but the sea there is inconveniently shallow for swimmers. The only legal nudist beach on the island which has excellent facilities including sunbed hire, toilets, and food and drink outlets is also found to the south of Faliraki.

* Ladiko Beach (Anthony Quinn Bay). This is a very scenic spot. On one side of the bay is a relatively small beach. The other side is rocky but a man-made platform provides further space for sunbathing and access to the sea.

* Afandou Beach .

* Kolymbia Beach.

* Tsambika Beach. On the far right of the beach near the rocks nude sunbathing is tolerated.

* Gennadi Beach. This area and nearby Prasonisi attract surfers. The village resort is peaceful and quiet. Virgin sands, hotels, and beach bars are a feature. Gennadi only began to be developed relatively recently. The main coastal road along the beach is developing with new hotels and villas belonging to people from Rhodes. Unexplored beaches stretch along the sandy shore from Gennadi to Prasonisi. This area is among the last unspoiled stretches of coastline left on the island.

* Agia Marina Beach.

Stay safe

Rhodes is a generally safe destination. There are a few things to look out for.

* In the early 2000s, the resort town of became infamous for the lewd behavior of young, drunk, mainly British partiers attracted to the cheap alcohol and large numbers of small nightclubs. A string of crimes committed by these young tourists against locals, as well as against other tourists, gained national attention in the summer of 2003; they ranged from vandalism to serious acts of violence. Following this, the local Police increased their presence to successful crackdown on such behavior - zero tolerance of bad behavior is now in place. Expect a night in the cells and some heavy-handed handling from the commando-trained officers. For families with young children, the best times to visit would be daytime even up to 10PM local time when the clubbers tend to come out en masse.

* Taxi drivers will sometimes turn off their meters and charge an arbitrary amount at the destination. Make sure they don't do this. Also, inquire after the approximate price.

Get out
* Daily excursions via boat to all the Dodecanese Islands (, , Halki, , , , Kastelorizo and other islands are offered from Rhodes city

* A ferry to in is also available
