Understand
Charlottesville is steeped in history and culture. Of the eight U.S. presidents who came from Virginia, two — Thomas Jefferson and James Monroe — were from Charlottesville, and two more came from neighboring counties. Central Virginia was a major battlefield during the Civil and Revolutionary Wars. Jefferson, whom locals affectionately call "Mr. Jefferson," or "TJ," continues to cast a long shadow, particularly over local architecture. Many of Charlottesville's public buildings are made of brick and built in a Jeffersonian style, and many private homes are colonial. His home at Monticello and the Jefferson-designed University of Virginia have set the tone for the communities beautiful buildings. When visiting Charlottesville, be sure to stop by the Albemarle Charlottesville Historical Society to learn more about the area's rich history. 

The culture of Charlottesville revolves around two points: the University of Virginia and the Historic Downtown Mall. Charlottesville is a major cultural center for central Virginia, and features more fine dining, shopping, and entertainment than one might expect for a town of its size. Ensconced in beautiful Albemarle County, Charlottesville is also surrounded by vineyards and horse country - the best of all worlds.

Get in
By plane
Charlottesville Albemarle Airport, (). The closest airport to Charlottesville. This airport is approximately 10 miles from downtown, so a rental car (Avis, Hertz, or National), taxi, or hotel courtesy shuttle is required. It is often more economical to fly into Washington Dulles () or Richmond (). Richmond is 80 miles away and Dulles is over 100 miles away. Rental cars are available at each and the drive to Charlottesville is straightforward.

By train
Amtrak Charlottesville is on the Cardinal, Crescent, and Northeast Regional routes. Two or three northbound and two or three southbound trains stop in Charlottesville each day (the number depends on the day). The station is on West Main Street, about halfway between the Downtown Mall and the University (3/4 mile to each), but within walking distance of several restaurants. Plan to call for taxi service or take the CTS bus or trolley if you are not walking.

By car
The major highways leading into Charlottesville are US-29 and I-64. I-64 is a four-lane interstate leading to Charlottesville from east and west. There is rarely traffic on I-64 near Charlottesville, and the only major hill is crossing Afton Mountain, about 30 minutes west of town. US-29 is an extremely variable road. To the south, it is a four-lane road with frequent curves and at-grade crossings, but few traffic lights. To the north, the road alternates between being a four-lane commercial center with frequent traffic lights and buisnesses and being more similar to US-29 south of town. Traffic on US-29 north of town can be slow or dense at rush hour and around special events in Charlottesville, but speeds below 25mph are rare.

Travel times from nearby cities are:
* , about 45 minutes.
* , a little over an hour.
* , between 2 and 2.5 hours. The trip is approximately 110 miles.
* , about 2 hours.

By bus
Greyhound, The bus station is on West Main Street, about two blocks east of the Amtrak station. If you are traveling to or from Washington, DC, the train is generally faster, cleaner, and more comfortable than the bus.

Get around

University of Virginia
The Central Grounds area is very walkable, but some areas of campus (called "Grounds" by students) can be over a mile away. Getting around the University of Virginia is easy using the free University Transit System (UTS) buses. From the University to the downtown mall is a walk of 20-30 minutes and there is a free trolley bus that runs in a loop from the University to the Downtown Mall approximately every 20 minutes. 

It is not easy to find parking around the University area. If you are primarily visiting Grounds, there is a parking garage at the University Bookstore, on Emmet Street, that only fills up during certain University events (e.g., Days on the Lawn). If you would like to be closer to the "Corner," a strip of restaurants and shops at the edge of campus, there is a parking garage at the intersection of 14th Street and Wertland Street, as well as a quirky parking lot (even featured in its own documentary "The Parking Lot") immediately behind the Corner with an entrance beside a restaurant called Little John's.

City of Charlottesville
The city is reasonably well connected by city buses, the Charlottesville Area Transit (CAT). Parking in nearly all areas of the city is free and easy to find. Parking at the Downtown Mall will often require paying a modest rate at a lot or parking garage.

Surrounding Area
Transportation outside of the city is best accomplished by car, although taxi or certain buses may be available for some locations. Main roads are well signed and in good repair, but can be hilly and curvy. If traveling to a unusual location or taking a shortcut through smaller country roads, be prepared for unpaved roads, limited signs, and frequent curves.

Taxis
With the possible exceptions of the airport, the University of Virginia "corner" area and the Downtown Mall, you must call for taxi service in Charlottesville. There are several taxi companies in the city. During common travel times there are also plenty of Uber drivers available.
