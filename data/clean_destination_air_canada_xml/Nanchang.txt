Nanchang (南昌; Nánchāng) is the capital of Province and is the cultural, economic and scientific center of Jiangxi. 

Understand
With deep historical ties, known as Heroes' City because it was here that the communist uprising of 1 August 1927 began.

Get in
Nanchang Airport has regular connections from many Chinese cities.
It has also a few international flights from Singapore, Taipei, Chiang Mai and other Asian cities.
International flights arrive and depart at the small Terminal 1.
Terminal 1 is not a 24hr terminal. It opens at approximately 6.30am, so if you arrive early during winter, be prepared to stand out in the cold for a while. The airport is also not heated during winter time. As of Jan 2019, there are no shops and F&B establishments present in the international terminal.
You go through a luggage scan first before proceeding to the check-in counters. Thereafter, proceed to the customs immigration counters and later, the more thorough security screening stations.

Not all international flights park near the terminals with aerobridge access. Shenzhen Airlines flight from Singapore parks on the tarmac, requiring passengers to descend via stairs to the ground and be transported to the terminals via bus. This is also the case during winter months.

Get around
Taxis and buses are the most popular ways of getting around, bus journeys being &yen;1 regardless of distance traveled (&yen;2 for the doubledecker buses). The taxi fare in Nanchang is also cheap compared to other cities in China with same scale and the initial starting price for a ride on taxi is &yen;6 up to 2 kilometers. Beyond this mandatory starting-price-region, the rate is &yen;1.9 per kilometer. It should also be noted that the taxi fare has an additional 20% surcharge in the nocturnal time period between 11:00pm and 5:00am to compensate for the low demand at night. However you will probably find that during peak times both buses/taxis are nearly impossible, at which point either walking or cycling are the only options (there is nowhere to rent bikes in Nanchang).

Metro was opened at December 2015 (Line 1). Number of stations 24 (2015). Length 28.7 km. Line 2 was opened in August 2017, with 28 stations and a length of 31.51km (2019).

If visiting during the summer a bicycle is a good investment, at &yen;110 from WalMart beside Bayi Square. Just like other typical Chinese cities, there are many cycle lanes covering the entire city, busy nearly all the time.

Eat
*Small European style restaurant in the heart of Nanchang. Serving European bistro fare in relaxed environment. Friendly English speaking service staff. Popular with ex-pats and locals alike.

*Very nice Italian restaurant. It is like something that you would expect in Shanghai or Beijing. Very nice Italian style pizzas without the Shanghai price. They serve nice pastas and charcoal grilled steaks and fish. Popular with the ex-pats and locals alike. They offer a non-smoking dining room with smoking area around the bar. It has the largest selection of cocktail in Nanchang.

*Great local food. Very popular with locals, so you know you're getting a great feed. While there's no English menu, there's a big picture menu on the wall which they'll ask you to point to, while they take your order. Prices are excellent for the quality (e.g. 25RMB for duck). 

*European style restaurant situated in Wanda Plaza. Suitable for foreigners. 

*Understand that Nanchang cuisine (and Jiangxi food in general) can be quite spicy. Some specialties include a clay pot soup called waguan tang (瓦罐汤), one of the few foods that isn't spicy at all, and Nanchang ban fen (南昌拌粉), a local type of fried vermicelli. An excellent place to try a wide variety of local street food is the night food street close to Jiangxi Normal University of Science and Technology (江西科技师范) in Honggutan on Yuping Road (玉屏西大街). Facing away from the school towards KFC, walk one block right.

Drink
There seem to be two main areas for drinking. On the main walking street in the upscale apartment complex there are 3-4 bars and a few clubs, all of which are hopping on the weekends. Another area is found around fuzhou road, there is VV club, and CD 1925. 

*Interesting bar/club with multiple floors and clubbing rooms.

*Interesting bar that has four different rooms laid out like a labyrinth. If you are drunk it makes for a terribly confusing night.

*A friendly western style bar serving all the usual beers and some imported beers and larger, cocktails by the dozen and real western bar snacks, the ones you are missing while your here in China. Open lunch time to late.

*A German owned Bar.

Sleep
* Five star hotel with four star hotel prices. Large rooms with free internet. Do not forget to try the pool and sauna.

* There are two hotels by this English name on the same short stretch of the street. Five star Jiangxi Binguan (江西宾馆) is better than four star Jiangxi Fandian (江西饭店), which probably gets its four star rating from facilities that it keeps permanently closed. Jiangxi Binguan is famous as one of the top ten architectures in Nanchang. Jiangxi Fandian was established in 1961, and although renovated in 2004, feels like it was renovated to 1960's standards. 
* The Gloria Plaza Hotel Nanchang (Kailai Dafandian) is strategically located in the city center, just 25 minutes from the airport, 12 minutes from the railway station and within walking distance from major commercial complexes.
The hotel's 328 rooms and suites are all tastefully furnished and outfitted with individually controlled air-conditioning, satellite television, internet data port, international direct-dial telephone, mini-bar, in-room safe and hair-dryer.
