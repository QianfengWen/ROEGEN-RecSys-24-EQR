Amritsar (ਅੰਮ੍ਰਿਤਸਰ) is a holy city in the state of in .

Understand
The name of the city derives from the name of the pool around the Golden Temple (also known as Harmandir Sahib) and means "holy pool of nectar" (Amrit: elixir; Sar: (short for sarovar) lake). It is the spiritual and cultural center of the Sikh religion, and they are proud of the city and the beautiful and unique Gurdwara (place of worship). The Golden Temple was initiated by Guru Ramdaas Ji, the fourth Sikh Guru, and completed in 1601 by his successor Guru Arjan Dev Ji. It is now a major pilgrimage and tourism hub.

Climate
Amritsar has a semi-arid climate typical of northwestern and northeastern . It has 5 seasons, winter, a period from mid-February to the end of March called "spring", a very hot summer (April-June), the monsoon season (July-September), and a so-called "autumn" from mid-October to mid-November. Amritsar is 3rd coldest city in India during winter time. Temperatures at night are around 4°C (40°F), which is very cold by Indian standards, and it is actually 3°C (6°F) lower than the city of more than 200km to the north. This happens partly due to the northeasterly winds blowing from the Himalayas, which also affects the rest of northern India, and partly due to its semi-arid nature. Temperatures reach the freezing point almost every year and the record low is -3.5°C (25.7°F). Snow is impossible as cold weather is accompanied by dry conditions. In spite of its cold nights though days can be quite pleasant with afternoon highs reaching 21°C (70°F) consistently. In mid-March is usually when the first 30°C (86°F), although sometimes it can occur much earlier. The heat is blistering during this time of the year and reaches its peak in June when the average high is 40°C (104°F). Therefore visitors should be wary of heat strokes and stay hydrated. When the monsoon arrives in July, the heat changes from blistering to sweltering. This is regarded as the worst time of the year to visit northwestern India as temperatures around 32°C (90°F) and 
very high humidity (77%) make the atmosphere unbearable for most tourists and locals alike. When autumn arrives, it is regarded as a cool welcome by the citizens of the city before winter begins again. Therefore, the best time of the year to visit the city is either February or November. If you intend to visit from March to October consider visiting early when the humidity isn't very high.

Get in

The best time to visit Amritsar is in the winter, between October and March. 

By plane
 Sri Guru Ram Das Jee International Airport () is about 11km and a 15-20 minutes drive from the city center. It's one of the modern airports in India and quite adequate if not exactly exciting. Most flights are to , an hour away, but there are an increasing number of international connections: Air India flies to , , and via . Air Slovakia used to fly to , , and via but the flights have been discontinued since the airline ceased operations in 2010. There are also surprising numbers of flights to (eg. , and ). Qatar Airways now flies to . Airasia and Malindo Air offer flights to and to besides daily flights to by Air India Express and Spicejet. Besides, there are daily connections to and .

According to the airport website, both city buses and car rentals are available. Buses are limited and only during daylight hours (OCT 2022)

Even the prepaid taxi can be bargained down with the drivers from an initially ridiculous price of ₹600=700 a person (OCT 2022) before you pay, but there is a significant dearth of official taxis or even auto-rickshaws, so prepare for a hard time. UBER is available, but rates are only slightly cheaper, and you may be required to pay the 40 parking fee and pay via cash. 

If you would prefer an auto-rickshaw instead of an expensive taxi, go left after leaving the airport building. There is a roundabout behind the parking lot where they are standing.

Also, be aware that if you are staying near the Golden Temple, there is a zone around it that prohibits motorized vehicles. Though not stringently applied, the streets do get very narrow, and you may have to make the last ten minutes of the trip on foot.

By train
Amritsar (IR station code: ASR) is an important railway station and is well connected to major cities in India through daily trains.
Trains can be booked online, at the train station, or, most conveniently, at the small booking office in the Golden Temple Complex (located next to Guru Ram Das Sarai).

It's advisable to book your return train ticket as soon as you arrive in Amritsar, or before if you know the exact date, as trains are often heavily booked.

When you are back at the railway station make sure you're dropped on the right side of the station. Suppose you have a train from Platform No 1, then the rickshaw driver has to cross the bridge and come across the other part of the station, otherwise, they will drop you at their convenient place and you have to cross the footbridge with all your baggage.

By Taxi
* 
* 
* 

From Pakistan

From , taxis or auto-rickshaws bring you to the first checkpoint, which is another 1km walk to the immigration office. For a cheaper fare, you could take the Metro Orange Line to the last stop at Dera Gujran, before taking an auto-rickshaw from there (~Rs500, 25min).

The border is open 10am-4pm daily (Indian-time). Allow at least 2h to cross both immigration checkpoints, as the Pakistani side often has no immigration officers on hand, and there is a mandatory shuttle bus on the Indian side (leaving only when relatively full). Note that there is a 30min time difference between India and Pakistan. The border is your last chance to change Pakistani rupees into Indian rupees; money changers in Amritsar do not accept Pakistani currency.

Once on the Indian side, you could catch an auto-rickshaw or cycle-rickshaw 2km to Attari (~₹50), where buses leave for the main bus stand at Amritsar (₹40, 50min, every 30min).

Taxis also use this route and charge around ₹500 for the entire vehicle.

Get around
* An auto-rickshaw from the train station to the temple should cost around INR 150-200, while a cycle-rickshaw will run about INR50.

* There is a free bus service from the train station to the golden temple run by Golden Temple trust. It drops you right at the accommodation booking office of the Golden Temple where you can get a double bedroom for INR1000/500 per day. However, this service is on a rudimentary bus vehicle and very crowded, really only intended for locals and the poor who cannot afford transportation. So you are encouraged to just afford a rickshaw or taxi for Rs - 150 - 200 from the station to the Golden Temple.

*Ambarsari Zaika. People here engage themselves in the various food shops and stalls that offer the choicest of Amritsari and Punjabi cuisine along with some other eatery options as well. 
*Bungalow – Ancient Warfare museum. The grand building of the Anglo Sikh Bunglow has now been converted into an Ancient Warfare museum and today has several replicas of instruments and attires of warfare. It has many real, lifelike figurines that are so realistic they seem they would come alive if touched.
*Durgiana Mandir & Bada Hanuman mandir (Languran wala Mandir). Although Durgiana Temple is a Hindu temple, its architecture is similar to the Golden Temple of Sikh religion. It is located near Hathi gate and near the railway station. It is visited by Lord Rama Himself. Bada Hanuman Mandir is situated near its premises. An annual function at this ancient 'Bara Hanuman Mandir' starts with the beginning of navratras. There are people from far-off places, even from abroad who visit this temple during this festival.

*Jallianwala Bagh (Garden) is a short 5-minute walk from the Golden Temple and is the site of the 1919 Amritsar massacre. On 13 April of that year, British Indian Army soldiers opened fire on an unarmed gathering of men, women, and children. The firing lasted about 10 minutes and 1650 rounds were fired, killing 1579 people. A memorial was built on the site and inaugurated by the then-President of India, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, on 13 April 1961. to this day bullet holes can be seen on the walls and adjoining buildings. The well into which many people jumped and drowned attempting to save themselves from the hail of bullets is also a protected monument inside the park. It also includes 4 galleries at different locations where old pictures and further details on the Jallianwala Bagh incident is given.
*Mata Temple is a labyrinthine-like Hindu cave temple devoted to the female saint Lal Devi. Traditionally, women wishing to become pregnant come here to pray. The roundabout path to the main temple passes through low tunnels, caves full of ankle-deep water, inclined walkways, and mirrored hallways that make the experience seem more like a fun house than a place of worship. The colors, wide variety of deities, and elaborate mirrored image make this a psychedelically unique temple. Highly recommended! This is called Sheesh Mahal, and some people also seem to call it "Lal Devi."
*Partition Museum - The Partition of India was one of the most defining events in India’s history. It was also the largest migration in human history, with some estimates suggesting that approximately 18 million people were directly impacted. The Partition Museum, initiated by The Arts and Cultural Heritage Trust (TAACHT), has been set up as a People's Museum to remember all those millions who lost their homes or loved ones at that time. It is located at the Town Hall in Amritsar, a 10-minute walk from the Golden Temple. The focus of the Museum is to take the visitors on a journey into the lives of those who lost so much at Partition, with the aid of multiple different mediums, including, oral histories playing on video, a soundscape in each gallery, original artifacts donated by refugees, newspapers, and magazines, photographs showing the migration and camps, letters written by refugees, government documents, and especially created art installations. The museum is open from 10 am to 6 pm, Tuesday to Sunday.

There's a lot to be seen, heard, and read there, however, photography is not allowed.
*Ram Tirth is a short distance of 11km outside the city. Consecrated by the appearance of Devi Sita, Ram Tirth had been a witness to the birth of the sons of King Rama. Making a special place in the holy scripts of ancient religions, the place was once the ashrama of saint Valmiki. The saint is believed to have scripted many of his sacred manuscripts at this place. A hut of Rishi Balmiki is still found at Ram Tirth where he once lived. After giving birth to Luv and Kush, Devi Sita used to stay at this place for a considerable period of time. The evidence of her stay still exists in the form of a well which, it is believed, was dug by Hanuman. Devotees of King Rama and Devi Sita flock to this place every year to offer their prayers to the respected deities. As the locational position of the Ram Tirth is facilitated by easy accessibility, hence, visitors conveniently reach this place of worship without any extra hassles.

Golden Temple

The Golden Temple is the main attraction in the city and the most important religious place to the Sikhs. It's a stunning complex, and always full of thousands of pilgrims from all over India, excited to be at a place that they usually only see on television. The excitement to be here is infectious, and many people will be more than happy to tell you all about their religion and customs and show you around the temple itself. Cover your head, remove your shoes and wander around one of the most amazing places in India. The complex is open almost 24 hours (06:00-02:00 the next day) and is worth visiting twice: once during the day, and once at night, when it's beautifully lit up.

As you arrive near the complex, you will more likely than not be accosted by hawkers trying to sell you bandanna's to cover your head. It's not a bad souvenir for INR10, but there's also a big barrel of free ones to choose from at the entrance itself. Deposit your shoes at the subterranean building to the left of the entrance, wash your feet at the entrance, and head in.
* Akal Takht, directly opposite the Harmandir Sahib. Meaning "The Timeless", this is where the highest council of Sikhs sits and deliberates. At night, the Guru Granth Sahib is taken to the Akal Takht.
* Amrit Sarovar. The giant pool of water surrounds and reflects the Golden Temple. Sections (marked off by ropes) are set aside for male pilgrims wishing to bathe. For female pilgrims, there is a separate bathhouse enclosing a small part of the pool.
* Central Sikh Museum, 2nd floor (entrance on the right side of the main side of the main entrance). Devoted to a large gallery of paintings, mostly showing the gruesome ways countless Sikhs have been martyred, and various knick-knacks from the gurus. Free. All Sikhs are expected at some point in their lives to volunteer for a week at the temple, and everyone you see working here is fulfilling that duty. It's likely possible that you can join in if you feel so inclined - you could enquire by asking the people outside peeling vegetables, or those washing dishes.
* Ghanta Ghar. This is the main entrance, sporting a distinctly Victorian clock tower. Wash your feet in the water at the entrance in order to keep the temple clean. 
* Harmandir Sahib. This is the Golden Temple itself, floating above the Amrit Sarovar, housing the sacred Adi Granth scripture which is recited out loud during the day. This is the most crowded point, accessible by a bridge from the edge of the pool, and entry here is regulated by traditionally dressed Sikh guards. It's a 2-story structure where Sikh saints are seated on each floor.

Do

*Bicycle tour, City On Pedals is the only company that provides bicycle tours of the city which is a great way to get to off-the-beaten paths, hidden gems, street food and have a sneak peek into the lives of the locals. Bicycle tours are a great way to get acquainted with the city's history, food, heritage, and architecture. Having a local guide/storyteller can be very useful as there are places and food that normally travelers don't get to experience by themselves. Many other tour companies also include delicious street food with breakfast/dinner on their tour.

Servers come by with large buckets of dahl, chapati and rice. Make sure to finish everything on your plate (wasting food isn't an option here!) then take it outside to volunteers at the washing area. It's inside the complex which means no shoes and covering your head. At the exit, there is a donation box, in case you want to voluntarily donate for the cause of free meals.

* Moolchand Fish Shop, Off of GT Road near Tourist Guesthouse. Find the Christchurch Cathedral (large red-and-green church, pretty conspicuous!) and keep walking, away from GT road. In about 2 minutes, you'll see a little shop selling fish. Open 08:00-23:00. This tiny place is the definition of hole-in-the-wall. If it looks like it has been there for 50 years, it's because it has! They'll weigh out your fish based on how much you want to pay, fry it, put some delicious spices on it, and serve it with spicy green chutney and raw onions. A little hard to find, but it worth it. About 50 rupees for a good-sized piece of fish, and 70 rupees for a serving of chicken.

Sleep

Budget
* Free accommodation for pilgrims and tourists in very basic dorms or 3-bed rooms in Guru Ram Das Niwas, behind the temple. You should remain quiet and respectful of the surroundings, keeping in mind that this is a holy place of pilgrimage more than a tourist attraction. Alcohol and smoking are strictly forbidden, not only within the temple complex but anywhere within sight of the temple complex. If you can handle that, then this is arguably the best place to stay - watching people go about their routine, talking to the pilgrims, and absorbing the gorgeous atmosphere. Put your donations in the donation box near the entrance to Ram Das Niwas, as opposed to the guards who may ask you for it when checking out.
The temple also offers neat rooms (AC 500Rs, non-AC 200Rs) in a multitude of dedicated houses, but these are, due to alleged "problems" in the past, reserved for Indian citizens only - a plead in the general information office might qualify you for an exception, but do not count on it. An important thing to keep in mind, if you're a solo male traveler you won't be given any accommodation. You can stow your luggage for a day here for free though.

The tensions of the 1980s are just a sad memory and Amritsar is currently a safe and welcoming city but a little polluted.

Respect
* You should remain aware and respectful of the Sikh religion anywhere near the Golden Temple complex.

* Inside the complex, both men and women are required to cover their heads (scarves are widely available throughout the town for INR10, or a box of them is free to use at the entrances to the temple).

* Smoking and alcohol are forbidden within the complex and anywhere within sight of the temple. Lighting up a cigarette on the busy street out front will definitely attract negative attention, as will spitting near the temple.

* Photography is allowed on the outside ring of the holy lake, but not inside the actual temple itself.

See the for details. Do not bring any bags if you go there. But if you do there are luggage storage guys on the roadside who you can pay, but better to just leave it all at home (except the camera, wallets, and passport).

Taxis leave from a stand nearby the Golden Temple. Facing the main entrance of the complex (by the shoe storage), go left and follow the street until you come upon the prepaid taxi stand and the temple's free bus service stand. The prepaid taxi stand is legitimate and run by the Golden Temple Beautification Project. Avoid taxi agents and just go to this prepaid stand. It costs 120 rs. per person. It's a 45-minute ride and should leave Amritsar by around 2:30PM. Easy, no hassle, you'll get a receipt and all the information you might need.

Taxi drivers demand Rs. 1500 for the entire trip (for 4 seater cars. Larger cars cost more around 1800 )however it can be brought down to 1400/1300 at a bargain. Shared taxis(8-10 seater) can cost around 200 per person.

Hiring an auto-rickshaw can cost about 350 per person and for a shared auto, it takes about 150 per person.

If taking a ride, not from the prepaid stand, make sure you check the vehicle before paying. Offer a deposit and ask if you can pay the rest on your return. Also, beware of agents that will take your money and ask you to wait "only 15 minutes we will move", but go slowly. They can take approx. 2 hrs. to move from Amritsar. Don't pay first! Board in the taxi and ask them to move immediately, otherwise, you will miss the chance of watching the border closing, as it will be crowded and you will have to stand far from the border to see things, and you can miss the chance of dancing, walking with the flag or a photo with BSF personnel. 

As of Oct, 2022 there was also a HOP ON HOP OFF bus that provides a round trip to the border from the traffic circle containing the Statue of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, located approx 500 meters northeast of the Golden Temple. Round trip fare is only 315 rupee and leaves each day at 230pm. Return is around 715pm. The bus was air-conditioned in the lower layer and seems like a great value. 

March starts only at 6pm, but entry gates open at 3:30pm. To get a seat in front one must reach between 3:30- 4pm. 
It is advised to leave the venue a little before the entire program ends(preferably after flags are brought down) so that you can escape a huge traffic jam, sometimes as far as Amritsar. There is a special place on the bleachers for foreigners and is closer to the border gates than most seats. You may need your passport to prove you are a foreigner.

* &ndash; armed with a visa, take the plunge into this bustling gateway city, one of the cultural hubs of 

* is accessible by a bus + bus or train + bus combo. One must catch a train or bus to Pathankot first, then another bus to Dharamshala/McLeod Ganj. The train can run late (by hours!) so the bus is a better option for getting to Pathankot in a timely manner. The bus from Amritsar to Pathankot is 110 rs. 3hrs, the bus from Pathankot to Dharamshala is 120 rs. 4hrs. Another bus can take you to McLeod Ganj for 14 rs. 15-20 minutes.
