Morelia is the capital of the state of and is one of the most beautiful cities in . It is a registered UNESCO World Heritage site featuring a consistent colonial style. It is not really on the well-trodden path of the leisure tourists and so you can walk around in comfort without the fear of the Bermuda shorts crowds. There are at least two "information" booths in the area of the square. They are staffed with multilingual students who are very helpful.

Understand

Morelia is the capital city of . It serves the government and many students attending school there and is the halfway point between Mexico's two largest cities, making it a popular quick getaway for Mexico's urban population. This means the central business district is very clean with plenty of places to eat and shop and there is a weekly firework display. English tourists are not as common here as in some other areas of Mexico, so you may want to load up on pesos before ordering food or trying to make a purchase, as foreign currency is not widely accepted. There are money changer stalls on the side streets off of the square.

It has a decent climate, nice parks to relax in, lots of places to get stuff, and a very nice place overall. Named after revolutionary leader Jose Morelos, you can visit his home here or climb a giant statue of him in nearby Pátzcuaro. Morelia also serves as an excellent base for a day trip to the Monarch Butterfly Reserves. Staying downtown is preferable, as most of the attractions like the Cathedral, the square, museums, and shopping, are all pretty much within walking distance. The People are very friendly. In the central business district, drivers may use their horns 24hrs a day to give notice at the numerous blind intersections. You will get used to it but request a room away from the street.

Morelia is more than just the Centro Historico. Its outlying areas feature modern housing developments, shopping centers, and parks. Tres Marias and Bosque Monarcas are ultra-modern new cities adjacent to Morelia.

Get in

By plane
Morelia is served by General Francisco Mujica International Airport (MLM) which is located in the municipality of Álvaro Obregón (approximately 27km / 17 miles northeast of Morelia's historic Centro.) The airport is served by the following airlines: Aeromexico, Viva Aerobus, Aeromexico Connect, Transportes Aeromar, Volaris, United Airlines, and American Airlines. Daily international flights are available from/to Los Angeles, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, and Chicago, as well as commuter flights from Guadalajara, Mexico City, Monterrey, and Tijuana.

The airport has four arrival/departure gates. In the terminal, there is a Sunglass Hut kiosk, a coffee stand, and a small convenience store. A duty-free/gift shop and restaurant are available only after passing through security for departing flights.

Free WIFI is available throughout the terminal.

There are a number of ways to get from the airport into the historic center:

Taxi
An authorized taxi into the city in 2022 costs approximately $415 pesos ($21 USD) for up to 4 passengers and suitcases that fit inside the trunk. Going to the city center takes about 20–40 minutes, depending on traffic. You may be asked if you prefer the local road or the highway: while the route via the local road is slightly cheaper, the highway route is faster but slightly more expensive to account for the tolls incurred (your fare will include all tolls.) You must purchase a ticket for the taxi within the terminal (major credit cards accepted) and take the ticket to the taxi area. 

Uber
Uber drivers are permitted to pick up travelers at the terminal. The fare is approximately $150–170 pesos ($7.50–$8.50 USD) at the current (2022) exchange rate.

Rental Car
Counters for rental car companies are available within the terminal for Budget, Hertz, Sixt Rent a Car and Firefly. Highway 140 is the local road to the historic center, while Highway 480 is the modern toll road.

By bus
Deluxe buses serve Morelia from all parts of the Republic, and Morelia's state-of-the-art bus station is located in the northwestern part of the city. The bus station consists of separate terminals for first-class and second-class buses. It is easy to reach Morelia from either Mexico City or Guadalajara. The bus trip from Guadalajara is about 3-1/2 hours. From Mexico City, most buses leave from Observatorio. Travel times vary from 4-6 hours. You can also reach Morelia from the United States by way of Greyhound.

The Ruta Roja combis will get you from the bus station to the Centro Historico for 10 pesos. As you exit the bus station terminal, walk to the main entrance and then left to a structure that looks like (and is) a bus stop. Be aware that the combis are generally small minivans so if you've got a bit of luggage a taxi will be easier. Taxis should cost around 80 - 90 pesos to get to Centro Historico (as of December 2019). Uber serves the bus terminal as well, usually costing about half the fare of a taxi.

By car
Morelia is accessible by a modern toll road and is located equidistant from Guadalajara and Mexico City. There are plenty of newer Pemex stations along the way, with restrooms and food. Be prepared with change/pesos to pay tolls. It is a very scenic trip, to say the least.

Get around

Buses, combis, and taxis form Morelia’s public transport.

Combis are an affordable method to get around the city, sometimes taking you onto smaller roads and backstreets of the city. Various destinations are usually indicated on the windshield of these mini-vans. As of March 2022, a ride within the city costs 10 pesos. Get in, grab a handle and sit down before the driver speeds off, and then give your money directly to the driver, or to someone else to pass to the driver for you (you can ask the person “Si no le molesta, por favor”, basically, “Please, if you don’t mind”). Above your head, you will find a buzzer to get out at the next corner, or you can simply ask “en la próxima esquina, por favor” (next corner please). It is very common for people to greet other passengers when boarding, according to the time of day (“Buenos días”, “buenas tardes” or “buenas noches”). The RutaDirecta site displays interactive route maps for all combis.

Taxis are also plentiful and inexpensive, operating on zone fares. As elsewhere in Mexico, make sure to determine the price before getting into the taxi. 

Driving in the City is not easy, but with patience, you can. Drivers use their horns to excess, to prod others, and at the numerous blind intersections. The Centro Histórico is plagued by a lack of parking. Driving in and around Morelia differs little from driving in any urban area. However, there is an “uno y uno” protocol in place. Drivers are actually quite respectful and obey this “one and one” rule, where — in stark contrast to Mexico City — at an intersection, you do not simply charge into any space larger than 5 cm, but fall into line, with one vehicle at a time from each direction driving through the intersection.

See
There are a lot of interesting and beautiful colonial buildings to see in Morelia; most of them are open to the public for at least part of the day. Highlights of a Morelia city tour will include:

* Aqueduct, Av Acueducto 1464, Chapultepec Nte., 58260 Morelia, Mich. Running down the center of Avenida Acueducto is an enormous aqueduct built in the 17th century to bring water into the budding young city. 
* Benito Juarez Zoological Park (Parque Zoológico Benito Juárez), Calz. Juárez S/N, Félix Ireta, 58070 Morelia, Mich., It is a 620-acre urban oasis that is home to a 75-acre lake and a large and diverse collection of animals, including everything from polar bears to monkeys. Kids love it! Admission costs 12 pesos for adults and 6 for kids. Open 7 days a week. 
* Casa Natal de Morelos and Casa de Morelos: Hero of the Mexican War for Independence, native son Jose Maria Morelos y Pavon, was born, raised, and lived his life in Morelia. There are two Morelos homes in the city, and both are historical museums that chronicle Morelos and his role in shaping Mexico. 
* Cathedral: One of the downtown highlights is the baroque cathedral with its surrounding gardens and parks. The cathedral is enormous, covering more than 2 city blocks in the area. Architectural details like the flying buttresses and tiled cupolas give it a distinctive look. The cathedral is the site for the local “Day of the Dead” celebration in early November. It is more of an experience than can be described here. Most of the activities take place after dark, make sure you have a good seat around the square at dark for the outside performance of the choir and the fireworks each night.
* Monument to Lazaro Cardenas (Monumento a Lázaro Cárdenas0.
* Planetarium (Planetario de Morelia), Calzada Ventura Puente y, Perif. Paseo de la República S/N, 58070 Morelia, Mich., ph.+52 4433142465.
* Santuario de Guadalupe. One of the most serenely beautiful churches in Mexico, adorned in soft pink and white with gold trim, the church is a work of art in itself. It also houses a series of 17th-century oil paintings that ideologically depict the Spanish missionaries’ conquest of the “barbaric” religious traditions of the Aztecs.

Do

* Listen to a concert by the Morelia Boys Choir at the spectacular Conservatory of the Roses. The group is modeled on the Vienna Boys Choir, and their director is a former maestro from Vienna.
* 
* 
* Campamento vecinos Bosques Camelinas.
* 

Events
* 
* Visit the Santuario de Guadalupe (also known as the Templo San Diego) between the last week of November and December 12. For two weeks, Mexico celebrates the Virgin of Guadalupe, and Morelia's celebration is a classic!

Buy
Casa de Artesanias is located on Plaza San Francisco. Reserve your shopping until you visit there, this is where the local artists display their wares. 

The Mercado de Dulces was created about thirty years ago, and it features candy as well as inexpensive souvenirs. The Museo de Dulces, located on Av. Madero between the Cathedral and the Tarascan Fountain is definitely worth a stop. More than just a museum, it contains a coffee shop and offers the widest variety of candies as well as demonstrations of candy-making.

Eat
Morelia is one of the most exciting places in Mexico for innovative yet traditionally based cuisine. Avoid chain restaurants in Morelia because the wealth of outstanding restaurants not only offer unique regional flavors found nowhere else in Mexico, they are shockingly affordable for the quality they deliver.

Regional dishes unique to Morelia and surrounding Michoacan include:
* Enchiladas Morelianas: Enchiladas in Morelia are nothing like enchiladas in any other part of Mexico. In Morelia, they’re based on chicken and potatoes, but they explode with rich flavor from a slow, deep-seated chile spiciness and deep red color that comes from the careful use of guajilla chile.
* Sopa Tarasca: Smoothly pureed bean soup base spiced with piquant dried chiles and swirled with a touch of slightly soured creme mexicana, it’s a bean soup that will change the way you think of bean soup. Similar to Sopa Azteca.

If you're looking for a great panaderia (bakeries that generally serve sweet bread and pastries), go to Horno Los Ortiz, in Centro Historico and a bit further down the main drag beyond the Aqueduct. For special occasions eg Dia de Muertos and Christmas, a display window is set up inside with works of art all made of bread. 

Budget
Some chains like Subway and Burger King are present on the square and throughout the city, for those who prefer to avoid culinary adventure. The dining room on the 3rd floor above the department store on the square is interesting to visit and has very good food. In the tourist and historic center, many restaurants may have an English menu available. Be prepared to pay in pesos.
* It serves some of the region’s best carnitas, which are adored throughout Mexico but have their origin in Michoacán state.
* Mexico offers authentic Japanese dishes in a simple, cozy restaurant.
* They offer a great range of salsas to accompany your quesadillas, tacos, alambre (massive meat overdose for the hardcore travelers only!). Their chipotle and avocado salsas are awesome. The hard-to-find vegetarian alambre is a nice vegetarian option when you are tired of quesadillas, but theirs, made with mushrooms, peppers, pineapple, and optional cheese, is fairly bland. Here they serve flour, not corn, tortillas. Wireless available.

Mid-Range

Outdoor patio dining under the city’s historic portals is casual, fun, and affordable, with many options to choose from. But there are also some great places just a short distance away.
* It is hands-down the best Asian restaurant in town. Featuring dishes from Japan, China, Thailand, Vietnam, and more, this rooftop spot has a menu you won’t find anywhere else.
* It is another excellent choice for authentic Italian cuisine in Morelia. Located near the Las Americas shopping mall, it’s worth the trip from Centro. Some evenings offer mellow live music.
* It serves imaginative and delicious fare under the eye of chef/owner Eddie Alvarez. This lovely second-floor space, located in the Chapultepec neighborhood, is your reason for exploring beyond the historic center.
* It is the spot when you’re especially craving authentic Tuscan food. Exceptional food with an impressive wine list.
* It has several locations around the city, but the store on Ventura Puente (Calz. Ventura Puente 1044) is the mothership, with an enormous selection of bread and pastries, a restaurant in the back, and a gourmet food/wine store. Absolutely the best baked goods in all the city.
* It is an extraordinary feast for the eye and the palate. The eclectic decor features a room devoted to Saint Anthony, where hundreds of images of San Antonio appear upside down. Tradition says that praying to San Antonio will bring you, love. (It worked for me!) The extensive menu is filled with delicious options, with an excellent cocktail menu.
* It is one of Mexico’s great department stores, with locations throughout the country. The restaurant at Sanborn’s features dishes from across Mexico at reasonable prices. The location in Centro is on the third floor of the store, in an elegant 19th-century dining room. Sanborn’s is reported to have invented enchiladas suizas…this is a great place to order them! Calle Portal Galeana No. 171, Centro histórico.
* It is a charming Italian trattoria right in the heart of Centro. Pasta dishes are excellent here, with a great selection of salads.

Splurge
* It is one of the most elegant and sophisticated dining rooms in the city. It is dramatic and romantic with an atmosphere of 16th-century colonial grace punctuated by 21st-century touches. The cuisine is nouveau Mexican, blending traditional elements harkening back to the pre-Colombian era with international influences to create a fusion that is nothing short of culinary orgasm. You can experience master culinary craftsmanship in this restaurant for no more money than buying a steak at an Outback. Who would ever eat in chain restaurants in Morelia?
* It is located on the third floor of the Hotel Casa Grande, in the SW corner of Plaza de Armas. Incredible views, superior service, and an extensive menu make this a truly special spot.
* It is located on the third floor of the Hotel Los Juaninos in the NE corner of Plaza Melchor Ocampo. With stunning views of the Cathedral and plaza below, the restaurant features contemporary Michoacana dishes.
* A lovely restaurant with excellent service that serves modern takes on traditional dishes from Michoacán. Enjoy the outdoor tables under the Portales just to the south of the Plaza de Armas, or dine inside the handsome dining room. (Ask to be seated in the stunning “jungle” room that features a hand-painted mural on all four walls.)
* An elegant steakhouse in the upscale neighborhood of Camelinas. The restaurant uses only certified Angus beef, cooked to perfection. The service is attentive yet friendly, and no detail is overlooked. Even the bread is spectacular at Las Trojes — delicately crispy baguettes accompanied by a spicy bean and herb spread.

Drink

Get out
Morelia is an excellent gateway city for cultural and outdoor adventures throughout the state of Michoacan. 
* . The quaint, tranquil, artistic town of Patzcuaro is an easy 1-hour bus ride from Morelia. It is worth spending quite a bit of time getting to know. It is the center of Mexico's "Day of the Dead" tradition and is one of the great centers for finding authentic popular art pieces.
