Heraklion (Greek Ηράκλειον, also transliterated as Heraklio, Iraklion or Irakleio) is the major city and capital of the largest island of . Its Archaeological Museum holds the remains of the 3000-year old Minoan civilization, which grew around the nearby legendary palace of Knossos (of Minotaur fame), as well as Byzantine churches and a well-preserved wall and fortress from the 15th century.

Understand
Heraklion (or Herakleion, Iraklio, Irakleion) is the capital of Crete and an industrialised city of around 225.000 residents. The modern city is densely populated and traffic choked, at first overwhelming the visitor. However, in recent years, things have begun to change and efforts are being made to bring out the beauty of the city's rich cultural history. Strolling along the coastline, the city wall, or down a park can reveal various historical remains of potentially immense interest to the watchful eye. The knowledgeable visitor will be able to trace the past under the urban sprawl of the present. The core of the city is still enclosed and defined by the Venetian wall, which includes seven outjutting bastions. In the southernmost of these, the Martinengo Bastion, is the grave of Nikos Kazantzakis standing on a windswept hilltop with its moving inscription, "I hope for nothing. I fear nothing. I am free."

Climate
Heraklion has a Mediterranean climate. Summers are hot and dry with clear skies. Dry hot days are often relieved by a system of seasonal breezes. Winters are mild with relatively little rain and rare frosts.

Get in
Located in the middle of the island, all roads lead to Heraklion. Heraklion has a busy harbour and very busy airport and usually is the starting point of travels to Crete and nearby islands.

By plane
Heraklion airport website There are daily flights from airport and other major Greek cities by Olympic Air and Aegean Airlines The recently established Athens Airways also connect Heraklion with Athens. During summer, Sky Express flies to several Aegean islands.

From April till early November charter airlines fly directly to Heraklion from many European airports.

By bus
Heraklion is connected with the rest of Crete by regular bus lines operated by two KTEL companies The coaches are modern, comfortable and air-conditioned. Fare is reasonable.

There are two bus stations in Heraklion:
* The main station used by lines to/from other prefectures (Chania, Rethymno, Lasithi) and lines to the eastern part of Heraklion prefecture.
* Used mainly by lines to/from the southern part of Heraklion prefecture.

By boat
There are ferries from:
*Athens (): Minoan Lines , Anek Lines and Superfast Ferries 
* and - G.A. Ferries 
*: G.A. Ferries Sea Jets and Hellenic Seaways The frequency is reduced in the winter.
* 

By car
The only solution is to arrive to one of the big ports of Crete (Heraklion, Chania, Sitia or Rethymnon).
Then you have to hire a car, if you have not done it yet. Remember that you need a written authorization of the car rental company to travel with the car in a ferry.

Beware of street parking in Heraklion. Non-parking areas are not clearly marked, and you will be fined as much as €80. Think of it as a tourist tax. Better to park your car in one of the paid parking lots.

Get around

By bus
You can use the public city bus network to get around Heraklion, but you have to figure out the line to your destination. Online schedules state the departure time from the start of the route, usually the airport or port, and differ for summer and winter Almost all buses pass through the centre (except line 21 and the Knossos Express). Buses are numbered according to the destination, and so are different for outbound and return. There are usually no routes or schedules posted at the bus stops.
* Line 1 goes to the airport.
* Line 2 goes to Knossos.
* Line 6 goes to Amoudara.
* Line 20 goes to the port.

Tickets can be bought from kiosks and small shops, and from automated machines at select bus stops. They can sometimes be bought on the bus at a higher price. There are two zones: the inner zone A includes the centre, the port, and the airport; the outer zone B includes Knossos and Amoudara. Zone A tickets (orange) cost €1,20 (€2,00 on the bus) and zone B tickets (blue) cost €1,70 (€2,50 on the bus). The Knossos Express between Amoudara and Knossos costs €5,00. There is also a one-day ticket for €5,00. For transfers from one bus line to another, separate tickets are needed.

Buses do not stop at bus stops, unless you signal the driver by raising your arm. When you get on the bus, hold the bottom half of your ticket in your right hand. The bus driver will grab the top half (side with number value of ticket) and the two of you will rip it in half.

Knossos (Greek Κνωσός, the accent is on the second syllable) is the site of the most important and best known Minoan palace complex in Crete. It is located some 5 km (3 mi) south of Heraklion. According to tradition, Knossos was the seat of the legendary Cretan king Minos. The Palace is also connected with further legends, such as the myth of the Labyrinth and the Minotaur, as well as the story of Daidalos and Ikaros. Excavation has revealed that the site was continuously inhabited from the Neolithic period (7000-3000 B.C.) until Roman times.

Highlights include statues of the Snake Goddess, the famous Bull-Leaping Fresco, the enigmatic and mysterious Phaistos Disk, and Minoan seals and jewelery. Also includes a number of finds from Classical Greek and Roman periods. The Heraklion Archaeological Museum is one of the world's great museums, embodying a whole splendid vanished culture. At least two hours should be allowed to see it, and it could easily take longer. For those seriously interested in that culture, it will be worth while to make two visits to the museum, one before, and one after, visiting Knossos and other Minoan sites: seeing the museum first will enhance your understanding of the sites, and after seeing the sites, you'll be better able to understand the artifacts in the museum when you return.

Eat

Budget

Throughout most of the downtown, it is easy to find cheap tavernas (ταβερνα) offering full meals for under €20 for two people (eating alone in Crete would be a bizarre affair.) There are many tavernas on the Western end of the waterfront which offer a great view out over the water, and back towards the Venetian fort. "Thalassinos Kosmos" (Leoforos Sofokli Venizelou 11) is on the far western end: don't be suprised if you are greeted with a kiss, and brought a free dessert at the end of your meal. 
A strict budget can be met bu sticking to the supermarkets which provide the usual array of fruits, vegetables and cheese for modest prices (€5/day is quite feasible.)
Definitely don't feel the need to avoid the downtown cafes, who will offer the local breakfast treat bougatsa, a local pastry with cottage cheese, served with honey, or cinnamon and sugar.
Also available are the usual complement of pastry shops for standard meals such as spanakopita (spinach pie) and various cheap deserts.

Mid-range
* Heraklion Sailing Club(: Istioploikos or Ιστιοπλοϊκός) Heraklion Harbour Tel: +30 2810 22 8118. Classic seafood restaurant facing the Venetian Castle. Specialities include charcoal grilled fish, seafood salads, clams, and the award winning mussel risotto. Located in the former premises of the port refrigeration plant, east of the Port Authority. Sailing Club membership is not required for the restaurant.

* Pagopieion (Ice-Factory) is a "quirky", very different restaurant and cafe/bar, at St Titus square, by the church. You can sit outside and enjoy the setting, or you might be tempted by the dramatic decor to sit inside. Either way, the food is excellent, the menu different and interesting - Mediterranean with a twist. Good fish too.

* Herb's Garden (The Roof Garden of Lato Boutique Hotel) The name has been inspired from the traditional Cretan herbs. Stylish, yet intimate and casual. Offers a spectacular view to Heraklion’s Venetian fortress and Cretan Sea. Opens from early afternoon and serves fresh fish, seasonal salads and fine delicatessens accompanied by local aperitifs like ouzo and raki and a variety of fine wines. Later in the afternoon there is special coffee and tea arrangements, fresh fruit juices, great ice cream, summer cocktails and drinks. 

Drink

* Tsikoudia, also known as Raki, is the the trademark of Cretan day and night life, a strong clear drink similar to Grappa in Italy or Orujo in Spain. It is made out of the 'must' of grape skins and twigs after the local production of the white wine. It doesn't taste like aniseed, as opposed to the Turkish raki. Most raki is 80 proof, about the strength of most vodkas, but some are much stronger. It's often served in small glasses after dinner with a plate of fruit or other dessert.
*Cretan Wine: Try the distinctive Cretan wine, produced in the island for at least 4000 years. Labels: Sitia, Peza Union. The Cretans themselves drink so called 'open' wine, straight out of the barrel, like fresh white wine, and the sometimes very old dark rusty red wine, a bit like port. Typical Cretan wine varieties are Marouvas and Kotsifali (both red wines).
*Sweets, crepes, waffles, ice cream.

Sleep

Budget
There are two hostels in Heraklion. Both are situated in the city centre, only a 10 minute drive from the airport and a 5 minute drive from the port. One can go there by taxi. The taxi fare from the airport to the hostels at the city centre should cost less than €10, and from the port less than €6.

*Seriously, read the online reviews before booking. Not for the faint hearted. Fairly disgusting hostel.

* An excellent family run hotel in Karteros, about 7km outside Heraklion. (On bus route with hourly buses.) A great base for exploring the island either as a stop over as it’s 10 minutes drive from the airport. It has its own pool and is located only 200m from a long sandy beach. Prices and opening depending on season.
