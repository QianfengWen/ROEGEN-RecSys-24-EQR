Jinan (济南 Jǐnán) is the provincial capital of in the . It is located in the North-West of the province. In the South the city is flanked by the hills of The massif, while the passes North of the city.

Jinan carries the nickname City of Springs (泉城 quánchéng) because of the many artesian wells that bubble up within the city limits. The water from these springs flows North towards the main landmark, Daming Lake (大明湖 dàmíng hú), and onwards to the Yellow River.

While it doesn't always make the short list of tourists visiting China, there is certainly enough to be done in Jinan to warrant a couple of days stay. You can visit the best parks and springs in a day trip from . It is also a perfect base for exploring the region, notably , the hometown of Confucius, and , the foremost of the sacred known in Taoism.

Understand

History
The Yellow River basin was China's cultural centre during the Neolithic period, and so it comes as no surprise that the area around present day Jinan has been inhabited for over 4,000 years. The oldest finds in the region are from the Longshan culture, a Late Neolithic culture noted for its advanced black 'egg-shell pottery', sometimes as thin as a millimetre. 

Fast forward past the Shang and Zhou dynasty. After the fall of the Zhou dynasty many independent states arose during a time known as the Spring and Autumn period. Eventually only a handful remained, striving for power during the Warring States period. During this era Jinan lay on the border of the state of Qi and the state of Lu. The great wall of Qi, to the East of Jinan, is a remnant of this age. It is the oldest Great Wall in China, and portions are accessible as open air museum. Lu (鲁） on the other hand was the home state of Confucius, and the character is still used as abbreviation for Shandong.

It was during the Han dynasty that Jinan became an important economic and cultural hub, and its role only became more prominent during the following dynasties. Some well known poets, painters and even a Han dynasty ruler all called Jinan their home.

Two events which both connected Jinan to the outside world in a new way spurred development and brought Jinan firmly into the modern age. The first was a natural evolution. In 1852 the Yellow River shifted it course, moving to the bedding of the Ji river from which Jinan derives its name. The Yellow River, being connected to the Grand Canal, now connected Jinan both to the Imperial capital in the North, and to agricultural areas in the South.

By the end of the 19th century the Germany Empire had established a concession in Qingdao on the Shandong coast, and a similar German area was built in what is now the area around the train station. The Germans built a railway connecting Jinan and Qingdao, this however was met with strong local resistance, which eventually led to the anti-foreign Boxer Rebellion. Despite all this the railway was opened for traffic in 1904, opening up Jinan to foreign trade.

Climate
Jinan is located in the North China Plain and has a temperate climate.

The heat and moisture can be crushing in the summer when the breeze doesn't get down in the basin. Infamously hot and humid in summer.

The Air quality is getting better now but still severe. Please try to avoid the hazy days.

Get in
Jinan is the hub of traffic for the region and province so you'll likely end up here if heading elsewhere in Shandong, notably and . Most people will arrive by bus or train.

By plane
You can fly to Jinan, but the airport (济南遥墙国际机场) is located 40km northeast of downtown. A taxi will take an hour and cost about &yen;100 (foreigners might be asked to pay a higher fixed price or be taken on a detour). There is a shuttle bus between the airport and Jinan's Central Railway Station that runs hourly from 06:00 to 18:00. There is also a shuttle bus between the airport and Jinan's downtown area (with its final stop being the Simpson Hotel) which also runs after 18:00. Both shuttle buses each cost ¥20. A subroute of bus 16 also goes to the airport.

You can find flights from most major cities with Shandong Airlines being the major carrier. (Shandong Airlines code-shares with Air China, so your ticket and check-in may well say Air China.)

By train
For the train, you will likely arrive at Jinan train station （济南站） in the centre of the city. You will also probably arrive at Jinan East, about 15km from the downtown, or Jinan West, about 20km further away.

Jinan is on the major line from to so you can take the train. With the new China High Speed Rail train that runs from Beijing to Shanghai and stops in Jinan, the trip from Beijing to Jinan takes about 1.5 hours and the trip from Shanghai to Jinan takes approx. 3.5 hours. The CRH train stops at the Jinan West train station （济南西站） all the way on the western outskirts of the city. A taxi ride from there to center of city will take you over 30 minutes and there are also various bus routes which will take longer. 

Other fast trains from Beijing go to Jinan main station. There's plenty of transport choices outside: bus 83 stops nearby to take you downtown to more options, K51 takes you to Quancheng Square and Thousand Buddha Mountain.

In 2018, Jinan East train station （济南东站） opened. The trip from to Jinan takes only about 2 hours.

Using a slow train it's about five hours from Beijing and nine from , but the tickets are much cheaper. 

Several travel agencies around the city sell train tickets for an additional &yen;5.

By bus
It is very easy to get to Jinan with lots of buses running all day and some at night. Be sure to ask which station the bus will arrive in as there are two main ones, the long distance bus station (长途汽车站) and the train station bus station (客运汽车站).

By car
Several expressways (G2, G20, G35) connect to Jinan.

Get around

First thing you have to consider is, do you really need to take the bus? Taxis are the easiest options. Other options are various motorcycles, and other vehicles that are either unsigned or a bit flimsy-looking. These are hard to use as you have to negotiate not only the destination, but also the fare.

By bus
Buses are often overcrowded. Still, if you are interested in traveling as the locals do, hop on.

Buses are &yen;1, or &yen;2 for air-conditioned. Buses that begin with K are supposedly air-conditioned and even if the a/c is off or not working, you are likely to get a seat on these buses as they are much less crowded than the &yen;1 (no a/c) buses. It should be noted though, that a line either is a K-line or not, same lines don't have K buses and non K buses operating on them, so mostly it is not possible to prefer either type without some walking being involved.

Most busses with two digits serve the central city. Three digit ones are either coming from or going to the suburbs. Bus stops are easily identifiable and bus numbers are written in the Western numbers both on the busses and at the bus stops. The lists of stops for a given route are posted at every bus stop, but in Chinese only, although the beginning and end stations are written in pinyin.

By taxi
Taxis drivers rarely speak English, and they will often not be able to read maps or your destination in letters. So to be certain to reach your destination, make sure you have it written out in Chinese. Price for shorter trips from &yen;7.50. It can be difficult to get a taxi between 07:30-08:30 and 17:00-19:00.

You can also call a taxi on the taxi hailing app "Didi" (滴滴出行).

By metro
Line 1 (济南地铁一号线) runs north-south in the western part of the city linked to Jinan West Railway Station. Unless you plan to go to the University town in Changqing (长清) or Fangte amusement park （方特东方神话主题乐园）, metro is totally useless during the trip. Line 2 and Line 3 is under construction now. 

By bicycle
The bicycle-sharing system (共享单车) is very developed in Jinan. You can easily find a red bicycle (mobike) through Wechat app or a blue bicycle (hellobike) by using Alipay app. Don't forget to lock the bicycle after riding it.

See

*Good for a climb and a stroll. On weekends it's overcrowded so choose a weekday.

Also nearby is the Jinan Hero Mountain Culture Square, a shopping area known as the "Culture Market" (see below under Markets).

*Ji'nan northeast side there is a Hua mountain, Huashan. Jin Xingding for four years, Jin Zhen taught master disciple of Qiu Chuji Chen Zhiyuan in the south to build Huayang palace, later known as" Lixia scenic spots"," Ji'nan macro".
Springs

Jinan has 72 springs and is famous for them from ancient times. However, nowadays some of them do not have much water.

* Has several temples and pavilions. Especially beautiful late in the afternoon, when the locals come to hang out with their feet in the river. Avoid at weekends or Chinese holidays, when it is impossibly noisy and crowded.
 
* Sounding like the roar of a tiger gurgles out through three carved tiger heads into the city moat. Many people takes clear spring water from this spring. The liberation Pavilion (解放阁) and Kuanghouli Food Street (宽厚里小吃街) are also nearby.
 
* It has a very deep pool of spring water and a few natural springs. Very tranquil park with lush greens and ancient Chinese architecture. It also has a temple for a Tang Dynasty army general Qin Qiong who was living in Jinan. In summer, people can walk on the stone tiled floor with spring water flowing on them and kids can have water fights. Beautiful and relaxed place even during Chinese holidays.

* There are many springs locate on the old city, such as Pearl Spring (珍珠泉), Zhuoying Spring (濯缨泉), and Tengjiao Spring (腾蛟泉). 

The famous entry of the old city is Qushuiting Street (曲水亭街), which locates on the South of the South Gate of Daming Lake Park. On the East side of the Qushuiting Street, theHundred Flower Pond (百花洲) is a hot tourist attraction for local people. (You can go to the east bank of Hundred Flower Pond to explore the spring culture of Jinan City) The old alleys in Jinan on the South of Qushuiting Street as the core area of Jinan Old City. You can experience what the late-Qing author Liu E describes Jinan's cityscape "Every family has spring water, every household has a willow tree" in the Old City. The streets and alleys are very complicated in this area, so please use Openstreetmap or Bing map to prevent getting lost. After exploring the Old City, you can go to Quancheng Road (泉城路) through Water Lily Street (芙蓉街).

Museums
* Sometimes has travelling exhibits of interest. Check out the calendar dating from 134 BC, and bronzes from the Shang and Zhou eras (1766-770 BC).
 
* Or just browse the interminable shiny floored shopping malls, such as the Silver Plaza next to the Hotel Sofitel, near the Square, and marvel at the new wealth of this emerging powerful nation.

Other
*Large park with pagodas, temples and an amusement park. The largest Taoist temple in Jinan is located here as well as a temple in memorial of some local official. Also large natural lake formed from a number of springs and with a large fountain. There are boats for rent. Nice landscaping with willow trees and lotus flowers. Festivals and exhibitions take place in the park. Paid (30RMB) is only western and northern half of lake, which is much more crowded and more noisy than nice, relaxed and free (!) eastern and southern bank of lake, it's tourist scam (one would expect less tourists in paid section and not opposite) and avoid visiting paid section and enjoy relaxed beautiful eastern and southern part, there are also tons of overpriced street stands in paid section with double/triple prices of ice cream/drinks.

* A small hill (with many steps) you can climb to view the smog haze and overlook the city itself on clearer days. Allow about half an hour to reach the top. Features temples, caves, pavilions, terraces, towers, and er Buddhas. On the eastern side of mountain stands the Shandong Revolutionary Martyrs Cemetery for Revolution of 1911, a key historical relic site under provincial protection. Other scenic spots on the Mountain include the Tang-Dynasty Pagoda Tree Pavilion, Shandong Nine Clouds, and Cloud Passing Zen Temple, etc. If you prefer a bus ride, then you can go by bus to the top of the mountain along a mountain road winding up the eastern side of the mountain. A ski lift system and a slide also operate on the mountain, so if the Buddhas get boring, you can always slide down the mountain.

* 
A great place to go any weeknight, and observe why China has relatively few obese people. 
You can join people dancing, playing many sports, writing poetry (calligraphy) with water, etc. Bring umbrella/cap during daytime since there is missing almost any green in square. In the centre of the square is an underground supermarket and McDonald's and other shops.

Further away
* Beautiful area which is always in a splendour of color in the fall. Red Leaf valley is a private park which encompasses mountains and lakes of great beauty, as well as a rare bird sanctuary. However, getting there is next to impossible without being fluent in Mandarin or having a Chinese translator due to the obscure address of the bus service and the weird rule of having to buy your tickets one day in advance. If traveling by car even a fluent Mandarin speaker may have difficulty in understanding directions: the local dialect is impenetrable! the address to followed to reach Red leaves valley.
 
* A series of small but cool Buddhist grottoes and scripture carved directly into the side of mountains and cliffs. To access it, you literally have to climb through a short cave system, so bring flashlights. The area is under development and you are unlikely to run into people other than maybe some construction workers. A great opportunity to get up close and personal with ancient carvings. The downside is that the area is difficult to access, as the options are to either drive 2 hours around a mountain or 20 minutes through a military base (the latter being the better option for those with connections). 
 
* It's an old-fashioned zoo with cement cages. There is a new panda that they got in Feb. 2013. Tickets ¥25.
 
* 
 
* 
 
* Portions of The Great Wall of Qi is located in eastern Shandong Province, a world heritage site and the predecessor of the more famous Great Wall in northern China. Built between 770 BCE and 476 BCE in the ancient state of Qi (modern Shandong), the Great Wall of Qi is the oldest Great Wall in China. It originated in a small village in Changqing County, with passes, gates, castles and beacon towers along a total length of 620 kilometres and terminated on the seashore at Qingdao. 
 
* Boasts the Jinan Wild Life World forest safari park and is first class even in Asia."
 
* Peaks, pavilions, terraces, bridges, including the fascinatingly named Fairy-Greeting Bridge.
 
* Constructed in 611AD (Sui Dynasty) with Buddha, and 1000 year old pine tree.
 
* Founded about 1,600 years ago and "one of the Four Scenic Spots of Temple in the World". Pavilions, bridges, halls, ponds, terraces, Buddhas, stone tablets, caves. The attractions include "One Line of Sky, Double Pine Bridge, and other grotesque spots like Spring on Mirror Pond.

Do
* Includes a mediocre foreign languages section (mostly old classic novels and dictionaries). The management seems to tolerate the thousands of non-customers, using it as a reading room. It is well worth a visit - Borders could learn a thing or two!

* At night you can watch kids compete in in-line skating, kung fu, or other competitions. Lots of people hang out there so prepare to be stared at, as Jinan residents do not often see foreigners. If you are not comfortable to be the center of attention maybe it is best to avoid this spot.
* Spring City Park was formerly called the Botanical Gardens. It's quite shady, with a lake and lots of places to sit and relax or have a picnic, so it's a very good place to visit during the hot Jinan summer. It also has a small amusement park at the west end.

* Leafy, serene, and pleasant to stroll, especially the Medical University. Avoid the weekends. After 2000, Shandong Medical University had been merged into Shandong University, named as Shandong University Baotu Springs Campus.
*One of the most popular activities among the young Chinese. Dong Fang Zhi Yun (used to be called Top Party) on Wen Hua Xi Lu (Culture W St) is a big karaoke bar which includes a pretty decent buffet. Large rooms can accommodate up to 30 people.
*
*Yuan Yuan Yuan on Luo Wen Road (near Quancheng Sq) has food and drinks. It provides poker cards, Ma Jiang and board games, etc. There might even be Wi-fi in there. 
If you are after traditional Chinese tea houses, there are some more traditional looking ones scattered around. They are more popular among business people for the quietness. Tea can be served in traditional Chinese ritual.
*A large park with a monument to the soldiers, who fought the Japanese in the mid 20th century. There's a military museum here that's free. The museum has some English signage and a guidebook with English explanations.

Buy

*Many glasses outlets in the market. It caters for both wholesale and retail customers. Very good place to get a pair or two of prescription glasses, sunglasses and contact lenses. Much much cheaper than the big stores in the city.

Clothes
For clothes make your way over to Shanshi East Road (山师东路 shānshī dōng lù). There you will find a handful of adjoining buildings each full with tiny stores, and tiny aisles between them. It might be hard to find something here to satisfy a western taste, but at least you pay Chinese prices.

For much more upmarket shopping experience head over to a newly developed area called Parc 66 (恒隆广场, Hang Lung Plaza), sitting on the Quancheng Road(泉城路). This shopping mall is the biggest and best shopping all in the Jinan. 

You can also find some local styled clothes in Quanlefang (泉乐坊) on the Xianxi Xiang( 县西巷) locates on the east of Hundred Flower Pool. Spread over three levels with streaming water and elevated walkways, this open air shopping complex provides a great afternoon strolling opportunity. Note that prices are what you would pay in Europe, so don't come here looking for a bargain. But window shoppers might be happy to know there is also some delicious food to be had, Italian ice cream, chocolate cake, a Chinese renowned tattooist (does not speak English) and even a reasonably priced Japanese restaurant.

Daily supplies
For daily supplies, food, clothing, and stuff like that try one of the following. There is little in the way of western food but you may be pleasantly surprised.

* 

* 

* More or less the Whole Foods of China. Pricey, but lots of international foods and sundries. They accept major international credit cards.

* Lots of international products and food. They also accept Visa or Master credit cards.

* 

* Caters for the culturally deprived expat who wants his cornflakes.

* Tesco Supermarket which is located at the Wanda Plaza Shopping Mall.

Markets
* There are markets in several locations, but you're likely only to find plastic tubs, brooms, hair products, bed sheets, clothing, etc., that's pretty much the same as what you find in the shops or just on the street at about the same prices. Make sure to bring your bargaining skills, especially being a foreigner.

* Ask a cab to drop you off at 'Wen hwa shr chang'. The actual market is a pedestrian only area behind a row of houses, but you should be able to find it by just following the crowds. On sale are all kinds of items, pottery, wooden sculptures, painting, calligraphy supplies, even old coins, notes and stamps. During the week it's usually pretty quiet, so come during weekends, when much more is on offer. This is a great place to find small souvenirs. Some of it is said to be real antique, but don't be fooled in spending top dollar. Unless you bring, or consider yourself, an expert.
When you get tired of shopping head to nearby Hero mountain for a change of scenery.

* The stretch of road on Shanda South Rd between Jiefang Rd and Shanda Rd houses several big stores catering for all your technological needs. You will even find people sitting on the side of the road selling second hand motherboards and hard drives! For some products you might get a good deal compared to your home country, for others prices are pretty much the same. Make sure to compare several dealers and then haggle to get the best price.

Eat

Shandong cuisine is known as Lu cai (named after the ancient Lu State) and is one of the eight culinary traditions of China and a major influence on the present day food in northeastern China. Jinan cuisine represents a branch of Shandong cuisine famous for its soups. 

There are the usual mediocre international fast food chains, plenty of street food, scores of little restaurants, etc. The easiest is either street food or one of the many buffets where you can see the food and order that way. Or if you want expensive and exotic (eg Japanese, go to the 4-5 star hotels). There are some nice local restaurants, but if you can't read Chinese it is not worth the hassle and the free entertainment you provide to onlookers. Each restaurant seems to specialise in a style of cooking and a special dish or two. However, finding what you might like can be quite a challenge, as many restaurants don't have menus with pictures, and next to none have English menus. Some of the smaller places have a part of their menu printed into a large poster on the wall, with photos, and provides an easy way to get something you want. 

* The most famous snack street in Jinan.

* A very famous snack street with old buildings.

* A great shopping Plaza with many restaurants.

* A good roast duck restaurant.

* Twists and turns for about 2 blocks. Despite the narrow and pitted road, there are some nice restaurants here.

* The Muslim quarter of town. The food is fresh, as earlier in the day sheep where standing where you are now eating (look for the red stain on the ground). You can't get fresher than that. However, the smell is off putting in the summer with no refridgeration and swarms of flies laying eggs in your about to be eaten lamb (cat meat according to local news sources has been used in these places to boost profits and keep the cat population down).

* Great restaurant, which Westerners seem to frequent.

* Sidestreets full of food.

*An Italian restaurant. Favorite place of foreign students and young Chinese. The food is not as good and tasty as in Jenny's, but cheaper.
*A cluster of restaurants, cheap and expensive, different Chinese and western cuisines.
*Big restaurant like Da Guan Yuan Beijing Duck and Gou Bu Li Baozi. Small snack stalls selling Jinan specialties including You Xuan and lamb skewers.
*Authentic Italian food. Pastas, pizzas and entrees from 70rmb served in an elegant atmosphere. Most of the staff speaks English and there's an English menu.
*A small restaurant that sells pizza, spaghetti, and steak. The owner (English name Sarah) speaks English. This place is popular on the weekends when all the kids from the English school next door have dinner, so come on a week day if you can. 

Drink
Jinan does not have much to offer in terms in Western style drinking places. However, there are plenty of Chinese style outdoor drinking places with impossibly low tables and chairs, which dish up skewers of meats for a few cents along with a few other things like soybeans or such. Beer flows freely.

* Is a nice bar in a basement. Offers bottled, cold beer. Foreigners hang around, also locals are there.

* Offers a wide range of cuisines including Italian and Mexican. This place used to be a foreigner hangout until management changed and the staff became unfriendly, the dishes halved in size and the prices doubled. Expensive western food in addition to many expensive drinks. Prices are like European prices, but at least you can eat something else than garlic beans and tofu. They also serve imported beer (Paulaner, Erdinger, Guinness etc) if you want a quality beer for a change. There's a small store next door that sells imported products like cheese.

* Although it looks like any other Muslim BBQ place in the area, the owner, Wei Wei, has befriended so many foreigners over the years that now they form the majority of his clientèle. Especially on Wednesdays people get together here. Wei Wei himself is quite a character, and though he might not be able to communicate in English, he can swear in a way that would make a sailor blush. To get there take a cab to the Muslim quarter (Hui min xiao qu). You will turn from Jing Qi Lu into a street with BBQ places, one after the other. Continue until the street opens up into a small square with more BBQ places and lots of smoke. Take the alley on your right, it's about two buildings in. A popular activity here is to do the 100 stick and beer challenge, this is good if you want to spend another week recovering in hospital replacing body fluids (bring plenty of imodium pills).

* Cheaper than the clubs and more lively than English Corner. This is a favorite of many foreign students, although some locals come here as well.

* This place has bands playing on most evenings.

*Western oriented disco. Popular with foreign students. Different kinds of beer are available.

Clubs
* The latest club in town.. It's closed now (it's been closed for three years)

* A big club, mostly locals visiting. The main alternative to 1+1.

Sleep
There are plenty of places to choose from in the &yen;200 range. There is a complex of fancy hotels in the swank SE of the city at the end of Lishan Lu, which are all surprisingly affordable for what they are, considering they have beautiful grounds, five star services and facilities, etc. Also good hotels downtown. There are also hotels at the transport nexus at the train station, but that's a little removed from the sites.

Budget
*A standard, clean chain of hotels. Small rooms, but there's wifi. You must give them a ¥300 deposit.
*Free internet. Meeting facilities, ticket office and laundry service available. Chinese restaurant and room service.

* Quite affordable. It particularly boasts beautiful business suites as well as conference facilities. Online booking available on the website.

Splurge
