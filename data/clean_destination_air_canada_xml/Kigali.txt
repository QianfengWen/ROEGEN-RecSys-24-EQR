Kigali is the capital of .

Understand
The centre of political and commercial life, Kigali dominates Rwanda and few visit the country without passing through. The city is developing fast and is very much a modern showpiece capital designed to impress visitors: from the humble tourist to foreign investors and visiting dignitaries.

With a population topping 1 million, the city spreads out over several hills and valleys, with many of the better restaurants and hotels at a distance from the traditional downtown area. The Kigali City Masterplan outlines the future for this burgeoning metropolis – with plans for a new city to be built south of the current city centre.

As a clean, comfortable and ordered city, Kigali is very popular with long term expats, and the city is teeming with westerners, from young church or NGO volunteers having their first experience of Africa to career development workers enjoying a relaxed lifestyle where it is safe to bring up young children. This in turn means the city supports numerous restaurants, coffee shops and supermarkets that cater to this demographic. The country is also rapidly developing, with huge infrastructure and construction projects expanding rapidly, taking advantage of the country's stable peace period. Residents are quite openly proud of the progress the country has made and are widely supportive of it. New, well-maintained roads have been extended throughout the country and you'd be hard pressed to find a single piece of litter. Schools, clean energy projects, water services, and cellular and broadband connectivity are all being rapidly developed nation-wide. 

However, visitors are cautioned to be respectful on matters related to ethnic / tribal affiliation and the genocide in the 1990s. While tribal / ethnic affiliation in other countries in the region is commonly discussed, it is not appropriate to ask or refer to individuals what their ethnicity or tribal affiliation is in Rwanda. Rwanda has gone to great lengths to preserve and remember the tragedy of the genocide - with it frequently held in schools and memorials as a call to ensure such tragedy and atrocity can never happen again. However, it remains a sensitive topic and should not be raised as light conversation with Rwandans. Certainly take time to pay your respects at one of the many memorials in country, but do not expect this to be a topic for small talk with Rwandans. Also when referred to in appropriate settings, the generally accepted terminology is 'genocide against the Tutsis', and not 'Rwandan genocide'.

Get in

By plane

Dinky Kigali International is a delightful airport - small and organised, it is rare to encounter any problems. Be aware that plastic bags are illegal in Rwanda, so please pack using a different material. Security and check in also often operate differently here. When driving into the airport, you'll be stopped and asked to exit your vehicle with all of your bags. You'll go through an airport scanner at this road block and your bags and car will be checked by a security team independently, likely with a K9 unit. You'll then load your bags back in and continue on to the airport. Check-in times are more tightly scheduled, so you won't be able to enter the airport until around 2-3 hours before your flight time. Once you do, all airlines are served by AirRwanda staff for check-in. You'll then go through passport control and then security again before arriving at the 6 available gates. 

Plans are in progress to transition to the larger airport outside of Kigali as the primary airport - construction has begun to expand that airport and will eventually transition most international flights there. 

KLM started flights to Kigali from on 31 October 2010.

Brussels Airlines flies to Kigali from in .

Kenya Airways also has frequent flights from .

Ethiopian Airlines has daily flights between and Kigali.

Rwandair the national carrier, has several flights a day to other African destinations, as well as , , , and . It's a modern affair, with ticket sales and online check-in available.

South African Airways will resume flights to Kigali from Johannesburg in 2012.

Air Uganda flies six times a week to .

Turkish Airlines started flights to Kigali from in May 2012.

On flying out of Kigali airport keep in mind the need for a Yellow Fever Certificate at your destination (eg South Africa) - Airport officials will ask for this. Also be careful of waiting in the cafe for your flight - some flights (eg Kenya Airways to Nairobi) are often overbooked and you won't hear any announcement when they decide to start boarding early, and you could miss your flight.
Also be prepared for at least 2-3 security checks before the departure. Checks are pretty thorough.

By car

Roads in Rwanda are famously well-paved and clean, thanks to huge investments in infrastructure over the past decade. However, rules are strictly enforced. Speed traffic cameras are commonplace on roads through Rwanda - from small streets to larger intercity roads. Police presence is also extensive - and regular roadchecks are commonplace - often with police officers setting up in the middle of a street and having each driver pull to the side while their licence plates are run. Corruption in these cases isn't a real concern so these stops shouldn't be equated with similar exercises in other countries where police may be looking for a bribe. Just follow their directions and it should move along quickly (a bribe offer will likely instead get you in a world of trouble).

By bus

Buses arrive and depart to many parts of Rwanda regularly.

* There are a couple of daily buses that run directly between Kigali and in . The bus is cramped and uncomfortable but is the cheapest choice.

* There are a couple of daily buses that run directly between Kigali and in . Yahoo Car, New Yahoo and Belvedere have buses in the morning.

* Bus 104 will get you to the center for Rwf 250. Heading to the airport, catch it in front of the Bank of Kigali/Ernst & Young building downtown.

Get around
* Motorcyle taxis (motos) are the most popular and fastest way to get around town. The fare for the motorcycle ranges from 200 RFr-1000 RFr depending on distance, but most of the motocyclists will ask for RFr 200-500. Keep in mind that on the main road out to the airport they really put their foot down. It is however a good well sealed road, nice views over Kigali City and a thrilling ride. You'll be given a helmet for the ride (don't take a ride if they don't have a helmet) but you're expected to have something to cover your head between the helmet (e.g., a hat, a scarf, a handkerchief, etc). Some routes you can negotiate a bit - there's no hard algorithm and visible foreigners will get charged higher prices usually - which is acceptable but make sure it's within reason. If you're standing on the side of a street, it's more than likely they'll see you and try to come to you first before you even need to flag them down. Just give a nod or confirmation if you need a ride and they'll pull up. Tell them where you need to go, they'll quote you a price, and if you think it's too high, feel free to say no thank you ('Oya, urakoze') and try with the next one. 

* Matatus (minibuses) provide major routes throughout the city and are the cheapest way to get around. The Minibus in Rwanda is one of the best forms of transport in East Africa. Most of the buses are still new and are maintained well. There are several minibus companies which connect Kigali and the other cities in Rwanda. All of them give the same price depending on the distance. For short distances, such as to Ntarama, it costs only 600 RFr. The distance to Ruhungeri costs 2500 RFr and to Gisenyi 3000 RFr. Ritco is a partly government-owned company which operates newer coaches on many of these routes for the same price, and offers better comfort than minibuses.

For buses around Kigali, there are several companies that have each won contracts for separate lines in the city. These are identifiable by their bus line number (for example 300 series which includes bus lines 302, 304, 305, etc, and are usually white with a dark green stripe). Buses can either be minibuses like matatus, or quite standard looking municipal city buses. Most Rwandans will have a contactless card that can be loaded with funds and tap in on entry. If you don't have one, you can pay the driver in cash - though won't get exact change (while there are technically smaller coins in circulation, most transactions in Rwanda round to 100 francs - so for example, while the fare on the 305 bus is 264 Rwf as of Nov 2021, if you give the driver 300, don't expect change). You'll need to flag down the bus if you're waiting - don't expect it to stop at every stop. Similarly if you're on the bus, you need to request the stop. This is easier on minibuses / matatus, but on the larger city buses, even if there is a call button, this is usually done by banging the plastic handholds on the safety rail against the rail repeatedly. Also don't be surprised to see people with big luggage, huge sacks of grains, or large bags of fruit and vegetables. These will usually be stowed in the front by the driver. 

* There are several car rental agencies in Kigali.

* There are many taxis in Kigali, and in comparison with motos are expensive. A short 1km trip will cost Rwf 2,000 after haggling, going up to Rwf 20,000 for an airport run. Taxi prices to the airport have increased and will usually be around 20,000 - 25,000 from most parts of Kigali proper - the airport now imposes fees for entry and exit from the airport so this isn't just squeezing you for money - the taxis just need to account for those charges. Taxis are mainly of two types in Kigali - those operated by individuals (usually with some form of yellow stripe on the vehicle) and more professionally run services operated by a single large operator. The Kigali Airport Taxis and Kigali Taxi Service are the two major groups; there are others companies also running taxis, but these are the largest and both operate a number you can call to summon a taxi. 3122 for Kigali Taxis service and 476586 for Kigali Aiport Taxi service. A reliable individual is Alex, who is on 0788741559 (French & some English spoken).

There is an e-hailing app called Move which is run by VW. The app doesn't function well but you can phone the driver up directly to arrange a pick up. Payment is cash or card and at a fraction of the price of other taxis depending on the type of vehicle you choose. For airport trips expect to pay an extra 3000rwf for airport parking.

* Hotel Shuttles many hotels will run shuttles to and from the airport, or arrange for taxis. It's good to clarify the policy with your hotel - sometimes they offer this as a service for free and sometimes they are just the middleman and will arrange for (likely an upcharged) taxi - and it's not just as easy as nice hotels vs budget hotels. Also consider asking the front desk - sometimes if they have a pick-up or drop-off already scheduled, they'll take you along for free if you ask nicely.

See

* The Kigali Genocide Memorial Centre opened in April 2004 on the 10th anniversary of the Rwandan genocide. Over 250,000 people are buried here, and there is a truly touching museum. Kigali houses several memorials, museums, and centers dedicated to the Rwandan Genocide. Entry is free, but donations are welcomed. A useful audio guide is available for Rwf 20,000, with concessions for students or East African Community residents. Permission to take pictures is available for Rwf 16,000.
*The abode of the formal President Habyarimana, who died in that infamous plane crash of 1994. Now an art gallery (May 2018), you can still see the building but are no longer shown secret rooms of the house. Guided tours are mandatory, where you can get a glimpse of life as an African dictator in the 1970s & 80s. The display of Rwandan clothing is no longer shown. Photography is restricted. Rwf 6,000 (Rwf 5,000 for resident foreigners). You can view the wreckage of the 1994 plane crash of President Habyarimana that began the genocide. To get there a moto should cost about Rwf 1,000, and tell him to go to Kanombe - you'll probably end up outside the military hospital at the end of the tarred road, the museum is another 300 meters along the dirt road (GPS coordinates 1.97543S, 30.17206E). 

Do
Take a trip to a craft centre, like the Dancing Pots Craft Centre or the Cards for Africa workshop and sales room in Kigali.
*Professional ballet school in Gaculiro - lessons for both children & adults, beginners & experienced dancers. Good mix of Rwandan and expatriate students.
*A great 10km running circuit through Kigali's suburbs - flat, very little traffic and some great views over the rice paddies.
*Opened in 2012 and proving popular. Six lanes of ball-rolling fury complete with the TV screen keeping score, ball returners, shoe rental, and slidy, polished alleys. Adding a delightful twist to employment creation the pins are reset by hand rather than a machine. First game costs Rwf 3,000 per person and the second is Rwf 2,500 each.
*Zenora Wellness Center is great a place to relax and get beauty treatments. Here you can get massages, manicures and pedicures, facials, make-up, and waxing. The premise is clean and tidy. Staff is friendly and welcoming. They have an online booking system which makes it really easy to book.

Learn
Learn a bit of French, maybe even a bit of Swahili and Kinyarwanda, all three are extremely useful here. English is also widely spoken, at least in Kigali. A useful Kinyarwanda vocabulary cheat sheet is available here

Kinyarwanda is most widely spoken, though English is increasingly important and a mandatory part of the curriculum as an official language - supplanting the traditional role of French. French still has a clear presence though is largely only used by older, well-educated Rwandans. Most Rwandans, especially younger Rwandans and those in client service jobs, will speak English quite well. Swahili was more recently included alongside English and Kinyarwanda as a mandatory part of the school curriculum as part of the wider East African Community integration. While most Rwandans will understand and speak enough of it, most of it regularly manifests as loan words and phrases in day to day use. 

English will likely be the easiest and most widely understood lingua franca for most visitors - though it's still well-appreciated to learn at least a few of the basics in Kinyarwanda (hello - muraho, goodbye - murabeho, thank you - murakoze).

Work
Your best bet would be with an aid organization or NGO. If you are a resident of the US or EU, keep in mind that you can avoid paying for an expensive residency permit simply by declaring yourself a tourist upon arrival and then traveling outside of Rwanda once every 90 days for the length of your stay. Your 90-day tourist visa (automatically granted upon entry) will be renewed each time you leave and reenter the country (and it's a convenient excuse to go on vacation!).

Buy

The first thing to be aware of is that Kigali is expensive. As a cash strapped landlocked country costs of imported goods are high and import duties and VAT considerable. Foreigners often complain that wine, olive oil, breakfast cereals, kettle chips and other mundane foodstuffs cost a fortune, so beware. Costs can be lowered considerably by buying Rwandan or East African Community goods - Kenya in particular produces a wide range of produce that often cost half the imported European equivalent.

Outside of supermarkets and restaurants most venders are used to a bit of haggling (even over fruit and veg) although as always keep things in perspective - but don't let storekeepers charge you double what you think you should be paying.

When changing money at a forex bureau or on the street, be aware that only US dollar bills dated Series 2009 or newer will be accepted. 

What to buy
Rwandan coffee is generally very good (although stay away from the cheapest stuff, which will be the sweepings from the grinding factory floor). Expect to pay around Rwf 4,000 per 500g.
Rwandan honey is great, especially the Nyungwe Highlands type. Around Rwf 1,750 per 500g.
Rwandan tea (both black and green) is also pretty good.
Rwandan handicrafts and kitenge products can be found almost everywhere, but Tubahumurize Association is a unique spot that uses the profits from their sales to fuel their trauma counselling, vocational training, micro-credit loans, sewing school and cooperative programs. The prices are affordable and you'll find everything from yoga bags and circle scarves to agaseke baskets and gorgeous quilts. 

Local markets are stocked with Rwandan handicrafts, clothing, fabulous colourful fabric from West Africa and just about anything else. 

The large market in Kimironko is a good place for fruit, veg, rice and other basic foodstuffs - and it can be good fun looking through the secondhand clothes section. Kimironko is organised with food up front - with butchers and fishmongers lining much of the outer edge, and on the inside square, there's eggs and nuts, followed by fruits and vegetables, and then grains and flours. After food, the outer edge shops change to luggage, phone accessory, and housewares shops. The inside square changes to hardware (hammers, nails, picture frames, buckets) to shoes, then tourist / souvenir items, and then finally fabric stalls where you can have clothes, bags, or shoes custom made. Kimironko is smaller than it looks and often involves squeezing tightly through spaces. The shops are all 'booths' so you can pass from one to the other. If you are visibly foreign, expect to be called after and followed for business, but if you give a firm no - you're more easily left alone than in some other markets. As always, everything is a negotiation and they'll often high-ball you on prices with an expectation to negotiate down, especially if you're buying a lot. You're expected to negotiate but don't be too ruthless if you can - if you can afford to pay some of the 'foreigner tax' on products, a lot of these resellers are making pennies on the margin - for most travellers, a couple hundred francs is negligible but makes a big difference to them. For the woven baskets, as of 2021, you can probably expect to pay pretty fairly pay around 4,000 - 5,000 Rwf for large ones, 2,000 Rwf for the smaller ones. Amahoro baskets (famous from Rwanda and a national symbol) usually come in 'nesting' sets of 5 - and will usually go for around 8,000 - 10,000 Rwf depending on quality. Gorilla staffs will usually be around 17,000 - 22,000 Rwf. Custom clothing often won't be the most careful stitch-work but if you offer a bit of a tip upfront, you'll usually get a better product. A custom dress usually runs around 45,000 Rwf for a rather simple design. 

Cash machines / ATMs- More and more bank ATMs are starting to accept Visa cards, including the Bank of Kigali and Ecobank. Ecobank's headquarters are located in the center of town next to CNLS and near UTC / Nakumatt. There is a Visa ATM at the airport too. 

There are banks in Kigali with counter service for withdrawals (and Ecobank can do MasterCard withdrawals at a price).

Note that most shops are closed on Sundays.

Eat
By any standards Kigali is an excellent city in which to dine. A combination of Belgian culinary influence, plenty of cows, plenty of freshwater fish, and plenty of fresh vegetables equates to some of the best eating in the region. And it's all pretty affordable.
Note that Kigali restaurants and bars go in and out of fashion, not to mention close down, quite frequently. Check for the latest once you are in town and be aware that some places mentioned in some print guidebooks no longer exist. (The oft-mentioned Turtle Cafe has been closed since 2003!)
Finally note that as with the rest of the region restaurants take their time – with a usual 45 minutes to 1 hour wait between ordering and your food arriving, especially for dinner. If you are after a quick eat at lunchtime there are several ‘African buffets’ dotted around where you pile your plate high and are out the door in 30 minutes. 
As Kigali is quite a sprawling city eateries are organised by suburb. The local corner cafes serve decent quality food at excellent prices. 

City Centre
* at the Kigali Business Centre slightly out of town. Has great wholesome food. Eat as much as you like for 3 US$.

*Sometimes excellent, sometimes not, La Classe is oft overlooked by Kigali's expats, but the fillet steak can be sublime. Also does a Rwf3,500 lunchtime buffet
* Union Trade Center shopping plaza in the centreville and at the MTN Centre in Remera. In 2011 it is getting mixed reviews
* have good food, with special themes during the week such as the Wednesday Mongolian BBQ, Friday's African Buffet and Sunday's Buffet at Sokoni, and special themed lunches everyday at Milima..
* is about 5 minutes walk from Mille Collines and serves local food in a nice setting. Their dinner buffet is quite good and costs about €7 for more than 20 items. There may be better local food in a hole-in-the wall restaurant for cheaper, but this is wonderful restaurant.
* near Milles Collines, is a relatively unknown Chinese restaurant. Not very cozy, but the food is really good.
* three blocks downhill from the Mille Collines, is a new restaurant serving American and Continental cuisine. A bit pricy, with most entrees costing FRW4000 or above, but the well-prepared food (and fantastic dessert menu) are worth every franc.

 Gacuriro
*Kigali Guestlux (GPS co-ordinates -1.9195, 30.0973) – one of the few eateries in Gacuriro – serves up adequate fare in the gardens of the guesthouse.
*Brioche - great place to meet up for food, pastries and tea/coffee.

 Kiyovu
*Republika Great restaurant, great environment. 
*The New Cactus - Very good pizzas, popular among expats. Nevertheless the served pizzas can't be compared to Italian ones. Try to get a table in the sheltered part of the open air restaurant, it can be quite windy. (Closed between 2pm and 6pm).
* Khana Khazana serves fantastic Indian food and is one of the best and most popular restaurants in town with expats, visitors, business travellers and Rwandan citizens too.
*"Zaaffran Restaurant" also has great Indian cuisine at slightly more affordable price. Excellent ambiance.

 Kacyiru
*Mimosa’’’ – A reliable lunchtime buffet for Rwf 2,500. Just down from Top Tower hotel.
*Shokola Great restaurant, great environment. In Kiyovu, close to downtown.
*Great Wall Chinese restaurant An excellent place to dine. Good Chinese dishes with great atmosphere and nice views of the city. Is just one minute walk from Discover Rwanda Youth Hostel. Prices are very reasonable for travelers on a low budget
*Grill and Bar BBQ Popular with locals. Here is good place to try the local goat brochettes. The bar is also nice if you want just a drink. You may also watch European football here as locals come here to watch football games on projectors. Its a very cheap place and brochettes are 500RWF each.

 Kimihurura
* L'Atelier is tucked away in the residential district of Kimihurura, within walking distance of Papyrus. You may need help to find it but you'll be rewarded with delicious French cuisine in an intimate setting. 
* Africa Bite – pronounced locally as “Africa Bi-te”. Popular lunchtime African buffet, with excellent rotis, for Rwf3,000.
* Thai restaurant at New Cadillac night club was well liked when it first opened. However it is getting mixed reviews after the departure of its Thai chef. This is quite common in Kigali.
* This place serves excellent food in its thatched surrounds. The beef carpaccio is some of the best in the city, the steaks reliable, and the brochettes as good as they come. The place can be a bit quiet, but worth checking out. Its proprietor is Eugene Habimana, known as Cobra, a longstanding Rwandan musician.
*Mosaic Restaurant: the newest restaurant in town that offers Japanese food and a wide choices of Asian cuisine. For details contact 0250784903670 and expect your food to be served in max. 20 mins.

 Kimironko

 Nyarutarama
*Run by a Korean family, Sakae serves up both Japanese and Korean dishes in spacious and pleasant surroundings. A little pricey, but many prefer Sakae to nearby Zen.
*With the dining area nestled under a huge thatched hut, with trickling water and subtle lighting, there are few places in town that can compete atmosphere-wise. The food is usually pretty good, however you can feel a little cheated by the portion sizes, and the extras added to your bill (rice, service, VAT). Accordingly Zen is popular with those with expense accounts.

Remera
*A firm favourite in Kigali - decent wood fired pizzas, expensive lunch time buffet, great views from the terrace - popular with locals and expats alike. Monday nights is quiz night, which is mystifyingly popular.
*Set in lush gardens, this is one of the better Chinese places in town, in part as the owner and chef is Chinese. An added plus is that service only takes 15 minutes or so. One of the few restaurants with rabbit on the menu - and very tasty it is too.

 Kibagabaga / Kinyinya 
*Kinyinya Topview – (GPS co-ordinates -1.9173, 30.1121) pleasant local brochette bar near the Deutsche Welle radio masts. Somewhere different to go – great at night time when the masts are lit up like a red Christmas tree. Brochette and chips around Rwf 2,000

Other
* Le Glacon A great ice cream store.
* La Sierra Serves nearly everything imaginable
*Camellia tea house amazing selection of teas, good food. Lunch buffet is very popular

Drink

Bottled water is recommended for foreign visitors.

*For alcohol try Trophy's Lounge or Choma'd in Nyarutarama for great cocktails
* For Nightlife - Try, Papyrus, Repub Lounge and Sundowner - all in Kimihurura

Splurge
Kigali has three international class hotels.

* Formerly a Belgian-owned hotel known as the Diplomates and briefly portrayed in Hotel Rwanda. Renovated in 2003 and 2011.

* While the movie Hotel Rwanda was filmed in South Africa, this is where the actual events took place. The hotel has two restaurants, a pool, internet and a gift shop. The hotel underwent extensive renovation in 2010. Rates are slightly higher for pool view rooms. All rooms have safes but no hair dryer or coffee maker. Free access to Wi-Fi, but coverage is uneven. Wonderful breakfast buffet. Apart from the movie this hotel is also the setting for the novel Un dimanche à la piscine à Kigali.

* Still known by its former name Novotel by almost everyone. Ask for a swimming pool view room on a high floor for a beautiful sunrise to wake you from your slumber.

Contact
English/French language broadcasts are available from BBC World Service in Kigali on 93.9MHz.

Stay safe
Kigali is relatively safe and friendly as far as African capitals go. Keep your eyes open and your wallet out of the reach of pickpockets, especially in crowded areas. Avoid walking after dark if possible, especially alone. Take extra precaution in the area between New Cadilac Nightclub and Carwash bar. 

Police officers are generally helpful if you're in a bind, but don't expect speedy results.

Get out

* is a nature preserve in the eastern part of Rwanda. It is about a 2.5 hour drive from Kigali and is a great day trip for wildlife viewing: giraffes, elephants, hippos, baboons, zebra, impala, etc. You can rent a car or go through a tour operator, which costs on average, $150 USD. You can hire a guide, a boat cruise, or stay the night at their lodge. There are three possibilities to stay overnight: camping (in the south and in the north camp sites), Akagera Game Lodge (mid-range) and Ruzizi Tented Camp (luxury).
* Volcanoes National Park, home of the mountain gorillas, and the setting for author Dian Fossey's research. If you can afford it, it's an excellent experience, even possible as a day trip from Kigali. You can also take the "Dian Fossey Trek" or the "Golden Monkey Trek" for $75-100 USD. You might be able to see a gorilla group on one of these hikes if you're lucky. Inquire at the Rwandan Office for Tourism and National Parks (ORTPN), Boulevard de la Révolution n° 1, Kigali, +(250) 576514 or 573396, mailto:reservation@rwandatourism.com/ reservation@rwandatourism.com. $750 USD cash or Visa card. 50% discount for residents. Gorilla trekking in Volcanoes National Park requires a permit, now $1500 for non-EAC residents. This goes towards your entry, but supports conservation efforts at large in the park, as well as the local community. At the start of the trek, you'll be asked to indicate your fitness level - be very honest and err on the side of underselling yourself if needed. You'll be placed in a group accordingly, and the hikes can vary from rather easy 30 minute ascents up to 6-8 hours strenuous hikes. Guides and porters are more than willing to help but you don't want to have wasted your $1500 needing to call it quits before you get to the gorillas. The guides and porters are also very familiar and protective of both you and the gorillas. While the gorillas can get quite close - your guide and trackers will keep you safe - there has only ever been one incident and it involved a photographer brazenly ignoring the guide and trackers and antagonising the gorilla. There are tour providers that can get you out to Volcanoes for a day trip quite easily - though many of the visitors will stay in luxury lodges nearby to do multiple treks. 
* Gisenyi, also called Rubavu, is a city on the shores of Lake Kivu, right at the border of Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo. Gisenyi is as close you can get to a beach destination in Rwanda. The sandy public beach and the many resorts close to Bralirwa give you the seaside feeling you might be craving.
* Kibuye is the other popular destination at Lake Kivu (besides Gisenyi), which has a very lake-side feeling. You can rent a boat and visit the nearby islands, including Napoleon Hat Island with its many fruit bats you can see up close. Kibuye also hosts Rwanda's Environmental Museum
* Gishwati Forest National Park is Rwanda's newest park. It comprises pasture lands and many Eucaliptus plantations. If you want to visit a dairy farm or factory, this is the place to go.
* Foret Naturelle de Mukura is officially part of the Gishwati National Park, but separated from the largest patch in the North. Mukura is a small natural forest boasting a small chimpanzee population. If you do not want to go all the way to Nyungwe for the Chimps, you can visit them at Mukura on your way to Kibuye.
* Musanze is the gateway to the Volcanoes National Park and the treks to see the gorillas. However, Musanze also offers several caves for all enthusiasts, from tourist-friendly to specialists. Visits are organised through the RDB and previous booking is required (they often organise tours at 2pm, calling them in the morning is usually enough). Tours start at the RDB office at Kinigi (same place where gorilla tours start).
* Twin lakes Burera and Ruhondo are between Kigali and Musanze and make for a nice weekend break. There are camp sites and resorts available around the lakes, and even on an island in lake Burera. Views from lake Ruhondo are very popular as looking towards the lake one has the sun setting behind the volcanoes in the background. You can stay overnight at the Foyer de Charite or Ruhondo Lake Resort, overlooking lake Ruhondo and the volcanoes.
* Lake Muhazi is the standard get-away day-trip. Only 45 minutes from Kigali either North on the road to Uganda, or East on the way to Rwamagana. Muhazi is a bilharzia-full lake (so no swimming), but it has several nice resorts on its shore. Near Rwesero you have Rwesero Resort, or cross the lake to Kingfisher resort, boasting a pool with a view mid-way up the hill. Mid-way on the northern short you have Jambo beach and Sisters of Peace resorts.
* Nyanza was the capital of the Kingdom of Rwanda from 1958 to 1962. The old Royal Palace of the Rwandan monarchy is located in the town of Nyanza.

Fun outdoor activities
* Canoeing and kayaking tours are organised on lake Kivu and on a river near Musanze 

Further along the way
* Nyungwe Forest National Park is probably the best preserved montane rainforest in Central Africa. The park contains 13 primate species (25% of Africa's total), 275 bird species, 1068 plant species, 85 mammal species, 32 amphibian and 38 reptile species.
* Nyiragongo volcano just across the border in the DRC is potentially one of the most impressive destinations in the Great Lakes region. This 2-day hike (5-6 hours up, 3 hours down) rewards you with a night spent on the edge of an active bubbling magma lake and amazing views over Goma, Gisenyi and Lake Kivu. It is a must-see!
* Idjwi Island in the middle of Lake Kivu rewards you with a peaceful weekend in the DRC. Unlike any of the crazy stories elsewhere in the DRC, Idjwi is characterised by its peaceful and calm people. A tour organised by Yves takes you around the island, shows you local businesses and culture, pygmy villages, and maybe even the King!

To Uganda
As of Jan 2019 it was possible to get a VOA into Uganda for $50. To get from Kigali to Uganda is very easy. There are many buses to for around 5000rwf, 3+hours. From there take a Moto or matatu (500rwf) to Cyanika. Cross at the Cyanika border, take another Moto (4000USH) or Matatu to . In Kisoro, change for other buses onto the country. 

To Tanzania
The Visa requirements for Tanzania are a little fuzzy (January 2019). Online the embassy says that some nationalities can get visas at some ports of entry, but it is strongly advised to get a Visa in advance, especially if doing a land crossing. At the Embassy/High Commission for Tanzania in Kigali, their exact words were "Is possible, but things could go wrong and they could run out of visas"... So best to be safe and get one ahead of time. $50 for most countries, $100 for US residents; good for 90 days. The Tanzanian High Commission is open for visa applications M-F from 8am-12pm. Pick up the following day between 2:30-3:30pm. No appointment needed. They only accept USD.

To get to Tanzania from Kigali, there are buses to the border town of Rusumo, or directly to Nyakanazi (which leave at 4am).
