Xiamen (厦门; Xiàmén) is a coastal city in Province in . It has been an important port for centuries and became one of China's earliest Special Economic Zones in the 1980s. The name Xiamen means "door to the house", referring to the city's centuries-old role as a gateway to China.

It is not Taipei or Hong Kong, but compared to most other cities in the region, Xiamen is definitely a very vibrant, affluent and modern place. It got an international award in a contest for most livable cities in 2002; neighboring won the following year.

The most important tourist area is Island, a small island which contains some beautiful colonial buildings and is car free.

Understand
 
Most of the city is on Xiamen island. The mainland areas and Haicang, just across bridges, and the smaller island are administratively parts of the same city, but geographically distinct.

Until 1840, Western countries were allowed to trade only in (which they called Canton), and only under strict controls. After China lost the First Opium War, Britain took and China opened five Treaty Ports: Guangzhou, Xiamen (then known as Amoy), , and . In Xiamen, the island became a foreign enclave with consulates and luxurious homes. Today it is a quiet area (no motorcycles) and five minutes by ferry from downtown, and still quite scenic.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, was a focus of missionary activity. There are still many historic churches in the region.

In the 1970s, Xiamen was one of the first cities to become a to encourage development and open mainland China to the outside world; since then it has flourished. Technically, only Xiamen Island and Gulang Yu are in the SEZ, but the whole region is flourishing. Xiamen has more investment than any other mainland city, partly because Taiwanese is a dialect of (Southern Min), the local language of southern Fujian. There is also a major influx of other foreign investment; among the foreign companies with large factories in Xiamen are Lifetime Products, Dell and Kodak.

Get in

By plane

Public buses depart from a 5 minute walk out Terminal 3 (¥1 to anywhere, you can pay cash).
The BRT also goes to the airport at Terminal 4 from the city center (¥3).

If you are flying to Xiamen from North America, consider Korean Air. They offer great discounts, and the Seoul Airport is the most user-friendly on the planet, free internet and nice free lounges with couches to stretch out on.

Fast connect Xiamen North to (&yen;85, 100 minutes) and beyond Fuzhou toward and . The fast train line to the south connects Xiamen North with (Shenxia Highspeed Rail). There is also regular train service, cheaper but slow since the railroads travel a circuitous route through mountains; a bus is usually a better choice.

If using the Xiamen North Raileay Station, the North Square/Entrance is currently not as fully featured. It is better to enter via the South Square/Entrance where there are shops, restaurants, and the only ticket hall (North entrance currently only have automated ticket machines usable by Chinese residents).

* From Hong Kong via Shenzhen: take the metro to Lo Wu border station, cross the border on foot (usually fast and easy if your visa is in order). There are small shops selling bus tickets within the border complex, with pickup nearby, or you can walk a block to the main bus station. A number of Bus operators are available and Bus service is frequent. A trip from Lo wu ( China side) to Xiamen will take 9 hours and cost 250 to 300 Yuan. Night sleeping coaches are also available.

Tickets can be purchased at the Shenzhen Tourism Group (深圳市旅游股份有限公司) counter at Qiaoshe bus station. They take credit card or cash.

By ferry
A boat service operates to and from , which belongs to (), hourly 8:30AM-5:30PM every day. Tickets cost NT$700 from Kinmen and &yen;170 from Xiamen.

There are actually two different ferry terminals in Xiamen. One is called Dongdu (东渡/厦门国际邮轮中心) on the west side of the island near the Marco Polo and Pan Pacific Hotels. While you’ll still see signs for Dongdu Wharf, if you try to get directions for that name you’ll likely end up at the commercial port area; instead lookup the International Ferry Terminal. The other is called Wutong (五通客运码头) on the east side of the island near the Xiang'an Tunnel. Currently, only the Wutong terminal has boats to/from Kinmen.

Note however that there is only one port on Kinmen island for Xiamen, and the boat times alternate.

Get around

By taxi
Taxis are cheap, starting at ¥10 for the first 3 kilometers. After the first 3km, the meter charge will go up based on distance. Note that although the meter may read with a decimal, most taxi drivers will round up. During the day time, you should be able to get anywhere on Xiamen island, including the airport, for under ¥40. But be wary that some taxi drivers might take advantage of you if they know that you are not a local and might take the longer route to your destination. For example, if the driver says "Huándǎo Lù" after you tell him where you want to go, say bù (no), because that is the ring road that circles the entire island and although it is scenic, it is likely the most expensive way to go. Xiamen is known to have the 2nd worst taxi service in China which translates to taxis simply not stopping for you during rush hour (duty shift) or when the driver simply doesn't want to take your fare. Your second option is to go with the "black" taxis: people who simply drive their own car around looking for a quick yuan, especially during (heavy) rainfall when taxis are booked solid. Haggling is required, expect high starting prices.

By subway

Opened in December 2017, Xiamen's Metro has one line (line 1) so far that runs from Xiamen North Railway Station to Zhenhai Road and connects the suburbs with Xiamen downtown. More lines are planned to be built. The fare for a single journey ranges from ¥2-¥7 depending on the distance covered (April 2018).

By bus
The local bus system is very good, but the bus routes are listed in Chinese and do not have English on them. The BRT is Bus Rapid Transit, on elevated bus-only roads; very fast and comfortable but of course it does not go everywhere. Fare is usually ¥1 per person. Baidu Maps will show you which bus to take. 
Buses are ¥1 per person regardless of distance, while BRT are more expensive and is based on distance.

By ferry
There is a frequent ferry service to/from Gǔlàngyǔ. The ferry terminal is just north of the Liujiang Waterfront Hotel. No charge for the journey out; buy tickets near the pier on Gǔlàngyǔ for the return trip, &yen;30 for anyone who is non Xiamen resident. More comfortable seating on the upper deck for an extra ¥1 going either direction; you pay for that on the ferry.

Note that on sundays ferries departing from the main ferry terminal are reserved to Xiamen citizens only. In this case bus 51 on the opposite side of the street takes you to the Xiamen International Cruise Center that provides further ferry connections to Gǔlàngyǔ (can be very crowed on weekends).

By bike
To go around by bike is a great way to explore this gifted Island. Try the Island Ring Road (Huándǎo Lù) which has an extra path for bicycles in most of its parts. Start at Xiamen University Beach and go up until the International Exhibition Center. There are various rental stations on the Huándǎo Road, starting at ¥30 per day. Enjoy the sunshine while cruising next to the sea. If you are leaving the path for bicycles, execute caution of the traffic. 

By motorbike
Exploring Xiamen by motorbike is a great way as well, although it is forbidden on the whole island! Enforcement is strict in the vivid areas (e.g. Yuandang Lake, Zhongshan Road, etc.). If caught, be prepared to pay a fine, or even to get your motorbike taken into custody. Elsewhere in Xiamen, the enforcement of the motorbike law is more easy. Riding a motorbike outside the island (e.g. Area, Tongan Area, Haicang Area) is allowed.

Talk
As with elsewhere in mainland China, standard is the main language taught in schools and the main language in the official broadcast media so expect all educated people to be fluent in . 

The mainstream (Southern Min 闽南语 ; 闽台泉漳片闽南语 Hokkien-Taiwanese) is the local dialect in Xiamen. The local dialect is fairly influential due to the influence of the neighbouring Taiwan that uses Taiwanese Minnan (台灣閩南語/台語) as the second most common spoken language across the Taiwan strait. 

Most local born and bred (originally from Southern Fujian) people of Xiamen speak fluent Mandarin, although it is not necessarily the first language of choice especially among the middle aged and the older generations. Xiamen dialect is the standard dialect accent in Southern Fujian as it sounds highly similar to Taiwanese Minnan (Tainan prestige accent), so Xiamen is an excellent starting place to learn Minnan. Minnan is not mutually intelligible with Mandarin, Cantonese or any of the other Min dialects except for Teochew (潮汕话) which has a limited mutual intelligibility with it.

If you are a Mandarin-speaking foreigner, you will be able to communicate with locals and get around as most services have staff who speak Mandarin. English is not widely spoken, though staff in higher end hotels will usually be able to communicate in English.

See
You can enjoy Xiamen's unique scenery not only in the day but also in the night. Take a breather and walk beside Yundang Lake in the evening and you can see how Xiamen transforms into a different setting: lighted artistic sculptures, scent of the sea, and romantic lovers by the lake.

* Gulangyu（鼓浪屿） A visit to Xiamen would not be complete without setting foot on Gulangyu, the island just across the harbour. A walk around, especially on tourist infested days is exciting. All sorts of food vendors, handicraft hawkers, and cute little cafes and restaurants beckon. To sum up, Gulangyu may just represent what a Chinese version of a Bohemian-like enclave can be. Lots and lots of colourful portrait artists in every nook and corner. A day's trip is just fine. Unless you are really into a spell of peace and quiet, the island may be a little boring once the sun sets except maybe you are into seafood dining and the upmarket cafes and restaurant for drinks. Not cheap though. Gulangyu business people cater for tourists and tourists only. All in all, don't miss visiting this relaxing, quiet and yes "European themed" old buildings island. The Chinese tourists flock all over just for this trip down nostalgia lane.

Several hip cafes have opened in the past few years, and there's even a new Shapowei Art Zone located inside an old fish processing factory.

Gulangyu islet is also abundance in cheap and delicious food, especially on LongTou lane. Don't miss the Longtou lane Fish ball soup.

* Run by a local dude who spent some years working in New Zealand, this place serves only one dish: Penang Curry Laksa, with variations of Seafood and Chicken. Spicy goodness with a touch of creamy coconut milk, this place is gold. Big bowl of soup, noodles with generous amount of chicken, just for 25 rmb. 

* A German guy decided that locals deserve hotdogs better than what were being offered, opened a shop in Xiamen's up-and-coming area Shapowei (or Daxue Lu). Offering two different kinds of hotdogs (spicy and not spicy), with 5 variations of toppings, at 25 rmb, this place is a gem in the heart of Xiamen. My favorite is Chilidog and Supersonic (them yummy caramelized onions, with cream cheese filling the sides of the bun...). Mike's also serves delicious potato salad for just 10rmb. You'll never find anything like this in Shanghai or Beijing.

* A Malaysian guy fed up with local places offering either overpriced burgers or low quality ones, decided to make his own. So Angry Bull happened. Delicious, juicy burgers made from the right parts of a bovine (idk which part but it's supposed to be special), this place got so popular in such a short amount of time that it inspired a copycat (as always in China..). They serve regular burgers(25 rmb) and a monstrous half-pounder(45 rmb). Chili con carne is also an option (I always order mine with this!), for a measly 8rmb additional. When looking for a safe, comfort food, just head towards The Bank Center and walk to Angry Bull.

Pubs:

Xiamen Sports Cafe 27 Hubin Bei Lu Shop 103 Haiwan Xincheng (Near KFC, in the back left corner of the forum of shops behind KFC). Nice sports bar popular with some locals but mainly expats. The bar has a reasonably priced food menu, with the pizza being of high quality. Daily happy hour with cheap pints of Tiger. Especially good if it is your first time to Xiamen and you are looking for some advice on things to do.

There is a bar street opposite the Marco Polo hotel which is called Guanren Lu Bar Street. This is not far away from the Xiamen Sports Cafe, both of which are near the CBD and the Bank of China. Here you can find a variety of pubs, restaurants and shops selling western food items. This area is very popular with expats.

Good menu with both Asian and Western options and pizza is acknowledged as some of the best in Xiamen. There is a large range of pizzas from Y45-65 (they also deliver). They have Becks, Tiger and Stella on tap. Happy hour until 8pm (Becks and Tiger are half price). Live music sometimes (in English).

Easy Riders Saloon Zhongshan Road, behind the Zhonghua cinema, first turn to the left from the main road (after the MCDonalds), Xiamen Best music in town. Very distinctive bar with live music, poker and beer pong. Easy Rider changed location in Xiamen few times already, but the atmosphere is always the same - nothing for non-smokers and abstinents. If you're looking for a place to meet travelers as well as cool locals, this is the place. If you wanna jam with great musicians, it's a must.
