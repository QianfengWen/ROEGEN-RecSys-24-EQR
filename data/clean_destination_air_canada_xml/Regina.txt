Stay safe
Much like Saskatoon, Regina has a higher-than-average crime rate per capita, but unless you go out looking for trouble, nothing is likely to happen to you. The downtown area is quite safe, though you may run into the occasional panhandler or drunken person at night.

The two main neighbourhoods to avoid in Regina are the North Central and Heritage/Chinatown districts, (which are located northwest and northeast of the downtown core), and where most of the crime and prostitution is concentrated.

Get out
*Moose Jaw - Chief attractions are the excellent Western Development Museum (one of four in the province) near the intersection of Main St. and the Trans-Canada Highway (Highway #1). This museum's focus is on transportation, which fills it with excellent, bright displays of antique trains, automobiles, and aircraft, with even one prairie boat thrown in! Another notable tourist attraction is the pair of "tunnels of Moose Jaw" tours, which take visitors through a set of winding tours above and below the downtown core of "the Friendly City." The tours have two themes: the Chinese immigrant experience, and the bad old days of the 1920s, when Chicago mobster Al Capone allegedly took a ride to the northwest terminus of the Soo Line Railway in Moose Jaw to hide out whenever the "heat" was turned up in Chicago.
*Regina Beach - 35 miles northwest of Regina, north of Hwy 11. This beach community and several others sit on Last Mountain Lake.
*Fort Qu'Appelle for decades, has been another summer getaway, with several shallow lakes in the vicinity lined by rows of cottages and boat houses.
*Rouleau, a small town located about 45 minutes south of Regina, has become a popular destination in recent years due to it being used as the filming location for the popular TV sitcom Corner Gas. (The studio where the rest of the series was filmed is located near Broad Street and College Avenue in downtown Regina.)
