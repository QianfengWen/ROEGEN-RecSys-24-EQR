Many streets in Haikou are quite different during the day compared to the evening. Small outdoor restaurants and stalls fill the streets in the evening and many areas are at their busiest from 9.00pm to 1.00am. Local favorites are BBQ stalls which serve cheap local beer till late. You will soon notice the abundance of coconut trees within Haikou. Most streets are lined with them. It is greener than most Chinese cities and has excellent air quality.

A high-speed Eastern Ring railway was opened in January 2011, connecting the major towns on the east coast of Hainan. It takes 1.5–2 hours from Sanya to Haikou. The trains also serve Haikou's Airport. 

The train stops at the following places in Hainan: Sanya (三亚), Tiandu (田独), Lingshui (陵水), Wanning (万宁), Boao (博鳌), Qionghai (琼海), Wenchang (文昌), Haikou Airport (美兰), Haikou East (海口东; main city stop), Haikou West Train Station (海口).

By boat
There are frequent daily ferries between Haikou and Haian. It takes around 1.5 hours. There are bus connections from Haian to other cities, but the options are limited compared to Haikou, especially in the evening.

Get around
There are four main forms of public transportation in Haikou:
* Three-wheeled bicycle can be used for short distances
* Three-wheeled motorcycles which are a little bit more expensive than a bicycle but faster
* Taxi which is the most expensive option. They are easily hailed everywhere in the city. It is customary to bargain before you get on for a fare on your trip. The taxi from the airport is half an hour to the city center. On arrival, you will have a familiar experience in China of a number of drivers shouting taxi at you. These are illegal taxis, and you risk at least paying extra for your journey by taking these. Instead, walk out of the terminal building and see a line of licensed taxis. Before departing, insist on using the meter (dabiao) even if they are reluctant so to do. 
* Buses are very inexpensive, but you need to know the routes. If you choose to get by bus from the airport, show the address of your hotel to the attendant who will show you the bus that will take you closest. There is an airport shuttle from the airport to Home Inn (formerly Civil Aviation Hotel) at Haixiu Avenue in downtown Haikou.

Historical sites

*The original tower was built around 1928-1929. During the Cultural Revolution, it was partially destroyed. In 1987, it was rebuilt near its original site to make room for the new, wider road that runs along the river. The present tower is similar to the original, at 27.3 meters high, and is made of red brick in the European Gothic style.
*Established in commemoration of Qiu Jin, believed to be the most brilliant scholar in Hainan and a renowned Ming Dynasty academic. Construction began in 1705. The two-story main building is made of brick and wood and is rich in traditional ethnic characteristics. The well-preserved academy is now in the site of Qiongtai Teachers' Training School. The academy started holding celebrations after the well-known Cantonese and Qiong drama was written based on the events there.
*Hairui Tomb is a key national cultural protection unit. Hairui, a famous official in the Ming dynasty, was born in Qiongshan and was known as "Hai Qingtian" (incorruptible official). The tomb was built in 1589 and it is said that when people were carrying Hairui's coffin, suddenly the rope broke, and then people decided that this should be the place. Hairui Tomb has an area of 7.4 acres. In the middle, there is a high archway written "Yue Dong Zheng Qi". The gravel path is paved with granite and three memorials are on the way. On the sides of the path leading to the tomb, there stand stone statues shaped like sheep, horses, lions, tortures, and human beings. Hairui Tomb was completely built by granites at three meters and formed like an ancient bell. Evergreen trees are planted around the cemetery. Hairui Cultural Exhibit Hall is also in the cemetery.

*Known as "Temple of the Five Lords", this Ming dynasty construction dedicated to five officials who were banished during the Tang and Song dynasties for criticism of the government: the Tang chancellor Li Deyu and the Song ministers Li Gang, Zhao Ding, Li Gang, and Hu Quang. This is a pretty temple in a tropical setting, surrounded by ponds filled with lilies, winding bridges, and exotic palm trees. The main building is the Wugong temple housing life-like statues of the five officials and is known as the first building of Hainan. The Song dynasty poet, Su Dongpo, is also commemorated here. There is also a museum with information on the five officials, a shop and also other exhibitions non-related to the temple, with only in Chinese language descriptions.
*The 19th-century coastal fort is near Evergreen Park. There you can see the replica cannons, the underground chambers, and many banyan trees. There is a restored Xiuying Fortress (an important sea defense barrier on China's southern border, during the late Qing Dynasty, which played a pivotal role in defending against the invasion of Western powers and defending the security of the South China Sea).

Museums
* 
* The overall appearance of the center building is novel and unique, which fully embodies the tropical coastal elements. The roof is wavy, with regular rhythm and continuous ups and downs.
* This provincial museum is focused on the history and culture of Hainan Island/Province. The museum is located on the east side of the city across the street from the provincial government buildings. The museum is housed in a new, gleaming architectural masterpiece structure. There are exhibits about the people and history of the island. There is a pavilion of Huanghuali, and a pavilion of Chenxiang (the resin-containing wood of Aquilaria sinensis (Lour.) Gilg, a plant of the family Rafflesiaceae, which is regarded as a precious Chinese medicinal herb). In another pavilion, there are rich artifacts out of the water that showcases the underwater heritage of the South China Sea, and a glass walkway that showcases various shellfish and sea stars from the South Sea.

Parks
*Small amusement park. You have to purchase a stored value card, the money they refund after the return of the card. Ferris Wheel, Wild Mouse roller coaster, Pirate Ship, and Log race.
*The Red Forest Nature Reserve (Hong Shu Lin) is an unusual and intriguing evergreen forest peculiar to the subtropical coastal area of Hainan. Despite the name, the trees here do not actually have red leaves. When the tide is in, the roots of the trees are surrounded by water, giving the appearance that the trees grow directly from beneath the sea. This aquatic environment is ideal for breeding fish and shrimp and the leaves on the trees here are also said to have medicinal value. This particular type of tree produces seeds that sprout and propagate within their own shell. Tide times vary according to season, but when the tide is in there are some really fun boat trips to be enjoyed, winding in and out of the tree trunks and then on to the tiny island nearby, ripe with pineapple trees. The boat leaves from the entrance of the park when the tide is in. Each trip takes approximately one hour.

Stay safe
Haikou traffic is a nightmare, said by many Chinese travelers, so expect to experience some of the worst traffic in China where traffic rule is nationally practiced half-heartedly. Cars and motorbikes can come in from any direction. Drivers will drive anywhere as if they have a right-of-way. Even at some obvious moments when a car is expected to stop, it won't necessarily. According to some travelers, at night it is common to see a motorbike without a headlight lit suddenly show up and come at a fairly fast speed. If you are not familiar with these reckless drivers, use maximum caution. Even if you are confident that you have enough experience with traffic conditions in many cities in China, expect it to be even worse here.

It is not uncommon to 'see' riders of e-bikes, motorbikes, and even cars, traveling at night with no lights in many areas of China. Some of them seem to think they are safe because they can 'see' where they are going. It doesn't occur to them that the lights are like a sign of their presence to other road users.
