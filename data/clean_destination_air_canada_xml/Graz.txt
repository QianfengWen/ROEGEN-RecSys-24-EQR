Graz is the capital of (Steiermark) and the 2nd largest city of . 

Understand

Graz is the second-largest city in Austria, with a population of about 300,000. Some 50,000 of this population is made up of students, as Graz is home to no less than six universities (three "standard" universities, two dedicated to applied sciences, and one dedicated to music and the arts), and is associated with names as illustrious as Johannes Kepler, Erwin Schrödinger and Nikola Tesla. 

The roots of Graz can be traced back to Roman times, when a small fort was built where the city centre is today; Slovenians later built a larger fortress in the same place. The name "Graz" is derived from the Slovenian word gradec, which means small castle. Graz was first mentioned with its German name in 1128 when the dukes of Babenberg turned the place into a commercial centre. During 15th century Graz became the capital of Inner Austria (refering to , and ) under the Habsburgs.

Graz has a rich history in education manifested by the number of universities in the city. The first university was founded in 1585 (Karl-Franzens-Universität).

Due to its strategic position, in the 16th century Graz was often attacked by Ottoman Turks. The fortress located on the Schlossberg (the picture to the right shows the clock tower, which is located on top of the hill) never fell to the Turks (the only place in this region).

During WWII, Graz was part of Nazi Germany (along with rest of Austria). At the end of the war, Graz was surrendered to Soviet troops largely intact; the historic old town was not seriously hit during Allied bombing raids on the city. In 2003 Graz was the Cultural Capital of Europe.

Graz is also known for the Magna Steyr (formerly called Steyr-Daimler-Puch) automobile and truck manufacturing plant located there.

It is also the birthplace (in nearby Thal) of bodybuilder, actor and former Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger. Its Merkur Arena was renamed in Schwarzenegger's honor in 1997, but was renamed again (initially to UPC Arena) in 2005, following controversy over the governor's support of California's death penalty.

By train

The main station (Hauptbahnhof) is on the western edge of the city centre, at the end of the Annenstrasse. Graz has frequent connections to Hbf with direct trains every hour (€24, OBB, you can use the app). Connections to Salzburg and most other Austrian Cities and are also reasonably frequent. Night trains serve destinations as far as , and there are two direct day services each day to . There are also less frequent services to and .

The A9, runs north-south through Graz, mostly via the 6 mi Plabutsch tunnel. The A2, just south of the city, runs east-west. (Wien) is 127 mi up the A2 to the east. A just as fast but much more scenic alternative route to Vienna is via Bruck/Mur taking the S6. (There are lots of short tunnels on the S6.) Some might also find the 5 mi (single carriageway) Gleinalm (Toll) tunnel on the A9, 15 miles to the north of Graz, unnerving. Toll charge: Gleinalm Tunnel: cars and motorhomes up to 3.5 t: €7.95 | with caravans/trailers: €9.95 | Motorhomes over 3.5 t: €11.50. It is possible to avoid the tunnel by travelling on the rather longer route via .

Get around 
The old town of Graz is easily explored on foot and is reachable with a 20 min walk from the main train station. Stop at the Tourist Information at the train station, or any hotel lobby that you come across to pick up a brochure on attractions in Graz. This brochure also contains a map with most of the sights marked, as well as recommended self-guided walking routes through the town.

For other needs, public transportation options exist:

By tram
Graz has an excellent tram service running through the Jakominiplatz where the different routes meet and you can change trams and buy tickets at the rondeau as well as all tobacco shops (Tabak Trafik). Make sure you punch your ticket inside the tram (If you get caught without a valid/punched ticket you will have to pay a fine of 60 Euros). You can buy hourly, daily, weekly or monthly tickets (also available at a vending machine in the tram, but you need coins or a working Austrian cash card, or an international Credit card). They are valid on all modes of public transport (Train, Tram and Bus lines) throughout Zone 101 (Graz plus immediate surroundings including the airport!).

By bus
Graz also has an excellent city bus network taking in the parts of Graz not serviced by trams. Many buses go through Jakominiplatz, Hauptbahnhof. The tickets are the same as for the tram. Be sure to get yourself a map (at Jakominiplatz) of the network if you plan to use it frequently. Also check out 

Ticket prices: Single ticket (available from the bus driver or vending machines in tram cars) € 2.30 (valid for one hour), day ticket (available from the driver) € 5.10 (valid for 24 h), weekly ticket € 14.30.

Note that throughout the central stations (the tram stations surrounding Hauptplatz/Kongress and Jakominiplatz), no ticket is needed in the tram lines.

Keep in mind that bus and tram services operate from 5am to midnight. The last cars for the the day in each direction usually leave at 23:30 from Jakominiplatz. Nightbuses operate only on Fridays and Saturdays and before public holidays. They leave from Jakominiplatz in all directions at 00:30, 01:30 and 02:30.

Regional bus 

Regional bus routes serve the rural area around Graz. Regional lines can be identified by their three-digit numbers (e.g. the airport lines 630 and 631). They offer bike transportation on most vehicles (which tram and city bus do not allow).

Bike
Graz is a city of cyclists, featuring an excellent network of cyclepaths. Due to this using a bike to get around (at least the central areas of Graz) is one of the best choices. It also helps that it does not rain a lot in Graz. Bikes may be rented, although if you are staying a bit longer buying a used one (and maybe reselling it) from one of the many bike stores may be cheaper (get one of the great restored vintage bicycles from Rebikel, Keplerstraße 55). Bike theft is a common problem in Graz, so take care that your bike is properly locked (if possible against a bar) when you are not using it. Also, if you are inexperienced bicycling around trams, take extra caution (especially noting that getting your wheel stuck in a tram rail could knock you down, with trams potentially coming right behind and beside you!). Counter-flow cycling (cycling in the "wrong" direction of a one-way street) is allowed almost everywhere in Graz - watch out for "one-way street"-signs with a small additional "ausgenommen Radfahrer" ("except cyclists") sign.

An online map of Graz for cyclists is available here: You can get a big map for cyclists from the Tourist info office (Herrengasse 16), at "Mobil Zentral" (Jakoministraße 1) or at the "Radstation" (Cycling station) next to the central railway station. 

Rental bicycles are available for example at the "Radstation" (German only) next to the central railway station (leave the station through the main exit, turn right, walk approx. 200 m) or from one of the shops of "Bicycle" (German only).

Moped, motorcyle, scooter
If you want to avoid trafic in Graz and go anywhere and park anywhere, you have a possibility to rent a scooter.
* Stuff to do.

Taxi 
Taxis are available 24 h a day. You can hail one on the street, go to a taxi rank or simply order one by phone. The taxi ranks with the best chances of getting a taxi day or night are "Hauptplatz" (Right side of City Hall) or "Hauptbahnhof". There is a base rate of €3-4 for all rides. Avoid taxis in the early morning and early evening when traffic congestion can make a taxi ride very expensive. A ten-minute taxi ride usually costs about €10. Taxis can be booked at the same price as on the street by calling 0316-878, 0316-889, 0316-222, 0316-2801. Here it is a taxi fare calculator for Graz with the official taxi fare.

Car 
If you can avoid it, just avoid it. Graz has areas with an inscrutable one-way system which makes it easy to get lost. Parking space in central areas are rare and subject to a fee from Monday to Friday (9.00am to 8.00pm, in front of Hauptbahnhof to 9pm) and on Saturday from 9am to 1pm. Tickets can be bought from ticket machines placed in every street. A ticket for half an hour costs €0.60 ("blue zones", "green zones" are a bit cheaper). The maximum parking duration in blue zones is three hours and in green zones one day. Be aware that there are a lot of 'ticket-police' around so don't even try to park without a valid ticket (Fine € 25). There are a number of underground car parks in the city centre for example under the Karmeliterplatz which is called Pfauengarten Parkgarage which is open 24h a day. A ticket for one hour costs €3,40, a 24h ticket costs €30.

Bars are concentrated around the old town as well as the Karl-Franzens-University to the east of the old town. The old town has a mixed audience while the bars around university are mostly attended by students.
In the old town you'll also find a few Irish pubs. Whereas the most Irish of them is O'Carolan's right next to the main square (Hauptplatz) others include Flann O'Briens and Molly Malone's. The Office is a very laidback and unique new addition to the Irish/British pub scene in Graz. The Office features regular live music and jam sessions, as well as the odd bit of Karaoke, and darts (steel - you know, the real ones from England) every Sunday.

If you visit Graz in winter try a Bockbier. But beware they are a lot stronger (6-8%) than the usual Austrian beers.

Styrian wine is one of best wines in the world. Especially the white wine. Try a glass of Welschriesling if you get the chance.
