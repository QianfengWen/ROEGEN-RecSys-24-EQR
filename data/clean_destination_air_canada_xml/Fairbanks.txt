Get in

By plane

By car

If you are driving up from Anchorage, the George Parks Highway is a beautiful trip. Plan plenty of time in your schedule for sight-seeing, meals and photographs. During the summer, when the roads are clear, the trip can easily be made in 7 or 8 hours, with stops for snacks and bathroom breaks - depending on road construction and motorhome-convoy-slowdowns. You will pass through on your way which is a popular attraction. However, if you plan to stay the night have reservations well in advance. By "lower-48" standards, accommodation near the park is either "4-star" or "rustic". Both can be pricey, but worth every penny, especially if you spend a day in the park.

Though many think Denali Park is the highlight of the trip there are long stretches of breath-taking beauty. It is not uncommon to see moose, caribou, dall sheep, bear, and other wildlife along the road - have your camera ready. There are plenty of gas stations scattered along the route, but as expected, the prices are much higher than in Anchorage or Fairbanks. Fill up before you leave.

There are several good places to eat along the way as well. Most places will have specialties like reindeer or buffalo on the menu as well as more traditional fare.

All in all, you should make the drive at least once. It's worth it.

This location offers a great balance of clear nights, occurrence frequency, and activity that draws people from all over the world. These beautiful and mysterious curtains can be seen from mid-August to April, and range in color from green to red to purple, with the brightest and most common being a yellow-green. Intensity varies from night to night, with the best displays happening in the late evening to the early hours of the morning. When the nights are clear and dark enough, there will be aurora visible an average of eight out of ten nights. If you stay a minimum of three nights and are actively out during the evening hours, your chances of seeing the aurora increase to 90%. Ask your accommodation's front desk if they offer a wake-up call if the aurora appears. No guarantees, but the longer you're here, the better your chances of seeing a great show.

Tours

If you are visiting Fairbanks mid-May through the end of September, there are several tours that allow tourists to learn the history and culture of Fairbanks. The tours described below are the most popular and advised tours to take while visiting Fairbanks. All major lodges in the area can set you up on a number of local tours. 

Riverboat Discovery is arguably the best tour you can take while staying in Fairbanks. This tour departs twice a day and lasts three and a half hours. You have the ability to go at 8:45AM or 2PM. While enjoying a beautiful day on the Chena River, you will have the opportunity to see and learn a lot about Alaskan Native culture and Fairbanks. This tour demonstrates a bush pilot airplane taking off from the Chena River. The tour stops for an hour at the Chena Indian Village where passengers are taken through a tour by Alaskan Native guides. The riverboat also stops at an Athabascan fishing village where passengers see how fish are cut and prepared. One of the most exciting aspects of this tour is that you are able to witness "Nuchalawoya," an Athabascan Indian term meaning "the wedding of two rivers"--in this case the Chena and Tanana Rivers. 

Gold Dredge 8 is another tour run by the Binkley family who also operate the Riverboat Discovery. This attraction, opened in summer 2012, combines the best of and expands on two already successful gold mining attractions, El Dorado Gold Mine and Gold Dredge No. 8. Located about twenty minutes outside of Fairbanks in Fox, you are taken on a two-hour tour of Alaska's gold mining history. Beginning on a small train, you will learn how miners historically panned for gold and how current gold miners operate. Meander through Gold Dredge No. 8. Described as either a floating workhorse or a mechanical gold pan, Gold Dredge No. 8 extracted millions of ounces of gold from the frozen Alaskan ground. Each person on the tour gets to pan for actual gold! Everyone finds gold and the staff at Gold Dredge 8 will weigh it for you to see how much you actually found. 

Fairbanks City Tour is available through Princess Tours, or any of the major lodges in the area. This tour runs everyday at 8:30AM and lasts for three hours. This tour takes you to downtown Fairbanks where you are able to tour Golden Heart Park and the Visitor's Center.

Events

The Midnight Sun Baseball Game is held every summer during Summer Solstice. The Alaska Goldpanners are the farthest north semi-professional baseball team.

Fairbanks Golden Days is a week long event that was created to celebrate the discovery of gold in Fairbanks in 1902. The event is usually held toward the end of July.

This parade showcases marching bands, antique cars, clowns, jugglers, and several decorated floats. Enjoy watching the parade as it goes through the heart of Fairbanks. During this week make sure you wear a Golden Days pin or take the risk of getting "arrested" and put in the Golden Days jail! 

Following the Golden Days Parade is the annual Rubber Duckie Race. Every year at this time 6,000 plastic yellow rubber duckies race the Chena River to win cash and prizes worth up to $30,000.

Another event, associated with golden days, is a "must see": The Red-Green Regatta. Picture 40+ homemade "boats" floating down the Chena River all created using liberal amounts of duct tape and imagination.
