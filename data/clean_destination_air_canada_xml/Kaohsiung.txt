Kaohsiung (高雄; Gāoxióng) is, with over 2.7 million inhabitants, the third most populated city in after and and is located in the south of the island. Kaohsiung is known for its harbor, although more for commercial than tourism reasons. Hence it is also known as the Harbor Capital (港都) of Taiwan. Its year-round fine weather and the low cost of living make Kaohsiung the place to visit.

Understand
Kaohsiung is Taiwan's third largest city and its largest port. Although its volume of shipping has declined steadily over the last few years, Kaohsiung is still the world's sixth largest cargo-container seaport, and with a state of the art cruise terminal scheduled to open in 2018, its harbor may be much busier soon. The city has high concentrations of heavy industry, including steel production, shipbuilding, and other exports that have led to Kaohsiung's relatively high levels of air pollution (though the situation has improved substantially in recent years). Unlike , Kaohsiung is a planned city with wide streets and less traffic congestion than the capital. In recent years, the city has made great strides in transforming itself from a primarily industrial city into a modern Asian metropolis, and several areas of the city, such as along the banks of the Love River (Ai He, 愛河), have benefited from major beautification projects under the tenure of former mayor Wu Den-yih. The city is often known as Taiwan's "Harbour Capital" (港都) because of its close connection and heavy reliance on the ocean and maritime transportation. It is also one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in Taiwan, with numerous designated bike paths running through the city's many parks.

Kaohsiung began in the 17th century as a small fishing village named "Takao" (打狗), derived from the local aboriginal name meaning "bamboo forest". The name was changed to "高雄" (meaning: "high hero") by the Japanese in 1921, also pronounced "Takao" in Japanese, as they found the original name of 打狗 ("beating the dog") to be vulgar. The modern name of "Kaohsiung" is the pronunciation of "高雄" in Mandarin.

In 1916, the Japanese remodeled it into Baroque stye and painted it white. This renovation was made as part of the expasion of Dagao port. The lighthouse has played a crucial role in guiding ships since 1918 during night sailing. 

*ChiHou Fort is a battery which was designed by English engineer. It was after the Cing (Qing) government took over Taiwan that the fort became a military base. The fort stationed a naval commander and one hundred soldiers. The battery was also armored with four British-made Armstrong breecholders weighing 6.5 tons each. The fort was occupied by the Japanese army in 1895. Subsequently, the cannons in the fort were dismantled and melted. Meanwhile the battery was abandoned. In 1988, Kaohsiung city government started to restore the battery and it was completed in 1992. As a result, a brand new Cihou battery finally reborn from the past to please the tourists.

Work

For foreigners, work in Kaohsiung usually falls into two branches. The majority of employment involves English as a Second Language (ESL) work in buxibans (cram schools), kindergartens and schools (public, private or university). Most of the others are businessmen and women in the employ of multinational corporations here to manage, oversee or deploy production in Taiwan for their home company abroad.

Substitute work is easily available for native English speakers and can be obtained through local postings in expatriate hangouts. More permanent teaching work is also available, especially in the summer and around Chinese New Year. Most buxibans require teachers to sign a 1-year contract and provide a work permit and ARC (Alien Residence Card). ARC holders are also covered under national health insurance. Without the proper paperwork - including a 4-year university degree - you cannot get an ARC and will need to leave the country every 2-4 months to renew your visa. You will also be working illegally, which involves a number of other inconveniences (including lack of phone and Internet access). It is also highly illegal for foreigner to work as teachers in kindergartens few provide work permits.

Eat

There are numerous seafood restaurants dotting the main street in Cijin Island, all offering the same fresh seafood for about NT100-200 per dish. It is a great idea to go in a small group and order a few dishes to try, probably one more dish than the number of people in your group. In the evening, a night bazaar goes into full swing. There are lots of little eats to eat as per Taiwan's night markets, BBQ squid, mochi to name a few are particularly good.

Stay safe

Kaohsiung's crime rate is much lower than probably any city of comparable size in the West, so tourists need not be too worried. Theft tends to be the most common form of criminal activity encountered by foreigners, and expensive bikes and scooters are frequent targets.

As a major seaport, organized crime has also become an increasing problem in the city, and a fair number of businesses are nothing more than a front for local gangs. That said, the gangs do not resort to random violence or theft. 

In general, Kaohsiung offers a very safe environment as long as you mind your own business and don't get involved with local rivalries. Violent crime is very rare, and visitors should not encounter any problems - though, like any major city, it is always wise to err on the side of caution.

Also, be aware of the traffic, as local drivers generally don't yield the right-of-way and don't stop at zebra-crossings. Motorcycles riding and parking on pavements / sidewalks (if they ever exist) are common in Taiwan.

Stay healthy

There have been cases of Dengue fever reported in the Kaohsiung area (around a hundred locally contracted cases in the first half of 2015). Take precautions against mosquitos.
