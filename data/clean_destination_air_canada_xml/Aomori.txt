Get in

By air
Aomori's airport is served by Japan Airlines. JAL flights arrive from Haneda Airport, Centrair Airport, Itami and Kansai Airports, Chitose Airport, and Fukuoka Airport. Buses connect the airport to the main train station for &yen;560. The bus ride lasts 35 minutes.

By train

Aomori is the northern terminus of Japan's Shinkansen train service. From , Tohoku Shinkansen Hayate (はやて) and Hayabusa (はやぶさ) trains run to Shin-Aomori station, from which regular trains shuttle passengers over to the more centrally-located Aomori station. The trip on the Hayate takes approximately 3 hours 40 minutes, including average transfer and waiting times at Shin-Aomori, while Hayabusa trains are slightly faster. Ticketed passengers are permitted to travel to Aomori station in the non-reserved car of any train, even if a limited express train heading towards Aomori departs first.

The regular one-way fare from Tokyo to Aomori is &yen;16,370 on the Hayate and &yen;16,870 on the Hayabusa, and so the better deal for the round-trip is to purchase a JR East Rail Pass (&yen;22,000 (12+)/11000 (6-11) for 5 non-consecutive days within a 14 day period). If your travel plans include other parts of the country, such as , the better option will be the regular Japan Rail Pass or a JR East-South Hokkaido Pass (&yen;27,000 (12+)/13500 (6-11) for 6 non-consecutive days within a 14 day period). Note that the Green Car version of the rail pass is valid for Green Cars on the Hayate and Hayabusa, but any version of the pass will cover just the basic fare for the premium first class seating on the Hayabusa called "GranClass". Travelers using "GranClass" will be pampered with an all-leather seat resembling business class on an airplane, a personal on-call train attendant, high-quality meals and complimentary alcoholic beverages. Japan Rail Pass holders willing to partake in such an experience must pay the Shinkansen express charge and GranClass surcharge (&yen;16,490 from Tokyo). Without a Rail Pass, "GranClass" costs &yen;26,360 between Tokyo and Aomori.

By bus
Aomori, at the northernmost point of Honshu, is the terminating point for several highway buses. 

From Station, JR Bus Tohoku's La Foret service runs once per night, reaching Aomori in 9 1/2 hours at a cost of &yen;9,000 each way on Fridays, Saturdays and the day before holidays, and &yen;8,500 on all other days. Konan Bus' Tsugaru runs over the same route; their bus costs &yen;7,500 each way, or &yen;9,000 during peak travel periods.

From Ueno Station in Tokyo, Konan Bus runs discounted bus services to Aomori: a daytime service called Sky (&yen;5,000) and two night services called Panda (&yen;4,500; &yen;5,000 during peak travel periods). These buses take longer to Aomori - about 11 hours each way - due to an additional stop made in .

 Willer Express operates several buses from Tokyo Station, Tokyo Disneyland and Shinjuku to Aomori with prices starting from about &yen;5,000. Bookings can be made online in English.

Four bus operators jointly run Blue City daytime buses between and Aomori (5 hours, &yen;5,700). There are more runs during the summer months than the rest of the year.

By boat
Seikan Ferry and Tsugaru Kaikyo Ferry operate ferry services from Aomori to the port of with multiple departures daily. One way fares are cheapest on the Seikan Ferry at &yen;1,500 for a carpet space. The Tsugaru Kaikyo ferries are more expensive: one way fares are &yen;2,700 for second class (carpet space), &yen;5,000 for first class and &yen;6,000 for special class. Note that first and special classes are only offered on specific departures and offer better amenities, such as a room with bed. Travel time on all services is approximately 3 hours, 45 minutes.

Get around
Taxis are always available from the train station.

Buses exist in Aomori, and while it can be confusing at first, getting around by bus is not too difficult. If you're starting at the bus terminal outside Aomori station, you can easily get English-language information on any bus route at the Tourist Information Counter next to the bus terminal. Also, if you're using the city bus on the weekend or a national holiday, you can buy a special one day pass for 500 yen that allows you to travel anywhere on a city bus. It's a great way to get around if you're planning to visit several places. The passes can be bought from the driver or in advance at the city bus counter, which is in the same building as the Tourist Information.

Anywhere around the downtown area is easily accessible on foot.

See

As with most outlying prefectural capitals, there isn't much to see in the city itself if you go in without knowing what to look for.

* Said to be Japan's biggest fire festival. This festival includes an abundance of street vendors. Each day culminates in a huge parade featuring lit up lantern floats and costumed dancers.

* This museum houses exhibits about the Nebuta if you're unable to make it during festival season.

* A symbol of Aomori city that incorporates many "A" shapes into its design. It is lit up at night with colorful lights. There is a stairwell accessible from the waterfront area that provides nice free views of the bay.

* A large triangular building that can be easily spotted from the train station or the bridge, this is the tourism center for all of Aomori prefecture. It includes a movie about the prefecture (Japanese only) and an observation deck with views of the harbor and city (extra charge).

* This memorial alongside the ferry terminal looks like it might honor some historical event or local hero, but it's actually dedicated to a song. Meaning "Tsugaru Strait winter scenery", the 1977 hit ballad is an all-time karaoke favorite.

* Houses exhibits about the history of Aomori prefecture.

* A nice aquarium that features a dolphin show and a transparent underwater tunnel.

* A hot springs resort on Mutsu bay with a rather large number of inns.

* A historical site dedicated to the Jomon people, as many Jomon artifacts have been uncovered here.

* The ferry which connected Hokkaido and Aomori prior to the building of the Seikan Submarine Tunnel, is now a somewhat run down museum, a short walk from the train station. The rear part of the deck of the ferry serves as a beer garden on summer nights.

*A well maintained museum that has a surprisingly big collection.

*Everything you wanted to know about the Nebuta Matsuri and more in one musuem. Floats, drums, dancers as well as exhibits about other parts of Aomori culture. This musuem exhibit is similiar in content to the Neputa Mura in Hirosaki.

Do
* This is Aomori's most famous festival. It is held in early August.

Buy
For loading up on regional souvenirs, head to ASPAM, the unusual-looking triangular building located just behind the bridge on the harbor. It contains an exhibition hall for promoting tourism and local products. Alternatively, check out A Factory, which also stocks a wide range of local products. There's also a small food court and an apple cidery, where you can sample the local brew.

Eat
Aomori's specialties include a miso-curry-milk ramen, Tsugaru Ramen (made with niboshi, a type of dried fish, in the broth), apple pies, apple cider, and various other apple based products.

* This is a small restaurant with very good Indian food. It is difficult to find but worth the search. The restaurant is not directly on the road; it is tucked in with a small parking lot and has a small but incredibly garish sign.
* For vegans, offers a delicious lunch and sweets from Tuesday to Saturday, 11am to 4pm. It's not in the city centre but is easily accessed by bus or taxi.

Drink
* This hotel has a bar on the top floor, with a nice view of the bay bridge and the Aspam center. As far as hotel bars go, this one is quite reasonably priced.

* A large karaoke chain that has a branch about four or five blocks down the main street on the left. This location has a nice selection of English songs and, of course, offers all you can drink plans.

* The Gusto chain is always a safe bet for foreign travelers. It is similar to the Denny's and Jonathan's chains in Japan and not too different from the Denny's or Perkin's restraunt chains in America. Gusto is often the best option for the weary traveler due to its late hours and relaxed atmosophere (as well as the farmiliar menu items, all with pictures). Cafe Skyline Gusto is across from the Aomorikan Hotel, down a street or two. It has pretty standard fare in terms of Japanese breakfast food (toast with mayonnaise and eggs), but also features bacon and sausage as sides to eggs (most expensive is &yen;499). In addition, you can also get a stack of three pancakes or two pancakes with condensed milk, banana and maple syrup (both are roughly &yen;450). Gusto is particularly know for the drink bar (included with most set menu items), which includes milk, a wide variety of juices (remember Aomori is famous for their apples!) as well as the coffee machine, which dispenses cappuccino, American style coffee as well as espresso. The bar is self-serve, and makes for an easy morning. The drink bar by itself is roughly &yen;350, so buying breakfast is worth it for the drink service alone.

*Carpe Diem is a foreigner friendly bar with premiership football and curry made by a Calcutta chef. Free internet.

Sleep
Numerous hotels dot Shinmachi, the main street that stretches out from the train station. These hotels generally increase in price the closer you get to the train station. 

* This hotel is probably the closest and most expensive of these hotels. It is on the left as you begin down Shinmachi.
*Sato San likes her guests and will take good care of you in this ryokan. For the location is is hard to beat but the facilities are a bit old and spartan.

Contact
The city tourist information center is located next to the bus stop on the left as you exit the train station; they have good brochures and maps in English. You can pick up the free Northern Tohoku Welcome Card here, which gets you discounts on transport and attractions.
