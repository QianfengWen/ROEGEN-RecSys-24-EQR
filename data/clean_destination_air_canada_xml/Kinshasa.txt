Kinshasa is the capital of the . 

Understand

Kinshasa has the largest population of any city proper in Africa with a population of 10,076,099, and ranks as its third largest metropolitan area. It's also the largest French-speaking city proper in the world (by any other measure, it still ranks second behind the Paris urban area). After decades of armed conflicts imposed by neighbouring countries, the infrastructures of the once leading modern African city are now being remarkably restored. Chinese companies are involved in numerous projects of reconstruction throughout the city. 

It's a common misconception that because Congo is 'poor' services and product should be cheap. This couldn't be further from the truth. Congo is extremely expensive and very hard to travel if you don't speak French or don't know the local customs. Many backpackers who have traveled a lot disregard advise of old timers and find themselves quickly in problems where they are in jail and pay heavy sums of money for not understanding the customs. Be prepared to pay some of the highest prices in Africa to travel around.

Get in

By plane
South African Airways, Kenya Airways, Ethiopian airlines and Royal Air Maroc each have a number of flights per week from their hubs in , , and .

Connections to can be made with Air France from , , Brussels Airlines from in , Turkish Airways from Istanbul and Royal air Maroc from Casablanca in Morocco. Hewa Bora also offered flights to and from Europe until they were placed upon the EU's no-fly blacklist. 

The Kinshasa airport used to have a terrible reputation for corrupt officials asking for bribes. They have improved things and it is quite manageable. Just follow everyone else and try not to look like a tourist! A yellow fever vaccination certificate is essential. Watch out for being mobbed by volunteer 'helpers' once you are outside the airport, who will want to carry your bags in return for tips.

Keep in mind that when returning to the airport to leave you can not drive your car or take a cab onto the airport property without paying for parking / access $5 or $10. You also need to pay an airport tax of 55 usd to leave the country. 

A taxi into town will probably cost you $50-100 (usually without air conditioning!). It is an hour's drive into the centre of Kinshasa, but it can take several hours longer because of huge traffic jams. Best option is to get a shuttle offered by one of the travel companies on the right outside the arrivals door.

By train
The railways of Congo once covered the entire country during colonial times, but have fallen in to heavy disuse. While there is a central train station in Kinshasa, train service is erratic at best and does not run to many destinations for tourists. Tickets are usually only able to be bought the day of travel shortly before the train arrives and can prove to be difficult to get.

Kinshasas main train station is located on Place de la Gare which is at the end of Boulevard du 30 juin.

By bus
You can go by bus, which really isn't the best choice.

By car
Apart from the road from Matadi to Kinshasa, a car is no means for overland travel. You might be successful with a 4x4 in the upper northern region (Bangassou - Nia Nia - Isiro). All other towns are accessible only by air transport or boat.

By boat
You can arrive by boat from if you have a visa. There are speed boats that go quickly for a limited number of people, or you can take the barge with local merchants if you have time. Ask to go to "the Beach", which is the ferry terminal. The passage is $50 per way with the speed boats (can't rapide). Note that the speed boats stop moving when it rains. This border crossing is horrible and it's best to hire assistance from an agency to help you through the formalities.

Get around

Officially there is a city bus and it has been bolstered recently by some older buses from Belgium being gifted to Kinshasa to improve the routes. This system pales in comparison to the "taxi" system that has risen organically to serve the needs of the people of Kinshasa.

Essentially, these taxis are small buses. They run set routes between embarkation points that are the "stops". The cost between these various points is usually around 500 - 1000 Francs. If one's destination is through multiple points, different taxis will need to be boarded to complete the route, making the system take a good deal of time during busy traffic hours.

People waiting at the stops will move their hands in a variety of gestures to signal which direction they are going. A taxi will then stop and pick up someone if they are going in the same direction and have space in the taxi.

This system works well for the locals. For visitors and foreigners, it can be quite difficult as one needs to know the hand signs, have knowledge of the routes, be ready to sit in cramped, hot vehicles with many other people, and deal with the potential dangers of these vehicles as many are barely road-worthy. Traveling through this manner absolutely requires local help for those unfamiliar with the system. One will also have to speak French or Lingala as the drivers do not speak English.

There are also traditional taxis for hire. They are available for single runs or can be hired by the day. This can be a tricky business and should be handled with care (especially at the airport) as there are those will take people to remote locations and rob them. Again, help from a local is best or using drivers that others in the area have past experience with and trust. Rates for these taxis vary widely and if one does not appear to be of African descent, there will also be an automatic premium added. The average price for a taxi is 3 to 5 usd for short travels within the center, 10 usd for a longer traject and 15 to 20 usd for long distances with heavy traffic.

Renting a car in Kinshasa is very expensive. A normal 4x4 with driver can easily cost 300 - 400 usd without fuel or more if you want a more luxurious car. To rent a car outside the city can run up to 500 - 600 usd per day without gas and also paying for your driver his hotel and food on the way.

* It is a small village in the eastern part of the city's rural area. It's on the RN1 (Boulevard Lumumba), farther than the airport. It has a nice restaurant area where you can enjoy all the local food on a terrace. A lot of people come here to relax, so there are a lot of people trying to get you into their business. If you go closer to the river, there's a fish market where food from the river is brought. Be careful if you want to take pictures; you'll probably have to pay someone first as this is considered the international border.

* Rent a boat for the day with a driver and all the gear (tables, chairs, a sun tent, and a BBQ) at the Yacht Club Kinshasa or through an agency. Due to heavy taxes and the rise in fuel prices, taking a boat from Kinshasa is becoming very expensive. It is better to take a boat outside of town near Maluku or Kinkole.

Learn
Lingala is the local language spoken in this region beyond French. Learning a bit goes a long way to befriending locals.

Work
Work in Kinshasa has been plentiful since December 2012 and still is now in the year 2013. However, roughly 60 percent of the people in Kinshasa work in informal jobs such as selling food, drinks, clothes, jewelry, etc. on the streets or in markets. Another 30 percent work in jobs a little better such as being hotel butlers, construction workers, chefs, shopkeepers, or taxi/bus drivers.

Only 10 percent pursue formal careers such as doctors, teachers, mall owners, hotel owners, businessmen/women, politicians, celebrities, and journalists.

Buy
The US Dollar (USD) is the prevalent currency for most transactions of any significant quantity. Payment in USD for a purchase will likely return change to you in USD for denominations greater than $5-$10. Lesser amounts, and any remainder, will be paid in Congolese Francs (approx 2.000 fr per $USD1, as of July 2022). Dollar bills of 1 USD and 2 USD are not accepted. Old 100 USD bills are also not accepted. If a bill has a tear in it, it won't be accepted either. 

Credit cards are not widely accepted - do not count on them to keep you afloat. Only major hotels (i.e., Congo Fleuve, The Memling) and some supermarkets will accept them (if there are no connectivity issues). 
Cash can be withdrawn from the PRO CREDIT Bank with a valid international VISA ATM card. Denominations are distributed in USD and/or CF. Ensure that you have notified your bank of your intentions to travel in order to ensure seamless and unhindered use of foreign ATMs.

Don't forget to get some art in Le marché des valeurs, sometimes called marché des voleurs... the first calling means market of value, the second in changing only one letter means market of thieves. Be prepared to haggle, and don't pay the initial asking price: that will be at least 60-75% over the final price, if not more. For some more upmarket art, you can go to the Academie des Beaux Arts on Avenue Pierre Mulele (formerly Avenue 24 Novembre) or to Symphonie des Arts: towards Kintambo on the Boulevard du 30 Juin, turn right after the elephant when you see the barrier on your right then it's on your left hand across from the big colonial villa. A more time-consuming but far more interesting and personal way to get to know the artists of the country would be to visit their private studios. Prices are high even there for paintings of Lema Kusa, Henri Kalama, or Nshole, but worth every penny considering the quality of their works and their international career.

Eat
Lots of restaurants for 'expats' exist, where you can pay in dollars but it is very expensive. Don't be surprised to pay up to $20 for a pizza (and $40 at the hotel for one). 

Budget
* A Lebanese restaurant in the center of town. They have shwarma sandwiches, taboule, hummus, and desserts as well.
* A chain of South African western-style fast food establishments. Burgers, shwarma. The food is nothing to write home about but the restaurants are clean and affordable and the staff is polite. Picture menus are a plus.

Mid-range
The freshwater prawns from the Congo river are incredible - called Cossa Cossa on menus (as distinct from imported saltwater prawns which are Gambas) - generally served with a garlic and chili (pili-pili) butter sauce. A plate of these will set you back around $25-$40 dollars depending where you eat. 
* 
* Portuguese-style. At the upper end of the mid-range - the food is varied and excellent and if you want to splash out, you can also order imported items like foie gras and European wines.
* Jardin d'Eden is a restaurant and music bar by the shores of the Nsele River. It is farther than Kinkole, after the airport. There is a really relaxing atmosphere there. You can eat, listen to the live band playing Congolese classics, or even take a boat on the river Nsele. The food and drinks are affordable for the middle class.
* Outdoor tables arranged around a swimming pool-great settings and mediocre food. Greek items an pizza as well as the usual dishes. There is also bar.
* Traditional and international food. Outdoor dining with a view of the pool. Expensive but great country-club-type setting. Packed with visiting ex-pats and Lebanese families hanging by the pool on weekends.
* Lebanese-owned Italian restaurant and possibly the hottest spot in town for ex-pats and well-heeled locals. The restaurant is hidden behind high walls and provides refuge from the general chaos of Kinshasa streets. Pizza, and pasta
* Probably one of the oldest restaurants in the city. Has a nice bar and very nice food. The owner is an ex-pat who has been in Kinshasa for many years and therefore has a lot of interesting stories to tell.

Splurge
* A high-class restaurant belongs to the golf club.

Drink
Do not drink water from the tap. Bottled water is readily available. Also, when cleaning your teeth make sure that you use bottled water.

Local beer - Turbo King is a darker beer, regular lagers are Primus (which some feel is the best local beer, brewed by the local Heineken brewery) and Skol. European Mutzig comes in smaller bottles! A bit more expensive, and slightly harder to find as it is brewed in Lubumbashi by Simba Breweries, is Tembo, a tasty amber ale preferred by locals and expats alike. Tembo garners the highest ranking for a DRC beer on ratebeer.com. Lots of expensive French and South African wines are available in restaurants and supermarkets. Portuguese plonk goes for as low as $3 a bottle at grocery stores catering to ex-pats (Peloustore, Express, etc.).

A more relaxed and fun way to have a beer at Surcouf: it's on the street off Boulevard 30 Juin towards Justice off the INSS building. Sit at a table and have a drink (Primus is recommended) and the artists will come and show all kinds of artwork all the time. The same rule for negotiating applies as at Marché des valeurs.

Kinshasa becomes alive most nights when residents head to Matonge, a place filled with dancing bars, restaurants, and nightclubs. Lately, Bandal and Bonmarche are the more popular quartiers to visit the local bars and "discotheques". Go to a local nightclub and learn how to dance Congolese rhythms. Get ready to shake your booty! For those that prefer to stay in Gombe, the following offer good possibilities:

Sleep
Accommodation in Kinshasa can be very expensive. A consequence of the past problems mean that many organizations only recognize two hotels as having international standards. So the Memling and the Grand have a virtual monopoly. Prices of these two can be in excess of $300 per night plus breakfast. Now a new luxury Hotel called Hotel Royal has opened. Modern boutique hotel with all amenities inclusive and rates between 200 and 250 USD.

Budget
* Power is intermittent and water is supplied in buckets. Get a room that opens to the outside. Everyone knows this big building on the main road.
* This catholic monastery has a large compound right in the middle of town, close to the river and H&F supermarket, opposite American and Portuguese embassies. They have basic but spacious rooms with air-conditioning and showers. Restrooms shared. Breakfast included. Dinner is optional. Very nice, quiet garden and a comfortable bar.

Mid-range
* Bar & Restaurant, gym.
* Very clean hotel, with nice rooms each with a modern bathroom and aircon.
* 
* Hotel has a swimming pool.
* Confort maison d’une résidence privée. Situé à Kinshasa sur l’avenue 18 Parcelles dans le quartier résidentiel du Palais des Marbres, San Pedro est une résidence privée, d’un charme discret et d’un confort simple, réaménagée en petit hôtel, idéal pour les voyageurs à la recherche d’une atmosphère intime et paisible comme à la maison.

Splurge
* Small guesthouse with just nine rooms offering a calm oasis right next to several European embassies and a block away from the Congo river. Free wifi included.
* Opened in fall 2012 after a lenghty renovation and sets a new high for luxury hotels in Congo, even all of central Africa and has already been visited by the head of states. 237 rooms including 30 suits and several on-suite restaurants, entertainment includes a jazz bar and outdoor light shows. Large conference halls are available.
* It is definitely the best hotel in town, located next to Elais; unfortunately, it tends to be fully booked well in advance. All Elais amenities can be used.
* 
* One of the best and second most expensive hotels in town. Has been around since 1937, and has since then maintained its place as the city's Number One venue - now that's a real reference, on this side of the river. Wireless Internet throughout, a nice but small pool, a bar and restaurants, and good Belgium food. 24-hour access to the Internet. Hertz car rentals are at the hotel, along with mobile phone companies, gift shops, and the usual souvenirs. With excellent conference facilities, the hotel is located within 5 to 10 minutes of the city's main business and political ventures.
* Luxury boutique hotel in Kinshasa. Restaurant, cafe, Cigar Lounge, 250p Conference center, right at the heart of City Centre next to Brussels Airlines Office, reservations@hotelroyaldrc.com, airport transfer payable and upon request. Excellent European cuisine, and a sumptuous breakfast buffet.
* The Sultani Hotel is a hotel in the city center of Kinshasa, close to the River Congo. There is wireless Internet included in the price and provided throughout the hotel. It is very attractive compared to the other hotels. The hotel offers a business lunch which is quite rare to get in the very expensive city of Kinshasa. The team is motivated and speaks English, French, German, and Chinese.

Contact
Kinshasa has a good phone network One of the things it's famous for is phones.

Stay healthy
Don't drink the local water. Bottled water seems to be cheap enough but sometimes hard to find for a good price. The best way is if you are staying in an upscale hotel that provides it with the room .

Make sure you have all required vaccinations - i.e. yellow fever, typhoid, etc.

Mosquitoes can be a problem in the entire city. Malaria medication should be taken.

Stay safe

When traveling by car, always lock all the doors before you set off, as it is not uncommon for opportunistic thieves to try to open them and snatch belongings. For the same reason, keep bags and valuables out of reach and out of sight. 

It is highly recommended that you have someone with you at all times--that is, a local (besides when you are in your hotel). Taxi drivers will usually stay with you too when going to local shops and making quick stops, and they will serve as your translator if you get a good one. Be careful with any equipment you have with you such as digital cameras and video equipment. Be careful also of what you take pictures of. Even if they say no photos only at the airport and of government buildings, a lot of times the police and UN people will get upset if you are taking videos at other places where technically it is supposed to be ok to do. Just be sure to have plenty of locals with you who know what they are doing and can provide security and a way out if you get stuck or in trouble. Follow their advice and pay attention when out and about. When in doubt about taking a photo of something, don't, until you get very clear instructions that it is ok. Don't keep cameras in open view unless you've been cleared to take a photo. Also be equally prepared for hostility and positive reactions when taking photos.

If you are approached by people claiming to be police, be wary. If they are not in uniform, they are probably not police but are most likely hoping to relieve you of your money and valuables. A common tactic is for a group of men in a car to show a fake police identity card and ask you to go with them to the police station. Do not get in the car; just walk away. Be prepared to run. Never lose your temper, but keep negotiating in a friendly way; in the end, they will give up.

Recent road scams have included a group of fake police officers in an unmarked 4x4 vehicle that will pull over unsuspecting people driving alone in cars, and then forcibly take them into their vehicle, drive them out to the country, rob them of everything, and leave them stranded. Whereas the main targets have been UN staff in obvious white UN vehicles, all foreigners driving should be wary of this group or others operating like them. For general safety, people should never drive alone in vehicles, especially after dark.
