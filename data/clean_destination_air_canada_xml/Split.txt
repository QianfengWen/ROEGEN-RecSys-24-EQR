Split is a city in Central , . The city was originally built around the Diocletian palace (a palace/fort built for the retired Roman emperor Diocletian) where the locals sought refuge centuries ago. Despite initial appearances, however, the city is not a small tourist town, and extends over a large area well beyond the ancient core. With over 300,000 people in the wider bay area, it's the economic hub of the eastern Adriatic shoreline (the unofficial "capital" of Dalmatia).
Wandering the historic centre of Split you can still clearly see the Roman walls, squares, and temples.

Understand

Because of its ideal climate, with 2,800 hours of sunlight each year, local people have a few nicknames for Split: "The most beautiful city in the world" and "Mediterranean flower". Many famous Croatian sports people are born in Split, so locals often nicknamed their city as "The sportiest city in the world". The most popular sport institution is the football club Hajduk. The whole city is painted with the club's colors and logo. This is done by Torcida, the oldest supporters group in Europe, established in 1950.
Beside bell tower of St. Duje, the symbols of city are the Dalmatian dog and a donkey. Locals have a high place for the donkey because of its past indispensable place in field work and transport across Dalmatian mountains.

Split is much, much larger than other coastal towns (Rovinj, Pula, Zadar, Sibenik) and has modernized as the city has grown. If you're expecting the same charm as these cities and towns, you will be disappointed. 

Winters in Split are generally mild, with temperatures above 0°C, but despite the popular saying that the city experiences snowfall once every 30 years, there is actually at least one snowy day nearly every winter, usually in January or early February. If you find yourself in Split on a day with significant snowfall, expect serious traffic disruption.

Get in

By plane

Split Airport () () is, after Zagreb Airport, the most important in Croatia. A brand new terminal, with significantly increased capacity, was inaugurated in 2019. Scheduled services fly to major European cities, with summer charter flights from more. The airport is about 25 km west from Split, near the city of . It has free WiFi internet. Airport buses run from the terminal to the city and stop at the eastern end of 'Riva'. A single ticket costs 30 kn. Local buses run from the road outside the terminal -- walk through the parking lot and go to the bus stop on the other side of the road. 

Bus number 37 runs about every 30 min (from the outdoor public bus stop across the main road from the terminal - note: not the covered inter-city bus station accessed from inside the terminal) and costs 21 kn as of August 2021 (tickets are bought from the bus driver - exact change not needed but please do not give them large notes). Bus 37 does not take you all the way to the historical centre and you need to switch to buses 2, 3, 9, 10, 15 or 17 or just walk about a kilometre along the major road that runs by the bus stop. In addition, a small fraction of the departures from Split main bus station to Trogir on work days use the road next to the airport. In the on-line timetables search for ZRAČNA LUKA-AIRPORT (but take into account that the timetable is not necessarily 100% correct). Going to the airport, onboard the bus tell the conductor that you want a stop at the airport. Alternatively, you can find a PDF including timetable and route of line 37 in both directions on the upper right corner of 

A shuttle bus run by Pleso Transport Company operates between the airport and the main bus station in the city centre, next to the ferry port and the train station. If you ask locals for directions they will automatically point you towards this bus, but beware if you are traveling with another airline then this bus schedule is a bit irrelevant. A single ticket costs 35 kn (euros accepted at exactly 5 euro per ticket. As of June 2021, it appears as if the shuttle bus meets all scheduled arriving flights even those not from Croatia Airlines and goes up to every 10 minutes in peak season. When exiting the terminal go to your left and you should see the buses. The bus stops at the central bus station by the port at a dedicated stop with an "AIRPORT" sign and tickets are supposed to be bought at the counter in the bus station (though the driver will often agree to sell you one). If you buy a ticket at the counter, the price increases by a few Kuna because you a pay a station fee, but you are, in theory, guaranteed a seat. Buses to the airport are often fully booked during the summer and if possible, you should buy the ticket a day or two in advance. If the bus is full, you will not be able to buy a ticket for that departure from the counter. However, some drivers (not all) allow standing passengers and cram in as many as possible, and sell additional tickets themselves. For an up-to-date schedule, ask at a Tourist Information Center or see the bus station website.

Taxis, Uber and Bolt will also take you into town. Taxi ride to Split center (ferry port or Diocletian's Palace) takes a bit over 40 min and costs about 300 kn on the meter. Unlike most cities getting a taxi to the airport can prove more expensive than getting one from it: In october 2019 the metered rate from a taxi near the Diocletan palace to the airport cost 345 kuna (roughly 46 euro) on the meter, with a proper receipt given. When enquiring about the price before the ride the driver indicated it would be 300-350 kuna depending on traffic, so this high price seems to be the norm. Uber and Bolt indicated a very similar amount for the same trip, and the driver indicated he'd be heavily fined if driving you to the airport without the meter running.

If your transferring to a ferry tell the driver the ferry departure time so they can rush if necessary. Most of the taxis also have a preorder option for a cheaper price. 
For 0-24 coverage, there are many options.

If leaving Split by plane, be careful to plan the journey to the airport in advance, as local buses don't run before 5 AM or after midnight.

Flights to and from , were reintroduced in June 2012 after a 21-year hiatus. As of July there are four flights per week. As expected, there is massive demand for these planes, so book with Croatia Airlines or Air Serbia well in advance in order to get a cheaper ticket. If you are seated next to the window, you can catch a magnificent glimpse of from 21,000 feet.

By train

Split train station is right in the city center, it is a few minutes walk from the port and from the old town. Expect very friendly grannies to be waiting with signs saying "Sobe" (rooms) at all arrivals and they will jump on anyone with a backpack. The train station is rather basic, because train travel is not much used to Split.

Trains run between Split and Zagreb, Split and Perković (where you can change for Šibenik). Timetables can be found from Croatian Railways website Trains are generally slower but slightly cheaper than buses in all of Croatia. There is also a direct night train from Budapest during the summer.

Trains to Perković through the picturesque valley/village of Primorski Dolac depart 5 times a day and stop in every station taking 1 hr exactly to do the journey. This is a very picturesque journey to make, and although Perković is simply a collection of houses you could get off and have a coffee or go for a walk in the hills before returning to Split. Connecting Trains leave Perković for Šibenik several times a day, and should be marked on the timetable in Split station.

By bus

Frequent buses run to and from , , , , etc. There are also regular buses to and from (125 KN, buses start leaving Split at 06:00) and () (210 kn), (), () and major cities of and . You can get detailed information on AK Split [about departure and arrival times.

In the summer season there are more lines then off-season, for example in June-July-August, daily
night buses to and , north of , as well as buses to , twice a week.

On most intercity buses you pay a fee for luggage. This fee of about €0.5-€1 (7 KN, July 2013) per piece of luggage is paid to the driver upon boarding. Some drivers are rather picky about being paid in exact change in the correct currency (sometimes a local currency, at other instances requesting to be paid in Euros) and sometimes also refuse to be paid in too small coins - so keep some change ready!

Bus run from to from door to door by Eurobusways [Local buses run to and from and .

By boat

The main ferry companies are Jadrolinija, Kapetan Luka and Krilo Shipping Company. The main ferry booking platfrom is RAFT Croatia. Prices are fixed, but note that year-round lines are cheaper than seasonal lines. This means, for example, that a ticket Split-Hvar is 55 Kuna when taking the year-round departure but 110 Kuna (twice as expensive!) if taking a departure that only runs during the summer. Speedboat (catamaran) routes have limited spots for passengers and may sell out. Car-ferries have limited spots for cars and also limited amount of pedestrians. During summer season, personal vehicles have advantage over other types of vehicles to board the ferry.

By Cruise Ship

Split is a popular stop on a lot of cruise itineraries. Larger ships tend to anchor in the bay and tender passengers to shore very close to the Old Town. Occasionally, if there is room and the Captain is willing/able, cruise ships will squeeze in to dock at a spare pier in the main port, removing the need to tender to shore. If this happens on your cruise, allow about a 15min walk to reach the Old Town.

In 2017, a new berth specifically for cruise ships was constructed, and most ships now dock there, at the southern end of the harbor. It takes approximately 15 minutes to walk to the city center.

See 

* Diocletian's Palace (UNESCO heritage site) - The historic centre of Split is built around the remains of this Roman palace. You only need to wander around to experience it but you can also pay to visit the excavated remains of the basement of the palace. The palace has well preserved main streets cardo and decumanus. Roman palace is enriched with some gothic and reinassance buildings which makes a perfect match. Palace has 4 monumental gates Porta Aurea (Zlatna vrata, Golden gate), Porta Argenta (Srebrna vrata, Silver gate), Porta Ferrea (Željezna vrata, Iron gate) and Porta Aenea (Mjedena vrata. Bronze gate). It is probably the best preserved Roman palace in general.

*St. Duje's cathedral - Originally built around 305 AD as a mausoleum for the Roman emperor Diocletian (the oldest cathedral building in the world). The Cathedral is also a very beautiful mixture of Roman temple and Catholic church. It also has a beautiful belltower which provides you a great panoramic view of Split, nearby islands and Marjan hill.

*Peristil square (Peristylium) - Main square of Diocletian's palace with well preserved Roman architecture.

*Jupiter's temple - Ancient Roman temple which became St. John's church.

*Two original Egyptian sphinxes- One is located on Peristil square, and the other in front of Jupiter's temple or St. John's church. They were brought from Egypt by Roman emperor Diocletian.

*Riva is the main city promenade. Since 2007. Riva has a new, "modern" look, which is not accepted by most of the people. 

*Marjan - a hill situated on the west of Split. Marjan is an oasis for many people who look for a natural stress relief, a great place for long walks, jogging, and bike rides. Marjan's peak, Telegrin is 174 m high and gives a wonderful panoramic view of Split. South cliffs are popular within alpine climbers. St. Nicholas church is situated on the east of Marjan, on it's south side are beautiful St. Jeronimus church and "Gospe od Betlema" church (Madonna of Betlehem). There is a small "zoo" located on the hill that keeps mostly endemic animals of the area on display - realistically it's more like a petting zoo featuring goats, donkeys, birds and turtles kept in enclosures that would not really meet western standards. 

House building is strictly forbidden in order to save Marjan - the lungs of Split. 

*Varoš - one of the oldest parts of town. A place where lived most of the city peasants and fishermen. Charming streets and and beautiful small houses. 

*Galerija Meštrović - gallery contains works of Ivan Meštrović, famous Croatian sculptor.

*Poljud stadium known to locals as "Poljudska Ljepotica" (Poljud Beauty")is a second largest stadium in Croatia and has a capacity of 36,000 people. The stadium was originally constructed by the Yugoslavian government as part of the facilites for the 1979 Mediterannean Games and was officially opened by Josip Broz Tito, who was avowed fan of the team who play their home games in Poljud HNK Hajduk Split. By far the most important and revered sports team in Dalmatia, a dedicatet fanbase around the world has followed Hajduk throughout the team's history. There are numerous anecdotes about Hajduk never played without at least some of their loyal fans in the stands, the Torcida. It is the oldest supporters group in Europe. If you are going to visit some match do not go on north part, which is the cheapest one, that part is reserved for Torcida.

*is the smallest park in Split, situated in the Diocletian's palace (only green area inside the city walls), Dominisova street (Marko Antonio De Dominis street). In the park there are beautiful traditional Dalmatian tiramolas (that is a way how the locals dry their clothes). During the summer these are full of clothes drying in the sunshine. In every guidebook about Split you have pictures from the Getski vrtal. It is the location of a 500 year old stone house which was destroyed during World War II. On the facade facing towards Getski vrtal you can see two heads made of stones. One of the heads is a sphinx with a Christian cross on the forehead and second one is head of middle age thief. Getski (from ghetto) vrtal (garden) is made and maintained by the locals who live in houses near by.

There are also beaches around hill Marjan. Most popular are Kaštelet, Kašjuni and beautiful pine forest beach Bene. On Bene beach there is a restaurant and a recreation centre. Bus No. 12 travels there.

* Climb the campanile bell tower next to the palace mausoleum. The stairs cling to the inside of the tower, and in places the steps cross the large open window spaces.

* The historic core of Split with Diocletian palace is among the first urban complexes to enter the list of the UNESCO world heritage in year 1979. Most probably this one of a kind Imperial Palace was built from 298-305 AD and is one of the most significant original structures of the period mostly because so much of it has been preserved. Later this Palace contributed to the broadening of the town because as the city evolved beyond its walls. The unique substructure halls were newley explored and each year more of them are opened to the public. Some have fascinating artefacts on display. May - Oct 10AM-12 noon-7PM (?).

Most of them operate from ACI marina Split, marina Zenta or marina Spinut. There are also many charter agencies based in marina which is based in the vicinity of Split.

When you charter a yacht through a charter agency and arrive to the designated marina there are a few things that need to be done. 

The most important thing is the yacht check in (usually Saturday around 4PM). Take your time doing yacht check in. Familiarise yourself with the chartered yacht and with the yacht equipment. The rule of thumb is the more time you take for the yacht check in, the less time you will need for the yacht check out. 

After that you have to do the shopping for the charter vacation. Don't neglect the groceries shopping because the sea is unpredictable and you don't want to get stuck on the boat without sufficient provisions of food and drink.

You can do the shopping in a marina although the prices are usually much higher there, or you can order from yacht provisioning services who usually deliver the products to the marina at no extra fee. In Jam Yacht Supply offer an online provisioning catalogue and you can order from a large selection of groceries and other products months in advance, everything you order awaits for you at the marina.

Look for Croatians holding signs or greeting tourists at the bus station or ferry port and ask about their accommodations. They will want to know how many people are in your party and how many nights you would like to stay. You will want to ask how many beds are in the room, where exactly the rental is located (travel with a map and ask them to point out the exact location), and the approximate price. Some haggling over the price is common, and you should ask to see the room before finalizing a price or handing over payment. Rentals typically include sheets and towels and do not include breakfast. It is normal to be asked to hand over your passport upon arrival. Hosts are required to use your passport register your presence with the local police, and they should return your documents within a few minutes.

Stay safe

Do not go to striptease bars because they are a tourist trap.

Beware of the area around the main bus terminal. There are many people there, tourists and locals alike. Pickpocketing do happen there and the local police do not seem to be doing much about it; no patrolling etc.

*Klis - Klis Fortress (Croatian: Tvrđava Klis) is a medieval fortress situated above a village bearing the same name, about 10km the city of Split, in central Dalmatia, Croatia. From its origin as a small stronghold built by the ancient Illyrian tribe Dalmatae, becoming a royal castle that was the seat of many Croatian kings, to its final development as a large fortress during the Ottoman wars in Europe, Klis Fortress has guarded the frontier, being lost and re-conquered several times throughout its more than two thousand year-long history. Due to its location on a pass that separates the mountains Mosor and Kozjak, the fortress served as a major source of defense in Dalmatia, especially against the Ottoman advance, and has been a key crossroad between the Mediterranean belt and the Balkan rear. Klis has enjoyed relative obscurity, managing to avoid being on the tourist radar (it is not even mentioned in the latest "Lonely Planet - Croatia" publication) until 2014 when it became a filming location for hit TV show "Game of Thrones", standing in for the fictional city of Meereen since season 4. Despite this, you will generally have the fort to yourself to explore. Entrance fee is 20Kn. The easiest bus to get from Split leaves from the plaza near the National Theater (just north of Diocletian's Palace) and will take you directly to Klis village bus stop at the base of the Fort - journey time is about 25mins. Alternatively, from Split's main bus station at the port, take a bus towards Sinj and ask the driver for Klis. As they are larger buses they can only drop you beneath the village on the main road, so you'll need to walk up to the fortress (allow about half an hour for this).

* - 7 old villages, today connected and form one big city. Perfect for beautiful walks near the sea and taking a swim away from the big city. There are a wide variety of resaturants to choose from for an authentic Dalamatian cuisine. Each village has it's on castle (henche the name Kaštel), and some of them are open to public. Ask the locals for best sights, both near the sea and up in the hills. There are a lot of old churches and castles, and some breathtaking views.

* - a historic town and harbour on the Adriatic coast in Croatia, with a population of approximately 13,000. Today it is part of the greater Split metropolitan area or conurbation which numbers over 400,000 inhabitants. It is on the UNESCO World Heritage List as it is one of the best preserved medieval towns in Europe. It is a fascinating place to just wander and also contains a range of accommodation. At present the town is undergoing considerably redevelopment, but it far from fully developed and you will still find run down or even abandoned houses. It is definitely worth the day trip from Split. 

* - ancient Roman colony, one of the biggest towns of Roman Empire. It had a population of nearly 60,000 people. It was a capital of Roman province Dalmatia. Well preserved amphitheater, theater, basilica, cemetery and many other Roman buildings. Situated near town of Solin, 10-20 min bus ride from Split.

* - A day trip by boat to this island is well worth the effort. Boats leave five times a day in peak season (July&ndash;August), three times a day outside this period (a single trip cost about 42 kn to Stari Grad on ). Hvar town is small but extremely attractive, with numerous large yachts moored in the harbour. If using the left luggage service ensure you thoroughly check the prices and conditions of use.

* - An alternative could be the boat to the island of Brač which is just the other side of the water. Boats leave up to 10 times daily and it takes you 1 hr to Supetar. The last ferry back to Split leaves at 10:45PM. Ferries schedule varies by day of the week and by season so be sure to check the schedule in advance. 

Try renting a bike or scooter for exploring the island. When renting, take into account that the rental service normally closes rather early but when you ask for it, they are quite flexible as most people are in Split. A return ferry ticket should cost about 70 kn and has no time restrictions within the same day.
