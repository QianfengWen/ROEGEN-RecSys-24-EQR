Kansas City is a large, major midwestern city on the border of and . It is the largest city in Missouri with a population around 450,000 people, and more than 2 million in its metropolitan area (2015 estimate).

Understand

Kansas City is a city that tends to hide itself from tourists. Having reportedly more boulevards than and more fountains than any other city in the world except for , it is a beautiful city, too. Two neighboring cities sharing the same name: Kansas City, KS and Kansas City, MO. They are known locally as KCK (verbally expressed as each letter) and KCMO (verbally expressed as letters "K" then "C" then the sound of the last two letters together, sounding like the word "mow"). Kansas City, Missouri is the predominant city of the metropolitan area.

The suburbs are largely south of the central city, though the area north of the Missouri River (known locally as the Northland) is beginning to experience growth similar to the south. Numbering of east/west streets begins at the Missouri River with the east/west division occurring at Main Street. Westport is around 40th St., the Plaza at 47th St., Brookside at 55th, and Waldo beginning around Gregory (71st St.).

Climate

Due to the lack of any large body of water nearby, KC experiences a continental climate with large swings and extremes of temperature. Winters vary from mild to very cold, with significant snow at times, and temperatures occasionally dipping to single digits and below 0°F (-18°C). Snow accumulation occurs 3-5 times per year, on average, sometimes exceeding a foot (31 cm). KC enjoys very pleasant spring and autumn weather, but suffers hot, humid summers. It is not uncommon for the temperature to stay above 90°F (32°C) for weeks at a time, during July and August. Because of the heat, almost all buildings in KC are equipped with air conditioning. While KC has relatively high humidity, the most common weather is clear with almost completely blue skies. The majority of the rain falls in Apr-Jun, but even in these wettest months, rain is light, compared to other cities in the region.

Kansas City is located in an area known as "tornado alley". Most tornadoes occur in the so-called Tornado Alley— the tornado-prone region of the United States, from Texas north into Kansas and the surrounding states of the Great Plains region. This area often has the three ingredients necessary for tornadoes to form: a lot of warm, moist air close to the ground; atmospheric instability, a condition that promotes the vertical movement of air; and clashing air fronts that act to propel moist air upward. For this reason, most homes in Kansas City have basements in order to equip residents with a safe place to go if a tornado forms in the area.

Downtown

Downtown Kansas City is generally defined as the areas including the River Market, the central business district (the "Loop"), the Crossroads Arts District, Crown Center and Union Station. 

After years of neglect and decay in the 1980s and 1990s, downtown is making a comeback. Many once-abandoned buildings in downtown have been (or are being) rebuilt into high-dollar condominiums and loft apartments. The demand for residences downtown is quite high. In October of 2007, the Sprint Center sports arena was completed, bringing a modern sports and entertainment venue to the downtown core. The Power and Light District was constructed and opened in 2008. The "P&L" District comprises 5 high rise residential and office towers, with many clubs, bars, restaurants, and shops on the lower floors. A new performing arts center south of the convention center area opened in 2011. In 2016, the downtown Street Car was completed, which links these areas together. The Street Car runs from Union Station to the River Market.

The "Downtown Council" operates security and cleaning/maintenance crews, who keep downtown's streets clean and serve as a security presence. Downtown is one of the safest areas of the city, both day and night. 

Traveling north to south, the River Market is the first neighborhood one encounters, south of the banks of the Missouri River. A burgeoning urban neighborhood, it houses many shops, restaurants, bars, and a very active farmers' market that convenes every Saturday and Sunday, even in winter. The River Market is one of the most diverse areas in the city--with restaurants serving Ethiopian Food to Creole Food to Brazilian. 

The expressways form a loop around the central business district (CBD). Crossing the north segment of the loop takes you from the River Market to the CBD. This is where Kansas City's famed skyline reaches its greatest heights, further accentuated by its position on top of a sizable hill. The CBD has the principal concentration of white-collar employment in the metro area. The world headquarters for H&R Block is located here, within the P and L District. 

From here, crossing the south segment of the loop will bring a visitor into the Crossroads Arts District, which is a regional center for art, culture, and nightlife. Many new bars and breweries are popping up in the area and there is definitely a hipster-vibe within these streets. The Crossroads is also home to the Kauffman Preforming Arts Center.

When crossing Pershing, Union Station and Crown Center are seen, which houses shops, restaurants, and offices, including the world headquarters of Hallmark. The nearby Liberty Memorial is the world's first World War I memorial and has spectacular views from the top. Just south of Crown Center is Union Hill, another revitalized area offering some of the best skyline views in the city.

South of Downtown

A visitor enters Midtown when they cross 31st Street. A largely residential area, it is the largest single named neighborhood in the city, and actually includes a number of smaller neighborhoods, like Hyde Park, Squire Park, Sheraton Estates, Ivanhoe, Coleman Highlands, Roanoke, Volker, Westport, Southmoreland, Valentine, North Plaza, and many others.

Just south of Midtown is the Country Club Plaza, known locally as "the Plaza", an outdoor shopping center, modeled after , . Farther south is the Waldo/Brookside area marked by more bars and a wonderful pre-war neighborhood. Further south, the city gives way to suburban development, which continues for about 10-15 mi (16-24 km), before giving way to rural farmland and pastures.

Barbecue
"Who has the best barbecue in Kansas City?" is a question that causes much debate in Kansas City. Although the debate is usually in good humor, be ready for a passionate explanation which may take some time (or a light-hearted argument if asked in front of more than one person). Although the different restaurants each have their own unique flavors, they will usually have a sauce which is thicker and sweeter than offered in most other parts of the U.S.

Kansas City is also home to a barbecue dish that is rarely found outside the area, called "Burnt Ends." These are the overcooked ends and edges of a brisket, which although dry and chewy, are amazingly smoky and full of flavor (much more flavorful than any other cut). If you are feeling open-minded about your KC barbecue experience, they are definitely worth a try. 

* It has pictures on the wall of presidents and other famous people who have visited. The sandwich consists of a large pile of brisket and two pieces of butternut bread. One sandwich could feed three people. Ask for sauce for take-outs. Bryant's signature sauce is a vinegar based sauce with slight lower neutral overtones. There are alternate, sweeter versions of the sauce available. There is a security guard in the parking lot at night. 

* B.B.'s Lawnside BBQ is situated in an old roadhouse in south Kansas City, and serves Kansas City-style barbecue. All the ribs, sausage and meats are slow-smoked in a 60 year old pit with apple wood. B.B.'s prides itself on having a slightly more varied list of sides than the typical establishments in the area. This often includes Cajun/Creole staples such as Boudin Balls & Jambalaya. However, BB's is best known for live Blues, Zydeco, and other various types of live music six nights a week.

* Jack Stack is considered to be the Kansas City area's "High Class" BBQ resturant (Although Jeans & T-shirts are perfectly acceptable) Jack stack offers one of the largest varieties of meats in the metro area. Choices can vary from lamb ribs, to prime rib. Jack Stack's sauce is extremely similar to Gates sauce in that it is sweet, but slightly less tangy than Gate's version. Notable sides include their hickory pit beans and cheesy corn bake.

* When you walk in, you will immediately hear: "Hi, may I help you?" So, if you're eating in, and you have absolutely no idea what to order, shout back "Beef and a half on bun", "Mixed Plate" (Mixed plate includes ribs, sliced ham & sliced turkey) or "Burnt End on Bun". Guy Fieri of the Food Network once declared the Burnt End On Bun to be his single most favorite meal in the country. Gates Sauce is world famous and widely considered to be one of the best sauces available. It is sweet & tangy with very slight vinegar undertones. 

* Great onion rings and the BBQ sauce is one of the most unique in the city. Also known for very juicy Burnt Ends.

* Though not much to look at, don't let the barred door and admittedly intimidating surroundings scare you off; specialties here include sandwiches that feed two and thick cut fries. About 10 minutes away from the stadiums, it's a great stop on the way to Royals or Chiefs games, but get there early - plenty of people have the same idea.

* Situated in a gas station/liquor store in Kansas City KS, Joe's KC has quickly established itself as the "Pulled Pork King" of the area. Pulled pork is the self proclamed specialty, but just about all things swine are amazing. Walk around to the serving line and have some of the best ribs in KC. The Z-Man sandwich (Beef brisket and melted provolone topped with two onion rings) and the "Carolina Style" (served open-faced with cole slaw) are also favorites. Anthony Bourdain included Joe's KC in his "13 Places To Eat Before You Die" list published in GQ magazine. Lines are punishingly long during lunch, but very well worth the wait. Call in and go to the front register for a take out order. Joe's started life as Oklahoma Joe's, but in August 2014 the owner announced that the name of their three Kansas City area restaurants would be changed to Joe's Kansas City Bar-B-Que as of November 17, 2014.

Drink

Brewers: Recently rated the country's third-best craft brewer beers from are now distributed coast to coast and are on tap in virtually every bar and restaurant in KC. Wheat and Pale Ale are its most venerable brand, but its popular Pilsner and specialty line of beers, including Tank 7 and saisons, are also notable.

Live Music Venues: Uptown Theatre (Midtown, on Broadway and Valentine) hosts lots of up and coming acts and many timeless performers play here because it is so famous. 

Beaumont Club is a soulless Westport C&W club that hosts live music but has acoustics' issues and a mechanical bull. 

The Grand Emporium used to be one of the best blues clubs but after being bought by the owners of the Beaumont they changed it considerably, including the name to Tao.

Atmosphere: When the weather is nice, the deck is the place to be. Gorgeous. Skyline, fans if needed, open air and nice conversation acoustics of course. A really solid bar and grill and unique experience.

The cheapest place to drink on the Plaza, as domestic beer is $2 after 9PM. A good place to start the night.

Crossroads

* Balanca's prides itself on the diversity of its crowd - it's not unusual to see drag queens drinking and dancing with cowboys and hip-hop aficionados in the downstairs bar, while goths play pool in the upstairs bar with yuppies and hipsters. It's weird, but it works. 

* 

* Cocktails and fine eats served in nice atmosphere.

* Open air cafe feel to this two-story bar. In the summer months, the windows are raised up (think: "garage door") and both stories gain a relaxing breeze and a nice view of the city. Occasionally has live music, popular stop during First Fridays.

* 

* Eclectic beer selection and authentic Philly Cheeseteak sandwiches.

Stay safe

Like most major cities, the tourist and business areas (downtown and the Plaza) are generally safe day and night, but it is always best to be aware of your surroundings. It's also best to be especially cautious during the evenings and night around the P and L District, where there has been an increase in crimes. Most violent crime happens during the late nighttime hours. Neighborhoods east and southeast of the downtown/midtown/Plaza areas are experiencing an increase in violent crime. These areas offer little for visitors and are best avoided.

Kansas City is in Tornado Alley, so make sure you check the local weather forecasts and make sure you understand what to do during a tornado. Tornado sirens are in place to warn of incoming twisters. The system is tested every month on the first Wednesday at around noon when the weather is clear. If you hear the sirens any other time, they're serious!

Temperatures vary widely between summer and winter--January mornings regularly dip down to the 20s (F), while July afternoons can reach 95 (F) or higher. Be sure to pack cloting appropriate for the time of year, especially if you plan to spend significant time outdoors.

Get out

Kansas City is one of those places where hidden in darker corners, you will find the gems, the places to visit and go. Rarely do things jump out at you and say: come visit this attraction, food, shopping, or historical establishment. Pick up a Pitch Weekly for nightlife information. If you want to relax and enjoy a walk, check out Loose Park just south of the Country Club Plaza. During the spring and fall, it's one of the most beautiful places to stroll. When you are done there are plenty of other beautiful and majestic cities in this region like , , , , , and .
