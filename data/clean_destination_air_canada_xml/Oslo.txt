Oslo is the capital and largest city of , and the third largest city of Scandinavia. Oslo is also the demographic, cultural, economic, and political center of Norway.

History
The history of the city can be traced back over 1,000 years. Oslo was founded in 1048, by King Harald Hardråde. The city became the capital of Norway around 1300 but lost its privileges during the Danish-Norwegian Union from 1348 to 1814. In 1624, a fire devastated old Oslo, and the city was moved some kilometers west to gain protection from the fortress at Akershus. The city was renamed Christiania, after the Danish King Christian IV, a name that remained until it was officially renamed on January 1st, 1925 to Oslo. Traces have been found close to Ekeberg indicating settlement as far back as 10,000 BC. 

After the devastating 1624 fire, Old Oslo (around the mouth of the Aker River) was largely abandoned and the ruins were converted to farmland. Today, a few church ruins are still visible under Ekeberg Hill (across the water from the new Opera House, located between the E18 road and the railway). Beyond these ruins, virtually nothing of medieval Oslo remains. Ironically, the new city Christiania was established outside the borders of Oslo, and 'Oslo' remained the name of the small, surviving settlement outside the new city borders. During Christiania's rapid expansion in the 19th century, as the capital of a new state, the site of the original Oslo (Old Oslo, or 'Gamlebyen') was included in the city. Due to the rapid inclusion of surrounding agricultural areas in the 19th century, a large number of remnants from the city's farming history are still clearly visible in place names and farmhouses. Remnants of historical pastures, such as St. Hanshaugen, are now used as a recreational park for Oslo's residents.

Geography
Oslo, with its approximately 453 square kilometers, is one of the largest capitals in the world by area. Most of this is forest, making Oslo a city in close contact with the nature surrounding it.

Oslo is situated in an amphitheater-like setting, with the city center at the bottom close to the , and residential areas stretching uphill from there in all directions. Behind the residential areas, the forested area of Marka (Nordmarka, Østmarka, Lillomarka) extends, with flora and fauna that are quite extraordinary for a city of this size. Moose are commonplace (easily spotted in winter), and the whole of the capital is part of Norway's wolf reserve (a breeding couple is thought to have settled in Østmarka). However, polar bears are non-existent in Norway proper, even though some might think so, due to old stories about Norway.

The is an inlet of the Skagerrak Bay, stretching inland from the North Sea. In the reverse direction, the inlet runs towards Øresund and the Baltic Sea. Oslo has an impressive archipelago of islands, which in summer becomes the city's favored playground. 

The inner city center is bounded by Oslo Central Station (Oslo S) to the east, the Royal Palace (Slottet) to the west, and the seafront (from Akershus fortress to Aker Brygge) to the south. It is fairly compact and easily walkable. Karl Johans gate, the mostly pedestrian main street connecting Oslo S and the Palace, is the main artery of downtown Oslo. However, several of the neighborhoods close to the center hold interesting sights and entertainment offerings, so to explore these you should make use of the city's comprehensive and modern public transport system.

Climate
Although well into the northern latitudes, Oslo's climate is fairly temperate thanks to warm air being wafted across the Atlantic from the Gulf Stream. Summer weather in Oslo is usually mild and pleasant, with frequent hot spells and plenty of long sunny days. In winter temperatures hover just above or below freezing, with occasional cold spells. Snow is most often plentiful in the forested areas, making Oslo a great winter sports venue. Rainfall is spread across the year, the rainiest month being August.

People
Oslo has a population of 1,064,235 people including its extra-municipal suburbs (such as Bærum and Lørenskog). It has the highest population growth of any European capital, with exorbitant real estate prices to match. The Oslo metropolitan area has a population of around 1.5 million. The diverse population includes some of Norway's wealthiest celebrities. About a quarter of the population is of non-Norwegian origin, the majority hailing from Sweden, Poland, and Pakistan. This has made Oslo an ethnically and culturally diverse city. Accompanied by a large influx of people from all around Norway, Oslo is thus often referred to as the "melting pot" of Norway. Cultural differences have affected Oslo's society and cityscape in matters of cuisine and shopping, which have all blended into the everyday life of Oslo's population. Some areas of Oslo, especially around Grønland and Tøyen, and some suburbs east of the city center have majority-immigrant or majority-non-ethnic Norwegian populations. Oslo has been an extremely segregated city for centuries, and there are still significant differences between different parts of the city and attempts to reduce this divide have been futile. There are notable immigrant communities of Pakistani, Somali, Swedish, Sri Lankan, Iraqi, Polish, Romanian, Vietnamese, Iranian, Ex-Yugoslavian, Moroccan, Turkish, Albanian, Filipino, Thai, and Danish origin. Polish immigrants form the largest minority group in Oslo.

Districts
Following the latest reform of January 1, 2004, the city is divided into fifteen boroughs (by dealer) that are to a considerable extent self-governed. Each borough is responsible for local services not overseen by the City Council, such as social services, basic healthcare, and kindergartens. For convenience, the city can be divided into six larger districts.
* Sentrum (Sentrum) Central downtown area.
* West (Bygdøy) "The Museum Peninsula" and the poshest area in Norway
* Inner West (St. Hanshaugen, Frogner, Majorstua)
* Inner East (Sagene, Grünerløkka, Gamle Oslo)
* Outer West (Ullern, Holmenkollen, Vestre Aker, Nordre Aker)
* Outer East (Alna, Bjerke, Grorud, Stovner, Nordstrand, Søndre Nordstrand, Østensjø)

Get in
By plane
Oslo is served by two airports: Oslo Airport (Gardermoen) and Sandefjord Airport (Torp). Oslo Airport is the largest of the two and is the main international gateway to Norway. Rygge Airport (Moss) used to be an option but closed in November 2016.

Be aware that most Internet flight booking sites will show flights to all mentioned airports when searching for Oslo Airport. Make sure to check the actual airport from the search results before booking. If you don't want to land in an airport that is far away from Oslo, Gardermoen Airport is your best choice.

* (, ) is Norway's largest, and Scandinavia's second largest airport, located in , 47 kilometers northeast of Oslo. Direct flights are available to a multitude of Norwegian and European airports, as well as several intercontinental destinations. The largest airlines in Norway, Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) and Norwegian Air Shuttle operate most of the flights. Flights by about 30 other airlines make this airport easily accessible from most of the world. There is free Wi-Fi access at the airport.

To travel between the city and the airport: 

* Flytoget operates high-speed express trains which depart every 10 minutes and generally take about 19 minutes to reach Oslo Central Station (Oslo S). Every other train is express to Oslo S, and the next train will service stations located west in and out of Oslo city, terminating at Drammen. Tickets (to Oslo S) cost NOK 196 when bought from a ticket machine or in the Flytoget app (NOK 98/retired, kids, youth up to 20 years old, and students up to than 31 with a student ID; tickets are not valid for transfer in Oslo).

*Vy (previously known as NSB) operates trains southbound via Oslo to Drammen, then on to Kongsberg or Skien. The train station is linked to the airport via free shuttle buses. You can change to any train from Oslo S (central station). Northbound trains are also offered from the airport directly to Eidsvoll, Lillehammer, and Trondheim. This is the more popular and cost-effective way to get into Oslo - trains depart from the adjacent platforms to the Flytoget Express. The trip takes 23 minutes, and trains depart three times per hour. Tickets cost NOK 118 (NOK 69 with a valid Oslo public transport ticket, valid for transfer in Oslo). Tickets are sold at ticket machines, or on board, but be sure to board the right carriage. For more details check: . If you prefer apps, you can buy tickets in the Vy app. Strongly recommend using this option; economical and convenient. The last Vy train to the city may be about 11:30 PM; the first train on weekends to the city is around 6:40 AM. If you arrive late, Oslo airport is sleep-able and safe on the land side. The main train station in Oslo has all the amenities you can think about including Starbucks with free Wi-Fi (upstairs) and there is live information assistance during daytime hours at the ground level if you need it.

* Flybussen operates buses to Oslo city center which take roughly 45 minutes to reach the city center and cost NOK 179. A return ticket valid for 1 month is also available for NOK 260, cheaper if bought online or in the Flybussen app. This is valid for transfer in Oslo. There is also a 50% discount for all Flybussen tickets (NOK 95 one way if bought online) for different groups, including students younger than 31. Flybussen also operates several other bus lines to other places in Oslo (and Akershus). Please refer to the website for more details. 

* Taxis can, and should, be ordered in the booth inside the terminal for different fixed prices from approximately NOK 700+ to Oslo city center. Leaving the terminal to flag one from the queue is almost always more expensive. You won't get scammed by taxi drivers as you might in many large cities, but getting the fixed airport price is crucial. Recently when arriving very late (midnight) there is only a taxi from the company “By Taxi” and prices to the city center run at 1700-1800, and scams known from other cities are back. If you can’t order a taxi in the terminal there are apps e.g. Oslo Taxi and you will save significantly if you order online rather than falling from the “By Taxi” line and scam. Most people with a destination in Oslo will be far better off getting the Flytoget, Flybussen, or local train to Oslo S, as it is both cheaper and faster. Uber Black is also available in Oslo, and possibly from the airport, but with limited availability. Rentals are another possibility if you are staying outside OSLO city proper (and nearby cities such as Lillehammer, Moss++, and the rental car companies' apps are often the most cost-effective setup.

* ) is near and , 118km south of Oslo. The following airlines operate at Torp: KLM (), Norwegian Air Shuttle (), Ryanair (, , -Girona, , , -Hahn, , -Stansted, -Bergamo, ), Widerøe (, , , , , ), Wizz Air (, , , , , , -Zhuliany, , , ).

To travel between the city and the airport by bus or taxi:
* PKS OSLO door-to-door transfer can pick you up from any address in Oslo for NOK 230 per person. (As of 2023, This is the cheapest option, but it's pretty slow - the exact time depends on the pickup/drop locations of everyone else on the bus).
* Taxis are very expensive; a taxi to Oslo costs around NOK 800.
* Torpekspressen operates between the airport and Drammen and Oslo (1 hour 45 mins) and costs NOK 240 for a single ticket, NOK 420 for a return (discounts for students (NOK 340), ISIC Card Holders and senior citizens). Torpekspressen buses are scheduled to accommodate arriving flights, so after you get off the plane, most likely there will be a bus to Oslo waiting for you. If you miss the bus scheduled for your flight, you may end up waiting a long time for the next bus.

By train

* Station is at the eastern fringe of the city center, by the end of the main pedestrian street Karl Johans gate. Oslo S is at the center of Norway's railway, all lines (including the airport express train) terminate at Oslo S, making Oslo S the supreme gateway to Oslo. The major express buses go to the bus station next door to the train station.
Internationally, there are three daily services to () (4 hours). Four daily Swedish semi-high speed X2000 trains travel in the direction of () (4 hours 50 minutes), one of which will require a change in (schedule There are no international night trains to or from Oslo. For () and beyond, you will have to change trains in .

Tickets for the Gothenburg line are cheaper when bought at the Vy website. Tickets for the Stockholm line are cheaper if you buy them from the Swedish train company SJ's website, where the tickets can be cheaper. Tickets are released for sale 3 months ahead of departure, and the sooner you buy them, the cheaper they will be. Both Norwegian and Swedish prebooked train tickets can be picked up at ticket machines in Oslo Central Station (Norwegian tickets also at other stations).

Norwegian state rail operator Vy runs fairly frequent and semi-efficient, though not fast, domestic services to , , and , as well as a relatively comprehensive local and regional service around Oslo. 

Flytoget (the Airport Express Train) also operates from Oslo S in its own little area clearly marked with signs. See details in the Oslo Airport section.

Long-distance trains heading south- or westwards also stop at Lysaker station at the western city border. Those heading north and east make their first call at Lillestrøm station, outside of the city.

For people using Oslo as a point of transit, it is good to note that Oslo S has two "attached" buildings, both of which can be used to pass through to the trains. Østbanehallen (or Ø) has been recently renovated to include fancy restaurants. Just walk through the escalator to get to the station. Also, Byporten, a narrow shopping mall is also there to be used. Just walk ahead to get to the trains. Each of these also contains a hotel.

It has lockers for rent, a huge variety of cafes and restaurants, and a few hotels. The small lockers are NOK 30, the medium lockers are NOK 40 and the large lockers are NOK 60. The medium lockers also come in two shapes, cubic and thinner but taller, making them useful for storing luggage that would not normally fit (like skis).

By bus
Oslo is well served by bus from most of Europe. The biggest operators of international buses are the Swedish company Swebus and the Norwegian company Nettbuss Both run inexpensive services to and from , , and several times a day. 

On domestic services, Nor-Way Bussekspress is the biggest operator, with several buses to tons of other Norwegian destinations, primarily. These are very useful for reaching along-the-way destinations, as outside of the central parts of Eastern Norway they stop at every single stop along the way, but are tedious for traveling very long distances also covered by train. 
Lavprisekspressen has buses to Trondheim (Friday/Sunday) and Kristiansand/Stavanger (daily), with cheap fares (Internet booking only). 

By car
International highways E6 (from Malmö and Gothenburg) and E18 (from , Helsinki and Stockholm) meet in Oslo. E16 (from Gävle and Torsby) runs some 40 km north of Oslo, passing the airport, with a branch to the E18 from Hønefoss to Sandvika just west of Oslo. June 1, 2019, a new system of road tax will be implemented, creating 83 "road tax stations" which are basically just cameras that read your license plate. Pricing will change if there are rush hours and based on your car's fuel (gas, diesel, electric, or hydrogen). Rental car companies will just charge you whatever you drive for automatically. Be aware that understanding this road tax system can be complicated for an outsider, and that there is currently political pressure in Norway to reduce the impact of it which could change the outcome of current changes. The road tax company in the Oslo/Akershus area is Fjellinjen.

The E6 is the main north-south road of Norway and continues north to , , and , with branches to most Norwegian cities. The E16 runs east to and west to , the E134 to and the E18 run south-west to , (/) and . Other notable roads into Oslo include Rv4 from and Rv7, an alternative (and shorter) road to passing Gol and .

Driving in Oslo city areas is getting harder as more roads close or become one-way drives, popular places in the city center are not accessible and parking spots are being more regulated (2-hour rule in many places, high fare). The city is very accessible by public transport, city bikes and walking.

By boat

Oslo is connected to Denmark and Germany by car ferry. Color Line runs services to (Germany) daily. DFDS runs daily services to (Denmark), and Stena Line provides service to (Denmark).

You may also want to consider Color Lines high-speed boats from (2 hours south of Oslo on E18, or easily reachable by hourly NSB train) or (4 1/2 hours south of Oslo on E18, or reachable on five daily trains or near-hourly buses) to (Denmark). They both take some 3 1/2 hours to reach Denmark.

The port for cruise lines is near Akershus Festning, a short walk from downtown. The train station in Kristiansand is close to the ferry quay, while in Larvik the quay has been moved to a location that is a bit of a trek from the station.

Get around
There is a comprehensive public transport system in Oslo, consisting of buses, trams, trains, metro (T-bane) and boats. The public transport is planned and coordinated by Ruter 

Ruter Help Center (formerly known as Trafikanten is the information centre for public transport in Oslo. It is temporarily situated at the main entrance of Oslo Central Station as well as at Aker Brygge and a few other locations. They hand out free maps, give information, and sell all kinds of tickets. The Ruter website has timetables, maps, route planners, and search engines for all city transport in Oslo, as well as all transport in the nearby counties of Akershus, Østfold, Oppland, Hedmark, Buskerud, Vestfold, and Telemark. The Oslo Tourist Information Centre is in the same office at Jernbanetorget, at the rear counters.

There are two main hubs for public transport inside the city center: Oslo Central Station (Oslo S)/Jernbanetorget and National Theatre (underground). All metro lines pass these stations, all trains pass Oslo S and most trains (including the Airport Express Train (Flytoget)) pass Nationaltheateret. National Theatre is most convenient for key buildings such as the Royal Palace, the National Gallery, the Parliament, Oslo Concert Hall, and Oslo City Hall.

Tickets and the zone system
The Oslo and Akershus public transport utilizes a zone system in which the price for a trip is calculated based on how many zones you pass through. It's likely that most tourists will only use Zone 1, therefore ticket prices listed below are for Zone 1 only.

All public transport runs on the same scheme and your tickets are valid for all Ruter metro, trams, buses, and ferries, and on Vy's trains in Oslo. A ticket must be stamped or activated (validated), the single ticket is valid for one hour of free travel in the zone(s) the ticket is valid for. You can also get a Travelcard where you load pay-as-you-go-credit.

Period tickets are also available; 24-hour ticket, 7-day ticket, 30-day ticket and 365-day ticket. 

Student discounts for 30-day tickets are also available, but only if you are studying in Oslo or Akershus area. Read more about other discounts here: For a short visit, one additional option is to buy a Oslo Pass which includes free admission to many tourist attractions and other benefits. 

All tickets can be bought digitally on either the Ruter or EnTur app using a credit or debit card. Physical tickets are available at Ruter Customer Center outside of Oslo S and at most 7-Eleven, Deli De Luca, Mix and Narvesen stores in Oslo and Akershus. There are also ticket machines at all metro stations and a few of the tram stops. All tickets are also valid on night services, running every Friday and Saturday night after the regular service has shut down. 

Make sure that you have a ticket with you when traveling and that it is validated before boarding public transport. Most physical ticket types and digital ticket types are not valid until they are not activated (validated). On a bus or tram, physical tickets are activated (validated) when you board by holding the card next to a card reader, or occasionally by the driver. On the metro and the large railway stations, you activate the ticket at the platform before entering the train. It is rare that someone will check your ticket when boarding and departing transport. Ticket checks are carried out at random and are fairly common. Being caught without a valid ticket leads to an on-the-spot fine. 

Note: General public transportation tickets are not valid on the Airport Express Train (Flytoget), the Airport Coach (Flybussen) services, or VyExpress services. They are however valid on Flybussen's service FB2 and FB5.

By train
Local trains cover certain areas of the city, and run out to the neighboring municipalities and towns. The local train network spans across the city limits to neighboring cities and towns. 

Some of the cars on local trains have orange doors, with the notice "Ubetjent" (Unserved) and "Carriage without Conductor". These cars are usually not visited by the conductor, and you can use these cars only if you have a ticket that is stamped or pre-validated and does not need to be stamped by the conductor. You may be fined if you use one of these carriages with, say a single ticket, and a conductor does come to check your tickets. If you are unsure about the rules, play it safe and take one of the carriages with black doors and notices marked "Betjent" and "Carriage with Conductor".

In the center, the main station is Oslo Sentralstasjon (Oslo S), which connects to the metro station Jernbanetorget through a direct link (escalators down by track 1/exit to Oslo City shopping center/bus terminal) and most bus/tram lines above ground. The second downtown station, served by most local trains and several regional ones, is the underground station Nationaltheateret, which is located immediately below the metro station of the same name. Most westbound buses also stop just outside the station.

Punctuality, especially in the winter, can be an issue as the train system is quite run down. However, things have improved since a big program of refurbishment was started in 2010. Please note that regular tickets are valid on the Vy trains, but not on the Airport Express Train (Flytoget).

By metro

Oslo has one of the largest metro systems in Europe. It is known as the Tunnelbane or mainly just T-bane in Norwegian.

To find a T-bane station, just look for the blue and white logo with a "T" within a circle. There are six lines, but the network is easy enough to figure out: all lines merge together into one single tunnel through the city center, from Majorstuen through Jernbanetorget (Oslo S/Oslo Central Station) to Tøyen, and then spread out into the suburbs. A loop line runs in a circle from northern Oslo city center to the center and back. The loop line is called "Ringen" (the ring) in Norwegian.

With rolling stock from the 1960s, the Oslo metro used to be one of the most run-down in Europe, but it has now been fully replaced with new metro trains engineered by Siemens and designed by Porsche. The carriges are called MX3000 and are all modern looking, accessible for wheelchair and stroller users, and clean.

When entering a T-bane station, make sure to pick the correct platform: all stations except three on the loop line (Sinsen, Storo and Nydalen) have separate entrances and separate platforms for trains going west and trains going east. If you have a paper ticket, make sure that it is validated before entering the train.

By bus or tram
Trams and buses complement the metro network, and use the same tickets. They cover most of the city and run from approx. 5AM to past midnight, on some lines up to 1 AM. Two bus lines, 31 and 37, run all night, every day.

All tram lines run every 10 minutes during the day, and every 20 minutes at night and early morning (30 min on weekend mornings). The main lines cover parts of the city with no metro and are an efficient way of getting around. The main, central tram terminal is at Jernbanetorget, where all lines converge. 

Bus lines cover the rest of the city, as well as several ring lines. Nearly all central bus lines converge at Jernbanetorget. The most useful bus lines for visitors are buses 30, 31, 32, 34, 37, and 54, passing by Jernbanetorget and covering parts of the city with no tram or metro lines. Buses 20 and 21 provide central ring-line service, while buses 23 and 24 cover the highway ring road further out. Some services complement metro stops in the outskirts of Oslo.

Nights after Fridays and Saturdays, buses cover parts of the city with varying frequency. All regular tickets are valid. Most of these start or pass by the bus stops close to the Parliament Building (Stortinget) and Jernbanetorget (Oslo Central Station/Oslo S). 

By taxi
Taxis are expensive, so if public transport still runs, use it. Taxis in Oslo as in most of Norway are frequently new, large, and comfortable cars like Volvo or Mercedes. Most taxis wait for customers in a line in front of hotels or train stations, or you can order one by phoning one of the handful of taxi companies (for an extra charge). You can also flag one from the street, or go to a taxi stand.

Several companies compete to have the most incomprehensible price structure. All taxi companies have a starting fee and a fee per kilometer. These fees vary by taxi company and time of day. Usually, there's three different rates: The lowest one is the day rate, usually between 06.00 and 18.00. The next is the evening and night rate, usually 18.00-06.00 M-F and 06.00-18.00 Sa. The last rate is usually for Saturday after 18.00 till Monday 06.00, but different companies do have different time frames. Beware that some companies will operate with a special holiday rate (helligdagstakst) on public holidays, including the night before, which will result in staggering rates.

Taxi drivers in Oslo aren't a particularly jolly breed, but they usually do not speed too much, and taxi crime towards customers is almost non-existent (towards tax authorities, however, is a different matter). Sometimes a taxi driver will attempt to charge you extra for luggage, and some companies do have a surcharge for this. The price structure should be shown on a sticker inside the car but is always in so small print, and with an overwhelming amount of details, you can't possibly decipher it. Another thing that often disturbs visitors is that the taxi driver's name and license are not printed inside the car itself, but this is legal. If you encounter any problems, ask for a receipt which will help you identify the car later, or make a note of the taxi license number on the car roof.

All taxis accept Visa and Mastercard, and the card can be swiped into the meter at the start of the journey for card validation. The driver will usually keep the card on top of the meter so that you can keep an eye on it. If you are uncomfortable with this, it is possible to ask to get the card back, but the card needs to be swiped again when you arrive at your destination. Most meters are just swipe and sign, but some companies have EMV chip terminals where you'll need to authorize the charge with your PIN. There have been no known scams connected to credit card fraud in taxis.

Some people tip taxi drivers or round the bill up to the nearest NOK 10, but taxi drivers do not generally expect a tip - most people pay the exact amount by card anyway.

By car
For general information on driving in Norway, see .

The major roads entering Oslo are also used for travel inside the city. In the eastern suburbs, road E6 is the main north-south corridor. East-west transport can be done on road E18 as well as Ring 3 running from E18 at the western city border to E6 in the eastern suburbs. The smaller (and slower) Ring 2 connects Skøyen in the west via Majorstua, Ullevål General Hospital, and Carl Berners Plass to E18 east of the center. The ring roads (as well as other main roads) are great for navigation.

Beware to always give way to trams and pedestrians, unless overridden by signs or traffic lights. Never challenge the tram, they have a long braking distance and will in any case give a loud, clear warning if you are obstructing. In some roundabouts the tram is driving straight through the island while cars must circle, be extremely careful in this type of roundabouts. Trams are not obliged to yield to pedestrians, while cars must. Park your car at a safe distance from the rails so as not to obscure the tram (ask locals if unsure).

By boat

At Aker Brygge, you can catch boats to different destinations:
* B1-B4 services run to the small, cozy islands just outside Oslo. Locals use these to get a little escape from the city (and from the tourists).
* B10-B22 services run to other places on the west and east coastline in Oslofjord, including Nesodden.
* Bygdøyfergen service is a tourist boat that runs to the Bygdøy peninsula where you can see several museums. This boat is not covered with a standard Ruter ticket but is included in Oslo Pass. If you want to save money and ride with your Ruter ticket, just take the 30 bus service from Nasjonalteateret instead (takes maybe a few minutes more).

By bicycle
Cycling in Oslo is a great way to experience the city as a tourist. Many of the city’s streets have separate bicycle lanes and Oslo as a cycling city gets better and better every year.

Where there are not clearly marked cycling instructions, bicycles in Oslo must follow the same traffic rules and road signage as cars under Norwegian law. Cycling on the pavement/sidewalk is allowed, but speed should be greatly reduced and priority and care should be given to pedestrians.

There is a city-wide bike rental system called Oslo Bysykkel and you can find many of these bikes in stations the 250+ dedicated stands around the city center and the surrounding inner suburbs. Rental can be purchased for 60 minutes, 24 hours, 30 days, or 365-day periods. Also, on the Oslo Bysykkel app, you will be allowed to find and unlock bikes and purchase the pass with a credit or debit card.

Oslo Bysykkel bikes are generally in good condition, but always check the lights, brakes, and other parts before cycling. During busy periods, you may find stations empty when you want to find a bike or full when you want to return one. The company works to transfer bicycles between the stations to match demand. The standard city bikes are available from April to November. After that, it is available only a reduced number of winter bikes. 

Lime, a private company, has also started to provide an electric bike rental service in Oslo. You can see these bikes situated free-standing around the city and not in any designated bike stand. These bicycles are motor-powered to help riders easily climb hills and speed up the journey time. You can download the Lime app to find a vehicle and scan the QR code on the e-bike to unlock it.

There are several electric scooter companies that operate in the city: major ones are Voi and Tier These can be used by downloading their respective apps, adding a payment card, and using the app to find and unlock bikes.

Buildings and structures
Architecture in Oslo may at first seem dull. Unlike for instance its Swedish counterpart, Stockholm, downtown Oslo has only scattered monumental buildings where in particular the Parliament-Palace axis (upper part of Karl Johan Street) has a certain Parisian grandeur. The charm of Oslo can also be found in the affluent inner-city suburbs of for instance Frogner and Fagerborg as well as above St.Hanshaugen Park. Northern Europe has a distinct wooden house tradition. Wooden houses are not allowed downtown, but these charming houses can be found in large numbers in villa suburbs such as Bygdøy and Holmenkollen, or former workers' areas such as Rodeløkka, Kampen, Vålerenga, Damstredet, Hellerud, or Telthusbakken. Oslo also has many exciting building projects and a huge part of the city's waterfront will in a few years have changed.
* A medieval castle and fortress built in 1299, located close to the city center. There are several excellent viewpoints to the and surrounding areas. The stone walls create an exciting atmosphere, and you are free to roam around in tight passages and staircases. There are two museums here, both related to Norwegian military history.
* Open to the public, with a spectacular main hall featuring huge murals with typical Nordic social democratic themes. There are also some displays of historical artifacts in the side rooms upstairs. This is where the Nobel Peace Prize is presented to the winner every year. Although there is no public lift, disadvantaged visitors only have to ask and they can use the staff lift.
* The old bazaar surrounding the church is now used by artisans and craftsmen and holds a couple of cafes and restaurants.
* Norway's first entry into the top league of modern architecture. Awarded the 2008 prize for best cultural building at the World Architecture Festival in Barcelona, and the prestigious Mies van der Rohe award for best European contemporary architecture in 2009, its appearance is stunning. Shaped as a glacier or a ship, the amazing building seems to float by the inlet Bjørvika, giving a stunning impression. Climb the building on the marble slopes (summer only) for a unique Oslo view. Be careful when temperatures go under 5 degrees as the roof may be very slippery! The main highway, which used to pass just between the Opera and Oslo Central Station, is now moved to a sub-sea tunnel under Bjørvika. The huge road crossing Bispelokket, which has marred the seafront of Oslo for 50 years, is currently being dismantled.
* is none too impressive, but recently refurbished. After the terrorist attacks on Oslo in July 2011, the square Stortorget, in front of Oslo Cathedral, became the center for afterthought and compassion. The square was fully covered by roses, greetings, and mourning messages for weeks.
* It has free guided tours in English and Norwegian lasting about 45 minutes, which assemble outside the back door of the Parliament (on Akersgata). There is a limit of 30 people per tour, so it is advisable to be there at least 10 minutes prior to the start of a tour.

* Tours inside the palace are arranged in the summertime, this year from June 21. The tickets for the tour must be bought in advance from a post office. If there are vacant spots in a tour, they sell the remaining tickets at the Palace itself to people waiting in line who don't already have tickets. Don't count on getting tickets on the spot unless you are quite ahead in the line since a lot of people buy them at the post offices. There are about 2 tours in English on weekdays.

* The building is currently only housing the Faculty of Law, the rest of the university is situated at Blindern. Occasional concerts will be arranged in the magnificent Universitetets Aula, housing 11 of Edvard Munch's pictures. The room is only occasionally open for the public but is one of the most magnificent rooms in all of Norway.
* They are a "must" for lovers of old wooden townhouses. These areas were likely to be erased from Oslo in the seventies by eager town planners who wanted highways for cars rather than living areas for the citizens, but luckily they were stopped by idealists who really loved their city. Their effort made these parts of Oslo into something special, even though other Norwegian cities have bigger wooden areas. Still, these areas are a plus for Oslo and its inhabitants as well as for tourists. They are not commonly visited by tourists, and may not be mentioned in your guidebook, but some of the areas have cafes/restaurants worth a visit. In Kampen, you can find a very cozy Elvis café by the church, and in Vålerenga Restaurant Smia is also located by the church.

Museums
Oslo has a large number of museums. If you are planning on seeing several of the expensive attractions in a short period of time, then you may consider an Oslo Pass It includes unlimited entry to most of the museums and the Holmenkollen ski jump (but not the Royal Palace), free travel on Oslo's quite expensive public transport, and even limited discounts on some restaurants and other attractions. Whether the Oslo Pass is truly cost-effective will depend on the range of activities planned and the time period involved. Students get a 20% discount on the Oslo pass, as well as discounts for Children and Seniors; However, museums and transit passes offer similar discounts. You could also buy a travel card allowing unlimited travel on public transport (no student discount on this). You can buy 24, 48, or 72-hour Oslo passes or travel cards. They can be purchased at Tourist Information Offices in Oslo and through the Ruter app (in the App Store and Play).

Somewhat outside the city center is a peninsula called Bygdøy. You can get there by bus (number 30) or, in summer months (Apr-Sep), by ferry departing from Pier 3 at Aker Brygge outside the city hall (you'll see a big sign that says Bygdøy). Day tickets are not valid on this ferry. At Bygdøy, you will find two groups of museums within walking distance of each other.
* is also located at Bygdøy, in the former residence of the Norwegian World War 2 collaborator and nationalist leader, Vidkun Quisling. The center houses exhibitions and provides research on the Holocaust and the plight of religious minorities. Included in the Oslo Pass.
* Among Oslos best hidden secrets. Gustav Vigeland's not-so-well-known younger brother erected the building as a museum for his art in 1926 but later decided it should serve as a mausoleum, with his urn placed above the door. The main attraction in this museum with no windows is the 800 square meters fresco "Vita", (Italian for "life"), showing the human life from conception till death, but other examples of his art are also on display. Included in the Oslo Pass.

* In addition to two 1100 year old Viking-ships (apparently the best preserved in the world), it also contains various other Viking artifacts and a Viking burial chamber, complete with ancient skeletons. Included in the Oslo Pass.

Parks
Oslo is a very green city. Lots of parks are scattered around town.
* The eastern Oslo park. On Sundays, there occures a second-hand market.
* Large botanical garden with themed groupings of international species, ponds & a cafe. Located just south of Tøyen Park, the garden is a wonderful and relaxing area.
* It is the steep, green hill east of the center. An important place for soccer tournaments. From the wide hairpin bend at road Valhallaveien, there is a great view of the city. This point is assumed to be the background for Scream, Edvard Munch's famous picture.

* This park together with the Vigeland Sculpture Park is a large green area about 10 minutes by subway from the city center. In addition to being a nice green recreational area, it is also decorated with hundreds of sculptures by the Norwegian artist Gustav Vigeland. There is a wonderfully relaxed atmosphere here, although the sculptures are a little depressing. If your children want to climb the statues, nobody will even bother to look twice at you. Between June and August Frognerparken is one of the main places the young in Oslo meet during the daytime to barbecue and sunbathe. Buy an "engangsgrill", a pack of sausages, and a couple of beers and you'll fit right in. Neither using the barbecue nor drinking in public is completely legal, but as long as you sit among others and don't get rowdy, you will have no trouble. There is also a cafeteria, and two museums, the City Museum of Oslo and the Vigeland Museum. If you fancy an outdoor swim, Frognerbadet is situated next to the Frognerpark with 3 pools, several diving towers, and a water slide.
* It is situated in the Grünerløkka, a so-called Greenwich village look-alike area. The park's name was received from the military leader in the 19th century.
* Small, with an assortment of nonvenomous snakes, some venomous spiders, lizards, frogs, beetles, two small monkeys and a Cayman.
* From the north of the city center towards of Ullevålsveien are the graves of Edvard Munch and Henrik Ibsen, two important cultural figures in Norway's history. It is also the burial site of a host of reputed Norwegian individuals and families.
* It surrounds the Royal Palace at the top of Karl Johan Street. Oslo's most central park is a pleasant grass-covered area with majestic old trees. Wide walkways crisscross the park.
* The park is known for its elegant apartment buildings with mature trees and hilltop views across Oslo and the fjord. It is a delightful public park on the highest hill in central Oslo. Great view of the city and surroundings. 1000 meters easy walk from Karl Johan Street along Akersgata-Ullevålsveien past Vår Frelsers Gravlund (cemetery). The park has also given name to this popular neighborhood as well as to the larger administrative district (borough) that includes major parts of central Oslo.
* This charming park has an old church and a café on the top and is your best bet if St. Hanshaugen is too crowded (only a few minutes walk away).
 
Do
* A local guide takes you along all of Oslo’s highlights. In a few hours, you will get familiar with the city and afterward, you could rent a bike and explore the city on your own.
* 
* Hovedøya, Gressholmen, or Langøyene are wonderful places to spend a sunny day. There is also a bathing bus (number 87) running from mid-June to mid-August from Jernbanetorvet to the brilliant beaches of Hvervenbukta, Bestemorstranda, and Ingierstrand. Ingierstrand is a 1930s bathing resort with very special functionalist architecture. Also at Bygdøy, Snarøya, and further out towards Asker, you will find several great beaches. During the summer months, the water temperature will, perhaps surprisingly for many foreigners, be very pleasant and beaches will be packed. Outdoor swimming pools can be found at Frognerparken and Tøyenbadet.
* Discover the city and its major tourist sites by bike, from April through October.
* Be sure to check their event calendar, every week they have concerts with a variety of international and Norwegian bands and/or DJs. Each Sunday there is a free jazz/blues/soul concert. Walk up the river from the center and you'll find it. Old factory-style houses with lots of graffiti.
* Explore Oslo with a historic vessel or spend a summer evening in the Oslo Fjord.
* Kayaking & packrafting tours, courses, and paddleboarding. Also, Mad Goats are available to introduce the floating saunas.
* The area around Holmenkollen (T-bane 1) is well suited for cross-country skiing, but also a nice area for hiking during summertime. While you are there, you can also visit the ski museum which is located close to the ski jump.
* Silent Oslo Fjordcruise, Oslo Dinner Cruise, Brunch & Bubbles, Morning Yoga Cruise and Electric afterwork.
* Akerselva is considered clean north of Nydalen. The best spot may be at Frysja (bus 22-25-54 to Stillatorget). Don't forget that many of the lakes in "Oslomarka" are for swimming and recreation, but a couple of the major lakes (Maridalsvannet in particular) are drinking water for the city. Buy a map and bring your swimming gear!
* 
* 
* Nice gateways to the beautiful nature are T-bane to Frognerseteren (line 1), Sognsvann (line 6), Romsås (line 5), Bogerud (line 3), Skullerud (line 3) or Ellingsrudåsen (line 2), or the train to Movatn or Snippen (local trains towards Hakadal, Roa, Jaren and Gjøvik). Also, bus 56 from Storo (tram 11, 12, 13 and T-bane) to Solemskogen or bus 51 from Nydalen (bus 37, T-bane 4, 5 and 6) to Maridalen offer fantastic possibilities for walks and rural life, everything less than half an hour from the city center. Bring something to drink and a chocolate bar (and do a bit of planning, buses 51 and 56 and the train seldom run more than once every half hour, less on weekends). Be prepared for some muddy sections of the trail as they take you through some pretty thickly wooded areas. The forest is dense enough that any damp areas of the trail don't dry out. This isn't helped by the multitude of small run-offs flowing down the mountain.
* 
* Two courses with 9 holes Crazy Minigolf. This is a challenging and fun experience you won't soon forget. Try them. On the way, you will be served something good in a glass. Team up with your friends or colleagues for play. It is approx. 45 minutes to play through 9 holes.
* 

* If you are interested in classical music or jazz check the program of this hall.
* 
* Some of Oslos best stages for music. Rockefeller houses three stages while Sentrum Scene houses a fourth and larger stage. Mostly concert stages but they also show the odd football match or cinema. Both Norwegian and international artists.
* There are plenty of islands perfect for relaxing and swimming. Ferries depart from Vippetangen and Aker Brygge in the city center. There are beaches at Huk, Bygdøy as well (Bus 30 to Bygdøy), as well as Katten and Ingierstrand. A new harbor bath opened in 2015 in Sørenga, the new development just south-east of the Oslo S/Opera-area.
* The ski jump located on the west side of Oslo, which was rebuilt for the World Ski Championships in 2011. It first opened in 1892 and has been rebuilt many times since then. It had more than 1 million visitors every year and was one of the biggest tourist attractions in Norway. There is also the oldest ski museum in the world, opened in 1923. Walking and mountain bike riding are popular activities here during the summer.
* 
* For the fun buy a cheap sled or "akebrett", or rent a proper one from Frognerseteren, and sleigh down from Frognerseteren to Midtstuen station. This was actually the venue of the sleighing competitions in the 1952 Winter Olympics, and the hill is referred to as "Korketrekkeren" (the corkscrew). If you buy a day card for the subway, you can race all day long, but make sure you are well dressed, as you are going to get wet.
* One more park in the eastern Oslo. A lot of activities all day long and especially on the weekends there; ball play, pick-nick, public barbecue, especially nice area for children. Be somewhat careful walking through here at night if you're drunk and dressed lightly.
* Vålerenga is a multi-sports club from the eastern part of Oslos inner city. Their football department is one of the major teams in Norway, with a new stadium opened in 2017 after more than 100 years in exile playing at different venues in the city. Tickets can be bought online at ticketmaster.no, or at the club shop currently located at the stadium at Intility Arena, near Helsfyr T-bane station.

Work
Oslo is the capital and the most populated city in the country, the administrative, economic, and cultural center of Norway. The city has grown so much in recent years, that it has completely devoured the region's territory. Almost 25% of the population in Oslo comes from abroad. Norway is famous for its incredible level of equality, tolerance, and acceptance. The city region is growing and building up a new positive reputation - a hub of innovation, a major international business player, and a place of concentration for the most talented experts. Since Oslo invests a lot in the training of knowledge corridors, technology parks, city quarters general business infrastructure, and coworking spaces, the city is considered a future-proof location. If you're looking for work check out the website of the governmental agency NAV or other sites that can easily be found online, specially geared towards workers from outside of Norway. Even though Oslo is considered an expensive city for companies currently located in the capital of Norway and those companies that would like to locate in Oslo, the city itself provides a number of beneficial solutions. Coworking Oslo is one of the most popular solutions among sole proprietorships, medium-sized companies, and Start-Ups. Flexibility, reasonable price, free and fast internet connection, close distance to public transport stops, 27/7 access, administrative support, telephone system, security, cleaning, and other benefits are what modern office Oslo workspace offers to arrive in Norway companies, people who have a working trip to Norway and even digital nomads.

Buy
In 2010 Oslo was ranked the most expensive city in the world. Still, there are possibilities for getting bargains in Oslo during the big sales. The prices of famous brands are not higher in Oslo than in London or Paris, often lower even if they are not on sale. The big sales are in January and August.

Shopping Districts

If you are out to shop there's plenty to choose from. The main pedestrian street Karl Johans Gate has plenty of shops of dubious quality. The street Bygdøy allé (which is locally famous for its chestnut trees) (bus 20, 31) has regained its reputation of being a shopping street in the past few years through establishments that focus on kitchens, kitchenware, interior designs, exclusive Norwegian furniture, light design, and others. The street Møllergata (downtown, public transport from stops Stortorget and Møllerveien at either end of the street) was earlier known as the furniture street. You will still find a few good, but rather expensive shops for Norwegian furniture on this street. You can easily find this street close to the Christiania Glasmagasin and the street Torggata which contains a few home interior shops like KID, Hemtex, and Åhlens (with a Muji department in the basement). Akersgata is famous for several exclusive shops as well as the high-end shopping center Eger at Egertorget. Bogstadveien is a high-end shopping street. Good for non-chain stores, focus on clothes and accessories.
* A seaside shopping and nightlife center with high prices, but lots of glam and fun.
* Byporten is connected to the Central station. This shopping mall is focusing on everything. The traveler's choice! A lot of designer stuff, branded clothing, travel stuff, and more.
* dates back to the 18th century, where you can find souvenirs, crystal, china, fashion, kitchenware, interior design and much more. The department store is famous for its large area of cosmetic sales.
* a big shopping center just across the street from the Central station. The shopping center is focused on the young people.
* an upmarket, central shopping center.
* One of Oslo's oldest department stores and is newly renovated and very stylish with a number of clothing shops with famous brands as well as a cosmetic and an interior design floor. On top, you will find an outdoor cafe with a view all over the city center and the surroundings.

Specialty Stores
* Convenience store, but it has many other activities.
* One of Oslo's oldest and most traditional baby stores. It is famous for its celebrity shoppers like the Princess of Norway Märtha Louise and the Crown Princess Mette-Marit.
* Book shop.
* A store for both tall and solid men, sizes range form 3X to 9X with decent formal and informal clothes.

Eat
There are a lot of both expensive and cheap places to eat in Oslo. The cheapest restaurants are Asian restaurants which in many cases serve good food at low prices. Check the menus on the door. 

Buy at least one Hot dog. They are referred to as "pølse" and they are great for keeping the low blood sugar troll at bay and increasing your weight! Other street snacks are also available throughout the city, but it's usually more expensive than in comparable cities elsewhere.

Aker Brygge (tram 12, bus 21, 32, 33, or 54; stops Aker Brygge, Vika Atrium or Bryggetorget) is a waterfront located south of the city hall. During summer the area is very noisy and vibrant. There are outdoor restaurants and bars almost everywhere. Be sure to get some tasty seafood (or whatever else you like to eat) while you are there, or just enjoy your cold beer in the summer sea breeze. Be advised that this is also the most expensive area in Oslo to dine or drink, so unless the weather is good, you can just as well stay indoors somewhere else. 

Sven's, located near Vika Atrium, offers a fast food version of a traditional dietary staple - lutefisk. Sides include herring, pickled vegetables, and salted meats. Because of the amount of lye used to treat the food, be prepared to sign a waiver upon entry. 

You are also close to most of the restaurants, bars, or nightclubs located within the city center. A key reference point will be Stortingsgaten, running parallel to Karl Johans gate, both running eastwards from the Royal Palace (this is also the main shopping area). While both of these streets have a few restaurants and nightclubs, most will be found in one of the side streets running out from them, or parallel to them. It doesn't matter much where you start, you will find restaurants, bars, and nightclubs almost anywhere from the subway station National Theatre on the west, to far beyond Oslo Central Railroad Station on the east. There are several other areas, such as Grünerløkka (tram 11-12-13 to Nybrua, Schous plass, Olaf Ryes plass or Birkelunden), Majorstuen (T-bane, tram 11-12-19 or bus 20-22-25-45-46 to Majorstua), and Grønland (T-bane to Grønland, bus 37 to Tøyengata or bus 60 to Norbygata) that are worth checking out. Be advised that nearly all bars and nightclubs close at the same time, so if you want to get a taxi back to your hotel, try to leave a few minutes before the rush starts. 

Budget
Torggata
Torggata is getting more upmarket. However, you may still find budget dining, like cheap Vietnamese, Thai, and Chinese restaurants and even cheaper kebab joints and pizzerias, as well as other offerings. It's close to the center, but you can get bus 34 or 54 to Jacob kirke/Calmeyers gate or tram 11-12-13-17/bus 30-31 to Brugata or Hausmanns gate. The closest T-bane station is Grønland (then walk north along Brugata) or Jernbanetorget (then walk northeast).

Some great offerings in this area include:
* The best pizza joint in the area also does decent kebabs.
* Vietnamese. Simple interiour but very popular among people who appreciate authentic Vietnamese food. Dishes and beverages at affordable prices.
* The first of the Vietnamese bargain offerings are still going strong. Although the food in Vietnam is known to be tastier, you'll need a plane ticket to Hanoi to get it this cheap! (at least it feels like that when you're used to Norwegian food prices).
* Seems to be packed with locals at all times. Thai food is OK but a bit bland.

Grønland
Gronland is full of cheap eating joints, shops selling fabrics and jewellery, Indian and Pakistani sweet shops, cheap beer and more. Some of the best treats are:
* A Turkish cafeteria with no-frills, decent food. Meals are pricier and less exquisite than they used to be.
* The friendliest Sikh in the world dishes out cheap, tasty Indian food from the microwave or stove. No real tandoor here.
* Great tasting sushi meals. Also have small daily specials (fried rice, fried noodles etc.).
* The neighboring Pakistan cuisine restaurant of the Punjab Tandoori is even cheaper, but the helpings are smaller and packs less of a punch.

Norwegian Food 
Most cafes and restaurants serving traditional food are upmarket, but there are a couple of good spots to get stuffed on meat cakes and brown gravy, lutefisk and other delicacies:
* Old-style beer hall serving delicious meat-and potato-dishes. Tuesdays are Eisbein day, be there!

* Dark drinking den with delicious, traditional, cheap and fattening Norwegian food.

Elsewhere
* Voted Oslos best kebab many times, not the cheapest place, but good value for money. There are several other branches across town. However, if you want authentic kebab try Torggata or the beginning of Trondheimsveien.
* Net of Fast food restaurants.
* Cheap and popular indian restaurant, often full during the weekends. Cash only.
* Opened in 1901, this is a cafeteria-style eatery with coffee and homemade cakes. A great place to try an authentic Norwegian meal, without spending an enormous amount of money.
* Beduin-style restaurant run by Palestinians. Falafels, tagine, etc. Good for lunch or dinner. Friendly staff and low prices.
* It is an indoor food hall located in an old factory building in Maridalsveien 17. It's on the edge of Grünerløkka in an area called Vulkan. Here you can shop both local Norwegian produce and international food, go for a quick snack or two, have a drink in Norway's longest bar, or just hang out and enjoy the atmosphere.
* Nothing fancy at all, but you get very tasty Thai food very fast very cheap. They also have a take-away only branch (and shop) in Nordre gate 15-17 at Grünerløkka.
* The restaurant offers good sushi for a nice price. Featuring about 10 seats, the place could be considered more a take-away than an actual restaurant.
* Good sushi at low prices. Takeaway Vietnamese spring rolls.
* It has some excellent Turkish dishes. Burgers, pizza and breakfast are also available. A cozy place with occasional unexpected classical music played early in the day.
* The best baguettes downtown. Delivers lashings of filling on their allmighty subs. Also chicken breast, fish and beef burgers.
* The canteen is open to the public, and offers good, sumptuous meals at even lower prices than the student canteens. Not many tourists know about the place, so it can be a very quiet place to have a meal. They sell salads, sandwiches, boiled potatoes, cereal bars and other snacks.
* Oslo's best budget Thai offering.
* Their burgers are famous. Limited seating, but there is a very small park close to it where you can enjoy your food.

Mid-range
* The most upmarket offering in Oslo's Bermuda Triangle of cheap eating, Arakataka manages to pull off decent French and Mediterranean cuisine at decent prices.
* Looks scruffy from the outside, but don't let that fool you. A fantastic Indian restaurant with all the trimmings.
* When Eik took over the sadly missed gourmet Annen Etage, the food actually got better and cheaper.
* The least upmarket of the central gourmet offerings, Eik consintently get rave reviews and doles out a fine five-course gourmet menu for around NOK 400. Fantastic. Bib Gourmand award in the Michelin guide.
* Elvebredden has some fantastic lunch offerings as well as stunning, but fairly upmarket, main dishes in the evening.
* Good Indian restaurant.
* East-Asian and sushi.
* Big, tasty portions and very reasonable prices.
* Lovely neighborhood joint with brilliant food and occasional free concerts.
* Cal-mex joint offering huge meals, but reports say quality has faded. Another branch near the crossing of Hegdehaugsveien/Sporveisgata in Homansbyen (tram 11-19 to Rosenborg) does little to redeem this.
* A friendly Japanese and Korean restaurant. They serve some tasty shabu shabu and bulgogi here.
* One of the best known and largest places in east Oslo. Restaurant, beer Hall, nightclub, and roof terrace. Recently refurbished, with classic Norwegian food.
* Brilliant all-Asian restaurant with inventive dishes.
* Vying with Oslo Ladegård and Villa Paradiso to have the best pizza in Oslo.
* A down to earth restaurant with tasty, honest European food on a menu which is changed three times a day. Highly recommended if you're looking for a friendly and relaxed atmosphere. For private parties they also have a separate 60s-style living room for rent.
* Atmospheric restaurant in an old wooden house area with tons of charm.
* A short walk from the Anker hostel, this place has become quite fashionable. Lovely outdoor seating, great (but a tad expensive) food, and a marvelous dining room.
* Sushi and korean dishes.
* Share great Italian food with your friends in this two story trattoria. Highly recommended.
* Excellent pizza at Grünerløkka.

Splurge
If money is no object, there is some very fine dining to be found. If there is anything Oslo has a lot of, it is expensive restaurants.
* 
* One of the finest Chinese restaurants in Oslo. Specializes in the Szechuan and Cantonese kitchen. Their Peking Duck, which must be pre-ordered the day before, is a true feast.
* An architectural monument, this place offers gourmet dining and Oslo's best views. Hugely popular but the service can disappoint.
* Great Japanese fusion restaurant where you can enjoy sushi, izakaya, and robata dishes by the seaside.
* 
* A small place with outstanding food, small seasonal menu.
* This New Nordic Cuisine restaurant serving organic, local food jumped straight to two stars Michelin Guide Rouge at the earliest opportunity after opening, the first Nordic restaurant to do so. Getting a table here is hard, they literally disappear the same second they're available, so book as early as possible.
* Highly recommended gourmet restaurant where the menu changes daily according to the chef's mood and available ingredients. A ten-course meal costs about NOK 850 per person. Only 23 seats and no reservations, but a good bar to while away the hours waiting for food.
* A feast for everyone involved, except perhaps your wallet. Exquisite dining at corporate prices. 
* Arguably one of Oslo's finest seatings. Set in a beautiful 1800-century mansion, the combination of very friendly staff and extraordinary dishes makes it well worth its one star in the Michelin Guide. Not one to miss.
* Pretending to be a classic upmarket Wiener Café with a continental menu. What you get on the plate may only have a passing resemblance to the description on the menu. Staggeringly overpriced and excruciatingly "culture-posh", you might just get better food from the Asian take-away in the removable kiosk across the street for a fraction of the price. However, being "the" classic Café in Oslo, the experience may just be worth it if your wallet is running thick.

Drink
Buying alcohol in stores
Beer can be purchased in supermarkets for a 0.5l can. Supermarkets stop selling beer after 8 p.m. each day, 6 p.m. on Saturdays, and 3 p.m. on holiday weekends. It is not possible to buy beer in a shop on a Sunday. It is illegal to drink in public areas. You will usually only get a warning if spotted by a police officer, but if you behave impolitely or he/she is having a bad day you can get a fine. However, in public parks during summer, laws are not enforced as strictly. Good places to go for a park beer are Sofienbergparken and Kuba at Grünerløkka, Frognerparken in Majorstua, or the park at St. Hanshaugen, on a hill with a great view located between Grünerløkka and Majorstuen.

Hard liquor or wine can only be bought at international airport terminals or state-owned shops called Vinmonopolet Vinmonopolet outlets are open Mon-Fri till 6 PM, Sat till 3 PM, Sun closed. Some of the central Vinmonopolet outlets in Oslo are:

Pubs and bars
All bars, pubs, and restaurants in Oslo are smoke-free, which means you have to go outside to smoke. But since you can't drink on the street, you have to leave your drink inside, unless the bar/pub has a designated drink area that is still open (they always close earlier than the venues themselves). Closing hours are as late as 03:30 in the city center. National legislation says you can't serve any alcohol after 03:00. Oslo has a flourishing craft beer scene, mostly (but not exclusively) centered around Torggata. Oslo is generally expensive. 

Areas with notable pub density are Grünerløkka (tram 11-12-13 to Nybrua, Schous plass, Olaf Ryes plass or Birkelunden), Aker Brygge (tram 12 to Aker Brygge or bus 21-32-33-54 to Vika Atrium or Bryggetorget), Solli/Frogner (tram 12-13 or bus 30-31 to Solli), Grønland (T-bane to Grønland, bus 37 to Tøyengata or bus 60 to Norbygata) and the city center especially Youngstorget or Grensen.
* Shows most football matches on LCD TVs.
* A popular pub with a fair selection of Norwegian and foreign beers. In addition to enjoying good beer, it's possible to play darts and get a slice of pizza. Every Monday an international beer course is held here by Ølakademiet 
* The best place to watch football (soccer) and sports in general, and to have a cheapish beer. Owned by supporters of the Vålerenga Sports Association.
* This is the Brewdog bar in Oslo.
* Huge two story craft beer bar and café with a large number of tap lines and a good bottle selection. Two pop-up places for food, ping-pong, shuffleboards and more.
* Craft brewery with a good selection of their own and guest brews, both Norwegian and domestic.
* Whisky bar with wide selection. over 500 whiskies, and several fantastic rums and over 60 beers on bottle. But the management and security do not show enough respect to the customers even they are regular.
* A nice Irish pub a little off Karl Johans gate, does a good fish and chips (and a few rounds of Guinness with which to wash it down). In Norway: Good fish? Always! Good chips? Never! Except maybe here.
* Rock 'n Roll bar with a clientele ranging from metal fans to people waiting for the train. Excellent burgers and a decent craft beer selection. Sometimes has live music and DJs with cover charge.
* Intimate and lively pub and resturaunt which serves unpretentious, good food. There you will find not only sandwiches but also Skipperburger, the all-day breakfast Egg&Bacon & the soup of the day, always vegetarian - the day's variation varies. On the drinks menu, you will find plenty of delicious Norwegian beer, juices from local producers, and the largest of Norway's aquavit menu. They have an outstanding collection of akevitt (akvavit), the Scandinavian potato spirit that you should check out, though you won't necessarily love it unconditionally.
* pizza and music, lots of beer and cocktails. Brilliant place that once was the heyday of hipness, a reputation it has to leave to its own basement (The Villa) and Revolver, just down the street. Still a good corner to drop into.
* Strangely named due to Norwegian alcohol laws, this is the Mikkeller bar in Oslo.
* Official Arsenal supporter pub in Norway.
* a neighborhood bar customers, mostly returning, at every time of the day (from 8 AM). The staff is great! The service is impeccable despite the low prices and the very unpretentious surroundings (and clientele).
* Gastropub and craft beer bar in the Vålerenga Fotball stadium, open every day. Descent selection of craft beer. On match days the area outside becomes a fanzone filled with happy families and loud fans. Try the burger.
* Craft beer bar with 70 tap lines of craft beer and mead, as a bottle room. 
* Conveniently close to Anker Hostel, Cafe Sara pours beer and dishes up tasty Turkish and tex-mex dishes for not too much money. Great outdoor seating. Very nice pub with a great atmosphere and is well known for its cheap but great food. Good selection of craft beer, and often something very rare on tap.
* Indian cuisine and cheap beer in an informal setting. No name on the door, just a chair hanging from above the door (hence the name 'the chair').
* Established in 1958, this is the only bar in Oslo that's protected by cultural authorities, due to its true '50s setting with original interior. This is where the rockabilly cats and kittens hang out and low-key rock and film stars lurk in the corners. Teddy's brought milk shakes to Norway, but sadly they've stopped serving those. They do serve beer, wine, spirits, soft drinks, and various coffee drinks. And you can have lunch or late breakfast (omelets, eggs & bacon, sandwiches) or dinner (nice burgers, soups). Music provided by an original Wurlitzer jukebox with mostly '50s and '60s hits.
* Lovely cafe serving beer, wine, drinks and small dishes in a fabulous former pharmacy. (Tekehtopa spelled backward, apotheket, actually means "the pharmacy" in Norwegian.) One of the prettiest cafes around! Adjoined by Bar Babylon, an industrial-style club with wonderful backyard seating.
* Tilt is a retro game-themed bar with 80s arcade machines, shuffleboard, pinball, and memorabilia. A good selection of Norwegian and imported craft beer.

Coffee
Oslo is ranked as one of the best coffee cities in the world and you will find cafés serving good coffee everywhere. Serious chains like Kaffebrenneriet and Stockfleths are worth a visit, but there are numerous other great places. To mention a very few:
* To enter Fuglen is like enter a living room from the 60s. Not only do they serve great coffee, but they also sell retro furniture and vintage design. In the summer of 2012 Fuglen also opened a branch in Shibuya, Tokyo.
* Great espresso bar located next to the St. Hanshaugen park. 
* Good coffee in Briskeby, Frogner.
* Tim Wendelboe is a micro roastery and espresso bar in Grünerløkka serving what's considered by many the best coffee in the world. Tim Wendelboe means business. It's a tiny establishment and seating is scarce. If you want a simple black coffee you will most probably be pointed to a small lab-like room where the coffee will be made for you. So if you like great coffee this is an obligatory stop. They also arrange barista courses.

Rock music
* Sandwiched between a theatre and Hard Rock Cafe this gem is easily overlooked. One of the best (and longest-lasting) rock/punk/metal/indie pubs in Norway.
* Rock pub with most of Oslo's hipsters lurking in the corners. Not too expensive, and quite an extensive choice of beers on tap.
 
Gay
* 
* The largest gay and lesbian Venue in Oslo.

Sleep
Getting a hotel in Oslo can potentially be difficult. In peak periods, when big fairs or conferences visit Oslo, tourists have been sent as far as Lillehammer (170 km, 2h 15 min by train) to find accommodation. It would be smart to reserve a room in advance. There are also relatively few youth hostels, etc., for backpackers and people traveling on a budget. During Nobel Prize week room availability will fall and prices may double.

Budget

Camping
If you bring or buy a tent, you can take public transport to for instance Nordmarka (forest area north of the city), and stay for free. See the Norway page for legislation details regarding camping.
* Bogstad has cabins as well as tent space. Price - e.g. one adult, one child, one tent - NOK 185. Less than a stone's throw from the campsite there is a mini mart Kiwi (used by the locals), a petrol station Statoil with heat-up fast food options, and a fast food restaurant Jafs! which does pizzas, kebabs, and burgers.
* Open June 1- September 1. The closest campsite to central Oslo. Beautiful view of the city. No cabins. Owned by the Norwegian Automobile Federation. Mini-golf and horse rental. Fully equipped sanitary facilities: showers with hot and cold water, toilets, kitchen, launderette.
* Not an official campsite; however, Langøyene Island allows free camping (tents only). You may only stay for 2 days unless you have special permission. You must keep the island clean. Police have their own boats and enforce these laws via hefty fines.

Hostels
* Very centrally located, 5 minutes walk to the central station or Grünerløkka. Beds may be cheap but renting bedsheets is required, which costs 50 extra. Factor that in.
* The biggest HI hostel in Oslo. Not too far from the action (but it is hard to find), walking distance to the lively neighborhoods of Torshov and Grünerløkka. Located in a very quiet area of Oslo, this is a place you'd go to sleep, not to party. The breakfast is outstanding for a hostel and is vegan-friendly, although with reduced choice. It is advisable to reconfirm your booking before you come and inform us at what time you are going to arrive although the reception is open 24 hours.
* Open June 1 - August 19. 7.5 km from the center.

Hotels
* Centrally located, next to the Royal Palace and Slottsparken. Three types of rooms to meet all budgets. They don't serve breakfast but have an agreement with a nearby cafe.
* Affordable hotel, centrally located with nice rooms. Simple breakfast delivered to your door.

* A short walk to the main street, as well as easy walking distance to public transportation, airport shuttle bus and a vast variety of shops, restaurants, museums, and theatres.

* 

Splurge
* Family-run hotel has a large Vienna-style cafe (Theatercafeen) which is the place to be seen in Oslo. Outstanding service and prices to match, still considered fair value for money. Nice quiet bar with original Edvard Munch lithographs.
* The hotel where Nobel Peace Prize winners stay when coming to Oslo for the award ceremony. Expensive and lots of services. Excellent view over main street Karl Johans gate. Grand Café, at street level, was Henrik Ibsen's daily watering hole and is Norway's answer to Vienna's Cafe Landtmann.

Contact
Internet access
Most of the internet cafes are located in the eastern part of town or Grønland. Look for small shops selling telephone cards - they usually have internet terminals. If you carry your own laptop, WLANs will be easy to find at cafes, hotels, bars, and even in parks. There are several open Wi-Fi connections in the upper-level cafes at the train station Oslo Central Station and the subway station at Grønland.
* Free wifi and 30 minutes of free use of computer terminals at all locations.
* On the first and second floor, there is several automated stands alone computers setup for basic internet surfing, as well as an Internet cafe in the bus terminal next to the central station.
* Free use of computer terminal for 30 minutes for people 26 and under, although age is rarely checked. Also, get another information there.

Stay safe

Crime
Crime is not a big problem in Oslo, but as in any metropolitan area, some caution is warranted. Avoid getting into quarrels in taxi queues after the closing hours of bars. The police advise that the area along the Akerselva River from Grønland to Kuba is best avoided after dark falls. It is notorious for multiple instances of rape, muggings, and drug dealing. 

There has been a relative increase of rape in Oslo. Authorities have increased the frequency of patrols and have made arrests. Women should remain highly vigilant at night, and when clubs and pubs are closing. Avoid walking alone through parks and poorly lit areas of the city. Do not, under any circumstances, use “pirate taxis” or other unofficial forms of transportation. 

The lower parts of Karl Johan Street (down towards the Central station) are best avoided at night. Be aware of prostitutes approaching you; they often do pickpocketing by coming close to you, flirting, and trying to hold around you. And, for the record: buying sex is strictly illegal in Norway, and can result in a heavy fine.

Since some time back, drug dealers and addicts have now less prevalent than before around the Central Station (Oslo S). This is partly due to crackdowns by police. Currently, the drug trade has mainly moved to the area around Brugata, Hausmanns Gate, and Torggata. It is possible that drugs might be offered to tourists passing by, but the dealers will accept no for an answer and won't further hassle you. The area is also crowded at most hours.

Theft and pickpocketing is a relatively visible problem in some parts of Oslo. Police blame itinerant criminal bands from abroad for some of it. Normal precautionary rules apply:
* Watch out for pickpockets in crowds. Especially packed trams and buses passing through the eastern part of the city (Grønland, Grünerløkka).
* Do not leave your belongings unattended.
* Avoid leaving your cell phone and wallet on café tables.

Homophobic crime is not a huge problem in the city as a whole, but LGBT persons should avoid physical signs of affection, at least in the districts of Grønland and Tøyen due to a large and fairly conservative Muslim immigrant population in the area - there have been cases of homophobic violence in this area in recent years.

Inner-city areas such as Grønland and Tøyen have smaller gangs operating locally, so be vigilant after dark. The chances that something might happen are very slim, but these areas top all statistics in Norway when it comes to crime, assault, and robbery.

Politics
Politics is a none-too-sensitive subject in Norway and is often discussed in public. Like in other Western countries, political views differ, and most people seem to tolerate this. There are both far-right and far-left opinions in the everyday crowd, but true extremism is rare. Pay normal attention when expressing your political opinions; violent and autocratic ideologies are generally not tolerated in Norway. In addition, being a highly diverse city, racism and sexism is generally not tolerated among most people in Oslo as in other European cities. In environmental policies, Norwegians have a fairly European-minded attitude when climate issues are discussed, but fewer people (including activists) will be vegetarian.

Traffic
Cars are required to yield to pedestrians at marked and signed crossings and will be heavily fined if they don't. However, this rule does not apply to trams (streetcars); the trams have the right of way. Oslo has a web of tram lines downtown and as the trams are fast and heavy, you will certainly lose if you attempt to challenge one.

In recent years there has been a surge of electric scooters for rent around Oslo. Even if there are restrictions on the use of these, they are, unfortunately, not usually enforced. The result of this is that the streets are full of people driving around on the scooters, and unfortunately many show an utter disregard for traffic safety rules and fellow pedestrians. Be attentive and stay vigilant of the scooters when walking around downtown Oslo.

Water
Oslo has one of the world’s cleanest drinking water supplies. It comes from lakes and rivers in Oslomarka and is treated at a waterworks before it reaches the tap. Drinking water from the tap is perfectly safe and is both cheaper for you and better for the environment.

Winter conditions
In winter watch out for icy patches, and when wandering in the forest beware when crossing snowy clearings - they may well be frozen lakes with snow over them, which may look safe but could crack. Finally, beware of snow and icicles falling from the roofs in Oslo - there are usually red/yellow signs upwards, and some areas are occasionally cordoned off.

Cope
It is easy to get around in Oslo, and almost every Norwegian speaks English. Most people will respond in English to any question you may have. Some Norwegians also speak some German or French.

Get out
* used to be a totally unremarkable industrial city dubbed "the biggest road crossing of Norway". Even if traffic is still rife, the city has gone through a facelift, and the center is as cozy as any. TIMEkspressen bus line 1 (every hour, day and night) and 10, and 3 trains an hour gets you there and away.
* is another of the picturesque, small seaside towns dotted all over southern Norway, and the closest to Oslo. A nice place to get away from the big city bustle, even if Drøbak also can become crowded in summer. Buses run at least hourly.
* is a very enjoyable city not far from Oslo, with a walled old town and lots of street life in summer. Trains run approx. every hour (taking 1h10min), and express buses run about 10 times per day (1h 30min).
* is a beautiful city well-known for its silver mining history. The city is located about an hour and a half west of Oslo by train or bus. The Kongsberg International Jazz Festival is hosted here every year in early July.
* is the 120 km long fjord on which Oslo is situated at the bottom of Oslo. The outer part of the fjord is the most tourist-friendly, with thousands of islands and hundreds of beaches situated near a line of cities containing 8 of the 20 largest urban areas in Norway. All of these cities are reached most easily by taking the Inter City-trains bound for , or boats from Vippetangen (+91-92-93-94), bus 60 runs to the quay). During the summer island hopping in the is recommended.
* Oslomarka is the 20 to 40 km wide forest surrounding the city. This is an important recreational area for the citizens of Oslo, and quite unique for a capital. Take the T-bane to Holmenkollen (line 1), Frognerseteren (line 1), Sognsvann (line 3) or Skullerud (line 3 - in the opposite direction of Sognsvann), bus 41 from Røa T-bane to Sørkedalen or bus 51 from Nydalen T-bane to Maridalen. You can also visit the tourist association at Storgata (at Kirkeristen tram stop) for good maps and inexpensive accommodation alternatives in Oslomarka.
* Son is also one of the coastal pearls. Take a local train to Moss, alight at Sonsveien station, and take the bus that meets most (but not all) trains.
* is an attractive seaside town with an attractive city center. It's the oldest town in Norway, and even if this isn't instantly visible, there's lots of history to digest. Excellent highways will take you to the city in an hour from Oslo. The train takes around 1h 10min.
