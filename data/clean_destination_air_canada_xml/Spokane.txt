Spokane is a city in eastern . It is the second largest city in Washington State in the region and the largest in the Inland Northwest and Eastern Washington.

The city and its history is defined by the Spokane River, which flows directly through the city, cascading over a series of waterfalls in the heart of downtown. For thousands of years before the arrival of European fur-traders and explorers in the area in the early 1800s, the river had been a gathering place and an abundant source of salmon for the Spokane and other tribal peoples. As the city developed and homesteaders settled the area, the Spokane River became polluted, cover by bridges and railroad yards. In 1974, the river and much of downtown was reclaimed during Expo 74, the world's first environmentally-themed World's Fair. 

Shaped by its geography, Spokane's urban area is highly varied, due in large part to its location in a valley at the junction of the semi-arid scablands of the Columbia Plateau to the west, the rolling and fertile farmland of the Palouse to the south, and the Selkirk and Rocky Mountains to the north and east.

 Understand 
Pronunciation
The city is pronounced as "spo-CAN," but often mispronounced as "spo-CANE."

Basics

Fortunately, Seattle/Tacoma International Airport offers flights to most major international destinations and is only a short 45-minute flight from Spokane. As a result, the inland Northwest is easily accessible worldwide with just one plane change. Most major airlines serving Spokane are:

Spokane is located at the point where westbound trains are split in half, one half going to Seattle through the Cascades and the other half to Portland OR-Vancouver WA along the Columbia River Gorge, and where eastbound trains from those cities are joined together to continue eastward. The Empire Builder connects with Amtrak's Coast Starlight & Cascades in and and additional trains in Chicago. The Amtrak intermodal station, which is shared with Greyhound buses, is located downtown, close to major hotels and attractions at 221 W 1st Ave.

Get around

By Bus

Spokane Transit (STA) offers reliable, easy-to-use local bus service from Cheney to Liberty Lake and Deer Park to the southern boundary of the City of Spokane. Most routes run through downtown Spokane and the STA Plaza. Bus route maps can be found online, on Spokane Transit buses, and at the STA Plaza. Most drivers are very friendly and helpful, so ask any questions you may have. STA operates using two-hour and all-day passes.

By Car
Car rentals are available near Spokane International Airport. All of the major companies are located there. Returning cars at the airport can be a little confusing. The main entrance to the rental return is an entire mile before the airport terminal (left at Flint Rd.) You can also drop off passengers and turn right at Flint Rd. just past the terminal. Note there are no directional signs for rental cars between these two places. 

Interstate 90 is an excellent way to cross town East-West. Spokane is accessed from exits #276 ("Geiger Blvd/S Grove Rd") through #285 ("Sprague Ave") along I-90. To get to downtown from I-90 eastbound, exit off at 280 and follow signs to Walnut St and go north on Walnut or continue along parallel road (4th Ave) to Lincoln. If coming off the westbound lanes exit at #280A and follow signs to Lincoln St and go north on Lincoln into downtown. A north-south freeway is under construction, and won't be finished for many years. Allow more time if you have to go very far in this direction, as there's no express route yet. 

Check with Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) for current driving conditions. 

Locally the road running east & west as Sprague Ave (through downtown & all the way through ) & W Riverside(west of downtown, west of Walnut St) divides the addresses & streets from "North" & "South" while Division St (US Hwy 2 and 395 going north from I-90) (going north & south) divides the addresses & streets from "West" & "East".

By Bike
Within the past five years, Spokane has rapidly developed its bicycling infrastructure, adding both protected and unprotected bike lanes, traffic-separated bike trails and paths, and bike parking areas downtown and in major commercial districts. As a result, biking is a convenient and desirable way to commute. Within the six-month period from April to October when the weather is most reliably bicyclist-friendly, it is not uncommon to see throngs of bicycle commuters traveling downtown or to the various districts, like South Perry and Garland. Many employers now offer showers and changing facilities to their employees to encourage cycling. A decent map of area bike lanes and trails can be found at 

All Spokane Transit buses feature bike racks with space for two bikes, adding to possible destinations.

The Centennial Trail runs along the Spokane River from downtown Coeur d'Alene on through the Spokane Valley and downtown Spokane ending in Riverside State Park. The nationally-recognized trail is a favorite among bicyclists, runners, and skaters. Be on the lookout for the particularly dramatic section near Mile 23. Here trail users exit the up-and-coming Kendall Yards neighborhood to downtown (when traveling eastbound) and cross under the century-old Monroe Street Bridge, exposing world-class views of the Spokane Falls. Be sure to take enough time to enjoy this true gem that makes Spokane one of the most beautiful downtown urban areas in the United States. And don't forget a camera.

See

*Riverfront Park, centrally located in the heart of downtown on both banks of the Spokane River, was the host of the 1974 World's Fair. Many of the pavilions still exist, including the architecturally-significant U.S. Pavilion. Canada Island, the Rotary Fountain, the Spokane Falls SkyRide, and the Looff Carousel deserve particular mentions, although the site is great even just for a relaxing weekday picnic. The park itself is beautifully maintained, if a bit dated. Fortunately, the passage of a bond by local voters in 2014 means that $65 million will be pumped into Riverfront Park renovations over the next four years. Be sure to check for updates, as some attractions will be closed at various points in order to facilitate construction.

*Manito Park, located on the South Hill between 17th Ave and 25nd Ave, west of Grand Blvd and east of Bernard Street. Its steep hills make it a popular wintertime sledding spot. Home to a zoo until 1933, Manito is now a year-round home to a friendly flock of geese and ducks. Manito Park, thanks in part to its size, is home to numerous attractions. Traditional park amenities like playgrounds and grass fields mix with swaths of unmanicured native plants and beautifully maintained gardens such as the Victorian inspired Duncan Garden or the Japanese garden which was a gift from Spokane's sister city, Nishinomiya, Japan. 
*Monroe Street Bridge. Recently renovated over the course of a two-year construction period, this bridge was built in 1911 and is the largest arch bridge in the United States of America. Take an inspiring walk across the falls of the Spokane River while admiring the buffalo head sculptures adorning the covered observation decks across the span. The Monroe Street Bridge is located in the heart of Downtown immediately west of Riverfront Park.

Stay safe

People in Spokane are generally quite kind and hospitable. The city is quite safe, and violent crime is rare. That said, Spokane has had ongoing challenges with property crime and vehicle theft. As such, if parking a vehicle, be sure to lock the doors and ensure that all valuables are in the trunk. The city has had a problem with homeless drug addicts(especially the ones who are meth addicts), and passed a law that requires the homeless to only stay in the downtown area, so you probably don't have to deal with them so much in the rest of Spokane due to strict punishments if this law is viloated, but if you are downtown expect to see a heavy population of them everywhere. Also, use caution when walking through Riverfront Park or on the Centennial Trail at night.

Contact

Spokane is one of a few cities nationwide that has Wi-Fi access just about everywhere Downtown. The entire Downtown area is a Wi-Fi hotspot or an area where wireless Internet is provided free of charge (2 hours per day) if your computer is equipped for Wi-Fi.

Get out
