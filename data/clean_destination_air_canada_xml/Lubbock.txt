Lubbock is the largest city in the Great Plains region of and serves as the area's agricultural and economic hub. Lubbock, commonly known as the Hub City, is in the center of the South Plains, an expansive cotton-growing region. Lubbock has experienced steady growth for several decades and today occupies approximately 125 mi² (324 km²). The city is home to approximately 230,000 residents and students. Lubbock is the seat of Lubbock County, the site of state and national parks, two major medical systems, three universities, and is unique among other growing Texas cities in that its sustained economic development and growth are not supported by heavy industry.
Understand

History
 

Lubbock County was founded in 1876 and named after Thomas S. Lubbock, a signer of the Texas Declaration of Independence and subsequent Confederate officer. Mr. Lubbock didn't have any particular ties to the area; but the area bore his name because a state administrator penciled in names of counties on a crude map of the Panhandle - at random. The modern town of Lubbock was not established until 1890 when old-Lubbock and the smaller town of Monterey struck an unusual alliance and merged the two communities, a deal most likely initiated by rival town promoters hired by area ranchers and merchants to lobby Ft. Worth & Denver for a rail depot. The site of Monterey was chosen in lieu of the new township's name, Lubbock. Old-Lubbock's residents relocated to Monterey just south of the the Yellowhouse Canyon, dragging the Nicollete Hotel with them on rollers. Lubbock became the county seat in 1891 and incorporated as a city in 1909.

In 1923 Texas Technological College was founded after a contentious bid war among several area cities including and Plainview. The city of Lubbock was a mile away from the only campus building during its first session. 

A category F-5 tornado cut a 8-mile (13 km) gash through the city on the evening of May 11, 1970, resulting in $125 million in property damage and the loss of 26 lives. The devastation received international news coverage and was among the first natural disaster recoveries to be documented on television. The coordinated effort served as a model for disaster recovery research and planning. The destruction of several thousand homes effectively ended segregation throughout the city.

Lubbock is the largest developed area atop the Llano Estacado plateau. The area, when first explored, was a featureless grassland, and, according to legend, Spanish conquistadors drove large, brightly-colored stakes into the ground to plot their position. The region was later named the staked plains or Llano Estacado. The first settlers encountered banditos or native Comanche who would often hold new arrivals for ransom. The portion of the Caprock Escarpment just east of Lubbock is known as Ransom Canyon.

Get in

By air

Southwest Airlines, United Express, and American Eagle service the small Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport () 5 mi (8 km) north of downtown. Air travel to Lubbock will most likely require a connecting flight in Denver, Dallas or Houston, as there are few direct flights, although Southwest has nonstop flights to Las Vegas and Austin, as well as Dallas and Houston. Cab fare to the Downtown area or Texas Tech is $13 to $18. Fare to the hotels along the south and southwest beltway range from $20 to $25. Royal Coach offers posted rates from the airport into the city. The fare is based on a zoned map ranging from $6 to $24, depending on your destination.

By car

Lubbock is easily accessible by car. US 62/82, US 84, I-27, US 87 and TX 114 are well maintained roadways which allow for easy driving in and out of the city. A modern beltway, TX Loop 289, offers a quick shortcut around the city's notoriously absent congestion.

By bus

Greyhound has routes to Lubbock from Dallas, El Paso, Amarillo, and a few other places. The closed Bus Stop Diner, on the 13th St. side of the terminal, is rumored haunted by the city's transients. Travelers coming in from Dallas or El Paso sometimes switch buses in Big Spring, TX. Many northern destinations can be reached by connecting through Amarillo.

Get around

By car

Lubbock is developed along a large scale grid. North-south streets are labeled A-Z Downtown and progress to city and state names, which also proceed in alphabetical order, moving west. East-west streets are numbered from 1 to 150 or so. Streets north of Downtown follow the names of colleges and universities, while those east of Downtown are flowers and trees. Block ranges, house numbering and street names are consistent throughout the city and most follow alphabetical order. All major roadways are 1 mi (1.6 km) from each other in either direction and are uniformly straight.

* The intrastate I-27, which connects and Lubbock, terminates at the I-40 interchange.

* The interchange of 66th St., US 84 and I-27 was once the site of a notorious intersection called The Circle. Avenues A, H, Q, Tahoka Rd. and Slaton Rd. converged in a three lane vaulted hub a half-mile in diameter. Avenues Q & A were not realigned after the I-27 project covered most of Avenue H. The remaining intersection is still very tricky at the northeast corner.

* TX SR 289, often called The Loop or 289 by locals, can be congested along its southwest portion during business hours.

* The newly-completed Marsha Sharp Freeway allows for quick and easy travel between the northeast and southwest areas of the city.

By bus

The city's public transit authority, Citibus, operates fixed bus routes throughout the city. The system relies on a pulse-based schedule which originates at the Downtown Transfer Plaza. A one-way trip is $1.50, and a day pass is $3. The drivers operate electronic fare boxes and do not carry change. Most routes pass through Texas Tech University and the two medical centers. The city is quite large so using the transit may be inconvenient.

By taxi

The city's only taxicab service, Yellow Cab, is very reliable and offers reasonable fares. Reserving pick-up times is recommended. Plan your trip before calling, as the dispatchers are often extremely busy. It is best to offer your mobile phone number when arranging a pick-up. Drivers will phone you when they are a few blocks away. Yellow Cab also carries several thousand contract passengers everyday so be prepared to wait up to 45 minutes in the late afternoon or early morning. 806 765-7777, Available 24 Hours/day.

During the spring months, weather in Lubbock can grow rather tumultuous in rapid fashion. Weather warnings are not to be ignored during severe weather season.
