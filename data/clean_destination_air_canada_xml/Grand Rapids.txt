Get around

Like most mid-sized U.S. cities, an automobile is the most convenient means of getting around, with convenient free parking available most places outside of downtown. There are many paid parking ramps throughout Downtown Grand Rapids. Parking fees are usually an hourly rate of $2.50 to $3.00. Walking within the immediate downtown area is pleasant enough in good weather, and generally safe. 

Several taxi companies operate in the city, and cabs can be picked up at designated locations such as the airport, or by calling the dispatcher; cabs are usually not hailed on the street, except around the time bars close on weekends. Pedicabs are also becoming popular within the downtown area, currently operating during special events and weekend evenings.

"The Rapid" bus service has a terminal downtown, and routes throughout the city and its suburbs, running early mornings through late evenings on weekdays. Several routes run with less frequent service on Saturdays and Sundays. The buses are clean, safe, and generally on-time.

Street addresses identify the quadrant of the city by adding NW, NE, SW, or SE after the full street name. This is the same system used by , but Grand Rapids doesn't have the capital's confusing system of alphabetic and numerical street names. There are a few numbered streets just northwest of downtown, but most of the numbered streets are from 28th Street and out on the south side; the far north side instead has Three Mile Road, Four Mile Road, etc. Generally speaking, east-west roads are called "Street" and north-south roads are called "Avenue",

Interwoven bicycle paths and trails make getting around by bike within the city simple. The city website has bike route maps to make finding your way around easy.
