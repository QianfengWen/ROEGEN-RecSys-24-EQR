Get around

See
The old city containing many mosques and churches, is a little run down but enclosed in antique walls. The city walls are very old and certainly worth a walk around. Some of towers are restored by the municipality and are easy to reach from the center of the old city. One such is Kechi Burcu, which offers a nice view of Tigris river below the city, and a great look over the city walls—a teahouse offering traditional tea is nearby as well. However, be careful while walking on the walls and do not enter into all of the towers which looks fancy enough, as some of them are home to junkies.

The old city is like a village in the middle of the city with village mentality; goose running around, women having cay in front of their houses and kids (who'll beg for money) shouting to foreigners the few English words they know. However, walking around in the city center is unique and totally different from other Turkish cities. You'll see people as they live their everyday kurdish life. If you are lucky, you may even get invited for a tea by a friendly shopowner.

To avoid problems, dress modestly. There is an extensive development outside including a pleasant park. It's called Gazi Kösk and it contains many teahouses and traditional bed-like constructions, where you sink into cushions and drink tea while overlooking the Dicle river below.

* The oldest mosque in Anatolia, built in the 11th century by Malikh Shah,the Emir of the Seljuk Turks.
*Old caravanserai, now used as a place for cafes, bookstores, and souvenir shops.
* A Syrian Orthodox church founded in 3rd century. If you are lucky, the priest will sing for you in Aramaic.
* The largest Armenian church in the Middle East, this edifice was recently restored by municipality. The first inauguration for a long time was held in October 2011 and has since officially started to serve the local Armenian community. Update September 2019: A large area around the Armenian church was closed off with high barricades due to reconstruction of severe damages of the past "Syrian" war. Reopening is expected for 2022. In September 2019, entering the area from castle direction was possible but probably neither really safe nor secure (in particular not at night). In the area there were many destroyed or damaged Armenian residential houses of this former quarter.

Do
You can go for a walk on the old city wall. Get onto it at the northern gate and walk anticlockwise to Mardin Gate. Great views of the surrounding area and the city and it's free. Single tourists might be conspicuous, however, and should beware of pickpockets. 

Many tourists only visit the old part of Diyarbakir, but don't miss the totally new and modern New City. Around Ofis district you find a lot of nice bars and cafès filled with lots of students and young couples. Some Bars have livemusic, but better ask some locals on the street for that. Don't worry about security issues as this part of the city is filled with policemen.

A tourist office is located at Kıbrıs Caddesi (phone 0412 221 2173), helping out with city plans, guide books, and staff are eager to chat with little English. Opening times not necessarily match with what is written (Mo-Fr 9-13, Sat 9-13). If you stand in front of the closed door it's worth coming back after a while.

Buy

In the old city you will find many people manufacturing metal tools by hand - sickles, hammers, and other, mostly agricultural implements.

You can also find cheap (around 25 TL) traditional kurdish trousers, that older men wear everyday. Enjoy tea + bargaining sessions with some friendly Bazaar shopkeepers.

Diyarbakır is very famous with its desserts. Kadayıf, künefe are the two main types of desserts. They are acquired tastes, though, as they are very sweet and contain huge amounts of sugar. Saim Usta is perhaps the best place to have kadayıf in town, while for künefe, you should check out Levent Usta.

Drink
There are many teagardens in Ofis and along the Basalt city walls, where you can meet locals. People in Diyarbakir are very open towards foreigners and you'll have a hard time paying for your own tea.

Stay safe
Diyarbakır is rough. At first glance, it seems not a very welcoming city, but actually it is the contrary. It is not advisable at all to walk alone during the night time, especially in the old quarter in areas without street lighting. Taking some precautions during your visit is advisable and just using common sense. Don't hang around in dark areas, try not to look like the typical tourist, etc. Stay with the people, and you are fine. Many locals on the street are really helpful. Get their help before getting lost. It may happen that they show you all the way until you're at the place you asked about particularlt at night).

The lower end of the street toward the Mardin Kapı, the Mardin Gate, is pretty dark and can be dangerous at night. Do not become prey to pickpockets who seem to hang around there. 

The modern part of Diyarbakir is very much safer. Kayapinar, a part of the city center, is pretty modern, and is pretty safe compared to the old city areas. Places like 75 and Diclekent are the safest in the entire city, and has little to no safety issues. Still, you should take precautions just as you do in a western city of Turkey, as pickpocketing and many other dangerous things that exist in the rest of the country applies to this place too, even though the possiblity for it to happen is pretty small compared to the rest of the city.

Diyarbakir seems to have recovered from the old times and the police are trying their best to provide a high level of security. So don't be scared about the issues mentioned above, as the city itself is still a jewel among others in eastern Turkey, offering an amazing and unforgettable charm. Tourist crowds are still tending to go to Mardin (1h away), so enjoy having the city mostly for your own.
