Understand
Lagosa is a small village. It benefits from the MV Liemba and is a bigger village in the surrounding area. It is very remote and hard to get to. Roads are unpaved and to the south of the village center the "road" becomes too narrow for cars to pass.
If you want to go to you will need to get off the here. Also you will need to get back on the MV Liemba in Lagosa to get back to Kigoma after you visited Mahale. If you need to stay overnight, there is a very basic guest house (see below).
Only few people speak English. A basic knowledge of Swaheli (or somebody who can translate for you) is necessary to make arrangements. Be prepared to communicate with hands and feet only.
