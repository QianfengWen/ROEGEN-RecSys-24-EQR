Bilbao is the capital of Vizcaya in the , . 

Understand

The city is situated on the banks of the Nervión, a tidal river. The climate in Bilbao is milder than in most other parts of the peninsula, rarely falling below freezing in winter, or rising above 35ºC in summer. There is also more rain, which is a mixed blessing. The green hills of Bilbao are a welcome relief after an extended stay in the dry plains in the south, but planning a day at the beach is more risky. The population of Bilbao proper is just over 372,000, but within the metropolitan area there are over 1,000,000 inhabitants. Bilbao is divided into eight district areas: Deusto, Uribarri, Otxarkoaga/Txurdinaga, Begoña, Ibaiondo, Abando, Rekalde and Basurto/Zorroza.

In Google maps you can type in 'Estación de Autobuses de San Sebastián, San Sebastian, Espana' to see where it is.

The bus companies connect Bilbao with many cities in Spain more cheaply and frequently than the rail companies.

Bilbao is difficult to drive in. Hilly one-way streets, and frequent construction projects, make it a nightmare for drivers in parts of the city. Having an automobile map helps a lot; without it allow at least 30min extra to find the right exit from the city.

Museums

* Frank Gehry's spectacular twisting titanium-clad modern art museum is perhaps the most celebrated building of the 1990s. The graceful, sensuous curves, evocative of the ships that used to be ubiquitous along the docks of Bilbao, are covered in titanium squares, which resemble the scales of a fish and shimmer in the sunlight. In keeping with the maritime theme, appropriate for the setting, the skylights of the largest gallery (formerly known as the Fish gallery) are designed to look like the fins of fish. Many parts of the building are purely decorative, and don't serve any purpose. The permanent collection is not particularly impressive, but the museum always hosts at least one interesting temporary exhibit, frequently comprised of masterpieces from the other Guggenheim collections.

* The Museum of Fine Art's remarkable collection currently boasts more than six thousand works dating from the 12th century to the present day, and includes paintings, sculptures, drawings, engravings and decorative objects. 

* Established in 1921 to focus on the prehistory, archaeology, ethnography and history of Euskadi (Basque homeland). Not a particularly well laid out museum. It will be of passing interest to people who study Basque culture. 

*La Ría Maritime Museum, Muelle Ramón de la Sota, 1. Located in what used to be the Euskalduna shipyard, next to the current Euskalduna Performing Arts Center. The Museum covers an area of 27,000 square metres, 7,000 for indoor exhibitions and 20,000 for outdoor exhibitions, the three docks, the walkway surrounding them and the estuary.

The church was constructed on the ruins of a former alcazar, and is shown on Bilbao's shield.

Built in the 16th Century by Sancho Martinez de Arego, who was also responsible for the Iglesia San Anton. It is a basilica of three naves. During the first Carlista War, in 1835, the façade and the tower were destroyed. The present ones were designed Jose Maria Basterra and constructed between 1902 and 1907.

*Iglesia de San Nicolás, Esperanza, 1 (Arenal, Casco Viejo), 94 416 1424. The Iglesia de San Nicolás, finished in the 19th century, is dedicated to the patron saint of sailors. One of the best examples of Baroque architecture in Vizcaya.

Eat

Pintxos
The local custom is to call what are known in Spanish as tapas by the Basque name, Pintxos, probably much more elaborated than their Spanish cousins due to the Basque love of gastronomy.

Fri and Sat night are most popular time for eating pintxos--as it is for going to bars.

* Aritz. Calle Zugastinobia 4 48012 Bilbao. Was once one of the best Pintxos bars in Bilbao, quite out of the way (almost hidden really in a very small, one way street away from the main thoroughfares). Ask for it and you will be given directions. It is worth the walk since they have won the local Pintxo contests for ages. Closed as of Feb. 2008 and as the summer of 2008 reopened with what appears to be new management with less emphasis on its prize-winning pintxos. It's worth going to this street though because there are dozens other pintxos bars. 

* This restaurant claims that their Pintxos are a miniaturization of Basque cooking culture. The Pintxos are presented very nicely and in an appetizing way on the bar counter. Staff proficient in English, occasionally live Piano music. Can be crowded at times.

Stay Safe
With a rate of only 33.4 crimes per 1000 inhabitants, the Basque Country has one of the lowest crime rates in Europe.

Crime rates can, however, vary significantly between rural and urban areas, though urban areas are still not particularly dangerous. Avoid the San Francisco area. The San Francisco area is however a vibrant area with lots of cheap bars and cheap food run by very nice Bolivian families, as always common sense must prevail when walking around at night. However. Violent crime is extremely rare, but the usual precautions will keep you out of trouble.

It is advisable not to wear any Spanish symbols. Spain national football (soccer) tops, Spanish flags or Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid club paraphernalia are best avoided. Alhough no assaults on people wearing them have been recorded, some people might be upset about them. It is also best to avoid referring to the Basque Country as Spain.

Take into account that inhabitants of the Basque Country are divided between those who support independence or autonomy from Spain and consider themselves primarily or entirely Basque (the majority, at 51%) and others who consider themselves primarily or entirely Spanish (a 49% minority). Within these currents, there are further subdivisions of opinion ranging from supporters of the Terrorist Group ETA at one end to those who supported the fascist regime of General Franco at the other (though most people fall somewhere in between these extremes).

These political issues have dominated life in the Basque Country for generations and you will still find coverage of them in news media across the Basque Country every day. Also certain bars will have a distinctly Basque nationalist clientele (such bars will generally have posters and slogans on the walls) where pro-Spanish opinions will be unwelcome. If speaking to strangers, bear these divisions in mind and try not to cause offence.

Be careful with a guy who rides a bicycle and approaches people (mainly tourists) to offer stickers, bookmarks, poems, etc., then asks for money. He speaks English and it's enough to say "no" strongly: he will back off.
