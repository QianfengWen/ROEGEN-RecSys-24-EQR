Historic Landmarks

As legend has it, in the spring of 1909, Harry Preston, a member of the Jack Wilson camp slipped on a rock and uncovered a mound of gold. His discovery created the gold rush of the Porcupine Camp and brought in miners and their families from all around the world. Today, Timmins is a thriving community rich in cultural diversity and mining heritage. Discover the city’s legacy and learn more about the people who made it all possible.

*Downtown Timmins, At the corner of Spruce Street South and Third Avenue, you can see the former train station built in 1912. It is currently used as the ONR Terminal and leased commercial space. Turning left on Third Avenue brings you right into Timmins’ busiest street in the downtown core. On the right side is the city’s Walk of Fame. Prominent citizens have been commemorated here with plaques set in the sidewalk. Along Third Avenue, you will see many local shops, retail services, and restaurants reflecting our vibrant northern Ontario community. Look for the parkette (beside the C.I.B.C. Bank on the corner of Third Avenue and Pine Street) that houses a site commemorating Shania Twain; Timmins’ country singing sensation. Her hand prints are embedded in cement below a plaque in her honour. Across the street is Bucovetsky’s department store. Established in 1909, it is the oldest business in the city. Third Avenue itself was first laid out in 1911 and some of the buildings here date back to 1912.

*Saint Anthony of Padoua Cathedral, 274 Fifth Avenue, Timmins. This French baroque architectural gem was built in 1936-37. The first church (built in 1922) burnt January 29, 1936. The cross to the left was erected in 1934 in memory of Jacques Cartier’s 4th centenary.

*McIntyre Community Centre, 85 McIntyre Road, Schumacher. The facility was built in 1938 for the employees of the McIntyre Mine. It is a scale model of the Maple Leaf Gardens, complete with the famous red, green and blue seats and end balconies. The Center is still very active and features an arena, curling rink, ballroom, auditorium and a diner style coffee shop.

*McIntyre Headframe, Behind the Community Center, towering majestically over Pearl Lake is the McIntyre Mine #11 headframe. The 3rd largest producer of gold in Canada is closed today, but the city plans to redevelop the headframe and its immediate surroundings as a heritage monument to gold mining in the Porcupine Camp.

*Schumacher Park, McIntyre Road, Schumacher. Home to three monuments honouring the mining history of Schumacher. The iron statue overlooking the highway is a representation of Mr. Sandy McIntyre discovering gold, while the other one depicts a wealthy American investor named Frederick W. Schumacher, for whom the town takes its name. The headframe is a replica of the McIntyre Mine.

*St. Alphonsus Church, Father Costello Drive, Schumacher. The church is covered with many murals painted by local artist, Mr. Ed Spehar. Father Les Costello was rector of this church for over 23 years. This beloved priest, co-founder of the world famous Flying Fathers hockey team, was a prominent figure in our community known for his sense of humor and his generosity.

*International Flags, Father Costello Drive, Schumacher. At the end of the street, you will notice a collection of flags representing the community’s rich ethnic diversity and heritage. Please note that the flags are taken down for the winter.

*Whitney Cemetery/Deadman’s Point, Haileybury Crescent, Porcupine. Over 70 people lost their lives in the great Porcupine fire of July 11, 1911. Due to the close proximity of Porcupine Lake, many lives were saved. However, one unusual tragedy occurred when a mine manager by the name of Robert A. Weiss thought he could save his family by taking them down a mine shaft. Sadly, the fire used up all the oxygen in the shaft and the whole family perished. Most bodies of the fire victims were sent home, but 17 were buried here. A monument was erected in their honour by the Toronto Board of Trade.

*Gold Mine Road, This road is known to the locals as the “Backroad”. A number of mines were located on this road. Since 1960, most of them have been torn down. The first mine on your left is Porcupine Gold Mines - Goldcorp (formerly Dome Mine and Porcupine Joint Venture); the only gold mine which has been in operation since 1910. The story of the discovery of the Dome reports the accidental finding of a vein of gold by a prospector who slipped on some moss while climbing the side of a mound (or dome), exposing the vein of gold. Hence, the name “Dome Mine”. Further on to your right, is the Paymaster Headframe. The Paymaster Mine was closed in 1934.

Stay Safe
If you're driving in to the area, be warned that the roads can be snow-covered and icy in the winter and early spring. Your best bet is winter tires (chains aren't allowed), however taking a bag of sand or kitty litter in your trunk can help you if you're stuck and spinning your tires. Most locals are happy to help push if you get stuck. In case of a breakdown, make sure that you take along a standard road safety kit with flares, gloves, and a warm blanket.

Get out
Timmins can be a good place to make your way to if you're looking to explore non-road access towns in Northern Ontario. Airline carriers such as Air Creebec and Thunder Airlines can take you to regions that you can't drive to, such as and Attawapiskat.
