Adana is a city in .

Understand
Adana is a very old city, founded in 6000 B.C. In its early years, it was part of a region called Cilicia and was, by turn, homeland to the Pheonicians, Chaldeans, Assyrians, Hittites, Persians, Macedonians, Romans, Byzantines, Abbasies, Seljuks, and finally the Ottomans. Now in the centre of huge and on the banks of Seyhan River, Adana is the fifth largest city in Turkey with a population of over 1.3 million. It's not commonly known as a tourist destination, though, especially when compared with its southern and western neighbours. However, that being said, there are a number of sites of interest in the surrounding countryside.

Modern Adana consists of two quite separate sections: cramped old city centre and newer, mostly high-rise suburbs overlooking the Seyhan dam to north of the old centre, usually called Kuzey Adana or Yeni Adana (i.e. "North Adana" or "New Adana", respectively).

Climate
Adana features a typical Mediterranean climate. Winters are short and cool and the average January temperature is 9.6°C (49.3°F) with nighttime lows around 5°C (41°F). Sub-zero temperatures are recorded but cold waves rarely affect the city, due to its southerly position and shelter provided by the mountains in the north. The lowest recorded temperature is -8.1°C (17.4°F) and snow are extremely rare. Summers are hot, but with nothing uncommon regarding the city's latitude. Temperatures range from 35°C (95°F) to 23°C (73°F) and there are occasional heat waves. The highest recorded temperature is 45.6°C (114.1°F).

Get in
Flights arrive at the Adana Sakirpasa Airport (, ) located in the city outskirts. It's a fairly short cab ride to city center and is served frequently by dolmus.

Trains to Adana are seriously disrupted by engineering works, and are likely to remain so for some years. The best route from Istanbul or Ankara is to take the YHT fast train to , whence there is a replacement bus service to Karaman, then 4½ hours by daily train to Adana. The line between Konya and Karaman is closed for upgrading to YHT until 2018.

There was formerly an overnight sleeper between Ankara and Adana, but this is suspended at least until 2018 while Ankara station and tracks east of the city are upgraded. A daily train still runs between Adana and , but with no convenient connection to Ankara.

The lines to Aleppo and other parts of Syria, and to thence across Syria to Mosul in Iraq, are closed indefinitely.

As with the rest of the country, another common way of getting here is to use the buses. They arrive here frequently from Ankara, Istanbul, , and several other cities around Turkey. Journey time from Istanbul is around twelve hours, fares starting at 50 TL. Inter-city bus companies includes Varan Ulusoy and Metro Make sure you get off at the right station as most buses also stop at a station in the suburbs, about 4 km west of city centre. Getting off at the wrong station may be frustrating, but not an disaster since a local bus connects them. The bus station in city centre lies close to the Hilton hotel.

Driving to Adana is an option; from , the national capital, there is highway all the way (European road number: E90) but distances are long. The motorway O-21 will connect the two cities, but it doesn't reach any further north from for the time being. However, even if there is no motorway for about half of the route from Ankara, the current highway has seperated directions all along it, anyway. Once you have passed the pass of Cilician Gates (Gülek Boğazı) through the Taurus Mountains into the , take O-51 eastwards.
