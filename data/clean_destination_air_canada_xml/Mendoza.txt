Mendoza is a city in western , in the desert region. Mendoza is the center of the Argentinian wine industry, for which it is world renowned. It is also near the Aconcagua, the highest mountain outside of the . Mendoza is the capital of .

Understand
Although it is situated in an extremely dry desert region, Mendoza has an extensive artificial irrigation system, which allows for greenery throughout the city as well as the growth of grapes used to make its wines. Most streets have irrigation channels on either side, with bridges for pedestrian and vehicular traffic. These are periodically flooded with water diverted from the river. The approximately 80,000 trees and the wide avenues give the city a beautiful ambience, a change from much of the bare feel of many Argentine cities.

To the immediate west is the Pre-Cordillera of the Andes towering over the city, with peaks at some of the snow-covered (throughout the year) Andes peaks beyond.
 
Siesta (afternoon nap) is still taken in Mendoza, mostly because of the summer heat. Most businesses close between 12:30 and 13:00, many foodstores do not close until 14:00 The shops then re-open at about 17hs and stay open until 20:30. Supermarkets are usually open 9:00 to 22:00, also on Sundays. Banks are only open Monday through Friday from about 8:00 to 13:00. Casas de cambio (money exchanges) close at 20:00.
Climate
Summers are hot and dry in the city. January is particularly hot; temperatures of 40°C (104°F) are not uncommon. However, the lack of humidity (and during summer, the many trees) makes both the heat and cool more bearable than, say, humid Buenos Aires. The nearby mountains are cool, though, even in the summer.

Winters are moderately cold in the city from late June to late August, and very cold in the mountains. Many ski centers are located near Mendoza (see below "DO").

Get in
By plane
* IATA code MDZ 

By bus 
The large bus terminal is about two kilometers from the city center. Taxis and remis (private taxis) are readily available (US$ 3-4 to the center), or it is a 15 minute walk (not recommended at night, the area between it and the center borders on the red light district).

There are daily bus connections to all major destinations including and , a beautiful 7-hour bus ride crossing the . Santiago de Chile is not always reachable by bus as the Andes pass often closes after heavy snowfall in the winter months, normally around late May to early September (but may be stretching until mid October). The pass may then be closed for a couple of days up to a week. Travelers on a strict timetable (upcoming flight, expiring visas, etc.) should consider this and not go on the last possible day. The first day after reopening of the pass large queues can be expected at the border checkpoints, adding several hours to the journey time. The joint immigration/customs control for both Chile-out-stamps/Argentina-in-stamps (convenient) for entry into Argentina is located at Los Horcones near Puente del Inca, and the one for entry-into-Chile/exit-from-Argentina stamps is at Las Libertadores, also known as Paso Cristo Redentor in Chile, 5&nbsp;km past the tunnel (Check the following websites for pass conditions (Spanish).

Mendoza has a small international airport, El Plumerillo (airport code MDZ), with flights to Buenos Aires (LAN and Aeroineas Arg.) and Santiago de Chile (LAN), but tickets are very expensive as compared to bus fares (the fares to Chile are more reasonable, as you do not have to pay the foreigner premium for domestic flights). Flights to Salta, Iguazú and Bariloche have started in the 2010, to and from, on Tuesdays , Thursdays and Saturdays, with Aerolineas Argentinas. From the airport, you can take a remis (a type of taxi) for fixed posted prices (as of late 2014, it was 90 pesos to the centre). There is also a city bus (collectivo) that takes you downtown, but it comes only every 40 minutes and takes an hour to make it's way downtown (exact coins only).

Mendoza is a travel hub of sorts for Argentina. If coming from Santiago, you will now have to pay the Argentine reciprocity fees paid by USA and Australia passport holders (if you book your bags through at Santiago, you will not have to pay the similar fees for Chile payable only for entry at the Santiago airport immigration, not for land entry into Chile. As of February 2014, Chile was added to the US Visa Waiver Program and no longer charges a reciprocity fee for entry at any port.).

By car
The best choice to rent a car 

Get around
Central Mendoza is relatively compact and walkable - for example it is a 20-30 minute walk from Plaza Independencia to Parque San Martín, however to get to the bodegas (vineyards) to the south walking isn't recommended as it they are at least 10km away.

A ticket bought in bus or trolley is valid in the other means of communal transportation. 

Buses are cheap and plentiful, but a little confusing at first. Buses have two numbers, a group (Grupo) number, which is the big number at the top of the front of every bus, and a route number, which is two or three digits (i.e. 33 or 114-115) and is on a small sign behind the windscreen. Buses on the same line (eg Grupo 3) all go to roughly the same place (eg Godoy Cruz) but the route varies by route number - so be careful not to get on the wrong route! Now, you cannot pay cash for bus journeys (2015 MAR), and it is necessary to purchase a Red Bus card (a prepaid proximity card) that you touch-in when boarding a bus. You can buy a Red Bus card from some kioskos near a bus stop and charge them up at the same place. 

There are 5 trolleys, which are part of the same transport system and have the same price, use the same coin machines and RedBus card. A popular run is the Parque circuit, which takes you to the gates of the large (3.2 sq.km) and green Parque San Martin gates every 10 minutes or so, which you can catch on 9 de Julio , Colon or Aristides Villanueva Streets downtown. At the gates, you could also return by catching the circuit at the same stop.

There is also a light train, Metrotranvia, running from the old Mendoza railway station at the corner of Belgrano and Juan B. Justo/Av. Las Heras to the suburb General Gutiérrez, some 15 km southeast of city center. It too uses the general ticket system, and you also you must have a Red Bus card. Information and timetable here: Horarios Metrotranvia.

Taxis are plentiful, metered and fairly cheap, costing about the same as in Buenos Aires. 

You can hire bicycles in town - most hostels can put you in touch with a bicycle hire outfit - prices are negotiable (i.e. they will charge you as much as they think you are willing to pay). You will need some form of ID to leave as deposit. Ask to see and test the bike before handing over your money - many are old clunkers.

See
*A historic house museum is an 1890 mansion once home to artist Fernando Fader in nearby Mayor Drummond, 14 km south of Mendoza. The mansion is home to many of the artist's paintings.
*A modern city park, contrasting with the tradition of the better-known Parque San Martin. Not a Mendoza must see, but the park has some nice water fountains and a grassy hill - often amateur Mendocinans set up their easels here and paint away.
*It plays role in the developing and exhibiting the Modern Art.
*This huge park is nice for walking or biking around. It was designed in the late 1800s and remains charming until now with the rose garden and the sculptures dotted around the park and the nearby Regata Lake. There is also a zoo at the north-west corner of the park with animals in small cages. Behind the zoo begins a path up to Cerro de la Gloria, where there is a large statue and nice view over the city and of the mountains - particularly pleasant at sunset.
*Possibly the most beautiful square in the city, this square is an artistic expression of the special relationship that this city (and all others in Hispanic America) has with Spain. It is decorated in a splendid way with typical Andalusian and Spanish motifs all around the place. The central wall depicts some images and texts of the Spanish colonization and it is crowned by a gorgeous statue.
*The central main square of the city is the best starting point to explore downtown Mendoza. It boasts green area with fountain, some nice buildings around, restaurants and even some street shows. The Plaza can also be visited at night, where you can see some nicely illuminated buildings and a beautiful big coat of arms of the city that is made of lights.
*Museum is located in the vineyard-rich Mendoza area and displays a detailed history of wine-making in Argentina. It is housed in a historic chalet showcases over 4500 pieces used in early wine production.

Do

Adventure and outdoor activities
Many companies organize trekking, expeditions, horseback riding and whitewater rafting in the desert and the mountains. Also almost all accommodation facilities organize the different activities only ask them about it. Mountain cabins (bungalows) in areas with spectacular scenery are easily rentable in the city. Remember that tango has an important place in the Argentinian culture, but so does soccer, the wine industry, the gaucho lifestyle and the cuisine.
* America's highest peak Aconcagua (highest in the world outside the Himalayas) provides trekking and climbing possibilities. All travel agencies and backpacker hostels can organize trips - although a considerably cheaper and more flexible option is to take a Buttini bus to the park from Mendoza's bus station. The bus will drop you off at the entrance to buy the entry ticket. To catch the bus back, you'll have to walk back to the Puenta de Inca. You will walk the short interpretive trail and lookout (which will take 45 min), rather than paying the hefty hiking fees past that you need to pay in town at the Provincial Park office in Parque San Martin (depending on how far and how many days you trek). If you want to see the top of Aconcagua, check the weather for the area before going, or you will waste your time and money.
* Cerro Arco is located near the town of El Challao, from where many of the most important treks can be started. A pleasant half-day hike easily done independently from Mendoza, offering the great views of both the Andean foothills behind and the vast expanse of Mendoza's plains to the front. Cerro Acro is the looming mountain to Mendoza's north west, topped with various antenna. It is also used as the base for paragliding. Take bus 114/115 (linea 3) on Sarmiento, just west of the Plaza Independencia, (or Parque San Martin on Av Del Libertador) to El Challao Mirador, at the end of the line 8km to the northwest. There is a clear turnaround at the end of the bus line where you get off. From there walk across from the white nightclub (which is slightly downhill from the road) following the dyke 100 metres, then take an unpaved track further west until you reach a small restaurant / mountaineering museum/ clubhouse - then follow the track to the north (going through the gate). This is a popular hike for Mendocinos at the weekend, but during the week it may be deserted. You can treat yourself to a hearty asado at the restaurant - although beware that restaurant has two menus, one more expensive than the other! From the Mirador the hike is about a 3.5 hour round trip. Get out of the area well before dark. In the summer, go early to avoid the worst of the heat, and in the winter bring a jacket, as it can be cool and windy at the top. Afterwards you could visit the aircraft hanger sized church in Challao, a local version of Lourdes.
* The best way to reach the other side of the Andes and Santiago is to take a scenic 7 hour bus ride through the beautiful Andes Mountains. On the way you will see nice countryside before the reach of clouds in the stunning Andes Mountains, which actually stretch from Mendoza to Santiago. On the border awaits passport and luggage control post.
* There is a nice golf field at the San Martin park, where residences Golf Club Andino.
* This activity takes no longer than one day, in the mountain ranges of the pre-mountain range near our city, without having to go too far, there are places with a unique beauty. Usually national park has an intricate network of lesser-known day hikes. Torres del Paine's W Trek is world famous, but many people don't know that most of this route can be cut into three one-day hikes.
* Every hotel, hostel and travel agent can organize horse riding trips close to the city - but these guys have one of the better reputations - can do day and overnight rides, look after their animals and speak good English. A late afternoon ride, with a return at sunset will enable you to avoid the heat of the day and night-riding is very atmospheric. If you phone them direct you will get a lower price compared to organizing through a hostel.
* It is an exclusive spa located at Park Hyatt Mendoza. Spa was created to promote well-being through its luxurious pampering and relaxation services. 
* The Kite School in Potrerillos, 50 km from Medoza, which has 3 levels of instruction course.
* The official sightseeing tour bus of Mendoza City, it was originally released around mid 2013. It's really good, if you want to take a quick look around the city. The full tour it's about 2 hours. Bus fees, route and times are on its web.
* Enjoy this sort of activity on the rugged landscape, what makes it one of the best mountain biking destinations. The mountains around are breathtaking and there is so much to see. 
* It can be done in Mendoza every day of year, depending on the winds of course. Tours include a tandem flight of about 15 minutes with an experienced pilot. There are two companies going off Cerro Arco, both easily googleable: "zonadevuelo" (aka Fly Excursion) and "flyadventure"(aka mendoaventuras).
* This sport is popular in the winter, but the season is short. Closest are Penitientes (bigger) and Los Puquios (beginner) on the highway almost to the Chile border. You could either take the Espreso Uspallata milkruns, or by bus tickets or packages from the many agencies on Las Heras Street, between Mitre and Peru streets, where there are also lots of ski equipment and clothes rental shops.
* Cacheuta, located about an hour outside of Mendoza, has a very large network of heated outdoor pools called the "Parque del Agua". For easy transportation, enquire regarding Cacheuta at the Bus Terminal, Buttini bus counter at the immediate south side of the terminal near platform 55. Buses depart from Mendoza about 9am and return in the evening. The last bus departing Cacheuta at 18:50 - but be aware that there are no buses back to Mendoza between approximately 3pm and the last bus. It is recommended that you purchase both directions before departing. If you're in for the full day adventure, consider bringing some food to cook on their plentiful and free grills. An upscale alternative is to go for the day to the Termas Hotel, about a km before", with swanky pools, masseuses, jacuzzi and an incredible buffet lunch, but well worth the value - if you go, you would better book at the hotel a few days before for the package (do not bother staying at the hotel, the overpriced rooms are very cramped.
* Mendoza city has wonderful theaters for your choice of different repertoire.
* Mendoza area has many trekking routes. There could be routing by circuits or one way trekking. The best places to trek are: in Villa Gral Belgrano, Patagonia, Torres del Paine, Cerro Arco or trekking through Cerro Llao llao. Just remember to study them well before going. Ask the locals about a guide hiring.
* Potrerillos Dam is one of the best places in the world to do these activities. It is the venue for international championships.

Wine tours and tasting
* The nearby vineyards will let you taste wine, if you show genuine interest. It's possible to do a tour by bike, but there are also fully organized tours from Mendoza. The most popular destination for biking and wine tasting is Maipu, a short bus (numbers 171, 172, 173 or you can catch the Metrotranvia Train getting off at Gutiérrez (last stop); don't take the white new bus-van Maipu Special service, that cost one extra peso and do not stop in the wineries area) or cab ride out of Mendoza. Many outfits rent bikes and provide a map of the standard route, most of them are in Urquiza street. Wine & Ride is situated close to the Gutiérrez Train Stop & Bodega Lopez Do yourself a favor and choose your bike company carefully. For example, Mr. Hugo (ask the driver for the bus stop; it is on your left side) has well maintained bikes, Maipu Bikes Rental (next stop after Mr. Hugo, on the left side) offers detailed information about wineries, including prices and discounts. There are several excellent wineries on the typical route, including Bodega Lopez (free tour & tasting), Cecchin family winery Bodega La Rural, Tempus Alba Viña El Cérno and Carinae Other worthwhile stops on the route are wine shops, such as 'Vinoteca la Botella' where you can taste a range of local wines, olive oil, and even juices for a very reasonable price. As an alternative, Bacchus Wines runs bike tours out of Chacras and renting bikes provide a map and call ahead to several vineyards. Please be careful with your belongings on the bike wine tours, as there have been cases of bags being snatched out of the baskets on bikes recently. Budget from 150 to 300 pesos per person for "tastings", based on visiting between 4 to 6 wineries.
* Malbec symphony is an up and coming wine-tour specialized travel agency in Mendoza, Argentina. Our wine tours are directed by sommelier, Julian Dlouhy and his knowledgeable staff. Here at Malbec Symphony, we can organize wine tours to fit all your travel needs.

* Get to know how this process is managed in respect, when the olives are picked too early or at the ripped state. The appearance of the olives often vary from green to black, what indicates of the level of the ripeness. The olive harvest peaks are in April and May. Take this sort of activity to your experience. Argentina is not only an outstanding producer of fine wines, but also fragrant olive oil.
* The most popular high-end wine tours are Ampora Wine Tours Uncorking Argentina and Trout & Wine which take small groups to better wineries, include better tastings and a multi-course wine pairing lunch. Ampora, who primarily does wine tours, also offers tastings of Mendoza's highest quality wines in a laid back atmosphere in their own wine space, a beautifully restored historic town house.

The El Cristo tourism office is open 7 days per week.
* Wine-tasting events are common; check the culture section of local newspapers or ask around. A good period to visit is during harvesting in March and April. Visiting wineries often requires reservations booked in advance, (Many are closed during weekends). Some major wineries (Norton, Rutini etc.) have regular walk tours. Wine tasting can be done at any of the region’s winery(bodega), wine bars and restaurants in the city itself.

Festivals
Festivals They occur often and are usually free. Each has a different theme, and they usually have a stage with singing and dancing and booths that sell food around a plaza. The harvest festival at the end of February is a major event.
* Festival of the Sun invites an encounter with the identity and uniqueness of the local citizens. The Feast pays tribute to the Sun, which is associated with this wonderful land. The feast symbolizes the end and beginning of the annual cycle with the arrangements starting from the 21 June.
* It happens every year at the start of March. There take place lots of events relating to wine and concerts.

 Learn 
As with many cities in Argentina, there is a variety of Spanish courses and private lessons are available. There are three established language schools in Mendoza: 
Ecela Spanish, located just two blocks from Parque San Martin. Ecela offers private and group classes, and this school also organizes activities within the city as well as excursions during the weekend. Students get the chance to live in a host family as well as immersing in the the Argentinian culture. 

Intercultural is the biggest, has a range of afternoon activities, and is slightly more expensive, Green Fields Language Center (aka COINED) is smaller and feels even less well-organized, but many of the teachers work at both schools.

Another great option for individual or very small tailor-made quality group lessons with a highly trained instructor: Spanish in Mendoza, Argentina (SIMA) This is a better option for those seriously interested in learning or improving their Spanish, although the classes are very enjoyable.

Another interesting way to learn Spanish is by sharing accommodation. For people planing to stay for a couple of months, renting a room in a shared place could be the best option. Prices are reasonable low compared to hostels and hotels.

Buy
* The wine is excellent and can be extremely inexpensive, although in terms of quality you most often get what you pay for. There are several wine boutiques which offer wine tasting. In general, you can buy the same bottles of wine at local supermarkets at lower prices.
* Olive Oil. Argentina has been producing good quality Olive Oil for generations.
* There are several mountaineering and trekking equipment shops offering a wide variety of outdoor equipment. A couple of shops are on Av Juan B Justo near Av Belgrano.
* Leather goods are also readily available and inexpensive. There are many shops on Las Heras Av.

Eat
Mendoza Restaurants have many good buffets that serve reasonably priced lunches and dinners. Most offer 5-10 meat dishes freshly cooked on a giant grill and a variety of side dishes and desserts. The quality of the food can be quite good and it's an excellent way to try a selection of Argentine food. Good restaurants abound, but be warned that many close between 2pm and 8pm. For a round-up of Mendoza's more expensive eateries ask for the Guía Mendoza Gourmet from the tourist office. The main restaurant strip is on Aristides Villanueva, which runs east-west from Ave Belgrano (where the defunct railway tracks are) to Parque San Martin. It is difficult to have a bad meal here, although as a general rule be wary of special offers from places near the hostels - they may be cheap, but this shows in the quality. There are also some excellent (and pricey) restaurants on Ave Sarmiento running west from Plaza Independencia. A cluster of cheaper restaurants are on Ave Juan B Justo 

Try world-famous Argentinian beef asado (roasted) from a parrilla (grill) restaurant, with a bottle of Mendoza's excellent wine. Beware that they tend to put too much salt in the meat so you cannot really appreciate the taste. Try asking for unsalted steak and then add the desired amount of salt at the table.
Mendoza's most famous wine varieties are the Malbecs from Maipú and Luján de Cuyo. Other good options are Cabernet Sauvignons and Merlots. Restaurants offer small wine bottles (375 ml).

Even by Argentinian standards, Mendocinans eat late. On weekdays kitchens open around 9PM, but few diners arrive before 10PM. On Fridays and Saturdays things don't get going until 11PM.

* Grill Restaurant, pleasant & pricely with suggestion of patio. Asado, steak, chicken and more steak. For an interesting dining experience have a meal whilst a football game at Club Independiente next door is underway.
* Open for Lunch and Dinner, this is a classic, family-owned restaurant that serves authentic, quality Argentine food. Great home made pasta. Daily specials. Friendly to English speakers. If you're in the city center and want a dependable meal, you can't go wrong here.

Sleep
Mendoza is a very liveable city, and many choose to stay for a few weeks to take language courses and the like, there are a number of short-term apartment rental companies, concentrated in microcentro (downtown). You'll find several in 'Galería Independencia' in Lavalle street. An internet search will bring up several scores options, if you know that an apartment is called 'departamento'. Be wary of paying deposits before you arrive as the apartment may not live up to your expectations. Traffic noise can be a particular problem.

The most pleasant part of town is between Avenida Belgrano and Parque San Martin - La quinta Sección, the richest part of town, with quiet streets and well kept neighborhoods, and the bars and restaurants of Arístides Villanueva within walking distance. East of the centre is the more low rent area, and contains the cheaper hostels. Be warned, the below information appears to be rather out of date and is in need of updating.

Stay safe
Beware of muggers, especially in the bus terminal and the city blocks surrounding it.

As in many countries, be careful of the vehicles. There is no right-of-way-for-pedestrian at crossings and many drivers will not respect stop-signs (only "transit police" are allowed to enforce these laws, not the mostly-visible standard police officers). Intersections are potential death traps, this cannot be emphasized too much, the vehicles are often driven erratically, fast, & without attention, wandering and without signalling. Look everywhere, and make no assumptions. Especially be careful when there is a bus or taxi approaching from any direction. Many pedestrians choose to jaywalk (a crime not enforced enough here yet) in the middle of the block to avoid endangering their lives and limbs at intersections!

The transit police, who are actually a separate police force in Mendoza City, Godoy Cruz, Las Heras, Maipu, and Lujan de Cuyo, have consistently enforced and increased fines since 2009, for lack of seat belt usage, headlights not on at all times, and talking on the cell phone while driving. These crimes have diminished greatly. Speeding is still rarely enforced on public roads due primarily to lack of local acceptance of radar gun results but renewed efforts are underway in 2013.
* Mendoza Holidays is a boutique operation specializing in upscale private tours, gourmet itineraries and specialty programs throughout Mendoza, Chile and other areas in Argentina such as Buenos Aires, Salta, Iguazu Falls, Patagonia and more. Mendoza Holidays is the premier provider of luxury wine tours in Argentina.
* Modern tourist information center corresponds the tourist expectations, who require a more dynamic, accessible, available care and information 24 hours a day. There is developed an application downloadable from any smartphone or tablet that allows reading from a pocket map or an augmented reality billboard, data on services and attractions throughout the province.

Get out
Buy your bus tickets out at the terminal or in the street Montevideo, where some larger bus companies have their offices, at least a few days before you leave, especially during the December to March high season, July mid-winter break, and holidays, when bus usage is especially high.
