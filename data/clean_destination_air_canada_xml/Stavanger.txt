Get around
By bus
Public transportation in Stavanger is mainly by bus and works smoothly. A single ticket will cost kr 40-110 depending on how many zones you travel, although it can be used again within your last zone within a certain time limit. Tickets bought on the bus cost kr 20 more, therefore it is cheaper to purchase tickets through the app or at ticket machines. A better option might be to buy a day-pass for kr 60, which can be used within 24 hours from activation. In addition, you can buy the 3-day pass which costs kr 150. One and two-week passes are also available. Buses in the city center can be caught at the main bus terminal and at stops around the city lake, Breiavannet. The airport shuttle bus is very expensive (kr 120 one-way, kr 180 return) and if you are heading to a location outside the centre it may be more worthwhile to take a taxi. However, on workdays bus no. 42 which travels half-hourly between the airport and the city center, is a much cheaper option than the airport shuttle bus (kr 40 one-way) if having only ONE piece of luggage. Buses are modern and most have areas for wheelchairs and baby carriages.

By train

By taxi
Stavanger has different taxi companies, all charging high rates. A typical daytime rate is 35 kr flagfall, 7 kr/started 500 meter and 8 kr/started minute, minimum 110 kr total payable. Expect a surcharge of about 25 % in evening/night/Saturday and a surcharge of about 45 % for Sunday. You can use credit cards to pay through the taxi meters.
During weekends there can be long lines for taxis in downtown area. Try walking out of the city centre and hailing a vacant cab on its way back to downtown.

By bicycle
Along with any public transportation ticket, you get access to the region's array of electric shared bicycles, through the app Kolumbus Billett. While your ticket is valid you can borrow a bike from any station for free for one hour. To extend this time, you can just park the bike at a charging station and rent the same bicycle again. Cycle infrastructure is good, although you a lot of the time share the cycle path with pedestrians.

See

*The Stavanger Oil Museum is a very interesting building with fascinating information on Norway's oil industry. Displays of submersibles, drilling equipment, a mock oil platform, and audio-visual presentations make for a good few hours. The museum caters for all ages and is open 10:00-16:00 (Sundays and June-August 10:00-18:00). 
*The Canning Museum may not seem like the most interesting place to visit but it is a surprisingly good little museum with a lot of hands-on exhibits. 
*Gamle Stavanger (Old Stavanger) is a well preserved slice of Norwegian history. Old winding streets and wooden houses are representative of accommodation from Stavangers days as a the canning capital of Norway. Most houses in Old Stavanger are privately owned and well kept.
*A good place for a photo opportunity are the Three Swords (Sverd i fjell, literally Sword in Mountain), a monument outside the centre of Stavanger, beside the Hafrsfjord. The swords themselves are massive and in the background is the fjord. The monument commemorates the battle of Hafrsfjord in the late 800's where Harald Hårfagre beat his eastern opposition and became the first King of Norway.
*Sculptures - In 2000 the mobile installation Another Place by British sculptor Anthony Gormley was placed on and off Sola beach. A few years later a new and permanent installation Broken Column by the same artist, was placed at various locations surrounding the centre of Stavanger.
*The Rogaland Kunstmuseum (art museum) is on Mosvatnet Lake, only 2 km from the city center. The museum has a permanent exhibition of Norwegian art, and a rotating exhibition that is sometimes quite spectacular. Be sure to see the Lars Hertervig paintings; you'll see the landscape of the islands just north of Stavanger reflected in his work.
*Stavanger Cathedral (romanesque style from about 1125, with later gothic additions) is the best preserved medieval cathedral in Norway and well worth a visit.

Do
The seasons control what to do in Stavanger. Stavanger has a maritime climate, with cool summers and mild winters. Summers features periods of warm and nice weather, although they sometimes can be rainy. Winters usually mean more rain than snow in Stavanger, although going into the mountains will ensure snow.
*Hiking and climbing around Stavanger is the best way to see the fantastic landscape. Many of the trails have been marked out by the Turistforetning with rocks bearing a red "T". Turistforening hyttes (cabins) provide simple accommodation in the mountains. Also mountain bikes can be hired and taken on the trails. The Pulpit Rock is accessible throughout the year for day trips, while the road to Kjerag is closed during winter.
*Solastranden (Sola Beach) is a long sandy beach by the airport. It is very popular in the summer and allows for some small waves for surfing. Along the beach, in the dunes, are the remains of defences from the 1940-45 occupation. Other less populated beaches are all along the coastline although they are sometimes hard to find. 
*Ice skating on Stokkavannet - In the depths of winter the government tests the ice on its lakes. Once the official word is given many Norwegians will head for the largest lake, Stokkavannet. The lake itself is located near to Madla about 20 minutes bus ride outside of Stavanger. Should the ice not be safe, and you have a compulsion to skate, another option is the newly built full size indoor long track speed skating arena Sørmarka Arena. There are also several ice hockey rinks at Tjensvoll, ten minutes by bus from the city centre.

Buy 
Pewter serving utensils at several shops in town that will also sell other tourist things. They are pretty to look at, coming in several different designs and practical to use. The cheese slicer (ostehovel) is most traditional and the fish server (fiskespade) is something rarely seen outside of Norway.

Eat
Stavanger is considered a great place for foodies, with a range of good restaurants, two of which have a Michelin star, and an annual food fair that fills up the harbour area for a week-end each summer. Eating out is generally not cheap, like everywhere in Norway. If you're on a budget you should go for the smaller ethnic restaurants (chinese, thai). Several excellent places exist for the traveller on an expense account - or if you want to spoil yourself or a loved one: Try Tango, NB Sørensens (upstairs restaurant) or Re-Naa. Re-Naa received a Michelin star in 2016, Sabi Omakase got its star in 2017.

*The first restaurant in a chain that has probably the best sushi in Stavanger. Take-away and restaurant. Next-door Sabi Omakase is a tiny, Michelin-starred eat-in sushi restaurant. Expect to book months in advance.
*Starting with a boat trip out to an island outside of Stavanger, you are taken to a beautiful garden with a guide. After a tour with the guide, you will be served a fixed menu. Different menus for lunch and dinner. About 1000 NOK pr person, but a lot of value for the money.

Drink

The eastern rim of the bay gets the afternoon sun, and is the prime setting for an outdoor beer -weather allowing.
*Folken is by far the cheaper place to drink if you bring your Student Card. The music varies in both genre and loudness. Enjoy the summer in Folkens backyard!
*Definitely the most charming little café in all of Stavanger. Really nice atmosphere and interiors. The eccentrics' favorite. 
* On the western side you will find Checkpoint Charlie, a legendary hangout for rockers and students. It is also home to CCAP, a record label that hold Thomas Dybdahl and Popface in their expanding stable. Though its clientel has gradually gotten younger over the years (now around 18-22), it retains much of its old feel. 2 beers for the price of 1 on Thursdays (Lars Hertervigsgt. 5 4005 Stavanger, tel: 51532245
* Another bar well worth the visit is Cementen. Situated on the third floor of a concrete building alongside the bay, it has a great view of inner city Stavanger. It is easy to find, just look for the cement mixer hanging from the outside wall seven meters above its entrance. The recently added dance floor has resulted in increased popularity. (Nedre Strandgt.25, 4005 Stavanger)
* For the see and be seen crowd, Taket is the place to go (Nedre Strandgt. 15, 4005 Stavanger Tel: 51 84 37 01). 
* With Hall Toll the Stavanger night scene has finally gotten a taste of cosmopolitan jet set, complete with drunken bimbos, obnoxious bouncers with headsets and a separate VIP line at the entrance.
* Clubbers are advised to seek out Sting , located next to Valbergstårnet. It is a bit cramped, but they keep great DJs and the atmosphere is inviting. The first floor is cafe style, and basement is a night-club. The rooms to the right when you enter the cafè is traditionally for gay people. If you get tired from dancing there is a lounge area, Indian style, with lots of pillows to lie down on.(Valberget 3, 4006 Stavanger, Tel: 51 89 32 84, c-sting@online.no
* Munken (The Munk) is a traditional bar that serves beer, wine and spirits. Crowd varies a great deal in age (22-72), often many english speakers. Usually not very loud music. Free entrance. Prostebakken -in the Alley by the Dressmann haberdashery.
*Nåløyet is the closest thing to an everyday pub with some of the best bartenders in town. The bar is open all days, and get packed on Fridays and Saturdays.
* Perhaps the cheapest Happy Hour in town! Tiny English style pub.
*Rated as one of the worlds 50th best beer bars in the world, they have a lot of different varieties on tap, and countless bottles as well. Be sure to check out their menu, or "The Beer Bible" as the locals call it. Around 100 kr for a glass of beer.

Stay safe
Stavanger is generally considered a very safe city. The local police force are efficient, usually speak good english and have a strong presence in the downtown area at weekends. Call 112 in an emergency.

During weekends, the small downtown area tends to fill up with intoxicated people. Be careful when wandering around this area late at night, as a some people may have had a few too many to drink. 

Be careful taking a taxi alone if you are a girl, as there have been reports of a rise in numbers of violent rapes related to cab drivers. Always stay in groups when walking or taking a taxi home from the city center on weekends. Night busses run after midnight on fridays and saturdays, but have higher fares than during the day.

The number of streetwalking prostitutes have increased dramatically in recent years. They can be found everywhere in the city centre at night, giving the city the nickname "Norways prostitution capital". The prostitutes both as individuals and in groups, mostly target young and intoxicated men going home after a night on the town. They can behave quite aggressively towards any male walking by, often harassing passers- by. This can make the walk through the city centre at night an uncomfortable experience. If you are not intending to use their services, avoid eye contact and don't stop when adressed. Should a group of women start following you and shouting offers and abuse, just keep walking. Buying sex is illegal in Norway, and if caught you'll risk either heavy fines or up to one year in prison.

Get out
*Go south, to rural areas in . Take a fast-boat to some of the islands like . Go to the family theme park Kongeparken close to .

*Preikestolen (The Pulpit Rock) is a massive 600 metres vertical cliff that sits on the edge of the Lysefjord. Its top is a natural lookout of several hundred square metres, almost perfectly flat, and the rock is the region's main tourist attraction, and one of the nation's landmarks. To get to the top, follow the marked path for 2 - 2,5 hours from the Preikestolhytta, where food and accommodation is available. Be aware that this is a very popular attraction, and that even if you're quite fit your speed will be hindered by the crowded trail. Ferries typically (but not always!) correspond with buses here; total traveling time one way (less the climb) from Stavanger harbour is 1 hour 10 minutes. Ferry from Stavanger to Tau NOK 46 (each way), then bus NOK 160 (round trip) via Tide Reiser or NOK 140 (round trip) via Boreal Transport Be aware that these are two separate bus companies, and that if you buy a return ticket you will need to travel back to Tau via the same company. It will cost a bit more, but one should consider buying single tickets each way so you can travel back via the next bus back once you finish instead of having to wait for the other company's bus. If you opt to go by your own car, there is a NOK 100 parking fee.

* The Kjerag is almost double the altitude of Preikestolen but the access is more difficult. It is further into the Lysefjord. There you can find the Kjeragbolten. There is a bus that can take you there runs from Stavanger and Sandnes by Tide Reiser It operates from mid June to the beginning of September. It is not possible to see both Kjerag and Preikestolen in one day.

If the climb sounds too rough, you can take a fjordcruise leaving the harbour most days at noon and returning 3,5 hours later. NOK 450.
