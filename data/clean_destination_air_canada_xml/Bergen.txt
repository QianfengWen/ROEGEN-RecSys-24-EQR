Bergen is the second largest city in and the most popular gateway to the fjords of . The city is renowned for its beautiful nature and offers excellent hiking opportunities in its immediate surroundings. Having fostered many of Norway's greatest bands and artists, the city is also famous for its cultural life and underground/indie music scene.

Understand

History

Founded around 1070 AD, Bergen quickly evolved into one of the most important cities in Norway. It was the country's administrative capital from the early 1200s until 1299, and the largest city in Scandinavia. Bergen was one of the most important bureau cities of the Hanseatic League, interconnecting continental Europe with the northern and coastal parts of Norway, thus becoming a central spot for the vending of stockfish and the commercial hot spot in Norway. It was the largest city in Norway until the 1830's and has a long maritime history in shipping and finance.

The city still has relics of its Hanseatic heyday, most notably the old harbor of Bryggen, a . Bergen has been ravaged by several fires; the most recent major fire took place in 1916, a fire which destroyed most of the buildings in what is today the central parts of the city center, centered around the large square Torgallmenningen.

Geography

Bergen is located far west in Norway, sheltered from the North Sea only by a number of islands. It is situated along latitude 60 degrees north (as are , , , and ). The city is the most hilly and mountainous in Norway. The city center is surrounded by a group of mountains and peaks known as the Seven Mountains, a defining characteristic which has given the city its name (berg is an old Norse word for mountain). The geographic conditions of the city are very visible; limited space to build on made it necessary in the 19th century that new city blocks be built on the steep slopes of mount Fløyen

Except for the dense city center, which made up the entire city before 1916, Bergen is the least dense of the four largest cities in Norway. Most of the settlement inside the very wide city borders is concentrated in the western part of the municipality. The rest of the municipality is made up of mountains, as well as some farmland and smaller settlements.

Climate

Due to the city's location relatively far north, close to the northern sea and surrounded by mountains, special weather conditions occur, resulting in approximately 240 days with precipitation a year and a mean temperature of 7.6 °C (45.7 °F). In January 2007, a record of 85 rainy days in a row was set. Still, local people claim there is no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothing.

For the rest of us, the trick is obviously to choose the time of visit with caution. If you're lucky enough to catch the city on a sunny day, you will find an incredible atmosphere as citizens really know how to appreciate nice weather. City planners have probably had this in mind the latest years, resulting in open spaces, parks, flowers and lawns scattered all over downtown.

July has the highest mean temperature, 14.3 °C (57.7 °F), with August, 14.1 °C (57.4 °F) following close behind. May is usually the month with the least precipitation. Considering the number of local events this month, May is probably the best time to visit Bergen, with the summer months of June, July and August as an almost as good second choice.

Culture

Bergen is one of the most important cultural centers in Norway. The city is the home of the Bergen International Festival, Nattjazz and Bergenfest, festivals of international renown within their genres. The local symphony orchestra, Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra, was founded in 1786. It is one of the world's oldest orchestral institutions. Bergen was the home of Norway's great composer, Edvard Grieg. Henrik Ibsen, the famous playwright, started his career in Bergen as manager of Den Nationale Scene.

Around 2000, a number of artists from the rhythmic music scene in Bergen gained international fame. In the domestic press, this became known as the Bergen Wave. Musicians and bands with roots in Bergen include Annie, Burzum, Enslaved, Gorgoroth, Immortal, Erlend Øye, Kings of Convenience, Röyksopp, Sondre Lerche, and Datarock. Bergen still has a thriving underground/indie music scene.

In recent years, a number of great international artists have visited Bergen, including Bob Dylan, The Rolling Stones, Metallica, Iron Maiden, Foo Fighters, Coldplay, Muse, Bruce Springsteen, Depeche Mode, Kent and Mark Knopfler. And in the summer of 2011 several artists including Roxette, Mastodon, Avenged Sevenfold, Suzanne Vega, Bob Dylan, Kaizers Orchestra, Kanye West and Rihanna appeared.

Get in

By plane
Bergen Airport Flesland ()() is located 19 km south of the city. The main international airports with flights to Bergen are , , and . There are also flights from various cities in the United Kingdom (such as , , and ); , , , , various cities in , and some other airports. There is also a high frequency of domestic flights to (Several per hour), , , and . The main carriers in Norway are SAS and the low cost airlines Norwegian Air Shuttle. The Dutch KLM has flights to Amsterdam. The smallest airports in Norway are usually served by Widerøe.

There is a frequent (every 15 minutes) airport bus service (Norwegian: Flybussen which takes about 30-40 minutes to downtown (costing kr. 100, return ticket valid for one month kr. 160). There is also a nice light-rail that goes from the airport, right outside, to downtown. Tickets costs kr. 39 one way and can be bought in the app or ticket machine at the station. The trip from the airport to city centre takes 40 minutes.

Taxis are also available but they cost much more (kr. 300-350 on weekdays to downtown, more at night and at the weekend). There are some local buses occasionaly going to and from the airport (see the -section for more information on local buses). They have limited space for luggage and take longer, but only cost kr. 25.

The car rental companies AVIS, Budget, Hertz, Europcar and National all have offices at Bergen Airport Flesland. Located in the terminal building, by the exit, most of them are open 7AM–9PM on weekdays. Opening hours in the weekend are limited, but some of the companies will offer 24 hours rental if you make a reservation.

By train

Bergen is served by a railway line which runs from . The railway line is operated by the Norwegian State Railways The journey takes about seven hours and gives you beautiful views, especially for the last three hours. When passing , you will cross over a high mountain plateau and then travel downwards through some of the most wonderful scenery in Norway. If you buy your ticket online well in advance, fares may be as low as kr. 199 for a one-way ticket. For an additional fee of kr. 90, you may upgrade your ticket to NSB Komfort, the equivalent of first class, with slightly better seats, free coffee and tea, and a power outlet. If you want to make more out of your journey, book your tickets on the phone (+47 815 00 888, press 9 for information in English). Phone reservations cost 50 NOK extra per ticket however, so be sure to mention you had trouble booking on their website (which is common) to avoid the extra cost. Ask to get a window seat on one of the most recent upgraded trains (they're quite stylish and have power outlets by every seat) on the left hand side (this will give you the best view). The railway station is located east of the city centre, close to the bus station and the Bygarasjen garage.

Universal access is a priority to the Norwegian State Railways. Book your ticket on the phone or buy it at the train station at least a day in advance to inform staff if you have any special needs. You will have the same offers as are available online. Most trains are equipped with lifts or ramps and handicap toilets. Wheelchairs can be secured on board. For the seeing impaired, there are tactile lines in the larger stations. Staff will assist you in the station. If you need an assistant and can provide documentation, you and your traveling companion will get a 50 % discount off the full ticket price.

By car

When travelling by car from Oslo, European road E16 is the longest, but easiest drive and it has few toll booths. Between Lærdal and , the road goes through Lærdalstunnelen, the longest road tunnel in the world. This route is less prone to be closed on short notice in the winter due to weather conditions, compared with the other mountain crossings. 

There are many other alternatives, such as RV7 (the Hardangervidda route) which probably is the most scenic route, but also more difficult with regards to both weather and driving conditions. The road takes you across the mountain plateau Hardangervidda and along the innermost parts of Hardangerfjorden. From Eidfjord, continue over the bridge to where RV7 meets E16 or take the beautiful "Hardangerfjord route" from Granvin via Norheimsund. Parts of this scenic "Hardangerfjord route" is narrow, even with single lane roads. Caravanists, be aware! Please also note that the Hardanger bridge crossing is very expensive for larger vehicles (NOK 600 for vehicles over 3500 kg). 

Other interesting alternatives from eastern Norway are:

*The nice Aurland-Hol route from upper Hallingdal to Flåm. Take RV7 to Hagafoss, then RV50 to Flåm. This is a quick route many Norwegians prefer, as there are no ferries - but be prepared for some narrow, dark tunnels and the rather steep, but breathtaking descent down from the mountains. 
*The Numedal Valley route from Kongsberg to Geilo on RV40, and then over the Hardangervidda plateau (see RV7 above). Enjoy very decent and even good roads along this peaceful valley. This route has much less traffic than Hallingdal. A good alternative if you travel from Vestfold county, but not the fastest route from Oslo. 
*The Haukeli route via mystical Telemark through the southern part of Hordaland county on E134. Take R13 to Odda, then 555 to Utne and the ferry to Kvandal. Continue on the Hardanger route (see above). Alternative: The “unknown”, fascinating route from Odda via the Folgefonna tunnel to the outer Hardangerfjord area. Visit the Barony at Rosendal or try summer skiing on the glacier, then take the ferry from Løfallstrand to Gjermundhavn. Drive to Eikelandsosen and take the short Venjaneset-Hatvik ferry crossing, or drive to Tysse and over the Gulfjellet mountain to Bergen. Some narrow roads. As for the Numedal route this is a good alternative if you’re starting from the districts south of Oslo - or if you arrive on a ferry (Horten, Sandefjord, Langesund, Larvik etc).

From , choose E39, which takes you past , Stord and . The trip takes approximately four hours. Many toll roads and two ferries. From , or any of the other cities, towns and villages north of Bergen, the shortest road is also E39, but if you're coming from Trondheim or the northern part of , the inland roads might be a better choice. However, for the most scenic road, choose E39 and consider detours along road RV60 or road RV5.

Generally, you will find that some roads in rural areas, even the highways between the cities, are of poor quality. There are no motorways except in the areas in and around the largest cities, due to the rather low traffic and the somewhat difficult conditions in the mountains. Even if some people drive very fast, you should mind the speed limits (usually 80 km/h) and drive according to the conditions. In the mountains, help can be hours away. Furthermore, you should expect traffic controls and police in unmarked cars nearly everywhere. Fines are very high. Do also keep in mind that to avoid dangerous situations, it's a very good idea to stop and let faster traffic pass you.

The trip from Oslo to Bergen takes between seven and nine hours, depending on the route, the driving conditions and whether you choose to make any stops on the way. Be prepared to add some hours driving time in the winter - and remember that the daylight will be scarce for many months. It might be a good idea to use two days in the winter if you're not accustomed to these conditions. A 12 or even 14 hour drive on icy, dark roads in bad weather is not very nice.

If you plan to cross the mountains (for instance by driving from Oslo to Bergen) in the winter season, it is imperative that you are prepared for the journey. Always keep a full tank of fuel, and keep warm clothes, food and drink in the car. Make sure your tires are good enough and suited for winter conditions (studded or non-studded winter tires; "all-year" tires are not enough), and that you have sufficient skills for driving in snowy and cold conditions. Roads are often closed on short notice due to weather conditions. For advice on conditions and closed roads, call 175 in Norway or check the online road reports (in Norwegian only) from the Norwegian State road authorities. Remember that not all parts of the roads have cellular phone coverage.

If arriving in Bergen by car, you will be better off not taking your car into the city center unless you know exactly where you're going, as most streets are one-way or do not allow cars at all (only buses and taxis), read more in the section.

By bus

Via the network of NOR-WAY Bussekspress Bergen is accessible from almost the entire country. Bus is usually the cheapest way to travel, but can take some time. The national buses are very comfortable, but not suitable for people using a wheelchair. Schedules and fares are available online, and it is also possible to pre-book. Booking may be required on some routes. The bus station is conveniently located just a few minutes walk from the city center. The terminal for long distance buses is situated on the rear side of the station.

By boat

There are fast boat services from Stavanger as well as several communities north of Bergen. Because these passenger ferries stop at various small towns on the way there, you get a great view of the coast and its islands. Fjord1 runs ferries north of Bergen, Tide runs services south of Bergen (including Stavanger-Bergen connection). The boat terminal is on the Nordnes peninsula in the city center.

Bergen is the southern terminus for a week-long passenger ship route with stops along Norway's coast all the way to in the far north of Norway. Ålesund can be reached overnight, and Trondheim will take one full day and two nights. The terminal is located at Nøstet. The Hurtigruten ships are accessible with a wheelchair.

There are passenger/car ferries which run to and from in northern operated by Fjordline Domestic trips from are also available. The Bergen terminal is the Skoltegrunn pier, some hundred meters beyond Bryggen.

Get around

On foot

Within the city center, walking is the best way to get around. You can walk across the downtown in 20 minutes in any direction. The most central streets of the city generally have a good accessibility for the disabled. The most important pedestrian crossings have sound signals and are indicated by tactile paving. They are also accessible with a wheelchair. Although paved stone is a popular material in the streets, it is rarely used in pedestrian areas. A map with more information on this subject is available from the municipality's website 

By bus
Schedules
Bus schedules can be a bit difficult to understand. Ask a local or a bus driver, both will usually be able and happy to assist you. There is an information desk at the bus station providing information on all local bus and train lines free of charge. Calling 177 will also put you in contact with the information center (if you call from a cell phone, be sure to ask for the information center for Hordaland county, as this is a national service).

Schedules and outline maps of the services are available online The online map FINN kart displays the location of bus stops (but not schedules or lines). Schedules can also be picked up from any bus, but are only available in Norwegian, like their web counterparts. 

For a few major stops, the bus may have a fixed departure time, and will not leave before schedule. At other stops though, a bus may leave a few minutes ahead of schedule. During periods of high traffic, the bus may be several minutes late. Rush hour traffic is sometimes accounted for in the schedule by greater time allowances, but busy Saturday shopping is often not.

Schedule information at stops, if present, refers to the bus' departure time from the originating station, or another major stop, and there are usually few indications on how long the bus takes to reach your stop. Furthermore the name of a stop is almost never written on the stop itself, and in some cases, one stop may be referred to by multiple names, often corresponding to a particular landmark. Don't be alarmed; as long as you take into account that you may have to spend some more time than the schedule says, you'll be fine if you ask the bus driver or a passenger for help.

Fares
Tickets can be bought from the driver or from ticket machines at major stops. The driver only accepts cash payment. Ticket machines are in Norwegian only, but some instructions in English are provided, and finding a local willing to help will usually never be difficult.

Tickets for travels within Bergen municipality (and Straume on Sotra, Kleppestø on Askøy, and Søfteland in Os) cost kr. 31 per trip for adults, and kr. 15 for senior citizens (67 years or older), children (15 years or younger) and other people entitled to a discount (such as the disabled). Note that if you pay by cash within Bergen, there is a 10,- fee onboard the buses. This can be avoided by using ticket automats and the cell phone app (Skyss Billett in Play Store and Apple store).

If you purchase your ticket from a machine, you will be given a receipt and a grey card that is actually your ticket. The ticket must be validated when you enter a bus by holding it close to the electronic card reader until you get a green light. Tickets bought from machines are valid for 90 minutes after validated. When you purchase a ticket from the driver, you will find the time of validity printed on it. Within the ninety minutes you may travel freely within the area covered by your fare. 

If you are caught without a valid ticket or fare card, you will be kicked off the bus and get a 750NOK fine. Controls are common and performed by both uniformed and plain-clothes personnel.

Fare cards in the form of the electronic "Skysskort" can be obtained at the customer service desk at the bus station (see above). The "Skysskort" can be personal or anonymous.

*Both anonymous and personal cards can be charged with kr. 200 at a time. You can then use the card to pay for single tickets from the driver or ticket machines. This entitles you to a 17% discount off the adult fare. You can charge your card with the driver or by using ticket machines at major stops.

*With both anonymous and personal cards, you can buy a 12-journeys pass from the driver or ticket machines. Adults will get 12 journeys for the price of 10. When you enter a bus through the back door, hold your card close to the card reader. After a few seconds, the card reader display will show "FleksiSkyss" and the number of journeys remaining on your card. Press the button close to the text, and hold your card close to the card reader again. You will get a green light when your card has been charged the journey. If you enter the bus through the front door, tell the driver that you have a "FleksiSkyss" card and he or she will charge it for you. Note that 12-journeys passes can only be charged one journey at a time. If you are several people travelling together, you need one card per person.

*Personal and anonymous cards allow you to buy 7-days, 30-days, or 180-days passes, giving you unlimited travel for the chosen period of time. Students receive discounts on the 7-, 30-, and 180-days passes. Youth (aged 16-19) can purchase 30-days passes for kr. 295. Passes can be activated and renewed with the driver or by using ticket machines. If you are entitled to a discount you have to activate your pass with the driver or at the bus station the first time you want to use it. When you travel with a 7-, 30- or 180-days pass remember to always carry a photo ID, and validate your card by holding it close to the card reader when you enter the bus (there's no need to press any buttons).

*Cell phone app allows you to buy single tickets, 24hour tickets, 7 day and 30 day tickets on the cell phone, by credit card. It is reccomended to have a functioning data connection on your phone when using the app, but if you get a norwegian sim card it is an excellent and easy way for tourists to get period tickets to travel cheap. The app is available in norwegian and english. The cell phone app only covers the zone 1 Bergen area.

Children under 4 always travel free, and so do their carriages. Outside rush hours and in the weekends, children under 16 travel free when accompanied by an adult. Groups traveling together will also receive a discount.

Lines and services
Regular bus services operate throughout the day, major trunk routes running through downtown run with a 20-minute frequency or better. In the suburbs, there are smaller lines, generally operating from a local terminal, with less frequent services. There are not so many buses between the city centre and the southern neighbourhoods of Fana and Ytrebygda, instead the runs from the city centre to the regional terminal at Nesttun, where feeder buses bring passengers onwards.

Most major lines operate seven days a week, including all holidays (usually a regular Sunday schedule with a few exceptions), but some of the lesser lines may have little or no service in the weekends. During the school vacation (mid-June to mid-August), buses are less frequent, so make sure you have an updated bus schedule. On Christmas Eve (December 24), there are no buses after about 4 PM. On Constitution Day (May 17), the parades and celebrations shut down the downtown streets, though buses do run to and from downtown, they will generally not run through downtown on that day.

After about 1AM, regular bus services cease to run. In the weekends, there are a few night bus lines available. Tickets are more expensive than on the regular lines (kr. 60 within city limits), and travel passes can not be used. Tickets must be bought from the driver.

Accessibilty

The process of replacing old buses with newer ones accessible for people using a wheelchair is ongoing. Most buses on central lines, including the parking bus, have low floors and a built-in ramp. On thet new buses, that are now in majority, the stops are announced on a display. The bus driver will usually be able to assist you in English, if required.

By light rail

A light rail line runs between the city centre and southwards to the airport. This is the primary means of public communication to southern parts of Bergen. The line passes the railway station, the bus station, Brann soccer stadium, the student homes at Fantoft and Nesttun along the route. The line operates from 6AM to 1AM, seven days a week, generally with a 10-minute frequency (a bit more often during rush hours, 15-minute frequency on Saturday mornings, 30-minute frequency on Sunday mornings). The entire journey takes about 44 minutes.

Night lines operate all Friday and Saturday night with departures every 30 minutes.

You need to buy your ticket from the ticket machine at the station before you board or in the "Skyss Billett" app. Apart from that, the ticket and fare card system is the same as for buses, see the section for more details. It's possible to change from bus to light rail and from light rail to bus within the time of validity of a ticket.

The light rail is accessible with a wheelchair. All stops are announced and displays also show the name of the next stop.

By car

It is an expressed goal of both local and national authorities to cut car traffic in the city center. Thus, the speed limit downtown is very low, and most streets are one-way streets. If you plan on getting from one part of downtown to another, walking is often faster than driving, even for locals who know their way around. Furthermore, parking in the streets are reserved for the handicapped and residents with a special permit with only a very few exceptions. If you plan to drive to the city center from outside of it, unless you have any special needs, park your car in a garage, such as Bygarasjen (very large, at the bus station) and Klostergarasjen (at Nøstet, northern downtown); Bygarasjen being the cheaper. There are also several smaller (and more expensive) garages around town. If you take the chance to bring your car further downtown, be sure to read all signs – most streets are one-way streets and some are for buses and taxis only.

To park in a spot reserved for the disabled, you need a standard European "blue badge", a special parking permit (generally, handicapped parking permits from most countries will be accepted). It must be placed on the inside of your car's front window, clearly visible from the outside. You will find a list of parking spots for the disabled in the city center on the municipal parking authorities' website along with some information on the general rules of parking The accessibility map mentioned previously also indicates where parking spots for the disabled are situated.

Driving in the area outside the city center is quite convenient, with expressways going in most directions. The roads are well sign-posted, but a map will probably come in handy anyway. Mind the speed limits; traffic controls are common and fines are stiff. Do also keep in mind that a lot of the roads are toll roads. All toll stations are automated. When approaching one, keep driving and do not slow down. A photograph of you license plates will be taken, and you will receive an invoice per mail. During rush hours (7:30AM-9AM and 3PM-5PM) traffic is jammed many places, but it's nothing compared to larger cities in Europe.

Between 1 November and 31 March, the use of studded tires is legal. Within Bergen municipality, you have to pay a fee to use such tires. You can pay at automated payment stations on the main roads into Bergen (Norwegian: oblatautomat), Statoil gas stations or by visiting the municipal parking authorities in Bygarasjen or Vincens Lunges gate 3 (directly south of the railway station).

By taxi

Taxi is generally expensive in Norway. Throughout Bergen, there are a number of taxi stalls where taxis are parked waiting for customers. During the day, taxis will usually not pick up customers nearer than 300 metres from the stalls, except when called to an address. During the night in the weekends, taxi queues can be very long (up to one hour), and all customers are therefore required to go to the stalls. It is possible to order taxis to addresses also at this time of the week, but you shouldn't really expect the taxi to arrive.

The places where the taxis are stationed changes from time to time because of renovation of the city streets, but usually you will find them at the bus station, the railway station, Festplassen, Ole Bulls plass, Torget and in Torggaten and Vetrlidsalmenning. Look for signs saying "Taxi". Some taxi stalls are only open during night, and vice versa. Information about this is printed on a separate sign below the taxi sign. If no taxis are available at the taxi stall, call 07000 (Bergen Taxi), 08000 (Norgestaxi), +47 55 70 00 00 (Taxi 1) or +47 55 70 80 90 (Bryggen Taxi). Note that there is usually a fee associated with calling a taxi. Taxis may also be ordered in advance by calling one of these numbers, which is recommended if you have the possibility. Most hotels in Bergen also have iPads in the front desk area where you can book a taxi. Also, most receptionists will call a taxi for you if you ask nicely.

Fares are approximately the same regardless of the taxi company. All companies are regarded as reliable and safe. If several taxis are available at a taxi station, you may pick the one you want from the line.

It can be added that taxi drivers rarely expect or receive any tip.

By train

There is one local commuter train service, between the downtown Bergen train station and the fairly rural suburb of Arna in the east (schedules available from the Norwegian State Railways' web site). If you are going to Arna, the train is by far the fastest option from downtown since the roads run around the mountains while the railway line runs straight through them, taking only eight minutes.

In Arna, the train station, the bus terminal and the shopping center lie very close to one another.

By bicycle
Bergen has a small city centre, that can easily be biked. Getting around by bike can be difficult in Bergen due to inadequate infrastructure. Many central streets are paved with cobblestone, and there are only a few roads with designated cycling lanes in the centre of Bergen. It is legal to cycle on the sidewalks as long as you are cautious of pedestrians. Front and rear lights are mandatory after dark. Bicycle theft and vandalism do occur, so be careful where you leave your bike and always use a lock.

Bergen have shared bicycles operated by " Bergen Bysykkel". Daily passes can be bought for 49 NOK and a pass for one year can be bought for 399 NOK.

See

There's a number of attractions in Bergen and the surrounding areas. Surveys do, however, show that most tourists in Bergen find the atmosphere, cultural landscape and architecture more compelling than the typical sights, so pick a few things to see and spend the rest of your time in Bergen sitting down in a park or café, strolling around the city, enjoying a concert or hiking the mountains. On sunny summer days, stay downtown until late to enjoy the sunset in the north.

Downtown

* One of the largest art museums in the Nordic countries, with art from the renaissance as well as contemporary art. The museum houses several of Edvard Munch's works.

* Bergen's outdoor fish market has a long history, being the historical center for fish trade. Most tourists find their way here, but with locals changing their shopping habits, the fish market today does not compare to what it once was. The fish market is dominated by makeshift souvenir shops and seafood stalls. The seafood is generally of only ok quality as the fishermen no longer deliver their catch directly to the market. Still, you can get a pretty good idea of what the locals eat by having a look at the various fish they sell here, and try some of the stranger ones, if you feel adventurous. Free samples of are usually available of the more common items such as whale, salmon and salmon caviar. Although somewhat crowded, getting around with a wheelchair is fairly easy.

Prices here are very high, and a lunch can easily cost you 80 euros per person. Many items such as caviar, canned herring, mackrel in tomato, cloudberry jam and other stuff can be purchased for a fraction of the prices in the nearby supermarkets

* Fløibanen is a funicular which goes up Fløyen, a plateau in the mountain massif north-east of the city center. From here, you get a great view of the city. Accessing Fløibanen and the plateau on Fløyen with a wheelchair is a piece of cake. More than 1.2 million people rode with Fløibanen in 2007, and it has become the attraction that the most tourists are content with. Expect queues, but don't worry, they move fast. There are no steps where lifts are not available without assistance, and all doors are wide.

* A museum of design and decorative art. Norway's largest collection of Chinese art.

* St. Jørgen's Hospital is one of very few preserved leprosy hospitals from the 18th century in Northern Europe. This was where Armauer Hansen discovered the bacteria that causes leprosy in 1873. The Leprosy Museum tells the story about the disease and its history in Norway, in addition to showing life at the hospital. A visit to the museum is a unique but disturbing experience.

* The aquarium has a nice selection of aquatic life, especially penguins and seals. Typical Norwegian aquatic life is well documented, and there is also a collection of tropical fish and animals and a shark tank with an underwater glass tunnel. Fun for kids.

* A three-masted barque sail training vessel built in 1914, one of the best kept in its kind. Mini cruises (approximately five and a half hours) available a few times a year, at the cost of kr. 425 including food. Tickets should be bought well in advance. For the more adventurous up to week-long cruises to Europe are available where you live and work as a sailor.

* The oldest remaining building in Bergen, St. Mary's Church was built in the 12th century. It is the best preserved of the city's three medieval churches. Having belonged to the German community in Bergen for many centuries, it contains a unique pulpit and one of Norway's most beautiful altarpieces.

Bergenhus fortress

* Once the seat of the king, Bergenhus fortress is one of the oldest and best preserved forts of Norway. The oldest surviving buildings are from the mid 13th century, but the area was a royal residence from the late 11th century. The fortress is situated close to the international ferry terminal. The royal hall, Håkonshallen, (Haakon's Hall), named for King Haakon Haakonsson, was built some time between 1247 and 1261. It is used today for royal galas, as a banqueting hall for the city council, and other public events. The roof is reconstructed after a blast during World War II. The nearby Rosenkrantz tower has the same appearance as it had in the 16th century. The oldest part of the tower dates back to the 1270s, a few decades after Håkonshallen. It was expanded in the 1560s by the governor, Erik Rosenkrantz, to its present shape. The rest of the medieval buildings in the fortress have been replaced or demolished over the centuries, with some ruins still visible. Among these is the medieval cathedral, the Church of Christ, which was used for coronation and as a royal burial site in the 13th century. A memorial marks the site of the high altar. Guided tours of the royal hall and the tower start every hour between 10AM and 4PM every day from 15 May to 31 Aug in the royal hall. From 1 Sept to 14 May tours are only available between noon and 3PM on Sundays. Entrance fee is kr. 60 for adults, 30 for students and free for children under 16. A small cafeteria with coffee, tea and basic snacks is open from June to August. The fortress grounds serve as a city park; you can hang out here and eat that fish you just bought at the nearby fish market - or just enjoy the sunshine and the view. The park is popular among locals and tourists, but usually not crowded. It is normally not a problem to find a good spot for your picnic or a round of Frisbee. There is a very good view of the bay. The use of open fire, including barbecues, and the drinking of alcoholic beverages are forbidden. Unlike in many other parks, the prohibition of alcohol is enforced strictly here, as the fort is still a military area with occasional military guards on patrol.

Bryggen

*Between 1350 and 1750, this area used to be a Hansa dock, trading and processing area. The wooden houses at Bryggen today were built after the devastating city fire of 1702, but are probably very similar to the buildings that were there before. Despite neglect and fires (Norwegian cities had a habit of burning down because everything is made of wood), a considerable number of buildings have survived and are now listed as a . If you enter some of the alleyways between the storefronts, you really get a feel of what Bergen must have been like in the middle ages. There are a few museums on the history of Bergen and of Bryggen, but the most interesting aspect is probably that almost all of the buildings are still in use. One example is the restaurant Bryggen tracteursted serving food and drinks in a building first opened for this purpose in 1708. Wandering about on Bryggen is possible with a wheelchair, but getting in and out of buildings can be very difficult.

Museums

* After the fire in 1955, when a lot of Bryggen burnt down, remains of the first settlement on Bryggen were discovered. The museum is built over these up to 900 years old wooden building foundations, giving a unique insight in Bryggen's architectural history. It contains the world's largest collection of medieval runic inscriptions, mostly inscribed on wooden items, but only a small number of these are on display. It also hosts themed exhibitions.

* The Hanseatic Museum and Schøtstuene are the only places on Bryggen where the original interior is preserved or restored. A tour of The Hanseatic Museum gives you a good introduction to the Hanseatic Bergen and the Hansa life, as you walk around an authentic Hanseatic merchant's house from the early 1700s. The building was in use until the late 19th century, when it was converted into a museum. In Schøtstuene, buildings from other parts of Bryggen are rebuilt to show where people ate, celebrated and held meetings. The museum is not accessible for those using a wheelchair, however the Schøtstuene has a lift for wheelchair users.

*During the first half of World War II, the Theta group, formed by people between the ages of 19 and 22, established radio contact with London and reported movements of the German fleet in Norway. The group headquarters and radio station was located in the heart of occupied Bergen, but remained active for two years before it was discovered and raided by the Nazis. In the 1980s, the small room was reconstructed to its original state by orders of the Directorate of Cultural Heritage. It is now probably the country's smallest museum, displaying radio equipment and the Theta group's own security system. Not accessible with a wheelchair.

Nygårdshøyden and Møhlenpris (southern downtown)

* Bergen Museum is a part of the University of Bergen, and is in the heart of campus. It is divided in two collections, the Cultural History Collections and the Natural History Collections, located in two different buildings. The Cultural History Collections include archeology, anthropology and art- and culture studies sections. Among other things, the museum has a large collection of Norwegian folk art and national costumes. It is notable for its unique exhibition of Norwegian medieval church art, including painted altarpieces, crucifixes and portals from demolished stave churches, all in wood.

* The Natural History Collections include botany, geology and zoology. The zoology exhibitions is preserved more or less as they were when they were put up almost a hundred years ago. Enormous whale skeletons suspended from the ceiling in the exhibition halls are visible through the windows from the outside. The geology exhibition is modern and varied and contains samples from most part of the world, in addition to a nice local collection. Around the museum is a garden which is at its finest in spring and summer. There is also a green house where you can enjoy tropical plants. Note that the Natural History Collection is closing down for major renovation on the November 1st 2013 and will not reopen for several years (no one knows for how long the museum will be closed, but a reopening in 2017 is sometimes suggested). 

* Sponsored by the state and the city in addition to some of the largest industrial companies in Norway, this all new science center features interactive exhibitions of science, technology and mathematics. It targets children and young people with the intention to inspire the to learning more about science, but is popular also among the adults. It has special exhibitions about the weather, the ocean and energy, with altogether 75 different interactive machines and experiments.

* This traditional maritime museum is in the middle of the campus of the University of Bergen. Exhibitions of maritime history, shipping history, the vikings, naval warfare, maritime archeology, and more.

* This is a very nicely landscaped park laid out in the late 1800s after English patterns. The park is a popular picnic place for families, and in the summer there's always several groups of students and young people having barbeques. You are very welcome to step on the grass and it's a nice place to play frisbee, kubb or croquet. If you want to save a few kroner on food and drink stop by a local grocery store to pick up some ingredients to a picnic, bring along a blanket and a few beers and spend a cheap and relaxing afternoon in this park. It's highly unlikely that the police will bother you for drinking in public in this park as long as you behave. It's also one of the places where it's rather easy to get in contact with the locals. There's no public toilet here, but pop over the road to Vilvite and use their facilities for free. If you arrive from Nygårdshøyden, don't be scared by drug addicts hanging out in the upper part of the park, just walk past them and you will find the lower and beautiful part after a few metres.

South of the city center

* Stave churches are built in a distinctive style using the logs of trees as pillars, by the early Christians. This is a reconstruction of a church originally built in , by the Sognefjord, around 1150. On the 6 Jun 1992, the church was totally destroyed by arson, but a perfect copy has since been constructed. The inside of the stave church has no wall paintings and the altar is quite austere. If you have seen the stave church in the Norsk Folkemuseum in Oslo, then save yourself a few kroners and skip this one. 

* The villa at Gamlehaugen, built to resemble a castle, was the home of Christian Michelsen, former prime minister who helped free Norway from the Swedish rule through the peaceful dissolution of the "union" in 1905. Nowadays, the villa is the royal family's residence in Bergen. There is a large and very popular park around the villa. Bathing possibilities.

* The home of the composer Harald Sæverud, famous for late romantic and neo-classicist works now houses a museum with occasional concerts. The somewhat mystic park around the house is open for the public.

* This is the house of the famous composer Edvard Grieg, who wrote the Peer Gynt suite and is Norway's national composer. His country house (just outside the town center of Bergen) has been preserved in the state it was in when he died in 1907. You can also see his and his wife's grave down by the water; they were buried on their own estate. Next to the house, but cleverly hidden in a gully, there is a concert hall with regular concerts. Just before you get to the house, there is a museum devoted to Grieg and his work.

* Cable car to the top of Mt. Ulriken, the highest of the mountains surrounding the city. Re-opened May 2009 with a new restaurant at the top.

North of the city center

* A reconstructed town with about 50 wooden houses from the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries. The houses are inhabited by actors, portraying real and fictional Bergen characters from different periodes of time. Every full hour (except at 1pm), the actors perform a short play (usually in English) about a historical subject. It is a beautiful place to stroll on a sunny day. The more cultural traveler will enjoy a guided tour of the area and the houses. Note: The museum, i.e. the open houses and the actors, is open from May to September. Out of season, the museum area is still open for visitors, free of charge. 

* Located in the buildings that used to house the first fully mechanized knitwear factory in Norway. The machinery is still in working condition and is used. Guided tour, exhibitions and film.

West of the city center

* An old and picturesque formerly industrial community situated on the west coast of the Bergen peninsula. The manor building at Alvøen has been converted into a museum with several exhibitions.

* This 18th century manor is the most splendid of the many country retreats built by Bergen's aristocracy in the past centuries. The roccoco main building is surrounded by several beautiful gardens.

Stage art

*BIT (Bergen International Theater) presents Norwegian and international contemporary stage art productions of high quality.

*The national theater in Bergen. In a beautifully restored building, the theater presents a variety of plays on three different stages, from traditional Ibsen to contemporary plays. The largest stage (Store scene) is where most mainstream plays are played, while the two smaller stages features more alternative plays, often the most interesting ones. The plays are in Norwegian.

*Although Bergen does not have its own opera house, it does have its own opera company. Den Nye Opera (The New Opera) usually put on a few productions throughout the year. Summer performances are often at the Bergenhus Fortress while other productions are performed at Den Nationale Scene or at Grieghallen. Tickets are available online. Tickets usually range from kr. 200 to kr. 550 depending on seating and availability. Bergen does not attract the top performers, and the quality may vary a bit, usually anywhere between superb and a bit below average. 

Beach-life

Hanging out by the ocean can be one of the best ways to spend a summerday in Bergen. The temperature in the ocean around Bergen is warmer than most places on the west coast because of the outer islands protecting the area from the constant flow of cooler water from the North Sea, and allowing the water to heat in smaller bays in the area. Temperatures can rise to 20°C after consecutive days with good weather. The water is clean and fresh. There are sandy beaches at Arboretet at Milde (Hjellestad), Kyrkjetangen at Nordåsvannet and Helleneset, "bathing houses"/beaches at Nordnesparken and Elsero situated in Old Bergen in Sandviken. After a day hiking in the mountains, Skomakerdiket above Mount Fløyen has a sandy fresh-water beach.

* Public seawater "pool".

Hiking

The mountains surrounding Bergen offers great hiking possibilities. There are options for anyone from those just looking for a fifteen-minute stroll in the sun to the more adventurous interested in daytrips and steep hills. Byfjellene (lit. "the city mountains") have good networks of dirtroads and paths, usually well signposted. Good maps are available in most bookstores – look for Tur- og friluftskart Bergen (1:25 000) from the Norwegian Mapping and Cadastre Authority (Norwegian: Statens kartverk).

For advice on hiking, as well as hiking opportunities elsewhere in Norway, you should consult Bergen Turlag (Bergen Hiking Association), the local branch of Den Norske Turistforening (Norwegian Trekking Association), located in Tverrgaten 4-6. The Norwegian entitles you to hike in all uncultivated areas.

Mount Fløyen

Mount Fløyen is the most central of the mountains. It is easily accessible by the funicular running from downtown, but the better fit will probably choose the 40-minutes walk up. A good compromise can be to take the funicular up and walk down. The way is well signposted, so you won't get lost. In the steep slope towards Fløyen (right above the city) there is the popular Fjellveien, a long, gentle, horizontal pedestrian road with a perfect panorama of the city. From Fjellveien, there are several alternative roads to the top.

From the top of Mount Fløyen, the 1.8 km (1.1 mi) walk in relatively flat terrain to Brushytten (lit. "the soda cabin") is ideal, if you have kids. Brushytten is a kiosk usually open on Sundays. There are several ways to get there, if you follow the signs, you're on the safe side and will walk on dirtroads all the way (easily accessible with both a wheelchair or a pram).

From Brushytten, you can walk up the hill to Mount Rundemanen and get a beautiful view. From Mount Rundemanen, a good choice for a not-so-long hike will be to walk to Sandviksfjellet, and from there down to Sandviken, where you can get on a bus or walk back to the city center. Another possibility is to cross the Vidden plateau and walk to Mount Ulriken, the highest mountain in Bergen, a hike which takes about five hours. You should be somewhat fit to take this trip, and also be prepared for bad weather. The trip across Vidden is among Norway's most popular hiking trips.

For both kids and adults, a popular activity on snowy days is to take the funicular to the top of Mount Fløyen and toboggan to the city center.

7-Fjellsturen

If you want to experience the spectacular landscape of Bergen, along with thousands of people on the same day, this hiking challenge is for you. Every year, Bergen og Hordaland Turlag organizes this massive event on the last Sunday of May. The first event was held on 1948.

The full trail is 35 km long and the altitude is 2400 meters which reaches 7 peaks of Bergen (Lyderhorn, Damsgårdsfjellet, Løvstakken, Ulriken, Fløyfjellet, Rundemannen, Sandviksfjellet). The full trail is very tough, needs 8-10 hours to complete, if you plan to stop to take photographs even more! At the application, it is possible to do only the last 3 or 4 peaks, so everyone can find their own challenge level.

The cost for the full trail is 450 NOK for adults and non members which includes the bus transport to the start, the refreshment at the half of the trail, water refill, a diploma and a technical T-shirt at the end. However if you apply to this event between the middle of December, and Christmas time, the price is just 200 NOK.

It is possible to buy medal after your first completion, and can apply for higher prices if you complete the full trail in more occasions.

You can find more information about the event here and it is good idea to read the Norwegian page of the event (use Google Translate), because it is more up to date about the event 

Fishing

The islands, fjords and lakes surrounding Bergen provide excellent conditions for both saltwater and fresh-water fishing. Fishing from fresh water lakes usually requires a local rod permit, even permission from the land owner. Pay attention to signs marking lakes used for drinking water.

Coast and deep sea fishing is free and there is no need for any license. However, no more than 15 kilos of fish fillets or fish products can be exported from Norway per person and there are some regulations concerning the minimum size of the fish. Consult the web site of The Norwegian Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs for more information 
 
Fishing in the city centre (Bryggen, Vågen, Bontelabo, Dokken) is possible, but there are some concerns about traces of mercury in white fish fillet and liver. A new report may indicate that the situation is better than expected, but a good advice is to avoid fishing in Vågen, from old ship yards and the Åstveittangen and Eidsvågen areas. 

A general, very cautious advice could be not to eat liver from fish caught in areas close to the city centre - and pregnant and breast feeding women should not eat this fish at all.

Events

*Music festival from the end of April to start of May. A number of concerts in most rythmic music genres (pop, rock, hip hop, blues, soul) all over town.

* BIFF is a week-long film festival held in October every year at Bergen kino (the Magnus Barfot multiplex cinema). In 2007 BIFF had 40,000 visitors.

* Yearly event hosted by the reggae collective Cushion in the beginning of June.

* On 17 May, every business in town, except restaurants downtown, is closed as the citizens dress up in their finest clothes and celebrate all day long. You will be stunned by the amount of people in the streets – one can hardly move around – and by the beautiful national costumes every second person you meet will wear. This is the day people will look oddly on you if you wear anything less then a suit or dress. At 7AM, there is a twenty-one-gun salute from Skansen, half way up Mount Fløyen, as the morning parade starts from Dreggen. At 10:30AM, the main parade starts at Torgalmenningen, goes around town and ends up at Festplassen. The parade is formed by children and organizations such as sports teams, and only a very few military troops, unlike in many other countries. The level of nationalism can perhaps be a bit overwhelming for foreigners, but try to say gratulerer med dagen (literally "congratulations on the day") to anyone you meet, and you will probably get the same in response, even if you're not Norwegian at all.

*The night before Constitution Day is the definite party night in Bergen.

*With about 160 events in two weeks from the end of May to start of June, Bergen International Festival is the largest festival of its kind in the Nordic countries. The festival presents literature, dance, theater and classical music. The latest years, focus has been on art from the Nordic countries.

*Nattjazz is a two-weeks long jazz festival from the end of May to the start of June, the longest jazz festival in Northern Europe. All concerts take place at Verftet USF, a former sardine factory located at Nøstet, with a capacity of over 4000 guests. With a day-pass, you get access to all concerts that night for a fair price. Usually, there are six or seven concerts every night, some simultaneously on the various stages. The festival's musical profile ranges from traditional jazz to world music. Some of the artists that previously has played on Nattjazz are Gotan Project, Ahmed Jamal, Jan Garbarek, Stan Getz, Art Blakey, Herbie Hancock, Van Morrison and James Brown.

* is a contemporary art triennial occurring from beginning of September to end of October. There're also many workshops and meetings. 

Learn

Institutions of higher education in Bergen include the University of Bergen The Norwegian School of Business and Economics Bergen National Academy of the Arts and Bergen University College The university is Norway's second largest and covers most areas of education, though the educations in law and in medicine are probably considered the best. The Norwegian School of Business and Economics is considered the best education within these fields in the country. All the aforementioned institutions are members of the Nordplus and Erasmus exchange programmes and offer courses in English.

Buy

Bergen has a number of shopping centers, and international chains are well represented. As prices are rather high in Norway, regular shopping is probably not the most interesting thing to do in Bergen, even if you get a VAT refund (see the section below). But if you know where to go, you can find rare and unique items, both traditional crafts and stuff made by local designers - and some other fun stuff. Keep in mind that with a very few exceptions, Bergen shuts down completely on Sundays and holidays.

Shops

* Music store, sells CDs, vinyls and band merchandise. Recently, it has revamped with a liquor license - great specialty craft beers available on tap and in bottle while listening to records. Table seating available for 2-20ish. Some snacks available as well. 

* A small shop selling beautiful Norwegian handmade textiles, such as tablecloths and napkins.

* This market hall built in 1877 was once the only one in its kind in Norway. Nowadays it houses Bergen's finest gourmet food stores, the most interesting for tourists being Havets Grøde and Sesong. Havets Grøde has a large selection of top quality seafood, with fresh deliveries every day. The quality is usually much better than at the fish market. Sesong offers the season's food directly from local farms and producers.

* Husfliden is a chain of stores throughout Norway with focus on traditional Norwegian crafts. The most interesting things for tourists found in these stores are traditional jewelry and tableware. Husfliden also sells beautiful national costumes (Norwegian: bunad).

* Expensive, but cool clothes and shoes for both men and women

* Extremely stylish menswear.

* Independent fashion store for men and women with brands such as IVANAHelsinki, Moods of Norway, Namso, GTP, Birna, Pernilla Svenre, Maria Weterlind, El Naturlista, William Rast, Gabba, Scotch&Soda, Minium, Insight, Pace and Pour. Voted Bergen's best clothing store in 2010.

* Sweet and handmade clothing for girls from 2–11 years of age.

*Handknitted pullovers,cardigans and accessories from the brand Norsk Håndstrikk. The sweaters are made by hand in Norway, knitted by norwegian ladies in their homes. Rare and unique products. The shop also carry a great selection of other norwegian made products, in addition to other souvenirs like trolls, softtoys etc. The prices are very good compared to other shops at Bryggen.

Tax Free shopping

VAT (value added tax/sales tax, Norwegian: mva. (merverdiavgift) or moms. (merverdiomsetningsavgift)) is 25 % for most items in Norway. It is included in the retail price, which makes the VAT content roughly 20 % of the price you pay. As Norway is not a member of the European union, all foreign citizens (apart from those of Sweden, Denmark and Finland) are eligible for a refund of the VAT if the goods purchased are brought out of the country at the latest one month after the purchase. The prerequisites for such a refund is that the goods are not used or consumed, even in part, within Norway, and that you spend at least kr. 315 in a store.

Look for stores with a Global Refund/tax free flag or sticker. You need only to ask the shop assistant for a global refund check, and provide documentation of your citizenship. When leaving Norway, go to a Global Refund office with the goods, the check and your passport, and you will receive up to 19 % of the sales price in cash. In Bergen, the only Global Refund office is at the airport, but there are also information desks on a couple of the ferries leaving from the city. Check the Global Refund website for more information.

Unlike in many other countries, the customs authorities are not involved in the VAT refund process in Norway.

Eat

There is a great variety of restaurants and cafes in Bergen, but you should expect to spend some time looking for the best places. In the most central parts of the city, many of the restaurants are all the same. Move a block away from the most central parts of downtown to find lower prices and better food. Kitchens usually close at 11PM at the latest.

Waiters and other restaurant staff have good wages. You are not required to leave any money to cover the service, but many people choose to tip the waiter if he or she has been helpful and nice, and if the food was good. If you choose to leave a tip, rounding up or adding about five to ten percent will be appreciated. A rule of thumb would be that the more expensive the food is, the more are you expected to leave a tip.

Keep in mind that tap water is safe to drink and (usually) free of charge. To save money, ask for tap water to drink.

Local food

Finding local food might take some effort, but there are some options. There aren't that many local dishes available at restaurants. "Norwegian" food is the food of the husmann (cottager) – nutritious and cheap, not what you usually find in a restaurant. The Bergen fish soup might be the most important, as well as raspeballer and cooked cod. If you want to get that Norwegian taste and have a gourmet meal at the same time, look for dishes that use "local" ingredients (such as reindeer, stockfish and cod) with a twist, such as Bryggen Tracteursted's filet of reindeer farced with goat cheese. 

Many cafe's and restaurants serve "raspeballer" on Thursdays. Raspeballer are local potato dumplings, in Bergen usually served with bacon, sausages, salted meat from sheep, melted butter and mashed rutabaga. You can get takeaway raspeballer at Kjøttbasaren (kr. 50), cheap ones at Lido, excellent ones at Pingvinen and Bjellands Kjøkken. You can get reasonable take-away fish soup, fish-balls, "plukkfisk" and fish-gratin at Madam Bergen. 

In November, December and January, traditional Christmas food is served in many restaurants. Look for "pinnekjøtt" (cured, dried and sometimes smoked meat of lamb or mutton), "lutefisk" (lit. "lye fish", dried cod prepared with lye) and "ribbe" (oven-baked pork ribs). For a very special experience, try smalahove (sheep's head). It is a traditional dish from not far from Bergen.

Budget

* Bjellands Kjøkken is a tiny cafe at Nordnes (Strandgaten), run by 84 year old Randi Bjelland which is worth the walk herself. She does everything by herself in a tiny kitchen, makes everything from scratch. Serves a great variety of traditional food depending on season; huge flesh-pancakes, homemade fish-cakes, meatballs, cooked cod, salted meat, whale-meat etc. 6 tables, good portions and reasonable prices (200 NOK per portion, in December 2018). Cash payments only.

* A fantastic place to eat. The prices are cheap, and the food and service are excellent. It is located close to the city center, 200 meters from the bus station. It is definitely worth trying at least once. 

* Good-quality Chinese food freshly cooked in the open kitchen. Service is fast, and the prices are low. This is a place with many regular customers, especially between 4PM and 6PM. Around kr. 86 for most courses.

* The Thai equivalent of Hot Wok, although with slightly smaller portions. Service is usually fast, and the staff is friendly. Can often be full, so take-out can be a good plan B. Serves lunch for kr. 59. There is also a Kroa Thai restaurant with the same menu in Åsane senter, a few miles outside of the town senter. Multiple options for vegetarians.

* Cheap but decent pasta and pizza for students and budget travellers alike. Pasta Sentral has been an institution in Bergen since its opening in 1990. Provides a take-out service as well.

*Organic restaurant situated in the heart of Bergen. featuring live conserts and art exibitions.

* Soups and salads – tasty, cheap and big portions.

Mid-range

* One of the most popular restaurants in Bergen, probably most due to its location. It has an exciting interior and decent food.

* Great food for the money. This is a place with many regular customers. During the day they serve lunch and cakes. Early in the evening it is a place for dinner and beer. Late night is for dancing. Main courses are between kr. 80-150.

* Fresh, tasty and fast sushi at the cheapest prices in town. Primarily take-away, but you can also eat in if you don't mind the complete lack of atmosphere.

* The café serves a variety of meals, from sandwiches to dinners. The view is extraordinary. If you are lucky enough to catch a sunny day, you can observe a range of activities that happens in the bay. Indoors the café has a quiet atmosphere. There are large panorama windows facing the water giving you a romantic view even on rainy days. In connection with the restaurant, there is a changing art exhibition. Accessible with a wheelchair.

* Run by a Sicilian, La Bottega Italiana serves Sicilian-style pasta dishes, salads, a few main courses and Tiramisu for Dolce.

* Delicious Thai cusine.

* Open from 4PM every day. An informal restaurant with two price ranges: You can get the best priced gourmet food in town, or you can go for the cheaper "Swedish" menu. Regardless of what you choose, the food is prepared from first class local ingredients, and you get to enjoy the freshly baked bread and white table cloths. One of the best restaurants in town. For dinnertime dining you need a reservation. If you don't have reservations, try the rather crowded pub downstairs - they serve the "Swedish" menu there too. Main courses from the swedish menu are from kr. 80-150, main courses from the gourmet menu are from kr. 180-280.

* A very nice, but usually crowded bar where you can also get a good portion of Norwegian food. Food available throughout opening hours. One of very few venues where genuine Norwegian homecooking – and large bowls of popcorn – are available. Nice prices on food and drink, main courses from kr. 80-140.

* A refreshing cafe/restaurant run by two young girls, which is reflected in the interior and menu. Try out the fried Smil-chokolate with caramel icecream.

Splurge

* Bryggen Tracteursted offers a modern kitchen inspired by Hanseatic and local traditions, served in historic surroundings. A hidden treasure with its somewhat anonymous appearance. The restaurant can in principle fit up to about 200 guests, but the kitchen is very small, and expansion is not allowed by the cultural heritage authorities. This forces the restaurant to accept a relatively low number of patrons at a time – giving a peaceful atmosphere. A reservation is recommended.

* Bergen's latest and perhaps best (according to local newspaper BT) restaurant. Very ambitious but more reasonably priced than Colonialen and Cornelius. Located at Hotell Norge, Søtt+Salt leaves you with the option of 3,5 or 7 course meals. Reservations are recommended.

* Bergen's most traditional – and expensive – fish restaurant. Located in a building restored to its 18th century appearance, Enhjørningen is well reputed for its excellent food, served in classical manners. A reservation is required. Ask for a window table if possible, as you will have a beautiful view of Bergen harbor.

* A small and traditional gourmet restaurant.

* Partially situated in a medieval basement, Potetkjelleren offers gourmet food in very special surroundings. The place is often crowded and a reservation is required.

Drink
There is a great variety of bars, night clubs, concert venues etc. in Bergen. Night clubs are usually open from 11PM, but life never starts before 1AM. Bars opens at different hours, some can be open all day. No places are allowed to serve alcohol after 2:30AM, and the consumption of alcoholic beverages must cease at 3AM at the latest. Some places are required to close earlier. The establishments are only allowed to let people bring their drinks outside if they have been granted a special permit. A requirement to get this permit is that they have a confined space outdoors for their guests. All drinks must be indoors by 1AM. People go out all week, but Fridays and Saturdays are the best nights, Saturdays being the clear winner (most places will be a bit too crowded on Saturdays). Some clubs have a 2 for 1 policy on Wednesdays, and Sunday is usually the night for people in the industry.

Most places require that you are 20 years of age (look in the list for details) and that you can provide a valid ID, even if you are much older. Valid IDs are Norwegian bank cards, European standard driver's licenses and ID cards and passports.

Prices vary great from place to place, ask at the door if you need to know. In the weekends, there is usually a cover charge from kr. 50 to kr. 100 at night clubs.

Almost all night clubs and many bars have a dress code. The required attire varies; look in the list for more information (when the listing indicates "no dress code" normal, nice clothes are accepted). Supporter gear is generally not accepted even in sports pubs.

Remember that smoking in all indoor areas where people work is strictly prohibited by law in Norway. Most restaurants, bars, night clubs etc. will require you to leave if you try to smoke indoors.

Drinking in public is illegal. Emptying a can in front of a police officer on a Saturday night will earn you a kr. 2500 fine. If you stroll through a park a bit outside the city center on a sunny day you will still see a lot of people having a beer or a glass of wine with the picnic. The police usually won't mind as long as everything passes in an orderly fashion.

Central downtown

Stay safe

Bergen has, as the rest of Norway, a generally low crime rate. The most likely crimes for tourists to experience is car break-ins and bicycle theft. Pickpockets do also tend to be an increasing problem in the summer season, but it's still nothing like in larger cities in Europe. It is always a good idea to look after your belongings, this includes never leaving valuable objects visual in your car and locking your bike safely.

There are no particular unsafe areas in Bergen. The upper part of Nygårdsparken is, however, the hang-out place for drug addicts. They are usually completely harmless, but nevertheless not fun to be around. The risk of getting into trouble is very low, but families should be aware of the area. The lower part of Nygårdsparken is a beautiful place popular among the locals, but the upper part is, as previously stated, somewhat of a free haven for all the drug addicts in Bergen. The drug trafficking is out in the open, addicts are shooting up in plain sight, and the police is basically turning a blind eye to the whole area. Although considered harmless by most, there are frequent petty crimes in this area and it should be avoided by tourists.

Until 2009, prostitutes would solicit their services rather openly in the area around Nykirken, the northern parts of Strandgaten and C. Sundts gate. From January 2009 buying sex is illegal in Norway. This has had an effect on the visible prostitution.

People party hard on Friday and Saturday night, and hoards of drunk people will appear in the central areas from around midnight, singing, carousing, and just hanging around. Some foreigners may perceive this as threatening, but they are mostly harmless, even all-male groups chanting football songs. If approached, just smile and stay friendly.

There is an emergency and accident ward at Vestre Strømkai 19, close to the bus station. The ward is open all day all week, and provides examination and treatment in case of accidents and acute diseases. The ward is located together with a life crisis assistance center, a psychiatric emergency ward, a reception center for rape victims and a dental emergency ward. All services may be reached at +47 55 56 87 60. If you should be in need of immediate medical assistance, do however call 113.

The police station downtown is in Allehelgens gate 6, across the street from the old town hall.

Emergency numbers

* Police: 112
* Fire: 110
* Emergency Medical Services: 113

If you are unsure which number to call, 112 is the central for all rescue services and will put you in contact with the correct department.

For non-emergencies, the police is to be called on 02800.

The hearing impaired using a text telephone can reach the emergency services by dialing 1412.

Roadside assistance is provided by Falck (tel. 02222) and Viking (tel. 06000). AAA members may call NAF on 08505.

Contact

Area codes are no longer in use in Norwegian phone numbers. Phone numbers are normally eight digits, some special numbers may be three, four or five digits. In any case you should always dial all of the digits to make a call. The country code of Norway is 47. If you are calling abroad from a land line, dial 00 before your country code and phone number.

Cellular phone coverage is very good throughout the city. Three different networks are available, Telenor, Talia and Ice. Check with your local operator to find out which one is the cheaper for you. The difference is usually not big. Norway, like most of Europe, uses GSM 900 and 1800, which means that some cell phones from USA, Canada and countries in Asia will not work. For those in need of mobile data lines, both HSDPA/3G/UMTS, EDGE and GPRS coverage is good on both the Telenor and NetCom networks. Network Norway only provides EDGE and GPRS.

There are no telephone centers in the city, and only a very few phone booths. Most hotels have phones in every room, but international calls from these phones are usually very expensive. There are some calling cards available, this is probably the cheapest way to phone home. Look for Lebara stickers in kiosks.

Many cafes and restaurants have free Wi-Fi for their patrons. Free Wi-Fi is also available at Bergen Public Library, Strømgaten 6 (by the bus station). Most large hotels do also have wireless Internet access, however access at a hotel is usually pricy.

Cope

Getting around by foot is easy, and free maps are available everywhere. If you need a better map, you should buy one of Bergens Tidende's maps Bergens Tidende is a local newspaper. Maps are sold from their reception in Krinkelkroken 1, close to the blue stone, and in various bookstores. The city map costs kr. 50.

VISA and MasterCard are normally accepted in any restaurant, taxi, store, some kiosks and McDonald's. Many places, American Express, JCB and Diners Club are also accepted. ATMs accept all major credit and debit cards and are available in English language. The currency is Norwegian kroner (crowns), but euros may also be accepted at some tourist destinations (you should, however, avoid paying in euros as the exchange rates may be stiff). Currency exchange is available in all banks. Exchange is usually associated with an incredible fee, so you should use your credit card or withdraw cash from an ATM unless you have a good reason not to.

The regular opening hours for grocery stores are 8AM-9PM on weekdays. Some stores open earlier and close later. Other shops usually have shorter hours, except those in the shopping centers. Almost all shops, including grocery stores, close earlier on Saturdays and are closed on Sundays and public holidays. Kiosks such as Narvesen, 7-Eleven and Deli de Luca are open.

There are some smaller grocery stores open on Sundays and public holidays. This includes Kiwi at Nedre Korskirkeallmenningen 2 (by the Bergen YMCA and the Church of the Cross), Bunnpris (across the street from Kiwi) and Rimi at Nygårdsgaten 6.

The city's main post office is conveniently located in the Xhibition shopping center, on 1st floor. Some grocery stores offers limited postal services, and stamps are available from most book stores and kiosks. Post boxes are either red or yellow and located all over town. Yellow boxes are only for local mail, if unsure use the red box. All post boxes, post offices and grocery stores offering postal services are marked with the emblem of the Norwegian postal service, a stylized red or silver horn, and the word "Posten". For more information on the postal service and to locate post offices and post boxes, see the web site of Norway Post 

The local tap water is fresh, tasty and rich in minerals from the surrounding mountains, and safe to drink.

Public toilets are available for a small fee at shopping centres and at Torget and Bryggen.

A number of countries have consulates in Bergen. For a full list of embassies and consulates in Norway, see the web site of the department of foreign affairs 

Most shops don't handle change manually. A grey machine by the till accepts your change in the top (and counts it for the assistant) and provides your change in a hopper at the bottom. Don't feed a large number of coins in at once : put them in one at a time or it may jam.
