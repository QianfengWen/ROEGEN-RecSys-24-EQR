Florianopolis (Portuguese: Florianópolis) is the capital of the Brazilian state of . Half of the city is on the mainland of while the other half is on the . It has some of Brazil's most beautiful beaches.

Understand
It is formed by an ocean island of 436 km² (54 km by 18 km) and a small peninsula on the mainland, with 1210 km². It is situated in southern Brazil between the parallels 27 20' and 27 51' latitude south and between the meridians 48 20' and 48 35' longitude west. Three bridges link the island to the continent, and after decades of repairs, Hercílio Luz Bridge, a landmark of the city, has re-opened to both pedestrian and car traffic as of 14 September 2020.

Recently, Florianopolis has become one of the most popular destinations in Brazil for people who are looking for superb beaches, beautiful scenery, interesting culture, and friendly people. It has also experienced a real estate boom, with Brazilians looking for a better quality of life away from the chaos of the big cities, especially from the states of São Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul. The city proper currently has an estimated population of 420,000 people. The Greater Florianopolis Metro area is home to about 1 million people.

The northern beach resorts Jurerê, Daniela, Canasvieiras, Brava, and Ingleses get very busy during the summer and there are plenty of hotels, restaurants, and other conveniences for the tourist. Eastern beaches, like Joaquina, Mole, and Moçambique are among the best surfing beaches and are popular with young people. Beaches heading south include Campeche, Armação, and Morro das Pedras, which are all very beautiful and also good for surfing. Isolated and unspoiled beaches, like Lagoinha, do Leste, and Naufragados can be found at the southern end of the island and can only be reached by trail. Lagoa da Conceição is a famous natural attraction, and the centerpiece of the island; it is relatively shallow, with high winds making it a world-class location for windsurfing. Peri Lagoon is quieter on the other hand, and great for nature walks. 

The city of Florianopolis is quite modern, with large shopping malls, chains, high-end restaurants, and many glamorous bars and nightclubs. The highway system serving the city is very good.
