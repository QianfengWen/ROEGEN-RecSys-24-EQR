History

Delhi is said to be one of the oldest existing cities in the world, along with and . Legend estimates it to be over 5,000 years old. Over the millennia, Delhi is said to have been built and destroyed 11 times. The oldest alleged incarnation of the city shows up in the Indian mythological epic Mahabharata as Indraprastha.

*Qila Rai Pithora – This dates back to the 10th century A.D. as per available historical records. Also known as Rai Pithora, this city was the capital during the reign of Prithviraj Chauhan, the local hero famous for his first defeating, before finally losing to, the marauding invaders from central Asia (Muhammad Ghori in particular). Chauhan's ancestors are said to have captured the city from the Tomar Rajputs who were credited with founding Delhi. Anangpal, a Tomar ruler possibly created the first known regular fort here called 'Lal Kot', which was taken over by Prithviraj and the city extended. Some of the ruins of the fort ramparts are still visible around Qutab Minar and Mehrauli.

*Mehrauli – Muhammad Ghori managed to defeat Prithviraj Chauhan in battle in 1192. Ghori left his slave Qutub-ud-din Aibak as his viceroy, who in turn captured Delhi the subsequent year. After Ghori's death in 1206, Aibak proclaimed himself the ruler of Delhi and founded the slave dynasty. Qutb-ud-din contributed significantly in terms of architecture by getting Mehrauli built. His most prominent contribution is the starting of Qutab Minar. This 72.5 m tall tower was built across three generations and finally completed in 1220AD. A visitor to the Qutab Minar could also see the mausoleum of Kaki, Shamsi Talao and some other mosques. The Slave dynasty ruled until 1290, among them was Razia Sultan who ruled for just three years, but became a historic figure for being the first empress in India.

*Siri - Qutubuddin Aibaq's 'Slave Dynasty' was followed by the line of Khilji (or Khalji) rulers. The most prominent among the six rulers was Allauddin who extended the kingdom to the south of Narmada and also established the city of 'Siri'. Among some of the remaining ruins, is part of the Siri Fort in the greater Hauz Khas area. The madrasa at Hauz Khas was constructed during Allauddin's reign and bears the stamp of West Asian architecture. Hauz Khas is more often visited today for the chic botiques and restaurants.

*Tughlakabad - Exactly as it happens during the fall of a lineage of kings, after the Khilji's there was administrative chaos for sometime as the last Khilji ruler was slain by Nasruddin Mohammed. Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq (a Turk governor) invaded Delhi in the 1320s, started the Tughlaq dynasty, and founded the city of , the ruins of which still remain. His descendant Muhammad Bin Tughlaq raised the fort walls, created another city called Jahapanah (which enclosed the area between Siri and Qila Rai Pithora). Tughlakabad continued, however, to be the main capital city. Muhammad Bin Tughlaq is also known as the mad king for wanting to move the capital from Delhi to Daulatabad (now near Aurangabad in Maharashtra) and making the entire population travel, only to return in a few years because of water shortage in the new town. 

*Firozabad - Muhammad Bin Tughlaq's son, Firoze created the next city which was called Firozabad or Firoze Shah Kotla. There still are some ruins which are visible around the cricket stadium by the same name. The city was a enclosed a large area, and contained many palaces, mosques, pillared halls, and multi-floored water tank. Firoze Shah also planted a 1500 year old Ashokan Pillar on top of the palace. This pillar was originally planted in Meerut by Samrat Ashok.Feroze Shah, also repaired many of the older construction in Delhi including Ghori's tomb, Qutub Minar,Suraj Kund and Hauz Khas. He, himself, was buried inside a lofty tomb in Hauz Khas. Quite like earlier, after Feroze Shah's death, the sultnate became unstable and weak, and was invaded by Taimur the Lame (from Samarkhand) who created havoc in the city by looting, killing, raping and plundering. The Sayyids and Lodhis who ruled Delhi after the Tughlaq's paid more attention to re-establishing miltiary and political stability to the kingdom. The only relevant architecture visible from this period are the tombs at Lodhi Gardens. The last of the Lodhi's was defeated by Babur in the first battle of Panipat. Babur then proceeded to establish the Mughal dynasty.

*Shergarh - Babur's son Humayun ruled the kingdom for a few years only to be defeated by Sher Shah Suri (1540), who established the new city Shergarh (on the ruins of Dinpanah, built by Humayun) towards the north and near the river. Shergarh is what you see at today, near the Delhi zoo. After Humayun came back to power, he completed the construction and proceeded to rule from Shergarh.

*Shahjahanabad - the next of the Mughal emperors chose to move away from Delhi and established Agra as the capital of their kingdom. Shahjahan (Humayun's great-grandson) returned to Delhi and established Shahjahanabad. This included the Jama Masjid, the Red Fort and all that in enclosed within the walls of Old Delhi. This wall is still around in many parts and three of the six gates (Delhi gate, Lahori Gate, Turkman Gate, Ajmeri Gate, Kashmiri Gate, Mori Gate)to Delhi still exist. Kashmiri Gate was reconstructed and widened by the British after the 1857 revolt. 

*Lutyen's New Delhi - The final city as you see today expanded from what Sir Edwin Lutyens. 

The population of Delhi is a heterogeneous mix of people originally belonging to different parts of North India and beyond. Among the prominent North Indian communities are the Punjabis. Delhi also has a prominent South Indian Community, primarily in areas like RK Puram, Mayur Vihar and Munirka. A Bengali Settlement, the Chittaranjan Park in south Delhi is the Mini Calcutta of Delhi. Quality education also draws students from different states, making up one of the most diverse student populations in the country.

Orientation

Like the rest of the Gangetic Plains, Delhi is as flat as a pancake. The only geographical features of any significance are the river Yamuna, which flows down the eastern side of the city, and the Aravalli Hills which form a wide but low arc across the west. On the west bank is the crowded and congested Old (Central) Delhi and, to the southwest, the broad, tree-lined avenues of New Delhi, built by the British to rule their empire. The rest is an endless low-rise sprawl of suburbia and slums, with southwestern Delhi (nearer to New Delhi) generally somewhat wealthier. Delhi, the capital of India, is a place with a rich history and is made up of many forts, monuments and mosques. Delhi is known as one of the best places to visit in India. There are so many places to see in Delhi,Delhi offers a beautiful a blend of vibrant cultures mixed with modernity which is why tourists will always feel like at home in Delhi. Delhi is a city that offers everything for all. It is a city full of hearts, and you will find some wonderful and vibrant people in it. A Holiday in Delhi will let you experience the two sides of the city, one that has been preserving its culture and heritage and the other which thrive to touch the sky with its modern skyscrapers. The markets of Delhi are one of the must-visit places as they are known for their cheap price and decent quality. Sarojini Nagar market and Chandni Chowk markets witness huge footfall everyday of people looking for cheap deals on their shopping spree. 

New Delhi

The capital of India built by the British. It also houses few of the most famous hotels you can find in India like:
 The Leela Ambience
 The Grand 
 jüSTa Hotels & Resorts

South Delhi

South Delhi is a more affluent area and is the location of many upscale hotels, shopping malls, quaint guesthouses and several prominent art galleries. It also includes the Qutab Minar, a major tourist attraction. The area is easy to get around via taxi/car and is served by 3 metro lines.

Old Delhi

The capital during the Mughal period.

North Delhi

This area includes many buildings developed during British rule. Majnu Ka Tilla is a Tibetan settlement in the area.

Climate

The shoulder seasons (Feb-Mar and Oct-Nov) are the best times to visit, with temperatures in the 20-30&deg;C range (68-86&deg;F). From April to June, temperatures are scorchingly hot (over 40&deg;C is common) and, with every air-conditioner running at full blast, the city's creaking power and water infrastructure is strained to the breaking point and beyond. Monsoon rains deluge the city from July to September, flooding roads on a regular basis and bringing traffic to a standstill. In winter, especially December and January, temperatures can dip to near-zero which can feel a lot colder because central heating is largely unknown and homes are usually designed with a view to keep cool in the summers rather than warm in the winters. In addition the city is blanketed in thick fog, causing numerous flight cancellations and train delays.

Beware

Probably the worst way to get introduced to India for the first time visitor would be to fly into Delhi on one of those packed red-eye flights arriving at 1am, and take a random taxi from airport into a hotel in a backpacking district, and follow the taxi driver hotel suggestions once you have heard that your hotel has been closed/burned a few days ago. This city is difficult to handle even for seasoned travelers, and it is hard to shake off the feeling that it is one big dirty noisy dump where everyone tries to rip you off.

Generally for a first time visitor you will get a better experience of India if you initially fly to Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore or Kolkata (then you can continue to Delhi). However if you must fly to Delhi:

* Book a flight arriving during daytime, preferably afternoon (morning and evening traffic is very bad). A huge number of flights, mostly from Middle East, are arriving in the late night, and the airport is crowded.
 
* For the first night book a hotel in advance in the same price range you'd book a hotel in your own country. Yes, good hotels in India could be very cheap, but it is hit and miss. Next day you can walk around and move to a different hotel, or negotiate a price in your hotel down (this is why you only need to book one night).

* Ask the hotel to pick you up from the airport. You will pay 2x-4x more than the normal taxi fare would be, but you will save yourself lots of hassle as the driver will wait for you in arrival area (and yes, they will still wait even if your flight is 4hr late) - and, being the first time in India, it is unlikely you'd get a normal taxi fare anyway. Trying to get Uber at Indian airport also is not a good idea, as finding your driver is always a major hassle which requires several calls - too many cars, and too many people.

Note that those items mostly apply to Delhi only. Other Indian airports receive significantly less international traffic and are less crowded, and Delhi seem to be the only major city in India which still doesn't have a proper concept of taxi regulations, and has such a huge abundance of hotels which shouldn't even be allowed to open doors.

Get in

By plane

Indira Gandhi International Airport, (IGI, ) located in the south-west of the city, is the arrival point for many visitors into Delhi. Once notoriously bad, the airport has been transformed into a thoroughly modern facility and is one the best airports in the world. There are several security checkpoints in the airport and you may have to show your boarding pass and passport a dozen times before boarding the plane. When leaving Delhi from the International terminal, you should show up 3 hours before your flight is scheduled. For domestic flights, 2 hours should be enough, depending on whether or not you must wait in the queues to check luggage. While sometimes time-consuming, the process is smooth, and the new terminal's shops and restaurants are sensibly located at the gate area, not before security. However, if you wish to change Rupees back into foreign currency, you must do this before clearing security. 

During the winter, Delhi often experiences dense fog and visibility is reduced considerably, making it difficult for flights to land and take off. Both international and domestic flights are often diverted, cancelled, or delayed.

Delhi Airport has three operational terminals:

* Terminal 1C/1D, also known as "Palam Airport" or "Domestic", is used only by low-cost carriers IndiGo, GoAir and SpiceJet. Flights arrive at Terminal 1C but depart from terminal 1D.
* Terminal 2 is only in use during the Haj pilgrimage for flights to and .
* Terminal 3, the enormous main terminal, is used by all international flights and all full-service domestic carriers which include Jet Airways, Air India, AirAsia India and Vistara.

A free shuttle bus operates between the terminals every 20 minutes; however, the shuttle is only free for arriving passengers with onward connecting tickets in the other terminal. Alternatively, public city bus #4 (₹25) operates the same route and does not require a flight ticket. While the terminals share the same runways, connecting between the two requires a massive detour via a nearby highway, so allow up to 20 minutes to make the transfer. 

To travel between the airport and the city:

* Delhi Airport Metro Express is a train line that operates between New Delhi Metro Station and Dwarka Sector 21, with a stop at the airport Terminal 3. See the website for the schedule. The journey to New Delhi Metro Station is fast and comfortable and takes 20 minutes and costs ₹60. From the railway station, you can transfer to the Metro (crossing the city street to reach the station).

* Delhi Transport Corporation and EATS (Ex Serviceman's Airlink Transport Service) operate buses between the airport and the city 24 hours per day. Travel time is approximately 50 minutes and the cost is ₹50 per adult, ₹25 per child below 12 years, ₹25 for heavy luggage. Buses run to ISBT (Inter State Bus Terminal) near Kashmiri Gate, Connaught Place, Delhi Train Station and many hotels in the city centre, departing from both airport terminals every 60 minutes from 10AM-11:10PM. Tickets can be bought and a fixed seat can be booked at a desk in the Arrivals Hall. 

* For booking Taxis from the airport, you have a variety of options including the yellow prepaid taxi booths operated by the Delhi Police. There is one located directly outside of the airport and one located near the rental car counters to the right of the exit doors. You may be approached by touts offering pre-paid taxis; just ignore them as there have been safety incidents reported. There are 5-6 radio taxi companies operating taxis in Delhi and they are cleaner and more reliable than the prepaid taxis. They are safer as they are GPS-monitored at all times. You can find the booths of three radio taxi companies as you exit the terminal, namely Owic Car Rental Meru Cabs EasyCabs and MegaCabs Other reputed taxi companies in Delhi are Ola Uber and TaxiForSure which have to be booked using their Android app. A prepaid taxi to the city center will cost you more than a radio taxi. Ignore any requests by the driver for additional payment. There is no practice of tipping taxi drivers anywhere in India. When you reach your destination, take your baggage first, then give the driver the receipt/pay the driver(in the case of radio taxis) and walk away without further discussion. Note that taxis routinely get stuck in traffic during rush-hour, but the journey to the city center is much quicker at night or early morning.

* Prearranged pick-ups are also available from most hotels. The cost may be double the charge from the prepaid taxi booths, but you will have someone waiting for you at the airport with your name on a sign and you won't have to wait in the taxi queue.

* State run and private operators bus normally used by people working in and around airport for daily commute. Its the cheapest way to travel from airport to anywhere in the city. When you exit airport, head straight to pillar no. 18 on left side, from where you can catch DTC express buses. If you walk 5 more minutes in same direction (or just ask anyone), you can catch a bus for INR 5 to Mahipalpur and then bus to anywhere in Delhi and Gurgaon.

By Car

Many online car services are now extensively serving major cities in India like WE-CABS : CABS IN DELHI Cabs24x7 Amy CAB Uber Japji travel and My Tempo Traveller http:// mytempotraveller.com UberX (the low-cost version) are in fact more reliable, cheaper, and more pleasant than dealing with (and haggling with) unscrupulous / overeager / bothersome taxi drivers or autorickshaw drivers. You can get in by cabs and this is the safest way to get in if you want to avoid bus services.

By bus

Buses arrive from and in (36 hr+) and virtually every city in India. Although not as comfortable as the trains, buses are the only choice for some destinations, mainly those in the mountains.

Delhi has a confusing slew of inter-state bus termini (ISBT), which all have two names. The Delhi Transport Corporation is the major operator, but every state also runs its own buses and there are some private operators.

* Kashmere Gate ISBT (aka Maharana Pratap), Metro Kashmere Gate, Line 1/2. This is "the" ISBT and the largest of the lot. Buses to points north, including .

* Sarai Kale Khan ISBT (aka Vir Hakikat Rai), next to Hazrat Nizamuddin railway station. Buses to points south.

* Anand Vihar ISBT (aka Swami Vivekanand), on the east bank of Yamuna. Buses to points east.

* Bikaner House, at Pandara Road, India Gate (Central Delhi) provides hourly air-conditioned Volvo buses to cities of Rajasthan (State famous for royal fortified desert-towns) - Jaipur (State-Capital), Udaipur (Lake City), Jodhpur etc. Bus Stop is uncrowded, well-maintained and ideal for luxurious travelling.

* Mandi House, at Barakhamba Road, near India Gate (Central Delhi) provides hourly air-conditioned Volvo buses to hill-stations of Himachal Pradesh (State famous for Himalayan panoramas) - Shimla (State-Capital), Manali (North-India's honeymoon destination), Dharamsala (Capital-in-exile of Tibetans) etc. Bus Stop is uncrowded, well-maintained and ideal for luxurious travelling.

* Majnu ka Tilla Tibetan colony, a short rickshaw ride from Metro Vidhan Sabha. Buses to .

By train

Trains arrive at one of four main stations: Delhi Junction, also called Old Delhi or Purani Dilli; the second at New Delhi which lies in Central Delhi; Hazrat Nizamuddin a few kilometers to the south; and the upcoming Anand Vihar station to the east (very few trains use Delhi Sarai Rohilla or Delhi Cantt stations). Delhi Junction and New Delhi Railway Station are now conveniently connected by Metro Line 2, just minutes apart, while Anand Vihar is served by Line 3. It will take about 40 min-1 hr to travel from the New Delhi Railway Station to the airport by car, depending on traffic.

A ticket office open to all is on the road to Connaught Place with longer hours. It often has waiting times not much longer than at the tourist booking office. You will need to know the number or name of the train you want to take. Easiest of all, though, is to book online through the Indian Railways booking website (Note, however, that you are required to have both an e-mail address AND a mobile phone number that is registered within India in order to access the booking area of the site.)

Once you have purchased a ticket either at the ticket office or online prior to the trip, all you need to do is go to the rail car labeled with your class of service purchased. You can either get on and sit in the first available seat or often times for higher classes of service, they will post a passenger list on the car when it stops. Look for your name and go to the assigned car, cabin and seat. There is never a need to get a boarding pass so if anyone comes out of the crowd to tell you that, don't listen to them; it is a scam. If you're brave, you can simply purchase a general 2nd class ticket and then get on any car where there is availability. The conductor will come by and check your tickets after the train starts moving. If you are in a higher fare class than you are ticketed for, all you have to do is simply pay the difference in fare to the conductor. The only risk here is that the train could be full and you could be stuck in the lowest fare class which can be very crowded with little room to sit.

New Delhi Railway Station

The main entrance to New Delhi Railway Station (code NDLS) is located just outside of Paharganj, also known as the backpacker ghetto. The Delhi Metro now connects directly here, but the metro exits are at the Ajmeri Gate (second entrance) side near platform 16. You can also take prepaid rickshaws and taxis from the plaza outside the main entrance.

The station is large, crowded, confusing and packed with touts. Allow one hour to find your train the first time you visit. Don't trust the electronic display boards, which often show incorrect information. Instead listen to the announcements and ask multiple people in uniform (policemen) until you find your train. However, anyone who approaches you spontaneously should be completely ignored, including people who claim they work for the railway. Use one of the porters (in orange red uniforms with metallic arms badges) to find your train and carry your luggage, in exchange for a tip.

A tourist ticket office called the International Tourist Bureau is open 24 hours upstairs of, but still within, the main New Delhi railway station on Platform No.1 (on the side away from the metro). Note that it is only for foreign tourists, so you must have a tourist visa (i.e. student and working visas are not acceptable). Non-resident Indians can also book their tickets through this office. Bring your passport and cash or traveller's cheques in U.S. dollars, British Pounds or Euros. If you wish to pay in Indian Rupees you theoretically must show an official exchange certificate (from India, not valid if you changed in another country) or an ATM receipt. All ticket bookings require exact change, as like everywhere in India the office has little to no change. If you don't have exact change, it's possible after booking to go down to the food stores, buy food to get change, then return and pick up your ticket. To get a ticket, first get a form from the centre of the room and fill it out. Then go to the information desk near the entrance. There, have the clerk check the availability of the train(s) you desire, and fill out your form accordingly. Then line up at one of the two u-shaped lines of chairs for the reservation desks. If you need a bathroom during this lengthy process, there is a relatively clean male and female toilet just outside on the verandah through the side door (the door you didn't enter through). Even once inside, there are still touts around looking to make a quick buck on those who are unfamiliar with the process. Do not leave the International Tourist Bureau with a stranger.

Do not trust strangers who appear out of the crowd to help you; ignore them. Always ask for assistance at the enquiry counter or policemen (in uniform). If crossing over to other platforms from the Paharganj side, beware of people asking for your train ticket whilst going through security to cross the bridge. You do not need to show your ticket to cross the bridge despite what they may say. If a man with a pen appears as you approach, ignore him.

If you have a long wait for your train and need somewhere safe and peaceful, the IRCTC has an executive lounge, which can be found between the main entrance (Ajmeri Gate side) and the stairway up to platform 16, just after security. It is clean, safe and air-conditioned; the staff are helpful. The cost is INR150 for two hours. Meals are extra. 

New Delhi Railway Station also has a pre-paid taxi booth run by Delhi Police. If you are arriving at the station, and want to take a taxi, head to the Delhi Police pre-paid taxi booth. Unfortunately, this booth is at the extreme far north end (about 50 meters from the station main exit) of the taxi parking and you will encounter touts claiming to provide prepaid taxi; just ignore them and find the pre-paid taxi booth run by the Delhi Police which are safe and least expensive. Taxi fare from New Delhi Railway Staion to the Airport should cost you about 400 Rupees.

A common scam is for a tout to approach you and tell you your train is canceled but you may book the next train at the official tourist office (typically in Connaught Square). Of course, this isn't an official office, just a travel agency that will tell you the next train is booked and try to rent you a taxi at a very expensive price.

Delhi Railway Station

Formally Delhi Junction (code DLI), but best referred to as "Old" Delhi Station for clarity. Like New Delhi RS, this station is huge and confusing. The platforms are not in linear order, with some hidden in the west and east wings of the stations. The railway station is served by Metro Line 2 Chandni Chowk station, with an entrance just outside at the east end of the station and also just over the main road outside (last metro at about 23:30). If taking an Auto Rickshaw from here, the prepaid desk will often try and charge you as much as three times the actual price quoted on the official price guide displayed clearly in their window - bargaining is sadly often cheaper.

Hazrat Nizamuddin

Hazrat Nizamuddin (code NZM) is the departure point of many trains heading south. Practically speaking, the only way to get here is by taxi or car. The budget alternative is to take a bus to the Sarai Kale Khan Inter State Bus Terminal (ISBT) on the ring road and then walk over to the station (400 m). It's the least chaotic of the Big Three, but still pretty big and poorly signposted; listen to the announcements to figure out your train. The station has a pretty good food court that sells inexpensive, hygienic takeaway snacks including sandwiches and samosas.

If you have some time to kill, pay a visit to Humayun's Tomb, which is so close to the station that you can hear the announcements from inside — although it's a long, circuitous walk from the station to the entrance.

Anand Vihar

Anand Vihar Terminal (code ANVT) is Delhi's newest station, located well to the east of the city near . Repeatedly delayed, the station finally opened in December 2009 and will gradually take over all east-bound services. The station can be reached by Delhi Metro Line 3. Anand Vihar Terminal is just opposite to Anand Vihar Interstate Bus Terminal (ISBT).

Get around

Getting around Delhi is always an adventure. Traffic is, by and large, horribly congested and many drivers will think nothing of quoting ten times the going price to a tourist. Use the prices below as broad guidelines, agree on prices before setting off. Best way to travel is via metro, where there are separate cabins for women (that prove to be very useful during rush hour). Metro is clean, efficient, and typically ridden by relatively affluent middle-class students or commuters en route to/from work; there is almost nowhere in the city that you cannot get to by metro.

Please note that in each station, you will undergo a security check with a metal detector and a scanning machine.

By metro

The fast-growing Delhi Metro network provides a cheap, quick, hassle-free and air-conditioned way of zipping around the city. The following lines are open:

* Red Line: Dilshad Garden - Rithala
* Yellow Line: Jahangirpuri - HUDA City Centre, Gurgaon
* Blue Line: Dwarka Sector 21 - Vaishali/ - Noida City Centre
* Green Line: Inderlok - Mundka
* Violet Line: ITO - Badarpur Border
* Airport Express: New Delhi Railway Station - Airport - Dwarka 

Fares range from ₹10-60 (₹100 for the airport express), depending on distance. To use the system, either buy a smart card (₹200, includes ₹150 of credit) and load it with credit or buy a token each time you want to ride the metro. There can be long queues of as much as 30 minutes to buy tokens, so the smart card is usually the better bet, even if it winds up costing a bit more. Tokens can be used only from the station they are bought, so you can't buy two and use the second to return home. The tokens or the smart card are needed to both enter and exit the system. There is also a "Tourist Card" allowing unlimited use for ₹200 (1 day) or ₹500 (3 days), but it's highly unlikely that you'll travel enough to make this pay off.

Yellow line, in particular, is useful for getting to the Old Delhi (Chandni Chowk, Jama Masjid) and New Delhi railway stations, the ISBT bus terminal, the backpacker ghetto of Paharganj, Hauz Khas and Qutub Minar. Line 3 is also handy for visiting Akshardham and accessing the western parts of Paharganj through RK Ashram Marg station.
 
Metro stations all use the new, official, Indianized names, so Connaught Place is "Rajiv Chowk", Old Delhi Railway Station is "Chandni Chowk" and ISBT is "Kashmere Gate".

The first car of all trains is reserved to women, so, is totally safe and comfortable to travel with the metro lines also for a woman by herself.

Please be advised that it's strictly prohibited to carry alcohol items (even being bought in duty-free in the country of origin) to the Delhi Metro, except airport express line. You can be denied entering the station on security check. Also lighters and matches are confiscated by security staff. 
By local train

There are limited commuter services on Delhi's railways, but the facilities are a far cry from the user-friendly Metro and stations. For the most part, train stations are inconveniently located. There is no passenger service on the Delhi Ring Railroad outside rush hour.

Please note that the Indian Railways website does not accept most foreign credit cards, however American Express cards are accepted. Indian railways tickets can be bought from an agency called Cleartrip using other credit cards.

By bus

All parts of Delhi are well connected by buses and with tickets ranging from Rs 5-15 they are very cheap, but they are also quite crowded most of the time. The red coloured buses are air-conditioned and the green coloured are not. As bus stops do not have bus routes written properly, it can be difficult to find your way. Asking other people at the bus stop is often the best way to find out about bus routes to your destination. However, the buses are pretty frequent, running every 15-20 min or so on most routes. There are two kinds of buses in Delhi:

*Government run DTC buses (red and green coloured with big windows)
*Privately run cluster buses (orange coloured)

If you have a choice, please go for a DTC bus. They will stop less frequently and will generally be less crowded too. Note that many buses, DTC ones too, will stop pretty much anywhere if there are enough people getting on or off.

Board buses at the back and pay the ticket seller sitting right next to the door. Be sure to hang onto your tickets, as ticket checks are fairly frequent. Some seats on the left side of the bus may be reserved for women and the handicapped. When it's time to disembark, move to the front of the bus. As you might expect, all these guidelines are regularly ignored when buses are very crowded.

Hop on Hop off

 Hop On Hop Off (HOHO) bus service is operated by Delhi Tourism. (Helpline) ☎ +91 11 4094 0000. A fleet of air conditioned low floored buses follow a pre-defined set of stops around the city and passengers can hop off the bus, see the place at one's own convenience and hop on the next bus. Each bus is staffed with a knowledgeable English speaking guide. The service does not operate on Mondays. Best to go on Saturdays and Sundays when there is little traffic.

By taxi

Delhi is well-serviced by smartphone-app based cab-service providers. Popular services are Ola, Uber and Meru. There are other cab service providers as well. The advantage of using the app based services is that you do not have to negotiate with the driver in advance, and your cab ride is tracked, and the receipt emailed to you. All the new cab service companies accept payments from digital wallets, so haggling over the right change is also not a problem. The cabs you will see near tourist spots will be old. For outstation travel you may take taxi from GetMeCab, taxi trip, mytaxi etc. they offer options to book online, via phone call, pay online or in cash to give all kind of convenience.

Most Delhi taxis are old but reliable CNG-run Ambassadors or Omnis in distinctive black-and-yellow livery and a green stripe. The hired family car of choice is usually a Toyota Innova or Chevrolet Tavera. While all are equipped with meters and should cost ₹15 for the first km ₹8.50 per km, the meters are often rigged and it's better to agree on the price in advance. Most trips around the city should be ₹200-500, while a trip to the airport would be higher, depending on starting location. An eight-hour charter should cost around ₹1,500, and a tip is expected if the driver is helpful. The prices would also depends upon the vehicle size too. Note that black and yellow taxis are not air-conditioned. Even if they do have air conditioning, you will be charged extra (and the rates are up to the driver, so bargain hard).

The death knell of the Ambassador was rung in December 2006, when modern radio taxi services were launched. At ₹20/km, they're more the list price of the competition, but they use modern vehicles with air-conditioning and GPS and can be dialed 24 hr/day. The flag fare is ₹20, and the fare increases by ₹5 for every 250m after the first km. If you need an SUV, you need to inform the company in advance, but the fare remains the same. Night charges (25% extra) apply between 11pm to 5am. Book up to a few hours in advance. Many corporates rely on these cabs for their daily commute and they may be booked during office hours. Tipping is not expected. After booking, you will receive an SMS with the car license plate number, and the driver's name and mobile number. Usually the driver will call you and inform you that he's arrived. Most drivers speak English, but at a very basic level, so use short phrases.

You shouldn't take non-official taxis, sometimes they take you to a wrong hotel, or to a "tourist information centre", and try to sell you overpriced things.

By auto rickshaws

Auto rickshaws (also called three-wheeled scooters, tuk-tuks or simply autos) are good for shorter trips. Always in a distinctive yellow-and-green livery, auto rickshaws are three-wheeled partially enclosed contraptions (no doors!) that run on CNG and can seat three people in the back. In general, they are much cheaper than taxis and can be hailed from the street. Although by law the rickshaw drivers should charge according to the meter in their vehicle (₹25 for the first two kms, ₹8/km after), this rate is unrealistically low and they will almost always try to for price. Try to negotiate a price before entering the vehicle. As rules of thumb, expect even the shortest journey to cost ₹30-40 regardless of the meter, but you should never need to pay over ₹150 for any trip within the city. If you're overquoted, don't be afraid to walk away. It's usually easy to find another one soon, usually with a driver who won't rip you off.

If you have any trouble with drivers, go to any of the numerous tourist police stations in the city center and they will give you a complaint slip which will result in a ₹500 fine for the auto driver. There should also be a telephone number written on the vehicle to call in case of any complaint.

There are a number of "Pre-paid" auto stands run by the Police. Tell them where you want to go and pay them upfront. The charge will include ₹5 for the service. You then take the coupon and stand outside where a policeman will direct you to the next available Auto. When your journey is completed you hand the coupon to the auto driver and that's it. Nothing more to pay (despite what they may say).

By cycle rickshaws

Cycle rickshaws are three-wheeled, pedal-powered rickshaws with seats in the back to seat passengers and a driver in the front. They are good for short distances, or places which are too far to walk but too short for taking a bus/taxi/auto rickshaw. Cycle rickshaws don't use meters, so establish a price before getting on. ₹20-50 is reasonable for most journeys of a few km.

Cycle rickshaws are best to use in Old Delhi to visit the intricate galis (walkways) and to enjoy the smells and sounds of the city.

On foot

Much of Delhi is quite pedestrian-hostile. Distances are long, road signage is poor, and in the more tourist oriented areas, you'll be constantly accosted by beggars and touts. Crossing roads often involves wading across multiple lanes of heavy traffic. Try your best to move in a predictable straight line, so vehicles can weave around you. (Better yet, latch onto a group of locals and cross in their shadow.) If you really want to walk around, these places would be good:

* Walk from Rashtrapati Bhavan (President's house) to India Gate on the Rajpath (a walk of close to 3-4 km).

* Walk from Jama Masjid to Red Fort in the Chandni Chowk area.

* Far South Delhi go walk about in the forest. Try starting from south of Indian Institute of Technology through Sanjay Van to Qutub Minar. Note however that Sanjay Van is not always safe, and it is advisable to go there in a group, preferably during daylight hours. 

* South Delhi-Green Park-Hauz Khas Village, then to the Hauz Khas ruined madrasa, offers a newer shopping area, an up-market arts village, old ruins, and some quality gardens.

By car
Hiring a car is not a good option for most foreigners as most Delhiites have no sense of road rules. It is much easier to hire a car and a driver to get around. Yet if you are adventuruosus you may hire a car and drive yourself. One rule to be careful about is the odd even rule. Due to high levels of pollution the Delhi Government has decided to impose a car rationing policy in which only even cars are allowed to ply on even days and vice versa for odd. This rule is introduced for a stretch of 15 days. A hefty fine of ₹2000 is enforced on violators. Read local newspaper and pay attention to the numerous hoardings around the city publicising the rule. It is well publicised and you are sure to hear of it when it is being enforced.

Red Fort

The Red Fort (Lal Qila) is one of Delhi's top tourist sights. A brilliant red sandstone fort built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan (who also built 's Taj Mahal) as his ruling palace. Completed in 1648, the years since have not treated the buildings kindly: the rooms have long since been stripped of all objects, the marble inlays are long gone and quite a few buildings are off limits. Still, the scale remains imposing and the gardens are kept lush and green even in midwinter. Major buildings within include:

* Chatta Chowk, (Covered Bazaar). True to the name, this is a covered bazaar between the gate and the fort itself, now filled with souvenir hawkers.

* Diwan-i-Am, (Hall of Public Audience). This building separates the outer court from the inner court, and has a marble platform for the emperor's throne.

* Hayat Baksh Bagh, (Life-Bestowing Gardens). Once a grand garden of full of fountains and streams, now sadly all dry — only dry channels and acres of green grass remain.

* Diwan-i-Khas, (Hall of Private Audience). Built completely of marble, this is where the emperor received special visitors.

* Khas Mahal, (Private Palace), The Emperor's main residence. The octagonal Mussaman Burj tower looks out toward the Yamuna River, and is where the Emperor used to appear before the public for each morning.

* Rang Mahal, (Colour Palace). The residence of the Sultan's main wife.

* Mumtaz Mahal, (Jewel Palace). Contained six apartments for the Sultan's harem. Now used as a museum of court textiles, carpets, weapons, etc (free).

* Daawat Khana, A minor palace at the northmost end of the Fort, this was originally the residence of a prince, but it was converted into a tea house by the British, a function it continues today. Basic meals go for around 60 rupees, drinks 10-20 rupees, and it also has the cleanest toilets around.

* Swatantra Sangrama Sangrahalaya, (Museum of the Independence Movement). To the left after the Chatta Chowk, this is a reasonably well-presented museum on the history of independence activism in India, starting from the Mutiny of 1857 all the way to Gandhi.

The only open entrance is Lahore Gate, on the west side. Security in and around the Fort is very heavy, as it was the scene of a terrorist attack in 2000 that killed three people. Bags are allowed, but they'll be X-rayed and you'll be patted down. Tickets cost Rs 10/250 rupees for Indians/foreigners, photography free, video cameras Rs 25 extra. Open sunrise to sunset daily except Monday. Allow for 3-4 hr in your schedule in case of long weekends and national holidays as lot of tourists flock around then. The most scenic way of reaching the fort is to take the Metro to Chawri Bazaar and then a cycle-rickshaw through the incredibly packed bazaar to the Fort (price negotiable, aim for Rs 20).

The fort has a light and sound show (Rs 50) in the evenings from 7:30PM-9PM, depending on the season.

Be careful buying tickets at the booth, as the ticket sellers will attempt to shortchange you. Try to have a small bill. Due to enhanced security the parking can be a bit tricky as the walk from the now distanced away parking at nearby alternative slots is quite a bit. The congested traffic makes crossing the road even trickier.

Humayun's tomb

Humayun's Tomb in south Delhi, near Hazrat Nizamuddin station, is one of Delhi's three s. Open daily from sunrise to sunset, entry is Rs 30/500, Indians/foreigners. 

The tomb is in large, immaculately maintained gardens in the Persian Char Bagh (four corners) style that were thoroughly renovated in 2003 with the Aga Khan's help and are consequently probably the best in Delhi. As you enter the complex, the first major structure on your right is the bulbous, octagonal tomb of Iza Khan, a court noble who built it in his own lifetime, some 20 years before Humayun's tomb. As you pass through the first gate, you will glimpse the dome of the tomb and enter a floral path leading to the second (West) gate, which now acts as the entrance to the giant central garden.

The centerpiece is the eponymous tomb of Humayun, the second Mughal emperor. Built starting in 1562, it was the first major Mughal structure in the city and has been described as a predecessor or prototype of 's Taj Mahal. The structures are, indeed, stylistically similar, although Humayun's Tomb is built from red sandstone, not white marble, and was built by a wife grieving for her husband, not the other way around. You can climb up to the second level (the stairs on the west side are very steep, those on the south side less so), and on the south side you will find the entrance into the main crypt where Humayun is buried.

Before you leave, be sure to visit the South Gate, the original royal entrance, from where you can get picture-postcard views without too many tourists in the way. In the southeast corner is the Barber's Tomb, also built in the same style. Historians do not know who is buried in this picturesque tomb made of red and grey sandstone.

Qutub complex

This complex in Mehrauli, houses structures dating from the Slave Dynasty (1206-1290) and is designated as a . The gardens are kept in excellent shape, making this a popular relaxation and picnic spot. Open daily from sunrise to sunset, entry is 15/500 rupees Indians/foreigners. Light-and-sound show held most nights after sunset. Now easily accessible via Qutub Minar station on the Metro Yellow Line, followed by a short auto ride.

* Qutub Minar, The most famous structure on grounds, this 72.5 m minaret was the tallest "skyscraper" in the world when built (1193-1368) - it was constructed on the orders of Qutb-ud-din Aybak. Delicately carved, it has been astonishingly well-preserved and is still an awe-inspiring sight today. It's often visible from air when flying into IGI airport! (Sticklers for archaeological truth will, however, note that the top of the tower has twice been rebuilt after an earthquake, and the base has been restored more recently.) While entry into the tower itself is no longer permitted, for Rs 10 per 5 min you can view the scenery via a little webcam on top.

* Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque, Delhi's first and grandest mosque, now mostly in ruins, but many parts of the complex are still standing and the sandstone decorations are still impressive. Check out the extraordinarily ornate carvings near the tomb of Iltutmish on the west side of the complex.

* Iron Pillar, iIn the centre of the mosque. True to its name, this is a 7 m iron pillar erected in 400 AD by Chandragupta II Vikramaditya, also known as "he, by the breezes of whose prowess the southern ocean is even still perfumed" according to the inscription carved on the base. Alas, Chandragupta II's perfume has long since faded, but to the amazement of metallurgists everywhere, his pillar is still going strong, after 1,600 years.

* Ala-i-Minar, Ala-ud-din-Khilji set out to build a tower twice as high as the Qutub Minar, but died after a mere 24.5 m was complete. The first story stands to this day.

* Ala-i-Darwaza, This square, domed building once acted as the entrance to the mosque, but is now tucked away behind the minar. Inlaid marble decorations and latticed stone screens.

* Tomb of Imam Zamin, Outside the main complex, next to the Ala-i-Darzawa, this octagonal tomb commemorates a Turkestani iman who was based in the mosque during the reign of Sikandar Lodi.

Other

*Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) Campus, Not usually considered a "place of interest" for tourists, this one of a kind campus of the premier National University of India remains a hidden gem of the city. The campus is hilly and rocky and some areas look more like a jungle with peacocks. The hostels represent the geographical vastness of India as they are named after Indian Rivers. For instance Godavari and Ganga. Specific areas of the campus are named after a particular geographical region in India. For instance Uttarakhand and Dakshinapuram. Some of the non-scholarly attractions of India's best University include 24x7, an eating joint which is open, as its name suggests, is open round the clock. For a visit to the JNU campus, board bus # 615 from Connaught Place. The famous Qutab Minar is very close to the JNU campus.

* Lodhi Estate

Do

* Take a walk at Connaught Place (CP), the heart of New Delhi. It is now called Rajiv Chowk. The British-designed colonial equivalent of a shopping mall, it's laid out in two concentric rings divided into blocks, all bursting with shops and lots of pampered pigeons waddling about. Long neglected, the area received a major shot in the arm after the opening of the major Metro junction of Rajiv Chowk under it, and it's going more upmarket by the day. 
Be careful, there are plenty of well-organized hustlers trying to trick you to take a riksha ride to places where you can supposedly do "cheaper and better shopping".
At the centre is a small but pleasant park, while on one edge is the notorious Palika Bazaar, an underground den of cheap wares, many pirated or smuggled from overseas. The area is surrounded by tall office buildings on nearly all sides. Train fans will want to check out the Metro Museum inside the (Patel Chowk) station, open 10AM-4PM, Tue-Sun (free with valid Metro ticket). Quite simply the best place to hang out!

* The Delhi Zoo is a very large and sprawling park dedicated to preserving the rich biodiversity of the country. This park may be the only chance of seeing a tiger or elephant for some travellers. Be prepared to do a lot of walking 

*Take this tour to explore the different aspects, sights and people of the city which most visitors miss. These photography tours help you experience the city like a local as well as take some excellent photographs. You can use almost any camera you have or rent one if you feel like it.

* For a half-day itinerary in Old Delhi, see .
*A must do for foodies, these food tours are an excellent way of tasting the local cuisine which most tourists can't due to lack of knowledge and time. These food tours can be customized to include different places and food items of your choice. A typical food tour covers food as well as sightseeing in various parts of New Delhi and Old Delhi.

Learn

Delhi is a key centre of learning in India. The most famous universities in Delhi are JNU, DU, JMI, IGNOU, IIT and NLU, Delhi. The official website of the Delhi Government's Directorate of Education is a good starting point for learning more about study opportunities in Delhi.
 
Apart from undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral courses, there are many training and diploma-level institutes and polytechnics that cater to the growing demand for skill-based and vocational education. Besides conventional educational institutes, more and more foreigners also make the effort to learn Hindustani language (Hindi-Urdu) and Delhi is these languages.

Work

Delhi's economy is expanding rapidly. In analogy many interesting work opportunities emerge. Monster and other online job platforms are a good starting point to see what kind of jobs are on offer. Traditionally foreigners often work in the social sector or in teaching. Increasingly, however, expats work for multinational companies and even local Indian companies.
 
There is a great variety of employment opportunities in Delhi for foreigners, whether they would like to work in business, NGOs, educational institutes, or even government. Still, there is one caveat: the labour market in Delhi is highly competitive and so at many prestigious organisations, the number of applicants far exceeds the number of positions available, which allows employers to receive highly talented applicants for rather meagre salaries (especially when compared to other international destinations).

Buy

If you're not afraid to haggle and bump elbows in bazaars, Delhi is a great place to shop. Also, Western-style malls are plentiful in the suburbs of and . Many shopping districts are overly crowded on Saturdays and closed on Sundays.

* Indian Florist from 2012, which was once owned by the legendary Delhi Arena's shop owner (who famously was the champion for the fashion week in 2012), this family owned business has over 237 flower varieties, the largest in Delhi and perhaps the nation, 
and is the only store in the India that still does turn-of-the-century style Indian flower arrangements. Going to the Maya Flowers store, you can pickup small bouquets inexpensive bouquets and watch free live demonstrations on old European flower arrangement techniques.
Malls
* Perhaps India's most luxuriant mall. You'll find 3 floors of international designer brands such as Armani, Hugo Boss, Paul Smith, Gucci and Salvatore Ferragamo, as well as a number of Indian designers such as Tarun Tahliani, Manish Arora, Rohit Bal and Satya Paul. Emporio also houses one of New Delhi's most popular new restaurants, Set'z (formerly Zest), a chic dining experience with over seven different cuisines to choose from.

* Features the only 7-screen multiplex in Delhi.

* 

* 3 adjacent malls that includes stores from several top name designers.

*

Bazaars

* A unique cross between a European shopping arcade, an Indian bazaar, and an upmarket shopping mall. With all shops laid out in 2 circles, it's easy to get around and explore.

* Oriented toward backpackers, this strip of shops sells items such as Indian perfumes, shawls, tablas, rugs, jewelry, etc.

* Popular with college students and known for its spicy street food.

* Rajouri Garden Market - Excellent place to shop for wedding as well as everyday clothing.

* Central Market, Lajpat Nagar – Middle-class Indians do their shopping here. Great deals for apparel, whether ethnic Indian or otherwise. 

* Sarojini Nagar market is great for export surplus garments, and green grocery.

* Khan Market is good for groceries (great choice of vegetables), clothes (upper class Indian style, not expensive, Fabindia and Anohki for women's clothing), housewares (Good Earth), jewelry/accessories ( Silver Centrre By Sangeeta Boochra ), and books (many bookshops). 

* Janpath is a bargain-hunter's dream and just a two minute walk from Connaught place. Think of it as a vast flea market, where you can get all kinds of knick-knacks and clothes. Janpath is not a place for those unwilling or unable to bargain ruthlessly. Also, as in any flea market, quality will vary greatly. There are also some bookshops.

* Karol Bagh, West Delhi Market known for traditional Indian Wear, sarees and shawls. Huge area and big brand showrooms.

* Palika Bazaar, Connaught Place – This is a large underground market in the center of Connaught Place. The air here is bad and the quality of products low. One can hunt for DVDs, VCDs and Audio CDs of Hindi, English and a few regional and foreign language films and PC-based games. 

* Chandni Chowk, Metro Yellow Line. The heart of Old Delhi, this is the place to go for the full-on Indian experience of crowded, twisting alleys and tiny shops. The Fountain serves as a useful orientation point, and there are great Delhi-style snacks to be found in the vicinity too (see ).

Books

The Indian book industry is huge, producing annually about 15,000 books in English, and obviously far more in Hindi and other native languages. Delhi is hub of this industry, so small, specialist bookstores abound. Locally produced books can be very inexpensive and many popular Western titles are published and available here for a fraction of their original cost.

*Khan Market, This is a shopping area for local diplomats. There are many book shops here that have a wide selection at reasonable prices.

*Mid Land Bookshop, South Extension and Aurbindo Place. Very similar to bookshops in Khan Market, but at better prices. 

*Galgotia and Sons, Cannaught Place. A more disorganized bookstore, but with an excellent variety of books available at excellent prices. 

*Jacksons Books, in Paharganj. Ask to see their collection of classics and works by Indian writers - and a lot more - in their shop that is behind the front stall (about 600m down Main Bazaar Street from New Delhi station, on the left hand side).

*The Bookworm, Connaught Place. If you are more adventurous and want a 'localized' experience with the best books published in India you can go to:

*Nai Sarak (near Chawari Bazaar), (use Chawari Bazaar or Chandani Chowk metro stations on yellow line). Narrow alleys where most publishers are based. This is very popular with students, particularly college students as course books are available here. They carry books in nearly all major languages spoken in India. Don't expect bargaining to work here as shopkeepers are too busy to argue. The shopkeepers do more business than any proper branded shop, selling at least 5,000 books daily. There are also many whole sellers. Very few books will be on display and you need to ask for a particular type of book as the variety of books sold is huge. Most books are original and the shopkeepers get very irritated if you question the book's genuineness. You can either take a rickshaw or walk. One of Delhi's oldest shopping complexes, you can find any book there after a day of searching. Also good areas for sightseeing.

*Daryaganj and Asaf Ali Road, A little better organised, but otherwise very similar to Nai Sarak. Hindi Book Centre on Asaf Ali Rd is very famous and one can find practically every Hindi book there,they also have a good website. 

*Kamla Nagar, Bookshops in F-Block opposite to Birla Mills compound and on the road leading to Roop Nagar roundabout provides a range books and stationaries.

Eat

Delhiites complain about many things in their city, but the food will satisfy even the most demanding gourmet. Not only can you find some of the best Indian food on the subcontinent, there is also an increasing number of excellent (if often pricey) international restaurants offering cuisine from around the world. When ordering, do remember that Delhi is about 1,000 km from the nearest ocean, so vegetarian, chicken and mutton dishes are the way to go.

Delhi has arguably the best street food in India. However, do not eat unhygenic or open food. There are plenty of restaurants offering street food in a potentially more hygenic environment (but still the best taste is found in the streets). Enjoy the street foods but keep some tropical medicines for GIT problems (Norfloxacin Tinidazole composition works very well) 

You can join local groups of foodies who go out regularly to sample and savor what new and old dishes the city has to offer. One of the most active groups is Food Enthusiasts of Delhi They organize regular food walks, better known as Raids to various parts and joints in the city. Its a non-commercial group, brought together by passion and love for food. If you are looking for professionally run setups, Delhi Food Adventure runs commercial food walks exclusively for tourists. If walking around looking for good food is not your thing, have a look at some of the Delhi-centric food and eating out blogs, such as Dilli Daawat 

Budget

The best place to go for chaat is the Bengali Market (near Mandi House Metro Stn) near Connaught Place in the center of town. The restaurants are high quality and the food is great. There are ATMs as well. One of the best known restaurants there is Nathu's. But for the really good chaat you have to make your way to Old Delhi, and particularly to Ashok's near Chawri Bazaar. While connoisseurs insist that the best chaat is prepared on the street, most travellers try to find a comfortable middle ground between hygiene and authenticity.

*Andhra Pradesh Bhavan Canteen, Ashok Road (near Man Singh Road). Open for lunch and dinner this is a favorite of local Delhi foodies who are looking for an authentic meal. They serve all you can eat veg/non-veg thalis for Rs 80-150. For carnivores, you have a variety of non-veg options (chicken/fish/mutton) but the mutton fry is recommended. The service is quick and efficient (slipshod and aggressive), and the joint crowded and noisy. Another favorite is the Karnataka Bhavan canteen beside Ansal Plaza near Mool Chand offering all possible South India food.

* Haldiram's, 1454/2 Chandni Chowk (just west of the fountain) and other outlets around town, This is a famous manufacturer of Indian snacks and sweets that has now gone global. This always-packed, two-story outlet in the heart of Chandni Chowk was its first in Delhi and dates back to 1924. The ground floor houses a vast array of sweet and sticky Indian confections, while the first floor has a popular vegetarian restaurant. This is a great place to try authentic and hygienic Delhi chaat and other Indian snack foods. Try the Raj Kachori, a mixture of different types of stuffing with sweetened yogurt and chutneys in an oversized hollow dough shell. All chaat is under Rs 50, or you can get a full daily thali for Rs 90. Choley Bhature, and the various Dosas are great options to try as well from their Southern Indian selection. Be sure to save room for dessert, as Haldiram's offers some of the best rasmalai, rasgullah, gulab jamun, and other tasty delights in India.
 
* Tadka, 4986, Ram Dwara Rd, Nehru Bazar, Paharganj, (side road off of Main Bazaar). A notably clean restaurant by Paharganj standards. Serves only vegetarian food. Their tea is really good and their most popular dish is paneer masala. They have raised prices due to recommendations in travelguides! Full Thali is now around Rs. 150.

* Nangarg, Rajgur Marg Road (side road off of Main Bazaar), Paharganj. A really good hole-in-the-wall restaurant that serves vegetarian and non-vegetarian food for about Rs 60. The workers there are genuinely good people, which can be hard to find in this area. You'll have more luck finding a sign that says "Veg-Nonveg" than their actual restaurant sign.

* Bitto Tikki Wala, (also known as BTW), Netaji Subhash Place, Pitampura. The best aloo tikki (potato and vegetable burger) available in town. It has a branch in Sarita Vihar, Near Apollo Hospital and Badarpur border. It has branches all over the city now, in shopping areas.

* Amritsari Kulcha Wala, Paschim Vihar Red Light, (near Jwala Heri Market). If you are into amritsari kulcha, you probably can't miss this. People on dieting beware: the amount of butter that the vendor puts in is huge. However, without it you will not enjoy the Amritsari Kulcha so much. It is kind of a road side dhaba or shack. Rs 60 for two kulchas is what he charges. It is actually on Outer Ring Road, Adjoining to a park wall. You can ask anybody about the Kulcha wala and they will be able to tell you the direction in Paschim Vihar/Meera Vihar Outer Ring Rd.

* Egg parantha Wala, Lajpat Nagar, (opposite to Surya hotel). This guy owns a shack and has been running the parantha business for ages.

*Kake Di Hatti, Chandni Chowk near Old Delhi Railway Station. The most extensive varieties of naans(Indian bread) you will find in Delhi. They make the biggest and best tasting naans for your money.

Mid-range
You will find McDonalds, KFC, Subway and Pizza Hut in malls and throughout the city. The Indian menu without beef and with lots of veggie options can be interesting even if you would otherwise steer clear.

* Don't be put off by the cramped stairway up. This is a clean and bright little haven of peace with birds-eye views of the chaos below. The menu spans the gamut but the thing to try is the Japanese food, prepared under the watchful eye of the Japanese owner.

* Voted as the best North Indian Restaurant.

* As you'd expect from a restaurant on Kebab Lane, the name of the game here is Mughal-style meat (mutton and chicken), served up since 1913 and still going strong. Get here down a little alley just South of the Jama Masjid southern entrance (past the auto supplies market). Favorites include badam pasanda (boneless mutton cooked with yogurt, almonds and spices) and chicken noor jahan, but if you're really hungry, try Tandoori Bakra; an entire stuffed goat for ₹4,500, 24 hr notice and down payment is required. And a style tip, some of the dishes have huge puddles of oil on top, which you're supposed to drain off before eating.

* A roomali rolls and kababs restaurant serving chicken, mutton, paneer, and rolls. Very popular with locals.

* Great view and ambiance.

* Famous for their tandoori chicken and North Indian food. Their family-sized naan is delicious and the size of a 4 year old child. Home of where the original Dal Makhani, Butter Chicken, and many of the other dishes now highly popular in the UK were first created.

* India's answer to McDonald's, this serves both Indian and Western fare. Has many other branches throughout the country.

* Considered by many to be the best place for authentic South Indian food, Sagar does justice to the reputation. The menu features dosas, idlis, vadas, uttapams, rasam and thalis. A/C. There's likely to be a queue for seats during peak hours and definitely on Tues nights. The upmarket version at Sagar Ratna, Ashok Hotel, 50-B Chanakyapuri, ☎ +91 11 2611 0101, is quieter, better laid out and more expensive. Both also have many other branches.

* A good South Indian joint located in Janpath very close to Connaught Place. They are a chain operating in Delhi. If you go at lunch time, prepare to wait a while. The various dosas are recommended, as well as the thalis (meals) and the sweet dishes.

Splurge

* Bukhara, Maurya Sheraton, Regularly tops the charts as India's best restaurant (and certainly among the priciest), the roast lamb and the Bukhara Dal here are legendary. Always make reservations or be ready to stand in a queue, similar to queues at an airport for about 2 hr. Rs 2,000+.

* Chor Bizarre, Hotel Broadway, 4/15A Asaf Ali Rd, Now franchised worldwide, the original restaurant serves Kashmiri food in an eclectic surrounding like a chor bazaar (thieves market). The buffet is laid out inside an old car. Rs 300-400 for each dish. A bit on the pricey side (relatively for India), but worth 1 splurge meal. If going by foot, look out for the Delhi Stock Exchange on same strip 0.5km from here..

* Naivedyam, East Patel Nagar, (opposite Jaypee Siddharth Hotel), Offers quality South Indian meals and service at great prices.

* Punjabi by Nature, Vasant Vihar Priya Complex Tele 011-46117000;41516666, Rajouri Garden, MGF City Square Mall (Lifestyle). One of Delhi's best-known Punjabi restaurants. Rs 800 or so, more if you order seafood.

Don't forget to wash it down with the seasonal fruit lassi, so thick it takes some effort to suck it up the straws.

* EGO Thai, Friends Colony Market.

* Culinaire, Greater Kailash 2

Drink

The drinking age in Delhi is 21.

Delhi's nightlife scene has undergone a total transformation in the last decade. There are plenty of modern, cosmopolitan joints out to separate you from your rupees. In a desperate attempt to keep the sex ratio vaguely equitable, many lounges and clubs have couples only policies (that is, no single men or men-only groups), enforced with varying degrees of strictness. While everything is theoretically to shut down by 1AM things can keep going much longer. 

*Delhi Bar Crawl provides a great way to explore the nightlife of New Delhi via bar crawls/pub hopping. Each bar crawl covers 5 to 6 top bars and pubs of the city. The places visited in each bar crawl keep on changing to make the best of events, activities and special offers.

The partly UK-based Costa Coffee also has presence in the city with several outlets spread across the city. US based Starbucks Coffee has also made a recent foray into the market with a few outlets in South and central Delhi but adding more and more outlets day by day.

Stay safe

Many first time travellers to India find themselves falling victim to , and unfortunately Delhi has a lot of both. Be on guard for anybody trying to help you by giving you unsolicited directions or travel advice. Do not believe the advice of taxi and auto drivers. If this is your first time to India, do not openly admit it, as this will make you more vulnerable to touts.

If you are arriving into Delhi at night either stay in the airport lounge or well lit areas until daybreak. Women should avoid walking around alone in the night or hiring cabs alone. Radio taxis are a safer option. Dress conservatively. Don't be afraid to raise your voice or shout, if harassed.

Carry your cash, passport, and cards in a secure money belt, with only enough cash for a few hours at a time in your wallet or other accessible place. Some travelers recommend carrying an expendable wallet with a few ten rupee notes in it in an obvious place such as your hip pocket as a decoy to Delhi's ubiquitous pickpockets.

Many tourist agency are scams, Government 'approved' or not. Very hefty extra charges hidden as commissions and processing fees are the least that will happen. Two notorious agencies are 'India tourism voyages' and 'shukla enterprises'. Head to the ONLY official government ran agency on Janpath and Connaught Lane. There are many fake ones around here too so make sure you have the right one. The best way to secure train tickets is to queue on the second story of New Delhi train station where there is a desk for tourists. You can also navigate through the Indian Railways Website Also, you should book you flight tickets online as all the airlines have online booking system. Otherwise, prepare to spend a good hour sorting through the charges that the tourist agency will charge.

Delhi Police

The Delhi Police is a 70,000 strong force serving the capital region. Unfortunately, the quality of police officers varies dramatically throughout the force; some officers may be corrupt and unhelpful, while others are honest and helpful. 

For police assistance during an emergency dial 100. 

Police vehicles (called PCR vans) are parked on almost every major intersection.

For non-emergencies, or to report a crime, go to the police station.

Stay healthy

Delhi is a hot, dusty city and the combination of the two may reduce visibility in the summer. In April through June, temperatures regularly top 40&deg;C, meaning that proper hydration is of the utmost importance. In winter there can be seasonal fog; on particularly foggy days, it can be difficult to see across the street. This is partly because of Delhi's severe air pollution problem; it is advised that travelers keep informed about the daily air quality in Delhi. If you happen to be travelling in or out of Delhi during the winters, be aware of flight delays due to fog.

Drink only bottled water so you may avoid any water-related illness. Keep yourself covered in summers to avoid a heat stroke. Drink a lot of water, 3 liters a day, particularly in the summer. Sticking to freshly, well-cooked vegetarian food will lessen your chances on acquiring the "Delhi belly."

Contact

Cell phone coverage in the city is excellent. There are many service providers offering a wide variety of plans. Among them are Airtel, Vodafone Reliance and Tata Indicom It might be a good idea to buy a cell phone and use one of those prepaid plans to get yourself connected while you are in the city.

Landline phone numbers in Delhi begin with 11, typically followed by eight digits. To call Delhi from outside India you will need to dial the international prefix for your country, followed by India’s country code 91.

Delhi emergency numbers

Here are the Delhi emergency contact numbers

* Police, ☎ 112

* Fire Department, ☎ 101

* Ambulance: ☎ 102, or dial the nearest local hospital

Cope

Power outages and water shortages are common Delhi, often occurring multiple times a day with summers being particularly bad. Better accommodations have water tanks and generators to alleviate the inconvenience, but keep a flashlight handy at night and do your part by not wasting too much water. 

*Laundry service is offered in most hotels, even in budget accommodations. If you would rather save the money and do it yourself, buckets are found in almost all bathrooms - but perhaps wash it out well first.

*Exercising outdoors is not recommended due to the level of pollution and swimming in rivers is also not recommended. Instead, look for a hotel with a gym or a pool since many offer day passes. You can always try a morning or evening walk in the parks.
 
Language
