Get around
Hakodate has a useful two-line streetcar network connected to the train station.

From the end of April to the middle of November,people can go to drive there.This is popular amoung men and women of all ages.Then,this mountain is called "Gagyuu mountain.""Gagyuu" means that the cow seems to be lying down and Hakodate mountain looks like that.

* Tsugaru Fort (津軽要塞) is located on Mount Hakodate. This was a World War II battery (though it predates World War II as a fort) which now has been recreated with camping tables where the air batteries used to be. From the upper ropeway station, use the lower exit on the left of the arrival/departure deck and follow the stairs downward to a second parking lot. There you'll see a sign of the west battery, just follow the path. For the east and south battery you have to hike or take a car there.
* Completed in 1864, this was Japan's first Western-style fortress and finished just in time for it to be occupied by the Ezo Republic as their headquarters. It never saw any action though, as the rebels surrendered peacefully.This was built to strengthen defense.And also,this place is inoling in war.This shape is star.When you look at this form from top,you will understand this shape. Most of the fort was consequently demolished and this is now a large park and popular cherry-blossom spot in spring.Many people bring box lunch and enjoy seeing cherry-blossom. The fort also houses a small museum with exhibits on local history (rotating each year).
* From the 90-meter viewing platform you can get a striking view of the star-shaped fort. Neat dioramas tell the story of the the Enomoto and Ezo Republic (see sidebox), and the role of the fort in Hakodate's history; an English pamphlet is available. The views from Goryōkaku Tower is different on each season. In spring, you can enjoy seeing 1,600 cherry blossoms and the view from the tower is a best place to see them. However, it takes at least 3 hours to go up the tower in cherry blossom season because of the crowds. In summer, you can enjoy full green trees, and in fall you can enjoy the changing leaves. In winter, Goryōkaku is covered with snow and is illuminated at night.

* This is the historical district. One popular attraction is the Old Public Hall (旧公会堂 Kū-kōkai-dō), a European-style building which housed Hakodate's government in the early 1900's. The various churches and consulates in the area, dating to the early days of foreign trade with Japan, are also frequented by tourists. There is a pleasant walk up going from the Higashi Honganji Temple (東本願寺函館別院 higashi-honganji-hakodate-betsuin) all the Way up to the Foreign Cemetery (外国人墓地 gaikokujin-bochi).

Eat
Hakodate's signature fish is squid and its signature dish is Hakodate shio rāmen(not to be confused with shioyuu ramen), a version of the ubiquitous noodle dish prepared with &mdash; you guessed it &mdash; squid stock instead of the usual pork. Nearby Mori-machi is also reputed to have Japan's finest ika-meshi, rice-stuffed squid.

* A small chain of Indonesian-style soup curry restaurants found in many locations across Hokkaido. Has an unusually large scale for spiciness (up to infinity!) and also features several difference house specials, of which the spiciest is 'Dewi Fujin.' There are two other locations in the city (see website) but are not as easy to access without use of an automobile.

* This food-and-beer restaurant, located in a red brick warehouse in the akarenga district, combines a german bierhalle atmosphere into its interior design. The large food menu includes a good selection of seafood dishes, western specialties such as pizza and spaghetti, and there are a couple of locally-brewed beers on tap, although quite pricey (&yen;870 for a pint). English menu with pictures available.

* This sushi restaurant, a short walk from Fort Goryōkaku, is a good value for lunch when all plates are &yen;129.

*This chain of hamburger restaurants is exclusive to Hakodate and is great value for money. "Each franchise is decked out in its own unique kitsch including one in art deco and another in year round Santa themes. They made international news last year when they began offering a “whale burger”, which one blogger called more poetically a “whale whopper”. LaPi, as called by locals, does indeed have a menu as eccentric as its’ décor. The #1 most popular item is called “Chinese Chicken”. This humberger contains chicken, lettuce and mayonnaise and is very delicious. #2 is the “whale burger,” which is fried whale with miso sauce. Two other items are of special interest - the “Hokkaido Genghis Khan Burger” and the "Scallop Burger." The latter originated from a customer contest. The main LaPi website is a trip. The menu link is called “Umai monogatari” which means “Tasty Tales”. There are many different menu items in Lupi. For example, pizzas, cakes, hamburgers and omelets combined with fried rice. The website also provides sightseeing suggestions for Hakodate as well as a page titled “Love Letter,” which appears to be a signbook/forum for folks to pay tribute to their food.

*Quite the hidden gem, Lumbini is a Nepalese curry restaurant in the Mihara area of Hakodate north of Goryokaku Park. There are 4 curry base flavors (tomato, onion, daal, and spinach) and a fair selection of different naans. Has both tables and rug seating on raised platforms. 

*A small but very charming soba restaurant hidden along the main tram line running east from Goryokaku to Yunokawa. The staff and atmosphere are very inviting and the multitude of soba lunch and dinner sets are sure to satisfy. Make sure to try some of their soba-flavored soft-serve ice cream for dessert.

Drink
There are two main drinking districts in Hakodate, Daimon, which is close to the station, and Goryōkaku, in particular Hon-Cho. Foreigners seem to be more catered to in the Goryōkaku area.

* A surfer-style bar open 'til morning.

* An English-style standing room only bar featuring a selection of bottled Belgian beers. Chairs are often set up outside in front of the bar during the warmer months of the year.

* A spacious Irish pub on the 3rd floor of a building in Goryokaku. Several beer options from around the globe including Guinness on tap.

*Small drinking place 2nd floor. "Nomi-ho Dai" All you can drink for 1 1/2 hours-3000Yen. Look for a "Blue Ship's Anchor" on the sign next to the Boss coffee machine. This street has many bars so it is a little confuzing to find. But if you find it- it's well worth a chat with Osho-san. the owner.

*Elegantly styled drinking establishment. "Nomi-ho Dai" more than 3 people; All you can drink 1 1/2 hours- 3500 Yen p/p.

Sleep

* A friendly business type hotel with very good rates, free bike rental, TV, private bathroom, fast free wifi on every floor, free coffee, computer area and dining area on the ground floor, the staff are extremly competent English speakers. The bus to the top of the mountain is also closeby. 

* A 2 minutes walk from the Hakodate station. It is a cozy inn with clean tatami rooms run by an English speaking Japanese lady. Laundry available and the internet in the lounge area is free.

* Five blocks (or street lights) straight on from Hakodate station, or take the bus to Omori-cho. Rooms are typical Japanese 15-tatami Spartan minshuku-style, bathroom included. In 2007, management did not speak English (despite its website having an English page).

* There are two of these hotels in Hakodate (Asaichi and Daimon) and both are within easy walking distance of Hakodate station. They offer very convenient and cheap rooms but lack the 'Japanese experience' you may get from other options. Rooms can be reserved online through an English website.

* A freindly and clean hostel right next to Hakodate Park. Rooms are comfortable, though not all have an A/C. It even has a little observatory to look at Mount Hakodate! Staff speak English and there is lots of information available, as well as Day Passes for the tram/bus.

Update: Call ahead before you go to this hostel, it maybe locked up and deserted as it was in Oct 2013.
