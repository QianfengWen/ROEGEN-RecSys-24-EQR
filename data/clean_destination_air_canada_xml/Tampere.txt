Tampere (: Tammerfors) is the third-largest city in with around 225,000 inhabitants and a metro population of nearly half a million. 

Understand
Being located 170km north of the Finnish coastal capital , it is also the biggest inland town in the whole Nordic region. Geographically, the city lies on a narrow isthmus between Lake Näsijärvi, which reaches far to the north, and Lake Pyhäjärvi in the south. In addition, there are 200 lakes and ponds in Tampere and a total of 450 in the entire region. Despite being predominantly a former heavy industry center, today Tampere is a major hub for information technology, research, education, culture, sports, and business. In 2010, the City of Tampere came in first in an image survey comparing the largest cities in Finland. Leaving Helsinki behind, it was also found the most attractive city among Finns who plan on moving.

Tammerkoski rapids that now run in a canal through downtown Tampere connected the two major lakes with an elevation drop of 18 meters. As early as the 7th-century people started to gather at the banks of the lakes, and in the 18th century, the utilization of the rapids as a source of hydropower resulted in a population boom. Tampere was officially founded on the banks of Tammerkoski in 1775 by Gustav III of Sweden, and four years later, on 1 October 1779, Tampere was granted full city rights. The newly founded city was soon after established as a proving ground of revolutionary economical theories by declaring the freedom of trade to the city dwellers. The status of free town enabled the import and export of foreign goods without customs. In addition, it was ordered that the citizens were allowed to freely practice any Christian faith. Due to the uncommon liberties, Tampere grew as a major market town and industrial center in the 19th century. During the latter half of the 19th century almost half of Finland's industrial labor force was in Tampere. The town's industrial inclination in the 19th and 20th centuries gave it the nickname "Manchester of the North", "Manse" for short (in Finnish) that sticks to this day.

Tampere has been an industry pioneer in Finland since the very beginning. Finland’s first paper mill started operation in 1783, and the first paper machine was engaged at the J.C. Frenckell & Son’s factory in 1842. The cotton factory established in 1820 by James Finlayson grew to become the country’s first large-scale industrial establishment. The first electric light in the Nordic countries was also lit in Finlayson’s modern production facilities in 1882. Finlayson grew aggressively and eventually became the large industrial complex in the Nordic countries. The city’s engineering industry was bolstered by the manufacturer of grinding machines and water turbines Tampella, which was established on the upper reaches of the Tammerkoski rapids in 1861. 

By the time of the Finnish declaration of independence in 1917, Tampere had already grown into a major industrial hub that was predominantly inhabited by factory workers. Because of the unusually large working-class, Tampere was also the worker's union stronghold. The workers' living conditions were terrible which was increasingly generating social tension in the society. The First World War was initially profitable for industrial Tampere, but after the October Revolution in Russia, the vital eastern trade was severed. Now the Finnish society was deeply divided, and the socialists seized control of Tampere in 1918. During the Finnish Civil War in 1918, Tampere became the Red (Social Democratic Party of Finland) stronghold. However, in April 1918 the eventually victorious White forces led by C. G. E. Mannerheim captured the town after the Battle of Tampere. It was the largest battle in Nordic war history. Whites seized 11,000 prisoners, summarily executing actual and suspected leaders and locking the remaining prisoners into camps. The decisive victory quickly led to the end of one of the bloodiest civil wars in Europe.

After the war, both the city and the national consensus were rebuilt, and Tampere grew rapidly. In 1927 the first of the factories stopped industrial operations, and city offices later moved into the empty buildings. Even though the structural changes were already on their way, by the time of the Second World War, Tampere was the center of the Finnish war industry. In addition to uniforms made in textile mills, Tampella factories were manufacturing mortars and artillery. Tampere was bombarded during 1939-40 by the Soviet air force, but the damages were not extensive. After 1960 most factories started to grind to a halt, but the buildings were kept. Nowadays the cityscape of Tampere is characterized by charming old red-brick industrial buildings, most of them reinstated as offices, restaurants, and places of culture. Modern Tampere has come a long way from its heavy industry roots and transformed into a hi-tech research and development powerhouse.

Get in

By plane
Tampere is serviced by Tampere-Pirkkala airport (), (), which lies 17 km from the city. Finnair has several connections to every day. SAS has direct flights to . More importantly for the budget traveler, Tampere is Ryanair's main Finnish destination. However, Ryanair has cut down direct flight destinations from Tampere to only and and does not operate at winter time (at least during winter 2015/2016) at all. Ryanair uses Terminal 2, while all other airlines use Terminal 1.

Tampere Public Transport Bus Line 1A ttps://www.nysse.fi/en/schedules-and-routes.html?state=/en/specialday/MMKISA3/lines runs once per hour during the day and infrequently on weekends and can get you both within 100 meters of the main city square, Keskustori, and directly at the railway station (&euro;5,00). There is a shuttle service for certain flights in the early morning and late-night (Flybus: &euro;10,00) Ryanair has its own bus service to Terminal 2. It takes around 30 minutes. In addition to regular taxi service (&euro;35-40, 20 min), there is also a shared airport taxi service (&euro;19 one-way between Tampere and airport) The direct bus service between the airport and Helsinki has stopped running, but it is possible to change in Tampere long-distance coach station (linja-autoasema) between airport bus 1 and long-distance coaches to Helsinki and elsewhere.

By train
The national railroad company, VR offers extensive train services from different parts of Finland to Tampere with connections south to , south-west to , west to , and north to and . The trip to/from Helsinki using the fastest Pendolino connection takes 90 minutes and costs approximately &euro;21, whereas a local train will take just over 2 hours and cost &euro;16. On weekdays, there are hourly connections to Helsinki except few hours during the night. On weekends, there may be a gap of up to 2 hours between trains. For Finnish students (ISIC not accepted) and children (4-16 years), all train tickets are 30% to 50% cheaper.

From Helsinki-Vantaa airport, where most visitors arrive in Finland, the best way to reach Tampere by train is to take a commuter train directly from HEL airport to Tikkurila train station and board a northbound long-distance train there. The station ticket office is closed at night, but tickets can be purchased from machines (Finnish credit cards only) or onboard the train. Trip from Tikkurila to Tampere takes between 75 and 110 minutes depending on the train.

Tampere main train station is located downtown, at the east end of the main street Hämeenkatu. Most hotels are well within walking distance of the station.

By coach
There is an almost hourly ExpressBus coach connection from Helsinki-Vantaa airport to Tampere bus station operated by Paunu, departing from platform 13. The service operates round the clock, although there may be a gap of 1 to 2 hours between services in the small hours of the night. The trip takes between 2 h and 2 h 30 min depending on whether the service calls in towns on the way. In some cases, there is a change of coach close by at Keimolanportti service station, but it is well-coordinated and effortless. Tickets cost &euro;27.00 (round trip &euro;48.80) for adults, &euro;13.50 for Finnish students (ISIC not accepted), senior citizens (65+) and children of age 12-16. The tickets can be significantly cheaper if bought online before the trip.

A budget coach service Onnibus operates between Tampere and a few Finnish cities, such as Helsinki, with bargain ticket prices as low as &euro;2. The departure terminals vary between the destinations. Coaches from Helsinki, Turku, and Jyväskylä arrive to Hervanta (take a local bus 3, 4, 5, 13, 20 or 24 to get downtown) and Kaleva (take a local bus 3, 17, 25, or 47 to get downtown). Be sure to book online as the tickets are more expensive when bought from the driver. 

By car
Tampere can be easily reached by car. The drive from Helsinki takes about 2 hours and there is a four-lane motorway throughout the journey (speed limit 120 km/h with small portions 100 km/h in the summer, or 100 km/h throughout in the winter). The motorway is new and in excellent condition, but is mainly not well lit. Care must be exercised when driving in the dark, particularly in winter as driving conditions can be harsh due to snow and slippery roads.

There are also road connections from Tampere to Turku, Pori, Rauma, Seinäjoki/Vaasa, Jyväskylä and Lahti. These are mostly two-lane regular roads with speed limits between 80 km/h and 100 km/h.

By boat
In the summertime there's route traffic coming in from both Lake Näsijärvi and Lake Pyhäjärvi. Boats use the slow but beautiful water routes made of strings of lakes. 

When coming to Tampere from the north one can hop on on the Poet's way historical steamship from small towns of Virrat and Ruovesi north of Tampere and arrive in Mustalahti harbour. 

When coming from the south the Silverline can be easily taken to Laukontori harbour from and Lempäälä where the boat stops are some half a kilometer from to the railway stations on the Helsinki-Tampere line. 

Get around

Orientation

The downtown area of Tampere has a couple of prominent features which make it easy to navigate:
* The main street of Tampere, Hämeenkatu, effectively divides the city center into the north and south side. The one-kilometer stretch is limited in the east by the main railway station, where many visitors arrive from Helsinki and elsewhere, and in the west by Hämeenpuisto Park with the City Library and the Church of Alexander. The street continues to the east as Itsenäisyydenkatu and to the west as Pirkankatu.
* Tammerkoski rapids crossing Hämeenkatu just by the central square, split the center into east and west side. The rapids run from Lake Näsijärvi north of Tampere to Lake Pyhäjärvi in the south. The height difference between the two lakes is 18 meters, but the formerly thundering heart of Tampere now flows through the city center rather peacefully, because of the several hydroelectric dams harnessing its power.
* The central square, Keskustori, is located right next to the bridge where Hämeenkatu crosses Tammerkoski rapids. It is effectively the focal point of the city both geographically and socially.
* Downtown area is thought to be limited by Lake Näsijärvi in the north, Lake Pyhäjärvi in the south, main railway station in the east, and Hämeenpuisto Park in the west.
* Great majority of the hotels, shops, and attractions are located either downtown or within walking distance from it.

You can get a great overview of the city beforehand from the aerial photos shot in 2011 at Virtual Tampere 

Districts
There are only a few neighborhoods in Tampere which can be considered interesting to most visitors, namely Downtown, Pyynikki, Pispala. While the downtown area is certainly where tourists often hang out in Tampere, it's worth the effort to spend a few hours hiking around the ridge in Pyynikki and Pispala district which lie just 2-3km west of downtown. Hervanta and Nekala districts are more off the beaten path.

*Downtown is the oldest part of Tampere, and where nearly all the sights and shops are located. The busy main street, Hämeenkatu, runs through charming Keskustori main square and is lined with shops, restaurants, and bars. Many of these are set in the foundations of beautiful historic buildings dating back to the late 19th century. Tammerkoski rapids flowing through downtown and between historic red-brick factory buildings only add to the charm and also give Tampere its distinctive look. The canal walls and surrounding buildings are tastefully lit when it's dark. Visitors in a hurry will do well even if they do not have time to wander far from the downtown area. 
*Pyynikki is both an upscale residential area adjacent to downtown, and one of Tampere's most remarkable natural areas of beauty. Geographically, it is an 85-meter-high narrow isthmus between the two lakes defining the city, Lake Näsijärvi and Lake Pyhäjärvi. Pyynikki ridge is regarded as the highest gravel ridge in the world. On top of the ridge, there is a 1920s observation tower. Pyynikki is the town's most important recreation area and it is in use throughout the year. Some of the trails are lit and they function as skiing tracks in winter. There are two pedestrian and bicycle paths but cycling is prohibited elsewhere on the ridge. The ridge and its nature trail are also of great educational importance.
*Pispala lies next to Pyynikki and is built on both sides of the ridge between Lake Näsijärvi and Lake Pyhäjärvi. This formerly working-class neighborhood has gentrified radically and is currently one of the most exclusive neighborhoods in Tampere. Strangely enough, there's also a vibrant artivist atmosphere and Pispala has much in kin with other bohemian arts areas such as Užupis, Montmartre, Greenwich Village, or Freetown Christiania. Together with Pyynikki, Pispala is widely considered the most beautiful district of Tampere, and locals often guide tourists here for the view and the unique urban design features of the area. There is a famous landmark in the area called the Shot tower. Pispala houses the oldest still active public sauna in Finland, Rajaportin sauna that began its operation in 1906.
*Hervanta is one of the biggest and best-known suburbs in Tampere is located about 10 km south of the city center. It is home to Tampere University of Technology, Hermia Technology Center, many high-tech companies, and a large number of students. Hervanta has a gritty reputation based on the large amount of 1970's concrete residential tower blocks and the social problems it suffered especially during the 1980s, but nowadays it has been moderately gentrified. Hervanta's modern red-brick center is an architecturally interesting work by the architect couple Pietilä. If you find yourself in Hervanta when the University is in session, do check out the campus and you have a good chance of running into something wacky.

*Nekala area is famous for its old wooden houses, nonconformist cultural landscape, and sadly, relatively high rates of violent crime by Finnish standards. Take a peek at the rough but still charming side of the city. The word Nekala traces its origins to an old Finnish word with a simple meaning of 'stabbing knife'.

On foot and bike
Walking is the preferred way to get around downtown Tampere. From the main railway station, the central square is just a couple of hundred meters straight down the main street. Biking is more difficult since there are only few cycling lanes downtown. Unfortunately, also in Pispala and Pyynikki districts neighboring downtown, moving around by bike can be difficult not only due to the lack of bike lanes but also because of the elevation differences and abundant flights of stairs in many alleyways.

* rents out bicycles for a 10€ fee and a 40€ deposit. Keys can be acquired from the Tourist office at the railway station.

By car
Driving in the city and everywhere in the region is safe and straightforward, but one should keep in mind that there are many one-way streets downtown. Roads are in excellent condition, but they will be icy during wintertime and can be very slippery also on those chilly spring and autumn nights. Always drive extremely carefully if you do not have experience in driving in harsh conditions. If you choose to drive outside Tampere, heed moose warning signs, especially at dawn and dusk. The legal driving age is 18 and the maximum blood alcohol level while driving in Finland is below 0.5 ppm. There are no open bottle laws, but the police are allowed to measure the alcohol level of the driver on the spot even if they do not suspect driving under influence. 

Many international and local car rental agencies have offices in Tampere:

*A family-owned rental company with delivery to airport. Usually the most cost-effective choice. 1.9 km from the railway station and 1.2 km from the bus station, so it's walkable, and taxies are available.
*
*
*
*
*

While street side parking is limited, there is ample parking in indoor car parks downtown:

*575 parking spaces.
*461 parking spaces.
*612 parking spaces.
*426 parking spaces.
*370 parking spaces.
*409 parking spaces.

By bus
An extensive city bus network connects the suburbs and neighboring cities or municipalities to downtown. Due to the unique geography of Tampere, most of the bus lines run in an east-west direction and pass through the main street Hämeenkatu. All buses stop at or near the central square. When you want to stop a bus, give a clear signal to the driver by holding your hand up: if you are just standing still, the bus will probably just pass the stop. Keep in mind that you can only enter the bus from the front door unless you are traveling with an infant in a push car (and then you must use the middle doors).

The bus fares use a zone system, where the ticket can be bought for certain zones. Usually, when traveling in the city and immediate surrounding areas a 2 zone ticket for zones A and B is enough. In that case single tickets for adults (12 years and above) cost &euro;3 and children cost &euro;1,5, and allowed unlimited transfers within 60 minutes. Every paying adult can be accompanied for free by one child under the age of 7. Adults with a baby in a pushchair can travel for free. Between midnight and 4/5 AM, night buses charge &euro;3 extra (except if you have a valid Tourist Ticket). Tickets can be purchased in cash from the driver on board. You should mention where you are traveling to the driver when buying the ticket if you are unsure what zone you are traveling to, otherwise, they usually sell you A and B zone tickets.

You may also choose to purchase a Day Ticket for unlimited travel by bus within Zones A to C or A to F, A to C is enough for the city and surrounding areas including the airport (&euro;8 for the first day, additional days cost &euro;4 for adults; youth and children are &euro;6/&euro;3 and &euro;4/&euro;2 respectively). Purchase the smartcard at the railway or bus station, central square kiosk, or city transportation office at Frenckellinaukio 2 B, on the northeastern side of the central square.

By taxi
As elsewhere in Finland, taxis in Tampere are clean, safe, reliable, and expensive. The drivers are extremely competent and will know their way around. If you happen to know the address of your destination, you may consider writing it down and showing it to the driver to avoid misunderstandings. The cost of the trip depends on the number of passengers and time of day (day/night). For example, 1-2 persons traveling in the daytime a 5-kilometer trip costs about &euro;10 and a 10 km trip about &euro;16. You can try to hail a passing cab if its roof light is on, but the most common way is to find the nearest taxi stand and get a cab from there. There is a stand in front of the train station and in the central square, among other locations. You may also call the taxi station (the number is 10041 from the landline or 01004131 from a mobile phone) and ask for a taxi to your current location. Taxis accept cash and major credit cards. There are no taxi companies, the national taxi service is the only legal service provider.

 Museums and galleries 

Most of Tampere's museums concentrate on its industrial history. Kids will get a kick out of the Spy Museum, Police Museum, and possibly Moomin Valley, which however is more like an art museum than a theme park.

*Amuri is a block of 19th century wooden houses turned into an open-air museum that vividly displays how the working-class used to live between 1880s and 1970s. The houses form an almost closed inner court, and there is a nice old-fashioned cafe with seatings both indoors and in the courtyard. Highly recommendable for history buffs, but interesting to others as well.
*Monthly exhibitions on arts and crafts.
*The exhibitions at Werstas offer an overview of the history of the industrial era, worker population and civil society from different perspectives. At Werstas, you can visit the Textile Industry Museum, the Steam Engine Museum as well as the Labour Museum's changing and permanent exhibitions. The huge steam engine that used to give power to the entire factory complex is the definite high point of Werstas.
*Home museum of art collector Kustaa Hiekka.
*Small and quirky museum revolving around one of the founding fathers of Soviet communism. Located in a building owned by the Workers Association of Tampere that surprisingly also links to the October Revolution in Russia. Contains a lot of texts, maps, and pictures as well as "artifacts" that have something to do with Lenin. The museum shop is also worth visiting.
*Museum devoted to the Tove Jansson characters, with original sketches and drawings. The permanent exhibition is rather staid, but there are occasional performances aimed at children.
*Quite recently opened museum located in the suburb of Hervanta (the buses 4, 13 and 20 have a stop at practically its front door), presenting the history, tools and crafts of Finnish police during 900 years timeframe.
*Modern art, both Finnish and foreign.
*Claims to be the first spy museum in the world, exhibiting everything from world-famous spies to their equipment such as spy cameras and secret weapons - many of which you can try. You can also attempt to fool the classic lie detector.
*Changing exhibitions of Finnish and foreign art. Adults 6, children 2.
*Tampere's largest museum, a whole museum center with 8 permanent and around 6 temporary exhibitions varying from prehistory to technology and art housed in the old Tampella factory hall. If you want the most versatile and comprehensive museum experience in Tampere and cannot find anything of special interest to you on the list of other more specialized museums in the city, take a peek into Vapriikki. The permanent exhibitions in Vapriikki include The Natural History Museum which is pretty self-explanatory, but has a significant Finnish and Tampere region focus, Tampere 1918 depicting the civil war events in Tampere in spring 1918, The Finnish Hockey Hall of Fame and as the newest addition since 2014, a Postal Museum. Usually, the most internationally significant temporary exhibitions that land into Tampere, are shown at Vapriikki. Also, the previously stand-alone Media Museum Rupriikki was moved within the walls of Vapriikki in October 2015. Rupriikki is a media museum focusing on the history and development of mass communications, and hosts among other things interesting retro computers and games. The same happened in 2014 to the Mineral Museum, whis exhibits plenty of gemstones cut and raw including a 600-kg chunk of Brazilian amethyst, meteorites and even a couple of dinosaur eggs.

 Churches 

* Solid concrete modernist church designed by famous architect Reima Pietilä in 1966. It is likely the most important piece of architecture in Tampere. Locals call it "The Silo of Souls" (Sielujen siilo) and from the outside, it's not hard to see why, but the stark interior is quite awe-inspiring: very high and big room without pillars, minimalist interior made of bright wood. Some Sundays, community members guide onto the roof, which offers a good view over Tampere, and let one have a nice view from the top into the church room.
* The oldest building in Tampere, built in medieval times with parts dating back to the 1400s. Unheated and thus open only from May to August.
* Imposing church in the Finnish National Romantic style, designed by architect Lars Sonck and completed in 1907. The interior has a series of famously macabre frescos by Hugo Simberg, including The Wounded Angel (once voted Finland's "national painting") and the Garden of Death.
* This is a neo-gothic red brick building. Its interior is simply colored by wooden craftwork. It is surrounded by a small park containing a few old gravestones.
* The oldest church in Tampere center is this yellow wooded church build 1824. Four years later, a bell tower designed by Carl Ludwig Engel was added. It can be a little bit underwhelming as churches go, but it's easy to check out because it's right next to the central square, where you'll probably be visiting anyway. 
*Russian-style onion-domed church dating to 1896, serving Tampere's tiny Orthodox minority.
*The church in the Finlayson area was built in 1879 for the factory workers. It is a small church in Gothic revival style with a red brick facade. This is the favorite wedding church in Tampere.

 Parks and gardens 

*Large park around a pond by Tampere Hall, near the city centre. Good choice for a summer picnic. In the summer there are also different breeds of chicken, peacocks, and other birds in cages by the pond.
*A mansion with an arboretum (a collection of trees and plants), a rose garden and a park by Lake Pyhäjärvi.
*Newly renovated green spot by the Tammerkoski rapids in the center of the city. A popular place to have a picnic or a beer on a sunny summer day.
*Nice park by Lake Näsijärvi, created in the early 20th century. Starts from the north end of Hämeenpuisto. On the highest point of the park lies a baroque-style mansion and a memorial for the victims of the shipwreck of S/S Kuru, which sunk off Tampere in 1929, killing 138 people. By the memorial you'll have a great view over the lake Näsijärvi and Särkänniemi Adventure Park.
*A park with a fountain. From the park you can walk through the woods to Pyynikin uimaranta, the most popular beach in Tampere.
*A peaceful park in a picturesque residential area. Lime trees are beautiful in autumn.

 Others 

*Collection of historic factory buildings gradually extended from a textile mill founded by a Scotsman named James Finlayson in 1820. The oldest building, a six-story high-rise TR1, dates back to 1837. The complex also includes the factory church, now the most popular wedding church in Tampere, stable yards with arts and crafts shops and pony rides, and the owner's mansion with a park and a restaurant. The factory buildings have been transformed into shops, restaurants, museums, movie theatres, and office spaces. Well worth visiting for anyone.
*Founded in 1844, Tampella is the other major remaining historic factory complex in Tampere. Tampella factories started as ironworks, but later were converted into a cotton mill and a textile factory, and finally into a machine shop and a groundwood plant. Operated until 1991, Tampella factories manufactured, among others, water turbines, ships, paper machines, steam engines, trains, artillery, and airplane engines. Many of the beautiful original buildings remain and have been converted into theatres, museums, and office spaces.
*A short 26-meter round stone tower dating back to 1920's stands on a natural vantage point of the Pyynikki ridge, the largest esker in the world. Despite its modest size, the tower offers a wonderful view spanning over the two major lakes and the entire city of Tampere. Downstairs there is a cafe that offers probably the best sugar-coated buns in the world. They are always out-of-oven fresh and hand-made on location. Around the tower, there is a popular jogging path in a forest with a couple of viewpoints on top of steep cliffs. Even though it is located just outside downtown, it's well within walking distance.
* Old and well-preserved shot tower. Shot towers are nowadays quite rare throughout the world, especially ones that are in good shape. No admittance though.
*Built in 1901, the historic market hall is still a beautiful social focal point of the city. Lots of fresh goods, cafes, cheap local eateries, and infinite people-watching opportunities.
* In 1978 a competition was arranged for the design of a new main library. The jury unanimously chose the design by Raili and Reima Pietilä. The architects said they had been influenced by various elements, such as Celtic ornaments, sheep horns, and glacial spin formations. The basic idea was a space coiling spirally like the shell of a snail. The form of a bird appeared in the design process. Increasingly, the building began to resemble a large game bird, the capercaillie, known in Finnish as metso &mdash; now the building's nickname. Seen from above, the building looks like a bird carrying a shield.
*A peaceful place to visit on a warm summer day. There is a cafe, art exhibitions, and a garden. The mansion's history dates back to the 16th century. The last stop of bus line 10 is near Haihara.
*Meetings, concerts, functions, exhibitions.

Do

*Artsy movies are shown in their original language.

*To (a leisurely 8 hours), to (a neighboring town, not the company) or just on the lake are popular in the summer. There are many regular boat routes on both lakes (Näsijärvi and Pyhäjärvi).

*1653 seats divided into ten halls. The largest room has 495 seats a 136 m2 screen. All halls have been made to meet the latest quality standards. Plevna shows mainstream movies in their original language with subtitles.

*There are two small skiing hills in Tampere. One is in Hervanta (buses 3, 4, and 13 eastbound). The longest slope in Hervanta is 350 meters with an altitude change of 59 meters. The other hill is in Mustavuori (buses 17 and 29 westbound), near Kalkku. The longest slope in Mustavuori is 350 meters with an altitude change of 69 meters. Both hills offer courses and equipment rental.

*You can fish at the Tammerkoski rapids that run right through the city center. You need to purchase a fishing permit from a nearby R-kioski (Hatanpään valtatie 2), a tourist office (Verkatehtaankatu 2), or a vending machine at the wall of restaurant Rosso. You may catch at most three salmonoids a day, whitefish not included.

*A comfy way to get acquainted with the city's attractions and neighborhoods in less than two hours. Departs from the railway station at 11 during summer months. Tickets are sold in at the tourist office in the railway station.

* In Finland, everyone has a to the wilderness provided that you don't cause damage. In Tampere, good hiking/jogging/cycling/skiing grounds with marked paths can be found in the Pyynikki and Kauppi forests. In Hervanta, there's a popular 4km loop trail around lake Suolijärvi (take bus number 30 to get there).

*In Hohtopaintball, or Glow Paintball, no players are eliminated in mid-round because the game is resolved through scoring points. Players wear score-counting protective vests, which count the hits with impact sensitive sensors. All games should be booked beforehand.

*A spa hotel, about 1 km from the city centre, built into an old cotton mill situated next to a marina. The spa department offers swimming pools, jacuzzis, a children's pool, saunas, a steam room, and spa treatments also for day visitors.

*Tampere has two ice hockey teams in the Finnish premier league, Tappara and Ilves which are among the most successful in history in Finland. The Ice Hockey Stadium is located in Hakametsä, about 5 kilometers from the city center with good bus connections, close to other possible points of interest such as a bowling hall, glow paintball arena and a somewhat large hypermarket complex. You can buy tickets to hockey nights either online or from the stadium if you're interested in experiencing the so-called national sport of Finland first-hand.

*During winter, you can combine sauna with ice swimming: drill a hole into the ice cover of a lake and hop in! The water under the ice stays at constant temperature of +4°C, and is very refreshing. You can try ice swimming at Kaupinojan sauna (local bus number 3 followed by one kilometer walk) or Rauhaniemen kansankylpylä (local bus number 2) on Rauhaniementie near hotel Holiday Club Tampere.

*A popular pastime during sunny midwinter days is to go for an ice walk. In March people walk about a 1km trip to a small reef of Siilinkari on lake Näsijärvi and have a picnic by the small lighthouse. Be aware that it's only safe to walk on a well-frozen lake. Only go if you see other people (and not just ice-fishers) doing so.

*Players wear high-tech vests and are armed with amazing, but harmless, sci-fi laser weapons. The game is a no-contact sport and as such suitable for players of almost all ages. After a game of Megazone it could be a good idea to head to one of the saunas or spas in the city; it's a real sport!

*The oldest still-functioning public sauna in Finland. Located in historical Pispala, easily reached with buses 1, 13, 18, 19, 25, and 26. In old days, people who didn't have a sauna of their own went to a public sauna to clean up. In addition to seeing a piece of history, you can experience one of the best quality saunas in the world: the stove is three cubic meters in size and contains over a ton of stones that are heated literally glowing red with burning logs. After simmering for a couple of hours, the sauna is ready for the customers, and it doesn't get any bigger or better than this!

*Restaurant ship Tampere makes lunch and dinner cruises on lake Pyhäjärvi. Departs from Laukontori harbor.

*Tropical pool department 1500 m² in size, Finland’s longest water slide, bubbling hot and ice-cold pools, a flowing river, a games area, a golf simulator, a gym, a bowling alley, different types of sauna and pampering treatments.

*Lakeside adventure park on the edge of downtown. Rides are open between May and September, and other attractions year-round. The park includes a modern art museum ("Sara Hildén Art Museum"), a children's zoo with mainly domestic animals, a planetarium, a dolphinarium, an aquarium, and the landmark 168-meter Näsinneula observation tower, topped by a revolving viewing deck and a fine dining restaurant serving high-quality Finnish cuisine. It also has the new Angry Birds Land opened in 2012, based on the Finnish Angry Birds game. On a clear day, the views of the surrounding forests, lakes, ridges, and the city are awesome.

*The best of the classics and new works. One of the largest symphonic orchestras in the Nordic countries plays in Tampere Hall.

* Lot of poetry readings and book launches, also in English. Finnish novels and poetry translated to English. Finnish comics. Anarchistic atmosphere. Free coffee and young lazy poets hanging around. Also, a small Author's Museum is hidden inside of the store.

*On a sunny summer day take a 20-minute boat trip from Laukontori (few blocks south of the central square) to Viikinsaari Island. There are beaches for swimming, playgrounds for kids, places for barbecuing (buy food beforehand, there is no store on the island) and a restaurant with a dance pavilion on the island. However, most of the island is a nature reserve, and there is a short nature trail around the island.

Sightseeing on a city bus
City buses offer a cheap and convenient way to get to know off-beaten-path locations. All the bus lines depart from the central square. A few interesting lines worth traveling include:

2 Pyynikintori square - Tammela - Rauhaniemi: A midtown line which takes you to Tammelantori marketplace, Lapinniemi spa (and Naistenlahti marina) as well as to Rauhaniemi beach / public sauna Departures every 15-20 min.

3 Lahdesjärvi - Central Square: A midtown line which takes you to idyllic Petsamo garden suburb, with deep woods in Kauppi (great for hiking, stargazing and other outdoor activities!) and allotments nearby. Departures every 30 min.

10 Pispalanharju - Järvensivu: A relatively short (ca. 25 min) line from the must-see Pispalanharju ridge and Pispala workers' district through nearly-untouched Pyynikki ridge with the observation tower. Then it descends through the upper-class Pyynikki with luxurious villas and palaces (and an art museum Villa Mac) and arrives in Laukontori market square/harbor, also a must-see destination. Eastbound from Central Square, it continues under the railway station and by the university to Järvensivu, a "light edition" of Pispala. Departures every 30 min.

20 Pyynikintori Square - Railway stn. - Hermia – Hikivuori: Westbound, takes you from the railway station, drives through the main street, then turns right to the Pyynikintori Square. Eastbound, it's a rather boring commuter line to Hermia technopolis (if you really want to see where Nokia used to develop their mobile devices). Also a line for architecture enthusiasts. It goes by every (post)modern building of Tampere designed by the famous architect couple Reima and Raili Pietilä. When the bus leaves Pyynikki square, the next stop is at Metso, the city library resembling a capercaillie above Then at the end of Itsenäisyydenkatu street (which begins from the railway station tunnel) is a very prominent Kaleva church, also known as the "silo of the souls". From Kaleva, the line continues along a boring highway to Hervanta. In Hervanta the whole central axis is planned by Pietiläs, namely from the old part of Duo mall and the public buildings surrounding the "bazar" and "piazza" west from the mall. Departures every 20 min.

21 Tesoma – Lielahti - Hatanpää - Turtola: A devious and long line. Southbound from Central Square: the line continues southbound to Hatanpää Arboretum (must-see during the mid/late summer), and then all the way through some boring suburbs to Turtola hypermarket area. There's however a nice pasture with cows, owned by Ahlman farming school along Veisunkatu road, just between the apartment blocks. You can buy raw milk (bring your own can!) and other locally produced foods from Ahlman. Westbound from Central Square: see the ugliness of suburban Finland. The line goes through the Paasikiventie strandway, the Lielahti shopping district (big-box stores, a few bigger malls, etc.), and dormitory Ikuri suburb before arriving in another mediocre shopping hell of Tesoma, where the line terminates. Departures every 30 min.

25 Tahmela – Central Square – Sammonkatu – Janka Western terminus near to line 10 Pispalanharju terminus, but dozens of meters below. It curves through picturesque lower Pispala, or more specifically Tahmela, and continues along a narrow road made in the ridge wall, just like in . The line goes by Rosendahl hotel and the Pyynikki summer theatre and passes some nice villas and palaces like line 10. You may use also this line to the Pyynikki Tower, but the walking distance is somewhat longer. Eastern terminus is in the Janka suburb, the route there goes through a rather nice and livable Sammonkatu high street. At the end of that street is Prisma-Centre (Sarvijaakonkatu bus stop), which is a megalomaniac mall together with some big-box stores. Departures every 20/30 min.

61 Pyynikintori square - Airport (traveling to the airport crosses the city border, so you need to buy a specific ticket onboard (4.60 €). Traveling within the city limits is possible with the Tourist Card). The line to use to and from the airport. Departures every "now and then", about once an hour Much cheaper than taking a cab (which can easily exceed 30€ to the city center).

70 Nokia - Central Square - Kangasala (traveling to Nokia or crosses the city border, so you need to buy a specific ticket onboard. Traveling within the city limits is possible with the Tourist Card). If you are eager to see a town called Nokia, use this line (or lines 71 and 79) westbound. There's nothing special or worth seeing. The paper mills along the Nokia river are the origin of the contemporary Nokia corporation, but the mobile phone firm has no longer any activities in Nokia town. Nokia manor is however still owned by the corporation. Eastbound to Kangasala, there's much more to see. The line passes the long Kaukajärvi lake, which has served as a world-championship paddling stadium. There are two well-equipped and popular swimming beaches along the line, particularly in the west end of the lake (Kaukajärvi swimming stadium) and in the east end (Liuttu beach a half kilometer from the bus stop). The lake offers also some great views of Kaukajärvi suburb, with "recumbent skyscraper" apartments on the opposite shore. They are of wow especially at night when the windows are lit. The line then proceeds to with some ordinary industrial and residential areas and then the bus arrives in Kangasala bus station. There's a small marketplace at the bus station, some local cafés, and very nice hiking routes along the roads or the ridge. Further away there are some observation towers which offer great views. One of them has inspired the 19th-century poet Z. Topelius, who wrote the poem A Summer's Day in Kangasala. Departures every 20-60 minutes.

90 Pyynikintori square - various termini in Teisko area. The bus routes to various parts of the vast rural areas incorporated in the city of Tampere, with city fares. The ultimate experience is available with your Tourist Card. The common route for all the variations is the same as for the city line 28, from Pyynikintori square to Sorila. Recommended for adventurous backpackers or bored exchange students. If you want to see some oldest fossils on Earth, the 2 billion years old "carbon bags" (hiilipussit), take the Aitoniemi-bound feeder bus 91 in Sorila. If you want to experience the hillbilly scene of Tampere, take the Kämmenniemi/Terälahti/Kaanaa-bound bus and leave at Kämmenniemi (the first proper village after Sorila). There's somewhat legendary Kessan baari, the local pub in a former gas station. Near Kämmenniemi there's also a winery called Teiskon Viini with a wine kiosk (bus stop "Värmälä", road address Sääksniementie 76) Even further north is Terälahti, the northernmost village in Teisko area with any services. There's though only a small grocery store and a library with irregular opening times, so it's more for hikers than shoppers. The final terminus within city limits is in Kaanaa, and there's practically nothing there. Feeder line 92 in Sorila takes you to the deep woods of Viitapohja and some nice rural views by the longest known inland fjord Paarlahti.

Festivals
Most festivals are held during summer, but events are always organized somewhere throughout the year Some national holidays, such as May Day, are also celebrated like festivals, and others, such as Midsummer, may offer other special events.

Spring

*Finland is a well-known heavy metal country and this fact is well reflected in Tampere's festivals and nightlife. The most prominent and the biggest metal festival in Tampere these days is South Park Tampere. The name comes from the fact that it is being arranged in Eteläpuisto, literally South Park but apparently officially "Southern Park". Southern Park provides a very atmospheric and Finnish environment for a metal festival with lots of trees and lakes always right next to you.

*Pentinkulma Festival, in Urjala, offers everything a devoted culture consumer may wish for: seminars, courses, discussions, poetry readings, children’s events, and interesting guests. This versatile literary program will undoubtedly satisfy even the most demanding of cultural tastes!

Buy
Although Tampere is lacking some of the international high-end boutiques and brand stores, there are still lots of shopping opportunities from small specialized shops to malls. As Finland is generally quite an expensive country, one would do best to concentrate on finding high-quality Finnish products, such as textiles, clothes, glassware, design, and home decor. Notably, the legislation controlling the opening hours of shops in Finland was overruled at the beginning of 2016, which means that shops can these days be open even on Sundays. Check case by case.

Grocery stores in Tampere (and in Finland) are usually quite easy to find. There are grocery departments on the bottom floors of all three department stores downtown (see below). In addition, look for e.g. K-market,, K-Supermarket, S-market, Sale, Siwa, and Lidl for small to mid-size grocery stores. Hypermarkets (Prisma, Citymarket) are large stores located outside the city center, and you can buy a range of different products (e.g. food, clothes, electronics) there. For exotic hours, the mall Siwa grocery store at Tammelan Puistokatu 29 downtown has the best hours: 06-24 every day. In case of emergencies, you can find comparable small grocery stores available 24 hours a day in the same location with ABC chain of gas stations at Automiehenkatu 39, but it's clearly outside of the city center and can require a little bit of planning to reach with the bus. Alcohol, however, can only be sold from 09-21. Wine or strong liquor are only sold at Alko stores that are closed on Sundays and open (depending on a store) Mon-Thu 09-20 or 09-18, Fri 09-20, Sat 09-16 or 09-18. They are usually located next to larger grocery stores and three department stores. There is one Alko store, however, in Tammela Kullervonkatu 11, which is the only one in Tampere that is separate from a bigger grocery store. 

Department stores
*Upscale department store right next to the railway station. The top floor sells high quality Finnish glassware and home furbishments.
*Large department store in the middle of the main street.

Malls
*Midsize, 2012 renewed, mall at the riverbank, at the foot of Hotel Ilves.
*Smallish mall behind railway station, next to Hotel Villa. More interesting architecturally than shopping-wise: the mall and surrounding buildings are built in modernist style.
*The largest mall in the Pirkanmaa region with a special focus on furniture, interior decoration and clothing. Has a few cheap dining options. Located along the Tampere-Helsinki motorway in Lempäälä south of Tampere, frequent bus/coach connections exist.

Marketplaces

*Fresh food and other shopping in a historical market hall built-in 1901. It is said to be the second biggest market hall of its kind in the world.
*Marketplace at the shore of Lake Pyhäjärvi. In addition to a few booths, many cruises depart from the tiny harbor right next to the market. Here you can get a taste of the Tampere specialty, mustamakkara black sausage, look for "Tapola" sign. From Laukontori you have also a good view of one of the last remnants of the city's heavy industrial past: a fully-functioning cardboard factory in the middle of the city 
*Busier marketplace surrounded by rather dull-looking 60's and 70's apartment flats. There's also a booth that sells proper mustamakkara sausage. The market closes already at 2:30PM.

Design
*Unique arts and crafts products in quaint atmosphere next to Finlayson. Find traditional Finnish handicrafts, design, decorations, and handmade chocolate to take home. There's also a cafe, and frequent events and exhibitions. Kids can take a pony ride around the stables, workshops, and boutiques.
*Small and genuine art and crafts shops, restaurants, an arthouse cinema, and a souvenir store in historic factory buildings right next to the rapids.
*Small shop filled with culinary delights, both edible and inedible.
*Probably the best known Finnish fashion company. By September 2011 there were 84 stores across the world. They are particularly noted for brightly-colored printed fabrics and simple styles used both in women's garments and in home furnishings.
* While the historic Tampere factory is no more operational, you can still feel their rich heritage of manufacturing quality textiles since 1820 in a factory store located in the premises. The place to buy textiles, towels, bed concepts, duvets, pillows, and mattresses.
*Finnish contemporary design by young designers, jewelry, shoes and other fun stuff. Look for items under the brand Vintage Garden, as well!
*Stylish things for your home. Textiles, lamps, watches, furniture, etc.

Other
*Tampere's best selection of both Finnish and English language books, especially well stocked with international newspapers, magazines, non-fiction and university course books. Located temporarily in Stockmann department store.
*Very large home-electronics located 8 km from Tampere center. The best spot for electronics, computers, digital cameras, mobile phones, etc. in Tampere.

Eat

Tampere is (in)famous for its black sausage (mustamakkara), a sausage made of blood and barley. The most authentic way to sample it is from one of the stalls at the Tammelantori or Laukontori markets which will serve it with a dab of lingonberry jam and a carton of milk on the side. Order by price, not weight: "two euros" will get you a nice hefty chunk. Both markets close by 2PM and are closed Sundays too. If you can't make it to the stalls, go to the Market Hall, or as a last resort, to the food sections of any of the three department stores.

Even though it's an imported idea, Tampere is also well-known as the chicken wing -capital of Finland. Historically speaking chicken wings in a hot sauce, Buffalo Wings in America, were brought to Tampere in the very beginning of the 1990s by SiipiWeikot, a restaurant claiming to be the first chicken wing restaurant in Europe. Professional ice hockey players returning from NHL to Tampere liked the idea of being able to eat chicken wings also in Finland and the PR from this led to public success for SiipiWeikot and these days many competing chicken wing restaurants, such as Captain Hook in Kehräsaari. It's said that half of the chicken wings in Finland are eaten in Tampere.

There are no Michelin star restaurants in Tampere (nor are there any Michelin restaurants outside Helsinki at all - even though some claim that e.g. Bertha and C could compete in that category). This goes hand in hand with the positive side of pricing; there are no really expensive restaurants in the city at all. Where ever you spot a restaurant that seems interesting to you, you could and should just hop in if you think you can handle a bill of approximately 30 euros for a tenderloin steak (the famous steak index).

Quality-wise there are not really avoidable restaurants in the city either; some kebab joints can be a little bit disappointing, but at least the Finnish hygiene laws make sure that there's nothing wrong with the food per se. Tap water is safe to drink anywhere in Tampere (and in Finland). 

Budget

For inexpensive fast food, local fast-food chains Hesburger (McDonald's with added mayo) and Kotipizza pizzeria (which are actually rather good - they win international pizza contests on a regular basis) have restaurants everywhere. International places like Subway and Couple of burger kings can be found. Ethnic pizza and kebab restaurants can be found throughout the city, and they are usually even cheaper than fast-food restaurants. Some restaurants stay open as late as 5am on weekends.

Many of the more pricey restaurants also have lunch specials under &euro;10 during weekdays, most notably the lunch at Ravintola C is a steal at 10-12€. Lunch can also be bought in several places inside Kauppahalli market hall in Keskustori central square, and in University restaurants located on the downtown campus. 

*Excellent vegetarian food in three different locations. While not an actual Indian restaurant, the food is seasoned in Indian style. For the best burgers in town head down to Rongankatu branch at dinner time.
*Fine dining restaurant "Hella ja Huone" hosts a tiny fast food place that serves coffee, salads and tasty subway sandwiches. Early hours and the location in the train station make it a great place to grab a breakfast sub to a train when heading out of town.
*Simple home cooking for lunch only.
*A local favorite serving meatballs (hence the name "Meatball bar") and sausages by the pound! Be sure to have their famous creamy pepper sauce on the side. It's a treat.
*Gritty soup bar with a daily soup on tap. Interestingly, they also feature a soup co-developed by the Finnish Nobel Peace Prize winner, former president Martti Ahtisaari.
*Get the freshest possible black sausage straight from the Tapola factory's oven at their "black sausage bar". Take bus 27 from Keskustori and tell the driver you're going to the Tapola factory.
*Mexican food. Affordable hamburger meals in calm atmosphere. Other locations of the same restaurant are at Hämeenkatu 23, Tammelan Puistokatu 34 and Satakunnankatu 22. It's grown these days into a restaurant chain with over 20 locations in Finland, but to justify visiting it; it's originally from Tampere and the first restaurant is the one found at Tammelan Puistokatu 34. Big dishes and their remoulade sauce is heavenly. It's no fine dining, though.*Amazing and affordable sweet and salty crepes. Also have great tea options. Try the black tea with ginger. There's also a shelf with books and games to keep you occupied on a rainier day.

Mid-range
*Authentic french food in Kauppahalli market hall. This delightful lunch bar/restaurant is one of the best kept culinary secrets in Tampere. Affordable and delicious, topped with a unique market hall atmosphere. Easily one of the best lunch offers in town.
*Greek neighborhood restaurant located in Tammela district close to main railway station. Very cosy atmosphere and friendly staff.
*Spanish restaurant catering to carnivores and vegetarians. Serves also more exotic courses such as Rocky Mountain oysters, horse, gnu, and kangaroo.
*American-themed burger joint. Serving sizes range from mid-size meals to towering behemoth burgers.
*The oldest neighborhood restaurant in Tampere located in Tammela district. Known for its large breaded pork escalope, or Coussican vinkkari.
*Beautifully located restaurant at the mansion of Finlayson factory complex.
*The oldest and most loved pizzeria in Tampere. Pizzas vary from ordinary to exotic (for example, ostrich meat, or Finlandia vodka with fried game). Also pizza and pasta options for vegetarians.
*Moody gastropub serving super tasty Belgian food. Astounding selection of mostly Belgian beers, French ciders, wines and cigars. Friendly and competent staff.
*A modern Finnish restaurant in a beautiful historic building. They also serve a vegetarian menu and a small supper at 18€.
* Heval is oldest Turkish style Pizza and Kebab place in town. Portions are huge and quality is above average grill food. They always give you a receipt even if you dont ask. Location is somewhat far away, but worth a visit if you happen to come around. They also have second restaurant in "Koskikeskus" shopping mall middle of the city.
*Hot chicken wings and other deep-fried dishes. Local favourite, prepare for a queue.
*Japanese restaurant and tea house founded and owned by Marjo Seki, who lived 20 years in Japan as a teacher and interpreter. Maruseki had the first tea house in Finland, and you can experience real Japanese dinner kneeling in front of a kotatsu-table wearing a kimono.
*An excellent Indian curry restaurant. A popular buffet lunch on weekdays.
*Brewery restaurant with more sausages and sauerkraut than you can shake a mug at. Not only do they brew their own beer, but they distill their own spirits as well. Located in an old factory building.
*Located in the basement of a beautiful 19th century building is this very attractive red-brick restaurant. Menu consists of classic french with a scandinavian twist.
*Hearty Alsatian restaurant in the heart of Tampere. All the traditional Alsatian meals are represented on the menu.
*Seasonally changing menus from 37€.This stylish restaurant was formerly a weighting station of hay stacks the locals were buying for feeding the horses. Now the restaurant serves Finnish dishes with an European twist, local ingredients.

Splurge

*Belgian bistro-type restaurant owned by probably the best-known Finnish chef Hans Välimäki. Very well known locally for their sunday brunch. The bar section of the restaurant has huge selection of continental beers available.
*Started in fall 2010 but became very popular almost right away. Received the Chaîne des Rôtisseurs badge after only six months. Fixed-price menu updated frequently - during the first seven months of operation, the menu was updated a hundred times. Reservation is usually needed on Friday and Saturday. Excellent price/quality ratio.
*Fancy, experimenting and surprising French-Scandinavian fusion cuisine next to Duck Park.
*Steak restaurant with large dishes. Also the only place in Tampere which takes burgers seriously. There are tasty burgers elsewhere too, for sure, but here it's just something different.
*Local ingredients turn into fancy but still comfortably laid-back dishes at the bottom level of Hotel Ilves.
*Revolving restaurant atop the sightseeing tower with amazing views. Needless to say, it's expensive, but they specialize in Finnish ingredients and the results are above average. It could be said that Näsinneula is the place in Tampere if you're looking for the classiest fine-dining the city has to offer. Food is very good, but from pure culinary perspective there might be places that pass it on the list.
*An excellent restaurant that values great ingredients, uses a lot of local, seasonal ingredients, and is well known for its wine list. Awarded with the Finnish Restaurant of the Year award in 2011.
*A steak restaurant opened up by American-Finnish Stefan Richter, an American Top Chef finalist who was born and spent his childhood in Tampere and who owns a couple of restaurants in Santa Monica. Serves also Wagyu beef steaks.

Drink

Cafes
*Cosy atmosphere in a historic wooden building which is part of Amuri museum of workers' housing. They serve Tampere specialities and homemade bread to go with the brew.
*Tasty doughnuts baked on location. Arnolds is a chain restaurant with locations in all Finnish cities, so it might not be an unforgettable experience, but the donuts are good... 
*Family-owned Tampere institution has 90 years of experience in the fine art of confectionery. The view to a parking lot is not something to remember, but instead you can rest your eyes on the decor from the good old times. Try some of the traditional Finnish sweet pastries or cakes.
*Quirky cafe bar with interesting decor including antique sofas and weird paintings all over the walls. Europa is hugely popular hangout among artsy students and foreigners both early and later in the evening.
* Cafe
* A cute, medium-sized cafe with a good selection of tea. The name translates into "Cafe Poem" and probably has something to do with the heaps of (mostly) poetry books lying around which form an essential part of the decoration. The cafe also features a small, changing art exhibition.
*A central location within Kauppahalli market hall provides ample opportunities for people-watching in moody surroundings.
*The closest thing to heaven in Tampere if you're really serious about your coffee or tea. You can enjoy a cup of your favorite in the shop or buy something to take with you from the selection of tens of different coffee beans or ground and tea varieties.
* Serves sugar coated donuts praised best in town by locals. The observation tower is only 26 meters high, but since it is on top of Pyynikki ridge, it offers a surprisingly good view of Tampere and the surrounding lakes. It costs two euros to climb up the observation tower.
* Now'a'days Pyynikki Observation Tower Cafe has a side location at the Central Square in the city center; of course you won't be able to enjoy the views but if you're feeling a bit lazy and want to experience their famous sugar coated donuts, this is the easy way.
* Cozy cafe located in the smallest stone building in Tampere. The name means "Waffle Cafe" and that's what you'll get, in both sweet and savoury versions. Newly opened a new place in Tuomiokirkonkatu 34, phone +35840 5941070, 

Tea rooms

Tea Shop Veiström Kuninkaankatu 24. Offers quality tea without any artificial flavors. During the summer there's a small terrace and you can also taste tea inside the little tea shop. They even have halal tea.

Pubs and nightclubs

There's no shortage of nightlife in Tampere, and better yet, it's all concentrated in a very manageable area downtown. Virtually all the noteworthy establishments are located either on the main street Hämeenkatu or on the adjacent streets. Therefore, pub crawling is ridiculously easy and there is virtually no fear of getting lost even in the morning hours. 

As anywhere in Finland, most pubs close at 02, but nightclubs stay open until 04, at least on weekends. People enter the clubs quite early by central European standards, and the queues are the longest around 11 PM. Most clubs have an entrance fee of 3-10€ plus an added mandatory service fee of 2-3€. The legal drinking age in Finland is 18, but some places have an even more strict limit at 20 or 22. Dresscode is rather informal even in the highest-end clubs (one might even say that there are no high-end clubs in Tampere), but locals still often try to dress to impress.

Bartenders in nightclubs are usually not very knowledgeable and drinks are almost always poorly made, if available at all. This is probably because of the hardcore alcohol laws in Finland that ban all drinks with more than 4cl of strong alcohol. On the other hand, there might be a rather good selection of shooters at clubs and Finnish and foreign beers in pubs. While the standard big brewery Finnish lagers are rather bland, new and exciting microbrews are popping up every year. Be sure to give them a try somewhere along the way. Nearly every decent pub has some of them nowadays, but you won't find them in clubs. Also, a kind of Finnish drink specialty is ciders and long drinks (gin and grapefruit-flavored mild drink) which are flavored with (sometimes exotic) artificial essences. The ciders do not bear a strong resemblance to their Continental European counterparts.

Pubs

*More of a mainstream cafe bar. Popular among younger students and foreigners. Sometimes live music or DJ on weekends.
*Scandinavian style beer house with plenty of Nordic microbrews, Scandinavian pub food, Nordic style light fare, and Nordic pop music. Very knowledgeable staff.
*English pub with good selection of bitters, ciders and bar food. They also show sports events on screens.
*Moody gastropub serving super tasty Belgian bar food. Astounding selection of mostly self-imported Belgian beers, French ciders, wines and cigars. Very knowledgeable staff.
*A little smaller czech-styled pub with good selection of czech beer and good enough pub food menu. Only 100 meters from the train station, but to the opposite direction than the city center.
*Spanish tapas bar in Tampere. Also a noteworthy selection of spanish beers and ciders.
*Irish pub near the railway station. Many staff members and owners are Irish. The chicken basket is huge for its price, at least in Finnish standards!
*Quaint and easy-going beer house that has an old office theme. A good selection of beers and malts.
*Plevna Brewery Pub & Restaurant is a true Tampere institution located at an 135-year-old weaving hall that also saw the first electric light bulbs in Nordic countries in 1882. The pub is named after a Balkan town where men from Finlayson cotton mills fought alongside Russian troops in the Russo-Turkish War. They serve hearty traditional meals accompanied with their own delicious microbrews. Try, for example, the arguably best Finnish beer, Siperia Imperial Stout, with a serving of one of Plevna's two most classical dishes; Plevna's Stir Fry (traditional Finnish pyttipannu) or Currywurst.
*English-style pub a little off the beaten track, but within walking distance of the railway station. One of the most iconic and traditional of Tampere's pubs in the Finnish style.
*Teerenpeli offers a variety of home-brewed and imported beers and Finnish style ciders. A good selection of malts, and as the newest addition, a home-brewed whisky is available also.
*Stylish wine bar with light Italian fare and views to the Orthodox church.

Nightclubs 
* Tue-Fri-Sat 22-05 Nightclub with two parts. Right part plays Finnish popular music and left international hits. Great way to see two cultures. No need to pay if you want to change sides.
*Small and quirky, but popular night club frequented by university students. Lovingly nicknamed Dorka ("Idiot"). Plays mostly indie rock and pop with occasional gigs on Fridays. 
* Three-storey night club in the center of the city. Plays top40 hits. Frequented by twentysomethings.
*Night club with karaoke bar for adults. Has a decent pub on street level.
*Large night club for a more mature crowd. Classics and Finnish hits.
*Quite popular hotel night club. Music mostly from top hits to club. Classy, you have to dress up a bit to blend in.
*A bar/night club in the old customs house built in 1901. Live music presented often.
* One of Finland's most prominent underground music clubs with a punk spirit. Beautifully located on top of Pispala ridge. Features gigs of various genres, usually from Wednesday to Saturday.
*Disco, clubs, and live music in a beautiful student union building from the early 20th century. Type and age of the crowd depends heavily on the program. Frequented mostly by students.

Sleep

Camping
*Camping area about 3km from the city centre. Open only in summer.

Budget
*The local branch of a budget hotel chain, centrally located on the main street. A self-service hotel (no reception desk). The usual first choice for Finns for domestic budget travels, thus should be a good choice.

*The only thing in Tampere that is close to what you'd expect from a hostel elsewhere. They do, however, have a "hotel section" in their building as well.

*A budget self-service hotel located less than 2 km from the city center, on a street that has regular bus routes to the center.

*A budget hotel about 1,5 km from the city center, near Kauppi recreation forest.

*Apartment hotel located near Tammelan tori, about 5min walk from the railway station.

*Hotel located in neighborhood of Hervanta, far away from the city center, near Tampere University of Technology. Price changes according to the season.

*A budget self-service hotel located 2 km from the the city center. Located in industrial area and has a bit offbeat interior design (fake antique with hints of hindu/indian), but due to lack of budget choices in the city and Mango Hotel still being within walking distance from the city center even at nighttime, it's still an adequate option.

Mid-range
*Located on a boulevard at a southern part of the city. As a specialty Cumulus Hämeenpuisto shares some of its space with one of the biggest gyms in the city (GoGo Hämeenkatu) boasting spinning, squash, instructor-led classes and wide variety of gym equipment, offering a possibility for their customers to visit the gym for 7,5 euros.
*Located in the center of the city next to the riverside park.
*A hotel/spa next to a marina, about 1 km from the city center. Built into an old cotton mill with high rooms. Can be a bit pricey for only accommodation and wouldn't warrant a mention in this list if it wasn't the only spa in the city.
*Located right across the street from the railway station, on the main street.
*Built into an old grain storehouse, located right behind the railway station in the city centre. Interior renovated quite recently, however as a minus you need to walk (through the garage) into neighbouring hotel Torni for the breakfast.

Splurge
*Located in a beautiful lakeside location right under Pyynikki ridge. As a downside, is not very close to the city centre.
*Tampere's best known hotel, centrally located next to the riverside park.
*Historical 1920's style hotel, formerly Grand Hotel, centrally located next to the riverside park. Not as expensive as you might expect, especially considering the comfortable rooms, good service, breakfast buffet, a nice lounge with a children's corner well-stocked with toys, etc. The interioir alone is worth a visit to the bar if not staying at the hotel.
*Hotel opened its doors in October 2014. One of the tallest buildings in Finland, and has a skybar Moro on the top floor offering nice views of the City. Moro is somewhat known for their cocktails and has also couple of local beers from Pyynikki Brewery available.
* Lapland themed boutique opened in 2015.

Talk
Finnish is the language spoken in Tampere. English is also widely spoken in Tampere, particularly by the younger people. Swedish, while not as universally spoken as in Helsinki, Turku or Vaasa, is still spoken to a considerable degree. Other European languages (mainly German, French, Spanish and Russian) may also be understood by hotel staff and people in the tourist profession, and also by many students at the academic level.

The local regional dialect can be recognized by the strong trilling "r"s, as in the greeting Moro!, and the use of mää and sää instead of mä and sä for me and you. There is a stereotypical belief that the word nääs ("you see") is widely used in the area, but it's quite rare in reality.

Learn
There are two universities in Tampere; the University of Tampere and Tampere University of Technology The former has about 15,000 students and the latter about 10,000 students. Tampere has also two universities of applied sciences, the TAMK and PIRAMK each of which has some 5,000 students. 

The city of Tampere runs the Adult Education Centre that offers rather cheap courses for everyone.

 Contact 
Internet cafes are not very common in Finland, and Tampere makes no exception. If you have your own laptop or a smartphone, most cafes offer free wi-fi (or WLAN as it is commonly called in Finland). In the city center and some other locations around town, there is the Wireless Tampere network. The tourist office and main library as well as the several side libraries also offer free Internet access. There is a free wifi all around the Shopping Mall Koskikeskus.

Stay safe

As Finland in general, Tampere is one of the safest cities on Earth. Though, on weekend nights, intoxicated people wandering around city streets may be an annoyance, especially during big summer festivals such as May Day's Eve, which is the most important beer-drinking festival in the Finnish calendar. Warm summer nights always gather a drunken crowd downtown. Intoxicated Finns tend to be rather noisy (in stark contrast to sober Finns) and admittedly sometimes pick a fight with just about anyone. Just use your common sense, and steer clear of overly loud groups of young men. As Tampere is not a big tourist destination, pickpockets and common hustlers are rare.

The extreme cold in the winter should be borne in mind by visitors, especially those planning outdoor activities. Whilst in summer the temperature rises occasionally to 30ºC, in the winter months it can drop to around -30ºC for a week or two. Dressing up accordingly is a must. Also, watch out for slippery sidewalks in winter. Thousands of people fall down and hurt themselves every winter! Winter-time driving needs also special caution as the roads may be very slippery with ice and/or snow.

*The main pharmacy with the most central location and the best hours.
*Emergency room at the Tampere University Hospital.

The national emergency number is 112.

Get out
*, the coastal capital of Finland is well worth visiting for anyone, and it is only 170km (90 minutes by train) to the south.
*, another coastal city, is the historic capital of Finland located 165km to the southwest of Tampere. It makes an interesting day trip by train or car.
* is a mid-size town 80km south most famous for its small medieval castle.
*, the 8th biggest city in Finland, is 120 km to the southeast. While not a tourist city itself, it can be interesting to make a stop here on your way towards South-Eastern Finland (e.g. Lappeenranta).
*Seitseminen National Park (70km north of Tampere) offers a good view of Finnish nature. Forests, mires, and eskers alternate in the landscape. There are guided hikes in summer.
*Helvetinjärvi National Park (85km north of Tampere) encases wild forests and deep gorges that were formed by faults in the bedrock running through the area. Special features of the area include deep rifts, steep-sided lakes and small forest ponds.
* (50km east of Tampere), and (95km north of Tampere) are small downhill skiing stations in the region.
* is some 800km north from Tampere, but is reachable by train or direct flight from Tampere (operated only during winter season). Another option is to travel to Helsinki and catch a plane there. Needless to say, there are plenty of attractions year-round in this magical region.
