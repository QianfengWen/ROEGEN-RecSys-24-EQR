Understand

Get in

By car
State Highway One passes through Timaru. This is the main north/south arterial road in New Zealand. The stretch between Christchurch and Timaru is not particularly scenic, so tourists with time on their hands may opt for the slightly more circuitous but more picturesque Inland Scenic Route 72 via Mt Somers and . 

Timaru is at the end of SH8, which leads to destinations such as (122km) and (210km).

By bus

 Intercity operates daily bus services from Christchurch, Dunedin and other South Island cities. 
 Atomic Shuttles offer connections north and south, with some connections to Christchurch International Airport. Budget Shuttles provides a service to Christchurch including door-to-door and airport options. The Knightrider provides a service to Christchurch and its airport, as well as south to Dunedin.

By plane
 Richard Pearse Airport is 13km from central Timaru and provides several flights per day to Wellington with Air New Zealand. The only ground transport is by taxi, private or rental car. Airport parking is free.

Many visitors to Timaru fly to Christchurch International Airport, which provides a greater choice of airlines and more competitive fares, albeit at a 160km drive to Timaru. Direct coaches to Timaru are available but it's best to check beforehand as these are infrequent (see ).

Get around

Being a medium sized town in New Zealand, the main mode of transport is by car. That being said, most attractions, accommodation and eateries are located centrally so getting around on foot is doable.

 Metro provides commuter and daytime bus services during weekdays. There is a limited service on Saturday and none on Sundays.

The moderate size of Timaru also makes cycling an option. The Cyclery offers bicycles for hire. If you're into cycling, there are quite a few nice rides in the rolling countryside around Timaru.

See

In the port are magnificent cranes which play a pivotal role in wealth generation for the region. Marvel at the glorious array of artistic contributions to the city: the ferocious "Face of Peace", and the "malconstructed tubular bunk of Joy" which reside below the Piazza, and in front of the earthquake-proof Council offices, respectively.

*The Jewel of Mid-South Canterbury. A safe bathing beach and park complex in the heart for Timaru. Swim in the sea with the Southern Alps looming in the background. Don't miss the Trevor Griffiths Rose Garden located at the base of the piazza.

*Set in a stately home donated to the city of Timaru by the Grant family, this gallery features a mixture of permanent and temporary exhibits. The grounds and sculpture garden is always open.

*Set in a quirky hexagonal building up quite a few steps (level access available from Church St), this museum may not be the Louvre or even Te Papa, but still has loads of character. It gives a good overview of the history of South Canterbury, including natural history, whaling, the settlement of Timaru and the flight of Richard Pearse.
*Have a stroll in these pleasant gardens, bring some bread to feed the ducks.

*Take a walk around the centre of Timaru, and take in the architecture typical of early 20th century provincial New Zealand. Many of the buildings on Stafford St have an Edwardian influence. Look out for the Landing Services building on George Street, built in 1870 from local bluestone. Also the Royal Arcade (between Stafford St and Sophia St) the Council Buildings (George Street), the old Customs House (Strathallan St), St Mary's Church (Church St) and the brutalist Warren and Mahoney District Library (Sophia St). As you travel around town you might also see some of the old brick flour mills such as Evans Atlas (Station St) Belford (North St, best viewed from Heaton St), Coupland's (High St) and Timaru Milling Co. (Mill St). Take a good look as some of these buildings are threatened by demolition due to increased stringency in the building code (even though Timaru has a low earthquake risk compared to other parts of NZ because of its location and soil type).
*Modern and contemporary art gallery featuring New Zealand artists.

Do
*Timaru's new aquatic centre. Indoor and outdoor lap pools, leisure pools, hydroslide, steam room, sauna, spa. Fitness centre also on site.
*Every year from 1910 the Caroline Bay Carnival has delighted young and old alike with a proliferation of rides, games and concerts. Critics deride its slightly run-down feel, proponents term this 'retro.' An experience to be had.
*Every year with the first blooms comes the Festival of Roses. Private gardens open up for visitors throughout the week, shop windows are decorated, culminating in a Saturday market day at Caroline Bay with live music. For those less appreciative of floral delights, there is also an "open shed trek" on the market day, showcasing the regions premier "man-caves".
*Small farmers' market in the centre of town with an emphasis on local growers and organic produce.

Buy
*Set in an old settlers' cottage, this quirky gallery showcases paintings and sculptures by local artists. Something for every budget.
*Purveyors in fine antiques - jewelry, furniture, porcelain, silverware and crystal. Entering this shop you are immersed in opulence.
