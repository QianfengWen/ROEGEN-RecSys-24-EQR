Lucknow is the capital of , . 

Understand
Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh, thrives along the banks of Gomti river. The city, Awadh and Uttar Pradesh fell to the British during the imperialistic era . Today Lucknow is dotted with remnants of its rich cultural past.

Lucknow is also known for its elaborate cuisine and Chikankaari, or exquisite shadow-work embroidery on fine muslin cloth.

Lucknow is a historically important city and for many centuries was at the heart of North Indian culture. In particular, the city was famous for its Adab and Tehzeeb (manners and hospitality), intricate embroidery, beautiful gardens and dance forms such as Kathak. It was also one of the sites of the 1857 Indian Mutiny (or First War of Indian Independence). The Hindi spoken in Lucknow is considered the most beautiful and gentle in the country. Currently the city has a population of around 3.6 million.

Lucknow is the heart of the art, cuisine, dance, culture and music of Northern India. It was the cradle of the Hindu-Muslim-Sikh symbioses that made India great. it brought in the best of various cultures and accepted Western institutions like La Martiniere in her womb. It was made famous by the soft-spoken, and sweet tongued, Awadh-Lucknowai culture that was based on civilized behaviour toward fellow human beings. Lucknow is the home of , Hindustani and languages. The city became known as a centre for Urdu poetry and courtly presence and diction, being the birthplace and city of residence for many poets. The Mushaira, an event of poetry recitation forms the heart of Lucknow's nightlife where Mushairas go on into the wee hours of the night. Lucknow's only rival in Northern India was , though Lucknowies were always embroiled in a healthy rivalry with Delhi, home of the famous poet Ghalib and others. Lucknow is also famous for its sweetmeat, the sweet shops in the old city dates to 1850s. Awadhi and mughlai food is the delight of the visitors to Lucknow.

Another thing that may surprise visitors are the ubiquitous posters, billboards and signs boasting of great progress and bearing the picture of Mayawati. She was the previous chief minister of Uttar Pradesh state and been quite controversial. Labeled by some as the "Dalit Queen," she has come under fire for misuse of public funds and abuse of power. She has spent millions upon millions of rupees on massive public works projects such as the Ambedkar Memorial (see below) which opposition leaders see as a waste. No matter who you speak to in Lucknow, everyone will have an opinion about her! It's a great conversation starter.

Climate
Lucknow, much like the rest of the area from to , features a humid subtropical climate. Winters have high temperature variations, ranging from 7°C (45°F) to 22°C (72°F) and therefore, a visitor should bring all kinds of clothing. The city is occasionally affected by cold spells coming from the Himalayas and near freezing readings are reported almost every year.

During mid-spring the city is blistering with temperatures as high as 40°C (104°F) in April. The record high is 47.7°C (117.9°F). By the beginning of July is usually when the indian monsoon arrives. This however doesn't lower down temperatures a lot as they still top 34°C (93°F) and in combination with very high humidity the atmosphere becomes extremely unpleasant. The monsoon ends around mid-September but it is still very hot and 30°C (86°F) stop occuring by the beginning of November.

* A large and impressive tomb complex built in 1783. There is an interesting labyrinth too. You could easily spend half a day wandering around these beautiful but crumbling examples of Mughal architecture. If you hire a guide, do not expect him to know the way around. Guides are known to get lost in the labyrinth! The ticket you buy lets you enter here, the Chhota Imambara (Shahi Hamam), the Husainabad clock tower and picture gallery too, so do not lose your ticket. Please note that lone couples are not allowed to enter without a guide. This prohibition is not brought to notice while buying the entry ticket. You will also have to pay a man 2 rupees to mind your shoes while exploring the complex (shoes are not allowed inside Bara Imambara). 

* 

* An imposing mausoleum built by the third Nawab of Avadh in 1837. The ticket for Bara Imambara is also good for admission to Chhota Imambara.

* A British landmark, set in a park with the somewhat poorly curated picture gallery, and a lake. A great place for sunset. The ticket for Bara Imambara also grants admission here.

* Boys college. The building also known as Constantia, La Martiniere College is one of the oldest schools in the country. It was built in 1840 and started as a school in 1845. The school building is still well maintained. The best time to visit is either in the morning at around 8 AM, when one can see the assembly, or after the school finishes at 1:30 PM. This landmark building has also featured in several Bollywood movies.

* The bloody history of the demise of this Raj era compound is immortalised in the Museum in the Basement. The museum is closed on Fridays. This was the scene of the 1857 First Battle for Independence, referred to by the British as `The Indian Mutiny.´ Although you can still clearly see numerous canon ball marks in the ruined buildings, thankfully it is a peaceful place today. So much so in fact, that you are likely to stumble across couples taking a little private time in the leafy shady groves. The Residency is clearly recognised by the locals and tourists alike as a breezy haven to escape from the bustle and dust of a busy Indian city. The Residency will try to sell you a photo pass for an additional 25 INR. The guard will also ask you if you have a camera. However, once you are inside, no one will say anything if you take photos.

Buy 
Chikan dress &mdash; a cotton dress with hand-made embroidery, is a must-buy in Lucknow. These garments are both for men and women. The cost is anywhere between Rs 250-5000 depending on the chikan work (hand embroidery work on cloth is of various types, "Murri" is the traditional handwork and is, therefore, a little more expensive). In old Chowk and Aminabad, it is a small scale industry so it is cheapest to buy from there. There are a lot of shops next to each other, and for the obvious reason of close competition, you'll get the best bargain. In Hazratganj ("Ganj") the same piece will cost some 200 rupees more but sunshine chikans there in janpat provide all wearings at best price. Beware of the touts who will take you to shops near the Civil Hospital and Hussain Ganj where the prices are 500% higher!

* Very old market, good for buying chikan (hand-embroidered clothes), leather shoes/bags and for chaat/sweets. There's a pretty big book-market (a whole street). Gadbad-jhala is a (ladies) market to get cheap bangles and fashion jewellery (not gold).

Everyone in Lucknow knows about the famous tikkas and kebabs. They are Mughal delicacies. Lalbagh, many roadside hotels near Aminabad and old Chowk offer cheap and unique types of dishes.

The Kulfi is exceptionally good. Full kulfi with saffron and faloodah is 100 rupees and the half (which is more than enough for one person) is 50 rupees.

The Food Court at Sahara Ganj, near Hazrat Ganj, is the recent hot favourite with a number of fast food joints. If coffee and tea is something you like, you will find a huge variety at Capuccino Blast at Mall Avenue. At Akbari Gate, during winters one can also enjoy Kashmiri Tea (a red coloured hot tea) with cream and Makhan Malai (a local variant of ice cream, saffron flavoured, made by hanging unsalted butter overnight in dew and then aerating it by beating it).
