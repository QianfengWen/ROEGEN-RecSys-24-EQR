* LA/Ontario International Airport in , about 70 miles to the west of Palm Springs, has many more flight connections and is the next closest large commercial airport. This airport is served by Southwest Airlines.

By train

*Amtrak Station, 300 North Indian Canyon Drive (.6 mi south of Interstate 10), 1-800-USA-RAIL (872-7245), Amtrak's Sunset Limited route connects Palm Springs with Los Angeles and with Arizona and points eastward with three westbound and three eastbound trains per week. Eastbound trains arrive at 12:36am on Mondays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, and westbound trains at 2:02am on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays at the rail station, which is about 3-4 miles north of town, in the middle of the desert. Be aware that there are no rental car agencies that provide shuttles to the Amtrak station in Palm Springs and there is no public transportation available there. The "station" is really just an open platform (though well-maintained) with a plain shelter, no amenities or services available. Taxis from the Palm Springs Amtrak to the Palm Springs airport (where the rental cars are available) cost about $30 (2008).

Amtrak also provides Palm Springs with connections to and from the Pacific Surfliner and Metrolink trains at Fullerton, with 1 roundtrip terminating at Palm Springs, and one more continuing on to Indio. Amtrak also operates connecting buses to the San Joaquins trains, which run up California's Central Valley to the Bay Area and Sacramento, via multiple daily Amtrak Thruway motorcoach runs to and from Bakersfield, 2 round-trips of which go to Palm Springs and Indio.

These Amtrak Thruway bus services have stops at both Downtown Palm Springs (100 Indian Canyon) and at the Palm Springs Int'l Airport. They do not stop at the rail depot.

By car

From , take Interstate 10 east towards , then take the exits for Highway 111 or Indian Canyon Drive. Palm Springs is about a two hour drive from most Southern California destinations if there is not much traffic.

When you see the exit for Highway 111, note the sign for through traffic on Interstate 10 for "Indio" and "other Desert Cities sic" (a rather bizarre way to refer to the rest of the Coachella Valley as well as ). This sign is a well-known local landmark in its own right.

Get around

By car
Rent a car at the airport, or if you want to splurge, numerous limousine services are available, including West Coast Transportation, Cardiff Limousine and A-1 Sahara Limo.
The main drags are Highway 111 and S. Palm Canyon Drive. Highway 111 runs east-west along the mountain side and connects all the cities in the Palm Springs area.

Palm Drive is always busy and is hard to find a parking place on the weekends and at night. You should try to park on one of the side roads if possible. Most of the major car rental companies are represented at the airport.
