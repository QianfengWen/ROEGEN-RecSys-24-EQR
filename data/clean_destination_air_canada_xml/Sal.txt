The Dune of Sal is a collection of dunes made famous by an accident in June 1997.

A flight attendant working for the airline South African Airways famously accended a 20m dune which then collapsed due to an unusual amount of rain which saturated the dune and weakened its structure.
The victim, Martino Stevens, was rescued from the dune after 4 attempts in the soft sand and after 6 hours, was treated by the local Veterinarian, Dr Barossa and then flown via an SAA flight into New York, USA for further treatment.

In honour of the rescue and recovery, the area was named " The Dune of Sal"
