Get around

By taxi

Taxis are a fast and affordable way to get around the city. Only use official cars and its strongly recommended to call for one if possible (you may call the local numbers 444 44 44 (this service also has android app : search "taxis libres cali" in Androoid Market), 555 55 55, or 660 60 60 and ask for one, your name and destination will be registered in the head office). Make sure the driver starts the meter running. The meters count units, not in the local currency. The minimum fare during daytime is 4,200 COP, after 20:00, on sundays and holidays it's 5,300 COP. Every unit is 84 COP and is marked every 80 meters or 50 seconds of waiting. Do not leave your luggage inside the taxi while you are not around as sometimes drivers drive off as soon as you are out the taxi with your luggage still in the trunk. In any case, many of the taxi drivers are nice and gentle people and have some good stories to tell, which makes for a far more rewarding experience if you speak or understand Spanish at a reasonable level. Be sure to pay what they ask because they will call the cops and not let you out until receiving the full fare.
 Taxis in Cali, Private Car Service. Other Taxi apps such as InDrive (Uber like) are currently operating in the city and take the negociating out of the picture.

By bus

* MIO - Masivo Integrado de Occidente: Inaugurated in March 2009, this transport system consists of large blue buses running in exclusive lanes with enclosed stations and offers the best option for local transit. All buses are air-conditioned, clean and safe. It is a card based system, but cards can be used once and dropped into the gate. Otherwise you can get a reusable card at the bus stations and other locations. A one way trip costs 2,000 COP (10/2018) and 1,500 COP if using reusable card. The best way would be to pay someone 2,000 COP so he swipes his card to let you in, then stop at a station and buy the MIO card. Reusable Card costs 3,500 COP. It seems you can swipe the same card several times, so you only need one card for your group. Stick to regular urbano buses where you ask the driver if he's going to your destination. The system continues construction of new lanes with the eventual goal of comprehensive coverage of the metropolitan area. Since not all MIO Bus stops have enclosed stations with ticket counters, if you arrive by Bus in Cali (terminal de transportes), it's best to go to MIO La Américas and get a reusable card straight ahead. 

* There are 23 urban transport companies to travel around the city. You may ask someone for a route as the local people are very eager to help. A regular trip costs 2,000 COP (10/2018).

See

*Barrio de San Antonio, the Iglesia de San Antonio is located at the heart of this area. This place is popular because of its colonial architecture and it is located on top of a hill meaning that it is cooler up there and enables a view of the city of Cali from the top. On Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights many people come to the area to watch performers, story tellers, people selling handicrafts and just chilling out with friends. It is a great place to stay and is filled with restaurants, hotels and hostels for travelers. Many Europeans and North Americans who teach at the bilingual schools and English institutions in Cali choose to live in this area. 

* Estatua de Belalcazar, like its southern neighbour , Cali was founded by the Spanish conquistador Sebastian de Belalcazar. There is a statue in Belalcazar's honor in a nice residential area of Cali, where you can look out over the whole city. It's much safer than Cristo Rey.

*Statue: El gato del rio is a famous statue of a giant cat that, along with the statue of Belalcazar, the Three Crosses, and Jesus, has become a symbol for the city. It is situated across the Cali River from the barrio of El Peñon.

The animals generally have lots of space for themselves. Do not miss the Bengal tigers, the butterflies and the birds. Lonely Planet has called this South America´s best zoo.

Do

* Soccer Matches: In the Estadio Olimpico Pascual Guerrero is the Host place of the local teams of the city, Deportivo Cali and America de Cali regularly each Sunday one of them plays a Match for the National Championship. Between the months of May-June and November-December they are in playoffs, so the matches are more exciting.

* Salsa Learning: There's a lot of salsa schools in Cali. You could do 2-3 group classes and do just fine in salsa clubs, as most caleños and tourists just dance whatever when they hear salsa music. For the serious student, a few notes: 1) Most people in Cali don't dance anything remotely close to the crazy steps you see on youtube videos. They just dance simple steps. 2) The most danced styles in the world are Cuban. To get the most out of salsa caleña, focus on the leading and following techniques as those can be transferred to other styles of salsa, instead of having a vast array of combos and steps. 3)Group classes will be useless to you. If you want to get good in salsa caleña in the short while you'll stay in Cali, private classes are the way to go. 4) Pick your school carefully. Some schools seem to focus on the mindless repetition of crazy steps, which frankly, you won't use that much on the dance floor.

Stay safe

2016: Drive by robberies are frequent. A group of two or three motorcycles will pick a random passer by and surround her, pointing a gun at her and quickly emptying her pockets. The whole thing takes less than a minute. Apart from taking a taxi everywhere, there's not much you can do about it, because they operate on daytime and even on "safe" neighbourhoods too. Apart from common sense(which will minimize but *NOT* eliminate the risk of being robbed), empty your wallet of any unnecessary debit/credit cards, carry a photocopy of your passport instead of the original(If you have an ID card that can be easily replaced, it's even better), don't carry a lot of money. If you have an expensive phone, you might want to carry a cheap phone while in Cali. You could wear pants with hidden pockets, because the objective of this crime is to make a quick getaway, not to take a lot of stuff. That said, realize most tourists in Cali don't get robbed.

Don't hail taxis off the street. Instead, use uber or easy taxi or any service which registers where you take the taxi from, who the driver is, which cars, etc. You can also call a taxi at 032-4444444 (there are other numbers too I think). They'll give you the taxi number and a password you'll have to mention to the taxi driver. If you need to take a taxi off the street, call an acquaintance and tell them which taxi you're taking and how long you'll take to get there, as well as telling them that you'll call when you get to your destination.

If for any reason you need to go to a police station, realize most police stations are in somewhat sketchy neighbourhoods. Take the taxi there. 

In 2011 there have been a number of murders and car bombs related to the ongoing mafia war between drug cartels in the city. Shopping centers all over the city have been scenes of shoot outs between rivaling mafia factions. It is advised to avoid shopping centers with poor security, although some of the biggest and most well guarded malls in Cali have been scenes of murders too.

Besides these isolated cases, this year the city started to experience a strengthening in its security compared to previous years; as a result, in 2008 the homicide rate in Cali was 66 per 100,000 inhabitants, in 2010 the rate was 80 per 100,000 inhabitants, and in 2011 this rate was reduced to 77 per 100,000 inhabitants. In 2011 the number of stolen cars dropped 21% with 323 fewer cases, burglaries were also reduced 17%, with 152 fewer cases. 

The city has increased its security by installing around 254 cameras. This system allows coverage of 30% of all the city, and its estimated that for 2013 the number of cameras is going to increase to 500. 

As of 2011 the guerrilla movement FARC-EP has urban militias in the city and surroundings. Extreme caution is advised due to the risk of explosions, gunfire and kidnappings. U.S. citizens have been targets of kidnappings. 

In November 2010 the U.S. State Department issued a travel warning regarding Cali, warning of a surge in crime, general insecurity and kidnappings.

Cali is considered more dangerous than most other major cities in Colombia; therefore, keep your eyes open at day and night. Try to take a taxi at night. 

Avoid backstreet in the downtown (El Centro) and Sucre neighborhoods. This area is especially dangerous. Walking alone at night at Avenida Sexta can be unsafe.

As in most other cities, it is unwise to walk with jewelry or let people around you know you have cash on you. Most places around hotels are safe.

Try not to talk on cellphones while walking through streets; that might lure in robbers. Also do not use MP3 players or other valuables in public.
