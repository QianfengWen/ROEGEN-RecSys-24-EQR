Understand

Why would anybody want to start a city in the middle of a desert? The answer is, surprisingly, agriculture. The Salt and Verde Rivers of central Arizona were exploited for large-scale agriculture by Native Americans as early as the 11th century. The area that now encompasses Phoenix was a center of the Hohokam culture, which built large canal systems and a network of towns and villages, whose remains may be viewed in the city to this day. White settlers discovered the remnants of the Hohokam culture in the 19th century. The city's name reflects its history as a city "reborn from the ashes" of the previous settlement.

European-American settlement of the area commenced in the 1860s, and in 1911 the completion of the first of several large reservoirs in the mountains north and east of Phoenix insured its success as a center for irrigation-based agriculture. Many tens of thousands of acres were planted in citrus and cotton and other crops, and for many years, intensive, year-round irrigated agriculture formed the basis of the economy. Recent years are seeing a revival, and trendy hotels, bars, shops and restaurants are making it a place to be again.

Mild and sunny winter weather also ensured a thriving tourism industry, and encouraged many Easterners and Midwesterners to relocate to Phoenix. High-tech industry began to flourish after World War II, and since that time the growth of Phoenix has been explosive. As a result, a population of just over 100,000 in 1950 has given way to a 2006 estimate of 1,512,986 (with the metro area estimated at 4,039,182)

Climate

 }}

Phoenix has a hot desert climate, typical for the southern part of Arizona and the Sonoran Desert. The city is known worldwide for its very hot summers, scarce precipitation and abundant sunshine, being the sunniest city on the planet with over 85% of daylight hours being sunny every year. 

Winter: Winters in Phoenix are relatively mild when compared to most of the United States with highs that often reach and surpass 70˚F (21˚C). However don’t be fooled; the fact that Phoenix is located in the middle of a desert valley means that there is a large diurnal temperature variation which results in cool to cold nights between 40-50˚F (5-10˚C). There are a few days with lows around the mid-30s (3˚C) and the peripheral portions of the greater Phoenix metropolitan area do see frost sometimes (areas closer to the downtown are affected by the urban heat island effect thus making temperatures below 32˚F (0˚C) a very rare occurrence). Snow is also an extremely rare phenomenon having happened only 8 times since 1898. 

Spring: Spring is pleasantly warm during its earliest phases (March until early April) with highs around 75˚F (25˚C). However at the beginning of April the first 90+˚F (32+˚C) days occur with the first 100˚F (38˚C) reading usually seen in mid to late May which is virtually part of summer 

Summer: Phoenix’s summers are notorious around the country for their extreme heat with the city having the hottest average high temperature in the US. Daytime highs almost always surpass 100˚F (38˚C) from late May to late September and can occasionally reach even 110˚F (43˚C). The all-time record high of the city is 122˚F (50˚C). While it’s commonly referred to by the residents as dry heat (meaning that because there is little to no humidity it’s tolerable unlike the muggy weather of other major southern cities like Houston or Miami), it can still be a shock to first-time visitors. Unfortunately, due to the city’s buildings, pavements and roads trapping the warmth and releasing it through the night, lows frequently remain above 80˚F (27˚C) (although it may feel like heaven after day of being baked in the sun). Learn more about how to protect yourself and loved ones from the heat in the “Stay Safe” section. Phoenix is also affected by the North American Monsoon in July and August which, when active, raises humidity levels and can cause heavy localized precipitation, flash floods, hail, destructive winds, and dust storms-which can rise to the level of a haboob in some years.

Autumn: Autumn is a short transitional season. September is virtually considered a part of summer with temperatures still rising above 100˚F (38˚C) while October can still be hot with many 90+˚F (32+˚C) readings. Novembers bears many similarities to March with cool nights and warm, sunny days.

Talk
English is the dominant language in Phoenix. However, like much of the with a large Hispanic population, Spanish is very widely spoken in Phoenix. Spanish is a language often used for day-to-day discourse in many places, although English is the language of preference, especially when dealing with businesses and government. It is considered polite or welcomed if you speak Spanish in Hispanic places of business or parts of town where Spanish is spoken more often. However, if you're not sure it is best to simply start with English. Don't assume that someone speaks Spanish based on their appearance as Arizona is a diverse state with a complex history. Arizona is home to a diverse range of Native American tribes with members of all living in Phoenix, most of whom speak English fluently.

*Phoenix Deer Valley Airport () +1 623 869-0975 located just 15 mi (24 km) north of downtown, is the busiest general aviation airport in the U.S.

 Private Aviation 
The The Phoenix Metropolitan Area is home to some of the busiest general aviation fields in the United States, and there are more than 20 airports located within 50 nautical miles of Phoenix, AZ. Deer Valley Airport is the most popular choice for business jets; it's also the busiest private airport in Arizona, and one of the most important business jet hubs in the country. Air charter companies including Valley Jet and Phoenix Jet Charter can arrange private flights with access to charetr planes based at all airports in the Phoenix-area. Other popular airports for private aviation include:

* Scottsdale Airport (; ) It is located 9 miles north of downtown Scottsdale, AZ (15000 N. Airport Dr. Scottsdale, Az 85260)It's one of the busiest single-runway airports in the United States, and Signature Flight Support and Ross Aviation operate the two private terminals.

By train
Due to a dispute among the Arizona Department of Transportation, the Union Pacific Railroad, and Amtrak, passenger train service to Phoenix has been discontinued. Amtrak passengers may disembark at Maricopa, Arizona (25 mi/40 km south of Phoenix) and arrange their own travel into the city. No regular shuttle service currently exists. (Alternative: they may disembark at instead and take a bus into Phoenix from there. The Maricopa-Phoenix route, which uses taxi services, takes about an hour but one likely has to wait for the taxi after calling; the Flagstaff-Phoenix route takes three hours.) (Another alternative: disembark in and take a Greyhound bus into Phoenix; the Greyhound station in Tucson is about 5-6 blocks west of the Amtrak depot.)

Get around

Phoenix is a very car-centered city. With the notable exception of the Light Rail (useful if you are staying in the Tempe/downtown Phoenix corridor, with a stop at the airport) public transit is rubbish and unreliable but if you have no other recourse it is do-able. If you plan to stay or visit any of the cities on the periphery of the metro area, a rental car will likely be required. However, if you plan to stick to the Tempe-Downtown Phoenix area, the Light Rail is a viable option, with an all-day adult pass costing $4.00. Trains run every 12 minutes during peak periods and every 15 or 20 minutes during non-peak periods and weekends. The last train of the day starts its last trip of the day around 11:00PM on most days(finishing its run around 12:00) and 2:00AM on Fridays and Saturdays (finishing its run around 3:00AM). As DUI laws in Arizona are the strictest in the nation, its a good idea to take advantage of "the West's latest running train" when frequenting the bars and clubs in Downtown Phoenix or on Mill Avenue for some weekend fun. Taxis are typically fairly easy to find in proximity to major Light-Rail stops and in popular areas, and will run you from $10-15 for a fairly local trip to well over $100 for a ride to a distant suburb.

The Light Rail is always a much cheaper option than a cab for traveling to central Phoenix or Tempe from the Airport (cabs charge a flat $15 to make the trip). Take the new Skytrain (free)from your terminal to the Sky Harbor stop. Note that the terminal 3 stop is not yet open so you will have to take a shuttle buss. A single ride pass is $2. 

As a tourist, the bus line you are most likely to find useful is the 72 which directly connects downtown Tempe and downtown Scottsdale. It runs frequently throughout the day and can be caught from the Tempe transit center (Tempe->Scottsdale) or anywhere on Scottsdale Road (Scottsdale->Tempe). 

Surface roads are usually easy to navigate. The area's roads are designed around a grid system, where most roads are numbered based on their distance from the city center. Addresses also conform to the numbering of the roads around them. Nearly all streets run with the compass directions, and there's a major thoroughfare every mile in each direction. the road running east & west as Washington St divides the addresses & streets from "North" & "South" while the road going north & south as Central Ave divides the addresses & streets from "East" & "West". The numbered streets running north and south are "Avenues" (such as N 7th Ave) west of Central Ave and "Streets" (such as N 7th St) are east of Central Ave. This also applies to the extended metro area, though addresses in some of the other cities OUTSIDE the Phoenix city limits like Tempe, Avondale, Goodyear, Chandler, Gilbert and Mesa have their own grid system within their own city limits and not based on downtown Phoenix or each other.

There is an extensive network of freeways, most built since 1987. Note: Heavy construction on some segments and interchanges continues. Check construction schedules and closures in the local media.

Drinking and driving is very heavily enforced in Phoenix, especially in Scottsdale and Tempe. Harsh DUI laws & police traps ensure you will most likely be pulled over during peak bar hours 11PM-2:30AM. Mandatory jail time and extremely heavy fines make drinking and driving a very unwise decision in Maricopa County.

* Valley Metro Extensive metropolitan bus system, and light rail line. The light rail line runs from north-central Phoenix, along the Central Ave. corridor, through downtown, past the airport, and to Tempe and Mesa. One-ride or all day passes may be purchased at varying prices depending on service and location; but generally range from $0.85 to $7.25, with the highest being an all-day pass purchased on an Express Bus.

* Car rental is the most convenient form of transportation for visitors, with local companies offering better prices but national chains offering more convenience vis-a-vis return policies and times. At the airport the car rental companies have their own (shared) terminal at 1805 E Sky Harbor Circle From the airport terminals there are shuttle buses going there & back. Sixt Car Hire

* Car Hire In America the term "car hire" refers to hiring a driver & the car, an expensive proposition. For just the car you drive yourself it's referred to as "car rental". See above. Unlike most cities, in Phoenix you can get a sedan, SUV or even a limo to pick you up for about the same price as a cab. People do this if they're staying put at a resort such as the Arizona Biltmore for their entire stay in the area and just need a ride there and back. Not economical if requiring to move around. Ride-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft are also available in Phoenix.

Professional Sports
Unfortunately professional sports events are pricing themselves out of the pocket of the average traveler. There are still $10 seats at the Diamondbacks games, not available until 2 hours before the game. Definitely not the best seats, but worth visiting the downtown Phoenix ballpark- which was built at a cost of $357 million in time for the 1998 season. 

Spring Training Cactus League is a great way to see Major League Baseball in a relaxed atmosphere. 15 teams prepare for the regular season at 10 stadiums across the valley. Teams typically report for their first workouts around the second week of February; games happen daily typically late February through late March.

The Arizona Fall League hosts some of the best young minor league baseball players receiving additional experience after their regular season ends. Played at spring training stadiums in Mesa, Scottsdale, Salt River, Peoria, Glendale, and Surprise. Considering the advanced level of baseball talent on display, tickets are a bargain at $8 per person, or $85 for a season pass which gives a fan access to every game. Early October to mid November.

State Farm Stadium (home of the National Football League's Arizona Cardinals and the annual Fiesta Bowl college football game, among other events) is worth a visit. Originally designed to resemble a coiled snake, it looks more like a giant spaceship by the

Most of the athletic facilities are on campus, with the best-known being Sun Devil Stadium (football), Desert Financial Arena (basketball), and Mullett Arena (ice hockey). Tickets are often more affordable than those for professional sports.

Events
* On the first Friday of every month, hundreds of local art galleries, venues, and shops open up free to the public. This local tradition has been going strong since 1994 and has become the largest art walk in the United States. A great place to see and be seen. (Note: parking at Burton Barr library for First Friday is forbidden, and parking is difficult to obtain nearby. Consider taking the light rail.)

* The celebration takes place annually (April) in the city of Phoenix, Arizona. The festival began as a showcase for feature films made for under $1 million and short films made for under $50,000, however, it is quickly climbing its way into elite status in the film circuit due to its first class treatment of filmmakers.

Drink

Individual listings can be found in Phoenix's district articles

Phoenix as a metropolitan area offers a considerable amount of nightlife, though with the fact that the city is so spread out it can be difficult and dangerous to attempt traversing the city on a big night out. Generally, the nightlife is centered around the sub-cities of the metro area. Within Phoenix itself bars tend to cluster within the Uptown, Downtown, and Roosevelt areas, while Scottsdale offers a lively bar and club scene and Tempe is popular with students given the proximity to the University. and the city centers for Chandler and Glendale both offer some good options if you're in the suburbs. Downtown Mesa lacks any appreciable nightlife given its strong ties to the Mormon church.

Stay safe
Crime
Despite being a nice vacation destination, Phoenix is a major American city and as such does contain a fair amount of violent crime. Some parts of the city (and even a few parts of some of the suburbs) should be avoided at night. Although the central city used to have a somewhat deserved reputation for dangerousness, extensive public and private investment in urban core in recent years has made the area among the safest places in the Valley: as a general rule, the area bounded by the Union Pacific railroad tracks just south of the Chase Field up to Camelback Road and Between Seventh Street and Seventh Avenue is both safe and walkable. South of the railroad tracks is South Phoenix which can be unsafe in some areas. 

Maryvale, a commercial/residential district on the west side of the city of Phoenix (extending north into Glendale as well), has a somewhat rough reputation. 

Most of the suburban areas are safe during day and night; however, parts of Mesa and Glendale can be dangerous at night. Some portions of Tempe, near the main campus of Arizona State University (ASU), have seen assaults in the recent past on a few university students. The ASU campus is equipped with several emergency call boxes.

The Sunnyslope area (north central city of Phoenix) has some homeless and other crime issues but a new police station was recently built at Peoria and 7th Ave which has dramatically reduced crime.

The town of Guadalupe (immediately west of Tempe and bounded by Interstate 10 on the west) is unsafe at night, but is an incredibly interesting Hispanic/Native American community to visit during the day. Be warned though that the speed limit suddenly falls from 40mph to 25mph as you enter the town.

In every portion of the Phoenix area, just use common sense and be aware of your surroundings. 

The carrying of concealed firearms is legal in the State of Arizona without a permit.

Phoenix also has one of the highest car theft rates in the country, with a car stolen every 7 minutes. Always lock your car and remove all valuables or hide them in the glove box or trunk.

Traffic Safety

Red light running is more common in Phoenix than any other city in the country. When the light turns green, always double check to be sure someone isn't entering the intersection from another direction.

Be aware of traffic and speed enforcement cameras at most major intersections. Always anticipate someone attempting to beat the amber light before it turns red to avoid being issued a very expensive traffic ticket (usually in the amount of $300 or more). If you see sudden braking, make sure you're going the speed limit. Sometimes, camera vans are set up on the side of the road to snatch speeders, especially in the Northeastern parts of the Valley.

Speeding, tailgating and aggressive driving are common on the freeways.

While there have been recent, and initially successful, efforts to use technology to reduce incidents of wrong way driving on Arizona freeways, the rate of such incidents has been increasing in recent years. Most wrong way crashes occur during the late night hours (midnight - 4am), happen on weekends, and are fueled by alcohol. Avoid driving in the left lane on freeways during the late night hours, as the (usually impaired) wrong way driver sees this as the right lane/slow lane.

Valley Fever

Coccidioidomycosis (Valley Fever) is endemic to the Valley, and is a dust-dwelling fungus that gets kicked up during dust storms. Most people either don't exhibit symptoms or have a respiratory illness resembling a bad cold, but rarely one can develop a disseminated infection involving the bones, meninges, joints, or connective tissues. This severe illness is more likely to occur in people of African, Asian, Filipino, Hispanic, and Native American descent, and is least likely to occur in European (white) peoples. Immunocompromised individuals (HIV/AIDS, etc) are at particular risk for a severe, disseminated infection. It is incredibly difficult to treat once it sets. If you become ill after your trip to the Valley let your doctor know you were in an area where cocci is endemic. It is better than nothing to stay inside during a dust storm if you are worried about cocci, or to wear a paper mask, but realistically you will inhale no small amount of dust no matter what you do. If you are traveling with your dog be advised dogs can also develop a severe cocci infection, as they tend to huff and roll about in the dirt; it is a common cause of morbidity and mortality among Valley dogs. Again, if your dog falls ill shortly after visiting the Valley, let their veterinarian know where you have been traveling.

Heat Safety

The Phoenix area is well known for its extremely hot temperatures during the summer months. Avoid any type of outdoor exertion during the hottest part of the day, which could start as early as 8am during the late spring through early fall. Fire department rescues are a common occurrence on valley hiking trails during the warmer months due to heat exhaustion and heat stroke, and if you need to be rescued you can plan on being featured on the evening news. A recent change in the law has made bringing pets on Phoenix hiking trails illegal when the outside temperature is over 100 degrees F (38 degrees C). Wear sunscreen if you're going to be outside more than a few minutes, drink plenty of water, and limit intake of caffeinated and alcoholic beverages. This includes carrying extra drinking water in your car in case of a breakdown or crash. Do not ever leave a child or pet inside a parked car, and if the pavement is too hot to walk barefoot, it's too hot for your pet's paws.

Thunderstorms

The presence of the North American monsoon brings with it the threat of thunderstorms, typically between July and September. Common hazards are frequent lightning, briefly flooded roadways, and dust storms reducing visibility to just a few feet. In the Phoenix area monsoon thunderstorms are most common during the late afternoon and evening hours, but can occasionally last overnight and into the next morning if the air mass is particularly moist and unstable. If you see a dust storm approaching pull as far off the roadway as you can (into a parking lot is best), turn off your lights, and keep your foot off the brake pedal. Then wait until the dust moves on and visibility improves. Keeping your lights off prevents anyone behind you from thinking you're moving forwards and possibly hitting you. If you come upon a flooded roadway, it is best to turn around and find another route. Trying to drive through may cause your vehicle's engine to ingest water and stall, or cause your car to float away. It takes as little as 18 inches of moving water to wash away a car/pickup truck. Again, if you need to be rescued, you will likely be featured on the evening news, and you may be required to pay for the cost of being rescued.

Gay and Lesbian Travelers

The area around Central and Camelback in Phoenix has many gay residents and gay-friendly businesses. 7th Ave and Camelback is the unofficial "gay district" and you can see many gay pride flags hanging from businesses. Phoenix and neighboring Scottsdale and Tempe tend to be quite progressive, but know that many suburbs of Phoenix are considered some of the most conservative areas in the country, so expect many looks and maybe insulting remarks in these areas.
