Understand
Akita is the largest city in the prefecture, and as such is the hub for transportation, sports, and shopping. Its longitude is about the middle of the prefecture, and so is reachable from both the north and south.

Climate

In Akita, late June to late July is the rainy season. The spring and summer before and after that tend to have fairly moderate amounts of rain, and are good for outdoor activities. Compared to the southern half of Japan, it does not get the brain-crushing humidity that comes over the country like a thick blanket, but they pay for it with a long, bitterly cold winter. In November, it is common for some cold weather thunder storms to occur -- this is said to mark the end of fall and the beginning of hatahata (a local fish) season. In the winter, Akita sees moderate to heavy snow, though certainly inland areas get more.
