Sports
Omaha is home to the NCAA College World Series Every June, the best college baseball teams from around the nation gather for the College World Series (CWS). The series is always a sellout event, so be sure to plan ahead. As of 2011, the CWS is held at the new TD Ameritrade Park Omaha in NoDo (North Downtown). If you can't make it to the CWS but still want to see quality baseball, take a short drive to the southern suburb of Papillion to catch an Omaha Storm Chasers game at Werner Park. The Storm Chasers are the Triple-A affiliate of the Kansas City Royals, one step down from Major League Baseball. Each September, the River City Roundup takes place. The event includes a festival of events, a professional rodeo, stage shows, expositions, parades, kiddie rides and more. During hockey season, the Omaha Lancers take the ice in the 6,700 seat Mid-America Center across the Missouri River in . The Omaha Beef is Omaha's indoor football team, which plays at the Omaha Civic Center.

The Creighton Bluejays the sports teams of Creighton University, are also a big part of Omaha life. Jays men's basketball especially, played at the CenturyLink Center (formerly Qwest Center), is a big draw for students and residents alike. Creighton also has a great soccer team that plays in one of the best soccer stadiums in the country, Morrison Stadium, located right on campus.

Also, the Omaha Mavericks (currently being rebranded from "UNO" and "Nebraska–Omaha"), the sports reams of the University of Nebraska at Omaha, include a hockey team that is usually a top 20 team. UNO is in the middle of upgrading its entire sports program to Division I; previously, only the hockey team was Division I.

Although the city's two biggest universities contrast greatly—Creighton is a relatively small Catholic school, and UNO is a large public institution—the sports programs have one key feature in common. Neither school has a football team. 

For a taste of subculture sports, check out the Omaha Roller Girls, Omaha's one-and-only flat track roller derby team.

Stay safe
Omaha is generally a safe city. Simply using caution and avoiding any situation in which you are uncomfortable will basically keep you out of trouble. The vast majority of violent crime occurs in North Omaha, roughly defined as the area north of Lake St, between 24th and 72nd St. Exercise a bit of additional caution when in this area after dark. Most crime that occurs in this area is gang related. If you are not partaking in gang activity while there, you should be safe.
In general, use good common sense, and you will be able to navigate without any concern. Number streets run north-south and grow larger as you travel west. During the College World Series exercise caution with valuables in your pockets. Do not leave anything in your back pockets.

Omaha is in Tornado Alley, so severe weather can erupt at any time between the months of April and August with the main threats being hail, high winds and street flooding, but tornadoes can sometimes be a threat. Tornado alert sirens are located throughout the city. At 11 A.M. on the first Wednesday of the month, the sirens are tested. If in doubt, ask a resident. Most are friendly and more than willing to answer. Local stations KETV Channel 7 (ABC), WOWT Channel 6(NBC) and KMTV Channel 3(CBS) break into programming if a severe weather event is in progress. Radio services 1110AM and 590AM also provide severe weather coverage. Be aware that Omaha is within Douglas County in the state of Nebraska, as meteorologists often point out warnings this way.

During winter months, Omaha often sees cold temperatures as well as snow or ice events. Also, be aware that steep hills do exist within the city, and precaution should be taken during slick driving conditions. Blizzards are possible, and the entire city normally shuts down during one.

Get out

Although gambling is not allowed in the state, go across the Missouri River into Iowa to visit to gamble at several casinos including Harrah's, Ameristar, and Horseshoe.

Visit (50 miles west on I-80) to explore various museums and shopping there. Or catch a University of Nebraska football game, with a mean streak of sold out home games. 

The nearby cities of Bellevue, La Vista, Papillion and Ralston also have various shopping areas.

There are also orchards and vineyards in Nebraska City (Kimmel Orchard and Vineyard or Arbor Day Farm) about an hour drive from Omaha.
