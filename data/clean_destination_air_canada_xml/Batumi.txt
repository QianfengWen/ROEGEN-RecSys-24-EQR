Understand

History
Batumi is one of the oldest cities in Georgia founded as early as BC. Its initial form – Batus – had already been mentioned in the 4th century BC. The name must have derived from the Greek word meaning ‘deep’. Aristotle (4th c BC) Pliny (2nd c AD) and others called the place “Pontus Bathea”. In antique times the local population used to have active trade relations with the neighboring as well as distant countries. During the reign of the Roman Emperor Hadrian (2nd c AD) there used to be a Roman military camp on the territory of present Batumi.

Batumi has always been distinguished by a favorable natural and strategic location. From the 18th century Batumi was under Ottoman rule. After the Turkish-Russian war of 1877-1878 and the resulting Berlin Treaty, Batumi became a part of Georgia. In 1878-1886, Batumi Port was announced as “Porto Franco”, something that fostered the further development of the city. After the construction of the Baku – Batumi railway system in 1883, the reconstruction of the Batumi port and connection to Baku via pipelines in 1897-1907, Batumi became an important sea terminal along the Black Sea coast. In 1918 and 1920 the city was governed by the Ottomans and the British respectively.

Batumi's varied past has considerably contributed to the city's architectural diversity, with a number of interesting projects accomplished by European architects during the Porto Franco period. During the soviet and post-soviet period it became a popular seaport and tourist city.

Climate
Batumi is distinguished by a seacoast humid subtropical climate. Winters are cold without snow and summers are warm to hot. The average annual temperature is 15 C, 7 C in January and 23 C in August.

Various types of subtropical plants are spread throughout Batumi and its vicinity. There are many cultivated parks, tea plantations and citrus plantations. Indigenous Colchis natural trees and shrubs have been preserved in select areas around the region.

Most Georgians do not use central heating, so although the day temperature can be warm, bring warm clothes for sleeping at night.

Cuisine
