Corfu, known also as Kerkyra, is the northernmost of the in . Located off of the far northwest coast of the country, Corfu lies in the Ionian sea, east of Italy and southwest of Albania. Historically Corfu has been controlled by many foreign powers, notably the Venetians, French, and British.

Regions and Towns

Corfu Town, known in modern Greek as Kerkira or Kerkyra, is the largest and most important town on the island. This is where the airport is located and where most cruise ships and long distance ferries dock. It is a small, pleasant city catering well to tourists.

The North of the island is wider and more mountainous. The coastal areas are well developed with good pebbly beaches.

The South of the island is less wide (only a few miles across from west to east) and tends to have sandier beaches. It also has a quieter and more genuine atmosphere especially south Messonghi on the east shore or Aloniki on the west shore. 

Benitses is a very old, traditional fishing village. Benitses lies 12 km south of Corfu Town, and leads to the emerald valley. The water of the springs which flow from the mountains of Aghii Deka and Stavros, join together in two small rivers, giving the area the name Pinisse (derived from the ancient Greek word 'Pinio') = Pinitse = Benitses. The mild climate and the natural beauty of Benitses village has attracted a lot of tourists from the beginning of the century. It is only during the last 30 years that tourism has replaced all other sources of income and now is the sole occupation of the inhabitants during the summer season.

Gouvia is 7km north of Corfu Town. It is a typical touristic spot with a narrow pebble beach and does not deserve a long stay.

Messonghi (also known as Mesongí or Messogi). Another mainstream beach spot. You can use it as a base to go and explore the surroundings.

Moraitika The old village of Moraitika is situated about 18 kilometers away from Corfu’s town, being nestled in the hills of the area, while the coastal part of Moraitika boasts a picturesque beach with sand, mixed with pebbles. Along the beach you will find ample entertainment, shopping and dining opportunities, appealing to every type of traveler. Visitors may also enjoy the calm waters, offering safe swimming for children, while adventurous ones can try water sports out and other entertainment facilities. Finally, the area of Moraitika is also a nice base for exploring South Corfu: lots of villages nestled into the hillsides, attractive coves and fishing villages to the southeast and beaches that span many miles to the southwest.

By car
You can rent a car at the airport or through one of many local companies. International franchises such as Hertz have counters at the airport and the main ferry terminals). For your peace of mind, you may opt for one of these as some travellers have had bad experiences with lesser known companies and their so-called 'full' insurance coverages. 
In general, it is cheaper to pre-book a car rental via the Internet before arriving. Many of the roads are very narrow so it can be better to choose a small car. While there is a good road running North-South along the East coast from Sidari to Lefkimmi and from Corfu town across the island to Paleokastritsa, many roads have poor surfacing. Often the insurance provided for hire cars does not cover damage to the underside of the car so watch out for large holes in the road. Car rental companies often provide a free map but you may find it worth buying one in advance as the maps are not especially good, especially for the North-West interior. Unfortunately online mapping tools like Google Maps are not accurate enough to offset the low accuracy of some addresses so it is highly recommended you come with your own GPS device.
Also, be careful to rent Quads in Ypsos. Some local companies have been reported to rent out unsafe and faulty Quads.

*This huge open parade ground and park, just west of the Old Fortress, is bordered on the north by the old royal Palace (now the Museum of Asian Art) and on the west by the Liston, built by the French under Napoleon to resemble the Rue du Rivoli in Paris. Some say the Esplanade is the most beautiful esplanade in Greece.

*Built by the Venetians in 1546 on the site of a Byzantine castle, the fortress is separated from the rest of the town by a moat. Its two peaks ("korypha") gave the island its name. To the west, you have a gorgeous view of the town and to the east the mountainous Albania coast. Most of the Venetian fortifications inside were destroyed by the British, who replaced them with their own structures, like the Church of St. George, built to look like a Doric temple. 

*This elegant 19th century Regency palace, site of the 1994 EU Summit, houses the Museum of Asian Art, a notable collection of Asian porcelains, Japanese ukiyo-e prints, Indian sculpture, and Tibetian temple art.

Nymphes
A big village with a lot of water, green and legends built on a height of 200 meters. According to a legend, in old times, the Nymphs used to bathe in the village's waterfalls. A walk to the wells and the waterfalls is enough to make you understand why this legend exists! It is almost certain that you will come across a nymph, too and if you are lucky, you will see her bathe in the water especially in spring.

After your walk to the myths, it is a good idea to visit the premises of the Agriculture Co-operative which elaborates kum-kuat and produces liquor and sweets. You will be offered some for free and you will have the chance to try the different liquor qualities (and of course, buy some, if you like).

Just outside the village, you can visit Askitario, a small but historic monastery. According to tradition, here lived in the 5th century the monk Artemios Paissios from Epirus, who is said to have worked many wonders.

Achilleion

Achilleion (Greek: Αχίλλειον) is a palace built in Corfu by Empress of Austria Elisabeth of Bavaria, also known as Sissi after a suggestion by Austrian Consul Alexander von Watzberg. Sissi was a woman obsessed with beauty and very powerful but tragically vulnerable since the loss of her only son, Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria in the Mayerling affair in 1889. A year later in 1890 she built a summer palace in the region of Gastouri (Γαστούρι), now the municipality of Achilleion, about ten kilometres to the south of the city of Corfu. The palace was designed with the mythical hero Achilles as its central theme.

Old Perithia
Located in the north east, Old Perithia is Corfu's Oldest Village. A Heritage Protected Site in a Designated Area of Natural Beauty. The village is locates at 408m above sea level and nestles below Mount Pantokrator, it was once a hideaway from pirate attacks with a look out tower from which you could see, but not be seen from the sea. There are 8 churches and 130 houses, some in various states of disrepair, but the village offers an excellent example of the Venetian influence on the island and it is said that Old Perithia was once the wealthiest of the villages.
In its heyday, It had an abundance of oak trees, vines and thousands of sheep roaming the mountainside. As olives would not grow so well at this height, the oaks and vines remained, along with other fruits, cherry, fig, walnut and almond to name but a few. There are a handful of accommodations in the village, the B&B whose original owners (Mark & Saskia) are credited with it recent restorations and as the catalyst and drive behind the revival of what was effectively, a village in decline, and there are also five tavernas - that are open all summer, and at weekends throughout the winter.
The village is located 7km up from the coast road, opposite Ice Dreams, and clearly signposted. Most of the 8 churches are family owned but Agios Iakovos Persis, the church at the (now) entrance to the village has been lovingly restored and contains some remarkable frescoes inside. It opened to the public again in 2020 and held its first ceremony for over 60 years. Parking is limited and there is a no through sign as the village is only accessible to the few residents who currently live or work there.
