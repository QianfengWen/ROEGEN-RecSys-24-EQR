Today Dubrovnik is the proudest feather in 's tourist cap, an elite destination and one of the most beautiful towns in the Mediterranean. Dubrovnik used to be an independent republic, surviving mostly on trade. It managed to survive many centuries, with constant threats to its territory, particularly from the mighty Ottoman Empire and . As early as 19th century, it was discovered by celebrities as a place to be seen. George Bernard Shaw once said that "those who seek paradise on Earth should come to Dubrovnik and find it". Royalty, presidents and diplomats have all favored the city. The late Pope John Paul II was a fan of Dubrovnik and was even made an honorary citizen. Out of the 23 top luxury hotels in Croatia in 2010, 13 were located in Dubrovnik.

This service has no set time table, and instead departs along with flight arrivals - though they're quite well-known to sometimes wait much longer or leave before people have even had time to deplane. The Platanus shuttle operates between the airport and Port Gruz/Main Bus Terminal with a stop in the Old Town (as of 2023, €10 one way, €14 return ticket). The stop for the Old Town from the airport will drop you off at Ploce Gate, the eastern entrance to the Old Town. Taxis from the airport to the centre will cost 320 kn.

Arrive early just in case. The bus passes close to the Old Town en route to the airport and you can board this bus at the bus stop on Petra Kresimira 4 just above the Old Town, by the lower cable car station entrance (not the ticket window, but where you would enter to board the cable car further up the hill) - this is a different location than where you will be dropped off coming from the airport. Make sure you wave furiously otherwise the driver may not stop.

Just know that in the summer months the trip is likely to take several hours longer than anticipated. What looks like a short trip on a map can take 6 hr.

A much faster way of simply getting from Split to Dubrovnik by car is to take the A1 highway to Vrgorac and then continue via Staševica, Opuzen and Neum to Dubrovnik.

By bus

The main bus station is in Kantafig, near Port Gruz and the Tudjman bridge, 2.5 km northwest of the Old Town. Local bus 7 operates between this station and Babin kuk, and bus 1 serves Old Town.

When coming by bus from Split or cities further north, police officers may board the bus and you may be asked for a valid identity document when crossing the corridor which belongs to . While the bus companies list trip duration of approx. 4 hr, be prepared for a ride of closer to 5.5-6 hr, including Bosnian border checks.

When travelling into Montenegro and the Airport sit on the right hand side (not behind driver) for best views, and vice-versa for the return. Travelling to Bosnia, sit on the left hand side (behind the driver) for best views.

A departure listing for the international bus station is available at the website of the city bus operator. Further details can be found online 

On all intercity buses you pay a separate fee of €2 or 10 kn to the driver for luggage. So keep some change ready.

By boat

Cruise ships
Many cruise ships come to this port of call, typically docking at the Port of Dubrovnik (Port Gruz) across from the main bus station, 2.5 km northwest of the walled old town. The easiest and cheapest way to get from the main bus station to the Old Town is by using the local buses number 1, 1A and 1B, which circulate almost constantly. Some cruise ships anchor offshore just east of the Old Town and tender the passengers directly into the the Old Port. In 2010 over 900,000 passengers visited Dubrovnik by cruise ships.

Ferries

Jadrolinija

* From Ferries run up and down the coast. Calling at , , and on the way. Journey time is up to 20 hr, so consider getting a cabin. The restaurant serves up some decent food at surprisingly reasonable prices, but bear in mind that the +23% tax is not included on the menu. While the journey is scenic there is nothing in the way of entertainment. Come prepared with a good book or just sit on the deck and watch the Adriatic Sea go by. This is more than enough entertainment for an afternoon.

* From in Italy. The dull engine vibration or the swaying of the boat from high winds are likely to keep you awake. Cabins are strongly recommended. Although you can sit comfortably enough inside with the cheaper deck pass, interior temperature hovers at 60⁰F or below and makes for a chilly night even in the height of summer. Sadly this ferry seems quite overpriced: two adult single tickets plus a noisy, small interior 2-berth cabin costs €168.

Get around

The Old Town can be comparatively difficult to navigate on first appearances, as it really is a warren of little streets. There are however signs at the entrances to many of these streets advertising what businesses, shops, restaurants and accommodation are to be found in that direction. 

That being said, some of these signs appear to be either intentionally misleading or woefully out of date. For example, there is no office of any bus company within the Old Town, despite what the signs may say.

The city is completely pedestrianised and easily small enough to get around on foot, some of the streets are a little steep though.

By bus

If you are not staying in Old Town, it's relatively simple get there by bus, as just about every one leads to the Old Town. However, it might be advisable to get a timetable just in case. It costs 13 kn (€1.73) for tickets bought at any kiosk,or 15 kn bought on the bus; ticket valid for 1 hr. At selected kiosks (including the international bus station) you can purchase a day pass for 30 kn. This pass is valid for 24 hr of unlimited travel on the city bus network, starting from the first validation. The easiest way to get from the Main Bus Station to the Old Town is by using the (mostly modern and A/C equipped) buses number 1, 1A and 1B, which circulate almost constantly. These buses can be boarded from the bus stop just outside the Main Bus Station. Apart from this, there is another bus service which comes inside the bus station and drops you directly at the Old Town. Schedules are available at the information counter of the Main Bus Station.

Car rental

In the off season, rates can be negotiated down by contacting the company in advance. You will get a better rate doing this than booking online directly. Local companies generally have cheaper rates than the multi-nationals.

* Airport transfers, car, motorbike and scooter rental.

* 

* Cars from €22 per day.

* Cars from €22 per day.

By Bike

You can also get around the city by renting a bike. It is a nice adventure and a cheap way to take in Dubrovnik. The Old Town as well as the surrounding areas have excellent road conditions throughout. If you rent a bike or a scooter to travel around always be cautious and use a helmet, despite it not always being enforced.

* Offer reasonably priced scooter and motorcycles for rent. All riders and passengers are provided with safety gear, including a full face helmet. 

See

Dubrovnik was heavily bombed during the Croatian War of Independence from 1991 to 1995. Almost all of the damage has been repaired; however, if you look closely around the old town, mortar damage in the cobblestone streets and bullet marks in the stone houses are visible.

Like many cities, Dubrovnik has launched a 'city card' that covers access for multiple attractions and public transportation (does not include ferries or the airport shuttle, which are private). The 1-Day Dubrovnik Pass is 35 euros as of 2023, the same cost as a single adult ticket for the City walls, so it's an easy choice to go for the pass rather than paying just for the walls. The ticket includes then, access to a large number of museums in the Old City - but can only be used for one visit to the walls. While not listed on the list of included attractions, the Pass (as well as the regular City walls tickets) also include access to St Lawrence's Fort.

The uniform Baroque architecture of the houses in Placa, with shops on the street level and their 'knee-like' entrances, got its present-day form in the restoration of the City taking place after the disastrous earthquake in 1667, when a large number of luxurious Gothic and Renaissance palaces had been destroyed. The architectural design of Placa reveals effective solutions and the business sense of the Dubrovnik Republic in those difficult times. Today, Placa is still the shopping centre and venue of major events.

Beaches

*(Lapad Peninsula) A car free, sandy beach area on the Lapad Peninsula, approximately 3.5 km from the old town, where you can relax in the shade of the numerous trees. At the end of a long pedestrianised street full of cafe bars and restaurants you will see many popular pebble beaches known as Lapad beaches. These beaches are really beautiful and well used. Lapad is definitely one of the most beautiful parts of Dubrovnik and you really must visit it. If you take the headland path to the right hand side of Lapad beach, as you look at the Adriatic, you can walk along a charming little coast path with small concrete 'beaches' and ladders into the sea. These were put in during the Tito era and are ideal for one or two sunbathers. Walking further along is an excellent local fish restaurant - ideal for ending the day. The walk back is not particularly well lit, but perfectly safe.

*A well located pebble beach. There's a concessioned part with an entrance fee, but also a public part which is always livelier and more relaxed. Great way to beat the heat in the middle of the town. Amazing view to city walls, Old Town Dubrovnik and the island of Lokrum. Beach volleyball, mini football or water polo. You can also enjoy lying on deck chair and having a drink.

Sailing and boat trips

Dubrovnik is an excellent starting point for exploring southern Adriatic coast primarily Elaphite islands, Korcula, Pelješac and Mljet. There are many charter agencies where you can charter a sailing or motor yacht which are based in Dubrovnik. Majority of them operate from ACI marina Dubrovnik (42°40,3’ N 18°07,6’ E) which is based in Komolac. 

When you charter a yacht through charter agency and arrive to designated marina there are a few things that need to be done. The most important thing is the yacht check in (usually Saturday around 4PM). Take your time doing yacht check in. Familiarise yourself with the chartered yacht and with the yacht equipment. 

The rule of thumb is the more time you take for the yacht check in, the less time you will need for the yacht check out. After that you have to do the shopping for the charter vacation. 

Don't neglect the grocery shopping because the sea is unpredictable and you don't want to get stuck on the boat without anything to eat or drink. You can do the shopping in a marina however the prices are usually much higher there, or you can order from yacht provisioning services who usually deliver the products to the marina at no extra fee. 

:*In Jam Yacht Supply, Online provisioning catalog where you can order from a large selection of groceries and other products months in advance and everything you order awaits for you in the marina. This is convenient because it takes the load of you and the things you must do when you arrive at the marina for your sailing holiday.

* Lokrum, Take a ferry to the Island of Lokrum which houses a monastery, a fort with great views of Dubrovnik, botanical gardens and a naturist beach. Preserved as a nature park this small island is reachable in 10 min in boat-time from the old city port. It offers unparalleled serenity, beauty and peace.

* Mljet, Take a day trip from Dubrovnik and visit the most southern and most eastern larger Croatian island. Its northwest part is also a National park – the oldest sea park on the Mediterranean. You can get to Mljet by a catamaran line that departs from Dubrovnik's harbour.

Festivals

* Dubrovnik Summer Festival, Music and theatre festival held since 1949 from 10th July to 25th August.

Buy

As of Jan 2023, Croatia has officially moved to the euro. You'll find prices in Dubrovnik are quite steep, even compared to major 'famously expensive' cities in Europe. If your trip includes stops in other cities, you're more likely to find better prices elsewhere in Croatia, especially for non-artisan products. That being said, if you do find an artisan shop or true handmade items, consider supporting those - the popularity of Dubrovnik has meant that most locals are being increasingly priced out of the area.

There are many local artisans who specialize in domestic crafts. Popular purchases include: handmade tablecloths, linens, lavender products, and napkins. Many merchants claim that the necktie was invented in Croatia. Another local specialty is little dolls dressed in local garb. 

A small market takes place daily in Gundulic Square right by the Cathedral - it's traditionally Dubrovnik's main market but has also unfortunately become victim to local vendors being priced out and is now reduced to only a handful of stands selling homemade lavender products, crafts, honeys and fruit wines - but a great opportunity to support local producers still.

The Pharmacy, at the Franciscan Monastery creates hand creams and other toiletries based on ancient recipes. The pharmacy is one of the oldest in this part of Europe. It has been opperating from the time of its foundation to the present day. 

While wandering around the Old Town, you will come across many shops that sell Croatian goods such as wine and textiles.

If you have transport there is a Lidl (German discount supermarket) 5 km east of the Old Town near the village of Čibača - this is where the locals shop to avoid steep Dubrovnik prices. Otherwise you'll find small, reasonably priced supermarkets (Konzum and Studenpac) just outside the city walls at Ploce and Pile Gate, as well as a few (very small) locations inside the city walls. 

*Small gallery with unconventional art and cool jewellery design.

*Unique handmade adriatic coral, pearl and gems jewellery with certifcate of authenticity.

* This is not a regular bicycle repair shop, however the operator of this local garage offers a service.

Eat

There is a wide range of restaurants in the Old Town, mostly offering a very similar menu of local seafood and some meat dishes. The cuisine may not be very imaginative, but it is usually of good quality and very fresh.

Restaurants can be crudely separated into (slightly) cheaper tourist-trap places, and more expensive but first class gastronomic restaurants. There are a few pizzerias, mostly wood-fired and quite acceptable. The Kraš chocolate sold at stores is delicious. Remember that Dubrovnik, more so than the rest of Croatia, is well aware of its status as a tourist hot-spot. Rents for restaurant premises are high and consequently the prices on the menus reflect this. 

Note that in the off peak season of November-March nearly all the top-end restaurants close, leaving only a handful of desperate tourist trap enterprises operating and still charging high prices. You can however still eat well and discounts can be negotiated.

Dubrovnik cuisine is characteristically not very spicy and is famous for traditionalism. Many popular meals are characteristic of Dubrovnik such as zelena menestra (cabbage and other vegetables with meat), pasticada (braised beef dish cooked in a fragrant sweet and sour sauce), and the famous delicacy dubrovacka rozata (crème caramel custard). Dubrovnik fish restaurants are popular.

Budget

* Large portions. Really good pizza with fresh ingredients. Best to have a medium pizza for 1 person or large if you are really hungry - a large can be split in half for not that hungry couples. Only pizza is served before 17:00, for pasta or other dishes you will have to wait until 17:00.

* Traditional Dalmatian appetizers and meals, you get your meal in a large black fisherman's style pot.

* Good traditional food served in a small outdoor courtyard. Not really budget, but really nice restaurant with different types of food.

* One of the best pizzerias on what is becoming a 'pizza street'. Go for pizza or a coffee and brandy and exchange banter with the staff.

* Dubrovnik's first and only vegetarian restaurant, with vegan and gluten free options available upon request.

* Limited but good menu, including pizza and some very enjoyable live piano music.

* A very nice pizzeria between Lapad and Babik Kuk with good pizza and very good Mexican food/specialities.

* A small Italian style restaurant in the old town with outdoor seating providing a wide variety of pasta.

* Offers a variety of Bosnian/Eastern cuisine such as Cevapcici u lepinji, baklava, and tufahi. The wait can be quite long, and vegetarian options are often sold out.

* Worth the climb for magnificent views over the old town from the restaurants' terrace and presumably taking it's name from an ancient water feature just outside the restaurant (not for the prudish). Grilled fish with vegetables 110 kn, grilled chicken with fries about 70 kn, salads etc. Be prepared to wait for a table with a terrace view as is very popular with locals - alternatively arrive before 8 in the evening to avoid the busiest times. Beware of wasps!

Mid-range

* Dalmatian cuisine in an excellent location. Has some good vegetarian options. The baked moussaka especially is worth a try

* One of the best for a variety of ways of serving steak. Also serves traditional Dalmatian fare.

* Variety of quality domestic and foreign wines, cocktails, homemade ice cream and desserts.

* Tasty Italian food and inexpensive wine. Try the lobster and prawn ravioli.

* Good seafood.

Splurge

* A new and rather over the top venue located in the Old town of Dubrovnik with stunning views of the old harbour. The restaurant offers ultra modern French cuisine and a wine and digestive cellar. A lounge bar has fresh cocktails and funky DJ music.

* Great views of the sea and Old City. Pay attention to the menu prices which switch from Kuna to Euro throughout.

* Spacious terrace, just outside the Pile gate. Offers international and Croatian cuisine.

Drink

The most popular hard alcohol in Croatia is home made rakija. This is a very strong distilled drink made from a variety of fruits. Examples include sljivovica, made from plums, loza, made from grapes, and orahovica, made with walnuts. All are quite strong.

There are many excellent local wines from both the Peljesac Peninsula and Konavle and it is often less expensive than soft drinks like Coca Cola. However, be careful when purchasing wine from unlicensed dealers. Though the price is very attractive with some being as low as 10 kn or €1.5 per litre it can sometimes be of low quality. 

Cafes

There are numerous cafes throughout the Old Town and the entire city with prices varying according to the location (particularly, those located on the Stradun are by far the most expensive but you are paying for the ambiance and people-watching as well). Most cafes serve a wide variety of drinks all day.

Bars

Walk towards the sea from Stradun near the Ploce gate, and you'll hit a tiny square with outdoor seating by 4 or 5 different pubs, with live music playing, and large cocktail pitchers with very low alcohol content.

* The tables and chairs are set out on the side of the cliff and the beers are served in bottles and plastic cups. You can sunbathe on the rocks or do some cliff-diving but do watch for rocks below. This is lovely in the evening, when the sun is setting and you gaze over at island of Lokrum. Eclectic chilled out music plays unobtrusively in the background.

Get out

Dubrovnik is a common stop for multi-city trips in the region, and is often used as a hub for day trips to nearby destinations, especially Kotor Bay in Montenegro, Mostar in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the Elaphite Islands. These day trip tours are run by a relatively small number of providers and tend to be quite steep in price. They manage the convenience of transportation but are frequently quite 'barebones' on actual tour information and can spend a lot of time on hotel pick-ups of other guests, extended wait times at the border, etc. Coach tour bus trips from Dubrovnik to Kotor Bay and Mostar typically run for ~55 euros per person for the 1.5 hr and 2 hr trip respectively. Small group tours in vans with up to 8 guests will run higher, typically around 85-90 euros for Mostar and 150+ euros for Kotor Bay. The drive is quite straightforward for both, and often faster at passport control for passenger cars - so if you have the appropriate license and are comfortable driving - it may be cheaper and easier for you to rent a car and then a tour at the destination rather than book transport via a tour company.
