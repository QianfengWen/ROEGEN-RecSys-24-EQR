Understand
A former Viking site on the island of Gotland, Visby was the main centre of the Hanseatic League (German trading federation) in the Baltic from the 12th to the 14th century. Its 13th-century ringwall and more than 200 warehouses and wealthy merchants' dwellings from the same period make it the best-preserved fortified commercial medieval city in northern Europe. In 1995, the city was declared a site.

During the Swedish summer Mid June - Mid August, Visby is crowded. It is one of the best party cities in Sweden in the summer. Many Visby residents leave during these hectic months and rent their apartments. During the rest of the year, it offers a peaceful experience with helpful and friendly locals and an abundance of restaurants with very high standards. The off-season is a great time to experience the heritage, architecture, museums and parks. Not to mention the surrounding nature reserves, the ocean and its beaches (August- september are still great for swimming in the ocean).
