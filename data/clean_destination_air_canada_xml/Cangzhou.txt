Cangzhou (沧州 Cāngzhōu) is a city in province, China.

Understand
The city has historically been known in China for its wushu (Chinese martial arts) and acrobatics (specifically, the Wu Qiao school). Cangzhou is also famed for its historic thousand-year-old 40-ton sculpture, the Iron Lion of Cangzhou. The sculpture is reportedly the largest cast-iron sculpture in the world, cast in 953 in the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Cangzhou, though predominated by the Han Chinese majority, is home to a sizable population of the Muslim Hui minority.

Get in
Cangzhou is only 90km from Tianjin and 180km from Beijing.

Get around
There are two train stations in Cangzhou - Cangzhou Station (沧州站 Cāngzhōu zhàn) and Cangzhou West Station (沧州西站 Cāngzhōu xī zhàn). Cangzhou West Station is the more modern of the two and is for high speed trains. The distance between the two train stations is a little over ten kilometers and they are both terminal stations for bus 402, with the journey taking roughly 30-40 minutes.

There are also two long distance bus stations, the West Bus Station (沧州西客运站 Cāngzhōu xī kèyùn zhàn) and the East Bus Station (沧州东客运站 Cāngzhōu dōng kèyùn zhàn). The West Bus Station is closer to Cangzhou West Station and is also a bus stop for bus 402. The East Bus Station is within walking distance from Cangzhou Station.
