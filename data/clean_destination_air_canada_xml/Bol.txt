You might see Bernie Ecclestone arrive on his yacht or catch Goran Ivanisevic wandering around (he has a house nearby). The old wine cellar (Podrum) is a beautiful venue for couples and large groups alike when you would prefer to eat indoors, or try Maza and Topolino for squid pizza (50 kuna, around £6). In the restaurants in Bol you can try famous island brac lamb as well as the fresh fish that local fishermen bring everyday on the market.
