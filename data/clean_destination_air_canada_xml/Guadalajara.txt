Guadalajara is the capital city of the central state of in . It's also the second-largest city in the country and considered a colonial city, although much of its architecture dates from the independence period. Despite having a far more relaxed feel than the center can still seem a bit stuffy and dusty, especially during rush hour when the sun is out. However, it is still a lovely city and contains many nice areas for walking, not just in the city center.

Districts

* Sector Juárez -- southwest central Guadalajara, with plenty of shops and 2 malls (Centro Magno and Galerias, encompassing the Minerva and Chapultepec commercial zones.

* Sector Hidalgo -- northwest central Guadalajara, a largely residential area encompassing the financial district and the country club.

* Sector Libertad -- northeast central Guadalajara, a largely industrial zone. The southwest part of the sector is pretty close to the historic downtown, there is a traditional market (Mercado San Juan de Dios) and Plaza de los mariachis where you can find traditional Mexican music.

* Sector Reforma -- southeast central Guadalajara, also a mostly industrial zone. Parque Agua Azul, a large park with many trees, an auditorium, and a lake. On Saturday mornings there's a street market, the Tianguis Cultural, where you can buy alternative clothing and articles such as spiked belts, black trench coats, military uniforms, used books, and trading cards for a fair price.

* Centro Historico -- the historic downtown. Most of your time will probably be spent here. It is filled with colonial-era buildings. It also boasts several important mural paintings by Jalisco-born José Clemente Orozco, one of Mexico's most important artists.

* Zapopan -- (pronounced "Za-PO-pan") is both a large municipal region comprising much of the western edge of metropolitan Guadalajara and the small old town center of Zapopan northwest of the Minerva-Chapultepec area. Zapopan the region comprises several shopping malls (Plaza Patria, Plaza Galerias, La Gran Plaza, among others), the Mercado del Mar (Sea Market) where you can eat fish and seafood for a reasonable price, as well as downtown Zapopan where you can find many bars and cantinas. South of the downtown, there are rich neighborhoods, night clubs such as White Lotus and Bossé, restaurants, three private universities (Universidad Autónoma de Guadalajara, Tec de Monterrey and Universidad del Valle de Atemajac - UNIVA) and several shopping malls (Plaza Pabellon, Plaza del Sol). Zapopan actually is the largest municipality in the State and also has several parks (Los Colomos, Country Club) and a forest (La Primavera)

* Tlaquepaque -- south and southeast Guadalajara, offers an old town Tlaquepaque area with a Mexican village setting. It has an important shopping district as it is a main arts and crafts center within Mexico. The old town offers many interesting restaurants, galleries, a regional ceramics museum, and a "Premio Nacional de la Ceramica" (National Ceramics Awards) museum. There is a large variety of shops where you can buy local pottery and handicrafts, including indigenous Huichol artisanship. "The Parian" is a square building in the heart of its downtown that houses a collection of 17 restaurant bars and at the center has a traditional kiosk where mariachi groups and singers play for patrons. It's a great place to enjoy a cool drink on a hot day and listen to good music in a very Mexican setting. Tlaquepaque is about 30 minutes from Guadalajara's downtown and about 20 minutes from the airport. A private university, the ITESO, lies in southern Guadalajara.

* Tonalá -- eastern Guadalajara, where you can also buy handicrafts. Besides, there is a huge park, the Parque Solidaridad.

Understand
Guadalajara is divided into several districts. The main areas of interest to tourists are the Centro Historico and the Minerva - Chapultepec - Zona Rosa areas. These are located on an East-West axis centered on Av. Vallarta (named Av. Juárez in the Centro Historico) and stretch from the Plaza Tapatía/Plaza Mariachis on the East side to the Fuente Minerva/Arcos Vallarta on the West side. Outside of the downtown area are three areas also of interest to the tourist: Tlaquepaque, Tonalá - located SE of the center and known for their handicraft shops and markets, and Zapopan - located NW of the center and famous as a site of pilgrimage and for its old-town charm. Conveniently the 275-diagonal bus route runs from Tlaquepaque through the center to Zapopan, providing convenient access to all of these sites.

Climate
Guadalajara has a humid subtropical climate, typical to central , and with a strong seasonal variation in precipitation. 

The dry season is slightly longer than other Mexican cities in the south and the coast and lasts from November to May. It is marked with pleasant days and cool nights between November and February and hot days with warm nights in March, April, and May. From late December to early February the city can experience some chilly nights with temperatures below 10°C (50°F), but temperatures below 5°C (40°F) are very rare and days usually remain around 25°C (75°F). Snow is extraordinarily rare with 3 known occurrences: in 1881, 1997, and 2017. The lowest recorded temperature is -1.5°C (30°F). The weather gets really hot from late February to late May with daytime temperatures hovering around 32°C (90°F) but with low humidity. The mercury can surpass 35°C (95°F) when the city is hit by a heatwave but such periods are short and don't occur very often. The highest recorded temperature is 41°C (105°F). That's because the city's altitude isn't high enough to protect it from heatwaves and high temperatures like cities located further (e.g. and ). 

The wet season lasts from June to October and features moderately high temperatures and lots of rainfall, mainly concentrated in July and August. The amount of precipitation isn't as large as cities on the coast (e.g. ) but the city still receives over 1,000 millimeters (39.4 inches). Temperatures are lower than March-May, at around 27°C (80°F), but the humidity is much higher (the average in August is 71%).

A rose by any other name: Tapatío / Tapatía
Some local vocabulary: a Tapatío (masc.) or Tapatía (fem.) is a resident of Guadalajara. Alonso de Molina, a colonial-era Franciscan, argued that in Nahuatl the word meant "the price of something purchased." However nobody would call themselves that, and Nauhatl was never spoken in the region. Latter-day etymologies have struggled to come up with any credible account. So one might as well just take it as a fact: natives of Guadalajara call themselves Tapatío/as. One possibility is the corruption of the town name, Tlaquepaque, with the easier to pronounce Tapatio.

Guadalajara's history
The cofounders of Guadalajara were Doña Beatriz de Hernandez and Governor Cristobal de Oñate. In Plaza de los Fundadores there is a monument in honour of both of them.

Guadalajara and Jalisco in general were the centers of the Cristero Wars (1926-1929), a rebellion by catholic guerillas against the secularizing reforms of Plutarco Calles's presidency. One of the first armed conflicts of the rebellion took place in Gudalajara in the Church of Our Lady of Guadalupe (3 August 1926), where a group of several hundred cristeros engaged in a shootout with federal troops. Guadalajara itself was attacked (unsuccessfully) by the Cristero armies in March of 1929.

In the 1950s Av Juárez was widened to create the arterial axis of Juárez-Vallarta which you see today. A famous part of that work was moving the central telephone exchange without disrupting service. Pictures of this feat of engineering can be seen in the City Museum.

In April 1992, the Reforma area was rocked by a huge explosion of gasoline, when a gasoline pipeline leaked into the sewers over a period of days until the fumes finally detonated. Some 200 were killed and several thousand injured. The explosion affected mostly the working class and industrial sector on the Southside of the city.

In May 1993, Cardinal Ocampo of Guadalajara was killed at the Guadalajara airport. Though at the time the murder was thought to have been some sort of politically motivated assassination, subsequent investigations favor the theory that the cardinal was caught by mistake in drug-related violence, his motorcade having been mistaken for that of a drug lord. Cardinal Ocampo is buried beneath the high altar of the Guadalajara Cathedral, probably because his murder was initially fêted as political martyrdom rather than as an accident.

Contemporary Guadalajara
Guadalajara is one of the fastest-growing metropolitan areas in the country. This growth has been driven in part by the booming electronic industry in the city's industrial outskirts. Other important and growing industries are pharmaceuticals, food processing, and fashion.

The University of Guadalajara, often referred to simply as "U de G" ("OOO day HAY") is Western Mexico's most important institution of higher learning and Mexico's second most important after Mexico City's mammoth UNAM. The University also serves as a center of cultural activity enjoyed by residents and tourists alike, such as the Ballet Folclórico and the Cineforo Universidad.

Club Deportivo Guadalajara
Guadalajara is home to three professional soccer teams, Estudiantes], Atlas], and the biggest, Club Deportivo Guadalajara, known popularly as Chivas.

According to Fifa.com, Chivas is Mexico's most popular team. The team has won 11 first division titles and holds the longest winning streak at the beginning of the season with 8 back-to-back wins. Chivas is the only soccer team in Mexico to only have Mexican players while other teams have different players from different backgrounds. The team colors are red, white, and blue which mean "Fraternity, Union, and Sports". The new stadium, Estadio Akron, opened up on July 30, 2010, holding a capacity of 49,850.

Guadalajara holidays
*Founding of Guadalajara is celebrated on February 14 because it was founded on 14 February 1542.

*Day of the Mariachi is celebrated the first week of September. A gathering of Mariachis from all over Mexico and even some parts of the world gather in Guadalajara usually at Teatro Degollado and the surrounding area to play. It is very unique and you won't witness something like this anywhere else.

*Romería de la Virgen de Zapopan is celebrated in Guadalajara on 12 October to honour the Guadalajara area's local Virgin Mary figure, la Virgen de Zapopan. On this day over one million people parade the famous statuette from the downtown cathedral to its home in the Basilica of Our Lady of Zapopan. This day is only celebrated in the Guadalajara area and is one of the largest examples of a Romería outside Spain.

Get in
By Airplane

Libertador Miguel Hidalgo International Airport () is located south of the city along the Guadalajara-Chapala Highway. Along with Mexico's main domestic carriers - AeroMexico, Volaris, and VivaAerobus - other major airlines, including Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Copa Airlines, Delta, and United (has the largest number of flights to the US) also serve Guadalajara. 

The two airport terminals have now been consolidated into one, and GDL has become one terminal airport.

The official airport taxis are white with a green and a red stripe and cost about 300 pesos to downtown Guadalajara, priced by zones. A discounted shared service is also available, ask for it at the taxi ticket booth inside the terminal.

A taxi down to the Lake Chapala area around Ajijic or Chapala will cost about MXN380. At the airport always buy the taxi chit from the booth before exiting the terminal. Present the chit to the licensed driver.

A digital platform car can also be requested for pickup generally at the roundabout with the flag near the car entrance to the terminal driveway.

You may also rent a car from Airport, most major car rental companies such Avis, National Car Rental, Hertz and Europcar have booths at the baggage claim area. There are also some local car rentals such Veico Car Rental and Mobix Car Rental located just outside the airport, they also have good cars and often lower prices.

You can also easily go to the city center by bus if you don't have too much luggage. 

The bus stop is located by the UPS building. To get to it, walk to the right as you exit the terminal building.

The Chapala buses that are white and red leave approximately every 30 minutes and go to the old bus station (central vieja) near downtown Guadalajara. The fare is 10 pesos paid to the driver (May 2021.) Confirm with the dispatcher at the bus stop or the driver that the bus goes to Guadalajara and not to the village of Zapote which is in the opposite direction. Depending on local traffic, it will take about 40 minutes to get to Guadalajara.

The red bus T13-A-6 operates 6am-9pm, runs approximately every 10 minutes, and takes you to Av. 16 de Septiembre and Av. La Paz, roughly in front of Sears department store. To get back from Guadalajara to the airport, pick it up at the same spot, or at the corner of Av. La Paz and calle Comercio. (When the work is eventually finished on Leandro Valle bus exchange point, the bus stop will move there.) 
The fare is 9.50, coin or MiMovilidad card only. As with Chapala buses, at the airport make sure the bus goes to Guadalajara and not Zapote.

The green electric bus C98 operates 5am to 10pm every 30 minutes, and runs a rather lengthy route along Periférico to Calzada Federalizmo, where you can transfer to train's Línea 1 at the Periférico Norte station. 9.50 fare, coin or card.

The more adventurous can walk all the way to the Guadalajara-Chapala highway where they can access plethora of local buses running in both directions.

By Bus

The new main bus station called Central Nueva, is in the suburb of Tonalá, which serves all routes further than 100km or so, generally those which leave the state of Jalisco. The bus station consists of 7 "terminals" called modules, each hosting several bus companies. It is possible to walk between modules. The easiest way to get to and from this bus station is by the modern Line 3 of the light rail. The station is called Central de Autobuses and is the last stop. It is located near module 7 and it will get you to downtown Guadalajara in about 15 minutes. Additionally, there are several city bus lines passing through the bus station. You can look up the bus lines online, on the rutas gdl website, or on the move website. The train and most buses will charge you 9.50 pesos. A taxi from the new bus station to the Centro Historico will cost around MXN200.

The old bus station just south of the Centro Historico, called Central Vieja, is served by bus lines motoring to nearby pueblos like and . A taxi from the new bus station to the Centro Historico will cost around MXN200, or you can get a city bus which will cost MXN7 unless you get a TUR bus which costs MXN12, just ask for 'center.

There is a cluster of bus terminals at Avenida Aviación and highway Guadalajara-Tepic called Terminal Zapopan serving several bus lines. From there you can take the Sitren Bus Line 1 (they depart from the new Elite/Futura terminal) to the Avenida Chapultepec or to Avenida Hidalgo, close to the Plaza Expiatorio. These red buses cost 9.50 pesos. So pay with the Mi Movilidad card or with coins (no change). Taxis and digital platforms are also available.

Get around

The Centro (downtown) is mostly accessible by walking, assuming you are capable of bearing your own weight. Most attractions lie within an area of about 3/4 of a mile long by 1/4 mile wide. For longer trips, or to get in and out of the Centro, use the bus, subway, or a taxi. There are also horse-drawn carriages (calandria), which are more expensive and mainly for tours of the center, for those who want to travel in a previous century's style.

By bus
The Guadalajara bus system is vast and in some way covers most neighborhoods of the metropolitan area. However many drivers drive erratically and recklessly and often engage in "races" for fares. This situation results in uncomfortable rides, frequent accidents, and unfortunately dozens of fatalities each year. The government has been trying to address the problem by linking fare increases to improvements in service by the transportation companies. The results have been mixed at best. The current efforts are converting the old model of "driver-bus" to a new one, "route-company," or "ruta empresa." 

Over the last few years, the mix of irregularly numbered lines was consolidated under the Mi Transporte umbrella, and the lines were given new numbering typically consisting of a letter (A for feeding, T for truncal, and C for complimentary) and a number. However, old numbers are not easily forgotten and they are still in use along with the new number. The system is still so complicated that even most regular users will only be familiar with a few routes.

The buses will run every few minutes from approximately 5 am till 11 pm, but some routes stop running earlier. There is no nighttime bus service in Guadalajara, and signs that indicate the existence of such service that can still be seen around the city are old and should be ignored.

Moovit smartphone application is quite good at finding you a route. Another smartphone application called RutasGDL can also be used to find a route that goes to or near the desired destination.

As of 2021, regular buses cost MXN9.50; there are Mi Movilidad card readers on most routes, and fare in coins is also accepted (no change). On most buses, there is a light sign on the front window that shows the route number, and a list of served landmarks flashes next to it. Additional route information may be on the window. Confirm your destination with the driver if you're uncertain. Riding the bus also provides a good chance to see different parts of the city and get your bearings.

It can be hard to spot bus stops in Guadalajara, in theory, there should be a signpost with a blue sign and a picture of the bus as well as triangular markings on the road with the word 'Parada' meaning stop. However, these aren't always there or the markings have been removed with time. Look around and see where there's a crowd of people waiting, sometimes there are even seats, if not, the buses might stop at the corner or in front of traffic lights. If they drive past you, keep looking at them and try to see where they stop.

A new bus service named 'Sitren Línea 1' goes from the main (Juárez) subway station through the Zona Rosa, Minerva, Gran Plaza shopping mall, Galerías shopping mall, to the west Outer Ring near the small Zapopan bus terminal. The fare is 9.50 pesos (Mi Movilidad card or exact change) and is discounted 50% for card users who transfer between light rail and Sitren. It provides a good service with new, red-colored units. The service is better than the smaller 'camiones' (bus) service, however with worsening traffic the time between vehicles may increase and they may become frustratingly crowded, especially in late afternoons. The bus stops only at red/white Sitren stop signs.

Another particularly useful route for getting back and forth between the Centro Historico and the Zona Rosa - Minerva area is the trolleybus Sitren Línea 3. 
The vehicles are new and can function even if a detour is necessary from their electrical lines (they do happen and you may be waiting for a trolleybus that never comes.) Westbound it travels along Av Vallarta and Eastbound along with Av Hidalgo. Just lookup for the pair of electrical cables that it uses for power. In the Centro Historico you can catch it on Calle Independencia rougly behind Rotonda or Mercado Corona before it turns left and right to continue on Avenida Juárez/Vallarta. This route accepts exact change (9.50 pesos) or Mi Movilidad Card that can be used in the light rail system and Microbus. The trolleybuses will only stop at designated stops which are marked by a white/red Sitren sign (some of them are shared with Línea 1.) There are other bus stops on the route which are for other lines, and neither Línea 1 nor 3 will stop at those.

On Sunday mornings until 2pm Avenida Juárez/Vallarta is closed to traffic because of the vía recreativa (bicycles and pedestrians only). During those hours westbound Línea 1 runs on calle Morelos and the trolleybus line 3 doesn't run at all.

There is also an open-top double-decker tour bus (TuriBus) that leaves from the Rotunda and will take you past all the main sites in Guadalajara, Tlaquepaque, and Zapopan and will also allow you to ride it all day, getting on and off as you will.

Lastly, there is a Microbus route that runs in dedicated lanes along Independencia from Parque Mirador in the north to Fray Angelico in the south. The bus comes every 5-8 minutes. The cost is MXN$9.50 one way except for transfers from the subway at San Juan de Dios which are half price. Please note that some of the buses are express and do not stop at all stations so pay attention or your bus back may not stop at the station you need.

You should be able by now to use the Mi Movilidad card on trains and most buses in the city. The easiest way to purchase it is at the light rail stations in a vending machine. Those vending machines are also the best place to add value to the card. Businesses that will do it are few and can be hard to find. You can also add value to the card on the bus card reader (which also deducts the fare), but the steps are very specific depending on the type of machine, and unless you're a pro, you may be testing the patience of the bus driver and fellow passengers.

By taxi
Taxis are another option if you don't want to try to figure out the buses. You can either agree to a price with the cab driver or ask him to turn the meter on. Using the latter option, there is a risk that the driver will refuse to do it (seems to be the way they operate these days), or won't take the shortest possible route if he thinks you don't know it yourself. The meter will normally be a better price than the price the hotel will tell you to pay if they hail. As always, be sure to ask the fare before you get in. Cabs cost more at night or when they have to cross the outer ring of the city. Day-time fares should never exceed MXN100 within the city and almost always the price should be even under MXN50. At night-time, the prices are doubled. As a rule of thumb, during the daytime, the fare is about MXN3-4 per kilometer, and at night about MXN8-9, but if the driver is using a meter, there's also a starting price of around MXN5-10.

Fares to and from the airport are around MXN300-330. If arriving at the Guadalajara airport, a taxi monopoly provides the service from the airport. Pre-purchase your taxi ride at the booths outside of the arrival halls. You can take a normal taxi to the airport, though.

Several shared-ride platforms and online taxis are now available in Guadalajara; Uber and DiDi being the most popular. While the service was noticeably better than taxis when they first arrived, it often is not the case anymore, as the drivers are picking up the old cab tricks. If you are not familiar with the route, please follow it on your phone, and insist that the driver follows a reasonable path. Also, make sure the driver correctly terminates the ride when you arrive at your destination. The driver may also tell you the credit card payment did not go through and ask you to pay cash. Always verify your e-receipt and in case of any irregularity please file a complaint with the platform and you should receive a fair refund. At the same time feel free to reward an honest driver.

By subway
A simple light rail network can be useful if you happen to want to travel along its currently limited path. There are two lines that join at the Western edge of the Centro Historico. One runs North-South beneath Avenida Federalismo to the edges of the city in both directions. The other runs East through the Centro Historico to the Eastern suburbs. Fares cost MXN7. Fare payment is with Innova card which can be purchased or recharged in vending machines at all stations. Single tickets (Univiaje) is also available. The service ends at 11pm.

A new light rail line (Línea 3) is operational as of September 12th, 2020. It runs mostly as an elevated train, except downtown Guadalajara where it runs deeply underground. It connects downtown Zapopan with downtown Guadalajara, runs close to downtown Tlaquepaque, and ends at the new bus terminal, providing extremely useful connections for visitors.

By bike
There is a public bike system.

* The system works fairly well. you'll pay 365 pesos for a year, shorter rentals are also possible but more expensive. You can use the bikes for 30 minutes or for 45 minutes on Sundays or ust make sure that you'll stop at a Mibici station before your 30 minutes pass by, park your bike and immediately take it again, then you can use it for another 30 minutes. for registering you need to visit a Mibici office and you'll need your passport and a credit card. Another important thing to note is that you can't take a bike out after midnight.

Centro Historico Sights

* Guadalajara Cathedral Construction started in the 1560s and took about 50 years to complete. The current towers were replaced in 1854 by architect Manuel Gomez Ibarra after an earthquake destroyed the originals in 1818. While visiting the Cathedral a must-see is the mural "The Assumption of the Blessed Virgin" by Bartolomé Esteban Murillo. The cathedrals architecture is an eclectic mix of gothic, neoclassical, and Palladian architecture.
* Plaza of the Crosses. Four Plazas shaped like a cross with the Cathedral at the center. Any of these offer a nice spot to walk through or rest in for a few minutes. Most have plenty of food vendors nearby.
* Plaza Guadalajara west of (in front of) the cathedral has a circular fountain and an outdoor restaurant, under the fountain there is an underground commercial center which offers all kinds of goods for sale including fruit, beverages, and even jewelry.
* Plaza de Armas south of the cathedral it offers one of the best views of the cathedral and the Palacio de Gobierno (Governor's Office). It features a French Ironwork band stands bought by former Mexican president Porfirio Diaz during 1885 and four States on the corners of the place symbolizing the Four Seasons. The bandstand serves as the performing arena for marching bands but due to its recent use for all kinds of political (soap-box) manifestations, it's guarded by the police 24/7.
* Plaza de la Liberación east of (behind) the cathedral it features two large cup-shaped fountains and a gigantic sculpture of Miguel Hidalgo, the man who signed the Mexican Declaration of Independence in the current Palacio de Gobierno. It also serves as an atrium for the oldest surviving theatre in the city: "Teatro Degollado", and it's the usual spot for massive free concerts.
* Rotonda de los Jalicienses Ilustres north of the cathedral it serves as a mausoleum for important men and women born in Jalisco, it's a bright and busy atmosphere of the park around it contrasts with the serious aspect of the Mausoleum itself. On the southern side (across the street from the cathedral) is the bus stop for the previously mentioned TuriBus.
* Palacio de Gobierno (Governor's Office)(east of the cathedral) This is the historical center of the government of the State of Jalisco. Today it is mostly visited for the murals painted there by José Clemente Orozco. The most famous of these is a huge portrait of Miguel Hidalgo in the vault of the old chambers of the state council.
* Museo Regional de Guadalajara 60 Liceo St. Pleasant museum to spend a few hours in, especially on a hot day when you need some time out of the sun. It features a Mammoth skeleton found on the nearby Chapala Lake.
* Paseo Alcalde

It currently runs some 3km from glorieta de la Normal in the north to Avenida La Paz in the south with plans of further expansion.

To the north you can't miss the Santuario de nuestra señora de Guadalupe, site of pilgrimage on the 12th of December, as well as the lively plaza in front of it which often features public art exhibits.

As you walk south, you will find the lovely Jardín de la Reforma with the Santuario de San José de Gracia, historical presbyterian church El Divino Redentor, casa Álvarez de Castillo, and the historical Casa de los Perros (house of dogs) named after the imposing dog statues, which hosts the museum of journalism. In the Jardín you will also find an 11 meter two storey Jalisco themed carousel, which operates daily from 11am to 9pm and the rides are free of charge.

As you cut through the heart of downtown, you will see la Rotonda de los jalisciences ilustres, palacio municipal (city hall), cathedral, plaza Guadalajara, and Plaza de Armas. 

To the south you will enter the area known as Los dos Templos. The templo de San Francisco de Asís and the church of Nuestea Señora de Aranzazú are remnants of a large convent of San Francisco compound that used to occupy the area.

Further to the south you will find the recently inaugurated Plaza Luis Barragán, dominated by the Guadalajara born architect's statue El Palomar.
* Mercado Corona Avenida Hidalgo just steps from Plaza Guadalajara is a tourist-oriented market that was completely rebuilt after a 2014 fire and reopened in 2016. It features a variety of foods and souvenir items, and the top floor has a wide selection of medicinal herbs and natural health products.
* Mercado Libertad, known by locals as Mercado San Juan de Dios because of the river that used to pass through the area, a very busy multi-story enclosed market, with hundreds of vendors it is the largest in Latinamerica. The market also houses a very popular and very good food court featuring everything from seafood to local favorites like birria (goat stew) and pozole (hominy and pork stew). Great place to get souvenirs. Unfortunately, it isn't the safest place in Mexico, so make sure to always keep a lookout for the purse snatchers and also make sure to go before the late afternoon.
* Instituto Cultural Cabañas, further east from Plaza de la Liberación, is a cultural and art center where the fresco paintings of Jose Clemente Orozco are exhibited and it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1997. The entrance fee will be 70 MXN or 60 MXN if you are a teacher or present a student card (April 2021). Free on Tuesdays.

Do

*Estadio Akron, Located in Zapopan, is a difficult place to reach by public transport, but the most modern stadium currently in Mexico and Latin America. It is close to the Periférico Oriente, so taking a taxi is the best option. Alternatively, use any bus that will go around Periférico and you'll eventually get there, just ask the driver to let you know when you are there since the stadium's visibility from Periférico is very limited. This is the stadium where the most popular soccer team in the city and the whole country, Club Deportivo Guadalajara (also known as 'Las Chivas') plays since 2010. Chivas play here every other Saturday at 19:00, unless otherwise specified. If you happen to be in Guadalajara on a Saturday, you are most likely to find either a Chivas soccer game in this stadium or an Atlas soccer game at Estadio Jalisco (more information below). Big games to watch out for are Chivas vs. Atlas (which can be held on both stadiums, depending on which one is the local team) and Chivas vs. América (the "superclásico Nacional", due to these teams being the main rivals, sort of a "derby"), which are sure to have a sold-out stadium and intense atmosphere surrounding them. This stadium will also be serving the opening ceremony to the Juegos Panamericanos Guadalajara 2011, and many of its competitions.

*Estadio Jalisco, Located in Colonia Independencia, it can be reached by taking any bus along the Calzada Independencia and asking for the Estadio Jalisco. You will almost definitely see it if you look out, it will be on your left as you come from the center. Here the soccer team Atlas plays. Chivas used to play in this stadium until 2010 when their new stadium (Estadio Omnilife, listed above) was finished. During the season there are league games every other Saturday. If Atlas is playing as a visitor, then you can look for a Chivas game at Estadio Omnilife. There are also other games depending on any competitions that involve those clubs, e.g. the Copa Sudamericana, etc. A big game to watch out for is Atlas vs. Chivas, which has an incredible atmosphere, though most games will have an atmosphere worth experiencing. If you are of a nervous disposition, perhaps avoid the upper stands when there is a large crowd as it's known to shake when the crowds begin to jump.

*Estadio 3 de Marzo, Another soccer stadium, located in the Universidad Autónoma de Guadalajara campus in the north of the city. Here the UAG soccer team (universally known as los Estudiantes) plays. As of 2018, they are no longer in the first division. But the stadium is used to host concerts. 

*See a Bullfight, the Plaza de Toros (Bull ring) is located right across the road from the Estadio Jalisco on Calzada Independencia. You might not be able to see it from the bus, as it's hidden behind some trees, so get off when you see the Estadio Jalisco and go in the opposite direction. Bullfights take place every Sunday at 4.30pm from September to Feb.

The details are published ahead of time in local media and on social networks. The festival is extremely popular so be prepared for crowds, but your patience will be greatly rewarded.

*Viva La Tinta Tattoo Festival is an annual tattoo and art festival taking place between 14 and 16 October. There're different tattoo and piercing artists. There're different events accompanying like dance parties, street art, art shows and more. 

*Grito de Independencia (Independence Yell) Traditional Independence day 'grito' or 'yell'. Locals go to the main square and collectively shout when the clock strikes midnight. Generally, the people shout 'Viva' and then 'México' or the name of an important Mexican person, for example, 'Viva Hidalgo', etc.

*Las Posadas (The Inns) Traditional Mexican Christmas practice, recreating the passage of Joseph and Mary through Bethlehem, asking for shelter and being refused.

* Birria Birria is a savory stew made of roast chiles, spices, and traditionally goat, though you will usually be given other meat options like mutton or beef depending on the restaurant. For Birria, the restaurants in the Nueve Esquinas area (a few blocks South of Templo San Francisco) are quite popular (and quite good).

* La Chata, Corona 126 South of Juarez, Very popular and very crowded. Traditional food the way mom used to make it, or so they say. Needless to say, the prices are higher here than in other places serving the same fare, but prices are still pretty reasonable. You can view the menu on their website, but it's a bit annoying. You can have a good meal there for MXN100.

* Fonda San Miguel, Donato Guerra No. 25, about 4 blocks W of the Cathedral. The restaurant is housed in an old convent, with most of the seating in the covered courtyard. It is quite picturesque. The fare is traditional Mexican, including standards like chicken in mole poblano, chiles en nogada, etc.

If you miss American fast food, then you're in luck. Guadalajara has 14 McDonald's outlets.

Drink

Different types of bars are pretty easy to find. There are many more youth-oriented places, along with others, near the Teatro Degollado (Opera House). Nice area. The Americana Area also features a lot of Bars. Another Area is the center of Zapopan, where you have almost 12 bars next to each other. 
Search out a bar with a large collection of Tequilas and taste a great blanca, reposada, and añejo. If you ask for a tequila from Los Altos that is traditional, you will almost certainly get something good. Los Altos is the region NE of GDL where the best tequila is made and it brings up images of tradition, patriotism, and individualism.

*A lively and fun jazz bar, el Primer Piso is open Tuesday-Saturday night. Good music, good food and a red upholstered ceiling are trademarks. Pedro Moreno and Escorza.

*Los Famosos Equipales located on Juan Alvarez 710, Guadalajara, Mexico 44100 is a famous bar that offers snacks to accompany your drinks. One of its famous drinks is named "Las Nalgas Alegres" (Happy Buttocks), which is a pink-colored delicious, albeit strong concoction. A jukebox is playing music at all times which allows you to have a good time.

*Anime Bar located on Avenue Chapultepec Sur, Guadalajara, Mexico 44650 is also a famous bar known for its lit-up bottles on the shelves. The bar has low-key lightning and plays contemporary music.

*Cantina la Fuente in the Centro Historico, very close to the Cathedral. Inexpensive and stylish bar which has a very old cycle on the wall, that someone about 90 years ago left as a deposit to pay his drinks. The bar owner is still waiting for him to come back and buy it out.

Clubs
* Bar Américas 

Guadalajara's most famous nightclub, Bar Américas is both the best and worst club in the city. Located on Av Chapultepec Sur 507, Americana, 44140, it is open 5 nights a week, closing only on Monday and Tuesday nights. There are two large rooms, connected by a narrow corridor with red LED lighting. (Every girl in Guadalajara has a photo in the red corridor on their Tinder profile.) The first room usually hosts local DJs and has a more relaxed vibe. Despite having terrible ventilation, smoking is allowed in this room. The second room is generally more crowded, more energetic, and on Thursday nights it plays host to famous DJs from the underground European scene. (Recent bookings include Mano Le Tough, Charlotte de Witte, Hot Since 82, and Seb Zito). 

Opening time is 11pm and closing time may be anywhere from 4am to 8am, depending on the night and the size of the crowd. Being one of the very few venues in the city that stays open beyond 3am, on Friday and Saturday nights it gets very crowded in the wee hours of the morning. If you want to see world-class DJs and have enough space to dance, Thursday night is your best bet and is by far the closest thing you will get in Guadalajara to an underground European club experience. If you want to get fucked up and/or flirt with members of the opposite/same sex, go Friday or Saturday night instead. The cover is anywhere from 0 to 100 pesos depending on which night and how expensive the DJ is, a local beer costs 35 pesos (although you are expected to tip), and a house spirit is 80 pesos.

The official address is Av Chapultepec Sur 507, Americana, 44140, next door to a Banorte branch, and in this location, you will find a set of stairs leading down into the club and an LED sign in English that says "Music Is Hope". Generally, a bearded homeless man also sleeps here as well, adding a touch of irony to the sign. However, the real entrance is around the corner on Calle Mexicaltzingo.

*Galaxy 

Located on Calle Miguel Lerdo de Tejada 2166, Americana. Features a good range of 90-House music. Very popular on weekends. Free entrance, but drinks are super expensive.

*Genesis 

Located on Av Niños Héroes 125, Mexicaltzingo, 44180. Features 70/80 music, a popular place for gays. Just open on weekends, but rather go there on Fridays, because Saturdays are super full. The Entrance Fee is 50 Pesos, drinks a rather cheap, a beer costs 25 MXN.

*Hard Rock Live 

Located on Av. Vallarta 2425, Local A-8, Guadalajara, Mexico 44160. It is a chain that is linked to Hard Rock Cafe. It is a venue designed for concerts with a capacity for up to 850 people. Local and international bands and soloists come here to perform songs and/or dance. The people who don't come to sing or dance can sit down have a drink and enjoy the music. The Hard Rock live no longer exists, but there are a lot of clubs to go to Mala Noche, Old Jack's, El Muro, or the more spicy Bandida's.

Sleep
Many inexpensive hotels are available in the city center. If you plan to spend much time downtown, don't get a hotel farther away. It's much more convenient to be able to walk back than to need to find a bus back to a less central location (e.g. the Minerva area).

* This Hotel, offers the perfect accommodation for your conventions and business trips to the city. Its located just across the most important convention center of the city, Expo Guadalajara. It also offers spacious and roofed prívate parking lot, cafeteria, high speed wireless internet and safe deposit boxes"

* Quinta Don Jose Boutique Hotel, Reforma # 139 (Tlaquepaque area) 1 866 629 3753, Located in Tlaquepaque which along with Tonala, make up the arts and crafts district of Guadalajara. 15 rooms, bar, pool, small restaurant. Pet friendly.

*By far the cleanest, chillest hostel in the city. If you´re sick of staying in grungy hostels, this is a good choice. Free breakfast, hot showers, super clean and a pool!!. Pay 6 nights, stay 7, student discount, etc. Highly recommended.

Budget

Centro

*One of the only cheap hotels with a good, central location. Cheaper than a dorm room in many hostels. Wifi is poor but you can go to the Biblioteca LARVA down the street to work for free. The rooms vary in quality significantly, so ask to see several different ones first.

* Hostel de María, Nueva Galicia # 924 (Zona de las nueve esquinas ) (33) 3614 6230, Cozy hostel walking distance from down town. MXN170 (MXN160 with an HI card).

* Hostel Guadalajara Centro, Maestranza # 147 (on the corner of López Cotilla), (33) 3562 7520, An excellent youth hostel, MXN125 with a HI card, MXN165 without.

* Hotel la Calandria, Estadio # 100. Very clean and overall nice hotel. Located very close to the old bus station (Central Camionera Vieja) and a Wal-Mart, which is always helpful when you need to get this and that. MXN170 for a two-person room, even cheaper for one person. Nice and highly recommended.

* Hotel la Fuente, Huerto 188 (not far from Mercado Libertad San Juan de Dios). Avoid this small hotel which is a focal point for short-time prostitution.

Around the old bus station (Central Camionera Vieja) one can find very cheap hotels. Try to look around. A 20-minute walk around the area finds surprising results.

Mid-range

Centro

* Hotel San Francisco Plaza, Two blocks East of the Plaza San Francisco, The hotel is centered on two covered courtyards. There are some awful rooms, so it's worth talking to the person you reserve with to see what it will cost to get something on one of the courtyards, on an upper floor, and away from the Northside of the building where there is quite a bit of traffic. Merced is a good guy to talk with about this or anything else. Although he denies being "el jefe", he seems to be in charge. Rooms run about MXN500 a night. Breakfasts at the hotel restaurant are very good. Beatriz, the usual morning waitress, is a bundle of sunshine.

* Posada del Marqués , located 5 minutes from La Minerva, the glorious fountain-monument that symbolizes the city. All rooms are equipped with American breakfast, Air-conditioning, Living room, and Work area. Some of its facilities and services are Wi-Fi access, 24-hour front desk, Baggage storage, Safe deposit boxes, Business center, and outdoor swimming pool. Several places of interest and tourist attractions surround our hotel. Rates start at MXN1,080.

* Casa Venezuela, On Venezuela street between La Paz and Guadalupe Zuno, Like staying in a museum of a traditional Mexican home. Everything about the place is beautiful but there are only a few rooms so you have to schedule well in advance (occasionally there are cancellations - we got lucky and snuck in at the last minute). The breakfast is as good or better than any I've had in Mexico and they're included. The location is Colonia Americana. It's on the outskirts of the actual center but you can walk there (about 15-20 blocks) but right in the heart of the hip area that has all of the bars, universities, and trendy restaurants. I think the rooms are USD70-100 a night. By far, our favorite place in GDL.

* Located in one of the busiest districts of Guadalajara, this hotel offers 137 comfortable and relaxing rooms. Take advantage of the gym, the Nhube restaurant and the meeting rooms available on-site.

Colonia Americana
* La Fe Hotel and Arts at Calle General San Martin 123, phone +52 33 2267 4629 Located in the hub of Guadalajara's trendy Colonia Americana, this is a cozy designer hotel and art gallery in a historic 1930’s 7-bedroom home. Enjoy free continental breakfast and Wi-Fi throughout. Pet-friendly.

A complimentary breakfast is served each morning and there is a bar/lounge inside the hotel.

Stay Safe

Guadalajara is known to be one of the safest cities in Mexico. Nonetheless, the usual precautions should be taken as in any other large city. Crimes against tourists and foreign students are not very frequent and mostly take the form of purse snatching. Criminals usually work in teams and target travelers in busy places, such as outdoor restaurants. Should anyone spill something on you, be alert to your surroundings and step away--accidental spills are a common method for distracting the victim.

In addition, watch out for "motoladrones." They are thieves on motorcycles that use the element of surprise to snatch your phone, wallet, etc. They usually come from behind, even hop the curb, snatch your valuable and ride off. Be aware of your surroundings when pulling out your phone and wallet.

Never carry illegal substances with you; Mexican police are very strict regarding these cases.

Upon exiting the station, instead of going to the right towards the fancy new building (which will also have buses going to DF- usually around 800-900 MXN with Primera Plus or Futura), go towards your left. Walk down that street, with the metro line on your left hand side, for 1-2 blocks, until you see a building with lots of bus company offices on your right. Most of these companies are significantly cheaper than those in the nicer, newer buildings. TerraBus offers a ticket to DF every day at 2:30pm and 10:30pm for $550 pesos.
