Understand

Guayaquil is one of the main South American ports in the Pacific. The climate is hot for the first semester of the year and breeze cool for the rest of it. A proud city of the tropics where foreigners are well received, music rules and seafood is a must. 

In the last decade, the city has undergone positive change. The beautiful riverfront promenade "Malecon 2000" , green areas and modern shopping arcades all over the city attracts tourism from inside and outside the country.

Though tremors were felt during the recent earthquake in Ecuador, the main areas of Guayaquil remain unscathed and structurally unaffected.

History
The origin of the name "Guayaquil" derives from the love story myth of Tribal Chief "Guayas" and his wife "Quil".

The city was founded on July 25, 1538 with the name "Santiago de Guayaquil" by Spanish Conquistador Francisco de Orellana. Even before it was founded by the Spanish, it already existed as a native village of the "Huancavilca" tribe.

A plunder destination for pirates. In 1687, Guayaquil was looted by George d'Hout (English) and Picard and Groniet (Frenchmen). In 1709, the English captains Woodes Rogers, Etienne Courtney, and William Dampier along with hundreds of pirates, attacked Guayaquil and demanded ransom; however, they suddenly departed without collecting when the epidemic of yellow fever broke out.

Throughout the years, the city became known for its great Shipyards (Astilleros) with clients from all over the new continent.

In October 9, 1820, a group of civilians supported by soldiers from a battalion quartered in the city, declared Independence from Spanish Royalist Forces. Becoming "The Independent Province of Guayaquil" until 1822 when it was annexed to Simon Bolivar's .

In 1830, the Southern part of Colombia decided to leave the union and create an independent state called "Republic of Ecuador".

Today Guayaquil is still the main port, trading and financial center of .

In this airport, you can find daily non-stop flights to , , , , , , , among many Latin American destinations. Taxis to a hotel in the northern suburbs shouldn't cost more than $3 and a ride to downtown, where most attractions are located, is about $5. Currently there are plans to build a new international airport for about 20 minutes from Guayaquil, near Daular.

If you are planning to visit the , Guayaquil is the smartest place to take a flight from. There are three air carriers that will take you across to the Galapagos Islands as well as to the Ecuadorean mainland, LATAM Aerogal and TAME have non stop daily flights, departing from Guayaquil is cheaper than leaving from the Capital city as most of the Quito flights do make a stop at Guayaquil for refueling and picking up passengers.

International departure airport tax is included in the flight ticket.

By car

If you are driving, your horn is your best friend. Being careful and common sense will get you to your destination. Gas stations are full service.

You can also rent a car cheaply just outside the airport, paying around $35 a day, Carmax is one of the less expensive yet reliable companies available.

By bus
Guayaquíl has direct connections to all major Ecuadorian cities and indirect connections all over the country. For schedules and more bus info, see the "Getting Around" section of the country page or at AndesTransit. The huge mall/bus station (Terminal Terrestre) for connections out of the city is right next to the airport (walking distance). You can buy tickets on the lower level and workers will often come up to you and ask where you're going in hopes of getting you on to their bus. More than one company goes to most places, so ask around if you're looking for an ejecutivo or directo bus and you can save yourself some time and comfort.

The city also is served by international buses, to , and . Cruz del Sur operate international bus connections through Peru.

Within the city the local bus system is confusing but the locals will help you get where you want to go. Guayaquil's bus terminal is well organized, but still, keep a close eye on your belongings. Keep your items close to you during the midnight checkpoints.

To travel all of Ecuador starting in Guayaquil, you have two bus options – One you can get straight to the city or a Hop on/Hop off bus, such as Ecuador Hop; travelers can explore cities with ease and no rush with time with no strict itinerary and also the safety with the pick ups/drop offs at the hostels/hotels help travelers to avoid getting taxis outside the bus terminals.

By boat

Guayaquil´s port is the largest in . You can travel to from here.

Get around

By Metrovia

Metrovia is a modern bus rapid transit system that runs mostly from north to south and east to west of the city. The fare per ride costs 30 cents (but you need an electronic card to pay, they don't accept cash anymore). It is a reliable and easy-to-navigate transport system; has modern buses and stops. Fortunately, it boast a good connection between downtown and to the main bus terminal and the airport. The Rio Daule terminal is located just crossing the street from the main bus terminal and some blocks away (around 15 minutes walking) from the airport. Remember to match the code of the bus (eg. T1, CS, T3, etc.) with the station where are you heading to, since not all buses stop at all stations. You can use the map posted at each station for this purpose. The following stations will drop close by to some tourist attractions: La Catedral, Las Peñas, Jardines del Malecón, Banco Central and Biblioteca Municipal.

By bus
Within the city the local bus system is confusing but the locals will help you get where you want to go. It is also the cheapest way to get around the city as there is no metro system. For women it is safest if you sit at the front near the driver but don't be alarmed the bus is a safe way to travel around Guayaquil.

By Taxi

Taxis range from "taxi amigos" (un-marked taxis you call to pick you up) to the standard yellow cabs. Taxi drivers will try to over charge tourists. Nicer taxis are metered by GPS, but the majority of taxis do not have meters. Always agree on a price (or make sure the meter is running) before you get into a cab. Preferably, don't take any street cabs as some taxi-kidnapping occurs. Call a taxi if you can or take taxis from known places like the airport, bus station, or commercial centers.

Taxi apps such as Cabify and Uber are common here, work fast and are reliable. The drivers are rated and this creates a level of trust. Average fare within city center is $2 to $4, around the city $3 to $ 7.

By Car

You can also rent a car at one of the few places to rent just outside the airport. Prices range from $25 and up per day. Anyone with a drivers license from their home country can drive as a tourist in .
