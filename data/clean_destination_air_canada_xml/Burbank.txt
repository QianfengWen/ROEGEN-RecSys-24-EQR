Although commonly thought to be named for notable agricultural researcher Luther Burbank, the city is actually named after its founder David Burbank, a dentist and entrepreneur.

Get in
Burbank has its own airport, Bob Hope Airport (BUR) which enjoys frequent service by Southwest Airlines to other California cities as well as Denver, Las Vegas, and Phoenix. BUR is also served by Alaska, Delta, JetBlue, Seaport, United, and US Airways Express. Air taxi and air charter companies such as Great Circle Aviation fly into Bob Hope Airport for small groups and individuals.

The disadvantage of Bob Hope Airport is that it is painfully small and cramped. The terminal building sits at ground level so airstairs are always used for boarding and disembarking. The advantage of Bob Hope Airport is that it is conveniently small. You can get in and out very quickly relative to LAX. Because BUR cannot handle super-jumbo or jumbo jets, there is less risk of the wild fluctuations in crowd size regularly seen at LAX when too many big planes end up taking off or arriving simultaneously. Thus, if you are visiting the San Fernando Valley or nearby areas like Hollywood, it is often far more convenient to fly into BUR than LAX. 

In June 2014, BUR opened a new consolidated rental car facility. The facility is a long walk from the terminal but to make the journey shorter and more pleasant, the airport also built a covered open-air elevated walkway which features moving walkways. Since the rental car facility sits across the street from the Amtrak/Metrolink station, the same walkway also makes it more convenient for travelers to access the train station. 

To get between BUR and Burbank and Los Angeles:

*Metrolink and Amtrak - Burbank is the only airport in the LA metro area that features a train station within walking distance of the airport terminal. Free shuttle buses are also available. The Amtrak Pacific Surfliner and Coast Starlight trains stop at Burbank Airport. Amtrak stops at the station every day of the week while local Metrolink commuter rail only serves Burbank Airport on weekdays.

*By Bus - The Metropolitan Transportation Authority offers bus service to the corner of Hollywood Way and Thornton Avenue using the 94, 169 (on weekends and holidays), 222 (as the region's only route direct bus route from Hollywood), and the 794 bus. The City of Burbank's own Burbank Bus also serves Bob Hope Airport via the NoHo-Empire line.

Get around
Burbank has a low-cost bus system, Burbank Bus with multiple routes throughout the city. As of June 2007, fares are at $1. Transfers from the Los Angeles-wide MTA bus and rail system are accepted. The MTA also runs some services into Burbank.

As with Los Angeles in general, most visitors tend to drive, meaning you may find yourself the only one heading to the bus stop after your TV taping or studio tour.

A train station served by Metrolink is located across from the Burbank Media Center on the other side of the 5 freeway. Pedestrian access is via Olive Avenue bridge across the freeway and rail tracks. A second station is located next to Bob Hope Airport.

See

* Television Show Tapings. TV audiences are needed for tapings of all manner of television productions. You can get tickets online and free of charge 30 days prior to the date of the taping 

* Pickwick Gardens Very attractive place, but don't forget to visit the ice rink and the bowling alley.

Do

*Warner Brothers VIP Studio Tour, 3400 Riverside Dr., (818) 972-8687, M-F from 8:30AM until 4:00PM (extended hours in summer). Tours are conducted in twelve-person carts that visit the backlot sets, soundstages, production facilities, and the Warner Brothers museum. Reservations are offered for all tours. $54 per person for the two hour and ten minute long standard tour, with a five hour deluxe tour offered for $250 per person.

*Burbank Media Center, (aka "beautiful downtown Burbank" as heard on the 60s show "Laugh In") - shops, movie theaters, eateries, etc. all on San Fernando by the mall. Take the 5 and get off on the "Olive" exit. That should put you in the thick of things.

*The World's First Martial Arts History Museum is a cultural and educational look at how Asian history became part of American history through the martial arts.

NBC's West Coast studios were formerly located in Burbank and had tours for the public, but have since relocated to Universal City. The Burbank Studios which now occupy the same site do not offer public tours.

The Disney studio lot in Burbank is not open for public tours, with two exceptions. First, Adventures by Disney includes a Disney studio tour as part of its lavish (and very expensive) six-day, five-night Southern California tour package. Second, the other way to tour the studio is to join the D23 fan club, which holds studio tours for paying members every few months. 

From the outside, one can glimpse a handful of interesting details, such as the grand arch over the main entrance with the words "Walt Disney Co.", the studio water tower, and the Team Disney Burbank building which features the Seven Dwarves from Snow White. Across Riverside Drive to the south of the Disney lot, the Walt Disney Animation Studios and ABC Studios are prominent landmarks visible from the adjacent Ventura Freeway, but are also not open to the public. 

If you're interested in visiting Burbank because you're curious about the Walt Disney Company, keep in mind that Disney outgrew its studio lot long ago. A huge chunk of the company's operations are housed in a very plain industrial park two miles east in nearby ; even the famed animation studio was stuck out there from 1985 to 1995.
