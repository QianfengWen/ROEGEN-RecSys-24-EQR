Belgrade (Serbian: Београд, Beograd) — meaning 'White City' — is the capital of the Republic of . Various styles of architecture dominate the city while its recent resurgence as the leading hub in south-eastern Europe makes it a must-see destination.

 Understand 

Belgrade is the capital of Serbia and is, as such, the country's largest city with a population of about 1.7 million people. It lies on the confluence of the two major European rivers, Sava and . The city has a long history, dating back to the 4th century BC when the area was settled by Celtic tribes. Later on, it became the Roman city of Singidunum, and relics of that era can still be seen in the city, particularly at Kalemegdan Fortress. During the Middle Ages, the town changed hands between the Kingdom of Hungary and the Serbian Despotate (of which it was the capital) until 1521 when it was captured by the Ottoman Empire. Until Serbia retained its independence in 1878, the city again changed hands multiple times, but between the Ottoman Empire and the Habsburg Empire.

After the First World War, Belgrade became the seat of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, from 1929) until its collapse in 1941, after the subsequent German invasion. During the Second World War, it was the seat of the Nazi puppet Government of National Salvation and it was heavily bombed twice, once by the Germans and once by the Allies. It was again liberated by the joint Yugoslav - Soviet Army. 

In 1945 Belgrade became the capital of communist Yugoslavia (although the country wasn't part of the Eastern Bloc after the notorious Yugoslav - Soviet split in 1948), led by Marshal Josip Broz Tito until his death in 1980. During this period Belgrade became the economic, cultural, and political center of the Balkans, as the country was balancing itself between the East and the West. 

This period of stability did not last, and the country broke up into five new republics after the Yugoslav wars. Not long after that, the city saw violence again in 1999, as it was heavily bombed for 78 days by NATO forces. Finally, in 2006, the city became the capital city of the independent Republic of Serbia. This often violent history and outside influence has colored much of Belgrade's evolution, which is evident in its culture and architecture. Often caught between the hammer and anvil of clashing empires, the city has taken on a unique character, reminiscent of both Austrian and Turkish influences, with a unique set of Communist elements thrown in by the Marshal Tito Government. Yet, the city has its own spirit, and in it can be found some not only unique features but also a healthy joie de vivre in its café culture, nightlife, and often a Mediterranean flavor in its lifestyle.

While there isn't much ethnic or cultural diversity in Belgrade compared to other European cities, there are some minority communities (largely Roma and Chinese), as well as people from other former Yugoslav republics, such as Bosnia, Croatia, and Macedonia. There is also a small expat community. 

Cultural events from around the world, however, are starting to become increasingly common, particularly in the spring and summer months, due to the involvement of local arts and culture organizations, as well as foreign embassies and cultural centers. These attract a good deal of local attention and are helping to raise the city's profile as a cultural hotspot. Belgrade is an energetic city re-discovering its tourism potential.

Climate
Belgrade has a typical humid continental climate. Temperatures from December to January are usually around freezing during the night and around 5°C (42°F) during the day. The mercury can occasionally drop down to -10°C (14°F) when cold waves from Siberia hit and the record low is -18°C (0°F). Snow is frequent during the winter and can fall as early as November and as late as April. Winters are also really cloudy with only 65.4 hours of sunlight on average in December. Summers on the other hand are sunny and can become hot during the afternoon and the heat can feel much more oppressive in the city. Temperatures can reach 35°C (95°F) sometimes and, rarely, 38°C (100°F). The record high is 43.6°C (110.5°F). Belgrade also receives a moderate amount of precipitation during the summer mainly in the form of thunderstorms.

To travel between the airport and the city consult the website of Nikola Tesla Airport. 

* Bus 72 runs approx. 2x per hour from the upper departure level at Terminal 1 to Zeleni Venac market in the city center. The tickets (except for the one ride ticket) can be bought from the shop that sells food and newspapers inside the departures hall, although they may not be available and suggest you buy on the bus. The trip takes about 40 - 60 minutes (depending on the traffic) and the buses run from 04:40 to 23:40. See this URL link for the current schedule and route map. As of September 2022, the public_transportation fees are: 
*89 RSD (time-limited ticket, 90 minutes)
*150 (one ride ticket, this is the price if the ticket is bought on the bus).
*280 RSD (daily ticket)
*720 RSD (3 day ticket)
*1100 RSD (5 day ticket)

* Minibus A1 operates between the airport and Slavija Square, stopping at Fontana (Novi Beograd) and Belgrade - Glavna railway station. The buses are comfortable and air-conditioned. The fare is 400 RSD, which is paid on-board; be sure to tell the driver what your destination is before departure. The trip takes 30-40 minutes.

* If you prefer to take a taxi, read below. In theory, the taxi fare from the airport is fixed - you can buy vouchers for the taxi once you pick up the luggage and clear the customs. The price range is from 1400 RSD to Novi Beograd, 1800 RSD to central Belgrade, and from 2200 RSD to the suburbs. However, in reality, once you buy a voucher and get to the taxis, the taxi drivers may refuse the vouchers or will ask for extra money to get you to your destination. If this is the case, be firm and try to find a driver that will accept the voucher without any extra cost. You can also order a taxi by phone or simply go upstairs to the left until you get to the departure section and catch one of the taxis dropping off passengers (UPDATE: As of July 2022 the Airport is undergoing a reconstruction, including the drop-off point at the departure section which is now closed. The Taxis now stop near the control tower. Once you exit the airport, keep going forward through the construction area until you reach a parking lot, and then turn left and continue forward until you see the tower and the nearby road. There you can hail one on the street. If you order a taxi by phone, the dispatcher will confirm the pickup location or will give your phone number to the taxi driver so that he can contact you and explain where will he be waiting for you). You can find the list of the most reliable taxi companies that operate out of Nikola Tesla airport on this link Luggage fees are usually non-existent, but some companies charge them for luggage that weighs over 30 kg.
It is worth noting that you cannot change dinars inside the airport, and while the airport shops will accept dinars, all prices will be stated in Euros.

It's also worth noting that the airport duty-free is vastly overpriced. For example, bottles of Viljamovka - pear rakija with a pear grown inside the bottle - sell for the equivalent of around 10 euros in convenience stores throughout the city center but are priced at 74 euros in the airport. If you're planning to take bottles home as souvenirs you would be best placing them in your hold luggage.

By train
Update The Main Railway Station - Glavna Railway Station - in the center of the city is closed.

As of 1 July 2018, all domestic and international trains depart from and arrive at the main railway station officially called Beograd Centar but more commonly known by the name Prokop amongst locals. The exception to this is the trains to Bar, Sofia, and Skopje which depart from Topčider Station (reached using tram No. 3).

The Beograd Centar - Prokop station is located between the Senjak and Autokomanda areas of Belgrade and can be reached by public transport, by taking buses 34 and 36, trolleybuses 40 and 41. Furthermore, the run-down Beovoz suburban trains link the station with Vukov Spomenik in the city center.

The Prokop station has minimal facilities for now so it is recommended that you buy everything you need for your journey before arriving at the station, such as food and water.

* : Two daily trains between Budapest and Belgrade. InterCity Avala leaves at 12:05 from Budapest - Keleti station, arriving in Belgrade at 20:13. Another daily train, the Ivo Andrić leaves at 08:05 from Budapest - Keleti station, arriving at 16:32. In addition to that, the overnight train Beograd leaves at 22:25 from Budapest - Keleti station and arrives to Belgrade at 6:21. There are reservation - free seats for all trains. One way ticket is 15 EUR and the return ticket is 26 EUR (this offer is called the "Belgrade special", as of July 2016). Beware of people posing as very friendly guards, trying to enter your sleeping compartments on the night train from Belgrade to "help" you, as they are trying to rob you. They will leave your compartment door unlocked and rob you when you fall asleep. Do not listen to them and ask them to show you their work credentials to be sure. Also, it is good to secure your door apart from the lock, just to make sure, as these people know how to break into compartments. This is known to have occurred as soon as you cross the border into Hungary, but it is a quite rare occurrence.

* : One daytime train, leaving at 8:25, and one seasonal night train, leaving at 21:05. There is a discounted Belgrade Special ticket, non - non-refundable and bound to specified train and day, costs 29 EUR (one way, reservation included in price).
* and , : One daytime and one-night train (plus 2 more during the summer season). The price to Bar is 21 EUR plus a 3 EUR compulsory seat reservation or 6 EUR couchette reservation (6 seats).
* : One daytime train, leaving at 8:20, and a night train, leaving at 22:14. Return ticket costs EUR 32.60 EUR ("Serbia special").
* : One-day train in summer, which leaves at 9:30. One-way ticket costs 20.60 EUR. In the off-season, changes are required at Dimitrovgrad (a Serbian border town) and Niš.
* : No direct train: There is a bus that leaves at 18:50 for Gevgelija (border town in North Macedonia), then a night train via Skopje and Niš. One way ticket costs 33.80 EUR, return 54 EUR.
* : Unfortunately, there's no longer a cross-border train connection between Romania and Serbia.
* : Daily train from Vienna - Hauptbahnhof at 9:12h. The return ticket costs 70 EUR.
* : One daytime train, leaving at 11:05, and one night train, leaving at 23:48. The regular ticket costs 24.40 EUR one way, while the return ticket costs 48.80 EUR. It is important to emphasize that every additional passenger has a 50% discount for the return ticket (just ask for the "City Star" ticket). For example, the "City Star" return ticket costs 73.20 EUR for two passengers.

 By bus 

Belgrade Bus Station, also known as BAS (short for Beogradska Autobuska Stanica), is right next to the central train station, on Karađorđeva Street. While coach service to national and international destinations is frequent and departure times are usually reliable, beware that the arrival times may not be. The timetables aren't clearly posted and are in Serbian only, so ask for information inside the terminal. When buying a bus ticket for national travel, you will also receive a token to enter the platform area. For international travel, you will be given a paper stub to present at the platform gate.

Be aware that most coach drivers will charge you a fee of approximately 100 RSD per bag for baggage handling in the cargo compartment, though this is not a uniform practice with international travel. Also, beware that drivers rarely speak English or any other foreign language. Inform yourself about your trip prior to departure as much as you can; if in doubt, ask a fellow passenger for assistance. Coach travel in Serbia is a hit-and-miss experience. While there is a huge number of companies to choose from, not all of them have clean, modern coach fleets, particularly for travel within Serbia or to neighboring ex - ex-Yugoslav countries. Coaches are more often clean and modern when embarking on trips to Western Europe. For long trips, drivers usually stop for 15-minute breaks roughly every two hours, though this isn't by any means guaranteed. Pack appropriately with food and bottled water. When disembarking on breaks during the trip, make sure to either secure your belongings or take them with you. When you get off the bus, you'll probably be offered a taxi ride or baggage-carrying by some men. Do not accept these offers. They may be illegal and the intention may be to rip you off.

For international trips to the rest of Europe, Lasta is the Eurolines carrier.

By car
From Hungary

If you are coming from , you should use the E75 highway (M5 in Hungary, A1 in Serbia). After crossing the border at Horgoš - Röszke, you will pass through and . It is a 2-hour ride from the border. This route has a ticket-based toll system - you take a ticket when you enter the tolled portion of the highway, and then provide the ticket when you exit the highway to determine the amount of the toll. Credit cards are accepted for the tolls. If continuing your travel into Hungary through Serbia, you will need to separately buy a "vignette" after crossing into Hungary to pay the Hungarian portion of tolls to continue on the highway. Vignettes are available for sale at various gas stations and small shops near the border crossings.

From Montenegro

Use the E763 highway, also known as the Ibarska Magistrala (M22 in Serbia). After crossing the border at Gostun - Dobrakovo, you are going pass through , and Čačak before reaching Belgrade, But beware that this is a mountainous road and accidents are common, especially during the summer. It takes about 5 - 6 hours from the border to Belgrade. Also beware of the road works, as the road is slowly being upgraded to a dual-carriageway. The first section, from Ljig to Preljina will open on the 25th of August, 2016. 

From Slovenia and Croatia

Use the E70 highway, when coming from or (A3 in Croatia and Serbia). You will enter Serbia at the Batrovci - Bajakovo border crossing. From there it takes 1 hour to Belgrade. 

From Romania

Use the E70 highway, coming from (M10 in Serbia, DN59 in ). You will cross the border at Vatin - Moravița and pass through Vršac and Pančevo. It takes around 2 hours to Belgrade. 

From Macedonia

Use the E75 highway (A1 in Macedonia and Serbia). You will cross the border at Tabanovce - Preševo, and go through and , before reaching Belgrade. It takes about 4 hours and 30 minutes to get to Belgrade.

From Bulgaria

Use the E80, and the E75 highways (A4 and A1 in Serbia). After crossing the border at Kalotina-Gradina, use to E80 to Niš and join the E75 there, continuing to Belgrade. It takes 4 hours to complete the trip from the border.

From Albania

Use the - highway, then continue to Niš and join into the E75 highway to Belgrade. It takes 6 hours to complete the trip from the first border. Beware that you will be crossing 2 borders, out of which, one is administrative.

When coming from it is recommended to go into and use the A3 highway to Belgrade, as the infrastructure in Bosnia and Herzegovina is in bad shape.

By boat
Belgrade lies where the rivers Sava and the Danube meet. Passenger ships enable you to reach every place along the Danube in a very convenient and meditative manner with many fascinating attractions along the way, but it is a quite slow and rather expensive way of traveling.

By bicycle
Belgrade is located on the European bicycle route which connects the Atlantic Ocean and the Black Sea.

Get around

By public transport
GSP Beograde (ГСП in Cyrillic) operates an extensive public transport network of buses, trolleybuses, and trams in the city and suburbs. There is a BusPlus android app for checking wait times for the next vehicle to arrive at any given stop.
Also, you can use the Plan Plus website and Android App for route planning. 

There are 12 tram lines, hundreds of bus lines, 8 trolleybus lines, and 9 public minibus lines (E1–E9). Google Maps does a good job of outlining different public transport options, as well as their scheduled times. 

The trams in Belgrade are enjoyable to ride. Many of them are Soviet-era vehicles that have not been updated but are clean and well-maintained. It can feel like going back in time to see the driver have to get out of the vehicle to manually switch the tracks.

Fares

As of 17th of March 2023, the prices of fares have changed and new tariff zones have been introduced. Tickets do not need to be validated on machines inside the vehicle, as was the case before the new system began. Instead, the tickets are valid from the moment of purchase. This means that if you buy a paper 90-minute ticket, its validity doesn't start from the moment you enter a bus, but from the moment you buy it, so take it into account if the bus stop is not close by. Tickets are also valid for BG:Voz , but not for BeoVoz and minibusses. You can see the full ticket prices here

There are several ways to buy a ticket:
* Through SMS via number 9011, however, this only includes domestic mobile carriers, so if you have a foreign number you will not be able to use this method. You can buy a Serbian prepaid SIM card and use it to buy the tickets. 
* Buying a paper ticket. However, as of now, there are only 5 locations in Belgrade available to buy a ticket: Skender Begova 47, TC Trg Republike ("Staklenac" Shopping Mall), Knez Mihajlova 6 (2nd floor), Deligradska 10, Bulevar Mihajla Pupina 167. Paper tickets will be available at kiosks in the near future. 
* Buying a ticket through the smartphone app. However, the app is still in development and it's unclear when it will become available. 

Children under the age of 7 ride free.

City transport is now divided into two tariff zones. The first tariff zone is for all the buses within the inner and the outer city limits (zone A), while the second tariff zone includes the outer and suburban areas of Grocka, Barajevo, Sopot, Obrenovac, and the cities of Mladenovac and Lazarevac (zone B). If you need to travel between the two zones, you will need a zone C ticket, which includes both zones. If you are staying in Belgrade, you will mostly be riding in zone A, therefore the prices in this article are in this zone.

Every station should be clearly marked on which zone it belongs to (the Serbian word for zone is "Zona" ).

Single ticket / 90-minute ticket
You cannot purchase a ticket for a single ride. This ticket has been replaced by a 90-minute ticket and the price is RSD50. When you enter a bus, you no longer have to validate your ticket. Also, you can no longer pay for the 90-minute ticket using Mastercard Contactless. You can buy a 90-minute ticket by sending an SMS with text A90 to 9011. (NOTE: Not available for foreign carriers). 

Day and multi day tickets
If you plan to use public transportation often, you can buy a 1-day ticket (120 RSD), a 7-day ticket (800RSD) or a 30-day ticket (2200RSD). For purchasing tickets via SMS, codes are A1 for a 1-day ticket, A7 for 7-days ticket, and A30 for a 30-day ticket.

Night buses are now free to use. They have the N suffix and they operate from 00:00 until 04:00. 

Minibus
Minibus fares are RSD150, payable to the driver.

Inspection
Ticket inspection in the daily buses is carried out by the Communal police of Belgrade or "Beli". If you are caught without a ticket the fine is 2500RSD which you pay in the next 8 days, after that the fine is 5000 dinars.

Hours
Daily transport starts at 04:00 and ends at 00:00. Night transportation is operated only by buses. It is sparse and goes every half-hour to every hour, but there are plans to make all night lines depart every half-hour. It is best to ask where and when to use it since some of the night lines are modified versions of the daily ones. 

Tram Line 2 is famous in the city with a circular route, running in both directions. The circle is known as krug dvojke (#2's circle) and rings the central city streets. Line 3 is famous for the beautiful neighborhoods it goes through, particularly Miloš's Konak Park.3

 By commuter rail 
BG:Voz (BG:Train) is an additional line. These trains run according to schedule which is every 30 minutes (15 minutes on rush hour). 

Note that trains are often late and delayed.

By taxi
Taxis are cheap by European standards, though far more expensive than anywhere else in Serbia.

General precautions
 are common in Belgrade. It is always best if you order the taxi by phone since your order will be saved in the operator database. Here is the official info about taxi services in Belgrade. Taxi fares are regulated by the government and are as follows: RSD140 to start a ride, RSD55-110 per kilometer (depending on the time of day), and RSD12.5 per minute waiting time. The most recommended taxi services in Belgrade are Beogradski Taxi and Pink Taxi Beograd

Be sure to choose a taxi with a roof sign with the city coat of arms and a number, indicating it's a city-regulated radio taxi. Never take a privately owned cab - the one with the white marker on the top that does not list the name of the company - since you can pay up to four times the normal price. Also, legal taxis must have their license plates ending with TX (for example BG-1234-TX).

Insist that the trip be metered. The only exception is the case when you take a taxi from the airport, where you may approach the taxi desk for a receipt stating a fixed price for travel to various parts of the city. You will pay the driver the exact amount stated on the receipt given to you at the airport desk. Tipping taxi drivers is welcomed but not required, and your luggage transport is included in the metered price.

If you believe that the driver is trying to rip you off, call the operator of that taxi association to check if the price is regular for the specified distance. Afraid of the inspection, they might call back the driver and bring him to reason. Also, ask for a signed bill indicating the date, time, start and end destination, price, and driver's signature. Write down the number on the blue sign on the vehicle roof, as well as the license plates. Report the incident to city inspection (+381-11/3227-000) and if you are going from or to the airport, report it also to airport inspection (+381-11/2097-373, taxi@beg.aero). If the driver is aggressive towards you, call the police.

 By car 
As in most of Europe, you must keep to the right side of the road. Avoid rush hours (8:30–9:30AM, 4:00–6:00PM). Belgrade is not , , or , but getting around can be stressful if you aren't used to traffic congestion combined with aggressive local driving habits. Plan your journey if you are going into the city core, and expect to have a hard time finding free parking places on the streets during Friday and Saturday evenings in the center. Garages might be a better choice. 

Keep your low-beam headlights turned on, during both day and night. The speed limit on the streets of the city is 50 km/h, near schools even less, and on the highway is higher. Police is known to wait at places where you might feel comfortable to drive over the limit, but almost never on the highway. Take special care while crossing Branko's bridge, and driving on the following streets: Bulevar Mihaila Pupina, Jurija Gagarina, Vladimira Popovića, and other major ones. Keep your seat belts fastened. Other passengers must also do the same, even when sitting in the back seat (if there are seat belts installed).

The allowed level of blood alcohol content (BAC) is 0.03%, which is roughly equal to one drink. If you do go by car to drink, consider going back using a taxi or Safe driver service, +381-64/1746-411. They will come to pick you up on the small, folding motorcycle, pack it in your trunk, and drive you back home in your car. Their charge is modest, and slightly higher than a one-way ride with the taxi (~5€ for 10km).

Rent a car
Renting a car in Serbia is a great way to see the country! However, a car rental is probably not beneficial if you are staying only in Belgrade. Parking is difficult to find, parking tickets are common, and there is a myriad of cheap public transport options available.

If you rent a car, you will be provided with the owner's card. Carry this around with you and do not leave it in the car. Also, be sure to inform your rental car agency if you plan to take your rental car outside of Serbia. 
* 
* Low-cost car rental in Belgrade, free car delivery to hotel or airport. Available 24/7.
* Airport pick up, professional private driver, all day transportation, rent a luxury car, limousine service.
* 

 Yellow lanes 
Many boulevards and some streets have yellow lanes. They are reserved for public transport, i.e. buses and taxis, and you are not allowed to use them. The yellow lanes are marked with a yellow line and are indicated on traffic signs. Some yellow lanes, though, are active only in certain periods of the day, usually during rush hours.

 Parking 
There are spaces for parking in the city center. There is a large parking garage with 500 spaces under the old palace in the city center, across from the parliament building.

Also, take into consideration that in the center almost all of the parking spaces in the central streets have zones marked with green, yellow, or red paint on the street (yellow zone spaces are actually marked orange, to avoid confusion with other marks). You can only stay for 3, 2 or 1 hour, respectively, in those spots. You can pay using the machine usually found near the parking spots, buy the parking ticket at a kiosk, or by cell phone (just text your car's license plate number (for example BG123456) to numbers 9111 (red zone), 9112 (yellow) or 9113 (green)). Every message you send is valid for one hour and, some 5 minutes before the hour has passed, you get a text message telling you that you can send another SMS if you want to extend your parking for the next hour. Of course, this only applies in yellow and green zones, in which you can park for more than 1 hour. After the time is up, you'll have to re-park or risk paying a fine (around €15). All of this only applies on weekdays, from 7AM to 9PM and from 7AM to 2PM on Saturdays. After that (Sa 2PM – Mo 7AM) parking is free.

There are also several public parking garages and parking lots where you can park for an unlimited amount of time during the day. Fees are charged on an hourly basis (price varies, usually around €0.7-0.9/hour). In some non-zoned areas, you also pay for parking depending on the duration of your stay, and this is paid in cash to the parking attendant.

Parking violations are dealt with rather swiftly in the city center and with less commitment in the peripheral zones. Failure to pay for parking in a marked spot is handled by parking enforcement officers and can only result in a fine which would be difficult to collect if you're operating a foreign licensed vehicle. On the other hand, illegally parked vehicles are handled by the traffic police. Once spotted, the police are required to wait for 15 minutes for the driver to return. If you do return in time, you will be issued a sanction and a fine (around €50). When the 15 minutes are up, your car will get towed to one of 4 designated lots in the city. Once at the lot, you will be required to present a valid form of ID and the vehicle matriculation papers, pay the mandatory fine and towing expenses (around €90 in total).

For the other parking options, there are a lot of unused private parking spaces all around the city. In a time when everybody has a smartphone, there's a new possibility - parking share. Lako Parkiraj is an online service that connects owners of parking spaces with those who need to park. You can use it to easily find and book parking places in Serbia in advance. Detailed information can be found on the Lako Parkiraj website.

 By boat 
Small boats connecting Ada Ciganlija to Novi Beograd's Block 70a are the only mode of public transport on rivers. Also, there are several tourist boats that offer day and night cruises along the Sava and Danube.

 By bicycle 
Old Belgrade is pretty hilly and the bicycle infrastructure is scarce, so bicycle transport isn't in wide use. However, New Belgrade and Zemun are relatively flat and offer enough space for bikes to be used. Bicycle tracks link Zemun, Dorćol, Ada Ciganlija, New Belgrade, and Bežanijska kosa. There is a bike lift on Brankov Bridge operating 365 days and the ride is free of charge. There are also more than 50 bicycle racks around the city.

Riding a bike on the same roads as cars and buses is considered too dangerous, although on smaller streets it can be reasonably safe. Avoid riding on major (multilane) roads. Unfortunately, you are not allowed to bring bikes into public transport vehicles.

Bicycle rentals are available mostly in recreational areas like Ada Ciganlija or Zemun Quay. 

 By foot 
Belgrade is mostly pedestrian-friendly. The city center can be seen on foot and the main pedestrian street is Knez Mihajlova which connects to the Kalemegdan fortress. The riverbanks are also full of people on weekends when the weather is nice. Belgrade also has a lot of beautiful parks. The pedestrian paths are mostly in good shape but be careful in some places, especially in Skadarlija where the old cobble path is in pretty bad shape.

There are plans to expand the pedestrian zone near Knez Mihajlova Street. Work has already begun to transform several streets into pedestrian areas and in a couple of years, the entire area around Knez Mihajlova and the Republic square should be traffic-free.

Local wines can be good, although more expensive ones tend to be more drinkable, and many of the less expensive bottles are less than satisfactory. The national alcoholic drink is rakija, a Serbian brandy that is very strong and makes a good souvenir.

For the sober crowd, Belgrade has blueberry, raspberry, tomato, peach, apple, strawberry, and any other kind of juice you can think of.

All cafés serve the usual continental coffees', such as espresso and cappuccino. However, regular coffee comes in the form of Turkish coffee, not filtered coffee. If you want a filtered coffee, you need to specify this when ordering, and not all coffee shops have it. Also very popular is whipped instant coffee, commonly referred to simply as 'Nes' (as in, Nescafé). A cafe called Mali Prag (across from the Hotel Prag) is thought by some to offer the best "Serb Coffee" in the world.

There are a couple of places worth visiting if you are a fan of cafe culture. The street best known for its trendy cafes is definitely Strahinjića Bana. On this street, cafes are full even on weekdays. The best atmosphere is on Friday evenings when the trendy youth of Belgrade descend to enjoy the music and each other.

Stay safe

Overall, Belgrade is an extremely safe city and has significantly lower rates of violent crime than most Western cities. But, like anywhere, you should always keep money, mobile phones, travel documents, and other valuable personal items in secure places. Pickpockets are known to operate in public transportation, and other crowded places so never wear a backpack or purse on your back, and make sure that you have your wallet in one of your front pockets. If you own a car, it is preferable to have a security system. Traffic laws are usually observed although nervous drivers can change lanes suddenly or make dangerous turns when avoiding traffic during rush hour. Taxi drivers are notorious for swerving in and out of lanes. Pay close attention to the traffic signals as a pedestrian. 

Also, try to avoid getting into conflicts. If you are staying out late in a bar or a club, there is always a small chance that someone will try to pick a fight especially if you are in a group and a single guy is showing hostility. That is a trap by local thugs looking for a brawl. That is not because you are a foreigner. It is just the "law of the streets": anyone can be the target. Just ignore them and walk away no matter what they say or do. The chances that this will happen are very low, but stay alert. Do not try to make fun of the locals in your native language. Almost everyone has at least a basic understanding of English and is familiar with foul words and curses. 

 Emergencies 
In case of an emergency, call 192 (police), 193 (fire) or 194 (ambulance). Always carry the phone number and the address of your embassy with you. In case of injury or illness, the place to go is the Urgentni Centar (Emergency center), Pasterova 2 of the Clinical Center of Serbia. Be aware that not all medical facilities have English-speaking staff or other foreign languages. 

Pharmacies on duty 24/7:
* Prvi maj, Kralja Milana 9, +381-11/3344-923
* Sveti Sava, Nemanjina 2, +381-11/2643-170
* Zemun, Glavna 34, +381-11/2618-582

LGBT
LGBT travelers are advised to be discreet outside of the city center and late at night if around large groups of men. Some neighborhoods are known for being more open than others, Vračar and Karaburma are becoming the neighborhoods a lot of LGBT people choose to reside in for practical reasons. For all that, Karaburma is one of the rare neighborhoods outside of the city center that is becoming low-key pretty gay-friendly despite having 0 LGBT events, bars, or labeling as LGBT-friendly whatsoever. Public displays of affection between two people of the same sex are likely to be met with odd looks in most areas and, in some cases, verbal violence. Although rare, physical violence may occur outside of the city center or when encountering hooligans or intoxicated groups of people.

There are several gay bars and clubs all around the city, and they tend to get quite full: Musk Machine, XL, Guvernanta, Šupa, 54Bar (formerly Smiley), Mystic, as well as non-labeled yet friendly cafes like Meduza, Zappa Baza, Zappa Barka, Pop Quart, Zaokret, and Zgazeni Golub (and most of the places in the alternative district in the Cetinjska parking lot just behind the famous Skadarlija). Other venues include a gay sauna called RedLine Sauna. 

There are several LGBT parties organized periodically by various organizations at different locations, such as WB parties, Thank you next parties, Drag shows, and various others. Electronic music parties are known for being inclusive. Antibo (Antiboemska veselja) parties with an odd concept combining rave setting and turbo folk music are known to be inclusive yet not labeled as LGBT or LGBT friendly. Although known to expose some nationalistic symbols on LED screens during some songs in the line-up, the party concept attracts a lot of LGBT people, making it one of the rare events where same-sex PDA is not rare to see and the party is known to be a safe space. These parties are organized occasionally and in different locations, in most cases Club Drugstore. For those interested in "hard-core" turbo folk and Serbian pop-folk with occasional world music stages occurring at some events, Antibo is definitely the party they need to experience. Information about these parties can be found on their Instagram page. Some similar concepts can be found around the city, like Turbo-Tigar parties and Dragi Bravo, but those don't have a reputation for being safe spaces for LGBT people so far, despite being super popular among them as well. Avoid football fan crowds at all costs if you think you may be a target because of your appearance since they tend to be extremely violent and homophobic. For most places to go out to, using Google Maps can be practical enough since most of the places are within a 2km radius of the city center.

Belgraders, and especially LGBT people from Belgrade, are welcoming. Dating apps such as Grindr, Tinder, and Romeo are frequently used, so these apps can help you in meeting new people and getting information about events, and places to go. 

It is important to know that the Serbian Orthodox church is known to have a very hard homophobic stance. Keep in mind that even though many Serbs take pride in their church, it is not safe for LGBT+ people to join their meetings. Avoid such gatherings at all costs for your protection. If you have any self-consciousness or believe that someone could tell from the way you look that you are LGBT+, rethink visiting any of the churches even if it's a landmark. This is a friendly warning as your safety should be your number one priority.

In case of being abused or attacked, report it to the police immediately. Most ERs have a police officer next to the ambulances 24/7 so don't hesitate to get in touch with them. But keep in mind that although they react properly in most cases, they tend to be pretty indifferent to violence against LGBT+. 
* For any legal help in cases of being attacked, contact the local ZNA.
* Since 2018 Center has been working continuously and has been providing free services of education, cultural events, social debates, and HIV testing as well as organizing Belgrade Pride itself. Despite the fact that is constantly under some form of attack by the right wing and the hooligans, it has been providing substantial support for LGBT+ locals and visitors in Serbia. Regarding that, for any information about the community, cultural events, pride, legal support, and general inquiries.

 Contact 
The international telephone code for Serbia is 381. Most cities in Serbia and mobile operators have a 2-digit area code. There is only one area code for Belgrade and that is 11. Typical landline phone number in Belgrade +381-11/xxx-xxxx. The typical mobile phone number is +381-6x/xxx-xxxx. From the Serbian landline phone, use the 00 prefix for international calls (e.g. 0031-20/xxx-xxxx for Amsterdam, Netherlands), and the prefix 0 for calls inside Serbia but outside your area (e.g. 021/xxx-xxxx for Novi Sad, Serbia or 06x/xxx-xxxx for Serbian mobile). If you dial inside the same area, there is no need to use the prefix (just dial xxx-xxxx).

Basically, the whole city is covered by the mobile networks of all three Serbian operators. It is easy to buy and charge cheap pre-paid numbers at the kiosks around the city. If you use a 064 pre-paid number, use *100# to check the credit, for 063, use *121#, for 061, use *123#.

There are a number of red-colored payphones across the city, operated by telephone cards available at the kiosks.

Free wireless access is available at the Student Park in Belgrade Center. Mobile operators offer pre- and post-paid wireless Internet packages.

 Local Media 
Belgrade's most popular radio station, Radio S (94.9), features music from the former Yugoslav countries, while Index (88.9), Antena Beograd (107.9), Gradski (102.2), B92 (92.5), and Studio B (105.4) play mostly English-language pop/rock music. Radio S, Radio Index, and B92 cover all of Serbia and offer occasional traffic reports.

Television is exclusively in Serbian, but foreign films and series are broadcast with original audio and Serbian subtitles. Some hotels offer channels from other European countries.

Belgrade Insight is the only English-language local newspaper.

Stay healthy
The Košava, a notorious Belgrade wind, can be quite chilling, particularly in winter - take care and dress appropriately.

Also be mindful of the high number of stray animals roaming streets, particularly dogs, even in the city center. Whilst it is very rare that they demonstrate outward signs of illness or aggression, err on the side of caution and avoid coming in physical contact.

Pharmacies – called 'apoteka' – are found throughout the city center. Look for lit green crosses on building façades. Some, such as the one in Kralja Milana Str, are open twenty-four hours. These will carry a range of prescription medicines, as well as over-the-counter products like painkillers and vitamin supplements.

Cope
Smoking in public places is no longer as rampant as it used to be. The ban that covers workplaces, shopping malls, and public transport is now generally enforced, though it doesn't apply to most restaurants, bars, and clubs.
