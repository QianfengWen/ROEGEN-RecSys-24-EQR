You'll be raising your glass many times in Bordeaux, which is renowned for its wines, considered amongst the best in the world. As the capital of the department in the region , it has one million inhabitants in its metropolitan area at a 2008 estimate. After years of neglect, the former wet docks are the country's new hot spot, with a number of cafés, gardens, and museums springing up all the time. A lively university community of over 60,000, (Bordeaux Campus is the largest in ) establishes that Bordeaux is about more than just wine.

Understand

Bordeaux is considered a very tolerant and relaxed place - no one will bother you about your political beliefs, religion, or sexual orientation. The cultural, artistic, and music scenes are very vibrant. The city was ruled by the English for a long time, which is why Bordeaux seems to have an "English flair".

Bordeaux is often referred to as "Little Paris" and the rivalry between the "Bordelais" (people from Bordeaux) and "Parisiens" is a hot subject, so you may experience some heated arguments on the subject during your stay.

Geography

Bordeaux is a flat city, built on the banks of the Garonne River. The Garonne merges a dozen kilometres below the city with another river, the Dordogne River to form the Gironde Estuary, which is the biggest estuary in France.

The city centre is located west and south of the Garonne. To the east are a few hills - the only ones in the vicinity. These hills mark the beginning of an industrial zone and suburbs. Because it is a flat city, bicycles make excellent modes of transport, especially as the city has more than 580 km of cycle tracks. Bordeaux is among the most economically dynamic cities in France.

Due to the weakness of the subsoil, there are no skyscrapers in Bordeaux, which explains its sprawl. The centre of the town has retained its traditional stone mansions and smart terraces, hence the reason behind the city being called "Little Paris".

Modern buildings can be found to the west (administrative centre) and south (university) of the city.

Get in

By plane

Bordeaux-Mérignac Airport () (), is west of the city. It is a regional airport which serves mostly domestic flights, though there are international flights as well connecting Bordeaux to some European "hub" airports like (Orly and Roissy), (Gatwick and Luton), , and .

You can also take public transit (every 10-15 mins, 1.70€) from the airport to downtown. Just outside the "Arrivals" section you will see a bus stop for route Number 1. This bus will take you directly to Gambetta (a short walk from the Hotel de Ville) and terminates at the main train station, or you can get off at "Lycées de Mérignac" (about 15 minutes) and take tram line A to the city centre. Tickets can be bought from the automated machine using a (foreign) credit card, or from the driver. Tickets are valid for 1 hour, and you can change to any tram or bus within this hour. Be aware that Route 1 is popular with locals and tourists alike and can get busy during rush hours - with little room for luggage, and standing room only. It can take 1 hour for Bus no.1 to get downtown, by which time your ticket will have expired if you need to get another bus. Switching to Tramline A is recommended if the bus is full.

There is also an express bus that runs every 45 minutes to the city centre, with stops on the demand. The same bus runs from Gare Saint Jean to the airport with three stops:

#. Office du Tourisme 12, cours du 30 juillet
#. Place Gambetta Arrêt 50-16-13 (devant le 38 & 39)
#. Barrière Judaïque (devant le 9 avenue de la République)

The fare is 7.40€, but a reduced fare for those under 26 or over 60 is available for 6€.

Bergerac Dordogne Périgord Airport () is served by a number of airlines, including British Airways, Jet2.com, Ryanair and Transavia. As of 2017, the airport is not served by any public transport. A taxi from the airport to Bergerac railway station should cost less than €20 and take around 15 minutes. From Bergerac railway station there is a direct train to Bordeaux Saint Jean station (journey time around 1hr 20 min).

From Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport () there are TGV high-speed train services from the railway station which is adjacent to Terminal 2 (station name: Aéroport Charles de Gaulle 2 TGV or Paris Aéroport Roissy Charles-de-Gaulle when booking online) to Bordeaux Saint Jean station. The quickest journey time for a direct train is 3 hrs 33 mins.

From Paris Orly Airport (), take bus 91.10 from the airport to Massy TGV station.

The main train station (Gare Saint Jean) is located about 2km from the centre of town. Several trains per day (around one every two hours) go north (to , about 2 -3 hours, 25 trains a day , , ), south (to , , (about 4 to 5 hours), up to ), and east (to and ).

Buses, trams and taxis leave from in-front of the station. Take Tram C or D to get to downtown if you are going to the more northern part, or a bus if you are going to the area around Place de la Victoire.

By car

You can reach Bordeaux by car from the north (taking the A10 highway or N10), south (taking the A63 highway), and east. A beltway goes around the city.

If possible, avoid driving between 8-10AM and 4-7PM, as the beltway is usually overcrowded.

By bus

Long-distance buses seem to stop southeast of the train station along Rue des Terres de Borde by the rental car parking lots. SoBus and ComparaBUS provide bus service to the city -- confirm the location of the stop on your tickets and with the somewhat surly staff at the Eurolines ticket sales office (across the street from the main entrance of Gare Saint-Jean).

If you're traveling with bikes European Bike Express run a route from north of , stopping through the UK to and then on towards via Bordeaux. Passengers normally travel from the UK to Europe.

By taxi

Taxi providers offer service to and from the airport. For taxi services, you can go directly to Bordeaux Airport taxi rank or make an advance booking with one of the companies.

For more information about taxis in France, see the main article.

Get around

Bordeaux is quite a big city; however, most of the interesting attractions are in the town centre. It is not recommended that visitors drive as it is always a hassle to park (and car parks are expensive), and there are often traffic jams in the narrow, old streets of the city.

The most interesting way to explore the city is by walking. As most of the town centre is a pedestrian area, this is easy to do. If you like sports, you can rent roller-skates or a bike (see below) or you can make your way in town using the various bus lines. A small ferry boat permits to go from the western shore of the river to the eastern shore, and vice-versa.

Three efficient tramway lines are also available (A, B, and C), tickets cost 1.50€ and covers unlimited journeys within one hour of validation. The machines do not accept notes so you will need a French Carte Bancaire or coins. 

By bus

The bus network is organized around a few main places, where it is possible to take buses to almost every destination in the city :

* Gare Saint-Jean (railway station, bus lines going to town centre, university, and north of town, TBC agency),
* Place de la Victoire (bus lines going to town centre, to the railway station, to the University, north and south-west of town,
* Place Gambetta (bus lines going to la Victoire, the railway station, west, north-west, north of town, TBC agency ).
* Quinconces (TBC agency).

Single fare tickets (1.70 €) can be purchased from the driver on the bus although you shouldn't expect to receive change. The best thing to do is buy packages of 5/10 tickets for 5.90/11.30€ or a daily/weekly pass for 4.30/11.30€ from TBC Agencies (French: Espace TBC) at Gare Saint-Jean, Gambetta and Quinconces, all trips are good for one hour of unlimited transfers - you must validate your ticket each time you change buses/trams. You can also purchase these tickets from the automated machines at the tramway stops, all machines will accept coins and some of them will accept chip debit/credit cards. To qualify for the reduced student price of 6.30€ for 10 trips you need to be a student IN Bordeaux and purchase an ID card (July 2010).

If you are driving a car note that TBC offers parking (called Parc-relais) included in the fare at specific tram stations. 

Avoid the buses on peak hours (8-10AM, 4-7PM) as the town centre is usually totally jammed (and cars often block bus tracks), and buses are overcrowded.

By ferry

Le Bus du Fleuve, as it is called, links the western and eastern parts of the city by a small cruise on the river. It is managed by the CGFTE, and you can therefore ride the ferry using a standard bus ticket. The bus goes from the Southern part of Quai Richelieu to the Place Aristide Briand, very close to the Aquitaine Bridge (one of the must-see in Bordeaux).

By electric bus and tramway

A tram serves the town, crossing the Garonne via the Pont de Pierre. A distinctive feature of the tramway is that within the inner city, it has no overhead wires as it utilizes ground-level power supply system.

The electric bus, called la navette du centre-ville, is the only public transportation on pedestrian roads. There are no bus stops for this one: to board an electric bus, wave your hand to the driver - he will stop the bus and let you on. When you want to go out, just tell the driver.

All the maps, fares and times are on the TBC Web site (in French) Also, maps and times can be easily accessed with Google Maps, just select route "By public transit" when getting directions.

By bicycle

As was mentioned previously, Bordeaux is very flat and has lots of bike lanes, so it is very easy to get around the city by bicycle. In February 2010, Bordeaux added a city-wide bike sharing program called V3 (pronounced VCub) to Vélib in Paris). It is a cheap and easy way to see the city although the requirement to put down a 200€ deposit before taking a bike might cause problems if you do not have a bank/credit card that works well with the system. A daily (24 hours) or weekly subscription is 1.70€ or 7.70€, respectively; and each usage is free provided you do not go over 30 minutes. (You can just return the bike and take out a new one.)

Sports

Football (soccer) is a very popular sport in Bordeaux, as the F.C. Girondins, the football club, is one of the best in France (avoid talking football in the city, it's another sensitive subject). Tickets for almost every game are easy to come by and can be purchased before the match at the ticket office 'Place Johnstone' at the South West corner of the stadium or on the evening of the game at the turnstiles. Games against main rivals Marseille will sell out well in advance as will the fixtures against PSG, Lyon and usually St Etienne so don't travel without a ticket for one of these games. Expect to pay anything between 9 euros for the Virages Nord and Sud (behind the goals) to a maximum of 80 euros for the exclusive Presidential Suite.

The Virage Sud is an amazing experience for any football fan but be warned that everyone stands up on the seats, your view may be restricted by an impressive array of flags and they have a habit of lighting flares frequently during the match.

Despite the locals being extremely loud and passionate in their support, there are very few safety problems helped partially by the small numbers of travelling fans. In the past few seasons, there have been some clashes against supporters of Marseille and PSG but the vast majority of games end peacefully with both sets of fans mixing on the tram back to the city.

Explore the city on wheels as Bordeaux is a very nice city for practising roller-skating (or roller-blading) and other "skating sports".

Other sports that enjoy some support in Bordeaux include ice hockey, handball and rugby. The two Bordeaux rugby clubs Stade Bordelais and Bègles merged in 2006 to form Union CABBG, more commonly known as Bordeaux-Bègles. The club plays in the Top 14, the top tier of France's national leagues and usually plays its home games at Stade Chaban Delmas to the west of the city centre. Tickets for the seated stands start at 10 euros.

Bordeaux Cricket Club are the vice champions of France and play regularly at Château Giscours in Médoc. Attendance is free and greatly encouraged.
