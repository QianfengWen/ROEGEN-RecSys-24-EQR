Mombasa is 's second largest city and a sea port.
Understand

Mombasa is Kenya's main tourist destination. It is located on the Eastern coastline of Kenya bordering the Indian Ocean which has made it a popular destination for its beaches. Mombasa offers diverse marine life, world-class hotels and a friendly atmosphere. There is a tropical climate all year; it is a great destination filled with activities for all ages. 

Mombasa is a Swahili founded and ruled city. It was founded between the 1st and 5th century. At certain times it was occupied by the Portuguese, Arabs and British and originated back in the 16th century. Mombasa's culture today still exhibits that of its past. Historical ruins like Forte Jesus de Mombaça (Fort Jesus), an historic Portugese fort, and the Old Town are attractions influenced by Mombasa's trade culture, with many examples of Portuguese and Islamic architecture.

Get in

By plane
The airport in Mombasa has been newly renovated and has increased the frequency of flights in and out of Mombasa from European cities. Kenya Airways offers the most as far as options for traveling to/from Mombasa.

By train
The city is also accessible by train from Nairobi, with two departures daily in each direction. The actual schedule is available at The old train connection between Mombasa and Nairobi (13h train ride over night) stopped running in May-2017. The new connection is much faster (about 6h), but the railway station in Mombasa is not in the city center anymore, but about 15 km outside Mombasa. Online booking is not available yet (in December 2017). You can buy tickets at the train station or under the local number 0709388888 or on their website. Do not use the pay later option as that does not work reliably. In order to pay directly when buying the ticket through the website you need the mobile pay service M-Pesa, which requires that you have a Kenian phone number (or find someone to assist you who has one). The first class costs 3.000 KSH, second class (economy) 1000 KSH, which is cheaper than the buses. You should book as early as possible (up to 14 days in advance) in high and holiday seasons. There are extensive security checks at the station so plan to be there ahead of time (minimum one hour before departures). The trains depart on time.

By bus
Buses, while not a major mode of transportation within the city, are mostly used for traveling outside the city. The major provider of transportation in Mombasa is Matatu; the fleet consists mostly of fourteen-seater minibuses. Matatu is quite popular with the residents.

An easier alternative is a shuttle bus, at the moment there is one company ( Hakuna Mutatu Bus) operating on the Kenya Coast and a ride to Mombasa From Diani or Kilifi costs roughly Ksh 1000 and takes 1hr 30. The shuttle bus is a door-to-door service, meaning you will be collected from your current accommodation in Diani, Kilifi or Watamu and dropped directly at your next accommodation in Mombasa, which makes it an attractive option.

Get around
By taxi from center: to south beaches ; ca 30-35 dollar. To airport:10-12 dollar
Matatu (minibus) in city Ksh 50 (0,65)

Travel by the local bus-taxis (Matatus)-they are mini-buses that are usually full of people to maximum capacity. They're cheap. The name derives from a Swahili term that refers to 'ma'penny - the original matatu cost three cents many years ago. They are all over and in huge numbers, and they're licensed (stickers on the windshields). They are privately owned mini-buses regulated by the government. They are subject to extensive regulatory controls; a driver and bus can be pulled for the driver wearing a loud shirt. Taxis don't have taxi-signs on the roof, but license papers stuck to the windshields.

One can also travel using auto rickshaw's (locally called tuk-tuks) which are three wheeled private taxis. They cost about the same as Matatus. Moving from one part to the city to another is quick with these "bikes". Ideally use them for distances below 20km as they can be noisy. On the plus side they are quite airy and allow you to take in the scenary as you go by.

See
*Bombolulu Workshops was founded in 1969 and is a project of the Association for the Physically Disabled in Kenya (APDK). This center is a popular attraction for tourists and has 150 disabled employees who create jewelry, textiles, wood and leather crafts. It is the largest rehabilitation center in Kenya. 
*Attributes to Mombasa cultural diversity. Tourist/visitors are able to go inside the Temple accompanied by a guide from the Temple. Inside you will be able to see artifacts, idols and cultural pictures/paintings. 
* On Moi Avenue. The tusks were built in 1956 to celebrate Princess Margaret's visit to Mombasa town. They are located at the entrance to the city; they are not made of ivory as is sometimes thought, but of aluminum. An interesting thing to note is that the tusks form dual archways over each side of the road creating the shape in entirety of an 'M' for Mombasa or Margaret! 

Do
*Old Town. Located around Ft. Jesus, this historic district has mostly been converted into souvenir shops and restaurants. A nice place to explore on a Sunday when much of the city is closed down. Old town depicts the arab and swahili culture back in the day and the remnants are still visible. It's a must visit when you visit Mombasa. There is a lovely souvenir and jewelry stop opposite the fish market going by the name of AQEEQ GALLERIA whereby African gemstones and souvenirs are on display. Run by a family, definitely worth a visit. 

* Colobus Trust nature walks and conservation volunteering at Diani Beach.

*Mtwapa Creek is a place to visit on Mombasa's North Coast. An Indian Ocean inlet with some small marinas and beautiful tropical vegetation. Very famous for bird watching, mountain bike tours around the creek, and starting point for deep sea fishing trips. Mtwapa is also famous in Mombasa for its clubs and active nightlife. To get here from the city center, take a matatu from Digo road. 
 
*Nyali Theatre featuring Hollywood and Bollywood new releases (500 KSH), with bowling alley, casino, and Italian Restaurant. Have some Indian bhelpuri, a type of chaat (hot puffed rice, vegetables and tangy tamarind sauce) while you're there. Taxi from centre - 800 KSH, Tuk Tuk- 300 KSH. Matatus plying the Mkomani or Nyali routes - 30 ksh (Ask to alight at "Cinemax").

*Visit unspoilt Funzi Island via Dhow (traditional Arab sailing ship), explore Ramisi River Mangroves by canoe for crocs and lots of bird life up close, bathe on a magical sandbank in the Indian Ocean, feast on a lobster and seafood BBQ on Robinson Crusoe Island.
*Small zoo that feels like a park. Animals include giraffes, hippos (2), monkeys, and a reptile house. Guides speak English, Spanish, French and other languages. Watch out for the monkeys. They are numerous and appear friendly but do occasionally bite. 

*For South Coast adventures, Avicennia Island is unbeatable. Kayak silently through submerged mangrove forests; swim & sunbathe in the emerald waters of the Funzi Sandbar, enjoy a sumptuous seafood barbeque meal served at a delightful wooden banda (open structure, beach house, or shelter, sheltered from the elements).
*Mombasa's motor sport arena – a place to chill with your friends and thrill with your kids. Whether you’re a budding Schumacher or a first-time driver, Mombasa Go-Karting has the experience and technical know-how to put you on the right track.There is a viewing veranda located in the bar and you can order food from the bar whilst you are watching the action on the track. 

* Shimba Hills National Park: the approximately 30km south of Mombasa situated National Park is mountainous with lush tropical vegetation. This makes it particularly attractive as most other well-known national parks of Kenya have steppe-like vegetation. The main attractions include the elephant habitat, the stocks of antelopes, the waterfall, the Mwaluganje forest and the many vantage points of the fabulous landscape.

* Enjoy the famous night life of Mombasa. The night life and entertainment in Mombasa is broad and offers something for every taste. Many bars, pubs and nightclubs in many price ranges offer something for every taste and budget. From local bars to exclusive lounge bar, everything is available. In the city center there are numerous coffee shops, small pubs and bars as well as some small to medium sized clubs. Nightlife "special kind" is mainly found in the village , north of Mombasa. Its called "the village that never sleeps".

Beaches of the North Coast
* English point: Tiny sandy beach at Mkomani with view over the old town. Its a nice place to go but less for swimming than to enjoy the view.
* Nyali Beaches: nice sandy beaches but due to the close distance to the town the water quality is poor and polluted. Its nice to walk along the shore when when you get tired of the hotel pools.
* Bamburi Beach: Very nice beach with white sand and palm trees. Water quality is much better than at Nyali beach. Restaurants along the beach invite to sit under palm trees drinking a cold beer while watching people pass by. Du to the closeness to the town the beach is overcrowded on weekends or holidays.

* Shanzu Beach: Very nice beach with white sand and palm trees. Less crowded than Bamburi beach.

Beaches of the South Coast
*Tiwi Beach is a place to visit on Mombasa's South Coast. Quiet beach not spoiled by mass tourism. At low tide, you can swim in a tidal pool where tropical fish are trapped until the next tide comes in. Be careful to avoid the many sea urchins. Though there are relatively few people, there is a small cafe serving food and drinks. To get to Tiwi from Mombasa, take the Likona ferry to the south by taxi (ca $ 50,00) from Mombasa city center. Alternatively, take public transportation from the city center by catching a matatu on Digo Road across from the post office. The matatu route is aptly named "Ferry" and the matatu touts will be happy to point out the correct vehicle. The matatu drops passengers just outside the ferry, which is free for pedestrians. Take a another matatu going to Diani, but alight early at "Tiwi Spot". Hire one of the many motorbikes plying the main road to carry you the relatively short distance to the beach, since muggings have previously occurred on this stretch of road.
*Diani Beach is the place to go. A fantastic long white beach with loads of watersports and primates to see. A night at '40 Thieves' beach bar is a great place to hang out with a few tuskers (beers). If you want to see one of the six primate species in South Coast Kenya visit the Colobus Trust, dedicated to primate rescue, research and conservation, for an informative walk and you may spot one of the many wild primates.
