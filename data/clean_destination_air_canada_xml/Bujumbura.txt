Bujumbura is the largest city of .

Get in
1st language is Kirundi, 2nd is French, only a few speak English.

The airport is 10km from the city centre. As of June 2019, taxis between the airport and city centre cost US$20 or BIF 30,000.

As of June 2019, there are no buses running directly between Bujumbura and Kigali in Rwanda. Volcano Express runs buses from Kigali to the Kanyaru border (4h, RWF 3,840) at 5am, 6am, 8am, 10am, and 11:30am. Once across, there are waiting shared taxis onward to Bujumbura (3h, BIF 15,000).

Visa rules and prices change frequently. In October 2022 a 30 day visa on arrival costs $100 at Bujumbura Airport. In June 2019, it is not possible to obtain a visa on arrival at land borders.

It is relatively simple to arrange a visa via email with the Burundi Embassy in Kigali, Uganda (ambabukgl1@yahoo.fr), with the submission of an application form, copy of your passport photo page, and copy of a passport photo; submitted 10 days ahead of time. A 3-day visa costs US$40, a 30-day multiple-entry visa costs US$90, a 2-month multiple-entry visa costs US$180, and a 3-month multiple-entry visa costs US$270. Once in Rwanda, you would need to may a payment through the Bank of Kigali, and present the receipt to the Burundi Embassy. If arranged in advance, you can collect the visa with a single trip to the Embassy.

Get around
Taxis are cruising all over town; negotiate the price with them before the ride as taxi drivers and most businessmen try to charge more for tourists. As of October 2022, rides around 2 kilometers are between 3-4k BIF; a ride from downtown to the beach clubs bora bora, club du lac tanganyka and saga beach are around 12k BIF

Small yellow tuk tuk ("bagage") trikes are no longer allowed to operate within the city, and are banned along with motorcycle and bicycle taxis in Bujumbura proper (north of Kanyosha) 

Burundians typically rely on the many mini-buses, costing BIF600 to anywhere in city centre in 2022, and BIF1000 to the suburbs. Minibuses serving the north of the city arrive and depart at the front of the central market (marché central), while those heading south use the parking lot in the back of the market near the Interbank head office. The last mini-buses leave around 22:00 as of 2011. It is not advised to walk at night after that; if you need to go anywhere, take a taxi.

To catch a lift in any type of vehicle from the side of the road, hold out your hand with your palm facing upward. This works for taxis, buses, motorcycles, and all sorts of private and commercial vehicles. Mini-bus conductors will honk and use their fingers to show how many seats are available. If the bus is full, they will wave their hand with their palm facing downward. It is not uncommon for private vehicles to pick up foreigners requesting lifts during the daytime. They range from high-end SUVs driven by white-collar workers to flat bed pickup trucks where you must stand up. Payment is generally not expected for hitchhiking short distances, but working-class Burundians regularly give each other money for small favours, so there is no harm in offering.

If you want to drive a car: Burundians don't have a driving licenses that meet international standards, so there are basically no rules on the streets of Burundi and as a consequence they love to push in and use every possible space from every possible direction. It is advisable to do it like the Burundians and honk before every potentially dangerous situation as many of them show poor situational awareness and driving style is "naturally impulsive". Sometimes gas stations run out of fuel for days. It is advisable to have the tank at least half full at all times.

See
*Small zoo and natural history museum. Exhibits include chimpanzees, a leopard, crocodiles, birds and snakes. Entrance to the zoo BIF 5,000 for non-residents, a guide will show you around. For an additional BIF 4000, the guide will feed live rabbits and Guinea pigs to the crocodiles, leopard and snakes. 
There’s also a traditional Burundian hut on the grounds. Sometimes, local cultural events occur on the grounds, such as performances by the Burundian drummers. If you just want to see the hut or the exhibition grounds, look at the souvenirs stalls or have a cold beer, you do not have to pay entrance - just turn left after entering the Musée and walk towards the Amstel sign. Continuing to reach the exhibition grounds, the hut is on your left hand side, somewhat hidden between the vegetation.

*See hippos and crocodiles sunning themselves on the banks of the Rusizi River. The area is also where Gustave, the world's largest Nile crocodile, has been spotted. There are also some amazing birds to be seen. For about BIF3,000 per person (plus tip), a guide and a guard will join you in the car and give you a tour of the park. You’ll stop at several points along the water to view hippos, crocodiles, and birds. For BIF100,000 you can have a boat tour for up to 8 people lasting 30 to 45 minutes. This will get you even closer to hippos, crocodiles, birds and out to Lake Tanganyika. Best time is the morning from 07:30.
*It's not the spot where Stanley said "Dr. Livingstone, I presume," but it has a gorgeous view of the lake. Livingstone and Stanley passed through the area and a monument has later been raised.
* Go for scenic drives (security permitting!) for spectacular views from the hills of Bujumbura Rurale to the east of town or along Lake Tanganyika to the south of town. Find a place to enjoy banana beer or maybe a Fanta and chit-chat with store keepers.

Do

Beach
Hippos are very fast & dangerous and can appear everywhere on the shore of the lake Tanganyika - the 2nd largest and 2nd deepest lake in the world. Only the locals can be seen in the lake. Beaches are 20 minutes West of town in the vicinity of the airport.

* Beach Club west of the town where the young, beautiful and rich meet. Lovely garden and architecture, stunning views to the lake, Pool, Beach Volleyball.

* Nice beach resort.

* Beach with restaurant, entertainment complex, and hotel. Nice place to pass some time.

* Beach hut with restaurant. Very slow

Nature
*A local conservation group that conducts birdwatching tours of Rusizi Park and other areas. Some of their guides speak English.

Culture
*Check local flyers for information on Burundian drummer performances, or just be on the look out for a wedding reception taking place somewhere. With help from locals, you can also arrange to visit a drum troupe, get a lesson, and then see a private performance.

*Many activities are organized by the Centre Culturel Francais (CCF), Chaussee Prince Louis Rwagasore, +257 222351 (City Centre). Extensive monthly film, theatre and music program available from their offices. CCF also offers courses in French and Kiswahili (individual and group).

*Ciné Caméo (19 Avenue des Paysans),in the Asiatic quarter screens all the latest blockbusters for about BIF2000. The only cinema in the country, and a place to enjoy some air conditioning on hot dry season nights. November 2020 - out of service

Sports
Several swimming pools available for who wants to cool down from the hot days. 
*Federation Football (soccer) games at the Stade in Rohero are at 14:00 and 16:00 on Saturdays. Entrance as of late 2011 was BIF500 regular and BIF2000 first class.
*Université de Burundi ("Collège") has a large swimming pool with high-dive and a spectacular view of Bujumbura and Lake Tanganyika. The entrance fee is 300 francs to be allowed onto the campus (payable at the shed on the left directly after the gate, make sure that you'll get a receipt) and 2000 francs for the swimming pool (payable at the entrance of the swimming pool). There is a small bar on the overlook above the pool that is good for sundowners. Many people run up the mountain, through Kiriri to the University, a grueling run but worth the beer at the top. Otherwise, you can take a bus to Collège from the bus parking south of the (burnt down) central market, the university campus is the last stop (500 francs uphill, 400 downhill).
*Entente Sportive, Av du Stade. Daily 07:00-19:00, BIF 5.000 per day / BIF 50.000 per month (June 2021). Old colonial entourage. Length of the pool 33m!

Viewpoints
*War Memorial at the top end of Ave Belvedere - for great sunset views. The Belvedere and Chez Vaya restaurants are nearby and offer equally good views - although during weekdays they only open at 6.30PM - after sunset.

Buy
Interbank has several ATMs in Bujumbura that accept international MAESTRO & VISA debit cards but they charge BIF5000 for each transaction and exchange rates are poor. Cash in Euros or USD recommended. When changing money at a forex bureau or on the street, be aware that only US dollar bills dated Series 2006 or newer will be accepted.

Groceries
Most of the things that one needs can be found in one of the stalls in the Central Market. Stiff is needed to get it for the right price. Little boys sell plastic bags for BIF100 at the market. The Central Market and the very crowded big vegetable market at the bus station is the favourite area of criminals. They will cut your bag to get your purse or mobile phone.
November 2020: no need to worry about pickpockets anymore as the central market burnt down years ago, no signs of imminent reconstruction
 
Small supermarkets can be found all over town. They normally stock imported goods at a luxury price. 

The Italian-Christian grocery "Mutoj" is the nicest store in town, 10 Minutes out of the city centre on the Avenue Des Etats-Unis (close to Boulevard du 28 Novembre). The store is very clean, they have a great selection of vegetables, fresh meat, grilled chicken, milk, yoghurt, cheese, pastries, ice-cream, snacks, water, kitchenware, and the prices are very reasonable.

"Bon prix" on the Boulevard du 28 Novembre (close to Avenue Mujinga) has a good selection of imported food, local cheese, sausage and fresh vegetables.

The largest supermarket in town is "Dimitri" on the little roundabout of Chaussee Prince Louis Rwagazore and Av du Congo. The selection of fresh vegetables is very limited but you get cheese, snacks, sausage, chocolate, kitchenware, water, spices.

The Greek owned Boucherie Nouvelle on Av du Congo is worth a visit. Always busy, but then it offers a wide variety of meat, cheese and charcuterie. Opposite the shop you find vendors with exclusive and rare vegetables and in the rainy season wild mushrooms of all kinds. Be prepared for a repetitive approach and attention engaging you in persuasive sales techniques.

Souvenirs
*The best place to buy souvenirs is the small curio market on Av de Stade. 
*Another small curio market is found on Chaussee Prince Louis Rwagazore, opposite Library St. Paul.

Eat
The people in Bujumbura love their food and enjoy eating out with friends or family. A beef or fish brochette, chips or fried plantain and a fresh salad is available in all restaurants. But take your time. All food is freshly prepared and the cooks take time. Waiting an hour before the food arrives is certainly not abnormal. 

Restaurants are scattered all over town, but the best are located in Rohero and Kiriri. 

Some restaurants that are worth a visit are:

*Ask the taxi driver. It is located on a residential street (ADD DIRECTIONS). The food is amazing and comparable to Chinese food in NYC and even in China

*Le Plaisir Avenue de l'Amitié beside Radio Isanganiro. Popular restaurant serving Burundian dishes. Busy for lunch, especially if you want a table upstairs. Menu items are not always available, so it is best to ask the server what is available. The Sangala fish topped with onions is excellent, and the stewed beef (lunch only) is very reasonably priced.
*Oasis Greek restaurant and pizza on the main drag in town - next to Havana. Excellent Greek mezze.
*Pont Muha, (continue Bld de la Liberte till you reach the river Muha). Best Burundian brochettes in town. If you are hungry take the brochette Hôtelière.

*Shanghai, Avenue Muyinga (coming from the central market, take the Chaussée Prince Louis Rwagasore and turn left just before the Alimentation Escale du Bien - it's about 600 m up the Av. Muyinga, opposite a kindergarten). Best Chinese in town. Very fast service (in and out in less than an hour), also open for lunch.
*Taj Mahal, Chaussée Prince Louis Rwagasore, Indian food.
*Good Indian food

Kiriri
*Belvedere, Avenue de Belvedere. Dining with a superb view over the city. Also open for lunch. Expensive.

Lake Tanganyika
*Bora Bora Beautiful Beach Club west of the town where the young, beautiful and rich meet. Lovely garden and architecture, stunning views to the lake. Great for a sundowner. Food on the other hand is high priced low quality fastfood.
*Cercle Nautique de Bujumbura, Avenue de la Plage. The food is not impressive, but the views (on a clear day) on Lake Tanganyika and the mountains of Congo (DRC) are unforgettable. As of late 2011, new owners have maintained the same prices but brought with them a miniscule that in no way reflects the offerings of the original menu, and shoddy service. On rare occasions you can see hippos in the evening time.
*Ubuntu, Avenue de la Plage. Nice garden setting in deluxe hotel with great pizzeria and great view to the lake tangyanika where you can see hippos on rare occasions. The garden also houses several turtles, peacocks, and has two beautiful crested cranes (exotic bird). Live music on Sunday evening from 1800h. Pizzas from BIF9000

Drink
*At Av. Kunkiko in quartier Rohero II you'll find this quality restaurant with a buffet every Friday evening and Sunday afternoon and evening. The cozy bar with a colourfull dans-night on Friday has a happy hour between 18:00 and 19:00 hours.
Several bars are located on Av de l'Universite (between Bld de l'Independence and Blv Mao Tse Tung).

The best known places for a transnight dance are l'Archipel and Havana. L'Archipel can be found at Blv de la Liberté and Havana is on Blv de Uprona (around the corner of the Novotel).
*Outdoor 'cabaret' features live singing on weekend nights, popular with the college-aged crowd. Probably not wise during the raining season as there is no roof. They usually run out of cold beer early in the evening. (Many Burundians actually prefer their beer warm.) Food is available from the calmer place across the street.
*Dominoes Restaurant is just 5 minutes from Bujumbura town centre Fantastic Gardens,Great food and drink with a good variety of dishes at fair prices. Great place to play Petanque, and bring the children, it's a cool place to go good for a romantic evening, or lean on the bar and play Dominoes...later in the evening we move tables and dance the night away to great music. Welsh man owned so your sure of a warm welcome and great service. It is in a safe secure place. Just Honk at the Gate to come in.

Stay safe
Bujumbura is a moderately safe city, but common sense prevails. Walking around during the day should be fine, but at dusk (18:00) the streets rapidly get very dark and you are best off getting a taxi except for very short walks. The area near the port feels pretty dodgy day or night. 

The central market and big vegetable market at the bus station is the area of thieves. They are after your purse and your mobile phone. At the crowded vegetable market they will cut your bag to get what they want. Pockets with buttons are recommended.

*Cars: Thieves are after mirrors, turn indicator lights, antennas. It may be advisable to pay the idling boys or security guards to look after your car about BIF200 for 30 minutes. 

*Beggars: Some adults use children other than their own for begging. Protect the children and give them food (peanuts, boiled eggs, milk, proteins) or clothes instead of money.
