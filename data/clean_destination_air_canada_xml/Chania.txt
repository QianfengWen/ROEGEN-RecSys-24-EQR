By ferry
Ferry services from Athens (Piraeus port) to Chania (Hania) anchor at the nearby port of Souda. Daily ferries, one ordinary with ANEK and one fast catamaran with Hellenic Seaways. The port of Souda is not properly organized and finding taxis on the spot is extremely difficult, so to avoid being stuck in the middle of nowhere make sure you have already arranged for a taxi to pick you up.

By bus
Chania is connected with the rest of Crete by regular bus lines operated the KTEL company The coaches are modern, comfortable and air-conditioned. Fare is reasonable. Public transportation is fairly frequent and timetables quite trustworthy. Bus services along the north coast and towards the south coast are excellent, reliable, frequent and cheap. Bus fare to Rethimno is around seven euros (two hours), Hiraklio 14 euro (three hours). If you pay on the bus, be sure to examine your change as there have been reports of conductors giving the old 500 lira coin back instead of the 2 euro coin.

By car
Highway E75 (A90) goes along the North coast of Crete from to Kissamos, it goes by the southern outskirts of the town. The old road, that still has the name 90, is parallel to the new highway and is the main road through all the small resorts west of Chania.

Get around
If you are on Crete to see the 'real Crete', as opposed to the night clubs for tourists, then visiting the villages of the island is a must. All Cretan culture can be seen, heard and tasted in the villages. The Cretans at work or at leisure will always welcome visitors and show you how to do things the correct way. All villages have a central kafenion (coffee shop) which is where all people eventually end up. The kafenion, apart from being a place to meet friends for a coffee, raki or a game of tavli (backgammon), is used as the main information center of the village. Be aware, however, that the kafenion is still very much a male dominion and women are generally not found inside (as opposed to a kafeteria or regular cafe), though the local custom of philoxenia(hospitality) usually ensures that Western couples and mixed groups are accepted. Most villages have war memorials and the locals will willingly fill in any missing information. Gavalohori has a wonderful Folklore Museum where much about village life can be learned.

In order to visit the best beaches of Crete and to see the interesting archaeological sites of Crete, it is a must to rent a car. There are many companies with car rentals that provide services.

See

* Chania Municipal Agora. Built in 1913 as vegetable, fish and meat market for the city of Chania, it officially opened to the public 3 days after the union of the island of Crete with Greece. The architect, K. Drandakis, built the market were the mortar of the southern venetian walls were. This is evident by the difference of height between the north and south entrance to the building. During the Nazi occupation, most of the marketplace was used as a storage space for the German army. Today, although there are some shops selling local products, there are also many souvenir stores. Entrance is free.

* Chania Cathedral Trimartiti. Chalidon street. The church was built in 1860 during the Ottoman rule of the island. On the same site there was an original Byzantine church that had been converted into a soap factory after the sack of the city by the Ottoman Turks in 1645. The architectural style has influences from the venetian style and also the 'eikones', paintings of saints in the church itself are not according to the strict Byzantine style. On the contrary, the western influence is evident with background colours and softer facial features. Entrance Free.

* Our Lady Catholic Church. Chalidon street. It was built in 1879 in the site of a Capuccin monastery in existence since 1566. For a time the monks also ran a hospital. Free Entrance.

* Until 1999 Etz Hayyim was a desecrated house of prayer that remained the sole Jewish monument on the Island of Crete after the destruction of Crete's Jewish community in 1944. Essentially it stood as a monument to the success of the Nazis in obliterating 2300 years of Jewish life on the Island of Crete. Between 1996 and the year of its rededication in 1999, the structure was painstakingly restored. The philosophy that directed this work is summed up in the Hebrew Am Israel Hayy:The people of Israel Live'. Today it stands as a vibrant statement of Jewish life, vitality and values, whereas until recently it was still mentioned on the World Monument Fund's list of most endangered sites. 

* The Archaeological Museum of Hania Chalidon street. The original edifice was built in 1605 as a Franciscan Monastery dedicated to St Francis of Assisi. Before being turned into a museum it was converted into a mosque and a cinema. It now houses the Archaeological Collection of the city with findings from ancient Kydoniai (Chania) and Aptera. There is also a recent collection added by the ex-Prime Minister Konstantinos Mitsotakis who is born in Chania.

* The Grand Arsenali. Port. The buildings in this part of the port were basically store rooms for the venetian fleet. In fall, the Venetians would pull their ships out of the sea, repair and store them until spring. The building itself, built in 1585 was also used as a school, a theatre, a hospital, the city Town house. Currently, it is being used as the Center of Mediterranean Architecture.

* The Minoan Ship. Last Arsenali at the far end of the port. In 2003, a replica of the merchant ships that the Minoans used to control the trade in the eastern Mediterranean was built in Chania. Its maiden voyage was to Athens for the opening ceremony of the Athens 2004 Olympic Games. It's worth having a look.

* Splatzia Square. Easily reached from Daskalogianni street behind the Agora. A huge plain tree stands in the middle of the square where you will find cretan men drinking 'tsikoudia' a local spirit. Behind, you will find St Nikolas' church. Originally built for the Dominican Order it was turned into a mosque during the Ottoman occupation and now it is an Orthodox church. The minarets have recently been restored and not surprisingly, they do not follow the Ottoman architectural style but a more western venetian influence.

* Dikastiria Square. This square is dominated by the neoclassical building of the Court House. It is a nice part of town to sit back and enjoy coffee. From the square, Iroon Polytechniou street, lined with fine examples of Neoclassical architecture reminiscent of the time the Chania was the capital of the short lived Cretan Republic, leads to the sea and the Koum Kapi beach and coffee shop area. Dimokratias Avenue will take you back to the Agora through upmarket boutiques and the more exclusive shopping area of the city. 

* Venizelos Family Tomb. This area also known as Profitis Ilias is situated on a hill above the city. Access is easy by buses leaving from outside the National Bank of Greece opposite the Agora. Eleftherios Venizelos was a politician that marked Greek history of the 20th century and was born in Chania. The view, especially in the late afternoon is breathtaking. There are coffee shops at the level of and below the tombs. Don't forget your camera.

Do
* The venetian port. This is probably one of the most picturesque ports of the country. It is lined with a number of coffee shops and restaurants and is frequented not only by tourists but also by locals who on cool summer evenings stroll up and down. Reaching the port from Chalidon street there are a number of monuments to look out for. In front of you you can see the light house which was built during the Venetian rule of the city in 1595 and is considered to be one of the oldest standing lighthouses intenationally. It has undergone renovations at least 5 times and is considered to be the landmark of the city. Opposite the lighthouse you can find the Frikas Fortess which houses the naval museum, is still a military base and were the Greek flag was first raised after unification with Greece in 1931. To your right is the Yiali Tzami , the Sea mosque, built by an Armenian architect in the late 17th century. Today, it is used as a municipal art gallery. Free Entrance.

*See the German Cemetery on Kaukales hill at Maleme. It is a haunting experience as on the graves there are names of 16 year old German soldiers. This was the site of the first airborne attack in the history of mankind. The Battle of Crete is thought of as one of the most glorious moments in Greek history as it took the Nazis the same amount of time to sweep through Holland, Belgium and central and northern France as it took them to conquer Crete. Don't be surprised if you see Kyria Eleni, and old woman dressed in black lighting candles for the dead soldiers. If asked why, she will tell you that she hopes that some german daughter will be doing the same for her father who was exterminated in a concentration camp. You can also see the historical airport battlefield and for nature lovers the beach of Gerani where the sea turtle Caretta Caretta is preserved.

*Samaria gorge is a popular day trip from Chania. A word of warning, make sure you are wearing good quality walking shoes/ hiking boots/ trainers with sticks. Tourists trying to cross the gorge in flipflops, and trendy sandals end up walking barefoot and in pain. The nature and landscape are amazing; the gorge is home to a protected (under extinction) goat. The sea at the far end of the gorge in Agia Roumeli is absolutely amazing, crystal clear and turquoise.

*Walking in the Botanical park & Gardens of Crete offes spiritual tranquility and visual pleasure in addition to knowledge on plants and their material . Nearly 20 hectares of land are waiting to welcome you, full of fruit trees from all over the world, herbs, medicinal and ornamental plants in a park different from others, where the land’s formation and the region’s microclimate make it a paradise for hundreds of plants and animals! In the midst of this colorful and vivid landscape stands a burnt centennial olive tree, a memorial and a reference to the dismal fires of 2003, the park’s history and origin. The newest and one of the most interesting sites of the Prefecture of Chania lies only 18 kilometers outside the city, on the feet of the White Mountains.

Stay safe
Be extremely careful when driving or crossing the roads, especially in rural areas, as traffic laws are not enforced and you will encounter many agressive or drunk drivers. The Cretan landscape, like most other parts of Greece, features some very steep and dangerous cliffs that are crossed by narrow and serpentine roads; driving through them requires vigilant and very cautious driving. Avoid travelling large distances in the night; except from all the risks mentioned above you will have to drive under very poor visibility, since the roads outside the city are not illuminated. However despite the risks, renting a car is still recommended if you understand the risks and take all the necessary precautions, as there are many excursions which are really rewarding and relying on the public transportation can significantly degrade your experience.

Apart from that, Chania is a small town with decent people and any form of crime is very rare. You should be careful around immigrants and gypsies as they are sometimes involved in petty crimes. Avoid drunken NATO soldiers during the night as they are notorious troublemakers. Cretan people are very proud and are known for having unecessary fights, often involving guns.
