Jacksonville is situated on the Atlantic coast of northeast Florida. It is the most populous city in the state of Florida measured by the number of residents. But Jacksonville covers an enormous area, and is in fact the largest city in area in the continental United States. The city has a large area, but also has a low density rate. The metropolitan area extends beyond Duval County into Nassau, St. Johns, Baker and Clay counties and has a population of more than 1.25 million people. The city's metropolitan population is not the largest in Florida, it is exceeded by the Miami-Fort Lauderdale area, Tampa, and Orlando metro areas.

Understand
Jacksonville is widely known as a hard-working, blue-collar city. While a substantial portion of Jacksonville's economy is supported by both of its large U.S. Navy bases (Naval Air Station Jacksonville and Naval Station Mayport), it is also a hotbed for the banking, logistics, insurance, and healthcare sectors. The downtown skyline, notable for its bridges of various styles and colors, spans along the St. Johns River with a pedestrian river walk located on each bank. Although the bulk of Jacksonville's population is suburban in nature and spread throughout Duval County, renewed development efforts are currently underway in the urban core along with preservation efforts in its historic districts.
Jacksonville is nicknamed JAX, or 'The Bold City'

Get around

Unless you want to spend a lot of time waiting for buses, a car is a must to fully experience Jacksonville; due to Jacksonville's size and low density, most destinations are not within walking distance of each other. Mass transit is limited to the city bus system, and an elevated rail system in the downtown district that links both banks of the river with a crossing on the Acosta Bridge. The bus system is minimally adequate; no bus runs past midnight, and many bus routes stop running at around 8 or 9PM. All buses are linked via GPS to a central control system and stops are well-marked throughout the entire city. 
Bus
*Jacksonville Transportation Authority, Phone: (904) 630-3100, The bus system is fairly extensive in scope, but you must plan ahead as the frequency of stops is between 30 minutes to an hour. Buses are air-conditioned and reasonably comfortable, but JTA buses struggle with on-time performance.
Taxi
Taxi services are available, but expensive due to the sprawl of the city.
