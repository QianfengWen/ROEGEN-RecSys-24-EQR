Oyama (小山, is the second most populous city in southern , .

Get in
Oyama is above all a major train junction, and most visitors won't stop much longer than it takes to change trains. However, one of the minor thrills of Oyama is to stand on the Shinkansen platform and watch the through-trains barrel past at full throttle and full volume on the middle tracks away from either platform. 

By train
Oyama is on the Tōhoku Shinkansen between and , and is served by the Nasuno and Yamabiko all-stations services. There is one train per hour from Tokyo to Oyama, with more frequent trains for the peak-direction rush (42 minutes, &yen;3440 for an unreserved seat).

Oyama also lies at the intersection of the JR Tohoku Line, which runs north-south between Utsunomiya and Ueno; the JR Mito Line, which runs east to the historic city of ; and the JR Ryōmō Line, which runs west to , where the Jōetsu Shinkansen (toward ) splits off from the Nagano Shinkansen. 

Local trains from Ueno to Oyama on the Tohoku Line, the section of which is also referred to as the Utsunomiya Line, take 75 minutes at a cost of &yen;1280. Some rapid services during rush hours cut this time down to as little as 60 minutes.

There is no cost to use JR train services with the Japan Rail Pass.

By car
Oyama also lies at the intersection of two major national highways: National Route 50, which runs east-west between Mito and Takasaki, and National Route 4, which runs north-south between Tokyo and .

If you want to grab a quick meal between trains, try the ground floor food court below the Val department store at the West Exit.
