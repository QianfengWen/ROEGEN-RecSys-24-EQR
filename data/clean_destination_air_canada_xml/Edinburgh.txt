Edinburgh (Gaelic: Dùn Èideann; is the capital of located in the region of the country. With a population of approximately 450,000 (1 million in the city region), "Auld Reekie" (Edinburgh) manages to combine both ancient and modern in a uniquely Scottish atmosphere. Watched over by the imposing castle, the symbol of the city, Edinburgh combines medieval relics, Georgian grandeur and a powerful layer of modern life with contemporary avant-garde. In Edinburgh, medieval palaces rub shoulders with the best of modern architecture, Gothic churches with amazing museums and galleries. Scotland's throbbing night-life centre, Edinburgh, "the Athens of the North", is also a feast for the mind and the senses, playing host to great restaurants, shops and an unequaled programme of city festivals throughout the year. Hogmanay, the Scottish New Year, kicks off the festivities, which culminate in the high summer with the Tattoo, the International and the Fringe, amongst many others.

The Old and New Towns of Edinburgh were listed as by UNESCO in 1995. In 2004, Edinburgh became the first member of the initiative when it was designated a City of Literature.

In a 2009 poll by YouGov, Edinburgh was voted the most desirable city to live in the UK.

Understand

Edinburgh is on the west coast of Scotland's east Lowlands, situated on the southern shore of the Firth of Forth. Edinburgh's landscape is the product of ancient volcanism (both the Castle crag and Arthur's Seat are the eroded plugs of volcanoes) and more recent glaciation (carving out valleys south of the castle and the old Nor'Loch, presently the site of the Princes Street Gardens). Impress the locals by knowing that Princes Street is the correct spelling (dedicated plurally and not possessively for King George III's sons - hence the absence of an apostrophe). Don't make the mistake of pronouncing it Princess Street. And watch out for these two commonly mis-pronounced streets as well: Cockburn (coe-burn) and Buccleuch (buh-clue) are nearly always got wrong, to the amusement of the locals. 

Orientation
Edinburgh's historic centre is bisected by Princes Street Gardens, a broad swathe of parkland in the heart of the city. Southwards of the gardens is the castle, perched on top of an extinct volcanic crag, and flanked by the medieval streets of the following the Royal Mile along the ridge to the east. To the north of Princes Street Gardens lies Princes Street itself - Edinburgh's main shopping boulevard - and the Georgian period , built after 1766 on a regular grid plan.

History

Evidence suggests that humans have inhabited Edinburgh for millennia. Archeological findings indicate that humans lived in the area as early as 8500 BC, approximately 5,000 years before the Bronze Age. In the 600s, one of the first forts was erected. In the seventh century, the English invaded and named it “Eiden’s Burgh.” “Burgh” being a word for fort. A few centuries later, the Scots reclaimed their land and a castle was built. A small town sprang up, and by the 12th century, Edinburgh had become a thriving community.

The pattern of England gaining control of Edinburgh, being tossed out by the Scots, marshaling their troops, and marching back into battle repeated itself many times over the years. One battle, led by William Wallace, was made famous in the 1995 movie Braveheart. Upon Wallace’s resignation, the Scots nobles chose Robert the Bruce and John Comyn as the Guardians of Scotland. Bruce promptly murdered his rival, and in 1306, had himself crowned king.

Under Bruce’s leadership, England signed a treaty giving Scotland its independence and acknowledging Bruce as king. As a result of a charter written by Bruce shortly before his death, Edinburgh became one of Scotland’s most important royal burghs. When he died, England and Scotland promptly resumed their battles.

In the 15th century, Scotland and England became inextricably linked when the Scottish King James IV married the Tudor daughter of the English King Henry VII. James embodied the term “Renaissance Man.” During his reign the arts and sciences flourished. Unfortunately, the peaceful times didn't last long. The French persuaded James to go to war against his own in-laws and the battles raged again.

By the end of the 17th century, Edinburgh was in shambles. Its population had been severely decimated, first by plague and later by famine. Civil wars had left the economy in ruin. Edinburgh was unsanitary and overcrowded. England and Scotland agreed that peace was the only way out. The Act of Union was signed in 1707. Scotland was now governed by the same parliament and sovereign as England, but retained its own church and legal system.

Edinburgh began to flourish in the 18th century. “New Town” was designed to allow expansion out from the overcrowded and unsanitary conditions. The town gave birth to philosophers, physicists and chemists and the Scottish crown jewels were put on display in Edinburgh Castle.

In the 1800s, the Industrial Revolution introduced the citizens of Edinburgh to new industries. The population quadrupled, to a number almost equal to what it is today. Scotsman Robert Louis Stevenson published his classic works Treasure Island and The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

As the decades passed, Edinburgh continued to transform into the thriving city it is today. After World War II, Edinburgh launched its now famous Edinburgh International Festival. Its economy is thriving and the city has the highest percentage of professionals anywhere in the UK. Yet despite its modernities, the restored buildings, archaic street names and cobblestone streets still give visitors glimpses of Edinburgh's turbulent past.

Literature
Edinburgh is a literary city. So much so that, in 2004, Edinburgh became the first city to receive the designation UNESCO City of Literature. 

*Robert Louis Stevenson was born in Edinburgh in 1850. A sickly child, Stevenson was frequently confined to his bed. From his bedroom window, he could see a pond with an islet. It is thought that this view helped inspire Treasure Island. The protagonist of his novel, The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, also has his roots in Edinburgh. Growing up, Stevenson would have heard tales about William Brody. Brody was a respectable Edinburgh council member by day, and a thief and gambler at night. He was hanged in 1788.

*Scottish-born author Ian Rankin graduated from the University of Edinburgh in 1982. He then spent the next several years writing novels, time he was meant to spend earning his PhD in Scottish literature. Today, Rankin is Scotland's most successful fictional crime writer. His famous character, Detective John Rebus, frequents The Oxford Bar, which is a real pub in Edinburgh; located on Young Street. 

*The Encyclopedia Britannica was first published by a society located on Anchor Close, an alleyway that branches off Edinburgh's Royal Mile.

*J.K. Rowling, author of the Harry Potter series, did much of her writing at The Elephant House cafe on George IV Bridge. From the back room where she liked to sit, she would have had a clear view of an old Greyfriar's graveyard, and of a grave inscribed with the name "Thomas Riddell"; possibly the inspiration for Tom Riddle, the name of Harry Potter's nemesis.

*The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie is set in Edinburgh in the 1930s. It's publication brought its Scottish author, Muriel Spark, international fame. Today it is considered one of the top 100 novels of the 20th century. 

*Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's famous character, Sherlock Holmes, was inspired by a physician named Dr. Joseph Bell. Doyle met Bell whilst studying Medicine at the University of Edinburgh.

*Jules Verne, famous for 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and Around the World in 80 Days, set part of his story The Underground City in Holyrood Park.

*Sir Walter Scott, considered to be the founder of the historical novel, was born in Edinburgh and spent his life in Scotland. Much of his novel, The Heart of Midlothian, centers around the Old Tolbooth. For nearly two hundred years, from 1640-1817, the Old Tollbooth was Edinburgh's main jail. 

*Set in the port area of Trainspotting, by Irvine Welsh, revealed a side of Edinburgh never seen by tourists. This collection of short stories, later made into a film in 1996 by the same name, revealed an existing culture of violence and drug abuse.

*The cobblestone alleys, dark doorways and hidden squares and gardens of Royal Mile all combine to form a perfect eerie setting for James Hogg's The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner.

People
It's conceivable that some of Edinburgh’s current day residents could trace their family tree back for millennia. Historical findings indicate that people have lived in Scotland in general, and in Edinburgh in particular, since 8500 BC. With over 80% of Edinburgh’s current population either from Edinburgh or elsewhere in Scotland, it’s possible that their great-many-times-over grandparents emigrated to the country shortly before the start of the Iron Age.

For centuries, these early inhabitants eked out a living. The town did not really begin to grow until the twelfth century when David I built what would later become Edinburgh Castle and Holyrood Abbey. Over time, a town slowly grew up around these two landmarks. Along with the royals and castle inhabitants, there was a large concentration of friars. The rest of the town’s inhabitants were likely farmers, with perhaps a scattering of tradesmen.

For the next few centuries, Edinburgh continued to grow. The population swelled as people from outlying areas came to Edinburgh looking for work. Despite relatively frequent invasions by the English, rampant disease (a plague in the 1600s wiped out almost half of the population of the port town of ), famine and fires, the town continued to grow. 

Today, Edinburgh is home to just under 500,000 people. Despite the vast majority of people identifying themselves as “White,” Edinburgh is considered one of the more ethnically diverse places in Scotland. Asians in general, and immigrants from the Middle East in particular, comprise the largest subset of Edinburgh’s people.

Edinburgh is primarily home to young professionals. Close to 50% of those living there are between the ages of 16 and 44. Most people who live in Edinburgh either attend the university or are engaged in a white-collar profession. 

English is spoken almost exclusively. That being said, many travellers find it difficult to understand those who speak quickly and with a strong Scottish accent. On a rare occasion, it is possible to find an individual who also speaks Scots or Gaelic.

Edinburgh is not a particularly religious city. A little over 40% of the population consider themselves Christian, with many belonging to the Church of Scotland. Visitors to Edinburgh will also find followers and practitioners of Judaism, Hinduism, Buddism and Islam. A poll in 2011 also revealed that a minute number of residents identified their faith as “Jedi Knight.”

Profile
Edinburgh is noted as a long-lived literary capital of the English-speaking world.

The great Scottish historical novelist Sir Walter Scott was born in the city and has his great monument on Princes Street. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was also a native of Edinburgh.

More recently, Edinburgh has variously been the home and inspiration for such well-known modern writers as Muriel Spark (author of The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie), Irvine Welsh (author of the 1993 novel Trainspotting, set in the gritty district of Leith), Ian Rankin (a crime writer best known for the Inspector Rebus series, set in Edinburgh), Alexander McCall Smith (The No. 1 Lady Detective's Agency and several novels set in the Scottish capital) and J.K. Rowling of Harry Potter fame.

Climate

Speaking in vastly general terms, Edinburgh has a temperate (meaning mild or moderate) climate. During the course of a year, temperatures can range from a high of 71°F (22°C) to a low of 33°F (1°C). Weather, of course, has a mind of its own. While September tends to be the wettest month and April the driest, Edinburgh has no true dry season. Travelers are almost guaranteed that, no matter what time of year they visit, it’s going to rain at some point.

Summer, or the warm season, generally lasts from early June to the end of August or early September. The temperature during the day tends to hover in the mid-60s (approximately 18°C). Rain is not as common as at other times of the year, however showers and the occasional torrential downpour are not unheard of, so it's wise to pack raingear. July is the hottest month and August has still long days, 16 hours of daylight getting shorter over the month to 14 hours and a sunset at 8 pm.

Edinburgh’s winter typically starts in November and lasts through mid-March. January has historically featured the coldest temperatures. During winter, the temperature tends to hover in the low-40s (5-6°C). Showers and steady rain are a given during these months, interspersed with periods of sleet and even snow. Fortunately, Edinburgh offers plenty of indoor activities and tourists sometimes find the best flight and hotel deals during these months. Travelers should dress in layers so they can be comfortable indoors and out. Rain gear is a must.

The few months that bridge the cold and warm seasons (April and May in the spring, September and October in the fall) are the most changeable times of year as far as weather is concerned. As one city guide put it, it’s pretty common during these months to have four seasons worth of weather in a single day. During the cold season, travelers are advised to pack plenty of rain gear and to dress in layers to ensure they stay comfortable throughout the day.

When to go
Travellers should note that Edinburgh becomes overwhelmingly crowded (accommodation-wise) during the main festival periods of high summer (August to early September) and Hogmanay (around New Year's Day / 1 January). Visitors at these times should plan well ahead (even more than a year in advance!) for booking central accommodation and event tickets at these times.

By train

Wikitravel has a guide to 

The main railway station in Edinburgh is called Edinburgh Waverley Railway Station and is an attraction in itself. First opened in 1846, Edinburgh Waverley Station was rebuilt 1892-1902. It lies between the and Towns, adjacent to Princes Street, Edinburgh Castle and the Princes Street Gardens, where it serves over 14 million people per annum. Despite various refurbishments, the past still survives in the station's elaborate, domed ceiling where wreathed cherubs leap amid a wealth of scrolled ironwork. 

Services within Scotland
Edinburgh is linked to all 6 other cities in Scotland by train, and the majority of these services are run by Scotrail

There are several routes from to Edinburgh, varying in the time they take to reach the city. Tickets cost £13.60 for an off-peak return and £26.20 for an anytime return. Single tickets cost £13.40 and £15.30 respectively.
*The fastest route is the Scotrail Express services than run from Glasgow Queen Street (High Level) via Falkirk High every 15 minutes Monday-Saturday until 19:45 and 30 minutes outwith those times. The journey time is around 45 minutes.
*Fast: the next best option is taking a Crosscountry service via Motherwell. The trains run every 2 hours and take around 1 hour. The Crosscountry services offer the cheapest tickets between the two cities at £9.80 single and £12.90 return. London North Eastern Railway also run one service a day in each direction via this route.
*Slow: Scotrail run 4 trains an hour from Helensburgh or Milngavie via Glasgow Queen Street (Low Level). In the evenings and on Sundays a half hourly service runs on this route. Journey time is around 70-75 minutes. Scotrail also run a 'semi fast' service via Shotts from Glasgow Central. Journey time is around 70 minutes. A further Scotrail service runs every 30 minutes Monday-Saturday from Glasgow Queen Street (High Level) via Cumbernauld. Journey time is between 75 and 80 minutes.
*Very Slow: The slowest route between the two cities runs from Glasgow Central via Shotts. These services stop at every station on the route (18!!!) and the journey takes 1h30.

There are 2 trains an hour Monday-Saturday (1 on Sundays) from with 1 per hour originating from . Most of these are run by Scotrail but some are run by London North Eastern Railway and Crosscountry. The journey time from Dundee is around an hour with the journey from Aberdeen taking around 2h15-2h30.

Scotrail run one train per hour from and with one every 2 hours coming from . London North Eastern Railway also run one train a day from Inverness. The journey time from Perth is 1h20 and from Inverness it takes 3h20.

Scotrail also run regular services from , the Borders, Fife and .

Services from London
The vast majority of train services to Edinburgh from London (and most of eastern England) are operated by London North Eastern Railway (LNER) A half-hourly service leaves from London Kings Cross station throughout the day until 6:30PM. Journey time is around 4h30. The cheapest tickets (£16 to £90) are advance single (one-way) fares for a fixed train time bought up to 24 weeks in advance, and the flexible Saver Ticket (roughly £100 single or return) is not valid at some times to/from London. Avanti West Coast also operate a 2 hourly service from London Euston via Birmingham New Street and the West Coast Mainline with an average journey time of 5h40.

For a different travel experience from London, try the Caledonian Sleeper service which runs every night from London Euston Station except Saturdays, and the journey takes approximately 8 hours. Bear in mind that if you are travelling alone you may have to share the sleeping Tickets can be booked in the usual manner at any main line railway station in Britain, or online. Tickets vary in price depending on whether you travel in a solo, twin or double room. Some of the berths have an en-suite and shower and these will cost you a little extra. The cheapest way of travelling on the sleeper is in the seated carriage. BritRail passes can be used to reserve tickets on the sleeper trains. 
Tickets can be booked up to a year ahead, via the Caledonian Sleeper website.

Services from the rest of the UK
Crosscountry run one train an hour to Edinburgh up the East Coast Mainline via , and New Street. Most of these services originate from either , and . 

Transpennine Express operate a train every 2 hours from Manchester Airport via Piccadilly and the West Coast Mainline. They also operate a 2 hourly service from Lime Street via the East Coast Mainline. 

There is a second railway station in the centre of Edinburgh, Haymarket, around a mile to the west of Edinburgh Waverley. If you are arriving from the north, west or southwest, Haymarket is a better station to exit at if you are heading straight for the airport, zoo, or modern art gallery or if your accommodation is on the west side of town as you will avoid the city centre traffic, and it is on the major westbound bus routes. Almost every service that passes through Haymarket will stop there and tickets purchased to Edinburgh Waverley are valid to be used to Haymarket.

The "charged by the piece" left luggage service at Edinburgh Waverley railway station is much more expensive (£7 per item for 0-24 hours!) than the lockers a few blocks away at the Edinburgh bus station near St. Andrew Square.

By road
By road, Edinburgh can be reached most immediately by the M8 motorway (from Glasgow and the west), M9 (from and the north-west), A90/M90 (from , and northern Scotland), the A1 (from and north-east England) and A702/M74 (from and north-western England).

From the fastest route to Edinburgh is the M1 motorway, followed by the A1(M) and the A1 - a journey of 640 km (398 mi) and approximately 8-9 hrs driving time.

Edinburgh is not a particularly car friendly city (the worst city to drive in outside of London in the UK) with the myriad of one-way streets and the Old Town's medieval layout, and the dedication of parking wardens to ticketing anything that is not moving is legendary. 
Finding parking can be difficult, though there are several multi-storey car parks in the city centre (Castle Terrace for the West End, try St James Centre or Greenside at the East End) - on-street parking in the centre is limited to four hours, and both on-street and managed car parking is expensive, at around £15 for four hours in the city centre.
Overstaying a parking charge is likely to result in a stiff penalty (which the court is perfectly happy to pursue against car hire companies and, ultimately, to the hirer) and possibly impounding of the vehicle. If the latter happens to a hire car then the fines and fees will easily reach £200 to £300.
All said, it is often cheaper and quicker to use the new Park and Ride systems now in place on all approaches to the City, (National Park and Ride Directory is available online ), so it's even easy to just abandon your car on the outskirts. For visitors arriving from the M8, follow directions for Edinburgh Airport to reach Ingliston Park and Ride; this facility is half a mile from the airport terminal.
If you are on a tour that involves you driving into Edinburgh them it's worth finding out whether your hotel has 24 hour parking and, if it doesn't, then parking your car outside the main parking zone and using one of the frequent buses to travel to your hotel or to the city centre.

By bus
The city is served by the major inter-city bus companies from around Scotland and England. Most long distance services start and end from Edinburgh Bus Station near St Andrew Square. The left luggage lockers at the Bus station are much cheaper than the "charged by the piece" left luggage service at Edinburgh Waverley train station.

By boat
*A ferry/bus service from to Edinburgh can be booked through Citylink 
* Passenger cruise liners are a common sight in summer at Docks, where a new terminal has been built next to the Ocean Terminal shopping/leisure complex.

Get around
Edinburgh is a compact city - most of the sights and major tourist attractions are within the Old Town and New Town and are no further than a 15 minute walk apart. Walking along elegant or atmospheric streets is one of the pleasures of the city. There are however, a number of hills to be navigated; for example from Princes Street, up The Mound towards Edinburgh Castle requires some significant legwork, but it's worth it for the views en route.

The city's public transport system is relatively poor next to London and other major European cities - being heavily reliant on buses, which have to navigate the city's sometimes bustling traffic. Congestion charging similar to that found in the English capital has been proposed but was defeated at a referendum. Equally, the suburban railway network is very sparse compared to that of Glasgow, although there have been some slow and steady improvements over the years. 

By bus
Edinburgh has two main bus companies, Lothian Buses which is majority-owned by the The City of Edinburgh Council, and First a private operator. These two companies share the same bus stops, but the route numbers and tickets are not interchangeable and they operate different fare structures.

Lothian is the much larger operator in the city itself whose distinctive madder-red (burgundy) and white coloured buses had become as much a symbol of Edinburgh as its buildings. For some reason Lothian saw this as a negative and this livery was almost completely phased out in favour of Harlequin colours, which are predominantly white, with red and gold rhombuses of different sizes along the sides. Some of the more important routes also have different colours on the front and roof of the bus to help passengers spot their required bus. They repainted the fleet into the traditional "madder" livery in 2016, which is the livery used today. Lothian also operates the tram system, which uses essentially the same fare system as its buses. The madder-red colour is used for Lothian City buses (within Edinburgh and immediate suburbs), while Lothian Country buses serve surrounding communities from Edinburgh, such as Queensferry, where the Forth bridges are, along with some routes completely outside the city. Lothian Country buses use a green livery.

Children up to age 5 travel for free. Single tickets for Lothian Buses are £1.70 (80p for over 5s and under 16s) and are valid for only one journey. If you have to change bus, you have to buy another £1.70 ticket! Bear in mind that bus drivers will not give change, so save up those coins. Many buses, as of mid-2019, have also introduced contactless credit/debit card payments on board. 

More conveniently, Lothian offer an all-day ticket for £4.00 that covers all buses (except sightseeing, airport express and night services) and the trams (see below). The all-day ticket is a great way to see the city without the expense of the tour buses, as you can get on and off all Lothian buses for the whole day. Kids' day tickets are generously discounted to £2. You can buy these from any bus driver, or from Lothian Buses offices, located at the south end of Waverley Bridge, adjacent to Waverley train station. Should you be staying in Edinburgh for a longer period (a week or more), you may wish to purchase a Rideacard pass, which as of mid-2019 for adults costs £19 per week, and can be loaded for one, two, or four weeks at a time. If you purchase three weeks for £57, you get a fourth week free. This covers you for all Lothian City regular bus AND tram services (including to and from the airport) AND some Lothian Country bus routes, such as the 43 bus that runs between St. Andrew Square and Queensferry, northwest of Edinburgh on the Firth of Forth.

There is a BusTracker service. This provides "real time" bus service information. Electronic signs are along major routes, showing the wait time for the next bus on each service at that stop. Online, it's possible to view the information for every bus stop in the city, not just those stops with electronic signs. Every stop has a unique eight-figure code, which are listed on the website and also displayed at the stop. You can access Bus Tracker via a mobile phone at mobile.mybustracker.co.uk. A free app named "Transport for Edinburgh" is available for iPhone and Android. They provide similar information with route maps and a stop locator. In fact, often the bus information on the app is more accurate than the electronic signs, and if the electronic signs are (occasionally) not working, the app will almost always have live bus-tracking information instead.

First buses mostly service farther-flung areas to the east and west of the city.

Edinburgh Coach Lines operate service 13 a bus of use to many visitors as it is the only route serving the National Gallery of Modern Art and the Dean Gallery. Single tickets are in line with Lothian fares at £1.70 for adults and 80p for children (under 16). Lothian season tickets and day tickets are not valid on service 13.

There are also four companies that operate sightseeing buses all of which are now owned by Lothian Buses. All have a policy that a sightseeing ticket is valid for 24 hours, so you can get around central Edinburgh quite handily using the sightseeing buses. Each sightseeing bus follows a different route around the city, but they all start and finish at Waverley Bridge, adjacent to Edinburgh Waverley Railway Station near Princes Street. These run on different fares from Lothian City and Country buses, whose passes are not valid on them.

By train
A small number of suburban rail routes run from Edinburgh Waverley station, most of the stations lying in the south west and south east suburbs of the city, and are useful for reaching the outer suburbs of Balerno, Currie, Newcraighall, Wester Hailes and South Queensferry and the towns Wallyford, Prestonpans & Musselburgh in East Lothian and a useful link to Edinburgh Park which is adjacent to the Gyle shopping complex. Services to North Berwick, Bathgate, Fife or Glasgow Central will make stops at these various stations. Note that standard National Rail fares apply to these trains - there are no credible daily season ticket options available. Check at the station before you board!

The "charged by the piece" left luggage service at Edinburgh Waverley train station is far more expensive than the storage lockers a few blocks away at Edinburgh Bus station near St Andrew Square.

By car
Driving in Edinburgh City Centre is difficult, particularly the Old Town with its tangle of medieval streets with their associated one-way systems. The New Town fares slightly better, but the scourge "Blue Meanies" who mercilessly swoop on vehicles which may have only been illegally parked for a matter of minutes. Edinburgh operates a "controlled parking zone" - on-street parking is illegal within a large central area (see map without a residents parking permit. Parking fines are £40 and vehicles parked in an obstructive manner are liable to be towed away with a £150 release fee to be paid for its retrieval. Even the suburbs (especially Morningside, The Grange, The Meadows) have little parking available (and on-street parking is illegal within the controlled parking zone). It's better to take a bus and/or walk. Leith seems to fare a bit better for parking, but there's no guarantee. Park & Ride facilities provide access to the city centre Additionally, motorists should take heed of tram operations taking place at various locations throughout the city centre and the west of the city.

By foot
Edinburgh is a beautiful city that's full of history. Since it was planned and built in most parts to a human and walking scale, there is generally no better way to see it than on foot.

*Edinburgh walking directions can be planned online with the walkit.com walking route planner.

By tram

The long-awaited Edinburgh Trams entered service in May 2014, linking York Place in the centre of Edinburgh to Edinburgh Airport in the west, passing through the New Town to the city centre. After disputes with the main construction contractor and delays in construction, the line started running on the 31st of May 2014. As it links the airport, rugby stadium, both main train stations and Princes Street, it is helpful for some visitors to the city. 

The trams operate every 8-10 minutes throughout the day. Single tickets to and from any stop (except the airport) cost £1.60. A ticket to the airport from any other stop costs £5, or £8 for a return. Day tickets are available for £4.00, which allow unlimited travel on the trams (all stops excluding the airport) and Lothian Buses day services for one day. Similarly, any day tickets purchased on Lothian Buses services are valid on the trams, excluding the stop at the airport.

Tickets must be purchased from a machine prior to travel - no change is given, however the machines accept cards.

By taxi
Like most major British cities, Edinburgh offers a choice between Black Cabs, carrying up to 5 passengers, which can be hailed on the street, and minicabs, which must be pre-booked. Uber has operated withing the city for a few years now and effectively offer an alternative mechanism to booking minicabs.
Black cabs can be hailed on the street but minicabs must be pre-booked, either by calling their controlling office (which most tourists are unlikely to know) or by booking via Uber.
Black cabs display an orange light above the windscreen to indicate that they are available to hire. It's usually quite easy to find a cab in and around the city centre, and on the main radial routes running out of the centre. There are also Taxi Ranks dotted around the city, where black cabs will line up to be hired. Taxi Rank locations include:
* Outside the main entrances of Haymarket and Edinburgh Waverley train stations.
* Opposite the Caledonian Hotel and Sheraton Hotel (both near the West End), The George Hotel (east end of George Street) and the Crowne Plaza Hotel (High Street, Royal Mile).
* St Patrick Square, off South Bridge
* Leith Bridge, close to The Shore and Commercial Quay, in 

The main taxi firms operating within the city are:
* Central Radio Taxis (Black Cabs) - +44 131 229 2468
* City Cabs (Black Cabs) - +44 131 228 1211
* Edinburgh Taxi (minicabs) - +44 131 610 1234 (saloon cars, MPV's with 8 seats and chauffeur driven vehicles)
* Festival Cars (minicabs - mostly saloon cars but also have people carriers with up to 8 seats. Let them know the number in your party when you book) - +44 131 552 1777

If you are staying in Scotland a little while, it might be worth getting a Historic Scotland Membership Passes last for a year, and cost about £40 for adults and £30 for concessions (including full-time students). They provide unlimited access to about 70 paying sites in Scotland, including Edinburgh's Castle and Craigmillar Castle. You also get a lot of discounts for their shops, a quarterly magazine, and 50% off all English, Welsh and Manx historical sites.

* Edinburgh Doors Open Day is an annual event, co-ordinated by the Cockburn Association, where many important and/or historic buildings across the city open up their doors to the public at no charge. Many of the buildings are not normally accessible so this can present a unique opportunity to see some of the city's lesser-known architectural marvels. It usually takes place on the last weekend in September. Brochures with details of the participating sites, opening times, access details etc., can be picked up from city libraries in the run up to the day, or downloaded from the website.

*A new addition for the city centre running everyday in the fine, sunny weather of Scotland :) You are given a bike and helmet (to keep that face looking pretty) and you will see Edinburgh in the company of a local guide. .

Landmarks

* Edinburgh Castle, home to the Edinburgh Tattoo, is a magnificently situated royal fortress located on one of the highest points in the city. The castle has been continuously in use for 1000 years and is in excellent condition. 
* The ruins of Craigmillar Castle are a fantastic place to see. Located just after Holyrood Park, about 5Km east of the city centre, the first part of the castle was built in the 14th century.

* Edinburgh has an excellent theatre and concert life. Europe's largest theatre, the 3000-seat Edinburgh Playhouse (top of Leith Walk, ) hosts major West End shows. The Festival Theatre () frequently hosts opera and ballet, and the Usher Hall (Lothian Road) has weekly orchestral concerts all year round with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. The Queen's Hall (South Clerk Street, () is home to the Scottish Chamber Orchestra.

Festivals
Edinburgh in the summer becomes "festival city" when a huge number of major national and international arts festivals are hosted by the city. Most of these occur virtually simultaneously in August. These cater for a wide variety of interests and include:

*The Edinburgh International Festival The original that spawned all the rest. Founded in 1947 and still seen as more "high-brow" than any of its offspring.
*The Edinburgh Festival Fringe &mdash; As the name might suggest, this Festival developed on the "Fringe" of the main International Festival and allows anyone with a venue to host them into the programme. Historically offering alternative more performances, with an emphasis on comedy and avant-garde; it is now the largest arts festival in the world with more than 50,000 performances in its programme spanning theatre, dance, circus, cabaret, comedy and everything in between.
*The Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo One of the iconic images of Edinburgh for millions worldwide is the yearly Tattoo, kilted pipers skirling below the battlements of Edinburgh Castle. Although tickets sell out well in advance, persevering individuals are likely to find one or two tickets still for sale due to cancellations... just be prepared to ask, ask, and ask again!
*The Edinburgh Jazz & Blues Festival. 
*The Edinburgh International Book Festival Takes place in a temporary village of marquees at Charlotte Square (West End of George Street, ).
*The Edinburgh International Film Festival Now moved to June from its former slot in August, so that it no longer clashes with all the others! Centred around the Filmhouse Cinema on Lothian Road, though other cinemas take part too.
*The Edinburgh International Television Festival Predominantly a "closed shop" for industry professionals only.
*The Edinburgh Mela Multicultural festival held in .
*Edinburgh International Children's Festival Every May/June, an international festival of children's theatre.
*Edinburgh International Science Festival Takes place annually in March or April. Emphasis on "hands-on" science.
*Beltane Fire Festival on Calton Hill. 

One important thing to decide when planning a trip to Edinburgh is whether you wish to go at festival time, which runs from early August through to mid-September. Hotel rooms in and around the city are noticeably much more expensive then, and you will need to book well at least' six months in advance to get a good deal. Failing that staying on the city outskirts or in nearby towns is a more affordable option.

Hogmanay
Edinburgh in the winter festive season is also huge with various concerts and other activities taking place starting a couple of weeks before Christmas and running up to a week into January. Princes Street Gardens play host to a Big Wheel, outdoor ice rink and various festive markets. As in most of the rest of Scotland, Hogmanay, the New Year celebrations, are the main focus of the festive season rather than Christmas. On the night itself whole sections of central Edinburgh are roped off and accessible only by ticket for the Hogmanay street party which takes place across several stages and is easily the largest in Scotland. Hogmany and Edinburgh fit together like hand and glove.

Cinema

** Cineworld, 130 Dundee St, 0871 200 2000. Mainly mainstream and arthouse. This is about 20 mins on foot from Princes Street and a Number 1 34 or 35 bus will take you.

The teams play each other once per year, and alternate home and away games. In even-numbered years, England and France visit Murrayfield, while in odd-numbered years, Scotland host Wales, Ireland and Italy. On the weekend of a home match, Edinburgh is absolutely full to bursting, and the atmosphere is like nothing else, especially if Wales or Ireland are in town. If you plan to visit in February or March, be sure to check the fixtures and book accommodation well in advance if your trip coincides with a home match ().
* Take in a match at Heart of Midlothian FC's Tynecastle Park (), or Hibernian F.C.'s Easter Road Stadium ().

Buy
While travellers will find expected items (e.g. kilts or whisky, Scotland's national drink), Edinburgh also features a large number of independent retailers offering everything from joke supplies to fine art.

*Princes Street in offers shopping with a view. All shops here are relegated to one side of the street, giving shoppers an uninterrupted view of the . Visitors will find large department stores like Jenners (Scotland's oldest independent department store until it's acquisition in 2005), Debenhams and Marks and Spencer (commonly referred to as "M&S"). There is also an Apple Store and several health and beauty shops.

*Multrees Walk in , on the east side of Saint Andrew Square caters to the luxury shopper. This is the place to find Louis Vuitton, luxury fashion retailer Harvey Nichols, Swarovski, fine art galleries and plenty other shops selling high-end jewellery and watches.

*Shoppers with a taste for the eclectic, and those who prefer browsing smaller, independent stores should head to Grassmarket in the . Shops here feature a little bit of everything, from vintage clothing to sixteenth-century prints and maps.

*Harry Potter fans need to take a stroll down Victoria Street in . This street is said to have been the inspiration for "Diagon Alley." Souvenir hunters will find bookstores, a joke shop, jewellery and clothes shops. They may even spot a witch or wizard stocking up on supplies at The Cadies & Witchery Tours. Also, if you are interested in Harry Potter, it is worth a visit to the Elephant House on George IV Bridge. The Elephant House is the cafe where author J.K. Rowling wrote the Harry Potter books over coffee and cake, and is even signposted in the window to display the fact.

*The Royal Mile in boasts the highest number of "traditional" souvenir shops. Bookended by Edinburgh Castle and Holyrood House, The Royal Mile is home to a number of interesting museums and historical sites. Almost every site has it's own souvenir gift shop. This is also the place to come to find "made-in-Scotland" garments, "traditional" Scottish wear (i.e. kilts in every tartan pattern known and then some), Harris Tweed and whisky. Some shops, like The Scotch Whisky Experience that offers virtual whisky-making tours, also offer tasting sessions.

*The port town of is best known for its indoor shopping centre Ocean Terminal. Ocean Terminal houses big brand name stores including: Gap, Game, a Vue Cinema, Holland and Barrett and The Perfume Shop. The more unique shops, however, are found outside of Ocean Terminal. Independent stores here offer books, second-hand furniture, eco-friendly gifts, and antiques.

Eat
According to Scottish tourism officials, Edinburgh has more restaurants per person than any other town in the UK. Travelers will find everything from Michelin-rated fine-dining establishments to small pubs. And within that array, places offering traditional Scottish fare, seafood dishes, and ones specializing in Indian, Mediterranean or Chinese cuisine. If you crave it, there's a restaurant in Edinburgh that makes it. What follows are some examples of traditional Scottish fare.

Breakfast 

A full Scottish breakfast normally consists of eggs, black pudding, potato (tattie) scones, Lorne (or square) sausage, baked beans, toast, fried mushrooms and grilled tomatoes, not to mention sides of yogurt, cereal, and fresh fruit. And all washed down with tea or coffee. Of course, no Scottish breakfast would be complete without a steaming bowl of porridge.

*Porridge is made by combining oats, water and a dash of salt. The mix is then heated and stirred with a wooden spurtle (Scottish cooking tool dating from the 15th century) to prevent the porridge from congealing. Eat it alone or add nuts, sugar, whisky, cream, berries, syrup or milk.

Meat Dishes 

Scotland's lush lands and gentle slopes have helped produce some of the top beef breeds in the world. As a result, beef and lamb are commonly used in traditional fare. 

*Haggis is Scotland's national dish. Haggis makers take onions, oatmeal, suet (beef or mutton fat) and spices and mix them together with the offal (organ meat) of a sheep, pig or cow. Traditionally, this mixture was boiled in the stomach of the slaughtered animal. Today, most Haggis preparers use a synthetic casing.

*Black Pudding, unlike Haggis, is heavy on the carbs and light on the offal. It's a mix of suet, oats, barley, spices and blood stuffed into a protein casing and served like a sausage. Traditionally a breakfast food served predominantly at B&Bs, it is finding its way more and more onto the menus of five-star restaurants.

*Scotch Pie and Bridie are two types of meat pies commonly eaten by locals. Scotch Pie has a hard crust pastry shell and is filled with minced meat. Scotch Pie full ingredient lists are a closely guarded secret. Bridie is a meat pie with a shortcrust pastry. Its filling consists of minced beef, onions and seasoning. 

Dessert 

Scottish desserts showcase Scotland's produce growers, dairy farmers, and whisky makers.

*Cranachan is a light dessert made of raspberries, whipped cream, honey and toasted oats. A small amount of whisky is sometimes added.

*Tablet is the Scottish version of fudge. It's made from sugar, condensed milk, and butter.

*Shortbread is a cookie that is basically a lot of butter mixed with a little flour and sugar. Properly prepared, shortbread is rich, crumbly and a delicious staple of Scottish teas.

*Clootie dumpling is a classic Scottish dessert. It's a sweet pudding made with dried fruit, suet, sugar, flour, breadcrumbs, a little milk and sometimes some golden syrup. A popular way to eat it is to top it with cream and whisky.

Drink

There are establishments to suit all tastes scattered throughout every pocket of the city. Be careful, some of the more local pubs can be a little rough around the edges, especially in Leith. 

For a non-alcoholic beverage give Scotland's second national drink a try - Irn-Bru . It's a great cure for hangover.

As for Scotland's first drink, you will find The Scotch Whisky Experience at the top of The Royal Mile, which offers an interactive "tour" of the history and practise of Whisky distilling, complete with a rather sedate barrel ride. This is a good place to go if you want to sample whisky, as they have a very large selection (200+?) at a fairly reasonable price. Older whiskys tend to cost more and the rarest on offer can cost up to £50.00 per measure! The atmosphere is less pub-like than some might like as it tends to be fairly quiet - if you don't fancy the interactive tour and just want to try some whiskys then check the listings for some good whisky pubs but in any event, the majority of Edinburgh pubs tend to have a reasonable array of Scotch whiskys on offer. The food at the Centre is reasonably priced and fairly good.

* Lots of traditional pubs are all around the city.
* Many famous traditional pubs on the Grassmarket, . These pubs are tourist traps and tend to be very popular with visiting stag and hen parties, so locals tend to keep clear.
* Lots of modern clubs are around Cowgate and Lothian road. George Street in the hosts many of Edinburgh's trendier bars.
*An award-winning brewery and tasting tour, including the history of the city's alcohol. The guides are extremely knowledgeable and entertaining.

Sleep
See the articles for individual listings.

Edinburgh has been established as a tourist destination for centuries, and so there is a huge choice of accommodation available for travellers. Note however that the average cost of hotel accommodation in Edinburgh is higher than anywhere else in Scotland, and if you're planning a visit during festival time (Aug), around Christmas and New Year, or on the weekend of a Scotland home game in the 6-nations Rugby (Mar/Apr, 2 or 3 matches per year), then you will find that all types of accommodation get booked up well in advance, and hefty premiums may be applied to the room-rate. It's not impossible to get somewhere to stay at short notice at these times, but you won't be able to be fussy and it will probably be expensive. 

For those on a budget, there are cheap youth hostels available with prices from £10 and above. The private/independent hostels centre around the Cowgate area, the lower Royal Mile and its side streets. The hostels of the HI affiliated Scottish Youth Hostel Association can be booked on-line and are an especially good deal during summer, when the SYHA rents student accommodation as summer hostels: Single rooms in the city centre for a very modest price.

There are Guest Houses and small hotels dotted around almost every part of the city, however there are high concentrations in 2 areas, namely around Newington Road and Minto Street on the side, and on Pilrig Street and Newhaven Road in . Both areas are within a brisk 15-20 minute walk of the city centre and both have excellent round-the-clock bus services. If arriving in town without having booked accommodation, it may be worth heading for one or other of these areas and looking out for the "Vacancies" signs, though probably not during the festival or around Hogmanay.

Some of the Guest Houses and even hotels can be booked for as little as the hostels at certain times of year, while more upmarket accommodation ranges from boutique B&B's, with just a few rooms, lovingly run by a family, to world-renowned large 5-star hotels.

Another good alternative for accommodation is self-catering holiday apartments. Edinburgh has a wide offer of short term holiday apartments steps away from its main tourist attractions. It is a great opportunity to experience the city as a local. Apartments can be booked on-line. For summer months, especially August, it is highly recommended to book well in advance as most tourists tend to make their bookings in February for this period. 

Due to the excellent and frequent rail and bus links between the two cities, savvy travellers can cut the costs by basing themselves in , where deals in mainstream chain hotels are often easier to come by - and you get the advantage of being able to "do" both cities - bear in mind of course when your last train or bus leaves!

Contact

Internet
Multiple internet cafés and hotspot venues exist throughout Edinburgh (see articles for details).
*Many of the municipal libraries throughout the city have PCs with free internet access. Some of the most prominent are listed in the relevant articles.
*The city's largest independent internet cafe is Mossco Internet Cafe, located near Haymarket Station (18 West Maitland Street), 

Stay safe

By all accounts, Edinburgh is an extremely safe destination. In a poll conducted by international market research firm YouGov in 2014, Edinburgh was listed as the safest of the ten most populous cities in the UK. The tap water is safe to drink, like it is anywhere in Scotland. Visitors can eat the food without constant fear of becoming home to a nefarious parasite. And although home burglaries are on the rise, violent crime and robberies happen infrequently. 

During the day, visitors can travel safely almost anywhere on the streets of downtown Edinburgh. Although as with any city, there are a few places to steer clear of. Travellers are advised to stay away from the housing districts of Niddrieand Craigmillar in the south east, the residential housing estates Muirhouse, Pilton in the north and the suburb of ’Wester Hailes in the south west and (to a lesser extent) Leith, also in the north. These are areas known for drug use, anti-social behaviour, violence and higher crime rates.

The biggest threat to travellers are pickpockets and muggers. These petty thieves tend to congregate around tourist attractions, on public transport and in crowded areas such as busy shopping centres. Tourists can keep their valuables safe by keeping them out of sight or at least out of easy reach.

Travellers should take a little more caution at night. It is always wise to explore with a friend after dark, and to keep food and drink in sight at all times when visiting bars or pubs. Cowgate in , Grassmarket and Lothian Road and the top of Leith Walk in are best approached with care and/or with friends. At night, these places tend to become saturated with drunken crowds. Women, in particular, should also stay clear of the Meadows in and Leith Links after dark.

A good resource to know about is The SafeZone Bus. Operated by volunteers, SafeZone buses are in service on Fridays and Saturdays from 22:00-04:00. They offer free transport home for anyone who is drunk, unwell or simply disoriented. They can also offer first aid services if required. Buses can be found at Cathedral Lane, opposite the Omni Centre, in .

The city's 2 main soccer(football) teams are the Hearts of Midlothian (Heart) and the Hibernians (Hibs). However, unlike the rival teams in Glasgow and many other European cities in general, the rivalry between the Edinburgh teams are not as fierce and are based mostly on just a geographical stance instead of sectarianism; all due to both clubs' territories being diverse economically, politically, and denominationaly. However, it may still be best to avoid wearing Heart clothing in Hib territory (Leith neighborhood, where the Hibernian home ground is; and the neighborhoods surrounding or close to Leith), and wearing Hib clothing in Heart territory (Gorgie neighborhood, where the Heart home ground is; and the neighborhoods around or near Gorgie).

Stay healthy
In emergency, dial 999 (preferably from a landline, a free call from any phone including payphones), 112 also works. For advice on non-emergency medical problems, you can ring the 24-hour NHS 24 service on 111.
* The R.I.E. hosts the main Accident and Emergency (A&E) facility for the city.
The Western General near Crewe Toll runs a no-appointment Minor Injuries Clinic between 8am and 9pm every day. 

Pharmacy
During normal shopping hours (M-F 9AM-5:30PM, Sa 9AM-12:30PM), you won't have any problem locating a pharmacy as they are dotted all around the city. Any row of local shops will usually include one. Common brands include Boots (city centre branches in the at 11 Princes St, 101-103 Princes St, 16 Multrees Walk and 48 Shandwick Pl; in the at 40-44 North Bridge), Alliance and Numark.

Outside of these hours you will face more of a challenge. There are no 24 h pharmacies in the city. In the city centre the best option is probably the Boots branch at 48 Shandwick Pl (western extension of Princes Street), M-F 7:30AM-8PM, Sa 8AM-6PM, Su 10:30AM-4:30PM.

Some of the major supermakets include a pharmacy counter, but note that the pharmacy does not necessarily follow the same opening hours as the supermarket itself. The pharmacy counter within the Tesco supermarket at 7 Broughton Road in is quite close to the city centre and opens M-Sa 8AM-8PM and Su 10AM-5PM.

For non-prescription medication, ASDA are open 24/7 and have a handful of branches dotted around the outskirts.
