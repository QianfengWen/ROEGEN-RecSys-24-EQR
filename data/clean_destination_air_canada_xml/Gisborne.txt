Drink
Gisborne's drinking scene is fairly quiet and often starts late, around 11PM or midnight. Expect to pay cover charges most bars/clubs in the CBD after 10PM on weekends; usually $5-$10. Busy nights are Wednesdays (payday for many people in town), Friday, and Saturday. The exception is during Rhythm and Vines, when the bars and beachside are going for pretty much the whole week.
The entire downtown and much of the town's beach are liquor-free zones; drinking outside in these areas can result in a fine.

*Local wine tasting and really yummy nibbles! Sunny porch and luxurious indoor tasting room. Bottle shop prices are ~$5 higher than elsewhere in town; find what you like and then buy from the cellar door for a bargain.

Sleep
*Cheap and dirty backpackers, with the emphasis on both! Lots of long-term residents and indoor and outdoor social areas.
