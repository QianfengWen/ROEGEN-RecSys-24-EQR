Yonago () is a city in .

Get in
From KIX Osaka International airport. Take the bus No 11 till Naba station (50 min-75min depending on traffic conditions). After that a bus leaves you to Yonago station (3 h and 15 min). I think this is the most convinient and economic way (5800 Y) since with trains you have to change three trains (going from Okayama).
From Narita Tokyo international airport the most convinient way is to take the bus until Haneda airport and take the flight to Yonago (1 hour).
