Mogadishu (: Muqdisho; : مقديشو‎ Maqadīshū) is the official capital of and a major commercial city on the coast of East Africa. Mogadishu was a major battleground in the Somali civil war, which ravaged the city during different periods from 1991 until 2011. Since then, the city has come under the full control of the Federal government. Consequently, Mogadishu has in recent years experienced a period of rapid reconstruction, including a brand new international airport, repaved roads, new hotels, and embassies which have been financed by the Diaspora Somalis and the international community.
Despite improvements, visiting Mogadishu is still discouraged due to the risk of terrorism. If you must travel there, you will find this guide extremely helpful.

Understand
Mogadishu, historically known as "The White Pearl of the Indian Ocean", has been profoundly marked by the ravages of civil war. In the early 1990s, much of the city was devastated, but has seen substantial reconstruction efforts since the mid 2010s. Despite these improvements, the deep-seated scars from those years remain etched into the city.

During the July 1989 riots, Mogadishu saw its first ever eruption of serious violence. The next year saw the city transform into a war-zone amidst struggles to topple the regime of President Barre. Following his ousting in 1991, an array of factions, from secular warlords to Islamist groups, vied for control over the city. In 2006, the Islamic Courts Union (ICU) achieved a significant milestone, becoming the first Somali faction to consolidate control over the entire city since the fall of Barre. However, the same year saw Ethiopian forces enter the city with the aim of displacing the ICU and instating the Western-backed Transitional Federal Government. This intervention ignited a bloody insurgency and culminated in an Ethiopian withdrawal in 2009. During this tumultuous period, the extremist Islamist group al-Shabaab, the former youth wing of the ICU's militias, began to gather strength. Gradually, al-Shabaab seized control over much of Mogadishu, reducing the government's influence to a scant few square blocks. In August 2011, a joint counter-offensive, supported by African Union, successfully expelled the militants from the city. 

Today, while bombings and shootings are still reported, the city has seen an end to open warfare. Nevertheless, the influx of thousands of refugees has put a significant strain on the handful of government offices that are operational. In other regions of the country, Somaliland (a self-declared republic seeking independence) and Puntland (an administrative region in the north) have remained far more stable. Nonetheless, violent attacks on foreign targets have occurred in these regions in the past.

By road
Although it is possible to drive into the city by truck, this is considered risky without employing a group of local militia, which are readily available for hire. Roads link the city with many Somali locales, as well as with and . Armed guards, hired security forces, and experienced guides are all necessary for a safe entry. The risk of being injured, killed, or captured is extremely high.

By boat
Small cargo ships regularly leave from the Old Harbor of Mombasa for Mogadishu. Speak with the security officers at the gate of this port and they will negotiate a fare with the captain. The journey will take from two to five days, depending on conditions. The sea is rough in July and August, requiring lengthier travel. Arriving by boat is risky, as there is the strong possibility of being attacked by pirates, though the port area is relatively secure.

Get around
Roads are muddy during rain, traffic lights do not operate, and there are no enforced traffic laws or public transport, although the road network in Mogadishu is slowly being repaired and paved. A vehicle with a driver and armed guards is a must. Car-jackings at intersections are frequent, so avoid openly displaying anything that could be considered valuable. The terrorist group al-Shabaab operates in this region, therefore it is not advised to visit as a tourist.

Buy
The Bakaara Market (Suuqa Bakaaraha) is an open market and the largest of its kind in Somalia. Created in late 1972 during the reign of Siad Barre, its original purpose was to allow proprietors to sell daily essentials, but the civil war subsequently created demand for arms and ammunition. Everything from pistols to anti-aircraft weapons are being sold here. Falsified documents are also readily available, such as forged Somali, Ethiopian and Kenyan passports. This illicit submarket is known as Cabdalle Shideeye, named for one of its first proprietors.

Most markets are a focus of on-going arms control efforts for the disarmament of Somalia. Marketplaces should be considered hazardous not only because of their content and the presence of unsavory characters, but also due to the fact that they have caught fire several times in the last few years.

Eat
International cuisine can be found at Nasa Hablod Restaurant inside Hotel Nasa Hablod and at the Sahafi Hotel. These are probably the safest options for travelers. Nasa Hablod is in the breakaway region of Somaliland, which is said to be a safe haven in contrast to the rest of Somalia.

* One of the best hotels in Mogadishu. The manager is very helpful, the staff is attentive, and the food is good. Although the compound is probably your safest bet in Mogadishu, a BBC producer was shot in the back and killed in front of the hotel in 2005, and two French citizens were abducted by gunmen in 2009.
* Security, escort, restaurant, cafeteria, airport drop-off and pickup. Cable TV, Internet, laundry, business center.

Respect
Most people in Mogadishu are generally friendly, but watch out for kids with sticks who will try to get your shilling.

Stay Safe
As of May 2017, the city remains extremely dangerous and near suicidal for independent travelers. Armed warlords and Islamic militant factions still have a large presence in the city, and foreigners are a prime target. Do not wander the streets alone for any reason. Gunfire and random explosions are frequent. If you must venture around the city, you should be accompanied by armed and well trained security personnel and ride in an armored vehicle. These arrangements should be made in advance through private security and tactical firms which specialize in these types of environments. Most employers and governmental bodies that might send you here are well aware of the situation on the ground and will do their best to keep you safe, but your head must be on a swivel to your surroundings 24/7. Make 100% certain that any hotel accommodations that are made come with 24 hour private security, which is standard at most hotels in the city catering to foreigners. Even so, hotel bombings and suicide attacks are frequent.
 
Basic services such as electricity are not reliable many hours of the day, and you should not drink the water under any circumstances. Food and bottled drinks sold in the city may or may not be safe to consume either. Try to get the advice of another foreigner who has been in the city before, or follow the advice of your employer. Health and consular services are either limited or nonexistent.

In short, if you do not have an absolutely essential reason to go to Mogadishu, DO NOT DO IT! Independent travel will only get you killed, no matter how benevolent you think your intentions might be. Even if you do have a good reason, your employer or government can't make you risk your life, as even humanitarian aid workers are not safe in the city. Please do not become another statistic. You provide the country no benefit whatsoever by causing an international incident over your death or abduction.
