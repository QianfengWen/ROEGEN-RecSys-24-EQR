Orlando is a large city in , . 

Orlando, for most people, conjures up the image of theme parks, mainly , but there is a lot more, in fact, Disney World is not in Orlando, but is in nearby . With the estimated 52 million tourists a year, Orlando and many other areas in the region developed a lot to offer a traveler who wants to see something other than a theme park.

Other cities in the metropolitan area include , , , and .

Understand
When people think of Orlando, most think of theme parks and a vast urban sprawl. However, the city proper contains only Universal Studios. None of the other major theme parks (Disney World, Sea World), dinner attractions (such as Medieval Times), and most small theme parks (Gatorland, Holyland Experience, Ripley's Believe-it-or-not, etc) are in other cities or counties. However, since Orlando is the larger city associated with most of these popular attractions, you will find details and descriptions of them below.
 
Climate
Most tourists visit Orlando between June and August, while another peak time for tourism is March and April. Ironically, the less busy times for tourism correspond to the best weather in the Orlando area; the summer months can be exceptionally busy with families who are making a trip while kids are on summer vacation. Visiting when the weather isn't so hot means less people in the area and that provides some advantages, but you will be able to enjoy cooler weather. The climate of Orlando is subtropical, and therefore is very humid (the heat index typically exceeds 100 degrees). Afternoon thunderstorms are expected in the warmer months, although they can occur in any month. 

Many say central Florida has two seasons: hot and hotter. Orlando has warm, balmy springs and autumns; hot summers complete with daily thunderstorms; and temperate winters affected by the occasional cold front. That being said:

*Spring in Orlando has highs in the 80s (27°C) in March & April transitioning to around 90°F (32°C) in May and low-mid 90s in June. Spring is the driest time of year here, and in the past decade some spring months have seen less than a half-inch of rain! This is the time of year in which many small wildfires appear around the region, but this should not bother anyone who stays within the urban area. March and April are great times to visit with dry days, clear skies, and warm temperatures (and no cold fronts). However, late May and early June are arguably the worst time to visit filled with hot, humid, dry days.

*Summer begins with the start of daily thunderstorms around mid-June. Highs from mid-June to mid-September are in the mid 90s, with 90ºF (32°C) often being reached by 10-11AM, and lows in the 70s (23°C). Due to Orlando's proximity to two coasts, thunderstorms form everyday during this period from ocean breezes which heat over land, rise, and cool in the atmosphere to create sometimes violent thunderstorms (see the "Stay Safe" section). However, they often will drop temperatures into the low 80s (28°C) after passing...a welcome relief from the hot temperatures earlier in the year.

*Autumn varies much more from year to year than spring. The daily thunderstorms taper off in September leaving highs in the mid-high 80s (29°C) until mid-October. The first cold front of the season will usually pass between mid and late October, plunging highs into the 70s (24°C) and lows into the 50s (12°C) and high 40s (10°C). The cooling trend continues into November and December, with highs falling into the 70s (24°C) by late December and lows into the 50s (12°C), affected only by the occasional cold front which can plunge highs into the 60s (18°C)(Nov) and 50s (12°C)(Dec) and lows into the 40s (7°C)(Nov) and as low as freezing (32ºF/0ºC) by mid December.

*Winter is much the same as November and December. Highs are in the 70s (24°C), lows in the 50s (12°C), affected every week or two by cold fronts. Following a cold front, highs can drop into the 50s (12°C), lows into the 30s (2°C).

Security screening is performed in the central landside terminal before taking the tram to the airsides and, as in all U.S. airports, only ticketed passengers are allowed past security. Security lines can become extremely long (1 hr), especially during the summer tourist season and near holidays. Combined with long check-in lines, it is advisable to arrive 2-3 hours before your scheduled departure.

By Car

Driving to Orlando should be considered as a real and viable possibility for anyone with the geographic means. All Orlando attractions, including most major resorts and hotels are off Interstate 4 which connects to Interstate 95, running from Maine to Florida. Five minutes off of a choice of exits, depending on your destination, takes you anywhere you need to go. This can prove to be the most economical for your trip, as well as the most convenient.

Get around

By car

The car is omnipresent in Orlando and is a very easy and convenient (if congested) way to get to your destination. Orlando is a sprawling city with most attractions lying far to the south of downtown and into adjacent cities like Kissimmee and Lake Buena Vista (this section includes those areas). The roads are all wide and easy to drive on with all major attractions well signed, but traffic jams around downtown are common in the afternoons, and around the touristy areas on Friday nights and all day Saturday. Orlando ranks 8th in the nation in terms of traffic congestion, and there are numerous ongoing construction projects on area expressways (all aimed at alleviating this, but only causing congestion in the meanwhile). Traffic information is available from new Dynamic Message Signs, most local radio stations, and also by calling 511 (a free, automated service which provides current traffic info collected from hundreds of traffic cameras as well as police reports.)

The main highway through Orlando, and the only interstate serving it, is Interstate 4 (runs NE-SW). In recent years, major construction on it has widened it through areas south of SR528 making it a commuter-friendly highway (except for traffic during rush hours and Friday and Saturday evenings). Downtown Orlando; International Dr; Amway Arena; the Mall at Millenia; and theme parks such as Walt Disney World, Universal Studios, Sea World, Discovery Cove, the Holy Land Experience, and Wet n' Wild are all along or near I-4.

Aggressive drivers are abundant in the Greater Orlando area not only on major highways but also on surface streets in the downtown district. Speed limits are for the most part ignored in and around the city, even though on I-4 the speed limit is only 50 mph (80 km/h) in the downtown area and ranges between 55 and 65 mph (90-105 km/h) near the attractions, it is not uncommon to be tailgated if you travel less than 80 mph (129 km/h) in the left lane. If you are unfamiliar with the area, it is much easier and safer to drive in the far right lane, as road signs will direct. 

Other major highways include toll road SR-528, the Beach Line Expressway although known until recently as the Bee Line, which runs east from I-4 (exit 72) towards the Space Coast beaches and Kennedy Space Center, , and Port Canaveral. SR-528 is, like all Orlando area expressways (not including I-4), a toll road. While tolls are modest for short trips within Orlando, tolls can quickly add on long cross-town trips (bypassing Orlando on SR-417 is $7.27 for 55 mi/89 km. If you're driving from the Disney area to Sanford, FL between 4PM and 6PM, paying the toll is good if you're in a hurry, because it could take you up to 2 hours going on I-4). SR-417 starts at I-4 just west of SR-192/Disney World. It takes you north, passing both the Orlando International Airport and the Orlando-Sanford International Airport. It ends at I-4 in Sanford, FL. SR-408 starts at SR-50 on the East side of Orlando, by the University of Central Florida and takes you past the west side of Orlando to the city of Ocoee, FL. It ends at the Florida Turnpike. SR-429 starts in Apopka, FL at SR-441 and takes you past the Florida Turnpike and Disney World. It ends at I-4, just west of SR-192/Disney World. The Florida Turnpike starts in Miami, FL at I-95 and takes you north through Orlando and ends in Wildwood, FL at I-75. See this convenient toll calculator online: 

In Orlando, the main tourism area is International Drive, a strip of road that runs parallel to I-4 for about 10 miles (16 km). Many tourist-focused shops, restaurants, and attractions are to be found along this road; therefore, it is excruciatingly hard to drive on and find parking along this road on weekends, especially in the summer, and excursions to this area are best by bus during such times. Other major roads include: US 192 in Kissimmee (fronted by thousands of small shops and attractions), Orange Blossom Trail (US 92/441...a North-South alternative to I-4), SR-50 (E-W route towards the CBD).

Gasoline

There are a few gas stations that prey on unsuspecting travelers returning rental cars to the airport. This includes Suncoast Energys and Sun Gas on Semoran Blvd. near the airport entrance. Prices at these stations are often more than $2 per gallon above typical market price. Look before you pump! The prices are not posted except on the pump. Plan ahead to have enough time before your flight to drive an extra mile or so up Semoran to the cheaper stations. There also are stations around Disney World that have similar practices.

By rental car

Orlando is the largest rental car market in the world and is known as capital of car rental companies, with all major car rental companies accessible. Operating directly within the airport are Alamo, Avis, Budget, Dollar, Enterprise, E-Z Rent-A-Car, L & M Car Rental, National, and Thrifty; courtesy shuttles are available for transport to other rental companies.

There are also several car rental companies off the Airport in Orlando which you can normally get a better car rental price. Most of these companies are local companies and Sixt. 
If you arrive by air via Orlando International Airport and pick up a rental car there, you can go through the north exit and head to SR-528 West to get to International Dr, Universal Orlando and SeaWorld. This will require $1.75 in tolls. Alternatively, you can take a direct route to Walt Disney World through the south exit to SR-417 South, following it to Exit 5, and taking SR 536 straight into Disney. This requires $2 in tolls. Toll booths along this expressway uses open road tolling: see note above in box.

If you're feeling like you would like to rent a more higher end vehicle there is a variety of exotic car rentals around that can either deliver you a vehicle from their exotic car rental company, most of them are in Miami but they sometimes have deals in which the cars were rented out near by and you can pick those cars up without a delivery fee, or sometimes a bit cheaper then having a car delivered from Miami to meet you at the airport.

By bus

Orlando's public transportation is the LYNX bus service. Approximately 60 routes serve the metro Orlando area and costs $2 per ride (transfers included) except for the free Lymmo bus service downtown. 

*Lymmo Bus, 1-407-841-LYNX. This free service operates frequently in a circuit in downtown, from City Hall to the Centroplex and back. The Lymmo has a dedicated lane and stations with streetcar type control signals and modified buses that allow passengers to enter the bus without climbing. M-Th 6AM-10PM, F 6AM-midnight, Sa 10AM-midnight, Su 10AM-10PM.

LYNX buses of interest to visitors include routes 8, 21, 37, 38, 40, 42, 50, and 111 -- e.g., bus 8, 38, or 42 for International Dr, bus 21, 37, or 40 for Universal, bus 8, or 38 for SeaWorld, bus 50 for Disney, and bus 37, 42, or 111 for Florida Mall and/or Orlando International Airport. Seven-day standard passes are $16. Check out GO LYNX plan your trips.

By trolley

*I-Ride Trolley, +1 407-248-9590, Along International Dr and Universal Blvd, this trolley primarily serves tourists in the attractions area, operating daily from 8am to 10:30pm. While the service is advertised as a trolley, the trolleys are in fact modified buses traveling in traffic with many stops, which makes for a slow ride. There are 85 stops along the main (Red) route on International Dr and 22 stops on the (Green) route that serves less congested Universal Blvd. The fare is $1.25 per ride for adults, 25¢ for seniors, and free to kids younger than 12; exact change is required. There's an unlimited 1-day pass available for $4 per person. One-day and multi-day passes, not sold on the bus, are available in many locations. However, because of the very limited route coverage of I-Ride –- it goes nowhere near Disney -- the better choice for many visitors is to use LYNX buses (e.g., bus 8, 21, 37, 38, 40, 42, 50, or 111).

By taxi

Orlando is visited by millions of tourists each year and there are dozens of taxi companies that are operational in the region. It will not be a problem to find transportation from The Orlando Airport to your hotel or from the hotel to a theme park, restaurant or mall. If you are not planning to rent a car, you probably should do some research and arrange your own transportation before arriving to Orlando.

It is advisable to never hail a taxi off the street. Unfortunately some of those companies do not have any license or insurance and operating illegally. These taxi services, although questionable in practice, can be quite convenient. They are generally available at all times of the night to safely transport 'party-goers’, or those who take advantage of the lively night scene.

By Shuttle
There are various shuttles available in and around Orlando. Florida Shuttle Services, Orlando Airport Van, Mears Transportation, and Supershuttle, among others, provide service 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Rates vary by location and start as low as $49.99. Many travelers find shuttles faster and cheaper alternative to their more luxurious counterparts (i.e., taxis, private cars/sedans, etc.). A full list of companies permitted by the City of Orlando and the Aviation Authority you can find on Orlando International Airport website.

Keep in mind, you get what you pay for and may of those shared companies have one star and a poor reputation for good reasons. Look at more reliable companies when you shop around:
Florida Shuttle Luxury Services provides group shuttle service from Orlando MCO airport to many different locations with an Orlando-Miami bus. Rates vary depending on the passenger's destination. 

Based on our current knowledge, we hope you make the best decision to fit you.

By Train

SunRail offers service every 30 minutes during rush hours, and 1-2 hours in the midday and evenings between DeBary and Poinciana, serving Kissimmee, Winter Park, and of course, Downtown Orlando. Saturday service is available during certain major events. The bus system is generally more efficient for reaching most places throughout Orlando.

The Go Orlando Card is very useful, and can save significant amounts of money. However, there is so much to do in Orlando that planning a trip itself can become stressful. To alleviate much of this stress, there are ticket packages available for multiple parks, and can not only help plan a trip but save significantly on admission costs. The Orlando FlexTicket offers a few different package options that could be critical to your stay.

Although the FlexTicket does not cover any Disney Theme Parks, purchasing these in advance is also not only cost-effective, but can ensure you get everything out of your trip that you are looking for. Using Disney's Website directly allows you to personalize your own vacation. Using the Park Hopper option allows maximum exposure to all Disney Parks.

Downtown Orlando is a growing area centered around Orange Avenue that is packed with bars, clubs, and restaurants, as well as theaters and concert venues. The main strip on Orange Avenue is closed most nights because of the large volumes of pedestrians. Just a few blocks over is Lake Eola, a picturesque park situated around a swan-filled lake. In the middle of the lake is a lighted fountain that has been established as an icon of Orlando, and on one side of the lake stands the historic outdoor shell theater, where tourists and locals alike can see a version of the Nutcracker every December. Swan-shaped paddle boats are available for rental as well. Taking over for Church Street as the main night time hot spot is Wall Street. It is a small pedestrian only alley off of Orange Avenue that houses several restaurants and bars.

Drink
 

Orlando nightlife away from the theme parks is centered mostly around Central Boulevard and Orange Avenue in downtown Orlando. Here you can walk and find many bars. A short walk away is the tiny Thornton Park District, near the intersection of Washington and Summerlin. Among the dozens of cafes and pubs, you might stop in for a drink and a quick bite at Dexter's on Washington. For local flair head across the street to Burton's Frosty Mug, or sample the hip urban environment at the trendy HUE at the corner of Washington and Central.

Although most of the downtown Central avenue crowd is comprised of the "twentysomething" generation, for a more 30's and over entertainment experience, one can enjoy live jazz on many nights in the lounge of the Grand Bohemian Hotel, downtown on Orange Avenue. The jazz is excellent and the ambiance is quite comfortable, although drinks tend to be pretty pricey here. 

Milk District is a colorful zone about two miles east of Downtown. This area is very bohemian with tons of nightlife, and a teahouse that is 24 hours thursday-sunday.

Winter Park has a more sophisticated nightlife scene centered around Park Avenue, with some students mixed in from prestigious Rollins College down the street. There's also a "food truck stop" that's open 24/7, and Austin's Coffee which is a 24/7 coffeehouse a bit west of the central area.

Also, for a more professional crowd with a Latin twist, there is the Samba Room, on Sand Lake Road, about 3/4 west of I-4. This is a lively restaurant and happy hour type of place. The look is chic and the locals and tourists alike gather here for a quality food, beverage and people watching experience. You should ditch the shorts and flip-flops for a more casual chic look, but if you do you will be rewarded with a nice experience here. If you are traveling west on Sand Lake Road, after passing I-4, The Samba Room is on the left in a large shopping plaza. Latin food, music and mojitos are just some of the specialties here.

Across the street from the Samba Room, on Sand Lake Road, is the Old Vines wine bar, featuring live jazz usually from Thurs. through Saturday nights. The wine selection is extensive and the live jazz is some of the best in town. The jazz is performed in the front of the room by the entrance. There is a divider that separates the more intimate rear portion of the establishment, which is the main dining area. 

There are quite a few places to enjoy quality dining and drinks along Park Avenue in Winter Park, an adjacent suburb which is just northeast of Orlando. Winter Park is known for its many older grande homes that dominate the more historic sections of this suburb affectionately referred to by many as the center of Orlando's "old money." Park Avenue is an active pedestrian street featuring trendy shoppes, galleries, restaurants and nightspots. It has recently grown from becoming a one street attraction to more of a district, as several nearby streets have now added similar attractions. 

Of particular interest and uniqueness on Park Avenue is the Wine Room, a converted bank featuring literally hundreds of wines available for self serve sampling. The mode of purchasing here is to pre-load a wine "credit card" supplied by the Wine Room. You are then at liberty to peruse the entire building and select any wine you wish to try, merely by inserting your "credit card." Each wine station automatically deducts the value of your current purchase and advises you of your card balance. Dress is very casual here and you are likely to meet both locals and visitors, all sampling and enjoying their vinos of choice throughout the night.

At the theme parks, CityWalk at Universal Studios. For a nominal admission fee, both sites offer numerous venues for libations and entertainment. If you're staying along International Dr, there are plenty of bars, pubs, and clubs.

Sleep 

With a hotel around virtually every corner (actually 4 or 5 around every corner) it seems impossible to throw a rock and not hit a hotel. There are hotels to meet every traveler's need, whether it be a hostel or a 5-star resort, although many visiting families often prefer to rent their own private villa as they usually provide much more personal space and have their own private facilities. There are also a large number of lodgings in the surrounding cities and towns.

Stay safe

There are certain areas of Orlando which are more dangerous than others. Some areas travelers should be cautious of are:
*Parramore District, area in downtown Orlando is a location where a lot of the area's homeless population congregates and crime rates are higher in this area. 
*Orange Blossom Trail, south of Sand Lake Road is known to be a a bit of an unofficial red light district. Drug and prostitution related crime is common here. Prostitution is not legal in Orlando, so you could spend a night in jail if you decide to indulge.
*Pine Hills, around Silver Star Road and Pine Hills Road west of John Young Parkway. This is a lower income area that has struggled with high crime rates. The Greyhound bus station is in Pine Hills and is a place to use caution.

While it is unlikely that individual would experience serious crime in these areas, tourists stand out in these areas, and can unwittingly do things that can make them targets for criminal behavior, so it is sensible to stay away.

While crime in the Orlando area is not particularly high, with the annual tourists far outnumbering the regional population (~2million), a substantial amount of local crime ends up being directed at tourists. The most common crimes are theft of items from cars and hotels, so following common sense travel precautions are particularly important in an area like Orlando.
 
* Never leave valuable items in your car unattended, get any purchased items to your hotel room as soon as possible.
* Never leave small children unattended for any length of time, especially at a pool. Most hotel pools do not have lifeguards.
* Hotel room invasions do occur, especially open-air hotel and motel rooms when the victim leaves their hotel room unlocked and not dead-bolted. When you are in a hotel room, always lock your doors behind you, even if you expect someone in a minute or two.

Pets are better off left with a friend or in a kennel. If you choose to bring your pet, note that most theme parks and hotels prohibit pets but may provide kennels for a fee. Also note above about interior temperatures in parked cars.

For truly the safest experience, consider staying on Disney-owned property. If this is not possible, the area of Lake Buena Vista would be a preferred location. In addition to its accessibility to attractions, it offers a much safer, less urbanized area for comfort.

Contact

*Ten digit dialing is in effect in the Orlando area. All calls from or within the area, even local calls, require dialing the area code. There are some public pay phones scattered around the city, but they are becoming increasingly rare with the predominance of cell phones. It is not safe to assume you will be able to find a pay phone at any given time.

*Orlando/Orange County Convention & Visitors Bureau, 8723 International Dr, toll free +1 800-972-3304, The official sales and marketing organization for the Orlando and Orange County area.

* Telephone Area Codes in and around the city of Orlando begin with 407 or 321.

* It is common for many of the larger hotels and lodgings in the area to offer free internet access for their guests.
