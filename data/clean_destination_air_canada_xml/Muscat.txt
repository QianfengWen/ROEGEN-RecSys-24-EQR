Muscat is the capital of and the country's largest city.

Understand

The city referred to as "Muscat" is in fact three smaller towns which have grown together over time. They are:
* Muscat - often referred to as the "walled city", Muscat proper is the site of the royal palaces.
* Matrah (Matruh) - originally a fishing village, and home to the maze-like Matrah Souq.
* Ruwi - generally considered the commercial and diplomatic centre of the city.

This tripartite division will sometimes cause the visitor an inconvenience, as distances between sites can be very long.

As an alternative to the main CBD area that is considered as these three areas, there is plenty of places to go and things to see along the main highway that heads North East out of these areas. This main road, The Sultan Qaboos Highway, goes past many areas on its way out to the Airport and further still to Seeb, Sohar and eventually the northern most tip of Oman.

Heading along this road you pass the districts of Qurum, Madinat Al Sultan Qaboos, Al Khuwair, Bausher, Al-Hail and Seeb. Each one has a range of sights to see and places to stay.

There is also a very long beach road from Qurum to Seeb, some 50km. Situated along this are some of the large international hotel chains but more importantly you discover the true beauty of the Oman coast-line. Kilometre's of beaches, fisherman with drag nets and open space to walk for hours.

Weather
The climate is tropical, with very hot and generally humid weather year-round.

Get in
 Visas 

Historically, certain nationalities holding a Qatar or UAE tourist visas did not need to purchase an Omani visa if entering directly from Doha or Dubai. While this may no longer fully work, the Common Visa Facility (CVF) between Dubai and Oman still works when tried in Jan 2019. If you land in Dubai airport and go to Oman via Hatta border within one week from your arrival, and your country is eligible for visa on arrival arrangments, you may be able to use CVF and obtain a 3 weeks visa on arrival free of charge, by showing your Dubai arrival stamp to the officers in Hatta border. Full details are explained here 

Visas upon arrival for eligible countries are quick and easy to obtain cost 20 OR for a 30 day validity. 
10-day visas are now (2018 July) available again, it cost 5 OR.

Always check the length of visa granted: people have reported being incorrectly granted a 10 day visa at land border crossing and inadvertently overstaying their visas. Penalties for overstaying visas are extremely high: 10 OR per person per day, payable at the border where you entered Oman.

You can drive from Al Ghaydah in . The journey is about 6 hours via the border crossing at Sarfeit to and then another 10 to Muscat.

Get around

By taxi

Maxi taxis (vans, known throughout the expat community as baisa busses) ply the highway from Seeb to the corniche area. The charge is 100 baisa from corniche area to the church round about and another 100 baisa from the church round about to Wadi Adai.

On arrival at the airport, situated approximately 40km from the main Muscat CBD, you can get a baisa bus down the main highway in either direction.

The (mostly orange and white) taxis are a bit pricier, and they hang around the hotels where they get juicy fares from unwary travellers. They will charge 8 Rials for an airport trip if you don't , but you should be able to barter for 5 Rials. They always say they will give you "good price" but its best to figure out what you want to spend then agree before you get in.

The Maxi Taxis ply the main routes through town, and they go where they want so you might have to find one going your direction, once you are on one, they will make sure you get there. THe place to wait for them is on the on-ramps of most of the main highway junctions, you'll usually see a few people waiting around for one. A journey within the Muscat area should not cost more than 300 Baisa each, but if you look like an experienced traveller and hand them 200 baisa then you can usually get away with that.

By car

There are many rent-a-car services available in the city. There is much conflicting information as to whether an international driving licence is required for renting out a car. According to the Royal Omani Police website, a valid license from your home country is sufficient for up to 90 days. It is best to verify this with the rental company. Most of the Car Rentals have offices at the airport arrivals terminal.

"Masafi" and "Darbat" are also brands at reasonable rates - RO 1 for 12*1.5 lts. Bottled water is safer

Contact

Get out
* - the jewel of southern Oman, with incredible beaches and plantations.
* - you can cross the border and visit "disneyland" in Arabia
* - nice drive through the to this scenic town, or stay in Nizwa and explore the mountains and forts. Good base for the trip to Jebel Shams and many other historical sites, caves and walks. 

* Wadi Shab. This is perhaps the most spectacular of all the easily accessible wadis in Oman. It is located about 100 km southeast of Muscat, accessed from the main coastal road to at the village of Tiwi. The pools here are a vivid emerald green colour, and the caves and sheer sides of the wadi are quite dramatic. The car park under the highway is the starting point for the short boat ride (1 OR per person) across the wadi, and thereafter it is a 45-60 minute walk to the pools. Rock scrambling required, be careful as many people have fallen while taking photos. Past the third pool there is a narrow underwater passage to an amazing waterfall. Wear clothes you can swim in (women can wear bikinis and shirts) and sturdy shoes, but leave your belongings in the car.
