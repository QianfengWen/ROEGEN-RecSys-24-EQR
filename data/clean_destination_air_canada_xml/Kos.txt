See
* The main port and population centre on the island, also called Kos, is also the tourist and cultural centre, with whitewashed buildings including many hotels, restaurants and a small number of nightclubs forming the famous Kos town "bar street". The town has remnants of the domination by the Knights Hospitaller of Rhodes (1315-1523), the Ottomans (1523-1911) and the Italians (1911-1943). In the urban network you will find several archaeological sites, where reperts from Greek and Roman times have been excavated and exposed. The ruins of the Ancient Gymnasium feature 17 columns. The ancient Odeon is very well preserved, together with the Roman House. The Knights' domination left an impressive castle by the port (ticket: 3€), while the Ottomans adorned the town with several mosques and fountains. The Italian domination may be noticed in some early-XX century buildings, among which is the Venetian-style palace, by the port, that now houses the local police and tribunal.
:The ancient physician Hippocrates is thought to have been born on Kos. In the center of town you will find the Plane Tree of Hippocrates, a 'dream temple' where the physician is traditionally supposed to have taught. The limbs of the now elderly tree are supported by scaffolding. The small city is also home to the International Hippocratic Institute and the Hippocratic Museum dedicated to him. 

* Some 5 km out of Kos town, the Asklepeion (temple of Asclepius, hospital and medicine academy) was once the training place for Hippocrates (entry ticket: 4€; tourist road train from the port: 5€ A/R)

* Following the coast from Kos Town towards South-East and passing the cape of Agios Fokas (beautiful and less frequented pebbled beach, one reaches Thermae at the end of the paved road. Here on the beach, after a steep descent, thermal waters come out at a temperature of around 40-50°C all year round (bus #5 from the port, 1,50€ for the bus ticket bought in the ticket booth, 2€ if bought onboard; free entrance on the thermal beach) Please note that the last bus going back from Thermas beach leaves at 16.30, so if you want to stay longer you would have to walk back along the road to MichaelAngelo Hotel (15/20 min) from where buses for Kos Town leave until late (last one close to 11 pm).

* Kardamena, on the south-east coast, is a popular resort for young British holidaymakers and has a large number of bars and nightclubs.

* The beaches of the Kefalos isthmus (south-west of the island) are the most renowned; among these is Paradise beach. Kefalos is near the ancient capital of the island, Astipalia, and holds the ruins of a castle. Kamari bay holds a few sandy and a few pebbled bits of beaches, with a winding road leading up to the the village of Kefalos, Be sure to check out some of the shops up in the village including the coffee and cake shops, continuing through the village will take you to the end of the island and the beach of Aghios Theologos with its restaurant waiting for sundown.

Larger local supermarkets

*Carrefour has three branches around Kos town: the biggest one is by the main road leading from Kos town to Zipari around 5km out of town. Smaller Carrefour supermarkets are close to the corner of Porfiriou and Ethnikis Antistaseos in the northern part of town and in Zipari on the main road.

*In general small local shops found in less touristic zones (=further from the shore) would have better prices. Fruit Corner located at the corner of Plastira and Makrigianni St. in the SE part of town is one of them.

Eat
If you're on a budget, there is pita gyros for € 2,5 sold by most restaurants (some for 2€, e.g. at Shangri-La on square Diagora), to be accompanied by a pint of Greek beer for 1,50-2,00€. In general, try to look for the cheaper and not-that-super-touristic places a bit further from the beachside street. Usually 2-3 blocks should be enough.

Ouzo (similar to sambuca) is the local strong drink, served with snacks and with a glass of water (2,00€). Don't miss Retzina which is white (in most cases) wine flavoured with pine resin, very typical.

* Kos' bar street is formed by a couple of intersecting streets enclosed by the port and the ruins (Nafklirou) Usually very calm during the day, the area becomes bustling as from 12pm until morning, with lots of North European adolescents strolling through. Bars and clubs are very similar and the music is only very mainstream. Waiters and bar touts will approach you the moment you enter the area, by asking "where are you from" and offering supposedly advantageous deals (e.g. two beers and two shots for 6€); just turn them down. 

* For a more local experience, try Alsos bar on Epicharmou st. Here, local elderly men gather all day long to chat, have an ouzo or watch the match. The owner will gladly welcome off-the-beaten-track tourists too. Ouzo 2€, beer 2€, Greek salad 4€.

Stay Safe

Kos is a very safe area and should not be a major problem for travellers. Just take normal precautions.

The area of the barstreet and the port, by night, is not the safest (fights sometimes erupt among drunk youngsters). Private bodyguards are present at the exit by the port.

For every need, just refer to the local police; they are housed in the Venetian palace by the port, near Hippocrate's tree (G. Papandreou st.)

The services in the local hospital are quite cheap: e.g. an X-ray is only 3,50EUR ( as of summer 2014).

Remember to count given change as many vendors tend to 'forget' about 1 or 2EUR.
