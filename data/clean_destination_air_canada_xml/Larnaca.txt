Buy
The nearby village of Lefkara is famous for its lace and silverware, and Larnaca being the nearest large town to the village, sells both in plentiful supply.

Independent jewelers and watchmakers are abundant, particularly among and just off the main Ermes/Ermou Street.

Eat
Often, eating in Larnaca can be quite expensive. However, if you're traveling on a budget, there are a few bargains to be had. Possibly the cheapest way is by grabbing a hotdog at the 'Enjoy. Finikoudes' kiosk on, you guessed it, Phinikoudes Avenue. Hotdogs are just €1 and are rather enjoyable. If you prefer to sit down for a meal, try Ocean Basket (also on Phinikoudes Avenue) where a huge, tasty serving of Fish and Chips will set you back just €7 (2022), which is comparable to (if not less than) the price of a meal at the likes of Phinikoudes' McDonalds or KFC, which are also useful places for eating on a budget, even if they do lack that local touch.

The beaches of Larnaca are littered with identikit seafood restaurants catering to tourists. The easiest way to find a good place is to simply walk along until you find a restaurant packed not with tourists, but with Cypriots!

*Prasino Amaxoudi, or Green Cart in English, 20 Turan Road, tel. 24 622 939. It is placed on the corner of Turan Road and Buyuk Cami Road next to the big mosque at the end of the Promenade. They serve probably the best Sheftalia (traditional Cypriot meatballs) in Larnaca together with other regional specialties. Prices are most friendly (€6 for a generous portion of Sheftalia), just as the service. The atmosphere is authentic the place is usually filled with locals in spite of the touristic location. - P.S. by May 2018 this place has changed into Dimitris Souvlakeri, one of the many kiosks offering grilled meat. Inexpensive but soulless. Try the next one, rather. 

*Taverna Edesma (Lordou Vyrona, close to Pierides Museum). A family-run, friendly place offering all the typical Cyprus dishes. Inexpensive fresh food, and a nice, colorfully decorated backyard garden to eat outside without jutting on the street.

* Aldente Cucina Italiana, Located right on the beachfront of Larnaca, Phinikoudes Beach, a great place to enjoy authentic Italian cuisine and glance at the sea, +357 24 664540

* Militzis, 42 Piale Pascha, tel. 24-655867. A long-running favorite serving honest Cypriot fare (read: meat and potatoes) washed down with their own wine. No points for presentation, but the food is good and the restaurant is often packed. Figure on &pound;5-10 for a meal.

* Hobo's, Phinikoudes Promenade. A lively Cafe/Restaurant popular with many Cypriots, right on the main promenade. You can't miss it, and it is often full but doesn't take telephone reservations. Food is varied from Cypriot to International Cuisine.

*Kantara, Rendez-Vous, and Ganga restaurants on Dhekelia Road are probably the best restaurants in Larnaca. More expensive than the rest, but well worth it. Both Kantara and Rendez-Vous have a good selection of international wines (Cyprus wines are an acquired taste ... to say the least!)

* Expensive, but reknown Japanese restaurant serving sushi. Bookings are essential, as it is packed every night. Offers a wide range of delicious maki, California rolls, teppanyaki and more.

* Easy-going café/bar/restaurant that has ample space and menu variety for both breakfast and dinner. Very good quality European-style dishes, with some more adventurous selections, eg prawns with ouzo sauce.

* Vlachos Taverna on the Dhekelia Rd, 400 metres past the Palm Beach Hotel on the same side is a fantastic place to eat local food. Sheftalia is just great and the salads are lovely.

* Apollo Snack Bar, the Alley Way, Kition Building, relatively close to the beach strip is a very nice snack bar tucked away in a back alley. Affordable, enormous and tasty portions, the owner is very friendly as well! 4-8 EUR for a decent lunch snack.

Drink
In the, city center an area just off the main promenade called "Laiki Yeitonia" fulfills the need for most Bars and Small scale Nightclubs. Club Deep is the most popular of these, along with Times. 

Driving about 15-20 minutes away from the City Centre to the East in the direction of Ayia Napa is the Larnaca-Dhekelia Road. This is the main 'strip' for high-quality hotels, nightclubs, bars, etc, and is where most British Tourists can be found.

* Blue Pine Bar near the American Academy has a huge selection of spirits (all real which is unusual for Cyprus) and has a real atmosphere. The decor is wood and dim lighting and lots of Jack Daniels and Blues music paraphernalia. Comes alive after 10PM. The Bar used to be located on Dhekelia Road but moved several years ago. By far the best bar in Larnaca for chilled music and spirits.
