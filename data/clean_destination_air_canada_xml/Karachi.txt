Karachi (Urdu: كراچى, Sindhi: ڪراچي) is the capital of the province of , and is the largest city and financial capital of . 

Beginning in 1947 at partition of the British Raj, when hundreds of thousands of Muhajirs from India sought refuge, the population has exploded from about 450,000 to an estimated 18 million today. With more than a million new inhabitants pouring in each year, it's not surprising that the stretch marks are showing in one of the largest and most rapidly growing cities in this world!

Karachi, located on the coast of the Arabian Sea, is the financial and commercial centre of the nation, as well as its largest port. Karachi is different from the rest of Pakistan in the same way that New York is different from the rest of the United States. The pace of life is more hurried, and social attitudes are far more liberal than elsewhere in Pakistan. Locals call it: the City of Lights, the City of The Quaid, and the City that Never Sleeps. 

The city credits its growth to the mixed populations of economic and political migrants along with refugees from different national, provincial, linguistic and religious origins, who generally come to the city to settle permanently. Residents and those born in the city are called "Karachi-ites" and almost 98% of the population in Karachi understands the Urdu language.

Districts
Karachi is a huge city and an administrative division of Sindh Province. The Karachi division is officially divided into five districts, which are further subdivided into eighteen towns that are administered by the city government, and six military cantonments which are administered by the Pakistan Army.

For this guide, the six military cantonments have been incorporated into their respective districts below, so that visitors should find the conceptual region list below more useful:

:"You will yet be the glory of the East; would that I could come again, Karachi, to see you in your grandeur" &mdash; Charles James Napier

Karachi is the most diverse and cosmopolitan city in Pakistan and may offer a hint as to the future direction of modern life in Pakistan. In many ways, it can be compared to New York where the pace of life is more hurried and the time is money. Large numbers of non-Muslim religious communities are settled in Karachi compared to other Pakistan cities: Hindus, Christians, Parsis, Sikhs, Bahai, Jews, Buddhists as well as Zoroastrians. Karachi's inhabitants, locally known as Karachiites, are a cosmopolitan population composed of many ethno-linguistic groups from all parts of Pakistan, as well as migrants from several different countries and regions including India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, China and Uganda, making the city's population a diverse melting pot.

History
The early history of Karachi dates back to 327–325 BC, when Alexander the Great used the city to camped and prepare a fleet for Babylonia. Karachi was later known to the Arabs as Debal from where Muhammad bin Qasim led his conquering force into South Asia in 712 AD. The modern day history of Karachi begins when it was made the capital of Sindh in the 1840s. In 1878 under the British Raj, the city was connected to the rest of British India by rail. Public building projects, such as Frere Hall and the Empress Market were undertaken. In 1876, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, was born in the city. Following the independence of Pakistan in 1947, Karachi had become a bustling metropolis with beautiful classical and colonial European styled buildings, lining the city’s thoroughfares. Karachi was chosen as the capital of Pakistan. In 1960, the capital of Pakistan was moved from Karachi to the newly built Islamabad. During the 1960s, Karachi was seen as an economic role model around the world. Many countries sought to emulate Pakistan's economic planning strategy and one of them, South Korea, copied the city's second "Five-Year Plan" and world Financial Centre in Seoul is designed and modelled after Karachi. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, ethnic and political violence broke out across the city between Muhajir followers of the Mohajir Quami Movement, ethnic Sindhis and Punjabis and state forces. As a result, the Pakistani army was deployed to restore peace in the city.

Climate

Located on the coast, Karachi has a relatively mild climate with low levels of rainfall of approximately 250&nbsp;mm (10&nbsp;inches) each year, the bulk of which occurs during the July-August monsoon season. Winters are mild, and the summers are hot. The city's proximity to the sea keeps humidity levels at a near-constant high, and cool sea breezes relieve the heat of the summer months. Due to the high temperatures during the summer (ranging from 30-44°C from April to October), the winter months (November to February) are generally considered the best times to visit Karachi. July, December and January have pleasing and cloudy weather when most of the social events, ranging from weddings to charity fund raisers, frequently take place. Tourists and expatriates usually visit Karachi in these months. Karachi's weather is considered mild and can be compared to Florida's weather (except for the precipitation). The highest ever recorded temperature in Karachi is 47.8°C while the lowest is 0°C.

Culture
The everyday lifestyle of Karachi differs substantially from that of other cities and towns in Pakistan. Karachi's culture is characterized by the blending of Middle Eastern, Central Asian, South Asian and Western influences, as well as the city's status as a major international business centre. As a whole, there is considerable diversity in culture, and this diversity has produced a unique cultural amalgam of its own type. Karachi also hosts the largest middle class stratum of the country.

Karachi is home to some of Pakistan's important cultural institutions. The National Academy of Performing Arts, located in the newly renovated Hindu Gymkhana offers a two-year diploma course in performing arts that includes classical music and contemporary theatre. The All Pakistan Music Conference, linked to the 45-year old similar institution in Lahore, has been holding its Annual Music Festival since its inception in 2004. The Festival is now a well-established feature of the city life of Karachi that is awaited anxiously and attended by more than 3000 citizens of Karachi as well as people from other cities.

The National Arts Council (Koocha-e-Saqafat) also has musical performances and Mushaira (poetry recitations).
The Kara Film Festival organized annually showcases independent Pakistani and international films and documentaries. Our Karachi Festival celebrates Architecture of Karachi.

Get around

Once you get the hang of traveling in Karachi, it becomes a very entertaining experience. You meet new people and get to see unexpected things. It's not very hard to find a mode of transportation and if you know what you are doing, it is very easy to get around.

By foot

Sometimes, walking may actually be the fastest way to get from point A to point B but much of Karachi is quite pedestrian-hostile. Distances are long and road signage is poor. But if you really want to walk around, always ensure you walk on the footpath, or if one isn't available, as far to the side of the road as possible and on the right facing on-coming traffic. The road is not that dangerous a place in Karachi, but many pedestrians are often injured by passive drivers. Those who are squeamish to pollution or have asthma may need to wear a mask; the air pollution from passing trucks and buses, combined with the searing heat and humidity can be overwhelming at times. If you really want to walk around, these places would be good:

*Walk from Dolmen City, Sea View to Salt n Papper Village and onwards (a walk of close to 2-3 km).
*Walk from Mereweather tower on II Chundrigar Road to the National Museum of Pakistan on Dr. Ziauddin Ahmed Road and towards Arts Council of Pakistan on MR Kiyani Road.
*Walk on Club Road from Sheraton Hotel/PC Hotel to Frere Hall on Abdullah Haroon Road

By bus

The most common method of traveling in Karachi is by bus and is used by most people. Regular bus services link the airport with the city and the journey time is around 50 minutes. For lack of space, people often sit on roof, or hang from bars, and are jam-packed inside the bus. Outsiders might be put off by the cramped conditions in the buses, and might prefer traveling in taxis. But for very tight budget travelers, bus is the only option. Karachi Bus routes and numbers can be checked here and the mini buses and coaches routes can be checked at

ATMs exist almost every where across the city including airport and major hotels and accept major credit/ debit cards including Visa, MasterCard, American Express, UnionPay etc. ATMs charge fee of 3% of the transaction amount for foreign currency transaction. 

The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing foreign currency transactions is a wholesale market rate selected by Visa from within a range of wholesale rates in effect plus the Bank charges of 3% as the Foreign Currency Conversion Fee.

Also try, Lassi which is a classic yogurt drink that is served either plain or sweet, and is sometimes flavored or even fused with fresh fruit. Rooh-Afza, a red-color-sweet-herbal drink. Sugar Cane Juice which is extracted by mechanical force, it is best when fresh. You would also love the Falouda and Gola Ganda which include various kinds of syrups in crushed ice.

Wifi, There are several free Wifi Hotspots in Karachi in hotels, malls and cafes/resturants. Wateen HotSpot is a paid WiFi service, which is being offered free of any charges for a limited time only.

Cybercafes, used to be found on virtually every street corner with rates as low as Rs 15-20 per hour but most of them have closed now with the emergence of mobile internet but still some exist. The ones which exist usually use 14 inch monitors with Windows 2000, Windows 98 or Windows XP installed. They usually don't have a very fast operating system or decent internet speed so don't be too impatient. Also caution is advised for putting USB in these computers as they mostly have viruses.

Stay healthy

Karachi is a hot city. The temperatures from April through June regularly top 35°C, meaning that proper hydration is of the utmost importance hence you should keep a bottle of water with you at all times. Drink only bottled water so you may avoid any water-related illness. Also, Drink a lot of water, 8 glasses a day, particularly in the summer.

Keep yourself covered in summers to avoid a heat stroke. Do not eat food that has been lying out for some time, as high temperatures speed up deterioration. Some street food can be very spicy! Always notify your host, cook or waiter if you can not stomach very spicy food.

Stay safe

Street crime in Karachi is about what you'd expect from a big city. Use common sense and avoid dangerous areas. Avoid going out alone, or walking by yourself on dark, empty streets. Never flash electronics or valuables in public; keep your cell phones, watches, and purses in a safe place. These things easily attract attention. There are also con men looking out for foreigners, so if someone you don't trust approaches you, just keep on walking. Beware of pickpockets when you are in any crowded areas. 

If you are planning to see colonial public buildings, especially those that are located on MA Jinnah road or Preedy street, try to see them at late evening, after 10PM or at early morning, before 7AM because traffic in those streets are a nightmare during the day time.

The people of Karachi are very hospitable. They tend to welcome any foreigner very warmly, but regardless of how nice someone seems you should remain aware and alert at all times, and try to keep a low profile at all times.

Karachi has mostly been spared the attacks that have happened in the rest of the country, but "mostly" is a relative term. You should always keep the emergency telephone contact numbers of your country's consulate in Karachi.
 
There should be no serious danger in the affluent parts of the city. Defence and Clifton are regarded as safe at all times, as they are populated by the city's business and cultural elite. These districts offer the most "tourist-friendly" experience of Karachi, given that there will be no language barrier (most Pakistanis can speak some English, and many people in these districts will be completely fluent). Most visitors will find there is a large degree of cultural understanding and compatibility between the residents of Karachi and western tourists. 

Traffic jams are a major hassle in Karachi. Although the city government has recently built dozens of underpasses and flyovers to get rid of the overflow of the traffic, it is a good idea to keep a look for any rallies/protests and check out alternate routes while traveling in the city. Do not attempt to drive in Karachi if you are new to the city since drivers are aggressive and chaotic.

Pedestrians should be careful while crossing roads as some drivers will neither slow down nor sound a horn to warn of an impending accident. This also applies when getting out of the car on the traffic side; look both ways until you are off the road and don't hesitate to run if you sense a car barreling towards you. Minibus drivers are particularly notorious.

Emergency Numbers

* 
* Sometimes police is not helpful in whole of Pakistan whether it's Karachi, Lahore or Islamabad. For instance, if you're threatened by a political party's military wing.
