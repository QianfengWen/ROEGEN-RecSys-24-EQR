Blantyre is the economic capital of .

Understand
Blantyre originates from the birthplace of the missionary Dr David Livingston, who was born in Blantyre, Scotland. Blantyre is the main commercial city in Malawi.

Get in

By plane
* It is located about 16km (9 mi) north of the city, about a 15000 MWK taxi ride. Or take a minibus to Limbe direction which passes outside the airport for 1000MWK. They will drop you off 500 meters off the main bus station of Blantyre.

South African Airways has four flights per week between Johannesburg (South Africa) and Blantyre. Air Malawi also flies to JNB, as well as Dar es Salaam (Tanzania), Harare (Zimbabwe), Lusaka (Zambia), and Nairobi (Kenya). Ethiopian Airlines has daily flights to Addis Ababa and Kenyan Airways to Nairobi.

By train

By bus
From Lilongwe International Airport get a luxury bus to Blantyre Bus depot on Chileka Road. If you prefer a cheaper option from Lilongwe, head to the bus depot in the old town area. From there you will have a wide selection of coaches heading south. National Bus and Axa (k2000, August 2012) are the most reputable companies, but there are plenty of other options, too.

From Jo-burg there are 24-hour luxury buses to Blantyre.

Buses from Harare (approx 8 hours) are also available.

By car
Take the M1 south of Lilongwe.

By boat

Get around
For the budget traveler, there are basically two ways of getting around Blantyre. By foot or by minibusses. By day it is quite safe to walk around Blantyre provided you don't look like a rich tourist, in which case you may be unpleasantly tailed by street vendors and beggars. It is possible to explore the entire city of Blantyre on foot within a couple of days, and unless you are traveling to Limbe or to the outer suburbs of Blantyre, then it is unlikely you'll require even the minibus. In the event that you do, then minibusses are very cheap, travelling between Blantyre and Limbe costs MK 150 (as of August 2012). Alternatively, you may consider hiring a bicycle if you are that way inclined. It is unsafe to walk around Blantyre during the night and we would recommend that you obtain the phone numbers of a few reliable taxi drivers (talk to some of the locals). Taxis are relatively more expensive, and the price also depends on how far the driver has to come to pick you up, but this is much preferable to being mugged in a dark Blantyre street late at night. As a general rule, all taxi drivers begin at the Mount Soche Hotel.

* It is at the top of the hill on the other side of the river from downtown. The building is one of the oldest in Blantyre and is beautiful, as are the spacious grounds. There's plenty of outside seating and a children's playground too. The cafe serves $6-8 lunches, various coffees, ice cream, and cake.

* Opened in 1966 The museum exhibits mainly on the history and culture of Malawi and the wildlife of Malawi’s national parks.
* Once described as the first permanent church between the Zambezi and the Nile this church was designed by a Scottish missionary helped by local workers. He, David Scott, had no architectural or building experience at all and had no written plans. This was just as well as The Church of Scotland would have stopped his plans had they known how ambitious they were. He was also writing a language dictionary at the time of building. This also is where Blantyre was founded when a local chief gave land to the Scottish missionaries and a slave freed by David Livingstone.

Work

Buy
Blantyre is the commercial center of Malawi and travelers come in from all over the region (including neighboring Mozambique) to stock up on supplies--food, construction materials, electronics, etc. The downtown area is full of Asian (Indian) run shops, as is nearby Limbe. A bustling market area popular with locals offers all kinds of fruits, veggies, used clothing, construction materials, etc. on the cheap. Newer Western-style shops are available for those who just want to get in and get out (i.e. Game and Shoprite at Chichiri). Savers Choice is a well-stocked Asian-run store heading toward Limbe that caters to the expat community with hard-to-find food items, a good bakery, an ice-cream bar, and a candy shop. Prices for the same thing can often vary from shop to shop and an abundance of counterfeited products flood the market, so it's best to shop around and stay on guard.

They sell a range of food items from fried chips, chicken, etc. to hard-boiled eggs, bread (mostly milk-scone variety and yellow buns), biscuits (locally made from Universal Industries), and so on.

Contact
There is an internet cafe (and library) near Phoenix International School. Come off Chileka Road either at St Michael and All Angels Church or at Phoenix School. From there ask around for directions to the 'Resource Centre and Library' - or failing that ask for directions to Phoenix School.

From the Phoenix International School entrance itself, you would head down the gentle slope (away from the main road - which would be down a steeper slope) and there is a building directly in front of you. That is where the internet cafe, resource center, and library is located. The entrance to the school faces directly towards the Phoenix School gates.

Lewis (mob: 0999 220 572) is the manager and will quickly get you online for a modest fee.
