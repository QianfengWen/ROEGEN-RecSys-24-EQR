Helsinki (Finnish) or Helsingfors (Swedish) is the capital of . Founded in 1550, the "Daughter of the Baltic" has been the Finnish capital since 1812, when it was rebuilt by the tsars of Russia along the lines of a miniature St. Petersburg, a role it has played in many Cold War movies. Today, Helsinki pulls off the trick of being something of an international metropolis while still retaining a small-town feel. The best time to visit is in summer, when Finns peel off their overcoats and flock to outdoor bars and cafes to enjoy the sunshine.

Helsinki's current population is about 656 000, but the Greater Helsinki region including the suburbs of the neighboring administrative areas of and makes it over 1,3 million in total.

Understand

History
Helsinki was founded in A.D. 1550 by King Gustav Vasa of Sweden as a trading post to compete with to the south in Estonia, which was Danish at that time. Its growth was slow until the establishment of Sveaborg (nowadays Suomenlinna) Maritime Fortress in the front of Helsinki in the middle of 18th century. In 1809, Finland was annexed by Russia during a war of that period and the capital of Finland moved from to Helsinki in 1812. The Czar felt the Grand Duchy of Finland needed a capital of grand proportions. The architects Johan Albrecht Ehrenström, a native Finn, and Carl Ludwig Engel, from Germany, were given the task of rebuilding Helsinki in the Empire style. This can be seen today around the Lutheran Cathedral, which was completed in 1852. The same style, and even architects, is also a part of 's history. Though thoroughly a Nordic capital, Helsinki today reflects the influences gained from the Western and Eastern cultures.

Orientation

The county of Helsinki forms the core of Finland's largest urban area, known in Finnish as the "capital area" (pääkaupunkiseutu). Helsinki is bordered by the Gulf of Finland to the south, while the suburban municipality Espoo, with the embedded tiny enclave town of Kauniainen, is to the west. The more industrialized municipality of Vantaa is to the north and east. Beyond these three the suburbs rapidly give way to small towns, farms and forests, most notably at the intersection of Espoo, Vihti and Kirkkonummi.

Within Helsinki itself, the city center is on the southern peninsula at the end of the city's main thoroughfare Mannerheimintie (or just Mansku). Both the central railway station and the main bus terminal are in the city center. Shopping streets Aleksanterinkatu (or Aleksi for short) and Esplanadi (or Espa) connect to Senate Square (Senaatintori), the historical center of the city. See the Helsinki Guide Map for an interactive searchable map of the city.

Tourist information
There is a tourist information at the central railway station on the western wing, for opening times and contact details see 

myhelsinki.fi provides mamy tools and insighful info about the capital region. 

Climate
Helsinki has a continental climate, with significant moderation from the sea and it's the coldest major city in Scandinavia and one of the coldest cities in Europe. Winters are damp, snowy and cold and temperatures usually stay below freezing and regularly fall down to -10°C (14°F) and below in February (the coldest month). However, Helsinki is located in the extreme south of Finland meaning that below -20°C (-4°F) temperatures happen a couple of times a year at most. The record low is -35°C (-31°F). Snow cover usually becomes permanent only by late December, but there is no guarantee of snow in Helsinki for Christmas, and even in mid-winter a couple of warm days can turn the streets to grey slush. In most years the sea freezes by the end of January.

Snow starts to melt in March, but snow flurries are still possible in early May (the average low in May is 6.3°C or 43.3°F). Starting in April, however, it is usually quite sunny and nice, and the summer is there in full force by mid-June. Autumn starts slowly by the end of August as nights become colder, and the first snow can some as early as in October. 

Summer is when the people of Helsinki are most active. However it can feel much cooler to people from the rest of Europe (especially Southern Europe) as the average high is a mild 21°C (70°F) but the mercury can dip down to 14°C (57°F) during the night and occasionally down to 10°C (50°F). This doesn't mean though, that Helsinki isn't affected by warm air masses from the south leading to 25°C+ (75°F) temperatures during the afternoon but being moderated by the sea. The record high is 32°C (90°F).

People
Helsinki is Finland's most multicultural city. There are over 140 nationalities present in Helsinki. There are over 108,000 foreigners in the city, around 17% of the population. The largest groups are from Russia (18,867), Estonia (12,970), Somalia (10,192), Iraq (5,333), Sweden (3,456) and China (3,454). 

Historically Helsinki used to be predominantly Swedish-speaking area like much of the coast, until industrialization brought huge influx of Finnish-speaking workers into the city in the late 19th century. 

By ethnicity, 4.60% of current populace is from another EU member state, 3.61% other European, 2.59% are Sub-Saharan African, 2.56% East Asian and South/South East Asian, 2.53% Middle Eastern and North African and 1.05% other, mostly American, Canadian and Latino. 

Some neighborhoods have large amounts of immigrants. In Kallahti up to 40% of the population consists of immigrants. Overall the number of immigrants is higher in eastern suburbs of the city. 

Helsinki is also home to wide range of different religions, like Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism and Sikhism. There are 35,000 (5.44%) Muslims in the city, based on ethnic origin.

Talk
The city is officially bilingual, with a 79 percent Finnish-speaking majority and a visible 6 percent Swedish-speaking minority. However, most of the Finnish-speaking majority only know the very basics of Swedish, which they learned in school. Most Finns speak English more fluently than Swedish. Although locals will appreciate an effort to say a few words in Finnish, they will readily switch to English.

The most spoken non-native languages are Russian, Estonian, Somali, Arabic, English, Chinese, Kurdish, Persian and Spanish.

Street names and many signs in Helsinki are in both Finnish and Swedish, and most of the time in English. There are trilingual signs of Finnish, Swedish and Russian at Sofiegatan street.

Get in

By plane
All international and domestic flights land at the compact, modern and airy Helsinki-Vantaa International Airport (, ), which is located in Vantaa, 18 kilometers to the north of the central Helsinki. Note that in recent years the airport has become crowded, so expect delays when going through security, particularly during the Scandinavian summer holiday period. As of June 2022, there is only one terminal in the airport; The former T1 and T2 were combined into one brand new terminal.

 Taxi from the airport 

Regular taxis to the center cost &euro;30–50 and elsewhere about €8–€12 plus €1.40–€1.60/km. There is 4 taxi lines at the airport terminals: lines for the companies Lähitaksi, Taksi Helsinki and Vantaan taksi, and one line for all other companies. The price differences for Lähitaksi, Taksi Helsinki and Vantaan taksi are small: the fixed price to Helsinki city center varies for example between €39 and €43. There is an electronic sign at each of the three lines listing the current prices. 

For the taxis in the fourth line there is no price ceiling, so it is extremely important that you check carefully the price before boarding the taxi. None of the taxis will probably be a scam, but it's still good to verify beforehand that the taxi isn't a scam. By law the taxi driver has to tell you if the trip will cost more than €100, but otherwise there aren't any regulations. 

* Shared Airport Taxi (tel. 0600 555 555 for bookings) mini-vans start from &euro;29 for two (mind that infants count as an adult.) 

* Yellow Line is a good, cost-effective option for getting from the airport to the city center. Minivans carry up to seven or eight passengers and drop passengers off at their individual destinations. The shuttles can be found at their bright yellow desks in arrivals lounges 1 and 2. Prices start from &euro;29 for one or two passengers and varies based on the number of people in the van.

For other taxi trips than the trip from the airport, and full pricing, see .

 Public transport from the airport 

A new ring rail connection to Helsinki opened in July 2015. The trains run in a loop, with I-trains going east and P-trains going west from the airport. The trip takes approximately 30 minutes. The trains run every ten minutes during peak hours, but during the night service is much more limited. 

The intermodal Journey Planner is your essential tool for getting around Helsinki with public transport.

By car
Expressways connect Helsinki to to the west, and to the north, and to and towards in the east.

By bus
Long-distance national and international buses terminate at the new underground Central Bus Station (Linja-autoasema) in the Kamppi Center (Kampin Keskus). The station is adjacent to Mannerheimintie, directly connected to the Kamppi metro station and within a short walking distance from the Central Railway Station.

Low-cost bus operator Onnibus operates many lines and are rapidly expanding their connection network. Check latest information on connections from their website Prices start from as low as 3 EUR (if booked in advance). All Onnibus buses nowadays depart from Kamppi but make sure to check the website for any changes. 

For travel from (Russia), Russian minibuses depart from the Oktyabrskaya Hotel (opp Moskovsky train station) three times a day (typically 7AM, 9PM and 11PM) and arrive behind Tennispalatsi at Eteläinen Rautatiekatu 8, one block away from Kamppi, early in the morning. Departures back start around 11AM in the morning (typically 11AM, 3PM and 8PM). Other minibuses are parked along Fredrikinkatu, with the departure time and price often posted on them. The trip costs around 10 euros, making this by far the cheapest option, but the buses are cramped and uncomfortable and some of them stop at numerous supermarkets on the way so that Russian passengers can go for tax-free shopping. Do not expect drivers to speak anything but Russian. The border crossing time might be substantially longer than with regular buses.

By regular ferry

Helsinki is well connected with ferry services to () and (), and there are limited services to & , as well as , and ().

Three companies (Tallink, Viking Line, Eckerö Line) operate lines to Tallinn. The trip to Tallinn takes about 2 hours on shuttle ships, and longer on cruise ships (M/S Silja Europa).

By cruise ship

Large cruise ships arrive at the Hernesaari neighborhood to quays B, C and D (codes LHB, LHC and LHD may also be used). Bus 14 has stops next to the quays. The stop is Hernesaaren laituri for quay D and Pihlajasaarenkatu for quays B and C, which have a common pedestrian gate. 

Bus 17 deparurtures 0.6 km from the entrance for quays B and C, from the stop Matalasalmenkuja. It runs only from Monday through Friday and the walk is a bit longer but it offers a direct connection to Market Square (Kauppatori) and Senate Square (Senaatintori). The Hernesaari-bound bus stops at Market Square but because of lack of space there is no stop in the other direction. Instead you have to use the stops Pohjoinen Makasiinikatu or Ritarihuone. 

The most centrally located stop of bus 14 is Kamppi (M). Tram 7 goes from that stop to the Market Square and Senate Square area. The name of the tram stop is Kampintori instead of Kamppi (M). The Kamppi (M) stop is in the newer part of the city center.

Get around

Central Helsinki is rather compact and can be explored on foot by energetic visitors. A combination of walking and public transportation might be most convenient to cover the sights in Helsinki. HSL provides the successful Journey planner , an intermodal journey planner for public transport of greater metropolitan area of Helsinki. Also cycling route finding is provided by the Journey Planner. 

By public transportation

Tickets

All public transportation within Helsinki, Espoo, Vantaa and Kauniainen is coordinated by HSL 

You can opt for the Helsinki Card (1 day &euro;46, children &euro;23, to 3 days &euro;66, children &euro;33) which in addition to public transport also offers free admission to a number of museums and attractions, including all museums, a sightseeing bus and a canal route by boat. The public transport ticket is not valid to the airport if you have a Helsinki Card CITY, since the airport is located in zone C and the card is valid in zones AB. Helsinki City REGION is valid also in zone C.

The following basic ticket types are available:

* AB single ticket (AB-kertalippu) (&euro;2,80) &mdash; valid on all HSL services within about 15 km from the city center for 80 mins.
* ABC single ticket (ABC-kertalippu) (&euro;4,10) &mdash; valid for 90 mins within and between Helsinki, Espoo, Vantaa and Kauniainen.
* ABCD single ticket (&euro;5,70) &mdash; the above plus , , , and .
* Day ticket (matkailijalippu) (&euro;8,00) &mdash; valid on all HSL services within zones AB for 24 hours. Each additional day costs &euro;4,00. if you are travelling outside of the zones AB, to the airport or Espoo for example, you can buy an ABC 24-hour ticket for 11 € in 2022. The HSL current prices are here 

All tickets allow unlimited transfers within their validity periods and regions. Children under 7 travel free, while tickets for children under 16 are half price.

* You can buy the ticket from a kiosk, a ticket machine or a parking ticket machine. At places such as the airport you can buy the ticket from the blue HSL machines, but not the green VR machines. The VR machines are for travelling with the trains to destinations outside the metropolitan area. All commuter train and metro stations have at least one vending machine. Only some tram stops have a machine, such as the stops next to railway station or Senaatintori (the historical main square of Helsinki). Otherwise tickets for the tram must be bought from kiosks or parking ticket machines. Parking ticket machines are marked on maps on the tram stops. There is parking ticket machines at for example Pohjoiseplanadi and Eteläesplanadi, and you can buy tram tickets from these. 
* If you have a HSL travel card, you can buy the ticket on the train or tram itself using the machines, or in the small machine at the start of the metro station escalator or at the entrance of the Suomenlinna ferry.
* Tickets bought from any ticket machines are valid immediately. Tickets bought from kiosks, tourist information points and Stockmann are bought beforehand and punched/activated on the means of transport or before entering the platform, depending on the mode of transport. 

Day tickets can be bought for 1-7 days, either only for AB or also for zone C, the airport being located in that zone. Check the current pricing in order to know whether it's cheper to buy a day ticket including the airport or whether it's cheaper to buy a day ticket for AB + tickets from and to the airport. All touristy places are in zone A.

* A day ticket for 24 hours can be bought in R-kioski, Stop@Station, tourist information points, the HSL ticket machines and parking ticket machines. 
* A day ticket for 2 to 7 days can be bought at R-kioski, Stop@Station and tourist information points. 
* Your hotel or cruise ship may also sometimes sell day tickets in the reception.
* 24 h tickets bought from any ticket machines are valid immediately. All other tickets are bought beforehand and punched/activated on the train, tram or bus, or before entering the metro station or Suomenlinna ferry. 
* Therefore, if the ticket isn't a 24 h tickets bought from a ticket machine, and you haven't activated it, you will be levied an inspection fee of €80.

* A modern option for travel card and paper tickets is the mobile app The prices of single tickets are the same as when using a travel card, the prices for day tickets are the same as for all other day tickets. The mobile app could be convenient if you for example do not know where the nearest parking ticket machine or kiosk is when using a tram. You must enter your credit card information, buy the ticket and wait for confirmation before you board the train, tram or ferry, or enter the metro station area. Otherwise you will be fined €80, if you are still in the process of buying the ticket, or bought it after you boarded the vehicle/entered the area and the inspector notices this. 

You can buy a Travel Card (HSL card) a reloadable smartcard sold at the R-kiosks and HSL offices, very similar to 's Oyster card. The Travel Card costs &euro;5 (nonrefundable) and gives a 25% discount on single tickets. You can not buy tickets for 1 to 7 days with the card, only single tickets. 

When using the card, you must first choose the desired ticket type, then confirm by pressing ok and finally show the card. Hold the card without pressing anything to see the remaining value or to register a transfer. One unadvertised but handy feature of the card is that it can be used by multiple people at once &mdash;. First choose the desired ticket, then press the small + symbol with a person on it, choose how many tickets you need, confirm with ok, and show the card. In case you have already bought one ticket, you are not able to buy more tickets during the validity of the first ticket, so be careful to buy the desired amount of tickets at once. 

The shortest possible period with the travel card is 14 days. For example 14 days for the zones AB costs €69.30. Season tickets are more expensive for non-residents as the prices for residents are subsidized from tax revenues; for example 14 days in AB for a resident in HSL area costs only €28.70. All fares can be seen at remember to look at the fares for non-residents.

 About the transportation itself 

The very useful HSL Journey Planner will get you from a street address, place or sight to another by suggesting possible public transport connections, covering the entire metropolitan Helsinki region. Try eg. "Airport" or "Railway station" for place names. It is also available in several third party mobile apps for most smart phones, which can use GPS to find your current location.

Getting around at night can be a bit tricky, as most trains and trams stop before midnight and the buses before 2AM. A limited night bus network, all leaving from the city center, runs until 2AM, on weekends and nights before public holidays also after 2AM. Services are replaced mainly by buses departing to suburbs from Kampin paikallisliikenneterminaali, Elielinaukio, Rautatientori and Postitalo. 

* Kampin paikallisliikenneterminaali (literally local traffic terminal) is about half a kilometre west from the central railway station inside a shopping mall. The address for the night entrance is Narinkka 1. Do not take the escalator down from the entrance - it leads to the terminal for long-distance buses and your bus will likely depart from the terminal for local traffic. Watch out for the signs saying paikallisliikenneterminaali. There is, however, long-distance buses that accept HSL travel cards, so if the travel planner Reittiopas.fi is saying that you should use a long-distance bus, use one.
* Elielinaukio is a large terminal on the west side of the railroad station.
* Rautatientori is a large terminal on the east side of the railroad station.
* Postitalo is a yellow large building on the west side of the railroad station. The stop is on the southern side of the building, between the department store of Sokos and Postitalo.

There is also two lines running within inner Helsinki and serving areas not served by suburban buses, the lines 18N and 23N. 18N departs from "Kamppi (M)", from the Kamppi shopping mall but not from the terminal within the shopping mall, instead departing from a stop on the west side of the shopping mall on the street Fredrikinkatu. 23N departs from Rautatientori, but not from the terminal, instead departing from the street Kaivokatu in northbound direction and street Mikonkatu in westbound direction. 23N serves for example the bar district of Kallio.

Check the night connections to your area beforehand if you are residing outside the city center.

There are no ticket checks when getting on the metro, trains, trams or the Suomenlinna ferry, but ticket inspectors in blue uniforms do random checks on board. If you choose to ride without a ticket, watch out for the inspectors, as getting caught without a ticket results in an &euro;80 fine plus the ticket price.

Trams

For tourists the most convenient and scenic means of travel is arguably the extensive tram network that covers the non-suburbian core part of the city. Trams cease running for the night (last service is usually between 9 p.m. and 2 a.m, depending on line, and may have shortened route).
The tram network is currently undergoing expansion and restructuring. You should consider obtaining an updated tram map from Helsinki tourist info or from HSL, the local public transport authority.

Buses
While the trams operate in the city center, buses cover the rest of the city. The main stations for northbound and eastbound buses are on the two squares adjacent to the Central Railway Station: Eliel Square (Elielinaukio) and Railway Square (Rautatientori). Some buses operate from the underground bus station in the Kamppi Center which is adjacent to the Kamppi metro station.

Buses are always entered through the front door and exited through the middle and back doors. When getting on the bus with a ticket you have bought earlier, you need to show it to the driver.

Metro

A metro line runs from the Matinkylä suburb in Espoo in the west, through the city center, and then to the eastern suburbs. Apart from the metro stops at the shopping centers of Iso Omena (Matinkylä), Ainoa (Tapiola) and Itis (Itäkeskus), the Rastila camping site and Aurinkolahti Beach, few places along the line are of interest to tourists. After Itäkeskus in the east, the line splits in two, with one line going to Mellunmäki and the other to Vuosaari. From the city center, the travel time to the ends of each of the lines is about 20 minutes.

Local train
VR's suburban trains operate north from the Central Railway Station, branching out in three directions. HSL tickets are valid on local trains in Espoo, Helsinki, Järvenpää, Kauniainen, Kerava, Sipoo, Siuntio, Tuusula and Vantaa. The local trains are mainly of intestest to tourists when travelling to and from the airport, see .

Suomenlinna ferry
The HSL ferry to Suomenlinna from the Market Square (Kauppatori) is a cheap and popular summer getaway. Another HSL operated ferry, mostly used only by the island's residents, leaves from the eastern end of Katajanokka, an ordinary residential area from the 1980s. This ferry is a good option at warm beautiful summer days, as it will never have queues to it. In weekends, however, you have to use the Kauppatori ferry, since the Katajanokka ferry operates only weekdays. The Katajanokka ferry can incorporate several trucks, while the Kauppatori ferry is mainly intended for passengers, incorporating 1 or 2 passenger cars. 

The Kauppatori ferry has better views, so it's recommended to use it for one trip if you use the Katajanokka ferry for the other trip. The Kauppatori ferry departs from Suomenlinnan päälaituri (literally main pier) and the Katajanokka ferry from Suomenlinnan huoltolaituri (literally maintenance pier) at the islands, the piers having different locations. 

In addition, private operators provide ferries to Suomenlinna and various other islands during the summer; however, schedules can be sparse. These departure from Kauppatori and the largest private operators are JT-Line ( and Suomen Saaristokuljetus ( 

The operator JT-Line operates to Suomenlinna. In Suomenlinna the private ferries dock also on the southern end of the islands, while the public ferries have their two terminals only at the northern end of the islands (which is closer to Kauppatori and Katajanokka). If you do not have the energy to walk back to the northern end once you have reached the southern end, you could take the private ferry from there and buy a ticket for the trip onboard. The southern end pier is named King's Port / Kuninkaanportti in the timetables.

Helsinki card, HSL's single ticket, day ticket, mobile phone app ticket and SMS ticket are all valid also on the HSL Suomenlinna ferry, but not on the private ferry.

There is also ferries to a number of other islands that have less to see than Suomenlinna, but may provide for example a possibility to grill on an open fire or camp overnight, both of which are forbidden in Suomenlinna. These include islands such as Isosaari, Pihlajasaari, Vallisaari and several islands on the eastern archipelago route of Suomen Saaristokuljetus. Check beforehand what each island has to offer: Vartiosaari has for example 50 villas from the beginning of the 20th century and forest, Pihlajasaari has a beach and grilling and camping possiblity but no buildings except 2 or 3, and Vartiosaari has none of the amenities Pihlajasaari has. 

By taxi
 

Regular taxis cost about €3–€10 plus €1.50–€2/km. The price differences for companies such as FixuTaxi, Lähitaksi, Taksi Helsinki and Vantaan taksi are small: the fixed price from the airport to Helsinki city center varies for example between €35 and €47. However, there is no price ceiling for taxis at all, so it is extremely important that you check carefully the price before boarding the taxi. Your taxi will probably not be a scam, even though if it wouldn't be one of these companies that owns the taxi, but it's still good to verify beforehand that the taxi isn't a scam. By law the taxi driver have to tell you if the trip will cost more than €100, but otherwise there aren't any regulations. 

Here is some phone numbers and prices. Notice that the charge for waiting and slow driving is traditionally listed as simply charge for waiting in the respective websites, but it's always also a slow driving fee.

There is also mobile phone apps in addition to the phone numbers. In the app you can typically 
* locate yourself on a map and choose that as your starting point
* see where the car that accepted your order is currently
* see a price estimate or choose a fixed price.

* FixuTaxi, Lähitaksi and Taksi Helsinki can be ordered by using their own apps. 
* In the municipality of Helsinki you can order a Taksi Helsinki taxi with the app Valopilkku, and the app Valopilkku can be used in most municipalities outside the metropolitan area. In the other metropolitan area municipalities than Helsinki, Valopilkku can't be used. This is due to the combination that Lähitaksi had an monopoly status in these munipalities and it does not take part in the app.

FixuTaxi, +358 100 6060

FixuTaxi uses cheap Toyota cars, while Lähitaksi and Taksi Helsinki use typically new Mercedes-Benz or Volvo cars. The starting fee at for example on a weekday afternoon is €0.55 cheaper than the starting price for Lähitaksi, so the choice is mainly whether you will pay €0.55 for a luxurious car or not.

Vantaan Taksi

Has the same phone number and fares as Lähitaksi for other trips than trips from the airport. For these trips the company has a HEL airport taxi brand with it's own web site and separate pricing (

There are also surcharges for example pre-booking. These can be checked at the webpages of the companies. The pre-booking fare is usually about €7, so pre-book your taxi if you are travelling to the airport or otherwise need to be in your destination in a certain time. The Taksi Helsinki baggage fee is €2.80. Generally baggage that is considered large enough to warrant an extra charge is baggage that won't fit in the trunk easily, without, for example, folding down the back seat. This charge is also applied if you are travelling with a large pet - though service dogs travel free. 

During weekend nights and some popular events or holidays, it can be a bit difficult to find a taxi. Walk to the nearest taxi stand or try to book by phone (2-3 EUR/call) from Taxi Helsinki +358 100 0700 Lähitaksi +358 100 7300 or +358 100 6060 FixuTaxi. If you know in beforehand that you will need a taxi and you know the precise time, pre-order it. Call +358 100 0600 for Taxi Helsinki, otherwise the numbers are the same. A pre-order can be placed for a taxi maximum two weeks prior to the time the taxi is needed, and a minimum of a half an hour before. A pre-order fee of about €7 will be added to the taxi fare.

Drivers are not required to pick up a person hailing them on the street. If their light is on, and they pass a person hailing them, it is usually because there is a taxi stand very near by with available taxis waiting for customers. If you are not near a taxi stand, you'll very likely be able to hail a passing taxi with the light on. If the queues at night seem frustratingly long and you are willing to walk a bit, try heading towards Hakaniementori or Lauttasaari Bridge, where you can often hail a returning taxi (don't bother if the light is not on).

* limos4helsinki.com is luxury and VIP taxi service. It has diverse fleet of luxurious cars, limousines, shuttles, minibuses and buses that can be used for transfers of a single or multiple number of persons.

* Uber Uber is available in Helsinki region. The service is legal, if the driver has a taxi license. The car doesn't necessarily have to have a taxi livery or a taxi sign on the ceiling, a driver-specific license is enough. Some drivers don't have a required licence to operate, but there is no sanctions against customer in such a case.

By Baana
Baana - Helsinki's new "Low Line" (as opposed to NYC's High Line) opened on June 12, 2012, providing pedestrians and cyclists with a 1.3 km long connector between the Western Harbour area to Kamppi and Töölö Bay. At the Harbour end, you can visit free sightseeing terrace with MiG-21BIS fighter jet on display - located at Verkkokauppa.com's electronics store. There's also a huge, 8.5 m tall Bad Bad Boy -statue located adjacent to Western Harbor and Verkkokauppa.com. On the Kamppi end, there's bicycle hire centre and cultural activities and sights.

By bike
Helsinki's City bike system was relaunched in May 2016. The system spans most of the city area and also the neighbouring to the west, but is not compatible with the city bikes in . The registration fee is &euro;5/day, &euro;10/week or &euro;35/season (April–October) with the first 30 minutes of each trip included. If you do not return the bike within 30 minutes, a small fee will be debited from your credit card. If you do not return the bike within 4 hours, a large penalty fee of €80 will be debited. Be sure to find a bike rack for city bikes in time. 

If you bring your own bike or rent one, you'll find an extensive network of bike routes within the city. Bikers are required by law to drive on the street next to cars unless a bike lane or integrated pedestrian/cyclists sidewalk runs next to it, and the police ticket cyclists breaking this rule. Bike lanes are clearly marked by street markings and blue traffic signs. Biking is also allowed on pedestrian streets.

Downtown bike lanes are typically on the sidewalks (instead of next to car lanes on the street) so be aware of pedestrians. Don't be afraid to ring your bell! Review your bike map carefully, as some bike routes will stop and require you to walk your bike or drive next to cars. There is also a journey planner for cycling Once you get out of the city centre, cycling is less complicated.

Public libraries often have free stocks of biking maps in Helsinki Metropolitan Area, so when they are not visible on tables it would be better to ask the map from the library staff.

If an ordinary bike isn't enough for you, you can also rent a cyclerickshaw (riksa) large enough for three from Riksavuokraus (tel. +358-50-5582525) in Eiranranta near Kaivopuisto. Prices start at &euro;9/30 min, driver not included but available on request.

Pyöräpaja offers bicycle fixing help free of charge. True bike enthusiasts can even assemble their own bikes there. Pyöräpaja also sells bikes for quite cheap prices. (Facebook page: 

By electronic vehicles

Bond Mobility offers eletric bikes that can go 45 km/h if you opt to use the electric assistance. A driver's license for mopeds, motorcycles or cars is needed. Lime offers electric scooters. 

By car
Car rental is not a particularly good way of getting around Helsinki, since parking is limited and expensive. Most street-side parking in the city center is in "Zone 1" and costs &euro;4/hour during working hours, although Saturdays (mostly) and Sundays (always) are free. There are also several large underground parking garages at Kamppi and Forum.

See

Surrounded by sea and a vast archipelago, Helsinki is at its best in the summer when the dialogue between the city and nature is at its fullest. Classical Helsinki's sights can be divided into an eclectic set of churches and a wide variety of museums. For a coastal amble past some of Helsinki's minor and major sights, see the itinerary .

If you have a short amount of time in Helsinki, you may wish to follow the recommended , which begin at the Saarinen-designed Central Railway Station and move on to the Senate Square and the Lutheran Cathedral, the Uspenski Othrodox Cathedral, Market Square, and beyond.

Suomenlinna

If you see only one place in Helsinki in the summer, you could make it Suomenlinna The "Gibraltar of the North" was once the greatest sea fortress in the Baltic, built by the Swedish in the mid-1700s at great expense to protect their eastern flank. But when the Russians invaded in February 1808, the bulk of the unprepared and bankrupt Swedish army hastily withdrew, allowing the Russians to conquer Helsinki without a fight and besiege the fortress. With no reinforcements in sight, commander Carl Olof Cronstedt surrendered unconditionally two months later, and Finland was ceded to the Russians. Cronstedt's actions probably saved countless civilian lives, but King Gustav IV needed a scapegoat and sentenced him to death for treason; fortunately, the losing king was himself soon overthrown, and Cronstedt lived out his years gardening.

Today's Suomenlinna is still living in its own time with only old buildings, few cars, fewer than a thousand inhabitants and lots of old fortifications, catacombs and cast iron cannons. But it's not just a museum: the sprawling complex houses restaurants, cafes, theaters and museums, and is a very popular place for a picnic on a fine summer day, watching the vast passenger ferries drift by on their way to Estonia and St Petersburg. It was included in UNESCO’s in 1991 as a unique monument to European military architecture.

Entry to the island itself is free, but you need to pay for the ferry ride. The HSL ferry from Market Square is the cheapest and most convenient way of getting there. The ferry is a part of the Helsinki local traffic, so if you have an HSL Day Ticket it includes ferry travel. The ferry runs approximately every half hour and the trip takes about 15 minutes. You can also use the normal single-HSL tickets, you can transfer to the ferry if validated within the transfer time window. There is also a special &euro;5, 12-hour tourist return ticket. On summer weekends the island is a popular picnic destination and you may have to wait for a long time as hundreds of people crowd the ferry terminal. In this case it may be worth it to use the more expensive private ferry company at the other end of the Market Square.

Guided tours of the island in English are available daily at 11AM, 12:30PM and 2:30PM in Jun-Aug and on Sat/Sun only at 1:30PM the rest of the year, &euro;11/person, and history buffs will want to drop into the Suomenlinna Museum at the Visitor Centre (&euro;7).

Other islands

A beautiful archipelago (saaristo) surrounds the Helsinki city center. In addition to the major islands listed below, there are scheduled services to many smaller islands, and you can also tour them by sightseeing cruise. Most of the cruises depart from the .Western corner of the Market Square and last from one to several hours. Note most ferries and cruises operate only in the summer high season.

*Seurasaari Open Air Museum, A pleasant little island to the north of the center, filled with walking trails and authentic old Finnish houses collected from all over the country. An excellent half-day trip, especially in the summer, when many buildings have guides practising crafts in traditional dress. There's a very pleasant if somewhat pricy summer cafe/restaurant atop a small hill at the center of the island. Entry to the park free, entry into the museum buildings costs &euro;9 (&euro;6 concession), buy tickets at entrance. Take bus 24 from Erottaja at the northern end of Esplanadi to the terminus (20-30 minutes), then walk across the bridge. Beware of mercenary squirrels that will raid your bags if you carry any food.

*Pihlajasaari, Few tourists find their way here, but this is a very popular summer spot for Helsinkians, with sandy beaches (including a mixed nude beach) and a restaurant dishing out cold beer and ciders. Ferries run from Merisatama pier at the southern end of Kaivopuisto Park (tram 3B) hourly from 9:30AM to 8:30PM, 10-15 min, &euro;5.50 return.

*Korkeasaari, An island in central Helsinki best known for Helsinki Zoo, with about 200 species of animals. Connected to the mainland by bridge (bus 16 from Central Railway Station), in summer you can also opt for a 15-min ferry ride from Hakaniemi and Market Square. Entry to the zoo &euro;23/16 adult/child.

*Vallisaari, An old fortress island next to Suomenlinna, opened to the public in May 2016. Visitors can explore the fortifications and nature. Access by ferry from Market Square, 20-30 min (with stop at Suomenlinna on the way back), &euro;7 return.

Parks

*Esplanadi Park. Located between Market Square (Kauppatori) and the two Esplanadi boulevards, this small but stately park has a commanding position at the heart of the city. In the summer time it is full of people sitting on the lawn, meeting their friends and quite often also having a drink or two. In the summer there are often free concerts given by local artists on the stage close to Kauppatori, facing restaurant Kappeli. If you're walking around with an ice cream or sandwich, do watch out for the aggressive birds.

*Kaivopuisto. A beautiful park by the sea in the southernmost part of the city. In summer you might want to sit down for a cup of coffee in one of the seaside cafes and enjoy the view of sailboats and the people on the promenade. Housing surrounding this area is the most expensive in Helsinki.

* Töölönlahti. Located northwest from the central railway station, this is a bay surrounded by a nice park that is dotted with attractions such as the Finlandia Concert Hall and the National Opera. Töölönlahti is partly in a natural state which is quite rare in major cities. Walking and jogging around the bay is a popular outdoor activity.

*Sinebrychoffin puisto. Also known as "Koffin puisto", located in Punavuori district next to the Sinebrychoff art museum. Popular with young people, in the summer it is full of people having picnics or just drinking pussikalja (literally: "beer in a bag", means buying beer from a supermarket and drinking it outdoors), while in the winter kids ride sleds down the snowy slope. 

*Central Park (Keskuspuisto). This is a huge park starting just north of the Olympic Stadium and extending northwards for 10 km. It encompasses an area of over 1,000 hectares.

A popular jogging area.

*Alppipuisto Located on the west side of the Linnanmäki amusement park, this beautiful park is a hidden gem during the summer due to the many free concerts and other events that are held there throughout the summer months.

*Lauttasaari. Park on the southern tip of Lauttasaari, west of downtown Helsinki. Wooded with walking trails. You'd never know that a bustling metropolis was just a few kilometers away.

*Karhupuisto. A great place to sit down and drink a few beers on a summer day. The park is located in the middle of the hip Kallio district.

Churches
If you are limited in time, the three must-see churches in Helsinki can be remembered as Red, White, and Rock. In other words, the red Uspenski Cathedral, the white Lutheran Cathedral, and the Church in the Rock.

*Lutheran Cathedral (Tuomiokirkko). Aleksanterinkatu, The unofficial symbol of the city, this striking white cathedral dominates the central Senate Square. Based on designs by Carl Ludvig Engel and completed in 1852, the cathedral has recently been refurbished and looks better than ever, with the 12 apostles on the roof once again looking down at the world below. Open daily, Sep-May 9AM-6PM, Jun-Aug 9AM-midnight. Free.

*The Church in the Rock (Temppeliaukion kirkko, literally "Temple Square Church"). Lutherinkatu 3 (tram 2), An atmospheric if minimalistic church, this church was literally dug out of solid rock.

Concerts are often held here thanks to the excellent acoustics. 10AM-5PM daily. 3€, under 18 free. Beware of busloads of obnoxious tourist groups making lots of noise even during performances. English services on Sundays at 2PM, open to the public.

*Uspenski Cathedral (Uspenskin katedraali). Kanavakatu 1, A classical onion-domed Russian church prominently located near the Market Square, Uspenski Cathedral serves Finland's small Orthodox minority and is the largest Orthodox church in Western Europe. The name comes from the Russian uspenie, from the Dormition (death) of the Virgin Mary. The five domes are topped with 22-carat gold, and some of the icons within are held to be miraculous. Open Tu-F 9:30AM-4PM, Sat 9:30AM-2PM, Su 12PM-3PM. May-Sep Mon,Wed, Sat 9:30AM-4PM, Tue 9:30AM-6PM, Sun 12PM-3PM. Free.

*Old Church of Helsinki (Helsingin vanha kirkko), Lönnrotinkatu 6, and Old Church Park (Vanha kirkkopuisto). The oldest existing church in central Helsinki, designed by Carl Ludvig Engel, built between 1824 and 1826. Originally planned as a temporary building before Lutheran Cathedral would be completed in 1852, but remained in use due to the rapid population growth from the early 19th century onwards. The park is sometimes colloquially called Ruttopuisto (Plague Park) as over a thousand victims of the 1710 plague are buried next to the park. The park itself was a cemetery from the 1780s until shortly after the church's construction. Its use as a graveyard was discontinued in 1829, although some victims of the Finnish Civil War and fallen Finnish volunteers of the Estonian War of Independence were buried there in 1918 and 1919, respectively. Some 40 gravestones and memorials, as well as the Johan Sederholm's tomb remain of the cemetery.

Places of Worship
*United Community Church (UCC). Annankatu 7, International, bible-based and nondenominational church that welcomes both Finns and foreigners to attend. Services in Helsinki and Espoo on Sundays. Free. There are several mosques in Helsinki, the largest one being Suomen Islamilainen Yhdyskunta. A Grand Mosque was planned to be built, but was later scrapped.

Museums and galleries

Many of Helsinki's museums are as interesting from the outside as from the inside. Architecture buffs will get a kick out of Helsinki's Neo-Classical center, centered around Senate Square (Senaatintori), where a statue of the liberal Russian czar Alexander II stands guard. Aleksanterinkatu and the Railway Station square also have some beautiful neo-classical buildings &mdash; look out for the Romantic Kalevala-esque themes &mdash.

Luckily, several film festivals enrich the cinema culture in Helsinki region. The biggest is the Helsinki International Film Festival - Love and Anarchy held annually in September. Espoo has its own international film festival Espoo Ciné held every August in Tapiola and Leppävaara. In January, Helsinki Documentary Film Festival Docpoint takes over. Some of the smaller film festivals include (to name few) Lens Politica showing political films and art, Season Film Festival concentrating on films of and by women, and Night Visions focusing on horror, fantasy, science fiction, action and cult cinema. Cinemania website collects at least some of the festivals together.

Most films in Finland are shown in the original language with Finnish and Swedish subtitles. The only exception is children's films (usually animations) which might be dubbed in Finnish.

Festivals

Helsinki's celebrations are among the most exciting in the country.
* Lux Helsinki, beginning of January. Lux Helsinki is an annual event comprising of light installations to cheer residents' and visitors' minds during the darkest time of the year. They are on display over several nights. Lux Helsinki can also be enjoyed as part of a guided walking tour.
* Vappu (Walpurgis Night), Apr 30-May 1. Originally a north European pagan carnival, Vappu is an excuse for students to wear brightly colored overalls and for everybody to drink vast amounts of alcohol. At 6PM on Apr 30, the statue of Havis Amanda at the Market Square is crowned with a student's cap and the revelry begins in the streets. Things can get a little ugly outside as the night wears on, so it's wiser to head indoors to the bars, clubs and restaurants, all of which have massive Vappu parties. The following morning, the party heads to the Kaivopuisto park for a champagne picnic, regardless of the weather. If the weather is good, up to 70,000 people will show up. Left-wing parties hold rallies and speeches (Labor Day, May 1), but the event is increasingly non-political.
* Helsinki-päivä (Helsinki Day), Jun 12. This is the birthday of the city. It traditionally starts with the mayor's morning coffee and is celebrated throughout the day with a variety of concerts, performances, exhibitions and guided tours around the city. 
* Juhannus (Midsummer Festival), Friday between Jun 19 and Jun 25. Although a large bonfire is lit in Seurasaari, the celebration is low key as the tradition is to celebrate "the nightless night" at summer cottages in the countryside. Although some celebrate Juhannus in Helsinki as well, the streets are often eerily empty and the doors of the shops closed.
* Tuska Open Air, An annual, 3-day heavy metal festival, featuring acts from all over the world, held in June.
* Flow Festival, Annual 3-day urban and electronic music festival, held in mid-August at Suvilahti. Noted for its high-end arrangements marrying music to design and gourmet food, Flow has expanded to include installations, arts and workshops in the past few years.
* Taiteiden Yö (Night of the Arts), near the end of Aug. The peak of the multi-week Helsinki Festival called "little vappu" by many as the streets are full of revelers. The official event is marked by performing arts through the night. The Night of the Arts was originally organized by local bookstores in the 1990s. It's now organized by the city. During the last few years, the event has slightly returned to its origin as an arts and culture event.
*Outsider Art Festival, music, visual and performing art, film and literature festival, presenting artists beyond bareers, it's accommpanied by live concerts, mid-end of August.
* Helsinki International Film Festival, Also known as Rakkautta & Anarkiaa (Love & Anarchy) and held annually in September, HIFF features a wide selection of films from all over the world. Asian films have been a special focus in the history of the festival that is celebrating its 25th anniversary in 2012.
* Joulu (Christmas). In the weeks before Christmas, Aleksanterinkatu is festively lit up (starting on the last Sunday of November) and the Esplanadi hosts an open-air Christmas market. But Christmas itself is a family event, so on the 24th, everything shuts down and stays closed until December 26th.

Buy
Shopping in Helsinki is generally expensive, but fans of Finnish and Nordic design will find plenty of things of interest. From the beginning of 2016, the shopping hours have been freed from regulation, meaning that each shop can decide for themselves. Thus the opening hours should be checked in advance as there is and will be more and more variation. Most large shops and department stores have been open weekdays from 9AM to 9PM. As in the rest of Finland, most shops close by 6PM on Saturday and Sunday (as of 2010 all shops are allowed to open every Sunday between noon and 6PM). A notable exception is the Asematunneli complex, located underground adjacent to the Central Railway Station, most shops here are open until 10PM almost every day of the year. 

Grocery stores K-Supermarket and Lidl in the Kamppi Center (see below) and the S-Market supermarket below Sokos, next to the railway station, are open every day until 10PM.

* Left Shoe Company, Southern Esplanade (also inside Stockmann), step on a high tech gadget that measures your foot and then choose what sort of shoe you would like to wear. Get the tailored shoe sent home by post. Only mens shoes. Prices start at around 200 euros and depend on the materials used.
* Varusteleka, Ruosilantie 2, a bit outside the center but reachable by public transport, this shop deals in army surplus stuff and has probably the friendliest and knowledgeable staff you'll find in Finland. Varusteleka sells anything from thirties Nazi leather trench coats to very good value-for-money modern gore-tex hiking coats that some army somewhere had too many of.

Eat

Helsinki has by far the best cosmopolitan restaurants in Finland, and is a good place to escape the usual diet of meat and potatoes. As usual in Finland the best time to eat out is lunch, when most restaurants offer lunch specials for around €10. Lunch are typically served from 10:30AM to 2PM, but the times vary.

A surprisingly large number of restaurants close down for a month or more in summer (July-August), so call ahead to avoid disappointment.

Budget
Budget choices are largely limited to fast food, although there are a couple of workaday Finnish eateries in the mix. In addition to McDonald's and its Finnish imitators Hesburger/Carrols, Helsinki is also full of pizza and kebab places, where a meal typically costs around €7-8 (sometimes as low as €4-5, especially in Kallio). A more healthy option is Unicafe a chain of restaurants owned by the Helsinki University student union, which has around 10 outlets in central Helsinki and offers full meals from €5.70, including vegetarian options. Lunch restaurants and lists in Helsinki can be found at lounasmenu.fi.

* Cheap groceries, In shops and online List of the cheapest places where to buy food in Helsinki.

* Chilli, Keskuskatu 6 (and other outlets around town). Cheap kebab, shawarma, and falafel. Large portions, though be warned that this isn't your traditional Middle Eastern fare. Pitas come with something akin to spaghetti sauce inside. Filling choice, especially on a budget.

The daily Lunch Club menu consists of four different choices all for 9,20€. There is choice of Scandinavian style home-cooking, Mediterranean or Asian delicacies, salad bar and soup of the day or vegetarian meal.
* Fredan Murkina, Fredrikinkatu 16, Very simple and inexpensive lunch place, no gourmet-stuff going on here, but the sort of food Finns eat at home made fresh on site.

International
Central Helsinki is dominated by restaurants dedicated to international cuisine, and these are particularly useful for vegetarian visitors, Finnish food being largely meat-based. A particular touch is provided by a bunch of "Nepalese" restaurants, which also serve generic north Indian food, but almost any of which you are guaranteed to leave happy and full. Localized Chinese and Italian cuisines are also well represented.

Splurge
Two classes of fine dining stand out in Helsinki: fresh seafood and Russian. During the dark days of the Soviet Union, it was sometimes said that the best Russian restaurants in the world were across the border in Helsinki. For something authentically Finnish and uniquely Helsinki, try Vorschmack, an unusual but surprisingly tasty mix of minced lamb and herring, served with chopped pickles and sour cream (smetana).

Drink
Helsinki has plenty of hip places for a drink. The main nightlife districts, all in the city center within crawling distance of each other, are around Iso-Roobertinkatu, the Central Railway Station and Kamppi. Helsinki's busy gay nightlife is centered mostly around Iso-Roobertinkatu and Eerikinkatu and surrounding streets.

Going out is not cheap, and complaining about the prices is a popular Finnish pastime, but compared to (say) London or New York City the prices aren't that bad. If you are on a budget and intent on getting plastered, follow the Finns and drink up a good "base" at home or hotel before going out on town. Alternatively, you can start the night outside the city centre area and head to the district of Kallio where bar prices are significantly lower. Popular places include Heinähattu, Roskapankki, Iltakoulu, Bar Molotow and Lepakkomies but there are lots more to choose from, just walk along Helsinginkatu or Vaasankatu. You can reach Kallio from the center by walking, by tram (lines 1, 3B, 6 or 7B) or by metro (get off at Hakaniemi and walk uphill, or Sörnäinen, and head west). Most bars close their doors between 2AM and 5AM, in city centre there are many that are open until 5AM. Kallio is usually considered as 'party starting district' but it's also common for locals to spend the whole night in Kallio, changing bar every now and then. The Kallio area is generally a bit rougher than the rest of the city and is as close as Helsinki gets to a red light district. However, it is a lot more tame than most 'such parts of town' in Europe. You will be fine there at any hour as long as you look out not to get in between a fight of two drunkards about who the remaining vodka belongs to.

Note that, while entry to bars and clubs is often (but not always) free, in club-type places and proper restaurants you must use and pay for the coat check (narikka), usually around &euro;2, if you're wearing anything more than a T-shirt. In some places you must pay even if you don't leave anything at the cloakroom. The bouncer will be very strict with this as the much of the narikka-money goes into his pocket. If a ticket price is advertised, it usually does not cover the coat check.

The drinking age is 18, and this is rather strictly enforced, so bring along ID. Underaged drinking is still a huge problem, and many bars and clubs apply house limits of 20-24 years, but these are enforced less strictly and a patron of younger age will some times be let in if one fits the clientele, especially women.

Information on clubs and live performances can be found in free, Finnish-language tabloids such as City which can be picked up at many bars, cafes and shops.
Cafes
Finland is the largest coffee consuming nation per capita and coffee breaks are written into law. However, in Finland most coffee is filter-brewed from a light, more caffeinated, roast that is quite different to what the rest of the world drinks. Finns often enjoy a bun (pulla) or cinnamon bun (korvapuusti) with their coffee. Finland also has international coffee chains like Starbucks. There are 3 locations in Helsinki: one in airport, other two located in downtown Helsinki (Academic bookstore and Kamppi shopping mall)

In Finland commonly espressos and lattes are called "special coffees" and a large number of establishments that make such coffees have popped up all over town ever since the nineties when they arrived. One which will give any Italian cafeteria a go for their money is La Torrefazione next to Stockmann. In the more common cafeterias the normal light brew coffee is sold by self service at the counter even at some more expensive cafeterias (there is only a handful of cafeterias serving to the table in Helsinki - this shows how commonplace coffee drinking is considered).

*Cafe DaJa, Mariankatu 13 B (in the beautiful Kruununhaka district, 5 minutes from the Dom). One of the best Cafes in Helsinki with a german Kaffee Kultur. Very relaxed, excellent service, a awesome breakfast buffet every day and the best Flammkuchen in Town.

* Bar Molotow, Vaasankatu 29, Small and always cozy indie/alternative/electro/goth rock bar. Nice summer terrace. Located in Kallio/harju district. 

* Baker's, Mannerheimintie 12, Nowadays a part of a huge sports bar, called O'Learys. A great place to start up your party. From Tues to Sat they have a sparkling wine happy hour from 5PM: for 100 minutes, a glass of cava costs 100 cents (that's one euro). The service might be somewhat rough. Also lots of young people there on weekends. Has a bar, nightclub, pub and serves also food.

* Black Door, Iso Roobertinkatu 1, English pub. Weekdays are relaxed, weekends have live DJs and a full bar. A place to go for quality beers, ales, ciders and whisky.

*In a nice old granite house called Graniittilinna you'll find (probably) Helsinki's oldest still operational pub, Juttutupa. Juttutupa is housed in the "workers house" and has historically been the Bar of the policial left. In fact, while Lenin was hiding out in Finland planning the upcoming Russian revolution he was known to frequent Juttutupa, where the table he used to sit at is kept in his memory (the one in the back with a good view of the entrance). On Wednesdays there are often free Jazz concerts. Juttutupa also serves food from the neighboring restaurant's kitchen.

* Erottaja Bar, Erottajankatu 15-17, tel. +358 9 611 196. A small, consciously crude bar, that formerly was known as one of the primary hipster hangouts in central Helsinki. The bar is now all but deserted by the trendy crowd, and the music turned into the usual fare of hit-list pop, but on the upside the service is friendly and there is ample sitting room at the tables. 

* Korjaamo, Töölönkatu 51, tel. +358 9 4540 117, One of the best places to hang out at summer, nice terrace, two floor laid back bar with life DJ's in the evening and cafe in the building of the Korjaamo Cultural Factory.

* Loose, Annankatu 21, A very street-credible rock bar, it is highly popular among Finnish rock musicians.

*Probably the best beer selection in town or even entire Finland with around 30 taps and some 200 different bottled beers. All the British, Belgian and German favourites and some Finnish craft brews. Also one of the more expensive places to grab your pint.

* On The Rocks, Mikonkatu 15 (near Central Railway Station), Located next to Baarikärpänen and Texas, this is a rock-oriented bar with occasional live bands and stand up comedy acts. Minimum age 23.

* Pikkulintu, Klaavuntie 11, Multiple award-winner for "Best Finnish Beer Pub", 20+ taps from Finnish and Nordic microbreweries. Although bizarrely located in a sleepy suburb, it is easily accessible by metro: take the Vuosaari line and stop at Puotila. Take the "Puotilan metrotori" exit and walk forward a couple of blocks. 

* Siltanen, Hämeentie 13, A popular hipster haunt from the owners of the next door Kuudes Linja club venue (see below). Part bar, part club and part café (with food served until 10PM) with a big terrace and weird décor. Open 11AM-2AM daily, with DJs and the occasional live gig in the evenings. Weekend DJ brunch noon-4PM, prepare to wait for a table though.

*Sports Academy, Kaivokatu 8, One of the best sports bars in Helsinki, and definitely the place for you if you are keen about football (soccer) or ice-hockey. A two-story building just opposite the railway station, filled to the rim with TV sets and several giant projectors. A variety of pub food also served - try the crayfish pasta or the ribs. There can be long queues before popular events - get in early!

*You'll find various types of beer in this little bar. It's been here in various forms since 1937, and after its most recent transformation it is one of the prettiest bars in Kallio.

*Vanha ylioppilastalo (usually just Vanha), Mannerheimintie 3, A bar/café just opposite Stockmann, owned by University of Helsinki's filthy rich students' union. Not very special in the winter, but the rooftop patio in the summer is nice. In the evenings, the club attracts a slighly-over-18 audience.

*Storyville, Museokatu 8, Helsinki, By and in a small park right next to the Parliament House, this prize-winning blues/roots/jazz-oriented bar/restaurant is an established classic of it's genre. Free admission to live performances in the garden during the warm season (starting time from 7 p.m. except on Sundays from 3 p.m.), sometimes entrance fee to late night gigs indoors. Typically quite mature clientele.

Nightclubs
 
In Helsinki, the most popular nightclubs have long queues starting to form around 11:30PM. Get in early to avoid standing, although it can be a nice way to meet people. After around 1:00-2:00AM it might be impossible to get in anymore. You may try to just walk past the queue looking important, but a more efficient strategy is to discreetly tip the bouncer (&euro;10-20). The larger group you are, the more difficult things get. Look smart!

*Cuba, Erottajankatu 4, A night club with a somewhat more "Latin" touch and softer tunes. Clientele mostly trendy young adults. Open until 4AM, often hosts student parties on weekday nights. No entrance fee.

*DTM, Mannerheimintie 6 B, Open M-Su 21:00-04:00. Formerly "Don't Tell Mama", DTM is the largest combination of gay cafe, bar, disco and nightclub in Scandinavia. Popular among many celebrities. Straights usually welcome, too, as long as they don't "take over" the place. Entrance &euro;7-10 (Sat and special nights only).

*Hercules Gay Night Club, Pohjoinen Rautatiekatu 21 B, One of the busiest gay nightclubs in Scandinavia, targets a 30+ clientele, good for bare-faced cruising. Entrance free; coat check €2.50.

*Vatican, Simonkatu 6. Vatican (former Jenny Woo) tries to profile itself as a nightclub for trendy young adults. You can lie on couches next to the crowded dance floor while sipping some bubbly.

* Kaarle XII, Kasarmikatu 40, tel. +358 9 6129990, A Helsinki institution better known as Kalle, this former church hasn't had a renovation in years and really needs one. It still continues to pack in a hard-partying thirtysomething crowd, especially on Thursdays. No less than six different bars (all small), playing top 40 tunes, rock and Finnish pop. The last of the bars has a dancefloor and gets particularly packed, with people dancing on the tables. Minimum age 24. Open Th-Sa 10PM-4AM. 

*Kaiku, Kaikukatu 4 (in the inner court), Techno and house by local DJs and international guests in an old factory building. Part of the same complex as Kuudes linja and Siltanen. Long queues on popular nights but it's usually worth it: Kaiku was listed among the 25 best clubs in Europe by Guardian Tickets €8-15 (often free if you arrive early). Open F-Sa 10PM-4AM.

*Kuudes linja, Hämeentie 13 (entrance from the inner court at Kaikukatu 4), A live music oriented nightclub for the somewhat artsy crowd next to Kaiku. Located a 10 min tram/bus ride away in the Kallio district, Kuudes linja usually offers more experimental/alternative music than the mainstream downtown clubs and also hosts electronic music parties. Arrive early to avoid queues on popular nights &mdash; admittance is not guaranteed once the place gets full. The weatherproof terrace in the courtyard is open during the summer. Club open W, F, Sa 10PM-4AM, Th 9PM–4AM.

*Tavastia/Semifinal, Urho Kekkosen katu 4-6, One of the most prominent rock clubs in Scandinavia, a must see for fans of live rock of any kind. Semifinal has smaller indie/alternative bands for a young crowd. On special nights the two clubs are joined, but usually they host separate gigs. Tickets for all gigs can be bought in advance from the Tiketti ticket sellers next door. The annual Tavastia new year party is an institution in itself, with fans flying from all over the world for the show.

*Teatteri, Pohjoisesplanadi 2, A complex featuring a deli, a restaurant, a bar and a night club, all of them trendy and popular among the well-dressed crowd. Check out the aptly named Clock Bar (Kellobaari) downstairs. Closed Sun.

*Ääniwalli, Pälkäneentie 13, A hip club focusing on electronic music. Underground vibes.

Sleep

Accommodation is generally quite expensive, but of a high standard. Hotels are usually cheaper on weekends, when business travelers are away. In a real pinch, it may actually be (far) cheaper to book a "last-minute" or "red-ticket" return cabin (from around Euro 20) on an overnight cruise to Tallinn, and spend the night (and part of the next day) on the boat, rather than sleep in the city.

Budget
There are quite a few budget hotels in Helsinki, the cheapest being youth hostels. Many student dormitories turn into youth hostels during the July-August school break, which happily coincides with peak season for tourists. The Finnish Youth Hostel Association can provide further information.

* Hotel GLO is situated in the centre of Helsinki, between Alexanterinkatu and Pohjois Esplanadi.The hotel has a direct entrance to the shopping centre Kämp Galleria.

Stay safe

The crime rate in Helsinki has been traditionally generally low, although locals grumble that things have gotten worse since the EU removed restrictions on movement. In the 2020's, there has been some concern regarding occasional appearance of youth groups who force other teens to hand over their mobile phone or luxury brand clothes. Pickpockets target crowds and bicycles are prone to petty theft. Walking in the streets after dark is generally safe and the city center is indeed quite lively until the early hours of the morning. However, it's best to steer clear of obviously drunk people looking to pick a fight, the traditional trouble spots being the frustratingly long queues for late night snack food or taxis. Getting mugged for money in the streets of central Helsinki is almost unheard of, but you might not want to get into any unlicensed taxis even though the licensed ones are almost always way short of demand during pre-Christmas and summer seasons. A licensed taxi in Finland will always have a yellow box with its number on the roof.

A new failed taxi law (2018) eliminated previous restrictions. There is no limitation anymore how much a driver can ask for a drive or who can offer a taxi drive. So make sure that driver has the meter on or negotiate the price before entering into vehicle. Taksi Helsinki is one of the most regular and safe companies (but beware as there are many copycats for them). 

The most crimes in city center concentrate around central railway station and Kamppi shopping center. The Kaisaniemi park behind the main Railway Station is possibly best avoided at night, and some parts of Kallio and Sörnäinen (northeast from the center, after the Pitkäsilta bridge) may be somewhat rougher than other parts of the downtown; Vaasanaukio area at the crossroads of Hämeentie and Helsinginkatu may be the most likely place in the city where substance abuse is visible regardless of the hour of the day. Also certain economically deprived neighborhoods in Eastern Helsinki should rather be avoided at night time.

Finnish police never require a cash payment of fines which it gives. Never give money to a person who presents him/herself as a police officer. Ask the police officer to show his/her badge. Do not try to bribe a local authorities - it is illegal, and in any case, there's no such culture it could succeed.

There are no dangerous animals or stray dog problem in Helsinki. Swimming in the sea may be harmful after long period of summer temperature, usually late in the summer, when irritating and mildly toxic green algae renders some beaches unusable. Observe warnings and/or ask locals.

In winter, try to keep a steady footing: despite the use of vast quantities of gravel and salt, pavements can be quite slippery when the temperature hovers around zero and near-invisible black ice forms. Also especially in spring watch out for snow falling from the roofs of the buildings. After several injuries and even a few deaths, real property owners are now busy keeping the roofs clear of snow 

Every spring a few hundred Roma beggars from Romania and Bulgaria arrive in Helsinki to stay for the summer. This phenomenon exists in many European cities, but is particularly ample in Helsinki due to the fact that there are virtually no local beggars. For years these beggars were considered to be organized crime, but in the summer of 2013 the Finnish police stated that no such links exist In some cases these beggars can become aggressive, but mostly they just beg on the sidewalk. Some of the Roma people walk around and collect bottles to get funds from reverse vending machines and in the mean time beg money from the people and try to pull scams and do pick-pocketing at the same time. So whenever these Roma people come to talk to you or come close to you, it is best to shout them loud "NO!". Now a days many Roma beggars stay in Finland during the winter and pull scams especially in front of the Kamppi Shopping mall E-entrance doors, so please be on alert all the time!

Helsinki's bedrock is close to the surface, so new building works invariably involve some dynamite to build foundations, and it's thus quite common to hear explosions around the center. Blasting is often preceded by a loud sequence of warning beeps, which speed up as they count down. There is no danger to anyone, as the builders are experts (and the solid granite bedrock is very, very strong), but now you know where that "BOOM!" came from.

If you are just passing through and choose Helsinki to apply for a Russian visa, be careful when choosing a travel agency: some may charge a lot extra for "express service" (although applying for one yourself at the consulate will take weeks).

Respect

* As with many cities, when using escalators, people in Helsinki usually reserve the right-hand side for standing and the left-hand side for people walking up/down.

* Let people exit trams, trains and buses before boarding yourself.

* Avoid walking on the cycle lane. Dedicated cycle paths are clearly marked, but sometimes run directly next to the sidewalk. Helsinki cyclists are subject to a comparatively hilly landscape and are unwilling to slow down and lose momentum. Usually, however, they are careful, signal clearly and use their bells, meaning that straying tourists most often are just sworn at, although you are free to swear back at them.

* When waiting in lines, be patient and polite. Finns never jump queues so make sure you do not move and stand still in the line. 

* Finns usually don't address people who are doing things (in their opinion) wrong. They will just look at your foolish behavior, laugh silently to themselves and swear secretly behind you, but it is not unusual to hear nasty comments from strangers if you do things wrong, like ride a bicycle on a sidewalk.

* Do not feed gulls or pigeons (especially in the city center). It is officially prohibited in many areas and even if not, locals will get irritated seeing someone throw anything edible to "flying rats", and again (you guessed it), they will swear at you.

* If you travel with a pet, keep it in leash at all times when at public places, and request if pets are allowed inside before entering restaurants, etc. - Finns can be quite offended regarding using your own judgement liberally in these matters compared to continental Europe. 

* See also the relevant paragraph in the article.

Contact
Much of Helsinki is blanketed with wifi ("wlan") hotspots, and the City of Helsinki maintains a handy map By comparison, Internet cafes with shared PCs are few and far between in Helsinki.

* Library 10, Elielinaukio 2 G, tel. +358 9 3108 5000, A public Internet and music library located in the main post office building at the western side of the central railway station. You can surf the Internet for free for 30 minutes on the library's computers , but you're going to have to queue. Also has wi-fi, but you need a library card to access the network.

*Mbar, Mannerheimintie 22-24 (Lasipalatsi), tel. +358 9 612 4542, A pleasant and popular living room-ish space in the heart of the city with local DJs playing drum & bass, house and chillout beats. Computers with Internet access (&euro;5 per hour; &euro;2 minimum charge), free wifi for laptop & cell phone owners. The terrace is a popular hipster hangout in the summer, situated in the former bus station area just next to the bar. Drinks &euro;4-5.

Many internet/cyber cafes in Finland can be expensive. There are a large number of locations in Helsinki that offer free public wifi for those needing to connect to the office while outside of the country. Most cafes offer these services without requiring a person to be a paying customer. Some restaurants will do this as well, but may insist that you purchase something. There is a list of the free wifi locations compiled online
