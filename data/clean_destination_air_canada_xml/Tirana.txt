Tirana is the capital of . 

Understand

Sulejman Pasha Bargjini, a native feudal lord from Mullet, established the city in 1614. His first constructions were a mosque, a bakery and a hamam (Turkish bath). On February 8, 1920 Tirana was made the temporary capital by the Congress of Lushnje, and it was proclaimed the permanent capital on December 31, 1925.

Albania spent the majority of the last 50 years under a strict and isolationist Dictator, Enver Hoxha. Upon his death, the country moved towards a free market economic model, with mixed results. Presently, Tirana is where the old and new Albania meet. Unpaved streets host brand new Land Rovers, iPhone-toting youngsters rub shoulders with street vendors peddling all manners of items, and gleaming glass towers look down on abandoned construction projects. 

Tourists usually find Tirana a beautiful and charming city, where cosmopolitan and small town feelings are intertwined with a lively night life. However, Tirana suffers from pollution problems mainly due to the rapid increase in cars in the city and continuous construction. Long gone are the days when Tirana used to be subject to power outages almost daily and this made Tirana a noisy city as the lack of power and lack of traffic lights had cars navigating by honking their horns.

Today the situation has dramatically improved regarding power outages. Tirana is undergoing a major renovation from its communist days. Many of the ugly dull buildings have been repainted, but a lot of work still needs to be done. English is rapidly gaining steam as the second language of the city with the youth but many older residents also speak Italian.

Albanians are very hospitable towards foreigners, despite media frequently portraying them as thieves and mobsters. Tirana itself is very approachable if you're the adventurous type - crime is rare, if ever directed towards foreigners and the costs are very low by regional standards. The worst experience you may have is with erratic driving style of Albanians. 

The main business and entertainment area (not by coincidence) has become "The Block" (Blloku) which is the area where in the past, the communist leaders used to live under strict protection. Locals prefer to hang out at the many cafes and main parks. Tirana is a youthful and lively town resonating constant energy. A popular retreat is by cable car to Mount Dajti where one can get a panoramic view of the city from above.

A new tourist information office has recently opened on Rruga Ded Gjo Luli, just north of Skanderbeg Square (behind the National Historic Museum). The English-speaking staff are very helpful and can provide maps and directions to hostels/hotels etc. Also free copies of "Tirana in your pocket" guide, which includes vital information about bus and furgon schedules.

Credit cards are not accepted in many places in Tirana (including the museums), and tend to be frowned upon even if accepted (due to the fees charged to merchants). It is generally better to carry enough cash with you if possible. It is also sometimes a little difficult to break a large bill (2000 lek, around EUR 20), and you might be asked by waiters/store owners to give them a smaller bill instead.

Get in
By plane

Tirana is served by Tirana International Airport Nënë Tereza (Rinas International Airport) () 17 km from the centre of town. 

The following airlines offer service to/from Tirana:

Adria Airways (, , ), Air Serbia (), 
Austrian Airways (), 
Cuneo, , , , , -Malpensa, -Orio al Serio, , , , , , , -Fiumicino, , -Treviso, , ), 
British Airways (-Gatwick), 
Lufthansa (), 
Olympic Air (, ), 
Turkish Airlines (-Atatürk),
WizzAir (),
Transavia ().

Luna Express http:// luna.al operates an hourly bus 24 hours from the airport to Skanderbeg Square and vice versa. It costs 400 lek or 4 EUR each way (buy tickets from the driver, you can also pay in EUR, but credit cards are generally not accepted) and leaves every hour on the hour from both the airport and from the small park just east of Skenderbeg Square. The trip takes around 25-30 minutes. From the airport exit doors, walk towards the parking lot past the taxi touts to find the bus stop. At Skanderbeg Square, take the paved street between the Adrion bookshop and the mosque until you reach the park. The bus is not only punctual but sometimes even early, so plan to be there a few minutes in advance.
Merr Taxi tel:080055550800 55 55 (toll free) offers transportation to and from Rinas International Airport. Roundtrip made within 7 days costs 18€.

Like most other airports currency exchanges, the currency exchange in Tirana Airport charges a very large spread (~10% for me in March 2023). Since you can pay for the bus in EUR, it's generally better to hold off on exchanging your EUR until the city, where the spread is usually around ~1%.

By train
There is no rail connection to Tirana as of September 2013, due to planned relocation of the city's only railroad station and redevelopment of the existing site. This makes Kashar, about 10 kilometers from central Tirana, the closest railroad station to the capital. It was completely renovated together with some rolling stock and opened in May 2015. From there, you can reach , , , (twice daily in the summer), and (line to discontinued since 2012 due to mud slides along Ohrid Lake track). Even though train services are very poor, when compared to West Balkan standards, they may be more frequent, cheaper, and more scenic than taking the bus. Taking the train to Elbasan is not recommended: the four hour trip makes a large detour via Durrës (not very scenic) while Elbasan is only 35 km away from Tirana.

By bus & van

Tirana does not have a central bus station, so you may be dropped at various locations in the city. Buses can be used to reach Tirana from other cities in Albania and internationally. There is daily bus service from , , , (, ), and and multiple services per day to , and other cities in ; additionally there are 3 per week direct overnight bus from Bulgaria by Matpu.

In anticipation of the construction of the two new Multi-Modal Terminals of Tirana near the Kamza Overpass at the western entrance of Tirana, and at the southeastern entrance of the city near TEG Shopping Center, the Municipality of Tirana has opened several temporary bus terminals mainly along Dritan Hoxha St and Student City to regulate the chaos of public transport between towns in Tirana. Tirana now has an international bus terminal, "Stacioni Qendrore i linjave Nderkombetare" but does not have indoor waiting area:

* 

* 

* Kosovo and International-bound lines including the Balkans, Italy, and Greece 

From , take a bus managed by Old town travel leaving from at 8 am through , and for 27 € (plus 2 € per luggage). (Information confirmed 02/23)

From , as of January 2012, take the 20:40 train from to , arrive 07:11 (2.400RSD, 21€, 30U$), walk a few meters to the bus station, and take the 08:00 or the 08:40 bus to Ulcinj (2,50€, 35mins), and the 12:30 bus to Shkodër (only that service confirmed every day, ticket: 6€, 1h45). Everyone must stay in the bus at the border control in Muriqan. You'll arrive to Shkodër at 14:15 and you have plenty of furgon to Tirana. Try to get Leks in advance. Furgon to Tirana costs 500Leks or 5€ (but: 500Leks are only 3€). Trip takes about 1h30. So, you'll get to Tirana Train Station in the Furgon at arroud 18:30, almost 22h after leaving Belgrade! But, only with 30€. 

Buses to and from depart from downtown (behind museum where one also can find buses to Rinas airport). Although everyone says it takes 12 hours, the trip actually takes just 5. Buy the ticket on a travel agency (costs 15€, or 20.000Leks). Busses (no more than 4 a day) leaves from UFO University, near Skenderberg Place, at noon. 
 
Hak Bus runs two buses a day from in to Tirana, at 10:00 and 22:00, taking around seven hours and arriving near the train station on Zogu I Boulevard. A connecting shuttle bus runs from to Tetovo at 09:00 and 21:00, and a single through-ticket can be bought at the International Bus Terminal in Skopje (MKD1330). In addition, there is a 06:00 bus that leaves Skopje for Tirana.

Buses and furgons (minibuses) are generally the best method for traveling within Albania, but they are not in the best of shape. There are few bus companies; many are operated by individual drivers. Bus lines have schedules, but are often delayed until the coaches are full or a the whim of the driver.

Some international bus stations are far from the centre so it may be worth taking a taxi to the bus stop to save time and energy and avoid getting lost. Also, note that drivers of Furgons and Vans drive exceptionally erratically - if you are prone to motion sickness (car sickness) you should take measures to remedy that beforehand.

By boat

Tirana is not a port, so you can't get there directly by boat. There are, however, reasonable sea routes from (from the ports in , , and ) to , the nearest port to Tirana from where you can take the train (which comes approximately every two hours) or a bus to Tirana. You could also rent a car and be in Tirana in about 20 minutes.

Get around

By bus
Public transportation in Tirana consists of a number of intra-city bus lines, which are not very fast, but cheap (40 Lek for one ride). Buses marked 'Unaze' are for the ring road and travel in a loop around the city centre. There are also lines serving suburban shopping centers and Tirana Airport.

A useful web and Android application regarding Tirana's Public Transportation such as lines, directions, times and costs can be found at Tirana Bus Stations. An Android application is also available for download at GetJar or at the Developer's Website

On foot
The city center is small enough to be explored by walking. Walking is a rewarding experience, but beware that there is *no* continuity in sidewalk width, construction material or condition. Sidewalks frequently end abruptly, have large holes or are very narrow. Pay attention while walking or you may end up spraining your ankle or falling in a hole. Street names are subject to change, so locals rarely know them. It is advised to learn a to navigate via landmarks instead of addresses or street names. You can orient yourself using the Lana River and "Dëshmorët e Kombit" street, which roughly bisects the central part of Tirana into four sections. At this intersection of the Lana River and Dëshmorët e Kombit is very recognizable "Pyramid" and "Taiwan Center".

By bicycle
Tirana is not known as a bicycle-friendly city, but the current Mayor has stated that he is committed to improving the cycling infrastructure and bicycle lanes are beginning to appear on some streets. The Ecovolis Bicycle Sharing Program launched in 2011 with a number of rental locations, including Rinia Park (near the Taiwan Center) and along Deshmoret e Kombit Boulevard. A full day ride costs 100 lek (approx. $1USD as of 2012). Bicycles should be returned to the station of origin. Ecovolis also offers bikes for longer 24/7 rents at the shop. For all other bike equipment or repair, Rruga Qemal Stafa is Tirana's unofficial "bike street" with lots of little, inexpensive bike shops.

Cycling in the street can be somewhat intimidating to riders unfamiliar with Balkan traffic but combined bus and bike lanes have been opened recently on some main streets. Bicycle-only lanes are located on Skanderbeg Square, Deshmoret e Kombit Main Boulevard and on sidewalks along Lana River and Kavaja Street.

By taxi
Newer taxis that use a meter (generally more cheaper) can be found around town:
* MerrTaxi offers online and authorized taxi reservation phone: 0800 5555 (toll free).
* SpeedTaxi

Official taxies have a list with fare prices inside the vehicle. During the day flag-fall starts at 250 Lek (as for MerrTaxi) and 300 Lek during the night or holidays.

Most informal taxies or irregular ones do not use the taximeter. You can negotiate the price before entering the cab, or ask them to use the taximeter and save money. 

To calculate your fare in advance you can use the online taxi fare calculator for Tirana.

By car
Driving in Tirana is an adventure. Parking is a major problem in most of the city and you will frequently find cars double and triple-parked in lanes of traffic or parked on sidewalks. Many spaces or lots are actually a business and you may be approached before, during, or after parking by a plain-clothed person asking for a parking fee. Costs range from 100lek (~1USD) to 200lek (~2USD) depending on location and duration of stay.

Albanians are fond of honking the car horn, which can mean anything from "I'm here" to "Hurry up!" Road conditions vary - a few are built to more modern standards but you may run into roads that are badly damaged or not paved at all. Traffic lights are hit or miss - some work, some don't. Many Albanians do not abide by them anyways - a red light is simply an opportunity to skip to the front of the queue. EBRD is lending the Albanian government €14.6 million to work and fix roads in Tirana. Part of the loan will be used to upgrade the Tirana ring road. 

PAY ATTENTION WHILE DRIVING because the roads are cheaply built and they deteriorate quickly! Damage (even on highways) is rarely marked by anything more than a pile of rocks - impossible to see more than 100 meters away. Serious vehicle damage can occur if you are not vigilant.

Driving with your headlights on at all times is required and police will stop you (if they feel like it) for not turning them on. Police are generally corrupt and will ask for bribes, but if they discover you are a foreigner they are likely to let you go without a problem.

That said, driving offers an unique experience in Tirana for those willing to brave it. Driving aggressively and seizing opportunities will help you get around at normal pace. Timid and passive drivers should avoid driving in Tirana as they will likely be frustrated.

Car rentals in Albania are available from multi-national firms and can be booked online:
* Hertz
* Avis
* Europcar
*etc.

Local rentals are often cheaper:
* Noshi Rent-a-Car
* Albarent
* etc.

Also, keep in mind that the word car sounds identical to the Albanian word for penis, so do not be surprised if you get stared at if you say it. Auto or the Albanian word, makinë are suitable stand-ins.

See

* Tirana's city centre. A statue of Albanian hero Skanderbeg stands in the square with the Albanian flag on the side. Renovations have made the square pedestrian and public transportation friendly. Government buildings featuring Italian architecture and many of the sights listed below are all right off this square.

* A panoramic boulevard built by the Italians in the 1930s similar to the Champs de Elysee extending south from Skanderbeg Square. The boulevard features Fascist, Communist, and modern architecture of government buildings, business centers and hotels. Many local parks are found here.

* The main museum in Tirana, it is in the centre of the city, easily recognizable because of a huge mosaic standing on top of its front facade. It contains many artifacts ranging from ancient times through Hoxha's regime. Repeated looting in the 1990s has robbed the museum of many artifacts, but it remains the best place in Albania to learn its history. Harrowing exhibition about Albania's gruesome labour camp system. Not enough English.

* 13th century pieces, modern art, socialist art. 

* This enormous underground bunker, with over 100 rooms on five levels, was built during the Hoxha era to accommodate the government during a war. It is now open to the public as a museum about that era (signs in Albanian and English) and also hosts art installations.

*Cable car to Mount Dajti (1,613 m / 5,292 ft), where snow can cover the mountain in winter. At the top station of the cable car there is a restaurant with fantastic views over Tirana, and a hotel with a rotating bar on the top floor. In 2017, a new Dajti Mt National Park tourist information center was opened, located near the TV and Radio towers along SH47 in Fushe Dajt. A trip on the cable car can be combined with a visit to the nearby BUNK'ART (see above).

It was opened to the public in 1991 and since became the number one spot for Tirana's youth. At night the area gets full of people especially on weekends when most night clubs are full. The streets, especially in summer afternoons, are filled with Tirana's citizens and expensive cars cruising around.

You can also cruise the city with a limousine or venture out in the picturesque suburbs either south or northeast/west of Tirana.

*Sky Tower Rotating Bar. (Rr. Ibrahim Rugova) This is a must! The rotation takes about 1.5 hour. It's a bit jerky and may leave you slightly seasick. It is closed for renovation as of March 2023.
* Murat Toptani Street is a recently opened pedestrian only street east of Rinia Park constructed with stone and located nearby Tirana Castle walls. Traditional houses, cafes, Hotel Millennium, an Italian B&B and a local park are found here.

* This beautiful place in the heart of downtown Tirana.

Children enjoy gourmet ice cream and iced European soft drinks, whilst adults and teens can enjoy fun casinos. This is an excellent tourist attraction, and many Albanian celebrities can be found in the area. There is a bowling alley in the basement of the building, however the overall condition leaves something to be desired if you have bowled anywhere else.

* Located at the southern side of Deshmoret e Kombit Boulevard, this square features typical Fascist architecture. Buildings include the University of Tirana, Archaeological Institute, Academy of Arts and the National Stadium.

* 1,612m high. Offers great views of Tirana. A very relaxing area, mount Dajti can be reached through an Austrian-built express cable car (800 lek round trip). Take a city bus (40 lek) from beside the mosque at Skanderbeg Square (20 min). The view along the route is worth the cost even if you don't get on top of the mountain (there is a military zone there). The tourism complex offers a few hotels and restaurants, but it is great for taking a breath of fresh air and activities like mountain sports, horse riding, trekking, skiing etc. Bikes are allowed on the cable car free of charge and the ride down the rough mountain road is an adventure which offers great panoramas. The Pellumba Cave in the area is worth a visit. Unfortunately, litter is becoming a problem on Mount Dajti. This detracts from the experience somewhat, but the beautiful scenery still makes the trip worthwhile.

* People have picnics and have fun, and the natural beauty allows it because of the huge trees, open spaces, and mountains surrounding them. An artificial lake lies in the middle of the Park. It is popular with locals and tourists as a place to walk around and enjoy a lunch or coffee at one of the restaurants or cafés. Over 120 types of plants. A popular swimming pool complex is located nearby. 

* The Ali-Demi skate park is a great place to go with your family because there is a nice park on one of the sides next to the skate park, there are markets, and a beautiful café shop with a playground for small children with typical swings and benches and soccer fields in the back. The skate park is full of people on bikes, roller skates, and skate boarders. The Skate Park is very good for beginners, the ramps are all cement (there is coping on the ramps). The ramps have a good variety—there are small ramps along with big ones. Almost all the ramps are shaped like a plateau they are good for caching air. There are many places to do ollies and 180s off of and other places to grind if you are an experienced skate boarder. The skate park is slightly below the rest of the park so you shouldn’t go when it’s raining because it fills up with water. There are quarter pipes along the sides of the skate park. This skate park is very fun for skaters, bikers, and roller skaters.

=Stay safe=
Violent crime and drug related crime are a reality in certain areas of Tirana. Check with your embassy for current advisories. You will probably notice when a street gang is trying to get a handle on you, using your name as you pass, circulating information from social media and criminal networks. Petty thefts or scams do exist, but in no larger scale than in many other cities. Beggars will approach people in the central areas, but simply ignoring them is usually enough to make them go away. In suburban areas, groups of stray dogs may intimidate foreigners. The best advice is to simply ignore them and keep walking.

Predictable scams around the strip clubs, near the Turkish hammams, certain hotels, bus stations, and corner bars that see stiletto foot traffic. Be alert near the Pyramid, and near the bars of Blloku at any time night or day, there are shootings. Street gangs follow to see how you spend your money, camp out at ATMs shoulder surfing, malls, electronics boutiques. Both furgons and company taxis can put you rapidly into bad company anywhere in Albania. Privately operated taxis are less organized.

You should take some precautions when walking around the city. The main advice is to simply watch your step. Although many parts of the city are maintained, there remain holes and worn-down street parts. Cars also seem to drive more recklessly than in most European cities, and assume a right-of-way, so care is needed in crossing the street. Not even a green light is always a guarantee of safety! Try to see when the locals cross the street and cross with them.

Environment
Tirana has suffered from overpopulation, and high levels of air pollution and noise pollution, but is among the most improved cities by these standards in recent years. Compared to other places in Europe, fuel that is used in Albania contains larger amounts of sulfur and lead. Also, there have been problems regarding the noise pollution. In Tirana, there are not a lot of green spaces which makes the air more polluted.

It is advisable to take insect repellent during the summer months as mosquitoes can be a nuisance.
