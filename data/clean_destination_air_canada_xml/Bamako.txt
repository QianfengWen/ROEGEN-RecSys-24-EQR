Bamako is the capital of , located on the Niger river. With a population of around 1.7 million, it's the largest city in the country and one of the largest in West Africa.

Understand

Bamako has been continuously inhabited by humans since prehistoric times. In 1883 it was conquered by French troops, and in 1908 became the capital of French Sudan.

The city has only a few paved main roads (goudrons), the rest of the city's roads are unpaved, and get dusty during the dry season (November to May) and muddy during the rainy season, offering breeding grounds to malaria-carrying mosquitoes. 

The city can be hard to navigate through due to the lack of road signs, the complicated layout of the streets and the one way system in the city. The roads are very crowded both with motor vehicles and motorcycles who appear to fill every available space possible. Traffic police are particularly vigilant and will sometimes appear to enforce very arbitrary traffic rules. They are usually on motorcycles as well so it is unwise to try and out run them in your vehicle as they will easily catch up.

Often the best way to navigate around the city is to hire a taxi-motorcycle to lead you to your destination. These are relatively cheap and depending on the distance can be as low as 100 cfa. There is no meter and price is negotiated upfront. 

Unemployment rates are high.

Get in

By plane

Bamako-Sénou Airport is roughly 15km (30&ndash;40 minutes) from the city center, with flights from on Air France. Flights to Europe are also offered by Royal Air Maroc, via -- the main drawback to this option is that the flight from BKO to leaves at 3:35am. Taxi rides should cost about 7500 CFA from the city. 

Passengers flying Air France should consider pré-enregistrement, or early check-in. This can be done at the Air France office on the day of the flight, between 10AM and 5PM. The office is located at Square Lumumba. Luggage is dropped off and boarding passes issued right then and there, as would happen at the airport - minus the crowds and the hassle!

The airport has been renovated in 2009-10 and is now modern, clean and decent sized though doesnt have many shops or cafes once you are inside the terminal, especially late at night when most international flights are landing/taking off. People with difficulty getting around may find Bamako-Senou challenging, so book assistance in advance if needed. 

Outside the arrival terminal there are Forex bureaus and plenty of hawkers selling local SIM cards. If you need reliable internet while in Bamako, buying a local mobile SIM card with data is advisable as even the top hotels in Bamako can have poor internet service. Most Malians returning home change money at the airport so its advisable to change money at the arrival terminal, especially if you arrive after 3pm when banks are likely closed for the day. 

Arrivals side of the airport doesn't appear to have good WIFI, however you may be able to get public WIFI connectivity in the departure area, just a short walk away, turn right outside the arrival area.

By train
Bamako is at the end of the railway line from in Senegal which used to transport passengers across western Africa. However since a few years back all cross-border traffic have stopped and the only remaing service is a thrice-weekly train from the western city of and a short commuter service from . There have been several announcements recently of a renewed service between Bamako and Dakar but no trains have yet materialsed.

By bus
At the Sogoniko bus station you can find busses to other cities such as , (taking about 10 hours).

Get around

See 

*

* 

* 

* Animals in fair to good condition. 500CFA to enter, 100CFA each for extra exhibits such as the reptile house, aviary or aquarium.

* Near the zoo and national museum. 

* Houses caves with rock paintings, and offers good views across the city.

* Decent collection of Malian art, artifacts and textiles in pleasant grounds north of the centre. There isn't a massive range of exhibits, but they are well displayed and worth a visit. Be aware that there are no English labels on exhibits, though English guides are available. Open 9 am to 6 pm. Closed on Mondays and some holidays. 
*The Parc National du Mali is a well maintained parc with different things to do and also allowing you to relax and enjoy good and fresh air.

Do
At the end of each January, Bamako hosts the finish line to the gruelling trans-Sahara rally, the Budapest-Bamako Hundreds of rally cars and motorcycles arrive in the city on the last Sunday of January.

Buy 
Prices are not fixed, and for many goods bargaining is expected. Beware, sometimes for common items (like food) the first price mentioned is just right. On the market it might be a good idea to first ask a couple of times at different stands before actually buying something.

Near the area of Bamako-Coura is the lively artisan market where traders from all over Bamako come to sell silver jewelry, leather, musical instruments and wood carvings. Prices are reasonable but the vendors expect their customers to bargain and enjoy it when they do. Once inside the market the atmosphere is relaxed and pleasant but be careful in the busy streets directly surrounding - it's easy to lose a bag to a thief. 

Euros are widely accepted and dollars less so and often at a fairly poor exchange rate. It can be difficult to exchange foreign currency for local West African Francs (XOF) outside of business hours, and most businesses close on Saturday lunchtime and do not reopen until Monday morning. There is little forex activity outside of official agents and banks so be sure to get local currency during business hours (generally 8am to 3pm). 

ATM's were difficult to find in Bamako, but their presence is growing. BDM banks have ATM's for VISA cards in several branches, and Banque Atlantique used to have ATM's for Maestro/Mastercard, but their license has lapsed, so VISA and possibly VISA electron are now the only options for all Malian ATMs.

Eat 

*Decent Italian restaurant - just don't expect taxi drivers to know where it is...
Love them or hate them, the French have left one decent legacy in West Africa: bread. Fresh delicious baguettes are ubiquitous, and travelers should not be worried about becoming sick because of the bread.

Vegetarians will have a hard time in Bamako. Asking for a meal without meat will usually be met with the kind of look reserved for children and elderly relatives one does not wish to upset. In a country where poverty is common and food is often scarce, turning down meat is an oddity.

That said, mornings beans, fries, and fried plaintains can be found streetside throughout the city. Morning, noon, and night you can find small streetside "cafes" where you can get a VERY fried egg sandwich and some nescafe. Several varieties of fried dough are also easy to stumble upon. Lunch- Rice and sauce is most easy to find, in local restaurants a plate with meat shouldn't cost more than 500, but can range up to 1,500. Evenings you can find attcheke (cassava dish), spaghetti, beans, boiled eggs, and fries relatively easily. 

Meat eaters will be pleased to learn beef and fish are exceptionally good. Beef kebabs and grilled Capitaine, a freshwater fish from the Niger river, are always a good choice. Chicken are usually left to fend for themselves, and tend to be on the scrawny side, especially compared to North-American chicken. Although the situation is improving, you might want to avoid disappointment and just give chicken a miss while in Bamako. To avoid food borne illness, stay away as much as possible from fresh vegetables, and make sure your food is piping hot before eating it. 

*Very well run, little known restaurant/brasserie. Excellent food (the Pave du boeuf is yummy). Excellent service. Small pool, outside tables. Near the river. Prices are relatively high for Mali but in Bamako you need a treat sometimes!
Grocery shopping
You can eat like the locals for a few hundred CFA a day, or shop in one of the western-style supermarkets.

There is one main market, in the centre of town, and several smaller markets in Bamako.

Supermarket-style stores are generally run by Lebanese businessmen. 
*La Fourmi A two story grocery store, the second floor contains house hold supplies. The butchers will cut the meat to order. The store is open from 7:30 am -1:00 pm and from 3:30 pm - 8:00pm, Monday - Saturday. Sundays 8:30 am -12:30 pm.
*Azar The store is open from 7:30 am -1:00 pm and from 3:30 pm - 8:00pm, Monday - Saturday. Sundays 8:30 am -12:30 pm.
*Supermarket Le Miniprix It is actually the best one with the best service and with the lowest prices. They have a very clean store and are open from 7:30am to 10:30pm. They also accept US/Canadian Dollars and Euro.
These stores will carry Western or Middle-Eastern goods, including cold cuts, fruit and vegetable, and dairy products including fresh milk and yogurt. Prices are generally higher than in Europe or the US, and choice more limited in a way reminiscent of a North-American convenience store.

Budget

There are many restaurants where you can get nice omelette sandwiches for about 250 CFA.

Many street vendors sell bread, rice, fries, salad, grilled meat; however, use precautions while eating on the street. 

* Bistrot/Restaurant/Bar in a small street. Eating in a courtyard. Very good and friendly service. Daily special includes local dishes, à la carte steak, fish or spaghetti. Well stocked bar. Recommended.

Assalam - ACI 2000 between the obelisk round point and Place Can. Lebanese- good shawarmas, hummus, brochettes- varied menu. Pleasant staff.

Mid-range

* Restaurant serving good authentic African cuisine, on a square just off a main road. Not luxurious but good. Beer and wine are available but, because of the proximity to a mosque, don't be surprised if on Fridays they ask you to keep the bottles out of sight on the floor. They have a second location at the Musée National.

* Restaurant and Bar. One of the strangest sights on earth. Malians in velour cowboy hats and vests serve Tex-Mex dishes in the restaurant while blond Russian professional women work the bar. Must be seen to be believed. The food isn't bad either.

* Another Lebanese joint with slightly higher class food than the rest. Nice shawarmas, pizzas, and good mixed salads are on the menu here

Bamako has many Lebanese and Chinese restaurants.

Splurge

Hippodrome
*Bla Bla is where Bamako's uppercrust go to relax and have a (expensive) cocktail or bottle of champagne. With a small but delicious African menu, a wide range of cocktails, and cold draft beer - it is one of the most popular restaurants to see and be seen. An entree here is around $15 US. Also this place frequently has art exhibitions for local artists.

*Le Terrace next door to the Bla Bla is a very large bar/lounge on top of a night club. Very good atmosphere and salsa music, dancing. Good pizzas and other fare. 

*Le Relax is a popular Lebanese hangout in Hippodrome with quick food and free wi-fi access. Pizzas, shawarmas, and hummus are the stars in this menu.

*Broadway is a Western style restaurant which is pretty much the only place you can find a "real" hamburger with "real" cheese. Also on the menu are breakfast burittos, chicken wings, and shakes. Great if you are missing the comforts of home. Burgers only run $4 without fries but expect to pay up to $12 for a full entree.

*San Toro is a restaurant serving traditional Malian food and drink - no alcohol, but many ginger, tamrind and seasonal fruit based drinks. There is always live acoustic music there and the ambiance is very relaxed.

*Da Guido just after the Bla Bla Road becomes dirt, is a real Italian restaurant run by real Italians. Their oven fired pizzas are the best in Bamako and they also serve up hefty portions of delicious pasta. Expensive wine flows freely here. Walking into this place you will think you just walked into an Italian restaurant in Brookly with the Roman wall murals and brick floors. A good pizza will run you about $15 US.

Drink
The Evasion Jazz Club can be pretty cool on Fridays and Saturdays.
The Hippo d'Or (close to Hippodrome) is also a nice place for enjoying non-stop live music on Fridays and, even more, on Saturdays. There is a big Casino near the Hotel L'Amitie. Ibiza, Blyblos (under renovation as of August 2010) and Terrace are still the hippest places to dance and drink. For some less seedy drinking establishments, try No Stress & Jet Set (formerly Privledge), which both have pool tables as well. Bla Bla and its twin in Badalabougou are known to get pumping on weekends. 

Crazy Horse has some good food and is well priced.
*Around the hour 00:00 on weekends the Malians come alive; this is a nice nightclub that opens up at 00:00 and plays a variety of dance music. 

Sleep

*Decent double rooms with fan for 10000 CFA. Handy location - close to attractions in the city centre. Will arrange taxis to the airport.
* As of October, 2009, this is probably the plushest of all the hotels in Bamako along with the Radisson.
* Swimming pool, tennis court, internet access. The hotel is by far one of the oldest in town. For a while, it was the most run-down as well but has recently been thoroughly renovated. Nice-sized, very clean rooms with large windows that open. Good service. Restaurant reasonable but the bkfst buffet is a little overpriced. Both the jewelry lady and Tuareg crafts vendor in the lobby will try to massively overcharge you. Give them a miss: you'lll do better at the Marché des artisans in town. Small bookstore in the lobby with a decent selection of Malian books and newspapers. Staff haven't figured out how to clean out the pool - give it a miss. Internet reliable and fast, by local standards. (Closed as of July 2012, will likely reopen when visitor numbers bounce back.)
* Most luxurious of the three Azalai hotels in Bamako, and one of the best in town. Very nice pool. Expensive but nice restaurant. Central air, big beds, colour tv, immaculate bathrooms. Hotel bar popular with "professional" women.
* A very new hotel opened in January of 2010 which while small with only five rooms, is probably one of the most inviting establishments in the city. Very nice pool and garden. Breakfast and internet included in the price.
* Has a pool, French restaurant and bar. Food good but not cheap. Make and sell their own ice cream! You can pay to use the pool if you're not staying there. The rooms are smallish but clean, air conditioned, with wireless internet.

* 
* Budget, located in one of the many markets 
* around $45 Hotel on a quite street within walking distance of several restaurants (Vienamese, Chinese, French and a well stocked supermarket. Small swimming pool. Rooms are spread over several buildings around a courtyard. Ask to be shown some rooms before you make the decision. Some rooms are much nicer than others. A/C, slow internet access in business centre. Breakfast is OK but do not count on dinner or lunch. OK bar for a cold beer.
* Rooms are small and make sure that you get a room at the garden side otherwise don't bother unless you like to get up early with the traffic noise. Italian restaurant on ground floor is good but pricey for Bamako. Advantage is the Azar supermarket next door and the café/restaurant le Relax.
*This is a nightclub with very nice mixture of music from international to local dance tracks. it opens up its doors at 12:00am. the are very beautiful girls
* Secured entrance and has been renovated but is not exactly up to 4 star standard. Excellent, large rooms and free (but slow) wifi throughout the hotel for guests, the hotel staff certainly try hard but there is a lack of hot water and frequent electricity cuts (although they have a generator). Prices for Dec 2021: 75.000 CFA per night for a basic double The ACI 2000 area of Bamako is however quiet and removed from the hustle and bustle of downtown and generally a rather boring area of town.
*Laico Hotels took this over from the Kempinski Hotel Chain. 
*Nice, very clean rooms. 15 min to centre, airport and busstation. Restaurants, bars, markets are on walking distance. Nice evening or morning stroll to the river Niger. Transfer to and from airport is possible. Owner Adama can help you with your excursions. 9.000 CFA 1 pers room. 13.500 CFA 2 pers. room. info@ambassagou.com
*A small African style guesthouse with outdoor bar, small swimming pool, thatch "pailotte" and free computer and wi-fi access for guests. In a safe and convenient location for Hippodrome ventures. Serves up traditional Malian meals (grilled chicken, fish and kebabs) for a reasonable cost.
*Camping & hotel popular with trans africa truck groups. Normally has restaurant available but not now due to lack of customers until the political situation stabilizes. Bar still available.

Stay safe
In Bamako you have a high chance of encountering the police. You should always at least carry a copy of your passport and visa. It is often not sufficient to just show your driving license and this might lead to a ride to the police office - if you're not prepared to bribe your way out. Notice that the police often stops taxis.

If the price of the 'ticket' seems high (more than, say, 5,000 cfa for a minor offense), ask to go to the police station. There you can get an official receipt which shows the true price of the offense. Many locals consider it a moral issue to pay proper fines rather than grease the pockets of corrupt police.

Stay healthy
If you go gradually (doni doni) you'll be able to drink Bamako's quite chemically tasting tap water. You shouldn't drink the unmarked sachets with water or syrupped water as long as you don't drink tap water -- though the branded sachets of mineral water are fine (50CFA).

Or you can avoid any hassles and drink bottled water. If you're sticking around town for a while, try buying bottled water by the case. 
The price will drop from about 1500-1800 CFA to 600-700 CFA per 1,5 litre bottle.

Clinique Pasteur is a more expensive tubab clinique, is fairly clean, and is within close proximity to the US Embassy in ACI 2000 area of Bamako. You first might want to consult a cheaper normal heath center like Clinique Farako in Hamdallaye, or the Centre Diagnostique (Dr. Catherine Cisse) near the old Pont de Martys. Even then, double check all recommendations online and with a doctor abroad before embarking on any treatment plan or surgery.
