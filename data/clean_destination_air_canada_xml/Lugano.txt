Lugano is a lakeside city in , the only majority Italian-speaking Canton of . Located at the extreme south of the country, Lugano is part of a temperate micro-climate, offering palm trees, picturesque boulevards, stunning views of the lake and the Alps, and plenty of opportunity for outdoor and indoor activities. Lugano also makes a good base for visiting other cities and sites in the area. The city is a pleasant place to relax in the summertime and is only half an hour away from the italian cities of and .

Get in

By plane

Lugano has a small international airport, Lugano-Agno airport located in the nearby municipality of Agno with flights arriving from several European locations, particularly , , and . These are typically connecting flights through Geneva or Zurich. Swiss International Air Lines and Darwin Airline (as Etihad Regional) fly regularly scheduled services to Lugano.

's airports are, on average, 1 1/2 hours away by bus or train. Of these, Milano Malpensa may be the best choice for Lugano due to the high volume of flights and its location well towards Switzerland (1 hour by shuttle). For Europeans, Malpensa is especially convenient for its high volume of Easyjet routes. For details on shuttle transfers between Lugano and Malpensa please refer to the "By Bus" section below.

By train

Lugano station is located on the Gotthard railway which crosses the alps connecting Kanton Schwyz, Uri, and Cantone Ticino. It primarily serves FFS (aka SBB, aka CFF, the national railway operator), TILO (Joint operation between FFS and Italy's Trenord), EC, and the local metre-gauge FLP.

FFS trains leave for (1:57 hr), (2:55 hr) and (a good hour) as well as (via Zurich: 4:43h with 1 train-change). Note that getting to or other points west of Ticino, it is often faster to go via Zurich or as the trains are more frequent and faster.

FLP trains depart from a separate platform about 50 metres down the hill from the FFS platforms. This line travels to Ponte Tresa on the Italian border via Lugano-Agno Airport.

By car

Due to physical geography, Lugano has good North-South oriented links and non-existent East-West ones.

Lugano is on the A2 motorway (just "2" on a red background on Swiss road signs) which spans the width of the country from Basel on the French/German borders to Chiasso on the Italian. This is part of the European Route E35 from Amsterdam, Netherlands to Rome, Italy.
Like most Swiss roads, the condition is usually very good and speeds are good, nevertheless distance makes journey times relatively long, particularly when travelling from the north of the country. (But then again, what do you expect, you're crossing the alps! Just imagine that you're Hannibal and enjoy it). Lugano is about 3h from Berne or Zürich, in optimal conditions. Note that this route passes through the San Gottardo tunnel, which is a bit of a bottleneck on Sundays (northbound) and Friday (southbound), so budget some time for traffic jams. Jams can be up to 3 hours long during peak travel times such as Easter.

Coming from the south, you have more choices on the flat Po plain but the main route is the A9 motorway from near Milano to Chiasso (where it becomes the Swiss A2). This motorway is fast and relatively uncongested, just beware the somewhat more carefree driving style of the Italians compared to the Swiss. Note also the changes in speed limits when crossing into Switzerland. Lugano is about 1h30 from Milano and 1h10 from Malpensa airport, in optimal conditions. Travelling on the A9 does incur one toll near Como, around 2.20EUR as of 2016.

NB. crossing customs is usually a pain-free exercise. Switzerland is part of Schengen, so they're (currently) not interested in your passport (if you're European) but they are not part of the EU and may be interested if you're carrying anything you need to declare; make sure you know the duty-free limits 

By bus
There are three airport shuttle services between Lugano and Milan Malpensa Airport (both terminals). The services are very similar to each other, so if you are short of time just pick the one that's going to arrive next:
* Lugano Services 
* Malpensa Express NB. This should not be confused with the Malpensa Express train service to Milano città; probably best to ignore all signs except for the ones to the bus stops. The bus service is operated by a company called Giosy Tours, so look for the busses branded with that name on the side.
* Jetbus 

Features:
* Embarkation: All serve both terminals at Malpensa, and are fairly easily located just outside the arrivals areas; there are signs in front of their pickup points/bays that all say Lugano and have timetables on them. 
* Dropoff: All shuttles stop at Lugano FFS (at Piazzale Besso just behind the stazione). Lugano Servizi and Malpensa Express make one or two intermediate stops, while Jetbus is non-stop. Malpensa Express contines on to Bellinzona.
* Cost: All cost roughly the same amount and all accept payments in either CHF or EUR, cash-only. All baggage is carried free of charge.
* Tickets & Reservations: All permit tickets to be purchased on board; reservations are not usually necessary but can be made online. Return tickets for one company are not usable on another company's busses.
* Return tickets: All offer returns which are more economical and validity is within one month (keep hold of your receipt)
* Frequency: All offer a roughly two-hourly service
* Journey time MXP-LUG: All services are roughly the same (1 hour), regardless of stops. It's often quicker than driving a car since the busses use Telepass for tolls and so do not need to stop, and do not use the general lanes at Swiss customs.
* Fleet: All companies' vehicles are comfortable, air-conditioned, minibuses or coaches

There is also a daily bus service during summer to , with train connection (Bernina Express to (Switzerland).

Get around

Lugano is small enough to get around on foot, and many of the streets are pedestrian-only, but the hills above the lakefront are very steep so bus or funicular from the center of town might be a better option. This is probably particularly pertinent if you have a lot of bags and need to get from the Stazione FFS to your hotel in town.

Taxis can also be found on the main roads. They are metered and the fares (quite high compared to other cities) are set by the city, so no haggling or shopping around is required.
Ferries and Funiculars are great options for seeing the views.

Tickets

For public transport, Ticino is divided into fare zones, and tickets typically have a valid time period within a zone, as opposed to validity for a single trip.

APE cards (Arcabaleno Prepay Easy) can be used throughout Ticino. This is a contactless card which isn't quite as smart as, for example, London's Oyster Card. The Arcobaleno card cannot itself be used to pay for travel on the bus/train but it can be used to buy tickets at machines which do not accept credit cards, and it prevents you from having to hold a paper carnet (although when you validate (obliterare) your journey, you will receive a paper receipt that provides evidence of the validation). In Lugano, cards can be purchased from ticket counters and machines on the platforms at Lugano Centro bus station. Apparently also from drivers.

Tickets may also be purchased using the Autopostale app for all scheduled bus services (including TPL, ARL) but not SNL boats.

Funicular
For more information:
*Funicolare Lugano Citta - Stazione. This funicular links the main line railway station to the centre of town (Piazza Cioccaro). As of 2017-07 the service runs every few minutes from 05:00 alle 24:00, and costs CHF1.30. The journey takes around 90 seconds and allows you to avoid the scenic but steep hill.
*Funicolare Lugano Paradiso - Monte San Salvatore, telephone +41 91 985 28 28. A funicular which runs from Lugano to the top of the Monte San Salvatore, with spectacular views of the Lake of Lugano, the isthmus of Melide, the Monte Generoso and the Italian enclave of Campione d'Italia on the other side of the lake. 
*Funicolare Monte Brè - Monte Brè, A funicular which runs from Lugano to the top of the Monte Brè for 14 fr. one way and 20 fr. round trip. 

Bus
For the most part, bus tickets can be purchased at bus stops, however not all machines (particularly true the further from the town centre you are) accept credit cards or banknotes.

* Trasporti Pubblici Luganese TPL provides local services in and around town. Busses are gray with blue and green highlights. The main TPL station
* Autolinee Regionali Luganesi ARL provides regional services to the environs. Busses are white with red highlights.
*Autopostale (aka Postbus) busses provide regional and national services. These iconic Swiss busses are yellow with red highlights.
* Società Navigazione del Lago di Lugano SNL provide routes to Campione and Gandria. Busses are white with blue highlights.

The main bus hubs are Lugano Centro for TPL and ARL, and for Autopostale the nearby underground station beneath the Autosilo Balestra. There are also good connections from the Stazione FFS and by the lakeside.

There is usually no requirement to show drivers your tickets, the honor system is used here. However, there are ticket inspectors and fines for freeriding are high so don't try to abuse the system.

You may have mixed results with trying to buy your ticket on the bus, particularly with an APE card. Although most busses seem to have machines capable of doing so, it isn't standard practice and drivers may seem at a loss. The standard procedure is to buy your ticket before you get on; note that in the polite and relaxed Luganese society, busses will wait patiently for you to purchase your ticket and then board (make sure you acknowledge the courtesy with a respectful "Grazie!").

Boat
Regular pedestrian ferry services are operated by Società Navigazione del Lago di Lugano (SNL) and serve many locations around the lake. Main routes are to Gandria, Ponte Tresa, and Porlezza (IT).

SNL also operates tourist cruises.

*While much of Lake Lugano is in Switzerland, a large portion of it is in Italy so take your passport when on a boat.

Car
Because of its small size, a car is largely unnecessary in Lugano. However, if you have decreased mobility a car might be essential due to the steep hills at the edges of the town.
Note that much of the town centre is pedestrian-only or one-way, so you may find it awkward to navigate the town. A detailed map or a GPS is recommended.
Most parking is pay-and-display, street parking tends to be cheaper than the autosili.

Car parks (autosili)
 This map shows the locations of the main city car parks with real-time availability. Note that autosili Balestra, Piazza Castello, and LAC are probably the easiest to reach, and closest to the city centre without having to walk up or downhill.
Pricing is fairly expensive, like most of Switzerland, but car parks are secure and well-appointed.

Blue zones (zone blu)
If you happen to have a blue zone card (some rental companies provide this) which looks like a large blue card with a parking symbol and a dial to set the time of arrival, you can park in spaces marked with blue outlines.
Parking is free and typically allowed for up to an hour (although double-check what the sign says) as long as your blue card is correctly set and clearly displayed. More infomation here.

Talk 
Swiss is spoken in Lugano as a primary language. Aside from some specific vocabulary, Swiss Italian is identical to "Standard" Italian (it's not like the Swiss German variants which often differ significantly from High German).

English is spoken by many individuals that interact with tourists but away from the tourist trail it is much less common, so some Italian and would be useful.

*Special Events

:*Blues to Bop Festival - Free open air music festival with multiple stages throughout the heart of Lugano in late August. Starts at 9:00 PM and goes until 1:00 AM to 2:30 AM depending on the evening.

Buy
Many major labels and designer boutiques (Versace, Hermes, Paul & Shark, Louis Vuitton, and Cartier) can be found here, as well as the usual Swiss and Italian knick-knacks. Via Nassa in the city center is the main place for shopping high street brands.
*Manor - Large department store in the centre of town. Sort of a cross between John Lewis and Debenhams (if you're from the UK). Also has smaller locations dotted around town.
*Huge designer outlet in just 20 km from Lugano. 

Malls
Not very common in this part of Switzerland. The ones you do find tend to be smaller than British or American ones.
*Centro Lugano Sud, Grancia - Decent range of stores located in and around this mall. Main reasons you'd go there: Ikea, Qualipet, Mediamarkt, Coop, some sport and fashion stores.

Eat
If you like Italian-style cuisine with a Swiss twist, you're not going to go hungry here. The main draws are the Grotti, but there are many smaller ristoranti and caffè where you can get excellent food. Indeed it can actually be quite difficult to find non-classy food here.

In terms of "fast food", the locals love their piadine, an Italian-style wrap with various fillings (usually cold cuts, cheese and veg) and served grilled. Essentially an Italian version of a quesadilla; delicious right? Go try one now.

The main problem is that the locals don't seem to have discovered spicy food and you may have a hard time finding anything that requires chilli peppers. Oh well, you can't have everything.

Regarding times, note that mealtimes are rather strictly adhered to (this is Switzerland after all), so if you come from a 24-hour city then you may be in for a surprise when you find that absolutely nowhere is serving at 1545 when you finally decide to get out and go for a meal, and your stomach may just have to grumble a bit until you get to dinnertime.

If you need delivery then your best bet, aside from the ristoranti themselves is probably Divoora who have a reasonably wide selection of restaurants that will deliver, but you're going to miss out on the pleasantness and vibrancy of actually dining out in Lugano.

If you need groceries, then the main Swiss supermarket chains are called Migros, Coop, Denner. The ever-present Lidl and Aldi are also here and usually significantly cheaper than the Swiss ones. 
On Sundays, you're kind of screwed but the Picobello in Stazione FFS (which is also a good option for out-of-hours shopping as it opens fairly late), or perhaps a Migrolino (chain of shops attached to petrol stations) ought to tide you over. You could also cross the border but remember the import limits.

Budget
The cafeteria in the Manor Department store (Piazza Dante 2) offers a wide variety of tempting International dishes, ranging from sushi to pasta. Fresh fruits and vegetables arrayed in stylish displays are almost a painting themselves. Wine and beer are available as are a wide range of other beverages.

And if you simply get tired of delicious local cuisine, there is a McDonald's and a Burger King by the lakeside. Go ahead it's fine, no judgement here, honest.
Turkish-style kebab places are also reasonably common, serving Doner and Felafel.
There's even a Mexican taqueria near the parco civico, which is well-priced. If you're genuinely Mexican or familiar with Mexican cuisine you may have to suspend your disbelief somewhat though; it's not the most authentic food...

Mid-range

Don't focus too much on the list below, the numbers of places that serve pizza is far too high to list recommendations. Suffice to say that the vast majority are excellent and reasonably-priced for Switzerland.

* Argentino, Piazza Riforma, Tel. +41-91-9229049. Excellent pizza, great service. They offer 2 sizes of pizza, price ranges around CHF15-20.

* Tango, Piazza Riforma, Really great tasty pizza, quick service (6-7 min per pizza). Price ranges around CHF 15-20.

* Ristorante Etnic in Quartiere Maghetti, serves a variety of "International" dishes, all quite good.

*Italian cuisine in the village of Gandria with dining on a terrace with views of Lago di Lugano 

Drink
In the summer your best bet is just to wander along the lakeside promenade and open air bar/cafes. Check local listings for clubs and shows as venues come and go with the seasons. Spring-Autumn, Bar Mojito (p.za Manzoni, directly at the lakeside)

There are clubs in the city (discos). Nix (under the Casinò), Privilege (near Manor, a department store), Tito's Place (quartiere Maghetti), Club One and The Cube are all located in the downtown.

Oops (via Maderno 24) and Bibliocafè Tra (Salita dei Frati, Piazza Molino Nuovo) are a great place to have beer in the evening. Near University Another hint:
* Amazing decor, (also an art gallery), great food and views of the Lake!

Sleep
There are a wide range of hotel options right in town, from atmospheric B&Bs to posh four stars to comfy and communal hostels. Be sure to book ahead in the summer, but the rest of the year it's possible to just show up and find something as long as your budget is flexible.

Get out

If you have a car, the awkwardness of driving in town in Lugano is entirely replaced by beautiful regional routes. Some are also accessible by the extensive Autopostale routes. Traffic in Switzerland is much lighter and saner than in Italy but some jams do occur near border crossings.

Lugano is well-connected by public transport if you're travelling North-South, but because of the terrain, terribly connected if you wish to travel East-West.
