Brussels (French: Bruxelles, Dutch: Brussel) is the capital city of and of Brussels Capital Region. It is entirely surrounded by Dutch-speaking and its constituent province. As headquarters of many European institutions, Brussels might also be considered something of a capital for the . Being at the crossroads of cultures (the Germanic in the North and the Romance in the South) and playing an important role in , Brussels fits the definition of the archetypal "melting pot", but still retains its own unique character. The population of the city of Brussels is 1 million and the population of Brussels metropolitan area is just over 2 million.

Understand

When Brussels became the capital city of a new country in the 19th century, many buildings in the old town were destroyed to make way for brand new ministries, palaces, schools, army barracks and office blocks constructed between 1880 and 1980. The historic Flemish town centers are better preserved in other cities: , , , , and .

Language
Brussels operates as a bilingual city where both French (85%) and Dutch (Flemish) (15%) are official languages. Thus all the streets have two names, which can sound totally different. For example, the Main Square is called both la Grand Place and de Grote Markt. Although officially bilingual, French is undoubtedly Brussels' lingua franca. English is also widely understood, but not always widely spoken. Visitors should realize that language is a very divisive issue in Belgium (though this is not as noticeable in Brussels). 

Historically Dutch-speaking, Brussels became more and more French-speaking during the 19th and 20th centuries. Today, most inhabitants speak French in daily life. Some numbers say that more than half of the inhabitants of Brussels do not speak French or Dutch at home. The Brussels dialect, a Brabantian dialect of Dutch, can be heard, especially in the outer districts of Brussels Capital Region. French speakers shouldn't have too much trouble understanding the local French. Dutch speakers may have some difficulty with the Belgian Dutch accent.

English has become a common spoken language because of the international institutions based in Brussels, such as the European Commission, the European Parliament and NATO. It is still relatively rare to find written tourist or general information in English, although the situation is improving greatly. One can expect public announcements in train stations to at least be said in French and Dutch, while larger train stations (such as Zuidstation/Gare Du Midi) typically include English and sometimes German. English is also used on metros, trams and buses, announced last for information such as line transfers and terminal stops. Do not hesitate to ask someone if you do not understand what has been said.

Climate

Brussels weather can often be grey and humid with a high and fairly evenly distributed annual average rainfall of 820 mm (32 in) and on average approximately 200 days of rainfall per year, both which are more than that of London and Paris. Summers tend to be cooler and wetter than London and Paris and winters colder. The daily and monthly temperature variations are quite small. Daily differences between average highs and average lows don't exceed 9ºC (16ºF).

In the summer, maximum temperatures rarely reach 30ºC (86ºF) but can feel much hotter due to high humidity. The summer visitor should be prepared for rain. Warm and sunny weather is not constant during that season or even to be expected.

After October, temperatures can drop off quite rapidly and winter months are often damp and chilly. However temperatures of 15ºC (59ºF) are not unusual into December. Snowfall is rare, and starts to melt fairly quickly, becoming slush on the ground. The winter visitor should be prepared for wet ground.

Boroughs
Brussels is split into nineteen communes or gemeenten (municipalities/boroughs):

* Bruxelles/Brussel - Brussels encompasses many charming and beautiful attractions, with deeply ornate buildings on the Grand Place/Grote Markt, and a fish-and-crustacean overdose of St. Catherine's Square (Place St-Catherine/Sint-Katelijneplein). Stroll along, (and stop in for a drink) at one of the many bars on Place St-Géry/Sint-Goriksplein, or max out your credit card on the trendy Rue Antoine Dansaert/Antoine Dansaertstraat.
** Marolles/Marollen - A neighborhood of Brussels close to the city's heart, the southern part of pentagone-shaped central Brussels. One of the few places where the Brussels dialect of Dutch (Flemish) could still be heard. The area is best known for the flea market held daily on the Place du Jeu de Balle/Vossenplein as well as a plethora of shops selling everything from old radios and bent wipers to fine china and expensive Art Nouveau trinkets. Visit on Saturdays or Sundays.
** Laeken/Laken - An area of northern Brussels that has been administratively added to Brussels proper. It includes the Heyzel/Heisel, Belgium's largest exposition center, the Atomium, the King Baldwin stadium of the Red Devils (Belgium's national soccer team), and the Royal Residential Palace where the king and his family live, including its extensive grounds with greenhouses (open to the public for 3 weeks a year in May), and the Japanese Tower and Chinese Pavilion (unfortunately in a sorry state of maintenance currently).
** Nederoverheembeek - Bordering the Flemish town of Grimbergen, a residential area on the north side of Brussels, administratively part of the city.
** Haeren/Haren - Originally a small farming village, and still retaining some of this charm, on the outskirts of Brussels bordering the Flemish town of Machelen. Its proximity to the airport, the ringway, heavy industry, plus the construction of a new large prison, make it not a very popular place to live. Still, it is administratively part of the city of Brussels proper.

*Schaerbeek/Schaarbeek - A large commune to the north-east of Brussels with many faces. It has sizable Turkish and Arabic populations. The part surrounding the Brussels north station is one of the seediest areas of the city and is, unless you have business there, to be avoided. The Parisian style Josaphat parc is however one of the nicest in Brussels, and its immediate surroundings are seeing quite a bit of gentrification lately, with hip bars and little shops popping up. The streets surrounding the train station and square Riga have some of the best examples of ornate early 20th-century architecture.

*Etterbeek - Fully integrated in the fabric of the city, Etterbeek borders the European Quarter and therefore has lots of EU-expats living there. It has a sizable student population as well due to it bordering the VUB and ULB university campuses, which are technically speaking in Ixelles/Elsene, and the Royal Military Academy. It is densely populated and has few green spaces.

* Ixelles/Elsene - A vibrant part of town with a high concentration of restaurants, bars and other services to satisfy the good-looking or the heavy-spending. Some wandering around will reveal small bookshops, affordable ethnic restaurants or independent record shops tucked away in side streets. The Matongé district just off Chaussée d'Ixelles/Elsenesteenweg is the city's main African neighborhood. It is a large district in the South of Brussels spreading from newly gentrified immigrant neighborhoods off the Chaussée d'Ixelles/Elsenesteenweg near the town center to leafy suburbs close to the Bois de la Cambre/Ter Kamerenbos. The district is split in two by Avenue Louise/Louizalaan, which is technically part of the Bruxelles/Brussel district of the city.

* Saint-Gilles/Sint-Gillis - The city's bohemian epicenter with thriving French, Portuguese, Spanish, Maghrebi and Polish communities. The area around the Parvis de St-Gilles/St-Gillisvoorplein is the arty part, with the area around the Chatelain/Kastelein and the Church of the Holy Trinity being decidedly more yuppified. Like Schaarbeek, Saint-Gilles boasts several Art Nouveau and Haussmann-style buildings.

* Anderlecht - a large commune to the south-west of Brussels. It is residential and is mostly known for its soccer team of the same name that plays in the Belgian premier league. The areas bordering Molenbeek (Peterbos) and Brussels south station (Kuregem) have a poor reputation. Outside of the highway, there is some farmland and some beautiful hikes in the surrounding Flemish countryside can be started. Anderlecht hosts the French-speaking Erasmus hospital of ULB University.

* Molenbeek-Saint-Jean/Sint-Jans-Molenbeek - Commonly known as Molenbeek. A commune with a very large Moroccan and, lately, Romani (Gypsy) population. Together with St-Josse one of the poorest communes in entire Belgium, made even more infamous as the hideout of the 2016 Brussels airport bombers. However, in an effort to revitalize, some interesting museums and event spaces are seeing the light, such as the MiMa museum, La Fonderie, La Vallée, Brussels Event Brewery and Recyclart.

* St-Josse-ten-Noode/Sint-Joost-ten-Noode - Commonly known as St-Josse/St-Joost. The smallest and poorest commune not only of Brussels, but of all Belgium, this commune might not always be too pleasing on the eye but does have a few small, welcoming streets. The mid-part of the Chaussée de Louvain/Leuvensesteenweg is also home to a relatively small Indo-Pakistani community, so this is the place to head to for a tikka masala. The Turkish community which was the largest community only a few years ago has declined rapidly, as they moved to relatively wealthier communes by St-Josse/Sint-Joost standards.

* Koekelberg, Ganshoren, Sint-Agatha-Berchem/Berchem-Sainte-Agathe, Jette - Residential areas to the west, still with a somewhat larger Flemish-speaking population. Koekelberg is home to the Byzantine-style basilica which defines the skyline. Jette houses the Dutch-speaking University Hospital of the VUB university.

* Evere - To the north-east, residential Evere is mostly known as the home of NATO headquarters, making for a larger expat population. The nearby airport makes it a popular place of residence for airport workers. The large cluster of IT industry in bordering Flemish Diegem/Zaventem also lead to a larger Indian community. Evere was originally a Flemish-speaking farming community, known for its endives, and was only added to the Brussels region in 1954. Flemish can still be heard among the older population.

* Uccle/Ukkel and Watermael-Boitsfort/Watermaal-Bosvoorde - Brussels' poshest communes. Green, leafy, bourgeois and starched like all posh communes should be. These communes have retained many of its charming medieval cul-de-sacs, tiny squares and small townhouses as has nearby. Housing and apartment prices here are among the most expensive in entire Belgium. They are home to many embassies.

* Woluwé-Saint-Pierre/Sint-Pieters-Woluwe and Woluwé-Saint-Lambert/Sint-Lambrechts-Woluwe are two communes at the eastern end of the city. Mainly residential, with a mixture of housing blocks, quaint neighborhoods and green areas this place is well-loved by Eurocrats and other professional types. The enormous Wolubilis cultural complex is well worth a visit.

* Vorst/Forest , in between Uccle/Ukkel and the canal, is mainly residential. Its hilly Dudenpark offers views over Brussels from a few areas. Vorst-Nationaal/Forest-National is one of the largest concert halls of Brussels.

Get in

By plane

Brussels Airport (BRU)
Brussels' main airport is Brussels Airport, (locally still commonly referred to as Brussels National or Zaventem) (IATA code: BRU). Several major carriers operate out of the airport, including the local Brussels Airlines, which is owned by Lufthansa.

Brussels Airport has a luggage locker service (Level 0) where you can leave luggage for a fixed duration. The lockers say that you will have to retrieve your bags within 72 hours or else they will be removed, but they are actually moved to the room next door and stored until you retrieve them. This is a useful facility for people wanting to stow away big suitcases somewhere safe. The rate is €7.50 per 24 hours. You need to pay in coins, a change machine is nearby.

To travel between the airport and the city:

* Belgian Rail operates trains (2nd class: Single: €8,60; Weekend return: €14,60; 1st class: €10.30) every 15 min from the airport (Level -1) to Brussels' three main stations, with most trains continuing to other parts of Belgium. The journey to the Central Station takes 15-20 minutes. Tickets can be bought from vending machines (coins or chip credits only) or the train ticket office (notes accepted) located in the airport train station at Level -1. The trains are clean and well-maintained. To enter or exit the train, push the green button on the door, as the doors are not automatically opened at the stations as they are in other systems.

Alternatively, Brussels can be reached by train much more cheaply via Zaventem village (dorp) station, which is within easy walking distance from the airport. At €2,90, the fare is three times cheaper than the ticket from Brussels Airport Station to the city. This is because the expensive Diabolo Surcharge on airport trains does not apply here; therefore, you can also travel this way using Go Pass or Rail Pass without need to pay Diabolo Surcharge. Zaventem dorp station is served by frequent local trains to all Brussels stations, taking roughly the same amount of time as the airport trains (15-20 minutes to Central Station). In order to reach Zaventem dorp station from the airport (~25 min walk), go to the bus parking on level 0 and walk towards the end of it, where the airport bicycle lane starts. Follow the airport bicycle lane (marked in red) through the small car park and along the highway for about 700 metres until the first crosswalk at the roundabout. Cross the road to the left and walk into the street leading into the village (Vilvoordelaan). Keep going straight ahead for another 800 metres until you reach the railway station's back entrance. Coming from Brussels, exit Zaventem station through the back entrance on the northern side (the left in the direction of driving from Brussels). Walk straight north on Vilvoordelaan for about 800 metres until you reach the airport highway overpass, where you cross under and turn right onto the airport bicycle lane indicated with 'Terminal'. Follow the 'Terminal' bicycle lane for about 700 metres along the highway until you arrive at the airport bus parking on level 0, where you can enter the Terminal. From Zaventem dorp you can also take Uber to the airport (~5.5€). 

* STIB Buses #12 and #21 (#12 operates M-F before 8pm and is an express, serving only major bus stops (although it is not any faster); #21 operates after 8pm and on weekends, serving all stops on the route) run every 20-30 minutes via metro station Schuman (where you can transfer to metro lines 1 and 5) to the European district around Place du Luxembourg/Luxemburgplein (on the other side of the park from Gare Central). When boarding the bus make sure that the destination is Luxembourg, as some buses terminate at either the Schuman metro station or Gare de Bordet. The journey takes 30 minutes. The same ticket is valid for a total of 60 minutes on the trains (by SNCB), metro (by STIB), buses (by STIB, De Lijn and TEC) or trams (by STIB) from the moment it is validated. The buses depart from airport level 0. The ticket price is €4.50 from the vending machine next to the bus stop, or €6.00 on board. You can buy a Discover Brussels Card which costs €7.50 for a trip from the airport and unlimited metro usage for 24 hours. The card can be bought at the same "GO" ticket vending machine on the bus stop of #12/#21. Frequent travelers can buy a 10-trip ticket (€25.00), a monthly ticket (€49.00) or a yearly ticket (€514.00) for this line. The latter is valid on the entire STIB network.

* De Lijn Buses #272 and #471 run every 30-60 minutes to Brussels' North Station (called Noordstation/Gare du Nord within the city or Brussel-Noord/Bruxelles-Nord in other places), 2 km north of Grand Place. Night bus #620 operates to/from the airport with a stop at the IJzer metro station (45 minute ride), 1 km north of Grand Place. The buses depart from level 0 of the airport. The ticket price is €3.00 on board. In contrast to the tickets sold by STIB, these tickets (sold by De Lijn) are not valid on other means of public transport within Brussels. 

* Taxis to the center cost around €35. Taxis bleus/blauw (blue): +32 2 268 0000, Taxis Autolux: +32 2 411 4142, Taxis verts/groen (green): +32 2 349 4949. Beware of "waiting" charges if your flight is delayed and you pre-ordered a cab, some companies charge you parking fees + €25-30/hour for waiting. Always confirm the final charge with your driver before getting in the car. It is not uncommon for drivers to rip you off and charge €80 to go to the center, especially if they realize that it is your first time in Brussels and don't know your way around.

* Car Sharing to the city center is one of the cheapest options from Brussels Airport. The major car sharing company at Brussels Airport is DriveNow, where they have their cars parked at P3 Holiday Parking. Just find the car you want and start driving it to anywhere in Brussels. A nice safe and convienient way to drive to and from Brussels airport. 

* Ride Share to the city center hotels from the airport using Uber is around 30 euro. To get your first ride free, register on www.uber.com and use promo code 'uberinbrussels'. Uber is not allowed officially at the airport. However, there are some uber cars at the Sheraton Hotel Airport.

* Tinker offers bus transfers to the city center; prices are calculated by seat and they work with early booking discount. Transfers are available from €9,95.

Brussels South Charleroi Airport (CRL)
 Brussels South Charleroi Airport (IATA code CRL) is located 60km south of the central train station. Several budget airlines, including Ryanair and Wizzair operate service from this airport to cities such as , , , , , , , , , , , and 

To travel between the airport and the city:

* Flibco operates buses (between €5-€14 one-way, €10-€28 return if bought online; €17 one-way if purchased from the machines at the airport or from the driver) every 30 minutes to Brussels Midi/Zuid station, with a journey time of 1 hour (less on the weekends). Buying online is cheaper and faster. The bus stops at Midi/Zuid station ( Midi/Zuid station PDF map), on the Rue de France/Frankrijkstraat in the west. The metro and international trains (Eurostar, Thalys) are on the west side of the station, so upon entering the station from the bus stop, head left rather than straight. When traveling to the airport, it would be better to arrive at the Brussels Midi/Zuid stop far in advance of the bus departure time as the queue to board the bus could be very long (there are no ticket machines and people buy tickets on board). Therefore you might miss the bus and wait another 30 minutes. Also note that the traffic on the way out of Brussels can be heavy in peak hours, so the journey may take longer than planned.

* TEC-bus A (€5.00 one way) operates service from the airport to the Charleroi South (Charleroi-Sud) train station, from where you can connect to an intercity train (€9.20 one way) to Brussels. A combined train+bus ticket to or from Brussels can be obtained for €14.20 from the TEC vending machine at the airport. The bus journey takes 20 minutes and the train takes an additional hour. Trains depart every 30-60 minutes.

* Taxis from the airport to the city center cost a fixed price of €90. For the return trip to Charleroi you can book in advance a Charleroi-based taxi (€90). Taxis operating from Brussels use a higher fare and will take you to the airport for a fixed price of €120 or based on the meter up to €170.

Other
 Antwerp Airport (IATA code ANR) also has a good train connection to Brussels.

By train

Brussels has three main train stations: Midi-Zuid, to the south of the city core, Central-Centraal, which is right next to the city center, and Nord-Noord, to the north of the city center (at Place Rogier). High-speed trains stop only at Midi/Zuid, except the ICE also stops at Nord/Noord. There is a shower at Midi/Zuid located in the toilet near platforms 19-20 (between Origin'O and Quick).

* The high speed Thalys train connects Brussels with (1h52), (1h20) and (2h00). It is much cheaper to book further in advance. With your Thalys ticket you can also take a local train to or from Central-Centraal, Nord-Noord, Schuman and Luxembourg/Luxemburg stations. 

* A Fyra from (2h01, via , , ), connects to Brussels Midi/Zuid. You need a reservation. Weekend return ticket start at €50.00. The Fyra service is currently (August 2013) discontinued, and is not expected to resume any time soon. A replacement Intercity service, for which a reservation is not required, is running every two hours to and , though. 

* An hourly Intercity train from (3h07, via , , ) connects to Midi/Zuid, Central, Nord/Noord, Schuman and Luxembourg/Luxemburg stations. You don't need a reservation. A weekend return ticket costs €41.60. 

* The Eurostar train line links Europe (0h39, €22+), (1h38, €40+) and St. Pancras (1h51, €40+) with Midi/Zuid. Some Eurostar tickets are also valid for internal train travel within Belgium for 24h from the time of the Eurostar ticket), so once in Belgium travel is free for the day. Check in the bottom left hand corner of your ticket and confirm this before you get on the train. A €7 service fee will be added for both telephone and in-person bookings (doesn't apply when booking over the internet). 

* German ICE connects four times a day to and (€39 one way, "Europa Spezial Belgien" offer starting from €29). 

* Connects , , , , , and many other French destinations to Midi/Zuid.

* The Belgian train service.

When taking the train in Brussels, make sure to keep track of other travellers. Sometimes there can be track changes only two minutes before departure and no or barely audible announcements. Keep in mind that Brussels' central location in Belgium makes most trains pass through its South, Central and North stations. This makes for a lot of track changes, congestions and delays.

By bus

* Offers cheap bus travel from , , and other destinations around Europe to Brussels. In Brussels, the stop is outside the North train station.

* The Flemish region (Dutch speaking) public bus service.

* The Walloon region (French speaking) public bus company.

Get around
On foot
Most sights in Brussels are fairly close together, within reasonable walking distance of each other. The oldest part of town can have uneven cobblestone roads, but the rest of the city is fairly easy to walk. Many roads in the old town are closed to cars. Brussels has many wet days, and in winter small amounts of snow can make the ground slushy, so water-resistant footwear is a must if you will be out walking all day. 

By public transport

* The Brussels region (Bilingual) public bus, tram and metro service.

The metro in Brussels is quite clean and safe compared to most metro systems. Metro entrances are marked by big "M" signs in blue and white, with the station name underneath. All announcements are made in Dutch, French and English. There are 4 metro lines (1, 2, 5 and 6) and 3 "chrono" (fast) tram lines (3, 4 and 7). Single tickets, called Jump 1 cost €2.10 if pre-purchased and are available from the driver for €2.50 (only trams and buses, not metro). 
 
You validate the ticket in the small orange machines located in buses/trams, or at the entrance to metro stations/major tram stops. The orange machines time-stamp the ticket, both in ink and magnetically, and it will be valid for one hour. You can interrupt your ride and interchangeably use any STIB/MIVB transport. You should revalidate your ticket for each new ride. 

One ride paper card tickets (called Jump 1) are available at all metro and bigger train stations. They can also be bought from vending machines near major bus and tram stops. There is also a 1 day pass (called Jump 1 jour/1 dag) available for €7.50. These tickets can be purchased either at staffed windows or from kiosks. However, the kiosks do not accept many credit and debit cards and will only accept cash payments in coins. 

The five and ten ride tickets (Jump 5 and Jump 10 respectively) are no longer available as paper card tickets (they were withdrawn from sale on 1 July 2015, although existing part-used cards were still valid in October 2015). The Jump 5 (€8) and Jump 10 (€14) tickets must now be loaded onto a MOBIB or MOBIB-Basic smartcard (which costs €5).

Be aware that the 10 ride ticket can be used by more than one person. Example, if two of you are traveling together, you can just buy one 10 ride ticket, and when you enter the bus, or metro or tram, you validate the ticket twice by entering the ticket on the small orange machine two times. As soon as the ticket is spit out, you enter it again, and the machine will say 2 person, and there will be two lines on the ticket to indicate this. if you know you're going to use public transport a lot, getting the 10 fare pass might be cheaper than getting individual tickets.

Tickets that bear the name Jump are also valid on all SNCB/NMBS-trains and on buses run by Flemish public bus company De Lijn and Walloon public bus company TEC within the Brussels Capital Region.

By bike

Bicycle rental
* Villo! runs a bike sharing network that has over 2,500 bicycles available at over 200 bike stations throughout the city. Users can take a bike from any station and return it to a different station. Membership fees are €1.60/day or €7.65 per week, payable by using a credit card with a smart chip at the automated kiosks attached to every station. On top of membership fees, usage fees vary, but the first 30 minutes are free. It is advisable to wear a helmet and a fluro vest (not mandatory). The bikes are robust, but rather heavy.

By Car Sharing
Uber is fairly inexpensive and a great way to get across town quickly without going up/down metro stairs.

See
A Brussels Card is available for discounts at many attractions. Available in 24 hr (€24), 48 hr (€36) and 72 hr (€43) versions, it offers a free guidebook, free entry to many museums, free use of public transit, and discounts at various shops, restaurants and attractions. May not be worth it to those who already receive discounts (children, students, etc). The card can be purchased on-line in advance for a discount, or at the tourist offices at: Grand-Place, Midi/Zui station, BIP. Some museums also sell the card. 

Landmarks

* Surrounded by the city tower and a range of beautiful 300 year old buildings. In the evening, surrounded by bright illumination, it is simply ravishing. Some evenings a music and light show is provided with the buildings serving as a canvas. Have a "gaufre de Liège-Luikse wafel" here (Belgian waffle with caramelized sugar)—the best ones are available from the little shops off the northeast corner of the Grand Place-Grote Markt.

* Just a short walk from the Grand Place-Grote Markt, in the Stalingrad District, is the Manneken Pis, a small bronze statue thought to represent the "irreverent spirit" of Brussels. This is a statue of a child urinating into a pool. Belgians have created hundreds of outfits for this statue. There are many stories of the statue's origins. It is believed to have been inspired by a child who, while in a tree, found a special way to drive away invading troops. Another story goes that a father was missing his child and made a declaration to the city that when he found him he would build a statue of him, doing whatever it was that he was doing. It has also been said a witch turned him to stone for peeing on her property. The most likely scenario is that it was the location of the market for urine, which was used for its ammonia content to tan leathers. None are definitively true. In 1747, Louis XV's soldiers stole the statue, upsetting many of the city's residents. Louis XV made it up to the city by giving the statue a medal of honor (so that he must be saluted when French soldiers pass by} and by giving him an outfit. He now gets dressed up on special occasions.

* Jeanneke Pis is a modern fountain and statue in Brussels, which forms a counterpoint in gender terms to the city's trademark Manneken Pis at the Grand Place (Grote Markt). It was commissioned by Denis-Adrien Debouvrie in 1985 and erected in 1987 and endowed with its own instant legend, the better to amuse strollers. This half-metre-high statue of blue-grey limestone depicts a little girl with her hair in short pigtails, squatting and urinating, apparently very contentedly. It is located on the east side of the Impasse de la Fidélité / Getrouwheidsgang (Fidelity Alley), a narrow cul-de-sac some 30 metres long leading northwards off the restaurant-packed Rue des Bouchers / Beenhouwersstraat. It is unsurprisingly much less well known than its male counterpart, being a new addition instead of a centuries-old symbol of the city. The sculpture is now protected by iron bars from vandalism

* Parc du Cinquantenaire-Jubelpark - Definitely check out the Arc de Triomphe-Triomfboog on the east side of town. It's in the Parc du Cinquantenaire-Jubelpark. It is possible to go up to the terrasse above the arch, from where you'll have a good view of the city. Entry is through the Royal Museum of the Armed Forces and of Military History and is included in the museum entrance fee (5€, students 4€). Take Metro line 1 east, exit Schuman and walk east or exit Mérode and walk west.

* Unavoidable icon of Brussels and Belgium, important place for international tourism, unique creation in the history of architecture and emblematic vestige of the World Fair in Brussels (Expo 58) the Atomium continues to embody its ideas of the future and universality, half a century later. In its cultural programme it carries on the debate of 1958: What kind of future do we want for tomorrow? Our happiness depends on what? Its recent renovation in 2006 gave its original brightness back, and the new equipment guarantees its durability. Five of the nine spheres are open to the public (so they say, but not really true). One of them is housing a permanent exhibition dedicated to Expo 58 (just some small models of some countries pavilions). Another sphere is dedicated to temporary exhibitions with scientific themes (often closed when there is no exhibition). The upper sphere offers spectacular views of the city of Brussels. When the sky is clear, the view reaches till Antwerp. There is a "kids zone" sphere which staff will happily direct you to even though you can never go in, it is only open to touring schoolchildren, and there is nothing inside except places for kids to sleep. In truth there are only three spheres: the top (restaurant), middle (snack bar) and bottom; the only thing to see really is the view; rather expensive at 11 €. The restaurant, also situated at the top, is open every day till 11.00 p.m. At night, the nine spheres are lit up with 2,970 lights that offer a very special show. To enrich your visit: audioguides in EN (but also in F, NL, ES, IT and RU) are available at the cash desk for 2€. Visio-guides are also available (€2) for the deaf and hard of hearing people. In August 2010, a zip-line was available from the top of the tallest sphere (102m); the "Death Ride" (run by former members of the Belgian Special Services) is a separate 25€, and offers a rather unique view of the insides of the Atomium and the surrounding city.

* Larger than St. Peter's basilica in Rome, it cost 45 million Belgian Francs to construct in 1866.

* The fifth biggest church in the world, with an impressive interior and an amazing view over Brussels and its surroundings. 

* Royal Palace with a park out front.

* Former stock market building. Locals like to sit on the steps, sometimes with fries. A local restaurant owner has proposed turning the unused building into a beer hall.

* Hosts a set of scale models of famous European structures.

* Also referred to as Unity in Peace, this sculpture symbolises peace through European integration, while at the same time aiming to demonstrate the motto of the European Union (EU), United in Diversity. It is located in the garden of Convent Van Maerlant (the library of the European Commission) Van Maerlant street, in the European Quarter of Brussels.

* Just like Antwerp and Amsterdam, Brussels also has its own Red Light District. It is located mainly in Rue d'Aerschot/ Aarschotstraat, behind the North Train Station. Contrary to The Netherlands, prostitution is NOT legal in Belgium, they exploit a loophole in the local legislation presenting brothels as "bars". Do not expect to actually get a drink in there though. Despite heavy police presence, it still remains a fairly seedy area, not the kind of place where you'd want to walk alone at night. 

Museums and Galleries

* This museum has an important collection of art objects from different civilizations from all over the world. The museum was founded in 1835 and was located in the Hallepoort/Porte de Hal, one of the last remaining medieval city gates of Brussels.

* Features both historical art and modern art in the one building. In a vast museum of several buildings, this complex combines the Old Masters Museum (Musée d'Art Ancien-Museum voor Oude Kunst) and the Fin-de-Siècle Museum (modern art museum) under one roof (connected by a passage) - ask for the "Collections" ticket. The collection shows off works, most of them Belgian, from the 14th to the 20th century, starting in the historical section, with Hans Memling's portraits from the late 15th century, which are marked by sharp lifelike details, works by Hiëronymus Bosch, and Lucas Cranach's Adam and Eve. You should particularly seek out the subsequent rooms featuring Pieter Brueghel, including his Adoration of the Magi. Don't miss his unusual Fall of the Rebel Angels, with grotesque faces and beasts. But don't fear, many of Brueghel's paintings, like those depicting Flemish village life, are of a less fiery nature. Later artists represented include Rubens, Van Dyck, Frans Hals, and Rembrandt. Don't miss David's famous "Death of Marat". Next door, in a circular building connected to the main entrance, the modern art section (Fin-de-Siècle Museum) has an emphasis on underground works - if only because the museum's eight floors are all below ground level. The collection includes works by van Gogh, Matisse, Dalí, Tanguy, Ernst, Chagall, Miró, and local boys Magritte, Delvaux, De Braekeleer and Permeke. Furthermore, do not miss the Magritte Museum which contains the largest collection of the surrealist artist's works, paintings, letters and is located in the same museum complex - ask for the "Magritte Museum" ticket.

*Intriguing complex of three buildings in the Laaken area, not far from the Atomium. They comprise a Japanese tower, a Chinese pavilion, and a museum of Japanese art. The architecture and decor may seem over the top to today's tastes, but there are some outstanding examples of Chinese export porcelain, and rotating exhibitions of Japanese artefacts from the Edo period (1600-1868). 
* Features Belgium's history. Before it became a museum, the former 18th century luxury hotel was a royal residence.

* . The museum is well-known for its famous collection of iguanodons (dinosaurs discovered in a coal-mine in Belgium). The dinosaur collection has been refreshed in October 2007 and includes discovery activities for the children. The other parts of the museum are also interesting, as an exhibit of all animals that live in our houses and a collection of mammals.

* The home of noted Belgian Art Nouveau architect and designer Victor Horta. Seeing where he lived and worked is a great way to get an introduction to the art nouveau style in Brussels. It is one of four Horta works to be inscribed on the . It can be very busy on rainy Sundays and the queue is outside, so don't forget your umbrella.

* The Museum is home to some truly remarkable collections. Its collection of ethnographic objects from Central Africa is in fact the only one of its kind in the world. It also contains the entire archives of Henry Morton Stanley which are of great historical value. As of November 2013, the museum is closed for renovation work (including the construction of new exhibition space) which is expected to last until June 2018 when the museum will reopen.

* Located in Europe's earliest Shopping-Mall (a shiny Jugendstil/Art Nouveau palace). There is a permanent exposition featuring the early beginning of comics as well as it's development. There is enough room for other varying expositions. The bookshop at the ground floor sells many different comics. A readers' library operates on the ground floor, where, for a low entrance fee, you can read many different comic books and buy fries.

* A history of film-making.

* Automobiles from the dawn of the motoring age to 1970's including the earliest Mercedes, Renault, BMW Isettas, Tatras, Ford T-birds, even a jeepney from the Philippines.

* The Belgian Army Museum and Museum of Military History occupies the north wing of the Palais Cinquantenaire. It provides an overview of the development of military technology and of the major campaigns fought on Belgian soil. The museum has three principal sections: Belgian military history (documents, uniforms and weaponry from the Middle Ages to the present day, including a most comprehensive collection of medieval arms and armor); the Armored Vehicle Hall with artillery, tanks etc. from the two World Wars; and the Air Section (Brussels Air Museum) with a collection of aircraft from World War I onward. The Brussels Air Museum's high point is its collection of original aircraft from World War I.

* The museum houses more than 7000 instruments, from all times and all over the world. The museum’s reputation is built on its extraordinary collection. The exhibits are displayed on four different floors featuring a wide range of instruments from all time periods and areas of the world. The MIM is a place to experience music. An infrared headphone system allows each visitor to enjoy the sound and melodies played by the instruments presented. The restaurant on the roof is also famous because of its panoramic view over Brussels. You need around 3 or 4 hours to really enjoy the whole museum, make sure you have enough time! The ornate façade of the building was decorated as such to promote the work of local tradesman and to protest the loss of jobs due to automation.

* This museum is dedicated to the life and art of the Belgian artist René Magritte. It holds a multidisciplinary collection containing more than 200 of Magritte's works. Note that signs and labels are in French and Dutch only so English speakers should consider getting the audio guide.

* Dedicated to the craft, folk art, culture and religion of the Jewish people in Belgium.

European Union

Brussels is considered to be the de facto capital of the European Union, having a long history of hosting the institutions of the European Union within its European Quarter.

Breweries

* The last traditional gueuze/lambic brewery in Brussels, Cantillon still uses natural yeast fermentation (not injected like almost every other beer). The lambics and gueuzes are made in original style with no sweeteners or syrups added. Only 100% bio (organic) and natural fruits are used creating a distinctly sour drink. This museum-esque atmosphere is still a functioning brewery. The tour includes two small glasses of lambic and gueuze, and if you've never had a natural beer before, then you will be (pleasantly) surprised by the taste. An absolute must for beer lovers, save room in your luggage to take bottles back with you! 

* Ever wanted to learn how to brew your own Belgian beer at home? This is your chance! BrewSpot offers a Discovery course where you will directly brew a Belgian style beer using malts, hops and yeast. This happens on afternoons (between 1pm and 5pm) in little groups of 10 to 15 people.

You also get to take a few bottles of home-made beers and a booklet with useful brewing information back home! For those who want more, BrewSpot also offer a BrewMaster course where you get additional brewing theory during a consecutive second afternoon. For groups, BrewSpot can organise a special course for you on demand. BrewSpot is also in Paris by the way! For bookings, you need to send an email to contact@brewspot.com

Woluwé-Saint-Pierre

Woluwé-Saint-Pierre is a commune in Brussels. It is mostly a well-to-do residential area, which includes the wide, park-lined, Tervuren Avenue (French: Avenue de Tervueren, Dutch: Tervurenlaan) and the numerous embassies located near the Montgomery Square (Square Montgomery, Montgomeryplein). 

* A museum that is dedicated to the art of binding books, with one of the most prestigious bookbinding collections in the world. Quite interesting. A discovery of forgotten discipline. Amazing use of materials, that unexpectedly gives room to innovation. Open from 10am to 5pm; closed on Mondays and official holidays. 8€ adults, 4€ students, groups and senior citizens. Free on the first Sunday of the month.

* Old trams are regularly used to link the museum to one of Brussels suburbs, Tervuren, through a very nice wooded area. The trip is especially pleasant on a sunny day. From the end station in Tervuren you can go to a nearby old train station that has been converted to a bar and small restaurant named Spoorloos (literally "without tracks"). 

* 

* The imposing modern city hall is open to visitors.

* The town’s main church (Saint Peter) was erected in 1755 on the site of a much older building and perpendicular to it, with funds from the abbey of Forest. Traces of the older building can still be seen on the left of the current church.

* Several turn-of-the-century houses and manors can still be seen today, such as the Stoclet/Stokkel House, a , which was built between 1905 and 1909 on a design by Josef Hoffmann and contains mosaics and paintings by Gustav Klimt.

* Musée du Cinema/Filmmuseum is part of the Center for Fine Arts and features a carefully chosen selection of contemporary and classic arthouse films.

The Bozar Center for Fine Arts

The Paleis voor Schone Kunsten (Dutch) or Palais des Beaux-Arts (French) Rue Ravensteinstraat 23, tel: 02 507 82 0, is often referred to as "Bozar" or "PSK".

Buy

Very few shops in Brussels open before 10AM, and most open about 10:30-11AM. Many shops are closed on Sunday and Monday.

Belgian specialties

Beer
* Claims to have a stock of over 400 beers, but has been overrun by beer tourists. The stock is extensive, but quite pricey in comparison to GB, Delhaize, or Carrefour. Beer Mania is a great place to find out of the ordinary beers.

* Branches around the city carry a wide variety of beers, including almost all Trappist beer. Selection varies by store. The GB in Grand Place has a large selection and offers prices that are approximately a third of the prices in tourist shops.

* Similar to GB/Carrefour, but a tad more expensive.

* Another store similar to GB/Carrefour, but has more of the unusual Belgian beers including Delirium.

* Two very large supermarkets on the outer limits of Brussels. They have a much larger choice of beers than Carrefour/ Delhaize/ Match and some very nice gift boxes but still with reasonable supermarket prices.

Chocolate

* One of the few artisan chocolateries in the heart of Brussels. The shop offers not only delicious chocolate and a awesome praline selection, you can also participate in a workshop or demonstration. 

* very popular with the locals.

* A bit more expensive than Leonidas and a bit higher quality. Very popular with the locals as well. It is also possible to get good discounts by buying directly at the shop outlet outside of the factory (Postweg 2, 1602 Vlezenbeek, tel: 02/568.23.10) which is just on the outer limits of Brussels, just a short walk away from the Erasme/ Erasmus metro station. Prices can go as low as 10€ per kilo, however only the products that are specifically marked as having reduced prices are worth the trip, other products have the exact same price as in local shops.

* Arguably the best Belgian chocolates and priced accordingly. The country-specific products are difficult to find and quite worth the price.

* Another excellent chocolate maker.

* Pick and choose your favorite type of chocolates, all at reasonable prices.

* A great boutique shop with delicious chocolate and friendly service. Stop by for a cup of tea or coffee, and get one of their chocolates free with your tea. Still peckish? You're able to bring a whole box home.

* Not very popular and quite pricey.

* For the frugal, you can buy 100-200 gram gourmet bars of chocolate in grocery stores for about €1 each. Good brands to buy are Côte-d'Or and Jacques, both are Belgian.

Speculoos
* Typical Brussels 'ginger biscuits'. They have a tearoom and several shops throughout the city.

* Branches around the city carry a wide variety of beers, including almost all Trappist beer. Selection varies by store. The GB in Grand Place has a large selection and offers prices that are approximately a third of the prices in tourist shops.

Lace
* among the best in the world. Several shops are located at the Grand' Place-Grote Markt itself. Beware of some shops that sell Belgian lace even though production was outsourced abroad. Ask for a country of origin if purchasing around Grand Place.

Shopping

VAT in Belgium is currently 21%, although for chocolate and books, the reduced VAT rate is 6%.

Non-EU residents are entitled to shop 'tax-free' by claiming their VAT refund at the last point of departure from the EU.

In January 2020, the Belgian government increased the minimum spend requirement for a VAT refund from 50 Euros to 125 Euros.

Shopping centers

* The world's first shopping mall, opened in 1847, is a light and airy triple-gallery enclosing boutiques, bookshops, cafés, restaurants, and a theater and cinema

* Department store (fashion, cosmetics, etc.)

* with GB supermarket at City 2 accessed from Rue Neuve-Nieuwstraat and Metro Rogier.

* Large shopping center in the east of Brussels

Markets
* This flea market offers everything from the weird to the wonderful at rock-bottom prices.

* One of the largest markets in Europe, with a strong North African influence. A great source of fresh fruits and vegetables, and the prices drop to dirt cheap by 13:30. Also a wide selection of clothes and other items. 

* 240 wooden Christmas chalets line the streets looking like gingerbread houses, twinkling with fairy lights and covered with ‘snow-top’ roofs. The chalets sell a variety of Christmas items, decorations, gifts and Christmas season food (including "vin chaud/gluhwein" mulled wine). Activities include a skating rink, a Ferris wheel, and ice dinosaur monster (admission fees). Brass bands, free performances and ice sculptures are also on display.

* 100.000 visitors every weekend makes this market the biggest and most bustling in Brussels. The market is not yet influenced by tourists and may attract the visitor that search for the rough and authentic experience of Brussels

Books

* Right in the center and one of the most up to date stores when it comes to contemporary comics.

* the largest bookshop in Brussels, features a small bar/café inside and quite often live music.

* One of the most popular English bookshops in downtown Brussels.

* maze-like, second-hand bookshop with huge selection of used books at bargain prices. A bookworm's haven.

Eat

There is plenty of good eating to be had in Brussels. Most people concentrate on the three classics: mussels (moules in French and mosselen in Flemish), fries (frites in French and frieten in Flemish) and chocolate. A few more adventurous Bruxellois/Brusselse dishes include anguilles au vert/paling in 't groen (river eels in green sauce), meat balls in tomato sauce, stoemp (mashed vegetables and potatoes) and turbot waterzooi (turbot fish in cream and egg sauce). For dessert, try a Belgian waffle (wafel in Flemish and gauffre in French), also available in a square Brussels version dusted with powdered sugar, and choices of bananas, whipped cream and many other toppings. Although many prefer the round, caramelized version from .

One shall however always bear in mind that it is important to check the prices of food items before ordering, just like what people should do when visiting pubs in France and Soho, London. Beware especially when servers make choices for you. It has been reported that tourists have to pay up to €7 for a litre of sparkling water, costing less than €0.70 in local stores. 

Visitors should also beware of the 'Italian Restaurant Streets' in the tourist and shopping districts. These streets are lined with small Italian restaurants, some offering "3 course meals" for just €12 or 13. They are all run by just a few shop owners and serve unappetizing store purchased food. They will not 'include service' as most all restaurants in Brussels do, and many tourists have reported getting scammed here, especially when not paying with exact change. A common practice is to present you a menu where prices aren't anything near the ones advertised in the windows. Be sure you ask why there is such a price difference BEFORE ordering and do not hesitate to leave if you do not agree with the price. If you were offered a drink and already sipped from your glass before receiving the menu (as is often the case) then just pay for the drink and leave. 

Budget
 

The matter over which establishment serves up the best frites (locally known as fritkots in Flemish and "friterie" in French) remains a matter of heated debate. Some argue that the best frites in Brussels are served at the fritkot near the Barriere de Saint-Gilles, while others defend St-Josse's Martin (Place Saint-Josse/Sint-Joostplein) as the prime purveyor of the authentic Brussels frite just as others claim Antoine (Place Jourdan/Jourdanplein) remains the king of the local french fry. No matter which fritkot you're at, try to be adventurous and have something other than ketchup or mayonnaise on your fries. Of the selection of bizarre sauces you've never seen before, "andalouse" is probably the most popular with the locals. 

FRITKOTS

*Maison Antoine, Place Jourdanplein - tasty fries with a large collection of sauces situated on a square close to the European Parliament. You can eat your fries (frites) in one of the several bars/cafés that carries the sign frites acceptées. Vegetarians be careful. Fries are cooked in Beef fat. Although this place has a very good reputation which can be guessed from the long line of people waiting to be served, purists will tell you that is is certainly not the best place in town to get your fries.

*Chez Martin. The small nondescript fritkot plonked on Place Saint-Josse/Sint-Joost (Saint-Josse-ten-Noode/Sint-Joost-ten-Node) and run by the calm and affable Martin is a serious contender for the best friterie in Brussels. You can eat your frites at the nearby Cafe Gambrinus and wash them down with a pintje or two. Martin is closed since December 26, 2009.

*La Friterie de la Place de la Chapelle, Rue Haute-Hoogstraat (near Les Marolles/Marollen). Another personal choice for the best frites in Brussels: the big chunks of potato, fried golden, and served with the usual dazzling array of sauces.

*La Friterie de la Barrière, Avenue du Parc-Parklaan (just off the Barrière de St-Gilles/Bareel van Sint-Gillis). Golden and crispy frites - just the way they should be. This exterior of this fritkot also serves as mini-museum with several tracts, articles and other literature on the fronts and sides of the shack on the good ol' Belgian frite.

*Friterie Tabora, Rue Taborastraat 2 (near the Bourse). All natural frites with the widest selection of sauces available. It's open almost 24/7 and is a favourite among locals.

Cheap Dining

* Arcadi, Rue d'Aremberg-Aremberglaan 1B, just at the exit of "Galleries de la Reine", in the direction opposite to the Grand-Place - a quirky combination of old and new, the menu ranges all over the place but the reason people flock here is the selection of over 30 sweet and savoury pies (tartes). A slice big enough for a meal, served with salad, costs €7-7.50. Also current special of cafe & slice of pie for €5.

* Mamma Roma, multiple shops: Flagey (Chaussee de Vleurgat-Vleurgatsesteenweg 5), Chatelain/Kastelein (Rue du Page-Edelknaapstraat 5), Place Jourdan/Jourdanplein, cimetière d'Ixelles/begraafplaats van Elsene (chaussée de Boondael-Boondaalsesteenweg, 467), and other locations. Small pizzeria for eat-in (bar-style seating) or takeaway, sold by weight. Delicious crunchy base and some unusual toppings (one was spicy with walnuts, very tasty). Long queues but speedy service, deals available for pizza + drinks.

* Food Box, Rue Gretry/straat 47 (Brussels centrum) Youthful, clean, no-fuss eatery with a selection of healthy and tasty dishes whipped up fresh using quality local ingredients by the establishment's friendly crew. Best time to drop in is after the lunch-hour rush.

* Snack Pizzeria Porte de Halle, Avenue Henri Jaspar-Henri Jasparlaan, 134, directly across the city ring from Porte de Halle-Halsepoort. The gentlemen running the place speak a little bit of English and serve the best donar kebap and pizza in the neighborhood. The #39-Pizza Porte De Halle is probably their best pizza. Tel. 02/534 0051; Open 11:00 - 23:00 w/free delivery on orders over €10

*Tapas Locas, Rue Marche au Charbons-Kolenmarktstraat 74. Crazy tapas, sensible prices. Some tapas include miniaturised Belgian favourites as well as the usual Spanish suspects.

Mid-range
 

Brussels' tourist restaurant gauntlet can be found in Rue des Bouchers-Beenhouwerstraat, just to the north of Grand Place. The place has a very bad reputation for waiters imposing themselves on passers-by, luring customers into their restaurant and then cheating them. The authorities are aware of this, and are trying to take measures. Some restaurants may also tempt you with cheap prices for the menus, but when seated, the item on the menu happens to be unavailable, and you're forced to accept another, noticeably more expensive dish. Often, the exaggerated price of the wines will also compensate for the attractive menu. Knowing this however, you may be able to negotiate a better deal before entering. However, while you may feel that you have struck a clear deal, be extremely wary: the waiters have a wide range of tricks that will inflate the price. If you pay what you think you owe and then leave, a waiter will run after you. The best thing is to avoid the Rue des Bouchers; Brussels has many very good restaurants, with passable to good service, so there is no reason to visit this street.

If fatigue keeps you in the Rue des Bouchers area, these are restaurants that are recommended:

* Restaurant Vincent, Rue des Dominicains 8-10, 1000 Brussels. A very attractive, old-style restaurant popular with Belgians themselves, with the cooking done in full view of the customers. The tiling adds to the ambiance. 

* Scheltema, Rue des Dominicains-Predikherenstraat 7, +32 2 512 2084. Specializes in fresh and tasty seafood.

* Aux Armes de Bruxelles, Rue des Bouchers-Beenhouwerstraat 13, +32 2 511 5550. Closed Mondays. Basic honest food, including some very decent moules. Crowded, although worth the wait.

Beyond Rue des Bouchers, some restaurants stand out from the crowd:

* Si Bemol, Bloemenstraat-Rue aux Fleurs 20, +32 2 219 63 78. Open from 7PM on till usually 5AM. Closed Sundays. Small but nice, friendly, of the beaten path local place. Lots of dedicated pictures on the wall from French and Belgian performing artists from the 60s and 70s. Basic honest Brussels and Belgian fare. 

* Au Pré Salé, 20, Rue de Flandre-Vlaamsesteenweg (near St Catherine square), +32 2 513 6545. A former butcher shop, locals flock here for some of the best moules in town, sold by the kilo (figure on €24) and served up in half a dozen ways. Also serves the full range of other Brussels favorites.

* Le Beau Soleil, Rue Joseph Lebeaustraat 7 (Sablon area). This tiny restaurant (approx. 14 seats) looks like a violin workshop, so you sit next to all the tools and half finished violins. Unlike other Belgian restaurants, it is open from 9AM to 5PM (Mo-Fr), 9AM to 6PM (Sat,Sun), closed on Wednesday. The menu is small but really delicious. The atmosphere is informal and friendly.

* Les Brassins, Rue Keyenveld-Keienveldstraat 36, Ixelles-Elsene, +32 2 512 6999. Its crowd is mostly made out of young couples or students. Rich choice of beer, with more than 50 varieties on the menu, and good quality of food.

* T Kelderke, Grand'Place, 15 Grote Markt, +32 2 513 7344. €9-19 main courses. €8.50 Plat du jour. Well-made typical Belgian fare. Try the carbonnades à la flamande (Flemish beef stew) & mussels. Note that this place can feel cramped when full of diners.

* Les Chapeliers, Rue des Chapeliers 1-3 Hoedenmakersstraat, +32 2 513 6479. Just off the Grote Markt with reasonable prices and excellent food. Seems to be popular among the locals without full of tourists.

Close to the Bourse Jules Van Praetstraat (rue Jules Van Praet) is another rapidly developing street of restaurants and bars. Those of note include:

* Buddhasia, +3225129541. Nice place to eat Thai food. Also has a few dishes for vegetarians. at Jules Van Praetstraat/Rue Jules Van Praet, 16 1000 Bruxelles. Opposite the Bourse. With the Bourse to your back and McDs road on the right. Its in the lane on left info@buddhasia.be Open from Monday to Sunday, food served from noon to midnight Saturday and Sunday, Lounge Bar open till 2 a.m. Reasonably priced. €5(for Soups) - 10€ - 13€ (for Main dishes).

Drink

Belgium is to beer what France is to wine, it is home to one of the greatest beer traditions in the world, and Brussels is a great place to sample some of the vast variety on offer. Typical beers of Brussels are gueuze (rather sour) and kriek (rather sweet, cherry based).

Smoking is prohibited in all bars.

A special drink only found in Brussels is the "half-en-half" ("half and half"). It's a mixture of white wine and champagne.

Stay safe

Although Brussels is the political capital of the EU, petty crime is quite common. There is little violent crime, particularly as far as tourists are concerned. It is important to be aware of your belongings and be aware of your surroundings. Many suburban neighborhoods have a very poor reputation, but most travelers are unlikely to visit them. The neighborhoods of Schaarbeek, Brussels North, St-Josse, Marollen, Anneessens, Molenbeek and Anderlecht are neighborhoods that should be avoided at night if possible, most often by inhabitants that do not live there.

Between midnight and 6AM you should also be more attentive in the city center, particularly when walking alone. 

Pickpockets - by far the biggest issue - can be found in many areas of the city, especially in train and metro stations, and warmer days when tourists and locals love to sit outside to eat or have a coffee. You just need to take normal precautions against bag snatches. 

When traveling to Brussels by car, ensure to not leave any valuables while visiting various sites - particularly the Atomium, mini Europe and the Oceade area. Cars are common targets, and foreign license plates or goods on the (back)seat increase the risk of attracting undesired interest. 

In the evening and at night, dark areas such as parks attract drug dealers and addicts, pickpockets, and various other shady types. Travelers should avoid these areas after sunset, and be particularly alert for distractions aimed at diverting attention from their hand or shopping bag. Particularly popular at the moment seems to be the "soccer move distraction", when they suddenly stick their foot between your legs as if they are playing an imaginary soccer game.

Be careful with laptops and electronics like smart phones, mp3 players and tablets on public transport. These items can be snatched out of traveler's hands during the short interval the doors are open at a stop, eliminating the chance for a pursuit. Or they will be taken from your pocket without you realizing it. 

The Main stations such as the North Station (Gare du Nord), Central Station, and the South Station (Gare du Midi), which probably has the worst reputation among the local residents, are hot zones for pickpockets. 

In the Parc de Bruxelles/Warandepark, between the Royal Palace and the Belgian Parliament, criminals have been noted threatening their victims with violence. Do not leave your bags unattended but keep them close to your body. If you are robbed, there is a police office right next to the gate in front of the Belgian Parliament (on the right side when leaving the park, hidden in the bushes) where experienced policemen will help you. Most of them speak French, Dutch and English well. However, police can do little to recover your goods, and will most likely provide you with a report for your insurance company. Due to the large number of daily cases, the Belgian police is not known for being the most helpful when it comes to recovering stolen goods, especially if these events occurred in areas known to be dangerous.

In addition to the above advice be aware of Brussels Midi-Zuid train station, one of the poorest areas in the city. In other train stations, especially the North station, scam artists show up in groups trying to distract you with some questions and steal your belongings. They are professionals, and business travelers are often targeted, although anybody is a potential victim, especially if they have electronic valuables (smartphones), that can be easily snatched. Outside the central station, there are men with red vests asking for donations, or signatures, or trying to sell you some community paper. Ignore them if they approach you, or walk away from them. These individuals are very persistent and they will try to show you a badge to show that they are "legit", but if you stop to sign papers or give them a donation, another one will empty out your pockets. This type of scam is very common in many European cities. 

Like any city Brussels is home to a number of infamous street gangs, with the notorious Black Wolves being one of them. These groups operate outside the law, and employ violence against individuals as well as police officers. 

Another overlooked issue regards driving. Because of the often confusing urban planning of Brussels, most Brussels streets are small for a major city. What would be labelled a one-way street in Paris and London is usually a two-way street in Brussels. This leads to some of the worst traffic jams in Europe and aggressive drivers. It is not uncommon for people to not indicate when they are changing lanes or turning. Pedestrians always have the right of way.
