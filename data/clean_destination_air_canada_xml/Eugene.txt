Eugene (pop. ~140,000) is a city in at the southern end of the that is best known for being the home of the University of Oregon.

Understand

Citizens of Eugene are environmentally aware people who love their coffee as well as their microbrew. Residents range from arch-conservative republicans to militant anarchists of the kind who were responsible for the WTO riots in Seattle. However, overall the population is typical Pacific Northwest, i.e., leaning toward a greater degree of social responsibility, respect for nature, and diminished consumerism. Eugene is home to the University of Oregon, aka "The Fighting Ducks." Eugene was the second home to the rock band The Grateful Dead, thus the reason some people see this city as a "Hippie Mecca." 
Saturday Market has been continuously in operation since 1970, rain or shine and claims to be the oldest open-air market of its type in the United States.

*Oregon Ducks — The teams representing the University of Oregon, competing in the Pacific-12 Conference, are Eugene's most famous contribution to the sports world. Ducks sports have benefited enormously from the financial support of Phil Knight, UO alum and head of Oregon-based sports equipment giant Nike. Currently, the highest-profile Oregon team is the football team, which rose to become a perennial national contender in the early 2000s and also (in)famous for its highly colorful and variable uniforms. Oregon also has am extremely rich tradition in track and field, with Hayward Field known for its enthusiastic fans; the city has become known as "Track Town USA" because of this. The main sporting venues (including Hayward Field) are all on campus. The football stadium, Autzen Stadium, is famous as one of the loudest and most intimidating venues in American sports. In 2011, the basketball teams moved to the new Matthew Knight Arena (nicknamed "Matt Arena"; named for Phil's son, who died in a scuba diving accident). Ducks baseball, revived in 2009 after nearly 30 years, plays at PK Park (not named for Knight), which is shared with the minor-league professional Eugene Emeralds.

Hiking & Biking
Eugene is a friendly city for cyclists and all outdoors enthusiasts. There are many well-maintained hiking trails, and bike lanes are designated on most major roads.

*Spencer Butte 
A large butte just south of downtown. Head south on Willamette Street; the trailhead is easy to miss, but it's on the top of a crest in the road on the left-hand side. There is a large parking lot with signs and restrooms. Trail to the summit is close to 2 miles up, with about a 700-foot elevation gain. Trail is well-marked until about ¼ mile below the summit -- which then requires a bit of rock scrambling. 

*Skinner Butte 
A small butte just north of downtown. Original site of Eugene Skinner's cabin after which the town is named. This butte offers an excellent view of Eugene, and the Cascade mountains to the east. This butte was also the site of a scene from the movie Animal House. To reach the butte, head north on Pearl St. until you pass the large retirement home on your left, turn left at the next street (in between 3rd St. and 2nd St., unmarked) and after 1/4 of a mile make a right (unmarked). To get there by foot, you can hike up a trail opposite the train station and next to a Victorian styled house. If the weather is nice, you can go rock climbing at the natural basalt columns on the butte, or hike on some trails near the peak.

*Ridgeline trail 
Extensive set of hiking trails south of town. To find them, head south on Willamette St., one mile south of the post office, and shortly after 52nd street make a left at the trailhead parking lot.

Stay Safe

It is highly unlikely that you will become the victim of a violent crime while in Eugene. However, the city currently faces many issues with respect to drug use, property crime, and most notably to tourists, bicycle theft. If you are to turn your back on bicycles, backpacks, or other personal belongings, you can reasonably assume them to be gone. 

While violent crime rates remain low, visitors should expect to interact with homeless people and street youth while in the downtown and campus neighborhoods, as the city has one of the highest homeless rates in the U.S. Neighborhoods where poverty and property crimes are especially high are the Whiteaker, Downtown, Four Corners (where Hwy 99 and Roosevelt intersect), and certain parts of Springfield. Visitors may also be subjected to uncomfortable surroundings near the Washington-Jefferson Skate Park underneath Hwy 105 in the Whiteaker, where open drug use is common and vagrants congregate.
