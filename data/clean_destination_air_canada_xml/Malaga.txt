The main bus station is right across the street from the train station, a km or so west of the city centre on Paseo de los Tilos. The station serves buses from all over Spain and is a major transfer point if you're passing through this region.

A substation, the Muelle Heredia bus station, is located along Avenida de Manuel Agustin Heredia, adjacent to the port and handles many of the regional buses that serve the Malaga province, such as those going to nearby beach towns, many of which are operated by the Malaga Metropolitan Transport Consortium

Public transport from the airport: you can get a train, a bus or a taxi into town, or hire a car. Bus no. A costs €3 and is very convenient, running every 30 minutes and stopping at Alameda Principal and Paseo del Parque, where most of the local buses that serve the city stop as well. The stop names are shown on an electronic display inside the bus so you can tell when to get off. Bus A also stops at the coach station (beside the train station). Note that this bus used to be called nr. 19. The airport's Train station is opposite arrivals terminal 3, trains to Malaga Centro costs €2.30 (March 2023 one way into Malaga Centro (final stop), leaving from Platform 2. It runs every 20 minutes, taking approximately 12 minutes into Malaga Centro. 

Walking from the airport: The beach is only 5 km away from the airport. To get there by foot, exit the terminal at the lower level. Walk south-east past the abandoned terminal 1. Cross the N-348 at the roundabout (Dangerous!). Continue south-east along the N-348. At the end of the street turn left and pass underneath the MA-23. Use the footbridge to get on the other side of the N340 / MA-21 and continue north-east. After you've crossed the river Guadalhorce, turn right and follow the river on a sand path.

Cycling in Malaga
Málaga is making big improvements when it comes to cycling. Nowadays Malagueños use their bikes more often to go to work or for recreational use in the weekends. Also Málaga established a cycling association supported by the local public transport association. The use of bicycles is promoted as being eco-friendly, fun, safe and healthy. Promotional campaigns in the form of group cycle activities or excursions outside Málaga are being introduced and this has led to big success.

Meanwhile Málaga also constructed several bike lanes. Due to this construction the centre is also better connected with the Northern part of the city. The historical centre of Málaga is already free of motorized vehicles, which makes cycling much safer than in the past. Also spots like the boulevard and the harbor are only accessible for pedestrians and cyclists. This two kilometers long boulevard is wide enough for cyclists to enjoy and cycle in a relaxing fashion.

Besides cycling in the city the coast area of Málaga is also worth exploring by bike. Going east from Malaga is probably the most popular route as its possible to travel along a route through the twin traditional fishing villages of Pedregalejo and El Palo all the way to the end of Rincon De La Victoria without going on the main road. Traveling west along the coast is not quite as straightforward, for example biking from Málaga to Torremolinos is a popular route but it is difficult to find a good route away from busy highways but it is possible. 

Cycling inland north from Málaga is characterized by steep climbs with little in the way of long easy winding routes. The Montes de Malaga is probably the most notable mountain route from the city where an elevation of over 900m can be reached in less than 15Km, this route is known locally as "The Reina" and is not for the lazy cyclist. Other notable climbs include a section known locally as "The Wall" which is a terrifying descent or climbers challenge depending on what direction its cycled. "The Wall" is a 9Km section between Moclinejo and Almáchar (this is the terrifying descent direction) on an inland route from Malaga to the coastal resort of Torre Del Mar. 

An alternative mountain route for the committed cyclist is around the "Sierra de Mijas". Initially the route goes west from Malaga on quite a busy main road past the airport, then up a steep country road to the white villages of Benalmadena Pueblo and Mijas Pueblo, dropping down then to Alhaurin el Grande and back on the north side of Sierra de Mijas to Malaga via Alhaurin de la Torre.

See

* A Moorish castle built in the 11th century on a hill in the middle of the city, this old fort is the best-preserved of its kind in Spain. Upon entering you'll climb up past the ramparts offering excellent views of the city and lush gardens to a small Moorish palace at the top which holds a number of artifacts from excavations on the site.

* Situated under the Alcazaba facing a small plaza are the beautiful remains of an old Roman theater. You can view them anytime from the overlook in the plaza, but if you want to get up close you can enter the attached building, where you'll be shown a short film and view some artifacts before entering the theater itself, where you can walk past the old stage and sit on the stone steps.

* Another Moorish castle and the counterpart to the Alcazaba, the Castillo sits on a larger hill behind the Alcazaba and offers an incredible view of the city and neighboring suburbs from the ramparts that encircle the castillo. Within the fortress is a set of gardens and some displays, including an exhibit on the various military forces to have occupied the fort. Between the Castillo and the Alcazaba, visit the Alcazaba if you only have time for one, as the Castillo requires a hefty hike or a bus ride up the mountain.

* Located right in the heart of the city centre and well worth visiting.

* Exclusive paintings and exhibitions.

* Loads of objects and some paintings that the most famous artist of the 20th century created during his childhood.

* Opened in 2011 and has an excellent collection of 19th and 20th Century Spanish paintings.

* Located in a former wholesale trade market, it houses a good collection of works of art and installations. Guided visits.

Do
*Rock Climb. There is lots of great rock climbing in and around Malaga. The amazing El Chorro gorge is 50 minutes drive to the North West and this also features the 'Kings Walkway' - an amazing pathway suspended high above the gorge. There is also Via Ferrata and rock climbing at El Torcal near Antequerra. 

*Beaches: The nearest beach to the centre is La Malagueta - this is fine for a days sunbathing although quieter and prettier beaches can be found further east. It can be a nice (if rather long!) walk along the waterfront to reach these beaches, otherwise you could get a bus from near the bull ring in the direction of El Palo (e.g. line 33).

Buy

*Librería de Idiomas, on the Plaza de la Merced. A valuable resource, offering textbooks and dictionaries for learning just about any European language you could desire.

*The market is north of the Alamada Principal and is well worth a visit.

*Ricardo del Cid Fernandez (aka. Del Cid), Calle Caldereria 11, is a fantastic old school hat shop in the old town (selling real sombreros, panama hats, etc.). Worth to visit even just because of the atmosphere and the very helpful owner.

Eat
Along the coast there are dozens of restaurants and chiringuitos (beach restaurants) where you can have fish, seafood, paella, sangria, etc. One of the most famous chiringuitos is El Tintero, at the east end, where there is no menu: the waiters sing out what they are carrying and they leave you a plate at your signal. From time to time, one of them offers to give you the bill.

The most typical thing to eat in Malaga is espetos, sardines skewered on a bamboo stick and grilled over a fire (typically driftwood); and pescaíto frito: all types of deep-fried fish from anchovies to squid. A specialty of Andalucia is fish (most commonly dogfish "cazon", although sometimes other fish such as tuna, "atun") marinated in a garlic and vinegar preparation - look on the menu for "Cazon en adobo". Try also the coquinas (small clams cooked in white wine). Simply delicious! Jamon is a regional specialty, and is an aged, salted ham, from acorn-fed pork, similar to prosciutto.

Famous sweet Malaga wine can be tasted in popular pubs in the city center, like the famous old La Casa del Guardia (Avenue Alameda Principal) or the very typical El Pimpi where everyone, from celebrities to local teens meet.

For good food against competitive prices, try the port area. The eastern quay is littered with restaurants competing for your patronage. They generally offer good food at mild rates. With Italian, Spanish, Mexican and Indian cuisine only being a few random examples from the wide range of restaurants, there's bound to be something to your liking. As a bonus, if you sit outside, you can look out over the water while enjoying your meal. If all you see is bars instead of restaurants, you are too northerly. The restaurants are along the southern stretch of the quay. 

*Typical andalusian tavern evironment, Sweet Malaga wines and the most traditional tapas.

*Cafetería Córdoba 7, Situated in street Córdoba, nº 7 in Málaga center, between the Port and Alameda Principal. Offers traditional and typical andalucian dishes, including soups, salads, meats and fishes or sandwiches, cakes, croissants or baguettes. Star dishes include: Gazpacho andaluz, Paella, Porra Antequerana, Rabo de Toro, Croquetas caseras, and many more. Breakfasts and meals with inexpensive prices.

*Restaurante Gallego Candamil. Cuarteles 15. Tel.:+34 95 232-3907. On the street leading from the train station to the centre, this Galician restaurant is very popular with the locals. This is understandable when you see the great range of quality tapas at fantastic prices, e.g. tapa of empanada €1.25, glass of cider €1.15.

*A Casa Gallega. Fernán Núñez 2. Tel.: +34 95 204-2332. Another Galician haunt a little further towards, although still outside, the center, this one does not have any menu but relies on the clientele knowing what they want. Good empanada, pimientos de Padrón. Atmospheric.

*Parador de Málaga Gibralfaro, Castillo de Gibralfaro, Tel.: +34 95 222-1902, Some report being disappointed by the restaurant at the Parador. The food was sub par, but the service by contrast was exemplary, together with all the nice little free appetizers, aperitifs, etc. Wine list tended towards the expensive but with the excellent idea of a monthly wine choice 'balancing quality and value', for example a very palatable Ribera del Duero Crianza at €10. Set menu €27 pp (plus VAT). Fantastic view of the city, especially from the terrace.

*Las Garrafas. Calle Méndez Núñez 6. Tel.: +34 95 222-3589. Winery and "taperia". Typical Málaga cuisine in a large and clean locale. Delicious and reasonably-priced food. Especially recommended are the mouth-watering "albondigones," large meatballs served alongside french fries.

*Loving Hut. Calle Peregrino No.2. Tel.: +34 95 235-1521. Chinese vegetarian food, EUR7.95 Buffett open 13:00 - 16:00 & 20:30 - 23:00 near Malaga Centro underground metro station.

*A base of the Andalusian recipes dishes from countries that are part of the Mediterranean Sea, especially from France and Italy..

Drink
