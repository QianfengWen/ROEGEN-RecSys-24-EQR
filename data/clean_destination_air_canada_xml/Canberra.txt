Canberra is the capital city of . The city is located in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), an enclave in the south-east of New South Wales. 

Canberra is a planned city, with national monuments, museums and galleries built around a large artificial lake. As a bush capital, Canberra is also a great place to enjoy the outdoors, with excellent cycling, gardens, parks, bushwalking and nature reserves.

Understand

History
Canberra was established in 1913 as the capital for the newly federated Australian nation. The ACT was excised from and put under the control of the federal government. The creation of the planned city was not without critics who claimed it was a "waste of a good sheep pasture". 

Canberra's design was conceived by the American architects Walter Burley and Marion Mahony Griffin, built on the shores of an artificial lake (Lake Burley Griffin). Populated at first largely by politicians and public servants, it took time to develop its own identity and culture. Extensive building of national facilities and a concerted effort to develop public institutions in the city have made it an interesting destination.

Geography
Lake Burley Griffin divides central Canberra. The central shopping and commercial area, known as "Civic", is on the north side and the parliamentary triangle and embassy area is on the south side. National institutions are likewise divided, examples being the National Museum of Australia and the Australian War Memorial on the north side and the National Library and National Gallery of Australia on the south side.

There are suburbs surrounding central Canberra, and also suburbs surrounding several outlying town centres. These town centres are, Belconnen and Gungahlin to the north, and Tuggeranong and Woden to the south. The ACT also has surrounding towns, such as , which boasts a strong cool climate wine selection. The historic village of is also on the outskirts of Canberra.

It had a population of 395,790 people at the time of the 2016 Census 

Time
Australian Capital Territory follows the same time as that surrounds it. It's 10 hours ahead of GMT (UTC+10) and 11 hours ahead (UTC+11) during daylight saving (first Sunday in October and ends the first Sunday in April).

People
Many people who live in Canberra are not originally from Canberra, having usually moved there to study or take up employment with the Australian Government. A common pattern is that people from other parts of Australia move to Canberra, study or work for a few years and then return to their place of origin or move on to elsewhere. As this means a constant influx of new arrivals to Canberra, you should not be reluctant to ask for directions and the like from locals - they are more than used to it and usually only too happy to help.

Canberrans on the whole are easygoing, friendly and tolerant people who have the highest levels of education and income in Australia.

Ethnically, Canberra's population is more diverse than most regional areas of Australia, but nowhere near as culturally and linguistically varied as and .

Climate

Canberra can get just as hot as anywhere else in Australia during the summer months, with temperatures above 30ºC a frequent occurrence from December through to March. It can get bitterly cold during the winter months (June-August) owing to its altitude and proximity to the . Overnight temperatures in winter frequently drop below zero and tend to hover slightly above 10ºC during the day. However, it is usually a clear, brisk cold, and rarely a dull, damp cold. 

Canberra is less humid than Australian coastal cities. The hottest days are often mitigated by welcome, cooling, mountain breezes, particularly towards the end of the day, and the temperature drops overnight.

Visitor Centre
The comprehensive visitor centre has recently moved to Regatta Point on the north shore of Lake Burley-Griffin. It shares a building with the National Capital Exhibition. ☎ +61 2 6205-0044.

By plane
 Canberra International Airport () is well served by flights from other Australian capital cities. Its always been known as Canberra International Airport, although international flights only resumed in 2016 after a long absence. 

There are flights almost hourly to and frequent flights to . Other capitals may see only a morning and evening flights. A flight from Sydney to Canberra only saves an hour or so over driving from Sydney and for those who are not coming from an area close to Sydney Airport, air travel offers only a marginal time saving.

* Virgin Australia flies to and from , , the , , , and .
* Qantas flies to and from Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Adelaide, Darwin and .

ACTION buses, the local public bus company, has recently added an airport service. Routes 11 and 11A leave at least every half hour during operating times and travel directly to the City Bus Station. The services are still somewhat erratic, and the last service is in the early evening, so best to check the timetable Tickets are $4, including a transfer. There is a private bus service provided by the Royale Group for $10 one way into the city, with no discount for return.

Taxis are available in front of the terminal towards the Qantas end for around $25 to Civic.

It is possible to use Canberra's offroad cycleway network to access the airport. Follow the cycleway along the north side of the lake. A section of cycleway was recently completed alongside the Molonglo River underneath the Monaro Highway Bridge which veers left and passes underneath the Pialligo Avenue bridges. Turn right, cross the creek (beware of the gravel surface at this point), cross over Fairbairn Avenue, use the airport service road through the airport precinct, and make your way to the terminal.

There is a long stay and short stay car park, both within walking distance of the terminal. Expect to pay around $17 per day to park at the long stay. The long stay is cheaper than the short stay only if you park for a day or more. 

There are convenient scheduled international services to Singapore and Wellington, New Zealand, on Singapore Airlines. International visitors can also fly to , or and transfer to connecting flights. There are coach services to Canberra non-stop and direct from Sydney International Terminal taking around 3.5 hours. The last coach leaves Sydney airport at 19.15 Monday to Wednesday, 20.15 Thursday to Saturday, and 21.15 on Sunday.

By train

NSW Countrylink runs from to Canberra three times a day, morning, midday and afternoon, every day in both directions. The trip takes just over 4 hours, which is slower than a bus or driving, but the train takes a very scenic route through the and the Molongolo Gorge, compared to an unexciting freeway journey by road. The train arrives in Kingston on the south side of Canberra, a pleasant 25-30 minute walk from the closest of the attractions on the south side of Lake Burley Griffin. Buses connect the station to Civic (the Canberra CBD) on the northern side of the lake, ACTION buses pass the station every 15 minutes on weekdays (routes 200 and 80) and every hour on weekends (route 980). Cash fares cost $5, and are good for anywhere in Canberra for 1.5 hours. The tap on tap off MyWay card is much cheaper especially off peak and weekends. Taxis and coaches to further destinations meet each train arrival. It is possible to do a day trip from and get 5-6 hours to spend in Canberra. Bicycles must be boxed and checked as luggage on CountryLink services and cost $12.10 per bicycle, and there is room for only three on any train.

The economy train fare is $40 year round, bookings are essential but the train is rarely fully booked except around annual holidays, There are no discounts except for seniors, students, unemployed and people on disability pensions, who pay half fare.

If you are enthusiastic about train travel, desperate to save money, travelling from and wish to see on the way, the Cityrail train to Goulburn costs $10.80, and the Countrylink train from Goulburn to Canberra costs as little as $10.

Countrylink also runs a once-daily train/bus between and Canberra: the bus runs from the centre of Canberra (City Bus Interchange) via the Barton Highway, Burley Griffin Way and the Olympic Highway to the town of , where travellers switch to the XPT (Countrylink Train) to Melbourne's Southern Cross Station; tickets cost $91 in off-peak and $107 in peak season. 

V/Line runs an alternative train/bus service between and Canberra: the bus runs from the Jolimont Centre coach terminal (across the road from the City Bus Interchange). This service is called Canberra Link. The bus runs to Wodonga, from there a V/Line train will take you through to Melbourne's Southern Cross Station. Northbound, the reverse applies, train from Melbourne to Wodonga or Albury and bus to Canberra. Tickets cost $46. This is the better option and takes eight hours. You can travel with or without reservation but reservation guarantees you a seat on both the coach and train.

V/Line also run a Canberra service via the NSW and Victorian south east coast to connect with the Melbourne train at . This service is called Capital Link. Services run twice a week (three times a week during Victorian school holidays). At Bairnsdale, a road coach will take you via Orbost, Cann River and Cooma to Canberra, with stops at Canberra Railway Station (Kingston) and the Jolimont Centre (across the road from the City Bus Interchange). Tickets on this service also cost $46.

By bus
All coaches to Canberra stop at the Jolimont Centre, in the city centre and immediately across the road from the Canberra local bus (ACTION) interchange. The burgers at the Coach station are worth trying, for their sheer size.

Murrays tel 132251, Murrays operate up to 10 daily express services between Sydney (Central Station) and Canberra with extra services on peak days. They are the main operator on this route. Service takes 3h30min, bookings are between $35 (non-changeable) to $41 (fully flexible, you can rebook on another bus up to half an hour before the journey). The service is non-stop (with some services via Sydney International Airport). Murrays also run a daily service from Canberra to Wollongong and Canberra to Narooma. The coaches are more cramped than the trains. Seats are unassigned, so it helps to be there early and not to have luggage to go under the bus, as that lets you get on first and secure your window seat. Buses often fill to capacity, and can experience delays due to peak traffic into and out of Sydney, although the non-stop nature means that they have been known to run 10-15 minutes early on a good run.

Greyhound Pioneer tel 131499, operate a bus service competing with Murray's. Fares seem to be either $15 or $36, so you might get lucky and get a cheap ride. Note that it may not be possible to get the $15 fares when booking a return journey; if so, you probably need to book each leg separately. They also offer a direct service to . Greyhound's coach services usually include video entertainment. The Greyhound services have stops which make the service slower than Murrays'.

NSW Countrylink also run daily buses to and from on the South Coast, via and .

By car
The drive from to Canberra is 290 km and takes around three and a half hours from the Sydney CBD, less from outer suburbs in Sydney. The road is dual-carriageway, mostly freeway-like conditions from the Harbour Bridge all the way to Canberra, mostly with a 110km/h speed limit, via the M5 Motorway, Hume and Federal Highways. There are three sets of on-road services located on the Hume Highway between Sydney and the turn-off to the Federal Highway to Canberra, as well as many well-maintained and often scenic rest stops with toilets and picnic tables ideal for a picnic. Take drinks, as the rest areas have no water, or tank water which is not recommended for drinking. A third option which will enable you to see more of the countryside is to stop at one of the small towns in the on the way which will have a cafe or two.

It is rare to make the entire trip between Canberra and Sydney without at least one police speed trap. The city of Goulburn, on the way to Canberra, is the training centre for New South Wales police officers and often send new recruits to run speed checks on the freeway. There are also several fixed speed traps, all of which are signposted in advance.

The drive from to Canberra is 650 km and takes roughly eight hours on the Hume and Barton Highways, again mostly on dual-carriageway roads.

Get around

While Canberra on the whole is not walkable by any standards, some parts of it, including Civic and the central part of the northern shore of Lake Burley Griffin, as well as the sights at the southern shore of Lake Burley Griffin, are possible to tackle on foot.

For transfers between suburbs, the best options are the bus, the car, and the bicycle.

By bus

ACTION buses cover the majority of Canberra. 

Fares are $4.90 for adults and $2 for concessions. An all-day ticket costs $9.00 for adults and $3.80 for concessions. If spending more than $20 on tickets, you may want to consider purchasing a MyWay stored value card. It offers discounts on single tickets, monthly and weekend all-day travel. However, there is no discount on weekday all-day tickets. 

The inter-town routes are frequent and reliable, especially during peak hour, but are often crowded. Other services can be infrequent, particularly in the off-peak and weekends. Check timetables carefully. 

Tips for riding the buses:
* If you need to change buses to get somewhere, ask for a transfer ticket; it will let you on to as many buses as you need within 90 min of getting on the first bus.
* Tell the driver where you need to get to, and ask them what your options are. Some buses snake through the suburbs and can take a while to cover a relatively short distance while others may be more direct or express services.
* To travel between the interchanges (Belconnen, Civic, Woden and Tuggeranong), catch any bus in the 300 series (300, 312, 313, 314, 315, 318 or 319) as these are much faster than other buses. Note that this service runs as 900 on weekends and public holidays.
* Buses do not operate between midnight and 6 a.m. Monday to Saturday or after 7 p.m. on Sundays and public holidays.
* Many buses (including inter-town routes) have a push-bike rack on the front, and the passenger can put the bike there to get to another bike-friendly destination.

By bike
Bicycles are a practical way to get around Canberra while visiting, and will get you to most attractions using a well developed network of off-road cycle paths. Functional bicycles can be bought cheaply from The Green Shed at the Resource Management Centre (tip) at Mugga Lane, Symonston and Flemington Road, Mitchell, expect to spend around $30 and bring an air pump and puncture repair kit. 

Canberra also has generally well developed on-road cycle facilities but the on-road cycle lanes do sometimes end and start in utterly inexplicable places. The grade can be a little steep as away from central Canberra is fairly hilly, but all the attractions around the lake are accessible on fairly flat paths. Pedal Power has a list of commuter and other routes. Bicycles are also permitted on footpaths in the ACT (except when passing shops during trading hours).

There are bike racks to lock your bike up at most shopping centres and points of interest. Bike helmets are compulsory.

The intertown buses will carry two bikes on bike racks on the front of the buses. The bike racks have clips, so no additional equipment is necessary. Only 20" tyres or larger bikes are carried. There is no charge for using the bike rack. Kids must be accompanied by adults, and child seats and other accessories must be removed from the bike.

A bicycle path map bought from a visitor information, petrol station or newsagent also shows bike paths and on-road cycle lanes. The map is also online at the ACT Department of Planning 

By car

Most attractions in Canberra provide parking at no extra cost, However paid parking (AUD$9.50-$14 daily) has recently been implemented within the central suburbs. Canberra roads are generally of excellent quality and relatively uncongested.

The default speed limit on all roads in the ACT is 50km/h, unless signposted otherwise. Major roads in the ACT will have 60-100km/h speed limits in 10km/h intervals. There is little rhyme or reason regarding how a speed limit is set in the ACT, with similar roads having vastly different speed limits. In some situations, the same road will have a different speed limit for traffic heading in oposite directions. Speed limit signs within the ACT tend to be spiradic and intermittently placed. Several major limited access roads like the Tuggeranong Parkway (between the City and the town centres of Woden, Weston Creek and Tuggeranong) are 100km/h, though others are 80-90km/h.

The ACT also has the highest amount of speed cameras per capita in Australia. Fixed speed cameras have plenty of warning signs in advance via overt signage. Red light/speed cameras have much smaller warning signs, usually not coupled with a sign reminding of the speed limit. Mobile speed camera vans operate on major roads in the ACT. These may be overtly or covertly parked, and may be identified by a large white sign on the roof.

Motorists should watch out for 40km/h school zones which in Canberra are active throughout the school day (8am-4pm) (unlike surrounding New South Wales where they only operate for an hour or two at the beginning and end of the school day). School zones are rigorously policed.

The main shopping and commercial area of Canberra is known as Civic, but you will never see a signpost to Civic. It is signposted as "City".

Take change for parking meters in Civic if you want to park on the streets or in the government parking lots. Parking in the CBD can be difficult on weekdays, due to development of carparks and encouragement to take public transport. There are several multi-level carparks near the Canberra Centre with ticket pay-stations and pay-booths. Note that all day parking in the Canberra Centre is cheaper on the rooftop level. You will need to collect a parking entry ticket from the first boom gate and then feed the ticket into the second boom gate as you enter the rooftop level.

Fixed speed traps in Canberra are highly visible with multiple signs informing motorists that they are approaching a speed trap. However, mobile police speed traps are set up in large, highly visible white vans with police signage informing motorists that their speed has been checked. Many red light cameras double as speed cameras regardless of whether a red light infringement has occurred. The signage for these speed cameras is substantially less visible than the signage for standard speed cameras.

There are remarkably few fuel stations on the main roads. Instead, they tend to be located near local shops, off the main roads. Look for the small blue fuel pump signs pointing off the main roads. Start looking well before you run too low. There are several petrol stations just east of Northbourne Avenue at Civic.

In the suburbs of Tuggeranong, the "Monaro Highway" is signposted as a destination on numerous signs for the three roads that head east-west. The Monaro Highway is actually a north-south road to east of Tuggeranong Town, and the intended meaning is that the road is an appropriate route to the Monaro Highway.

* The largest collection of dinosaur and prehistoric fossil material in Australia.
* One of Canberra's most well-known attractions, a minature display village featuring a traditional English village and international display. Train rides and tea room also available.
* 
* Embassies. As the national capital, Canberra hosts the embassies of most countries, listed below in . Most of the embassies are built in an architectural style typical of that particular country. In Yarralumla (the closest embassy district to the city), the Embassy of China, Embassy of Papua New Guinea and , The Royal Thai Embassy are particularly worth a look. The Embassy of the United States of America is also worth a drive past, being the oldest embassy in Canberra. It is best to have a car or bicycle for touring so you can stop and have a look around.
* The main official residence of the Governor-General of Australia, representative of Queen Elizabeth II in Australia. Closed to the public except for open days, which take place approximately twice a year. There is a viewing platform off the Lady Denman Drive, or glimpses can be seen from the main gate at Dunrossil Drive, Yarralumla, or Weston Park, Yarralumla. Often kangaroos are to be spotted munching grass on the lawns, so be careful driving along the ride that gets to the viewpoint, especially at dusk.
*. Take a tour of the mint and see how coins are made. You will even get the chance to mint your own souvenir coin. Look for the pudding coins as a souvenir (not always available). Allow 1-2 hours.
*The Prime Minister's official residence. Generally closed to the public and one can only see part of the garden from behind the wall. There are open days about once a year and if you are lucky to be in Canberra then, it shouldn't be missed.

City Scenery

* This functional communications tower rises 195 m above the summit of Black Mountain, providing 360 degree views of Canberra and the countryside around it from a viewing platform 60m up the tower. Well worth a visit, day or night, for the fantastic views - look for the cork tree plantation and Parliament House. It has a revolving restaurant and telecommunications history display. Above the restaurant there is a two level viewing platform: the bottom level is indoor and has a souvenir shop and refreshments; the upper level is an open air area. Its a nice view, but the mountain is already already 260m above the lake, and the viewing platform is only another 60m above the mountain. You can decide if that is worth the price of admission.
* Canberra's new arboretum, built for its centenary in 2013, contains trees and shrubs from all over the world. It's still growing and being added to but is well worth a visit, even if for the views from the lookouts (lookout carparks are free of charge).
* Australia's national botanic garden, containing a collection of living native plants from all around Australia. Contains gardens, lawns to picnic on and walks among the native plants and trees.
*Other Lookouts - Canberra is surrounded by hills and there are plenty of other great vantage points to view the city. Many of these you can also drive to the top. The best vantage points are:
**Mount Ainslie (off Fairbairn Avenue, Campbell/Forrest) - vehicular access available. This is the most classic Canberra view looking in a straight line over the War Memorial, the lake and Old and New Parliament House in the background.
**Red Hill (off Melbourne Avenue, Deakin/Forrest) - vehicular access available
**Mount Majura (access via Antill St in Watson, also service road off Majura Road) - no vehicular access, walking tracks only.
**Mount Taylor (access via Waldock St, Chifley) - partial vehicular access; to reach the top you will need to walk.
**Mount Pleasant (via General Bridges Drive, Duntroon) - vehicular access available between 7AM and 7PM.
* Kangaroos form family social groups come to the semi-irrigated grassland next to the Campbell Park Offices (reputedly the longest building in the Southern Hemisphere) from the adjacent nature park and graze the grass from evening until mid-morning. During the day they return to the nature park reserve and lie in the shade of the trees. Observe the kangaroos on the grass areas in the car park or near the building. During the day, you can park and walk along paths to the up-hill side of the building, even cross the fence, and look for kangaroos in the reserve. Security guards are not concerned by tour groups in coaches, or people in/from cars.

The Pinnacle Nature Reserve, Hawker. Approximately 10km west of the city centre, accessible from Springvale drive, The Pinnacle is a hilly, but easily walkable reserve, and relatively open consisting of mostly reclaimed grazing lands which is home to a very large population of Eastern Grey kangaroos. A short walk will generally be sufficient to sight several large mobs.

Historic buildings
*A historic cottage of some of the earliest settlers of the area. Guided tours and school tours available.
*Historic house picturing life in Canberra in the early days of the territory.

Events

* Floriade festival of flowers, a yearly event held in spring (September-October), not to be missed. Tulips are the main feature but many other colourful flowers and floral displays are featured. There are also sculptures, garden stalls, makeshift restaurants, activities, live music by local performers and sometimes there is even a gnome or scarecrow festival where children (and some adults) paint gnomes or make scarecrows and enter a competition to choose the best. Great for a photo opportunity!
* Summernats is a festival of modified cars, car cruising, burnouts, etc., which takes place first thing in the new year. If you are not into this culture, this is a good time not to be in Canberra, as even the most civilised hotels are overtaken by drunken 'nats'.
* Is a melting pot of Canberra's diverse international community. Each year sees events such as concerts, performances and an International Food Fare with over 200 stalls selling original food of different countries. Happens every year in February.
* Thai Food & Cultural Festival Annual festival held in September (Sun 22 September 2013) at The Royal Thai Embassy in Yarralumla. The Festival is a bonus for floriade visitors and Canberrans alike and it's the Embassy's biggest free event of the year. Exotic event hall and beautiful court yard with 2 outdoor stages for live performances plus Thai food & beer, "made-in-Thailand" products, and fun & games for children. Do not miss this! The Philippines, Sri Lanka and some other embassies do similar events sometimes.
* Diplomatic Charity Bazaar - held occasionally. Great place to buy original things specific to various countries, sold by staff of the embassies.
* The National Folk Festival - held every Easter over 5 days, featuring local, national and international folk musicians, dancers and craftspeople.
* The Canberra Show is held each year in February and features shows, amusement park rides and agricultural competitions. It has most of the features of the Sydney Royal Easter Show, but on a smaller scale with less crowds.
* Check out the Canberra Times newspaper on Saturday for upcoming events.

Country ACT

The majority of the Australian Capital Territory is actually not Canberra city and there is a large area of national park. While most people don't spend any time outside of the city there is plenty to do if you want to get away from the museums and attractions for a while.

See Canberra Off Road Cyclists (CORC for locations. Canberra is also home to the largest 24 hour Mountain Bike Race in the world (Scott 24hr held in early October each year.
*Explore Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve is about a 40 minute drive south of Canberra via Tuggeranong Parkway and Tharwa Drive.

*Go tobogganing in This alpine recreation facility features a bobsled ride in summer, and snowplay and tobogganing in winter. It is high enough to receive natural snowfalls. Check the website or call before heading up that the road is open, and that there is snow.
*See the stars and planets at Mount Stromlo Observatory Cotter road, Weston Creek. ph +61 2 6125-0230. Mount Stromlo is Australia's premier astronomical observatory.

The site's damaged buildings and equipment remain and may be fascinating for tourists.
*Go wine tasting in the Wineries around Canberra (most are outside of the ACT but all very close to Canberra). They are described as cool climate wines and some are very well known and regarded. Try Jeir Creek, Gallagher, Clonakilla and Lark Hill, just to name a few. There are '33 wineries within 35 minutes of Canberra'. Visit the Canberra Wineries website for more information 
*Take a scenic drive into the southern ACT - recommended by locals:
**Head south to Tharwa, and then take the road to Adaminaby. The road is very good for all of what I describe, any car can go on it, but further south than what I describe requires a 4WD. Take the road out of Tharwa, and remain on the road for about 10km. Take the signed road to Honey Suckle Creek. Very important historical site, this is where the signals from the Apollo 11 space landing were received, and then beamed around the world. Also a nice drive, and a very good camp ground.
**On the same road, not far off the Adaminaby Road is a walking (Fire ranger) trail to the top of Mount Tennant. About a 5 hour round hike, but worth every step. Go back onto the Adaminaby road, and head south. Another site of a space centre on the right down the road, worth a look, but not as interesting
**Remaining on the road for another ten kilometers, entering the Namadgi National park, and two hundred meters after a single lane bridge is a signed turn off to Yankee's Hat. This is a four km drive, any car can take it, and look for Kangaroos. Hundreds either side of the road. The walk to Yankee's hat will take you to see aboriginal art.
**Road to Adaminaby. If you have a robust vehicle, take the road south. The country is magnificent. It takes about an hour from Yankee's hat.

Stay safe
Canberra is a very safe city and enjoys one of the lowest crime rates in all of Australia. However, be cautious, especially around bus interchanges, where some youths may tend to be hostile.

Despite its apparent affluence, Canberra has people who live 'rough'. Particularly around Civic, it is not unusual to be asked for money. This is a well-organised activity targeting both visitors and locals: if you simply say that you don't have any money, the beggar (real or fake) will usually move on to the next available person (unless they will start stalking you, in which you'll need to look over your shoulder to be sure you're not followed).

There are no public lockers. If you want to store your luggage, book a room or keep it at a friend's place.

Contact
The National Library of Australia provides free WiFi and free internet access from its 40 computer terminals (webmail is blocked on some computers, so ask the staff to show you which ones you can access webmail from). The library is located adjacent to Commonwealth Avenue Bridge on the southern side of Lake Burley Griffin near the National Gallery of Australia and Questacon. It is open 9AM-9PM Monday-Thursday, 9AM-5PM Friday-Saturday and 1.30PM-5PM on Sundays.

There is also free internet available at all of the public libraries in Canberra, though the terminals at Tuggeranong may be occupied during school hours by students of the college next door since it is a dual-use library. Membership is not required, but you may have to book a few hours in advance due to high demand.

McDonald's restaurants in the ACT offer free WiFi, no purchase required. Full list of participating restaurants available at there is one in the Civic bus interchange in the city centre. Service is subject to content filtering and session download limits.

The Pancake Parlour at Civic (in the Sydney Building, near bus bay 4) also offers free Wi-Fi to customers, along with power points at several tables.

The Barracks LAN Games & Internet Cafe located in the Bus Interchange in Civic offers pay for use internet and gaming. It goes without saying that it smells like a 13 year old's room in there.
