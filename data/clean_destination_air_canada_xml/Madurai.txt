Understand

Madurai is one of the oldest cities of India and was ruled by Pandya kings over most of its history. The city is famous for is rich heritage and promoting Tamil language through "Sangams". The city has been in existence since about 4th century B.C and is mentioned in ancient texts of Greeks, Romans and Arabs. The Meenakshi Amman temple situated in the heart of the city is famous, and there are a number of temples in and around the city. The "Maha Kumbabhishekam" of the temple was performed in April 2009 after the renovation (re-painting) work on the gopurams(towers) of the temple. It is usually performed once every 14 years or more. There are numerous remarkable sculptures on the gopurams as well as inside the premises of the temple. Look out for the "yaali", a mythical creature similar to a dragon on the pillars in the 'pragaram' of the temple. Also, keep looking at the ceiling to catch a glimse of the beautiful ancient paintings that adorn them.
Madurai is also an important transit point for travelers bound south and also a local commercial hub.

Get in
Main modes of transport for travellers are by air and by train. 

By air
Madurai has an International / Domestic airport with fairly good facilities. It is served by several domestic airlines including:

* Indian Airlines
* SpiceJet 

Flights connect mainly from (Madras), but there are few direct flights from other major domestic cities. Direct International flights are available from Colombo in Sri Lanka,Singapore and Dubai.

The airport is about 15 km from the city center off National Highway 47. It is best to hire a taxi from the airport from the counter in the arrival lounge (If anyone is there...) or arrange for airport pick-up with your hotel. Taxis can be negotiated with outside the arrivals hall, most will start at a ridiculous 500-600rs but can be haggled down to 250-300rs.

For those who prefer to use public transport, you should take bus number 10A, which runs from the airport to the Periyar bus stand. To go to airport the bus number is 10J, which runs from the Complex bus stand.

By train
Trains are the major mode of entry into the city. The railway station is centrally located and many facilities are accessible from there. Madurai is well connected by trains to many parts of India like , , (Bombay), and . A train journey from Chennai takes 8 to 10 hours and is the preferred railhead. Train tickets can be booked from Indian Railways' reservation centers or online from IRCTC

If you book through a travel agent, please book through authorized agents only.

By road
Madurai is situated on National Highways NH-7, NH-45B, NH-49. Almost all of them are presently being upgraded to multi-lane ways as part of National highway development program. Travel from Chennai and Bangalore will take approximately 8-10 hours.

The city is well connected by buses to all major cities in Tamil Nadu via state government operated and private buses. Buses also ply from important cities in the neighboring states of Kerala (Ernakulam, Trivandram) and Karnataka(Bangalore, Mysore). There are lots of ordinary buses and many luxury ones too.

Madurai has several bus stands. Most inter-state and overnight buses terminate at Mattuthavani Bus stand. Private buses are found closer to the city center near Periyar bus stand. Ticketing and reservation facilities are available at the bus-stands.

By boat
Madurai is situated inland, and the Vaigai River which runs through the city is mostly dry. However, the nearest ports for entry are (450 km) and (160 km).

Get around

Local transport is by means of bus, taxi or auto-rickshaw. Being a small city there are no metro or local train facilities, though there are passenger trains connecting nearby places. Refer to the timetable available at the railway station for more information.

By bus
Local buses are run by the government and are safe to use. Travelling them is extremely cheap, and quite an experience in itself. However, they will be crowded during peak hours. There are also specific services available at night, though the charges are double. Please carry coins to buy tickets. Remember that in India everyone lives by asking each other for directions. The friendly people are often more than happy to help a foreigner find his/her way by giving directions. Just don’t get too friendly or pay money. Most people speak the working national Language "English" , at bus stops don’t form a queue, ask whether the bus you are boarding goes to where you need to and get on, the conductor will drop you off if you are not on the right bus, no worries! Now the buses are color coded. Orange buses with yellow seats are expensive (USD 0.20), so are not crowded. Choose to wait and travel comfortably. If you really want to rough it out try the cheaper version of the city buses and be ready to shower and use deodorant after! I would also keep a watch on my wallet. But Tamilnadu is better policed than most other states. Travel at night is also safe. So relax, forget your travel guide and discover a whole new culture of friendliness. 

The boards in buses are displayed only in Tamil, so please ask the conductor regarding the destination and route.

Madurai has 4 main bus-stands.
* Periyar Bus Stand - Exclusive local bus terminal, about 5 minutes walk from railway station. Commonly referred as "Periyar". Buses to Mattuthavani Bus Terminus leave from here.
* Complex Bus Stand - Right opposite to Periyar bus stand, where we can find buses to the Airport (all Airlines offices are situated there), and to Thirupparankundram (Rock Temple).

* Arappalayam Bus Stand - Some local buses and those bound west/northwest towards , , , , , , , Batlagundu or Vaththalakundu, Periyakulam, Thekkady & Munnar depart from here.
* Mattuthavani Integrated Bus Terminus - Simply called Mattuthavani is located in the outskirts about 10 km from Periyar bus stand. This is the location for long distance government buses and other places. Private buses also stop here.

All bus-stands are interconnected by buses or you can hire an auto.

By car
It is as difficult to drive in certain cities of India like any other big city in the world, as traffic can be high. Please see article for more. However, taxis are abundant and you can book one from your hotel.

Average car rental rate in Madurai to go to places like Alagar Temple, Thiruparakundram Hill, Naicker Mahal, Palamudurcholai is Rs.600-650. Be beware of cheats as tourists are easily duped into paying more again like it happens all over the world. Autorickshaws are readily available in the city, but be sure to bargain, as they are not equipped with meters. Currently, a 5 km trip should cost about Rs. 70 by auto. 

One can move around by car in Madurai. There are many car rental companies and private taxis available. Most hotels also offer cab services.

By Auto Rickshaws
The Auto Rickshaws are not metered, which means you need to negotiate your fare before commencing your travel. The rule of thumb rate is Rs10 per km of travel during day time and Rs 15 per km during night. They are usually safe to hire from central, well lit locations like the railway station. It is likely for auto rickshaw drivers to quote exorbitant rates to Foreigners.

By far, the most common reason for visiting the city is the Meenakshi Temple dedicated to the goddess Meenakshi (considered a form of Parvati) with a sanctum for her consort, Sundareshwarar (or Siva). Actually, historically, the Sundereshwar shrine is the larger and older of the two temple complexes. The complex itself is a splendid example of the south Indian Dravida architectural idiom. Four immense gopurams or temple towers crown the gateways at each cardinal direction, easily visible from a distance. Each tower is encrusted with more than a thousand brilliantly painted sculptures depicting an assortment of mythological and auspicious themes. It is traditional to enter through the south gopuram and, unusually, worship the Goddess before her consort. Inside the shelter for shoe-storage, offering baskets of coconuts, bananas and incense are available in addition to images of the Goddess for home altars. Many pilgrims -- particularly the men in black or orange sarongs who are devotees of the god Ayyappan -- circumambulate the main temple itself in the prakara or space between the outer wall and main temple. In addition, snake shrines and an assortment of offices and classrooms of religious foundations are found here.

Within the temple, devotees line up for darshan or viewing of the deities. Please note, however, that non-Hindus are not permitted into the inner sancta of Meenakshi or Sundareshwarar; anyone who looks suspicious can and will be pulled out of line by attendants. However, there is an abundance of sculpture and painting accessible to all. In addition, the steps of the Pottramaraikulam or Golden Lotus Pond is open to all and is a common meeting place for inhabitants of the city, in addition to pilgrims and tourists. In ancient times, the sangam or assembly of poets was said to gather at this pool to judge the merits of new compositions, often by throwing the manuscripts into the pool itself. Those that sank were inferior while those that floated were worthy of praise and propagation.

There are many shops within the east gate, selling everything from plastic toys to bronze images of the Goddess. Be sure to bargain hard.

NOTE: One can buy the special tickets at the counter Rs.20 per person to get a special darshan in one sanctum, need to buy another 20 Rs. ticket for the second sanctum. There is one more special Ticket, is Rs.100/- per person, which is nothing but cutting short the line by at least a half. Do buy these tickets if you can see the queue after getting inside. After the first entrance there is another entrance and after that the entrance to the inner sanctum and after that the inner sanctum itself. You will not be able to see it but the line would be 2 hours long if you are in the general queue.

Timings : The temple is usually open between 0500hrs and 12.30hrs and again between 1600 hrs and 21.30 hrs.

WARNING: Beware of guides, many of whom are or claim to be tailors, who offer to take you to vantage points outside the temple to get a better view. You will be lured into shops that have a very hard sell..

* 
Open on All Days (no holiday throughout the year) from 9am-1pm & 1.30pm-5pm. The remains of the palace of the 17th century ruler Thirumalai Nayak who contributed extensively to the Meenakshi Temple. Only a small portion of the original structure which was four times as larger remains. There were originally two parts-Swargavilasa heavenly pavilion, meant for the King's harem and housing the darbar court, and the ranka vilasa, which was for his brother. Entry to the roof is prohibited permanently. There is a sound and light show in the evening (Both English & Tamil Version of the show). There is also a museum, which houses not only the original portraits of Thirumalai naicker, but also unearthed stone carvings of the 17th century, along with many sculptures of Hindu Gods like Brahma, Nataraja, Saraswati. There is one rare painting on one of the pillars, which the Archaeological Department claim to have unearthed from one of the pillars. There is a painting hidden in every pillar, apparently. The other portion of the palace, Rankavilasam was demolished by Thirumalai Nayak's Grandson. However, a small structure still remains known as "Ten pillars" or "Pathu Thoon" in Tamil. Sadly, these ten pillars of timeless beauty in Thirumalai Nayak are now surrounded by shops and residential houses.

* Thirupparankundram. An Islamic Durgah (shrine) is located at the top of the hill, where the grave of an Islamic saint Hazrat Sultan Sikandhar Badushah shaheed Radiyallah Ta'al anhu, who came from Jeddah along with Hazrat Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed Badushah of Madinah (now in Erwadi, Ramanathapuram district) during the early 13th century, is found. Irrespective of religion, people from all parts of and from visit this durgah. People who visit the Ervadi Durgah in Ramanathapuram district are supposed to visit this durgah. Many poems were written in praise of Hazrat Sultan Sikandhar Badhusha, by Syed Abdussalam Ibrahim Saalim Hazrat,the third in the list of Madurai Hazrats and his Maternal grandson Syed Abdus Salaam Ibrahim Saahib Hazrat. It is seen that people who come here with a wish see it answered in a very short time, and so He is also called Mustajab ad Du'aa Sikandhar Badhushah. Mustajab Ad Du'aa in Arabic means A saint whose Supplications are immediately answered by Allah. The Anniversary urus festival of Hazrat Sulthan Sikandar badusha Shaheed is commomerated on 17th Night of the islamic Month of Rajab every Hijri year

*This museum houses Gandhi's bloodstained dhoti and little else by way of artifacts. Those interested in the freedom struggle, though, will be interested in the extensive text housed here. Tamil speakers and long-term visitors may be interested in the classes and workshops offered in subjects as diverse as t'ai chi and local herbs. There is also a khadi bhavan (store selling village and handloom products) and bookstore, with (mostly Tamil) books on spiritual and natural health topics. Also located on the campus of the museum is a government museum (across from the library).

* Kazimar Big Mosque and Maqbara. This traditional mosque (masjid) is located at the heart of Madurai city, within 500 metres of the (Central) bus stand and within 1 kilometre South East of the Madurai Railway Junction. Hazrat Kazi Syed Tajuddin, who came from during 13th century, received this land from the then Panidiya king, Koo(n) Pandiyan, and constructed the mosque which is the first Muslims' place of worship in Madurai.

All of Kazi Syed Thajuddheen's descendants (Huqdars - shareholders of this mosque called as Syeds) have lived in the same locality (Kazimar street) for more than 700 years, and have managed the mosque since then. Syed Tajuddin was appointed as Kazi of the sultans, and still his descendants who live at Kazimar street, Madurai, are appointed as Kazis to the Government of Tamil Nadu. All Syeds belong to the Sunni sect of Islam and belong to Hanafi school of Islam. Most of the descendants of Kazi Syed Tajuddin are Khadiris and shadhilis and follow the Sufi order At-Thariqathu Khadiriya Fassiyatush Shadhiliya.

* Vandiyur Mariamman Teppakulam. A Mandapa built in the middle of a man-made pond. Mariamman Teppakulam Famous for its float festival (teppa tiruvila) conducted during the Thai Poosam (falls in the second half of January or first half of February). Popular story is that the spot was excavated for its soil to be used for building 17th Century king Tirumala Nayakkar's palace. The king had ordered excavated spot to be converted into a 16 acre lake fed from Vaigai river through under ground channels. The river itself boasts of water only during North-East Monsoon season (Oct-Nov) and hence the lake has water from Nov to Feb.

* Gorippalayam Dargah. The name Gorippalayam comes from the Persian word Gor which means Grave. This area is called as Goripalayam because the Graves of the two famous saints of Islam and rulers of Madurai Hazrat Sulthan Alauddin Badusha (Radiyallah) and Hazrat Sulthan Shamsuddin Badhusha (Radiyallah) are located here. A beautiful green coloured tomb can be seen from the A.V.Bridge madurai, which is the Gorippalayam Dargah located in the northern banks of vaigai River. It is amazing to see that, the domb which is 70 feet in diameter and 20 feet in height is made of a single block of stone which was brought from the Azhaga Hills. People from all over come here to seek blessings and go back fruitfully. The two rulers were brothers who ruled the northern part of madurai after coming from during 13th century to spread Islam. Hazrat Kazi Syed Tajuddin Radiyallah of Kazimar street was Govt. Kazi (Islamic Legal advisor and jury) to them. An ancient Tamil inscription, can be found planted on the outer campus of the Maqbara of the dargah campus. The information found in that inscription is,

"The descendants of Sulthan Alauddin Badusha, and Sulthan Shamsuddin Badusha (called as Sultans of ) purchased from the then King Koo(n) Pandiyan the land of Gorippalayam Dargah for a Feet of Gold piece and other six villages (namely Bibi Kulam, Chokkikulam, Cholikudi, Chirudoor, Kannanendal, Thiruppalai) at the rate of 14,000 Gold pieces for the maintenance of Gorippalayam Dargah. During the reign of King Veerappa nayakkar a dispute arose between the Huqdars of the Durgah and the employees of the Nayakkar Government regarding the six villages. The case was taken to King Veerappa Nayakkar, who inquired and verified the documents written by King Koo(n) Pandiyan and gave his verdict in the year 1573 A.D. as the Six villages and the Dargah land belongs to the Descendants of Sultans and it should be in their enjoyment till the existence of Sun and Moon and who violates this will be liable for the sin of slaughtering a cow in the bank of river Ganga."

This inscription is considered as one of the evidences to prove the existence of the Dargah since 13th century. The anniversary urus festival of this dargah is held on 15th night of the Islamic month of Rabi al-awwal on every hijri year.

*Hotel Germanus is one of the old 5 star hotels. It used to be one of the best hotel in Madurai until some time ago. The rooms are functional, comfortable, not spacious though, but acceptable. But for Rs.3000+ standard single per night in Madurai one expects more. It’s now comparable only to a Mid- Budget hotel. The complimentary buffet breakfast included idlis, vadas, parathas and eggs to order, is quite ample but not tasty. The view from the rooftop is simply amazing. You can catch the glimpse of the Meenakshi Amman Temple from here.

* The major part of this property is the result of the conversion of what was originally company accommodation, then a British club, into a hotel complex. Some newer rooms and facilities have been added. The basic rooms are in 2-storey blocks of around 6 units. Each room is very spacious; they have business class rooms and the luxury villas with plunge pool and a huge bathroom is really unique. The food, which is good in choice, presentation and quality, however, the bar is surprisingly average. Very good service and all the amenities of a modern hotel. reservation: reservations@grandluxehotelsindia.com
