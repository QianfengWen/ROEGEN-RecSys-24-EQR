History
Being the capital of Texas has resulted in a rich history for Austin. Established in 1839 by the then recently-formed Republic of Texas, Austin is located on the Colorado River and the edge of the Texas Hill Country. The city was named for Texas founder Stephen F. Austin after Texas President Mirabeau B. Lamar selected the site due to the area's abundant natural resources, beauty and central location in the state. Because of its unprotected geographical location, Austin's early years consisted of many raids from Mexican troops and Native Americans unhappy with Texas.

The town was laid out and constructed using temporary buildings in less than one year, as planner Edwin Waller was committed to having the town ready by November 1839 when the Texas Congress convened. Congress and the 856 people who inhabited Austin were certainly impressed, as they elected Waller the first mayor of Austin January 1840.

Darker days arrived for Austin in 1842, as newly elected Texas President Sam Houston, fearing attacks on the Capital, moved the government to Houston, and later Washington-on-the-Brazos, where it remained until 1845. But all was not lost for Austin, as the 1845 constitutional convention approved the annexing of Texas to the United States, and established Austin as the state capital, which it has remained to this day.

The Civil War dominated Austin from 1861 to 1865, with almost 20 percent of the population joining the Confederacy. While Austin, like much of the Confederacy, faced shortages of goods and workers, Union forces did not directly threaten the city.

After the Civil War, Austin's population grew steadily, including a boom to almost 35,000 people by 1920. However, Austin had previously been the fourth largest city in Texas, and saw itself slip to 10th because of the oil boom and surging industrial development. The 1930s brought the Great Depression, but Austin was hit less than many cities thanks to its base in government and education - the University of Texas at Austin doubled its enrollment during this time. Later, in 1956, UT would become the first major southern University to admit black students as undergraduates. 

Austin's population continued to grow almost 40 percent per decade, with 472,000 residents in 1990 and 656,000 residents in 2000. Austin's growth came in many forms - government, education, and high technology. In the 1990s, more than 400 high technology companies, including IBM, Texas Instruments, Dell and Motorola, all called Austin home.

Austin has continued to grow, and in the 2000s found itself as the live music capital of Texas. The young demographic of college students and recent graduates helped fuel this growth and Austin now hosts a variety of large music festivals, most notably South by Southwest.

Climate

}}

Austin weather is generally nice most of the year; activities are generally not limited by season. However, as Austin lies within Central Texas, be prepared to deal with the long, hot summers if you are visiting between May and September. It is not uncommon for daily high temperatures to be between 90 and 100 degrees during this time — in fact, a day in the 80s is rare, and several days may even reach triple digits (90 days in 2011). If you are here when the weather is like this, dress accordingly, drink plenty of water, and do not plan on staying outside for long (nearly all indoor places are air-conditioned) — unless you're taking the opportunity to take a dip in Barton Springs Pool or any of the other swimming holes in the area. This is especially true if the heat index is around 105 or higher, which is considered to be dangerous. Also keep in mind that the interior of cars will get dangerously hot, especially if the windows are up and it's parked in the sun — don't leave pets or children in there, no matter how brief. How hot the summer gets usually depends on the amount of precipitation the area has been getting. If there is no drought and the spring has been particularly wet, temperatures will remain relatively tolerable and rarely break triple digits. If it has been dry, as it was from 2007-2009, summers can be very uncomfortable and triple-digit temps will be very common.

Central Texas winters are short to non-existent. There are many pleasant or even warm days during the winter months (the first 90 degree day of 2012 was in February), and snowfall is rare. However, hard freezes happen occasionally, and light freezes may occur frequently (especially in the more rural areas), and when this mixes with precipitation, ice storms and other wintry weather happen. If the storm is severe enough, the city may shut down for a day or so, traffic may be snarled, and the local auto body shops may receive a spike in business. The Austin area usually experiences such events once or twice each year or so, from late December to mid-February. Generally, though, winter weather just varies a lot, with alternating cold and warm fronts that can make for large temperature swings within just a week's time.

Spring and fall are the best times to visit. Springs tend to be stormy (see "Stay safe" for related warning), and falls may bring light freezes during the night. For the most part, though, springs and falls are very pleasant times to experience Austin.

People
Austin is an interesting city with a diverse population when it comes to age, race, industry and more. Austin has historically seen double-digit population increases each decade, as people flock to the city hailed for having the best quality of life in Texas. 

Austin's main industries - government, education and technology, are likely why the median age in Austin is 31.1 years, more than 6 years younger than the national median age of 37.2. Austin's growing population has also resulted in increased ethnic diversity in the city, with the most recent census (2010) showing the racial breakdown of 48.7 percent Caucasian/white, 35 percent Hispanic/Latino, eight percent African-American/Black, six percent Asian, and three percent other. 

People in Austin value their quality of life, access to outdoor activities, access to live music and entertainment, education and government access. With the University of Texas at Austin being the largest University in the state of Texas as well as one of the largest universities in the country, many students choose to stay in Austin after graduation, thanks to the quality of life they grow accustomed to during their collegiate years. Technology-related majors and degrees have increased in number as students plan to stay in Austin after obtaining their degree.

People in Austin tend to be more politically liberal, and Travis County (home to Austin) has consistently gone Democratic in the last several political elections.

Literature
Austin's independent vibe and personality have inspired authors in all genres to take pen to paper. The city is home to many small independent bookstores where visitors can find works by these notable authors with Austin roots and connections:

*O. Henry
The pen name for William Sydney Porter. O. Henry was best known for his short stories that featured witty tales filled with wordplay and surprising endings. His wide-ranging work produced many compilations of short stories, but his most famous stories include Ransom of Red Chief, Gift of the Magi, and The Caballero's Way, which introduced the famous Cisco Kid character.

*Molly Ivins
Author, newspaper columnist, humorist and political commentator who expressed the views of many Austinites and Texans alike. Her witty writings were often directed at political figures - both liberal and conservative. 

*James Michener
A prolific author, writing more than 40 books throughout his career. While the majority of his books were fiction, they featured intense multi-generational familial sagas that weaved in detailed geographic information and historical facts. Many people are familiar with the story from his first book, South Pacific, which was later adapted into the Rogers & Hammerstein musical and film by the same name. 

*Walter Prescott Webb 
Served as President of the Texas State Historical Society and launched the project that would later become the Handbook of Texas. He was on the faculty of the University of Texas and is known for his historical research and writings.

*J. Frank Dobie
Best known for his books that shared the traditions and life on the open ranges of rural Texas. He was outspoken against the business as usual state politics of Texas, as well as religious prejudices, assaults on personal liberties and the negative affect the mechanical age had on the vibrant Texan spirit. Aside from his writing, he also played a key role in preventing the extinction of the Texas Longhorn cattle breed.

*Tucker Max
An irreverent humor writer who has written newspaper columns and several books. His writing often tells tales of his time as an undergraduate student and law student. He is considered one of the founders of the "fratire" literary genre - humorous writing often written by and for young fraternity-type men. 

*Aaron Franklin
While many may hear Franklin's name mentioned when deciding where to eat while in Austin, visitors can also pick up his cookbook. Franklin Barbecue: A Meat-Smoking Manifesto shares the secrets to making barbecue that is regularly considered to be among the best in the world. While the book may not make readers a bonafide pitmaster, it can certainly help recreate a tasty reminder of an Austin visit.

Politics
In a land considered a conservative stronghold, Austin often finds itself at odds with the rest of the state. Recent times have found most major cities in Texas leaning liberal, but the suburbs and rural areas have still seen significant enough voter turnout to keep the state a conservative territory.

This situation is particularly interesting in Austin since the traditionally conservative state government is located in Austin. Liberal downtown Austinites and more conservative suburbanites combine to create a political climate that allows 3rd party and other independent candidates to garner support.

The last time Austin went Republican in a major election was in 2000 with the election of former Texas Governor George W. Bush. By 2004, a major political shift in Austin gave Democratic Presidential candidate John Kerry a 14 percent margin of victory over Bush, who nevertheless won Texas again.

One of the strongest political movements in Austin has been the emphasis on environmental movements. Given Austin's plethora of outdoor activities, it's no surprise that residents want to protect their environment. In 2012, Austin distinguished itself by banning the sale and use of plastic bags, a measure that several other Texas cities were not able to pass or enforce. In addition to the ambient environmental concerns, Austin's increasing population has created neighborhood environmental and conservationist movements that revolve around creating Austin's "sense of place", preserving Austin's quality of life, and preventing redevelopment of residential neighborhoods. 

Austin is divided into six state legislative districts. Three of these districts are consistently Democratic, and the other three are swing districts that are currently held by two Democrats and one Republican. Redistricting in 2003 resulted in downtown Austin not having an exclusive congressional seat of its own. However, the City maintained six seats.

Get around

On foot

Most of the areas of Austin of interest to a visitor are pedestrian friendly. The downtown area is especially compact and walkable, with many attractions within a 1-2 mile walk from downtown hotels. In the summer, temperatures that stay in the 90s during the day may make a long walk less appealing. Just break up your wanderings with stops for a cool drink!

The University of Texas area, just north of downtown, is also very pedestrian friendly, and in fact can be a difficult place to get around by car (very hard to find a parking spot).

By bike
Austin is hilly to the west but generally mildly sloping toward the river in the center of town. There are bike lanes on some major streets in addition to some trails. Biking is a great way to get around year round and the weather is usually agreeable from mid-October to mid-April. May to mid-October temperatures may reach the high 90's and humidity may be a problem.
 
* Operates two community bike shops where individuals can go and repair their own bikes free of charge. Coordinators are present to answer any questions and guide you, but not to fix your bike for you. At the Main Shop on 51st street there are 10+ work stands and tools sets available for use. The Satellite Shop is better for minor repairs and only has as a few work stands. If you are looking for a cheap bike while in town and are willing to do a little maintenance work, visit The Yellow Bike Project and pick out a bike that needs a little love in exchange for a small donation. If you are interested getting away from touristy attractions on your visit, the Yellow Bike shop is a great place to drop in and volunteer a few hours. Their hours change monthly but are up-to-date on their website. If you are lucky you might see one of the name-sake Yellow Bikes around town. If you see a Yellow Bike, feel free to ride it to your destination and leave it for the next person. Yellow Bikes are not to be locked up and you ride at your own risk. The Austin Yellow Bike Project has been operating for ten years and has released over 600 yellow bikes.
* Low cost bike sharing with 42 stations located Downtown and on West Campus, South Congress, and East Austin. Includes options for 24-hour pass, weekend pass, and others. Currently, 24-hour passes cost $12 (July 2017).
* The Bicycle Sports Shop is located Downtown and offers a large selection of bike rentals in the city.

By Bus
 Capital Metro is Austin's public bus network with a system of inexpensive neighborhood, express and downtown routes. As of 2017, all local routes (including the airport) are $1.25 per trip or $2.50 for a 24-hr pass. MetroRail and MetroExpress, which serve the surburbs, are $3.50 per ride or $7.00 for 24 hours. You can also download the Cap Metro app for your phone to pull up route info, buy tickets by credit card, and see real-time bus arrival info. If you're not using the app, plan to have exact change to buy your ticket when you board the bus. 

Some routes run every 15 minutes on weekdays while others are much more infrequent, so check Google Maps or the Cap Metro app to see what your options are beforehand in case you need to work around the bus schedule. If you want to get around primarily by bus, plan to stay pretty central to have the best options. In general the bus routes going north and south are better than east and west, not sure why.

By Rail
 Metrorail is a commuter rail service that goes from Downtown Austin to the Northwestern suburbs of Leander and Cedar Park. Since the service is geared towards commuters, service tends to be spotty at best outside of peak hours and really isn't useful for for most visitors.

By car
Driving is not too difficult if you're used to living in a large city. Traffic is bad from 7-9AM and 3:30-7PM weekdays, though IH-35 through town can be jammed at other times as well.

There are two major north-south Expressways: I-35 (nonstandarly called "IH-35") and Loop 1 (also called the MoPac Expressway for former owner of the railroad which runs along it, Missouri-Pacific - or "Slo-Pac" for anyone who has experienced it at rush hour). There is only one true major east-west freeway in Austin located south of the city center, known as Ben White or US 290 West/Texas highway 71. The freeway section of 290 West/Ben White currently runs from Austin-Bergstrom International Airport to just east of Oak Hill. Freeway extensions are currently being constructed east on 71 past the airport, and the beginning stages of construction are taking place west towards and past Oak Hill. Hwy 183 runs from the southeast corner of the city near the airport to the northwest suburbs, bridging Mopac and I-35 in North Austin.

 is the point at which TX 71 and US 290 split apart and go in separate directions, and in case this isn't confusing enough, some people make the distinction between 290 West and 290 East because at I-35, 290 East actually heads up the interstate, and then continues on to the east in North Austin. There is a second freeway that runs from the Northwest side of the city down to the Southeast side of the city past the airport. This freeway is called US 183, and in North Austin it may also be referred to as Research Boulevard. Most of it is freeway now, however there are still several major intersections which are currently being constructed and turned into freeway. 

I-35 has no loop that circumnavigates the city, so watch out for aggressive, confused drivers. Also, keep your eyes open for the upper deck/lower deck split between Airport Boulevard and Martin Luther King Jr Boulevard; it's confusing, and accidents occur there frequently. Drivers going through Austin without stopping, or those who wish to avoid the chaos of the lower deck, should use the right two lanes as the deck split approaches, in contrast to other cities where through traffic uses the left lane. On the northbound side, traffic entering I-35 at Martin Luther King Jr Boulevard goes directly to the upper deck.

Out-of-towners be warned: on-ramps on I-35, especially the lower deck, are very short.

Austin has a mostly completed network of toll roads, see Central Texas Turnpike System and Central Texas Regional Mobile Authority. These include SH 130, an Austin bypass east of town; SH 45, an east-west artery in North Austin; the North MoPac extension; the US 183A bypass of Cedar Park and Leander; and SH 45SE in far south Austin. TxTag accounts are available for commuters. There has been significant opposition and accommodations have been made in some areas. Both US 183A and MoPac are rather deceptive — if you keep going north on either 183 or MoPac, the freeway seamlessly transitions into a toll road and the signing is rather poor. To avoid the toll, you must keep a sharp eye out and get off the main lanes. Even worse, all tolls on 183A are "TxTag Only" meaning that you cannot pay cash. This trend will likely extend to all Austin tollways in the near future.

Rental car offices may try to add on a "toll road package". Be sure you understand exactly which roads require tolls before signing on for this. The fee is exorbitant, a pure cash cow for the agency.

 car2go & ZipCar are car shares active in Austin and are both great for quick trips around town. Become a member then go online or use their mobile app to find an available car parked nearby. Just hop in the car and drive to your destination and then leave it there for the next user. An hourly rate covers all gas and insurance.

Parts of the city are subject to flooding at times during the year; however, it is not too common as Austin does not usually get an excessive amount of rain. The year 2007 saw several flood episodes with the worst effects in Marble Falls, northwest of the city. See City of Austin Flood History for historic flooding.

For those of you unfamiliar with proper treatment of flooded areas, NEVER drive through flooded low water crossings. You will lose your car and possibly your life. As little as a few inches of running water can and does wash a car away and each year there are some deaths due to this. "Turn Around, Don't Drown."

Parking
While driving is not too bad, parking in the city center can be difficult; look for municipal parking garages as officers will ticket you in the blink of an eye (check meters, though, because many are free in the evenings, on weekends, and on major holidays). Worse yet, vehicles illegally parked in private parking areas are very quickly towed, so make sure that you don't park in spots marked no parking. 

Parking is free in the Texas State History Museum garage near UT after hours and on weekends. As of 2005 under SB 1533, state employees may park in state garages during non-business hours for free.

Visitors can see great historic Texas landmarks, wander neighborhoods committed to the city slogan of ‘’Keep Austin Weird’’, visit great museums filled with art and history and picnic in lush parks. 

Landmarks

Many of the landmarks and historic places in Austin aren’t statues or cross streets. The city's history takes place in bars, diners and dance halls. The State Capitol building in is a traditional landmark and noteworthy part of the city's skyline. The current pink granite building is a source of pride for residents who won’t hesitate to inform visitors that it’s taller than the United States Capitol building. 

*A must see in the 2nd Street District are the bats that fly out from the ‘’’Congress Street Bridge’’’. March through November the ‘’Mexican free-tailed bats’’ are the most active around dusk, leaving in a great swarm from beneath the bridge. Visitors can catch them either from the banks of the Colorado River or on a boat tour. 

Neighborhoods

South Congress Avenue was in decline during the second half of the 20th century, but local independent businesses revitalized the area. The avenue is now packed with restaurants and cafes, great retailers and boutique hotels. 

West Austin is the historic area of the city. The ‘’’Balcones Uplift’’’ creates gorgeous panoramic views of the city. It is the go-to district for fine dining. 

 is quickly filling with recent Austin transplants. Great tex-mex, hip new restaurants, casual bars and upscale mixology joints mix in with artists’ studios, galleries and reclaimed warehouses and strip malls.

Museums

Many of the city’s museums are on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin, between and Central Austin. The beautiful campus is great for strolling between art and science museums and taking in the many outdoor public art pieces. The music and theater departments are also well-regarded and have performances going on throughout the year. Congress Avenue cuts through the center of the city and is also the go-to spot for eclectic art galleries, museums and Texas pride.

* Mexic-Arte Museum' Mexic-Arte Museum moved into its current home at 419 Congress Avenue in 1988. This ideal location placed the museum in the heart of Austin’s vibrant downtown – Central Texas’ epicenter of commerce, culture, arts and tourism. As one of the precious few Mexican art museums in the United States, Mexic-Arte Museum strives to improve the quality of life in Texas through innovative exhibitions and educational programming. A total of 75,000 visitors, ranging from enthusiastic children to art connoisseurs, tour the museum each year.

Parks

*Barton Creek Greenbelt is home to the best hiking and nature just minutes from downtown. You have to know how to find the trailheads, though, so do some research before heading out: Austin Greenbelt Guide.

*Roy G. Guerrero Colorado River Metropolitan Park is over 360 acres, with a disc golf course, baseball and softball fields and a trail leading to the Colorado river.

* Zilker Park is on the south bank of the Colorado River and west side of the city and contains endless trails, picnic spots, botanical gardens and Barton Springs. Home of ACL.

Other

*The University of Texas at Austin, is a beautiful stroll. While there you might want to visit the Blanton Museum of Art the Harry Ransom Center Texas Memorial Museum of Science and History or view the public art around campus The famous UT tower has reopened and is worth a look for the breathtaking views and history lesson. It is a tour though so you need to make reservations The theater and music departments are both well regarded and have performances throughout the school year. If you visit during football season, you can see the 2005 National Champion Texas Longhorn football team play at Darrell K. Royal - Texas Memorial Stadium. 

*LBJ Presidential Library, always seems to have something interesting on display. They change their exhibits fairly frequently. 

*The Texas State Capitol, is a must-see for new visitors to Austin. A large source of pride for the city and the state, the State Capitol is a beautiful building wrapped in Texas pink granite. Independent-minded Texans take pride in the fact that the State Capitol is actually 14 feet taller than the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. Unlike many other state capitols in America, Texas' is as welcoming as the state's people, and is completely open to the public seven days a week. It's interesting to stroll through the halls, look at the paintings and sculptures, and peek into the legislative chambers. And it's free!

*Austin Bats. Yes, that's right, bats. Austin's Congress Avenue bridge is home to about 1.5 million Mexican free-tailed bats. This is the largest urban bat colony in the world and one of the largest Mexican free-tailed bat colonies in North America. The bats are generally active at dusk every evening between March and November. In years when there has been a drought, the bats leave early (when there is still light), and can be a quite impressive sight. In years when there has been plenty of rain, they leave so late it is difficult to see much. Best place to see them is near the Austin American Statesman's parking lot, or you can pay for boat tours to see them from underneath the bridge.

Do

Austin is a city of doers. Residents get out to enjoy every single one of the 300 days of sunshine each year. From running and cycling on the miles of gorgeous city trails, to yoga in the parks, a weekend game of disc golf or a leisurely afternoon of tubing, Austin gets outside. Festivals, walking tours and outdoor equipment rental all welcome visitors to an authentic Austin experience alongside locals. 

*There's nothing like a dip in a spring fed pool to refresh and invigorate, the most famous of which is Barton Springs pool in South Austin. Other spring fed options are Big Stacy Pool also located south or Deep Eddy downtown. Just west of Austin, popular swimming spots include Hamilton Pool, Emma Long Park and the clothing optional Hippie Hollow.

*Downtown and South Austin offer multiple shops that rent stand-up paddle boards, kayaks and canoes. Head west for jet ski rentals on Lake Austin and Lake Travis. A more passive float may be enjoyed on summer inner tube rentals in nearby San Marcos or New Braunfels.

*The cliffs overlooking Barton Creek in South Austin are a popular rock climbing spot. There are several businesses that will provide the needed equipment and training.

*Mountain biking is popular in Austin and every district has its trails. Downtown is home to the busy 9th street BMX track, while South Austin is home to the 3.1 mile veloway used exclusively by bikes and rollerbladers (motorized and foot traffic is banned).
Festivals

Austin is famous for its monster festivals that get the whole city out partying in the streets.

Stay safe
Austin is a generally safe city. As with most American cities, credit cards are accepted nearly universally, especially for nightlife, and 6th Street and Congress usually have ATM's in multiple areas - as do most bars and clubs - if you must have cash. Therefore, for convenience and safety, do not carry large amounts of cash. Remember to lock your car when parking and do not leave valuables visible from outside the car. The number for police, fire, and medical services is 911.

There is generally a large, visible police presence (mounted, foot, and cruiser) at night in the 6th Street area. They are quite willing to let belligerent drunks dry out overnight in the city jail. They, however, provide a safe and secure area to enjoy yourself and Austin's famous live music.

There is an area near 7th Street and the Red River district that houses a large homeless shelter known as the Arch. This area is generally safe during the day but often filled with panhandlers and homeless citizens at night. Most of them are docile and will often ask for a donation, but some can be fairly aggressive and have been known to follow people travelling alone. In addition, groups of muggers sometimes target drunks leaving the bar scene alone in that area.

Because surrounding hills concentrate the water, some streets in Austin and the surrounding area are prone to flooding during periods of heavy rain. These areas are typically marked as low water crossings but in any event, do not drive or walk across moving water. Each year several people are killed as they are swept away by flooding. You will also see many flood control structures built into the landscape. Small, dry low places with bounding berms during the dry season, these are dangerous places to be in, but keep Austin safer when the rains come. As the locals say, "Turn Around, Don't Drown".

Coyote sightings near greenbelts in Austin are increasing as the adaptable animals discover that the developed urban landscape provides many sources of food. The most serious problem with the urbanization of coyotes is that they adapt to being around people. As they lose their fear, coyotes become bolder and attacks on pets and children are known to occur in the city. Coyotes are active mainly during the nighttime, but they can be moving at any time during the day. Most sightings of coyotes occur during the hours close to sunrise and sunset. Should you encounter a coyote, animate your behavior, raise your arms, yell, hoop and holler throw rocks and sticks to let them know you are bigger than they are and would make for a bad choice for a target. To report aggressive behavior toward people or pets, call 3-1-1. Call 9-1-1 to report a coyote attack on a human.
