Hanoi (Vietnamese: Hà Nội), the capital of , and also its second largest city, is a fascinating blend of East and West, combining traditional Sino-Vietnamese motifs with French flair. It is largely unscathed from the decades of war, and is now going through a building boom, making it a rapidly developing city in .

Consistently ranked among the world's top 10 destinations by TripAdvisor, the city and its surrounding region get more tourists every day.

Districts

Urban districts
The old Hanoi is contained within four districts: Hoàn Kiếm, Ba Đình, Hai Bà Trưng and Đống Đa. These districts are vastly contrasted by the skyscrapers and shopping malls in the newer Western districts Cau Giay, Thanh Xuan, Ha Dong and Nam Tu Liem.
* Hoàn Kiếm District - center of the city, with its core in the Hoan Kiem Lake (Sword Lake). You most likely will stay and visit this district first. The fascinating Old Quarter covers its northern half while its southern half has mostly French architecture with shady streets and villas. A large number of foreign embassies are located in the southern half of Hoan Kiem. The district also houses a majority of Hanoi's tourist attractions, including Hoan Kiem lake, Ngoc Son temple, The Huc Bridge, the neo-Gothic Hanoi Grand Cathedral (St. Joseph's Cathedral), Hoa Lo prison, Eiffel-designed Long Bien Bridge, Hanoi Opera House and several museums.
* Ba Đình District: political center of Vietnam, housing the national assembly building, president's palace, Ho Chi Minh mausoleum and most embassies. It also contains the One-Pillar Pagoda and the recently discovered Thang Long Citadel. The French Quarter with large shady boulevards is in its eastern part. Its northeastern part surrounds the Truc Bach lake where John McCain's plane was shot down. Its western part is mostly residential with a large number of new skyscrapers around the Japanese Embassy on Lieu Giai street.
* Hai Bà Trưng District: located south of Hoan Kiem with the largest population of all districts. Its northern part also has French-style streets with big trees. A large number of universities, including the Hanoi University of Technology are located here. Times City, in the southeast of the district, is a huge shopping mall with an aquarium located within the complex.
* Đống Đa District: one of the original four central districts, is mostly residential. The Temple of Literature - Imperial Academy (Văn Miếu - Quốc Tử Giám), Vietnam's first university, is located in the north end of the district, bordering Ba Dinh.
* Tây Hồ District: named after West Lake (Hồ Tây), one of the largest natural lakes of Vietnam. Thanks to its serenity and close proximity to downtown, it is a high-end residential area housing a large population of expatriates. 
* Cầu Giấy District: houses a large number of universities, including the National University's main campus and Hanoi University of Education. The Museum of Ethnology, one of foreign travelers' favorite, is located in this district. Its southwestern part bordering Nam Tu Liem district has numerous high-rises, including Keangnam Hanoi Landmark Tower, Vietnam's tallest building. This is where you see a completely different side of a modern Hanoi, in contrast to the old inner districts.
* Long Biên District: the only urban district located east of the Red River, it is named after the iconic Long Bien Bridge. The Bat Trang ceramic village and Le Mat snake village are located here.
* Thanh Xuân District: houses Royal City, Asia's largest underground mall. Inside this mall, there are an ice-skating rink and a water park. The plaza above ground have large, cheesy looking Greek god statues. 

Other urban districts:
* Bắc Từ Liêm District 
* Hà Đông District 
* Hoàng Mai District 
* Nam Từ Liêm District: a newly formed district, almost entirely consisting of high-rises

Understand
Invading forces from every direction agree: Hanoi makes a fine capital. It has held that title for more than a thousand years, through several invasions, occupations, restorations, and name changes. The Chinese conquered the imperial city of Thang-Long in 1408 and renamed it Đông Quan. Le Loi repelled the invaders in 1428 and ascended the throne, becoming known as Lê Thái Tổ (黎太祖); for his efforts, a slew of legends about his heroic exploits, many centred around the Hoan Kiem Lake in the Old Quarter. 

The Nguyen Dynasty gave the city its modern name of Ha Noi in 1831, but they had transferred power to by then; it remained there until 1887, when the French made Saigon and then Hanoi the capital of all French Indochina. It changed hands again in 1954, when it was ceded to Ho Chi Minh and the Viet Minh after almost a decade of fighting, and it became the capital of North Vietnam; Saigon was the rival in South Vietnam. Upon reunification in 1976, it assumed that title for the entire country.

The first institution of learning in Vietnam, Quoc Tu Giam, was founded here in the 11th century. Nine hundred years later, the first western-style universities in Vietnam were also founded in Hanoi. The city is one of the leading centres of scientific study and research in the country. Hanoi retains much of its older charm of bygone eras, despite the battles that have raged over it; conflict had the side effect of making it largely oblivious to modern architecture, and as a result, few buildings in the city centre area are higher than five stories. The Old Quarter is second only to for uninterrupted stretches of colonial and pre-colonial architecture, well-preserved on dense warrens of narrow, wonderfully atmospheric streets. It trades the commercial boom and sprawl of in the South for a more understated charm, worth enjoying for an extra day or two, and with countless transport options and travel agents, it makes a perfect base for exploration of the North.

As you walk along the street, you may find that people start talking to you. It is a cultural norm there to make conversation with strangers. They might ask you where you are from and other general questions. It takes a while to get used to that. However, there are times when you find this friendliness extremely helpful, such as when you are lost or need help. 

The Tourist Information Centre, ☎ +84 4 926 3366, Dinh Tien Hoang, just north of Hoan Kiem Lake, can provide a fairly useful map although bewilderingly, the blow-up of the Old Quarter is missing, making it useless in that part of town. The Centre also offers free internet and English-language advice.

There are self-help interactive screen information booths around the Old Quarter but their purpose is to superficially conjure an image of coming-of-age "Vietnam has arrived" impression to the unsuspecting passer-by. An example was an inquiry typing out the American Embassy as prompted by an empty field, then it flashed on to the next interactive page asking for which district (one may not be aware that the US embassy has branches in every district) - smart and amazing!

Climate

The climate is tropical, with wet and hot weather much of the year. But due to the city's latitude, temperatures drop drastically in the wintertime and the wind chill and dampness means winter weather can feel cold. If possible, avoid the summer months of mid May to mid September, as the city turns into a sweltering sauna with little to no wind.

Get in

By plane
Most people arrive at the Noi Bai International Airport (), 35km (45-60min) north of the city. For decades, the Noi Bai airport was small and heavily congested. Queues used to be long, but still shorter than Ho Chi Minh City's Tan Son Nhat. With the 2015 opening of the international terminal, immigration has become a lot faster, usually taking around 10-15 minutes. The new terminal is clean and modern with lots of sunlight. Shopping options however are overpriced and limited. Several airlines run flights from Noi Bai, including:

* Aeroflot (-Sheremetyevo)
* Asiana Airlines (-) 
 
* Cebu Pacific () 

* China Airlines () 

* China Southern Airlines (, ) 

* Cathay Dragon ()

* Nok Air also offers cheap flights to 

* Tigerair (Singapore) ☎ +84 4 94 54565) - low-cost carrier with 6 weekly flights to/from its hub in .

If departing from Noi Bai airport via Vietnam Airlines with no checked luggage, walk to the last airline check-in counter and to the right of it, there's a sign showing check-in for passengers without checked luggage. Using this counter is a great time-saver if it applies to your journey.

From the airport
* Express bus 86 Hanoi opens a new high quality public bus from Hanoi train station to Noi Bai Airport. The bus stop is directly in front of the two terminals. Most airport employees would be happy to direct you there as well. The bus will run at 5:10 AM in the morning in Hanoi station and 6:30 AM in Noi Bai airport with an interval of every 20/30 minutes. It'll finish at 10:30 PM in the evening in Hanoi station and 11:30PM in Noi Bai airport. You'll spend 50-55 minutes/one way for transfer 30.5 kilometers from the airport. The authorities expect that having 80-94 round trips/day with 45.000 VND one way (28JUN2022). The purpose of opening the new bus improves transfer for tourist, especially, foreigners visiting Hanoi. Within Google Maps you can add the route map. For the Old Quarter it stops in front of the Post Office at Hoan Kiem lake. It also stops in front of the "Melia Hanoi" hotel: to catch a shuttle to the airport, wait at the bus stop across the road from Melia (not the stop directly in front of Melia).

* Public buses to the city centre from Noi Bai airport take about 1.5h. Bus #7 crosses the Thang Long bridge and goes to the Daewoo Hotel on the western part of Hanoi (almost an hour on foot to the historical centre of Hanoi). To catch bus #7 from the international terminal, exit the arrivals level and then left, keep walking right past the taxis and minibuses, past the outside restrooms and to the bus stop which is located in the corner of the parking lot and is equipped with an easily noticeable shelter. Bus #17 goes straight to the Old Quarter (Long Bien bus terminal), it doesn't stop at the international terminal (March 2016), perhaps as a courtesy to local taxi drivers milking the touristic cash cow; however it does serve the domestic terminal, which is just 1 km away from the international terminal in the eastern direction (upon exiting the international terminal, walk to the left, past the bus#7 shelter and follow the pedestrian walkway conveniently connecting the two terminals). Luggage is permitted aboard the buses, as of March 22, 2016, you're not supposed to pay extra for it, unless it's the size of a tiger cage. Ticket price for bus #17 is VND9000, as of March 2016. Don't listen to taxi drivers or shuttle bus operators that claim the stop for the public buses is a few kilometers away or that service has been terminated. Public buses operate 05:00-22:00. Bus 90 begins at the international terminal bus stop then to the domestic terminal, and ends at Kim Ma bus station with stops on Lac Long Quan, Hoang Hoa Tham, Van Cao, Lieu Giai, and Kim Ma. This direction operates from 06:40-22:30. From Kim Ma station to the airport (domestic terminal first, ending at the international terminal), the bus goes along Giang Vo, Kim Ma, Lieu Giai, Van Cao, Thuy Khue, Lac Long Quan. This direction operates from 05:30-21:10. Tickets are 9,000VND and the buses are orange. The journey takes about 55 minutes. Many locals and airport workers take the #90 bus, so space is limited. There are no luggage racks available on this bus.

* Shuttle-buses from the airport to Hanoi stop at the Vietnam Airlines Office on 1 Quang Trung (a bit south of the old quarter but conveniently stocked with taxis and motorbike drivers, of course!). Tickets are sold in the building in front of which the minibuses park, or you can give the fare directly to the driver. The fare is USD2 or 40,000 dong for foreigners (insurance reasons), and 35,000 dong for Vietnamese (which includes Vietnamese-Americans), which rate is indicated on the sticker fixed to the bus's body. The driver will potentially give you trouble if you have additional bags, but if you push, you will get the same USD2 rate. They also try the 'typhoon in Ha Long Bay' scam whereby they take you to a street where you cannot see the hotel name and tell you that the Ha Long Bay guests are still in the hotel and they will take you to their other hotel for the same price. This place is a complete dive facing the highway. You should also beware the drivers trying to offer you a ride to your hotel for USD5, claiming the Old Quarter is 5km from the office - it is much cheaper to go to the Vietnam Airlines office and switch to a taxi (or walk, it's not more than 2km to anywhere in the Old Quarter). The taxi will not cost more than the USD3 price differential and if it does, you should refuse to pay as the driver has cheated you somehow. They say that the shuttle buses go to the airport hourly, but they will only leave when the bus is full (took 2+ hours in one case) and will not tell you this. Meanwhile the taxi drivers, who are supposed to offer the same service, will constantly offer to take you to the airport. Despite the fact that the shuttle buses are supposedly run by Vietnam Airlines, the employees in the office across the street don't have any information on the buses, and tourists will get scammed (or waste time) if traveling alone. Note: as of October 2014 it's been observed that 4 Vietnamese sharing a taxi paying around VND50,000 each. So it's possible to go with an un-metered taxi for VND200,000-300,000 from the Vietnam Airlines stop to the airport depending if there are too many taxis in the stop and it's convenient for them or not.

Passengers on Vietjet Air can take their airport shuttle at VND36,000 one-way, booked through their website. Buses leave hourly and the journey takes about an hour. The shuttle passes both terminals, Nhat Tan Bridge, Nghia Do Park, Daewoo Hotel, Kim Ma bus station, Hanoi train station, and ends at Thong Nhat Park on Tran Nhan Tong St.

*Taxis to central Hanoi can be hired at Noi Bai. There are fixed price taxi stands right outside the exit, offering fares ranging from USD15-25 into the city. These are provided by various taxi companies and are slightly more expensive than the tout taxis, but fixed price, so no hassles about the fare. Later into the night, there don't seem to be any physical taxi stands, however you can still negotiate directly with taxi drivers for fixed prices all the same. Some taxis will engage in negotiations while others will agree only to metered fares so shop around. Drivers in general may try to take you to a hotel of their choice or even a hotel pretending to be the one you named (your passenger door being opened by a person showing you your hotel name and correct address on a clipboard, insisting you should come in) as destination, to collect a commission, so be very specific about your destination ahead of time and on arrival if this happens, as they usually give in. To be sure, have the address ready and maybe print out a map beforehand: since every street in Hanoi has clearly visible street signs at both ends, you should be able to discern which street you are in. Non fixed-price taxi agents will quote prices ranging from around USD15-30 as you leave the airport, so be sure you have a clear price agreement also with the driver before getting into the car, as the price quoted by the agent may not be what the driver is expecting.

Be careful of agreeing to operating the taxi meter: the meter may be tampered with, and can run upwards of USD40-60 or more to get to central Hanoi, and the upper limit is entirely out of your control. If you have changed money into dong at the airport you can, of course, pay in local currency. November 2014: there is no longer an official fixed price taxi service from Noi Bai to the city! It may be possible to negotiate something with an individual driver, but they will generally request you use the meter. The total cost will vary between around 325,000-475,000 depending on the company and your destination. It may also be possible to secure a lower (fixed) rate if you book in advance. April 2015: Taxi drivers will still agree to a fixed price and most quoted 350-400k to the Old Quarter which is the same that a properly set taxi meter will run (driver agreed to 360k and taxi meter ended up at 358k, using silver/pink ABC taxi).

There are a few official looking tourist information booths inside the arrival hall that will offer rides into the city for significantly higher prices than the taxi stands outside -- USD25-35 per car as they tell you not to take the cheaper taxis outside because of various scams.

To sum things up, taking a fixed-price taxi from one of the companies outside of the arrival hall is the least costly way with the least risk of surprises to get to your destination. However if you do this, as mentioned above, make sure to be very clear on the agreed price with the taxi driver himself and confirm that the taxi driver agrees to take you to your hotel's exact address.

* Motorcycle taxis (xe om) are not allowed at the terminals, but can pick you up from the motorcycle shelter 300m outside the international terminal (turn left as you exit). A motorcycle taxi ordered through the Grab app will cost about US$6-7 for the 45min ride to Hoan Kiem District. Motorcycles are not allowed on the main highway, but will take parallel slip roads instead. You'll make up the time once you enter town and buses/taxis get ensnared in traffic.

* Private Transfer pick you up from the airport and drop you off at your hotel. The driver will holding the paper with your name that you can easily to recognize them. Cat Ba Express is one of some company provide this service, they did a good job for their business. With the price only $18 for 4 seaters car or 7 seaters car with $20, they will waiting for you at the airport even your fly delay for some reason. They also provide 16 seaters or more than that, you can feel free to contact them at " You can chatting with them and they will ask for some detail then they are willing to send a confirmation through your email (normally other place ask you to order through their email at the first time and it is watse so much time to contact and reply) then you can just confirm everything are correct or not. ALl the payment you can pay when you get in the car.
*They also provide a private car to some famous place with a really good price that your all family can travel by yourselves.

*If you already have a hotel booked, you might ask the hotel to dispatch a driver. The nicer hotels will do this and put the fare on your room bill. An $18 fare is fair for an airport pickup, and it is possible to get to the airport for $15 (Oct 2015).

By train
Trains to , depart from Gia Lam Station (Latitude: 21.05213, Longitude: 105.87939), about 5km north-east of Hanoi Station. Tickets can be purchased from Hanoi Station, too. In Hanoi Station, international ticket booth clerk may go to work much later than other booths', like 09:30 in the morning. A ticket for a soft sleeper compartment (4-berth compartment) costs 1.060,000 dong per person. Be cautious buying these tickets from hotels or travel agents in the Old Quarter, as they may quote prices substantially higher. If you are taking the evening train out of Nanning, you will arrive at Gia Lam very early in the morning. Be sure to change some of your money at the border so you can get a cab to take you to the city when you arrive in Gia Lam. Exchange the rest of your money for a better rate in the city the next day.

All other trains use the main Hanoi train station for daily services from cities in the south including and . The Reunification Express goes all the way to , although there is very little 'express' about it.

There are also train services to the north-west (including , from which you reach . To board trains bound for these destinations, you have to enter the railway station compound through the "backdoor" at Tran Quy Cap station. Just tell your driver which destination your train is heading to. Be mindful of any "helpful" stranger who offers to carry your luggage - he probably has a sum more than the cost of the ticket in mind for the help.

Tickets for all destinations are sold in the main station, though there are two counter halls, north and south, serving the respective destinations. 

Technically, there is a queuing system in place to buy tickets at Hanoi Station which involves obtaining a numbered docket and waiting to be called up to one of the ticket counters. In practice, the process is chaotic and many locals disregard the system altogether, often pushing their way to the counters to be served (Update April 2013: nobody uses the queue any more; instead fight your way to the counters or you will be waiting around for hours). If travelling to Nanning, China, it is advisable to ask a staff member where to go, as not all counters can sell these tickets. 

Buy your tickets as early as possible, especially since sleeper-tickets can be sold out several days in advance. If you can't get a ticket any more, try a travel-agent who still might have stocks. You may also try your luck in the station just before boarding time, agents still holding tickets will be eager to sell as the departure draws near. Nevertheless, travel agencies in Hanoi are known for their bad business practices. Some of them will try to overcharge you up to 300%, so it is better go to the train station by yourself and find out about the prices before you agree on any deal. 

If you have very rigid travel dates, are travelling on a public holiday, or can't be bothered to head down to the train station before your train you can book tickets online before you come to Vietnam. Tickets to LaoCai/Sapa can be booked at 

By bus
Public buses serving southern destinations (e.g. , 2h - VND80,000) leave from Giap Bat bus station. To get from the Giap Bat bus station to the old quarter and Hoan Kiem Lake, leave aside all the hassle of taxi and motorbike drivers and simply take public bus number 8 towards Long Bien (VND5,000, pay on the bus) - to find it head towards the main road inside Giap Bat station, you will see signs with numbers indicating the stops of different bus lines.

Most of the "open-tour" bus itineraries either begin or end in Hanoi, with the next (or previous) stop (12-14h, USD13 - 18), and from there to , , , , , and other cities in , depending on the bus company. Most seem to stop at their office which could be right next to the old district and most backpacker hotels. Check when booking your ticket.

Many of the same companies also sell tickets to and in (USD16-18). Do some research before you buy a ticket as rattle-trap scam buses abound on this route.

See if you're interested in crossing over to by bus or train.

Get around
 
Taxis are the best way to travel long distances, but the cyclos, or pedicabs, are a cheap way to make shorter trips. Taxi fares are not always consistent, and the rates for each taxi company have not been standardized. For lone travellers, rides on the back of motorbikes (actually low-powered scooters) are popular too (known as xe om, literally meaning motorbike-hug). Uber has also launched in Hanoi, and while they has a few districts they operate on, they do offer more consistent pricing than taxis.

By taxi

Use only reputable and reliable taxi companies, which include Hanoi Group Taxi (+84 4 3856-5656) and Mai Linh Taxi (+84 4 3861-6161). As a reference, Hanoi Group Taxi charges an initial fee of VND14,000 covering the first few kilometres, then VND16,300 for every additional kilometre, with 6,000 dong for every 5min of travel. Thanh Nga Taxis (+84 4 3821-5215) are cheaper with smaller, hatchback cars, starting at VND9,000 and VND12,000/km.

Some drivers will attempt to negotiate a flat fee in advance rather than use the meter. If you have a fair idea of how far you're going or how much you're willing to pay, this is probably a good idea. If the driver refuses, turning around and walking away will almost certainly change his mind.

It has become common for drivers of less reputable companies to "fix" their meters to run faster. While meters may operate "normally" initially, they start jumping faster after you've let your guard down. A 10min drive can rack up almost US$30 in downtown Hanoi alone! Some taxis are known to lock passengers in and demand large amounts of US dollars before letting them go. The driver may threaten to have you beaten up or arrested, but will let you go if you kick up enough of a fuss.

Another common scam is that the driver takes you for "sightseeing", and extends the tour to make more money. This is very hard to discover unless you know the city well, but if you catch your driver doing this (e.g. going around Hoan Kiem Lake twice), demand that they stop the taxi and leave the taxi without paying.

Most taxi drivers speak limited English, so it's a good practice to get your hotel to write the name and address of you destination in Vietnamese to show the taxi driver, and get your hotel's business card in case you get lost.

Be vigilant when taking a taxi; the driver may jump out at the destination and dump most of your bags out of the trunk. While you're busy putting your rucksack on, he has taken off with your other bags.

When getting off your taxi wait for the driver to open the door, or check both front and back to see if there are any motorcycles whizzing past before opening your door. Although Vietnam is right-hand traffic, ghost motorbike riders could be approaching your taxi on the wrong side.

By ridesharing

With Uber exiting the market, Grab is the main game in town, offering GrabCar (private car), GrabTaxi (metered taxis using the Grab app), and GrabBike (motorcycle taxi, helmet provided). Grab users must have internet access to book a ride. Prices are quoted upfront, and are usually cheaper than metered taxis or negotiating with drivers. English is limited, but the drivers are friendly.

By motorbike driver
Motorbike drivers ("Xe Om" in Vietnamese) can be found on virtually every corner, especially in the Old Quarter. Expect to be offered a ride every half-block (or more). You should absolutely negotiate a fare in advance. As a general rule, a reasonable fare should cost around 10,000 dong per kilometre of travel for a motorbike (possibly varying 10,000 dong in either direction), so know the distance you are travelling or understand that you have no real basis for negotiating a fair rate. Walk away towards the next street filled with motorbike drivers if you don't like their offer, as this is an incredibly reliable bargaining technique. There are far more drivers than tourists, and they know it - your fare could be the only one they get all day.

You should also write down the negotiated fare (with all zeros) to avoid confusion. Even if you do speak Vietnamese, a driver might mis-hear (accidentally or intentionally) that you said 50,000 dong instead of 15,000, In case of argument over fares after the ride, keep calm and repeat the original agreement (remember, you have the leverage). Many drivers will accept US dollars as well. At the end of a ride, some will offer to hang around to drive you to your next destination - either be clear that you don't want a return ride (and don't go near him when you leave), or get a price in advance. Otherwise, you might be surprised when the driver tacks on several million dong for having waited.

Keep your wallet out of arms reach of the drivers when you pay, less honest motorbike drivers are not adverse to helping themselves to the cash they think they are entitled to and promptly taking off without waiting for your consent.

By cyclo
Negotiate first or avoid using the cyclos services, they can demand 200,000 dong (USD10) for a short ride of less than 100m (330&nbsp;ft). At the end of the journey, a few men will come over to translate, and they will pretend to help and later insist that you pay the demanded amount. (VND100.000 for 1 hour is good price, included tip - you have to agree this beforehand.)

Be aware that it is common for cyclo drivers to agree to a price, then take you to a different place, pretend to be confused and hit you up for more money when you reach your destination.

If you chose to travel by cyclo, be clear on your destination, negotiate your fee first (100,000 dong is more than fair for a 30-34 minute ride in any direction), be willing to get out and walk away (if your driver tries any monkey business), also be willing to walk away at the end of the journey if the driver won't stand by your original agreed price.

Motorbike rental
Motorcycles can be rented for around USD5-6 a day, and can be arranged by most hotels. A typical bike will be given with 1 litre of fuel, so top up at the nearest petrol kiosk. Queue up with the other bikes, unscrew your fuel cap and hand over your money (USD1 per litre) to the attendant who will top up your bike for you. 

This is good for making lots of trips around the city for individuals or duos, but be careful: Hanoi is a great place to sharpen motorbike skills, provided you emerge alive. Park on the sidewalk with other bikes, and be sure to lock the front wheel. Locals will help arrange the bikes near their stores. Many shops that have bike attendants will give you a ticket in exchange for parking your bike. This may or may not come with a fee (typically ranging from 2,000-5,000 dong). However, parking at Hoan Kiem lake on a weekend can go up to 10,000 dong. The ticket will either have your license plate number written on it, or the ticket itself will be numbered, with that number subsequently chalked somewhere on your bike. In such cases (where you've been given a ticket), the attendants may ask that you NOT lock the steering column or front wheel of your bike so that they can rearrange the bikes as customers come and go.

Riding outside the city is a refreshing change. Winding through the alleys and through the local markets inaccessible by cars allows you to see Hanoi from a different perspective. Google maps are rather useless once you leave the city due to the number of small lanes, forked roads and roundabouts that do not show up on the map. Stop and ask locals for directions, so be sure to brush up on the correct pronunciation of your destination!

The Riverbank fields just past the flower market can be a great trip within the city stop at the KUB Cafe on route and the staff there will give you some suggested routes around the flower fields.
* MOTOGO is a well-known motorcycle rental in Vietnam, it's headquarter located in Hanoi and some branches based in Ninh Binh, Da Nang and Ha Giang as well. All motorbikes are brand new and maintained really well. You can pick up a bike in one place and return to another place belonging to MOTOGO network.

Motorbike sales
Motorcycles can be bought and sold by foreigners. Many travellers opt to buy their own bike and ride it throughout the country. A lot of riders prefer to start in Hanoi and ride to Saigon as popularized by the British "Top Gear" TV series (although they did it the other way round and swapped to the train for the second half). Many people are unsure about the legality of purchasing bikes in Vietnam. Technically it is illegal for foreigners to own bikes in Vietnam without the proper documentation. However, this law is not enforced and thousands flock to Vietnam annually to buy bikes and ride them all over the country. It is possible to convert your driving licence from your home country to a Vietnamese licence, but few people go through this trouble. It is a well-known fact among riders that the police in Vietnam are highly unlikely to carry out routine traffic stops on foreigners. As long as the rider cares for his or her own safety and the safety of other road users they can go the entire trip without hassles. Most vendors do not sell bikes, they only rent them. There are some trusted companies selling bikes in Hanoi with good track records. The KUB cafe (Kustom Urban Bike) #12 ngõ 264 Âu Cơ, Tây Hồ, Hà Nội offers a great starting point for your journey by motorbike or a great place to end your trip in Vietnam, It's run by bikers for bikers of all sizes.

By bus
Scam free, cheap but a bit difficult to comprehend at first, the buses in Hanoi are relatively fast and surprisingly comfortable. Pick up a map with printed bus lines at the Trang Tien street (the book street by the Opera house) and spend a few minutes to identify the more than 60 bus lines, find your bus stop, wait for the bus, get on and off you go. On the bus you pay the 7,000 dong to the conductor who will come to you. If you are unfamiliar with the city, make sure to tell the mostly helpful conductor where you want to get off. Stops are often unannounced and do not have signs with their names on them, although there are now some newer buses with LED displays and lilting voices announcing the next stop. It's best to ask the driver or conductor when to get off.

By car
Hanoi's traffic is chaotic, with seemingly perpetual traffic jams, and a large number of almost suicidal motorcyclists and pedestrians. As such, driving yourself around is not recommended and because the International Driver's License is not allowed in Vietnam, and you should leave your transportation needs in the hands of professionals.

By metro

Hanoi Metro opened Line 2A from Cat Linh to Yen Nghia in 2021, but doesn't serve many places of interest to tourists. Line 3 from Nhon to Hanoi train station has been delayed, and is not expected to open until 2023.

Museums

Note: Many museums are closed on Mondays and Fridays, please check before you go.

* This often overlooked museum has recently benefited from an extensive renovation of its permanent exhibitions. The modernised interior is well laid out with information in Vietnamese, English and French, and contains a huge amount of information on the fearsome female heroines of Vietnamese history. There are also exhibitions on the rituals and traditions surrounding women in the family, as well as a beautifully presented collection of intricate hand-made ethnic costumes. A particular highlight are the regularly updated special exhibitions on a diverse range of subjects, from contemporary issues such as single mothers and street vendors to traditional medicine and Mother Goddess worship. English language tours are available on request.

* The city down south may have his name, but only Hanoi has the man himself, entombed in distinctly fashion - against his wishes, but that's how it goes. No talking, revealing clothing (shorts should be knee length and no exposed shoulders), or other signs of disrespect allowed while viewing; photos are allowed only from outside, in the grand Ba Dinh Square. Purses are allowed into the tomb, but expect them to be searched by several bored soldiers along the way. Water bottles not allowed. Left luggage is handled in a complicated scheme: there is an office near the street for large bags, with separate windows for Vietnamese and foreigners, and a further office for cameras, which will be transported to a third office right outside the exit of the mausoleum. Items checked in at the first office, however, will stay there. Note that small digital cameras can be taken into the mausoleum despite their use not being permitted inside. Note also that the mausoleum is closed for a couple months around the end of the year, when the body is taken abroad for maintenance.

* This gleaming white museum and its gloriously ham-handed iconography are the perfect chaser to the solemnity of the mausoleum. The building, completed in 1990, is intended to evoke a white lotus. Some photos and old letters are on display on the second floor, but the main exhibition space is on the third floor. It includes cars crashing through walls to represent the chaos of post-war American capitalism, soldiers charging around with electric plugs, a cave hideout re-imagined as the inside of Ho Chi Minh's brain, and several other post-modern confections integrated with the main story of the man's life and his country's struggle. One of the more informative museums in Vietnam, albeit with a high dose of personality cult and political propaganda. Guides are available in English, French, Chinese and Russian, but don't bother; the displays are labelled in English and French, and it's hard to imagine the guides doing much other than belabouring the point.

* The exit from the mausoleum takes you right into the grounds of the, uh, vestige, where Ho Chi Minh lived and worked from 1954 until his death in 1969. The nicely landscaped complex includes two of Ho Chi Minh's houses, kept shiny and "as he left them" by the authorities, as well as a garage with two of Ho's "used cars" and a carp-filled pond. The Presidential Palace is also nearby, but it's not always open to visitors. Pamphlets are available in English, Chinese, French, and Korean. Guided tours are usually available if you wait. Paying is not enforced unless you are one of the unlucky few to be outed from the crowd.

* Travellers find the One-Pillar Pagoda either charming and lovely or utterly pointless, depending on how many tour groups are crammed into the small grounds at the time of their visit. 

* Only party-approved Socialist art is shown here and most of the rooms have an small board explaining the history, aesthetics, and techniques of the paintings in that exhibit in Vietnamese, French, and English. It is an interesting museum at any rate, with pieces such as the wonderful pictures of soldiers on boats depicted on prehistoric bronze drums, Buddhist art, and revolutionary art of the 20th century wars. Also some interesting silk paintings.

* Vietnam's military history extends back some two millennia, and this museum covers it on four buildings with interesting pieces. Item descriptions on museum exhibits are in Vietnamese, French and English. On display outside are the ubiquitous MiG-21 jet fighter, T-54 tank and many bombs and articles captured on Indochina and Vietnam wars. closed monday and friday.

* There's a decent outdoor collection of a UH-1 helicopter, Soviet-built MiG fighters, a huge Mi-6 helicopter, and other aircraft; unfortunately they've been exposed to the elements for some time and local kids climb over them.

* This is a collection from Vietnamese history from about 1,000 years back until 1945. Many antiques along with replicas where the originals are in situ.

* This museum gives a very informed and detailed account of the Vietnamese struggle against first the French (starting in 1858 -- on the first floor), then against the Americans (on the ground floor - ending on 30 April 1975). It is housed in a colonial French building which was completed in 1932. The building, designed by the architect Ernest Hébrard is considered as a successful blend between the colonial French architecture and traditional Vietnamese architecture, called Indochina architecture. He created double-walls and balconies for a natural ventilation system and protection from sunshine.

* covers mainly the culture and ritual practices of the various ethnic groups in the whole of Vietnam - one of the key attractions of the museum is the open-air exhibition, which has houses of some ethnic groups, which even comes with inhabitants in costumes. The museum features actual explanations of the exhibits in Vietnamese, French and English. The Museum of Ethnology houses the excellent chocolate and baguette cafe, which has excellent fare at a reasonable price - an excellent pit-stop after the museum visit.

* 

Temples

* The Temple of Literature was founded in 1070 and established as the country's first university six years later. The courtyard features numerous stone tablets, each mounted on the back of a tortoise, with the names of graduates over the centuries.

* Extends out into the lake, with small but attractive grounds, displays on Vietnamese history and, more memorably, displays on the giant turtles, including a mummified specimen. The site is frequently very crowded with tourists.

* Time: the 12th to the 13th day of the second lunar month. Objects of worship: Bach Ma God (the symbol of God of sun), Long Do Spirit (the defender of the east), confer a title of “Thang Long Capital of Nation royal tutelary god". Xuan Nguu presenting rite.

* A fairly recent temple founded only 23 years ago with the object of worship, Hani Goddess (the symbol of the Vietnamese Goddess of beauty and love). Displays of Vietnamese wonderment and beauty. Locals and tourists are just beginning to understand this magnificent specimen.

Parks

* A pleasant park in the centre of town, within easy walking distance from anywhere in the Old Quarter. It's the locals' favourite leisure spot, and a great place to watch people practising tai chi in the morning or to sit and read in the afternoon. Hoan Kiem means "returned sword", and the name comes from a legend in which King Le Loi was given a magical sword by the gods, which he used to drive out the invading Chinese. Later, while boating on the lake, he encountered a giant turtle, which grabbed the sword and carried it down to its depths, returning it to the gods from whom it had come. (You can see a version of the legend at the Water Puppet Theatre - see below.) Rumour has it the giant turtles still inhabit the lake. A mummified specimen is on display at the Ngoc Son Temple.

* mostly a residential hub of the well-to-do. Hotel Intercontinental and Hanoi Sheraton are on this lake front. The shores are occupied by numerous fishermen.

* One can always feel the diversity and liveliness of Hanoi there. In the morning, there are low-energy aerobics class for the elders and aerobic class for younger in the morning. During the day, one can enjoy the tranquillity in the park since everybody is either at work or in school. In the afternoon, it becomes a playground for children and students as well as for soccer teams and badminton players.

* The park faces Hoan Kiem lake with a beautiful view of the busy Hang Bai street and the serenity of the willows on the bank of the lake. Once known as Chi Linh Garden, then Indira Gandhi Park, many Hanoians view this mini-park as their favourite place because it is a symbol of the integration of modernity and tradition. One would surely encounter a group of youths who is practising hip-hop and break dance while at the same time, meeting a three-generation family enjoying a walk in the park.

Wartime sites
* This prison was built by the French at the turn of the 20th century, in classical French prison design. This is where the French imprisoned and executed many of the Vietnamese revolutionaries. Now a museum (2/3 of the prison was torn down to make way for the Hanoi Towers), the museum exhibits the brutal French colonial regime and the struggle of the Vietnamese people against imperialism in chilling details. The prison was also known as the "Hanoi Hilton" during the Vietnam War as it held American POW's shot down. Little emphasis is given to this period however, and the exhibits shown can be frustratingly skewed in propaganda, choosing to show solely regime sanctioned photos of prisoners being treated well and playing basketball, playing chess, and other staged events. They also claim to have John McCain's flight suit from when his plane was shot down.

* Until 19 December 1972, this was just a small brackish pond just off Hoang Hoa Tham Street, about 1km west of the mausoleum. On that day, in a twisted retelling of the Hoan Kiem legend (see above), Vietnamese anti-aircraft guns took the eight-engined, 100-ton plane and sent it to the shallow bottom of the lake, where it remains today. There are more interesting things to see at your local junkyard.

* Along Thanh Nien Street on Truc Bach lake there is a stone plaque commemorating the shooting down of a US Navy (not "USAF" as depicted) aircraft in 1967. Peruse the Vietnamese script and you can pick out the name of John McCain, one of the airmen.

* Retells the stories of many battles throughout the country’s history. There are documents as well as models in the museum to make the retelling more interesting. They have the model of the B-52 plane, tanks and even canons.

Kids Attraction
*Water Puppet Theater - Heart warming for every age. The show takes ~50 minutes. Admission is 100,000 for adults, 60,000 for children. If the children can sit on your lap you might save on their admission.

*Thong Nhat Park - The park next to the Ha Noi Circus has a playground and some attractions, entrance is 2,000 for children, 4,000 for adults. It features a large lake and walking path- as well as Swan Boats available at the south end.

Lang Toi - My Village is a production of Lune Production.

* Performances on Wednesday, Friday and Sunday at 20.00. A visit to Ca trù Hanoi Club should be the first priority for ones who love Asian traditional arts and aristocratic court music. Ca trù is an unique and fascinating genre of chamber music in Vietnam which traces it roots back to the 10th century. It is performed by a female vocalist who sings a repertoire of poetic melodies using her vibrato and unique breathing techniques. Rhythm is kept using aphach, which the singer manipulates by striking three wooden sticks against a bamboo bar; an accompanying instrumentalist plays the three-stringed lute dan day; a drummer using a small drum completes the trio. The songs are all fascinatingly restrained and expressive, at times hauntingly beautiful. Today, ca trù is promoted by the government of Vietnam as the country's national asset, and it was officially recognized by UNESCO as one of the Intangible Cultural Heritages of humankind in 2009. Attending a "ca tru" show in Ca tru Hanoi club is highly recommended for those who enjoy traditional performing arts. The atmospheric combination of sitting in a temple courtyard, imbued in soft lighting and sipping Vietnamese tea while ca tru is sung leaves a pleasant impression. Translation is provided by volunteers. 

* Thang Long Water Puppet Theatre, 57 Dinh Tien Hoang St, across the street from the shores of the Hoan Kiem Lake, ☎ +84 4 824-9494, fax: +84 4 824-5117, . A visit to the water puppet theatre is a real highlight of a trip to Hanoi. Live musicians accompany folk legends from Vietnamese history, told with wooden men, women and dragons, dancing and splashing on the face of the water. The narratives are sung in Vietnamese, but a list of titles is available in several languages. It is more of a visual-musical thing which is universal, just ignore the dialogues and narration but be on the look for special effects. Even in the 21st century, they still elicit an ahhh moment from the audience. Tickets are 60,000 and 100,000 dong. There are several performances throughout the day, and it's even possible to buy tickets even if the showing is going on for 15 minutes. And if you missed the first 15 minutes, be the last to leave and mix in with the incoming audience for the next performance. Camera passes are an extra 15,000 dong, but whether you buy one or not is purely on the honour system. Don't worry about getting wet, but the seats are very small, and visitors with above-average height will have to squirm a bit.

* Golden Bell Show is a collection of Vietnamese traditional art performances. (Golden Bell Theatre, No. 72 Hang Bac St, Hoan Kiem District. Hotline for booking tickets - ☎ +84 988 307 272, 150,000&nbsp;dong for ordinary ticket and 200,000 VND with translation headphones) Every Saturday 20:00-21:00. This is a colourful, fun, flashy Vietnamese variety show. It attempts to give the audience a little taste of different styles of dance and performance from all areas of Vietnam. The theatre is small, ensuring that every seat is a good one. The first four rows are dedicated to non-Vietnamese speakers because they are equipped with headphones that offer translation of anything spoken in Vietnamese(Only one skit requires them, all others have explanations on the walls). Tickets for these seats are 50,000 VND extra. Tip: they have almost 2x cheaper student pricing. This show is extremely entertaining and a great way to spend a Saturday night.

Gym
If you want to do some mild weight training on a budget, head to 88 Hang Buom St, a short walk from Hoan Kiem Lake. The cost is 20,000 dong per session as of February 2014. Locals apparently pay 130,000 dong/month. Be aware, however, that the gym is in very poor condition. Equipment is archaic and crowded together; some is home-made. The floor is hazardous and no one will spot you whilst benching so ensure you are able to place the bar back on the stand with your last repetition or go with a friend. The front of the gym is full of scooters and the rear wall has pictures of Uncle Ho exercising back in the day! Drinks are 10,000 dong.

Run
The streets of Hanoi have heavy traffic and make running difficult. The lack of regard that scooters and vehicles have to pedestrians make running through the streets dangerous.

There is, however, a lake south of the Old Quarter, called Hồ Hoàn Kiếm that offers a path around the lake, and good views of the Turtle Tower (Tháp Rùa) at the south end and the Temple of the Jade Mountain (Ngoc Son Temple) at the north end. At 5am there are usually a number of locals running and working out around the lake. The foot traffic at peak times around the lake is manageable for a run, and the area is well lit, with plenty of commercial businesses surrounding the lake. The distance for one lap around the lake is 1.6 kilometers (1 mile).

Rock climbing
 VietClimb,So 40 Ngo 76 An Duong, ☎ +84 914 548 903. A climbing gym that opened in 2011. Tu-Su 14:00-20:00. 200m² climbing surface, a 50m² café and terrace to chill out, and a climbing pro-shop.

Reiki Classes - Reiki 2 days course (can be arranged to do in one day if travelling) - WHAT IS REIKI?
Reiki Healing
The word ‘Reiki’ comes from two Japanese words – ‘Rei’ and ‘Ki.’
‘Rei’ is the universal life force, and represents spiritual consciousness or universal knowledge, whereas ‘Ki’ simply means energy.
We are all made up of energy. The energy flowing through our body nourishes organs and cells, keeping our physical system healthy and strong. When this energy is disrupted or blocked, it may weaken the vital functioning of our organs/cells causing physical pain or discomfort. And at the time it departs, we die. Reiki is used to cleanse your energy pathways, thereby healing your body, mind, and soul. It increases the vibratory level of energy field and prevent you from getting sick. visit for more info: 

Buy

Overcharging
Overcharging is common in Hanoi, especially on tourist markets. The mentality here is that "it is acceptable to rip off rich" - many sellers truly believe this is how they take back what was "stolen from them". Of course "rich" is defined as "anyone with more money than me". This is not limited to white foreigners only, even Vietnamese, especially from South, are routinely overcharged in Hanoi. A number of sellers won't even haggle at all after quoting a ridiculous amount, as they would rather sell a single item with 2000% profit than sell much more for a reasonable price. So if you're going to other cities, do your shopping there.

If you do need to shop in Hanoi, try to buy from younger sellers, they seem to be more honest than older sellers. Which means they'd only try only to ask 4x of the item price, and not 10x. Also at the tourist markets some stalls have "no discount" sign, and those typically offer prices much closer to reality, which should be used as a reference. Note that in Hanoi it still won't prevent a seller at the next table to ask twice the price of the "no discount" table for the same item.

Avoid sellers who set prices in dollars/Euro, as this dramatically limit your ability to haggle. Note that even $1 is still too much for many souvenirs, for which the fair price is 20,000 VND.

Money Changers
Money changers are usually in most guest houses and banks, and they give bad rates. Don't exchange money from the black market people on the streets. The best place to exchange money is at Ha Trung road and Hang Bac where they give real good rates. Just walk into the gold shops or jewellery shops and ask them if they change money and ask to show their rates. Ask up to nearly 5 or more shops to see which shop gives the best rates. Best rates are at Ha Trung which is 15-25 mins walk West from Hoan Kiem lake. Look for Hang Da Market on the pedestrian map.Its a short street of Gold traders, and small sewing factories.Correct as at Dec 18th 2014.

Inside the Noi Bai airport arrival hall, there are several money changer booths of major local banks; unlike in many airports, their exchange rate is competitive (around +/-1% to mid-market for USD) and do not seem to differ from the rate in the city offices (which you won't find at Old Quarter anyway). Besides US dollar and euro, they will change currencies of major Asian countries; that may come handy if you come from (or was traveling in) these countries. Rate vary slightly between the banks, so you may like to shop around and to see what you will get.

Currencies accepted for exchange (into Vietnamese Dong: VND) at Vietnam banks include USD / EUR / HKD / JPY, etc. But a warning about Chinese Yuans (RMB or CNY): for some strange reason Vietnam banks (at least all the ones in Hanoi) do NOT exchange Chinese currency. *If you need to change RMB into VDN, go to the gold shops @ 'Ha Trung' road (as explained above).

ATMs
ATMs are everywhere and cash is king here. The most common transaction limit at the vast majority of ATMs is 2-3,000,000 dong. A few notable ones allow larger withdrawals. Be sure to check the fee they charge. The Techcombank SE of the Hoa Lo Prison allows transactions of at least 7 million dong (these statements may be outdated). In the Old Quarter, Techcombank, Vietcombank, DongA, etc etc all have limits of 2,000,000 - 3,000,000 dong with the majority sitting at the paltry 2,000,000 dong limit. The notable exceptions are ANZ, HSBC, and CitiBank; the ANZ on the western shore of the Hoan Kiem Lake allows up to 5,000,000 dong (updated June 2014), all HSBC ATMs around the city have a limit of 5,600,000 dong (June 2014), and Citibank (there is an ATM on the north side of Hoan Kien Lake for example) leads with a 8,000,000 limit (July 2014). 

Check exchange rates daily. Jewelery shops will consistently offer a better rate than banks or hotels.

If you arrive in to Noi Bai Airport without any Vietnamese dong be careful about using the ATMs in the airport arrivals area. The BIDV ATM charges a 99,000 dong fee (as of Jan15) for a withdrawal (max 3m dong withdrawal) but doesn't notify you of this charge until the end when the transaction has completed. It might be wise to bring sufficient dong for your taxi/bus ride in to Hanoi in advance and then use one of the other ATMs (as mentioned above) with lower fees.

Markets
* A 6-story building to house the market is currently under construction; all the kiosks are now located in the neighboring area, either on Phung Hung (second-hand clothing), Duong Thanh or Ly Nam De streets. They offer everything that one can think of, from pets, groceries, prepared food to fabric materials.

* They offer everything here. What it is famous for is the fabric market on the second floor. There are many kiosks selling different types of fabrics ranging from cheap, affordable to very good quality with a high price. However, please bear in mind that when shopping, take your time. Never rush into buying anything. Sellers often give a very high price that you can bargain down to half or one-third of the original price.

* Famous for being the market for wholesalers. They have from school supplies, stuffed animals to clothing. It is quite an experience to spend some time in the market observing the sellers and buyers.

* Usually opens from 7PM, this unique market gathers on a walking street in the old quarter. Has anything from pirated DVD to traditional ornaments. Prices are but watch out for the "foreigner pricing" which is fairly common.

Bookshops
* New and used books.

Eat
Vietnamese cuisine is very diverse and most delicious. Most famous remains 'Pho Ga' (chicken noodle soup) or 'Pho Bo'(Beef noodle soup). There are various dishes including chicken, beef, fish and seafood, and there are hundreds, if not thousands, of restaurants nowadays in Hanoi catering to everyone's taste. Hanoi street food become a cuisine culture of Hanoi.

In Hanoi, there are thousands of street stalls in small kiosks on the sidewalk, with plastic tables and chairs on the pavement. Grabbing a bite at these eateries is a great way to experience the local food and culture. It is worth mentioning that food quality, freshness, and hygiene can vary greatly. A bowl of noodle soup goes for as little as 30,000 dong. Market food stalls also offer an assortment of other snacks: fruit portions, sausages, donuts, and other eats for 10,000 to 20,000 dong (Jan 2011, 0.5-1 USD). Be sure to get your change as a few vendors seem to 'forget' to return it to you, and learn a little Vietnamese because vendors often speak little to no English.

The rule of thumb is if the price is expensive, hygiene quality may or may not be OK, but if the price is cheap, definitely hygiene quality is compromised. There seemed to be no regular food Health Department inspector working regularly in the city. 

Another rule of thumb is that Vietnamese have no qualms charging double or more for tourists, as prices are seldom listed on stalls or within shops. Either learn to speak Vietnamese or prepare to pay up to 70,000 dong for that bowl of pho which locals next to you are paying 35,000 dong (as of June 2016).

To know which restaurants and dishes are highly rated by locals, try downloading popular food apps among locals such as MenuX, Foody, or Lozi on app stores. They are available in English and work with both Android & iOS.

For groceries, there is a large supermarket east of Hoan Kiem Lake (Fivimart, 27A Ly Thai To, at Tran Nguyen Han).

The suburb of Le Mat (aka the Snake Village) has numerous restaurants specializing in cobra foodstuffs. Live cobras are stored on the premises much the same way one would find live lobsters at a Western seafood restaurant. If one orders cobra blood wine from the menu, the waiter will take a live cobra, kill it on the spot, drain the blood into a shot glass of rice wine, and top it off with the cobra's still beating heart for you to gulp down! Le Mat is about ten minutes across the river from downtown, take bus 10, 15 or 17 and get off at the large "mega-mall" just beyond Gia Lam station, and walk 500 metres down the road at the right of the mall. Cobras are not cheap at around 400,000-1,000,000 dong (USD$50-) but it gets turned into a dozen unique dishes, enough to share between three or four people.

A local delicacy in the Hanoi area is dog meat (thịt chó), which is especially popular in the winter. There are a number of restaurants in the Tay Ho district. Another exotic regional taste is ca cuong, an extract from the belostomatid, or giant water bug. Just a few drops are added to noodles for the unique aroma.

Be sure to check out the boiled duck fetus eggs (same as the filipino balut) sold by peddlers almost everywhere priced at 5,000 dong. This delightful experience consists of the vendor cracking the egg in front of you, and peeling the shell and dropping the contents in a plastic micro bowl, then garnished with juliened ginger, basil leaf, and sprinkled with chili sauce. You can see the severed head and beak of your chick that fell off if you are lucky enough to have your first bite from a different spot - Bon Appetit!

Budget
Look to the Old Quarter for atmospheric street stalls and reasonably priced Western and local fare.

If you have been travelling in SE Asia for a long time, Hanoi offers excellent bread. The street baguettes are a welcome treat for western taste buds.

* Commonly, there are two kinds of “Banh it”. The first one is “Banh it la gai”, which is sticky rice cake with coconut or green bean stuffing wrapped in pinnate leaf. The second one is “Banh it tom thit” – glutinous rice cake with meat and shrimp, its name means “little meat shrimp cakes”, the stuffing is made of ground pork and shrimp mixed with spring onion and other spices.
* A traditional Bia Hoi (fresh beer) establishment, the beer here is supposedly of superior quality than found elsewhere. The food is excellent which is why it is so popular with the locals. It can be hard to find seating, the trick is to go after 1:30pm when the locals are heading back to work. Ask for Minh Chau if you need help with the menu -- she is very friendly and her English is quite good. The restaurant open at 9am to midnight. Operates with tourist menu card and charges 9,000 dong for Bia Hoi, staff consists mainly of teenage boys with no concept of service. (Jan 2014)
* some rate this as one of the best examples of Bun Cha in Hanoi, and therefore Vietnam (apparently in the south, Bun Cha is specifically advertised as Hanoi-style). For about 105,000 dong each, you'll get a bowl full of tiny pork-mince rissoles that have been char grilled over an open flame, and a plate of pork rice paper rolls that have been fried in oil, twice. With this you also get a phenomenal dipping sauce (fish sauce, made from sugar, garlic, peppers usually), a massive plate of greens and herbs, more bun (rice noodle) than you can handle, and a bottle of local beer. It's full of locals and not so many tourists, so you can be assured the experience is authentic. Great food but expect rude service. Be careful as the nems (fried spring rolls) are not included in the Bun Chat menu and they will force you to have some. It is 10,000 dong each. (May 2015)

* Good place to eat Western food in the heart of the Old Quarter, although some travellers find it expensive and the food inferior quality.

* these are an excellent way to get an inexpensive, home-cooked Vietnamese meal. The best ones have loyal followings of workers who eat there every day.

Everything here is homemade and fresh. Excellent breakfast menu and lunch/dinner options, as well as a mouth-watering array of cakes, cookies, pies and other treats. Locations also in Cambodia - Phnom Penh, Laos, Vientiane and Luang Prabang.

* Popular spot for ice cream on a hot day. Beware of motorbikes when entering the establishment, since it is sort of a drive-thru/drive-in ice cream shop. Make sure to try the local cóm or đậu xanh flavors. Also to note that the hygine in the area may be a bit dubious since many toss away their eaten ice cream sticks 

* Delicious sweet buns in four flavors: chocolate, matcha, vanilla and cheese. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. You'll smell them before you see them. 

* Amazing nachos and open late night. 

* All of the soups and sides include beef (bo) so this isn't for vegetarians.
* Many pho varieties

*Located in the heart of Hanoi, Qua Cho Que or The Old Quarter Corner Restaurant combines the best of traditional Vietnamese and Western cuisines and cultures.

Their new restaurant looks Westernized, compared with their old thatched restaurants.
* This one is great for an early breakfast or a takeaway coffee. Their Old School Bacon Baguette with back bacon is a rarity in Hanoi. Try the meat and potato pie or the veggie cheese, onion and potato pasty.
* located at center of Hanoi Old Quarter, has staff that speak English, French,Chinese and Vietnamese. It offers great Vegetarian and Vietnamese foods in 2 separate floor. It's amazing place to relax, wait and drinks as well. It will actually be a good place for those craving for Asian food upon arrival or before departure.It's one place where a good clean toilet is expected, with free Wi-Fi.
*Lovely Old Quarter expat fave serving great value Western comfort food, classic Vietnamese, and excellent veggie options (rare in meat-loving Hanoi). The head chef was a top 10 contestant in Vietnamese Masterchef! Prices very affordable: pho is just 45,000 dong ($2) - around the same as a good street place; a large beer 15,000 (70 cents); a big delicious mango milkshake 45,000 ($2); the classic Hanoi dish cha ca is 120k ($5.40) and as good as you'll have at the restaurants that specialise in it. Western mains start from 60,000 ($2.70) and focusses on good hearty German fare. The restaurant is upstairs, ignore the downstairs floor which is being worked on currently.

Mid-range

* 

* This establishment is so famous, the street is named after it, instead of the other way around. There's only one dish on the (Vietnamese-only) menu, fried fish in grease, but they've been serving it now for five generations. They traditional shrimp paste is now an optional extra. If you really love fish and shrimp, this experience might be for you. Authentic as it may be, it is a total rip-off according to the locals. For the same price, you could eat 3 meals at a decent cafe by the street. One wonders why this is recommended in most guidebooks from Lonelyplanet to Frommers.

* Cosy place for coffee and cake and it is not full of cigarette smoke unlike other cafes in Hanoi.

* Wine and Tapas Bar/Restaurant that serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. The food caters for all tastes including vegetarians and kids.

* An amazing restaurant with the trademark green pea pods as the logo. Without a doubt one of the more hip dining experiences of Hanoi. The interior alone is worth a look, while the menu is delightfully eclectic.

* Restaurant at Bamboo Hotel, 32,Hang Be. Why risk street food when this cosy, friendly and clean place offers good food, ambience, and at prices cheaper than in Malaysia and Thailand ? After your experience with street food, you will be coming here everyday. We went lunch and dinner as well almost everyday except when away for day trips out of the city.

The most special cuisines at his restaurant are those processed from ant-eggs, in the styles of Thai people or Muong and Tay ethnic people in Vietnam.

* Fine dining with western cuisine and a good selection of wines. 70 seat restaurant, private wine room for 12 and another cosy private room for 4. A combination of old and contemporary features with a classically trained executive chef.

Drink
 is abundant in the streets of the Old Quarter. At the crossing of Ta Hien and Luong Ngoc Quyen five separate venues fill up with travellers in the evenings, but you can get more local atmosphere on some of the side streets.

Hanoi is a lively city on the weekends, but the Old Quarter closes relatively early (at midnight) on weekdays, so you might want to start your night early. Other places outside the Old Quarter stay open later and vary in closing times.

Local young people gather around the cathedral located in Ly Quoc Su to have lemon ice tea (Tra Chanh) and sunflower seeds in street bars. After dark it gets quite crowded. Tra Chanh: 8,000 to 10,000 dong.

Sit on a plastic chair in front of one of the Bia Hoi (fresh beer) establishments which are invariably situated on the corners of many of Hanoi's 'Old Quarter' streets. This preservative-free light beer is the perfect drink to sip as you watch the city's frenetic life bustle by. The beer costs typically 5,000 dong and gives you an excuse to relax and take photos of the passing local characters. Should not be missed. Moreover, once you reach the Old Quarter, you will find that almost every corner is filled with stalls selling Pho (Vietnamese noodle) and cafe (the name is not limited only to coffee, but also tea, sweets and grocery items, and yes, even to Pho!).

On T&ocirc; Tich, a small street connecting Hang Quat and Hang Gai, you can help yourself to a refreshing fruit milkshake (sinh tố) at one of the stalls (~7000 dong).

*Located on 3rd floor in a ship shaped 5 storey building overlooking Hoan Kiem Lake and Vietnam's "Piccadilly Circus". Great spot to relax in scenic location where you can watch all the traffic and pedestrians go about their business below you along their outside balcony or stay inside their comfy air-conditioned interior. They also serve food and beer.

*Located directly in the heart of Hanoi, Avalon offers spectacular, sky rise view of Hoan Kiem lake and the Old Quarter. Order from our selection of Vietnamese or Western cuisines as you enjoy a relaxing and friendly atmosphere. An extensive selection of wines and champagnes from France, hand chosen from each season to ensure the finest quality. Homemade desserts and a variety of cocktails. 

Bars
* Dramatically positioned on its own island in West Lake and reached in the evenings by a stroll along a torch-lit bridge, Sunset Bar’s tropical Asian ambiance and stunning sunset views over the lake afford guests a sanctuary from which to escape the bustle of downtown Hanoi. 
* A speakeasy bar with great music and cocktails. The only place in Hanoi to regularly book international acts and support local talent, ran by music lovers and promoters.

* A crowded bar with weekly performances by popular local singers. A place for the definitive Vietnamese entertainment scene. Has an 80,000 dong cover charge on the weekends. Seems to combine part live singing with drag performances and a host club.

* A small bar that is open all night long (A rarity in Hanoi). Knock on the roller shutters if it appears closed and once opened, a party ensues! Shisha and food also available. The staff are amazing and the owners (a lovely couple) are so friendly!

* A small bar formerly known as Le Maquis. It's more like a loud rock music binge and smoke pub than a stylish lounge, but there's usually a happy crowd until late and the place has an authentic feel.

*Small, but lively bar in the heart of the Old Quarter. Has two levels, the top floor which is usually packed with Westerners smoking loads of cigarettes. Mao himself is usually present, playing all kinds of music from his iPod. Extremely friendly dude who will strike up a conversation with anyone willing to listen. Daily specials, and LaRue for about 20,000 dong.

* This longtime institution of the Hanoi music scene has moved (Oct 2010) to an area outside the Old Quarter. The new location is much smaller than the previous location, but is still run by the same Mr. Quyen Van Minh. It is now attached to the MaLai Deli and Red Arecas Restaurant. Drink options are still available, but food will have to be sourced from one of the two adjoining restaurants.

* a communal spot with friendly services. three floors are three beautiful views and comfortable place. put your bag anywhere then you can have a rest. Insipid coffee.
 
* Due to a licensing agreement finishing, this is no longer known as "Seventeen Saloon", though the format is largely unchanged. Nightly live cover band, a multitude of provocatively dressed waitstaff, and somewhat expensive drinks.

* A nice little bar for cheap and good fruit shakes. As the name suggests, very young audience, that sits each night on ridiculous amounts of little chairs on the sidewalks, taking their fruit shakes.

* Dramatically positioned on its own island in West Lake and reached in the evenings by a stroll along a torch-lit bridge, Sunset Bar’s tropical Asian ambiance and stunning sunset views over the lake afford guests a sanctuary from which to escape the bustle of downtown Hanoi.

* At La Terrasse, inspired by the famous Parisian cafés, visitors are plunged into the heart of Hanoi's bustling urban life. Observing passers-by, reading the papers, sipping a glass of Perrier, time slips by imperceptibly. Café furniture, antique ceiling fans and the street life … a whiff of France wafting right in the heart of Vietnam. 

Track Bar right under the Long Bien Bridge is no longer open. A lot of locals usually suggest it but keep in mind that it closed 9 Sep 2012.

Breweries
There are many breweries in Hanoi that serve czech or german styled beer. Mainly they have a black and a blond beer with more malt and hops than the light bia hoi, the full list can be seen at " You can also book beer tours here. Some of the bigger breweries are Hoa Vien and Goldmalt. There is no ale in Vietnam, to visit one of the local breweries is the closest you can get an ale.

Work
Many people plan to move to Hanoi for a year to relax before "settling down". This plan often falls apart at the job phase. Many people will find it difficult to get a job relevant to their interests, especially if they do not speak Vietnamese. However, hostels and hotels in Hanoi may need bar staff, night porters, and the like who speak English and other languages. There are also specialist websites for English and non-Vietnamese speakers looking to work in Hanoi and they are a often a good place to start.

One of the most common and popular jobs in Hanoi is becoming an English teacher. There is a mix of private and public schools, as well as informal at home classrooms. Some of these institutions will provide a working visa, but most will not. Keep in mind that it is illegal to work on a tourist visa.

There are many flexible office companies in Hanoi that enable you to rent office space for a short term or a long term.

Hanoi also has several excellent coworking spaces offering workspace, community events and great wifi. Hub.it is popular with entrepreneurs and hosts a regular calendar of tech and startup events. ClickSpace Coworking Villa located on an atmospheric lane outside the city center, and Spacebar Coworking Cafe attract a diverse array of digital nomads and freelancing expats.

Party
The above section on bars is mainly for those who just want to drink quietly by themselves and is entirely irrelevant to those who interpret "bars" as "where can I go to have a lively atmosphere or meet people or party?". Many of the listed bars are largely empty even during peak hours and are for people who want to have a quiet drink alone or with a small group of friends. Some of them may not even exist anymore. On the bright side, if you are interested in mingling or partying in Hanoi, this section addresses your needs.

Please keep in mind that, due to city ordinances, all eating and drinking establishments are required to shut down at midnight and it is strictly enforced every day of the week. Parties wind up at 8pm and wind down shortly after the required shut down.

Beer Street - Ta Hien Street is the central heart of the party district in Hanoi. By 9pm the sidewalks are filled with the party going crowd drinking and eating outdoors at the local establishments. This is generally a good starting base if you are looking to party. Local bars pack the street and are largely irrelevant to know by name before arriving, as they are all packed in such close proximity on Ta Hien street that it is more sensible to simply go and choose a venue of your preference once you arrive.

Downtown Central Backpackers Hostel - Those who have traveled Vietnam are probably familiar with the reputation of "Central Backpackers" Hostel as a wildly popular and successful hostel brand that attracts and caters to young foreign travelers who want to mingle during the day and party really hard at night. So much so that this hostel hosts very packed parties in its lobby/bar area every evening (even in off season) and is probably the single most popular backpacker venue during the evening. This is also a good place to start your night if this type of crowd appeals to you (read: zero Vietnamese people, 100% loud, drunk, happy foreigners).

In the area between Ta Hien and Downtown Central Packpackers are four major bars/clubs that are ultimately the destination of anyone who isn't at the above locations. They are patronized by varying mixes of locals versus foreigners. Temple is filled with foreigners. Hair of the Dog's 1st floor is saturated with locals while foreigners usually fill up the 2nd floor. Dragonfly is mainly locals. Rockhouse is often an even mix of both.

After the police shut down all establishments, the only venues left for foreigners to go to are Lighthouse and Tom's Bar, which are both open very late into the night. Lighthouse is a 15-20 minute walk from said establishments and is located east, across the highway. Tom's Bar at 2 Ta Hien street, and has its metal shutters down to prevent police from charging them with breaking the law, but has workers outside who will open the shutters to let you in (easily spotted from their earpieces and walkie talkies that allow them to coordinate the opening and closing of the shutters as enforcing police patrol the area) -- it is actually quite an experience to go in, as it is ultimately harmless (the bar is the only one violating laws and the police could care less about its patrons) but a fun experience to try out. There is no cover charge for either bar.

As a final note, there are actually the existence of proper large scale clubs, replete with complex sound systems, light shows, famous Vietnamese DJ's, and large venues where young people get dressed up and party late into the night. However, they are almost complete filled with locals and center around the reservation of tables with expensive alcohol bottles. Because of the focus on tables, the opportunity to mingle or meet people is much less than clubs elsewhere in the world, though there is a requisite bar area at most places where people who haven't booked tables hang out (read: single men) and can order drinks one at a time. Drinks can be expensive. However, the DJ's can be incredibly high quality and foreign DJ's are also known to be brought in to host events. The most popular clubs are The Bank, Lift, Infinity, and Rooftop, and all can be found through Google searches and are located roughly south of the Lake.

Stay safe
Compared to other cities in the developing world, Hanoi is reasonably safe, especially for tourists and expats. It is also much safer than , where violent crime, murder and pick-pocketing are far more widespread. The most important danger to watch out for is avoiding traffic while crossing the street as car and motorbike traffic saturate most tourist areas of Hanoi.

Violent crime is highly uncommon. Petty crime does happen on occasion, and usually takes the form of thievery of your valuables while in public or while in transit. Being attentive of your surroundings and valuables and using common sense should keep you safe and happy.

As an aside, while not a physical crime, the common "crime" experienced is paying more for goods and services than locals do, sometimes by double the price or more. This generally happens when paying for food, transport, hotels, and useful information about this can be found on the page. 

Like everywhere else in Vietnam, traffic in Hanoi is dominated by an incredible number of motorbikes, all of which seem to be making a mad, desperate dash for something just out of reach — all of the time. All the while blowing their horns incessantly. In other words, pedestrian traffic can be overwhelming for visitors, especially in the narrow streets around the Old Quarter. When you leave the curb, look not only both ways but left, right, back and front, and take each step slowly and patiently allowing them to pass because even an eye contact is not enough with the oncoming drivers and actually before you know it, someone is also on your back since there is no such thing as one-directional traffic in Vietnam. The key word here is slowly — don't rush. This way the drivers are aware of you, and can take you into account (along with all of the other motorbikes). It may look, and indeed is somewhat chaotic, but be patient and pay attention when you're crossing any street, large or small, and you should be fine. Definitely, the streets of Hanoi has no place for faint hearted people, with hypertension and heart problems on top of the disabled and the old. You should look everywhere as you proceed. Holding out your arm toward the stream of vehicles as a "slow down, I am crossing" sign may be a good idea but not acknowledged most of the time. Don't stop suddenly when you see one coming a little fast or rush your steps when you are crossing. Just even your pace and walk slowly. The motorbikes will find their way to avoid you themselves.

If you are exploring Hanoi on a motorbike be extremely cautious when going past stationary Taxis, expect the unexpected, like a taxi door suddenly flinging open.

Pickpockets are well organized and very fast. They may operate in groups, so please be vigilant in crowded areas. Thieves on motorbikes are known to snatch bags from cafe tables or phones out of the hands of pedestrians. Keep all eyes on your belongings, especially in crowded area like Dong Xuan night market; expect female pickpockets and don't let them surround you. If you carry a backpack or rucksack, do NOT carry it on your back especially in crowded areas with high tourist traffic eg Hoan Kiem Lake area. Pick pockets will open your bag behind you and help themselves to your belongings. Carry it in front of you instead. 

There is a dual price policy at food establishments: tourists usually pay more than locals. Be diligent about knowing the price for a meal before you order, or you may end up with a surprising bill. See the page for additional advice on how to avoid paying excessive amounts on your food bill.

Be vigilant when taking a taxi, if you have bags in the trunk, make sure he does not drive off with your bags. Ask your hotel which taxi companies are reliable - dishonest taxis are equipped with meters that run at an adjusted (much faster) rate. As of June 2014, Hanoi Group Taxi and Mai Linh are generally the two most reputable companies, though even then, dishonesty may occasionally surface from driver to driver.

Always ask the price first, and give the hawkers and taxi drivers exact change if possible. Mobile hawkers (carrying food hung on poles across their shoulders) have been known to pocket the (significant) change and stuff more food than you had intended to buy into your hands, and than quickly take off, leaving the bewildered tourist in the dust. The same is true of taxi and Xe Om drivers. Do not allow anyone to sit in the back of you on a motorbike. If this happens, disembark immediately. The person behind you may try to steal from you.

As in many Southeast Asian cities, Hanoi is hygienically challenged especially where locals congregate more to dine. Expect that there may be a non-existing Health Department, or this is not in the priority of the city government.

Hotel staff members may try to pick padlocks on travelers bags, fake mechanics throw nails at tourists on motorbikes to cause flat tires and the police, probably the worst crooks of them all, are known to steal from people (both locals and tourists) and ask for a bribe to get the items back.

Contact

 Telephone 
* Hanoi code: 4. Note the recently added '3' in front of all local numbers. Example:

* Old dialling style: 1234567 (from within the city) or 04 1234567 (inter-provincial) or +84 4 123456 (from overseas)

* New dialling style: 3 1234567 (from within the city) or 04 3 1234567 (inter-provincial) or +84 4 3 123456 (from overseas)

 Mobile 
4G internet is very cheap and readily available everywhere in Hanoi. Buying a SIM card costs between 45 000 and 55 000 dong. Unlimited internet for a month costs 40 000 Dong on Viettel (as of June 2013, rates for unlimited 4G on Viettel and the other major telco have just been raised to 50 000).

Do not buy a SIM card at the Vinaphone counter at the Hanoi airport. The lady at the counter will tell you that unlimited internet for a month costs 500 000 dong, SIM card included. She will give you a SIM card, won't set it up correctly, give you no credit and pocket the 500 000 dong. Also, be aware that she writes fake invoices.

 Viettel 
To get your remaining data balance on a 4G plan, you can text "kttk" to "191". The text will be in Vietnamese, however the number in the text given will be given in Kilobytes (KB) and counts down. For example, if you have 1.5 GB left in your data, you will see a number around "1500000" in the text.

 Internet 
There are plenty of internet cafés all over the city. Most are used by Vietnamese teens playing online dance or battle games. Rates vary, but can be as low as 3,000 dong/hr. Some of the better cafés, particularly in the Old Quarter, have computers that are Skype-capable for international phone calls. Close to Hanoi Youth Hostel there is a cybercafe that charge tourist ten times the actual cost. It is next door, and has no name. If you are not in a hurry use another one.

The cafes that charge you for using the Internet usually provide desktop computers. There are also cafes where they have free wireless. All you have to do is order something from their menus and use their wifi for as long as you want. The wifi cafes are usually concentrated around Hoan Kiem lake area.

There are restaurants and cafes with W-Fi hotspots everywhere in the city. Most restaurants and cafes that offer Wi-Fi readily advertise their Wi-Fi password.

Cope

ATM Limits
Please note before you arrive in Hanoi (or Vietnam in general) that ATM's are notorious for having low limits. Most ATM withdrawal amounts max out at 2,000,000-5,000,000 dong per withdrawal, which may be a concern if your bank charges an international withdrawal fee. While this is not necessarily a concern except for those travelers who are on a budget, please consider this and plan accordingly before arriving in Hanoi. Some strategies include bringing cash (like Thai Baht or USD) to use at money exchangers thus avoiding ATM fees, or to open an account with a bank that either has with no international transaction fees or has a branch in Hanoi (such as HSBC or ANZ).

Visa Extensions
Extending your stay in Vietnam can be done with relative ease in Hanoi. The cost will vary depending on your country of origin as well as your visa type (1 month single entry vs multiple entry vs 3 month entry etc). The most common way to extend your visa is to have an intermediary broker the transaction rather than going directly to the Immigration office to do the paperwork yourself. Every hostel, hotel, and trip agency is able to do this for you, at widely varying prices, so you should definitely ask for the cost at two or three different places to ensure you're not getting ripped off (getting a quote takes about a minute, as asking for visa extensions is a rather common request at most places). As a point of reference, a one month single-entry visa for a US citizen was quoted in June 2014 at prices ranging from $32 to $50 for an additional month extension (you can extend up to 3 months at a time, but the cost for it in the said situation ranged from $140 to $150 so it may be best to request extensions month by month), with a 4 day processing time (excluding weekends). You relinquish your passport to the broker. Please remember to get a receipt. The extension adds 30 days on top of the expiration of your original visa. For what it is worth, Hanoi City Hostel on 95 Hang Ga street did the job flawlessly for US passports for $32 (July 2014).

Get out

If you are the adventurous type or simply bored temporarily of the city atmosphere, then consider a cruise in the northern countryside. A round trip will bring you to a lot of charming villages and through hills and valleys with stunning nature. Main roads are generally in good condition and you can easily do a couple of hundred kilometers a day. The villages and provinces are generally safe at night, and you get to see a lot of Vietnamese culture such as various tribe folks. While bus services are in fact available (albeit not always reliable), a recommended alternative is to rent a bike or car and make the trip on your own. Motorbikes in decent quality can be rented for as little as US$5 a day, and many places have suggestions for routes.

* 's spectacular ocean karst topography is the most popular side-trip from Hanoi. A 2 day, 1 night Ha Long Bay cruise could be bargained down to USD45 at travel agencies. If contacting directly to the guide (on the pier in city or when the bus comes to pick up tourists) price could be USD40 or less. This price includes transportation, accommodation, all tickets and entrance fees, kayaking and food. Ask all the options to be written on your receipt and take foto of your receipt, since guide will collect it. Guide will try to scam you - ask to buy admission ticket, pay for kayaking, etc... Food is very limited on the boat, so it might be good idea to book tour without food (USD10 less) and bring your own. Drinks (even water) are not included and are quite expensive on the boat-50,000 dong, while on the mainland shops 5,000-10,000 dong. Furthermore some cruise charge 10,000 dong/bottom the guests who take their own soft drink or water and 300,000 dong for alcohol drink. Boats and cabins are ok (it is well-controlled industry). There are hundreds of cruise boats leaving everyday, most are quite similar. People who pay more, for 'deluxe' cruise often are being send on the same tour with who pays minimum price. All cabins on the same boat are nearly same, just specify in advance whether you need twin or double. Be careful in kayaking, they might give you half-broken paddles, but if it finally breaks completely, they will charge you. Beware some guild cut some program to see only 1 cave instead 2 caves.

* The mountain region, home to ethnic minorities, gorgeous mountain scenery, and trekking paths connecting many tiny mountain villages is the second most popular trip. It is accessible by bus or train to , then onward by minibus or hired motorbike. Sleeper bus 11-15$.

* is also a mountainous area with even more impressive landscape than Sapa. There aren't many tours to Ha Giang, so most travelers have to figure out their own ways. But once you get to Ha Giang, you can rent a scooter and have one of the most amazing rides among mountains, valleys and escalated rice fields. Ha Giang gets a lot more popular among backpackers in the last few years, so you will most likely find young European tourists on the way. Buses are available from My Dinh bus station.

* An ancient Buddhist pilgrimage site about 60km southwest of Hanoi. A full-day excursion that involves a boat trip to the main site, where you will hike (30-45min) or take a cable car up a mountain 90,000 dong/1 way,170,000 dong/round trip. Some travel companies are known to promise a trip up, but only provide a trip down. This saves the travel company money. Make sure to ensure if your ticket is for up or down. Some tour include cable car in the program some is an addition the customers buy after, so before decide to buy the tour should ask the agent include cable car or not. Near the top is a large limestone cave containing Buddhist shrines and statues. There are various other temples and grottoes along the way. The boat trip may include a hidden "tip" not covered by the company you book with. Additionally, the boatkeeper might pickpocket you. The boatkeeper might pickpocket you, and still demand a tip after being caught pickpocketing. The boatkeeper and tour guide might use the local police to intimidate you into paying for the luxury of being pickpocketed, along with a tip and thank you to the police and tour guide.

* , a village world-famous for its pottery, 9km southeast of Hanoi. It is accessible by taking Bus 47, which originates at Long Bien. Just hop on (the bus will be clearly labelled with the number 47 and the text "Long Bien - Bat Trang"; bus fare is 5,000 dong one-way as of Dec 2013) and take it to the last stop, which is directly opposite the pottery market (haggle for lower prices, and insist on paying in Dong). Head back up the street to the factories to see artists at work.

* , featuring the beautiful Ban Gioc waterfall, is five hours away by bus, near the Chinese border.

* The , the largest national park in Vietnam and an easy day-trip from Hanoi, 

* is the oldest ancient capital in the region; a little visited site slightly northeast of Hanoi.

* Tam Coc/Hoa Lu: Located in province, this day trip is a combines heritage tourism and natural landscape tourism. Hoa Lu is the site of the first capital of Vietnam in the 10th century, and was home to two kings-- Dinh Bo Linh (Dinh Tien Hoang) and Le Hoan-- there are now two shrines dedicated to these two kings. About 30 min away from Hoa Lu is Tam Coc three grottoes-- also known as Halong Bay on land. It features karst landforms surrounded by paddy fields, and is accessed by little wooden boats. Boats, with a boatman, are for hire at USD3.50/trip, 2 passengers to a boat, which takes about one hour. Obviously, the front seat is the better seat. This is an excellent alternative to Halong Bay for those who have short attention spans, as the boat trip takes a mere hour versus Halong Bay tourist boats which take 5 hours. One minor annoyance involves pedlars on boats hawking their wares, and your boat rower trying to sell you embroidery. This is especially trying at the halfway point when the boats are about to turn around for the return trip. A large number of hawkers on boats will be waiting at that point and will attempt to pressure the passengers to buy souvenirs or snacks, while your boatman makes no attempt to move away. Either buy a small item/snack/drink, or politely but firmly turn them down. They'll generally give up after a few uncomfortable minutes. After boat trip,there is bicycle trip around the village, but some tour agency tactic do not write in the receipt so the customer have to pay addition for rental bicycle 60,000 dong. Trip can be booked in Hanoi for about USD18-20.

* : You can go to for 42$ but this trip is know as a "nightmare bus". Alternatively you can go to then take a local bus to , switch to river boat to and from where minivans go to - that in total will give you the same price but much pleasant trip and opportunity to see and sleep in beautiful Laotian small towns and villages.

Beware: almost hotel, hostel or guest house in Hanoi sell tours and there are many tour agent counters around the city, especially Shinh Cafe. But the rate of the same tour, same agent is very different. So before decide to buy the tour, the tourist have to check several counters compare the price, don't forget to ask what include,what exclude (VAT-Value Add Tax, assurance, bus, guide, meal, entrance fee, boat, bicycle, etc.) avoid to buy too expensive tour or pay more after.
