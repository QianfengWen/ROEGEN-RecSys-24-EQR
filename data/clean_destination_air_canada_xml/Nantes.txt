*Next options only 1.70€ per person and direction. From Commerce take tram line 3 in the direction Neustrie
# from the terminus station "Neustrie", take the Aeroport Shuttle 98, which normally costs 1.70€ and which terminates at Nantes Atlantique airport. This will take around 35 minutes, depending on the daytime, most times less. From the the airport take the airport bus, buy your ticket from the driver, and tell him "Seulement a Neustrie".

Eat
Nantes has a rich gastronomic culture, certainly for its famous wine and seafood. Additionally, this region of France is famous as the birthplace of crêpes. For a more savory variant, try the galettes de sarrasin (buckwheat crêpes).

Budget
*Some cafés and crêperies offer affordable prix-fixe menus for lunch, but you probably won't meet many nantais in a creperie, crêpes are done at home, crêperies are for tourists. What about Les Docks near the machines de l'île or La cantine further on l'île de Nantes, or Comme Un PiqueNique Chic near place Bretagne for vegan and vegetarian food, or Les Copains d'abord rue de l'Arche sèche, for a bistrot with a nice retro feel?

Mid-range
*Cafe Moliere, located in the Place Graslin next to the Theatre Graslin, offers excellent lunch fare, including sandwiches, croques-monsieur (open-faced sandwiches with ham and melted cheese; a delicious variant is the croque-anana, which also features a pineapple slice), steak-frites (steak and French fries), and salads. Coffee and dessert are also available, and the restaurant becomes a bar at night. Get a table outside if Nantes is experiencing rare sunny weather. Café Molière is well situated but widely over priced for what is served, which is just reheated basic bistro fast food. You might want to try nearby Café Boucot, rue Lekain, or Chez Peyo, place de la monnaie. Nearer Bouffay - L'aménité, rue Fénelon, and L'instinct gourmand, rue Saint Leonard. Local seasonal produce, sourced at the farmers market, to taste something authentic.

Splurge
*La Cigale, situated in the Place Graslin, has been called "the most beautiful brasserie in France" for its turn-of-the-century decor. Seafood is a particular specialty (as in all of Nantes), and the chef can be seen preparing seafood in front of the restaurant, where there is outdoor seating during warmer months. Fixed price menus are available for 15 and €25. A cheaper way to experience this delightful place is to go in the afternoon for dessert and coffee. And that's why it's not splurging, although the decor is amazing, the food is good but not great, and a bit over priced. At the Michelin * L'Atlantide 1874, on butte Sainte Anne. Great food, amaizing view of the Loire and former shipyards, quaint neighbourhood. Awesome. There is also Lulu Rouget on l'île de Nantes, La Poissonnerie Et Pas Que on l'île Feydeau, Un nouveau monde also île Feydeau but nearer to Commerce, or Imagine, rue Gresset near place Graslin. All of them embody the renewal of french food, with local produce perfectly cooked with the a twist of foreign influence to make them interesting and modern again.

Drink
Nantes's nightlife is concentrated in the Bouffay area, although there are also many bars and nightclubs near the Place du Commerce and the Théâtre Graslin.

* Le Bar du Coin located next to the Église Saint-Croix, with an old-fashioned interior occasionally offering an in house DJ.
* Le Barlocks (19 Rue des Carmes) - a small bar with a nice local feel. Located North of the square to the west of the elaborate clock (Eglise St. Croix).

Also show's rugby and soccer matches throughout the weekend by way of a screen and projector they have located downstairs.
*Le Shaft(14 Rue Petites Ecuries, +33 02 40 47 78 56)is a small bar on a corner with a terrace and a friendly, crowded interior. If you're looking for a cheap drink, they offer 3€ pints and Giraffes for cheap. 
*Bier Garten (11 rue de la Juiverie) is located in Bouffay and is perfect for groups of people. Although it looks small, inside it offers 4 rather large back rooms which are more than accommodating for groups. Offers salsa, bands, and various themed nights throughout the week as well.

Try Breton (hard) cider, which comes in either a brut or doux (sweet) variety. A variation is a kir bréton, which is cider mixed with a fruit liqueur (usually black currant, blackberry, or peach). The Nantes area is also known for its Muscadet wine, inexpensive but surprisingly delicious, which goes well with seafood dishes.
