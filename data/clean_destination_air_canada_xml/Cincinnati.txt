Cincinnati is 's third largest city and the largest metro region. It lies on the north bank of the Ohio River in in the . Known as the "Queen City" or "Queen of the West," Cincinnati was the only 19th century American city that left a favorable impression on the then 30-year-old English author Charles Dickens. “Cincinnati is a beautiful city; cheerful, thriving, and animated,” Dickens wrote in “American Notes.” “I have not often seen a place that commends itself so favorably and pleasantly to a stranger at the first glance as this does: with its clean houses of red and white, its well-paved roads, and foot-ways of bright tile. Nor does it become less prepossessing on a closer acquaintance.” 

Cincinnati is distinct amongst Midwestern cities. Its culture is a mixture of the Northeast, Old South, Midwest, and Appalachia blended with a strong German-Catholic heritage. It was one of the United States' early boomtowns, and the Over-the-Rhine neighborhood is the largest National Historic District in the country. Today, it's part of a fast-growing metro area, and home to a remarkable blend of industry and architecture. Downtown Cincinnati is surrounded by picturesque foothills that add a beautiful backdrop to the Queen City and its legendary skyline &ndash; celebrated in the opening credits of television show WKRP in Cincinnati.

Understand

Formerly known as Losantiville, the city was renamed Cincinnati by the first governor of the Northwest Territory, Arthur St. Clair, in honor of George Washington at the end of the Revolutionary War. Roman consul Cincinnatus gave up the Emperorship of Rome to become a farmer after having been an immensely successful general, much like the way George Washington gave up the presidency after 2 terms.

The city's early economy was based on the pork industry, and this was celebrated in the summer of 2000 with the Big Pig Gig, during which large flying pig statues took up residence along the city's main thoroughfares. Many of these pig statues later found homes downtown in offices, parks and even private residences. The Miami and Erie canal was completed in the 1840s, and was used to transport hogs and butchered pork products to Cincinnati from much of western Ohio.

During this time period massive waves of Germans settled into the city populating neighborhoods which at their height in the late 1800s were some of the most densely populated outside of New York City. These German immigrants built a culture based off of beer gardens, beer brewing, dance and music halls giving Cincinnati a very distinct and vibrant local culture. Unfortunately very little remains from this era due to the double whammy of World War I anti-German backlash and prohibition combined with massive depopulation of the city's core in the mid 20th Century. Lately, with the beginnings of revitalization of the Downtown Basin neighborhoods, there has been a renewed interest in this heritage and some of it can be seen to this day in faded German signs on densely built ornate Victorian buildings in Over-The-Rhine, a high per-capita number of bars, and the celebration of large German festivals such Bockfest, Mayfest, and Oktoberfest.

Cincinnati also has a charming riverboat heritage that dates back to the days when large, steam and paddle-wheel driven vessels were used to transport locally produced pork products. In recognition of this tradition, the city plays host to the Tall Stacks Festival every four years, during which time the river front is transformed into a mass of color, with river boats of all shapes and sizes jostling for positions along the river banks. Baseball is another Cincinnati tradition, and the Cincinnati Reds were the first professional baseball team in the United States; in deference to that, Opening Day is always a home game for the Reds, held at Great American Ball Park.

Cincinnati has a thriving local industrial economy and is home to many businesses ranging from manufacturing to services, including General Electric, Procter and Gamble, Fifth Third Bank, Milacron, Kroger, Federated Department Stores/Macy's, and the American Financial Group. In World Wars I and II, Cincinnati's local machine tool companies, such as LeBlond (now Makino) and the Cincinnati Screw and Tap Company (now Milacron), played an important role, providing what is commonly considered the best machine tool technology in the world for its time.

Recently, Cincinnati has seen some large scale revitalization projects, such as the construction of Great American Ball Park and Paul Brown Stadium, the reconstruction of Fountain Square, the construction of the first phase of the Banks neighborhood (which will eventually include, a hotel, shopping, houses and entertainment) and the beginnings of restoration of Over-The-Rhine through the "Gateway Quarter". This has given the central areas of Cincinnati a vitality that hadn't been around for decades, though it is still very much a work in progress with other projects like a Streetcar line connecting Downtown to the University on the horizon.

This progress did not come easy. For instance, county officials, city government, and area residents were flabbergasted that large scale projects like "The Banks" were undeveloped for over 10 years while the smaller cities of and , across the Ohio River, continued to develop their riverfronts and draw visitors away from Cincinnati. However the tide seems to be flowing back in Cincinnati's favor, time will tell as these developments mature.

Orientation

The city center is "Downtown" Cincinnati, sometimes referred to as the "Central Business District." With many major attractions and corporate headquarters located here, the focus of the region revolves around this district. Downtown's north-south streets can be easily remembered by the mnemonic:

Big Strong Men Will Very Rarely Eat Pork Chops 

Going East to West this stands for:
 
Broadway Sycamore Main Walnut Vine Race Elm Plum Central.

The Cincinnati skyline is breathtaking -- especially at night -- when viewed from Devou Park in northern Kentucky, Mount Echo in Price Hill, or Eden Park and neighboring Mt. Adams.

There is a rivalry between the "East Side" and "West Side" of Cincinnati. Historically people from the West Side were blue collar workers, while those from the East Side were white collar workers.

Notable neighborhoods 

*Avondale is a primarily residential urban neighborhood near the center of the city, notable for the presence of the Cincinnati Zoo.
*Hyde Park is an upscale, largely white and upper class residential neighborhood. At the heart of the neighborhood is Hyde Park Square, a tree-lined esplanade of boutique shops, such as Morrison & Me, Knickers XY, 45/46 XY Inspired, and Knickers of Hyde Park, and restaurants, including Indigo, Teller's, Cock & Bull Pub and Graeter's Ice Cream.
*Mt. Adams is a trendy, upscale neighborhood located directly northeast of downtown Cincinnati. It is known for its lively night scene, beautiful views of the skyline, and the Holy Cross-Immaculata Catholic Church. Steep terrain on three sides, and Eden Park on the fourth side, give the neighborhood a unique sense of isolation. Mt. Adams has some of the highest property values in the city, and is a good destination for anyone overly worried about personal safety.
*Clifton, not to be confused with a nearby Clifton Heights, is also located near the city center, and is home to an especially wide range of people, boasting a population diverse in ethnicity, race, sexuality, gender, age, country of origin, and economic status. A number of students at the local University inhabit the stately apartment buildings, as well as many of the beautiful older homes that line the gas-lit streets, though a number of families and other residents are also proud to call Clifton home. Especially notable is the stretch of Ludlow between Clifton Ave and Whitfield, as it is home to a number of restaurants specializing both in American fare (perhaps the best Skyline Chili in all of Cincinnati, as well as local diner the Proud Rooster) and ethnic delights (Ambar and Amol India, Thai Cafe, Mediterranean Foods), as well as a number of independent shops and boutiques, and the quirky art-house movie theater, The Esquire Theatre, which is over 100 years old and generally shows indie and foreign films.
*Mt. Washington is an up and coming economically diverse neighborhood located on Cincinnati's east side. The neighborhood contains a variety of shopping options along its Water Tower business district, ranging from thrift shops to upscale women's boutiques (Magnolia Clothing Boutique originated in Mt. Washington). The neighborhood is known for its variety of homes, ranging from large estates (along Salem Avenue and Wayside Avenue) to affordable apartments. Architecturally the neighborhood is home to several notable buildings, including the Mt. St. Mary's Seminary, Mt. Washington Presbyterian Church, and Guardian Angel Church. 
*Northside is an economically and racially diverse neighborhood notable for a strong sense of community investment and pride. The neighborhood is home to many unique shops including Shake It Records (an independently owned record store), Fabricate (a shop that specializes in locally made artistic goods, Tantrum (a family-oriented boutique), and two vintage clothing stores, NVision and Casablanca Vintage. Restaurants include culinary delights Take the Cake, Django Western Tacos, Tacocracy, and Melt, among others. The nightlife in Northside is lively with a variety of clubs including Mayday, Serpent, The Comet, and the Northside Tavern. The neighborhood is also home to a sizable LGBT population and hosts many of of the city's gay pride events. This neighborhood is full of hipsters.
*Oakley is an up and coming neighborhood that borders Hyde Park. Oakley has a lively downtown area with many unique restaurants and shops including Dewey's Pizza, Habits Cafe, Denim, and Bova Furniture. Also notable is Aglamesis Ice Cream, a long-time competitor of Graeter's in the gourmet ice cream category.
*Over-the-Rhine (OTR) is the city's historic district. It is the location of Music Hall, home of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra and Cincinnati Opera; Findlay Market, Ohio's oldest public market in continuous operation; the Main Street Entertainment District; and much of Cincinnati's creative arts. Care should be taken when visiting this neighborhood as crime is more frequent here than in other areas of the city. The safer areas of OTR are just north of Central Parkway on Vine and Main Streets in the Gateway Quarter. North of Liberty Street the area is a bit rougher around the edges. For the past thirty years the neighborhood has been a battleground between advocates for low income housing and historic preservationists/real estate developers. In the past five years a great renaissance has taken place in this area though, with the redevelopment of Washington Park, and the many great restaurants' in the Gateway Quarter, it has become one of the trendiest neighborhoods in the city. It is also noteable for being the largest home of Italianette architecture in the country, no visit to Cincinnati would be complete without a visit to OTR. But beware that there is a high noticeable amount of crime. 
*Price Hill is one of Cincinnati’s oldest neighborhoods, first settled in 1789 and named Price Hill in the 1870s after General Rees Price. An incline opened by Price and his sons brought many wealthy residents to the top of the hill, and the grand mansions they built still stand today. The community’s history is preserved at the Price Hill Historical Society on Warsaw Avenue, and the neighborhood was home to the first Skyline Chili parlor (which relocated in the early 2000s), the upscale Primavista Restaurant, the 120-year-old Crow’s Nest Tavern and the Gothic-style St. Lawrence Church. While it does boast this vivid history and some notable establishments, Price Hill has some seedier areas that you should be cautious of if you are traveling there. St. Lawrence Church, for instance, is only open during Mass and shortly thereafter, and that is when it should be viewed. Its immediate neighborhood is considered dangerous. Primavista and the Crow's Nest are on the border, closer to other parts of town. In general, driving aimlessly through the area is not recommended.
*West End the little bit that survived of this once large densely populated neighborhood would not be notable for travelers except for the Dayton Street Historic District. At its peak in the mid to late 1800s this was a millionaires row that rivaled Prairie Avenue in Chicago, or 5th Avenue in New York City in terms of wealth. Today it’s more than a bit rundown, but less so than the neighborhood that surrounds it. It’s worth a look for the adventurous traveler.
*Riverfront/The Banks This is a newly developed area in downtown Cincinnati that falls between Great American Ballpark home of the Reds, and Paul Brown Stadium home of the Bengals. The Banks is a one-of-a-kind, 18-acre mixed-use development located along Cincinnati’s most notable asset – the Ohio Riverfront. Emanating from the foot of the historic Roebling Suspension Bridge, The Banks is currently home to 18 acres of exciting restaurants, entertainment venues and residences. Additional venues coming soon to The Banks include hotels, office structures and additional retail and residential options. Also new and adjacent to the Banks is the 50 acre Smale Riverfront Park a breathtaking cutting edge park that runs along the Ohio River, and contains the Moerlein Lager House, as well as the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center.
*Newport and Covington Though these neighborhoods are actually across the river in Kentucky, a lot of Cincinnatians would not bat an eye if you still referred to these spots as being "in Cincinnati", sometimes going as far as calling the area "Cincitucky". Many Cincinnati residents spend weekends at Newport on the Levee, a large outdoor mall shopping center which houses a nice AMC movie theatre, and is home to the Newport Aquarium. There are also many festivals that take place in Newport in the summer, down by the edge of the Ohio River. Very close-by is the Covington, KY which boasts a lively night-life scene in the Mainstrasse district home to are many bars, restaurants, and boutique shops, as well as two renowned tattoo parlours, Mother's and Designs by Dana.

Climate

Cincinnati has four distinct seasons. Winters range from harsh to mild, while summer and early fall is hot and humid.

The average temperature in the winter drops to the low 30's (F) and during the summer reaches the upper 70's (F) to mid-90's (F).

Normally, there are very few snowy days that impair driving on the city's hilliest roads. Snow in Northern Kentucky is of exceptional concern, though, because of the increased number of hills and rural roads, which are not as quickly treated as roads in Southwest Ohio. If you plan to drive or travel through Northern Kentucky during a snowy period, be extremely careful and phone ahead to make sure your destination is still accessible.

Newspapers and magazines

*Cincinnati Enquirer Morning daily newspaper, including a Sunday edition. Features Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial cartoonist Jim Borgman Located downtown.
* City Beat The city's oldest free weekly arts and entertainment publication, geared toward college students and young adults. Has a good list of upcoming events, bars, restaurants and museums.

Blogs & News Websites
* Soapbox Cincinnati The city's newest weekly publication, focuses on the economic and physical transformation of the Cincinnati region by highlighting interesting development and innovation news, profiles on growth businesses, and providing guides of neighborhoods that have a concentration of locally-owned restaurants, shops, and unique housing opportunities.
* Urban Cincy Blog focusing on issues of urbanism in the Cincinnati area. Also discusses local development projects and news events towards promoting city living. A good source for information regarding local events too.

Get in

By plane

* Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. (Follow I-275 south then east to Exit 4 (State Route 212.) Follow the signs to airport terminals and parking.) Phone: +1-(859) 767-3151 (mailto:info@cvgairport.com info@cvgairport.com), Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport (; ) is on the Kentucky side of the Ohio River, so you'll have to cross the bridge to get to Cincinnati itself. Delta has its sixth largest hub at CVG, so Delta offers many daily flights to major US cites in addition to direct service to Paris. Also, the airport is a focus city for low cost carriers Allegiant Air and Frontier Airlines, who provide daily service through out the US for very low prices. Currently, Air Canada, American Airlines, Apple Vacations, Bahamas Air, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, OneJet, Ultimate Air Shuttle, United Airlines and Vacation Express provide service to the airport. In recent years the airport was known for high fares, but recent competition between airlines has drove prices down.
TANK express bus Route 2X costs $2.00 between CVG airport and downtown Covington and Cincinnati.
* Lunken Airport Lunken Airport is the other option for travelers, with Ultimate Air Shuttle providing daily flights to New York, Cleveland, Charlotte, and Chicago. In general, only travelers flying their own private planes or who chartered a flight will use the airport.

By car

Cincinnati is served by Interstates 71 (from Columbus and Louisville), 74 (from Indianapolis), 75 (from Dayton and Lexington), 471 (a spur of I-71 to the south), and 275 (the circle beltway). US 50 also serves the area as an expressway to the eastern neighborhoods (Columbia Parkway) and western neighborhoods via the Sixth Street Expressway, which links River Road and the Waldvogel Memorial Viaduct to Downtown.

One of the most beautiful panoramic views in the country occurs when driving northbound on Interstate 71/75 (the interstate routes share the same highway in part of Northern Kentucky) traveling into downtown Cincinnati. The panoramic view comes up once you get to what's known as the "Cut-in-the-Hill", which is reached once you pass signs warning you of a steep grade. Traffic on the Brent Spence Bridge sometimes backs up, though, especially during rush hour. Try to plan your trips so you don't get too much of this truly spectacular view!

By train

* All incoming and outgoing passenger trains stop at Union Terminal/Cincinnati Museum Center during the night. Train goes east to Washington DC and New York, west to Chicago, stopping at Union Terminal/Cincinnati Museum Center late in the night (3:30 to Chicago, 1:30 to New York). 3 trains a week each way. For most the train is neither the fastest, cheapest or most convenient way to travel from Cincinnati, but it can be very scenic, especially going east through West Virginia and Virginia. There is no public transportation available at time of train arrival/departure. (See .) 

By bus

* Greyhound offers passenger bus service from many U.S. cities. Buses arrive and depart from Greyhound's station in downtown Cincinnati. 
* Megabus is a budget bus company offering service to Cincinnati from Chicago with a stop in Indianapolis. Trips start at 691 Gest Street and make a stop at the UC campus before continuing to Indianapolis. Fares start at $1 plus a booking fee. Typical fare is $25 to Chicago.
* Ohio Coach is a Chinatown bus that serves New York City (from Chinatown naturally) from a strip mall in the northern suburb of Sharonville.
As of Nov 2017 3 departures each evening, arrives next morning. $70 usually, higher during peak periods. Keep in mind when you arrive in Cincinnati you're about 20 miles from downtown Cincinnati and there is very limited bus service from this location. 
Get around

By bus
The main form of public transportation is by bus. The region is served by two different bus systems. The Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority (Sorta) operates Metro, the bus company that serves the Ohio side of the state line. The Transit Authority of Northern Kentucky (Tank) serves Northern Kentucky and all routes between Northern Kentucky and Cincinnati. Bus lines marked with a "X" are express routes and make less frequent stops. Be sure to check whether the bus makes a stop at your required destination before you get on. Sorta and Tank operate a different fare rate system, though both require passengers to submit the exact fare and no change is given.

For sightseeing the recommended option is the Metro 1 bus. Metro's tag line for this bus is "Ride the One for Fun," because it visits the most important cultural destinations in the city. The bus loops from the Union Terminal Museum Center, to downtown's theaters and museums, to the sports stadiums and parks on the riverfront, to the upscale Mount Adams residential neighborhood, to Eden Park and Krohn Conservatory, then through some uptown neighborhoods before reaching the University of Cincinnati, and finally the Cincinnati Zoo. This bus is $1.75 a ride, but passes are available.

If you wish to cross the river into Kentucky be sure to ride the Southbank Shuttle, which loops around the riverfront on the Ohio and Kentucky sides. Stops include Fountain Square, The Banks, Newport on the Levee, and Roebling Point. The Shuttle is often used by locals who do not want to drink and drive or pay high parking prices, as the shuttle stops at many popular nightlife spots. The Shuttle is instantly recognizable by its old-fashioned trolley look, but are newer and cleaner than the regular TANK bus system. The shuttle is also cheaper at $1 a ride. Daily passes are available.

Metro charges passengers based on zones: Zone 1 (The City of Cincinnati), Zone 2 (Hamilton County, outside of Cincinnati), and Zone 3 (Stops outside of Hamilton County and the City of Cincinnati). Prices for each zone are respectively: $1.75, $2.65, and $3. Metro has several routes, most notably routes 71X and 72 (Both $4.25), which charge a slightly higher fare than normal. Transferring between one bus route to another on the Metro system requires another 50 cents for a transfer ticket and passengers transferring from a Zone 2 or 3 bus to another Zone 2 or 3 bus should ensure that the bus driver hole punches the appropriate zone on the transfer ticket. Otherwise a further payment equivalent to the difference between the zone you're traveling to, if your trip ends in zone 2 or 3, and zone 1 fare must be paid.

TANK (Transit Authority of Northern Kentucky) buses charge a flat rate of $1.50 for all adults, 75&cent; for seniors, $1; for students. Transfers between Tank buses are free. However, transferring between Tank buses and a Metro buses costs an additional 50&cent; or 40&cent;, if you're transferring to a TANK bus from a Metro bus.

Government Square

The newly-renovated Government Square is the main bus hub for Metro and is on Walnut Street. Occasionally, when large events are going on downtown, bus routes will be re-routed to avoid Government Square. The square received its name due to the government buildings that border the square, such as the Federal Office Building, a Federal Courthouse, and a Federal Reserve Bank branch. Within the complex is an information kiosk providing details of bus routes and a free Wi-Fi service.

Lines

Below is a short list of the most important SORTA (Metro) lines that serve tourist sites. Line 1 is listed twice because the downtown stop changes depending on the direction of the bus. 

*Route 1 Stops from Union Terminal/Museum Center to Cincinnati Zoo via Downtown: Museum Center, Ezzard Charles & Linn Street, 5th Street & Main Street, Ida Street & Celestial Street, Lincoln Avenue & Gilbert Avenue, Cincinnati Zoo on Erkenbrecker.
*Route 1 Stops from Cincinnati Zoo to Union Terminal/Museum Center via Downtown: Cincinnati Zoo on Erkenbrecker, Lincoln Avenue & Gilbert Avenue, Ida Street & Celestial Street, 4th Street & Walnut Street, Ezzard Charles & Linn Street, Museum Center.
*Route 72 Stops from Downtown to Kings Island: Walnut Street & Court Street (Downtown), Government Square, Area B, Kenwood Road & Montgomery Road, Mason-Montgomery & Fields Ertel Road ("Park and Ride"), Mason-Montgomery & Western Row Road, Kings Island.
*Route 71X Stops from Downtown to Kings Island: Walnut Street & Court Street (Downtown), Government Square, Area B, Kings Island, Mason-Montgomery & Fields Ertel Road ("Park and Ride").

By Streetcar

The Cincinnati Bell Connector (or the Streetcar) connects downtown and the Over The Rhine neighborhood. This is a short route, so this isn't going to be a major part of how you get around during your trip, but it can be useful for a day between OTR and downtown, or for bar hopping in the evening. For major events it can be pretty crowded. Keep in mind at a typical walking speed it only takes 1 hour to get between the ends of the route, so in many cases you may be better off walking, especially if there is a lengthy wait. Fare is $1. Pay at station before boarding. Keep ticket with you while riding or risk a fine. 

By taxi
Like in most other US cities, Uber and Lyft have quickly supplanted traditional taxis as the primary hired car service. Both have identical rates in Cincinnati, but rates can increase substantially during periods of peak demand (and will differ during these periods, so it can pay to check both). Normal fare within town $7-15, from downtown to the airport $20.

By foot

Some of the older neighborhoods in Cincinnati are quite walkable, with the Clifton Gaslight District (Ludlow), Over-The-Rhine, Mt. Adams, and Downtown being amongst the easiest to travel by foot. Due to massive depopulation of what were formerly neighborhoods with densities approaching that of New York City, (like Over-The-Rhine and the West End), Cincinnati is way more car oriented these days with most destinations being too spread out to walk to. However, many of these districts were built to pedestrian scale and are worth a stroll so long as one exercises caution (see the stay safe section). A visitor from a larger East Coast city may expect neighborhoods of similar scale and architectural composition to be filled with people, but instead oftentimes they are full of abandonment and the problems that come along with it. However, places like Mt. Adams, Downtown, or Clifton around the Gaslight District don't have these problems are well worth exploring by foot, park your car outside of the neighborhood and walk right in.

Skywalk
Cincinnati's Downtown has a Skywalk path. The Skywalk is an indoor, above-ground path through the streets of Cincinnati's Downtown. The Skywalk is free, and only used by pedestrians. Urban analysts hired by the city and downtown business leaders want to tear down chunks of the elevated passageways. Although most of the paths have been torn down, some of the Skywalk still exists, allowing travelers to continue to beat the weather.
 
Most of the Skywalk has been dismantled.

Hillside Steps
Cincinnati has over 400 hillside steps for the adventurous traveler to explore. These steps were built before people had cars to facilitate easy transportation by foot up and down the steep hillsides that populate the city. Some steps are very famous such as the Mt. Adams Steps up to the Holy Cross Immaculata Church (described under the To See section) while others underused and/or are falling apart. Still more, like St. Gregory's steps in Mt. Adams, are hidden gems, guiding a traveler through a hidden forest oasis in a densely populated neighborhood. Be cautious when traveling on these steps, as they sometimes go through remote areas and while the neighborhood on one end of the steps could be safe, the neighborhood at the other could be crime infested. The city has a somewhat difficult to decipher but extensive guide of the locations and conditions of the steps here 

An even better guide to the city's steps is here 

By bicycle

Cincinnati has a long way to go before it reaches the level of Portland or Chicago in terms of bicycle culture and accessibility. However, the city has lately been installing bicycle lanes and even on street bicycle parking in some key neighborhoods like Over-the-Rhine and Northside. Biking in Cincinnati is challenging, and is recommended for experienced urban riders, as the terrain is quite hilly producing often curvy roads that can go up or down very steep grades.

Despite the challenge, the narrow roads and urban setting are well suited for using a bicycle. Residential neighborhoods along the river near downtown (Roebling Point, The Banks, Over-the-Rhine, Newport Historic East Row) are relatively flat and quiet. The city posts a color coded map/guide to recommended bicycle routes and facilities as well as information regarding its bicycle policies and projects here All buses have bike mounts on the front if you get tired or don't want to pedal up a hill.

You can rent bikes from the newly opened Cincinnnati Bike Center at Smale Riverfront Park, from Cincinnati Bike Rentals in Clifton Heights by the University, (charges daily/weekly, supply your own lock) or from Wheel of Fun Rentals by Sawyer Point on the Riverfront downtown (charges hourly, including tandem bikes).

By car

For getting quickly and conveniently to most places in Cincinnati, you will need a car. Be aware that there is a street grid only in Downtown and its surrounding neighborhoods. Outside of those parts of the city navigation can be tough, with street names changing constantly, and unintuitive routes being the norm. Particularly tough, is getting up to Mt. Adams, where if you don't go down the right series of one way streets you could end up getting flung out to one of its surrounding neighborhoods or Eden Park. There are a few signs directing drivers to the neighborhood, but they are easily missed. A good roadmap or GPS system is highly recommended if you plan on driving around.

Many roads are very narrow and very hilly reflecting the age of most of Cincinnati, which was built well before the automobile was the mainstay of transportation. Some streets will feel like country roads with the occasional urban house/apartment built where the terrain can support it. Other roads such as the aptly named Straight Street quite literally go straight down a hill at a very steep grade. Be careful when driving in inclement weather and remember that when parking on a steep slope, point your tires towards (if downhill) or away (if uphill) from the curb and use your emergency brake.

I-75 is to be avoided around rush hours at all costs. While traffic isn't as heavy as one would encounter in much larger cities its still quite formidable. The large amount of truck traffic combined short ramps and many blind corners create a traffic nightmare. If you can, take the much less traveled (though still somewhat congested) I-71 which is most easily accessed by taking the Norwood Lateral (OH 562) across to it at Norwood. I-75 N from Kentucky has many hills along its route and moves at a crawl at nearly all times of day due to the dramatic grade changes.

Parking is generally cheap and plentiful in Cincinnati. The few trouble spots are around the University in the Clifton/CUF/Corryville areas (Uptown), Downtown, and Mt. Adams. When parking in Mt. Adams, be aware of parking restrictions by reading the signs, there are far more of them than you'd encounter anywhere else in the city, due to the narrow streets and dense population of that neighborhood.

* The Carew Tower served as the basis for the design of the later Empire State Building. During the mid- to late-1980s, a giant inflatable gorilla was attached to the upper floors! The 49th floor of Cincinnati's 2nd tallest building provides a breathtaking and inexpensive view of the city. Take a high-speed elevator to the 45th floor, then choose from walking up four flights of stairs or taking another elevator to the 48th floor and walking up one flight. The admission is collected once you reach the top.

* The newly renovated Fountain Square holds the Tyler Davidson Fountain, newly added and renovated restaurants, an ice skating rink, a big screen video board, free Wi-Fi, and a hands-on water wall! 
* The John A. Roebling Suspension Bridge was the longest suspension bridge in the world at 1,057 feet (322 m) when the first pedestrians crossed on December 1, 1866 &mdash; a status it maintained until 1883. It served as the prototype for Roebling's design of the Brooklyn Bridge in New York. This bridge was featured in the movie Rain Man. 
* This sprawling cemetery dates back over 160 years, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2007. The unique layout, designed by Adolph Strauch, makes it feel less like a cemetery and more like a park that just happens to have people buried in it. The arboretum features many National Champion trees. To find the graves of the many famous people buried here, stop by the office on your way in for a free map. 

Religious buildings

* Roman Catholic treasure. Known as the "Church on the Hill". On Good Friday, many Cincinnatians "Climb the steps of Mt. Adams", praying on each step. 
* Built in 1865-1866 for B'nai Yeshurun, this is one of the best-preserved Moorish Revival buildings of the 19th century. 
* Saint Peter in Chains Cathedral is a beautiful and ornate cathedral, a recommended sight for anyone traveling through Cincinnati. St. Peter in Chains Cathedral was the city's tallest structure when completed, as well as one of its most elegant buildings. Copying elements from classical Athenian buildings, architect Henry Walter produced one of the finest neoclassical Greek revival buildings in the United States.

Museums & galleries

* The American Classical Music Hall of Fame includes a timeline through classical music (focusing on American classical music) and interactive displays of inductees. 
* Art Beyond Boundaries is a visual art gallery showcasing the work of local artists with disabilities. They also have showings at Pendelton Art Center's Final Friday. 
* The Cincinnati Art Museum is in the beautiful Eden Park, which perfectly reflects the artwork the museum houses. According to the Zagat Survey, The Cincinnati Art Museum ranks with The Art Institute of Chicago and The Museum of Modern Art in New York as the best art museums in the nation. The museum features special exhibitions and a terrific collection of art by Cincinnati artists including the worlds largest collection of Rookwood Pottery. The Damascus Room is a particular interesting artwork and should be seen by all of the museum's visitors.
* CHHE has a heart-wrenching and inspiring exhibit called Mapping Our Tears, which follows the stories of Cincinnatians involved in the resistance to Nazis and Holocaust survivors now living in Cincinnati. One part of the exhibit tells the tale of a local man, who after interrogating suspects to be tried at the Nuremberg Trials became U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg.

* The museum for all of us, who wanted to be a firefighter, but never became one. The museum documents the history of firefighting and it's fitting that the museum is in Cincinnati, which was the first place in America to have a fully paid professional fire department. 
* Originally built in 1933 as the Union Terminal train station, the building was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1977. The Cincinnati Museum Center is comprised of The Cincinnati History Museum, Museum of Natural History and Science, Duke Energy Children's Museum, and the Robert D. Linder Family OMNIMAX Theater. 
* The Cincinnati Zoo is the second oldest zoo in America and one of the most important worldwide because of its success with the mating of animals in captivity. The zoo is well worth a visit. 
* The CAC is one of the regional leaders in thought-provoking art; the building itself is a piece of art with some of Cincinnati's boldest architecture. The center has also been the center of controversy; some may not see the "art" in some exhibits. 
* Harriet Beecher-Stowe is famous for writing the anti-slavery Uncle Tom's Cabin. Free (donations are welcomed).

Parks

With more than 100 parks and green spaces covering an area of over 5,000 acres, Cincinnati has the most extensive and highest regarded park system in the nation. In addition to offering respite from the urban landscape, the parks also offer scenic views, hiking areas, floral landscapes and picnic facilities. 
* Sawyer Point is one of Cincinnati's party parks, where in the summer radio stations throw free outdoor concerts. The park is also used to host the Tall Stacks festival. A popular place to laze about is the Serpentine Wall steps that lead into the Ohio River. 
* Mt. Echo is famous for its stellar view of downtown Cincinnati. The band Over-the-Rhine's "Ohio" album cover was shot from this park.

Fortunately along with the neighborhood, this park has undergone a major renovation, including interactive fountains designed to go with music selectable by phone app, a large event lawn, playgrounds, and a look that combines a respect for the park's history with modern amenities. Its particularly striking to see at night when the fountains are lit up in different colors, and safety shouldn't be an issue then as their are plenty of security cameras installed to quell any potential issues with the neighborhood. 3CDC who remodeled Fountain Square led this renovation and as a result is programming it with plenty of events throughout the year, see website for details.

The park acts as a setting and catalyst for civic activities and entertainment venues and is supported by partnerships with private and public funds. Typical park events range from small picnic-like activities to larger pre- and post-game activities for the Bengals and Reds, concerts, and Tall Stakes—a music, arts, and heritage festival which brings 350,000 visitors to the downtown. The park includes several interactive water features, a performance stage, a sculpture play area, a pavilion, bench swings, water gardens, and Cinergy Trace, a 1000-foot-long riverfront promenade. Public landings and seasonal docking and wharves service the public and commercial cruise boat traffic. Park amenities are enhanced by a series of sustainable strategies, including an integrated bicycle center, support, and locker room facility and a new restaurant pavilion supported by a geothermal heating and cooling system.In the surrounding waterfront district, a six-block, mixed-use development is planned that will bring roughly 400 residential units and office and commercial activities to the area.

Sports

One of the most intense college rivalries is the , the annual matchup between the University of Cincinnati and Xavier University; the 2011 edition ended in a bench-clearing brawl. This incident led to an official renaming of the rivalry as a "Classic" instead of a "Shootout", and more significantly caused the game to be relocated downtown to the neutral U.S. Bank Arena for four years (it had alternated between the schools' home arenas for more than 20 years) before relocating back to Campus Venues in 2015.

* NFL team. 

* The "Big Red Machine" has always been a leader in professional baseball since its formation as the first professional baseball team.

Chili

Cincinnati is famous for its own unique kind of chili, based on a recipe.

It's also served over hot dogs with shredded Cheddar cheese on top, known as a "cheese coney." Cincinnati has more chili restaurants per capita than any city in the United States.

Drink

The Main Street Entertainment District (located on Main Street north of 12th Street in Over-the-Rhine) was a popular area featuring many clubs and bars. However the riots did their number on the district forcing just about every bar to close down during the 2000s. This isn't all doom and gloom as, there have been attempts to bring bars back up there with several notable night spots opening up in the last few years such as Neon's and Japp's. After a few years of Kentucky getting the attention, the center of nightlife in Cincinnati has shifted to the area near Fountain Square and the Arnoff Center, or Restaurant Row generally bounded by 8th St to the North, 5th St to the South, Vine St to the West and Main St to the East.

Stay safe
Cincinnati is a safe city to visit, however care should be taken when visiting certain neighborhoods. Some perceive downtown as unsafe, but according to a 2011 article by the Cincinnati Enquirer, Downtown is "as safe as the suburbs. ... The most common crime downtown is theft, which includes shoplifting but not muggings, and the most likely crime you'll suffer is having your car broken into." Therefore, it's safer to park your car in a monitored lot than on the street. As always, be sure to take proactive steps to ensure your safety regardless of where you are by using common sense. There are a fair number of Panhandlers, most aren't harmful, use common sense and firmly say no if approached.

The safest neighborhood near downtown is Mount Adams, which statistically experiences almost no serious crime. Some neighborhoods you should avoid, particularly at night, include Avondale, Walnut Hills, The West End, and parts of Over-the-Rhine. 

Over-the-Rhine is becoming a popular destination for locals and tourists alike, but it is still in a transition phase. As of 2011, the safest part of Over-the-Rhine is on Vine Street from Central Parkway to 14th Streets and Main Street up to Liberty. This area is well lit at night, and has constant police presence. Use caution wandering off by yourself in Over-the-Rhine at night as the neighborhood is inconsistent in its makeup. A good rule of thumb for OTR is to stay on the major streets (Vine and Main) and stay south of Liberty. Travel in a group if possible, or call a cab.
