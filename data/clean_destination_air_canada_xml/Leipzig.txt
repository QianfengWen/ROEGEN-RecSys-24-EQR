Leipzig is the largest city in the federal state of , with a population of approximately 560.000. It is the industrial center of the region and a major cultural center, offering interesting sights, shopping possibilities and lively nightlife.

Understand
 
First documented in 1015, and endowed with city and market privileges in 1165, the city of Leipzig has fundamentally shaped the history of Saxony and of Germany. It was founded at the crossing of two ancient trade routes, Via Regia and Via Imperii. Leipzig has always been known as a place of commerce and still has large trade fairgrounds and exhibition halls known as the Leipzig Messe and located north of the city. Before it became common to dedicate a specific area to trade fairs, they took place in the city itself. Which is why many of the historical buildings were constructed by merchants, as well as Leipzig's unique system of arcades and courtyards. 

Other forms of exchange soon followed the trade of goods. The University of Leipzig (latin: Alma mater lipsiensis) was founded in 1409, which makes it the second-oldest university in Germany. University facilities are scattered throughout the city, and you cannot miss the central campus at Augustusplatz with the new main building.

Leipzig acquired the nickname Klein Paris ("Little Paris") in the 18th century, when it became a center of a classical literary movement largely led by the German scholar and writer Johann Christoph Gottsched.

The city is also the home of the Nikolaikirche (Church of St. Nicholas) – the starting point of peaceful demonstrations against the communist regime which led to German Reunification. The collapse of communism hit Leipzig's economy very heavily (as did communism itself), but after being on the mend for over twenty years, it has emerged as one of the success stories of the "New German States".

Traces of Leipzig's history are everywhere: the ring of streets around the city center marking the former course of the city wall, the city trade houses, abandoned and repurposed industrial buildings in Plagwitz, small town structures in the outskirts where surrounding towns were incorporated during phases of rapid growth, the battlefields of the Napoleonic wars in the south and southeast of the city, and much, much more.

Get around

By Bike

The best way to get around in Leipzig is by bike. Leipzig has a wide network of rivers and channels and almost all of them have a bike track on at least one bank. Since these bike paths often run beneath the street level, they form a bike highway system in Leipzig. The bike paths on street level are also abundant, but slower, because of the many street crossings. Leipzig has a bike sharing system from nextbike an international public bike sharing company that was actually founded in Leipzig. Here is a web site dedicated to biking in Leipzig German only).

Public Transport

The primary means of public transport is the tram. LVB operates trams and buses in Leipzig. Most lines run every 10 minutes during the day and at least hourly at night. A single-trip ticket costs (prices as of May 2018) €2.60. A full day bus & tram ticket, valid 24 hours, costs €7.40; a day ticket for 5 people traveling together costs €23.00. A weekly pass costs €26.10. After 8pm, you must enter buses through the driver's door and show/purchase your ticket. For trips within 4 stops a short trip ticket is available for €1.90.

The tram network is structured like a star with a circle in the center. Tram lines generally lead from the outskirts into the city, which they half-circle on the ring, and continue to someplace else in the outskirts. Bus lines provide additional direct connections that often do not touch the center. 

Trains ("S-Bahn") are crossing the city center in north-south direction though the city tunnel, connecting Hauptbahnhof and Bayerischer Bahnhof via underground stations at Markt and at Wilhelm-Leuschner Platz. From both ends of the tunnel lines branch off into several directions towards Leipzig suburbs like Connewitz, Stötteritz, Thekla, fair area and Miltitzer Allee and beyond. Please note that the city tunnel provides fast connections north - south, but is not of great help in the east - west direction. 

Tickets

LVB is part of the regional integrated transport network MDV Tickets to nearby towns and cities (e.g. ) are available at LVB ticket offices and vending machines. Tickets can be purchased by cash or credit card. They are valid for all participating means of transportation. The fares quoted above are for MDV fare zone 110, which is the area within the city limits. A single-trip ticket includes transfers to other lines. You have to complete your trip within one hour. Buy tickets from:
* Vending machines at some stops and at all train stations, payable with coins or (small) bills
* Vending machines inside the trams. Coins only
* Bus drivers
* One of the LVB service offices
* Some tobacco, stationery, or press shops

Stamp your ticket after boarding the first bus or tram on your itinerary, or on the platform when using a train. Week tickets are issued for calendar weeks, month tickets for calendar months. Day and week tickets are valid until 4 a.m. the next day after their validity has ended; month tickets until noon the day after their validity has ended.

Ticket and service offices:
* LVB service and ticket office
* LVB service and ticket office

At a price moderately higher than the respective LVB tickets, in addition to unlimited rides, the LEIPZIG CARD offers discounts at a number of tourist attractions. The LEIPZIG CARD is available in three versions:

* Day ticket (valid for one person): €8.90
* 3-day ticket (valid for one person): €18.50
* 3-day group ticket (valid for two adults and up to 3 children under 14): €34.00

A leaflet listing all the benefits is available online 

Night bus network

Regular services operate until around midnight. A network of Nightliner bus lines (N1...N10) takes you around at night. All Nightliner buses start from Hauptbahnhof at 1:11, 2:22, and 3:33 a.m. They service most parts of the main tram network, but on different routes. Each line makes a loop, returning to Hauptbahnhof at the end. Check the blue network plans at stops or inside trams.

By taxi

Plenty of taxis are available. They wait for customers in various designated locations around the city. You can also wave a taxi on the street if its sign is lit up. To order a taxi to your current location call 4884. Pubs, restaurants and hotels will be happy to do that for you if you are their customer. Expect a fare of €15–20 for a trip from the outskirts to the center or vice versa.

By car

Leipzig suffers from the same traffic problems as all cities of its size. Access to the city center is restricted, so don't plan to go anywhere inside the inner ring of main streets.

If you still like to use a car within the city, be prepared to pay a fee for parking around the center. Car parks are available at Hauptbahnhof, Augustusplatz, Burgplatz, and several other locations. A parking guidance system is installed on the main streets. Around the inner ring, signs point you to the different car parks and display the current number of unused parking spots. Signs are color-coded, each color representing a car park location. Since the city center is pretty compact, for most purposes it won't matter much where you leave your car. When you visit the Gewandhaus or the opera, the car park underneath Augustusplatz is the most convenient option with exits to both buildings.

Watch for the trams when making turns. They are stronger than your car and sometimes come from behind beside the street. At marked tram stops, if the driving lane is to the right of the track, you have to wait behind a stopping tram and let passengers get on and off. After everyone is off the street, you may pass slowly.

Starting in March 2011, most of the city of Leipzig will become a designated (Umweltzone). Cars operating within the limits of the city have to comply with strict emission standards. Many modern cars do, but to enter the zone your car has to show it by exhibiting a green badge (Feinstaubplakette). If you enter the city without this badge, or with a yellow or red badge, you risk a fine.

See

* built in 1556 in the Renaissance style and remains one of Germany's largest. The position of the tower follows the ancient ideal of "golden mean". Located on the pretty main square of the city, it is a good orientation point. The Old City Hall was built 1556 by Hieronymus Lotter on basements of two Patrician houses. It is a beautiful Renaissance style building, 90 meters long with arcades (1906 - 09), six gables and a tower. In the 18th century the tower was enlarged and it received a Baroque spire. Until 1904 the Old City Hall was home of the city administration. Then it became home of the city museum. Most impressive is the huge Banquetting Hall with Renaissance interior (open fireplaces). Many fine works of medieval religious art: altars, paintings, wood-carved sculptures etc. Most of them were saved from churches which were deconstructed in Leipzig's surrounding. Very impressive are the rooms with interior from old Patrician houses. Also interesting: the treasure chamber (steep and narrow staircase!). This Renaissance building was erected in just nine months in 1556/57 under the direction of the architect Hieronymus Lotter. The municipal government moved into the New Town Hall in the year 1909. If you have a bit of luck you are allowed to visit the cellar of the building. Here you find the chamber of torture and the jail. Leipzig's Renaissance City hall contains a museum of city history which possesses the original of the only confirmed painting of Bach produced in his lifetime. It also contains interesting information regarding the public executions that previously took place in the market in front of the city hall. The most famous execution was that of Woyzeck later made famous by the Büchner play and the opera of Alban Berg. The interior of the Old City Hall (built in 1556) is far more interesting than the outside view. Inside there's an interesting museum covering the history of Leipzig from the very beginnings (in 12th century) till our days. One of the most touristy places of the whole city.

Churches 

* The church where Bach worked as a cantor from 1723 until his death in 1750. His remains are buried under a bronze epitaph near the altar.

* Leipzig's largest church. Starting point for the peaceful revolution on October 9, 1989, when 600 SED, who were sent to break up the protest joined the protesters. Every Monday at 5pm since 1982, the church holds peace prayers.

*One of the many traces of the Napoleonic wars in and around Leipzig: 
a memorial church to the honours of Russian soldiers who died during the Napoleonic wars. 

Museums

* Opened in 1999, this is a museum about the GDR. There is one permanent exhibition about the life in the GDR and the fall of the GDR; the other exhibition changes aprox. every two month and has similar topics.

* Housed in the former Stasi headquarters, this is an interesting museum documenting the Stasi (DDR secret police) and its methods of controlling and manipulating the people. Displays are in German - there is not much English inside. English audio guides are available for €5.

* 

* Housed in a glass cube, this museum features paintings from the 15th century through today. Highlights include paintings by local artists Max Beckman and Max Klinger, as well as Caspar David Friedrich, Lucas Cranach the Younger, and Claude Monet.

* Includes the Museum of Applied Arts, the Musik Museum, and Museum of Ethnology.

* The nature museum, filled with all kinds of taxidermy creatures. As of January 2011, city officials are pondering plans of closing the museum soon and reopening it in a different location later with a redesigned exhibition. 

*Exhibition of pewter figures in historically-themed dioramas. The location, the gatehouse and only remainder of an old manor, was one of the hotspots in the battles of the Napoleonic wars. 

*

*The university's library. 

*History of psychiatry.

*Pharmacy museum

*History of schooling

*A museum about coffee and coffee culture in Europe's oldest continuously operating coffee house 

*Changing exhibitions of contemporary art.

Famous houses

Fair-houses and passages

Unique to Leipzig is its number of passages in the city center. Some have big entrances, while others may look from the street just like a gate left open. Some belong to historical buildings, some have appeared only a few years ago.

* Upscale shops and bars. The entrance to Auerbachs Keller is inside. Forms a bigger system with Königshauspassage and Messehofpassage.

* 

* The oldest passage in Leipzig

* Calm atmosphere in the middle of the city. Inside you'll find the arthouse cinema Passage Kinos.

* 

Architecture

*Baroque architecture. 

*Apartment houses in concentric circles, built in the late 1920s/early 1930s. Streets named after characters from the Song of the Nibelungs.

*Curved to follow the street, huge like a castle – Leipzig's most prominent relict of the Stalin era sits at the Ring next to the Gewandhaus.

*Europe's largest uninterrupted Gründerzeit district.

*An industrial district whose time of glory has passed. Many of its factories died a slow death during the GDR years, which suddenly became visible with the re-unification of Germany. Today it is a mixture of old industrial buildings, some in ruins and others repurposed; fallow land; and new developments. Walk around Karl-Heine-Straße between Felsenkeller and the railway station Bahnhof Plagwitz, Weißenfelser Straße and Gießerstraße to get a feeling for the place, or walk the path alongside the Karl-Heine-Kanal. May appear a bit spooky at night.

*Herrmann Julius Meyer, owner of a publishing company, initiated in the late 19th century several development projects to provide adequate but cheap housing to factory workers and their families. 
*You can see two early highrise buildings (by the standards of their time) around Augustusplatz. One is the Krochhochaus on the western side of the square, which you can see in the background of the fountain photo above. The other is the Europahaus in the southeastern corner of the square, across the street from the Gewandhaus. 

*Besides the tower of the new townhall and the Völkerschlachtenkmal, three highrise buildings shape the skyline of Leipzig. The City-Hochhaus (Augustusplatz) was originally built as part of the university campus but sold to private investors in the 1990s. The Wintergartenhochhaus next to the Hauptbahnhof (Wintergartenstraße) is an apartment building. The Westin hotel was erected in the late 1970s and opened in 1981 as Hotel Merkur.

Other sights

* At 91m tall, this is the biggest monument in Europe, commemorating the Battle of Leipzig in the Napoleonic Wars, in which the combined Prussian, Austrian, and Russian forces defeated Napoleon at a cost of 100,000 lives. The top platform can be visited (steep, narrow stairs). Every summer, the 'bath tub' race is held in the reflecting pool below. 

* It's the oldest one in Germany and one of the first in the world. 

* Although pricey, this is one of the largest and best known zoos in Germany. New elephants' enclosure has a swimming pool where you can watch the elephants bathing from under the water level. Visit the Gondwanaland tropical species exhibit and the monkey house.

*The national library of Germany collects works published in Germany or in the German language. It consists of three buildings from different epochs: the original main building opened in 1916 with two later extensions integrated, a windowless depot tower from the late 70s/early 80s, and book-shaped fourth extension to be opened in May 2011. The center of the main building is a large reading room worth a visit just for its atmosphere. If you wish to use the library or just move around freely you will have to pay a fee and provide government-issued photo ID. If you ask the security guards nicely, they may accompany you to the entrance of the reading room and let you glimpse into it. No photography.

*A converted cotton mill in the Plagwitz industrial district, today providing work and exhibition rooms to artists.

*Germany's oldest preserved railway station, built in 1842, only 7 years after the first train line of Germany had been opened. The station is no longer in use but one can still view the portal. In the course of the construction of the city tunnel the entire portal was moved away and later relocated to its original place. There is a new underground station "Bayerischer Bahnhof" as part of the city tunnel. All S-Bahn-trains stop there.

*Located across the ring southwest of the New Town Hall (Neues Rathaus), the appearance of this building resembles the original look of the Reichstag in . It was built from 1888 to 1895 for the Court of the German Empire (Reichsgericht), the highest court of the Reich. During the GDR years the building served a variety of uses and hosted the Museum der Bildenden Künste. After refurbishment, the Federal Administrative Court (Bundesverwaltungsgericht) moved into the Reichsgericht building in 2002. You can visit the entrance hall, the large courtroom, and the Reichsgerichtsmuseum with an exhibition on the history of the building. Visitor access may get restricted without prior notice if the work of the court requires it.

* Huge panoramic picture surrounding the viewe. The theme changes from time to time. The building was originally used as a gas storage tank.

* Leipzig's highest building has a restaurant and an observation platform at its top with a great view over the town. 

Do

If you understand some German, get a copy of the monthly city magazine Kreuzer or use the event calendar on their website to get information on upcoming events. You can buy the Kreuzer for €2.50 in press shops and bookstores throughout the city. 

If you don't understand much, or any, German, buy a copy of Leipzig Zeitgeist, the city's International Voice, and one of the few English language city magazines in Germany!

Concerts

* Mendelssohn's orchestra still exists, but the concert hall is new. Inside is a huge painting by Sighard Gille, visible through the windows from Augustusplatz. 

*Listen to the St Thomas Boys Choir performing Bach's music in its original environment. Be aware that a guest choir may sing instead at any time as the St. Thomas Choir travels a lot. Since the motet is primarily a musical form of devotion and not a musical performance for tourists, applause is uncommon and frowned upon. 

*The opera house of Leipzig. Though the building is only 50 years old, the company looks back at more than 300 years of history.

Festivals

* Organized by the Bach Museum.

* Besides the main event on the fairground, readings take place in various locations around the city.

* World's largest Goth festival includes a pagan village, medieval market, and goth music.
 
* Funfair, twice a year in spring (April/May) and fall (September/October)

*Meeting of hot air balloon pilots. Lots of flying balloons if the weather permits flying.

*Festival of contemporary European Theatre.

*

Outdoors

Lakes

Leipzig is surrounded by several lakes resulting from former open-cast lignite mining and now developed into places for various outdoor activities. You can spend a day on the beach, ride a canoe, or go fishing or scuba diving just 10 km from the city center. The closest lakes are:
 
* Beach; camping; fishing, water sports. This one is the oldest of the close lakes. Converted from a mine in the sixties, the city grew towards it in the eighties with the Grünau development.

* Named after Cospuden, a village that fell victim to opencast mining, this lake was the first lignite mine conversion in the reagion after the end of the GDR. Locals instantly and enthusiastically adopted their new "Costa Cospuda". The northern Beach (Nordstrand) is broad and sandy, the perfect place to spend a hot summer day. 

* The youngest of the nearby lakes and perhaps a bit quieter than the other two. It has rather small beaches but a long promenade.

Riverside woods and parks

A green ribbon of woods and parks crosses the city following the rivers Elster, Pleiße, Parthe, and Luppe. From the Cospudener See in the south through the Clara-Zetkin Park, west of the city center along the Elsterflutbecken, and to the northwest between Leutzsch and Möckern you'll find a landscape that sometimes makes you forget you are in a city. 

* Really a collection of several parks that locals may still know and refer to by their original names: Johannapark, Albertpark, Volkspark Scheibenholz, and Palmengarten. Walk westwards from the new city hall to find the Johannapark, starting at the crossing of Karl-Tauchnitz-Straße and Friedrich-Ebert-Staße

* The second largest park of Leipzig, located northwest of the city center. From the Rosental you can get a glimpse into the zoo without having to pay the entrace fee (Zooschaufenster near the large meadow). Crossing Waldstraße and continuing in northwestern direction you will find a small hill with a watchtower on top.

* Observation tower. See the city from above. Admission is free. You'll have to climb up stairs in the open and stand on a platform that may shake a bit in the wind.

* Originally a landfill with WW II debris, this hill is today a park and the location for several recurrent events: the Fockeberglauf in March and November (a running competition), the Fockebergzeitfahren (an uphill bicycle race), and the Prix de Tacot (a soapbox car race).

* Watch wild animals in the woods. If you feel like hiking, after passing through the Wildpark you can turn northwards and walk to Clara-Zetkin-Park, or walk south/southeast to Cospudener See. Both are about 2.5 km away.

Other Activities
* Parties organized by British robotics artist Jim Whiting. You can expect furniture that moves by itself, a waterfall made of bathtubs that you can climb into if you feel the need, and various other thrills and chills.

*Take a ride on a miniature railway circling around the Lake Auensee in the northwest of the city. 

Buy

There are lots of shops in the inner city (city center), mostly frequented by pedestrians. Leipzig and Germany souvenirs can be found at shops around the Old City Hall.
There are many independant retailers unique to Leipzig in Südvorstadt; with many interesting clothing stores, food places, and cinemas.

* As in many other German cities, Leipzig hosts the Leipziger Weinachtsmarkt, or Leipzig Christmas Market, which opens in the last week of November, first week of December and continues until a few days before Christmas Day. The Leipzig Christmas Market is a major event in the city and is essentially a large winter-themed carnival, complete with a giant Ferris Wheel on Augustusplatz in between the Opera House and the Gewandhaus, carrousels and other small rides in addition to the usual market stalls and food vendors. The festivities take place throughout the inner city of Leipzig, with a majority of the market stalls stationed on Market Square in front of the Old Town Hall, but also on Petersstraße, Grimmaische Straße and Nikolaistraße next to Nikolai Church. The market stalls sell a variety of gifts unique to the Ore Mountain region south of Leipzig, as well as various traditional market foods such as fried potato pancakes (Kartoffelpuffer), Heurigen (roasted roll with cheese and meat) and Glühwein (a mulled wine). There are also carolers and Christmas-themed events. 

* Large shopping mall that includes C&A, H&M, Esprit.

* The Hauptbahnhof is not only one of the biggest train stations in Europe, it's a great shopping mall as well (On three floors boutiques and restaurants are located next to drug stores and supermarkets)

* local vegetables and all kinds of fruits and flowers.
* may be a bit cheaper (mostly lower grade goods at a lower price and some disount offers) but the atmosphere is not so nice. sometimes there are market criers around.
*
*a nice alternative fleamarket with approx. 100 boothes of locals selling handmade stuff, some antiques and second hand clothes on the pavements. there is also some musics groups and food.
*One of the largest shopping malls in Germany.
*Höfe am Brühl is a new 22,300 sqm shopping center located at Richard-Wagner-Platz consisting of 130 well known shops such as H&M, Promod, Media Markt, and others. In advance of its new design, the previous structure was demolished in February 2010. The original structure, was nearly identical and contained the characteristic aluminum facade that was associated with the previous Höfe am Brühl. Originally, the space contained the Brühl trading houses, which connected local farms with the respective houses located on Richard-Wagner-Str. and were heavily destroyed during World War II.

Cafés

Leipzig has a long and lively coffee house tradition. Although many of the old cafés have disappeared, this tradition lives on. Besides Zum Arabischen Coffee Baum (listed under Museums above) a number of cafés give you a place to relax and have a cup of coffee during the day. 

* 100 years old. Two copper elephant heads guard the entrance. The interior is put under preservation and has been restored to its original glory in the 1990s. Unfortunately, the “glory” of the place is hijacked by over-priced and terrible coffee (€4.40 for a double espresso), served by waitresses who believe your disdain for the coffee comes from not being able to appreciate “strong coffee”.

* Art-deco style. Opened in 1919, refurbished in 1998-2000. Outside the city center.

Bars and pubs

* This pub has been around since medieval times. Opened in 1525, it is among the oldest continuously operated pubs in Germany. The barrel cellar (only opened for private parties) has been the background to a scene in one of Germany's most famous plays, "Faust" by Goethe. The master of German literature himself used to drink his wine here, and the rooms are frequently the set for a live, around-the-city re-enactment of the play.

* Sleek design.

* Includes the city's prettiest beer garden but not many vegetarian options. Try their beer specialty 'Gose'. It's made with coriander and salt, and is very much an acquired taste. It is usually served with a shot of liquor.

* Has the largest number of different brands of absinth in a building from the 16th century. Smoky place.
 
* Always a happening place. DJs, football games, and partying all night.
