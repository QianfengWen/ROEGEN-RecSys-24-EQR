Lagos, the commercial capital of , is the largest city in with an estimated population of over 17.5 million inhabitants in the city.

Districts
The main districts are the mainland, Greater Lagos and the Islands. Three major bridges join the island to the mainland. They are the Carter Bridge which start from Iddo Island, the Eko Bridge (formerly called the Second Mainland Bridge) and the Third Mainland Bridge which passes through densely populated mainland suburbs through Lagos lagoon.

* The Mainland holds a greater percentage of inhabitants and industries. Lagos Mainland districts include Ebute-Meta, Surulere (site of two stadiums and National theater), Yaba (location of the University of Lagos) and Ikeja, site of Murtala Muhammed International Airport and capital of Lagos State. 

* Greater Lagos includes Mushin, Maryland, Somolu, Oshodi, Oworonsoki, Isolo, Ikotun, Agege, Iju Ishaga, Egbeda, Ketu, Bariga, Ipaja, and Ejigbo.

* The Islands The two major urban islands of Lagos in Lagos Lagoon are Lagos Island and Victoria Island. These islands are separated from the mainland by the main channel draining the lagoon into the Atlantic ocean, which forms Lagos Harbour. The islands are separated from each other by creeks of varying sizes and are connected to Lagos Island by bridges.

:*Lagos Island Lagos Island contains a Central Business District (CBD). This district is characterized by high-rise buildings and businesses. The island also contains many of the city's largest wholesale marketplaces (such as the popular Idumota and Balogun markets). It also has the National Museum of Nigeria, a Central mosque, Glover Memorial Hall, Christ's Cathedral (CMS), and the Oba Palace. And lastly, there is the Tinubu Square- a site of historical importance, it was here that the Amalgamation ceremony that unified the North and South protectorate to form Nigeria took place in 1914. Ikoyi is situated on the eastern half of Lagos Island and joined to it by a landfill. Ikoyi is also connected to Victoria Island by a bridge carrying a main road over a Five Cowrie creek. Ikoyi has a great number of hotels, night clubs, a recreational park and one of Africa's largest golf courses. Originally a middle class neighbourhood, in recent years it has become more of a fashionable residential enclave for the upper middle class to the upper class.

:*Victoria Island Home to many company headquarters and entertainment spots, Victoria Island (also known as V.I) along with Ikoyi, occupies a major area in the suburbs of Lagos which boasts of several sizeable shopping districts. On its sea shore along the Atlantic front, there is an environmentally reconstructed Bar Beach.

* Eko Atlantic city is a new city under construction. It is a planned district being constructed on land reclaimed from the Atlantic Ocean. Dredgers, large ships which move sand, are all working around the clock filling the area with sand where the city will be built. Expected to be around 4 square miles, the city will satisfy needs for financial, commercial, residential and tourist accommodations with a state-of-the-art high-tech infrastructure in line with modern and environmental standards. These standards will offer the city’s residents modern water, waste management, security and transportation systems. Eko Atlantic will also offer its residents an independent source of energy generated specifically for the city.

Understand

Also known as Èkó in the Yoruba language, and also affectionately called 'Gidi' or 'Las Gidi' as a form of slang-by the younger generation, is a port and the most populous conurbation in Nigeria.

*Formerly the capital of Nigeria, Lagos is a huge metropolis which originated on islands separated by creeks.

*The city is the economic and financial capital of Nigeria.

*Portuguese explorer Rui de Sequeira visited the area in 1472, naming the area around the city Lago de Curamo; indeed the present name is Portuguese for "lakes". Another explanation is that Lagos was named for Lagos, Portugal - a maritime town which at the time was the main centre of the Portuguese expeditions down the African coast and whose own name is derived from the Latin word Lacobriga.

*From 1404-1889 it served as a major centre of the slave trade, ruled over by Yoruba kings called the Oba of Lagos.

*Lagos was the capital of Nigeria from 1914 up to 1991. The city was stripped of its status when the Federal Capital Territory was established at the purpose-built city of Abuja.

The city of Lagos lies in south-western Nigeria, on the Atlantic coast in the Gulf of Guinea, west of the Niger River delta, located on longitude 3° 24' E and latitude 6° 27' N. Most of the population live on the mainland, and most industries are located there too. Lagos is known for its music and night life which used to be located in areas around Yaba and Surulere but in recent years more night clubs have sprung on the island making the island especially Victoria Island, the main nightlife attraction.

Get in

By plane
You can fly in from many European cities (, , , , ); from , , , , , , , There are also direct flights from the (, , ).

When departing via the International Airport in Lagos, arrive early, especially close to weekends and festive days, as the security has been beefed up significantly (with little increase in manpower or scanners and is much, much more time-consuming than previously) since the December 2009 liquid explosive incident where the terrorist started his journey from Lagos airport.

The domestic and international terminals at Lagos airport are several miles apart. Transferring between the two is difficult and time-consuming. 

There are quite a number of pay-access and Priority Pass lounges after passport control (after two hours in the security queue, you will want to use one if you have the time and USD50 to spare). Use Oasis or Skye Lounge, both of which are good, especially Oasis which is very nice, on a par with other premium airport lounges globally. Gabfol lounge is free, but you pay for food and drinks.

By train
Rail services in Nigeria are still very slow and unreliable but Nigerian Railway Corporation have just re-started an overnight service from via to Lagos. There are departures a few times every week. There is a new railway line from Lagos to Ibadan.

By bus
Several bus companies like Greener Line Transport Limited, ABC Transport, Ifesinachi and The Young Shall Grow offer daily services from almost all major cities around Nigeria.

Lagos is about 100km from the border with .

Get around
If you choose to travel to Lagos, then air transport is best if you can afford it. If travelling around Lagos, be sure to be accompanied by a guide who is familiar with the routes. Moving around Lagos has become much easier in recent times with street signs on every single street corner making it easier to locate places and landmarks. With the city spending huge budgets on security, there has been a huge reduction in crime generally. For the most part, it's safe to move about during the day. If you are going out at night, be sure to go in groups, and stick to known routes. 

If you are not on a tight budget, you should hire a car and driver, usually available from most of the major hotels and the airport. The price will be around ₦1,000-2,000 per hour, you will be expected to haggle. Talk to the drivers and find one you think will be able to communicate best with as they will be able to tell you things about the places you pass.

By bus

Lagos now has decent mass transit buses courtesy of the Bus Rapid Transit(BRT)schemes. The BRT lines run on physically segregated lanes and thus make them run faster while private cars are stuck in traffic. The system is run by two operators, NURTW Cooperative (Nigerian Union of Road Transport Workers) and , a Lagos State Government owned Asset Management Company. The Buses are coloured red (LagBus), and blue (NURTW). 

The BRT is one of the three-pronged attacks the state has unleashed against the urban traffic congestion in Lagos. Buses can be an inexpensive and convenient option. Bus fares are relatively affordable and there are numerous routes being plied from the Mainland to the Islands.

The tickets for the BRT and the Lagbus can be purchased at the bus stops before boarding. Tickets range NGN70-120 (Oct 2011). However, the ticket vendors are seldom available in the evening even though the buses ply till late at night. It makes good sense to purchase a ticket booklet or a couple of tickets in bulk beforehand since these don't contain a time stamp.

There are also smaller yellow buses that ply all routes from the mainland to the island and within mainland. For a newbie, the yellow bus system can be quite confusing and it makes good sense to approach a local for help. The local Nigerians will be more than happy to help an Oyinbo(white person). The fare is fixed and starts from NGN20 and increases as per distance. 

The BRT buses are faster, cleaner and more convenient. They carry hundreds of thousands of passengers on a weekly basis.

By car
The road network of Lagos for the most part is good, but sometimes traffic congestion and limited parking space especially during working hours is rife. Be sure to be on the lookout for road signs, in order to avoid entering one-way roads or streets. LASTMA (Lagos State Traffic Management Agency) is the body responsible for managing traffic in most of the traffic congestion areas. Make sure to follow traffic rules, and avoid driving in the BRT Bus lanes to avoid getting a fine or having your car impounded. 

There exists car parks around in hotels, shopping malls, and some of them provide free and safe parking. But if parking in other areas around the city be ready to pay around N250 or more. (N165=$1)

By taxi

One of the easiest ways to get around is by taxi. Taxis cost more than buses, typically. With the older taxi cabs it is expected to negotiate the price before you enter and pay on arrival. The cabs are relatively safe. The state has embarked on gradual replacement of rickety buses and taxi cabs with modern ones, fitted with good facilities to enhance comfort.

Through public-private partnerships, new cabs are being introduced regularly by licensed cab operators. 
With fare as low as N400, depending on the distance, the new air-conditioned taxi cabs are already creating a new image for Lagos. 
Taxis can be found almost everywhere, and all the new cabs have numbers on them that you can call for a pick up. There are several cab companies servicing Lagos, using both metered and fixed fares,and they generally accept cash: 

* 

* 

* 

By rented car
Renting a car is another alternative if you are going to be staying for a few days or longer. There are numerous car rental offices in the city, and therefore it is very easy to rent a car from your hotel or resort accommodation to drive around with for the duration of your stay. Avis is your best bet for this,either call or make use of their online services: 

* 

* 

* Chauffeur drivenair-conditioned SUV car rental car hire service.

* 

* 

By ferry
Lagos State Ferry Services Corporation runs a few regular routes, for example between Lagos Island and the mainland, modern ferries and wharves. Private boats run irregular passenger services on the lagoon and on some creeks. Many more routes are expected to get on-board in due time.

By rail
A planned railway line running through the Lagos metropolis is being constructed with plans of completion as early as 2022.

Motorbikes
For travelling short distances, you can use motorbike taxis called Okada. These motorbikes are quick, cheap and save a lot of walking but they are also very dangerous. Okada accidents are very common but safety equipment are now provided because the state government and in fact the Federal Road Safety Commission has mandated it. If you want to take the risk, you can safely halve their first price, and usually there are lots to choose from. Before you try and negotiate, confirm the fare from a local.If you have a Nigerian friend, let them negotiate for you as the quoted fare differs greatly for locals and foreigners(for obvious reasons). Choose an older driver as the younger ones are cowboys. 

Safety Helmets are a must at all times for both the rider and passenger. Majority of times these are ill-fitting and sometimes even absent. 

By law, Okadas are forbidden to ply after dark(7PM) for safety reasons. Avoid taking an Okada for long distances, while it's raining and in the night since majority of mainland is devoid of street lights.

See

Badagry Town: The Ancient Slave Port of Badagry-also known as the 'Point of No Return'. This ancient town of Badagry was founded around 1425 A.D. Before its existence, people lived along the Coast of Gberefu and this area later gave birth to the town of Badagry. It is the second largest commercial town in Lagos State, located an hour from Lagos and half hour from the Republic du Benin.

Sights

There are over a dozen beaches in Lagos, making for a wide array to choose from. Good for picnics and barbecues 

* Lagos Bar Beach. This Beach is named after the sand bars that characterize the coastline of Lagos, not because of the myriad of bars that run along the beach itself. Very popular among beach goers,it is the main inner city beach, as the other beaches provide more of a “get away” from the city. Some of which include; Lekki Beach, Alpha Beach, Eleko Beach and (to the East) and , Ogogoro Island, , Lighthouse beach, Ilashe Beach, Agaja Beach and (to the West) amongst others. 

* Tarkwa Bay. Tarkwa is a man made bay and beach created during the formation of the Lagos harbour. It's a sheltered beach within the harbour breakwater. It is easily accessible by boat from Tarzan Jetty at Maroko (Charge per person is low and affordable) or under Falomo bridge on Victoria Island. The beach is a pleasant outing and has safe bathing even for children. It has its own resident community, most of whom make their living from the tourists who visit the beach. There's also the possibility to surf in a corner of Tarkwa Bay and other water sports such as Jet Skiing and Water Skiing are fairly common.

* Lighthouse Beach.Right beside Tarkwa Bay is the , named after the 110-year-old lighthouse that guards the entrance to Lagos harbour. The Lighthouse can just be seen from the beach, and is well worth a visit as well. The walk along the beach between Tarkwa Bay and Lighthouse Beach is very pleasant– and at times one can be the only person on the beach. You can watch the many ships queuing up to enter the port on the nearby horizon.

* Eko Tourist Resort (Akodo Beach), KM 22 Lekki-Epe Expressway, Ibeju, Lekki LGA, Akodo, (Bookings)+1 777 0700, +1 470 2865. This place is at least a 40 minute drive from Lagos. The Resort has chalets,restaurants and a large conference hall on 10 acres, with more than a half a mile of clean beach.

Do
Lagos has traditionally not been viewed as a place for tourists, though there are sights and experiences to be had if you make an effort.

There are a lot of great beaches. Especially if you make the effort to get outside the the city and explore places like Badagry. Inside the city, Lekki is about as good as it gets.

There are also lots of markets to see, although it can be very tiring. The activities in these places are quite boisterous, and expect overzealous traders to sometimes grab your hand in lighthearted attempts to persuade you to come to their shops instead of competitors shops. Don't panic, but be firm yet friendly, and keep going your own way.

There is the Lekki Conservation Centre by the Lekki Conservation Foundation, is down on the Lekki/Epe expressway near Chevron.It is really good for relaxation, it's a dense park with a few animals and birds, there are walkways and benches to rest on. Fees: ₦500 for everyone

*Art gallery, theatre, food court, library and book store

Buy
Unless you are in a supermarket or restaurant/bar with fixed prices, you will be expected to negotiate the price you pay for an item down to the lowest the vendor would sell. When you are stuck in traffic, expect to see hawkers selling anything from potatoes to drinks . Expect any brand names in these informal markets to be fake, and should you wish to purchase them aim for a very low price.

Some of the good places for shopping are:

*The City Mall, Opposite Muson Centre, Awolowo Rd, Onikan, Lagos Island. Daily 10:00-21:00.

*.

*A large shopping mall consisting of gift and clothing stores, restaurants, a cinema hall, and others. There is also a popular place called Computer Village in Ikeja the capital of Lagos.

*Lekki Art Market, close to the Lekki Conservation Centre, is a great place to buy Nigerian and West African art. From paintings, to jewellery, to souvenirs to accessories and clothes, You'll find a great deal for your goods. Brush up your bargaining skills. The place is a bit tricky to find, take a right from the roundabout before Chevron and ask for directions.

Stay safe
In general, Lagos has become a much safer place to visit than before, with the state spending huge budgets on security with police patrol cars, CCTV cameras. etc. But beware of deals or businesses that sound too good to be true (especially e-mails soliciting your help), and do not openly flaunt your possessions, especially in public places.

While it is rare for a tourist to be a victim of a violent crime, it is still wise to stay safe and be alert, especially during late night outings. Stick to crowded streets and make sure to go out in groups instead of going out alone. 

Lagosians are generally nice and friendly people, most of whom will readily offer directions to you if you are lost. 

Lagos still has its fair share of odd people: street beggars(both the old and young), people with psychological disorders, etc. If someone approaches you for money, do what most Lagosians do: completely ignore them or continuing to walk at a brisk pace.

There are a few police officers who are corrupt and inefficient so it is best that you stick to the law and avoid going anywhere off the beaten path without a trusted guide, especially if it is a first visit.

Terrorism is not a major issue in Lagos, unlike other parts of Nigeria.

But its occassional and that is the reason if you want to stay for a long term,make sure that you have atleast two phones or a dual sim phone.
