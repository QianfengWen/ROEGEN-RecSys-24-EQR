Palanga is a popular seaside resort at the Baltic sea in .

Understand
Not far there was discovered an encampment which indicates that the area was inhabited some 5,000 years ago. Between the 10th and 13th centuries, Palanga was one of the main settlements inhabited by the Curonians. It was situated on the trail of the ancient Amber Road, between Northern and Southern Europe, so at the same was an important center of trade and crafts. The name of Palanga was first mentioned in 1161 when King Valdemar I of Denmark disembarked there with his army and captured the castle of the Curonians.

Palanga is a resort town through which the stream Rąžė flows into the Baltic Sea. Rąžė was formerly known as Alanga and gave Palanga its name. 

The western edge of the city is washed by the Baltic Sea, there are many beaches here. The 200m stretch of coastline includes a beach, sand dunes, and strips of coastal pine forest. The two most famous dunes are Birutė and Naglis Hills. The sea and the beach here are two inseparable things for both locals and guests. But the locals are so attuned to the environment that they don't even notice it.

See

* Birutė hill is a relic dune located next to Palanga Botanical Park, very close to the sea. According to legend, there was a pagan shrine at the foot of a hill in Palanga where a beautiful priestess named Birutė used to tend the ceremonial fires. Having heard of Birutė's beauty, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, came to make her his wife. She refused. Then she was taken by force and was brought to Trakai, and celebrated a wedding. After the duke's death, Birutė returned to Palanga and resumed serving at the shrine until her death. It is said that she was buried in the hill which is now named after her.
* To the south of the city center is Palangas Botanical Garden, which is more like a forest and boosts the Amber Museum. It's a more quiet place, especially in winter, but is nice to stroll around. A bit further into it, there is Birute Hill a forested sand dune, where excavations showed settlements from far back in time and now has a little chapel. From there you can take a nice walk back into town via the beach.

Do
* The focal point of Palanga, and the highlight of any visit to Palanga, is J.Basanavicius Street, between Vytauto Street and the pier. Along this street can be found most of the town's bars, restaurants, nightclubs, funfairs, and souvenir shops. People-watching is a fashionable, and fascinating pastime here.

* Palanga has a beach, but it is very crowded in summer since all Lithuanians come to their short coastline. The beach extends in several kilometres either direction from the pier. Given that Palanga is Lithuania's main tourist resort, expect the beach to be very crowded in summer. The busiest areas are on either side of the pier. Though the beach is less crowded further from the pier.

Buy
Items made from amber are one of the town's specialties, and range from inexpensive jewelry and small pictures with pieces of amber (or imitation amber) stuck on, up to very high-quality items. There are good opportunities to buy souvenirs on your way to the beach, where tents with souvenirs are set up. 
* 

Eat
At the beach, you can enjoy a cheap cheburek and cold beer (sold by young peddlers). A bit of a warning though, the chebureks are not made in a local restaurant, and are deemed "illegal" for unsanitary conditions in which they are thought to be made, but, I have tried many chebureks and I haven't had food poisoning (yet). So buy from the peddlers at your own discretion.
