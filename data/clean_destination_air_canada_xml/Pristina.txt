__TOC__ Pristina (: Prishtinë or Prishtina; : Приштина Priština) is the capital city of .

Understand

Talk
The main language you will hear in the street is . English is widely spoken. Most of people from Kosovo, especially young people, speak at least a little English so you can more than likely get by. Navigating around the city is easy - the city centre is small and walkable. Serbian is Kosovo's other official language, but it is seldom heard on the streets in the capital. German is easily the next most widely spoken language. Ties between the Kosovo Albanian diaspora in Germany and Switzerland and Kosovo are very strong; many older Kosovo Albanians have worked there as guest workers in the past.

Get in
 By plane 
The easiest way to get to Pristina is by plane. There are direct flights to Pristina International Airport () from London, Zurich, Geneva, Gothenburg, Copenhagen Vienna, Hamburg, Hannover, Cologne, Dusseldorf, Berlin, Frankfurt, Munich, Stuttgart, Bremen, Verona, Ljubljana, Budapest, Tirana, Istanbul, Oslo and Helsinki. There are low-budget flights to Pristina from , and with Easyjet from Switzerland. There are cheap connecting flights via and , but also from most of German airports. UAE-based Air Arabia flies twice a week from Sharjah, connecting Pristina to the Middle East.

Airport bus 1A started running an hourly service between the airport and the city in late April 2019. For timetables, visit the Pristina transport website: 

There is a bus that goes from the airport of Prishtina to downtown and it costs only 3 euros. Cabs are around 20 to 30 euros. The bus runs from 5 am till 11 pm every half an hour and it’s yellow. When you get out of the airport it’s stop is on the left side.

If you arrive at Pristina airport - small, haphazard but recently modernized and efficient in a Balkan kind of way - you should get from the plane to the outside world within 15 minutes. The city itself is about 25 minutes away by car. The many taxi drivers outside the airport will quote you 25-30€ for the trip but 15€ is what you really should pay. Insist on the price and walk away if the driver won't agree. You can also call a local taxi dispatch agency beforehand, and have a driver waiting for you for €15 (plus the price of the phone call). If you pretend to be waiting for a lift from someone else they'll compete with each other down as far as 5 Euros, but it hardly seems fair.

There is a not very frequent shuttle service from the nearby Skopje Airport leaving the airport at 13:15 on Sun, Mon and Thu (as of Aug 2013). Price is €10 one way. Look for the sabagroup minibus in the parking lot. To confirm the timetable visit their website 

 By bus 
From , there are several daily direct bus connections to Pristina, from (€ 15), and (€ 16). In Tirana the bus office and stop is right behind the Hotel Internation. As of Dec 2011, there are two busses daily, at 06:00 and 15:00, and a ride takes approximately 6 hrs. There is no formal bus station in Tirana.

There are also direct bus links from most cities in Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Turkey, Macedonia, Bosnia, and Montenegro.

(As of 15th July 2012) From in there is a daily night bus at 9:30PM that runs via and arrives in Pristina at 5AM - €16.

There is one bus every night that runs from Pristhina to Ulcinj, Montenegro with stops in Peja, Prodgorica and Bar. The buses leave at 7PM from both Pristhina and Ulcinj. The trip is €20 round trip and take 9 hours.

From in there are buses at 0600, 0800, 0900, 1010, 1100, 1145, 1230, 1320, 1400, 1500, 1545, 1630, 1700 and 18:10 hrs as of May 2014. Tickets cost 320 MKD (just over €5)

The bus station is quite a safe place to await sunrise (I was there on a Sunday morning). The bus station is not far away from the city center and can easily reached by foot, but if you want to take a taxi, the trip should cost you 1,5-3€ (minimum charge is 1,5€). The drivers near the bus station will quote you 5€ but that is a ripoff. Walk a bit further away from the station and take one of the taxis there - and make sure the meter is on. 

From there are several direct buses from run by Albanian companies, costing around 2000 dinar, stops depending on the route in or . You can check the timetables at the Belgrade bus station website at Bus tickets can be purchased from the БАС bus station next to the train station in Belgrade. Buses leave at 5:45, 12:00, 13:30, 16:00, 16:30, 21:30, 22:00 and take 6-7 hours. 

If you are planning to travel from Kosovo to Serbia: WARNING: The serbian government doesn’t recognize Kosovo as an independent country but still as a Serbian territory. If you entered Kosovo from Albania, Macedonia or Montenegro, then you will be denied entry in Serbia at the Kosovo’s border because you didn’t enter Serbia legally, this is only happening if you are using your passport which will not have a Serbian entry ctamp. In this case, you will need to exit Kosovo through Albania, Montenegro or Macedonia (the easiest) and enter Serbian’s border directly, not from Kosovo. In order to cross the border from kosovo to Serbia you need either to have entered Kosovo from Serbia with your passport (in this case you would have a valid Serbian entry stamp) OR to use an ID card accepted by Serbia - ie from a "Yugoslav" or EU country or Switzerland (as this doesn't need to be stamped by Serbia in the first place).

Adio Turs run two buses daily from the main bus station in at 7:00 and 18:00. A one-way ticket costs 870 dinars. Ask for the bus to Gračanica (a Serb-majority town near Prishtina) and ask the bus driver to stop at Prishtina (otherwise, the bus will go straight past!). There are twice daily mini-buses from , they cost 600 dinars (about $10) and the guys at Niš Hostel ( will help you get in contact with organizers, even if you aren't sleeping there, as it is necessary to book in advance (information dates from October 2009). If entering direct from Serbia, be aware that you need to leave by the same way that you came in so that you get Serbian entry/exit stamps (see note under ).

There is also a bus service from Sarajevo (via Novi Pazar; Buy ticket to Novi Pazar on 10PM bus, the bus continues to Prishtina, tickets available onboard,i.e. the ticket Novi Pazar-Prishtina have to be bought on the bus, but after Novi Pazar; it is possible to buy the ticket Novi Pazar-Prishtina on the bus Sarajevo-Novi Pazar, it is the same bus that then continues to Prishtina; you can pay in euro, serbian dinar or bosnian mark); so from Sarajevo to Novi Pazar you buy the ticket for that trip (15 euro one way and 22 euros return - return has to be within a month)and after Novi Pazar you buy the ticket to Kosovo (7euros to Prishtina one way). You arrive in Novi Pazar at around 5.30. At 5.45 there is one bus that heads towards Skopje (Macedonia)with stops in Mitrovica and Prishtina as well as sometimes along the road (7/8 Euros is the ticket to Prishtina - the bus will stop on the road outside of the main bus station). It passes at the EULEX patrolled border post in North Kosovo, which might be quicker and more preferable. At 6.am there is a bus from Benko tours that leaves Novi Pazar direction Kosovo (final destination is Prizren). The bus used to pass through North Kosovo (only Serbian border post) - there are no security issues,even after July 25,2011, but when there is heavy snow the bus will not be able to the trip. In that case, you have to do the alternative route (if the weather permits) over Rozaje pass in Montenegro and Pec/Peja - bus to Rozaje from Novi Pazar at 9.30a.m. (4,50€) and then with taxi to Peja/Pec bus station (taxi will cost around 30 euros), in Peja/Pec every 20 minutes buses to Pristina (4€). Overall the trip Sarajevo-Novi Pazar-Prishtina over Mitrovica lasts around 11 hours and costs around €22 (one way - return is a bit cheaper.) The bus should be in Prishtina around 9 a.m. and continues to Prizren. Advantage of passing through North Kosovo (non Eulex border) is that you enter Kosovo via Serbia, which might save you trouble if you exit Kosovo via Serbia. Whether this is important very much depends on the political climate and on the agreements between Belgrade and Prishtina. Alternatively,if you pass through Montenegro,you can ask Kosovo police not to stamp the Kosovo entry stamp in the passport as you have to exit via Serbia. Even better,though,is if you use your ID cards when travelling to and from Kosovo.

 By train 
There are trains which travel from Macedonia and Serbia to Pristina. These take long to get there. See 

Get around
*City buses are the preferred method of local travel. They run on set routes and cost next to nothing, 40 or 50 cents a trip. It is usual to pay when you get in so try to have some change. The collector will come for the money after you have sat down. Minibuses were replaced by city bus since Oct. 1st 2006. For detailed maps and timetables, visit 

*Taxis are readily available but more expensive. Make sure your driver has a meter in his vehicle. No trip around the centre or from the centre to Dragodan / Arberia, Valenia, Sunny Hill, etc. should cost more than 2-3 €. The minimum charge is 1,5€. 

The roads in Pristina (and in general throughout ) are pretty bad, but the government is doing a lot in improving that. A lot of times you will be stuck in traffic due to road repairs. This is a result of a number of factors such as: they were never especially good, Yugoslav tank treads and UCK mortars fired at those tanks did nothing to help the situation, and NATO sealed the deal in '99 with its stealth bombings and armoured convoys. Since then, UNMIK and the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government (PISG, Kosovo's nascent government) have simply not had the money to invest in infrastructure. 
Two or three of the main roads that make up the major road network have been repaved. Some roads have have disintegrated to the point that they are pretty much just dirt and gravel.

See
 

*Don't miss the Pristina Ethnographic museum tucked back in the old town streets about 5 minutes walk from the main museum. It's been creatively curated, with video and music, and is housed in two stunning eighteenth and nineteenth century houses, one kept as it would have been lived in, the other with 'the room of birth', 'the room of death', costumes, and beautiful traditional jewellery with enthusiastic guides. 

*The national museum, in an Austro-Hungarian style building is free

*Check out the mosques on Nazim Gafurri Street including Jashar Pasha Mosque

*A couple minute's walk from the Grand Hotel Pristina is the library of the University of Pristina. It looks like it is constructed of massive concrete Lego bricks and then covered with chain mail. It is certainly worth a look.

*To see the city from street-level is best: you could start in front of the three-storey portrait of Bill Clinton, and stroll past the university to the Grand Hotel. Follow Nena Tereze (Mother Teresa) street towards the Skenderbeg monument and the new Government Building, then point yourself toward the historic mosques and the old quarter and market. You could also visit the park dedicated to now-deceased President Ibrahim Rugova. Stop off regularly at one of the cafes that are the heart of Kosovo's social, political and business life, and drink a wonderful makiato (the best outside of Italy).

*Out of the city, you can refresh and stretch your legs in Gërmia Park. During the summer, the lake-sized swimming pool here is a hot spot for families and young people, but year-round the park itself offers grassy spaces to relax or kick a ball around, and a network of trails through the dense woods perfect for dog-walking or drunken hide-and-seek tournaments. A couple of restaurants at the top of the park have good food and nice views. Also interesting to check out the cluster-bombed police bunker, just up the road from the best restaurant.

*Pay 1€ to get to the top of the bell tower and enjoy the panoramic view of the City. 

*Serbian Orthodox Church of Saint Nicholas is located in Shkodra Street. It was built in 1833 on the foundations of an older church building. Desecrated and vandalized in 1999 and again in 2004, the church is now partially renovated, with many scars still visible, and it is open for public. Entrance is free. To get to the church, first go to Shadërvani Square on the north end of the pedestrian zone, go past the Kosovo Museum, King's Mosque (Xhamia e Mbretit) and Sami Frasheri High School, and then at the Archives building turn right into Haxhi Zeka street. Keep going up the street, and turn left in the third street (Shkodra Street).

*Serbian Orthodox Monastery Gračanica - UNESCO World Heritage Site, located in the eponymous village (Alb. Graçanicë) 17 km south-east from Prishtina.

* was built by the animal welfare organisation Four Paws in 2014 and is located 20 kilometres from Prishtina near the village Mramor. The land has an area of 16 ha and includes seven open air rehabilitation enclosures for bears. The sanctuary is open for visitors from the months of February until December. Visitors can take walks through the sanctuary and see bears in their natural environment. Since summer 2018, an Environmental Education Centre enriches the visitor & education offerings of the sanctuary and provides insight into a wide range of topics surrounding local environment, nature and wildlife.

*Gazimestan. The monument on outskirts of Pristina built in Yugoslavia period to commemorate Serbian-Turk battle of Kosovo Polje in 1389.

Do

*If you like coffee, and have a massive amount of time on your hands, Pristina is the city for you. There are cafes absolutely everywhere, and most of them are packed through the warm season with fashionably-dressed young people, dropping a euro a day to keep themselves amused. Unemployment / underemployment is pervasive throughout Kosovo, and tends to affect people from all walks of life and different levels of education. Which means that dude in the sleeveless tshirt with streaked-blond hair at the table beside you could just as easily be an economist as a farm kid from Kamenicë, so learn to say "Mirëdita" with a passable accent and feel free to start a conversation. What to order? "Macchiato" (espresso with hot milk, similar to a latte). Most cafes have free wifi.

*Privately-owned outdoor swimming pools are springing up around Kosovo, some just outside the city and worth the euro to cool off in the summer. 

*Shopping-wise, Pristina is full of good bargains but low on selection. Silver is sold in the old quarter and is a pretty good value; Albanians are known throughout the former Yugoslavia as silversmiths.

*Do as the locals do: In Pristina, this means korza. In the evenings, when it's warm, a large proportion of the population heads out into the streets and promenades, between cafes or in with no particular destination. The objective is to see and be seen, chat with friends, and take in as much fresh air as possible before the horrific winter descends. Note that 53% of Kosovo's population is under the age of 25, so most of the people on the street around dusk are teenagers and people in their early twenties.

* Stay out late because the streets are safe and Albanians love foreigners. Also go out to bars and cafes, as they are usually filled but make sure you drink some "Peja" beer (Key word PEJA)

* For clubs there are Fullhouse and Duplex in Pristina which are right near the newborn sign. Good for dancing, usually play American hip-hop.

*Theatre venue with variety of cultural and artistic events, including theatre performances, concerts, exhibitions, International Jazz Festival in November and many more. This is a place to have fun 
*Being the poorest country in Europe, Kosovans struggle to afford nights out and meals in restaurants. Instead, they get dressed up in their best clothes and walk up and down the main street. Join them, or if you prefer, grab a beer or coffee in an outdoor cafe and watch them go by.

Buy
*The outdoor bookstalls adjacent to the Grand Hotel are a good place to pick up a copy of the Code of Lekë Dukagjini. Or a map of Pristina that most likely has names for all the streets many have never heard of.

*The covered market sells the small, distinctively-shaped enamel 'xhezve' saucepans for boiling coffee. They come in all sizes, from a single cup to an extended family coffee round and make great, unbreakable, cheap (from 1.50 euro) and authentic souvenirs

*There is just one antiques shop, 'Delvina', which is on Bill Clinton Boulevard (on the first floor of a block - visible from the street - at the junction with Bob Dole street where all the carwashes are, and where you can buy old (and some new) textiles, traditional costume, jugs etc

*Traditional silver filigree jewellery is still made in Pristina and is a light and very beautiful though not always cheap souvenir. There are shops selling old filigree on UCK street, and Krenare Rugovica's shop on Garibaldi Street, leading down from the Grand Hotel

*Women's microfinance projects are run by a number of NGOs, supporting women through handcrafts. Open Door has a shop in the shopping centre behind the 'Newborn' sign, and The Ideas Partnership sells its handmade olive oil soaps, tote bags and candle jars in the BioNatural Shop on UCK and online

*WiFi connection for free and good international-style food.

*Pinocchio, in the Dragodan / Arberia neighbourhood, which has excellent food and a warm atmosphere, as well as a panoramic view of Pristina below. 

For lunch, hit Te Komiteti on Qamil Hoxha street and have the gazpacho and chicken sandwich.

*As far as views go, however, you cannot beat Chalet Denis (up Dragodan hill from the bridge, toward Film City / KFOR). Friendly service and the best banana splits in Pristina, presented in a Swiss chalet-style atmosphere.

*For quick snacks, Aroma near Strip Depo and the ABC Kino and Metro across from the Grand Hotel have terrific sandwiches; Hemingway (in the road behind the large KEK building is the best bet for fish-fanciers, who should also check out Restaurant Rio near Gërmia Park; 

*Il Passatore is an authentic Italian restaurant, run by a real mama and her family. Go there in a taxi as it's a bit hard to find, but all the cabbies know it.

*Smart and upmarket bar/restaurant. Food is very good. Offers a mixture of international and local cuisine.

*Tiffany Pizza, directly behind Home, with an eerily simliar layout, features perhaps the best pizza in Pristina. The spinach pizza is highly recommended, as is the special Raki, all the way from Mitrovica. Another good pizza place is Margarita, opposite of main Police building, wide menu including fresh summer salads and tasty pastas are at your disposal. Home pizza "Margarita" is highly recommended. 

*Not to be missed: Pellumbi 

*If you are interested in trying some Albanian food (with possibly the best bread in the world), then head to Pishat restaurant, not difficult to find, but it's probably best to ask someone to point you in the right direction. Seriously delicious local food. Gets very busy at lunchtimes with Kosovan politicians.

*Fast Food Places and great food: Sarajeva sells Burek (5 locations), Aurora (across from RTK tower), Sarajevo (banjallucki qebab) also close to RTK and one behind the old Post Office.

For a really special meal, go to Renaissance. There are two restaurants near Peyton - one owned by a father and the other his son. Wonderful creative decor, no menu, no sign, so you have to find your way there as if you're going to a speakeasy.

Every taxi driver knows the location of most major restaurants frequented by internationals. Try a traditional qebabtore (you can find one anywhere), or a Turkish doner shop (best ones around the corner from Payton Place, near UNDP) for a real taste of the local food and great value. If you are a foreigner you may have to do a fair bit of pointing to order, but it should be worth it.

*Himalayan Gorkha, at Qafa Galery, TMK Street. Fine Asian restaurant. Pineapple lassi or Masala tea is a great non-alcoholic drink if you don't like beer, vodka or the local drink (Rakh rrushi). For starters there is chicken pakora which is nice fried chicken which tastes exactly like Kentucky Fried Chicken or vegetable pakora. Best thing about this restaurant is you can have both spicy and non spicy items. For main course there is Chicken Tikka with Roti or Naan. They also have Chicken Biryani, Vegetable Biriyani and Butter chicken.If you are fond of Chinese you can have Chicken fried rice and Veg Fried Rice. Meal for two will not cost more than €10 to 15 with drinks.

*Restaurant Ex, on Fehmi Agani. Friendly, English-speaking staff, varied menu including curry.
*Another restaurant in the Dragodan neighborhood. Serves pizza and other western dishes. 

* If you want to try traditional food of Kosovo, try City Bakery.

*Rron Restaurant is actually just outside the Pristina city limits on the way to Gracanica. Hidden behind an under-construction building for the past couple of years, Rron is a treasure that is popular with local and international politicians as well as the normal guests. The bar area is quite impressive with vaulted ceilings and shelves lined with all different kinds of alcohol all the way up. The far end of the restaurant has a plate-glass wall that looks out into the garden seating area which is lovely during the summer. There is a small playground for children outside on the far end of the garden which can make summer meals a bit loud at time when there are groups of children running around. 
*Its located in the city center, next door to restaurant Greca. The Thai food is excellent and its a clean and modern restaurant with a great atmosphere. There is a nice outside terrace in front of the restaurant too. They have free WIFI and they also have take away.
*Does Albanian and international fast food, take away or eat in, for low prices - e.g. a mixed grill which two people can stuff themselves on, €6.

*know for best cakes, in Prishtina.Famous for their independence cake 1.5 ton, Bill Clinton Cake when " ex.President of America Mr.Bill Clinton came in Kosovo".Fellini its in 3 locations in Prishtina , and its present almost in every event in Kosovo with their amazing cakes.

Drink
Cafes and bars are especially crowded on Friday and Saturday nights. Clubs open up and close down on an almost seasonal basis, but there are some reliable standouts, and neighbourhoods where something good is bound to present itself. In cafes, a good cup of coffee can be bought for under €1. 

* Miqt Pub is a nice pub in the city center. There's great music playing all day long, you can eat different food and you can play picado too. 

*Soma Book Station is a new coffee bar with different book selections. You can also eat at the place even though the food is a little bit expensive.

*Internationals gravitate to Zanzibar, near the ABC Kino cinema, and Strip Depo ('Strip' as in 'comic' not as in 'taking your clothes off') down the street from there. Places around the former OSCE, like the Little Cafe and Outback, are also popular. For the ultimate foreigner experience, down a pint at Phoenix Bar on a Saturday night with the folks from UNMIK, but be warned: if the idea of drinking and dancing with fortysomething long-term single expats in a downscale Yorkshire pub doesn't appeal, this is not the place for you.

*Hamam was rewarded as Best Bar Design from the World Interior News Awards (WIN) on November 28, 2013. It's a very cozy place where you can eat and drink while listening to live jazz.

*Crème is probably the best all-round bar in the city. It’s run for the amusement of the young, arty owners and not for profit, which explains the more-than-generous pricing arrangements, especially for the perfectly executed cocktails. Its five tiny floors heave on Fridays and Sundays with Pristina’s cool to the variety of beats.
*It's a beach in the middle of concrete! It's a very cozy place, a good collection of beers and rakia (local spirit/liquor), very good music and nice urban people. It's also the terrace of a nice hostel.

*Hot cafe districts include the strip down from the former OSCE near Tiffany's (especially Kaqa), the area at the beginning of Luan Haradinaj street across from KTA, and the student hangouts on Bill Clinton in Dardania.

Sleep
Accommodation can be very expensive in Pristina, as everything is tailored for internationals on expense accounts and hefty per diems. If you look around you should be able to find fliers offering accommodation. If you can find these place(s), go there as the cost is usually €10-15 per night.

Stay safe
The destination received high remarks from travelers, but it is advised to stay aware and be cautious at all times.

ATMs in central locations, even those belonging to banks, charge very high fees for withdrawals (5 Euro per withdrawal and up). Those fees are charged on top of what your bank charges, making the withdrawals very expensive. The fees are not disclosed before the withdrawal, and you will only know that you've been charged after seeing a receipt. Try to bring enough cash.

Don't visit Gazimestan in Vidovdan (28th of June). It's a day where Serbs use to gather there. There can happen some clashes. Don't provoke include in them. Never come here this day when you're drunken.

This monastery of the Serbian Orthodox Church is dedicated to the Assumption of Holy Virgin Mary, and it was built in 1321 by Serbian king Stefan Uroš II Milutin.

Monastery has a gift shop. Entrance is free.

*A day trip to or can be interesting. Buses depart from the bus terminal or you could hire a taxi for the day.

 

*Lipljan (Alb. Lipjan) is a small town located 15 km south of Prishtina, and 5 km from Prishtina Airport. In antiquity, it was known as Ulpiana, and there are still many remains from that period scattered across the region. The main attraction of the city are two Serbian Orthodox churches, located in the same courtyard, in Shen Flor Street. The old church, dedicated to the Presentation of Holy Virgin Mary, was built in XII century, on the foundations of an older Byzantine church building. Church's medieval frescoes are still well preserved, and there is also a peculiar stone iconostasis that separates the altar from the main nave (iconostases are usually made out of wood). The new church, built in 1936, is dedicated to Saints Florus and Laurus, saints from the II century, martyred in Ulpiana. One of the icons in the church is widely believed to be wonder-working, as tears have flown from the eyes of the Virgin Mary on the very day of the pogrom in March 2004, when Albanian mobs desecrated and destroyed many churches around Kosovo and Metohija, and expelled the local Serbian populace. Entrance to the churches is free. Lipljan can be reached by most of the buses that go from Prishtina to , or by taxi.
