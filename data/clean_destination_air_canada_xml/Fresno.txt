Fresno is in the of . 

Understand
Many visitors find themselves stopping in Fresno on the way to , , or other destinations in the Sierra Nevada mountains. The Save Mart Center at California State University, Fresno ("Fresno State") has also played host to concerts featuring high-profile acts.

Winter weather typically features highs around 60 degrees Fahrenheit, and "extreme" lows in the low to mid 30s, often with morning fog and sometimes frost. Rain fall is sparse and occurs exclusively in winter and early spring months. Most rain storms last less than 2 days and are often spread weeks apart. It is not uncommon to experience hail, however it is very rare to see snow fall on the valley floor. The few times it does snow, the snow rarely sticks over night. While winter temperatures can reach below freezing, most all storms feature "warm fronts" that more or less eliminate the chance for snow (mid to low 40s is a typical "cold" rain storm).

Summer temperatures average in the mid-90s. Days with high temperatures 110 degrees or above are not uncommon. Humidity is only around 20% in the afternoon, though, making for a more bearable dry heat. The chance to find 110+ degree days commonly occurs beginning late July and continuing to mid August. During these days the low nighttime temperature will only get down to the mid 80s. It is common for a heat wave to last two weeks.

Fresno's most famous son is the writer William Saroyan, after whom is named a local theater. The city has a large Hmong community.

Get in

Non-stop flights to Dallas/Fort Worth, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, San Francisco and even service to Guadalajara, Mexico. Flights to Los Angeles or San Francisco 

By train
Amtrak's San Joaquin route serves Fresno with six trains a day, running south to Bakersfield and north to either Sacramento or the Bay Area.

By car
Almost everybody gets to Fresno by car. The drive to Fresno takes about 3 hours from , 3.5 hours from , and 5.5 hours from . Coming from the southern Peninsula or South Bay, most people take U.S. Highway 101 to Gilroy, State Highway 152 over Pacheco Pass and through Los Banos, then State Highway 99 south to Fresno. From the northern Peninsula, one might take highway 92 over the San Mateo Bridge, to 880 North, then 580 East to 205 East to 5 North to 120 East to 99 South. From Los Angeles, take Interstate 5 north and State Highway 99 north. Fresno is accessible from the southern by State Highway 41, usually used with State Highway 46. Fresno is the largest city in the without an Interstate highway running through it, but 99 provides much of that function and is slated to be upgraded to Interstate status.

By bus
Greyhound terminal moved next to Amtrak station downtown Fresno .

Get around
As is typical in California Central Valley cities, a car is useful and often necessary to access most parts of town. There is a modest bus system, Fresno Area Express (FAX), but a car would be advised. Traffic congestion in Fresno is not as bad as larger places in California, but Shaw and Herndon avenues can get quite crowded, especially since there is no east-west freeway through the north side. CA-99 runs along the west side of the city, becoming semi-rural before exiting Fresno County on the northwest side of Fresno. CA-41 runs down the middle of the city. Until the late 1990s and early 2000s these were the only freeways in Fresno, but a surge in growth has spurred the development of the CA-180 and CA-168 freeways.

In 2011, Fresno became the first town or city in the Central Valley to earn a Bronze Medal Designation from the League of American Bicyclists, recognizing Fresno as a bicycle friendly community. The city is in the process of further expanding its bike lanes in an effort to improve bike access. For a current map of Fresno's bike lanes, follow this link.
