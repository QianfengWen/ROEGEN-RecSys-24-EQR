Do

Cooking classes
* Run by a simple couple in their house right next to the Tribute Restaurant. A place to go for some warm homely feeling if you feel homesick. You could easily spend an entire day here or visit a few times. Great place to experience many aspects of Indian culture - authentic home food, i.e. cooking class, the ancient Indian science of hand reading to find your life purpose, meditation room, spiritual talk, diverse types of tea, books reading, paintings art, etc. which are all interests of the host couple which they share with the guests. Food has been reported very delicious and healthy especially for European stomachs at very reasonable prices. Cooking class takes around 4 hours during which guests themselves cook multiple courses meal involving chopping, kneading, spice preparation, chicken tikka grilling, baking naan bread, presentation and other aspects in the home kitchen of Mrs. Sethi & later devouring self-cooked Indian delicacies. The hand reading is also genuine as Mr. Sethi has 30 years of experience in hand and fingerprint analysis has authored a book and has plenty of literature on hand analysis. It could be quite intriguing to experience how much this expert can tell about us by just analyzing our hands & fingerprints. With a large Buddha on the wall, ethnic decoration, soothing dim light lamps, Buddhist music, pleasant fragrance, etc. the place has a very peaceful, calm, and relaxed ambiance surprisingly in a house on a busy touristic street. Wi-Fi is fast & free along with the books offered for reading, unlimited green & mint tea and meditation room also can be accessed free.

Stay Safe
While Udaipur is generally safe for tourists, it is important to be aware of common scams which can be prevalent in the Old City. Be cautious of touts who begin friendly conversations and soon inform you of the upcoming Royal Wedding at the City Palace. Be assured - there is no such event, nor will it be attended by various celebrities from your home country. Their aim is to bring you to a tailor's shop sell you an overpriced outfit for the evening. Touts can be persistent and may follow you around, particularly around the Jagdish Temple and Gangaur Ghat. Hotel proprietors insist they are not dangerous, and there is no harm in engaging with them in friendly conversation, but also recommend you not reveal too many personal details or information about your plans/hotel, and to simply get into a tuk-tuk at any point if you feel uncomfortable.
