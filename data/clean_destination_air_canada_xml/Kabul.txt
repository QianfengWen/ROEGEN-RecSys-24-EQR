Kabul has been the capital of since about 1776. It is the country's only metropolis, located in the east of the country inside a valley with an elevation of 5900 feet (1800 m) above sea level. The city has been badly damaged during the various 1979&ndash;2001 wars, particularly its western parts. Kabul has since undergone through a period of renovation and development, with some modern style tower blocks and a handful of glitzy shopping malls appearing over the period. However, roads and other infrastructure remain in poor condition, and electricity is spotty even in the downtown areas.

Understand
.]]
Kabul is a very historic city of the region that was built almost 4000 years ago. People here are famous in hospitality. 

History
The city is believed to have been founded between 2000-1500BC. It is mentioned in Hinduism's sacred Rigveda text (ca.1700-1100BC) as a vision of paradise set in the mountains. It was an important center of Zoroastrianism and later Buddhism. The city remained of little importance for much of the first three millennia of its existence. It was controlled variously by: the Persians, Alexander the Great, the Seleucid Empire, the Mauryan Empire, the Bactrians, various Hellenistic kingdoms, the Sassanid Empire, and by the 5th century AD was its own kingdom known as Kabul-Shahan. This last kingdom before the Islamic conquest built a large wall to protect the city from invasion when the Arabs arrived at the edge of the kingdom; parts of the wall have survived to this day and are visible above ground within the city.

In 871 Kabul fell to the Islamic invasion (nearly 200 years after invading Muslims reached modern-day Afghanistan). The Kabulistan empire was formed covering much of Afghanistan and parts of western modern-day Pakistan. The city once again passed uneventfully through the hands of several empires, including the Samanids, Ghaznavids, Ghorids, Timurids, Mughols, Durranis, and the Barakzais, before conquest by the Mongols in the 13th century. The famous Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta visited the city in 1344, noting:
:"We travelled on to Kabul, formerly a vast town, the site of which is now occupied by a village inhabited by a tribe of Persians called Afghans."
Under the rule of Tamerlane in the 14th century, the city developed into a regional center of trade. In 1504, the city was captured by the Mughal emperor Babur. 

In 1747, Kabul came under control of the Durrani (or Afghan) Empire. In 1776, Kabul would become the empire's capital, although the empire soon fell into tribal civil war. In 1839, the region was claimed by the British and Kabul was established as the location of British government and the British Indian Forces. They were very unpopular amongst local tribes who revolted and in 1841. Within a few days, a series of events led to the massacre of all but one of the 16,000 occupying British and Indian civilians and soldiers within miles of Kabul as they attempted to flee to Jalalabad, a famous blunder known as the Massacre of Elphinstone's Army. The British returned in 1878 and 1879, but were both times thousands of them were killed and they were forced to retreat. 

In the early 20th century, electricity was introduced to the city and the Darul Aman palace was constructed for the royal family. The 1930s-60s were good times in Kabul. Kabul University was opened; the roads were paved; modern shops, offices, & schools were opened; shopping centers and a cinema were opened; and the Kabul Zoo opened. The city also saw a vibrant tourism industry appear, largely due to the which passed through Kabul in the 1960s-70s.

The 1970s-80s brought a turn for the worst. The city hosted two coups, in 1973 & 1978. The second coup was carried out by the Marxist PDPA, which a year later invited the Soviet Union military to maintain their power over the country. From 1979-1989, the Soviet Union maintained headquarters for military and government in Kabul. After the Soviets left, the government collapsed in 1992 and left local warlords to fight over the city leaving tens of thousands dead and (according to the UN) 90% of the city's buildings destroyed. By 1994, the city was without electricity or water. In 1996, the political movement known as the Taliban captured the city, publicly hanging the former (pre-1992) president and imposing notoriously strict Islamic rule over the country.

A United States led military force invaded Afghanistan in October 2001, bombing strategic installations throughout the city to rout out the governing Taliban, who quickly fled the city. The city was named the capital of the Afghan Transitional Authority and subsequently the capital of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. The city saw many suicide bombings between 2002-2007. In late 2008, control of the city's security was passed from the NATO ISAF force to Afghan National Police and the Afghan National Army. Since 2001, billions of dollars in aid and foreign investment have been used to improve the city. Most of the major roads have been paved and improved, government building have been extensively renovated, new hotels and shopping malls have opened, the zoo and many museums have reopened, and utilities have been extensively reconstructed.

On the 15th of August, 2021, the Taliban recaptured the city after a 5-month-long campaign, and overthrew the government.

Kabul is twinned with the British town of Didcot, for historic reasons relating to the railway.

Climate

Kabul's climate is greatly influenced by its location in a valley at 1800m (5900ft). Summers (June-Sept) are hot and dry, averaging from the high 20s to the mid-30s (80-95F) with next to no precipitation. Autumn (Oct & Nov) is temperate and sees very little precipitation. Winters (Dec-Mar) are cold and the time of year which sees the most precipitation (mostly snow, but also ice, freezing rain, and sleet on warmer days). January is the coldest month, averaging 4/-7 (39/19F). Spring (late Mar-early June) is temperate with lots of rain tapering off by early May.

Keep in mind that the city lies in a valley and some villages on the edge of the city are a few hundred meters higher and thus cooler in the summer and colder and snowier in the winters. Many roads leading to/from the city are regularly blocked by high snowfall in winter (although the city's importance to the US presence means they will be cleared relatively quickly), the most notorious is the highway north towards .

Orientation
The city of Kabul is divided into 22 sectors, each sector consisting of a handful of adjacent neighborhoods.

Get in

By plane

Kabul International Airport (), +93 9251-61001, is a short drive east of the city center. The new international terminal is now fully open, whilst the old terminal is now used for domestic flights. The airport is a hub for Ariana Afghan Airways, Kam Air, Safi Airways, & Pamir Airways. Airport facilities include banks, restaurants, post office and car parking (all very basic).

Arrival
Foreigners will need to get a foreigner registration card - after immigration go to the room with the sign 'duty free' behind the baggage carousel and complete the form - if you have 2 passport photos with you then you can complete the registration there. Otherwise you'll have to finish your registration at the Ministry of Interior later (a major hassle - best to make sure you have those photos). Registration services are also available at the Kabul Police station.

When arriving, taxis are available to the city center (Afs 400), but it is safer to meet someone whom you know. Alternatively, Afghan Logistics (+93-777 443311, see below in Get Around) and the other taxi firms offer an airport pick-up for about $25.

Departure
The Foreigner Registration card is sometimes required and taken from you when you exit Afghanistan, and a big fine / bribe is in some cases required if you haven't got it when you fly out, though sometimes arguing that no one was at the desk to issue the Foreigner Registration card will work. The registration card is free. Some people feel it necessary to 'tip' everyone at the airport when flying out, but tip one guy for putting your bag through the x-ray scanner and everyone will be on you for their share. A polite 'no thank you' usually suffices.

When flying out you will probably end up in Car Park C - and will have to get the shuttle bus to the terminal building. When flying out expect long queues and multiple ticket / passport / baggage checks, although things are now much better with the new terminal, principally because there is much more space.

International
International carriers and destinations include include:

* Ariana Afghan Airlines &ndash; to Ankara, Baku, Delhi, Dubai, Dushanbe, Islamabad, Istanbul-Atatürk, Jeddah, Moscow-Sheremetyevo, Riyadh, Sharjah, Tehran-Imam Khomeini, & Ürümqi.
* Safi Airways &ndash; flies to Delhi, Dubai, & Kuwait City.
* Kam Air &ndash; to Almaty, Delhi, Dubai, Dushanbe, Islamabad, Mashhad, Peshawar, & Urumqi & Delhi.
* Pamir Airways &ndash; to Delhi & Dubai. Now abandoned.

* Air India to Delhi.
* Pakistan International Airways &ndash; to Islamabad & Peshawar.
* Fly Dubai &ndash; to Dubai & Delhi
* Air Arabia &ndash; to Sharjah
* Gulf Air Bahrain
* Turkish Airlines Daily flights to Istanbul.
* Spice Jet New Delhi

Domestic
While Kabul International Airport is not bad for a third world country, expect very basic conditions at other Afghan airports. As of November 2009:

* Ariana Afghan Airlines to , , & .
* Kam Air to Herat, Kandahar, Mazar-e-Sharif, & .
* Pamir Airways to & Herat.
* Safi Airways to Herat,Kandahar, & Mazar-e-Sharif.

By car
* The highway from has been rebuilt, but travelling on it is very dangerous because of the Taliban.
* The highway from and the North via the is open, although one has to be careful travelling on it during the winter months.
* The newly rebuilt highway from is open which has reduced the journey time to 2-3 hours, however since 2008 the security on this road has deteriorated considerably.
* From it is advisable to take the longer northern route, as the southern route (through Wardak province) is of questionable safety.

By bus
Private operators serve most destinations in fairly comfortable Mercedes buses. Safety can be a problem, with frequent accidents.

Get around
Maps of Kabul are available from Afghanistan Information Management Services who can print out custom wall maps of the city. Open Street Map is the only online street level map presently available for Kabul. 
Currently Google has offered the brand new service or road map in Afghanistan. it is mostly reliable except it wouldn't have all details. Google Map

By taxi
Taxis are plentiful and to hire the whole car should cost around 100 to 300 Afg depending on destination and bargaining skills. Some drivers have learned basic English, but such drivers may try to charge a slightly higher price and are most likely to be found loitering near Westerner-friendly locations (airport, major hotels). While the city is fairly safe, it isn't a bad idea to be proactive and avoid catching a taxi near any sensitive location (embassy, military facilities, 5-star hotels). It is customary for women to always sit in the back seat. After dark local yellow taxis become a rarity, so keep a few taxi numbers in your phone as a backup.

By private taxi
You can rent a taxi for a day trip in Kabul or its surroundings. Depending on the destination the cost varies. For example day trip to Panjsher would cost around 2000-2500 Afs.

By car
There are only a couple places to rent a car in Kabul.

By public transport
There are shared taxis called laini (20 Afs per person, usually 5 people in the car - 3 at the back and 2 sharing front seat; if you're a single woman sitting on the front seat you may be charged 30 or 40 Afs instead) operating on different routes.
The mini vans called tuniz usually move around western Kabul (Karte 4, Kote Sanghi and Barchi) and charge 10 Afs per person. 

By foot
Downtown Kabul is relatively compact and walkable - a good option in the spring and fall - summers bring intolerable heat and dust, whilst winters bring snow and mud. Pavements are few, and you need to keep your wits about you when crossing roads. 

If you are nervous about your safety walking around areas such as Wazar Akbar Khan and Taimani (to a restaurant etc.) is fine day or night - central Kabul at night is walkable but be sure you know where you are going, and how to get back to your guesthouse. Given the volatile security situation always be aware of any demonstrations, gathering crowds, etc. which could spiral out of control quickly. Keep a low profile, wearing simple clothes and (for ladies) covering your hair with a scarf or shawl. It is also wise to vary your routes frequently to reduce the threat of kidnapping. People are generally helpful and polite if you ask for directions.

Be wary walking around traditional residential areas (eg near the city wall) - conservative Afghans are suspicious of anyone snooping around their house, and children may start throwing stones / setting their dog on you.

See

* The gardens surround the tomb of the first Mughal Emperor Babur. Though he had wished to be buried here, he was originally buried in , and later moved to this spot. Historically, the gardens have been visited by Afghans for picnics and lazy afternoons. There is a swimming pool, a small mosque for prayers and a small museum among other things.

* Built in the late 19th century, it served as a summer palace for Amir Abdur Rahman. Today, much of the original interior has been preserved, and the area around the palace has become a large park.

* Originally built under Emir Abdur Rahman Khan in the late 19th century.

* A park and market for females only but includes male and female children. It was designed as a place where women could sell their own products and merchandise directly, which cannot be done in areas where men do business, because women in Afghanistan are not supposed to deal directly with men who are not relatives. This park was created as an outlet for these women to sell their goods with respect to their culture. There is also a female run restaurant. The park is also a nice place for female travellers to enjoy the outdoors. Entrance fee 50 afghani.

* Where foreigners are buried in Kabul. There are also Memorial plaques commemorating those ISAF forces killed during the last few years.

* Originally built as King Amanullah's Palace in the 1920s, it has been destroyed in the 1990s but was completely renovated recently.

* On June 28, 2008, the body of President Daoud and those of his family were found in two separate mass graves in the Pul-e-Charkhi area, District 12 of Kabul city. There is now a small memorial to the deceased on a small hill, offering nice views over southern Kabul.

* The zoo is very popular with Afghans, and houses over 100 animals, albeit in relatively poor condition. China was once one of the main donors of animals in the zoo, but after the death of a few animals to disease and malnutrition, China has announced that there will be no donations until living conditions improve. 'Marjan' the lion, which was blinded by a grenade, was the main draw of the zoo, but has died recently.

* described as Kabul's lake district, only 9km from the city. Spojmai restaurant provides international cuisine. Swimming and boating are popular on the lake with plans for water skiing and jet-skis in the future. Spojmai Hotel joins the list of establishments to be attacked by The Taliban in June 2012.

* 

*A beautiful gallery in a charming old Kabul house that has been carefully restored. The collection used to have some 820 paintings and portraits but 50% have been looted or destroyed; the director said the Taliban destroyed 210 portraits. Most of the collection is of European and Afghan landscapes and portraits of famous Afghan writers and kings and a portrait of the French writer Victor Hugo. Well worth making the effort to see. The Sultani Gallery is attached, but the opening hours are a mystery.

* The National Museum of Afghanistan once housed one of the greatest collections of Central Asian artifacts in the world. A large percentage of the previous collection was looted in the 1990s during Taliban rule after the upper floors of the museum were bombed. Many of the early Buddhist treasures were destroyed by the Taliban at the same time as the Bamiyan Buddhas. Looted items still turn up around the world at auctions. The museum is open once again, with far more modest, but still impressive, displays of early Buddhist and Islamic artifacts.

* This is the site where King Nadir Shah and his son, Zahir Shah, are buried. It has been going through renovation since about 2005 and is still not completed.

* Paghman Garden is a very nice place with greenery and Kabul river is beside the garden, Its a tourist place with nice climate.
Afghanistans independence gate (Taq e Zafar) is located in front of Paghman garden.

Paghman Hill: its a tourist place at the top of the hill. former King Zaher shah made it for the enjoyment of local people at the time of his kingdom and now it is a nice place with a pool and greenery and nice view.

Do
* The largest family amusement park in the city. Located on a hillside south of Ahmad Shah Baba Mena in the far eastern part of the city.
* A pleasant hike with rewarding views over the city. The Kabul City Wall is still is pretty good condition, running west-east from Babar Gardens over to Bala Hissar (about 3 km in distance).
* Closed down in 1978 by the Soviet Union, it reopened in 2004 after a 25 year hiatus. This 9-hole course bills itself as "extreme golf with an attitude". The price is now US$50 for 9 holes and to be honest this cannot be called a golf course
* Afghanistan's first and only bowling ally.
* Primarily shows Bollywood or trashy action flicks, and the occasional American blockbuster.
* Open to the public on Tuesday afternoons and Fridays - football (soccer) with local Afghan guys, frisbee (with a collection of expats) and a 400 metre running track in comparatively green and pleasant surroundings. Free.
* Home of the Afghan football team. Just past the stadium is the mine museum as well as a road up the hill where you will find hundreds of Afghan men and boys flying kites on holidays.
* Home of the Afghan cricket team. Newly built in the last several years.
* There are a growing number of large indoor swimming pools in the city. The nicest is probably at the Serena, but is a steep $40 to use. There are also the Lajward Swimming Complex ($10) and the Nazari Sauna and Pool ($10). UNICA club's swimming pool ($5) is very popular, especially on Fridays when there is probably as much catwalking as swimming going on. The International Club (aka Maple Leaf) has a large and often empty pool ($8) but it is in a plastic shed rather than outdoors. L'atmosphere also has a pool, again popular on Fridays. Except in private or foreigner-only places, women should not wear anything skimpy (especially bikinis).

Buy

The Share-e Naw area has some shops. 

*The Kabul City Center, next to the park, has some very smart shops.

*Majid Mall is situated in Supreme Tower. It is the largest shopping mall in Afghanistan.
 
*Roshan Plaza has some quite respectable clothes shops.

*Chicken Street is famed for its tourist fare (carpets, carvings, knives etc) and pirated CD/DVD's.

*Chelsea Supermarket sells many types of western foods and products.

Normally you can find most of your daily needs and has high quality goods.

*low prices and the biggest shopping mall in Kabul you can find everything in a very low prices

Money

A few ATMs that accept international cards are scattered around the city, and most dispense both Afghanis and US dollars. However, credit cards are unlikely to work or be accepted anywhere in the city, except a couple of the top end hotels.

*Standard Chartered Bank is in Wazir Akbar Khan.Standara Chartered Bank is no longer operating in Kabul.

*Afghanistan International Bank (AIB) has a few machines around Kabul, including one inside the Kabul City Center shopping mall. They dispense in Afghanis and US dollars, however they are often reluctant to part with any cash and sometimes dispense old, ripped notes.

*Kabul Bank has many branches in the city. 

*Azizi Bank has many branches in the city.

*Western Union has many branches across the city.

*Money Changers &ndash; some people prefer to exchange their money for Afghanis through the local money changers that stand on the road. There is no fee to exchange money this way, but make sure you know the exchange rate before attempting this.

Eat

The once thriving restaurant scene in Kabul has suffered in recent years, and as of 2016 only a handful of places are still open. This has been due to the exodus of foreigners leaving the city, and the strict security rules for those who remain. In particular for expat focused restaurants do check if they are still operating before heading out.

Restaurants can crudely be split into 'places for locals' and 'places for expats' - with the latter having higher security, higher prices but not necessarily higher quality. Restaurants that are UN approved are particularly expensive. If you are looking for a place with a good mix of Afghans and expat diners the (dry) Lebanese, Turkish and Iranian restaurants are the ones to head towards.

Restaurants open and close with surprising frequency, so it is a good idea to check whether a place is still operating before heading out.

Budget

* Cafe, in the basement of Kabul City Center, Share-e Naw. Burger and banana drink for less than US$3.

Mid-range

The vast numbers of foreigners in Kabul has lead to the city being perhaps the best place to eat in the region, and in the mid-range bracket there are dozens of good places to eat for US$15-25 per person for an evening meal.

Drink
Despite being illegal, alcohol is pretty easy to find in Kabul's expat restaurants - buying your own supply involves befriending someone working at an embassy or military base, or dipping into the murky world of expat black-marketeering. Beer and spirits are available at UNOCA, but the selection is slim and taking it outside UNOCA compound is against the rules.

Sleep

Kabul is not a cheap place to stay, principally due to the costs of running a generator and providing security. The hotels are good if you are just passing through, however for long term stays opting for a guest house is more popular. There are several in Wazir Akbar Khan and Shar-i-Naw, often in Afghan styles. 

It is wise to look closely at the security arrangements for any of these hotels. Many, especially those in the Splurge section, have been attacked by Taliban or other insurgent groups. Always think about escape routes and safe places to shelter.

Stay safe

Kabul is generally considered one of the safer parts of the country as it is firmly outside insurgent control. However bombings and kidnappings remain a threat and are generally higher than the country's other urban cities. Avoid restaurants popular with expats and affluent Afghans as much as possible; avoid police and military buildings, as well as embassies of NATO countries and allies as much as possible. They are the most popular targets for bombings, mass shootings, and kidnappings. Note that the standard policy is now to not report kidnappings of foreigners, so don't think because you haven't read about any kidnappings recently that means they are not still happening. That said, there are tens of thousands of expats and visitors to the city and considering that only a small handful have been victims of such attacks, you should be vigilant but not afraid. Avoid walking after dark, don't loiter in hotel lobbies, and (for long stays and expats), vary your routes and timings daily.

Female visitors: Make sure you wear a headscarf before landing in Kabul Airport until you fly out. 

While visiting Kabul or any other part of the country, having any kind of social interaction with local people should not be a problem, Afghan people are traditionally very kind and hospitable toward guests.

Cope
Read the Scene magazine for restaurant reviews and all sorts of useful info. It is free, although street sellers may charge for it. There are many FM radio stations. However, the only widely available English language broadcast is from the BBC World Service on 101.6MHz. Tolo TV is perhaps the most popular TV station.
