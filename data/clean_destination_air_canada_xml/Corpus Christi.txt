Corpus Christi is 's largest coastal city and the gateway to Padre Island. While it isn't on the way to much of anything except itself (and the islands off its coast), it offers enough to fill a visit in its own right, or a multi-day trip from , , or . The name is Latin for "body of Christ".

Understand
Before there was a Corpus Christi, there was a settlement in the area by the local Karankawa tribe, and was a trading site for native people throughout the area. Early French and Spanish explorers came to the area in the 17th century, and by the early 19th century smugglers used the future site of Corpus Christi as a staging point for moving contraband into .

Corpus Christi is located south of the Nueces River, and so it was in disputed territory during the Mexican-American War. General Zachary Taylor camped in Corpus Christi for nine months as they established the Rio Grande as the southern border of the United States. During the American Civil War, the city was bombarded by Federal gunboats.

Visitors hoping to see remnants of Old Corpus Christi in their original locations might be a little disappointed, as much of the city was destroyed by the 1919 hurricane.

Climate

}}

While weather is an attraction in Corpus Christi, it can be very hot. Storms and cold fronts frequently miss the city entirely, leaving it hot, humid, and occasionally oppressive. Winters are very mild, with freezing temperatures exceedingly rare.

During the summer, it is usually possible to cool down a few degrees by heading closer to the water - but it will still be hot and humid.

Wind coming off the Gulf of Mexico is nearly always present, and is sometimes quite strong. This helps to cool visitors, especially at the beach.

All in all, visitors to Corpus Christi will almost never need a winter coat, and will frequently not even need a light sweater.

Smoking
Smoking is prohibited by city ordinance in any enclosed workspace, which includes restaurants and bars. Smoking in outdoor patios and seating areas at restaurants and bars may be allowed, depending on their distance from doors. Permitted areas will be designated by signs.

Visitor Information
* Corpus Christi Convention and Visitors Bureau 101 N. Shoreline Blvd., Ste. 430, 1-800-678-6232. The Corpus Christi Convention and Visitors Bureau has up-to-date visitor information on the area such as maps, bus routes and accommodations as well as activities ranging from attractions, museums and performing arts to nature and outdoors.

Get in
By air
* Corpus Christi International Airport (). Located within city limits, CRP is served by American Eagle, United Express, and Southwest Airlines, with nonstop flights to Dallas and Houston. 

Many locals choose to use San Antonio International Airport () , or Austin-Bergstrom International Airport (), located three hours by car from Corpus Christi. Frequent flights to many destinations make this a more convenient airport, even given the travel time from the airport to Corpus Christi.

By bus
* America's ever-present Greyhound bus service offers transportation to Corpus Christi. Travelers should be aware that there are two bus stations there. With few exceptions, tourists will want the main Corpus Christi station, and not the Corpus Christi West station, which serves western suburbs containing few attractions for visitors. Service from San Antonio takes roughly three hours and costs $35.

By train
There is no passenger train service into Corpus Christi. A train can be taken to San Antonio or San Marcos, and bus or rental car service will get you from those cities to there.

By car
By far, most visitors to Corpus Christi drive. The city is at the southern end of Interstate 37, about two hours south of San Antonio. It is also about two hours north of Brownsville and the Mexican border.

From Houston, taking US-59 south to Victoria and then taking US-77 south will take you through several small towns. US-77 connects with Interstate 37 just west of the beach.

Get around
While Corpus Christi is ostensibly laid out in a classic city-block style, the adaptation of that system to the local geography can make navigation a little confusing. Nevertheless, there are several main roads that traverse nearly the entire city, and these can be used to orient yourself if you find yourself lost.

By car
Most visitors and locals travel around Corpus Christi in cars. Most likely, a rental or personal car is the best way for you to see the city.

The main routes one needs to know to get around efficiently in Corpus Christi are I-37, South Padre Island Drive (TX-358), the Crosstown Expressway (TX-286), and Ocean Drive/Shoreline Boulevard (Ocean Drive is an extension of Shoreline Blvd. for about seven miles along Corpus Christi Bay). 

I-37 brings you into town from the west and ends on Shoreline Drive downtown on the Bayfront.

Shoreline Blvd. is a section of about four miles in downtown Corpus Christi along the bay. It begins in the area of the Art Museum of South Texas and leads south, becoming Ocean Drive. Following Ocean Drive takes one through the most scenic part of the city and to its end at the Naval Air Station and Texas A&M. 

South Padre Island Drive does not go to South Padre Island (a frequent mistake made by visitors), but is better thought of as the southern section of Padre Island Drive. It is a section of 358 running from I-37 down the southern side of the city from northwest to southeast and ending on Padre Island at Padre Island National Seashore. Along it is the main shopping and dining area for the city. Locals will invariably refer to South Padre Island Drive as S.P.I.D., with the letters always pronounced separately. Visitors should remember that there will not be signs reading SPID. Instead, many read NAS-CCAD (for Naval Air Station and Corpus Christi Army Depot) or TX-358.

Connecting the northern end of S.P.I.D. to the downtown area near where I-37 ends is the Crosstown Expressway.

The Harbor Bridge takes drivers over the ship channel from downtown to Corpus Christi Beach, a popular destination for tourists.

By public transit
Corpus Christi has a small trolley service (actually buses poorly disguised as trolleys) and a citywide bus service. Both are run by the Corpus Christi Regional Transit Authority, and schedules can be found at their website 

There is no Metro, subway, or any other form of a city rail service. 

Car rental services can be found at the airport or along S.P.I.D. 

Corpus Christi has a marina, for those few lucky enough to travel by water.

*Art Center of Corpus Christi, 101 North Shoreline Drive, Downtown.

*Corpus Christi has many small parks, such as Artesian Park, scattered throughout the city. For those into the paranormal, Artesian Park is another reportedly haunted locale. 

*The Bayfront is the downtown area along Shoreline drive, which is formed of concrete steps leading down to the water's edge. It is essentially the heart of Corpus Christi and is a terrific area for family evening strolls or running alone in the early morning. It extends over two miles from Magee Beach along the Marina and T-heads, past the American Bank Center (stadium/coliseum) to the Art Museum of South Texas and the port area. Vendors may occasionally be found here selling cotton candy or renting pedicabs or pediboats. Festivals such as Buccaneer Days and the Fourth of July celebrations are held here with fireworks being fired out over the water. Some of Corpus Christi's best known restaurants are located only a block away on Water Street.

*Corpus Christi also has numerous churches, perhaps the best known of which is the Corpus Christi Cathedral. Located on the bluff overlooking the downtown area, the current building has existed since the 1940s, but the "church" as a congregation, has existed since soon after the founding of the city in the 1840s.

Miradors
Miradors are small, gazebo-like structures found along the Corpus Christi bayfront. Inside each is found a small plaque commemorating some aspect of the city's or of the area's history. They are delightful places to relax in the shade while looking out over the city's downtown waterfront and Corpus Christi Bay. The name is from Spanish verb "mirar" (meaning to look) and means "one who looks (or watches)".

Beaches
Most visitors to Corpus Christi come for the water. The area has miles of warm sandy beaches, which are easily accessible, if crowded. Water ranges in temperature from the mid 50s during the winter to the mid 80s during the summer. Beach access is usually free.

Corpus Christi Beach, also referred to as North Beach is across the Harbor Bridge from downtown. While small, it is usually not terrifically crowded, and is convenient to other tourist attractions like the Texas State Aquarium and the USS Lexington.

Cole Park is on Ocean Drive, just south of downtown.

Most popular of all are the barrier islands located just off the coast. Mustang Island and Padre Island are less than 30 minutes from town, and provide plenty of recreation for visitors and locals alike. You can even drive your car on the non-Park beaches too! Please note one must purchase an annual permit to drive on the beach here (that can be found at nearly every convenience and grocery store nearby). Also note, that while it is possible to drive almost any car on the beach, it is advisable to drive no further than within a mile or so of the access roads unless the car is a 4x4 and can navigate soft, unpacked sand or risk getting stuck! Also keep an eye on the mosquito forecast especially if camping.
