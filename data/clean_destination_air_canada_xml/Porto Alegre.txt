Understand

Porto Alegre is the state capital of Rio Grande do Sul and the biggest urban agglomeration of southern Brazil. The perfect blend of Brazilian-Portuguese and River Plate-Spanish cultures, added to a strong European heritage gives the city a unique background within Brazil. The city is one of the richest metropolis in the country, the state capital with the highest life quality and literacy rate (97%), the book capital of Brazil.

The gaúchos are very proud of their land and culture. In 1835 a revolution which declared Rio Grande do Sul independent from Brazil broke out, the most significant national conflict of the Brazilian Empire (1822-1889), named the Farroupilha Revolution or Farrapos War. This war wreaked havoc across the entire state during 10 bloody years, killing nearly 20% of the gaúchos and ultimately leading to a peace treaty where the Republica Riograndense once again became part of Brazil. Another major Brazilian revolution also began in Rio Grande do Sul. The Federalist Revolution of 1893 defended the decentralization of powers and greater autonomy for the states, and only finished in 1895, after spreading to two other states. It was also in Rio Grande do Sul (Porto Alegre) where the 1930 Revolution which overthrew the president Washington Luis began, and so was from Rio Grande do Sul the most important Brazilian communist revolutionary of all times: Luis Carlos Prestes, who led the nation-wide communist upheaval in 1935. For such reasons, among many others, the Gaúchos (Riograndenses) are particularly proud of their mother state, many considering themselves as gauchos rather than Brazilians.

Currently, Porto Alegre is a service centered city in between the industrial part of the state (north-east) and the rural part (south). It is also called the "Mercosul Capital".

Getting in

By plane

Porto Alegre's International Airport is Salgado Filho (POA), located 4.3 miles (7km) from downtown. Flights come from and go to cities such as , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and It's served by all major Brazilian airlines ( Azul, TAM, Gol/Varig, Webjet, Oceanair), regional ones ( NHT and Trip) and international airlines TAP Portugal, COPA, TACA, American Airlines and Aerolineas Argentinas.

There is a train station (known as trensurb by locals) and bus stops near the airport. To get to the nearest station to the airport, take the "airtrain" (Aeromovel) connecting the main terminal to the train station from 5 a.m. to 11:20 p.m. Once you are in the train station, you can buy tickets and board the "Mercado" bound trains and drop off in the last station (Mercado) or in the "Rodoviaria" (Bus Station) station, either way you'll be in downtown Porto Alegre. Available buses don't take you downtown. Cab rides can be a little pricey, so you can opt to take a bus to a place near your destination and get a cab from there.

You will find two types of taxis by the airport. The red cabs are the usual cabs you find around the city. The white cabs service only the airport. The white cabs are regarded as more trustworthy, they used to be more expensive (some locals still believe they are more pricey, but nowadays they charge the same price as the regular orange/red ones). If you don't know your way around the city, it is more advised to take the white cabs.

The airport facility is modern (built in 2001) and has a shopping-like structure, with restaurants and shops. Be aware that Azul Linhas Aéreas operates only in the Terminal 2, that is a different building connected by a free shuttle service that departs from the second floor of the Terminal 1 (the main one) every 15/20 minutes.

By metro (rapid transit)

The metro system serve Porto Alegre and the metropolitan area . Locals call it trensurb, metrô or simply train with one line connecting Downtown to some metropolitan cities (Canoas, Esteio, Sapucaia do Sul, São Leopoldo, and Novo Hamburgo). The fare is R$1,70 and there's a station facing Rodoviaria (central bus station) and the airport. To get to downtown Porto Alegre from the airport, one must take the aeromovel (an elevated people mover that goes to the metro station -Aeroporto station) then the metro bound for Mercado station. It´s the best, quickest and cheapest way to get to the centre (Downtown) of Porto Alegre, as the ticket only costs R$ 1,70, the travel time is only 12 minutes (10 minutes by metro plus 2 minutes by aeromóvel) and there are 2 stations in downtown (Mercado and Rodoviária stations). Trains on the metro system run every day, from 5:00 am to 11:20 pm, every 3 minutes at rush hours and every 10 minutes most of the other times.

By car

Coming from the North (, , , ), one may reach Porto Alegre by two ways. BR-116 is shorter, but much more dangerous. This road is used to reach other destinations in , such as , and . BR-116 also connects all major metropolitan cities and traffic jams are frequent during rush hours in weekdays. The other way to get to Porto Alegre from the North is using BR-101 to Osório and then BR-290. The first connects , and , and is being upgraded to highway standards; the latter crosses Rio Grande do Sul from Osório to , through Porto Alegre. The section between Osório and Porto Alegre is called free-way by locals, and is a very well-mantained 6-lane toll-road.

Also, in neighbouring Canoas, BR-386 begins, connecting the metropolitan area with other major cities in the countryside, such as , and . It has 4 lanes up to Tabaí and it is in decent conditions.

From the South, coming from cities such as , , and , one would use BR-116.

From the East, Porto Alegre is reachable by BR-290 from and . Using this road, it's possible to reach southern cities such as and . This section of BR-290 shares a stretch with BR-116, from Guaíba's Bridge up to Eldorado do Sul interchange.

Be advised that some of these roads are dangerous due to their poor signaling/conditions and lots of trucks. Most of them are toll-roads and have electronic speed traps. Schedule your travels by car during the day; it is simply safer.

By bus

The long distance bus station is located downtown and is served by state, national and international lines. Daily services connects Porto Alegre with several cities inside the country and also , , and . It is also connected to a trensurb station and several municipal bus lines.

* Rodoviária de Porto Alegre (in portuguese). Information on interstate lines and schedules.

By boat

Besides its decent port facilities for cargo, a ferry service connects downtown and Barra Shopping Sul to Guaiba, a neighbour city situated across the Guaiba Estuary, known as Rio Guaiba. The crossing takes 20 minutes and costs R$ 7.35 each way. Checking the schedule beforehand is recommended. 

Get around

The city is roughly a semi-circle that expanded outward in a concentric manner, beginning from the historical city center, right next to the promontory and the harbor. Avenues going from the center to the outer areas of the semi-circle are the radiais (radials) and are crossed by avenues named perimetrais (perimeters). Hence, to go to and from downtown one will use mostly the former, whereas to go from one neighborhood to another, one uses the latter. 

 Metro 

There is a rapid transit system (operated by trensurb), which runs from downtown Porto Alegre to some cities north of the metropolitan area. There are 22 stations and 43km of line, plus 2 stations of the aeromovel (people mover, linking the airport to the aeroporto metro station). 33km of the line run at level and 10km run elevated. The first 6 stations (plus the aeromovel stations) are in Porto Alegre, and the others are distributed throughout the other cities. The line passes through important places, such as the Mercado Público, The Rodoviária (bus station) of Porto Alegre, The Airport, Farrapos Avenue (at farrapos station) and other sites of interest in the metropolitan area. Tickets cost only R$ 1,70 for any distance, trains run at high frequency (3 to 5 minutes at rush hours and 10 minutes at other times of the day), new trains have interior cooling, trips are very quick and reliable.

 Buses 

To understand the bus system, one must consider the above description. All lines are identified as "(prefix)-number name/neighborhood". Currently, almost all lines are radial, that is, they connect an outer neighborhood to the various downtown terminals. Those lines have no prefix. It is quite common to switch buses at downtown but, considering there is a myriad of lines there, it can be challenging to find the right terminal to hop on the next bus. Transversal lines (prefix "T" - T1, T2, ..., T11), connect different neighborhood without going through the downtown area, effectively eliminating the need of changing buses for the most common trips. Circular lines (prefix "C" - C1, C2, C3), as the name indicates, run in a circular manner, usually connecting parts of the downtown area to the nearest neighborhoods.

There is a map with all the buses online:


Also all stops are listed here:


Together with google maps this can give you a clue.

There have been some attempts to setup a more sophisticated website for describing the public transportation system. The official one, accomplishes this (if only to a certain extent): when you enter an address, the map will show you the nearby stops. You can do this again for the destination address, and see the routes that suit you the best. You can also enter one (or several) routes and they will appear on the map. An alternative site gained a lot of popularity in late 2012: It tries to turn the task into a one-step process, where you enter two arbitrary locations and it returns several options to make the trip. A lot of times, however, it will not be successful. 

Unfortunately, it is very hard to find bus stops with indication of lines' destinations or timetables. Hence, when in doubt, the easiest way is to ask the locals which bus will get you to you destination. Porto Alegre's buses are, in most cases, clean, safe and fast, specially when the line uses the bus corridor, a reserved lane with special stops in main avenues, effectively avoiding traffic jams. In order to use the bus, you must be at a bus stop and signal or wave your hand to the arriving bus you want to ride (they will not stop unless waved upon!).

The fare must be paid to the cobrador before crossing the turnstile located inside the bus. Fares may be paid either in cash or using a smartcard system named TRI. TRI-users get discounts in consecutive trips - currently, a fifty percent discount is granted to the second trip within half an hour. However to get your TRI Card you need to be a Porto Alegre citizen since you need a proof of living in Porto Alegre in order to get your card, you can try to borrow someone else's card in order to enjoy the discounts. Current fares are listed below:

{| class="wikitable"
!class !! fare !! remarks
|-
|infant || free || must pass under or over the turnstile
|-
|student || R$ 2,15 || must use a special TRI card
|-
|adult || R$ 4,30 || within a time limit, the second trip is R$ 2,15 with a TRI card
|-
|resident senior (60y-) || free || must use a special TRI card
|-
|senior (65y-) || free || any document proving age is enough
|}

 Lotação 

The Lotação is an alternative transportation system, with fewer lines, served by vans with up to 20 people in capacity, where one can hop on and off at any point (i.e. outside designated stops) of the trip. The fare is R$6.00 for everyone. The vans are easily recognized by their "red and blue" colour. If you're not sure if a lotação goes to the destination you want to go, just wave your hand, wait until it stops and FROM THE STREET ask the driver if it goes to your destination (for instance to go to Iguatemi Mall just say Iguatemi?), don't go in just to ask otherwise the driver might ask you to pay the fare since the counter is measured on the stairs near the door.

 Taxis 

There are plenty of taxis. They can be pricey, if compared to other towns, but they are also an easier, safer and more dependable option than buses in some cases. To ride a cab, one can walk to the nearest "taxi stop" (usually in crowded areas or points of interest), wave for an empty passing cab or call a tele-táxi service. Tele-táxi may charge extra for this service. The price of the fare is determined by a machine called taxímetro, usually in front of the passenger seat. There is always a minimum price, which is shown when the machine is reset for the trip, which is, as 2011, R$3,50. Next to the value, there is a "flag" indicator that shows the level of price being paid, always according to the service. Usually there is a table inside of the cab explaining each level of service. It is recommended to check if the correct level is being charged in the beggining of the trip, in order to avoid problems when you reach your destination. UBER and Cabify are also available, cheaper and better than regular taxis.

 Walking 

Walking around is a reasonable idea only inside a given neighborhood or downtown, as opposed to from one neighborhood to another, as they are usually too far apart. Walking during the night in most parts of the city is outright dangerous. During the day, it is recommended to pay attention to your belongings at all times, due to activity of pickpockets and other thieves. Avoid parks at night. Porto Alegre is a dangerous city at global levels. Be advised that pedestrian crossings, most of the time, are completely ignored by the vast majority of drivers; never rely on them without looking or making sure the driver will stop. It is also not recommended to cross the street outside the proper crossing areas in traffic jams: motorbike riders usually split between stopped cars, causing a great risk to pedestrians.

Stay safe

At any time:
* avoid poor areas, which present some risk of violence due to socioeconomic contrasts (see a map here)
* watch out for pickpockets within the Historic Centre, particularly on rua dos Andradas (also known as rua da Praia) and near the bus station &mdash; watch your backpack, pockets and wristwatch

After sunset, you should stay away from:
* very dangerous hard drug dealing spots, which include (as of October 2013):
** the inside and the surroundings of Farroupilha park (also known as Redenção park, the largest drug dealing spot of the city)
** (Historic Centre) near the UFRGS Centro university campus (right next to Farroupilha park), particularly along rua Sarmento Leite and under Imperatriz Leopoldina viaduct and its tight poorly-lit foot passages
** (Historic Centre) a crackland at rua Marechal Floriano Peixoto between Salgado Filho and rua Riachuelo
** (Historic Centre) Praça Conde de Porto Alegre, which sits right between the former crackland and Farroupilha park, and perhaps also the nearby parks Praça Raul Pilla and Praça Argentina
** (Historic Centre) Conceição tunnel and under Conceição viaduct
** the surroundings of the Police Palace (Palácio da Polícia) police station, at avenida Ipiranga and avenida João Pessoa 
* reasonably dangerous drug dealing spots, which include:
** the southern unlit half of Marinha park
** Harmonia park (officially called Maurício Sirotsky Sobrinho park): surveilled but there may be some spillover from Marinha park
* the red light district on rua Voluntários da Pátria (from the Historic Centre up to and including rua Almirante Barroso due to pushy prostitutes and some drug dealing

Because not many Brazilians report crime to authorities, it is recommended that you check this live, informal, self-reported crime map. Please note that poor areas seem empty (thus, safer) due to fewer Internet users.

Generic strategies to avoid dangerous situations (works in any Brazilian city and abroad):
* when dealing with beggars:
** fake sincerity to prevent startling the beggar (which may well be a drug user): smile condescendingly and say you don't have any money and that you're sorry for that (know the basic Portuguese phrases to handle this swiftly)
** to reduce chances of an assault, start/keep walking and don't get pulled into a dialogue with the beggar
* when being followed: most stalkers will scatter if you simply keep calm and walk towards/through highly lit and open areas with lots of people

Other generic precautions include avoiding empty shady areas if alone, discreetly paying attention to nearby people on the streets and avoiding being ostentatious. That is, unless you see people doing the same, use expensive electronics unobstrusively when surrounded by many people (such as in bus stops) and avoid wearing expensive jewelry and clothes. This is particularly important if you visit a poor neighbourhood. If you need to do so, it is safer to bring a friend, preferably a city resident you trust, and blend in: wear bland casual clothes, leave valuables at your accommodation (you may bring a basic phone for emergency), avoid English and even Portuguese if your accent is not perfect, walk confidently (know where to go without a map) and avoid obviously tourist behaviour such as opening a map in a visible spot. Fortunately, in the South of Brazil many racial types are well mixed &mdash; if you look European, Arab, African, Indigenous (native) or Asian (or anything in between) you are unlikely to be identified as a tourist based solely on physical appearance. This is not the case for people with strong Indian (South Asian) features, which are rare anywhere in Brazil. People with a strong East Asian look are rarely seen in poorer neighbourhoods and may draw some attention there.
