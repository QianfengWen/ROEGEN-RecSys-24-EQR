Understand

The 1931 Napier earthquake and subsequent fire destroyed much of the downtown business area. When this area was rebuilt, it was reconstructed in the prevailing Art Deco style. Now it is the Art Deco capital of the world. The demolition rubble was dumped along the eastern foreshore and turned into gardens and a recreational reserve.

The earthquake also raised the land by several meters. The airport and low-lying land in the industrial land of Onekawa and Pandora, and the suburbs of Pirimai and Tamatea were previously estuary. Some of the streets in the area have retained the names they had when they were on the coastline - streets called a quay or a bay may be inland now.

The nearby township of has the region's oldest and most famous wineries that host concerts during the summer seasons.
