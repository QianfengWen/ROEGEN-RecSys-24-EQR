Fortaleza is a major city on 's northeast coast, and the capital of state.

Understand

Fortaleza is one of the largest cities in Brazil (about 2,5 million and certainly one of the most vibrant. Temperatures range from 23-31 C with rare exceptions. July - November has virtually no rain. February - May can have its share, but mostly at night. The last years the city has seen an increase of crimes (ranging from petty to violent), so stay alert when wandering away from Beira Mar and other public areas, especially after dark. Despite being quite a party town, the carnival in Fortaleza is rather feeble, although growing bigger by the year, with the largest parades being Maracatu-style.

The official history of Fortaleza as a permanent settlement dates back to the 17th century, when the Dutch had a brief dispute with the Portuguese over the territory. However some local historians fiercely defend the thesis that the very first European to land in South America -allegedly the Spaniard Vicente Yáñez Pinzón- did so where the city's port is situated today, in January 1500, i.e. a few months before Portuguese Pedro Alvares Cabral's much celebrated arrival in .

Probably the most proudly remembered occasion of local history was the abolition of slavery in 1884, four years ahead of Brazil as a whole. The mulatto Dragão do Mar, native of , reached a near-mythical status for his role in the boycott of slave ships starting in 1881, and is still widely recognized.

The author José de Alencar is so important for the identity of the city of Fortaleza (and also the state), that its inhabitants are nicknamed Alencarinos. He eagerly discussed the origins of the people, languages and geographical names of the region. Most important in this context is the novel Iracema, with its renowned main character lending her name to several neighborhoods and inspiring statues around town.

In Brazil, Fortaleza is also known for its crop of comedians and the forró music and dance, all gaining popularity countrywide. The city is perhaps the most popular domestic package tour destination, and Europeans are following suit. Sadly, the latter comes with its share of holiday prostitution.

Several municipal tourist information offices around, the most convenient being at the airport, the and Beira Mar(Half way between McDonald's and the fish market).

Get in
By air
The modern terminal building of the international airport Pinto Martins (Telephone +55 85 3392 1200) was opened in 1998. An extension of the same size should be ready by 2014. Services here include , post office, , internet cafe, tourist information and travel agencies. fly to almost every major city in Brazil and also other capitals of , mostly via . Today's flights can be checked online

Direct flights to Europe:
* Daily to by TAP
* Weekly to , via with TUIFly often cheaper if bought at FlyBrazil

Other international flights:

* To via every Sunday by TACV.

* The Miami route keeps opening, closing and reopening again. Delta is currently having their go. Otherwise the direct route from Manaus is an alternative to Sao Paulo.

Allow at least an hour for immigration control if you fly in from abroad. Double it if there is another international flight shortly before yours.

There is an urban bus 404 Aeroporto/Benfica which runs frequently between the airport and the center, where you can find buses to virtually anywhere in Fortaleza (Not recommended at night). This bus also stops at the main bus station. Going to the urban beaches can either be done this way, or by crossing the parking lot(keep slightly to the right) and the highway (somewhat on your left) and catch the 027 Siqueira Papicu/Aeroporto, which will take you pretty straight to Praça Portugal/Shopping Aldeota in 25 minutes, traffic allowing. (Not recommended at night) From here you can either walk some 7 blocks along Avenida Desembargador Moreira to the beach of Meireles, or you can wait for Circular 1 which passes within a block of most hotels in Meireles and Praia Iracema. Reverse this process (Start with Circular 2) to get to the airport, which is slightly easier as the bus then stops right in front of the terminal, and not on the highway.

There's now a direct bus connecting airport to Beira Mar/Praia de Iracema (the main beach). It's R$ 10,00, runs between 6.30-22.30. Bus 917 Aeroporto/Beira-mar

There are two types of taxis, follow the signs: Airport taxis are more expensive, and have fixed prices. Most tourist areas fall within the most expensive zone, charging R$ 32,40 (R$ 48,60 on ). Regular taxis offer just about the same comfort, and run on the meter, stopping at about R$ 25 (R$ 40 rate 2) to Praia de Iracema or Meireles. Bargaining is tough out here, but fairly easy in the opposite direction.

By bus
The main bus station (Telephone +55 85 3230 1111) has buses to most all of the country, often via connections. Expresso Guanabara has the most extensive network from here, and also sells tickets near Beira Mar: Loc Autos, Av. Abolição 1840 and Bem Estar Tur, Rua Tabajaras 580. 
Note that most lines within the state of Ceará have their last coach leaving around 6-7 PM. Buses to neighbouring towns, within some 100 km, often leave from the train station in the centre.

* To 8 times daily (3 of these stopping in ) by Nordeste and Guanabara R$ 35-150, 6-8 hours.
* To daily at 7 PM by Itapemirim R$ 190. 22 hours.

Taxi to Beira Mar is about R$ 15 and 10-15 minutes. The bus 099 Siqueira - Mucuripe / Barão de Studart (on Sundays this line is substituted by 078 Siqueira - Mucuripe, bus stop around the corner) will take you the same place in around 25 minutes, -right from the doorstep of the bus station! If you are heading for Praia de Iracema (or anywhere else west of Av. Barão de Studart), take two lefts from the bus station's main entrance, then cross the street, and take the bus 073 Siqueira - Praia de Iracema. The bus 404 Aeroporto - Benfica takes you to the airport in less than 15 minutes.

A second, smaller bus station is in the western suburb of Antonio Bezerra(1,2 km down the road from the urban bus terminal with the same name). Most all lines here are en route between the main bus station and western Ceará (such as or . Access from Av. Desembargador Moreira by bus 076 Conjunto Ceará / Aldeota in about 40 minutes.

A third bus station opened early 2010 in the southern suburb of Messejana (next to the urban bus terminal with the same name), and has lines by the companies São Benedito (for ), Fretcar and Expresso Guanabara mostly en route between the main bus terminal and the southern and eastern parts of Ceará.

Get around
Orientation
Most tourists will not go more than 5 blocks from the sea, except for the airport and bus station, and perhaps a shopping mall. The following main streets will take you from the city centre to the fish market, by way of and the Iracema and Meireles, totalling some 6 km: Avenida Almirante Barroso, Av. Beira Mar (until Rua Ildefonso Albano, where it's cut off by an artificial beach -the aterro.), Av. Historiador Raimundo Girão, Av. Beira Mar (from Av. Rui Barbosa). This last three km section of Beira Mar (literally Sea Side) is by far the most attractive part of the city, with police stands and patrols making it fairly safe around the clock, although rather deserted from midnight to dawn. From the fish market, where the Avenida Beira Mar with its broad pavement stops, to the beach of Praia do Futuro is the port area, backed by a refinery and slums. Walking here at daytime can be risky, -at night it's asking for trouble.

Uber
Uber is really the way to get around now. Minimum fare is roughly U$1.50. From the airport, it's about 25 Reais (U$6-$7) to get into the city. Even if you go an hour outside the city, it still only costs under U$30. 

Traveling by car, even for short distances especially at night, is probably the most effective way to avoid crime. Taking Uber is a very cost effective way of doing that.

By subway
Many years in the planning, and quite some time under construction, always halted by budget quarrels, Metrofor promises to take you there and back in no time. Whenever it will be operational.

By bus
As any major Brazilian city, Fortaleza can be done almost entirely by bus Ticket price is R$ 3,40 (rare exceptions, like Sundays at R$ 3,20), and if you get off at a terminal you can change lines without paying again. Most lines run 7 days a week 0500-2300, give or take. The lines listed here, deemed most useful for tourists, will run roughly every 10 minutes daytime weekdays, frequencies perhaps halved nightime and weekends, and down to once an hour after midnight. Only the most useful parts of the routes are described. Some lines have the number 1 or 2 after their names, only to indicate direction, others don't. I.e. the very same bus with the same number and name could be running either from A to B, or from B to A. Ask!

* Centro/Beira Mar Caça e Pesca is comfy and air conditioned. It runs Beira Mar and all along Praia do Futuro. Returning it swaps Beira Mar for Abolição. This bus can get very packed from Praia do Futuro before sunset. Risk of muggings at Praia do Futuro bus stops after dark.

* Circular 1/2 - 24 hours!!! City center - Mercado Central - Dragão do Mar - Historiador Raimundo Girão - Abolicão - Desembargador Moreira/Shopping Aldeota.

* Grande Circular 1/2 - 24 hours!!! City Centre - Dragão do Mar - Historiador Raimundo Girão - Abolição - Praia do Futuro - Terminal Papicu - Shopping Iguatemi.

* Centro Iguatemi - R$ 3,00. Last bus leaves Iguatemi at 2200, does not run on Sundays. Comfy and air conditioned. City centre - Monsenhor Tabosa - Abolição - Desembargador Moreira (Shopping Aldeota), leaves you inside the Iguatemi shopping mall.

* 917 Aeroporto Beira Mar - R$ 10,00 - Express bus from airport to Beira Mar, passing through Monsenhor Tabosa shopping street.

A slowly increasing number of buses, although this far none belonging to the above mentioned lines, are monitored in real-time and you can check how far your bus is from your stop. 

By taxi

All 4000-odd taxis in town run on the same meter system except the special cabs at the airport. Start price is R$3,62, then R$1,81 per km on rate 1 and R$ 2,72/km on rate 2. The latter is charged every day from 20:00 to 06:00, Saturdays also from 13:00 to 20:00 and all Sunday, public holidays, and the whole month of December. Waiting is charged R$ 18,10 per hour.

It is mandatory for taxis to display the fare system on one of the rear side windows. Do not take a cab without such a posting.

Cab drivers in Fortaleza are fairly honest, although a few will put the meter on rate 2 too often. The meter should always run unless you have fixed a price before getting into the car. Most trips that would exceed R$ 10 on the meter are negotiable, and when you pass R$ 30 on the meter a discount of up to 50% could be obtained if you bargain well. Taxi stands are abundant but it can often prove easier to negotiate if you hail one off the street.

Average bargained prices to out-of-town-destinations:
* Cumbuco R$ 80 return same day.
* Canoa Quebrada R$ 150.

By moto taxi
Depending on the traffic flow, this can be a rather scary experience. In general about half the price of a cab, starting at R$ 4 for runs up to ten blocks or so.

Rental car
Brazilian city traffic makes this option a bit frustrating for anyone who honks less than once a minute while driving back home. The city is best covered by bus and cab, but a car can make many daytrips to outlying beaches. Rental shops are virtually everywhere. Despite huge signs claiming low prices, you will hardly end up paying less than R$ 60 for the most basic car, -plus fuel. Beach buggies start at R$ 100.

By bicycle
You can rent bikes in Fortaleza. 

Recently the municipality made roads for cycling and they covered a good part of the city. You can try to download their app and rent a bike from the spots located throughout the city.

See

Quite an effort has been put into restoring colonial architecture over the last years. Still there is no area that is completely "clean", but the stretch from the beachfront of Praia de Iracema, via Dragão do Mar and to Praça do Ferreira is steadily improving and worth a walk.
*History Train and Step-by-Step History are two free tours offered on alternating Saturdays in the city centre. Show up at Banco do Nordeste, Rua Floriano Peixoto 941, at 1:15 PM. Both last about 3 hours. Basic Portuguese is a must.
*Praça do Ferreira is the main city square, with stores, restaurants, a movie theater and plenty of benches.
*Praça José de Alencar has plenty of greenery and is the place to catch the city's best street performers.
*Theatro José de Alencar on the south side of the above square. The architectural landmark of the city, finished in 1912, has performances almost every evening. Visits every hour on the hour, except noon. R$ 4, 30 minutes.
* The Drag&atilde;o do Mar culture center, opened in 1999, has an art museum, a library, a cinema and surrounding .
* Museu de Arte e Cultura Popular, Rua Senador Pompeu 350, centre. Located in an old prison, now the Centro de Turismo, along with a handicraft market and a tourist information. Displays many fine examples of folk art as well as boats and other cultural relics.
*The sunset, either from Ponte Metalica, Praia Iracema, or the beach by the fish market, Mucuripe.
* Parque Ecologico do Cocó, the city's largest green area, near the Iguatemi-mall. No lawns, but a nice walk in the woods.
*Cathedral, city centre. The closer you get, the worse it looks, with a parking lot and all. But it still has nice mosaics. French architect George Mounier allegedly was inspired by the cathedral. Note the 40 year span between the initial works and the inaugural mass, above the main entrance.
* Museu do Ceará, Rua Sao Paulo 51, one block north of Pr. do Ferreira, centre. In a late 19th-century seat of state government. Explains the history of the state of Ceará and its capital. Free entry.
* Some 60 cars on display, mostly of US make, ranging from 1917 to 1995(!). Notably two funeral cars from the 30's.
*This mansion, built in 1925 as Vila Morena, and later used as a casino, a restaurant(when its current name was applied) and a rather political bar, is of peculiar architecture. It was virtually rebuilt in the 90's, and is undergoing another refurbishment to be used for public cultural arrangements.
*This former meat market was imported piece by piece from Europe and set up in 1897. Refurbished and now used as a handicrafts fair.
*More cute than really interesting, this tiny museum has about 25 scale models of Fortaleza's colonial buildings, and also a couple of scale landscapes.

The monthly listing Olheiro can be found in the receptions of most large hotels.
Urban beaches
 

There are two nice city beaches, Praia de Iracema and Meireles. Some people discourage bathing here, although they are mostly rated green by authorities (see ). The whole stretch from the Ponte Metálica (aka Ponte Inglesa) pier to the fish market is paralleled by the Avenida Beira Mar, very nice for an evening stroll. A string of shacks line the beachfront, mostly good for drinking and people watching. Some of these, particularly when serving in the sand, have up to three different menus with varying prices. Sunbeds can be charged up to R$ 30 a day, although the real price is R$ 3-5. A selection listed from west (Praia de Iracema) to east (Fish market):
*Babagula, more sandwiches, playground for children. Subway is cohabiting.
*Satéhut, Dutch run with some Indonesian on the menu. Clean toilet!
*Veraneio, the hedges protect you!
*Joca, Gay.
*Beira Mar Grill, decent food.
*Volta da Jurema, near Othon Palace. Nice sunset.
*G2, a notch cheaper than the rest.

The most attractive urban beach is Praia do Futuro, about 5 km ( to walk) from Meireles. Windy, with rather strong currents and undertows, swimming can be a challenge, but for a dip it's fine. Some 150(!) beach shacks, here a selection from north (closest to Beira Mar) to south, with their special features:
* Marulhos. Reggae music and good food. Try the escondidinho.
* Croco Beach. Plenty gringos. "After Beach" with live music on Sundays, sunset to eightish, no forro! Taxi drivers get a R$ 2 commission for each head they land here, -get a discount on the fare!
* Sorriso do Sol. Reggae and cannabis.
* Vira Verão. Young Brazilian crowd. If you're lucky, you'll get a table.
* Vila Galé. Belongs to the hotel. Perhaps the neatest appearance, definitely the most expensive!
* Chico do Carangueijo. Clean, popular, good food, specializing in crab, sometimes live music. 
* Côco Beach and Boa Vida. Mainly foreigners and their crew, live forro.

At the very end of Praia do Futuro its name changes to Caça e Pesca. Freshwater swimming in a strong current where the river Cocò meets the ocean.

Surfing
There is good surfing on the beaches, and frequent competitions at Praia do Futuro.

* is a surf school working at Meireles Wednesday - Sunday afternoons, R$ 17-35 an hour, including board rent.

* Offers surf lessons and surf trips every day of the week. Based at . 

Kite and Wind Surfing
Good conditions most of the year, with winds up to 40 knots.
*Equipment (Naish dealer) and classes. Helpful with info about out-of-town spots.
Schooner cruises
A couple of motorized schooners and a catamaran do similar 2 hour cruises along the city beaches at R$ 30 per person, setting out daily at 10:00 and 16:00 from near the Iracema-statue, where they also have their ticket booths. The latter time is better, as you get the sunset. Bring swim-gear. Minimum of ten people required- often cancelled in the low season. 

Another schooner takes you all the way to Cumbuco at 09:00, lands you for lunch and has buses you back to Fortaleza before 5 PM. R$ 130.

* At there's a more alternative selection.

Festivals

Work
Job opportunities for travellers are scarce.

Buy
The state of Ceará has a large textile industry, and arguably the cheapest clothing in Brazil. Also the capital of hammocks, varieties of which can be found ranging from less than R$ 10 to more than R$ 100. Best place to buy is the range of small shops opposite the cathedral, city centre. 

There are handicraft shops all around the city, but the best places to go are the Feirinha da Beira Mar (Beach front fair, daily about 4 PM - 10 PM) and the Mercado Central (Near the cathedral). These places have a large number of stalls and shops, and competition drives prices down. 

* There is a very convenient Pão de Açucar round-the-clock supermarket by the intersection of Av. Abolição and Av. Desembargador Moreira. Although more expensive than most other shops, it has a good selection of groceries, including many imports, and also some fresh foods. Fresh sandwiches and pizzas until 8 PM.
* For a true abundance of fruits and vegetables, in addition to meat, fish and whatever else you could think of for your kitchen, visit Mercado São Sebastião, at the east end of Av. Bezerra de Menezes, 4 blocks south and 5 west of Praça José de Alencar in the centre. The earlier you arrive, the greater the variety.
* Behind a modest façade there is a vast selection of used books, including hundreds of titles in English (although much outdated) and a little something in many other languages.
* Has about 100 high quality (albeit somewhat pricy) English books, as well as an abundance in other languages, but mainly in puertogese. This is the biggest (and according to a local friend the best) bookshop in town. 
* Shopping Iguatemi The largest mall in Fortaleza and one of the best. Everything from C&A, to Zoompe and Lacoste. A huge 24-hour supermarket, large food court and the biggest cinema in town.
* Shopping Aldeota On Praça Portugal, seven blocks from Beira Mar, with a cinema.
* Shopping Del Passeo Near Shopping Aldeota, with a cinema.

Eat

The best concentration of restaurants in town is found in the Varjota neighbourhood, especially along Rua Fredrico Borges and its side streets, starting some five blocks inland from Beira Mar.

Thursday is crab day in Fortaleza, especially in the many shacks at Praia do Futuro. 

* For a cheap and good lunch, try Maciel Lanches at Av. Monsenhor Tabosa 1010, near the corner of Rua Ildefonso Albano, from 1045 AM to 145 PM. The normal mix of rice, beans, farofa and vegetables comes with some four different options, like chicken, fried or boiled beef, all fresh. At R$ 4 it includes a softdrink. Also has a few a la carte options and fresh juices.
*
Specialties are crepes and Açaí, also sandwiches, fruit juices, and salads. Hang out for local windsurfers and kitesurfers, especially after beach.
* Perhaps not authentic French, but a varied menu, including escargots, and a selection of wines.
* Parque Recreio Av. Rui Barbosa 2727. Open air restaurant with grilled meats, sea food and more. 

Three options for a rodizio (grilled meats en masse, watch out for expensive drinks and desserts):
* This is arguably the best value rodizio in the tourist area. If you are not too hungry, you can also pay R$ 22 per kilo. Tuesdays and Saturdays there's a stand-up comedian at 21:00, adding R$ 10 per person to your bill.
* 
* Is it worth it?

The state of Ceará is renowned for its seafood. Near the fish market are a couple of restaurants:
* 
* Hong Kong Arguably the best Sushi in Fortaleza. Also fried fish with stir fried vegetables, etc. Try the Barca - a 'boat' of fish with up to 50 pieces of your choice served on a bed of salad.

If you are a bit more courageous, buy your shrimp, lobster, squid, whatever straight from the stalls, and hit one of the nearby shacks to fry it for you. One kilo of mid-sized shrimps about R$ 15, R$ 3 for frying, -then plenty of beers!

There is bad, watery, plastic flavoured ice cream galore in Fortaleza, as elsewhere in Brazil. Try these for the real stuff:
* 
* 

If your accommodation has bad or no breakfast, most large hotels let you take part in theirs for about R$ 10-12.
*With more than 1,400 square meters of space, Hard Rock Cafe Fortaleza has more than enough room for you and your hungry friends. Located in the RioMar Mall in the Papicu neighborhood, the cafe is only seven minutes away from the Praia do Futuro. Open for lunch or dinner right at the main entrance of the mall, with an amazing selection of the city's live music on weekends.

Drink
Grab a chilled coconut from a stall at Beira Mar, starting at R$ 2,00!

Fortaleza is a forró-stronghold. Virtually any day of the week you can find a party with live music and this traditional dance, sometimes in quite modern variations (often referred to as forró universitário). On weekends you can choose from literally dozens of places. For a more genuine, tourist-free happening, you must move towards the outskirts of the city, paying up to R$ 30 by cab.

Traditionally, Fortaleza nightspots have their dedicated day of the week, like Pirata (below) on Mondays. So, when asking around for a place to go, always be specific on when.

For daytime drinking, which can be quite a party, specially on weekends, see the Beaches-section.

The downtown (Centro) area is surprisingly scarce on waterholes, which would be more than welcome after a hot afternoon's walking. An even more surprising exception is found in the recently (2010) refurbished park Passeio Público (officially Praça dos Mártires): A small kiosk with outdoor seating serving lunch and cold drinks. Daily until 5 PM.

* With Belgian and Dutch owners Filip and Marco, has grown into a kind of ex-pats hangout, good food.
Free WiFi. Occasional live music. 
* Mucuripe, Travessa Maranguape, 108. tel +55 85 3254 3020 Fanciest club in town, best on Fridays. Ticket normally R$ 25-30 (everyone pays "half-price", don´t be fooled by vendors on the street that claim that its R$ 50 inside.) Be aware that foreigners with Brazilian girlfriends often are turned back at the entrance. Enter separately. 
* Forró do Pirata on Mondays (in high season also on Fridays) in Praia de Iracema. A crowd of happy tourists (many domestic) dances to forró and axé music. Overpriced at R$ 35. Most large hotels have discounted tickets for their guest (and occasionally others), -ask in the reception.

The largest concentration of watering holes, very practical if you want to hit and miss and don't have a car, is at Dragão do Mar, Praia de Iracema. This area features refurbished colonial buildings, loads of open air seating, live music (sometimes charged), and happy hour beer. Fridays and Saturdays the party is everywhere:
* Café Santa Clara, Excellent coffee, some extremely sweet varieties, good bites, and extreme air-conditioning in a pleasant, old-worldly setting. Slow service, though. Tue-Sun 3-10 PM.
* The biggest party in town on Wednesdays, when it attracts mostly foreign men and a fair share of working girls. Also opens on Saturdays with a more mixed crowd. Live forro on a big stage and a separate eurotechno-lounge.
* Gay, trans, and more.
* Gay
* Famous for its Chope de Vinho (Is it wine or beer after all?)
* Informal, variety of styles, most famous for its Samba!! 
* Live music on weekends, dancing student crowd.

A smaller version of this can be found along Rua Norvinda Pires, and the neighbouring part of Rua Desembargador Leite Albuquerque, centering on the rock-bar Maria Bonita, pagode-neighbour Bebedouro and the more mixed style Fafi, plus a few more. Cobblestones calls for flat shoes! Thursday to Sunday. 

Another area of interest is Varjota, inland from Mucuripe. Plenty of bars and restaurants. Take Rua Frei Mansueto from Beira Mar, 5-10 blocks.
* Thoroughly decorated as a Ceará countryside joint, although the prices are nothing of the kind. Live classic forro. Good spot on Tuesdays. Mainly age 30+. Next door restaurant.

Many of the shacks at Praia do Futuro host parties nightime Thursday - Sunday.
* Biruta, Mostly electronica on Fridays.
Prostitution

Formerly known as the one of the Brazilian prostitution capitals, fortunately from 2002 onwards, with the various municipal administrations, the city has changed its appearance and now presents itself as a classic tourist resort, suitable for families and couples. With the closure of almost all the clubs and bars dedicated to prostitution,
the arrival of sex tourists has dropped drastically, so much so that tourism of this type has almost disappeared in Fortaleza.

Sleep

Reservations are essential in January, when Brazilian holidaymakers pack in. September-November and March-May have room for bargaining at most posted prices. Many hotels will immediately give you 30% off.

Most hotels are on the strip Praia Iracema - Meireles - Mucuripe, parallel to Avenida Beira Mar, and up to about 4 blocks inland. Categories are spread about, but Praia Iracema has most budget options. Many cheap deals can be struck at Praia do Futuro, but be aware transport costs and lack of security at night. 
Budget
Hostels
Charging up to R$ 40 for a dorm bed, hostels are sometimes outpriced by cheap single rooms in the same area.

* A stone's throw from the waterfront. With the city refurbishing the area, this looks very promising indeed.

* Also triples.
* 

* A brand new hostel that offers free breakfast, a swimming pool, bar and free parking.

Hotels
A number of cheap options in the city centre, but the area goes seedy and unsafe at night. Unless you have a car, and can stay at , your best cost/benefit is probably along Avenida Dom Manuel, between Av. Monsenhor Tabosa and Av. Santos Dumont -just inland from Dragão do Mar. Stick to the main street after dark!
* Hotel Passeio, Rua Dr. Jo&atilde;o Moreira 221, centre. A bit run-down. Singles around R$25. 
* Hotel Caxambu, Rua General Bezerril 22. Modern and well-equipped. Rooms with TV and A/C, singles R$ 25.

Mid Range
* Refurbished 2010
* La Maison Av. Des. Moreira 201. Small, conveniently located hotel with nice rooms and friendly staff. Singles R$100.
* Ibis Just up from Holiday Inn at Historiador Raimundo Girao. Convenient for online booking and cancelling. R$ 85 single, 149 double. Breakfast R$ 10. Wi-Fi R$ 12/day.

Apartments

A typical modern two bedroom 65 m2 flat, fully furnished and equipped 2 blocks from Beira Mar will cost around R$ 70 a day in low season, double in high. Monthly rates are about R$ 1200 low season, R$ 2000 or more peak. Mostly you have to pay electricity on top of this. Be aware that an air conditioner can set you back R$ 20 a day if you leave it running. Dozens of agencies.

Many hotels put "flat" or "residence" in their name. This mostly means that you can buy an apartment there, -typically 40-50 m2 with one bedroom and a tiny kitchen. Many of the owners will rent these out for a price substantially less than the one posted in the reception, particularly for longer terms. Monthly deals can come close to the R$ 1000 mark in low season, including linen change and cleaning. Ask the receptionsts for owners' phone numbers:

* 
* 

If you go for a furnished room with a bathroom (often no fridge or a/c), referred to as a kitchenette (often spelled "Kitnet", or anything in between), you will typically be charged R$ 3-400 a month in high season. Praia Iracema has most of these.

Contact
* Fortaleza and all neighbouring municipalities share a telephone area code: 85
*Internet is everywhere, with greatly varying comfort, hardware and bandwidth. R$ 3-4 an hour is an OK price in tourist areas-- any more is too much. If you go inland you can get down to R$1/h.
*There is a free Wi-Fi zone in the café of the 24-hour at Avenida Abolicao.
*Several post offices along or near Beira Mar: Right in front of the Praia Iracema church; on Av. Monsenhor Tabosa just down from Ideal Clube; a small booth almost in the sand in front of Clube Nautico; in the mall of Scala Residence.

Stay safe
Fortaleza is generally considered a not-so-safe city for tourists and has one of the highest crime rates in Brazil. The city occupies the number 7 spot on the list of cities with the most homicides per 100,000 people in the world (2017), the second worst for a brazilian city after , and also has the second highest number of homicides in the world after (2017). This type of violence though doesn't usually involve tourists and most have no problems visiting Fortaleza after taking some basic precautions. Some things to watch out are:
*Pickpockets - Pickpockets and petty thiefs are a major problem in Fortaleza just like any other city in the world. They roam the city center and the beaches looking for easy victimes in the face of tourists. Avoid carrying too much cash with you, use credit cards for most of your transactions if possible, and if you do put them all in different places. It would be useful to have a second purse with you in such cases. Always have a copy of your ID, passport or other important documents and keep your phone usage in public to the BARE MINIMUM. Don't display any jewelerry (thiefs have been known to snatch necklaces and earings right of people's ears and necks) and don't show your camera too much. NEVER leave anything unattended in restaurants or cafes and ESPECIALLY beaches. Be very cautious during the Carnival too. Take only what you need to with you and take special care of your belongings in street parties and late night bashes. 
*Public Transport - Public Transport is generally safe in Fortaleza. Be very careful of your belongings during the day in buses and avoid taking them during the night as incidents inside buses have been reported. One thing tourists should worry about are taxis. Always take official, licensed cabs. Do not get in any unmarked taxis, especially if someone has solicited a ride for you. Check with your hotel to identify the official registered taxi companies in the city and stick only with them to avoid any hidden charges or unpleasant rides. Uber and Lyft are also popular in Fortaleza. 
*Prostitution - Fortaleza is a well-known city for tourist prostitution. Men in particular are often the victim of drugging and robbing crimes by prostitutes, often using a sleeping pill to knock the guys out (unless they’ve passed out as a result of their own alcohol and drug consumption). Many hotels and residence buildings have a registry of late night arrivals, or at least security cameras that can catch a glimpse of the perpetrator. Get these details and then go to the police. Move fast, though, because the stolen cash and items will disappear fast. 

If you get robbed DO NOT RESIST. The problem with confronting your assailant is that you don’t know their physical or mental state, or whether they are armed. Often the best call is to hand over whatever they are asking for and let them go. Then immediately go to the nearest police station to file a report. It's not worth risking your personal safety for something that's ultimately material and can be replaced. 

Helpful - Tourist Police "Delegacia do Turista" at Avenida Historiador Raimundo Girao 805, phone 3101 2488, just by Hotel Travel Iracema (formerly Othon), Praia Iracema. Some English spoken. 24 hours.

Areas to be careful
As with any other city there are some areas in Fortaleza where the crime rate is much higher than in other districts. Some areas to watch out are:
*Cais do Porto and Serviluz slum - Fortaleza's Port Area borders a notorious slum called Serviluz which sits on the northern side of Praia do Futuro. DON'T bathe in the northern side of the beach (there is minimal infarstructure for such activities anyway) and DON'T enter the slum, or slums in general, for any reason. 
*Commuting between Praia do Futuro and Centro - Be careful when commuting between Praia do Futuro and the city center. If you're going by foot always go through the busy Avenida Santos Dumont and avoid areas like Papicu, Varjota and especially Vicente Pinzon which has a particularly high crime rate. After nightfall always take a cab or Uber. 
*Beaches - NEVER enter beaches after dark. They aren't necessairly dangerous but they are less safe than other areas due to being dark and desolate. There is a very high chance that you won't see a soul in the beach. 
*Suburbs - Like almost everywhere else in Brazil, the city suburbs host the highest amount of homicides, armed robberies, muggings etc. It's better to stay in the city center and avoid going anywhere south or east and take care when going west as mentioned earlier.

Stay healthy
As a rule of thumb, try to avoid drinking tap water. 
If you travel west from Fortaleza, into the states of , or further, Brazilian authorities recommend that you get a yellow fever vaccination. An International Certificate of Vaccination can be issued if you have the shot taken at the airport or in the city center. If you already have your booklet, and only need a new shot and the corresponding entry, this is best done at the medical center at Avenida Antonio Justa, one block from Pão de Açucar, weekdays 7 AM to 4:30 PM, free of charge.

As elsewhere in Brazil, some beaches in Fortaleza are not suitable for bathing, and conditions can change from day to day. On the day of your visit, check the map of the latest bathing bulletin (in Portuguese, boletim de balneabilidade) of the state's Environment Department (SEMACE).

Cope
There are plenty of laundries around. Those which charge per kg (mostly R$ 6-10) are somewhat cheaper than those which charge per garment. Your clothes are normally ready next day. There is one single self-service laundry: 
* Lav e Lev at Avenida Abolição just by the corner of Avendida Desembaragador Moreira. R$ 9,50 to wash a big load, then typically R$ 19 to dry it. Turns out cheaper, plus you have it all ready in less than 2 hours. Add R$ 1,50 per garment for ironing. Monday - Friday until 7 PM, Saturday until 2.
* Laundromat at the corner of Av. Abolição and Rua Paulo Barros washes and dries a small load for R$ 17, ready within 24 hours, often much sooner.

* Changing cash EUR or USD into BRL is done close to interbank rates, meaning that it's better value than cash advances on credit or debit cards. Many travel agencies exchange money, -you mostly get slightly better rates moving away from Beira Mar.

* For visa extensions and any other issue between a foreigner and the Polícia Federal, head to their office at Rua Paula Rodrigues 304, Bairro de Fátima, near the main bus station. Open Monday - Friday, 8 AM - 6 PM. Bus 099 Siqueira - Mucuripe / Barão de Studart to/from Avenida Abolição.

* At the premises of Emitrade. Bus 077 Parangaba Mucuripe to/from Avenida Abolição.

Get out
* In neighboring is the Cachaça Museum, hosted by Ypióca one of the country's most widespread brands. 
* A monument of slavery and liberation, with a nearby cachaça-destillery. On the main highway just outside , some 60 km from Fortaleza
* The Jazz and Blues Festival is a continuation of the carnival in , the weekend after.
Out-of-town Beaches

Any tour agency, and a number of pushers along Beira Mar, can offer you daytrips, and longer packages, to outlying beaches. The one thing they have in common is the price, -it's fixed in between them, and it's far too expensive. Oceanview is old in the game and has a site with prices. If you are a group of 3-4 persons, a taxi can mostly be negotiated for less. 

* is a small fishing village, grown into a kite-surfers' paradise. Fresh water lakes with swimming nearby. Dune buggy tours. Horseback riding along the beach. A traditional fishing raft, Jangada, gives you a postcard view of the coastline. Buses from Avenida Abolição R$ 4,50.

* is among Brazil's finest, and hence makes its way into any global listing. Buses (changing to trucks in )twice daily outside Praiano Palace Hotel at Beira Mar. 

* used to be quite rustic, attracting mostly hippies. Now it's slowly growing into a resort town. Can be done as a day trip (R$ 40, many agencies), but is worth a longer stay, particularly for its weekend nightlife.
* Some 16 km outside Fortaleza, at the beach of , is a huge water park with slides and other wet interactive fun, Beach Park Stiffly priced at R$ 120 for a day. The beach right outside the park is very nice, and although you pay nothing to walk in the sand, food and drinks are 2-3 times city prices.
