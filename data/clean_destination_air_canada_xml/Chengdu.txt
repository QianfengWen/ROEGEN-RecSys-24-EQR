Chengdu (成都; Chéngdū) is the provincial capital and largest city of in southwest .

Understand
 

Chengdu is located on the edge of the fertile plains of the Red Basin in China's Sichuan Province. Due to its agricultural wealth, Chengdu is sometimes called the "Land of Milk and Honey". The Funan river bisects the city, although boat traffic, common until the 1960's, has all but vanished.

The greater city area is now divided into 5 urban districts, 4 sub-urban districts and 9 counties, altogether home to more than 14 million people. Chengdu has the reputation as a very "laid-back" city that emphasizes culture and relaxation and as a result of this and much green space is ranked one of the most livable mega-cities in China. It is credited with a good nightlife scene and contains many new western style buildings in the large city centre.

Climate
Chengdu has a monsoon influenced, humid continental climate with much rainfall throughout the year measuring 870.2mm on average. Humidity is high year round. Winters are cold (the average January temperature is 5.6°C or 42°F) , however milder than these of the lower Yangtze, due to the Qin Mountains preventing the cold Siberian winds from entering the Yangtze Basin. Despite that, near-freezing lows should be expected during nightfall (around 3°C or 37°F) and periods of light frost normally occur in each winter. Hard frosts, with temperatures below -4°C (25°F) are rare, as well as the possibility of snow due to lack of precipitation. The lowest temperature ever recorded is -6.5°C (20.3°F). Summers in Chengdu are very warm (not hot) and humid, but not to the extent of other nearby cities, such as , and . Highs commonly surpass 30°C (86°F) and the very high humidity makes the heat sweltering. Highs above 35°C (95°F) are very rare and the highest recorded temperature is 37.3°C (99°F). The majority of precipitation falls between May and September, due to the effect of the south-west monsoon. Spring and autumn are pleasant periods and the best times of the year to visit the city. Chengdu is also one of, if not the, cloudiest cities in China with 24% possible sunshine on average every year.

Pollution
Air pollution in the city can sometimes cause hazardous conditions. Chengdu has an average particulate pollution of 72.9mm every cubic meter. Smog can be severe, so you should always check the readings before getting out. Always carry a mask with you.

Get in

By air
Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport is located 20km (12&nbsp;mi) outside of Chengdu city centre and is one of the main air hubs in China, recently ranked 4th in passenger volume. It serves flights to/from most major cities in China, many smaller cities within Sichuan, and some international destinations including , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and . 

Since September 2017 metro line #10 operates between the airport and the city center. Line #10 connects directly to line #3. In Terminal 2 the metro is located at basement 2. Tickets can be purchased at the entrance of the metro station. 

Bus #1 operates an express service between the airport and the city centre, costing ¥10, stopping at the Air China airline office on Renmin Nanlu (2. Section) next to the entrance of the Minshan Hotel (there is no bus stop! just look for a bunch of taxis/pedicabs, since they are also waiting for the bus. The last bus leaves the airport around 01:00. Bus #2 also runs from the airport, and is not an express, so can take some time. It runs all the way to the North Railway Station. Fares vary, but to Tianfu Square it's ¥10. The buses have luggage compartments. They are well signposted within the airport terminal and, because they leave from immediately outside, are easy to find. 

Taxi fare from the airport to the city centre averages ¥45. There is no extra charge for luggage or additional passengers. When going from the city to the airport, add an additional ¥7 to cover the toll on the Airport Expressway. If you intend to take a taxi from the airport, head for the domestic arrival area and exit the terminal where you should see the official taxi stand where you can queue for marked, green-and-yellow or blue-and-yellow taxis. If you are coming from an international flight, this is right at the other end of the terminal - almost past domestic arrivals. Beware scammers and pirate taxi operators who are waiting to prey on foreign tourists with unmarked vehicles both inside and outside the terminal. Beware some who may sport official-looking, but fake, identification. Even official taxis that you might pass on the way to the taxi stand will try to negotiate a fare instead of using the meter. The fare offered will often exceed ¥100, and if you bargain with them, you may find yourself sitting in the cab for a while until agreeing to raise the price back up.

By train
Train connections are available to most cities, such as , , in , and .
It is called Chengdu Station on railway ticket, but is usually referred as "North Railway Station(Huo Che Bei Zhan)" by local people and some maps. Handles most long distance services. Trains to Dujiangyan(the city that holds ) also depart from this station.

New station serving local Sichuan destinations and most high speed train to Chongqing. Not to be confused with an old freight station, which is slightly east of Chengdu North Station as marked on some older maps

High speed train or Bullet trains to Chongqing (¥97-2014,No.)depart from both North Chengdu Station and East Chengdu Station. So you have to check the train time table certainly. If you go to the wrong station, you will miss the train which you want.

(This station is currently under construction.)

By bus
There are three bus stations in Chengdu, and they serve different destinations.

Get around
Chengdu's rush hour traffic can be hellish. Plan your itinerary around not having to be on the road during these hours.

By metro

The first line of the Chengdu Metro opened in October 2010, slicing north-south through the city along Renmin Rd and connecting the North and South railway stations together. The fare for a single ride is ¥2-4 depending on distance. You can purchase tickets from machines (English available) with ¥1 coins or ¥5 and ¥10 notes. Ticket booths are also available if you don't have suitable notes.

When entering the metro you need to put your bags through an x-ray machine. Sep 2014: Don't have any fluids like a bottle of water in your luggage: you will have to have those checked separately. The ticket is flashed by the gates on the reader on your right side. You need the ticket to get out as well so keep it safe. When exiting the ticket is placed into a slot that collects it. Again this slot is on the right side of the gate, so pay attention since it's very easy to accidentally open the gate next to you. When exiting, you must wait behind the yellow line until the passenger in front of you has passed and the gate shows it now accepts your ticket. If you're beyond the line the gate won't let you through and you need to back away for it to accept you as a new passenger.

Line 2 of the Chengdu Metro was extended in October 2014. This line now runs from Xipu in the North West of Chengdu to Longquanyi in the South East, interchanging with Line 1 at Tianfu Square Station. From Line 2 you can switch to the BRT at Niushikou station. 

Line 3 opened on 31st July 2016. As of March 2017 its' stops include Xinnanmen bus station and Chengdu Zoo. 

Line 4 opened on the 26th December 2015. At present it goes from Wannianchang in the east to the Intangible Heritage Culture Park in the west. By 2017 line 4 will be extended further at both ends. Line 3 should also be operational by then.

Line 7 opened in 2018 (see the new metro map at 

By bus
Chengdu has an extensive system of city buses plying the streets. At each bus stop, there is a list of the bus lines coming through on this road, and on some city maps the whole network is displayed. However, the bus lines and maps only use Chinese characters, and even if the bus announces the station, it will usually only be in Chinese. Bus numbers are readable in arabic figures. Tickets are ¥1 for non-aircon (now very rare) and ¥2 for air-conditioned buses. The fare is paid by putting the exact amount into a metal box next to the driver. There's no possibility to get change so make sure you have the exact amount of cash available. Normally, you enter via the front door, and alight by the rear door. On the new articulated buses, you can enter at either the front or rear door, with the middle door designated for alighting only.

Use apple maps for easy to use custom bus routes (no VPN needed). Great tool for Chengdu and broader China.

There's no official route map on the Internet but there is a well functional service available in Chinese. Click on Chengdu on the map, then select the middle tab from (公交) from the search field. To show the route of a particular line, click 高级搜索 and type the line number to the search field that appeared on the right side. You can also select from and to destinations from the map via a context menu (the two topmost options) and the service shows the route with bus line numbers and also where to change the bus if needed. Classical bus useful for tourists are 1 and 99 (inside city), 300 (link between south airport to north railway station). You can also use the Google Maps app on your smartphone to plan your travel and it will tell you which bus and subway lines to take to your destination.
Another good service is available at in Chinese. You can select from and to destinations from the map via a context menu (the two topmost options) or type line number in the search window.

If you will be in Chengdu a while, you may want to purchase a transit card (公交卡). They are sold at all Hong Qi markets and at some pharmacies. Not only do you no longer have to worry about carrying correct change, but you get free transfers for two hours plus some discounts. The card costs &yen;25 and can be loaded with three types of credit. The first is cash. You will receive a 10% discount off the cash fare when using your card's cash. So a regular bus ride will cost ¥1.80 instead of ¥2. You can also load credits (次) for this month and credits for next month. Each credit costs ¥0.50, and most bus rides use two credits (the increasingly rare non-aircon buses cost one credit). So most rides then cost you only &yen;1. Credits expire at the end of the month for which they were designated, so it can take a little effort to not buy too many or too few. Note that some bus lines (usually higher numbered ones) and the subway only accept your cash balance (not credits), which does not expire. Other lines (usually those going way out to the suburbs) accept only cash. When you board the bus and tap your card, the display will show the number of this month's credits remaining (if you used credits) or the cash balance (if you used your card's stored cash value).

By taxi
Official taxis are either green or blue and are equipped with meters. A free taxi will display an illuminated sign with Chinese characters (空车) in its dashboard. The meter is turned on by tilting the sign, make sure the driver does that and if not, you can try to do it yourself and the driver usually gets your point. Some taxi drivers may try to offer you a fixed price but don't take it unless you know it's cheaper than with the meter on. Taxi drivers don't speak English nor do they understand the map, so have an address written in Chinese with you. Drivers don't know many street names so it's best to have the address to some well known place close to your destination. Collect taxi cards from hotels and restaurants and show them to the drivers, and when close to your destination start instructing by pointing with your hand. This method usually gets you there - some drivers however will not follow your instructions or get angry for you travelling a longer distance than what they expected. If you have an iPhone, you can download the Taxi Book app (free) which provides digital taxi cards for all locations in Chengdu. This gives you the freedom to go where you want, without worrying about translation issues.

Taxi fare is ¥8 on flagfall for the older taxis ¥9 for the new ones, and increase at ¥1.9 per km after the first 2km. For rides from 10-60km the kilometre fare is increased by 50% to compensate the taxi returning empty. During night time the starting price is ¥1 more and per km price is ¥2.20. Waiting price for the taxi is one km fare per every five minutes, and the meter counts traveling with speed less than 12 km/h as waiting time. Taxis often refuse to accept ¥100 bills so try to have some change on hand.

Taxis can be difficult to find depending on the area. There are also unlicensed taxis in the city but they're quite hard to notice. If you use one, know your destination and expected price and negotiate the fare beforehand.

By motorized pedi-cab
There are still some motorized bicycle-propelled pedicabs called san lun che (三轮车) which can take you moderate distances. Fix a price (¥5-15) in advance. The passengers ride behind the driver. The ride is fun, but san lun che are being phased out and are forbidden cross or ride on certain streets, and may be gone altogether soon. Until the year 2005, all of these pedicabs were modified bicycles actually pedalled by the driver. Today, virtually all are motorized, either by electric or gasoline powered engines.

By bicycle
Most guest houses have bicycles for hire. Check for technical problems before starting out unless you want to be held responsible for it later. If you leave your bicycle, do so in one of the designated "bicycle parks", where it will be guarded over for a small fee. If you can not find such a place, be sure to lock it securely against some structure. Be careful as the bike traffic flow can be intense.

In Chengdu

*Very nice place with lots of (expensive) tea houses, restaurants and local snacks. Great for relaxing. Streets date from late Qing-dynasty style but are rebuilt recently. Free government wifi in this place. Can now be reached directly on Metro line 4.

* This square, overlooked by an enormous Chairman Mao statue in the center of the city, has been spruced up. Every evening at dusk, as well as at noontime, an elaborate water show, synchronized to music, bursts out from the square's fountains. Below the square is the hub of Chengdu's subway system.

* This park is a important entertainment place for Chengdu citizen. Everyday, especially the holiday, there are many local people in it, that means tourist can find the real leisure life of Chinese old people. They are singing and dancing in separate group, follow the sound you can find them. Some practice calligraphy with water on the floor around a monument in the north-western corner of this park. Some parents take their unmarried children's information here want find potential candidate. There are many tea house in it, local people drink tea and play majong it, the average price of one cup of tea is ￥10. There also is a Sichuan snack restaurant Zhong's Dumpling(钟水饺), beside dumpling you can find almost all famous Sichuan snack in it, and with fair price.

* Offers all the typical animals that one might expect in a zoo (elephant, tigers, giraffes, monkeys, as well as panda bears). While the zoo itself is large and spread out, some of the cages are woefully small and the facility seems understaffed. Might be good for a family to visit. The zoo has vendors selling Chinese snacks as well as some carnival type rides.

*Catch some live music or an independent film at this intimate new venue hidden in the old Shaocheng area of Chengdu. Fitted out with a killer sound system and a minimalist, concrete aesthetic, NU SPACE hosts mostly local/national acts spanning genres such as indie rock, experimental, electronic, post-punk, classical and folk. Shows start at 8:30pm-9pm. During the daytime you can enjoy a beverage beneath the gingko trees at the NU Cafe. Large tables, power plugs and wifi make it a perfect work space. Local artworks, souvenirs and records are available in the NU Store. Harvest beer on tap. No smoking inside. 

* Most guest houses and travel agencies offer to arrange visits to these traditional shows. Sichuan opera is a type of Chinese opera originating in China's Sichuan province around 1700. Today's Sichuan opera is a relatively recent synthesis of 5 historic melodic styles. Regionally Chengdu remains to be the main home of Sichuan opera, while other influential locales include Chongqing, Guizhou, Yunnan, Hubei and Taiwan. It is more like a burlesque cabaret than an actual opera, sometimes including magicians, traditional musicians, shadow plays, comedy (spoken in Chinese though), and dancers besides the traditional pieces. Of course the most famous is never omitted: quick face-changing and fire spitting performed by dancers clad in colourful traditional costumes. You will follow the story sitting at your table, sipping on your constantly refilled tea cup and nibbling some salted snacks. Note that there are many teahouses in the city that offer the show every night. Try the local favorite at Shu Feng Ya Yun (蜀风雅韵) teahouse located in Chengdu Culture Park (文化公园) on Qintai Road (it is beside Qingyang Temple). You will be seated on a covered open ground (cooled by fan; no A/C), which is actually the center of the traditional teahouse building. You might have to book in advance or just ask the concierge of your hotel to book it for you.

* This temple is built for commemorating Zhuge Liang(诸葛亮), he is minister of Shu(蜀) in Three Kingdoms Period. He is famous through the Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms. There are dozens of dust covered statues of obscure historical figures behind glass and not much else. The gardens are attractive, but not extensive. It is next to Jinli Ancient Street.

* When you are in front of Wuhouci temple, it is a small footwalk at right border of the temple.This neighborhood (main entrance is left from the Wuhouci temple when you stay in front of the temple) is part of the old city of Chengdu; it features hotels and small stores in old-fashioned style. Antiques are sold in a variety of different stores. It is very popular among both tourists and locals, especially at night, with many bars, restaurants, and nightclubs. You will find a lot of famous local snack food over there, prices &yen;1-10. Restaurants and bars in Jin Li are more expensive than outside. There are also antique hotels in there. Some consider Jin Li is to be tourist trap, which is partly true. However, this 'new old street' offers regional and fairly affordable street food specialties as well and can be combined with a visit to the Wuhouci Temple (entry fee 60 yuan, unless you are the holder of a Panda Card or senior). Don't forget to take your camera.

* This Tang Dynasty Buddhist temple is the most impressive, and perhaps also the most used, temple in Chengdu. It is dedicated to the Buddhist representation of Wisdom, Wenshu Pusa (Manjusri Bodhisatva), and contains more than 450 Buddha statues and other precious relics. In addition to the halls and gardens, the temple also has a charming tea house that offers an insightful window of Chengdu life as it is frequented by locals who engage in games of chess, reading, knitting and just chatting with family and friends. The temple also has a delightful newly (2016) renovated vegetarian restaurant with seats offering views over the gardens. Entry fee is a steal at only 5 yuan. As of July 2016, they were no entry fee. Some of the English signs pointing here say "Manjusri Temple". There are shops around the temple.

* This Taoist temple is the oldest and biggest of its kind in the area, located in the west of downtown. A large and still-active temple that takes into consideration Taoist philosophy in its construction, and with both a park next door and a number of relaxed courtyards inside. While it has a long history, the buildings are modern, cheaply-made concrete constructions, and it quite frequently shows. The statues inside are also cheap modern constructions of no real interest. A teahouse and a vegetarian restaurant can be found within the temple complex.

* It is a temple where people can relax and feel soothed. It is a peaceful place right in the middle of busy business, and many people come here in the morning to meditate and bask in the sun. There are many flowers inside the temple, many lotus flowers, and once Su Shi and Xuan Zang came here. Seeing the murals can remind of those famous people.

* This is one of the two best city parks. It can be reached by the BRT at one end as it is just inside the second ring road. Alternatively you can take Metro line 2 to Chengdu University of TCM. From there you walk about 20 minutes. On the way you pass other nearby attractions that are clustered in this area such as the River Market, the Sichuan Museum and Dufu’s Cottage. The park is large and has a wetland, mature trees, flower gardens and a lot of birdlife. Free entry.

* Opened in January 2016 and has a smooth concrete path that is bike, wheelchair and scooter friendly. Takes 2 hours to walk around the lake. There are a lot of water birds around, especially in winter. As you walk around the lake there are three small weirs, the Mausoleums of Princes of Shu of the Ming Dynasty and a decent children’s playground. Bikes can now also be hired here. The lake is located in East Chengdu between the third and fourth ring road. From MixC Mall you can take the following buses directly there: #80 and 98. On return the #219 goes past 24 City and the 80 and 98 return to Mix C Mall. By 2017 Metro Line 4 should be extended and will have a stop right outside the park. Free entry.

* Take Metro Line 10 to Huayuan Station (花源站), get off and walk 1200 meters, about 500 meters from the University of Arts and Professions (there are many snacks around the university), a hidden-gem but secluded temple, a building on the left for drinking tea, 5 ¥, there are tables but no shade umbrella. Guanyin Temple is on the right, and has a golden statue of Guanyin.

* Zhaojue Temple is another temple loved by Chengdu locals and is said to be very spiritual for praying to students to get good grades. So many locals come here, and the Chinese literary figure Dai Jitao is also buried here. There is also the five-color flag of the Republic of China. The temple is very big and you can receive incense inside the temple, free of charge.

* Moderate size amusement park with 3 main roller coasters, Water Rides, Kids zone and water park (in Summer). Overall Good day out for both adults and families, makes a nice break from the city and has enough attractions to fill a full day out, As of 2011 the entrance to the park is now a sports retail outlet, Imax and Indoor Sky diving Centre with Resturants 

*Opened in August 2013 as the World's Largest Building. The building houses a large mall, indoor water park, IMAX movie theater, skating rink, and a couple five-star hotels. It is located on top of the Jincheng Plaza metro station on Line 1, making it very easy to get to. The water park, known as Paradise Island, is about $30 per person for a pass and is not really worth the money. The wave pool requires life jackets to be worn by all swimmers, something that will be new to Western water park goers. Aside from its hotel (which you cannot find from inside incidentally), the building is operational. It is nothing more than an oversized shopping center with a great deal of unused space. The water park is over securitised, there is no English for the IMAX Movies and there are very few choices in terms of stores, most of which are over-priced. There is a great selection of food on the top floor, but outside that its a good opportunity to go, have a photo taken out front, do a quick photo taking inside then get back on the metro to see the same stores in town. Behind the Global Center is Jinsheng Park and Jinsheng Lake.

* Liujiang town, located 25 km southwest of the county to spend Hongya River tributary of Liujiang sides. Town was founded in the Southern Song Dynasty, and modern architecture across the water from the Ming and Qing era buildings.

* Wangjianglou Park Quite a famous park in Chengdu, this is the other city park I highly rate. From the Jinjiang River near Wanda Plaza it is a 20minute walk along the river. Free entry. The park has a strong bamboo theme, with 270 species on exhibit. There are also numerous bird species present. The park can be divided into two sections: An open section with free entrance and a closed section that costs ¥20 to enter. The closed section has several Qing Dynasty buildings present and is relatively peaceful.

* Mausoleums of Princes of Shu of the Ming Dynasty Combine this with a walk around Qinlong Lake. The number 80, 97 and 219 buses come by this area which is opposite Chengdu University. There are actually two tombs on site. One is the tomb of an emperor and the other is off his concubine. There is a small admission fee.

* Du Fu Cottage Du Fu is a very famous Chinese poet, so much so that he is their equivalent to Shakespeare. The site backs onto Huan Huanxi Park and has beautiful grounds and museums including Du Fu’s actual residence. Entrance is ¥50 for adults.

* Chengdu Eastern Memory Eastern Memory is part of the original old industrial area in the eastern suburbs. It was converted into this cultural and creative industrial park covering 189,000 square meters. As you walk around the site you can see numerous music and industrial themed statues, an original train from the 1950s, numerous expensive restaurants and an IMAX theatre. Sometimes you can see young people walking around dressed as anime characters. Take the BRT to SM Mall and walk 15 minutes. Eastern Memory can actually be seen from the platform. Alternatively from 24 City you can walk there by following the Shahe river east for 2 hours, cross a foot bridge and then walk a block. Free entry.

* Bailuwan Wetlands Also known as Egret Bay. Located south of Chengdu on the fourth ring road. It is tricky to get to but an awesome park. If you can reach a place where the 186 bus stops you can get there. Several lakes and a lot of water fowl. Bikes can be hired cheaply, including two seaters so families can cycle their young children around. Don’t forget to bring extra money as you need to pay a deposit for the bikes which you get back at the end. Next door to the wetlands is Hetangyuese Park which has a lake with stunning lotus plants in the warmer months. Free entry.

* Chengdu Botanical Garden The gardens are located north in the same general area as the Panda base. From the Chengdu Zoo transfer to the #25 bus and go to the final stop. The Botanic Gardens are right there. Entry costs ¥10. The gardens are a decent size. There are many mature trees and beautiful flower gardens. This is a great place to have a picnic. Plenty of food is for sale both outside and inside the gardens. The gardens include a tropical section and a greenhouse full of desert plants.

Museums

* Subway Line 1, Tianfu Square, Exit C. The new Chengdu Museum, with three floors, features the culture of Dunhuang during the Tang and Song dynasties, as well as the costumes and architecture of the inhabitants of western China at the time. The B1 floor is a nature museum, and the third floor is a new exhibition with animation and handicrafts, as well as China's animation industry, as Chengdu is the hub of China's animation industry. On the fifth floor is the shadow puppets, which exhibits various types of shadow puppets in Sichuan opera.

*Provincial Museum of Sichuan Province. A wide range of excellent collection (Bronze wares, Chinese paintings (with a featured collection of Sichuanese painter Zhang Daqian(Chang Dai-chien)), Buddhistic sculpture of various periods; Tibetan artefacts, objects of anthropological interest from ethnical minorities within the province and a live show of Sichuanese silk weaving, etc.) on permanent display. Free entrance. 

* Recently discovered site featuring various tools and art pieces from around 3,000 years ago. The amount of unearthed items is just massive. They include pottery, blades, jade items, building foundations and various golden art pieces. Jinsha represents the mysterious ancient Shu civilization, the first stage of the Sanxingdui civilization, which has many unsolved mysteries to date. The most famous treasure is the "Four Birds Around the Sun Gold Ornament", which represents the fact that in Neolithic China, humans were already so advanced in metal craftsmanship that they could process gold into very thin gold foil. The first pavilion is an archaeological site that is still being excavated, although it is not quite ready to be developed on a large scale due to the current immaturity of the technology. Currently on display are gold, bronze, jade, stone, ivory and lacquer ware. There are two main buildings: the hall constructed over the centre of the excavation site and the modern exhibition hall with various artifacts on display.

* Excellent display of local artifacts and is worth while way of spending an hour or two. The museum is one of the better in China and there are four floors of well lite, air conditioned displays with decent English translations. Starting in the basement, enter the first room where dozens of stone carvings dating from the Han dynasty to the Tang are on display. The room next door has a moderately interesting display on the museum's history and numerous examples of ancient bronzes and stone age artifacts. The first floor is mostly artifacts from the Ming and Qing dynasty, including furniture, silk clothing, and an interesting display of leather puppets. The second floor has the perhaps the most engaging display: artifacts and daily use items from ethnic minority groups in China's southwest, including Tibetans, Miao, Yi, Qiang, Jianpo and Naxi. The third floor has a decent display of calligraphy scrolls, paintings, and ceramics. The museum is currently closed after the city changed the location of several universities. Plans are pending for a new museum to be built.

* The car museum built together with the Volvo factory is worth seeing. There is a very detailed introduction about Volvo and the cars, as well as an explanation of car safety. Volvo has a huge factory in Chengdu with numerous parts, mechanical arms, and is suitable for going with children.

* This huge four-storey museum is filled with interactive exhibits about science, aerodynamics, space, mathematics, robotics and physics. Quite dated and cheeky but children may love the interactive displays and indoor playground on the 4th floor. Adults will appreciate the descriptions in both English and Chinese. During weekdays this museum can either be overrun by local school groups or be so deserted it's almost creepy. Closed on Mondays. Most of the exhibits have broken down or have fallen apart. There's nothing scientific or technological about it that represents the real and new China, more so a 70s cold war relic. On the first floor is a gyroscopic flight simulator where you are strapped in and spun upside down and in all directions. Great thrill ride for 5RMB and a secret highlight of Chengdu (ride is only open 10-11:30 and 1:30-3). 

* Metro Line 2, Dongmen Bridge Station, Exit B.
Water Well Liquor is a famous Chinese white liquor (Baijiu). Originally named Quanxing Daqu. Started brewing in Yuan Dynasty. The brewery is located outside the old Dongmen Bridge. In the cellar you can see how to make Chinese liquor, which usually has a high degree, reaching even 50~60 degrees, and the quality of the wine is closely related to the water, climate and terroir. It is divided into different aromatic flavors and with the taste of pineapple and passion fruit. This museum is large, with more than 10,000 square meters, and also displays some vodka, whiskey, gin, etc. The museum itself is also part of the wine cellar, and the oldest wine is said to have been stored from the Yuan Dynasty to the present. Worth a look.

* The design of the art museum is inspired by the hibiscus flower, the city flower of Chengdu. The total area is over 3000 acres. There are two pavilions, A and B. There are many art works, which are good for taking photos.

* A hidden-gem art museum inside Lushan Hill, focusing on oil painting, photography and sculpture, with good surroundings, built by Chinese artist He Gong.

* Next to Kuanzhai XIangzi, it is a painting art gallery full of Sichuan style, combining art and city life well. The building itself in a Yanzhen Daoist temple from the Tang Dynasty, with an overall antique style. It is also the earliest public painting academy in Sichuan, with art exhibitions, collections and, in good weather, tea in the courtyard.

* A contemporary art gallery in Chengdu exhibiting Chinese and international artists. Exhibit openings generally happen once a month, and other events also take place.

* A museum of classic cars of all eras, quite large, and a collection of car-related items, with many classic vintage cars and vehicles that are well maintained. There is a vintage street outside where you can buy some crafts.

Greater Chengdu

See the panda
* This is the biggest facility of this kind in the world. Due to habitat destruction and other reasons, the giant panda is maybe the most famous endangered animal. It is home to some 60 giant pandas, but also has some red pandas and a colony of black-necked cranes. The pandas are basically on display for tourists but views are much closer than is possible at most Western zoos. A small museum and a cinema screening related documentaries is also available. A restaurant and souvenir-stalls top off the tourist installations. The best time to visit is in the morning (early, once it opens at 7:30AM is best), when pandas are most active and crowds are light. Pandas sleep during the hottest time of the day. Feeding time is around 8:00-9:30 (depending on the time of year). It is recommended to arrive as early as you can to avoid the hordes of school and tour groups that arrive every morning and more importantly because panda are fed between 8h and 10h and most are starting a 6h nap between 10h to 11h. Park opens at 7:30am but expect people to be waiting starting around 715am. According to an employee the best time of year to visit is winter as the pandas are more active with the cooler weather. Holding a panda is no longer an option (June 2016). 

* Take bus No. 14 in Dujiangyan to reach the entrance. It is another panda base built on a mountain, smaller than the breeding base, not too big and tiring to walk around, and you can see both giant pandas and red pandas. The best time to see pandas is in the morning, when pandas are more energetic and eat at this time, and after they are full, they will go to sleep. The red pandas are completely free-ranging, more daring and not afraid of people. If you want to touch the red pandas directly, you can do so, but you need to make a reservation in advance.

* Another panda park, on Huizhong Road in Qingcheng Mountain. It is close to the Ancient Town of Jiezi(街子古镇), entrance 39￥ (maybe now ￥59). There are many green plants inside, and compared to the breeding base, even in the summer season, there are very few people, so you can see the baby pandas more closely, and because there are fewer people, the park is more quiet and comfortable. You can take the electric car tour, 15￥, in the middle will stop 2~3 stops, then the driver will point you where there are pandas and tell you where the best viewing spot is.

Luodai Ancient Town

* Over 1 km long streets with older building (in various states of disrepair) lined with stores. The primary attraction is the many different types of food and snacks available, especially Hakka food, that are hard to find in other places (along with some amount of stores selling standard tourist crap and costumes to rent for photos). The buildings that line the street are of some, but not great, interest; more interesting are a number of older buildings and halls that give one a feel for older China. Signage and shops appear to be Chinese-language only.

* Boke Tulou is not a historical building in Luodai Ancient Town, but a new building, located on the periphery of the town, which is modeled after the Fujian . There are 4 floors in total, and the 1st to 2nd floors are a museum of Hakka culture.

* Just 6km from Luodai Ancient Town, you can get there by taking the number 853 local bus. Cost of walking the wall is ¥10. Excellent views of the surrounding hills and Chengdu Plain if it is a clear day. The wall is steep and takes an hour to walk in one direction. The 853B bus returns to the ancient town from the top of the wall. Shuttles can also return travelers back to the old town. There is also a temple at the top of the wall.

Jiezi Ancient Town

* In the northern Chongzhou City, 1 hour drive from Chengdu, at the junction with Dujiangyan, this is where some of the old buildings are preserved. You can take a wooden boat (four people 100￥/hour), there are many restaurants, snacks, and some amusement facilities, and of course there are some stores selling tourist crap. There is a teahouse by the river, sitting and drinking tea and chatting is very good, in general, is a relaxed place.

* Not commercialized ancient town with some taste of old China. 110km from Chengdu, very far away, by the Chengming Expressway (成名高速).

Other Greater Chengdu
* Every Chinese knows about Dujiangyan in textbooks. The Dujiangyan was built by Li Bing and his father, who built the Fisha Weir and the Baobukou, which laid a solid foundation for agriculture in the "Land of Milk and Honey". Originally constructed around 256 BC by the State of Qin as an irrigation and flood control project, it is still in use today. The system's infrastructure develops on the Min River (Minjiang), the longest tributary of the Yangtze. The area is in the west part of the Chengdu Plain, between the Sichuan Basin and the Tibetan Plateau. Originally, the Min would rush down from the Min Mountains and slow down abruptly after reaching the Chengdu Plain, filling the watercourse with silt, thus making the nearby areas extremely prone to floods. King Zhao of Qin commissioned the project, and the construction of the Dujiangyan harnessed the river using a new method of channeling and dividing the water rather than simply damming it. The water management scheme is still in use today to irrigate over 5,300 km2 (2,000 sq mi) of land in the region. The Dujiangyan, the Zhengguo Canal in Shaanxi and the Lingqu Canal in Guangxi are collectively known as the "three great hydraulic engineering projects of the Qin."

* It is also located in the city of Dujiangyan and can be visited together with Dujiangyan. It is a very famous Taoist mountain in China and there are many Taoist temples. If you have time, you may spend a night here and can feel the cool evening breeze of the mountain. There is a panda valley up there, where you can see pandas, and baby pandas. Pandas move well in the morning, so it is best to go in the morning. THe mountain is separated into front and back hills, the front mountain has more amazing scenery and the back mountain is suitable for climbing. If you want to save your energy, you can take the ¥10 ferry to replace the 40-minute walk, buy a ticket to enter the gate and choose the road on the right to reach the Moon City Lake, then you can take a boat to the opposite shore for ¥5. It's short, but here you can take the fast and non-tiring ropeway that goes straight to the entrance of the mountain. Of course, the ropeway costs 60￥. Qingcheng Mountain, where more than 30 Taoist masters have practiced throughout history, belongs to the Quanzhen school and is one of the most famous Taoist locations in China.

* A monastery on the outskirts of Chengdu, can be reached by taxi from Longquan. Inside you can turn the sutra wheel, there are not many people, only some come to pray for marriage, it is said to be very spiritual here.

* It is a religious area with many temples next to each other, 40 minutes by taxi, in the northern suburbs of Chengdu. It has a long history, you can burn incense in the temple, there are more than 500 Arhats in the Arhats Hall, making it one of the largest in China. During the Tang Dynasty, when Huang Chao revolted (878-884 AD), the emperor used to be stationed here. According to the legend, he had seen the light shining from underground at night, so he asked a senior monk, who said there must be relics underground, so the emperor asked people to dig, and indeed dug up a stone box with 13 Buddha relics inside, so he ordered the construction of a 13-story stupa to enshrine them, hence the name "Treasure Light Pagoda". Entrance 5￥.

* It's in Pengzhou(彭州) town, about 1 hour north of Chengdu. Although in the center of this small city, the environment is very nice. Longxing Temple was built in 337 A.D. By the end of the Qing Dynasty, the King of Burma presented a jade Buddha, the King of India presented the relics of the Bayonet Sutra, and the State of Japan presented the Tripitaka Sutra to the Emperor of China, all collected in Longxing Temple, right in front of the temple, and is one of the 19 pagodas in China with the relics of Shakyamuni.
The original pagoda has been damaged and the current one was restored in the 90's, modeled after the Calcutta Pagoda in India, so it is different from other Chinese temples and is very unique, and has just become better known in recent years, attracting more and more people to pray. Tea is available at the temple. 20￥ to go up the tower.

* It's about 1 hour west of Chengdu. Located in Chongzhou (崇州), in the same area as the shrine of Lu You, Chinese historian and poet of the Southern Song Dynasty. Entrance fee 8￥, fewer people go there, very quiet, a park with shrines and pavilions, suitable for a walk-by trip, but no need to go specifically, many gardens are similar to Suzhou gardens, suitable for a slow stroll on a carefree afternoon.

* It is a shrine and park built to commemorate the two emperors of the ancient Shu civilization. In the middle of the road from Chengdu to Dujiangyan, so if you take a drive to Dujiangyan, you can tell the driver stay here for 1~2 hours. The park is not big, you can see it all in 1 hour. There are only some stone monuments.

* It is between Pengzhou and Dujiangyan. It's not big, a small temple with some Buddhist rituals inside, you can only take a taxi, about 1.5 hours from downtown Chengdu. This temple is a bit like the temples in Thailand or Kyoto, Japan. The most special thing about the temple is that there are many deers, and many ancient trees. Currently, it is possible to close due to the COVID or repair.

*The park includes a moderate selection of rides (water, relaxing and thrill), and various recreation activities. Not very spectacular, little bit outdated. Weekends can get packed, so try to go during a weekday.

* Baigongyan Park This park is near Lonquanyi, east of Chengdu. It is a decent sized park and it takes about two hours to walk around the lake. In the center of the lake is an island and you can see people going on boat rides around the lake. The track starts off like a road but then you can veer off onto dirt paths through peach tree forests around the lake. The surrounding forest is green and lush. To get here take metro line 2 from Chengdu and do to Lonquanyi at the end of the line. From there take the 864 or 850 bus and make sure you get off at the right place. (The 850 actually carries on to Luodai, the 864 carries on to the Hometown of Peach Blossoms.) The bus only costs ¥1. Free entry.

* Xindu Guihu Park Xindu is a satellite city north of Chengdu. To get there you have to catch the #650 bus from the zoo which takes you into Xindu. Once in Xindu catch a taxi to the park. There are two sections – the free public part which has a lake, numerous tea houses, historic buildings & statues and lush foliage. But the special part is the private section that you pay ¥20 to enter. The entrance is located inside Xindu’s old city wall which you can’t miss. The wall dates back around 1000 years. Once inside there are many large Qing dynasty buildings, mature trees and this lotus lake. Summer is the best time to visit as the lotus flowers are in full bloom. You can also feed carp with baby bottles there. The Xindu Museum is also on site and there are 3000 year old skeletons on display.

Do
For up-to-date information on activities, places and attractions you should check out the CHENGDOO citylife magazine's listings. You will find copies in most bars, restaurants, cafes, hostels and hotels.

* Take an afternoon or evening to walk down this shopping street, located in the center of the city. Makes for a good change of pace. Various clothing stores, bookstores, restaurants, arcades, and cinemas. Good place to find something to eat; including a hotpot buffet, Japanese restaurants, Western food, and much more. However, the major disadvantage with this area is that each brand has many stores in this location (similar to other parts of China). For instance, Nike, Adidas, and Li-Ning, each have about 4-5 stores in Chunxi Road alone which reduces the variety of things to buy. If you are looking for stores in the same vein as Louis Vuitton and Ermenegildo Zegna, these stores are located outside of the Chunxi Road area and near the Tianfu Square district.

*Tallest tower 339 meters

* Spend an evening singing with friends, enjoy popcorn, beer and other refreshments. Songs available in English, Chinese, and more.

* Chengdu is famous for its relaxed and laid back lifestyle. Foot and body massage is very popular in Chengdu with a lot of varieties. Generally, these places cater to groups of people who come in together, relax in a private room, perhaps eating fruit, pig ear, or sipping tea, while receiving a fully-clothed massage or foot washing. Prices are very reasonable, often well under &yen;80 per person. Some places offer &yen;25 per hour for a very nice foot massage, including washing, soaking and massaging feet, free hot/cold drink (tea, coke or juice), fresh fruit. A great way to relax with friends. Beware of erotic massage places that may be hard to tell from authentic ones. Watch out for establishments (such as on Yuhe side street, next to the Sheraton) that have two price boards, one in Chinese, and one in English with heavily inflated prices (eg. foreigners - 80 yuan, Chinese - 40 yuan). 

* The Chengdu Bookworm (see listing in the Eat Section) has a membership-based lending library of English language books, as well as travel guides for sale. Peter's Tex Mex, as well as some of the other restaurants that cater to foreigners, have book exchanges.

* Local woman love to get their nails and hair done at the mall. You can get your nails done beautifully (filed, buffered, polished and hand painted with beautiful patent) between &yen;10-20 at most shopping centre. There are quite a few very popular ones located on the ground floor of Beijing Hualian (北京华联）in Yanshikou. You can also get your hair temporarily straightened or curled at &yen;10-15. They do very nice style and it will last until you wash your hair.

* Teahouses are plentiful in Chengdu, and drinking tea and playing Mahjong is how many local people relax. On a sunny afternoon pick a table in the park with an out-door tea house and sip your tea while listening to the locals gossiping. Not for the faint hearted, take the opportunity to have your ears cleaned by local "experts" armed with a tuning fork and a myriad of "insertion tools". Weird but effective! There are thousands of teahouses in Chengdu so you'll find them from other places than Renmin Park as well.
*This is a good way to eat where locals really eat. Travel by tuktuk away from the tourist center to get the real stuff with a local English speaking guide to take care of everything. Food and drinks are included.

Eat
You will find no shortage of delicious and fiery Sichuan food in Chengdu. Most of the food is quite spicy, be sure to specify whenever you order: non-spicy (不要辣; búyàolà), a little spicy (微辣; wēilà) or 'old' (very) spicy (老辣; lǎolà). If you are not accustomed to it yet, a bottle of sweetened soy, almond, peanut, or cow milk, or something else sweet will work much better than water to quell the fire. If you are used to the hottest of authentic Indian or Thai food, the level of spiciness in Sichuan food should be no problem at all. However, Sichuan food also makes heavy use of Sichuan pepper (花椒; huājiāo), which looks like but is not a true peppercorn, and causes your mouth to become somewhat numb. Sichuan pepper is added in most spicy dishes. If you can eat spicy food but do not like Sichuan pepper, you need to order so (不要花椒; bú yào huājiāo). However, Sichuan pepper (in addition to causing numbing) has an important citrusy taste that it adds to foods and authentic Sichuan tastes bank on the play between the flavours of both Sichuan pepper and chili peppers, and it is strongly recommend you at least try the authentic versions with the Sichuan pepper before deciding for yourself.

The spiciest food in Chengdu is hotpot (also called steampot or steamboat), although the tradition originated in Chongqing, so it is not really Chengdu food. Sichuan hotpots are basically a big pot of soup and spices simmering in a hole in the middle of your table. Patrons choose from a large selection of meats, vegetables and other add-ins. Most popular include: lamb, mushrooms, beef, tofu, quail eggs, potatoes and various others (pork, green vegetables, fish balls, carrots, and even pig's brain!) You can choose spicy pot or non spicy pot. With spicy hot pots, unlike eastern hot pots, the soup is NOT for drinking; instead, fish out your cooked items with chopsticks (do not fish the liquid out with a spoon, it is too spicy even for locals to drink; the fished out vegetables will be spicy enough), dip them in the small bowl of oil provided to each person, and enjoy.

You may also find the local food too oily or too salty for your taste, and may want to advise your server accordingly.

There are also a lot of weird local snack type of food, such as spicy dragon prawns (look like very small crayfish; 麻辣龙虾), spicy snails (香辣田螺), Chongqing duck neck (九九鸭脖子), Bangbang chicken (棒棒鸡), spicy rabbit meat (二姐兔丁). These ones are so delicious and you must try them. But you need to ask a local to take you to the right place. Quite often you will find that the small restaurants and shops offer the most delicious and cheapest food. If you want to find even cheaper food options, street vendors are the way to go (though the Chengdu police have been doing their best to extinguish this long tradition and you may have trouble finding them these days). Serving everything from barbeque (烧烤) to steamed breadrolls(馒头), they are a cheap and offer a great option for a quick bite to eat. 

If you are less adventurous but still like Chinese food, or just tired of Sichuan food, there are a number of Cantonese and Hong Kong restaurants, including Lei Garden near Shangri-la Hotel. At Jianshe Xiang Food Street, close to Taikoo Li, you can find a whole street of snacks, such as baked tofu, rice noodles, and many unknown Chinese snacks, feels chaotic, but gathers a lot of locals and is next to the Electronic University, which is patronized by many local students, so it should be more authentic. Fragrant Fragrant Lane, in Chinese 香香巷, or Xiāng Xiāng Xiàng, is a very small alley near Taikoo-li, you can basically all restaurants, with neon lights embellished, better to come at night. Next to it is Wangping Street, which is also full of restaurants, including Sichuan cuisine, spicy hot pot, Asian, Japanese and Korean cuisine, Thai restaurants, and bars. Near the Iron Statue Temple (铁像寺), Water Street 水街, is a place to drink tea. There are many cafes, teahouses, and restaurants. In Xiangnanli, there are also many businesses, coffee, barbecue, seafood, hot pot, snacks, etc.

In Wenshu Fang, or 文殊坊, close to Wenshu Monastery, there are many snack stores, stalls, and shops selling traditional Chinese costumes Hanfu, in addition to traditional Sichuan snacks. The Bubble Tree Street, in Chinese 泡桐树街, Pāo Tóng Shù Jiē, next to Kuanzhai Xiangzi, is much quieter and sells snacks and private-house foods.

There are a number of stalls and hole in the wall type places all over town. Food here is dirt cheap, expect to pay no more than ¥8 for a meal, and the quality is good. Things to be on the lookout for are spicy bowls of breakfast noodles, (担担面; dandanmian), double cooked pork (回锅肉; húigūoròu), and dozens of dishes coated in "málà" the Sichuan chili spice famous the world over.

* Cheap and fast hotpot variety. This is a help-yourself style meal, go to a backroom and choose your own kebabs. Stick the kebabs into a hotpot soup, and have them boil. Pull them out and enjoy. Large kebabs are ¥1, and small ones are ¥0.1 each. Expect to be full for less than ¥25. There are both spicy and non-spicy variations. There is a large selection of meats, vegetables, and other add-ins. Beer is available in large bottles and sweet soymilk (Dounai) is also served.

* A bowl of noodles starts for about ¥4, and reach a maximum of ¥7. Varieties include egg, lamb and beef. Other dishes are reasonable in price as well. Breads for 1 kuai a piece, and Mutton Kabobs (羊肉串) go for 1 kuai per stick. Da Pan Ji (大盘鸡) is a great choice if eating with a group. Usually offered in small or large sizes, a small size will cost about ¥40 and feed 3 or 4 people. A large order might cost about ¥60. This dish includes chicken, potatoes, onions and other vegetables in a moderately spicy sauce. Can eat with bread or noodles to make a great meal.

* Sold for breakfast or lunch from street vendors throughout the city. Yacai bao (芽菜包) is a local Sichuan special variety you are unlikely to find elsewhere and typically contains some mixture of Yacai (芽菜), a type of preserved vegetable, and potentially some meat. Other typical fillings include beef, red bean paste, mushrooms, green vegetables or pork. Three buns cost around ¥1 or larger buns cost ¥1 each as well. A container of soy milk (豆漿 dou jiang) is about the same price.

*For particularily great Uigur noodles (pulled and shaved noodles), head to "Lan Zhou Niu Rou La Mian", a family-run little restaurant on Donghuamen Street. Find it in the little section between Renmin E Road and Donghua Main St, all of which is north-east of and only a couple minutes' walk from Tianfu Square (where the metro lines intersect).

* Specializes in Thai cuisine. Great food and exceptional service when you need a break from oily and spicy Sichuan food.

Splurge

Tibetan

* Just across Wuhou Temple's main gate, and close to the Tibetan quarter, there's "A're restaurant", one of the first and most famous among Tibetan restaurants in Chengdu. Traditional atmosphere, friendly Tibetan stuff and occasional performances make this place unique. Plenty of delicious dishes made of bread, yak meat and yak cheese.

Mid range
The vast majority of Chengdu's mid-range hotels are not affiliated with a national or international brand and generally charge &yen;300-700. The hotels in this category can generally put up the facade of the more luxurious hotels, but often suffer noticeably from deferred maintenance or haphazard customer service. Many are geared mostly towards Chinese and Asian tour groups.

Contact

Phone
China's country code is 86. Chengdu's area code is 28. Coin-operated pay phones are located throughout Chengdu, and calling cards can be purchased from many vendors. Local landline phone numbers are eight digits long; cellular phone numbers in Sichuan are eleven digits long and start with 13 or 15.

Internet
Internet access can be found in most guesthouses and through cheap internet cafes all over town. Look out for Web-character 网 and the Pacman-character 吧 in the Chinese name for internet bar: 网吧.

A large Internet cafe is located on the second floor of the Xinnianmen bus station, just 100 meters from the Jiaotong Fandian hotel. The connection is fast and access is ¥2/hour.

While getting a local SIM card is highly recommended (for GSM phones, use China Unicom. For CDMA, use China Telecom. 1gb data is about $10), you can get away with free public wifi. Note that while wifi from restaurants and hotels don't need further authentication when you connect, places like banks, malls, even airports do require identity verification (实名制) and the landing page either requires a Chinese phone number or doesn't have English instruction at all. Ask a local to help you login, most college age students are able to speak decent level of English!

Stay safe
Thieves are prevalent around certain areas of Chengdu. Be careful around the Yanshikou markets and especially around the North train station. There are also many thieves on crowded buses who use razors to cut open pockets and bags. Also watch your bag at all times when riding bicycles around the city, thieves like to run alongside bicycles at traffic lights and reach into bags.

Traffic can be insanely hectic and motorists as well as cyclists and other pedestrians often have a complete disregard of you, the pedestrian. Beware when crossing streets; even when the WALK sign is green, (this means nothing to them or to the Police), traffic taking a right or left turn even when they are not permitted to turn will try to run you over or honk at you to make way for them. Accidents are commonplace as are deaths. Look every direction but up. Watch out for taxi drivers, bus drivers and private car drivers who have absolutely no regard for your life. Also watch out for motorists, they are all unlicensed riding silent electric motorbikes coming at you from the left, from the right, from behind and from the front. To stay safe, it is best to walk with a crowd, preferably in the middle.

Cope
For such a big city, there's surprisingly little Western influence in Chengdu but certainly more than regional "rival" Chongqing. It's definitely not or but this is changing fast with the arrival of more and more foreign students, teachers, and business people. This may be trying initially, as the level of English spoken is noticeably lower than other places, but it's also a blessing; carry a phrasebook and enjoy the authentic Chinese urban experience. The Western quarter, if there is one, seems to be around Kehua North Road.

Police
If you need to make a visa extension, You can visit Chengdu Police Security Bureau but be warn of the 7 days delay. Most people in a hurry will try to do their renew in Leshan or Songpan where it seems delay is about 1h to 1d, if the (only) officer is here.

* For visa extension/renew, you need to fill a form, 1 picture, passport+visa copy. You can pay either at nearby ICBC bank in cash (get a ticket, but if wait is too long, ask the security guy. it seems after some time, he makes people with PSB receipt cut the queue), either by chinese (only) bank card at downstairs counter 16. Delay is 5 opened days which makes a week, so could be better to ask in smaller cities like Leshan where there is only 1 day delay.

One can hike down into the gorge on well marked paths and take an elevator back up. There is also one section of the gorge where hanging coffins can be seen on the cliff side. The park also has special panda habitats, as well as a more traditional "zoo". The main reason to go here is for the walks and hikes into the gorge. The zoo, although filled with animals such as tigers, lions, bears, monkeys, and even a drive-through section, has woefully inadequate and sometimes smelly enclosures. (The enormous bird aviary is one exception). You can pay to enter the zoo for ¥150 which includes a safari or pay ¥118 to walk the gorge and go to the Panda Base.

Alternatively, take a taxi out (about 75 yuan) and come back by bus as return taxi's can be hard to find.

The 853 bus from Luodai bus station or minivans (from eastern city gate) take you there or in about 20 minutes (2-10 yuan). Upon arrival, you can climb this local Great Wall, but be warned: although the wall is only a few kilometres long, it's a steep climb which is best not undertaken in hot weather (i.e. summer).
