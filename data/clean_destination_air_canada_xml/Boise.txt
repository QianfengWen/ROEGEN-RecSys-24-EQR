Boise is the capital of as well as the largest city in Idaho with a metro population of around 670,000. The city rests at the base of the foothills of the Rocky Mountains along the plain of the Boise River which winds through the city. A very outdoors oriented place with many activities available without even leaving the city. Although its economic growth has its roots in the Simplot potato industry, the city is now home to many high tech industries. Notable companies such as Albertsons and Micron are headquartered here. 

 Understand 

Although the exact origin is disputed, the name "Boise" (pronounced BOY-see) is unquestionably derived from the French "bois√©," or "wooded." The name is a reference to the tree-lined Boise River which passes through the heart of the city. To this day the city takes its "City of Trees" moniker very seriously.

Boise started its life as Fort Boise, a U.S. Army installation located at a strategic junction on the Oregon Trail between what were then the major settlements in southern Idaho Territory, the mining camps of Silver City to the south and Idaho City to the northeast. A city grew quickly around the fort and by 1865 was the new capital of Idaho Territory (much to the chagrin of northern Idahoans). By the dawn of the 20th Century Boise was far and away the dominant city in the region, having long eclipsed the likes of Silver City and Idaho City.

Today Boise is sometimes seen as the eastern enclave of the Pacific Northwest, or the western enclave of the Rocky Mountains, or both, depending on who you ask. Downtown Boise and the North End neighborhood offer a PNW feel every bit as strong as anything in Portland or Seattle, while suburbs such as Meridian and Nampa steadfastly cling to the decidedly self-reliant ethos of the Intermountain West.

Boise is a sports town strongly supporting its local teams, including the NBA D-League Idaho Stampede, the ECHL Idaho Steelheads, and of course its emerging college football powerhouse at Boise State University - all with recent league and conference championships. Slowly but surely Boise is beginning to accept its role as a new major metropolitan area in the western United States, while at the same time embracing its small town past.

*Idaho Botanical Gardens. A truly serene place to visit. The gardens have been the site of many weddings and performances because of its beautiful setting of vibrant flowers and other vegetation.

The museum, located in a part of downtown known as the "Basque Block," is a great place to visit whether or not you are of the Basque descent.

*Boise Towne Square is the city's main mall. It is a fairly large mall, mostly due to its lack of competition from any other similarly sized shopping center in the city. Its anchor-stores include Dillard's and a particularly upscale Macys (formerly the Bon Marche). The mall also contains its own free-standing Sephora makeup store.

*Eighth Street Marketplace - located in the center of downtown Boise, the eighth street marketplace is a popular sight to go shopping, have a bite to eat, and go dancing at night. It's all three in one! This area has recently undergone significant revitalization and is often referred to as "BoDo," short for "Boise Downtown."

*Other parts of "BoDo". Along with the Eighth Street Marketplace, you may want to just wander throughout the downtown core. The area of Broad St (between 9th and Capitol) and 8 St (between Front and Myrtle) is home to many fashionable retailers like Urban Outfitters. As well, the area of 9th St. between Idaho and Main, parts of Main Street, areas of Idaho St. around 8th St. are all good areas to walk around and spot a few good shops and restaurants.

 Eat 

Most of the fancier restaurants are in the downtown area. Boise is home to an abundance of chain restaurants, but also enjoys a surprising amount of international cuisine, unique coffee shops, and surprisingly delicious hole-in-the-wall diners and establishments. 
* Lucky 13 - Pizza and beer in a patio setting snuggled into the Harris Ranch area of East Boise. A great place to go on a warm summer evening. Smoking is allowed on the patio.
*Flying Pie Pizza - Possibly Boise's best pizza with two locations: 6508 Fairview - (208) 345-0000 and 4320 State St., Phone: 208-384-0000. They use fresh ingredients and have great staff. They have a great beer selection and will deliver it to your house or hotel room with your pizza. In August Flying Pie offers a habanero pizza which is definitely not for the timid.
*Rockies Diner, 3900 W Overland Rd., Phone: 208-336-2878. Recently featured on the Travel Channel series "Man vs. Food," Rockies offers a eating challenge with an electric guitar as a prize for the intrepid, and great 50s-themed offerings for everyone else. 
*Big Juds, 1289 Protest Rd., Phone: 208-343-4439. Not to be outdone and with a national reputation in its own right, Big Juds offers quite possibly the biggest hamburgers in the state. They have one-pound burgers, and yeah, they do doubles. Although the burgers are big, the dining area at Big Juds is extremely small with a grand total of 10 tables and a capacity of maybe 25. There's no drive through either. If you go during peak meal times, expect to wait to get in.
*Cottonwood Grille, 913 West River Street. An amazing place to eat. With its specialties in American and Caribbean foods, it is one of the most popular places to eat in Boise. You can't go wrong.

If you are a sushi lover, the notable places are:

*Sakura, intersection of Chinden Blvd. and Eagle Road. They have the best sushi in Boise.

*Fast, affordable Argentinian cuisine that offers many varieties of freshly-made empanadas both savory and sweet. 

Drink

Boise has a surprisingly well-rounded nightlife, all stereotypes to the contrary, but once again, the best places to drink are all downtown. On Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights, throngs of young women in midriff-baring outfits (no matter the weather) and young men strutting their stuff cruise downtown bars.

*Very busy local independent downtown hangout, rustic northwest food & beer. Focus on local organic products and 30 beers on tap from small batch regional brewers. The above standard "pub grub" fare is also vegetarian friendly. 

* Red Feather Lounge Sibling of next door's watering hole Bittercreek, these two bars/restaurants share a bathroom and a patio, but just about nothing else. Red Feather is a swanky, low-lit lounge with a amazing three story, award winning wine selection. Red Feather's menu emphasizes products that thrive in the southwest Idaho region. Both have freshly made cocktails and share an outdoor see-and-be-seen patio on the pedestrian friendly 8th street corridor. 
*Bardenay, the first restaurant in the nation to include a distillery, features hand crafted cocktails of the finest ingredients. Bardenay distills rum, vodka and gin and uses them all in their drinks. This bar has an outdoor patio and a cool, laid-back vibe.

*When the owners of a then-nondescript Boise Bench neighborhood watering hole were sued by a lawyer neighbor over a residential dispute in the 1980s, they turned the experience into some free publicity and a theme for their business. Known citywide for its excellent bar food (as well as for turning lawyer jokes into a veritable cottage industry), today Crescent No Lawyers is one of the city's largest sports bars.

*Dirty Little Roddy's - Maybe a little what you might expect; Country music, sawhorse tables, peanuts and a mechanical bull that ladies can ride for free. You might not expect that this bar is popular with college kids and is nearly impossible to get into on a weekend night. It's in the basement, so be prepared to walk drunk up a narrow flight of stairs if you plan on spending any time here.

*China Blue - Owned by the same man as DLR, China Blue is the resident dance club, playing hip-hop music and catering to college-goers. There's an obligatory VIP section, as well as a bed and a gong to alert patrons to the presence of a big tipper. There is usually a cover, and drinks are expensive, especially for Boise, but on the up-side, the ladies restroom has a private champagne bar and bartender, so any annoying boys with too much bling can wait outside while you drink in the bathroom.

*Mulligans - A typical would-be Irish dive bar with a very distinctive, but not altogether unpleasant smell. There's pool, of course, but also airhockey and foosball. And $1 well shots sometimes. It's a great place to enjoy a drink on the patio and people-watch.

*10th Street Station - Located in the basement of the Idanha Hotel (now apartments) you can experience the relaxed crowd, friendly staff, and charm of a former speakeasy. As long as you don't ask for a 'pint' (only 10 oz glasses are served) you'll be welcome to stay the night. Note that they generally close early at 1:30AM.

*Neurolux - The stiffest drinks in Boise, bartenders here use a five-count pour, instead of the standard three-count, so yes, that is a rum and coke, even though it is clear. Arguably the best jukebox in town, featuring Charlie Parker, George Jones, Beastie Boys, The Ramones, Wilco, and the Rolling Stones. And that's not even the best, just the ones you're most likely to know. The clientele are about as varied as their tastes in music, so nobody is judgmental of anyone else, just what's playing on the jukebox. This is the place for indie rock shows, if you couldn't tell. The biggest bands played here before they played the arenas. Beware, it is always dark at "The 'Lux," despite the big picture window letting in sunlight (they have black blinds for when it's too bright for Rock&Roll).

*Grainey's and J.T. Toad's--Across the street from China Blue and Dirty Little Roddy's, these twin bars (on two levels of the same building) typically charge a cover but provide relatively cheap beverages once inside. In addition, there are often two live bands playing, one on each level. The basement band typically cajoles more bar-hoppers into dancing than its upstairs counterpart. While somewhat low on atmosphere, these bars can be a lively stop, particularly for the younger crowd. Note that Grainey's may be the oldest 'original' bar in boise - great charm for a happy-hour drink.

*ReefWorshiping the Tiki pioneers past and present... The Reef is Boise's Tiki outpost. Along with tasty Pupu's, a good menu and freshly made exotic drinks the Reef has plenty of live music. Terrific rooftop patio with full service outdoor bar.

*Leku Ona, downtown on 6th, is a Basque restaurant with a good bar and home to a slightly older set than the rest of the downtown scene.

*Pengilly's Saloon is also home to the slightly older crowd and smoke free. Most nights have live music, usually jazz or alt-country. There are pub quiz and open mic nights.

* Montego Bay Located off State Street, on Lake Harbor Ln., you can't miss the billboards that show the way. Montego Bay is a bar and restaurant with a dock on the water, open from May until September-ish. The drinks and food are kind of expensive, but the ambiance is great, and if you're a non-smoker, the open air dock is a good way to escape the smelly smoke of the inside. There is a dance floor in the building, and patio furniture outside, with tableside service, and outdoor bars.

* Mr. Lucky's, on Chinden, is a step above the dive bar. They have live bands on Friday and Saturday nights; sometimes good, sometimes not, but always loud. The drinks are affordable, and if you sit at the bar, the bartenders are usually friendly.

* The Emerald Club, one of 3 Gay Bars in Boise. The others are The Balcony and The Lucky Dog 415 South 9th Street, 208-342-5446

* The Balcony, the most well known gay bar in Boise, The Balcony is so named for its wrap around, open-air balcony, right above the pedestrian center of downtown (beautiful view). The dance floor is big and has two separate raised areas for dancing in the limelight, and the latest remix of the latest Gaga song is sure to play twice. The drinks are of average strength, but keep your eyes open for the best drag show in town!

Latin
*Big Als, 1900 N. Eagle Rd., Meridian, ID 83646 , (208)780-6118 Located within the upscale "The Village" in Meridian, this exciting venue hosts the most dynamic Salsa nights in town - "Salsa Loca". You'll be dancing to the intoxicating beats of Salsa, Bachata, Cumbia, Reggaeton, and Merengue from 9:30pm - 1am. Starting the night is a beginner dance lesson at 8:30pm, for all you newbies out there. It's an all ages event, so all are welcome. Three bars, 50' wall of tv screens, huge dance floor, beautiful patio, and even a swank bowling alley and arcade sit adjacent to the dance area.

 Sleep 

*Cambria Suites Boise, 2970 West Elder St, +1 208 344-7444 (+1 208 344-7446) A completely non-smoking hotel for business travelers located near the Boise Airport and three miles away from Boise State University. Cambria Suites is now closed and is operating as a Holiday Inn Express.

*The Grove Hotel, 245 S Capitol Blvd, A part of the Coast Hotels chain, it's probably the highest end hotel in Boise. 

* Free breakfast and light dinner. Free high-speed Internet.

* Hotel 43, 981 Grove St, +1 208 342-4622 (+1 208 344-5751) A boutique hotel in downtown Boise. Formerly known as Statehouse Inn. Renovated and reopened in winter, 2006.

Stay Safe

Boise has a lower than average crime rate for a city of its size, and violent crime is quite rare, but reasonable precautions such as locking car doors and securing valuables are always wise. Women should use caution if on the Greenbelt area alone at night.

Natural disasters are also rare in Boise, but be aware of fog in the winter months while driving, which can set in suddenly and be very thick. Winter storms can be a major issue in the city

Boise is friendly to LGBT persons, and has an anti-discrimination ordinance extending to sexual orientation, but areas of Idaho outside Boise may not be as friendly. Outright hostility or violence are extremely unlikely however, and for the most part all of Idaho will generally "live and let live".

Get out

* Table Rock Take a trip to Table Rock, located directly above downtown Boise, to see the spectacular view overlooking the city and the entire valley. You can see herds of deer and elk frolicking through the rolling hills. There are two options which make this site accessible to different types of people: You can drive up the winding roads to the summit or take a more vigorous route up the steeper slope starting in the Old Idaho Penitentiary parking lot. The moderately difficult hike takes anywhere between 20 to 45 minutes to complete and is most popular in the morning and afternoon amongst natives.

* Camel's Back Park Camel's Back is another popular hiking spot close to the city. A good location for mountain bikers and hikers alike, people with dogs are a common sight in the park at the base of the hill and elsewhere. An initial very steep descent up the front of the hill or the more frequented staircase on the side quickly levels out and rewards hikers with a stunning vista of the Boise area. This hike is particularly rewarding in the fall, as the leaves of the City of Trees turn.
