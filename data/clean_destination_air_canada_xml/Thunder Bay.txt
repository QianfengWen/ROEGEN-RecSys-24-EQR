Thunder Bay lies at the far northwestern point of the Great Lakes of , and is a transportation bridge between the rich agricultural of and the Atlantic Ocean and the rest of the world. The population of Thunder Bay is 122,907 (2006 census).

Get in
Thunder Bay is on Trans-Canada Highway 11 and 17. From the east, it is a 7-8 hour (700 km) drive from , and from the west, it is a 7-8 hour (720 km) drive from . From the US, Thunder Bay is about a 6-hour drive from /.

Thunder Bay has not been served by passenger rail since 1989 due to a politically motivated right-of-way dispute between Via Rail and Canadian Pacific Railways.

Thunder Bay has a commercial airport that lies approximately 15 minutes west of the downtown center. There is one Transit bus that passes by every 30-40 minutes during the week and on weekends. Hotel shuttles are also available for the Airlane Travelodge Hotel and the Valhalla Inn Hotel.

Get around
Thunder Bay isn't known for being a walkable city. This is largely due to its Twin-Cities heritage which causes the city to be very spread out. Until 1970, the city was actually two separate large communities (Fort William and Port Arthur) separated by a swamp that has since been built up. The city council seems to finally, in recent years, be developing the north end (Port Arthur) into an entertainment district with Marina Park as its centerpiece, and the south end (Fort William) into a business district. Within each of these districts (North end and South end downtown cores) walking is certainly viable in the non-winter months. During the winter months, it can be much harder. It can get quite cold in Thunder Bay, so you should dress accordingly.
As a result of this, your best way to get between these two zones is by bus. Up-to-date schedules are available on Thunder Bay Transit's official website.

Alternatively, there are multiple taxi services.

The city is increasingly focused on expanding its network of bicycle paths as well. Transport by inline skates can work well on these paths, but sidewalks are often too mottled to afford any speed or efficiency on skates.

South End

*This is a greek restaurant that has strayed from a core-greek menu to include decent burger-and-fry combos. If you really want delish, get the Chicken Souvlaki with Fries or Greek Salad. They're light on the fries though, so you might want to ask them to double up. You should specify think for the milkshakes.

Popular with highschool students and business people alike at lunch due to it's proximity to both a public and catholic high school as well as city hall and the civic centre.

*Blue Door Cafe is a breakfast and lunch spot. Good coffee and occasionally offers live music during the lunch hour.

North End
*For a unique dining experience, visit Thunder Bay's famed Finnish restaurant, The Hoito. On weekend mornings, it is packed with locals of all ages, families and friends eating together, delicious Finnish pancakes. The Hoito is a beloved Thunder Bay institution!

*The Thai Kitchen is easily Thunder Bay's best choice for Thai food. Originally only providing catering and special events food, the actual restaurant opened for the first time in 2007 and it is getting busier. If you want very reasonably priced food and you like Thai, this is the place. The husband and wife owners are friendly, both speak Thai (one is an immigrant from Northern Thailand) and it's hard to spend more than $20 per person and not feel like to over-ate!

Showing up before the dinner rush (5-5:30PM) is a good idea on Friday and Saturday nights. You'll get more prompt service and the cooks will have more time to spend on your food. Most main dishes are $9 and come with rice or noodles. Try the Kaeng Penang (#33)! 

*Silver Birch provides Canadian dishes and features local ingredients including fish and game.

*Bistro One offers excellent fine dining.

*Prospector, in downtown Port Arthur, is a fantastic steakhouse. With an amazing cut of Prime Rib, fantastic sides, and a delicious soup and salad bar, The Prospector is the place to be.

*Thunder Bay has a couple of sushi places: Wasabi and Sushi Bowl. They are tasty, but visitors from larger cosmopolitan centres or the coast will likely be disappointed as sushi is much more expensive than they may be accustomed to. Sushi is approximately twice the price here as in Toronto for example.

*Thunder Bay is also famous for a unique pastry donut called a Persian. A Persian is similar to a danish with a mysterious pink icing. Some say the icing is strawberry, others say it is cherry, but it certainly is pink. Most people eat their persians just as they are, but for a special treat, have yours cut, buttered and grilled/toasted.
