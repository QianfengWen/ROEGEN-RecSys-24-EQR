Surabaya is the capital of and the 2nd largest city in .

Understand

The story goes that Surabaya's name derives from the Javanese words Suro, meaning shark, and Boyo, meaning crocodile. With around 3 million people in its city proper area, and over 6 million people in its metropolitan area, unpretentious Surabaya is the second-largest city in , but it's a little lacking in sights. However, many people come here on business, and Surabaya is also a gateway city for and . The city's tree-lined streets, street parks and renovated pavements will impress those newly arrived from other cities in the archipelago, though in general the city's attractions tend to be more apparent to those who make it their home rather than to short-term visitors.

Climate

Very tropical and you need to wear casual, light clothes: t-shirts, shorts, sandals or shoes. Temperatures are not varying much through the year, with daytime highs around 32-36 degrees Celsius, falling at night to 22-26 degrees. During the rainy season (November-April) be prepared for occasional flash floods and traffic jams, although it's not as bad as Jakarta.

Talk

The national language, Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian), is the medium of government, commerce and education. Many locals also speak the regional language, Javanese (sometimes with a local accent). There is a surprising amount of English visible in Surabaya on advertising and signs, and English is the most widely understood foreign language.

Get In

By plane

Surabaya's Juanda Airport (SUB) is the second busiest in the country after Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta, with very frequent flights to and other major Indonesian destinations, as well as some direct international flights to destinations including , , , , , , and . Terminal 2 has opened on February 14, 2014, and all international flights and some domestic flights have moved here from the older Terminal 1. Holders of eligible passports arriving on international flights can arrange visa-on-arrival at Terminal 2.

Officially, you're supposed to buy fixed-fare taxi coupons from the taxi stands for the 18 km trip into town, around US$10-15 depending on your exact destination. If you choose to save time by taking the toll road from the airport, the toll charges will be extra. In practice you may be able to get a driver dropping off passengers to pick you up. There are 2 choices available: Sedan type accommodates 4-5 pax and SUV type 6-7 pax or if you have lots of baggage. If you're going further away (eg. ), it'll be cheaper to a rent a car with a driver instead.

There is an Airport Bus service operated by DAMRI (same company as in Jakarta), which goes to the Bungurasih bus station. Buses stop in front of the terminal, are air-conditioned and reasonably comfortable, ticket costs Rp 25.000 (as of January 2020). The bus terminal, however, is hectic and is only slightly closer to the city center than the airport - going there makes sense only if you continue by bus to another city (e.g. Malang, Probolinggo), or do not mind continuing in a local bus.

There used to be a large viewing gallery on the top of the airport terminal (accessible directly from outside), but it has now been closed and converted into a transit hotel.

By train

Surabaya has two main stations, Surabaya Pasar Turi and Surabaya Gubeng. Seats in eksekutif (first class) and bisnis (second class) for any intercity journey can be reserved up to 30 days in advance at any major railway station in Java.

By boat

* PT Angkutan Sungai Danau dan Penyeberangan(ASDP): daily ferry service from Ujung Kamal, Madura to Tanjung Perak, Surabaya.

* PT Pelayaran Nasional Indonesia (PELNI) passenger ships from many major port cities throughout Indonesia to Tanjung Perak.

There is a public city bus that goes through the city to the main bus terminal for intercity connections. (Rp.10,000 or less if you go shorter way) The departure spot is about 5 min. walk from the port - just follow the crowd or ask people.

By bus

Surabaya has frequent bus connections from all parts of East Java and from major cities in other parts of and beyond. The main bus terminal is at Bungurasih, about 10 km south of the city. There are frequent shuttle buses from (Rp 20.000 for air conditioned, less for "ekonomi") and (for Mount Bromo), so just turn up. Long-haul bus journeys are best booked in advance.

There are many people inside the terminal trying to solicit passengers to the bus of the company from which they get a commission, and they are especially bothersome to the foreigners. If you follow them to the bus, you are likely to get offered an inflated (Rp 200.000 or even more to Bali) price, even though there's an official price list (you can see it at the exit to the platform). Ticket offices do not guarantee you to be safe from overcharging - most of them are private, and there's no price posted on the window, so shop around. It may make sense to bargain if the price is certainly too high. Prices may be slightly higher during high demand periods like weekends and public holidays.

To in , fair price is Rp 100,000-120.000 by eksekutif night bus, including the ferry trip between and , mineral water and a meal. Buses depart from Bungurasih bus terminal in Surabaya, and arrive in Gubeng bus terminal in . Duration: in 10-12 hr.

Ticket to should cost Rp 130.000-150.000 in eksekutif bus - however the trip may be extremely tedious. The road is one of the busiest in Indonesia - despite that, much of it has only one lane in each direction, and there are lots of slow heavy trucks. There will be 3 or 4 rest stops on the way (20-30 minutes each), and at least some traffic jams near Jakarta, so even in an express bus what was advertised as 13-14 hours journey could easily turn into 18 or even 20. Recently the Trans-Java expressway had been opened, and there are currently "Trans-Java" buses that could take you to Jakarta in 10 hours, with one stop. Costs are around Rp250.000 or more, depending on weekday/weekend.

By minibus

Another option is to go by minibus (known in Indonesia as travel). A number of companies run door-to-door minibus services from and to major destinations in , including and . These services are both more convenient and more expensive than public buses. Seats can be booked in advance through company offices, and also through many hotels and travel agents.

Get around

As the public transportation is not good compared to other big cities in Indonesia such as , , and even , cars and ride-hailing are the best option when it comes to traveling around the city.

By taxi

Taxis are plentiful on the streets of Surabaya. Some taxis are not renowned for their reliability so stick to the well known firms: Blue Bird Group ☎+62 31 3721234, Silver ☎+62 31 5625555. Always insist on a metered fare, though the above firms will generally turn theirs on as a matter of course. Figure on Rp 40,000 for a cross-town trip and Rp 100,000 to the airport. 

Fares for almost all firms are Rp 7000 flag fall (including the first kilometer) and Rp 500 for every subsequent 100m or minute stuck in traffic. Most companies apply a minimum fare for phone orders. For taxis hailed from the street or taken from most ranks, there is no minimum fare so just pay what the meter reads. Fares are always rounded up to the nearest Rp 1000, and small tips are appreciated (though not mandatory). If the meter reads less than Rp 10,000, it is considered polite to round the fare up to this.

A trip from Stasiun Gubeng to Pasar Keputran should cost around RP 20,000.

GrabCar and Go-Car (also GrabBike and Go-Jek for its motor equivalent) are also in use throughout the city. However, the cars are not permitted to enter several places (for pick-up) such as Purabaya Bus Station and Juanda Airport.

By train

Commuter city trains are extremely limited, serving only a little part of Surabaya, Sidoarjo, Pasuruan, and Lamongan. There are only 3 daily trips from Surabaya to Bangil (located in Pasuruan Regency), and 2 trips daily to Lamongan.

Stay Safe

As with any big city, never let your guard down, because big cities such as Surabaya have a reputation among Indonesians for a mid crime rate. That said, Surabaya has few real dangers for visitors apart from the perils of crossing the very busy roads (the secret is to raise an arm while crossing, and to progress with a predictable speed and bearing, allowing the traffic to flow around you). Don't walk on the streets, especially at night other than the CBD area, if you can avoid it since you won't have anything to sightsee. The streets are pedestrian friendly, many sidewalks had been built throughout the years and has made Surabaya a great place for pedestrians. Very few locals walk around, not even if they have to go to the next street. Bring along your face mask if you travel by foot during rush hour since the traffic will be chaos and the air pollution is bad. (Around 4.30 PM to 6.30 PM) Be polite to the people, since Surabayans tend to swear easily which are very common. Do not easily trust people you have just met, even if they look friendly. Be prepared for lots of staring since people will recognize you as a foreigner.

Stay Healthy

By net

If you have your own laptop, it may run free wifi networks at many malls. Ask at the information desk for access codes. Free hotspots are also available in most restaurants and cafes. Several hotels also provide free hotspots in their lobby. All major hotels provide internet access in one or more ways; simply ask them about this when you make your booking.

Alternatively, if you have a compatible 3G mobile phone and a laptop, tethering to your PC is the quickest way to gain internet access although speeds might not impress. Note that prepaid SIM cards can be purchased very easily and cheaply, and that service activation is completed on the user's phone very quickly. Once activated, recharge with credits as necessary. Internet access is usually available at this stage; refer to your phone's user manual for tethering instructions. Operators will usually offer internet packets that offer cheaper access fees - instructions to access these services are available in the booklet that comes with your SIM card (i.e. XL's services are accessible by dialing *123#). BlackBerry Internet Service is readily available and can be registered similarly on the prepaid SIM.

Internet cafes are available in many parts of the city with a price of Rp 4,000-Rp 5,000 per hour. However, most of them only have dial-up capabilities. Most of the internet cafes can be found around universities, and in most shopping malls.

Internet speeds in Surabaya are rarely fast, regardless of your connection. They are usually sufficient to make decent Skype voice calls, although HD video calling may not be possible. Temporarily disabling software updates (Windows Update, security software updates, Adobe Updater, etc.) may help maximise access speeds.
