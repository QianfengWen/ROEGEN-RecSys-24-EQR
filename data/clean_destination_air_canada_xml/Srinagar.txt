Srinagar is the summer capital of the Indian state of and the largest city in the Kashmir region.

Understand

The city has become safer to travel since 2003, however the streets are still lined with armed soldiers. Any building of value will also have a sandbag bunker and razor wire for protection. If arriving from the airport, you will also notice hundreds of large, Western style vacation homes. These were built before the current conflict when domestic travel to Kashmir was booming. Currently most of these homes are empty, being squatted in or have been usurped for military use. Most people visit the city in the summer months. The temperature at this time is cool to pleasant. Light sweaters may be needed for occasional cool nights in the summertime. In winter, you will need full winter gear and expect snow and few places to have hot water.

Climate: Srinagar features a humid subtropical climate, heavily influenced by the Himalayas which surround the city on all sides. It is the coldest major city in , as winters are very cold for the country's standards. Temperatures range from -2°C (28°F) to 7°C (44°F) and with occasional cold waves that can push nighttime lows below -5°C (23°F). The lowest recorded temperature is -20°C (-4°F). By wary that the city faces frequent snowfalls and the highway to the rest of the country can be blocked due to icy roads and avalanches. Summers are pleasantly warm, in sharp contrast with the rest of India, and afternoon temperatures usually top 30°C (86°F). Heat waves are very uncommon, as the record high is only 38°C (100°F). The city is also not affected by the summer monsoon. Overall, Srinagar is a place that you can visit year-round (if you don't mind the chilly weather in the winter) and it is very good get away from the extreme heat and high moisture of the rest of India.

See

The Mughal Gardens With terraced lawns, cascading fountains, paint-box-bright flowerbeds with the panorama of the Dal in front of them - the three Mughal Gardens of Chesmashahi, Nishat and Shalimar are the Mughal Emperors' concept of paradise and are today very popular places for picnics and excursions. The beauty of these gardens is at their best during spring but the Mughal structure of these gardens lends them a unique sense of beauty even when the flowers are not blossoming.

*Situated on the banks of the Dal Lake, with the Zabarwan Mountains as its backdrop, (11 km. from TRC), this 'garden of bliss' commands a magnificent view of the lake and the snow capped Pir Panjal mountain range which stands far away to the west of the valley. Nishat was designed in 1633 AD by Asaf Khan, brother of Nur Jehan.

*the Mughal garden in front of the Dal lake built by Emperor Jahangir.

*is another beautiful Mughal garden.

*the white mosque is breathtakingly beautiful but be careful, as women can enter only the first part of the mosque. Also take a walk through the adjacent market area with a range of great fresh food and a thousand things deep fried.

*a brick-and-wood mosque originally built in the end of 14th century. Extraordinary architecture and an amazing site. Houses 30.000 devotees for prayer inside, and another 70.000 using the inside court and surrounding areas. Historically very important for Srinagar. 

*in the Khanyar area, about 150 m NW of Dastgir Saheb mosque &amp; shrine. This tomb, also known as Roza Bal, is believed by some to be the tomb of Jesus (part of the larger theory that he survived the crucifixion and made his way to Kashmir where he lived until at least the age of 100). It has been made popular by recent books such as Jesus Lived in India by Holger Kersten among others. It's down a little side road - ask around, pretty much anyone in the area can point you in the right direction. It was closed in September 2011 and sealed, photography and videography are not permitted.

*Is a Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva on a hilltop. It can be reached by a car or taxi. No cameras or cellphones are allowed within the temple and you are supposed to leave them in the vehicle before entering the temple premises. Cigarattes, liquor are to be deposited with the police personnel before the ascent of the hill as these items are against Hindu religion. Locals from Dal Gate say there are 250 steps to reach the temple but it is yet to be confirmed. The temple is visible from Dal Lake Area. 

*a several hundred years old garden overlooking the Dal lake. Don't miss the breathtaking views of the city from here.

*A well maintained park with lake by Dept of Floriculture with organised parking lot next to Park. The park occupies a large area and has a beverage shop run by the J&amp;K Tourism department. They serve hot and flavoured "Kahva", a traditional drink of Kashmir. A cup costs Rs 25. The nearby Tulip Park only has seasonal access. There is adequate parking adjacent to the park.

*Visit the ruins located on the outskirts of Srinagar on way to Gulmarg. See the palaces of Kahmir's Buddhist and Hindu rulers and Buddhist places of worship.

* Old Town

Do

All the hotels organize excursions (1, 2, 4 days) to see the Himalayan mountains. Beside that package tours by JKTDC can be a good option. Using an honest guide or fixer can potentially save you money on goods and accomodation.

Go for a Shikara ride in the Dal lake which costs around Rs 150 (off season) - Rs 500 (peak season) for the whole Shikara. For better views and a more peaceful ride in an area devoid of other tourists, walk up a fair bit of distance till you can see the fountain and ask the Shikara rider to take you for a ride to the fountain. It costs Rs 300 (off season) - Rs 600 (peak season). Make sure you bargain a little, especially in off season. If you are staying longer, you could go on shikara rides more than once... each time to a different part of the lake. A must see is the "village" in the lake. Ask for a ride to the side where locals live and see the floating vegetable market. The market is usually operational only at sunrise and is easiest organised through an agent or your hotel/houseboat.

Paragliding
This is a must try, enjoy the thrills of paragliding in Srinagar. You don't need to be an expert in flying a glider , you can try the tandem flight together with a trained pilot which is a 15 min ride or the long 1 hour+ XC Cross country Ride.

These high altitude alpine lakes have no access by any transport, they include Vishansar Lake, Nundkol Lake, Tarsar Lake, Gadsar Lake, Satsar Lake and so on. Many trekking units organize and operate trekking packages to these mountain lakes at affordable rates.

Buy

* One more important point to note for tourists having passion for shopping is when you hire an auto rickshaw, please mention that you want to go to Lal Chowk Ghantaghar only for shopping. As most of the Auto Rickshaws will insist you that there is nothing in Lal Chowk and go to Whole Sale market instead. This is because, the prices at the so called wholesale market are much inflated as they pay at least 20% commission to those auto rickshaws. Also, there are very few shops.

*a huge market ranging more than a kilometer selling everything from handicraft through bed sheets to electronics and food and clothes

If you stay in one of the houseboats, make sure that you do not get lured by the local vendors posing as whole-sale stone jewelry sellers. Their prices are highly inflated. Their sole aim is to swindle you of as much money as possible in the name of "authentic stone crafted jewels". There is a whole sale jewelry shop right across the street once you reach the main road of the Dal Lake and that's the right place for shopping.

Handicraft

You can buy nice leather products, or jewellery. Carpets. 

Chainstich rugs There are rugs in two styles; English design or Kilim design. It will be evident what is meant when you see them. 

You can also buy embroidered felt mats called Namdahs but the colours of the wool may be a bit too bright in most shops

Cashmere (Pashmina) shawls Have been manufactured in Kashmir for thousands of years. Pashmina Shawls are very popular items for sale in the Valley, but make sure to test the quality before purchasing. The test for a 100% pashmina has been warmth, feel and the passing of the shawl through a wedding ring. Costs on a true pashmina can vary wildly, but usually start around Rs 6,000. Secondly, the weave pattern on a good Pashmina is fainter than on a "silk Pashmina" or other wool Pashmina. There is also lower grades of pashmina known as Semi-Pashmina (10-50% pashmina wool) and Half-Pashmina (50% pashmina wool) which are still of an exceptional quality but much lower price (Rs 1,000-3,000). Also check if they are machine woven or hand woven (look for irregularities in the wool to spot a hand woven), hand woven are stronger due to the density of the weave and cost. 

Paper Machie products Quite unique to Kashmir with colourful motifs and design on them. They are seen everywhere and resemble pottery in shape and design. Blooming Dale in Dalgate area have a vast collection of Papier Machie products.

* They will take you through in detail the types of pashminas you can buy (and how to test them) and are fantastic in that they don't negotiate but offer a set price.

*. The Government Emporia supplies might be better than some the private shops when in comes to embroided felt mats (Namdahls).

There are a number of the restaurants and cafes in Srinagar. Most of the good ones are located in Lal chowk or on Boulevard along the banks of the Dal Lake. Most of the restaurants will serve Kashmiri, Indian, Mughlai and 'Indianized' Chinese dishes. Some pure veg restaurants are also located along Boulevard. 

Make sure you try dishes like Rogan-gosht (meat cooked in red gravy), Gushtaba(soft meat balls cooked in natural yoghurt),Rishta (Soft Meat Balls in delicious Gravy), Tabakmaaz(deep fried ribs of a lamb) and Kanti(small chunks of meat cooked with a lot of onions). All these Meat Items are usually eaten with Rice, hence the gravy is not thick.

Another popular local delicacy called Seekh-tuji consists of marinated meat pieces which are freshly barbecued and eaten with chutney. Most of these vendors are located in the Khayaam region of the city. This place is usually teeming with the youth especially in the evenings.

Sleep

Srinagar is popular for its houseboats, which do not float free around the lake, but are anchored off-shore. It is a great and unique way to enjoy your stay in the city. Houseboats are accessible either by road, or by a short "Shikara" boat ride. Each houseboat usually has 2-5 bedrooms plus bath, dining room, living room, upper deck (good for sunbathing). 

Many travelers tell stories of bad experiences while staying on a houseboat, others enjoy their stay greatly. To avoid bad experiences do not pre-book a houseboat before arriving. With the security situation, the majority are empty and you should be able to get a better price in person, and to get a better feeling of if you'll like the place and the owners. Boats with land access have the advantage of allowing you to leave if you feel uncomfortable, or just like going for a walk, although they tend to be noisier if close to Dal Gate.

There are houseboats on Dal Lake and Nigeen Lake. These can cost anything from Rs 1,000 (March 2008) - Rs 5,000 depending upon the time of the year. Houseboats on Nagin lake are upscale and more expensive but are much more beautiful, and the Nigeen lake location is serene. Price on Nigeen Lake per person in Sept 2005 was Rs 500 per night including 2 meals. Expect to pay up to Rs 3,000 for a couple on the deluxe boats. Boats on the Jhelum river are cheaper yet, but still comfortable, and close to the bus station, good if you are just transiting Srinagar to or from .

Be sure to take a 1 hour boat tour of the lake inlets to get a nice glimpse of life and wildlife along the lake. Prices are about Rs 300-500 per trip. A few areas are geared up for attracting tourists, but most much of the area is still reasonably untouched. 

There are a wide range of hotels around Dal Lake. Prices vary from Rs 500-5,000.
