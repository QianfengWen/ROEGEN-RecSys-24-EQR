Aswan (Arabic: أسوان‎ Aswān) is a city in the south of , some 680km (425 miles) south of , just below the Aswan Dam and Lake Nasser, with a population of 275,000. Aswan is far more relaxed and smaller than and .

Understand 
Aswan is the smallest of the three major tourist cities on the Nile. Being the furthest south of the three, it has a large population of Nubian people, mostly resettled from their homeland in the area flooded by Lake Nasser. Aswan is the home of many granite quarries from which most of the Obelisks seen in were sourced. Aswan was the ancient Egyptians' gateway to .

Get in

By plane

Aswan International Airport is situated 25km SSW of the city, on the west bank and just south of the high dam and takes roughly 30-40 minutes of travel time. Public buses don't go to the airport and security on the approach road to the terminal is tight so keep your passport and proof of ticket handy. Taxis in Aswan are not metered, so you should agree to a price before the taxi starts moving. The normal daytime tourist fare should be around 100 EGP (~USD $5.50, November 2018) during the day, and 130-150 EGP at night. This has increased to 400 EGP for a taxi from the airport to the ferry terminal near Elephantine Island (October 2023). Note that the taxi rank guy will start prices at 900 EGP but offer 350 and walk away if they do not budge. Make sure you agree the price is for all people otherwise they might say it is per person at the end of your trip.

Several airlines operate services to Aswan International Airport including EgyptAir (to/from , , ), LotusAir (to/from ), and NileAir (to/from ).

Do not go to Aswan airport more than 2 hours before your flight. Because the airport may only have one flight, the security may not let you into the airport (even to the check-in area, until 2 hours before the flight.

By train

Egypt's passenger train service runs along the Nile between and . Travel time from is around three hours on 1st/2nd class AC services.More than five trains AC service arrives from each day, journey time to is around 13-14 hours costing 75LE for second class, 113LE first class recommending booking in advance and avoid black market offers from the people around the station . In addition there are two sleeper trains, departing 8PM and 9:35PM from Cairo's main train station "Ramsis train station" you can easily reach it by Metro "Elshohadaa Metro station", prices start from US $120 Single/$100 Double (Mar 2014). Some travel agencies in Cairo might be able to get $90 for Double.

Technically foreigners are not allowed to buy tickets for non-sleeper trains from Cairo to Luxor or Aswan. This flawed security measure can easily be ignored by using a self service ticket machince or simply buying a ticket on the train. The latter options includes an insignificant surcharge of a few LE but is perfectly legal, legitimate and common practice. You will not have a reserved seat if buying the ticket on the train however, so you may be moved around once or twice.

To Luxor (3-4 hours):
1 class / 2 class trains (50 LE / 25 LE):
5:30, 7:00, 15:00, 16:15, 19:45, 20:00, 21:30.
3 class trains (10 LE):
0:00, 9:00, 13:00, 20:15, 22:45
(Mar 2015)

The train station is on the northern end of the city center, a few hundred meters inland from the river. Leave plenty of time to buy tickets, as the service at the counters is very slow. Mini buses depart from outside the station (turn right as you exit the terminal), and there are a number of cafes and basic hotels on the blocks between the station and the river.

By car
It is now possible to drive from Aswan to Sudan. There is a border crossing west of Lake Nasser which is open of 01/17. The other crossing, from Wadi Halfa involves taking a daily ferry (other than Friday) from Qustul across Lake Nasser to Abu Simbel.

By bus

From 

"8 March 2016" There's bus move to from main bus station Al-torjoman 17:00 clock price is 130LE + 10LE "if they discover you are foreigner" the price and date must be printed on the ticket in english numbers to avoid mistakes. Tickets can be purchased at the Al-torjoman bus station from upper company window. "not recommended because the bus arrives to the next day 09:30 AM if the driver is fast it arrives at main bus station 3km north of train station take a taxi for 10LE or shared taxi for 1LE to the town.

"8 March 2016" Several lines go to from Ahmed Helmy bus station behind railway station building. "not recommending at all even the Egyptians avoiding this old dirty costly buses"

From 

There is one direct bus (AC Volvo) that goes to from leaving at 22:00 every evening operated by a company called StarJet and takes approximately 9 hours with 3 to 4 fifteen minute breaks along the way. The coach leaves from Zahran bus station at Al-Nasr Street in Hurghada town centre and costs 70LE. Note that at least as of October 2016 only those with Egyptian nationality are permitted to travel on this StarJet coach. If a non-Egyptian is found on the coach StarJet is fined 50,000LE by the Egyptian authorities so they will not give tickets to anyone who cannot prove their Egyptian nationality until the restriction is lifted. For non-Egyptians, the only coach option is to travel from Hurghada to Luxor and then from Luxor to Aswan.

"8 March 2016" There's another bus come from at 22:30 and another 00:30 midnight come from and both maybe stop in to drop off some people (upper Egypt company), the bus is often come crowded and people stand in the bus aisle and it's really impossible to occupy a set buses cost 70LE. Tickets are sold on the bus if you fight well and win a seat, but be sure to ask the price at the ticket office, because the ticket seller on the bus will often raise the price 10LE or so and pocket the excess if he discover that you are a foreigner or non Arabic speaker, take in consider that you maybe wait 2 hours or more before the bus arrive and maybe the bus come full and nobody will drop off in so to the driver use ring road and avoid station.

Other indirect way to go to from if you don't like night travel is to take the 8:30AM bus to for 50LE, which takes 3 hours. The company name is "Superjet" beside Zahran store at Al-nasr st. when you arrive run to the train station north from the bus station to catch the train because if you missed it you will wait few hours to the next train to for 30LE if you find the ticket in the booking window about 40 if you go to the train without booking that's mean maybe you don't have seat and 50LE from the black market sellers around he station and that not recommended maybe sold you a ticket for a train left the station and other ticks you don't need it just avoid that.

To/From 

It is now possible to take a bus between Aswan and , Sudan. Some buses overnight in Wadi Halfa while others use the new border crossing west of Lake Nasser and therefore drive through the night taking up to 27 hours for the whole journey. Cost is around 500EGP.

By boat

The River Nile as it passes through Dozens of cruise ships travel between and . Aswan-Luxor takes 3 nights while Luxor-Aswan takes 4 nights. As of Mar 2014, boats depart from Aswan 3 days per week. These can be booked through booking.com or agents or at the actual ships themselves. 

Also a boat to Wadi Halfa in departs once a week on Sundays (Feb 2014). Tickets go on sale on Monday for the following sunday and sell out quickly. 

Alternatively instead of waiting in for a week, a fixer can be used to arrange a Sudan visa in 15 minutes, a spot on the boat (Even on the actual day of sailing) and help getting through the terminal. Price would be between 50-100 EP for the service.

Get around

Aswan is compact enough to negotiate primarily on foot. To access Philae, the High Dam, and the unfinished obelisks, you can take a taxi or a horse-drawn carriage. A taxi excursion to all of these sights should cost 80LE to 100LE per vehicle.

To access the sights on the river islands or on the West Bank, you will need to cross the river by motor boat or felluca. Be sure to pay attention to the price as operators try to overcharge tourists.
If you take the public ferry to the West Bank, you pay only 5LE.

See

Aswan Town and the East Bank

* Very well organized, features Nubian treasures recovered before the flooding of Nubia. Egypt is constantly pegging their tourist attractions prices according to the rate of Euro or Dollar, therefore the entrance fee has recently been raised to 60 and 30 LE respectively. For an 8 Euros ticket, which ain't cheap, the museum is staffed by 'guards' who are chatting or listening to music inside the museum. There is not a single guide and nobody to answer you anything. Instead of, they try to put you out at 20:30 even if the museum closes at 21:00. Not a pleasant experience. (April 2015) 

* The largest known ancient obelisk, carved directly out of bedrock. If finished it would have measured around 42m (120 feet) and would have weighed nearly 1,200 tons.

* The faded former glory of the Fatimid empire can be seen on the crumbling graveyard. Across the street from unfinished Obelisk, and across the street from Nubian Museum on the other side. There may be some aggressive children on the cemetery.

* When you're in Aswan you'll have to walk along the Kornish Al Nile (Corniche) at least once. It is a pleasant stroll, made even more pleasant by the fact that you can walk right into the Ferial Gardens at its Southern End. They are a park that is as relaxing as it is beautiful.

* When you're in Aswan you'll have to walk to see the Coptic Cathedral with a breathtaking painting Coptic art .

The River and Islands

* Nubian villages of Siou and Koti occupy this island. Also home to the famous s and the Temples of Sati, Khnum (ancient rams-head god) and Pepinakht-Heqaib. Movenpick resort is on the island. The Aswan Museum (Adult: 100LE, Student 50LE) at the southern end of the island houses items found during excavations on Elephantine Island.
Also, be careful of unsolicited tours from locals, which will result in a request for baksheesh. There is regular boat taxi to Elephantine Island run by the locals for only 2LE for one crossing but they will charge more for tourists. Put the money in the box instead of the ticket agent to avoid overpaying. 

* Lord Kitchener, who owned the 6.8 hectare island in the 1890's converted it to a botanical garden. Filled with birds and hundreds of plant species and palm trees. Accessible via a Felucca tour.The entrance fee is

* Friendly Nubian villages. Well known for its excellent beaded jewelry. Also the location of the Famine Stela. Cliff with more than 200 inscriptions from the 18th dynasty,

West Bank

* The northern hills of the west bank are filled with the rock-hewn tombs of princes from the Old Kingdom to the Roman period. The 6th Dynasty tombs, some of which form linked family complexes, contain important biographical texts. Inside, the tombs are decorated with vivid wall paintings showing scenes of everyday life, hieroglyphic biographies and inscriptions telling of the noblemen's journeys into Africa. Most of the tombs are locked or blocked off, probably by staff looking for tips.

**Note that some locals will hang around the entrance as you climb the hill, and tell you that it's closed and you need a key. They will show you a key, implying that they can help you gain access...for a small fee. Just tell them, "no thanks....just looking", and they should leave you alone.
**Tombs of Mekhu & Sabni - Reliefs show invasion of Nubia
**Tomb of Sarenput II - One of the most beautiful and preserved tombs
**Tomb of Harkhuf - Hieroglyphics
**Tomb of Hekaib - Reliefs show fighting and hunting scenes
**Tomb of Sarenput II - Six pillars decorated with reliefs
**Kubbet al Hawa - Located on the hilltop above the other tombs. Stunning views of the Nile

* Small shrine / tomb of a local sheikh and holy man. The climb is rewarded with amazing views of Aswan, the Nile river and the surrounding landscape, richly evoked in the translation from the Arabic of the place name, "the dome of the wind'.

* Tomb of the 48th iman of the Ismaili sect and his wife. Visible from the outside, although closed to the public.

* The history of the monastery of St. Simeon dates back to the 7th century, and survived long as a Christian stronghold of southern Egypt until destroyed by Saladin in 1173. While still in use it housed 300 monks, and could in addition receive up to 100 pilgrims at a time. The monastery was surrounded by a 10 metre high wall, and doubled as a fortress. Apparently, the monastery did not return to its original use after Saladin's destruction. To get here, ride a camel or walk from the Tombs of the Nobles.

Around Aswan

* Despite being a highly important piece of infrastructure, the Aswan High Dam may be a bit of a letdown. This is a typical stop among a 4-hr tour that goes to Philae and the Obelisk, which you can ask for your driver to skip.

* Built to honor Isis, this was the last ancient temple built in the the classical Egyptian architectural style. Construction began in approx 690 BC. It was moved from its original location on Philae Island, to its new location on Agilkia Island, because of the flooding to create Lake Nasser. A major multinational UNESCO team relocated Philae, and a number of other temples that now dot the shores of Lake Nasser. You can see the submerged original island a short distance away, punctuated by the steel columns used in the moving process. Note the re-use of the temple as a Christian church, with crosses carved into the older hieroglyph reliefs, and images of the Egyptian gods carefully defaced. There are grafitti dating from the 1800s. 

There is a cheesy Sound and Light show at night, with English actor voices. 

Scammers: Watch out for the guards who will do all in their power to get in your photos, (to get a tip), point out hieroglyphs that you can quite clearly see yourself (to get a tip), or invite you to 'pray' (against the rules), also for some baksheesh(tip)!

Driver from town 40LE to 100LE with wait and return. 5LE for parking the car. The entrance fee per person is 180LE. There is a boat cartel running that will overcharge you for the ride. The "official" price mentioned on a very unofficial sign by the entrance is 175LE per boat, but you won't get a receipt. They will ask you for 200LE per boat if you don't know the sign and refuse any bargaining. To save money, try to find people to share a boat BEFORE going down to the dock, otherwise they might not let you share one. Locals are charged 100LE for the boat ride to the island. The temple is beautiful and worth seeing.

* Like Philae, this temple and its surrounding ruins were moved by UNESCO to save them from the floodwaters of Lake Nasser. The main temple was built to the Nubian fertility and sun god Marul during the rule of Emperor Augustus. Don't miss the Kiosk of Qirtasi and the amazing Temple of Beit al-Wali built by Ramesses II.

* Most people use Aswan as a base to see this temple. There is a convoy that departs at 4AM, and is usually arranged by your tour agent. See article for more detail. Most hotels will arrange group transport for 60 to 70 LE per person

* Sculptors from around the world exhibit their pieces here every spring for the International Sculpture Symposium. The works are all created in Aswan (on the terrace of the Basma Hotel) and when finished brought to this site and exhibited next to each other within view of the ancient quarry.

Do

* Bikes available at many hotels. Cross the modern bridge to the east bank and bring back your bicycle afterwards by ferry boat.

* Aswan is a great place for a local cruise to the nearby islands. Two hours of felucca trip will cost you between 25-50 EP depends on your negotiation skills.
See .

* See . This is a must!

* Grab a felucca captain and they will shuttle you across to the camel marshalling area. Ride the camel to the Monastery of St Simeon.

* You will get a fascinating insight into their daily lives, and they love to practise their English on you.

* As recommended by the Lonely Planet guidebook, Mohamed and Fatma Sobhi offer a fascinating tour of the old city's plants, birds, rocks, wild animals and sand dunes. Animalia's tour guides are fluent in English, Arabic, Spanish and French.
*Hire a felucca or a motor boat and ask them to take you to the Nubian Village to see the Crocodiles. Yes, local Nubians keep large and small Crocodiles in their homes. You can hold them, get a free drink and enjoy time with local Nubians.

Buy

The souqs (markets) in Aswan are refreshingly exotic without the same level of high-pressure selling found in some tourist towns further north.
You will generally find that Nubian handicrafts are of higher quality and better value in Aswan. All other goods will be more expensive than in due to shipping costs to Aswan and the lower tourist demand. Having said that, the Aswan souk still has a lot of unscrupulous sellers trying to con their way into selling you low quality goods at high price. Try your best to compare the prices before buying and don't be hesitant to haggle.

* The most charming souq in Egypt, There is far less pressure to buy than in other cities. Buy Nubian talisman, baskets, Sudanese swords, African masks, live produce, food, fruit, vegetables, henna powder, t-shirts, perfume, spices, robes, statues.

Eat
As in Luxor some restaurants have two identical menues: one with Egyptian prices in Arab, another one with (double) tourist prices in English. Also keep in mind that many restaurants add charges that increase your bill with about 20% Check before you order.

* Dishes: 8LE to 30 LE. Popular with locals. Great kafta and kebabs, pigeon, and chicken, all served with bread, salad and tahini. Meanwhile DEC2017 prices have gone up at least for foreigners. An average meal is about 100 EGP (about double what you pay in Cairo for a similar meal in a similar setting). 

* Decent food with cheery service. The local fish joints near the city market can be excellent -- their fish is fresh, and you can watch it cook. Don't miss the crab soup! Free Wifi.

* Serves fiteer, a flaky Egyptian pizza, as well as western varieties. 

* Fresh fish restaurant, priced by weight. Small place. Some say it's worth the wait but others think it's overhyped and pricey compared to Egyptian standard

* A meat restaurant, another one of the best-regarded restaurants in Aswan

* Popular amound Nubian felucca captains. Beer available.

* .

* Small place.

* Fresh ingredient, great service, peaceful and relaxing atmosphere. Choice of Terraces to relax and enjoy your meal with the best views on the Nile. This is the best food and service you will find in Aswan.

* Spectacular sunset views over the first cataract. Sheesha and tea.

* Serves simple Egyptian stews served in clay pots, with salad, mezze, rice. All day breakfast.

*Fresh ingredients, stellar service, and the best sunset view. Great place to take a swim in the nile as well.

*Two reasons to have a meal here: fantastic view of the Nile River and air-condition.

Drink

 is much less strict on drinking alcohol than or , and many of the restaurants sell Stella (Egyptian brand not the Belgian brand) and Saqqara, both of which are lagers and comparable to European beers.
For wine, check restaurant next to Pyramisisa for a decent price/quality (~200 EGP). (not at the hotel, where it is too expensive +300EGP)

 is 's capital of sugarcane. When you are there you should try the fresh sugarcane juice, it costs about 1LE. There's a recommended sugarcane juice shop nearby the Catholic basilica near to "the souk", but remember to ask for a straw because they don't wash the glass well. You can enjoy many sugarcane juice shops as you walk around.

Sleep

In Aswan, as else in Egypt, decent and reasonably priced options are scarce. Most often, there is either a choice between dirt-cheap (although not that 'dirt-cheap' anymore) but severely run-down hotels and those charging European prices for a level of service of a very bad 3 star hotel. A recent review of all of them makes the Queen Hotel (about 200m right from the railway station, behind a car-washing facility, prices from 70 EGP) and the already mentionned Noorhan hotel which is in the first alley on your left once you enter the souq the most recommendable budget options for a traveler. Prices at Northaan start from 50 EGP (FREE Wi-Fi), you might want to take the rooms with bathroom included, those are significantly cleaner. Altough with a smelly reception, the rooms are clean by Egyptian standards, linen freshly washed, the location is the most central and there isn't any pressure to book you on tours with them. The guys are laid-back and the experience is seamless. You can pay on check-out. It is the same owner as the Queen Hotel. Memnon Hotel has since doubled prices and those are 90 EGP for singles, 80 after hard bargaining though views of the Nile are nice. (April 2015)

Budget
Note that some hotels might treat prices below quoted in "LE" as "US dollars" to foreigners, eg Philae Hotel quoting 60LE meant 60US Dollars in 2016. Keylany price at $23USD for ~windowless single ac room off Nile waterfront was correct as at 2016.

* Small but clean rooms

* Gloomy hotel but clean rooms.

* 36 rooms. Swimming pool.

* Nov 2015 dorm room 21LE nr station. gps N 24.0990964, E 32.9007372 ultra basic / English not spoken / not particularly welcoming. Not accepting individual travelers, only accepting groups in Oct 2016.

* OK location just two minutes walk from the Nile and even less across the street from a major street market. Clean rooms and bathrooms. Great customer service and spot on wake up calls. Cold air conditioners in rooms. Standard budget breakfast. Free, but slow/bad WiFi access: Go to Aswan Moon nearby on the Nile for better 'free' WiFi (for customers) (2016).

* OK budget option if you are looking for the cheapest bed.

* Great Nile views.

* Clean and pleasant with functioning (common) hot shower. Internet in lobby only. No breakfast included. Indifferent staff. 

* The second best value for your money, after the Keylany Hotel. Clean comfortable rooms, near train station. Next to internet cafe and ahwa.

* Friendly 3-star hotel with tacky decor.

* Friendly staff, and some of the best views in Egypt (make sure you get a Nile View room). On the downside somewhat rundown rooms, gives you that camping inside feeling, not always plenty of hot water!

* High rise hotel. Slow service and no character but good views and good value. It's closed (Mar 2015)

* Not clean beds. Hot shower. One receptionist was annoying asking for tips. Next to a mosque with life broadcast of sermons and recitals from the book until 00:00 

* Rooms are basic but clean. Staff is aggressive about trying to sell you a tour.

Mid-range

* Quiet atmosphere, hospitable staff, clean rooms, small (8 double rooms), restaurant for guests on the roof terrace. Marvellous view over the Nile, the desert and the Nubian villages. Perfect place if you are looking for something different! Bike rental available.
 

* Dated but comfortable hotel with unique architecture and incredible view of the Nile. Located right nearby plenty of feluccas from which you can hire a cruise (EGP 20/boat) and riverboat restaurants such as the Mona Lisa and Aswan Moon. Walking distance to the Nubian Museum in 15mins, and with a helpful staff that can help you to arrange a tour to Abu Simbel (ask in advance and they will prepare a breakfast box for you if taking the 4am convoy) or visit to Philae (EGP 150 to hire a car for Philae/Obelisk/High Dam). The pool is beautiful though onsite restaurant is quite expensive. Rooms are comfortable and almost no noise is perceptible given its location so you can get a great night sleep with great shades that serve well to block out the sun. 

* Run down, but in the process of being refurbished.

* Mohamed Beshir's houseboat. Bed & Breakfast in three guestrooms, on request also half- or fullboard, tours and sightseeing packages, transfers for arrival/departure and all other activities are also organized

Camping

* On an island in Aswan’s archipelago, natural setting, panoramic view of the Nile and the hills of Aswan. The island is located ten minutes by motorboat from the main land, close to the Mausoleum of Agha Khan and the Monastery of St. Simeon. 

Stay safe
Aswan is generally a very safe city.Watch out for pickpockets in the souq. These thieves will approach you carrying scarves, shirts or even papyrus in one hand to sell to you, while attempting to go into your pockets with the other hand. Most horse carriage drivers will not commit on the price when you arrive at your destination and you're expect to give more. Once you escape the tourist-heavy places (i.e. the corniche), you'll find that many of the locals are very friendly as is Egyptian culture. If you go into a shop to buy some snacks/water and the owner does not have change, it is not at all uncommon to see him look for change while leaving you alone in the shop. Egyptians are by nature very friendly and honest people, with an unfortunate population corrupted by the need to scam and steal from tourists.

Contact

Internet access is available at Keylany Hotel for free and Noorhan Hotel for 10LE per hour but internet speeds are very slow. Kothor Hotel has reasonably faster internet available for 5LE per hour or 10LE unlimited during your stay.

Cope
There is so much to do around the Aswan area that time can be an issue. The local people are generally very cooperative, and for a price, doors might remain opened regardless of the hour.
