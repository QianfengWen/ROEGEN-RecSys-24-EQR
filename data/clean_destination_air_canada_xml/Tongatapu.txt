Tongatapu is 's largest island with over two-thirds of the country's small population. It is a coral island surrounded by coral reefs. The capital, Nuku'alofa, on the north coast, has a relaxed air, despite the troubles of a few years ago (see article on ). There are some interesting places to visit and some nice beaches with good snorkelling and Tongatapu provides a good opportunity to view a unique culture. Most of the interesting places are outside Nuku’alofa but most of the places to stay are in the capital. There is a good bus network and car rental is possible.

Understand

Get in

By Plane

There are several flights a week from Auckland, Sydney, Nadi and Suva. See for more details.

By Boat

Get around
Nuku'alofa is small enough to walk around and taxis are available. (You can take a bus from around the terminal, but the bus is unreliable, taxi is a better option). You can go by boat to the minor island around Nuku'alofa from the pier.

By rental car/scooter

Tongatapu can just about be seen in one day by car or motorbike. You can rent cars and motorscooters. A Tongan driver's license for T$40 is available and can be obtained at the police department with your home license.There are few or no road signs on Tongatapu so you'll need a good map if you're touring in a car. Unfortunately there are no complete road maps in existence yet. The speed limit on most of the island is 40kph and this is stuck to by the local drivers. The Police have radar guns to check. The roads are good in and around Nuku'alofa but deteriorate the further from the town and the further south you travel.

Most cars on the island are in a terrible state, maintained on a budget and held together by a combination of 'Western Union' stickers and prayer. The low speed limit helps to keep accidents down.

* Valu and her husband Creed have just started their new rental business as of late 2016. Brand new 125cc scooters / cars. Very lovely people. Much recommended.

You can also hire a car from the Friend's Tourist Centre (near the main post office) for about 50 Pa'anga and a tour of the island is about 120 km.

By tour guide

Teta Tours and Toni's guest house offer day tours of all the main tourist sights (40-80 Pa'anga depending on how many are on the tour). 

By bus

Buses to various points on Tongatapu run from the bus concourse on the seafront in Nuku'alofa although there are no timetables posted and local sources say that they are not reliable after about 1530 hours on most days. With no bus stops you just stand on the side of the road and flag the driver down (do not wave, they will wave back and keep driving). The most popular buses in Tonga are generally the loudest, so when you want to get off a reasonably loud "STOP" will do it (again, just anywhere you want them to stop). If you don't like kids or crowds avoid the buses at the end-of-school time, they get packed out and the only limit on how many people in a bus is how many can fit in. The general cost of getting from Nuku`alofa to the surfing destination of Ha`atafu on the western penninsula is roughly T$2.20.

Talk

Tongan is the official language but English is very widely spoken

See
*Nuku’alofa. This is the capital of Tonga and the largest city of Tongatapu. The crumbling wooden Royal Palace was built in 1867 and is the official residence of the King. Until its death in 1966 the palace grounds housed a tortoise given to the then King by Captain Cook. 
*Situated in Nuku'alofa next to the Central Police Station, Talamahu is the main market in Tongatapu where all the local farmers bring their fresh produce and sell. You can find all types of seasonal fruits, fresh vegetables and root vegetables such as yams, kumara, taro, manioke. Upstairs you will find local handicrafts, second hand clothing, shoes, carvings and jewelry of all types. 
*Ha’amonga ‘a Maui. Near the village of Niutōua, in the northeast corner of the island. This is a trilithon made out of coral, limestone rock. The name means ‘Maui’s burden’, referring to the Polynesian God Maui, who according to legend formed the Kingdom of Tonga by fishing the islands from the depths of the sea. The Ha’amonga ‘a Maui is thought to have been built around 1200 AD. There are several theories regarding its purpose. One is that the King, fearing his two sons would quarrel on his death, erected it as a symbol of brotherhood. Each son was represented by a stone pillar, and united by the lintel. A more likely explanation is that it was the gateway to the King’s palace at his new capital. This capital did not last long, hence the present-day isolation of the trilithon.

*Mu’a. This town, on the eastern edge of the lagoon, was the home of the Tu’i Tonga line of kings and was for centuries the capital of the island. It is notable for many tombs of the kings that can still be seen. When a Tuʻi Tonga king died he was buried in a langi, a big, artificial hill surrounded by huge slabs of coral rock, usually in three or more layers. This rock was quarried from along the coast of Tongatapu or from nearby islands. The accuracy by which the slabs were cut so that they fit each other with little space between is considered remarkable.
* Blowholes. These are near the village of Houma to the southwest of the island. When waves crash into the reef, natural channels in the volcanic rock allow water to be pushed through and forced up into the air. Best at high tide.
*Flying foxes. These are found in trees at Kolovai, to the west of the island. They are Pacific Flying Foxes, a species of fruit bat. Only the King is allowed to hunt them, hence these undisturbed colonies.

*The Tongan National Cultural Centre. On the edge of Fanga'uta Lagoon on Taufa'ahau Road, around 1.5 km south of Nuku'alofa. This center is constructed with traditional buildings that house exhibitions of the kingdom's history. Artisans work on their crafts such as carving, tapa making and weaving and the items they make are sold to the visitors. Large buffet dinners are offered on Tuesdays and Thursdays with demonstrations of traditional dancing and other skills.
*'Anahulu Cave is a stalactite cave situated north of Fatumu village. There is an underground freshwater swimming pool which is suitable for swimming. Admission fee is T$10 for the first first swimming pool, and T$25 for the guided tour deeper into the cave with more swimming pools which are clean enough to drink! 
Itineraries

Do
There are daily excursions to the islands in the harbor of Nuku'alofa, where swimming, sun bathing, snorkeling, and other activities can be done, and still be able to return in the afternoon. Some of the islands operate boat service, Pangaimotu is only 15 minutes while Royal Sunset is about an hour away. the islands listed below all have restaurants and bars available.
*Is a small island off the coast of Nuku'alofa which operates day trips to the island. The cost is T$90 with lunch. The boat leaves at 11.00 am and returns 4.00 pm. A great alternative if you have already visited Pangaimotu island
*Is a resort located on the island of Atata about an hour boat ride from Nuku'alofa. The resort operates day trips to the island, and a tours of the village located on the island. The cost is T$70 with lunch. The boat leaves at 10.00 am and returns 4.00 pm. A great way to spend a Sunday when most of Nuku'alofa is closed.
* A trip to Pangaimotu Island costs about T$20 return. The boat leaves hourly from 9.00 am to 12.00 pm and does return trips hourly from 3.00pm to 6.00 pm. The small island, the closest one to Nuku`alofa has a half sunken ship wreck to snorkel around. However, beware of jumping off as the bottom is shallow on some sides and the rusted ship is sharp. The ship also attracts sea snakes. The island takes about an hour to meander around and has a restaurant which serves good food and hires snorkelling gear (costly). Good idea to go on Sunday when most other things are closed. 

Buy
The market located in the centre of the Nuku'alofa is an exciting place where you can bargain for jewellery and souvenirs.

Eat
For a small town, Nuku'alofa offers a decent range of restaurants and bars. Expect to pay 15-40 Pa'anga for a main course in a restaurant and about 5 Pa'anga for a takeaway at one of the roadside sellers. Seafood is usually good.

Stay safe
Tongatapu is very safe but the usual travel precautions apply. Don't flash expensive cameras and jewellery and don't leave passports, money, clothes, etc. lying around in hotel rooms. If you're staying with locals (there is a good chance you'll be invited to stay at someone's home on Tongatapu) take your valuables with you during the day and secure them at night

Tongan drivers are sometimes erratic so watch out. Asking for a helmet when you hire a bicycle is advisable. Dogs can be a nuisance especially in some areas outside of the capital.

Water that crashes over the reefs into the lagoons is sucked back out again through gaps in the reefs. Be careful when snorkelling that you don't get caught in one of these channels of water heading for open sea or you could be seriously hurt by the coral.

Contact
There are several internet cafes in town. The Friend's Cafe is the most popular and includes Wi-Fi at TOP5 an hour, or TOP4 an hour if food/drink are purchased. Some places charge as low as TOP2 an hour. Avoid inserting camera cards into the slots due to the risk of viruses. Use Skype to call overseas because it's about TOP1 per minute if you buy a phone card.

Get out
There are flights and ferries to , and . None of these services operates on Sunday.

Eua Island is located only 17.5km east-southeast from Tongatapu. It is the highest island in Tonga and is not related geologically to the other islands, being much older. It has beaches on the western side but dramatic cliffs on the east coast, with Tonga’s largest tropical rain forest, which is a great place to go trekking. 

‘Eua is just an eight-minute flight from Tongatapu on Chathams Pacific Airline There is also a ferry that leaves from Nuku’alofa at 10:30 in the morning on Tuesdays, Wednesday, Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. Keep in mind that the ferry may leave earlier or later than scheduled, so arrive well before transit (this is the only way to know for sure if the ferry is leaving) Cost is TOP23. The ferry can get rather crowded, so be early. On average, the ferry will take about two and a half hours, but can take much longer (5-6 hours!) in poor weather. Note that flights and ferries can be delayed or even cancelled without notice in poor weather conditions.

* Six rooms and two traditional fales on a beach from where dolphins and whales can sometimes be seen. Tours round the island are organized.

* On eight acres of land close to the rain forest.

* Four rooms in a house in the centre of the island.
