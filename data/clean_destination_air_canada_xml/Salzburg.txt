Salzburg, birthplace of Mozart, is a city in central , near the German (Bavarian) border with a population of some 150,000 in 2013. If you have seen the movie The Sound of Music you may think you know all there is to see in Salzburg. Admittedly, it is difficult not to spontaneously burst into song when you're walking along the Salzach River, or climbing up to the Hohensalzburg fortress which looms over the city. But there is a lot more to this compact, courtly city than Julie Andrews. 

Understand

Salzburg is the fourth-largest city in Austria (after Vienna, Graz and Linz) and the capital of the federal . Its "Old Town", with its world famous baroque architecture, is one of the best-preserved city centers in the German-speaking world and was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997.

Origins of name

The name Salzburg literally means "Salt Fortress", and derives its name from the barges carrying salt on the Salzach river, which were subject to a toll in the 8th century.

Early history and medieval period

Traces of human settlements dating to the Neolithic Age, and later a Celtic camp, have been found in the area. Starting from 15 BC, the small communities were grouped into a single town which was named by the Romans as Juvavum. Little remains of the city from this period.

The Festung Hohensalzburg, the city's fortress, was built in 1077 and expanded in the following centuries. Independence from was secured in the late 14th century.

Independent state

Salzburg was the capital of an independent state from the early 14th century until 1805. It was ruled by prince-archbishops, who became rich from the salt mines located in the south of the city. This led to the architectural gem you see today as not only materials, but also architects, were imported from Italy and other European countries. This is also the reason why, compared to other Austrian cities, sacred monuments outnumber the few secular buildings. This is how Salzburg got its nickname as "the Rome of the north". Everywhere you go in this city, you see and read about the legacy of the Archbishops.

Get in

By car

Salzburg is well connected to both Vienna (Wien) and Munich (München), Germany via the autobahns A8 (Munich – Salzburg) and A1 (Salzburg – Vienna). There is an you have to purchase. The price varies, depending on whether you buy a yearly or 10 day vignette.

Driving around Salzburg can be a pain. The road names are small and written in a traditional German font which can be hard to read. The best bet is to get into the city, find a parking space, and travel by foot. If you are driving in cold weather, be prepared for snow, and snow chains are recommended in extreme weather. From October to April, the law requires all cars to have snow tires (Winterreifen).
 
By train

Salzburg's railway station, the Hauptbahnhof (Hbf.), is located to the north of the Salzach River within the New Town of Salzburg. The train ride from Munich to Salzburg takes about an hour and a half (Regional trains take about 2 hours), and international trains operate from Zurich, Zagreb, Ljubljana and Budapest to name just a few destinations. Fast Inter-city trains operate very frequently, especially to Linz and Vienna, with up to three connections every hour operated by ÖBB and WestBahn.
The station was completely renovated between 2009 and 2014 and now has a modern look. The Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB) and German Federal Railways (DB) have ticket offices. Tickets for ÖBB, DB and WestBahn trains are also sold at machines. The popular Bayern Ticket train pass for Bavaria sold by DB also covers train rides between Bavaria to Salzburg Hbf., but it is only valid for Regional trains (code RE and RB). The rail pass can be bought from DB ticket offices as well as DB Ticket Selling Machines in the station.

The airport has direct connections from Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Brussels, Dublin, Birmingham, Exeter, London, , Palma de Mallorca, Paris, , Moscow, Vienna, all big German cities, and Zurich. For more connections you may prefer flying to Munich or Vienna and taking the train to Salzburg.

Get around

The best way to get around Salzburg is on foot. There is a network of city buses, the StadtBus, with numbers from 1 to 8 (trolleybuses) and 20-27 (diesel buses). A single trip ticket on the bus is €2.60, a single short trip ticket €1.30 (maximum 3 stops), a 24 h ticket €5.70 (from 1st Jul 2016) which covers the whole city. If you travel by bus, make sure you catch none of the last buses. They will take you several miles out of town with your only way back being on foot or by taxi. If you need to get somewhere late at night, it may be best to take a taxi.

Conveniently, bus tickets can be bought on the buses from the bus driver. However, if you have time, buy the tickets in advance at a "Trafik", since they are then significantly cheaper. But you have to buy the tickets in blocks of 5, 5-single-ticket package costs €9 (means €1.8 each), 5-short-trip-ticket package costs €4.5 (means €0.9 each) and Day Ticket Single tickets is €3.7. Single tickets and 24-h Day ticket are also available from automatic machines at central bus stops.

The "Lokalbahn" train has a separate station under the main railway station and travels in the direction of Oberndorf and Lamprechtshausen. Tickets can be bought on the train.

Another option for exploring areas around the main city (Bad Ischl, Fuschlsee, etc.) are the Postbuses. These also leave from the main railway station; tickets can be bought from the driver. Also you can rent a car from €35 and drive in the surrounding of the city.

Finally, another excellent option is renting a bike, or a Road Bike. Salzburg has over 100 km of bike paths, and using this mode of transportation is often faster than bus, car or foot. There are also excellent bike paths on either side of the river, which you can follow to either Freilassing (35 min), Oberndorf or Hallein (each about an hour away).

Having arrived at the airport (Flughafen Salzburg) it is very easy to make your way into the town centre by trolleybus or other modes of transport. Tickets for these services can be bought easily from the bus driver and you can travel from here to the "Hauptbahnhof" main station where you can reach many destinations, predominantly in Austria, but also across the whole of Europe.

See

* Once the summer palace of the Archbishops of Salzburg it has lots of clever fountains and pretty gardens. There is a 45-minute guided tour of the fountains and an audio guide available for the house. Wear sensible shoes, as the ground is often wet near the fountains. Hellbrunn is surrounded by vast gardens, including a good children's playground with swings and flying fox, and a cold wading pool, and is a perfect place for a picnic or a long walk through the park. In the Steintheater (Stone Theater), the first opera in Middle Europe was conducted. If you're traveling with children, this is the place to visit, because children and adults alike are amused. There is a zoo within the grounds, but a separate ticket is required for entry.

* – A long and narrow street running parallel to the river in the centre of town, with lots of shops, famous for the old (or old-style) signs of profession outside each store.

* 

Located on top of a mountain, the Festung offers breath-taking views of Salzburg and the Alps. One area of the fortress offers visitors the chance to look down on a field below to find only one house, the executioner's residence. It was believed to live anywhere near the executioner was bad luck. Inside the fortress are rooms showing medieval weapons, life on the fortress, and torture instruments. Public concerts are often held here in the evenings, reservations are recommended. On nights with concerts, it is possible to remain within the walls past dark. To avoid the vertical hike up to the Fortress, a funicular is available to ride, for a fee.

* Various shops in this area are quite old and impressive. For instance have a look at the interior of the pharmacy called Fürsterzbischöfliche Apotheke. No pictures though, this is a pharmacy not a tourist attraction.

* The Mozart family lived in this house in the heart of Salzburg from 1747-1773, where W.A. Mozart himself was born on 27 January 1756. The house is now a popular museum devoted to Mozart and his family, with interesting memorabilia and letters. Well worth a visit. For die-hard Mozart fans, the same organisation also runs the "Mozart Residence" museum (similar times and prices) which holds a 'Pictures of Mozart' exhibition, containing portraits of the man, as well as portraits of doubtful provenance. Separate entrance fee. 

* Mozarts Wohnhaus (Mozart Residence), Makartplatz 8

* Located right next to the Salzach river and the Mozarteum University of Music and Arts lies a beautiful castle with gardens, built by an archbishop for his beloved courtesan.

If you plan to marry there, reservations should be made at least a year in advance. Weddings in English are only held on Tuesday and Friday. If you don't speak German, you can't get married any other day! The gardens are free.

*The Untersberg The mountain is perennially popular with tourists due to its proximity to the city of Salzburg, less than 16 km (10 mi) to the north of the mountain and within easy reach by bus. A variety of paths lead to the top, but most people use the cable car that lifts passengers over 1300m to the Geiereck peak. The cable car runs from the 'St Leonhard' station in the town of Gartenau to the station at the Geiereck peak.

*Kapuzinerberg. This steep hill can be accessed through Linzergasse in the old part of town. Once you're in you're in deep forest. There are several paths that bring you to the top (where the Franziskischlössl fortification stands – today it's a restaurant) via either a paved road -no traffic, though- or a forest track with steps. There are several viewpoints along the way. The views of the city, and the Alps, are spectacular, the air is fresh and it makes for a superb little excursion without leaving the city.

Buy

*Mozartkugeln (Mozart balls) are chocolate-covered marzipan candy balls inspired by the famous composer, Salzburg's most famous son, Mozart. Try the original version at Café Fürst; be aware, though, they are rather expensive, with a small box costing as much as €7. The more widespread Mirabell brand is sold in many tourist shops, but they are also available at most local grocery stores for a lot less. The Reber brand sits between Fürst and Mirabell in terms of quality, it is however made in Germany and thus not authentic; its price is in line with Mirabell's. There's a Reber chocolate shop in the Altermarkt with a wide range of chocolates, Kugeln and pastettes.
* The annual Christmas Market (Christkindlmarkt), located at the three squares around the dome (Domplatz, Kapitelplatz, Residenzplatz) features traditional fast food, such as hot potatoes, doughnuts with kraut, and candies, as well as christmas decorations, winter clothes, and craftmanship.

Stay Safe
Salzburg is the most dangerous city in Austria – but literally all of these crimes are just pickpocketing cases. The most crime occurs at the train station. Violent crimes such as murder and armed robbery is incredibly rare. 
Tourists are targeted the most, so make sure that you keep your wallet/purse safe. 
So far, no terrorist attacks have happened in Salzburg at all – however, the risk of one happening is increasing. Multiple attack plans have been foiled by the police. Make sure to keep a watchful eye for anything suspicious – if you feel unsafe, just leave as soon as possible.
