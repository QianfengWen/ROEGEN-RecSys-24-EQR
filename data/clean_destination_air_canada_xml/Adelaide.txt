Cathay Pacific via Hong Kong is generally useful for flights to and from both East Asia and Europe -although this service also ceased during the pandemic. Malaysia Airlines and Singapore airlines via Kuala Lumpur and Singapore are useful for flights to and from South East Asia, India, the Middle East and Europe - and continued, at reduced frequencies, throughout the pandemic.

Adelaide is also provided with scheduled services by Qantas and REX - regional airlines. Regional services and operations are provided by Regional Express Airlines (Rex), Alliance Airlines, and Qantaslink flights.

There is only a single terminal for international and domestic departures so transfers are relatively seamless.

Get around

Public transport

Accurate transit directions can be obtained through Google Maps. To navigate around, just enter your "to" address and "from" address (or use current location) on your device (including iPhone, Android), then select the public transport icon.

Ticketing
Metropolitan train, tram and bus services are contracted out by the State Government under the unified brand name Adelaide Metro and use a unified ticketing system, "Metroticket". The Adelaide Metro website or the Passenger Transport InfoCentre (Adelaide Railway Station, 125 North Terrace, Adelaide CBD) is the place to visit for timetable and route information. 

A key point for ticketing in Adelaide is that the vast majority of tickets and fares allow the passenger to move freely around the transport network for at least 2 hours. No validations are permitted after 2 hours but the passenger is allowed to remain on the current vehicle if their ticket has already been validated before the 2 hour limit. 

The off-peak period in Adelaide is between 9:01am and 3:00pm on weekdays, Sundays and all public holidays. Tickets are approximately 30% cheaper during this time. 

There are several options for purchasing tickets:

*Single trip tickets ($5.40 for adults ($3.50 in off-peak)) allow the passenger to move freely around the transport network for 2 hrs. If traveling often, it is cheaper to use a stored value Metrocard (below).

*A $10.20 daytrip ticket is available, allowing unlimited travel within the Adelaide Metro area for an entire day. If travelling for 3 days, it may be more economical to purchase a 3 day visitors pass (below).

*There is a 3 day visitors pass available for $26.60, allowing unlimited travel on the Adelaide Metro network for 3 days. A map and a travel guide is included. If you wish to continue using the ticket beyond the 3 days, more Metrocard credit can be purchased.

Single Tickets can be purchased from ticket machines on board trains (coins or card) and trams (coins or card), and from some bus interchanges (Tea Tree Plaza, Klemzig, Paradise). A small number of stations (Adelaide, Gawler, Noarlunga Centre, Oaklands and Mawson Lakes), and a number of newsagents, corner stores and post offices sell & recharge the contactless, stored value Metrocard.

If using a Metrocard or visitors pass, you validate by touching against the reader when entering a bus, train or tram - just do what the locals do. Ensure that the light on the machine is green before proceeding. There is no need to touch off. Additionally, you need to validate to pass through the platform gates at Adelaide Railway Station (you still have to validate on the train after going through the barriers).

Buses
The Adelaide Metro bus system is quite comprehensive, and extends out to the Adelaide Hills in the east, down to Maclaren Vale in the south (although buses there are infrequent) and as far as Gawler in the north. It does not cover the Barossa Valley. Routes that may be useful for tourists include:

* 864F to Crafers Park & Ride, then 823 to Cleland Wildlife Park and Mount Lofty Summit (from Currie Street in Adelaide CBD, limited services per day)

* 751W or 753 (from Noarlunga Centre station) - to Maclaren Vale (limited services per day)

* 117, 118, 150, 156, 232 - to Port Adelaide (different routes)

The free City Loop (#99C) bus runs M-F 07:40-18:00 every 15min, F 18:00-21:20 every 30min, Sa 08:00-17:00 every 30min and Su (and public holidays) 10:00-17:00 every 30min. It has clockwise and anticlockwise routes each with about 30 stops taking in all the major cultural and commercial centres, beginning at Victoria Square and including Adelaide Railway Station. The buses have ground-level access ramps.

Be warned that bus frequency declines sharply after 18:00, with hourly intervals being typical in the suburbs. All services cease operation around midnight, so check your timetables and expect to catch a taxi if required if you are out after this time. Very basic After Midnight bus services along limited routes operate hourly after midnight on Saturday nights.

Tram
A tram service runs from the Royal Adelaide Hospital in Hindmarsh, an inner north-western suburb, to the Adelaide CBD, travelling along North Terrace and King William Street, through the city and then onward to the south west terminating at the popular seaside suburb of Glenelg. You can park in the Entertainment Centre carpark and take the tram into the city, which is more convenient than finding parking within the city itself. Stops within the city centre include Adelaide Railway Station, Rundle Mall and Victoria Square. Tram travel from South Terrace, through the CBD to the Northern Terminus of the line is free., as is travel confined to Jetty Road in Glenelg. Otherwise the standard ticket system applies and the whole trip takes about 30 min. Tickets may be bought in advance or purchased from a ticket machine on the tram (card or coins).

Train
The Adelaide Metro train system has four main lines, with two additional branch lines:

* The Gawler Line, to Gawler Central, about an hour north of the city.

* The Outer Harbor Line, which goes up the Le Fevre Peninsula in the north-west of the city via Port Adelaide. A branch extends off this line to the beachside suburb of Grange.

* The Seaford Line, formerly the Noarlunga Line, which now extends through Noarlunga Centre to Seaford, in the far south of the city, via the beachside suburb of Brighton. A short branch extends off this line to the suburb of Tonsley (which only operates Mon-Fri during business hours and peak hours, except during the AFL season when additional dedicated Footy Express trains run on game day, on all lines).

* The Belair Line which extends to Belair in the foothills of the Adelaide Hills to the south-east of the city.

Visitors may find the Outer Harbor line useful to get to Port Adelaide. Although the station is about 0.5 km (0.3 mi) south of the port area, but is an easy walk up Commercial Road. The Belair Line is useful to access Belair National Park, and the Seaford Line provides access the seaside suburbs of Brighton and Hallett Cove. Some of the larger shopping centres are close to stations. Westfield Marion shopping centre is very close to Oaklands Railway Station, while Noarlunga Centre is next to Colonnades.

By foot
The city centre is compact and can be easily covered on foot. Most attractions are centered around the blocks between North Terrace and Victoria Square on either side of King William Street. 

By taxi
Taxis are provided by several companies and can be hailed on the street or arranged by phone. There is a common rate of flagfall and a per-distance/time charge, both of which are increased at night and on weekends. Uber also operates its service in Adelaide, which was legalised in mid-2017.

A taxi fare from the airport to the city will cost between $22 and $28 on weekends and peak periods and between $20 and $25 on weekdays. There is an extra $1 levy on all fares and $3 if the fare starts at the airport.

By bicycle
NGO "Bicycle SA" provides a range of bicycle services, including free-to-use tourist bikes, from its offices in Currie Street, next to the Adelaide Central Bus Station. ‚òé +61 8 8168-9999. Bicycles can be hired, with the deposit of a driving licence or other ID, for the entire day for free, but must be returned before 16:30 or a $25 fee is payable. Arrangements can be made for bicycles to be hired overnight. This service closed during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 with no date set for its return. 

A popular ride is to ride from the city centre along the Torrens out to West Beach, then down to Glenelg and back. You cannot take your bike on the Glenelg Tram or any bus, even outside peak hour, however you can take them on trains. An alternative to taking the tram back from Glenelg is to ride a further 20min south along the coast to Brighton Station on the Noarlunga Centre Line where there are reasonably frequent trains back to Adelaide.

By car
Although the city centre is easily walked or travelled by public transport, as Adelaide's public transportation network is limited and infrequent outside the city centre and the major transport hubs (like Glenelg), renting a car is the most practical way of getting around Adelaide, particularly if you want to head into the suburbs. All the big international companies such as Redspot, Avis, Hertz have an office at Adelaide airport and there are also depots in the central city area.

Pay attention to speed limits. The default metropolitan speed limit, which applies in the absence of any signs in built-up areas, is 50km/hr. The default rural speed limit, which applies in the absence of any signs, is 80km/hr. Although rare, some suburban streets are 40km/hr. Main roads in the inner-city are usually sign posted to 50 or 60km/hr. A few road corridors are 80 to 90km/hr, and most freeways are 110km/hr, including most outback roads outside the city. On multi-lane roads above 80km/h, keep on the left unless overtaking. Vehicles on multi-lane highways will often drive above the speed limit in the rightmost lane, up to around 130km/h, especially on the Northern Expressway.

By e-scooter
There are two e-scooter rental companies operating in the main Adelaide area, Neuron (orange scooters) and Beam (purple scooters). They are activated by scanning with an app, prices vary and some have promotions for cheaper or free rides, so it's worth searching for any active deals while you're there. You legally must wear the provided helmets while riding, and cannot ride scooters into restricted areas (such as Rundle Mall) or outside of the Adelaide area. Personally owned e-scooters are not legal to ride and police may fine you for using them. A map of the operating area of these scooters can be found on the City of Adelaide website.

Budget
* Alfonzo 202 Hutt St. An Italian eatery and shop; a great place to enjoy breakfast and lunch any time of the day.

* Elephant walk 76 Melbourne St, +61 8 8267-2006‚Äì particularly interesting because it is a small, cosy cafe which is very dimly lit. Each booth is separated by straw screens so you can't really see the other patrons. It opens at 8PM and if they're full, you'll have to wait outside for a table.

*An Adelaide institution with decorations which probably haven't been changed in 30 years. Arguably Adelaide's best falafel and be sure to try the cauliflower dishes. Vegetarian/vegan friendly and BYO.

* Fasta Pasta, is the McDonalds of pasta; although found in other states its popularity in South Australia is due to the chain having started in Adelaide. Expect to pay from $10 for a plate of pasta.

* There are actually a lot of budget eateries in Adelaide. They don't usually look like much from the outside but most have something going for them - the reason that they are still in business. It pays to look through menus plastered onto doors. Cheap eats should be anywhere from $8-14 for a main, and no more.

Mid-range
* Amalfi, 29 Frome St, ‚òé +61 8 8223 1948. This little Italian place located just off Rundle St has a loyal following and is usually jam packed. It has an inventive range of pizzas and pastas, with quality a cut above the other Italian cafes filling Rundle St.

* Jasmin, 31 Hindmarsh Sq, ‚òé +61 8 8223 7837. Arguably Adelaide's best Indian restaurant. Beautifully decorated, with classical music playing and impeccable service.

Mains $13-18.

Splurge

* Magill Estate Restaurant, 78 Penfold Rd, Magill, ‚òé +61 8 8301 5551. While the food here is good, the real stars are the view and the wine list.

Drink
There are pubs and bars dotted all around the CBD, but a few districts are worth singling out. Rundle Street and its neighbouring area known simply as "The East End" have a number of popular pubs. Hindley St used to be notorious as the seedy home of Adelaide's strip clubs and bikie bars, but it, and "The West End" have undergone a renaissance. The eastern end of Hindley Street is more mainstream, whereas the western end, west of Morphett Street has a few trendier and more alternative venues. The seedy places are still there, but so too is a university campus and a number of trendy bars and clubs. Also important are Gouger Street and its many restaurants but with an increasing number of bars and pubs. O'Connell Street is home to a few of North Adelaide's popular pubs.

There are also many bars in the suburbs of Adelaide which usually are busier on Thursday and Friday evenings. Quite a lot of the locals will go to the hotels in the suburbs on Thursday and Friday evenings, and go into the Adelaide CBD on Saturday evenings.

Smoking in pubs and clubs is banned under South Australian law. Many drinking establishments have outdoor areas where smoking is permitted.

Cafes
* Amazing Coffee. Cold Drip specialist. Well known and a favourite of Adelaide locals. Worth the drive. Close to a very nice beach.

Situated just off Rundle St, this Adelaide institution is often referred to as "The Cranker", or less kindly, the "Crowd of Wankers" attracts those of an alternative bent. Goths, metalheads, punks and hippies all mingle in this multi-roomed venue, sipping beer. But don't worry, piercings and tattoos aren't essential to have a good time. Music playing could be just about anything. 

* Worldsend, 208 Hindley St, ‚òé +61 8 8231 9137. M-F 11AM-late, Sa 4PM-late, Su closed. Serves food all day. This lively pub features a beer garden and a solid restaurant. The crowd is generally early to mid 20s, many from the nearby Hindley Street campus of the University of South Australia. While it definitely has a strong pub feel, the music is more like a bar, with live jazz and funk, house and drum'n'bass (rather than rock) the order of the day. 

* The Exeter, 246 Rundle St, ‚òé +61 8 8223 2623. This friendly old-school pub is much frequented by students from nearby Adelaide University and TAFE.

Located in a strip of bars and clubs along the southern end of Light Square adjacent to Hindley St. The Cumberland was bought out and refurbished some years ago. Nowadays it's a cozy spot which does a good job of being all things to all people. The front bar areas conceal a dance floor within, where a DJ is invariably playing house, and an outdoor area around the side. The popularity of "The Cumby" is cyclic, but if it's not happening, one of the adjacent places will be.

* The Grace Emily, 232 Waymouth St, ‚òé +61 8 8231 5500. (Opposite "The Cumberland). The Grace has plenty of trinkets behind and around the bar to keep one's eyeballs busy whilst nursing a Coopers or bloody mary. Local, interstate and overseas bands play most nights.

* The Stag, 299 Rundle St. (cnr of Rundle and East Tce), More up market establishment, with good views of the parklands from the al fresco seating, good range of drinks and weekly live music. The second floor balcony literally overlooked the old Formula 1 street circuit and was always crammed with race fans. With the shortened Clipsal 500 course this is no longer possible, but still a good place to go after the days races. (Pub recently closed and liquidated)*

Bars

Stay safe
The Australia-wide emergency number is 000. The ambulance service, fire service and police are available through this number. 

As with any city, people should exercise personal safety, particularly at night. 

Your biggest risk in the inner-city and night is drunk people. If you want to avoid drunk people, avoid Hindley Street between 10pm-4am, as this is where you are most likely to encounter them, as this is where most of Adelaide's nightclubs are located. 
You are not at a high risk in other parts of the city in the evening. It is safe to go out to eat, or to a bar, as late as 11pm. You are still unlikely to be a victim of a crime after 11pm, but there will be drunk people around the city.

The city park lands are poorly lit and are best avoided after dark due to the presence of intoxicated people. Robberies have known to occur in these areas. If you need to cross the park lands to reach the suburbs, stay near the road. Catching a taxi or public transport is recommended at night.

When catching a train at a suburban station, it is best to arrive at the station within 1-2 min of the scheduled arrival time. Trains in Adelaide are generally reliable and arrive and depart on schedule. There are security guards on all trains after 7PM and many rail services have bus connections available. Exercise personal safety in and around train stations. 

At night police actively patrol the city centre, especially Hindley Street where most of the city's nightclubs and bars are located. Taxi ranks are located near the Adelaide Casino on North Terrace, the Hilton Adelaide Hotel on Victoria Square, and the junction of Rundle Street and Pulteney Street outside the Hungry Jacks fast food outlet.

Remember to lock your car and avoid leaving valuables in view in unattended vehicles. 

Pickpockets are very rare and there are no "hotspots", but opportunistic theft does happen. Do not leave valuables unattended. When swimming at the beach in busy areas near the city, leave one person on shore to look after your things.

Avoid walking at night in outer suburbs known for having higher crime rates, most notably areas like Elizabeth and Salisbury (20km north of the CBD), and Hackham and Noarlunga (25km south of the CBD). The most publicised criminal element are youth gangs that commit robbery and vehicle theft. They tend to be more opportunistic and target people in the wrong place at the wrong time. It's advised you don't walk alone at night in these areas, This heightens your chance of being a victim. There are motorcycle gangs, but they rarely interact with the public and are kept in check through dedicated police operations. You are highly unlikely to encounter any gangs. 

If common sense is used, Adelaide is a very safe city overall.
