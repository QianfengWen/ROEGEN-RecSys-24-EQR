Get in

By boat

Where the Tennessee River meets the Ohio River, just upstream from where the Ohio meets the Mississippi. River boats, like the Delta Queen(no longer in service), often stopped at the riverfront in Paducah.

Most visitors will arrive by car: Interstate Highway 24 describes a semi-circle around Paducah from the northwest where it crosses the Ohio River into to the southeast where it meets the Purchase Parkway at Gilbertsville, near , and the the Western Kentucky Parkway at Eddyville, near . You could also reach Paducah from the east or the west using U.S. Highway 60. Travelers coming from the south or southwest on the Purchase Parkway should take Exit 25 (U.S. Highway 45) on the north side of Mayfield and turn left (north on 45); from there, Paducah is about a half-hour drive.

By plane

There are a few commercial flights per day from the Barkley Regional Airport (PAH) 4 miles west of town to and from , , via United Express. Most locals however prefer to fly out of International Airport (BNA).

Get around

Districts

*Market District. Revitalized starting in the early 1990s, Paducah's riverfront downtown boasts a charming restaurants, shops, museums and an active farmer's market. A particularly unique offering is that of the mural-covered Ohio River flood walls, which are well worth an afternoon of your time.
*Lowertown Arts District. The centerpiece of Paducah's Artist Relocation Program, Lowertown plays host to a dozen or so art galleries of varying reputation, one of the most friendly coffee houses ever and a fine-dining fusion style restaurant. How could you go wrong? In general the feel of the neighborhood is reminiscent of ' Garden District, at least before Hurricane Katrina. If you make art yourself the city might even be willing to buy you a house here.

*Family restaurant with AWARD WINNING BBQ! Pork, Ribs, Chicken & 
Award Winning BBQ! 

Ribs, Pork, Custom Cooking & Catering, Chicken & More, Weddings, Special Occasions, Family Reunions, Company Picnics, Award Winning BBQ, Backwoods has it all.
First, the pulled pork is prepared just right, not drowned in sauce to mask the flavor. It is slightly smokey, very tender, and juicy. The ribs are to die for. The meat literally falls off the bone, I would recommend ordering these if this is your first trip. They have a special dry rub that they use with the ribs and the flavor is just exceptional. One last thing I would recommend is to try the hashbrown casserole (side item), it's REALLY good!

Contact
By phone
Since February 2014, Paducah, as well as other parts of Kentucky previously served only by area code 270, has had mandatory 10-digit dialing, meaning that when making any call within that area, even a local one, you must dial all 10 digits. This followed the introduction of a second area code, 364, that covers the same area. There is no geographic area code splitâ€”any new phone in the region may theoretically be assigned a number in either 270 or 364. 

Because of the relatively recent introduction of 10-digit dialing, you may see an older 7-digit number (YYY-ZZZZ) on some signs. If you see a 7-digit number on a sign, assume that this number is in area code 270.
