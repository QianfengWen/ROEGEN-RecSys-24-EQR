Madrid is the capital and the largest city of , as well as the capital of the autonomous community of the same name (). The city has a population of approximately 3.2 million, and the metro area has a population of nearly 6.7 million. Madrid is best known for its great cultural and artistic heritage, a good example of which is the El Prado Museum. Madrid also boasts some of the liveliest nightlife in the world.

Understand
The etymology of Madrid’s name is shrouded in myth and takes long stories to explain possible meanings. On the spot, the locals will be precise about all the details.
* Also, other tourist information office is on Plaza Mayor

Location
Madrid is located just northeast of the geographical center of the , in the middle of the Spanish central Castillian plateau (Meseta central), at an average altitude of 650m. Nearly all of the most famous tourist areas are located in the center of the city including Puerta del Sol, Plaza Mayor, Palacio Real, and Plaza de Colón. The major streets in Madrid include the Gran Via, Alcalá Street, and Paseo de la Castellana. The oldest parts of the city are located on the hills next to the left bank of the Manzanares River.

Climate
The climate of Madrid is continental, mainly dry and quite extreme at times. Madrid sees perpetual sunshine, a characteristically hot and dry summer, and a fairly cold winter with frequent frosts during the night and the occasional snowfall. Spring and autumn are mild with the most rainfall concentrated in these seasons. Madrid has over 300 days of sunshine per year, making it one of the sunniest cities in Europe. Spring and autumn are definitely the best times to visit, especially the months of April, May, June, September, and October. There is a very little rainfall during summer and also less rainfall during winter. During winter snow occurs sporadically; however, snowfall usually lasts only for a few days, but there is abundant snowfall in the adjacent mountain ranges nearby.

Culture

The culture of Madrid is largely influenced by its royal history, as the center of the Spanish Empire. The Royal Palace, big places and buildings used by the Spanish Monarchy. Enormous cathedrals and churches are plentiful in Madrid, as well as medieval architecture, although nowadays Madrid is as cosmopolitan a city as or , full of new architecture, lifestyle and culture.

As the Spanish Capital, Madrid has been emblematic of the different "establishments" for most Spaniards. During the 2nd Republic (1931-1936) it was a bustling city of new ideas. As the capital of the Francoist dictatorship (1939-1975), the city still appears to many Spaniards as a conservative part of Spain. However, the city was also the epicenter of the famous Movida, the Spanish movement of the 80s that raised figures such as director Pedro Almodóvar. The heritage of this era is indeed still visible in the city center, where a party can be found at all times and one of the most liberal and colorful environments of Spain can be seen. 

The citizens of Madrid, who refer to themselves as Madrileños or the more traditional and currently seldom used term "gatos" (cats), live by a daily routine that is heavily influenced by the climate. Due to the typical midday heat during summer, a "siesta" can be still observed during which some citizens take a break to cool off. Madrileños can usually only afford this "luxury" during holidays and weekends. Most stores are open all day; only smaller stores are often closed during this time. Workers and those more affected by the Western lifestyle choose not to take this long break and work traditional working hours, which are usually 9am to 7pm. During the summer many offices, however, will have a summer schedule requiring workers to start at 8am and finish at 3pm (most commonly without the standard 1-2 hour break for lunch). Offices usually close during the weekend but businesses are often open Saturday morning (downtown stays open until the afternoon). Most grocers are closed on Sundays, but some major chain and department stores linked to "culture" (books, music, etc.) will be open throughout the day, and all of them on the first Sunday of the month. Shops and department stores in Puerta del Sol area are open every day.

Madrid possibly has the largest number of bars per capita of any European city and a very active nightlife. Madrileños are known to stay up until as late as 5AM-7AM. It is quite common to see a crowded Gran Vía on weekend nights. It is important to note that, due to this lifestyle, lodging located near the fun areas may end up a nightmare for light sleepers if your window faces the street.

Madrid has a very modernized and elaborate transportation network of buses and the Metro. The city contrasts with some large European cities in that it is extremely clean, and city employees in bright yellow vests can almost always be seen cleaning the streets and sidewalks. Like most large cities, however, there is a substantial population of vagrants and beggars lining the streets.

Madrid is one of the biggest and most cosmopolitan cities in Europe. Communities of West Africans, North Africans, other Europeans, Chinese, Indians, Filipinos, Pakistanis, and (especially) Latin Americans are prominent.

Some popular neighborhoods are:
* Alonso Martínez - Many pubs and small discos are active until about 3AM. A very young crowd, and if you′re around here before midnight, and over the age of 20, prepare to feel positively old. Most places close around 3AM, then people move to nearby areas to continue partying (clubs in Gran Vía or Tribunal).
* Barrio de las Letras / Huertas - Many of Spain's most famous writers lived there (Cervantes, Quevedo, etc.). It's in between Lavapiés, Puerta del Sol, and Paseo del Prado. It is an area full of history and interesting buildings and is also well-known because of its concentration of bars, pubs, restaurants, and hotels. Plaza de Santa Ana is a beautiful square. It can be considered "too touristic" for some local people.
* Chueca - Near Malasaña and Gran Vía. It is the gay district (although no one is ever excluded) with a very strong personality. New design, trendy shops, cool cafes. Pop and electronic music. By far, the most cosmopolitan place in town. Has become quite chic and expensive.
* Ciudad Universitaria - area where most of the students reside as there are several dorms in this area. There are many cheap bars with great nightlife starting from Thursdays.
* Conde Duque - Like Malasaña, this district shares a similar audience. Calle Conde Duque is full of cafés and restaurants. Between the main squares in the district, Plaza de Guardias de Corps and Plaza de las Comendadoras, you will also find other options to have drinks, cafés, or tapas. The Conde Duque Cultural Centre usually hosts shows, concerts, and exhibitions. 
* Gran Vía - The place that never sleeps. A major street that includes many popular nightclubs usually is open from 1AM to 6-7AM.
* La Latina - It is the place near Lavapiés to go for tapas and is full of bohemian young people looking for stylish bars. In the old section, many small bars and pubs, a generally older crowd (the late 20s, 30s - you know, "adults"). Contains La Cava Baja street. Avoid places in the Plaza Mayor but sunbathing and beers are suitable. Multiple bars serving fantastic tapas in the Cava Baja and Cuchilleros. The area centered on Calle Calatrava (what the locals call 'Chuecatina') is has developed into a gay (very hetero-friendly) zone. It's surprisingly very crowded on Sunday mornings, from 11AM to late in the afternoon due to its close location to the flea market El Rastro.
* Lavapiés - Multicultural quarter of the city, with more than 50% foreign residents, mostly from Africa, Asia, and Latin America. An increasing amount of westerners are choosing Lavapies as their residence in Madrid, mainly because of the hip vibe it has attained in recent years. Plenty of world music bars and many alternative theaters and art galleries. Lavapiés is maybe the most cosmopolitan and hippy area at the same time in Madrid. Indian restaurants, alternative cafés, African music, and South American shops. Several community gardens, food co-ops, and eco shops are scattered around the district. Not a lot of tourists here since the quarter holds no monumental sights but has a rather unique atmosphere. Walking around for a beer or a coffee is well worth it.
* Moncloa - Due to its proximity to the main University in Madrid (Universidad Complutense), Moncloa is associated with students and a student lifestyle, many cheap bars, and discos as it is near the university, although some of the places are best avoided.
* Salamanca - Plenty of expensive boutiques, unique shops with impossible prices, and department stores. 
* Torre Europa. In front of the stadium, under the tower, there were several luxury pubs and clubs. There are 4 or 5 bars and discos in the Avenida de Brazil area catering to a young and student crowd.
* Tribunal / Malasaña - Hip area. You can enjoy a café, a dinner, a book or just some drinks. Mainly rock and pop music clubs, some of them still open from "La movida madrileña" (a vibrant cultural period from the early 80s). Calle Manuela Malasaña is a great place to eat. Such is Calle del Pez although it has mostly bars. Plaza Dos de Mayo is the heart of the district and a great place to have a drink.

Get in

By plane

Adolfo Suárez Madrid-Barajas Airport (), +34 902 404 704, is located 13km from the city center. It is one of the largest airports in Europe and is serviced by many airlines, as well as being the home base for Iberia Airlines. The airport has 4 terminals. Terminals 1, 2, and 3 are close together and served by the same metro station, while Terminal 4 is far from those and has its own metro and commuter train stations. 

The traveler may be required to show a valid visa at the airport immigration, depending both on the duration and purpose of their stay in Spain

The best way to move downtown is to take the Metro (line 8 pink, from 06:30 to 01:30, to/from the airport) to Nuevos Ministerios station from all terminals. It is clean, safe, frequent, fast, and inexpensive. The airport is located within the city limits of Madrid and is just 9 km (6 miles) away in 25 minutes from the city's financial district. In order to reach the city center (Sol, Ópera, or Gran Vía), or other stations consult the metro map. 

Terminal 4 of the airport, in additionally to the metro network, is also connected to the city by Cercanias commuter train (line C-1, from 06:00 to 22:30, €3.10) which goes directly to Atocha and Chamartin mainline train stations. To connect the Sol, take the train (look for Renfe Cercanias) to "Nuevos Ministerios" and then transfer to line C-3 or C-4 southbound on platform 8. Sol will be the first stop. If you are connecting to a long-distance or AVE train at Atocha or Chamartin, then your Cercanias (C-1, and any connecting C trains) ticket is free. You will still need to get the actual Cercanias ticket. Ask at the RENFE kiosk at Barajas Terminal 4 directly across from the automatic machines where most people purchase their C-1 ticket (just before you reach the C-1 turnstiles). Show your ticket to the attendant and they'll issue your free Cercanias ticket. 

Another way of reaching downtown is a 24-hour express bus service that passes all terminals and then goes direct to O'Donell, Cibeles (20 minutes walk or quick metro ride to Puerta del Sol) and Atocha (main train station, not serviced between 11:30 PM and 6 AM). The ticket is paid in cash to the bus driver. Departures every 12 minutes (daytime) to 35 minutes (late at night). Travel time Terminal 4 (end of the line) - Cibeles 30-40 minutes. 

Public bus No 200 operates between the airport and Avenida de América bus station in Madrid. You can use disposable, weekly, or 10-trip tickets. Bus 114 does NOT go to the airport terminals and is a 40-minute walk to Terminal 1. 

Public night bus N4 goes from Plaza Cibeles to Barajas district, a 400m walk from the terminal through a passageway over the highway. Best to get off at the second-last stop, Avenida General, and then make a right turn immediately after the bus stop. Go straight on, keep going straight crossing the parking lot, and then make a left to cross another huge parking lot. After that, you see the road and the pedestrian highway overpass. The disposable or the 10-trip ticket is valid.

From the Airport it is also possible to take a taxi. Journeys between the airport and the inner M30 area (city center), or vice versa, including those reserved electronically, are subject to a flat rate. 
* Premium Airport transfers to any destination. Online booking, immediate confirmation.
* Europe Shuttle offers the airport taxi transfer from or to Madrid Barajas Airport to any destination.
* Mad Shuttle operates 24 / 7 / 365 between the airport and city centre with all type of vehicles.
* Private Taxi with Driver Waiting for you at Airport Exit.

By train

* A train service operates to/from Madrid. Frequent trains operate between Madrid and (2h 40min), (2h 20 min), (2h 30 min), , , , , , Puertollano, , , the French coast, , with continuing journeys to most of .
Madrid has two train stations: Chamartín and Atocha, both of which have excellent Metro and Cercanias commuter train connections. Most northbound and international trains arrive and depart from Chamartín station, while trains to , and southern depart from Atocha. If you need to get between the two stations, Metro line 1 (30-40 minutes) or Cercanias lines C3 and C4 (15 minutes) offer the most direct connection.

Chamartín station is on the north side of the city and is served by the Metro stop of the same name on Metro lines 1 and 10. 

Atocha is on the southern side of the city center and is divided into two main sections, an area for Cercanias trains and one for long-distance trains. The long-distance side is set inside the towering old station, where you will find a tropical garden with a pond full of small turtles as well as a number of shops. A memorial to the victims of the terrorist attack is in the Cercanias portion of the station near the Metro stop.

By bus
Madrid has eight enormous international and intercity bus stations. Information on where buses to a particular destination depart from can be found at the Tourist Office.

Many of the international buses, and those headed south of Madrid, arrive at and depart from Estación Sur de Autobuses, Calle de Méndez Álvaro, Tel.+34 91-468-4200, which is accessible by metro. 

Buses to and from and operate from the Avenida de América bus terminal, also accessible by Metro.

By car
There are car rental facilities available at the airport, train stations, and other main travel sites. Always be sure to have a street map handy! The roads within Madrid are difficult to navigate as there are no places to stop so it's very handy to look at a map or check your route.

Also, if you are relying on GPS navigation, be aware that there are several consecutive junctions underground near the center and your GPS may not get a signal underground. Plan your turns before you enter the tunnels.

Madrid city is well covered by the main global car rental companies, such as Avis, Budget, Hertz, Thrifty & Europcar, some of these also provide Rent to Buy Facilities. All car rental companies offer competitive pricing for economy-class vehicles and unlimited mileage options. Some local car rental companies may also offer competitive pricing.

Parking within the city follows the pay-and-display system, daily from 9am to 9pm (limited on Saturdays, and all of August, to 9am to 15pm, and being free on Sundays).

Get around
By public transit
Madrid has one of the best public transport networks in the world and the second largest metro network in Europe, second only to London's. Buses and subways form an integrated network and work with the same ticket. Alternatively, you can buy unlimited travel passes as follows: 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 5 days, or 7 days. Children under the age of 4 may travel without a ticket. Children under 11 receive a 50% discount. Tickets can be purchased at Metro stations, newsstands, and estancos (tobacconists').

Train
Madrid has a system of local trains Cercanías that connect outlying suburbs and villages with the city center. Although most useful for visiting historic or outdoor destinations outside the city core, they are also useful for quickly getting from the north end of the city (Chamartin and Nuevos Ministerios) to the south end of the city (Sol and Atocha) and, Barajas airport (terminal 4).

Metro

The Metro de Madrid (Madrid's Subway/Underground) is one of the better and less expensive metros in Europe. It is an underground railway network that covers practically the entire metropolitan area and airport. In addition, the underground tunnels of the Metro provide relief from the sun on hot days. Ticket machines are multilingual with instructions in Spanish, English, French, and German. 

The Tourist Card is the most practical ticket for visitors, valid for all the public transportation system (metro + buses + trains) for 1, 2, 3, 5, or 7 calendar days and 2 zones: A and T. Prices depend upon the selection and validity. It is an electronic contactless card and can be purchased from ticket machines at all Metro stations, including the airport. Credit cards are accepted, but if your card doesn’t work even with a PIN, the airport metro has a counter which sells this card and has a credit card terminal.

When you travel to or from airport stations, there is an additional supplement, which can be paid at the entrance or exit. The Passes or Tourist Card do not require this supplement - it is included in the price. You can catch some trains as late as 2:00AM, although the official closing time for the metro system is at 1:30AM.

Announcements in the metro are made in both Spanish and English on most major lines, including the line to and from the airport. Along with this, almost all metro stops have a map of the exits and the surrounding area above the station.
However, most stations don't have a map of the Metro lines on the platform so prepare for your travel in advance and don't expect to plan your journey on the go.

Bus
Whatever the Metro doesn't cover, the buses do. Night buses (Búhos, "night owls"), have their main hub at Plaza de Cibeles, covering most of the city at roughly 20-minute intervals. Buses are equipped with a free wi-fi facility (EMTmadrid), easy to use with any type of laptop or netbook.

By taxi
Taxis can be hard to find during late hours on weekends, especially if there is some rain. Unlike in other European cities, there are few taxi stands. Just stand by the side of a major road or bus stop and wave your hand to signal an available taxi passing by. Available taxis have a green libre sign on the windshield and a green light on top. 

Official taxis are white and have a red stripe and the flag of Madrid on the front door. The tariff is displayed on top of the car (a 1 during the daytime, a 2 during the night, which becomes 2 and 3 on holidays such as Christmas Eve). 

There are also special surcharges for entering or leaving the airport/train station. Ask for the written table of tariffs and charges (suplementos) (shown on small stickers on rear windows, compulsory by law) before paying if you think it's too expensive. 

Be aware there are some taxi drivers that will do what is called 'la vuelta al ruedo' which basically means they will drive you around or through the crowded avenues to increase the fare.

Most taxi drivers do not speak English, so you should have the names and/or addresses of your destinations written in Spanish to show your taxi driver. Likewise, get your hotel's business card in case you get lost.

By car
Transportation by private automobile in Madrid can be a nightmare. The Spanish capital suffers from the typical problems of most big cities; far too many cars and not enough space to accommodate them. Sometimes there can even be traffic jams in the Paseo de la Castellana at 3:00 AM (early to some Madrileños). The problem is compounded by the narrow streets in the old town, where a lorry delivering beer barrels to a local bar can cause a huge tailback. Finding a parking space can be very time-consuming, and difficult if one is not skilled in the art of close proximity parallel parking. Many Spaniards are also lacking in this art, prompting them to simply park in the street, blocking other cars in. If you find yourself blocked in by such a practice, honk your horn until the driver returns. If you parallel park your car in Madrid, be aware that most Madrileños park by sound alone. They will feel no remorse for repeatedly hitting the car in front and behind them while trying to get into or out of a tight spot. If you value your car's paint job, or you have rented a car, it may be best to park underground. Though this is no guarantee for nobody hitting your car, the chances are somewhat diminished.

In short, renting a car is not only unnecessary, but not recommended for getting around downtown Madrid, and a car is likely to be more of a liability than an asset. Visitors should make use of Madrid's excellent public transportation instead. Renting a car only makes sense if you are planning to leave Madrid and drive to the nearby towns.

By bicycle

Although Madrid does not appear as a bike-friendly city at a first sight, things are changing slowly to make the bike experience more comfortable. Several streets in the historical downtown have been transformed into mixed-traffic spaces where pedestrians and bikes have priority over cars. There are new easy-bike paths all along the river and connecting important parks. 

It is also possible to use a lot of narrow easy streets where traffic is slow and calm to travel along the city without depending on exclusive bike paths. There are some official and unofficial publications on these streets along the web

To avoid some of Madrid's inconveniencies, such as hot weather or slopy streets it is also possible to get bikes on Metro and Railways trains with some schedule restrictions, and on every public transport without restrictions when using folding-bikes.

There is a public rent-a-bike service Bicimad There are also some rental shops in the historical center area such as the company Baja Bikes and Urban Zero These companies offer several rental points in Madrid (Retiro, Atocha, Madrid-Río, etc.). They offer Guided and self-guided bicycle tours, using electric or conventional bicycles.

By segway 
Madrid is relatively flat, so it's easily to move by bicycle, skateboard, rollerblade. Book a segway tour in Madrid or rent one and move through the city without walking. It's secure. If you want to know more about the different sights, what to do, where to eat or hang out you should go with a guide.

Talk
While knowledge of the English language is increasing among the younger generations, the majority of Madrid's residents know only a few words — even employees at American businesses such as McDonald's, KFC, or Burger King, and employees at cash exchange centers rarely speak much English. You can often find someone with a fair grasp of English at larger hotels and tourism sites, but it would nevertheless be helpful to know at least a few common .

Landmarks and architecture

* This massive cathedral faces the Palacio Real. Finished near the end of the 20th century, it is the church where the Princes of Asturias Felipe and Letizia were married in 2004.
* On the north side of the city and bisected by Paseo de la Castellana, this plaza is in the center of Madrid's skyscraper district. A tall obelisk sits in the center of the plaza while the Gate of Europe (Puerta de Europa) two slanted towers framing the boulevard, are situated on the north side of the plaza. Taking the #27 bus, which runs along Paseo del Prado and Paseo de la Castellana ends at Plaza de Castilla, will take you past several Madrid highrises. North of the Plaza is the Four Towers (Cuatro Torres), actually five new skyscrapers (Torre Cepsa 248 m (815 ft), Torre PwC 236 m (774 ft), Torre de Cristal 249 m (817 ft), Torre Espacio 230 m (750 ft), Fifth Tower 180 m (591 ft)) that are the tallest in Spain. The construction of the skyscrapers began in 2004.

* A massive roundabout at the intersection of Calle de Alcala and Paseo del Prado. This plaza houses one of Madrid's icons, the Fountain of Cibeles, which portrays the Roman goddess of fertility sitting upon a chariot carried by two lions. On the southeast corner dominating the Plaza is one of the world's most beautiful city halls, the Palacio de Cibeles (formerly the Palacio de las Comunicaciones), an impressive structure with a jaw-droppingly spectacular facade. Inside you can climb to the upper floors for the excellent views out the window and look out too. On the southwest corner of the square sits the imposing Bank of Spain (Banco de España) building, while the northeast corner is home to the Palacio de Linares, which holds the Casa de América a cultural center with an art gallery of Latin American works.
* Baroque-style gardens surrounds a large monument to Philip IV. Dozens of statues of other kings line the garden. In good weather, there are often quite a few street performers here.
* Literally "Great Way" (better translated as "Broadway"), Gran Vía is one of the busiest avenues in Madrid. Running from Plaza de España to Plaza de Cibeles, it is a location of the cinema district and a number of shopping malls and is lined with large billboards and lights. There's a constant buzz of traffic and life. From 3-4 early morning traffic jams are not unusual.
* Perhaps the best known plaza in Madrid. This impressive square is now one of the main stops on any tourist's visit. Originally built outside the city walls, this enclosed square hosted bullfights, markets, symphonies, tournaments and executions. Today it is ringed with tourist shops, cafes and restaurants. The statue of Philip III sits in the middle across from the Casa de la Panadería, a beautifully painted building with two towers on the north side of the square (not to be confused with the other building with two towers on the opposite side) which once served as the headquarters of the bakers' guild and now houses a tourist information office. Access to the square is via one of the many arcades which connect to the surrounding pedestrian streets.

* The Palacio Real (Royal Palace) is an enormous palace, one of the biggest in Europe, with plains of concrete around it. Though it is the official residence of the King of Spain, the royal family does not actually reside here and it is generally used only for state ceremonies. The Royal Palace is considered to be one of the most iconic and beautiful buildings in Madrid, not only for its location (overlooking the river valley) but also for its architecture and the artistic treasures to be found in the rooms. A simple one-way tour of the palace (both self-guided and guided are available) takes you up the grand stairway and through the lavishly decorated state rooms with their elegant tapestries, frescoes, porcelain, carvings and added decor like china, silverware, medals, etc. From the courtyard, you can access the Farmacia (Pharmacy), which contains hundreds of bottles of early medicines and a reconstructed laboratory, and the Real Armorial (Royal Armory), a two-story collection of medieval weapons and armor. Explanations in the armory are in Spanish only, so do not expect to understand much unless your know the Spanish names for all that medieval weaponry. The lines to get in are very long, especially on Wednesday when the place is free - try to go early. Photography inside the palace is not allowed.
* A prominent square on the northwest side of the central district, adjacent to two of the tallest buildings in Madrid: the Torre de Madrid (the taller, white one) and the Edificio España (the red and white one). The square contains a large fountain and a sculpture of Cervantes with his famous Don Quixote and Sancho Panza characters.
* This indoor market is located near Plaza Mayor and identifiable by its ornate iron posts. Built in 1913, it's full of a wide range of high-quality food. Even if you're not buying anything, it's worth entering for the sights and smells of dried ham, fine wine, freshly baked goods, and other treats from the vendors inside.
* This plaza is the heart of Madrid and one of the busiest places in the city - a hub for the local transit system, a favorite meeting spot for locals, an area for festivals or political demonstrations, and a suitable location for tour guides, street performers, pickpockets and anyone else looking to take advantage of all the tourists on hand. In the center of the plaza sits the Statue of King Charles III on horseback, facing the Royal Post Office (Real Casa de Correos), the red-and-white building adorned with a clock tower on the plaza's south side. Originally the building served as Madrid's first post office, then the police headquarters under Franco before being transformed into its current use as the office of the President of Madrid, the head of the regional government. The clock tower is noteworthy for being the center focus of New Year's celebrations every year, which are broadcast across Spain and mark the traditional eating of the Twelve Grapes (one for each ring of the bell) and the beginning of a new year. In front of the building is Kilometer Zero (Kilómetro Cero), a plaque showing the point where the measuring of the national highway system begins. On the east side of the plaza is the famous Bear and the Madroño Tree Statue, a bear climbing a madroño tree, which is the symbol of Madrid. Nearby the giant neon sign of Tío Pepe sits above the plaza and is a famous figure of this area.
* The main square during the Middle Ages, as Calle Mayor (High Street) was the main street as well. It houses the former City Hall, the former Academy of Fine Arts, and the Archbishopric.

Museum Triangle

This is Madrid's museum district, named for the three major art museums clustered along Paseo del Prado east of the old city: the Museo del Prado, one of the finest art museums in the world, the Thyssen-Bornemisza, a baron's collection of classical art, and the Reina Sofia Madrid's modern art museum. However, a couple of smaller museums also occupy the neighborhood which are worth seeing as well. It is important to note that many of the museums offer free entry during the certain times most days. It varies by museum and day, if you are looking to take advantage of these beautiful museums with a lesser budget, it's still possible and you are willing to queue. For example, the Prado sometimes has queues of over 200 meters with several hundred people, yet one could stroll into the Thyssen on Monday at 1pm.

* A private museum of contemporary art and culture that is particularly well-known for the "vertical garden" by Patrick Blanc installed on a wall in front of the museum, as well as the quite special architecture of the building itself. The vertical garden can be seen from the street outside, just a block south of the Thyssen-Bornemisza and across from the Prado. Inside the museum has free exhibitions and functions.
* Beautiful museum with vast interesting collections about Spanish sailing. The Juan De La Cosa map, the oldest known map showing America, is held here. You will be asked for a donation on the free days.
* One of the finest art collections in the world and the best collection of classical art in Madrid. It includes many different collections: the Spanish (El Greco, Velázquez, and Goya), the Flemish and Dutch (Rubens, van Dyck, and Brueghel), Italian (Botticelli, Tintoretto, Titian, Caravaggio, and Veronese) and German (Albrecht Dürer, Lucas Cranach, and Baldung Grien).

Their biggest rivals by far are FC Barcelona, with which it contests matches known popularly as El Clásico at least twice a year. The rivalry between the two sides is by far the biggest in Spain and one of the most intense in the world and stems from the longstanding traditional rivalry between the Spanish and Catalan-speaking parts of Spain.

Eat
Cuisine
Dishes popular throughout are also widely served in Madrid.

In addition, Madrid has a number of "typical" dishes:

* Callos a la Madrileña - A hot pot of spicy beef tripe similar to those found in Turkey and the Balkans.
* Cocido Madrileño - Chickpea stew with meat and vegetables. The particularity of this stew is the way it is served. The soup, chickpeas and meat are served and eaten separately. 
* Gallinejas and Entresijos - Portions from different parts of lamb fried in its fat. Very traditional and typical of Madrid city.
* Oreja de Cerdo - Pigs ears, fried with garlic. This popular dish is widely eaten throughout central Spain.
* Sopa de Ajo - Garlic soup is a rich oily soup that generally includes paprika, grated Spanish ham, fried bread, and a poached egg. A variation of this soup is known as Sopa Castellana.

It is ironic that Madrid, located right in the center of Spain has higher-quality seafood than most coastal regions. This quality comes at a price, and most Spaniards only occasionally shell out for a mariscada (Spanish for "seafood feast"). So, tasting Madrid's seafood can be an experience that will be worth the cost for the visitor.

Meat and meat products (Jamon Iberico, morcilla, chorizo, etc.) are of generally a very high quality in and particularly in Madrid.

Restaurants
Many of the restaurants and cervecerías (breweries) in the Sol and Plaza Mayor area have "generic" poster board advertisements on the sidewalks with pictures advertising various paella dishes. These paellas are usually of bad quality and should be avoided. If you are looking for good, authentic Spanish paella, it is usually best to find a more expensive, "sit-down" type of restaurant that offers a variety of paella dishes. 

A much better option is the La Latina neighborhood just south of Plaza Mayor, especially along Cava Baja street. To enjoy a gastronomic tour of this area you can join the Old Madrid Tapas & Wine Tour There are also a number of deli-like shops along Calle Arenal that offer food para llevar (for takeaway).

At bars, one generally orders various sized plates, a ración meaning a full dish, a media ración a half dish or a smaller version which would be a tapa, a pinxto or a pincho.

The Spaniards don't eat lunch until 2 or 3 pm, and dinner doesn't start until 9 or 10 pm. As a rule of thumb, restaurants serve lunch from 1PM (earlier in touristic zones) until 3:30PM, then close and reopen for dinner at 8:00PM, serving until 11:00PM. This schedule is usually for restaurants since the bars and "mesones" are usually open all day long offering a wide variety of "tapas" and "bocadillos"(rolls) for a low price. If you're really desperate, the standard bunch of fast food chains does stay open throughout the day.

Budget
* The place for serious hamburgers. Americans will feel at home.

You can't book but the entrance bar can start you off with drinks and anything off the menu while you wait for seating upstairs or below (upstairs is worth the wait). Don't miss their signature dish of scrambled eggs with sausage, veggies or jamon but also try the artchokes with foie or the shredded quail salad.
* Serves typical Madrid cuisine. Try there Cocido madrileño, a substantial dish prepared with meat and vegetables.
* Best paella in Madrid, but only if you bring more than two people by order of the proprietor. Frequented mainly by locals.

The perfect spot to enjoy some of the best "pintxos" (Basque tapas) with friends accompanied by a cold beer or taste the house specialty, cod. A fish that the chef prepares in various different ways: croquettes, stewed, scrambled, deep fried. All of them are of excellent quality and presentation. Located in the mythical district of Tetuan, Tasca la Farmacia is a must for those wanting to experience authentic Basque cuisine inside the city of Madrid.

Usually closed in August.

Among his specialties are the Big Duck (duck burger, green mustard ice cream, idiazabal cheese, and bread), Bacalao al estilo Freixa (Freixa-style cod), and the famous Bogavante en micro menú (Lobster in the micro menu). All of which definitely earn the 2 Michelin stars awarded.

Stay safe
Madrid is a relatively safe city. The police are visible, and the city is equipped with cameras. There are always a lot of people in the streets, even at night time, so you can walk across the city generally without fear. Travelers who remain aware of their surroundings, and keep an eye on their belongings should have little to worry about.

Madrid has a significant amount of nonviolent crime so always watch any bags you have with you especially on the Metro and in busier public spaces. It is important for your safety to avoid falling asleep in the metro, which can leave you particularly vulnerable to thefts. It is not unknown for thieves to cut jean trouser pockets in order to steal belongings. 

Be careful when carrying luggage, especially if anyone approaches you with an outspread map in hand asking for directions. It's entirely possible that this is a trap to distract you while an accomplice steals your luggage.

When using ATM machines, be aware of your surroundings, just as you would be anywhere. Bring a friend if you need to withdraw cash after dark. 

Beware of thieves preying on people leaving nightclubs who have had a lot to drink. Do NOT carry valuables on a night out.

Be aware of young men and boys who are indicating they are deaf or homeless and trying to get you to sign a piece of paper. This also can be a ruse to distract you in order to steal your belongings. These thieves sometimes enter cafes/bars so make sure you do not leave wallets or phones on the table as possessions on show make for easy targets. The area around Calle de las Infantes near Gran Via is particularly renowned for this. 

Avoid people offering masaje (massages). Be firm and say "No me toques" (Don't touch me) or "No tengo dinero" (I don't have any money) and keep walking. This is often a scam to extort money.

Coffee shops such as Starbucks are typically full of locals and tourists playing with mobile phones, laptops, and tablets. Groups of gypsy kids are often seen raiding such establishments - they favor branches with two exits and run from one to the other, grabbing whatever they can. Control yourself and hold onto your belongings if something is suspicious.

Street drinking (Botellón) is a very popular and cheap night out. However, be careful as drinking in the street is against the law and the police can and will fine you.
