The city layout of Roanoke does not lend itself well to effective mass transit, and in fact most locals never use mass transit at all. The city does operate a fairly extensive bus system, Valley Metro, that serves most commonly-visited points in the valley. Valley Metro began operating a new bus service in 2004 called The Smart Way, which connects Blacksburg and the New River Valley with Roanoke.
