Understand
Settled in 1812, the city is situated on a gentle horseshoe bend on the Ohio River and is often referred to as "River City." One of the most popular attractions in the region is Casino Aztar, the first riverboat casino in the state of Indiana. Evansville is also home to both the University of Evansville and the University of Southern Indiana.

The broad economic base of the region has helped to build an economy that is known for its stability, diversity, and vitality. In 2004 Evansville was named an "All-America City" by the National Civic League. In 2008 it was voted the best city in the country in which "to live, work, and play" by the readers of Kiplinger, and in 2009 the 11th best.

The River City is known for its southern-style hospitality, economic vitality, and proud German heritage. Evansville's culture is a combination of Midwestern charms and Southern family values and is fairly distinct from the culture of Indiana's other major cities (South Bend, Indianapolis, Fort Wayne) likely as a result of being isolated from them geographically without a major highway to connect them. The strong economic base provided by giant Toyota and AK Steel plants has allowed the city to thrive in the face of the nationwide recession. Additionally, the vibrant growth of the University of Southern Indiana (established in 1965) has resulted in a strong youth presence and an active and enjoyable nightlife.
