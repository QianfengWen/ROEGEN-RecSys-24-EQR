* Uzungöl, a lake up in the mountains 99 km from Trabzon, 19 km from Caykara and at an altitude of 1090 m. A great number of broken rocks from the slopes filled up Haldizen stream and Uzungöl was formed in this way. The lake is 1000 m long, 500 m in width and 15 m in depth. It is surrounded by forests. Uzungöl has an interesting view with the village houses around it. And there are some other small lakes on the mountains which are 15-20 km. from Uzungöl. The lake is also surrounded by convenient tracks for hiking. There are some facilities such as bungalows and some establishments which rear trout. Tourism agencies organise tours for the day in the summer. You can use local transport to go to this place: From Trabzon's regional dolmus station (5 min walking downhill east from Atatürk Alanı) there are busses (Çaykara Tur) to Uzungöl via Of and Çaykara about every 75 min (e.g. 11.30am, 14 TL, at least 2h). Tickets can be bought from Çaykara Tur's small office (Sanayi, Yalı Cad. / ayışık Sok. D:7, its a side street from Martı Hotel).

In high season it might be wise to buy your return ticket when arriving in Uzungöl(or already in Trabzon), if you intend to go back to Trabzon the same day. The seats for the afternoon buses might sell out quickly and you might have to wait for the last evening bus. If you ask the driver he will also drop you at Trabzon's otogar.

Sümela Monastery

It is possible to go there and to have a look from outside (what is still worth), but you cannot enter the monastery. A few tours start with minibuses from Trabzon in the morning. If you want to go on your own by public transportation (might be more expensive than joining a tour!) you can go to the regional dolmus station (5 min walking downhill east from Atatürk Alanı). There are frequent dolmus to Maçka (e.g. around 10am), which may continue all the way up to Sümela monastery (from Trabzon 60 TL return for 1-2 pax, less when you find more people going to Sümela and you use your bargaining skills; waiting time max 1h, what is more than sufficient, since the monastery is closed). A taxi from Maçka would cost 70-80 TL return. 

As of July 2019, there is at least two direct dolmuş from Trabzon to Sümela monastery. They will depart around 11am and 2pm. It will bring you at Sümela, let you walk around there and take you back to Trabzon. The whole trip (Trabzon to Trabzon) costs 25 TL and lasts for about 4 hours.

Sümela Monastery (Turkish: Sümela Manastırı; Panagia Soumela, "Virgin Mary of Soumela" in Greek) is a spectacular rock-hewn monastery perched dramatically on the narrow ledge of a steep cliff in the forests south of Trabzon. It was built in the fourth century, just before the Roman Empire split into east and west, by two Athenian priests, Barnabas and Sophronius, who, according to legend, found a miraculous icon of the Virgin Mary in a cave. The monastery's location in this geopolitically tumultuous corner of the globe naturally saw times of trouble and fell into ruin numerous times throughout its history, with its most thriving times falling under Byzantine and Ottoman rule.

The twentieth century, however, was not kind to the monastery. It was abandoned following the chaos and inter-ethnic violence at the end of World War I, and the population transfer of Trabzon's (formerly Trebizond) Greek population to . Its remote location gave it some sanctuary, but its frescoes still attracted the occasional casually hurled rock by a bored shepherd. The beautiful frescoes today suffer from decades of heart-wrenchingly pointless vandalism by travelers&mdash;judging from the various alphabets and names scrawled across these impressive religious works of art, it appears that just about every culture in the world has taken part in the desecration. The buildings themselves have been fairly heavily restored in recent decades, as the Turkish government has stepped in to protect the monastery and to turn it into a museum.

Admission is 15 TL. The simplest way to get to the monastery is by tour, and you can find a tour in town by just asking any other traveler there (no tourist visits Trabzon without seeing Sümela). The monastery lies close to , about 30 km south of Trabzon, and those preferring to get to the monastery on their own means instead of taking a tour can get to Maçka by taking minibuses heading for , or other destinations south from Trabzon. The rest of the way, approximately 17 km to the actual site of monastery, can be done by dolmuşes from downtown Maçka (although only in high-season and not during off-season), which will take you to the entrance of Altındere National Park (Milli Park). Then, the monastery is about half an hour walk away, which can be done through a forest trail, which was recently widened in order to cope with the ever increasing numbers of visitors, or along the tarmac road leading to the monastery. Those approaching with their own vehicles can get as near as 300 meters to Sümela itself, where there is a car-park in front of Hagia Barbara Chapel. There is an additional fee of 20 TL for cars, paid at the entrance of the national park.

Do

*This art gallery is made by mr Azmi Aytekin, a 73 year old painter and thinker from Zigana. He has traveled around the world and has settled in the small village Zigana (also called Kalkanli) near the magnificent Zigana mountains. Visit his homepage for pictures.

* Trabzonspor why not watch a match of the local football team, Trabzonspor, the most successful team in Turkey outside of . If you are in the city on a weekend, you can watch the team at the Hüseyin Avni Stadium. It's about a 20-30 minute walk west of the main square. If in doubt, ask a local "Trabzonspor Stadyumu" and they will point you in the correct direction.
*If you're brave, try traditional Turkish bath (Hamam). The men-only Hamam is right next to Efes Pub; the women-only Hamam is just around the corner. A really great authentic Turkish experience, and the people are very nice and will walk you through everything. 25 TL for a bath (including scrubbing and massage) at the women's Hamam, and you should also tip your masseuse.

Buy

There is a shopping mall near Novotel called Cevahir Outlet, in Yomra town which lies 5 minutes away from Trabzon.
There is a shopping mall near Ataturk Airport called "Forum".

Eat

There are nice local meals really worth a try. Especially, pide and köfte are really famous with their taste in Turkey. Pide is kind of pizza which is made with a special bread and cheese. You can also try "kiymali" which is made with meat and served with butter. 

You can find a cheap but good place near city center called "Çardak Pide Salonu"

Kuzen is also a good option: no standard kebabs but (for example) delicious wrap-like rolls filled with hot Merkez sausage... It's in Cevdet Akcay sokak next to the modernish shopping mall on the north side of Kahraman Marash Cad.

Another special taste of Trabzon is Akcaabat koftesi which is meatballs. Made with meat, garlic and bread it's very delicious with ayran(yogurt mixed with water) and piyaz (beans,lettuce). There are clean and nice places in Akcaabat town such as Nihat Usta, Keyvan, Cemil Usta, Korfez Restaurant. You can have a walk and drink tea after dinner in Akcaabat Fisher Port.

Another nice place is Harran Kebap on Kahramanmaraş Caddesi, not far from the main square.

Trabzon has the best bread in the country called Vakfikebir ekmegi. Give it a try, you won't regret it.

Lahmacun ("Laa-mach-june") is a great thing to try, it's like a very thin pizza with mince meat on the top. They are cheap, healthy and taste very nice the only problem is a sophisticated oven is required to cook them so not all restaurants have them, but if they are possible they are well worth getting. You usually order an Ayran (pronounced "i-RUN") with it which is a salt youghurt drink that aids digestion.

All food in Trabzon is cooked to a high hygienic standard, and additionally most restaurants give you free hand wipes to clean your hands before and after eating food.

Hamsi Balik (Anchovies or sprat) is also a good option.

*This restaurant is a really hip and popular place among Trabzon locals. It has a pretty standard menu of a Turkish/Mexican/Italian fusion with lots of sweets. Their profiterol is good and so are the herbal teas, but the best is their breakfast with kuymak.

The place is frequented by local professionals and students because of its hidden place on the seventh floor of an office building. On the wall are many clocks with various times, decorated under the concept that this place is a place to forget the actual time and enjoy the present. The owner, Mehmet, really make you feel at home.

Drink

There are only a few restaurants in the center serving alcohol. Among them Bordo Mavi in the garden of clubhouse of Trabzonspor. Thankfully, the popular Efes Pub is right off Ataturk Square, just down the street from the Burger King. They only serve snacks like fries and peanuts, but are open until midnight. Ladies, note that the far half of the bar (partitioned) is for men only.

For those longing for real (European-style) coffee, Keyif Coffee & Tea Store has a huge selection of Tea (listing them by area and even Tea Estate) and first rate Cappachino (3 TL). They are hidden within the shopping complex Canbakkal İş Merkezi, a few blocks to the west of Atatürk Alani square.

Sleep
You can ask at the tourist information on Attatürk square (Atatürk Alanı) where they know about different accomodations. At small, but a little bit more expensive hotels, you can also try to bargain a cheaper price than the first one offered to you.

The area around İskenderpaşa Cami and Atatürk Alanı Meydan Parkı is full of hotels of various quality and price range. The cheapest hotels are down from Ataturk Square towards the port, but they usually function as unofficial brothels. By European standards the area is safe, however, and the prostitutes quite discreet. Between those hotels, Hotel Erzurum was acceptable and frequented by backpackers.
