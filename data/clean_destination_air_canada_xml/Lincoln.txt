The county town of Lincoln, is a cathedral city nestled between two portions of the Lincoln Edge - a steep escarpment that dominates the mostly flat county. Most famous for its cathedral and castle, housed within a Roman–medieval street plan.

The oldest section of the city, in which the cathedral and castle reside, sit at the top of Steep Hill. From the bottom of the hill a pedestrianised shopping street leads to the more modern (and trendy) portions of the city - Brayford Pool and the university.

Understand
Lincoln Castle Square Tourist Information Centre is at 9 Castle Hill, Lincoln.

Get in
By road
Lincoln sits on the A46 between , , and , , and the A15, between and . Lincoln is surrounded by minor roads and Lincolnshire itself has no motorways. The central area of Lincoln consists of narrow one-way roads and pedestrianised areas so driving is not recommended. The St. Marks shopping centre has ample parking, and there is a multi-storey car park in the centre of town, near the University and Brayford Pool.

Stagecoach operate local buses linking Lincoln with most towns in Lincolnshire although they may only operate every 2 hours. Sunday and evening services are sparse to non existant. 

A seasonal Christmas Market Park and Ride service is available and the easiest way to get to the Market. National Park and Ride Directory

Get around
The easiest way to get around central Lincoln is on foot. The city is small and compact with services and attractions within a few minutes walk of each other. One can walk from the easternmost end of Lincoln to the western end at a very leisurely pace in around one hour. 

Cars can be hired from two locations - Enterprise, located on the Outer Circle Road, and Hertz, found behind the Holiday Inn hotel (on Brayford Wharf). However, driving around the city itself is in-advised. Lincoln employs a complex one-way system that will quickly confuse tourists (and even some locals).

The main High Street is only a minute's walk away from the railway and bus stations. 

Public transport is as expected in a reasonable sized city. There are regular bus services; however, these are generally for journeys from the south of Lincoln and North Hykeham to the North of Lincoln rather than for short hops within the centre.

Minicabs are widely available. Prices are charged on a zone system and all of the firms are regulated by Lincoln City Council; you are well advised to avoid unlicensed companies - soliciting passengers for these cabs is illegal, and in the event of an accident they often have no insurance.

See

*Lincoln Cathedral Summer (approx Jul-Aug) M-F 7.15AM-8PM, Sa-Su 7.15AM-6PM, Winter M-Sa 7.15AM-6PM, Su 7.15AM-5PM. One of the finest and best situated Gothic buildings in Europe, now also famous as the location used to double as Westminster Abbey in The Da Vinci Code movie. For over 200 years it was the tallest building in the world, before its wooden spire collapsed following a storm in 1549. The roof tours are recommended. Architecturally, the cathedral has some of the earliest flying buttresses, and a gargoyle named the Lincoln Imp, with which several legends are associated. Adult &pound;8, Concession &pound;6.40.

*Lincoln Castle, Castle Hill, May-Aug 10AM-6PM, Apr & Sep 10AM-5PM, Oct-Mar 10AM-4PM. Closed 24-26 Dec, New Year's Eve and Day. Tours available at certain times throughout the day. First established in the Norman period, when the city of Lincoln ranked 3rd in the realm for prosperity and importance. Building started by William the Conquerer in 1068 on a site occupied since Roman times. Contains an original copy of The Magna Carta. It is home to families of ducks during the breeding season, despite having no lake or pond. Also a working Crown Court and a Victorian Prison museum. Has fabulous views from the walls and observatory tower over the city and beyond. Visitors can stand on the tower where the city's hangings took place, or descend by a ladder into the dungeon where prisoners waited, and see the manacles still on the walls. Gruesome. &pound;13.50, concessions available.

*Steep Hill is the medieval lane which connects the modern town centre with the cathedral quarter atop the hill. This cobbled street is a delight of old buildings, many of which contain the more interesting shops in the city, and including the Jew's House, a twelfth-century building associated with Lincoln's thriving Jewish community in medieval times. The street's name is accurate and after a handrail-assisted ascent you reach the Magna Carta pub which stands between the castle and the cathedral. Continue for a few yards if you can be tempted by an interesting ice-cream parlour - their downstairs cafe has you sitting by a tenth-century arch under a vaulted stone ceiling.

* The Lawn, a former psychiatric hospital, is now a visitor attraction which (as well as housing a conference centre) will be mainly of interest for the Sir Joseph Banks Conservatory, a free-to-enter hothouse with exhibits that Banks brought back from his travels with Captain Cook.

* Roman remains are scattered around the cathedral quarter, for example behind the cathedral are the excavated remains of the Roman east gate, and on the north side of the castle at the junction of Westgate and Bailgate are the excavated remains of a Roman well amid the walls. Walking along Bailgate, notice the circles of old stones in the modern road surface - these are the original foundations of Roman pillars which lined this route, Ermine Street which stretches from London to York.

* Ellis Mill, Mill Rd, Sa-Su, Apr-Sep, 2-5PM; Su, 2PM-dusk, Oct-Apr. A preserved windmill built in 1798, the last remaining example of the nine mills along the Lincoln Edge which milled flour for the city.

*A highly individual established cafe & cheese shop specialising in cheesy dishes, such as double baked souffles and baked Camembert. Also has non-cheese options. Uses many local producers. The food is freshly cooked and presented to a high standard. Light and airy, bistro style, with pretty slick service. Can get busy, as it seats 24, but well worth waiting for a table. Food is served until 4PM. Not suitable for under 10s. Licensed.

*Nando's, Brayford Waterfront. A chain restaurant specialising in Portuguese peri-peri chicken dishes, all of which are offered in a variety of spice strengths (lemon & herb, mango & lime, medium, hot, extra hot). Its service is very good and very prompt. Beware of the Extra hot serving! Prices are fairly cheap considering the size of portions you receive. There is no service charge and babies and children are very welcome.

*Pizza Express, High Street (at the corner with Grantham Street, in the upper half of the pedestrianised High Street). Don't let the name fool you! It doesn't serve pizza fast. It serves, some would say, the best pizza in all of Lincoln, but expect to pay somewhat higher prices!

Drink

*The Tower (part of a hotel) Great place to meet with friends up hill, more trendy that other bars in the area and serves mainly the aspirational and upcoming crowd.
