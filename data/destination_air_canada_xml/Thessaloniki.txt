'''Thessaloniki''' ([[Greek phrasebook|Greek]]: Θεσσαλονίκη, ''Selanik'' in Turkish and ''Солун'', ''Solun'' (''Солун'') Macedonian Slavic language) [http://www.thessaloniki.gr/portal/page/portal/EnglishPage], also known as Thessalonica (pron.: /ˌθɛsəlɵˈnaɪkə/ or pron.: /ˌθɛsəˈlɒnɪkə/) and '''Salonica''', is the second-largest city in Greece and the capital of the region of [[Central Macedonia]]. If you want to know more about Thessaloniki follow the official website of Visit Thessaloniki at [http://thessaloniki.travel/en/]

At about a million inhabitants, it is considered Greece's cultural capital, renowned for its festivals, events and vibrant cultural life in general and has recently been ranked by Lonely Planet as the world's fifth-best party city worldwide. More importantly, it is also a city with a continuous 3,000 year old history; preserving relics of its Roman, Byzantine, Ottoman past and of its formerly dominant Jewish population. Many of its Byzantine churches, and a whole district of the city in particular, are included in UNESCO's World Heritage list.

Thessaloniki lies on the northern fringe of the Thermaic Gulf on its eastern coast and is bound by Mount Chortiatis on its southeast. The metropolitan area of the city extends around an area of  1,455.62 km² (562.02 sq mi), which includes many beachside and hilly suburbs, while its densest part, which makes up the urban area of the city and what Thessalonians usually refer to as the "City of Thessaloniki", can be divided roughly into 3 parts, the north, the central and south. Thessaloniki is the capital of historical Macedonia and the birthplace of the Greek king Alexander the Great.

The central part, corresponding to the region that is inside the the Byzantine walls, forms the oldest part of the city and is divided in two sections: the city center, where most tourist sites and interests, entertainment and commercial activities happen, along with Ano Poli and Eptapyrgio (meaning the upper town and seven towers respectively), the heritage listed old town of Thessaloniki's city center which was not engulfed by the Great Fire of 1917 and still retains it's byzantine and ottoman influences. 

The city center is bounded by the sea in the south, Olympiados street in the northeast (from which then the upper town begins), Bardariou (aka Dimokratias) square in the northwest and in the southeast by the University campus of the Aristotle University and the facilities of Thessaloniki International Exhibition Center.

Most roads in the city center are either parallel or perpendicular to the sea. A simple rule that helps the visitor is that if the a street goes downhill, by following it, it will lead you to the sea. The biggest parallel streets to the sea starting from the sea are Nikis, Tsimiski, Ermou, Egnatia, Agiou Dimitriou and Kassandrou avenues. The  important streets leading to the sea, starting from northwest, are Ionos Dragoumi, Venizelou, the pedestrian streets Aristotelous and Hagia Sophia and Ethinikis Amynis avenues.

One of the burdens for visitors and inhabitants alike is finding a parking place in the Tessaloniki Urban Area, so be prepared to either spend a lot of time looking for a space, or pay for space in the parking facilities, with prices starting from €4 for 3 hr. Don't assume you're safe from paying a fine just because locals flagrantly flout parking laws. Traffic congestion is a problem, largely due to double-parked cars, but generally fellow drivers and passers-by are helpful in showing you the way if you get lost.

Actually one will find quite easy to find a free parking spot in Thessaloniki's hottest central area, the problem is, first, to know if you are allowed to park there, and second, to know how to legally park, which can be a tedious job to find. Here is where and how:
- there are different parking spots, signaled and marked different. In residential areas you'll find both parallel to road parking spots, and diagonal ones. Those marked with blue lines, or white with no special sign are usually only for residents which have a special vignette. In central area (zone A, C, E) search for parking areas on large boulevards, they are marked with the usual P sign, but with an additional plate with a 5 digit number. This is the "parking district" number. Park in the area of this sign and note the number. Than note the marking painted on the P sign, it's a logo with or without a text (like "PayPark" or "Thessy"). Find a convenient store or something like this (even kiosks) with this sign and ask for a parking ticket. The clerk will ask you for district number, car number (registration plate) and duration - max is 4 hours (EUR 6,-)> Another way is to install the special app (ParkPal) and use it. Additionally you can pay via SMS (numbers are available on street) but previously you should register to a website, which is less rapid and convenient for a short stay.

==Get around==

===By bus===
Public transport in Thessaloniki is served by buses, operated by the Thessaloniki Urban Transport Organization ('''OASTH''')[http://oasth.gr/index_eng.php] which runs a fleet of 604 vehicles on 75 routes throughout the Thessaloniki Metropolitan Area. Tickets for the buses can be bought on the bus, at a ''Periptero'' (kiosk), which are located all around the city, a mini-market and at an ''OASTH info point''. OASTH services operate from 5 a.m. until 12:30 past midnight, while some lines have expanded timetables until 1 a.m. Line 01X (changes to 01N at night with more stops but the same route) to the airport, operates 24/7 with lower frequency between 00:00 and 6:00. Furthermore, OASTH has recently published an excellent app available for IOS and Android that greatly simplifies the often confusing task of figuring out what's the right bus or combination of buses needed to get to the desired destination.

There are five types of tickets:

*'''One journey ticket''': Costs €0.90. '''Reduced''': 0.45€. Valid for one journey on any busline.

==See==

===Sightseeing===

The northernmost '''Byzantine walls''' of the city and parts of the western walls are still standing, as is the city's symbol - the '''White Tower''', one of the 16th Century. AD fortified towers - which is the only surviving tower on the seafront. The rest of the walls are in the picturesque Upper Town which offers a spectacular view over the bay, especially in the late afternoon. Take a walk along the enormous seafront '''promenade''' (about 12 km altogether). See the the '''Roman Forum''' excavations. 

Visit the upper town for its traditional old houses, small cobbled streets, Byzantine citadel, the '''Eptapyrgion''' fort.

On no account should you miss the Byzantine churches built between the 5th and 14th century ACE, such as '''Agios Demetrios''', (7th Century. ACE) and '''Agia Sophia''' (Holy Wisdome, 9th Century. ACE), and many lovely smaller ones in the upper town (St '''Nicolaos Orfanos''' is particularly worth a look for its frescoes (open Tue-Sun 8.30am-3pm)), which are on the '''UNESCO World Heritage''' List. One of them, the '''Rotunda''', started life as a Roman temple of Zeus, built by ceasar '''Galerius''', and is almost as old as the Pantheon in Rome. Next to the Rotunda, see the '''Arch of Triumph''' of Galerius and the ruins of his '''palace'''. 

[[Image:Agia_Sofia_front_July_2006.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The Agia Sofia church]]

The city is also known as "the mother of Israel", due to the once flourishing Jewish community here, which existed from the Roman period and grew substantially after the Ottoman Empire took in Jewish refugees expelled from Spain, Portugal, and Spanish territories in Italy; these Jews are known as "Sephardim". Sephardic Jews formed a significant percentage of the city's population and infrastructure until World War II, when, in spring 1943, almost all were deported by the Nazis to the extermination camp at Auschwitz, never to return. However, there are still two Synagogues, and you can see the Jewish Museum.

Also interesting are the Turkish public baths '''Bey Hamam''', the '''Bezesteni''' (Ottoman closed market for jewellery and precious materials) the Alatza Imaret (Ottoman poorhouse) and Hamza Bey Camii (both restored and used for exhibitions).

The traditional central food market, with hundreds of stalls selling meat, fish, fruit, vegetables (sometimes cheek-by-jowl, an unnerving experience for North Americans), cheap clothes and shoes, flowers, herbs and spices, between Aristotele Square and Venizelou street. 

Aristotelous Square-the biggest of the city-and the promenade with its cafes and restaurants.

The very lively and youth-oriented international film festival[http://filmfestival.gr/] is held in November, the International Trade Fair[http://tif.gr/] in September.

==Do==

The city has always been known between Greeks for its vibrant city culture, including having the most cafe's and bars per-capita than any other city in Europe (see: Drink); and as having some of the best nightlife and entertainment in the country, thanks to its large young population and multicultural feel. Trendy bars are scattered throughout the city and cater for all tastes, with many located on pedestrianized streets or along the coast, with sea views; while daily happenings and events take place throughout the city everyday.

Thessaloniki is also known for its picturesque uninterrupted promenade/waterfront, spanning for about 4.5 km from the old port to the Thessaloniki Concert Hall. From the White Tower, the waterfront gets considerably bigger (called ''Nea Paralia'') and along with the seaside walk, features 13 thematic gardens. During summer it is full of Thessalonians enjoying their long evening walks (referred to as "the volta" and is embedded into the culture of the city). There you will find people selling all kinds of food, bike riding, skating, fishing and a generally lively atmosphere with font the Thermaic Gulf and the port. 

There is a free walking city tour at 18.30 starting in front of the rotunda. You will get detailed yet short explanations about the history, myths, architecture and lifestyle of the city as well as a few recommendations about hidden but noteworthy shops - and maybe a free cookie.

===Yachting===
The Thermaic Gulf is a challenging place for yachting and sailing. Many days there are strong North winds but with low waves, making sailing a fun and joy for all sailors. There are three sailing clubs in Thessaloniki and world championships take place in the city every year. Thessaloniki has several marinas, most notably in Kalamaria, southeast of the city center, while a new one is proposed to be constructed right at the city center that will contain 182 mooring places. There are also many Yacht charter companies renting sailing yachts.

==Learn==
Thessaloniki is a major center of education for Greece. Two of the country's largest universities are located in central Thessaloniki: Aristotle University and the University of Macedonia. Aristotle University was founded in 1926 and is currently the largest university in Greece by number of students, which number at more than 80,000 in 2010, and is a member of the Utrecht Network.

Numerous public and private vocational institutes (IEK) provide professional training to young students, while a large number of private colleges offer American and UK academic curriculum, via cooperation with foreign universities. In addition to Greek students, the city hence attracts many foreign students either via the Erasmus programme for public universities, or for a complete degree in public universities or in the city's private colleges. As of 2006 the city's total student population was estimated around 200,000. Its young population and atmosphere provides for many learning opportunities, with classes and workshops on all interests being held all over the city.

===Clothing===
Thessaloniki is renowned for its major shopping streets and lively laneways. Tsimiski Street and Proxenou Koromila avenue are the city's most famous shopping streets and are among Greece's most expensive and exclusive high streets; there one can find various fashion shops of international brands, boutiques and high end international department stores. For cheaper clothing, check out Egnatia street.
  
===Books===
As Thessaloniki is considered the cultural capital of Greece, the city has also become a regular fixture for the book trade and booklovers. An International Book Fair [http://www.thessalonikibookfair.com/] is held annually in late spring at the waterfront, there people can find books from new authors and on all topics.

Some of the city's best book stores, and places were you can find maps in various languages include:
* '''Ianos bookshop''', Aristotelous Sq, (''city centre''). Books &amp; art-objects, cultural events. 
* '''Papasotiriou''' bookstore
* '''Eleftheroudakis''' bookstore
* '''Traveler''' map store
* '''Maliaris-Pedia''' bookstore

==Eat==

Due to the fact that Thessaloniki remained under Ottoman rule for about 100 years more than southern Greece, it has retained a lot of its Eastern character, including its culinary tastes. Spices in particular play an important role in the cuisine of Thessaloniki, something which is not true to the same degree about Greece's southern regions.
Greeks consider Thessaloniki a gourmet city - but bear in mind that this refers to the excellent local specialities and cheap-and-cheerful ouzo taverns rather than to haute cuisine or a range of foreign restaurants. The latter are best avoided in Thessaloniki. 

===Sweets and pastries===
For any traveler to Thessaloniki, a Greek will usually mention how they expect you to bring back sweets from the city, as it is known for having some of the best in the country. Throughout Thessaloniki anyone can find a variety of places that sell: ''Tsoureki'', a plaited sweetened bread, deserts such as ''Baklava'' and ''Galaktoboureko''; and ''Bougatsa'', the most famous pastry of Thessaloniki, with cream (sweet) or cheese (savoury) filling, which was invented in the city and has spread around other parts of Greece and the Balkans as well.

Some shops, where you can find the best sweets and pasties the city has to offer, include "Nikiforou" on Venizelou street, "Terkenlis" famous for its ''Tsoureki'' and "Chatzis" famous for its ''Baklava'', but fame has not made it any better - it has become overpriced and not as good as in previous years.

* <eat name="Chatzis" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="">[http://chatzis.gr/] is famous for its collection of Greek Asia Minor sweets (politika glyka) originating from Istanbul.</eat>

* <eat name="Elenidis">[http://elenidis.gr/] is considered the expert in "trigona" (triangles made of sfoglia, filled with cream).</eat>

===Meats===
For a carnivore's treat, places that serve  ''Gyros'' and ''Souvlaki'' with pork and chicken, are scattered all around the city. This is the best calories per money option, since with less that 3 euros you get a meal that, although not that healthy, can keep you going for many hours. Some of the best souvlaki meals at very affordable prices can be found at a place called "Derlicatesen".

Local specialities include ''Soutzoukakia'', minced meat pellets that are either grilled (at the central market or rotisseries) and topped with chilli pepper flakes, or cooked in tomato and cumin sauce (Smyrna-style); and ''Patsas'', a tripe soup, best tried late at night (or early morning).
For seafood, in Thessaloniki you can find ''Gemista kalamarakia'' (Stuffed squids), ''Mydopilafo'' (rice with mussels) or ''Mydia saganaki'' (mussels in tomato sauce).

===Fast food and snacks===
* The traditional fast food of Thessaloniki includes sandwiches with ''Gyros'' (pork meat), ''Souvlaki'' or ''Soutzoukaki'', offered in many stores for a little over €2.

* <eat name="Goody's" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="" email="" fax="">is the Greek fast-food chain, actually preferred by Greeks over other fast food restaurants such as McDonalds. There you can find classic hamburgers, also Gyros, pasta, and salads.</eat>  

* '''Crepes''' can be found in many stores all around the city. The best can be found at Gounari street, near Navarinou square, that is popular with the city's student population. 

* During the winter you can try '''roasted chestnuts''' (''Kastana'' in Greek) that are sold from carts. 

* During the summer one can buy boiled or roasted '''corn''' on the cob that is sold from carts, which cost €1-2.

* You can try '''Stafidopsomo''', a small bread with raisins, or '''Koulouri''' a donut-shaped small bread with sesame. You can find them sold in bakeries or on carts, costing around €0.5.

* For breakfast '''Bougatsa''', can be found in nearly every pastry shop around the city and can be accompanied with a cacao milk or coffee. Prices range from €1.8 - €2.3, for a plate of ''Bougatsa''.

==Contact==
There are many internet-cafes scattered throughout Thessaloniki, while a visit to most restaurants, bars and cafes in the city offer free wireless internet (WiFi).

==Stay safe==
Thessaloniki is regarded as a very safe city with crime rate much lower than other european tourist hotspots like [[Paris]], [[London]] and [[Brussels]] and [[Athens]]. With some basic precautions a visitor will experience a hustle-free vacation in the city. 

The biggest problem that a tourist might face in the city are '''pickpockets and petty thiefs'''. Always be careful of your belongings in public areas and especially in the city's buses where most incidents happen. Don't put your wallet, your phone or cash in your back pocket and try to use electronic devices inside the buses as little as you can. Buses are completely safe at night with violent incidents being almost unheard of. While it's very rare '''taxi frauds''' may happen so always make sure the meter is on. While staying in the city also keep in mind that it's better '''not to leave valuables in your car that can be seen from the outside''' as there is a chance that they might be stolen. Sexual harassment against women is pretty rare in the city and visitors with a different skin colour, ethnic, religion or sexual orientation can feel perfectly safe; Thessaloniki is multi-cultural and tolerant place. It is better to avoid wearing Greek football club shirts (especially shirts of clubs based in Athens) altogether, as local football hooligans are not known to be tolerating in these instances. Also, local football club gear (Aris, PAOK, Iraklis) is not recommended, as wearing such gear in the wrong neighbourhood can attract unwanted attention.

While walking in the city at night is very safe there are some areas that require a little more attention than others:
*'''Rotunda, Galerius Arch and Navarino Square''' - These places are located very close to each other and are tourist hotspots all day long. However at night, it's better to exercise a bit more caution here, especially in dimly-lit and deserted areas as there is a problem involving drug trafficking and drug addicts. This issue also, sometimes, extends to include the dark, secluded areas of the University Campus located just east of Rotunda. 
*'''Plateia Dikastirion and the Roman Agora''' - Dikastirion Square (Plateia) and the archaelogical site of the Roman Agora (Forum) are located at the northern ending of the Aristotelous Avenue. While in the day it's perfectly safe, at night the square is dimly-lit making it a good spot for drug-related or other crimes. Many women have also reported feeling unsafe around the square and the Roman Agora at night. 
*'''Dendropotamos, Sfageia, Vardaris and Giannitson Street''' - These areas adjacent to each other cover a sizeable part of the city (which includes the main bus and train station) west from the center and south from the areas of Ampelokipi, Menemeni and Evosmos. While during the day they are mostly safe, they are full of abandonded shops, buildings and especially factories, while Giannitson Street is also a hotspot for drug trafficking and prostitution. It's better to steer clear of the area at night as it becomes deserted and it's full of dimly lit streets. While you will probably be safe, exercise caution after dark in the section of Egnatia Avenue that passes through these areas and '''don't''' enter abandoned factories or the old train station.

==Stay healthy==
Tap water is safe and that's what people of the city drink, but in some places in the city center you might get a slight "taste" from the water, due to old pipelines in the buildings. For peace of mind, you might want to buy bottled water. Greece is also a sunny place and if your skin is light-colored, intense sunlight can be a serious danger. Use sunscreen, a hat and sunglasses.

==Cope==

==Get out==
Thessaloniki's proximity to places such as the national parks of Pieria and beaches of [[Chalkidiki]] often allow its residents and visitors to the city to easily have access to some of the best outdoor recreation in Europe. Some classic trips out of Thessaloniki include:

'''Within Greece'''
* Any visit to the 500 km of wonderful '''beaches, on the two first fingers of [[Chalkidiki]] peninsula''', where many Thessalonians (and tourists) spend their holidays there (The third finger is the monastic community of [[Mount Athos]]). In the summer, the Armenistis campground on the [[Sithonia]] peninsula stages concerts and other events. You can also check out the jazz and classical concerts that take place during summer at Sani ([[Kassandra]] peninsula). Try to schedule your visit during summer so that you're not driving back to the city on Sunday evening, when you will always find heavy traffic from people returning back into the city.   

* '''Mount Olympus coast''', towards [[Platamonas]], a very scenic region which has fallen out of favour with the trendy set but has lost no business - it is now mainly catering to tourists from Eastern Europe.

* '''[[Olympos National Park]]''' includes Mount Olympus with a chain of nice mounts to hike and several valleys. 4 refuges available to sleep, several peaks from 2500 to 3100 meters to climb.

* '''[[Pella|Pella]]''', birthplace of Alexander the Great and the ancient Macedonian capital, during the time of Alexander the Great. 

* '''Vergina''', the spectacular site of the Macedonian royal tombs and first capital of ancient Macedon.

* '''Dion''', a beautiful archaeological site near Mount Olympus.
 
* '''Olynthus''', an archaeological site in Chalcidice. 

* '''[[Prespa|Prespa and Doirani lakes]]''' near the borders with Albania and Macedonia. The national parks there offer an austere and evocative Balkan landscape and plenty of bird watching.
