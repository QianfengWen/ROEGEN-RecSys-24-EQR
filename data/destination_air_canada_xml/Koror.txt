'''Koror''', population 10,000, is the largest city in [[Palau]]. Koror was also the capital until 2006, but the hamlet of [[Melekeok]], some 20 km away, now has that honor.

==Understand==

Palau has experienced a major surge in Mainland Chinese tourists lately (since late 2014), with Chinese tourists now comprising approximately half of all tourist arrivals. Correspondingly, Chinese-owned (or Chinese-targeted) shops, restaurants, and other businesses have recently sprung up all over downtown Koror.

==Get in==

The airport is located on Babeldaob Island next door, and visitors will cross over to Koror via the Japan-Palau Friendship Bridge [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koror%E2%80%93Babeldaob_Bridge], usually in a rental car or shuttle bus. Some Koror-based rental car companies will pick you up directly from the airport. When returning, please note that taxis will charge an additional fee for late night service. Most hotels offer airport pick-up and delivery at US$10 per way, as long as prior arrangement is made.

==Get around==

There are three primary methods of getting around Koror: Rental cars, taxis, and the BBI shuttle. Walking may be an option for some, but most of the large resorts are located well outside the main shopping/dining area of Koror.

There are car rental terminals at the airport, as well as rental desks at some of the large resorts. Palauans drive on the right side of the road, though many of the cars are imported from Japan and have steering wheels on the right. Traffic tends to move very slowly throughout Koror, as the speed limits are low and speed bumps are sprinkled liberally throughout the city. Although the traffic flow varies throughout the day, the volume is light enough that there are no traffic signals in Koror.

Koror has a sufficient number of taxis, though they can be difficult to find if you are out walking around. It's usually easiest to ask the hotel concierge or even your waiter/waitress to call one for you. The taxis here are not metered, but rather have a fixed rate sheet based on your starting and ending points. A taxi ride from the far-flung Palau Pacific Resort into the heart of Koror costs $6-8, depending on exactly where you're getting dropped off.

In the evenings the BBI shuttle service is also an option. It operates roughly between 5-10pm, with two shuttles plying the same route in opposite directions. The shuttles stop at the two major resorts, Palau Pacific Resort and Palau Royal Resort, and cover the entire stretch of the main street through downtown Koror. Shuttle tickets cost $7 per person and are good for a week. The shuttles follow a timeline and schedules are easily obtained when you purchase your ticket. The larger resorts sell tickets right at the hotel.

*'''Palau Pacific Resort''' [http://www.palauppr.com/] is a world class resort on the outskirts of Koror. Known locally as PPR, it is very nice (beautiful beach, excellent restaurant, vaulted ceilings) but it is also quite a ways out of Koror (10-15 minute drive). They do run an hourly shuttle into Koror most evenings, or it will set you back about $7 each way for a cab.
*'''Swimming with Jellyfish''' in the Rock Islands was previously available as a day tour from Koror. Due to pollution and storms, the majority of the jellyfish in this fragile microecosystem have died as of 2018. The lake is now closed.

==Buy==
===Palauan Storyboards===
[[Image:Jail_gift_shop.jpg|thumb|240px|A sign points visitors to the jail gift shop]]
[[Image:Storyboard.jpg|thumb|240px|An example of a storyboard]]
There are a number of stores in Koror to purchase traditional '''Palauan storyboards''', but the most popular location is '''the jail''', which sells storyboards made (voluntarily) by the prisoners. The proceeds go to the prisoners' families to help support them while they are in jail. The jail has by far the largest selection of story boards in Koror, but can also be the most expensive place to purchase them. Helpfully, the jail puts a color coded sticker on each storyboard and offers visitors laminated sheets describing the story associated with each color. The jail is in the center of Koror, set back off the main street on the east side. The jail accepts cash only, and bargaining is accepted.

Another non-traditional location that has a vast selection of storyboards is The Rock Island Cafe. They are displayed around the restaurant, simply ask at the counter for pricing and selection. Some of the larger resorts have a small selection of storyboards in their gift shops. Locals can also point you to some out-of-the-way storyboard shops that you'd never find on your own. These hidden shops tend to have the lowest prices, but also usually have a small selection.

A small storyboard at an inexpensive store will start around $100. The largest storyboards at the jail, which may be several feet across and elaborately carved into the shape of an animal, can run several thousand dollars. Many of the places that sell storyboards can assist you with shipping them back home. Major shipping companies and even the USPS all service Palau.

===General Shopping===
There are lots of “mom-and-pop” shops and markets located along Main Street in downtown Koror. There are a few larger American-style grocery stores in Koror that import from the U.S. – Surangel’s, WCTC (West Carolina Trading Co.), and PayLess. WCTC has a grocery, personal care shop, a Ben Franklin store, a couple of sports shops and a furniture store.   

Surangel’s also has a supercenter that opened in September 2022 just outside Koror on the island of Babeldaob and WCTC is currently building their supercenter by the capital on the center east coast of Babeldaob. These have/will have everything from a typical American large grocery, large and small appliances, housewares, hardware, plumbing, garden shop, clothing shops, hair salon, food court (still developing), car rental and Toyota dealership, etc. There are a few hardware shops, including a True Value and an Ace.

===Money===
Palau uses the US Dollar as its official currency, and credit cards are accepted at most, though not all, shops and restaurants. The Bank of Guam and the Bank of Hawaii both have an ATM on Main Street in central Koror. As of early 2014 there are no surcharges for using these ATMs, though they do limit you to a maximum withdrawal of $300 per day.

==Eat==

Places to go for Palauan food in Koror:

* '''Yano's Market'''. Try the Beef steamed in Titiml leaves (a local plant that is often confused with Basil), Clams cooked in Coconut, local Kangkun vegetables stir fried with onions and garlic. 

* '''Penthouse'''. Try the fruitbat cooked in coconut if you are adventurous. Otherwise, the creamy taro leaf soup with coconut, local fish soup (which you can also have for breakfast with fried garlic rice), mangrove crabs in spicy cause, grilled prawns and baked lobster with garlic butter are all must tries. This restaurant also has an excellent inhouse bakery.

''International'' Faire:
* '''Bottom Time Bar & Grill''' is off the beaten path and located inside Sam's dive center. It is a very casual place with typical pub fare and views of the water. Given its location at the dive center, it gets crowded and loud in the late afternoon when the dive boats return.
* '''Rock Island Cafe''', located on the south end of the main strip in Koror (past the court house) is an excellent ''home town cafe''-style eatery. Their portions are large and their prices are reasonable (the bread sticks are a personal favorite). Do note that the Rock Island Cafe is run by Seventh-Day Adventist, so it is closed Friday 6pm to Saturday 6pm.
* '''Taj''', found in the center of the main strip, right across from the jail, is a popular Indian eatery. The menu options and prices trend upscale, but the atmosphere is laid back, including outdoor patio seating, and many diners come dressed in very casual attire befitting Koror's tropical climate.
