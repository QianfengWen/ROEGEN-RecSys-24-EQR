'''Charlottetown''' is the capital city of [[Prince Edward Island]], one of the [[Atlantic Provinces]] of [[Canada]].

==Understand==
Charlottetown is a great place to spend a few days. It's a quaint and pretty town, small enough to be able to walk around, and has lots of good restaurants and bars. It's also within easy reach of the PEI National Park.

==Get in==

===By plane===
The '''Charlottetown Airport''' ({{IATA|YYG}}), 250 Maple Hills Ave, [http://www.flypei.com/] has nonstop flights to Toronto, Montreal, Halifax, Ottawa, and New York (JFK).
*'''Air Canada/Air Canada Jazz''' ([[Halifax (Nova Scotia)|Halifax]], [[Montreal]], [[Ottawa]], [[Toronto]])
*'''Westjet''' ([[Toronto]])
*'''Sunwing Vacations''' ([[Toronto]])
*'''Delta Air Lines''' ([[New York]])
*'''Swoop Air Lines''' ([[Hamilton]])
*'''Flair Air Lines''' ([[Toronto or Breslau]])

Charlottetown Airport is one of the most user-friendly airports.  Clearly, some of this is due to infrequent flights and small aircraft. Check-ins usually take five minutes or less. The airport is small, accessible, and friendly -- just like the city itself!

==Get around==
Taxis are cheap. $16 gets you from the Airport to downtown (some drivers charge $1.50 extra to use your card). 6-10$ will get you anywhere around town. All taxis are flat rate by zone. None has any specific licensing information in them; not to worry though, taxi drivers are typically friendly, enjoy meeting tourists, and are honest above all else. Charlottetown is a small highly accessible city, you can walk almost anywhere downtown.

==Buy==
Charlottetown contains two major shopping centres: the Confederation Court Mall (right downtown, across from Province House), and the Royalty Crossing Mall, which is just out of town in West Royalty, on University Avenue. They contain the usual anchor stores (Winners, SportChek, etc), as well as many smaller stores. West Royalty also has many stand-alone big-box stores, such as Wal-Mart, Canadian Tire, Best Buy, etc.

If you get off the beaten path, though, you'll find lots of great specialty shops just waiting for your business.  Walks along Queen St. and University Ave. (among others) will yield wonderful surprises in terms of shopping selection.

Groceries are readily available from many major supermarkets within Charlottetown.  Typical closing time is 10:00PM.  Since 2011, the government has allowed Sunday shopping year round, which will be in place until further notice. Sunday store hours are generally noon to 5:00PM.

==Sleep==
There is no reason to stay at a chain hotel or motel in Charlottetown. The city is dotted with some of the cutest, and most comfortable, Inns and B&Bs you can imagine.
