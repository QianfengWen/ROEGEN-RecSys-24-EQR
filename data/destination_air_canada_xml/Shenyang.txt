'''Shenyang''' (沈阳 ''Shěnyáng''), historically '''Mukden''', is the capital of [[Liaoning Province]] in [[China]].

==Understand==
Capital of Liaoning Province and the largest city in the northeast of China, Shenyang is a city steeped in history. Nu'erhachi built his imperial palace and was laid to rest in one of the first two imperial tombs of the Qing Dynasty, Fuling Tomb. His son is buried in Zhaoling Tomb, which is the second of the first two imperial tombs. The imperial palace and the two tombs are all listed by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites. It was in Shenyang that the Russian army was defeated by the Japanese in 1905. It was also here, on September 18th, 1931 that the Fengtian incident ignited a war between China and Japan that would see the Japanese occupation of all of Northeast China. This city was also the home to the warlord Zhang Zuolin and his son Zhang Xueliang who ruled over the Northeast during the 1920's. The 20th century saw Shenyang develop as a major industrial centre. Today the city is rapidly losing its older structures with large scale construction throughout the city, like all cities in China.

Shenyang has a monsoon-influenced continental climate with large seasonal variation. Winters are very cold, but dry, and can easily feature nights of −20 °C or below. Summers are hot and humid, with daytime temperatures near 30 °C, rarely pushing above into the high 30s °C, though.

==Districts==
Shenyang consists of the following districts:
*'''Heping''' (和平区; ''Hépíngqū'')
*'''Dadong''' (大东区; ''Dàdōngqū'')
*'''Huanggu''' (皇姑区; ''Huánggūqū'')
*'''Shenhe''' (沈河区; ''Shěnhéqū'')
*'''Tiexi'''（铁西区；''tie3xi1qu1'')
*'''Hunnan'''(浑南新区；''hun2nan2xin1qu1'')
*'''Yuhong''' (于洪区；''yu2hong2qu1'')

==Get in==

===By plane===
The city is served by the '''Shenyang Taoxian International Airport''' (沈阳桃仙国际机场; ''Shěnyángtáoxiān Guójìjīchǎng''; airport code SHE), as well as by several smaller, regional airports. Direct flights to Shenyang from [[Beijing]], [[Changsha]], [[Chaoyang]], [[Chengdu]], [[Chongqing]], [[Dalian]], [[Fuzhou]], [[Guangzhou]], [[Haikou]], [[Hangzhou]], [[Harbin]], [[Hefei]],  [[Jinan]], [[Kunming]], [[Lanzhou]], [[Nanjing]], [[Ningbo]], [[Qingdao]], [[Qiqihar]], [[Sanya]], [[Shanghai]], [[Shantou]], [[Shenzhen]], [[Shijiazhuang]], [[Taiyuan]], [[Tianjin]], [[Ürümqi]], [[Wenzhou]], [[Wuhan]], [[Xiamen]], [[Xian]], [[Xuzhou]], [[Yanji]], [[Yantai]], [[Zahuang]], [[Zhengzhou]], and [[Zhuhai]].

Direct international flights from [[Hong Kong]], [[Taipei]], [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]]; [[Pyongyang]], [[North Korea]], [[Osaka]] and [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]], [[Los Angeles]], [[USA]], [[Vancouver]], [[Canada]], [[Hanoi]] & [[Nha Trang]], [[Vietnam]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]], [[Sihanoukville]], [[Cambodia]], with connections to [[Australia]], [[USA]], [[UK]] and other countries. The airport is located 30 km south of the city. An airport shuttle runs from the airport to the main China Northern Airlines ticket office (117 Zhonghua Road; 中华路117号; Zhōnghuálù) and back frequently.

===By car===
Shenyang is connected by a major expressway, the 6-lane Jingshen Expressway, from Beijing, some 685 km (425 mi) away. Expressways also link Shenyang with [[Jilin]] and [[Heilongjiang]] provinces. The Shenda Expressway connecting Shenyang and Dalian was the first expressway ever built in China (383 km /238 mi). It is the fastest highway (8-lane) linking one of the largest port cities to Shenyang.

===By train===
Train service is provided through two train stations, the north train station and the south train station (Also known as Shenyang railway station). The north train station handles the majority of the long-distance trains while the south train station handles high speed trains from Beijing, most of the northeast trains and does local service around the province. Some trains travel to both stations so be aware of which station you need to board your train. Both stations are on the subway but on different lines so changing between them will take 20-30minutes, or there is a special ¥1 bus that runs back and forth west to east.  Look for it at the bus stop closest to the train station gates.  It is marked with a banner on the side (in Chinese) that says something like Shenyang Train Station East-West.  If you can understand those Chinese characters, you should be able to catch this frequent bus.

'''North Train Station''' (沈阳北站; ''Shěnyáng Běizhàn'') at Beizhan Road (北站路; ''Běizhànlù''), Line 2

Long distance bus service is handled by two bus stations.

'''Main Long-Distance Bus Station''' (Shenyang Qiche Kuaisu Keyun Zhan)
Located on Huigong Jie, this station serves routes to and from major cities. You can also find night buses to Beijing being hawked outside the north train station.

* '''Beijing''' - takes about 8 hours 
* '''Changchun''' - takes about 4 hours
* '''Dandong''' - takes about 3 hours
* '''Dalian''' - takes about 4 hours 
* '''Harbin''' - takes about 7 hours
* '''Jilin''' - takes about 5 hours
* '''Jinzhou''' - takes about 3 hours

'''South Bus Station'''
Buses queue along Minzhu Lu (opposite the south train station), around Minzhu Square and some nearby streets. On most buses you pay the conductor on the bus but for Anshan and Liaoyang you must purchase tickets at the office on the east side of Minzhu Square. These buses run medium distance routes to neighbouring cities within Liaoning. Buses stop departing this bus stations around 6pm. Passengers arriving to this station may be offloaded from the bus on a nearby street or some distance away at a yard used for storing coaches, sited behind the post office on Zhongshan Jie.

* '''Anshan''' - takes about 1 hour 40 minutes
* '''Benxi''' - takes about 1 hour
* '''Liaoyang''' - takes 1 hour
* '''Fushun''' - takes 50 minutes

==Get around==
Sights in the old city, Shenhe District, can be walked between, but other areas such as those in Beiling or Dongling require transport.

The first line of the Shenyang Metro runs east-west across the city and serves the train station.  The second line runs north-south.

Shenyang has a comprehensive bus system, but it can be incomprehensible if you do not read Chinese. Make sure you pick up a city bus and area map at either train station. Very handy to help get around. Buses charge &yen;1-2 and major bus lines congregate around the train stations. Bus 203 travels between the two train stations.

There are plenty of taxis whose meters start at &yen;8 for 3 kilometers, then &yen;1.8 per kilometer. Make sure you get a taxi in which the meter is mounted on the dashboard and easily visible from your seat instead of behind the gear shift - it is possible the driver may be pulling some sleight of hand to increase your fare. As with any Chinese city you will find a shortage of taxis in rainy weather, and much use of shared taxis to get around.

The splendid and distinctly ethnic Manchu architectural style of the palace, which includes Dazheng (Grand Politics) Hall, the Ten Princes' Pavillion, Chongzhen (Golden Chimes), Phoenix Chamber and Qingning (Pure Tranquility) Pavillion, are still in perfect shape. On Saturday afternoons during the summer, the palace is the venue for a grand Imperial procession. This is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site alongside the palace in Beijing. It is also an AAAA rated tourist site on the Chinese national scale. A guidebook is available in English at the ticket office, priced &yen;25, which provides a detailed explanation of the exhibits.

This fascinating palace contains finer details compared to the one in Beijing, such as the exquisitely handcrafted detailed carving and painting, which are still clear after four centuries. The throne room in Chongzheng Hall has incredibly detailed scrollwork -even the columns circled by the watchful dragons and on the throne. The palace also shows a significant influence from the nomadic heritage of its builders in the cold Manchuria.

Though instigated by the Japanese, the Chinese were blamed for the event giving the Japanese an excuse to invade and occupy the whole of the northeast of China.  Shenyang was the epicenter of that invasion, so it is most appropriate that the museum for the '9.18 Incident', as it is known, is in Shenyang next to the spot where the explosion occurred.  The museum, as one would expect, depicts the incident from a Chinese perspective.  It is not for the faint of heart because it unflinchingly displays the atrocities of war. Only the main descriptions are available in English, but it's enough to follow the course of events. The pictures and exhibits speak for themselves, anyway.</see>

Liaoning is home to Liaocai (辽菜), a distinctive cuisine named after the area. Liaocai tends to be strong in flavour with plenty garlic, ginger and other spices but not hot. Shenyang has a large Korean and Mongolian population, who operate a lot of barbecue stands on the street corners of the city. There are also a number of very good Korean restaurants here. All of Shenyang's top hotels feature fancy restaurants serving Cantonese, Japanese and Western food. There are also some decent noodle shops, as well as the national chain California Beef Noodle, on some of the small roads near the train station. 

Fast food and coffee shops are plentiful. The imported, western style food tends to be at the higher end of the price market. By going after local cuisine you will save money.
