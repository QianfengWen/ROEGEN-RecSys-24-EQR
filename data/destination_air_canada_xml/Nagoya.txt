: ''For the city in Batam, Indonesia, see [[Nagoya (Indonesia)]].''

[http://www.city.nagoya.jp/global/en/ '''Nagoya'''] (名古屋) is the capital and largest city of [[Aichi]] prefecture, in the [[Chubu]] region of [[Honshu]].

==Understand==
The hub of the Aichi region, Nagoya is Japan's fourth-largest city after [[Tokyo]], [[Yokohama]], and [[Osaka]], and is one of the nation's major economic centers. In terms of manufacturing, it is home to automotive manufacturing giants Toyota, Honda, and Mitsubishi Motors.
In this region, the historical center of samurai and ninja culture has evolved, and now it is the center of the automobile and aircraft manufacturing industry in Japan. Toyota Group has been especially prominent in developing the car and heavy industry of the city, and Mitsubishi - which once produced the Zero fighter aircraft during WWII - is now producing a Japanese-designed passenger jet, the MRJ, in this area.
Many parts for Boeing airliners are also produced in this area. The Boeing 787 and 777 aircraft wings, and various other components are manufactured in Aichi Prefecture. These components are transported to the United States from Centrair International Airport in dedicated cargo planes.
If you do decide to stick around, there are plenty of car-related attractions, a restored castle, an ancient shrine, and a surprisingly vibrant nightlife.

===History===
Now a modern metropolis, Nagoya gets its name from an old manor called ''Nagono'' which was built in the area in the 12th century. The manor prospered for two hundred years, and people began to refer to the area by the manor's name. Over time, the pronunciation of the Chinese characters in the name "Nagono" shifted to "Nagoya", by which the city is now known.

Three famous local figures later helped to put Nagoya firmly on the map of Japan. Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu  all hailed from around Nagoya, and all shared the ambitious goal of unifying Japan under one government. Tokugawa finally succeeded in 1603 after winning in the Battle of Sekigahara, and established the Tokugawa Shogunate, which would rule Japan for another 250 years.

Soon after uniting the country, Tokugawa Ieyasu ordered the construction of Nagoya Castle for his son. He then ordered the people of nearby Kiyosu (on the outskirts of Nagoya) to move to the area around the castle, and a town soon came into being. Cotton, ceramics and timber were the main industries as the town as it grew into a small city.

Following Japan's opening to the world during the Meiji era, Nagoya rapidly industrialized and established transportation links with the rest of Japan that would allow it to easily export its goods. During World War I, Nagoya became known for its foundries as well as its machinery and heavy industry exports, which would continue to grow throughout the 1930's.

The 1920's marked the beginnings of the automotive industry in Nagoya, which continues in importance to the current day. At the heart of the industry is the Toyota Motor Corporation. Starting from humble beginnings as a loom-making company, Toyota entered into the automobile business in the 1930s. It is now the world's largest automaker, and continues to dominate the local economy along with the car-making giants Honda and Mitsubishi.

During World War II, much of Nagoya's manufacturing infrastructure turned to the production of military goods, making it a prime target for bombing raids. Almost 25% of the city was destroyed during the war, with almost half the population fleeing to the countryside to avoid the attacks.

The end of the war marked a new start for Nagoya. Car-friendly wide streets and boulevards were bulldozed through the rubble of war, making for the city of today. 

Nagoya now ranks as one of the nation's economic powerhouses, and is home to the head offices of Toyota Motor Corporation, Brother Industries, Daido Steel, Makita, Denso Corporation, INAX, Suzuki Motor, Honda Motor, Noritake, NGK Insulators, Olympus Optical, Yamaha and many others. Unlike other parts of Japan, which borrowed heavily for elaborate and expensive public works projects in the bubble years of the 1980's, ''ketchi'' (cheap) Nagoya held to a pay-as-you-go philosophy, and has not been as adversely affected by the post-bubble recession as other major centres.

The booming economy has also brought many foreigners to the area, and the region now hosts a thriving community of Japanese-descent Brazilian immigrants, who help to keep the wheels of the local economy spinning. With its strong economy and growing population, Nagoya is a city to watch in the coming years.

===Climate===
Nagoya's climate varies greatly throughout the year, with average temperatures ranging from a low of 4&deg;C (39.2&deg;F) in January to a high of 35&deg;C (95&deg;F) in August. The city is known for its incredibly hot and humid summers like many cities in Japan, with high temperatures routinely above 30&deg;C (86&deg;F)in August, so those with an aversion to heat would be better off visiting in the milder temperatures of the spring or autumn.

===Orientation===
While divided into 16 different wards or ''ku'' (区), the focal points of this sprawling agglomeration are '''Nagoya Station''' (名古屋駅) to the north, '''Sakae''' (栄) to the east and '''Kanayama''' (金山) to the south.

==Get in==

===By plane===
{{infobox|Not arriving via Centrair Airport?|*If you happen to arrive in Japan at Osaka's [[Kansai International Airport]], Nagoya can be reached in no less than two hours by taking the ''Haruka'' limited express train to Shin-Osaka station, then changing to the Tokaido Shinkansen.
*A small number of air flights operate daily from Tokyo's [[Narita Airport]] to Centrair Airport, for the benefit of international passengers. Otherwise, Nagoya is no less than three hours away by taking the ''Narita Express'' limited express train to Tokyo's Shinagawa station, then changing to the Tokaido Shinkansen. }}

'''[[Chubu Centrair International Airport]]''' (中部国際空港 ''Chūbu Kokusai Kūkō''), [[Japan]]'s third major international gateway, is on an artificial island 30 minutes south from the center of town.  Facilities include two hotels, restaurants, a shopping concourse, and an ''onsen'' spa with views of the runways.  Centrair opened in 2005, and this airport replaces the existing Nagoya airport, also taking over its '''IATA''' code '''NGO'''.

The best way of connecting between Centrair Airport and central Nagoya is the '''Meitetsu Airport Line'''. The fastest trains are called "μSKY" (''myuu-sukai'') and depart for Nagoya every 30 minutes. The journey takes 28 minutes at a cost of &yen;1200: the &yen;850 regular fare plus the mandatory &yen;350 first class charge, also called the μticket (ミューチケット　''myuu-chiketto''). Only first class cars are available on "μSKY" trains. Slower Limited Express trains, also operating every 30 minutes, offer both first class (reserved) and ordinary class (non-reserved) seating and take 37 minutes for the run to Nagoya. 

Note that Meitetsu trains are ''not'' free for JR Railpass riders.

====Nagoya Airport====
While all other companies have moved to Chubu, regional flights by J-Air [http://www.jair.co.jp/] still use the old Nagoya Airport [http://www.nagoya-airport-bldg.co.jp/] ({{IATA|NKM}}), also known as '''Komaki Airport''', to the north of the city. Flights are available to a number of domestic destinations including [[Akita]], [[Yamagata]], [[Niigata]], [[Kochi (Shikoku)|Kochi]], [[Matsuyama]], [[Fukuoka]], [[Kumamoto]], and [[Nagasaki]]. Shuttle buses [http://www.aoi-komaki.co.jp/html/airport-bus/airport.html] (¥700) connect to Nagoya station in 28 minutes.

===By train===
[[Image:279301783 61cf5fdb6f b.jpg|thumb|275px|right|Nagoya Train Station]]
Nagoya is located along the Tokaido Shinkansen route between [[Tokyo]] and [[Osaka]]. To the west are [[Gifu]] and [[Kyoto]], and to the east are [[Hamamatsu]] and [[Shizuoka]].

*A one-way ride from Tokyo is about 1 hour, 40 minutes via ''Nozomi'' (¥10780) and between 1 3/4 and 2 hours via ''Hikari'' (¥10580). 

*From [[Kyoto]], Nagoya is reachable in 36 minutes via ''Nozomi'' (¥5640) and between 36 and 55 minutes via ''Hikari'' or ''Kodama'' (¥5440).

*From the Shin-Osaka station in Osaka, Nagoya is 53 minutes away via ''Nozomi'' (¥6380) and between 53 and 70 minutes away via ''Hikari'' or ''Kodama'' (¥6180).

Thru ''Nozomi'' trains from western Japan reach Nagoya from [[Okayama]] (1 hr 40 mins, ¥10980), [[Hiroshima]] (2 hrs 20 mins, ¥13830) and Hakata station in [[Fukuoka]] (3 hrs 20 mins, ¥18030). It is slightly longer via the ''Hikari'' service; you will need to change trains at least once, either at Okayama, Shin-Kobe, or Shin-Osaka.

If you wish to sacrifice travel speed for savings, you can take advantage of the '''Puratto Kodama Ticket''' (ぷらっとこだまエコノミープラン ''Puratto Kodama Economi Puran'') [http://www.jrtours.co.jp/kodama/] (in Japanese), which offers a discount for Kodama services if you purchase at least one day in advance. You get a reserved seat and a complimentary drink on board. A ticket to Nagoya costs ¥8100 from Tokyo (3 hours; 2 trains per hour), ¥4100 from Kyoto (1 hour; 1 train per hour) and ¥4200 from Shin-Osaka (1 1/4 hours; 1 train per hour). A few early-morning Kodama trains cannot be used with this ticket.

Nagoya also serves as the terminal point for the hourly ''Wide View Shinano'', a limited express train that runs from the mountain resort towns of [[Nagano]] and [[Matsumoto]]. Nagoya is reached in 3 hours and 2 hours, respectively.

Local trains from Tokyo take about 6 hours at a cost of ¥6090, requiring several train changes along the way. However, trips on local trains are more valuable if you purchase and use a [[Seishun_18_Ticket|Seishun 18 Ticket]] during the valid time period: as low as '''&yen;2300 per person''' if five people travel together. Otherwise, consider using a bus starting from ¥5000, or step up to the bullet train for ¥7900 using the Puratto Kodama Ticket. 

Remember that the Japan Rail Pass covers all journeys described above, '''EXCEPT for Nozomi trains'''.

Nagoya is also served by the '''Meitetsu''' (名鉄）[http://www.meitetsu.co.jp/english/] and '''Kintetsu''' (近鉄）[http://www.kintetsu.jp/english/trans/index.html] private railways. If coming to Nagoya from [[Osaka]], a travel option that comes cheaper than the Shinkansen is a Kintetsu limited express service called the ''Urban Liner'' (アーバンライナー), which runs out of Namba station. The Urban Liner departs at 0 and 30 minutes past the hour, covering the journey in as little as two hours, but at a cost of ¥4150 each way. (The shinkansen, by comparison, makes the run from Shin-Osaka to Nagoya in under an hour for ¥5670). Japan Rail Passes are not valid for the Urban Liner.

===By bus===
As Nagoya is a major city, there are many day and overnight buses which run between Nagoya and other locations throughout Japan, which can be a cheaper alternative than the shinkansen or local trains.

From Tokyo, bus runs to Nagoya are frequent, using either the Tomei Expressway along the southern coast or the Chuo Expressway through the central part of the country. Trips take approximately 6-9 hours depending on the route and stops.

The following are among the major bus services available between Tokyo and Nagoya: ''(Current as of March, 2012)''

====Willer Express====

Discount bus operator '''Willer Express''' [http://travel.willer.co.jp/en/] runs daytime and overnight buses with a variety of seating options. Bus journeys can be booked online in English, and Willer's '''Japan Bus Pass''' is valid on all of their routes with some exceptions.

Buses from Tokyo leave from Willer's own bus terminal, located west of Shinjuku Station in the Sumitomo Building. Some buses also leave directly from Shinjuku Station's West exit, '''Tokyo Station''' - Yaesu-Chuo Exit, '''Tokyo Disneyland''' - Goofy Car Park, '''Hamamatsucho Station''' and '''Yokohama Station'''. Buses discharge in Nagoya at the Taiko exit in front of the BIC Camera store.

Willer's overnight one-way fares to/from Tokyo start from approximately &yen;3000 for overnight trips in standard seats up to &yen;5300 in canopy seats with advanced purchase. Daytime bus fares start from &yen;3000. Fares are typically higher on weekends and holidays.

====JR Bus====

'''JR Bus''' [http://www.kakuyasubus.jp/kanto_kansai/index.html (Japanese Website)] is also a major operator on the Tokyo-Nagoya route. The drawback is that you cannot make online reservations in English, but you can make reservations in train stations at the same "Midori-no-Madoguchi" ticket windows used to reserve seats on trains.

JR Buses depart from '''Tokyo Station''' - Yaesu Exit (八重洲口) and the '''JR Highway Bus Terminal''' (JR高速バスターミナル) located adjacent to Yoyogi Station on the Yamanote Line (one stop south of Shinjuku).

JR Bus offers, in order of comfort and price, '''Seishun (youth) buses''' with 2x2 seating configurations and '''Standard buses''' with individual seats arranged 1x1x1. Some buses offer more spacious '''Super Seats''' and '''Premium Seats''' which incur an additional surcharge of ¥600 and ¥1200, respectively.

JR Bus' overnight one-way fares to/from Tokyo start from approximately &yen;2350 for overnight trips in Seishun buses up to &yen;3900 for standard buses with advanced purchase. Daytime bus fares start from &yen;2280. Fares are typically higher on weekends and holidays.

Note that the Japan Rail Pass CAN be used for overnight trips on standard buses between Tokyo and Nagoya called "Dream" services. If traveling during the daytime, buses on the JR Tomei Highway Bus service are covered, but you might as well use the bullet train.

For further details, check out ferry website [http://www.taiheiyo-ferry.co.jp/noriba/nagoya.html] (Japanese)

==Get around==

Nagoya is a big automotive industry center and it shows. The street network is extensive and even downtown locations can easily be reached by car. On the downside, trains and subways are less convenient than in Tokyo or Kansai, and more expensive. For those travelling with a JR Rail Pass, note that the train network doesn't have many stations in the city and you'll probably find yourself using the bus or subway a lot, something your pass won't cover.

===By subway===

There are 6 main subway lines:
*The red '''Sakuradōri Line''' (桜通線) curves southwest from Nagoya Station.  

*The purple '''Meijō Line''' (名城線) runs in a loop around the eastern side of the city, connecting Sakae and Kanayama; the '''Meikō Line''' (名港線) spur branches from Kanayama to Nagoya Port.  

*The yellow '''Higashiyama Line''' (東山線) connects Nagoya, Fushimi, Sakae and [[Fujigaoka]].  

*The blue '''Tsurumai Line''' (鶴舞線) connects Fushimi and Osu Kannon, then goes south to Akaike station. From there, it is possible to transfer to the Meitetsu Toyota line which leads to [[Toyota]]. 

*The pink '''Kamiiida Line''' (上飯田線) connects Heian-dōri and Kamiiida. From Kamiiida, it is possible to transfer to the Meitetsu Komaki line which leads to [[Inuyama]].

Subways run every several minutes between about 5:30AM until about 12:30AM. Fares range from ¥200 to ¥320. One day passes can be bought for ¥600 (bus), ¥740 (subway), and ¥850 (bus &amp; subway). 

On Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays you can also take advantage of the cheaper ''Donichi-Eco-Kippu'' (ドニチエコきっぷ） one-day subway ticket which offers unlimited subway travel for ¥600. Please note that this pass is often not available from subway ticket machines and may have to be purchased in person from a station employee at the ticket gate.

City transportation one day passes also offer discounted entry at various attractions in Nagoya, including Nagoya Castle and the Toyota Museum.

Wifi access is available in most subway stations. More information about public transportation in Nagoya can be found on the official website of the Nagoya Transportation Bureau [http://www.kotsu.city.nagoya.jp/english/index.html].

===By taxi===

Taxis are a viable option in this car city, especially as the '''basic fee is only ¥480''' (compared to ¥710 in Tokyo or Yokohama). The catch is that the basic fee only takes you 1.3km compared to 2km in most other parts of Japan. But for shorter distances within the city, a taxi is not only much more convenient than descending to those dark unappealing subway stations, but (from 2 persons) also as cheap as the subway.

Among the 165,000 square metres of temple grounds is the 15-metre Gandala-style Taian Pagoda, which houses '''relics of the Buddha''' that were presented to Japan by the king of Thailand.
This temple was built in 1904 at Nagoya, Achi, Japan by professor Chuta Itto of Tokyo University. In addition, Nittai-ji Temple is also a symbol of good companionship between Thailand and Japan. It combines the various denominations together in one place. Moreover, there are many interesting things in the temple. The first part is about its history. Nittai-ji Temple was built due to Thailand’s King Rama V because he gave the relics of the Buddha to Buddhists in Japan and this makes we was intimate between two country. Especially, the monasteries of Thailand. Since 1993 when the monasteries of Thailand went to Japan, they also visited the temple. For example, King Bhumipol Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit also went to Nittai-ji Temple in 1987 for celebrating 100 years of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Thailand and Japan. The second part is about the importance of Nittai-ji Temple. Chulalongkorn Day on October 23 of each year. Thai officers and the Japanese community will make an offering to the King Rama Monument V for memorial obligation. In addition, the embassy of Thailand in Tokyo consulate general in Osaka with honorary consulate of Nagoya was also the organizers for bowing to commemorate for 100 years of the death of King Rama V. Although, many people may not know this temple, it is very important for Thailand and Japan. From the above example of interesting parts of Nittai-ji Temple, those are just some parts of all.

Osu is the shopping area and Osu Kannon the temple just to the west side. In fact, the shopping area extends from Osu Kannon temple in the west to Bansho-ji　(万松寺) temple and Otsu-dori　street (大津通り）in the east. Outside of the main shopping arcade, there are also a number of streets with a wide array of different specialty shops.
**'''Akamon-dori''' (赤門通り）is known for the bright red banners hung along the street, and hosts a variety of stereo and electronics stores as well as  used record shops. On the 28th of every month, Daikou-in temple (大光院）hosts a small temple festival（縁日 ''ennichi'') on Akamon-dori with traditional street food stalls and lots of burning incense.   
**'''Otsu-dori''' (大津通り）marks the eastern boundary of the Osu shopping area. On the lively stretch of Otsu-dori north of Kamimaezu subway station you will find the Osu 301 Building (大須301). The building is known for its small dragon sculpture and Chinese theme, and contains a number of small shops. Continuing north on Otsu-dori, you will also find the small but funky Gatten-shouchi （合点承知） building, a mini-mall featuring fashion accessories, food stands and various fortune tellers.

There are also two '''Eiden''' electronics superstores located in Fushimi and near JR Ozone stn on the JR Chuo Line.

==Eat==
Nagoya is big on ''miso'', a sauce made from fermented soybeans and grain.  You should not leave the city without trying ''misokatsu'' (味噌カツ), fried pork cutlet with a rich, red miso sauce on it. 

The other Nagoya classic is shrimp ''tempura'', particularly when wrapped up in rice and dried seaweed and turned into a handy portable package known as a ''tenmusu'' (天むす).

The city is also known for ''uirō'' (外郎）, a confectionery made out of rice flour and sugar; a little firmer than gelatin but not as sticky as mochi.  Many different flavors are available, including red bean (小豆 ''azuki''） and green tea (抹茶 ''matcha''）.

Nagoya's noodle specialty is ''kishimen'' (きしめん), a flat, broad noodle often served in a miso or soy sauce broth. Available in most ''restaurant-gai'' in shopping centres or close to major railway stations.  

''Hitsumabushi'' （ひつまぶし）is an eel dish. ''Hitsumabushi'' is served with rice in a small box, and can be eaten three ways. First, just the eel and rice; second, with green onions and nori, and third, with tea or soup stock poured over it. 

===Budget===

* '''Café de Metro''', 1F Kanayama station (''North Exit''). Serves basic curry and ''donburi'' dishes, including a decent misokatsu, for ¥480 with coffee/tea, or ¥680 with miso soup and pickles.

* '''Jerry's UNO''', Located near Fureai Plaza in the Osu shopping district, to the giant ''manekineko'' statue's left (your right if you are facing the statue).  It's a nice little taco shop that will run you about 500 yen per taco.  They also have a nice selection of international beers.

==Drink==

Around Nagoya station, there are a lot of places for cheap drinking. Sakae is the big nightlife district, in a loose triangle formed by the Sakae, Yaba-cho and Osu Kannon stations. Sakae has a large red light district as well, but as with most of Japan, there's no sense of danger so don't worry about drifting around.  There are countless izakayas around Kanayama station, both cheap chains and more upscale places.

If the bar and club scene is not for you, try '''Nagoya Friends''' [http://nagoyafriendsparty.net/] and their monthly international parties and speed dating events.  Always a dynamic mix of foreigners and Japanese.  At the party it's all you can drink and eat (~¥3500 reserved ~¥4000 at the door).

===Nightclubs===

Nagoya has some good clubs. A lot of the DJs who play Tokyo also pass through Nagoya. Many of the most popular clubs are located in '''Sakae''' and '''Shin-sakae-machi''' (just east of Sakae and south of the Naka ward office). 

Be aware that even on week-ends, on less popular nights, clubs empty or even close early (around 2-3AM) in Nagoya. This is a sharp contrast to Tokyo, where most people come by train and have to stick around for good or for bad until the first train in the morning. In auto-city Toyota, however, many people come by car; they can and will go home early if they are bored.

Be also aware that some of the clubs operate a "no gaijin" (foreigners) policy. Yes its allowed in japan. Just find a more open minded place to dance the night away.

For information on upcoming club events, sign up for the weekly '''The Obvious Circus''' newsletter [mailto:theobviouscircus@gmail.com] by local DJ DJDij, or check out '''Seekjapan.jp''''s Nagoya live event listings [http://www.seekjapan.jp/].
