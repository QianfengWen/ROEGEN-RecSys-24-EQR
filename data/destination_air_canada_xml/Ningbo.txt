'''Ningbo''' (宁波 or 寧波; ''Níngbō'') is a city in [[Zhejiang|Zhejiang province]]. The name is also used for the 9,365 km² (3,615 mi²) territory which it administers, including an extensive suburban area, three satellite cities, and two rural counties.

[[Image:Ningbo_Bridge.png|thumb|Downtown Ningbo]]
Ningbo is among the busiest ports in the world. Its hinterland, particularly nearby Putuoshan, are popular tourist destinations in Eastern China.

Ningbo's "old town" and urban core is<!--sic--> centered on the confluence of the Yong<!--not Yongjiang--> and Yuyao Rivers. The area was anciently known as '''Yǒng''' (甬) from nearby Yong Hill; Yong is still used as Ningbo's abbreviation in modern Chinese. The Yong empties on Hangzhou Bay and the East China Sea and the Ningbonese have had a deep affinity for the ocean throughout their history. The voyages of Xu Fu, sent by the First Emperor in search of the islands of immortality and sometimes credited with initiating the sinicization of Japan, departed from here. Its temples later served as an important staging point in the introduction of Buddhism to Japan. During the Middle Ages, Ningbo was sometimes the sole approved port for foreign trade. During this period, Ningbo included ghettoes for Muslim and Jewish merchants. The Portuguese reached "'''Liampo'''" around 1522. They received permission for a settlement in 1542 but their piratical behavior provoked an officially-sanctioned massacre within three years. The British captured "'''Ningpo'''" during the First Opium War and&mdash;along with Canton ([[Guangzhou]]), Amoy ([[Xiamen]]), Fuchow ([[Fuzhou]]), and [[Shanghai]]&mdash;it was one of the five Treaty Ports opened to unrestricted foreign trade by the Treaty of Nanjing in 1842. (The spellings changed after the gradual adoption of the Mandarin-based pinyin system since the 1950s.) The Old Bund and the foreign buildings erected around it prior lie in Jiangbei District. Fenghua was the hometown of Chiang Kai-shek.

The long-stagnant economy began a period of regrowth with the establishment of development zones under Deng Xiaoping in the 1980s and 1990s. It is now thoroughly privatized, with state corporations making up less than 20% of the area's GDP. Ningbo includes the only free trade zone in Zhejiang and the Nordic Industrial Park, one of the only wholly foreign-owned industrial parks in China. Foreign and domestic investment have increased substantially since the completion of the Hangzhou Bay Bridge connecting it directly to southern [[Shanghai]]. Today, primary exports include consumer electronics, textiles, food, and industrial tools. The local GDP per capita is about three times the national average and Tianyi Square is a major shopping area in the urban core.

Ningbo's tourist industry includes museums, the few historic sites downtown and its temples, nature reserves, and preserved ancient towns in the countryside. The Siming range lies within the municipality, as does the Hemudu archaeological site. Hemudu was the type site for the Yue civilization that flourished south of the Yangtze River prior to its sinicization by trade and invasion during the Zhou dynasty. Ninghai and Xiangshan Counties lie south of the main Chuanshan Peninsula.

=== Climate ===
Ningbo enjoys a subtropical monsoon climate featuring high relative humidity but distinctive seasons. July is the hottest month (average daily temperature 29°C/84°F) and January the coldest (4°C/39°F).

==Get around==
Downtown Ningbo can fill a few days but is similar to most major Chinese cities.

* Taxis are ¥10 for the first 3.5&nbsp;km. Be aware that a ¥1 "fuel tax" is added to the fare in addition to the price displayed by the meter. As is common throughout China, you should expect no comprehension of English from the driver. Ask the hotel desk or friends to write addresses and cross-streets for you in Chinese or pick up enough Mandarin to be able to direct him ''right'', ''left'', ''U-turn'', &c.

* Busses are usually ¥2, although some older lines without air-conditioning cost ¥1 and some longer lines charge according to distance. Stops are not displayed or announced in English.

* Bike sharing is prevalent. Users will need to install the particular smartphone app specific to the company to rent a bike. Prices are around ¥2 for 30 minutes.
 
* Motorcycles are not permitted downtown but can be rented in the outer areas. Be sure to also rent a helmet or take your own.

* Cars are by far the easiest way of seeing the whole of Ningbo. With a GPS or a local friend, you can enjoy stumbling around until you find your destination or somewhere better by mistake. Rental agencies with chauffeur are available at Lishe Airport.

* Ferry service is no longer available from Shanghai, except indirectly via Putuoshan.

*<see name="Qiantong, Ninghai ancient town" alt="前童古镇" address="" directions="" phone="" url="" hours="" price="40Y" lat="" long="">Qiantong or Qiantongzhen is an ancient town south of the Yangtze River. About 10 km (6 mi) from Ninghai (and about 100 km from Ningbo), it is straightforward to get to because the G15 highway from Ningbo heads directly there with an off-ramp nearby. If you have a car, driving is the best way, it takes about 60 to 90 minutes get there. It is also possible to go on a bus from Ninghai, which can be reached from the long distance bus station in Ningbo. Among the 2000 household here 80% of them have “Tong” as the surname. Since it is located in front of the Baixi river, it is named Qiantong (“Qian” meaning “before” or "in front of"). The town has been around more than 760 years, successive generations of Tongs choosing to remain here. If you've been to other "ancient towns" in China, you will know that they run the gamut of being fully functioning towns as just as they were hundreds of years ago, to tourist dumps with nothing but trinket shops and unwashed hordes. This town receives about 300 to 500 tourists a day (according to the locals) and is large enough that you can spend about an hour wandering around. The level of preservation is still very good, although there were a few buildings being rebuilt in the "old style". This town strikes a decent balance between having some tourists, while maintaining its role as a functioning village. It seems like they've built up the infrastructure to really push more tourism though, despite relatively few making the trip out, so you might want to check the place out now before it becomes overrun. </see>

The whole pavilion and the milieu feature the style of private gardens south of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River.

Debit cards, credit cards, and mobile payment purchases (Alipay, WeChat, etc) are increasingly common but cash remains king. Foreigners can exchange money at all major banks, but should bring their passports and keep the receipts to facilitate exchanging out of RMB at the end of the trip. Bank of China exchanges most currencies but may require setting up an appointment for unusual ones such as Norwegian krone. Rates there are usually very reasonable: a little worse than the best rate available in [[Kowloon]], much better than any European ForEx shop, and comparable or better than credit cards. Minor banks may only exchange American dollars.

International ATMs can be found all over the place. ATM fees and limits vary but will be posted, often in English. A common situation is that Plus/Maestro debit cards can provide about ¥2500 (around $400) per transaction up to ¥5000 maximum each day.

=== Chinese Food===
Ningbo's local dishes are known in Chinese as "Yong Cuisine" (甬菜, Yǒngcài). Specialties include steamed seafood and Ningbo tangyuan, small sweet dumplings made extra savory by preparing their sesame fillings with pork grease.

* '''Tianxiang Yuankongzhong Shishang Canting''' (Revolving Restaurant), 35/F, 181 Zhongshan Dong Road. They are open most of the day, but evening is best. They close at 9pm, so go at least before 7pm. Book in advance if you want a window seat. Reservation Telephone : 0574-8725-7177 – 0. Two of you can eat a basic meal for about &yen;100-200, though if you want to splurge and try out the delicacies on their rather large menu be prepared to pay more.

* '''Shipu Restaurant''' (石浦大酒店) [http://www.chinashipu.com/]. Two locations, 60 Yangyue Jie (tel:8732 8777) at Moon Lake, and 7 Gongqing Road (tel:8730 7470) at Tianyi Square. Considered one of the best restaurants in Ningbo.

* '''Feast Modern Restaurant''' 87 Huaishu Lu 槐树路87号(tel:574-8735-1111) Probably the best Chinese decor in Ningbo. Located in a 200 year old Qing Dynasty merchant house which has been totally renovated, the restaurant offers early twentieth century Shanghai furniture style. The dishes offered are mainly from the region but tend to be more sophisticated than the usual fare found in the city, in general it is excellent. The menu is in Chinese but there are a lot of pictures. Located downtown, 5 minutes or less by taxi from Tianyi Square and Lao Waitan.

*''' Ba Yu Xiaozhan''' (巴渝小栈). 30 Jicao St. (宁波市箕漕街30号). A nondescript Sichuanese restaurant with excellent and affordable food. Grilled fish, Kungpao Chicken, and other spicy cuisine. Fairly clean with modest interior. Located near Baizhang Road, and within walking distance from the Portman/Sheraton.

*''' Fei Teng Yu Xiang ''' (沸腾鱼乡) Leigong Alley (Adjacent to Portman Sheraton Hotel) (宁波市江东区雷公巷）Inexpensive but expertly prepared Sichuan cuisine. This place is a bit of a local favorite among expats and Chinese alike, famous for its boiling fish dish that gives it its namesake (the dish is on the first page of the menu). Stays open super late and the spicy fried potatoes (think Sichuan french fries) are perfect after a night out if you're in the area (Portman bars are nearby). Just ask for 'gan bian tu dou tiao' if you're a foreigner and you come relatively close they'll know what you want. About ¥60 with beers.

===Western Food===
* '''O'Reilly's Irish Pub & Restaurant''' (爱尔兰酒吧). 46-9 North Caihong Rd near the Ningbo Sheraton Portman Plaza (市江东区彩虹北路46-9号, 波特曼大街上). Steaks, burgers, appetizers, all-day breakfast, and sub sandwiches at Subways prices.

Waitresses speak excellent English and Chinese.

A compact street front, neighborhood eatery serving good modern Spanish tapas cuisine in a casual setting with plenty of sangria. Waiters speak so-so English and Chinese.

*'''Picanha Brazilian BBQ''' (比卡亚巴西烧烤). No.1-4 Lane 230 Jiefang South Road, 2nd Floor of Century Plaza(宁波市解放南路230弄1-4号大梁街口世纪广场二楼). Pretty good Brazilian BBQ, buffet style. Can be pricey depending on the option (&yen;228 for meat/buffet/unlimited beer or &yen;128 for meat/buffet),the food is good and chefs are actual Brazilians.

===Splurge===
* '''Waitan Huiguan''' (外灘会馆), Waimalu (外马路) 17. Ningbo.  Reservations: 5 74 – 87 35-16 38, Fx: -13 38, 87 35 09 38.  Clean Teppanyaki place.  Their pricing is also somewhat spectacular - a dinner for two relieves you of about &yen;1,200. Nevertheless, the food is quite well prepared. Service was also quite attentive.

==Drink==
Beer in Ningbo is typically served lukewarm. Large cans and bottles are available at convenience stores and are usually refrigerated during the summer months but not winter. 

The principal bar district is called Lao Waitan. Ningbo bars tend to run "happy hour" specials all day until 8&nbsp;pm. Typical deals include buy-one-get-one-free or buy-two-get-one. Just ask before you order. Le Cargo is the town's dive bar, with brawls and visits from the police a common occurance.

The bars beside the Sheraton attract the new businessmen in town, rubbing shoulders, comparing notes from guide books, or offering each other shares in an idea! before running back to the safety of their hotels. You will also find some foreign students trying to cross over into business around here too.

Bars have also been springing up in the business districts around the port in Beilun, catering to the businessmen before they make the short trip back downtown. (There is usually a cheap hotel nearby as well, if you don't have a driver and fancy a few more drinks.)

If you're staying in a hotel, ask for a business card or two before leaving, so you can easily guide the taxi home no matter how bad your Chinese is!

=== Bars ===

*"'''LBB'''", 14 Da He Alley (大河巷14号）Tucked away down a little alley, you will find the oldest bar in Ningbo, a cool, sophisticated, yet unpretentious bar where you can relax and unwind from a hectic day. Often referred to as "The Bar". LBB is a great place to meet other foreigners and exchange stories and contacts. LBB is out of the way: they don't advertise, the bar is far removed from the Lao Waitan crowd, and they seem to like it like that. The bar has a great atmosphere, medium-range prices, and a relaxed and friendly vibe. The long-running pool competition on Thursdays attracts a mixed crowd of teachers, business men, and locals alike.  Choose your own music, free Wifi, bar snacks, satellite TV, good range of cold beers. Open every day from 7:30pm and stays open till the last person goes home. LBB is the closest thing you'll find to your local bar from back home: the cute staff speak English and there's no funny business with the bill. Locals run tabs and buy bottles.

*"'''O'Reilly's Irish Pub & Restaurant'''", (爱尔兰酒吧). 46-9 North Caihong Rd near the Ningbo Sheraton Portman Plaza (市江东区彩虹北路46-9号, 波特曼大街上). Steaks, burgers, appetizers, all-day breakfast, and sub sandwiches at Subways prices. Beer selection is good, and although the imported draft beers (Guinness, Kilkenny, Stella, 1664) are more pricey than bottles. Happy "hour" from 11:00-20:00. Waitresses speak excellent English.

*"'''The Office'''", located in Lao Waitan.  Under new ownership. Drinks are at or below other spots in Laowaitan. Always someone to talk to.

*'''''Buddha's Bar & Bistro''''', located just inside the entrance to Lao Waitan, Buddha's is an Asian style lounge catering to foreigners. Guests can enjoy MSG-free Chinese classics in either set meals or tapas style along with chill music, comfortable atmosphere, home-grown art and decor, and draft/bottle selections different from most places in town. Murphy's, Fuller's Honey Lager, San Miguel, and Tiger on draft. Beer Lao is a signature bottle for the bar. 

*"'''CMK Music House'''", Qian Hu Tian Di (钱湖北路399号) The wandering music house has finally (and thankfully) found a permanent home in Yinzhou. Atmosphere is good downstairs, but the upstairs plays host to live shows which are well managed. Recently there have been themed dance parties which are cheap or free and usually play fun, unpretentious music. Fun place, and a good place to get your music venue fix when they've got shows. Ask around or check their Facebook page for events.

*"'''dsky home'''" Qian Hu Tian Di (钱湖北路399号) This coffee shop/wine bar/furniture store hybrid (?) nails the atmosphere. Desserts are good, probably the only Key Lime Pie you'll find outside of [[Shanghai]] or [[Beijing]]. One of the best wine lists in town. Everything in the store is for sale and the shop plays host to English board game nights on Tuesdays. Very chill and quiet.
