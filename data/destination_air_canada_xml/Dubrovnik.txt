'''Dubrovnik''' is an old city on the [[Dalmatia|Adriatic Sea coast]] in the extreme south of [[Croatia]]. It is one of the most prominent tourist resorts of the Mediterranean, a seaport and the centre of the Dubrovnik-Neretva County. Its population is about 43,000 in 2011. Dubrovnik is nicknamed "Pearl of the Adriatic" and is listed as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] since 1979.

==Understand==
[[Image:800px-Dubrovnik_Croatia.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Dubrovnik]]
The city of Dubrovnik (Latin: ''Ragusa'') was built on maritime trade. In the Middle Ages it became the only city-state in the Adriatic to rival [[Venice]]. Supported by its wealth and skilled diplomacy, the city achieved a remarkable level of development during the 15th and 16th centuries. Furthermore, Dubrovnik was one of the centres of the development of the Croatian language and literature, home to many notable poets, playwrights, painters, mathematicians, physicists and other scholars.

Today Dubrovnik is the proudest feather in [[Croatia]]'s tourist cap, an elite destination and one of the most beautiful towns in the Mediterranean. Dubrovnik used to be an independent republic, surviving mostly on trade. It managed to survive many centuries, with constant threats to its territory, particularly from the mighty Ottoman Empire and [[Venice]]. As early as 19th century, it was discovered by celebrities as a place to be seen. George Bernard Shaw once said that "those who seek paradise on Earth should come to Dubrovnik and find it". Royalty, presidents and diplomats have all favored the city. The late Pope John Paul II was a fan of Dubrovnik and was even made an honorary citizen. Out of the 23 top luxury hotels in Croatia in 2010, 13 were located in Dubrovnik.

Dubrovnik is steeped in stunning architecture and sculptural detail, and boasts spectacular churches, monasteries, museums, and fountains. A multitude of typical towns and excursions include: The Elaphiti Islands, the attractive town of [[Cavtat]],the Konavle valley, [[Mljet]] Island, [[Korčula]] Island, Ston and Peljesac Peninsula. The neighbouring towns of [[Kotor]] and Perast in [[Montenegro]] or [[Mostar]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] also make for intriguing day trips.

===By plane===

'''Dubrovnik airport''' ({{IATA|DBV}}) ({{ICAO|LDDU}}), [http://www.airport-dubrovnik.hr] is located about 20 km to the south of the city. 

The following airlines operate service to/from Dubrovnik Airport: 

'''Aer Lingus''' ([[Dublin]]-seasonal), '''Austrian Airlines''' ([[Vienna]]), '''British Airways''' ([[London]]-Gatwick), '''Croatia Airlines''' ([[Amsterdam]], [[Athens]], [[Belgrade]]-seasonal, [[Düsseldorf]], [[Frankfurt]], [[London]]-Gatwick, [[Munich]], [[Paris]]-Charles de Gaulle, [[Pula]], [[Rome]]-Fiumicino, [[Split]], [[Tel Aviv]], [[Vienna]], [[Zagreb]], [[Zürich]]), '''EasyJet''' ([[Berlin]]-Schönefeld-seasonal), [[Geneva]]-seasonal, [[Liverpool]]-seasonal, [[London]]-Gatwick-seasonal, [[Milan]]-Malpensa-seasonal, [[Paris]]-Orly-seasonal), '''Germanwings''' ([[Berlin]]-Schönefeld, [[Cologne]]/[[Bonn]], [[Hamburg]]), '''Iberia Airlines''' ([[Madrid]]-seasonal), '''Jet2.com''' ([[Belfast]]-seasonal, [[Edinburgh]]-seasonal, [[Leeds]]-seasonal, [[Manchester]]-seasonal), '''Lufthansa''' ([[Munich]]), '''Luxair''' ([[Luxembourg]]), '''Norwegian Air Shuttle''' ([[Bergen]], [[Oslo]]-Gardermoen, [[Stavanger]], [[Stockholm]]-Arlanda, [[Trondheim]], [[Warsaw]]), '''Thomson Airways''' ([[London]]-Gatwick, [[London]]-Luton, [[Manchester]]-seasonal),'''Turkish Airlines'''[[Istanbul]], '''Vueling''' ([[Barcelona]]-seasonal)

In 2019, the first direct flight to North America was established -- '''American Airlines''' now offers seasonal nonstop flights from [[Philadelphia]].

=====Airport bus transfers=====

Croatia Airlines operates buses between the airport and the main bus station in Kantafig (35 kn, 45 min), which is 2.5 km northwest of the Old Town. This service has no set time table, and instead departs along with flight arrivals - though they're quite well-known to sometimes wait much longer or leave before people have even had time to deplane. The Platanus shuttle operates between the airport and Port Gruz/Main Bus Terminal with a stop in the Old Town (as of 2023, €10 one way, €14 return ticket). The stop for the Old Town from the airport will drop you off at Ploce Gate, the eastern entrance to the Old Town. Taxis from the airport to the centre will cost 320 kn.  
Going to the airport from Dubrovnik, the same Platanus shuttle service posts a schedule online that is updated weekly depending on the point in the season and flight schedules.  Departure times are also displayed in the tourist information office at Pile Gate. The departure times are only listed for the time they are scheduled to leave the Main Bus station, the bus will then arrive by the Old Town stop approximately 10 minutes after, depending on traffic. Arrive early just in case. The bus passes close to the Old Town en route to the airport and you can board this bus at the bus stop on Petra Kresimira 4 just above the Old Town, by the lower cable car station entrance (not the ticket window, but where you would enter to board the cable car further up the hill) - this is a different location than where you will be dropped off coming from the airport. Make sure you wave furiously otherwise the driver may not stop.

===By train===

There is no train to Dubrovnik. A narrow gauge line used to link Dubrovnik to [[Sarajevo]] but was closed in 1976.  

The closest rail station is at [[Ploče]], less than 2 hr by bus from Dubrovnik. From there, you can connect to trains to [[Mostar]] and [[Sarajevo]]. Trains to points north can be boarded at [[Split]], a 4 hr bus ride from Dubrovnik.

===By car===

The trip from [[Split]] along the coastal road (Jadranska magistrala or D8) is a beautiful scenic journey through small, quaint villages and other tourist destinations. Just know that in the summer months the trip is likely to take several hours longer than anticipated. What looks like a short trip on a map can take 6 hr.

A much faster way of simply getting from Split to Dubrovnik by car is to take the A1 highway to Vrgorac and then continue via Staševica, Opuzen and Neum to Dubrovnik.

===By bus===

The main bus station is in Kantafig, near Port Gruz and the Tudjman bridge, 2.5 km northwest of the Old Town. Local bus 7 operates between this station and Babin kuk, and bus 1 serves Old Town.

Direct buses run to/from [[Zagreb]] (205-234 kn, 11 hr, 7 daily), [[Korcula]] (100 kn, 3 hr, 1 daily), [[Mostar]] (100 kn, 3 hr, 2 daily), [[Orebic]] (100 kn, 2.5 hr, 1 daily), [[Rijeka]] (400 kn, 12 hr, 3 daily), [[Sarajevo]] (160 kn, 5 hr, 1 daily), [[Split]] (100-150 kn, 4.5 hr, 14 daily), [[Zadar]] (200 kn, 8 hr, 7 daily). In the high season, there is also a daily bus leaving at 11AM going to the [[Montenegro]] cities of [[Herceg Novi]], [[Bar]], [[Kotor]], and [[Budva]]. And at 15h to [[Prijedor]] and [[Banja Luka]] (10h) in Bosnia. A one-way trip to Budva costs 128 kn, or €15. The return tickets are much cheaper and advisable, just look out for the choice of the bus company.

When coming by bus from Split or cities further north, police officers may board the bus and you may be asked for a valid identity document when crossing the [[Neum]] corridor which belongs to [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].  While the bus companies list trip duration of approx. 4 hr, be prepared for a ride of closer to 5.5-6 hr, including Bosnian border checks.

When travelling into Montenegro and the Airport sit on the right hand side (not behind driver) for best views, and vice-versa for the return. Travelling to Bosnia, sit on the left hand side (behind the driver) for best views.

A departure listing for the international bus station is available [http://www.libertasdubrovnik.hr/] [http://www.libertasdubrovnik.com/voznired.pdf] at the website of the city bus operator. Further details can be found online [http://www.autobusni-kolodvor.com/en/bus_transport_company.aspx?p=120]

On all intercity buses you pay a separate fee of €2 or 10 kn to the driver for luggage. So keep some change ready.

===By boat===

=====Cruise ships=====
Many cruise ships come to this port of call, typically docking at the Port of Dubrovnik [http://www.portdubrovnik.hr/?lan=en&action=port_dubrovnik&kat=101&pdl=101] (Port Gruz) across from the main bus station, 2.5 km northwest of the walled old town. The easiest and cheapest way to get from the main bus station to the Old Town is by using the local buses number 1, 1A and 1B, which circulate almost constantly.  Some cruise ships anchor offshore just east of the Old Town and tender the passengers directly into the the Old Port.  In 2010 over 900,000 passengers visited Dubrovnik by cruise ships.

=====Ferries=====

=====Jadrolinija=====

* '''From [[Rijeka]]''' [http://www.jadrolinija.hr/default.aspx?lang=2] Ferries run up and down the coast. Calling at [[Split]], [[Stari Grad]], [[Korčula]] and [[Sobra]] on the way. Journey time is up to 20 hr, so consider getting a cabin. The restaurant serves up some decent food at surprisingly reasonable prices, but bear in mind that the +23% tax is not included on the menu. While the journey is scenic there is nothing in the way of entertainment. Come prepared with a good book or just sit on the deck and watch the Adriatic Sea go by. This is more than enough entertainment for an afternoon.

* '''From [[Bari]]''' [http://www.jadrolinija.hr/default.aspx?lang=2] in Italy. The dull engine vibration or the swaying of the boat from high winds are likely to keep you awake.  Cabins are strongly recommended.  Although you can sit comfortably enough inside with the cheaper deck pass, interior temperature hovers at 60⁰F or below and makes for a chilly night even in the height of summer.  Sadly this ferry seems quite overpriced: two adult single tickets plus a noisy, small interior 2-berth cabin costs €168.

==Get around==
[[Image:DubrovnikStradun.jpg|thumb|Stradun]]

The Old Town can be comparatively difficult to navigate on first appearances, as it really is a warren of little streets. There are however signs at the entrances to many of these streets advertising what businesses, shops, restaurants and  accommodation are to be found in that direction. 

That being said, some of these signs appear to be either intentionally misleading or woefully out of date. For example, there is no office of any bus company within the Old Town, despite what the signs may say.

The city is completely pedestrianised and easily small enough to get around on foot, some of the streets are a little steep though.

===By bus===

If you are not staying in Old Town, it's relatively simple get there by bus, as just about every one leads to the Old Town. However, it might be advisable to get a timetable [http://www.libertasdubrovnik.com/gradski.swf] just in case. It costs 13 kn (€1.73) for tickets bought at any kiosk,or 15 kn bought on the bus; ticket valid for 1 hr. At selected kiosks (including the international bus station) you can purchase a day pass for 30 kn. This pass is valid for 24 hr of unlimited travel on the city bus network, starting from the first validation. The easiest way to get from the Main Bus Station to the Old Town is by using the (mostly modern and A/C equipped) buses number 1, 1A and 1B, which circulate almost constantly. These buses can be boarded from the bus stop just outside the Main Bus Station. Apart from this, there is another bus service which comes inside the bus station and drops you directly at the Old Town. Schedules are available at the information counter of the Main Bus Station.

===Car rental===

In the off season, rates can be negotiated down by contacting the company in advance.  You will get a better rate doing this than booking online directly.  Local companies generally have cheaper rates than the multi-nationals.

===By Bike===

You can also get around the city by renting a bike. It is a nice adventure and a cheap way to take in Dubrovnik. The Old Town as well as the surrounding areas have excellent road conditions throughout. If you rent a bike or a scooter to travel around always be cautious and use a helmet, despite it not always being enforced.

==See==

Dubrovnik was heavily bombed during the Croatian War of Independence from 1991 to 1995. Almost all of the damage has been repaired; however, if you look closely around the old town, mortar damage in the cobblestone streets and bullet marks in the stone houses are visible.

Like many cities, Dubrovnik has launched a 'city card' that covers access for multiple attractions and public transportation (does not include ferries or the airport shuttle, which are private). The 1-Day Dubrovnik Pass is 35 euros as of 2023, the same cost as a single adult ticket for the City walls, so it's an easy choice to go for the pass rather than paying just for the walls. The ticket includes then, access to a large number of museums in the Old City - but can only be used for one visit to the walls. While not listed on the list of included attractions, the Pass (as well as the regular City walls tickets) also include access to St Lawrence's Fort.

If you take the headland path to the right hand side of Lapad beach, as you look at the Adriatic, you can walk along a charming little coast path with small concrete 'beaches' and ladders into the sea. These were put in during the Tito era and are ideal for one or two sunbathers. Walking further along is an excellent local fish restaurant - ideal for ending the day. The walk back is not particularly well lit, but perfectly safe.</see>

** '''Walk up''' the winding footpath to the fortress and large cross on the hilltop 400 m above Dubrovnik. Walking up from the old town takes about 90 min. The path is quite rocky so use suitable footwear.
**Take the new renovated '''Cable car''' and you will be from Down station to Mountain Srđ in less then 4 min. Round trip ticket 170 kn.
**Go by '''car''' via Bosanka village. Follow Jadranska cesta (D8) towards Mlini and drive past Dubrovnik. Turn left to Bosanka village and follow the road up the hill.

* Visit the '''Fortress Lovrijenac'''. It was an essential fortification to the defense of the city from both ground and sea attacks. In order to prevent possible mutiny by the commander of the fortress, the walls facing the city are only 60 cm thick compared to those exposed to enemy fire which were 12 m thick. Above the entrance to the fortress is an inscription that says "Non bene pro toto libertas venditur auro" which translates to ''Freedom is not sold for all the gold in the world''.

*'''Game of Thrones''' shooting locations. It is well known that Dubrovnik played an important role in the series and interestingly, it was not necessary to use a lot of special effects to turn Dubrovnik into King's Landing.

These are mostly found in clear water and are easy to spot. </do>

===Sailing and boat trips===

Dubrovnik is an excellent starting point for exploring southern Adriatic coast primarily Elaphite islands, Korcula, Pelješac and Mljet. There are many charter agencies where you can charter a sailing or motor yacht which are based in Dubrovnik. Majority of them operate from ACI marina Dubrovnik (42°40,3’ N 18°07,6’ E) which is based in Komolac. 

When you charter a yacht through charter agency and arrive to designated marina there are a few things that need to be done. The most important thing is the yacht check in (usually Saturday around 4PM). Take your time doing yacht check in. Familiarise yourself with the chartered yacht and with the yacht equipment. 

The rule of thumb is the more time you take for the yacht check in, the less time you will need for the yacht check out. After that you have to do the shopping for the charter vacation. 

Don't neglect the grocery shopping because the sea is unpredictable and you don't want to get stuck on the boat without anything to eat or drink. You can do the shopping in a marina however the prices are usually much higher there, or you can order from yacht provisioning services who usually deliver the products to the marina at no extra fee. 

:*'''In Jam Yacht Supply''', [http://www.jamyachtsupply.com/]. Online provisioning catalog where you can order from a large selection of groceries and other products months in advance and everything you order awaits for you in the marina. This is convenient because it takes the load of you and the things you must do when you arrive at the marina for your sailing holiday.

* '''Lokrum''', Take a ferry to the Island of Lokrum which houses a monastery, a fort with great views of Dubrovnik, botanical gardens and a naturist beach. Preserved as a ''nature park'' this small island is reachable in 10 min in boat-time from the old city port. It offers unparalleled serenity, beauty and peace.

* '''Mljet''', Take a day trip from Dubrovnik and visit the most southern and most eastern larger Croatian island. Its northwest part is also a National park – the oldest sea park on the Mediterranean. You can get to Mljet by a catamaran line that departs from Dubrovnik's harbour.

===Festivals===

* '''Dubrovnik Summer Festival''', [http://www.dubrovnik-festival.hr]. Music and theatre festival held since 1949 from 10th July to 25th August. Famous nationwide for its exquisite selection of drama, plays and concert of chamber music with more then 2,000 artists from 30 countries during 47 days of festival. Be sure to book in advance and don't miss a chance to see some of the open-air performances.

* '''Libertas Film Festival''', [http://www.libertasfilmfestival.com]. Film festival held from August 25-30.

[[Image:Dubrovnik shops.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A lane with tourist shops in Dubrovnik]]

As of Jan 2023, Croatia has officially moved to the euro. You'll find prices in Dubrovnik are quite steep, even compared to major 'famously expensive' cities in Europe. If your trip includes stops in other cities, you're more likely to find better prices elsewhere in Croatia, especially for non-artisan products. That being said, if you do find an artisan shop or true handmade items, consider supporting those - the popularity of Dubrovnik has meant that most locals are being increasingly priced out of the area.

There are many local artisans who specialize in domestic crafts. Popular purchases include: handmade tablecloths, linens, lavender products, and napkins. Many merchants claim that the necktie was invented in Croatia. Another local specialty is little dolls dressed in local garb. 

A small market takes place daily in Gundulic Square right by the Cathedral - it's traditionally Dubrovnik's main market but has also unfortunately become victim to local vendors being priced out and is now reduced to only a handful of stands selling homemade lavender products, crafts, honeys and fruit wines - but a great opportunity to support local producers still.

The '''Pharmacy''', at the Franciscan Monastery creates hand creams and other toiletries based on ancient recipes. The pharmacy is one of the oldest in this part of Europe. It has been opperating from the time of its foundation to the present day. 

While wandering around the Old Town, you will come across many shops that sell Croatian goods such as wine and textiles.

If you have transport there is a Lidl (German discount supermarket) 5 km east of the Old Town near the village of Čibača - this is where the locals shop to avoid steep Dubrovnik prices. Otherwise you'll find small, reasonably priced supermarkets (Konzum and Studenpac) just outside the city walls at Ploce and Pile Gate, as well as a few (very small) locations inside the city walls. 

*<buy name="Magnolika" alt="" address="Ulica Getaldiceva 7" directions="3rd St. to the right in the Old Town" phone="+385 98 195 4040" url="http://www.magnolika.com" hours="" price="" lat="" long="">Small gallery with unconventional art and cool jewellery design.</buy>

==Eat==

There is a wide range of restaurants in the Old Town, mostly offering a very similar menu of local seafood and some meat dishes. The cuisine may not be very imaginative, but it is usually of good quality and very fresh.

Restaurants can be crudely separated into (slightly) cheaper tourist-trap places, and more expensive but first class gastronomic restaurants.  There are a few pizzerias, mostly wood-fired and quite acceptable. The Kraš chocolate sold at stores is delicious. Remember that Dubrovnik, more so than the rest of Croatia, is well aware of its status as a tourist hot-spot. Rents for restaurant premises are high and consequently the prices on the menus reflect this. 

Note that in the off peak season of November-March nearly all the top-end restaurants close, leaving only a handful of desperate tourist trap enterprises operating and still charging high prices. You can however still eat well and discounts can be negotiated.

Dubrovnik cuisine is characteristically not very spicy and is famous for traditionalism. Many popular meals are characteristic of Dubrovnik such as zelena menestra (cabbage and other vegetables with meat), pasticada (braised beef dish cooked in a fragrant sweet and sour sauce), and the famous delicacy dubrovacka rozata (crème caramel custard). Dubrovnik fish restaurants are popular.

==Drink==

The most popular hard alcohol in Croatia is home made ''rakija''. This is a very strong distilled drink made from a variety of fruits.  Examples include ''sljivovica'', made from plums, ''loza'', made from grapes, and ''orahovica'', made with walnuts. All are quite strong.

There are many excellent local wines from both the Peljesac Peninsula and Konavle and it is often less expensive than soft drinks like Coca Cola. However, be careful when purchasing wine from unlicensed dealers. Though the price is very attractive with some being as low as 10 kn or €1.5 per litre it can sometimes be of low quality.  

===Cafes===

There are numerous cafes throughout the Old Town and the entire city with prices varying according to the location (particularly, those located on the Stradun are by far the most expensive but you are paying for the ambiance and people-watching as well). Most cafes serve a wide variety of drinks all day.

===Bars===

Walk towards the sea from Stradun near the Ploce gate, and you'll hit a tiny square with outdoor seating by 4 or 5 different pubs, with live music playing, and large cocktail pitchers with very low alcohol content.

* <drink name="Cafe Buža" alt="" address="Iza Mura" directions="Follow a sign that says ‘cold drinks’ and enter through a hole in the wall on the south side of the Old Town.

Eclectic chilled out music plays unobtrusively in the background. There isn’t much in the way of shelter apart from some palm leaves so Buža won’t open in bad weather.</drink>

Private rooms are a good option for those on a budget, starting from around €10 per person for comfort and privacy exceeding those of hostels. The downside is that they may be far from the Old Town, so make sure you check the location. Owners letting out these rooms accost buses at the bus station, so you can ask around and even bargain a little.

==Stay safe==

* Dubrovnik is a very safe city, though the usual precautions should be taken to protect yourself from pick-pocketing.

* The streets in the old town can be quite slippery as they've been smoothed down for centuries by people walking over them.

====Stay legal====

*When entering a port, it is international protocol to hoist a flag meaning; "Ready for inspection by Customs".

*In Croatia you must ''always'' have your headlights on while operating a motor vehicle including all cars, motorbikes and scooters. Recent changes to the law made this compulsory only during winter daylight savings time. Headlights are no longer required during the day in the summer months although many motorists still leave them turned on.

==Contact==

====Internet cafes====

In Dubrovnik internet cafes are plentiful. Rates are generally 25 kn/hr.

==Get out==

Dubrovnik is a common stop for multi-city trips in the region, and is often used as a hub for day trips to nearby destinations, especially Kotor Bay in Montenegro, Mostar in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the Elaphite Islands. These day trip tours are run by a relatively small number of providers and tend to be quite steep in price. They manage the convenience of transportation but are frequently quite 'barebones' on actual tour information and can spend a lot of time on hotel pick-ups of other guests, extended wait times at the border, etc. Coach tour bus trips from Dubrovnik to Kotor Bay and Mostar typically run for ~55 euros per person for the 1.5 hr and 2 hr trip respectively. Small group tours in vans with up to 8 guests will run higher, typically around 85-90 euros for Mostar and 150+ euros for Kotor Bay. The drive is quite straightforward for both, and often faster at passport control for passenger cars - so if you have the appropriate license and are comfortable driving - it may be cheaper and easier for you to rent a car and then a tour at the destination rather than book transport via a tour company. 

* There are many destinations within Croatia that can be accessed from Dubrovnik with popular attractions including [[Split]] and the [[Plitvice National Park|Plitvice Lakes National Park]] as well as the capital, [[Zagreb]] which is approximately a 10 hr drive away (six hours if you travel outside the tourist season and take the new highway). Check out the timetables at Libertas Dubrovnik [[http://libertasdubrovnik.hr/]].

* A popular shopping destination for locals, [[Neum]] in Herzegovina (Bosnia and Herzegovina) offers many cheap goods for frugal travellers. Buses heading between Split and Dubrovnik will often stop for a short while here to collect various supplies.

* [[Montenegro]] Daily buses operates from Dubrovnik through to [[Kotor]], [[Budva]] or [[Herceg Novi]].

* [[Ston]] is known for oysters and old salt ponds still in use and the longest stone wall in Europe (5 km long).

* [[Trsteno]] 15-century summer residence with renaissance garden.

* [[Mostar]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] makes a good two day trip by bus from Dubrovnik. The ride will take about 2 to 2.5 hrs (sometimes longer with traffic during peak season). The city has a much stronger Turkish feel as opposed to Dubrovnik's Italian.

* [[Sarajevo]] is worth visiting as it is considered by some as one of the most beautiful cities in Europe.

* A boat trip to the Elaphiti Islands (Koločep, Šipan, Lopud) is well worthwhile, with plenty of places to swim, fish, or relax.

* [[Međugorje]] Visit the Shrine of Međugorje for a religious experience. 

* [[Mljet]] island. Green island with lakes and monasteries.
* Go on a wine tasting tour to Pelješac peninsula
