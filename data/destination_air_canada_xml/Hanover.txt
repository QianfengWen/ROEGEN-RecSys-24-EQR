'''Hanover''' (German: ''Hannover'' [http://www.hannover.de/english/index.html], French: ''Hanovre''), is the capital of [[Lower Saxony]] (''Niedersachsen'') in [[Germany]]. Having a huge exhibition complex built for the World EXPO in 2000 and being host to several of the biggest exhibitions in the world, Hanover calls herself the '''"EXPO City"''' or "Exhibition City" (''EXPO Stadt''/''Messestadt''). Hanover also played host to the 2006 Football World Cup. The major language spoken is German. English is ''not'' common, except during CeBIT or major international events nevertheless most people understand English and will be able to help you find your way around.

==Understand==

Hanover is not a typical European city. Don't expect to see beautiful centuries-old buildings; this city was one of the hardest hit during World War II, leaving it with only a few historical landmarks. Even the Old City (''Altstadt'') area is "new", all the old houses left standing after the war (around 40) were taken from throughout the city and deposited here. This area is surrounded by grey 1950's buildings that give a somewhat heavy atmosphere to the streets. However, there still are several residential neighborhoods consisting of late-19th-century housing stock with often elaborate historicist (Victorian) and ''Jugendstil'' (Art Noveau) decorations just outside the downtown area, such as ''Oststadt'', ''List'' or ''Linden''.

Hanover has large green areas, with forests and big parks. The landscape is mostly flat, with the river Leine going through the city. The lake Masch (''Maschsee'') is rather spectacular, considering its size as a man-made object.

[[File:Niki de Saint Phalle Promenade.jpg|thumb|Niki de Saint Phalle Promenade]]
The city had a special relationship to the late French artist Niki de Saint-Phalle. She had several of her works in public spots in Hanover (''i.e.'', "the Nanas", "the Cave" in the Great Garden) and also in the Sprengel Museum. To honor her contribution to Hanover, she was granted an honorary citizenship from the city government. Moreover, the recently renovated "underground" shopping passageway from the central station to Kröpcke was named "The Niki de Saint-Phalle Promenade".
Hanover's public services are excellent, due to major reconstruction for the World EXPO 2000. The shopping area under the train station was renovated in 2005-2006 in preparation for the World Cup.

===Kröpcke===

Kröpcke is a large pedestrian area in the heart of Hanover. It is Hanover's major shopping spot, home to the Opera house and has lots of places to eat. The main station in the Hanover Stadtbahn network, is also located here. All Stadtbahn lines except the 10 and 17, call at the station and it is the main interchange point for the network. It has six platforms in total on three lines that cross each other in independent tunnels. There is a big green clock in Kröpcke ('''''KröpckeUhr''''') which makes an ideal meeting point. 

===Using English===

Hanover became more of a tourist destination since it began hosting CeBIT, and especially following the EXPO in 2000. English translation was just recently introduced to some official tourist portals such as the train ticket machines. Germans are generally helpful, but you ''have to ask'' for help as they don't like to jump into other people's business without being invited. Most university students speak English. For general information, it's safest to go to the '''Tourist Office''', Prinzenstr. 12 (close to central station), ''+49-511''-12345-111, M-F 9AM-6PM, Sa 9AM-2PM.

==Get in== 

===By plane===
'''Hanover airport''' (IATA: '''HAJ''') [http://www.hannover-airport.de/] handles many European major airlines, including budget airlines TUI [http://www.flytui.co.uk] and Corendon [https://www.corendonairlines.com/]. There is a train that runs twice-an-hour (called the ''S-Bahn'') from the airport to the central station (''Hauptbahnhof''). A 2-Zone ticket is needed from the airport to city center. The fare is €3.6 and will take around 17 minutes.  There are no trains between 1:30 am and 4 am.  A taxi ride to the city center costs about €20 and will take about 15 minutes.

The airport offers the option to check in the day ''before'' your departure (6-9 PM) for some airlines (Hapag-Lloyd, Condor, Air Berlin, Sky Airlines, and Croatia Airlines).

===By train===

[[File:Hannover - Hauptbahnhof (main station).jpg|thumb|250px|Hauptbahnhof (main station)]]
Due to its location, Hanover has good connections from all major cities in Germany through Deutsche Bahn (DB) [http://www.bahn.de], the German rail service. There are also direct trains to the Netherlands, Switzerland, France, and Austria several times a day, including night train connections with Nachtzug trains ([http://www.nachtzugreise.de], CityNightLine [http://www.citynightline.ch/]). Hanover is also reachable by regional trains, making it possible to use the cheap and popular "weekend tickets". 

The high speed Inter City Express Trains (ICE trains)[http://www.raileurope.com/train-faq/european-trains/ice/how-to-book.html] can take you all over Germany to places such as: Frankfurt, Hamburg, Stuttgart, Munich, Cologne, and Berlin. The trip to Hanover from Berlin takes 1:30, from Hamburg 1:20, from Frankfurt 2:20, and from Munich 4:30. Prices vary depending on time of travel and the ticket type such as an economy, freedom or comfort ticket, but a freedom ticket from Berlin to Hanover with cost you from €75.

===By car===

Hanover is served by the excellent German road system, being on both the Hamburg to Kassel (Autobahn A7) running north and south and the Berlin to Dusseldorf (A2) running east and west. The city is easily reached after leaving these two motorways. In Germany they drive on the right and some stretches of the autobahns have no speed limits. While the limits on the B-roads are quite high, at up to 130kph outside of towns, they can drop to as low as 50kph in built up areas. From Hamburg the drive is around an hour and a half. From Berlin and Dusseldorf, the drive is around 3 hours.

===By bus===
Hanover is linked to the rest of Germany and parts of Europe by frequent bus services. Bus rides tend to be fairly quick avoiding unnecessary hold ups but they are not the most comfortable way to travel especially for long distances. The Central Bus Station (''Zentraler Omnibus Bahnhof'' or "ZOB") is located behind (to the north-west of) the Central Station (''Hauptbahnhof'').

* Buses to [[Bosnia]] are eg. run by Salinea, [http://www.salinea.net/red_voznje.asp]
* Buses to [[Croatia]] are eg. run by Čazmatrans [http://www.cazmatrans.hr/njem-zg.html]

==Get around==

===By public transportation===

[[File:Metro station Altenbekener Damm.jpg|thumb|Metro station Altenbekener Damm]]
[[File:Bus stop at Willy-Brandt Allee.jpg|thumb|Bus stop at Willy-Brandt Allee]]
Hanover has a fantastic network of public transportation, so it's best to just park your car and ride. If you plan to make more than than two trips by tram, bus, or subway, a day ticket is your best bet, buying you unlimited travel on the public transport system. Day tickets are valid until the last connection of the day (which normally ends sometime after midnight). The public transportation adopts an honor system for tickets, but they do have ticket inspections once in a while (also late at nights and early mornings). The fine is quite high, so make sure you have a ticket all the time. Be aware that some tickets will need to be validated (stamped on the 'blue box'), and some not, depending on the machine. [http://www.uestra.de]

* '''Hannover Card''' [http://www.hannover.de/english/tourism_culture/info_offers/offers/hanncard/index.html]. Hannover Card is issued by the Tourism Office. It includes free use of public transportation and discounts for some local attractions (''e.g.'' museums, opera, the Great Garden), tours, and restaurants. Price: Single ticket: 1 day €9.50, 2 day €13, 3 days €16; Group ticket (2-5 persons): 1 day €18, 3 days €31. 

* '''Ticket and Cards Regions'''. It may be confusing to understand the zones of Hanover public transportation. The key is to know that there are "tickets" and "cards". The term "tickets" applies to the ones bought at the machine or elsewhere, while "cards" are the ones with (monthly) subscription. Inside the city area, you only need a 1-zone ticket as it already covers a good part of the city. However, for the airport you will need a 2-zone ticket, as it is located outside Zone 1. Tickets are valid on bus, tram, fast tram (''S-Bahn''), and regional train.

* '''Ticket Price'''
:* Day ticket: €5.40 (1 zone), €7.00, (2 zones), €8.60 (3 zones)
:* Group day ticket (up to 5 persons): €10.20 (1 zone), €13.00 (2 zones), €16.00 (3 zones)
:* Single-trip ticket: €2.70 (1 zone), €3.50 (2 zone), €4.40 (3 zone)
:* Reduced ticket (children 6-14y, big dogs): €1.30 (all zone)
:* Day ticket child (6-14 yrs): €2.60 (all zones)
:* Special price for 6 single-trip tickets (''SammelTicket''): €14.80 (1 zone), €18.50 (2 zones)

===By bicycle or on foot===

Bike paths are provided in almost every street that runs through the city. There is no law on using a helmet, but make sure that the bike has both front and rear lights if you don't want to get stopped by the police (Fine: €10). Pedestrian paths are also provided along every street and there is also a pedestrian area in front of Central Station to Kröpcke.

It is possible to take your bike on the tram or bus for free on M-F 8:30AM-3PM and after 7PM. There are no time restrictions on weekends.

===By taxi===

Unless you have limited time, lots of heavy baggage, or are traveling after public transport stops at night, you might want to think twice about using taxi, as it is very expensive. However, it could be cheaper if traveling in a big group: You can order a 7- or 9-seat taxi by phone and get more people in at the same price.

Fireworks usually start at 10PM. <!--Is this particularly notable?: However, there is no organised big firework on New Year's Eve.--> <!--Yes it is notable because in summer it gets very late dark outside, and one can plan the visit of a fireworks better if one knows when the fireworks starts -->
