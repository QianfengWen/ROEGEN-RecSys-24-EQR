'''Napier''' [http://www.napier.govt.nz/] is a city (population 61,000) in [[Hawke's Bay]], on the east coast of the [[North Island (New Zealand)|North Island]] of [[New Zealand]].  The city is famed for its '''Art Deco''' architecture and contains the largest concentration of inner-city Art Deco buildings in the world.  The other main attraction there is wine -- specifically from the wineries in Hawke's Bay, now New Zealand's second-largest wine-producing region behind Marlborough.

The 1931 Napier earthquake and subsequent fire destroyed much of the downtown business area. When this area was rebuilt, it was reconstructed in the prevailing '''Art Deco''' style. Now it is the Art Deco capital of the world. The demolition rubble was dumped along the eastern foreshore and turned into gardens and a recreational reserve.

The earthquake also raised the land by several meters. The airport and low-lying land in the industrial land of Onekawa and Pandora, and the suburbs of Pirimai and Tamatea were previously estuary. Some of the streets in the area have retained the names they had when they were on the coastline - streets called a ''quay'' or a ''bay'' may be inland now.

The nearby township of [[Taradale]] has the region's oldest and most famous wineries that host concerts during the summer seasons.
