From the Varden viewpoint (407 m.a.s.) there is a good view of the town of Molde, the fjord and islands and the famous Molde panorama with its 222 partially snow-clad peaks. On clear days you can see as far as the fishing village of Ona and the dreaded waters of the Hustadvika bay. 10 minutes by car or 1 hour’s walk along the nature trail from the centre of Molde.

More than 50 old buildings originating from all over the region have been moved here to form typical country courtyards of farm buildings, including open hearth houses, sheds, outhouses, smokehouses and a small chapel. The Town Street with Mali’s Café shows typical Molde town houses from the pre-war period. At Holmarka the museum has a stable which houses the museum’s horse, hens, sheep and rabbits. Folk dancing displays by the children’s folk dance group, Leikarringen, in connection with 40-50 cruise ship visits every summer. During the Molde International Jazz Festival, the Romsdal Museum is used as the open-air stage for the big outdoor concerts.

* '''The Fisheries Museum on Hjertøya.''' The Fisheries Museum is in the form of a small fishing village with old houses, fishermen’s shacks, cod-liver oil factory, engineering workshop and schoolroom. It portrays local coastal culture, working life and living conditions from around 1850. Large collection of boats and maritime equipment. The Hjertøya island is a great recreational area where you can hire rowing boats, fish or swim in the sea. Free Schwitters exhibition in the barn. Café and kiosk in the weekends. Tel.

* '''Jazzgutten - The Jazz Boy.''' On the lower market place, with the fjord and the mountains as a backdrop, is the bronze statue “Jazzgutten”, a young jazz player with his saxophone. The sculpture by Nina Due, was a gift from the people to commemorate the town’s 250th anniversary in 1992.

* '''The green corridor.''' The green corridor runs from the sea at Reknes to the Chateau (baroque villa), continuing through the Reknes Park up to the ”Pavillion” at the Rekneshaugen viewpoint. The nature trail then passes through the Romsdal Museum and proceeds to Varden (407 m.a.s.), from where you can enjoy a marvellous view of the town, the fjord and the Molde panorama.

* '''Molde Cathedral.''' The cathedral, which was consecrated in 1957, is a double-nave long church in the Gothic style. A 50 metre high freestanding bell tower culminates in a copper-clad pyramid. The interior of the church contains some lovely stained glass and is richly decorated with Christian symbols and signs. It is the third church to be built on the site. The two first ones burned down, but an old wooden cross and Axel Ender’s famous “Easter Morning” altarpiece were rescued from the flames.

* '''Rosepiken - The Rose Maiden and the Town Hall.''' At the Town Hall Square in the “Town of Roses” stands the bronze statue “Rosepiken”, surrounded by a dancing fountain. The Rose Maiden is young and beautiful, and has her arms full of roses. The sculpture was a gift to Molde in 1971 from Gotlib Moe. It was sculpted by Ragnhild Butenschøn. Molde Town Hall was completed in 1966 and is the result of an architectural competition won by the architects Cappelen and Rodahl. The roof of the town hall boasts one of the town’s most beautiful rose gardens.

* '''Aker Stadium.''' One of Norway’s most modern football stadiums, seating 11 200. The stadium is situated on the waterfront to the west of the town centre and is designed by the Molde architect Kjell Kosberg. It has a granite and glass frontage. The stadium was paid for by Kjell Inge Røkke and Bjørn Rune Gjelsten and cost 212 million Norwegian kroner in 1998.

* '''Molde Cruise Ship Harbour.''' Molde has long been a port of call for cruise ships, and the town was one of the main attractions when the first cruise ship with paying passengers visited Norway in 1882. Every summer, 40-50 cruise ships call at Molde Harbour.

* '''The Royal Birch and the Peace Grove.''' The place where King Haakon and Crown Prince Olav sought shelter from German bombers in April 1940 when they were being hunted by the German occupying forces. The Peace Grove next to the Royal Birch was founded by Knut Ødegård, president of the Bjørnson Festival in 1997. It symbolises the continuing struggle for freedom, peace and human dignity both today and in the future. 

* '''Moldemarka hiking area.''' The area to the north of Molde, Moldemarka, is a great walking/skiing area all year round with its network of paths, walking trails and skiing tracks. Several of the forest roads take you into wilderness areas where there are information boards with maps at many of the starting points, as well as signposts along the trails. In winter there are approx. 10 km of prepared skiing tracks and a good 7 km of these are floodlit. Outside the skiing season, the “classic” walk is the Gamle Vardeveg road from the Romsdal Museum via the Storlihytta cabin to Varden (407 m.a.s.). It takes about one hour to reach the top, where in summer you can buy refreshments at the Vardestua restaurant. The eastern part of Moldemarka is easily accessible from the car park at Jensgurulia in Nordbyen. To the west, we recommend the Meekdalen valley and the Kringstadsetra summer pasture farm, while further inland you can walk up to Frænavarden (588 m.a.s.) and Valltua (586 m.a.s.). There are many breathtaking views. Walking maps for Molde and Fræna can be bought in bookshops and at the tourist office.

* '''Excursions'''

'''The fairytale world of Skaret.''' Skaret is located only ten minutes by car from Molde on RV64. The area is an excellent starting point for those who want to experience nature, culture and handwork traditions. At Skaret you will find old buildings, Norwegian food traditions, handwork, candle factory and activities. In short, the whole place is an adventure. Here, everything is served, from simple home fare to local specialities and abounding feast tables in romantic, rustic surroundings. You will find authentic, handcrafted items including rose-painted artefacts, ceramics, woven articles, clothing, knitware, silverware and plenty of local farm food in the sales exhibits. Skaret also offers an incredible selection of decorative candles from Løiten Lys, the largest producer of handmade candles in Norway. The candlemaking workshop ranges over 3 floors and is one of the most unusual shops in the district. Here you can see how candles are made, tinted and creatively decorated. At Skaret you can visit horses, goats, wild sheep and rabbits throughout the summer. Pony-riding and horse-drawn carriage/sleigh ride can be booked all year. There is also a children’s playground, and an open-air pool which is open during the Norwegian school holiday. The area is an excellent starting point for experiencing the countryside, including nature trails, walking trails, running trails and many fishing lakes.

'''Bud and the Atlantic Road.''' 
Within an hours driving from Molde, you can visit the idylic fishing village of Bud and the famous Atlantic Road, voted the worlds nicest road by ”The Guardian”. The road zigzags across bridges and rock-fills from island to island right out at the ocean’s edge. It is easy to park your car in one of the many lay-bys and walk a few metres to the smooth coastal rocks and some excellent fishing spots. A stone’s throw or two to the west, the shipping lane crosses the notorious waters of the Hustadvika bay, concealing innumerable wrecks. Many people take a trip out here when the autumn storms start to rage. It is quite a sight when the big waves break beside (and sometimes across) the road! The road workers experienced 12 hurricanes during the construction of the Atlantic Road before it was opened in 1989. Around 1900 as many as 120 people lived on these windswept islands. In 2006 the Atlantic Road was voted Norwegian Structure of the Century.

'''The Trollstigen Road.''' Trollstigen, “The Troll Ladder”, is the most visited tourist road in Norway, and is located approx. 65 km outside of Molde. The road twists through 11 hairpin bends as it climbs the steep mountain sides up to Stigrøra (858 m.a.s.). In some places it is cut into the mountain, in others it is built on top of stone walls. An impressive bridge in natural stone carries it across the Stigfossen waterfall. There are several ways to experience this splendour on foot. Try the old Kløvstien path over Trollstigen, which has existed for several hundred years, or the route from Trollstigen over to the Trolltindene peaks. The road is closed during winter and is usually opened at the end of May.

'''Island hopping on two wheels.''' This cycling tour starts in Molde and proceeds westwards to the island municipalities of Midsund, Sandøy and Aukra. Between the many islands you can relax on ferries or express boats. The tour continues on the mainland to the fishing village of Bud, across small islands and skerries along the Atlantic Road, and ends with the ferry trip from Averøy to Kristiansund. Take the “Hurtigruten” (express coastal service) back to Molde or northwards to Trondheim. Some parts of the cycling tour take you across flat islands right at the ocean’s edge, with views of the high mountains on the mainland. There is very little traffic on many stretches, but a complete range of services. En route there are also lots of lovely detours you can take if you want to see more of the area. The route, which totals 200 km, is cycled in stages with overnight stops along the way. Along the route you will pass a multitude of campsites, cabins, seahouses and attractive places to eat. Cycle guide with detailed maps, tour descriptions and interesting detours is available at the tourist office in Molde.

* '''Activities and extreme sports'''

'''Diving at Hustadvika.''' With its multitude of wrecks and its rich animal- and plant life, the Hustadvika bay is a diver’s paradise. Underwater visibility of 40 to 60 metres is not unusual in the winter, and there is good visibility during the rest of the year too. Diving equipment hire, organised guided boat trips, diving courses and air fills, are offered at the Atlantic Road.

'''Surfing at Hustadvika.''' Wind surfers dreaming of large waves and plenty of wind can realise their dreams at Hustadvika, which is renowned for its "wild nature”. Here, days where the sea is calm are rare.

'''Sea rafting.''' Sea rafting trip in a rubber boat, wearing a survival suit, among the innumerable small islands and skerries. High speed and thrills combined with an experience of coastal scenery at close quarters. The trip provides opportunities for forays ashore, barbecues, bathing and seashore discovery expeditions. 

'''Sea angling.''' The island municipalities of Aukra, Midsund and Sandøy are excellent starting points for sea angling trips on boats that are built for the open sea. With a strong, short rod, long line and heavy jigs you can catch cod, wolf fish, cusk, ling, saithe, halibut and various kinds of shark. On the landward side of the islands and in the fjords it is possible to fish from ordinary pleasure craft. Along the whole coast there are many good spots for angling from shore with rods, line and lures.

'''Hunting and fishing.''' It is permitted to use most types of fishing equipment in the mountains. Many people use otter boards for fishing in mountain lakes, but most prefer to use a rod. The tackle should be light, with a line that is preferably not much thicker than 0.25 mm and small hooks. Small spinners and spoons also work well. Some mountain lakes are ideal for fly-fishing. The best salmon rivers are Aura in Eikesdalen, Batnfjordselva in Batnfjorden, Eira in Eresfjorden, Hustadelva at Hustad, Malmeelva in Malmefjorden, Moaelva in Sylteosen, Måna in Måndalen, Oselva in Kleiveosen, Rauma in Romsdalen, Tressa in Tresfjorden and Visa in Vistdalen. Sea trout migrate up the Oselva river, and freshwater trout can be fished in the Visa, Moaelva and Hustadelva rivers. Lesja is a unique area for those interested in hunting or fishing. There are over 300 mountain lakes, many of them teeming with fish. A state fishing licence is required and can be purchased at any post office. Fishing permits can be bought locally near the rivers. Annual hunting season for wild reindeer, moose and small game, especially grouse.

'''Horses and riding.''' Vestnes has one of the largest Icelandic pony herds in Norway, and there are several enterprises with holiday- and activity offers. Icelandic pony-riding holidays lasting several daya are available, as well as hour long- and day trips. 

'''Eikrem Golf Course.''' By Henden Farm, 5 km east of Molde town centre, you will find Eikrem Golf Course with a panoramic view over the fjord and the mountains. Full 9-hole course, par 72, 5470 m. Driving range, putting green, three par-3 practice holes, PGA-pro, pro shop and club- and buggy hire. Open May-October.

'''Åndalsnes Golf Course.''' This hilly 9-hole course lies in beautiful surroundings at Setnesmoen near Åndalsnes. Not many are aware that this was where golf started in Norway. The English salmon lords held golf tournaments in Åndalsnes as early as 1905, on the site of the current golf course. Open May-Oct.

'''Ski and snowboard.''' Bjorli is renowned for its long winters with guaranteed snow. Bjorli has expanded its lift capacity with a 6-seat express chairlift. Beside the chairlift, there are three ski lifts and two childrens’ lifts. The mountain also features a 3,5 km green slope. The centre has a total of 20 km of downhill runs, with a total altitude difference of 650 m. Bjorli is a centre that suits everyone: Families with small children, carving enthusiasts and those who want to go off-piste. Bjorli also has approx. 90 km of prepared and marked cross-country tracks in both mountain- and woodland terrain. 

Tusten Skiheiser is a 10 minute drive from Molde town centre. The alpine skiing centre is built around 3 lifts, and offers up to 20 km of prepared pistes, 3 km of which are floodlit.

'''Base jumping.''' The mountains of the Romsdalen and Eikesdalen valleys are some of the best places in the world for base jumping. Kalskråtinden, Gridsetskolten and Unionsveggen are popular exit points in Romsdalen. In Eikesdalen, we recommend Strandkolvet (Katthammaren), Aurstupet and Vikesaksa. In Julsundet, 10 km west of Molde, you can jump from Ravnfloget. Base jumping from the Trollveggen wall is prohibited. All base jumping in the region is at own risk.

'''Mountaineering and peak climbing.''' In summer you can choose between climbing, abseiling and peak climbing. Romsdalshorn, Vengetind and Juratind are the most popular peaks for climbing. The ascent of the Litlefjellet mountain, continuing up the north wall of Romsdalshorn is the most usual, with climbing the last 300 metres.
