'''Dunhuang''' (敦煌; ''Dūnhuáng'') is a city on the old [[Silk Road]]. It is in [[Gansu]] Province in north west [[China]].

==Understand==
[[Image:Climbing Sand Dunes.jpg|thumb|350px]]
The city was founded by Emperor Wudi of the Han dynasty in 111 BC  at the cross roads of two trading routes on the [[Silk Road]], and the name 'Dunhuang', meaning to 'to flourish and prosper,' gives some indication of the town's prominence in ancient [[China]]. It is much less important today.

The city is a neat small sizes city centred around a statue and the lovely market.

==Get in==

===By plane===
'''Dunhuang Airport (IATA: DNH)''' is 13km east of town center. Flights are available to [[Beijing]], [[Lanzhou]], [[Urumqi]], and [[Xian]]. There is now a taxi stand at this airport (Sept 2013). Taxis do not run on meters and the charge is 50yuan for trip to city.
If you can get your hotel to pick you up, please do so. There can be shuttle busses which arrive when planes come, but these can be full, resulting in a long wait (1 hour) for a vehicle if you're not prepared.

The airport and train station are just 10 mins walk away. So one can take walk to the train station to take the bus to the city.

===By train===
Dunhuang Train Station (敦煌火车站; ''Dūnhuáng Huǒchēzhàn'') is about 12km outside the town to the northeast.It a new well organised station with green buses meeting every train to shuttle passengers into town. Just come out the front and they will usher you into the next bus and for 3 yuan drop you opposite the Silk Road Hotel in town on the edge of the market.  There is also a ticket agent in town, near the mosque which sells tickets for most trains. You can always get the bus back to the railway station to buy your ticket if you are heading to the Caves as the Caves entrance is a walk from the station.  

Travel times and train numbers for departures from Dunhuang as of early 2008:
* [[Jiayuguan]] - #7528, departing at 16:10, arriving at 21:49; also departing at 04:48, arriving at 09:27                  
* [[Lanzhou]] - #N858, dep. 19:25, arr. 09:14
* [[Xian]] - #K592, dep. 09:39, arr. 09:26
* [[Yinchuan]] - #N854, dep. 14:30, arr. 08:2o

Please note: If you are heading west you will have to have to catch a bus to Liuyuan as DUNGHUANG is a branch off the main line and you would have to backtrack and change trains. Buses leave for Liuyuan to connect to each train. They leave from the bus station 5 mins down the road from the Silk Road Hotel (where the Dunghuang Train Station shuttle buses drop you). The trip takes 2 hrs and cost 36Y . There is not much at Liuyuan.
* (Turfan)K2629 Sleeper Departing 2155 Liuyuan Arriving Turfan 0700(April 2016)


The Dunhuang train station is pretty quiet as mentioned it is the end of a branch line and most trains stop at Liuyuan (柳园), a couple of hours away from the city. From Liuyuan station, small buses leave to Dunhuang for 35Yuan. There are no set times for these buses as they leave when fully seated. If leaving in the morning, it is advisable to arrive at the station slightly before 10am, as many people will arrive at the station around this time so waiting time for the bus to leave will be short. If one has to spend the night in Liuyuan, the New Liuyuan Hotel (新柳源宾馆）at a 10 minute walk from the station will accept foreigners (as of June 2019, a standard two bedroom costs 138Y and a three person room costs 180Y).

===By bus===
From 2015 most buses leave from the main bus station -walk out 5 mins away from the market past the Silk Road Hotel (where the Train Station and bus to the Caves Depart).

* [[Golmud]] - takes about 15 hours
* [[Hami]]  - takes about 6 hours （daily 8:30,14:00 81 Yuan Apr 2013)
* [[Jiayuguan]] - takes about 4-8 hours
* [[Lanzhou]] - takes about 17-24 hours
* [[Liuyuan]] - takes about 3 hours
* [[Xining]]  - takes about 20 hours
* [[Zhangye]] - takes about 13 hours

As of 2015 there is no overnight bus heading to Turfan. You will have to take a Western train option. Taxis do not seem to make this 13 hour run.

The Visitors center and entrance is on the main road (almost opposite the train station), whilst the actual caves are afurther 13 km in on a shuttle bus as part of your admission. You must join a tour group as the caves are locked and only the tour guides have keys.English tours at 9AM, 12AM and 2PM daily (2:30PM in low season). If you can't get a tour in the right language you will need to tag on to one of the Chinese tours. " price="Mogao tickets are 240 yuan for foreigners (Sept 2014; no discounts available; tours in English at 9:00, 12:00, and 2:00), 160 for Chinese nationals, and 80 for Chinese students. Tickets are 120 yuan in in low season for the english tour and 100 yuan for the Chinese tour (March 2016). Tickets include access to 2 movies and a shuttle bus to the cave site. The first movie explains the history of the site on the silk road while the second is a very impressive 3D movie of some of the caves which are off limits to tourists. ">A [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] filled with exquisite Buddhist art and manuscripts.  Although the city had an early connection with Buddhism due to the passage of monks traveling the Silk Road, it was not until a monk had a vision of a thousand Buddhas above the desert at Dunhuang in 4th century that the famous caves were excavated and filled with the manuscripts and treasures.The tour takes about two hours and 12 caves will be visited , all the rest are closed. The tours are different from group to group with every group visiting the main caves. The number of visitors is  limited to 6000 a day and advanced booking needed in peak seasons. You can arrange to visit closed caves, It will cost you &yen;200 per person and per cave. Note that It can be handy to bring your torch. Worth  a visit even if you don't pay the steep entrance fee and tour the caves, as the museum is free to enter and contains replicas of several caves, and there are a few small temples you can easily hike to in the nearby hills. <br> For information, during the cultural revolution the Buddha and some painting was destroyed. Main painting of the cave was restored around 1995. Well, restored, but restored! As of Jan 2014, the 35 meter tall Buddha statue is again open to the public after a lengthy restoration. 
On-site tickets can only be purchased from the Visitor Centre (8km from Dunhuang city centre on the main road to the train station), it is not possible to buy a ticket without the additional access to the movies/bus and there is no operational ticket office at the cave site itself. From July 2015, you have the option to buy your ticket on the website of "Dunhuang Research Academy" (http://public.dha.ac.cn/index.html). Here (http://www.mgk.org.cn/) you can book the tickets but only for chinese speakers. </see>

Not recommended.  June 2018 update: East of the park about 2 km there's a cemetery.  From there you can circumvent the fence and access the dunes.

==Stay Safe==

==Get out==
'''[[Silk Road]]''' - The route between [[Dunhuang]] and [[Cherchen]] ([[Qiemo]]) is probably the hardest to do in all of the Silk Road travels since public transit is complicated between the two points.  

One leg of the trip is often closed due to washouts in the river canyon or landslides in the mountains, and is closed to most traffic in the winter. Be sure to ask, before you leave Dunhuang, whether the road between [[Shimiankuang]] and [[Charklik]] ([[Ruoqiang]]) is open. 

Regular buses run daily each morning from [[Dunhuang]], [[Gansu Province]], 731 km to [[Huatugou]] (花土沟), a small oil drilling town in northwest [[Qinghai Province]], and daily each morning the other direction.  This road, a paved highway the entire way, crosses the [[Altun Mountains]] over Dangjin Pass (当金山口, 3680 m, 39º19'14"N, 94º16'11"E) at the provincial border between [[Qinghai]] and [[Gansu]] which runs along the crest of the Altun Mountains. One source says that the road rises from 1000 m to the 3680 m pass in just 20 kilometers.  This road is subject to delays or closure in winter due to icy conditions.

*April 2011- the bus station in Dunhuang will not sell you a ticket to Huatugou unless you have an ATP,  You cant get this permit in Dunhuang because its in Gansu province. so you have to go to the PSB in [[golmud]], and from there to take the bus to Huatugou

Twice daily minibuses run the 65 km in 1.5-2 hours for Y15 between [[Huatugou]] and [[Shimiankuang]] (石绵矿 literally: asbestos mine), a tiny worker hamlet north of a large surface-level asbestos mine.  It's better to stay overnight in Huatugou than in the very basic lodging at the asbestos mine.  Ask the Huatugou taxi driver for the Petroleum Guesthouse -- 石油 shí yóu 宾馆 bīn guǎn.  There's also very basic lodging across from the Huatugou bus station -- ask the bus driver to point you in the right direction.

Some maps do not show [[Huatugou]] (38°08'60"N, 90°52'00"E, 2,859 m) and instead show [[Youshashan]], about 5-10 km southwest.  If neither town is shown, Huatugou is just northeast of Gaz Hure Hu lake.  Some maps do not show [[Shimiankuang]] (38°15'00"N, 90°52'00"E, 3,200 m) and instead show the small oil refinery village of [[Mangnai Zhen]], about 10 km southeast.  If neither town is shown, [[Shimiankuang]] is right where Highway 315 crosses the provincial border.  Older maps show Shimiankuang and Mangnai Zhen in Xinjiang Province, but the area was moved administratively some years ago into Qinghai Province.

The 241 km road from [[Shimiankuang]], at the border of [[Qinghai]] and [[Xinjiang]], to [[Charklik]] ([[Ruoqiang]]), [[Xinjiang]], is a rough road,  over a 4,000 m pass and through a narrow river valley as well as across the desert.  This is the rough leg mentioned above.  
April 2011 - the road is now paved all the way. a minibus leaves from Shimiankuangs "bus station" to Charklik at 11:00 , costs 80Y. 

The minibus leaves from in front of the bus station in [[Charklik]] ([[Ruoqiang]]) at 08:00 Beijing time (06:00 unofficial local time) and arrives in [[Shimiankuang]] about 6 hours later, and generally in time to catch the afternoon minibus from [[Shimiankuang]] to [[Huatugou]].  The 09:00 morning minibus from Huatugou meets the minibus leaving from Shimiankuang about 11:00.  
 
From [[Charklik]] ([[Ruoqiang]]) to [[Cherchen]] ([[Qiemo]]), the bus leaves at 10:00, takes 5 hours to cover the 351 km and costs 58Y.  In the other direction, a daily bus leaves [[Cherchen]] ([[Qiemo]]) for [[Charklik]] ([[Ruoqiang]]) at 10:00.  

There as buses to Delingha, but be carefull, the city is not open to tourists.

'''[[Beijing]]''' - Although there are direct flights from Dunhuang to [[Beijing]], they aren't cheap and are booked pretty quickly. A cheaper and less competitive alternative is to look for flight to [[Urumqi]] then from [[Urumqi]] to [[Beijing]] as this route can save you almost half the price of direct flights to [[Beijing]].
