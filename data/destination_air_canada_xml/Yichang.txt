'''Yichang''' (宜昌; ''Yíchāng'') is a city in [[Hubei]] Province.

==Understand==
[[Image:Yichang.jpg|350px|thumb|Yichang, Yangtze river view.]]
The population of Yichang is around 4 million. However, the city itself contains an estimated 1 and a half million, with over half the population in the outside areas.  The city is located just below the Three Gorges around 30 km downstream of the dam. It used to be the gateway to the upper Yangze and an important post in the Sino-Japanese war, though not much of those times is visible anymore.  Nowadays the city is known as the ending point of the ''Three Gorges'' river cruising trip and is less often used for a trip upstream.

==Get in==

===By plane===
There is an airport-Three Gorges Airport in Yichang, located 40min driving out of the city. There are flights going to/from Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Wuhan, Xi'an, etc. Taxi prices to the airport vary from 60-80, there is also a bus going out there, find out in city when and from where it leaves.The airport shuttle buses run from the time when the first flight comes and stop till the last flight leaves. Its terminal is Qingjiang Hotel of Yichang City, which is about 40 kilometers away from the airport. It takes around 50 minutes to get there from the airport with the ticket price of 20 Yuan. It stops at bus stations and wharfs on the way. The airport shuttle buses run from the time when the first flight comes and stop till the last flight leaves.

===By bus===
Yichang can easily be reached by bus.  There is a main bus station, where there are buses from/to main cities in China.  There are further bus stations at the docks where the river cruises end/start.

===By train===

Train is also a very easy way to get to Yichang.  The old, train station is in the city centre.  Many trains now, however, stop at Yichang East station that is about 10km from the city station.  You can take bus 1 further into the town and then change to bus 23 (these routes should parallel for a while) and then ride to its terminus (Yemingzhu) from which a non-city bus (number 8) goes to the three gorges dam.

Only slow train connections run from Zhangjiajie to Yichang. This train takes about 5 hours. 

Speed trains run from Yichang onwards to [[Enshi]] (2 hours) and continue to [[Chengdu]] (7.5 hours).

===By boat/cruise===
Many people get in by boat.  Most boats arrive around 1-1.30pm at the docks from where it is possible to catch a bus to Wuhan the same night which for most people might be the most interesting option of getting out. There are also many Yangtze Cruises sailing on the Yangtze River between Chongqing and Yichang (see Do Section).

==Get around==
The buses within Yichang generally cost ¥2. At present (July 2016) the entire system is being overhauled and is a bit of a mess. There are 3 different types of bus: B, K and minibuses. B buses theoretically have at least one interchange with the new BRT special bus lane, which runs from Yichang East Station to the CBD via Dongzhan Avenue. K buses are city buses which do not have interchanges with the BRT (although the letter K is omitted from bus stop timetables) and any others are minibuses. The BRT stations are very visible and each display a map (a luxury for bus routes in China) by the entrance, however some routes (e.g. B34 and B100) bear no resemblance to the routes displayed on the map, some buses do not stop at certain stations even if marked on the map and all the routes end short of the north/west terminus. Do not use Google Maps to attempt to use the bus routes, as all of the information predates the current lettering system. If you want to go to the Three Visitors Cave take bus 10 leaving at the main Square (hourly or half hourly). A taxi ride out there is ¥10-20.

Taxi fares begin at ¥6 and then increase in small amounts over time and distance. Taxis may or may not use the meter, if you stay in the downtown limits, rides should not exceed ¥10.
