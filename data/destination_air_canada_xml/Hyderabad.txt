'''Hyderabad''' is the capital of [[Telangana]] in [[Southern India]], located on the banks of the Musi River and on the Deccan Plateau. Hyderabad and [[Secunderabad]] are "twin cities" near Hussain Sagar Lake (also known as ''Tank Bund'' in local parlance) but both cities have grown so much that now they have become one big metropolis. The city and district of Hyderabad are coterminous. Hyderabad district is entirely contained within the Ranga Reddy district of Telangana. Many of the suburbs of Hyderabad were recently merged into the city, now called Greater Hyderabad.

A city rich with history and tradition, Hyderabad now competes with [[Bangalore]] and [[Chennai]] for the crown of India's IT capital; Microsoft, Amazon and Google have their India headquarters here.

Many visitors never make it past the attractions in Old City, but you haven't truly seen Hyderabad until you have ventured out into the neighborhoods. The city is split into north, west, east and south of the central district. There are differences in culture visible  throughout the city.

==Understand==

If you are traveling to Hyderabad on business &mdash; as is increasingly the case now &mdash; it is easy to miss the 400-year-old Hyderabad. The city that immediately hits the eye is a sprawling metropolis of shopping malls and office buildings with glass facades. The whole of the city seems to be under construction or renovation and the roads are jammed because flyovers are being constructed. It is a magnificent city in many senses.

The "old city" that was once the seat of the Nizam, the ruler of the largest and the most opulent "princely state", and the twin city of Secunderabad where the British maintained a cantonment to keep the army within striking distance of the Nizam can be seen only if you take the time out to see them. 

Hyderabad's many epithets include the '''City of Pearls''', the '''City of Nawabs''', the '''Biryani City''' and, because of its high-tech draw, '''Cyberabad'''.

===History===

[[image:golconda-1.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Golconda Fort]]
In 1463 '''Quli Qutb-ul-Mulk''' established the fortress of Golconda about 8 km to the west of Hyderabad’s present day old city. He had quelled rebellion in the Telangana region and was appointed the ''subedar'', or administrator of the region as a result. By 1518, he had become independent from the Bahmani sultan, declared himself the Sultan under the name of '''Quli Qutb Shah''' and established the '''Qutb Shahi dynasty'''. In 1589, '''Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah''', a grandson of Quli Qutb Shah, made the decision to move his capital from the Golconda fort to the present day location of Hyderabad due to water shortages at the old location. In 1591, he ordered the construction of the Charminar, reportedly in gratitude to Allah for cutting short a plague epidemic before it could do too much damage. 

The name "Hyderabad" reportedly had kept in honour of 4th Calipha Hazrat Ali A.S. Hyder means Lion, it is one of the Title of Hazrat Ali A.S., he named the city Hyderabad. Hyderabad was built on a '''grid plan''' with help from Iranian architects. French traveler Jean-Baptiste Tavernier favorably compared Hyderabad to Orleans. 

The Qutb Shahi dynasty lasted till 1687, when the Mughal emperor '''Aurangzeb''' defeated the sultanate and took over Hyderabad. He appointed his governor as ruler of the region and granted him the title of Nizam-ul-Mulk. However, Mughal rule was short-lived and in 1724, the Nizam '''Asaf Jah I''' gained independence from a declining Mughal empire. Legend has it that while on a hunting expedition, he met a holy man who offered him some ''kulchas'' and asked him to eat as much as he could. Asaf Jah ate only seven, and the holy man prophesied that his dynasty would last for seven generations. Sure enough, the seventh ruler in the dynasty was the last. In honour of the legend, the flag of the Nizams featured a ''kulcha''. 

Around 1763, Asif Jah II, defeated by the Marathas and threatened by Tipu Sultan of [[Mysore]], entered into a '''subsidiary alliance''' with a British. Hyderabad state became a "princely state", protected by, and under the overlordship of the British. The British maintained their army in nearby Secunderabad to protect the Nizam and to ensure that he did not do any mischief. Hyderabad state was the richest in the country and in the 1930s Time magazine rated the Nizam the richest man in the world. In 1947, with India's independence, the seventh Nizam was reluctant to cede his principality to the newly independent India, preferring Pakistan instead. India sent in its troops and the 200 year old prophesy was fulfilled. On September 17th 1948, it was merged in to India. Hyderabad become the capital city of Hyderabad state till November 1st 1956. After forced merger of hyderabad state with Andhra state and formed new linguistic state Andhra Pradesh on Nov 1st 1956. Thus, Hyderabad became the capital of the newly formed state of Andhra Pradesh. The new capital's administrative buildings were located around '''Hussain Sagar Lake''', approximately between Secunderabad and the "old city", as the Nizam's city came to be called.  

In 1995, Chandrababu Naidu became chief minister of Andhra Pradesh. Among his key policies was a major initiative to turn the city into an IT hub. He cleaned up the streets, laid out IT parks and did much to attract technology companies into the city. Today, as Bangalore’s infrastructure is choked by the city’s rapid growth, Hyderabad's well-laid out streets are proving to be a major attraction for software and IT-enabled companies. The technology enclave of Madhapur has actually been officially named '''Hi tec''' city, and "Cyberabad" is commonly used as an alternative name to Hyderabad. 

In 2007, the suburbs of Hyderabad were merged with the city to form '''Greater Hyderabad'''. In 2009, the longstanding demand to have [[Telangana]] created as a separate state came to boil, with low intensity agitations and disturbances shaking up Hyderabad. While the traveller need not worry much (see the "Stay safe" section for more) it does call into question Hyderabad's future status, as Telangana includes Hyderabad city.

===Orientation===

The best way to orient yourself to Hyderabad is to think with reference to two water bodies - the '''Musi river''' and the '''Hussain Sagar Lake'''. The Musi river flows from the west to the east, a few kilometers south of Hussain Sagar Lake. 

* The '''Old city''' lies mostly on the south bank of the Musi, though this guide will treat the '''Golkonda''', which lies on the north bank, as part of the old city. Most historical attractions, including the Charminar lie on this bank. 

[[Image:OldCity Hyderabad.png|thumb|Map of Old City,Hyderabad]]

* '''Secunderabad'''  lies to the north-east of Hussain Sagar lake. This has historically been a military cantonment, which means that the roads are better maintained and broader. It has nice parks, open spaces and some excellent restaurants. 

* The '''New city''', which contains the administrative offices of Andhra Pradesh lies on the north bank of the Musi, to the east and south-east of Hussain Sagar. 

*'''Punjagutta to Gachibowli'''  is a vast region to the west and north-west of Hussain Sagar, on the north bank of the Musi. This has developed in the past twenty years. Areas of interest here are Punjagutta and Ameerpet, which are enormous shopping areas. Banjara Hills and Jubilee Hills is where Hyderabad's swish set lives, and contain some good parks and restaurants.  The newly developed "Hi tec city" and Gachibowli are 9 km to the west of the new city.  This is where most technology and business process outsourcing (BPO) firms have their campuses.

===Culture and attitudes===

In many senses, Hyderabad is the meeting ground between North and South India. The city has a culture that is distinct from the rest of Andhra Pradesh, showing Islamic influences and a courtly presence imparted from its period as the capital of the Nizamate. This is more evident in the old city. The new city resembles many provincial state capitals in India. Secunderabad is more cosmopolitan, as the Cantonment area is located in this part of the city. 

Due to a recent influx of young men and women from various parts of the country for better job opportunities, Hyderabad's culture and attitudes have taken a turn towards "modernity". However, it is good to keep in mind that the city is still a deeply conservative place and to dress appropriately, especially in the old city.

Note that people have a very indifferent attitude towards time and a very laid back attitude.

===Climate===

Like many Indian cities Hyderabad has a tropical climate. The best time to visit the city is from mid-November to mid-February.Temperatures are mild with abundant sunshine during this time and average temperature range from a low of 15°C (59°F) to a high of 29°C (85°F). 
March to June is hot and dry with occasional thunderstorms. Highs can reach 45°C (113°F) or more and lack of air-conditioning can make it feel very uncomfortable. July, August, September and October can be quite warm and humid and low pressure systems from the Bay of Bengal during the monsoon season can cause heavy rain for days.

==Talk==

[[Telugu phrasebook|Telugu]] (the state language of Telangana and one of India's six living classical languages) and [[Urdu phrasebook|Urdu]] are widely spoken in Hyderabad, and most educated people speak Telugu, Urdu, Hindi and/or English. 

English signs are common. 

The city is one of the main places where Urdu developed, and the dialect spoken primarily by the large Muslim population is known as “Deccani Urdu” or Dakhani Urdu” (which both translate to Urdu of the Deccan). Because of the influence of Urdu, a dialect of [[Hindi phrasebook|Hindi]] is also spoken in the city and your Hindi phrasebook may still be useful.

==Get in==
Hyderabad is well connected to all parts of the country by air, rail, and road.

===By plane===
Hyderabad's '''Rajiv Gandhi International Airport''' ({{IATA|HYD}}) [https://www.hyderabad.aero/flight-information.aspx] is located 22 km (14 mi) from the city. Note that the old airport at Begumpet is now closed, except for use by VIPs. The sleek and well-organized airport is one of the best aviation facilities in India. The elevated expressway to the airport is now open and takes 20 minutes. Direct international connectivity from Hyderabad is available for many countries. International carriers operating from Hyderabad are Air India, British Airways, Emirates, Malaysia Airlines, Air Asia,  Oman Air, Qatar Airways, Saudi Arabian Airlines, Silk Air, Etihad Airways, Cathay Pacific, and Thai Airways.

Domestic connectivity is excellent with Indian airlines operating from here including Air India, Air India Express, Indian Airlines, Indigo Airlines, Trujet, and SpiceJet.

Once you arrive at Hyderabad airport, one option is to take the air-conditioned buses run by the airport (Pushpak) to various designated points in the city such as (1) Begumpet (Paryatak Bhavan) (2) Secunderabad (Keyes High School) (3) Hi-Tec City (Opposite Shilparamam), and two designated points in the city (4) Charminar (City College) (5) Mehdipatnam (Sarojini Devi Eye Hospital). The buses have a frequency of a bus every 30 min from 3:30AM-11PM and every hour at midnight, 1AM, 2AM and 3AM and travel time varies from 45 mins to 2 hrs depending on the time of the day and traffic conditions. You can reach the designated points and then take an auto or metered cab from there. 

Alternatively, you can hire metered air-conditioned radio cabs starting from Rs 40 for the first 2 km (see Get around section) '''Skycabs''' and '''Meru''' are approved by the airport @ 21 Rs/km and are available just after exiting the terminal building. For the rest, you need to call and book with a lead time of 15 minutes to 1 hour. These cabs charge a 25% surcharge at the night (ie, Rs 26.25 per km between 2300 hours and 0500 hours). Hyderabad traffic police counter is on the ground floor with prepaid taxis. Beware of taxi soliciting tours at the airport greeting area; they might try to scam you into exorbitant rates (especially so in case of non-locals) The Hyderabad Traffic Police has partnered with the Airport authorities to run a counter for prepaid taxis. This is a safe option with all taxis being registered with the police. The police also run a SHE cab service now, especially for women travelers, with female drivers and safety equipment such as a GPS connected to the Police Control Room. One can also hire a cab from many app-based services such as Uber or Ola, whose fares are available on the apps and on their websites (Please keep in mind that while these services are substantially cheaper than the radio cabs, they will charge Rs. 200 in addition to the fare as parking charges levied on them by the airport). This option is the best while traveling to the airport, as the parking charges do not apply for departures. (added new initiatives)

Hired cars are also available from a booth just before walking outside of the airport.  This gives you the advantage of paying in advance, thereby avoiding any disagreements over price. The airport can be contacted on their (toll-free for BSNL/MTNL subscribers) number 1 800 419-2008 for all services and inquiries including arrivals/departure information, facilities, transport availability, etc.

===By train===
Indian Railways [https://enquiry.indianrail.gov.in/mntes/] has service to Hyderabad from all over India. 

There are three major railway stations serving the twin cities: Secunderabad, Hyderabad, and Kachiguda, and a minor station at Begumpet. Most of the trains bound for South India and North India originate from Hyderabad and leave via Secunderabad. Hyderabad Deccan Station is popularly known as '''Nampally Station'''. Find all trains to Hyderabad[http://trainspy.com/static/station/(SC)SECUNDERABAD-JN].

===By car===

Hyderabad is well connected to other major Metros by road. [[Bangalore]] is connected by NH7 and is at a distance of 560 km. The city is 752 km from [[Chennai]] (using highways NH9 and NH5) and 800 km from [[Mumbai]] (NH9 till Pune and the expressway to Mumbai.) The BangaloNorth-South section is part of the North-South corridor which is being upgraded to a four-lane divided highway. Hyderabad is also known as the Hub of Business.

===By bus===

Hyderabad is well-connected to all parts of the Telangana and most parts of South and Western India. Both state government and private buses operate a large number of luxury and ordinary services across the state and neighboring states.

*'''JBS''', (''Jubilee Bus station''), is in Secunderabad. TSRTC runs direct A/C coaches to Mumbai, Bangalore, and Chennai. Telangana tourism runs A/C coaches to, Mumbai, Chennai, and Bengaluru. You have to book the tickets in advance. There are many online bus ticketing portals to book bus tickets. Mybustickets is one such portal.

* '''MGBS or Imliban''', is said to be the largest bus station in the world with around 84 bus bays side by side. TSRTC has pickup and drops points from various points in the city. In addition, government-run bus services of neighboring states also run buses to Hyderabad, as do various private companies.

* '''Private Buses'''. South India is largely well served by organized private bus operators. They run luxury buses like Volvo, Mercedes, and Kinglong Cerita buses including multi-axle buses. These are air-conditioned, semi-sleeper, or sleeper services with online ticket booking facilities. Important private travel hubs are KPHB Colony, Lakdi-Ka-Pool, Paradise center in Secunderabad, and Dilsukh Nagar. Luxury services run to many cities from these places. Non-metropolitan areas and towns are often connected by non-A/C buses but are still provided with comfortable seating.

It may be difficult to find direct buses from North India due to the large size of that part of the country.

==Get around==
[[Image:200px-Hyd Auto.jpg|300px|thumb|Autorickshaw/Auto]]

There are many ways to get around in Hyderabad. It has good metro and bus service, good autorickshaw service (although they never charge by meter and always overprice, making cabs cheaper) and well-developed Radio taxi services as well as new app-based services such as Uber and Ola. There is a local train service too, but it is grossly inadequate and unreliable. It is advisable that travelers using smartphones download the Hyderabad Police and Hyderabad Traffic Police apps from the app store, as these have some safety features such as an SOS button to the control room, as well as options to lodge complaints. 

===By bus===

Hyderabad has good local bus connectivity and is run by '''TSRTC''' [http://www.tsrtconline.in], a state-government owned corporation. Most intercity buses start and end at the Mahatma Gandhi Bus Terminus more commonly known as Imlibun, and there are numerous depots where city service buses start and end. One can use Google maps to plan travel by bus. There are five categories of buses (Ordinary, Metro Express, Metro Deluxe, AC, Volvo AC). The Volvo Buses are the most comfortable, with fares starting from Rs. 35. There are also monthly passes of Rs. 2100 that allows one to travel anywhere any number of times by any service across the city). Other buses tend to get extremely overcrowded and traveling on the footboard of a bus is very common.

The routes displayed on buses are normally shown in at least two languages, one of which is English. The best way to get to a location by bus would be to get to a bus stop and ask people waiting there. You could also get on a bus going in your direction and ask the conductor for help.

===By autorickshaw===

'''Autorickshaws'''  in Hyderabad should be metered, though it can be difficult for non-locals and locals alike to find an autorickshaw driver who ever agrees to a metered fare. (This is especially true when hailing an auto in front of a 5-star hotel, near bus stands, railway stations and near Hi-Tech area.)  However, Traffic police are very helpful and will help engage an Auto with metered fare. Autos can carry a maximum of 3 passengers excluding the driver, but it is common to find them being overloaded to carry up to six passengers when one.  The minimum fare is Rs 20 which covers the first 1.6 km.  Each additional km is another Rs 11. The waiting charges are for Rs. 30 per hour. There are also shared 4 seaters and 8 seaters Maxi Vans available to and fro from the suburbs to the main location of the city in that direction. Fares are mostly 2 rupees more than bus fares but are far more comfortable and fast for short distances up to 5 km. Fix the fare before you step into the autorickshaw.

'''Auto Drivers in Hyderabad are a nightmare and are absolutely uncooperative'''. Finding a needle in a haystack is easier than finding an auto driver who agrees to go by the metered rate with a common excuse that their meter is not functioning. They always demand a much higher fare even though the fare has been increased from time to time. It is advised to keep extra change with you since most of the auto drivers will claim that they don't have change, even if they have. If you have a choice then always opt for a  Prepaid Cab. 

Reckless driving and accidents are very common here, as is the case with most cities in this part of the world.

'''Most of the auto drivers want you to check out pearls shop (which they claim are authorized by the Govt.) in exchange of less fare however they are okay if you don't buy anything from these shops, just sit there for 10 minutes'''. They are encouraged with incentives to bring customers into these shops. The pearl shops are notorious for persuasive sales tactics and they won't let you out easily. So pay the complete fare to auto drivers instead of being diverted to a pearl shop.

Auto drivers get some percent of the entry fees (around Rs. 10/-) if they take you to the places like Chowmoholla Palace or Salarjung museum for free. If you are around these areas get into some auto instead of walking down and ask them to drop you there.

Also in many parts of the city, it is easy to find a shared auto running, just reach the nearest bus stop and ask the locals for a shared auto, they should readily guide you. If u see an overloaded auto-rikshaw, it is a shared one and you just need to wave at the next less-populated one.

'''Auto Drivers in Hyderabad are especially reckless drivers. Better book a cab than take an Auto, even at a higher price, for the air-conditioned comfort and protection from pollution, as well as for relief from the antics of the 'Auto wallahs''''.
There are exemplary auto drivers too, but unfortunately, the others outnumber them by far.

===By taxi===

It is best to use new app based cabs such as Ola and Uber, which assure service and courteous drivers. However, there have been cases of misbehavior by drivers (although few) and it is advised to use the Hyderabad Police app and enter the details of the cab you are getting into, to be safe. Fares for these start at Rs. 6 per km and Rs. 1 per minute of ride time. (Ola Micro). Availability is very good at busy locales, and most apps have tracking features as well as SOS features. Metered Radio taxis are available, but they cannot be hailed off the street. One needs to call their centralized call center and book the service. Service is very good, especially if you are looking for longer distances. It can be next to impossible to be able to get a Radio cab without prior booking since demand far outstrips the supply. All metered cabs have digital meters that show the distance and fare.

Operators offering metered taxis at Rs 10 per km (Most of them are now charging Rs 12 per km for an Indica, Rs 10 continues in case of Maruti Omni) with a minimum charge is Rs  80 in most cases. Many taxi services prefer not to book trips that are only a short distance.

It is preferred to use travel curators like Vayu Travels for customized itinerary planning and comfortable travel. 

However covering the entire city with so many sightseeing locations will be costly on a CAB, whereas hiring a Full Day Taxi / Car is suggested, which normally charge on 8 hrs or 80 km and 10 hrs 100 km basis. One can easily hire cabs for local tours in Hyderabad with some prominent car rental services which would normally cost around Rs 9/Km (along with Driver).

===By suburban train===
[[Image:Mmtshtc3of.jpg|300px|thumb|MMTS Local Train]]

Local trains called [http://www.mmtstrains.in/ MMTS] are available, albeit only for a few places Places in Hyderabad,  The frequency ranges from 10 to 30 minutes, except during day time and Sundays, when there are fewer trains. It is a fast way of travel to the few stations it covers, and the cheapest option as well. If you plan to travel through MMTS check out the schedule on the website [http://www.mmtstrains.in/ MMTS Train Timings],  [http://www.mmtstrains.in/2011/11/mmts-train-timings.html]. If you are foreign traveler it is advisable to take first class. General class tend to get overcrowded and you can never find a seat at intermediate stations. If you have to catch a train do not rely on the MMTS schedule, as it is rarely followed and usually late; Trains may also get cancelled without prior notice. Daily and monthly passes are also available at the MMTS stations.

===By metro===

The [https://hmrl.co.in/ metro] is a good choice when the network covers your desired route: It's air conditioned, clean, not smelling, offers a high perceived security standard, is less densely crowded than autos and busses, slightly cheaper than autos (e.g. 35Rs for 9.5km), is reliable in terms of not being affected by traffic jams as well as due to the new, modern hardware. The trains move at 50-75km/h while road-bound vehicles can usually not go faster than 25-50km/h at daytime. At each station there are two ticket counters accepting cash, usually with short queues, while for a longer stay, you may get a digital card/subscription. The network consists of 3 lines covering a distance of around 73 km but not reaching the outskirts of the city - just get off metro stations at bigger crossings where shared autos will wait till full and then start. Out of this network, a part of 30 km was thrown open to the public on the 29th of November 2017 and the entire first phase of 66.56 km with 57 station was due to be completed by December 2018. 

* Line 1 - Red Line - Miyapur – L B Nagar - 29.21 km (18.15 mi), of which the stretch Ameerpet to Miyapur (11km) are currently operational. 
* Line 2 - Green Line - Parade Grounds – MGBS - 15 km (9.3 mi), not operational as of 11/2019.
* Line 3 - Blue Line - Nagole – Raidurg - 29 km (18 mi), of which the eastern stretch Nagole to Ameerpet is operational as of 11/2019.

===By car===

Hyderabad lacks an expressway system, leading to traffic jams during rush hours. However, an 160 km Ring Road Expressway is currently under construction.

Driving is exciting in Hyderabad not unlike in the rest of India. You find cycles, motorcycles, rickshaws, hand carts, autos, share autos, mini trucks, buses, vestibule buses, double deckers, Volvos jostling along. There are long stretches of roads passing through thickly populated areas that have no median breaks, so vehicles, including motorbikes and cars, simply drive on the wrong side of the road. Several modern flyovers now link the arterial roads.

Several car rental agencies are available at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport as well in the following locations.

===By Tourist Bus===
The Telangana Tourism department runs a '''hop- on hop- off''' [http://www.telanganatourism.gov.in/hopon-hopoff/] bus service that takes one around the city.
 
===On foot===

Hyderabad's interesting districts are fairly spread out, but are enjoyable to explore by foot on their own. The Old City is composed of a maze of disorienting alleyways that expand outward from the Charminar. Getting lost in the markets (where you can buy anything from hand-sequined saris to freshly slaughtered goats) and alleyways in the Old City  can make for a thoroughly enjoyable afternoon. The famous Chudi Bazaar (Lad Bazaar) across from the Charminar is a chaotic tumble of goods, people, animals and vehicles are navigated quickly on foot. The Chowmahalla palace and the Mecca Masjid are both easily accessed from the Charminar. Necklace Road, Sultan Bazar (Koti) and Abids are worth taking some time to wander around. Please note that walking can be hazardous in Hyderabad. It is common for roads to be missing pavement, or simply unpaved, and bikes and autorickshaws may go to right up to the edge of the road and climb any barrier to get ahead in traffic. Walking alongside and crossing the road can be very dangerous and it is important to stay alert for erratic driving. It is always advisable to use the foot-over bridge if there is one available.

Old city is the historical region of Hyderabad. Most of the historical attractions are situated in the old city.

The Charminar has long been the icon of Hyderabad.  The towers rise to a height of 48.7 m above the ground. It has 140 steps. Graffiti on the walls have diminished the beauty of the Charminar. There is a mosque with 45 prayer spaces located inside in the upper storeys. The structure stands in the middle of a busy road with vehicular traffic, but a pedestrianization project is under way. Atop the minarets, you get a panoramic view of Hyderabad city. At the very bottom of one of the minar is a Hindu temple. The traffic is less than ideal.

* <see name="Mecca Masjid" alt="" address="" directions="SW of the Char Minar" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="" email="" fax="">Mecca Masjid is one of the oldest mosques in the city and easily the biggest. Muhammed Quli Qutub Shah began building it in 1617 under the supervision of Mir Faizullah Baig and Rangiah Choudhary. Mughal emperor Aurangzeb completed the construction in 1694. The mosque is a granite giant with awe-inspiring innards. The main hall of the mosque is 75 feet high, 220 feet wide and 180 feet long, big enough to accommodate ten thousand worshipers at a time. It is believed that Muhammed Quli commissioned bricks to be made with the soil brought from Mecca and inducted them into the construction of the central arch of the mosque, which explains the name of the mosque. It is mandatory for women to have a dupatta / shawl in order to be granted entry into the premises.</see>

* <see name="Golconda Fort" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" url="" hours="7AM-8PM" price="Rs 100 all" lat="" long="" email="" fax="">The Golconda Fort was the capital of the Qutb Shahi kingdom. Set aside a minimum of 2 hr to do justice to your visit -- the outer wall measures 10 km. Learning a little about the fort ahead of time is recommended as it is easy to get confused or lost in the massive space. If you accept one of the local guides - who hustle you at the entrance gate - try to pick one who actually knows his stuff (Rs 500 per tour and the guide would also ask you for tips in the end, however it is entirely up to you whether to give tips or not), rather than someone who was actually just passing by, spotted you and will tell you bits he once read in a guidebook. The genuine old Muslim guide who gained his encyclopedic knowledge of Golconda as an infant from his 118 year old grandmother knows the history of every inch of the place and will show you with expertise the echo/architecture system built into the fort that the ruler used as a communication/spying system. There is also a '''light and sound show''' - the story of Golkonda - for an hour, which could be a little boring,(price for foreigners Rs 50/100 for normal/executive ticket) after sunset lasting ~1h that tells you the story of the fort and is worth seeing. The English show runs Nov-Feb 6:30PM daily and Mar-Oct until 7PM daily. Hindi and Telugu shows are run afterwards in certain days. Afterwards, have a wander through the tiny streets and shops surrounding the fort. The beautiful scruffy old shops and houses will sell you everything from naan bread to bangles, and the fading and gaudy old painted gates and houses are a delight, as are the friendly locals.</see>

A pleasant space for young couples to spend their evening. Smells sometimes, but that is the nature of any waterbody in a metropolis. Another important event that takes place is 'vinayakachaturthy', (a festival for Hindus in which Lord Vinayaka's statues are immersed (and thereby dissolved) in water).

==Tours==

Recently, there has been a great rise in the number of complaints about harassment of innocent tourists in various destinations around the country. The Ministry of Tourism has adopted a strategy of introducing Audio Guide Devices at various places of interest around the country such as the Taj Mahal, Agra Fort, etc. to provide reliable and factual information to tourists. It is wise to hire such devices as you can avoid being ripped off or ambushed by desperate touts itching to make a buck. The Ministry of Tourism has also announced its partnership with AudioCompass, a company specializing in creating Audio Tours of all places of interest in the country including Hyderbad, Golconda Fort, etc in the form of Audio Devices available at the monuments and Smartphone apps that can be download from the App Store.

No visit to Hyderabad would be complete without sampling its unique cuisine - a rich blend of royal Mughlai flavours, Nizams special, and spice-up culinary traditions of South India such as: Hyderabadi biryani, pathar-ka-ghosht, nahari, haleem, double-ka-meetha, khubani-ka-meetha, seviyon-ka-meetha and kheer.

A popular dish of Hyderabad is biryani. Ask anybody about their favorite dish of Hyderabad, and they will definitely tell you Hyderabadi biryani. It is prepared with a  blending of Mughal kitchen and the style of cooking practiced by the Nizams. Hyderabadi biryani has a distinct aroma. Beautifully garnished with pudina, fried onion &amp; boiled eggs. Mostly it is served with dahi-ki-chutney and mirchi-ka-salan. Biryani has many variants like mutton biryani, chicken biryani, biryani khaam, biryani zard or zafrani or the most exotic of all joban malti biryani in which mutton, partridges and quails were cooked with rice.

'''Hyderabadi dum biryani''', is where ''dum'' refers to the baking process and basmati rice and meat or vegetables are mixed in a pot and heated for a long time. During the Nizam's time, the biryani was made with lamb carefully cooked with rice. Culinary delicacies of Hyderabad include: 

'''Gosht''', which is made from a buck/billy/young goat, and is associated with the Hyderabadi cuisine. Hyderabadis prize the meat of a male goat. 

'''Kachchi gosht ki biriyani''', of Hyderabad, where raw meat is stir fried with spices (masala) for a couple of minutes and then covered with rice and put on dum. Today, Biryani is also made using vegetables, chicken, seafood and beef. The beef Biryani is known as ''Kalyani Biryani'', available at many small eateries in the city. Although any Irani cafe might serve this delectable dish, there are a few places better known for tasteful food than their hygiene.

'''Hyderabadi Haleem''', is another dish which is available only in the month of Ramadaan (Ramzan).

'''Mirchi ka salan''', served with spicy chilly gravy, is another dish that serves as a tasty accompaniment to any rice item.

'''Khubani ka meetha''', is Hyderabad's preferred dessert sweet. It is made from apricots boiled in sugar syrup till they achieve a thick consistency. It looks similar to, but tastes different from ''gajar ka halwa'' (carrot halwa). It is often topped with ice-cream or cream.

'''Double Ka Meetha''', is a dessert made from bread, milk and dry fruits.

'''Falooda''', is a favourite drink of Hyderabad. 

'''Irani chai''' is the tea of Hyderabad, available at any of the ubiquitous "Chai" shops. Although, not all of them have the best hygiene and it is best to go with a local. The crowd at the stalls is composed mainly of blue collared workers and college students so expect a noisy environment with conversational topics that range from movies to politics. 

'''Street food''', in Hyderabad is better than most other cities in India and it is cheap. Gokul Chaat in Koti is a well known and pretty popular joint for snacks like Samosa Chaat, Dahi Puri and Sev Puri. Amazingly tasty Rajasthani street food (Kachori, Samosa and Aloo Mirch) is served by Rajasthan Namkeen Bhandar, also located in Koti (diagonally opposite Womens College bus-stop). 

'''Osmania biscuits''' are the most famous treat in Hyderabad. A sip of Irani chai is incomplete without a bite of Osmania biscuits. A must-try item on the bucket list of every visitor.

'''Lukhmi''' is a spicy & crispy savoury stuffed with mincemeat (kheema) served with tea or party starter.

===Restaurants===

[[Image:Durga Mess.jpeg|thumb|Food Mess]]

In recent times, there has been an explosion in the number of restaurants in Hyderabad, fueled by demand from young professionals with money to spend. Quality and variety of food, however, has not kept pace. There is a disproportionately large number of restaurants that aspire to be called "fine-dining" restaurants, but the food they serve is usually indifferent. In general, keep away from restaurants that call themselves "multi-cuisine" or if you see multiple cuisines on the menu, as the chances are that they are attempting to serve every kind of palate and will not satisfy any.  

The older areas of Hyderabad are better places to find good and cheap food. Places close to Hi tec city, such as Madhapur and Kondapur, tend to have expensive and bad food, while in Banjara Hills and Jubilee Hills you will find restaurants that are expensive, but which sometimes serve good food. Those misled by the fact that Hyderabad is in South India and expecting South Indian food may be disappointed. While there are excellent South Indian restaurants in some of the older areas like Koti and Abids, the average South Indian food served here is quite bad.

===Bakeries, cafes, sweet shops and fast food===

Hyderabad has a large number of outlets that are positioned as ''bakeries''. These are primarily takeaway places, where one can buy sandwiches, burgers, biscuits and puffs to go (called '''parcel''' in local parlance.) Usually, there are a few chairs and tables thrown in as an afterthought. 

Many Western chains have set up shop in the posh areas of Hyderabad. Among these are '''Texas Chicken''', '''McDonald's''', '''KFC''', '''Pizza Hut''', '''Dominos''' and '''Subway'''. Most of these have multiple outlets and all of them have Indianised their fare to varying extents. The Indian pizza chain '''Pizza Corner''' also has many outlets. '''Barista'''[http://www.barista.co.in/], '''Cafe Coffee Day''' [http://www.cafecoffeeday.com/] and '''Java Green''' [http://www.java-green.com/] outlets are good places to have coffee and conversations.

==Drink==

There is plenty to do at night in Hyderabad, though local regulations have most places serving last drinks by 11PM. On weekdays, drinks in the some of the pubs have best offers, as most clubs are empty until Thursday or Friday nights, when the clubbers emerge. But the sheer number of nightlife spots makes it hard to choose which ones to list. As a general rule they tend to be clustered around Begumpet and Road No.1, Banjara Hills.

Alcohol is available easily from numerous Liquor Shops, known as '''wine shops''' in local parlance, spread across the twin cities, in restaurants with bars attached (includes most upscale ones) and in pubs.

WARNING: Drunken driving is not tolerated and police enforce the rule strictly. After 11PM almost all the roads have police patrols and check drunk driving. If caught you may end up paying fines, apart from vehicle being seized and couple of rounds to police station in worst scenarios.

Some of the good pubs and bars are part of hotels, and they have been covered along with their hotel listing under '''Sleep'''.

Accommodation in Hyderabad is unlikely to bust your budget, especially when compared to cities like Mumbai or Bangalore, and rooms are usually easily available. However, because the city sprawls so much, you need to be careful about the hotel location if you want to avoid a long commute and traffic bottlenecks.

Plenty of options are available with online booking facilities, with web based aggregator services like OYO rooms, Stayzilla, makemytrip, etc. providing good deals for advance bookings. 
 
Plentiful budget accommodation is to be found around the Nampally railway station and in Abids, Koti and other new city areas for a few hundred rupees a day, and tourist attractions aren't very far off. However the facilities tend to be basic, the towels aren't necessarily clean and air-conditioning tends to be extra. It might make sense to pay a little more and choose mid-range accommodation. The area around Hussain Sagar Lake, Begumpet, Punjagutta, Somajiguda, Banjara Hills  and Lakdi-ka-Pul are close to both tourist attractions of the old city and the business areas of the new city. Hotels in Secunderabad might be slightly far for the tourist, but may still work for the business traveller. 

Unfortunately, hotel rooms tend to be expensive and scarce closer to Hi tec city, and commuting from any of the above areas, except perhaps Banjara Hills, is not a good option because of the traffic. Areas around Hi tec city are Madhapur, Kondapur and Gachibowli. For longer term stays, you might want to consider '''serviced apartments''' (See below)

===Serviced apartments===

Typically, serviced apartments have tie-ups with corporate professionals and give good rates to them. Companies may hire apartments on semi-permanent basis to house even their short term visitors. Like hotels, you reserve rooms by calling or writing to the property, you follow a check-in and check-out schedule, and you don't have to pay extra for services such as housekeeping, maintenance and utilities. Serviced apartments are usually 40-50% less expensive than hotels.
