'''Kamloops''' is located in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. It is the Tournament Capital of Canada. It has hosted Strauss Canada Cup of Curling, Skate Canada, World Fly Fishing Championships, Tim Horton's Olympic Qualifying Bike Race, and World Junior Hockey Championships.  Kamloops has a population of just under 93,000, but is very spread out along two rivers, giving it the impression of being a much larger city.

===By Air===
'''Kamloops Airport[http://www.kamloopsairport.com]''' ({{IATA|YKA}} | {{ICAO|CYKA}}) is served by Air Canada  Jazz[http://www.flyjazz.ca], Central Mountain Air[http://www.flycma.com] and WestJet[http://www.westjet.com], it connects Kamloops to and from [[Calgary]], [[Vancouver]], [[Prince George]] and [[Edmonton]](seasonally). 

===By Train===
Via rail runs to Kamloops.

===By Car===
Both Major highways in western Canada pass through Kamloops. The TransCanada highway passes through the Fraser valley from Vancouver in the west, and continues east through the rest of BC via [[Chase]], [[Salmon Arm]], [[Revelstoke]], the [[Rogers Pass]], [[Golden (British Columbia)|Golden]], and onto [[Alberta]] via [[Banff]] and [[Calgary]].

The YellowHead #5 highway heads north from Kamloops to [[Jasper]] and [[Edmonton]].

The Coquihalla #5 was originally built for Expo 86 in [[Vancouver]]. It was a toll highway up until September 2008, when it was unexpectedly announced that the toll was being lifted immediately, and the toll booths were taken down. This is a boost to Interior British Columbia and welcomed by many. The Coquihalla provides a much quicker route from [[Vancouver]] to '''Kamloops'''. (Approx 4 hrs by car) This route take you through [[Hope (British Columbia)|Hope]] and [[Merritt]] and is considered less scenic than the TransCanada route. The downside of the high altitude road is that it can become dangerous in the winter as sudden weather changes may make the road icy, snow covered or impassible (there is actually a popular Canadian reality TV series titled ''Highway Thru Hell'', which is primarily about vehicle rescue and recovery operations on the Coquihalla). Check the [http://www.drivebc.ca/home.jsp road conditions] before you set out.
