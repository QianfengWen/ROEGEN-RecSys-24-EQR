{{pagebanner|Aqaba Banner.jpg}}

'''Aqaba''' (العقبة ''al-ʿAqabah'') [http://www.aqaba.jo] is [[Jordan]]'s only port city, located on the Gulf of Aqaba in the extreme south of the country.

==Understand==
[[Image:Aqaba3.jpg|thumb|200px|Aqaba city view]]
Aqaba is Jordan's window on the [[Red Sea]]. Historically the same city as [[Eilat]] on the [[Israel]]i side of the border, plans for a shared international airport and other forms of cooperation have cooled down in the past few years during a period of political tension.  Aqaba has seen a lot of development in the last few years.  This has improved the infrastructure and facilities.  Be prepared for road maps to be incorrect/out of date.

==Get in==

===By boat===
{{moreinfo|timetables, prices etc.|Ferries in The Red Sea}}
Ferries run regularly from Aqaba across to [[Taba]] and [[Nuweiba]] on [[Egypt]]'s [[Sinai]] peninsula, bypassing [[Israel]] and the sometimes complicated border arrangements. Taba is the best port for tourists (the crossing is shorter, so cheaper and less likely to be cancelled due to bad weather). Generally there is no visa fee for entering Jordan through Aqaba since it is a part of the free trade zone. For contact details and timetables see [[Ferries in The Red Sea]]

===By bus or car===
The Desert Highway terminates in Aqaba.  There are frequent buses to [[Amman]] and other points along the highway.  The JETT buses leave from Abdali  at 7:00, 9:00, 11:00, 14:00, 16:00, and 18:00. Tickets cost 8.80 JD. Note that there are several security checkpoints along the way, just show your ID when the police enter the bus. At one checkpoint you may be required to exit the bus, retrieve your luggage from the baggage hold and run it through an X-ray machine. (September 2014)

Amman to Aqaba is about 350km using the Desert Highway.  It will take about 4 hours to travel this distance at a reasonable speed.  Do remember that service/fuel stops are not very frequent on this road.

The [[Israel]]i border at Arava (for [[Eilat]]) is only a short hop away.  The [[Saudi Arabia]]n checkpoint is also visible on a clear day, but visitors without a visa can only look.

If you are planning to come to Aqaba directly from northern Israel (e.g. from Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Be'er Sheva, etc.) by catching an Egged bus to Eilat, you should ask the driver to let you off at the "Eil'''o'''t stop to Jordan", which is the last stop before the Egged station in Eilat, and then walk the <1km to the border checkpoint. The stop is located exactly after the interchange(circle) of road 90(Jerusalem-Eilat) and road 109 (from Interchange to the boarders).


'''Note:''' that the journey across the borders Taba to Eilat to Aqaba, back to Eliat and finally Taba again (so in any direction) can be done '''without any stamps being placed in your passport'''.  No extra fees are incurred and all stamps are placed on separate cards given to you by immigration officers. You must ask for this nicely, but the procedure was simple and quick with little hassle. 

It will appear (once you throw out the cards) that you have never left your starting country. 
Done with Canadian Passports in '''January of 2014''', though it appears that nationality had no bearing whatsoever to the officers.

===By air===
Royal Jordanian operates 2 daily flights between Amman and Aqaba, one in the morning and one in the evening. Duration of the flight is approximately 1 hour and costs 68 JD + tax one-way.

The King Hussein International Airport is located north of Aqaba, about a 20-minute drive.

Turkish Airlines operates 3 weekly flights and connects Aqaba to more than 200 destinations worldwide. Ryanair will begin Winter-season service to Aqaba from October 2018 from four European cities, whilst flyDubai flies to Aqaba from Dubai from June 2018. Easyjet has commenced weekly flights to Aqaba from London-Gatwick and Berlin Schönefeld on November 2018.

A taxi from the airport to the city should cost 10-12 JD. Agree on the price beforehand and if possible pay with exact change as drivers do not carry change and will sometimes take an extra few dinars than previously agreed.

As of November 2018, it would seem the new Jordan Shuttle service promoted on various websites is either a scam or so badly run as to not be worthwhile. The bus does not show up at the airport. Staff at the airport said they have contacted the police regarding this company. Their website looks legitimate but do not pre-book online with them. As things stand, the only way to get from Aqaba airport to the city is by taxi.

===By taxi===
Minibus rental with driver from [[Petra]] costs 45 JD and it takes about 2 hours to get from Petra to Aqaba.

If you are coming from Eilat, Israel, you will cross through the Yitzhak Rabin Terminal. This is open Sunday-Thursday from 6:30 to 20:00 (8 p.m.) and Friday-Saturday from 8:00 to 20:00, except for Yom Kippur and the Moslem New Year.  Taxi from Eilat center to the Border is 30 NIS (March 2012). The fee to exit is 107 NIS (June 2014), you can pay with credit card.  For citizens of most countries (including U.S.), you can get a two-week Jordanian visa at the border, but some countries' citizens are subject to other requirements, so check in advance. If you leave Aqaba through this border, you also have to pay an exit tax of  11 JOD (June 2014). 

Taxis at the border belong to one company, which has a monopoly, and is therefore much more expensive than a typical Jordanian taxi: 11 JOD (June 2014) for a 15-minute ride to the Aqaba bus station.  Going the other way from Aqaba city center to the border can be done for 4-5 JOD. If you are on a budget, you will probably want to take the border taxi into town and switch to another taxi to continue on, especially if your hotel is in the South Beach resort area.

Official taxi rate from Aqaba to Petra is 50JD. However, heading to the King Talal street local bus station with buses to Petra you will be sided by taxi drivers starting negotiations directly from 35JD. We manage to pay 27JD(December 2012) to the visitor centre of Petra.

====Eilat Border Taxi Mafia====
[[Image:Aqaba Border Taxi Prices.jpeg|thumb|Sign detailing taxi prices on the Jordan side of the border]]
There is a problematic man running the taxi service, which has been likened to the "Mafia", just outside the customs gate. As soon as you see him, he will let you know that '''sharing a taxi is not allowed''' (three men were forced to take three separate taxis in Dec 2011). If you want to share a taxi, you must form your group ''before'' exiting the customs area and insist that you are all part of the same group (discussing anything in front of him may make him suspicious and may make him raise the price).

Also, if he sees you call your hotel or any other car to come and pick you up, they may be stopped and forced to go back to Aqaba. The man has said, "we will close their hotel" and "we will take their driving license". To try and avoid this, call your hotel or private car while still in the customs area, ''before'' being seen by the taxi man.

For those trying to walk the 2.5km to the main road, or 500m through bird observatory, the taxi mafia has connections with the military personnel and may send a taxi out to pick up military personnel to bring you back. They will bring you back to border so manager can spin his lies.

It is possible to bargain them down, but you will need to be persistent and enlist the help of the border police to mediate. Don't try and set the price too low. Stay polite, but be firm and explain to the border police that it is not a good first impression for tourists to have and that you will write to the Ministry of Tourism. This threat normally sees the 'Taxi Mafia' back down, but there are no guarantees.

They will not go below the prices posted on the sign. For example, 7 JD to the airport is about as low as they'll go, and it will be '''11 JD to Aqaba City Center''' (June 2019). They will not negotiate the price into Aqaba City Center and will simply point you to the sign. If you go further than the city centre (Ex: Southern Beach), it may be cheaper to use their taxi to the center and change taxi there (11 JD to the centre and 3-4 JD to the beach, instead of 21 JD) 

The situation has improved as there is a huge sign stating the taxi fares for all important destinations which makes the annoying haggling obsolete. A ride downtown Aquaba will be charged with 11 JD or 15 Euros now. "Mafia man" will still try to cheat you by saying that prices have increased a few days earlier and that the sign will be updated.  Insist on the official government-set price, and threaten to contact the tourist police at the border. That will cool him down. Generally speaking, many people will attempt to cheat you everywhere you go in southern areas (Aqaba, Wadi Rum, Petra) [June 2019].

==Get around==

===By taxi===
Taxis are easily available in the city. A ride within town should cost no more than 2 JD. A ride outside town (to a beach near by or to any border crossings) costs around 5 JD. However, if your hotel calls you a taxi, you may end up paying double for it as they receive a kickback (this is especially true if you are staying on the South Beach).

While taxis are yellow all around Jordan, early 2008 Aqaba taxis have been painted green and blue: the logo colours of Aqaba Special Economic Zone (ASEZ).

When negotiating the price of a taxi, make sure to determine whether the final cost is the total or "per-person" price, as you may otherwise receive a surprise at the end of the ride.

===By local buses===
Local minibuses connect residential areas with downtown. The fare is 17 Piasters (170 Fils or 0.17 JD) regardless of the length of the journey. Passengers can get on and off at any point of the route.
The central bus station is located in front of the Police station in King Talal street, less than 10 min walk from city centre (ayla square, Al-Hussein Bin Ali Mosque).

Buses stop at the roofed benches at King Hussein Street, near the big flag pole and near the traffic light. 
Central bus station workers typically point travelers to the flag pole stop.

JETT buses leave for Amman at 7:00, 9:00, 11:00, 14:00, 16:00, and 18:00. (These do not stop at the Wadi Rum turnoff.) The cost is 8.80 JD. 

===Daytrips===
Most destinations that are not north of Amman can be reached on a day trip. You can set up your own flexible day trips by hiring a taxi for the day. Make sure when you set up the trip that you have agreed on the destinations to be included in the trip (or you may need to discuss your price while on the road and do not have other options that your current driver).
*[[Kerak]] &mdash; site of a once-mighty Crusader castle
*[[Madaba]] &mdash; known for its mosaic map of Jerusalem
*[[Petra]] &mdash; Jordan's top attraction, an ancient city carved out of sandstone and one of the new 7 Wonders.
*[[Wadi Rum]] &mdash; barren, isolated and beautiful, granite cliffs contrasting with desert sand
*[[Dead Sea]] &mdash; The lowest point on earth and the most saline sea
*[[Dana Nature Reserve]] &mdash; Stay in a village little changed since the 15th century, enjoy unforgettable hiking in an offshoot of the Great Rift.


Aqaba is relatively close to both [[Wadi Rum]] and [[Petra]].  Public buses go to both.  Alternatively, there are a lot of tour companies around town who would happily arrange excursions, in particular to Wadi Rum.  Petra will take 2.5 hours by car.
