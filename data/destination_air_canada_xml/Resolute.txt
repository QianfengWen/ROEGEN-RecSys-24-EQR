'''Resolute''' (ᖃᐅᓱᐃᑦᑐᖅ ''Qausuittuqis'') is a small town on [[Cornwallis Island]] in the [[Qikiqtaaluq Region]] of [[Nunavut]], [[Canada]] and is one of the northernmost communities in Canada. This small community has a meager population of 198 as of the 2016 census.

==Understand==
Located on Cornwallis Island in the extreme north of Canada, this small Inuit hamlet was established in 1953 in order to secure Canadian claim over its Arctic areas during the Cold War. The weather in Resolute can be summed up in two words: '''freezing cold'''. Average temperature is −16.4°C (2.5°F); only briefly during the summer do temperatures climb above zero degrees. Like most other places in the Arctic, the climate is very dry. Most snowfall occurs during the summer.

==Get in==
The only practical means of traveling here is to use '''Resolute Bay Airport'''. Most flights comes from the capital of Nunavut, [[Iqaluit]]. There are also sporadic connections with the even more remote community of [[Grise Fiord]].
