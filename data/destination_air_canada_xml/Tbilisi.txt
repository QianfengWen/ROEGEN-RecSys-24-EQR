[http://www.tbilisi.gov.ge '''Tbilisi'''] ([[Georgian phrasebook|Georgian]]: თბილისი) is the capital and the largest city of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], lying on the banks of the Kura River with a population of roughly 1.5 million inhabitants. Tbilisi is known for its distinctive architecture, which reflects the city's storied past and comprises an eclectic mix of Medieval, Neoclassical, Art Nouveau, Stalinist and Modernist structures.

Present-day Tbilisi is one of the safest cities in Europe and frequently ranks among the most popular emerging destinations thanks to Georgia's growing tourism industry.

__TOC__
Tbilisi lies in the centre of eastern Georgia, in the foothills of the Trialeti mountain range. According to Georgian legends, it was founded in the 5th century by King Vakhtang Gorgasali who, while hunting, shot a pheasant which fell into a warm spring and was either boiled or healed. Either way, the king was inspired to found a city on the site, and the name of the city derives from the Georgian word tbili meaning "warm".

Although the city has been destroyed and rebuilt some 29 times, the layout of the Old Town is largely intact with narrow alleys and big crooked houses built around courtyards.

It travels via Samgori (where you can change for the metro), Avlabari, Freedom Square, Rustaveli, Republic Square and Tamar Bridge, to the main train station (Vagzal). The trip to the city centre can take over 50 minutes. The fare is GEL1.00 (August 2022). Purchase only by Metromani card which costs 2 lari and can be used in metro, buses and ropeways in the city. It shoud be possible to pay also by Visa or Mastercard, but my european Visa didn't work. Do note that stops are not announced and that there isn't much room for luggage, but otherwise is a convenient and very affordable way to get downtown.

Taxis between the airport and the city cost 20-30 lari. Standard rates are listed on a board by the taxi rank as you exit the airport, on the right hand side.

Trains from the airport to Tbilisi's central railway station should cost GEL0.50 and the travel time is 35 minutes. The train runs not any more (as of August 2022) From Tbilisi central station you can connect to the Tbilisi Metro ('Station Square' station). To buy a ticket, place the exact change into a box at the end of the carriage after you board the train.

'''Transit from the airport during the curfew from 9pm to 5am:''' You can use Popular Taxi Tbilisi with airport transfers for around 10 euros.  Yango and other applications does not work at night. You could also negotiate with the taxi hustlers at the airport during the night when arriving to Tbilisi. Their prices how ever start from 50 euro at night, but can be also negotiated down to 15 euro.

'''Kars Vipturizm''' operates a  minibus services between Kars, Ardahan, Akhaltsikhe and Tiblis. Phone: +904449188. Little english spoken.  As of September 2019 the bus left at 11am Wednesday Friday and Sunday.

'''Neo-Turs''' bus company offers bus transfers Tbilsi - [[Thessaloniki]] - [[Athens]] and back, starting from ''Didube'' bus station (price: USD100).

===By minibus===
The main mini-bus station can be found at Metro station ''Didube''. Buses 21 and 46 lead there from the city center. It's rather large, and you'll find minibuses to almost anywhere. Once at the metro platforms, take the train on the right (going forwards). This direction takes you to the main station and centre. There are no signs in English.

For minibuses to some destinations (e.g. Sighnaghi), you must go to ''Samgori'', at Samgori metro station.

Minibuses from Yerevan will drop you off at Ortachala bus station, which is not easily connected to the metro network, but taxis in Georgia are cheap, or at the train station. Vans (Grey Mercedes Sprinter) leave from the parking lot in front of Yerevan train station at 9:00, 11:00, 13:00, 15:00, and 17:00 and cost 30 lari or 6000 AMD. Please note, that drivers might be smoking inside while driving.

===By boat===
Tbilisi is located inland and does not have ferry connections. You may be able to catch a ferry from Ukraine to Batumi, eight hours away.

==Get around==
Main transport inside and outside Tbilisi city is bus and minibus - marshrutka. 

=== By metro ===
[[Image:Met.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|One of the Tbilisi metro stations]]
[[Image:Merto Station Freedom Square.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Freedom Square metro station]]

Tbilisi has a two-line [http://www.urbanrail.net/as/tbil/tbilisi.htm metro system], which operates 06:00-23:59.

All signs inside the metro are in Georgian and English. Station names are announced in both English and Georgian as well. There are a few system maps in carriages, usually located above one of the carriage doors. It will be hard to find English speakers riding the Metro; Russian, however, is widely spoken. Take a bilingual map with you if you are not proficient with the local alphabet/pronunciation. 

A trip with the metro and bus system in Tbilisi costs GEL1.00, but you will have to buy a Metromani card (GEL2) at the counter. You can load the card with any amount you like, and use it for travel on buses, the metro, and the new yellow marshrutkas. Marshrutkas vary in price from GEL0.40-0.80. If you keep the receipt when buying the card, you can get any excess amount returned from the card within 30 days after the purchase.

You can use the public transportation system for 90 minutes paying only 1lari.

At the Samgori station, near the east end of line 1 (red), one can change for bus 337 to the airport. The bus actually goes all the way to the city centre, but roads can become congested, so changing may be a quicker option.

===By bus===
City buses are yellow or blue, and come in various sizes. The bus number and a description of the route are usually listed on signs in the bus windows, but only in Georgian. In the center most stations have accurate electronic arrival boards, in English and Georgian, and display the bus number, minutes to arrival, and destination. Outside of the center, look for a sign with a picture of a bus.

Board through any door you like; usually the double doors in the middle are easiest. A journey costs GEL0.50, and exact change is required if you don't have a touch card (which can be purchased at Metro stations). If you have a Metromani card, touch it on the top of the card machines and make sure you wait for a paper ticket to be issued. Hold onto the ticket you receive on the bus; you will need to present it to the yellow-shirted ticket checkers. 

Marshrutkas are vans which service the side streets of the city; they are independently owned. Like buses, the route is posted in the front window (often only in Georgian), but marshrutkas use a different route numbering system, and the route descriptions may be more general than the buses (e.g. "Vake" rather than a specific street in the Vake area). Fare is (on average) 0.80 GEL; shout "gacheret" when you want to get off, and hand the driver your fare on the way out. You can pay also with the electronic card you need for the metro. Buses are generally easier to use than marshrutkas if you don't speak Georgian or Russian.

===By taxi===
Taxis in Tbilisi are typically privately owned vehicles, and don't run on a meter. If you're going anywhere other than the nearest metro station, major hotels, or tourist destinations, or if you don't speak Georgian or Russian, it's likely that your driver will stop multiple times and ask pedestrians for directions. Even then, he may not know how to get to your destination. If the driver has difficulty finding your destination, he will charge you for his trouble. ALWAYS negotiate a price beforehand, and insist on paying before departing. A trip anywhere in the city should never cost more than 15 lari, unless you're going to the airport. Getting a receipt is also really difficult if not impossible!

* Bolt - mobile application with hundreds of verified taxi drivers in Tbilisi. Choose taxi by distance, car model and user feedback ratings. App calculates taxi ride fare and local support team monitoring the rides and solving potential issues.
* Yandex.taxi - mobile application that works like Uber. Probably the cheapest version. A ride within the city will set you back between 1 and 5 Lari.
* Maxim - similar as Yandex only Cheaper and through whole Georgia.

Massages are available; however, they are more like a washing, but well worth it for the experience. You should bring your own towel and beach sandals (available for a small fee).  Some travelers have suggested the Royal Baths is a much better alternative to Sulfur Baths (they are next to each other).  Sulfur baths tends to double the price at the end of the massage and bath in spite of your original agreed price. Public bath at Bath N5, 3 GEL (July 2017)<br>

Allright for a hot summer day, and offering views of both the mountains and the city below. Snackbars, restaurants and fruit cocktail shakers are available overlooking the lake. It's about an hour's pleasant walk from the Saburtalo district along country roads, passing the Ethnographical Museum, or a ten-to-fifteen minute (5-10 lari) cab ride from the center.

==Buy==
The Saturday flea market ("Dry Bridge Market") by the river (on the "Dry Overpass" and surrounding areas) is one of the best places to get jewellery, antiques and even antiques swords, as well as musical instruments and electronics. Haggling is encouraged, although if you speak little Georgian or Russian you may experience the odd juxtaposition of bargaining for antiques using the keypad of your vendor's mobile phone. 
Find Nana - the kind hearted old seller of the Dry Bridge Market (everybody knows her, just ask). This is if you want to have a real georgian experience in the market, with a few interesting stories, local sweetest tangerines as gifts for a stranger from far away (meaning you) and an honest georgian smile.
This market is also active on other days of the week, albeit on a smaller scale.

Main Market - fun to peruse, or to buy excellent fruits and vegetables. There is a bus stop right in front of the market coming from the center, Dry Bridge Market, or Vake; however, to go back to the center, Dry Bridge Market, or Vake you will need to walk one block in either direction to catch the bus back. Google Maps has accurate bus routes to the market.

* '''Gold, Silver, Precious Stones, and Other Jewellery''' - Many people visit Georgia to buy jewellery, because of its cheap cost and superior quality. 

* '''Art & Paintings''' – Georgian artists, such as Pirosmani, Gigo Gabashvili, David Kakabadze, Lado Gudiashvili, Korneli Sanadze, Elene Akhvlediani, Sergo Kobuladze, Simon Virsaladze, Ekaterine Baghdavadze, Maka Kiknadze-Kipiani and others, are famous for their work. In Georgia you will find many various art shops, paintings and painters who sell their works on the streets, including during the Saturday antique market.

It is located way out past the suburbs on the way to Mtskheta - take bus 121 from outside Didube station, minibus 51 (which passes through Saburtalo, Heroes Sq., etc), or a taxi for up to 10 lari. Currently there are three floors but only the ground floor is really "open".  The middle floor has just a few shops and lots of vacant ones. The top floor is totally empty save for one shop. The mall has potential once more shops open up. At the moment there's Zara and its cousins Pull & Bear, Bershka, Stradivarius; Topshop, Marks & Spencer, Superdry, Gap, etc.  Signs indicate several upcoming tenants including new-to-Georgia American food chains Popeye's Chicken, Burger King and Villa Pizza. At the moment there's no restaurants apart from a little café. However, the real saving grace is the giant Carrefour, hands down the best supermarket in the country. It's absolutely massive, very good quality, and low, low prices. It even maintains a local flavour, including a real Georgian bread kiln with especially good hot and fresh shoti puri for just 70 tetri.</buy>

==Stay safe==
Tbilisi is very safe after the Rose Revolution. The police system was reformed completely and the recent polls show that public's trust in police shifted from nearly 10% to 88%. The police are usually quick to respond, though usually only Georgian and Russian are spoken.

While walking is generally fine, even for solo women, it makes sense to take a bus or taxi home at night. Use common sense and big-city awareness. Night time at the clubs and bars is safe, and taxi service is safe as long as it's a company taxi like "009" or others. The public bus is also a good, safe option for 0.50 lari.

==Contact==

There are 3 GSM operators of mobile phone service:

* Magticom: provides 3G, 4G and 4.5G, covers more than 90% of populated regions of Georgia. There are different tariffs and packages. SIM card can be purchased directly at Tbilisi International Airport
* Geocell: provides 3G and 4G, covers all of Georgia, packet data deals available for prepaid. 2 GEL for the SIM, 10 GEL for 1 GB of data. There is a Geocell office in the Marjanishvili metro station.
* Beeline: russian company, the cheapest of all sim cards, but does not get the best reception in some areas. buy a sim card at the office on Rustaveli Avenue or Ortachala international bus station (help-line number for Beeline mobile: 110101 from Georgia).

==Cope==
You should make a quick stop in the Tourism Office on the south side of Freedom Square upon arriving in Tbilisi. They provide a free, very detailed map of the city as well as varying levels of competency when it comes to information; they are often out of printed material, and it can take some time to extract maps, brochures, etc, as they keep most of these hidden behind the counter and are often oddly reluctant to part with them, though if you're politely persistent you may be able to get what you need. They can print out a list of hostels or hotels upon request. They can also give you an English to Georgian vocabulary sheet with all the rudimentary words as well as the Georgian alphabet.

Stop by the Marriott Courtyard if you're lost - the staff are fairly fluent in English, and they are more than happy to provide you with free maps, and help you track down whatever you're looking for on a map before you leave. 

Be careful about renting DVDs from Prospero's bookstore - there is quite a selection, but as most of them are pirated, almost half of all their DVD stock is of a poor quality. For your peace of mind, you can check any DVD on a player in the cafe before you rent it.

Warning - there is at least one taxi driver waiting at the airport who insists on using a meter which results in a bill of around 90 GEL to get into Tbilisi.

==Get out==
* [[Yerevan]], [[Armenia]] - via marschrutkas, minivans, taxi (the most expensive, c. GEL160) or train, which leaves at 20:20 (around 11 hours journey), with tickets costing GEL38 for 3rd class and GEL57 for 2nd class, cabins of 4 beds cost 55.01 lari per bed (July 2017).  
Marschrutkas leave from the international bus station "Ortachalla" at 8am, 10am, 11am and 1pm. Marschrutkas take 6-7 hours, 30 Lari. Marschrutkas also leave from the main train station, but less frequently than at Ortachala. Please note, that drivers might be smoking inside while driving. From "Didube" regional bus station, catch marschrutka 150 to reach Ortachalla. From Freedom Sq. catch 44, 50 or 71 bus to reach Ortachalla.
Minivans also depart across from the Avlabari Metro station.  The minivans depart at 9am and 5pm, cost 35 lari, and take 5 hours. The seven seats can be reserved by calling +374 94 320460 or +374 91 141490 in Armenia or +995 593 229554 or +995 592 202617 in Georgia. 
* [[Sadakhlo]], [[Armenian Border]] - If you don't want to head directly to Yerevan, the best and cheapest option is to take a marschrutka to Marneuli (from Samgori Bus Station - 3 GEL / 45min) - once you are dropped off in Marneuli, ask for the marschrutka to Sadakhlo (it should be close by). It will cost you another 2 GEL and takes 30min. The driver will normally drop you just in front of the border station. Once you've crossed the border, you can hitchhike or take a taxi/mini-bus to Alaverdi for 4000 AMD.
* [[Gyumri]], [[Armenia]] - Marschrutka leaves from the international bus station "Ortachalla" at 10:30am, takes 4.5 hours, 25 Lari. There is also a marshrutka to [[Spitak]] via [[Vanadzor]], [[Armenia]], which departs at 15pm.
* [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]] - via night train (daily at 17.30, arrival at 8.10 next morning, 2nd class in a 4-berth sleeper 59 Lari, 1st class in a 2-berth sleeper about twice as much) or bus from Ortachala bus station (daily at 16.00, arrival at 5.00 next morning, 30 Lari)
If you want to go to Baku by Marshrutka, take the Marshrutka from Station Square (in front of Tbilisi Railway Station) to Красный Мост (Red Bridge). There's a sign saying "Gold Market" at the bottom of the brutalist building and the Marshrutka goes right in front of it (I also marked the location on maps.me). It goes at 10 am and costs 4 Lari. The Marshrutka goes straight to the border (last stop) in about 90 minutes. Cross the border and pass all the annoying taxi drivers. There are buses to the left. The ticket to Baku is 12 Manat, one of the buses leaves at 12.15 pm. The bus rarely stops and took us 8 hours (April 2019).
* [[Vladikavkaz]], [[North Ossetia]] - taxis from Didube, look for Russian license plates
* [[Gori]] - by minibus (5 Lari) or shared taxi (5 Lari/person) from Didube, not much more than 1 hour
* [[Kazbegi]]/[[Stepantsminda]], - from Didube, lots of marshritkas, if negotiated well You should get there for 15 lari.
* [[Uplistsikhe]] - old rock town, ~10 lari by minivan

You can reserve tickets in the Courtyard Mariott on Freedom Square from 9am-1pm in the Pegasus airlines office. Be aware that flights may get delayed for a few hours even in good weather. The airline will occasionally accomodate people traveling from Mestia or Tbilisi, leading to delays of the flight.
* [https://www.travelwithpedro.com/how-to-travel-to-david-gareja-from-tbilisi/ David Gareja Cave Monastery] - Take a marshrutka from Samgori metro station to Sagarejo (3 GEL). From Sagarejo, you can take a taxi to Davit Gareja for 35-50 GEL round trip.
