'''Yangon''', formerly '''Rangoon''', was the capital of [[Myanmar]] until it was superseded by [[Naypyidaw]] in November 2005. Today, with a population of over 5 million people, it remains the largest city and main economic hub of Myanmar.

[[Image:Shwedagon-Pano.jpg|thumb|300px|The Shwedagon Pagoda.]]
The city is an amalgamation of English, Burmese, Chinese and Indian influences, and is known for its colonial architecture, which although decaying and beyond appreciation, remains an almost unique example of a 19th-century British colonial capital. New high-rise buildings were constructed from the 1990s (and some are scarily unoccupied and left as ghost skyscrapers and hotels as seen along Upper Pansodan Rd) as the government began to allow private investment (while former national government buildings such as the massive Secretariat Building, as the capital is shifted to Naypyidaw, have been left to rot). However, Yangon continues to be a city of the past, as seen by its ''longyi''-wearing, betel nut chewing and spitting pedestrians, their friendly or even familial attitude towards strangers, its street vendors and its pungent smells.

Yangon's former name is not the only victim of symbolic changes in this country. For one, the country's name has been changed. To add up to this identity crisis going on in this country, this city has been stripped of its capital status, the capital relocated to a secluded new site called Naypyidaw built from scratch. The flag too has been changed, recently redesigned in 2010, replacing the old one which replaced another one slightly more than a decade earlier.

One noticeable observation is seen along Yangon's southern streets perpendicular to the river. Diagonal parking is set off against the traffic direction in these one-way streets.

Most time-zones countries set their time in one-hour increments from UTC. Myanmar is UTC +6:30, which is similar to India's UTC +5:30.

Maybe because Myanmar had traumatic encounters with foreigners as far back as the Mongol invasion when it sacked the city of Bagan, the colonization by the British and invasion by the Japanese as well as the brutal cruelties inflicted by them - it developed its idiosyncrasy and to the point isolationist behaviour towards foreigners, but it is not as totally xenophobic as North Korea. As Buddhists, Myanmar people are kind and welcoming to any stranger as any guest. As long as that guest-stranger does not impose something to his lifestyle, it's OK. Somehow, they don't want to fully and sweepingly adapt to any foreign idea. That said, the history of Myanmar has its own empires, including the complete destruction of Ayuthaya which crushed the Siamese and from which they did not recover for a hundred years.

Their bit of contempt was manifested in condoning the government to practice impositions on foreigners such as a tight grip on the internet as well as the hotel TV - indispensable gadgets by tourists to the outside world in their everyday lives here and in their hometown; requiring foreigners to register and log their particulars every step of the way from every hotel down to the museum they've been, and in every mode of transport they use. Not to mention that any local who billeted a foreigner in his house overnight was long perceived by the community as an indiscretion and subject to imprisonment. Attitudes are changing rapidly, however, as a result of the government's increasing openness to foreign trade and movements towards democracy. As of November, 2013 the situation is significantly changed with far less regulation over foreign tourists and an exponential growth in technology like smartphones and tablets, Internet access and international television. Visitors in February 2014 have noticed no restrictions on internet and no need to log trip details.

Yangon is the most exotic of all Southeast Asian cities. A walk down a typical street, the sights show noticeable commercial and traffic signs written mostly in local alphabet, not to mention the appearance of wandering monks in burgundy robes and the gilded pagodas as this is expected in this Buddhist country, and down to the locals keeping up their appearances. Here, everyone seemed to be comfortable with walking barefoot - indoors or outdoors; with faces applied with sun protection cream from the extracts of a tree branch called Thanaka; smiles reddened by bloody red juice from chewing betel nut; as well as being used to images of men wearing a sarong-like garment, the longyi.

The ''' Longyi ''' - in Myanmar men wear either trousers or a Longyi, a tubular piece of cloth similar to a sarong.

The ''' Ubiquitous Help-Yourselves Water Station ''' - This image is noticeable in hot Laos and Cambodia but they pervade more here in devout Buddhist Myanmar installed at every five or so home or establishment.
   
===History===
{{infobox|Yangon or ''Rangoon''?|Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD promote the use of ''Rangoon'' instead of Yangon, as a sign of support for the democracy movement. Many Western governments keep using Rangoon as a sign of their rejection of the legitimacy of the current government.}}
According to local legend, the Shwedagon Pagoda was built during the time of the Buddha and the area around the pagoda, modern Yangon has been settled since then. Whatever the truth of the legend, it is certain that a Mon village named Dagon has existed at the site since the 6th century AD. It was renamed Yangon (the 'end of strife') by the Shwebo based King Alaungpaya when he captured it from rebel Mon leaders in 1755 after which its importance as a port city began to grow. However, the city gained in importance only after the British occupied it during the Second Burmese War in 1852, after which it became the capital of British Burma and the trading and commercial centre of Burma. The British called the city Rangoon, which was an Anglicised form of "Yangon". The city grew rapidly during the colonial period, which left a legacy of solid 19th-century colonial architecture. Burma attained independence in 1948, but its true 'modern' period begins with the 1962 military coup and the institution of an isolationist Socialist regime in 1964, resulting in the steady decay of the city and its infrastructure.

[[Image:Yangoncolonial.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Tree-lined broad streets featuring colonial architecture]]
In 1988, Yangon was the site of peaceful pro-democracy protests, in which thousands, including monks and students were gunned down. In 1989, the city was renamed to its original Burmese name, Yangon, by the military junta. In 2006, the capital was moved to [[Naypyidaw]] but today Yangon remains the business, cultural and intellectual capital of modern Burma. In 2007, Yangon again became the centre for demonstrations against the military government.

===People===
Since the 17th century, Yangon has been a cosmopolitan city with a polyglot mixture of peoples. Portuguese businessmen, Dutch fortune hunters, Englishmen of all sorts, Chinese seeking refuge from the upheavals in the Yunnan, and many, many Indians who arrived in several waves during colonial times. Most of these people are now gone and Yangon is now a predominantly Bamar city with a large Indian minority and a growing Chinese minority. Still, there are traces of the old Yangon still visible, whether it is in the crowded Indian dominated parts of Anawratha Street, or in the occasional Anglo-Burmese or Anglo-Indian who walks up and says hello. In some ways, the biggest change in modern Yangon is the loss of the Indians, who arrived with the British as soldiers and labourers (though Indian traders have always been a part of the Burmese landscape) and then left in two large waves of migration (during the Japanese occupation and again, in 1963, when they were forced to leave by Ne Win's government). Ethnic groups such as the Shan and Karen are also present. ''Kabya'', or persons of mixed heritage, are common in Yangon.

=== Climate ===
The climate is monsoonal, with three distinct seasons: a rainy season from June to October, a cooler and drier "winter" from November to February, and a hot dry season from March to May.
The winter season from November to January is markedly less humid and cooler than the remaining months, and hence sees the greatest number of visitors. Nevertheless, major festivals occur throughout the year, notably Thingyan (the water festival, equivalent to the Thai festival of Songkran), in April. (Festivals are keyed to the lunar cycle, specifically to the full-moon days of each lunar month, and therefore fall on different days each year of the Western, solar-based, calendar. However, first day of Thingyan festival occurred in 12 April because it is based on stellar cycle and number of festival days are different by years according to traditional astrological calculation).

==Get in==

===By plane===
'''Yangon International Airport (Mingladon)''' ({{IATA|RGN}}) is located approximately 30 minutes north of the city centre. Having undergone from a major upgrade and renovation of existing facilities circa 2015, it contains both international and domestic terminals.
The easiest way to get to and from the airport to the city is by taxi (official rate of USD8, 1USD=1328MMK from airport to city). The second cheaper but a longer option is the airport bus YBS, Operating from 4am to 10pm for 500 MMK (USD 0.35) per person. The bus is colored red and white and has ‘shuttle service’ marked on it. The air-conditioned buses leave every five minutes on a route to Yangon Central Railway Station in downtown. A third option is to take the circular train downtown, it's 1 mile (1,6 km) walk from the airport to the closest station Pa Ywet Seik Kone. Price is 100 kyat to Yangon railway station and the ride takes about 45 minutes. You'll either need a map, take a taxi or ask yourself forward to find Pa Ywet Seik Kone. The first train runs about 7:30am.

For going back to the airport, you'll have the same options.

There are international direct flights to RGN from [[Dubai]], [[Bangkok]], [[Chiang Mai]], [[Dhaka]],  [[Hong Kong]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Penang]], [[Singapore]], [[Gaya]], [[Kolkata]], [[Kunming]], [[Guangzhou]], [[Nanning]], [[Hanoi]], [[Ho Chi Minh City]], [[Seoul]], [[Doha]], [[Taipei]], and [[Tokyo]] . International Airlines servicing RGN include [http://www.nokair.com/ Nok Air] (To Bangkok), Thai Airways, Bangkok Air [http://www.bangkokair.com], Malaysia Airlines[http://www.malaysiaairlines.com], AirAsia [http://www.airasia.com], [http://www.cathaypacific.com/ Cathay Dragon], Korean Airlines, Silk Air, Vietnam Airlines, Air India, and All Nippon Airways. Coffee, tea and very basic snacks (packaged biscuits and single serving cakes) are available inside the security area. A new international terminal (T1) opened in March 2016 and the old international terminal has been designated as T2. Some airlines are in the process of relocating, so check with your airline for which terminal your flights will operate from.

Ancient buses ferry passengers to their aircraft. Taxis are available at the taxi counter situated before exiting arrival area. Fare is paid to the driver and is fixed, from MYK5,000-15,000 depending on the distance. Pre-paid taxis are available (USD10 or MYK8000 to downtown as of April 2016), pay at the taxi counter inside the baggage claim area or just before exit of terminal. Update January 2016: There is a taxi terminal, taxis are US$8 Airport to Downtown fixed price. You pay the driver directly. Some people say it is easier and cheaper to exit the terminal and negotiate directly with the Taxi Czar who controls the taxi trade at Mingladon but most of taxi drivers are usually inside the terminal though. Try not to allow porters to carry your luggage, as they will demand specified tips and hassle you. This is especially a problem in the domestic terminal as there is no customs to pass through with your bags. There is also no belt for luggages. Staff will put your bag on the floor. If a porter has not attached himself to a hapless tourist, he may take random bags off the luggage cart, hoping someone will follow him. On the other hand you can experience the full service treatment, not going to counters or luggage concerns for a few thousand kyats.
A new domestic terminal (T3) is now operating with a bunch of food stalls, Thai food, King Burger etc.

Apart from Airport taxi services, there are 4 main taxi services too, Grab, Oway Ride, Hello Cab, Uber. But they do not park and standby at airport but you can make pickup request by phone call. Followings are a few details about those taxi services.

Grab is fixed price. The rate is quite fair although a little bit expensive than private owned taxis. But more secure and comfort than individual private owned taxis. They won't charge you for delay time due to traffic congestion. October 2017 price for Grab taxi, Airport Terminal 3 to Sule Square (city enter) is 5900 MMK (Kyats).
Here's its facebook page and from there you can install the App. But you may need local SIM card.

Hello cabs
[https://www.facebook.com/hellocabsmyanmar/]
Hot line : 01 933 9111
You may need local SIM card to use their App.

Oway Ride
[https://www.facebook.com/owayride/]
Hot line : 01 231 8900
You may need local SIM card to use their App.

Individual private owned taxis are asking prices what they want so if you can't bargain with them (because you don't know how much it is worth for the ride) it will cost you more. And also they resist to drive you to heavily congested areas.

Update 2018: Since June, 2 bus lines offers transportation to/ from the airport. Exit the arrival Terminal, cross the parking space and you will find them. There are two buses, one taking Pyay Rd, the other Kabar Aye Rd, but both stop at Sule Pagoda and the central Railway Station. The ride costs only 500MMK, and lasts at least 40 min to Sule (without traffic). You can take it from the city as well.

Info for SIM cards.
There are 3 main operators in Myanmar. 
In descending order of their internet speed,
MPT - the best  [http://mpt.com.mm/en/]
Telenor - 2nd best [http://telenor.com.mm]
Ooredoo - 3rd [http://ooredoo.com.mm/]
(But it also depends on the location from which you are using internet)

Using internet with data packages is a lot cheaper, nearly 4times cheaper.
For MPT dial *106# and follow the menu.
For Telenor dial *979# and follow the menu.

Data packs are usually based on per month usage but you can carry on to next month if you can't used up all in 1 month period. But you have to purchase a new data pack when the previous pack expire (within a few days, usually less than 7days from the date expired). You can read the details in the corresponding websites. MPT called as Data Carry, Telenor called as Data SuBoo for that service offer.

All the mobile numbers has the prefix 09 followed by 9 digits (mostly) but there are also 7 digits and 8 digits too.
Whenever you dial mobile numbers you have to dial starting with 09xxx xxx xxx. It's a must. Some SIM cards doesn't make the call if you omit the prefix 09 although you are calling between mobile to mobile.
All the land line numbers has the prefix 01 for Yangon area followed by 6 digits or 7 digits.
(IMPORTANT NOTE to iPhone users, some iPhone are operator SIM locked. Local SIM only works with international unlock version iPhones.)

===By train===
There are several train lines that connect Yangon to the rest of Burma. Several trains daily connect Yangon to [[Mandalay]] via [[Bago (Myanmar)|Bago]] with connections to [[Bagan]] and the [[Inle Lake]] area at [[Thazi]]. Because of a bizarre timetable change in 2006 (apparently to ensure that trains arrive at a reasonable hour at [[Pyinmana]], the station for the new capital), most trains leave early in the morning (02:00-03:00) and arrive late at night. Yangon-Mandalay fares for a sleeper are USD35-50, for a seat are USD30-40 on First Class and USD10-15 on Second Class. There is also a direct train line between Yangon and [[Bagan]] (USD35/13) but trains take almost 24 hours for a bumpy journey and the change at Thazi is a better bet. April 2016: Train from Yangon to Bagan leaves 4p.m and arrives to Bagan around 9:30am. Sleeper class (4 beds and private toilet) cost for us 16000MYK. It is bumpy ride but does not take 24hours :)

The oldest line in Burma is the Yangon-[[Pyay]] line and it shows its age. But, the nine hour journey (USD15/6) along the Irrawaddy basin is well worth it. The [[Mawlamyine]] line is equally bumpy and the 9 hours express (06:15, USD17/11) and 11 hours slow train (07:00, USD14/5) is slightly longer than by road. (Note on this trip in upper class you get your own seat and it's slightly less crowded, but there isn't much else different between the classes) Trains also run to [[Pathein]] in the Irrawaddy delta but are very slow and the bus is a better alternative.

Note that when booking trains from Yangon, you have two options. For trains departing *the same day only*, enter the main entrance of the station (north across the railway bridge from the corner of Bogyoke Aung San road and Sule Pagoda Road, then east on Bo Min Yaung road). For trains leaving at any other point in the future, do not cross the railway bridge at Bogyoke and Sule, but walk 20 metres east on Bogyoke and seek the nondescript second ticket office opposite a prominent cinema. As of July 1, 2017, first class train tickets from Yangon to Mawlamyine cost 4,250 kyat/person.

See the ever-useful site of the Man in Seat 61 for more reliable information.

===By bus===
Most buses (for destinations as Bagan, Kalaw, Mandalay, Taunggyi for Inle Lake, Bago, Hpa-An, Mwlamyiane, Pyay, Lashio) depart from the Aung Mingalar Bus Terminal (also known as Highway Bus Station, MYK5000 taxi from airport, MYK2000 for a motortaxi to airport), a bit out of the city and beyond the airport, on the Pyay Road. There is heavy competition on the Mandalay route with air conditioned fares ranging from 10,500 (Mandalar Minn, E lite) to MYK18,000 for a 3 seat across VIP bus (E lite). E lite has an all new fleet with several departures early morning and evening. The new highway has dramatically reduced travel times north with the Mandalay trip taking just over 8 hours with a good bus. Buses to Bagan are at 15,000 kyat for the 9 hour journey no bargaining seems to be possible, buses depart around 9am and  from 6pm to 9pm. There are ticket offices representing all companies outside stadium opposite the main train station. Many offer ferry services to the Highway Bus Station in a pickup for 1000 kyat a taxi will cost around 6000 kyat.

Buses for the Irrawaddy delta region (Pathein, Chaungtha Beach, Ngwe Saung Beach),depart from the Hlaing Thar Yar Bus Terminal across the Bayintnaung Bridge. Buses to [[Sittwe]] and [[Thandwe]] ([[Ngapali Beach]]) are also available but the road is bad and the journey long. 

Going to the city from the Highway Bus Station is possible (Bus YBS36 yellow color aircon bus) at 200 kyat. The bus passes in front of the entrance to the Station; just ask the helpful locals. Alternatively, there should be waiting buses outside the station area at GPS coordinates 16.933211, 96.157838

If making your way to the bus terminal, ask your hotel to write it down in burmese script and catch the bus from the city hall across Sule Paya right downtown for just 200 kyat! also better than the horrible transfer timings (see shuttle ticket below) that sometimes make you wait at Aung Minglar for 3 hours. bus YBS36 takes about 1 to 2 hours to get there, but give yourself some time with check in and potential delays, leaving 2-3 hours from sule paya before your bus leaves.

To going to Hlaing Thar Yar Bus Terminal from Sule Paya get the bus YBS56 (red & white color aircon bus)  from Merchant Rd. or YBS58 (yellow color aircon bus) from Anawrahta Rd. to Tha Khin Mya Park bus transit. From there ride YBS23 or YBS20 (red & white color aircon bus) to Hlaing Thar Yar Bus Terminal. 2 hour to get there. The faster way is, take the inner circle train to Thamine station, then bus YBS16 from Thamine Station  Rd.

Thanks to the new bridge and upgraded road, buses to [[Pathein]] take less than 4 hours and the journey is comfortable. Add 45 minutes by taxi to get to the Hlaing Thar Yar Bus Terminal though. 6000 kyats.
Big bus companies serving the main tourist destinations (Aung Mingalar Bus Terminal) have sales offices across Yangon train station (can also buy "shuttle ticket" to Bus Terminal for 1000 Kyat here).

===By boat===
A hundred and fifty years ago, boats were the way to get to places from Yangon and IWT (Inland Water Transport) passenger ferries still ply the major rivers. Yangon to [[Mandalay]] takes 5 days with a change at [[Pyay]] (3 days) and the return trip (downriver) takes three days. A luxury ferry (the Delta Queen) recalls the colonial era on the Yangon-[[Pathein]] route (about 20 hours, US$170/person). The IWT ferry to Pathein takes 15 hours for the over-night trip (US$35/10). 
On okt.2015 the IWT ferry to Pathein was suspended.

==Get around==
===By train===
While Yangon's circular train is not particularly useful for getting to tourist sights, it is a 'sight' by itself. As of May 2014, foreigner tickets cost 200 kyat. Buy your ticket in a little office on platform seven in Central Railway Station or at any circular train station. Train leaves from platform 4 or 7 several times a day. You choose clockwise or anti clockwise. Probably best just to take the next train to depart. They seem to expect you to be looking for the circular train so just those words will have people pointing you in the right direction. Prepare for three hours on a hard wooden seat. You are the entertainment from some passengers: and they are yours. Watch cherry sellers step on and off a moving train with a bowl of cherries on the head. This is not a train where you lean out the window (space) to shop. The shop pops in and out of your carriage before moving on to the next. Take a seat by the door (space): the windows are low so you get a better view near the door. Pa Ywet Seik Kone Railway Station on the Yangon Circular Line is only two kilometers from the terminal at Yangon International Airport, an easy 1500 kyat taxi ride.

===By bus===
Riding the bus is absolutely safe. The only drawback is the lack of understanding. Most of the locals can't speak English and the signs are written in Burmese text.
As you would expect, Yangon has an extensive and chaotically crowded bus system. Most are privately run and will not move until enough people are falling off the sides of the bus. Buses are cheap, but high yearly inflation is chipping that cheapness away. Most routes originate and terminate on the eastern side of the Sule Pagoda so head there if looking for a bus to the airport or to the Shwedagon Pagoda. If you don’t know how to read the Burmese numbers, announce your destination before boarding. The driver/assistants seem intrigued that foreigners are taking local busses and are willing to help. Take bus 51 for the airport, they will drop you off a little past the entrance gate. You can return from the northern bus station using bus 43. This is a great option as the bus station is one of the first stops and you will have no problem getting a seat (200K). The app Bite-Pu Yangon Bus App is useful for determining bus routes. The app is all in Burmese but if you can decipher the numbers 0-9 in the Burmese script, you can navigate easily enough.

===By taxi===
The easiest way to get around the city is by taxi, and Yangon is apparently where Toyota cars come to live out the rest of their days. Genuine taxis have red license plates, carry a laminated green slip and have a large-print taxi driver identification card on the dashboard of the car, but all taxis are reliable.

Traffic is terrible in Yangon and it can easily take 30 to 45 min to drive a few kilometers. Taxis are ubiquitous and during peak times (8-10am; 5-7pm) taxis may be more expensive because of the traffic. Taxis are always available outside the bigger hotels, on Sule Pagoda Road outside Cafe Aroma, and, during the day, outside the Southern entrance to the Shwedagon Pagoda. Away from the city centre, for example near the budget hotels in Pazundaung Township, you may have to wait a bit before a taxi shows up and it may be easier to ask your hotel to call one for you. If you're travelling in the wee hours (for example, to catch a 4AM train or flight), arrange one with your hotel the previous evening. You will always, at all hours, find a taxi outside the Central Hotel on Bogyoke Aung San Road. Grab has now been operating in Myanmar for almost a year (April 18) and it saves you the hassle of negotiating the price and indicating where you are going. Grab drivers calls you 95% of the time before picking you up to ask where you are and they are not so good with reading maps but things are slowing improving.  

It is customary to negotiate prices prior to the trip, although other than tacking on an informal tourist surcharge, you'll rarely be cheated. Most taxis charge a minimum fare of 1500 kyats, increasing in increments of 500 kyats the further the destination. You should be able to get anywhere around the main Yangon area (downtown, Kandawgyi, major hotels) for 2-3000 kyats. 'Tourist' destinations such as the Shwedagon Pagoda will usually require harder bargaining to get a decent fare. Approximate fares as of October 2013 are: airport to/from city centre 8000 kyats or US$10 (official rate) Update January 2016: Airport TO city centre US$8 fixed price. City Centre TO airport 7,000 kyats; city centre to Aung Mingalar Bus Terminal 6000 kyats; city centre to Hlaing Thar Yar Bus Terminal 4000 kyats. Expect to pay more,  when it rains and late at nights. Taxis will often try to charge more for aircon or for more passengers; try to discourage this practice. 

Most taxis will be only too happy to negotiate an hourly (5000-6000 kyats) or daily (US$5-6) or longer rate. It all depends if you hire an aircon taxi or not. Taxis will take you anywhere and you can, in theory, hail a taxi and negotiate a trip to Pathein or Bago or other destinations at a much lower price than through a travel agency. See the Get out section below for sample fares.
[[Image:Yangoncityscape.jpg|thumb|A view of Yangon and the Yangon River]]

===By boat===
A ferry crosses the river to Dallah (see the Get out section below) from the Pansodan Street Jetty. 

===By trishaw===
Trishaws are scarce in the city centre (and not permitted before 10AM) but more readily available in the surrounding townships. Negotiate fares in advance but 500 kyats(60 cents) for a short ten minute ride, while higher than what locals would pay, is appropriate.

===On foot===
Distances in the tourist areas are not large and, provided you take it easy, you can walk almost anywhere. The pavements can be very crowded though, particularly on Anwaratha Road, so expect to be constantly bumped into and to have to negotiate your way across vendors selling everything from hot samosas and curry to screwdrivers and TV remote controls to jeans. Also be aware that a lot of the footpaths and sidewalks have large holes, mismatched pavers, or missing/unstable covers over drains. Walking on the footpath after dark can be treacherous, so either carry a torch or, like most locals, walk on the edge of the roadway which normally in a (marginally) better state of repair. There are not many pedestrian crossings with traffic lights and even there drivers sometimes go on red. Streets are poorly lit so for crossing better join a bunch of locals.

===Other means===
Foreigners on tourist visas are not permitted to self-drive in Myanmar. Motorbikes are not permitted within Yangon (although they are permitted elsewhere in the country).  Bicycles are available for hire (2,000 Kyat a day) and are a good way to get around.

===Shwedagon Paya===

====Historical background====
The Shwedagon Pagoda or Paya is the single most important religious site in all of Myanmar. The pagoda stands on the top of Singuttara Hill, and, according to legend, that spot has been sacred since the beginning of time, just before our present world was created. At that time, five lotus buds popped up on the hill, each bud signifying the five Buddhas who would appear in the world and guide it to Nirvana. Gautama, the Buddha as we know him, is the fourth of these five (Maitreya, the fifth, will announce the end of the world with his appearance) and, according to the legend, two brothers brought eight hairs of the Buddha to be enshrined in this sacred location, inaugurating the Shwedagon Pagoda. Whatever the truth of the legend, verifiable history records a pagoda at the site since the 6th Century AD. Built and rebuilt, gilded and re-gilded, almost nothing in the pagoda is likely to be old, except whatever is hidden deep inside the stupa. An earthquake (18th century) destroyed the upper half of the pagoda spire and many buildings. Burmese Buddhists are inherently practical people who constantly build and rebuild pagodas for merit.

Today, the pagoda is an interesting place for tourists. For one, it is lit up Las Vegas style with multicoloured neon light on a galaxy of shapes and textures. It is also a jungle of spires with superior Myanmar woodcarving embellishment and somewhat playfully but incongruously mixed and matched with modern building materials such as pre-fab G.I. roofing. Unlike other religious sites, it has at once a spiritual as well as a secular feel about it. Children run up and down singing songs, monks sit on the steps chatting, young men cast amorous glances at women, women stand around gossiping, all while others are deep in prayer in front of whatever shrine has significance for them. The Shwedagon captures the essence of both the informal nature as well as the strong ties that signify the relationship that the Burmese have with their Buddhism. There is no other pagoda like it in Burma and there is no other place like the Shwedagon Pagoda in the world.

====Practical information====
*'''Hours''': 6:30 am to 10:00 pm. The pagoda opens at 5:00 am but, technically, tourists are not allowed in till 6:30AM. 
*'''Entrance fee''': US$10 or 10,000 kyat. Ticket booths are located at the top end of the flights of steps on all entrances. If you enter before the booths are opened, the ticket agents will catch up with you sooner or later and collect the fee. They are a team of three men, one of them carrying a thick book of receipts, all wearing I.D.. <i>It is easy to avoid handing the US$8 fee to the government by simply asking for or buying a used sticker from another tourist as they leave the paya then going up one of the side entrances.</i> If you get in at 5:00 am and get out by 6:00 am you'll probably escape paying the fee (but risk not being allowed in). Ticket agents will sometimes quote the price in US Dollars (as per the sign) or Kyat (either at the government rate, the black-market rate, or an inflated black market rate). Best to have both available and pay whatever is cheapest. Tickets are valid for one day only (not a 24 hour period) and must be retained throughout your visit. While a sticker is to be displayed, is unusable the next day for a new colour is introduced. 
*'''Guides''': Guides, official and unofficial are available. 
*'''Disabled travellers''': A road on the Southern side leads halfway up the Singuttara Hill and an elevator can take you the rest of the way. Alternatively, if not in a wheelchair, head for the Western entrance from where escalators are available all the way to the top. The escalators are free for foreigners (or rather, included in the price of the ticket).
*'''Dress code''': Dress reasonably and keep your legs covered (long skirts, halfway between knee and ankle, are fine; shorts, on men or women, are not; tights or leggings on women are also prohibited). Longyi is available at the ticket booth for loan with a 3,000 kyat deposit if you arrive overly uncovered.
*'''Shoes''': As with nearly all Buddhist monuments, footwear is not permitted. With the Shwedagon Paya, almost all visitors (and all locals) remove their footwear and socks at the gates before even setting foot inside the complex. There are places to leave your shoes at the bottom of every walkway for a nominal fee (5 kyats) but that can be a problem if, say, you enter using the Eastern walkway and wish to leave by the Northern. Carry a plastic shopping bag, pop your shoes into that bag, and carry it around with you while on the walkways and platforms. That is the Burmese way! If you enter via the South Entrance, be wary of a young girl who aggressively tells you to remove your shoes and socks, and then takes them from you and puts it in a plastic bag for you. She then demands for 1,000 kyat for the bag. If you can visit during the early morning or in the late afternoon / evening so the white marble tiles do not burn your feet.

====Things to see at the Shwedagon====
*'''Day Shrines''' There are eight shrines, one for each day of the week (in the Burmese calendar, Wednesday is divided into two parts), dotted around the eight corners of the stupa (the stupa is octagonal), and most Burmese pray at their day shrine when visiting a pagoda. If you can figure out the day of the week when you were born, light a candle, place some flowers, or pour water over the shrine corresponding to that day. Starting from the Southern entrance, and going clockwise, the eight planetary posts are: Mercury (Wednesday morning, before noon), Saturn (Saturday), Jupiter (Thursday), Rahu (no planet, Wednesday afternoon), Venus (Friday), Sun (Sunday), Moon (Monday), Mars (Tuesday). Each shrine also has a beast associated with it, the most interesting one being the ''Gahlon'', a mythical half-bird half-beast said to guard Mount Meru (the shrine for Sunday).

*'''Statue of ''Wa Thon Da Ray''''' the statue of ''Wa Thon Da Ray'', the guardian angel of the earth, is to the left of the Southern Walkway. ''Wa Thon Da Ray'' is said to have saved the Buddha from burning by wrapping her wet hair around the earth. The long tresses are clearly visible in the stone statue that stands in her honor.

*'''The Arakanese Prayer Pavilion''', a little before the Western Walkway, was a gift of the Rakhaing people of Arakan. The prayer hall itself is ordinary, but the wood carvings on the roof are exquisite, probably the finest in the Pagoda complex.

*'''Maha Ganda Bell''' Known locally as the Singu Min Bell (after King Singu, who donated it to Shwedagon), the Maha Ganda bell was cast between 1775 and 1779 and weighs 23 tonnes. Impressed by the size of the bell, the British attempted to take it as war booty after the First Burmese War (1825) but dropped it into the Yangon River instead. The story goes that the British tried everything to get the bell out of the water but all their technology was of no avail. Giving up, they told the Burmese that they could have it back if they could get it out of the water. The Burmese shoved some bamboo rafts and, lo behold, powered by rafts or by divine right, the bell floated to the surface and was returned to the pagoda! Pick up a mallet and bang on the bell for luck. Behind the bell, a small pavilion provides excellent views of the stupa (spectacular at night) and a panoramic view of the city.
 
*'''Naungdawgyi Pagoda and Sandawdwin Tazaung''' Left of the Northern walkway, the Naungdawgyi or Elder pagoda is supposed to mark the spot where the sacred strands of the Buddha's hair were placed and washed before being enshrined in the stupa. (Women are not allowed onto the Elder pagoda platform.) Close by is the Sandawdwin Tazaung (Hair Relics Well) which provided the water for the washing. The well is odd because it is fed by the Irrawaddy rather than by ground water and the level of water in this well rises and falls with the tides!

*'''Dhammazedi Inscription''', A 1485 tablet that relates the story of the Shwedagon in Pali, Mon, and Burmese. One of the few verifiably antique objects in the pagoda complex.

=== Other religious sites ===

[[File:St. Mary Cathedral.jpg|thumb|right|Saint Mary's Cathedral]]
* '''Botataung Paya''' A few blocks East of The Strand Hotel along the Yangon River lies the Botataung Pagoda. The original pagoda was destroyed by allied bombing during the Second World War but the site has a legendary history as long as that of the Shwedagon or the Sule Paya, and it is supposed to house more strands of the Buddha's hair brought to the site by a thousand soldiers (hence the name which means '1,000 officers'). The rebuilt stupa is hollow inside, and many relics (not the hair though) are on display. While not spectacular like the Shwedagon, the river-front setting and the hollow stupa make it worth visiting. Admission is 6,000 kyat for foreigners.
* '''Holy Trinity Cathedral''' is the Anglican cathedral built by the British. It is one of two cathedrals in Yangon and has a beautiful interior.
* '''Mahar Wizaya'''. The Mahar Shwedagon was built in 1980, 40 years ago and is 169 feet in height. It is located on top of a small hill 460 meters near the Shwedagon Pagoda. The relics were dedicated by the King and Queen of Nepal, the country where the Buddha was born more than 2500 years ago and umbrella of pagoda (Hti Taw) was donated by The General Ne win. Therefore, it is called General pagoda. The design of Mahar Wizaya Pagoda is distinctive from other pagodas in several way because of the mix of ancient and modern style. The pagoda has main two entrances. One is on the east stairway of the Shwedagon Pagoda and the other is on Htaung Bo Road. So when you get to Shwedagon Pagoda, you can visit the Mahar Wizaya from the entrance of east. And you also find a lake in which many tortoises are raised and fed through a small bridge. There are eight gateways in the building, one unlike the other temples. The meaning of eight signs is to reflect winning signs of Buddha. Inside the building, there are two stands and stupa, built by a new architect and integrating the Mon-Myanmar culture. The Mahar Wizaya is a hollow stupa and the top of the stupa is a round room with dome. It is opened to visit the people. In the center of the room are stupa, statues of Buddha, ancients objects which a royal gift from The King of Nepal and there are several Buddha images at the bottom of stupa. It is opened every day from 5:00 am to 10:00 pm. The Mahar Wizaya is crowded on the Myanmar New Year Day with local people. If you have time, you can also visit the nearby Zoo, Kandawgyi Park, Karaweik and playground(Happy World).
* '''Mailamu Paya''', located in the outskirts of Yangon, is a large expanse of land on which larger-than-life and colourful statues depicting Buddha's lives are located. Mailamu Paya also showcases a pavilion on a man-made lake, and several zedis.
* '''Musmeah Yeshua Synagogue''', located at 85, 26th Street, is the only synagogue in Yangon. It is a colonial relic, built in 1893. Its interior is beautifully maintained.
* '''Saint Mary's Cathedral''' 
* '''Sule Paya (Sule Pagoda)''', incongruously serving as a traffic island in the middle of the busiest intersection in central Yangon, Sule Paya is a 46 m octagonal-shaped stupa that, according to the local story, was built 2000 years ago to house a strand of the Buddha's hair. Whether or not it has a strand of the Buddha's hair, the galleries of the pagoda are an oasis of calm from the chaotic traffic that passes around it all day long. Admission used to be free but foreigners must now pay a 4,000 kyat/US$3 admission charge. Shoes can be left at counters at any entrance but carry a plastic bag.

=== Parks ===
* '''Inya Lake''', the largest lake in the city, recently renovated its shoreline. Some parts of Inya Lake's shorelines are accessible by foot, and are known for their gardens. Along Inya Lake's shorelines is the famous Inya Lake Hotel, now owned by Dusit and the Yangon University (in a beautiful park-like atmosphere). Surrounding the lakeside are many villas owned by military leaders.
* <see name="Kandawgyi Lake" alt="formerly Victoria Lakes" address="" directions="" phone="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="300k (+500k camera fee, +1000k video camera fee, not aggressively collected)">A large fungus-shaped lake northeast of the city centre. It was recently renovated, and foreigners must pay an entrance fee. At its northwestern tip is Bogyoke Aung San Park, which is on Natmauk Road. The Lake is best known for its Karaweik (located at its southeastern tip), a replica of a traditional Burmese royal boat. There is also a boardwalk around the southern edge of the lake, affording a better view than that from the gardens. However the entry fee for the boardwalk alone is 2000 kyats or $US2 (in February 2018 most of the boardwalk was closed for renovations and no fee was payable for the remaining sections). It is cheaper to walk along the road footpath (sidewalk) with free view from the outside looking through the fenced park. Caution: If intending to go to the boardwalk, be careful where you are entering because a wrong entry means money down the drain that should have been allotted to a more noble purpose such as donating to a beggar. To go to the lake itself, you have to be ready to cough out the amount stated above to be paid at the entrance located in the middle of the south side road. But if your real intention is to get close to the Karaweik, the entrance is on the southeast corner and there is a separate charge. The charge to the Karaweik is 300 kyats. The lake is separated from the Karaweik by a fence and there is no way of simply crossing over although the view from the street outside looks like they are all integrated.</see>
* '''Mahabandoola Garden''', located in the cantonment, is known for its rose gardens. Inside the gardens is the Independence Monument, built to signify Myanmar's independence. The garden offers a great view of the City Hall, and colonial buildings of the British.
* '''People's Park''', which occupies 130 acres, is located between Parliament and Shwedagon Paya and is known for its large concrete water fountain. Inside the park is a museum. The government collects entrance fees for tourists, 300 kyat. Open 07:00-19:00.
* '''Zoological Gardens''', first opened by the British in 1906, contains Myanmar's most expansive collection of wild animals. During public holidays, the Snake Dance and Elephant Circus are performed for visitors. Open 08:00-18:00, admission 3,000 kyat for foreigners.

=== Miscellaneous ===
* '''Aung San Suu Kyi's House''', located at 54 University Avenue, used to be frequented by many tourists. The house used to be barricaded by a concrete wall and barbed wire, with surveillance and security to prevent documentation. Nowadays (Feb2013) with the change in the country opening towards democracy the NLD now practices freely and there is not much to see here except the outside of a wall. Getting to the area is as simple as asking a taxi driver to take you there and if driving past they will point it out to you.  Approximate taxi fares from the city is 3000 Kyts.  
* '''Aung San's House''', located at Natmauk Road (near the German embassy). This was the house were Aung San lived, with his wife and three children, shortly before he was assassinated. The house is still in original condition, with many interesting items on display, for instance Aung San's car, his library and his suit. Outside is the pond where his son Aung San Lin drowned. This accident was one of the reasons why the family moved. Foreigner entry 5000 kyats. As of August 12, 2012, the house is open 10:00-16:00, and is closed on Mondays, Tuesdays, and gazetted holidays. No photographs allowed inside the house.
* '''Bahadur Shah Zafar Grave''', located at Zi Wa Ka Street, is a grave of last of the Mughal emperors in India, as well as the last ruler of the Timurid Dynasty. After Indian rebellion of 1857, he was exiled to Rangoon, in 1858 along with his wife Zeenat Mahal and some of the remaining members of the family. Bahadur Shah died on 7 November 1862. Today you can see his tomb, and if you are lucky, a guide may be there to give you a lot of information about this Sufi saint. There is no entrance fee, but you can give donations to local Sufis. 
* '''Chin Tsong Palace'''. In 1918, Chinese business tycoon Lim Chin Tsong built the Lim Chin Tsong Palace, a lavish residence in Yangon near Kokkine Road which is now a cultural center. It is an elaborate piece of architecture of Chinese and western origin full of elegant woodwork and murals. Five-storey building, two are for the main structure and three for the complex dome at the top.
* '''Defense Services Museum''', was located in Yangon until 2011 but has since moved to Naypyidaw. It has been reopened in Naypyidaw in march 2012 in the Zeyathiri Township. It has an Air Force, a Navy and an Army department.
* '''Martyrs' Mausoleum''', near Shwedagon Pagoda's North Entrance is a memorial built to honour Aung San and six cabinet members who were assassinated. It also contains the tombs of Queen Suphayalat, wife of Burma’s last king; nationalist and writer Thakin Kodaw Hmaing; former UN Secretary-General U Thant; and Aung San Suu Kyi’s mother, Khin Kyi. In 1983, the structure was bombed by North Korean agents attempting to assassinate the visiting South Korean president. He escaped, but 21 others were killed. The structure was completely rebuilt, and is now much less grand than the original, but offers a beautiful panoramic view of Yangon. It opens only on 19th July, the Burmese National Holiday to commemorate the assassination (on the said fatal day, 1947) of Aung San and other leaders of the pre-independence interim government. The foreigner's admission fee is 3000 kyat and not worth it as all captions are in Burmese only and most of the site can be seen from outside.
* '''National Museum''', located on the relatively quiet 26 Pyay Rd., in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, displays many Burmese historical artifacts, including regalia of the last Konbaung Dynasty. The museum is open 10:00-15:00, and is closed on Mondays and gazetted holidays, foreigners admission 5000 kyat. This museum has one of the most quality collections in Southeast Asia - the best of Myanmar artistic heritage and superior craftsmanship - both Myanmar masters and unknown craftsmen but unfortunately it is in a wrong Third World hands. The architecture itself of the museum is a pathetic, awkward, tacky, and crude interpretation of modern architecture. The showcasing itself is the worse of the state of the art - captions and storyboards as if done by high school students for a school open house fair, graphics, most are handwritten, specimen documents in blueprint or photocopies, showcase cabinets that cry louder and take the thunder of attention from the display itself for its too much intricately and unnecessarily carvings. Jewelries and regalia kept in reflecting glasses and prison cell-like rooms complete with steel railings. One comment in the visitor's log indicates in big letters "LET THERE BE LIGHT!" due to poor lighting on the display. Halls and halls of exhibits have dimly lit display lights. Photography is prohibited and cameras and cell phones must be stored in lockers outside the museum entrance. Note: Do not buy books in the museum shop. Buy them at Innwa Bookstore with its varied selections, and other stores along Pansodan Rd. As an example, a book that costs US$38 in the museum costs only US$22 at Innwa.  
* '''Secretariat ''', one of the historic architectural landmarks of Myanmar is located in the city-center area of Yangon. It is a unique place which holds the most important moments in its colonial, independence and post-independence history. It can also be said that this is where the first step toward independence for Myanmar. This huge and elegant colonial building has a significant history as it is where General Aung San, Myanmar’s Independence hero, was assassinated. It is a Victorian-style building made from red and yellow brick and constructed in a U-shape. The building was opened once a year to celebrate Burmese Martyrs’ Day (19 July). But now the East Wing and North Wing are open to public and they are doing restoration to make this place come alive and also to maintain this historic place. There are also museum, art exhibition as well as offices, some retail shops and restaurants which are surrounded by flowering garden. The Secretariat Conservation Group seeks to develop the building and its compound for both the local and international audience. It is such a beautiful place to take photos and also there are shops available inside the building so you can enjoy your day exploring around the building. You can enjoy a lively evening of food and dance at The Secretariat in the Victoria Grand Ballroom every Saturday evening. A delightful meal of Myanmar tradition dishes, mixed with European, Chinese and Indian cuisines are served with a 45 minutes dance show. You can join the dinner show along with the entertainment every Saturday evenings at 6:30 to 8:30 pm.
* '''Strand Hotel''', located at 92, Strand Road, is the oldest and most famous hotel in Myanmar, built by the Sarkies brothers in 1901. It is a national landmark and was renovated in the 1990s after years of neglect. Its facade is rather unimpressive compared to other colonial buildings nearby, but the decor inside maintains an ambiance of earlier days.

* <do name="Circular Train" alt="" address="" directions="" lat="" long="" phone="" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">It is a way to get a tiny glimpse of life along the commuter rail corridor in Yangon. For experienced travelers, though, the train is monotonous and doesn't reveal more than train stations and a handful of water spinach fields. A ticket is available at the Station Masters office at (Platform No 7 at Yangon Station).  To get to platform 7, take the walkway above the tracks east of the station along Pansodan Street, and go down the last stair to the south. The train departs from the west end of the platform. The station itself, in true British colonial style, is a grand building that combines functional Western styles with Burmese architectural elements (layered ornamental roof). Vendors, vegetable sellers, monks, and commuters, all use the train which passes through the many villages that surround Yangon. The scenery changes from urban to rural fairly quickly and villages with ponds, kids, and cows pass by. The journey takes three hours. As of February 2020, due to construction on the railroad part north of the airport, the train only goes to Insein station to the northwest, and to the Mingaladon station to the northeast, not a full circle! At the Yangon Station, the train departs from either Platform No 4 or No 7, one going clockwise and the other going anti-clockwise. The eastern half is perhaps the most interesting if you are interested in agricultural activity. Do get on the train at a fast pace, as the train stops at the station for a short while only and leaves whether people have fully boarded the train or not!</do>
* <do name="Cultural Buffet Dinner-Shows" alt="" address="" directions="" lat="" long="" phone="" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">There are only two cultural dance shows lumped with buffet dinners sponsored by restaurants with the commercial profits in mind limited to snippets of folk and royal dances. The National Theater holds events only on special occasions, the rest of the year, they are not busy since there is no critical mass audience to support them.  This is a great way to learn about the local dishes.  The waiters are happy to write the dishes' names in Burmese. This really helps when ordering in other restaurants.</do>
* <do name="Cultural Shows in General" alt="" address="" directions="" lat="" long="" phone="" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">Yangon, which is supposed to be the cultural capital of Myanmar is sadly having a shortage of it. The de facto capital could be Mandalay where the remnants of anything that has to do with royalty - which is associated with arts and culture and whose patronage served as the model or foundation of what is now is claimed as Burmese Culture - are still surviving. While the British during the colonial era were too busy with something else such as India or getting much even richer propagating the empire to develop Yangon firmly as a cultural capital.</do>
* <do name="Dallah Ferry ride" alt="" address="" directions="" lat="" long="" phone="" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">Dallah, a small village across the river from Yangon, is an interesting ferry ride, particularly if you won't have the opportunity to catch a local ferry elsewhere in Burma. The ride is brief but filled with all the craziness of a Burmese ferry: you can buy freshly sliced watermelon, cheroots, cigarettes, tea, all kinds of interesting-looking food, and various knick-knacks from the many vendors who pack the ferry. The ferry is two-tiered. The lower deck has plastic seats possibly for rent - small plastic chairs (kid-sized!) are available for rent for 5 kyats (odds are that the chair rental agent won't take your money) and larger deck chairs for 15-20 kyats. The Upper deck has seats for free. Upstairs, kids will jostle to sell you packets of what is used as bird food. You throw it out to acrobatic gulls flying in a circular pathway looking to get a morsel! The ferry ride seems more like a floating market than a means of transportation! Combine the ride with a trip to Thane (see Get out below) for a half or full-day trip. There is a pagoda (what else) at Dallah worth a visit but otherwise, the village is not really a destination. The Dallah ferry leaves from the Pansodan Road Jetty across from The Strand Hotel. Once on Dala, you'll be mobbed by tricycle men who try to sell you a ride around the area. Be careful about the pricing. There's a gang who will first tell you one price but at the end of the journey, will gang up on you and tell you that you owe them 400% more for the effort. They will also tell you that their bicycle is broken halfway and plead with you to give them more - for instance, they might snatch the ignition key and argue that now they have to replace all the locks which cost quite a lot. One way out of it is to be calm, smile and bargain - you would still pay, but you can halve the price - but whatever you choose, stay calm and smile, and don't raise your voice. It'd be OK to point out to the guy that he is very angry, which makes him calm down a little. One more scam around is that they bring you to a poor village and ask you to donate rice. Much of it is a scam. Whatever you do, stay safe and make sure you know how much they intend to charge you by the half-hour rates.</do>

Handicrafts, precious gems, clothes & collectibles. Shopping is fun in Yangon because of the variety of things available and because, unlike in neighboring India, the hard sales and hassle are missing. Bargaining is expected, although tourists will be charged significantly higher prices. Street vendors in the center are not allowed to open shop until 18:00, by government mandate. Chinatown offers a wide selection of street vendors, where colonial coins, paintings, and other souvenirs can be bought.

Although not as well known as Bangkok or Hong Kong, Yangon is an excellent place to have a shirt tailored. One can have a shirt with a traditional Burmese collar (mandarin collar) made for around US$6. 4-5 days should be sufficient for a shirt to be made.

==Eat==
Yangon has seen an explosion of restaurants in the last ten years and almost any type of international cuisine - eclectic Western, Italian, Japanese, Thai, and Korean - is available. Local cuisine reflects the multi-ethnic nature of the city and the country and, along with Bamar food; there are a large number of Indian and Chinese restaurants as well as a few places specializing in Shan food. Local (Bamar) food can be pungent and is usually served with a big heaping plate of raw vegetables and an even bigger heaping plate of rice. It is definitely an acquired taste, but in the event that you are unable to get used to it, you can still get non-Bamar food fairly easily.

Note that what the locals refer to as "restaurant" may not necessarily match the western expectations of one. Even a non-air-conditioned grungy hole-in-a-wall is referred to as a restaurant, as long as it is sheltered and has tables and chairs. So clarify what you want when asking for restaurant recommendations.

Fast food restaurants (usually with table service) serve burgers and pizza, and a few cafes complete the scene. Biryani, a rice and meat dish with roots in the Mughal Empire, is a specialty and there are many Biryani restaurants (''dan-PAO-sain'' in Burmese) in the city center, especially along Anawratha Road. The three main competing restaurant chains (all halal but vegetarian biryani is usually available) are Yuzana, KSS (Kyet Shar Soon), and Nilar. There's also a KFC near the central train station. Though it may seem counterintuitive to travel to Myanmar and promptly eat the only American food in the country, it's a worthwhile endeavor to eat at the only Western restaurant in Myanmar. 

Be sure to pick up fruit from any of the street vendors in the city.  The road leading from Sule Pagoda to the Bogyoke Aung San Market is an especially great place where you can buy 10 delicious mangosteens for 1500 kyat (in the US, this would cost $20-30).

'''Street Food''' is generally not very varied. The whole stretch of more than a two-mile-long Anawratha or Mahabandoola Rds. is dotted with hawker food stalls, but unfortunately, the environment of Yangon streets is not conducive to al fresco eating due to the high density of dust in the air and the proliferation of smoke-belching buses and cars. Betel-nut-spitting pedestrians do not add to the ambiance either. Myanmar street food is mostly deep-fried and often served in a puddle of oil. Dishes are washed at the roadside "dunk" style, without soap and without running water. Nonetheless, travelers with seasoned immune systems will enjoy the experience. 

=== Budget ===
Food in Myanmar has an amazingly wide price range. Restaurants and cafes in hotels and the airport charge prices that are normal in Western countries yet at a streetside stall, you can have a whole meal for one or two thousand kyat.

== Drink ==
Nightlife in Yangon is rather limited by Western standards but is definitely improving. 

Local bars or "beer stations" as they are called close early (around 21:00-23:00), but offer drinks at bargain prices. Expect to pay about MYK600 for a pint glass of beer (Myanmar Beer). Local whiskies cost MYK2,000 a glass. Expect to get a lot of attention when going to the local beer stations since theses places are not frequented by foreigners, but people are curious and friendly! 

Drinking is not culturally accepted for women in Burma, so don't expect to pick up any girls, because there won't be any on the beer stations. The beer stations represent a place where the local men meet to talk, chew betel nut (very popular in Burma) and drink. 

Most upmarket clubs are located in 5 star hotels. Nightclubs located in 5 star hotels include The Music Club (at the Parkroyal Hotel; entrance fee USD6, hotel guests free), Paddy O'Malley's (at the Sedona, entrance fee USD5 including one drink) and Pioneer (not at the Yuzana Garden Hotel any more, it has moved to the east of the city centre). There are also stand-alone nightclubs (BME1 and BME2 in the North of the city). Local entertainment plazas that include Karaoke, fashion shows, bar and disco include Asia, JJ's and 225. Closing times vary between 23:00 & 03:00 and entrance usually is USD3-5. Beer is around USD1-2. Most up market discos and nightclubs are frequented by numerous Burmese prostitutes who will be very eager to talk to foreigners. 

*<drink name="Level 2" alt="Bar & Club" address="Yangon International Hotel Compound, Dagon Township Yangon, Burma, Myanmar" directions="Next to Yangon International Hotel" phone="+95 9 254 272 460" url="https://www.facebook.com/level2yangon" hours="22:00-04:00" price="Mid Range" lat="" long="">Level 2 is the only club in Yangon playing alternative music to the typical chart/EDM/Hip Hop music found in other clubs in the country. Fridays you can expect anything from Disco & Funk to 90s Rap, and Saturdays is House & Techno. Entry is 5000 mmk. Usually great vibes with a combination of expats and locals dancing into the early hours. Local & International DJs, make sure to check the Facebook page for monthly/weekly schedule. LGBT-friendly. </drink>

=== Gay and Lesbian nightlife ===
There are very few options for lesbians, gays, bisexual and transgenders (LGBT) in Yangon. Currently, there is only one openly gay party in Yangon called '''[http://www.facebook.com/eventsYG Fab]'''. This non-profit monthly club night is organised by YG and attracts a very mixed crowd of LGBT and straight, and locals and foreigners. The fab party is every last Saturday of the Month at [http://www.facebook.com/VIPbar.Yangon VIP bar].

== Sleep ==
Accommodation in Yangon is comparatively much much more expensive than Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia or Laos and is of a much much lower standard. Rooms with an acceptable balance of price and comfort may be difficult to find at times, especially at the height of the tourist season (December and January), and advance reservations may be advisable. Tourists used to be expected to pay in US dollars (only newer US dollar banknotes in good condition with large portraits of the presidents) but now usually also can pay in the local currency. Be aware that many military generals are sharers in the hotels, and that many hotels are under a 30-year government lease. After the lease expires, the hotels are put under governmental control.

The budget hotels (under USD20) are mostly a bit away from the city centre. The upside is that the hotels are quieter, the city centre can be quite noisy, and you get a little more room for your dollar. You'll need a cab to get to the main sight, the Shwedagon Pagoda anyway. The downside is that most restaurants are in the city centre, a long walk or cab ride away and choices outside the centre are more limited. Pazundaung and Botataung Townships seem to have the highest concentration of budget hotels. Some rooms, the cheaper ones, in many budget hotels have no windows at all and if you are claustrophobic, make sure you don't end up in one of those! There are a few budget central hotels but, except for a couple, are quite shabby. 

Mid-priced hotels (USD20-50) are scattered about the city, with one set concentrated in the few blocks around Sule Pagoda and a second set just north of the Shwedagon Pagoda. Luxury hotels are concentrated around the Kandawgyi Lake or city centre. 

Rates for hotels are usually quoted as single/double. The room is usually the same but you pay a little extra (about USD5-10) if two people share the room. Breakfast is always included and the quality and variety increases with the cost of the hotel. In a budget hotel, expect a banana, an egg, some bread and coffee made from 'coffee mix' (a pre-packaged mix of coffee powder, milk powder and lots of sugar). 

An important factor in choosing a hotel is the availability of electricity. Electric supply is controlled in Myanmar and every part of Yangon has a fixed schedule when electric power is available (usually about 24 hrs every 48 hrs or less). Mid-priced hotels usually have their own generators while budget hotels either do not or have a limited supply. Do ask when you book what the electricity situation is and, if there is no generator, what you can expect on the days that you are there.

Many budget and mid-range hotels have a restaurant on the premises. But there is no guarantee that it will be open, especially off-season.

===Internet cafes===
Internet cafes have proliferated in recent years and Yangon has quite a few that provide access at a reasonable speed for a reasonable price. Beware that you may be out of touch as the government has blocked most email sites (yahoo, AOL, etc and gmail only works occasionally). Skype is currently (March 2011) under threat from the government too. Many hotels also provide internet services but these tend to be more expensive and slower than the public cafes. The cheapest rate is around 400 kyats per hour - there are plenty of places so shop around and save some cash.

==Stay safe==
* Due to the unique laws of the country, street crime is almost non existent. Pickpockets/Muggers receive a mandatory 5 years incarceration unless they can pay large fees to reduce the sentence and the city is policed mostly by non-uniformed police. These two unique features of Myanmar means you will not experience any crime during your visit. 

*  Yangon is one of the safest big cities in the world. It is most unlikely that one can encounter a bag snatcher, pickpocket or a con artist in a crowded place.

* Most people, including single female travellers, will not have any problems roaming the streets alone at night, and carrying large sums of money around rarely poses a problem. Crimes against tourists are taken very seriously by the military government and punishment is often disproportionately severe. This, in addition to the strong Buddhist culture in the population, means that Yangon's crime rate lower than the likes of [[Kuala Lumpur]] and [[Bangkok]], and violent crime is especially rare.

* However, there have been isolated incidents involving tourists so it is best to take normal big-city precautions like avoiding lonely areas at night and always being cognizant of your valuables. As with everywhere else in the world, there is no substitute for common sense. 

* Be aware of over friendly locals that offers to take you around or places in which they are heading towards, as they may actually turn out to be local tour guides. From the Yangon Airport if you are catching a taxi, you might be a approached by people giving directions to you and showing may even ride in the taxi to your hotel with you and throughout the journey will try to push their tour package. However, if you are up for the adventure travelling the way locals do riding the old bumpy buses; negotiate for a price with the locals. It is easy finding a local tour guide as they will approach you at tourist attractions. Travelling around Yangon for half a day would cost around US$5-10 while a full day trip or half a day trip to another city such as Thanlyin from Yangon cost around US$10-15 (as off July 2011).

* The most common crime in Yangon is being short-changed by a money changer, so count your Kyat carefully when you exchange money. Opt to exchange at the Bogyoke market, where the rates may be slightly worse but the jewellery shop owners won't rip you off. Do not fall for the "bad serial number" excuse -- another attempt to con you. (only "CB" serial numbers are bad). Be especially careful with the money changer around Sule Paya - they count the money right in front of your eyes, but will trick you while doing that (they have fast hands!). Travellers are strongly advised not to change money here.

* Another concern, though this is very unlikely to happen, is being in the wrong place at the wrong time. There were a number of bomb incidents in 2005 - three bombs left in shopping malls caused numerous casualties in May, and in October, a smaller explosion occurred outside Traders Hotel. The perpetrators have not been identified and there have been no bombings since. In 2007, Yangon was the scene of numerous protests against the country's military junta and these protests were broken up by gunfire and by mass arrests. One Japanese photographer was killed. While it is unlikely that a tourist will be targeted by either the military or by protesters, events in a dictatorship tend to be unpredictable in how they evolve so, in the unlikely event that there are protests during your visit, be circumspect and avoid political rallies.

* Prostitution and drug trafficking are illegal though there are plenty of prostitutes in Yangon, often in bars owned by senior officers of the Army. Drug trafficking is punishable by death.  

* Yangon's tap water is unsafe to drink. Always buy bottled water. Yangon's warm and humid weather makes it imperative to carry water around.

* Tuberculosis and AIDS (known as "A-I-D Five" among locals) afflict a disproportionately high percentage of the people. However, HIV infection is not at the epidemic level (infection rates are much less than 1%). In addition, there is a risk of dengue fever. Malaria is a risk in rural areas.

* Medical care is limited, but is most expedient at private medical clinics. Government hospitals are usually unreliable and require bribes. Do not seek medical care at the General Hospital (on Bogyoke Aung San Road, sandwiched between Bo Ywe Street and Lanmadaw Street); it is unsanitary and inefficient. Most guest houses and hotels will be able to provide you with the address of a private doctor with experience in treating foreigners. Be sure to take the proper vaccinations before you leave for your trip. Carry a small first-aid kit with you containing at least painkillers, band-aid, ORS and a loperamide-like medicine. Anti-malarial pills and DEET are recommended.

* Many hotels, shopping centres and restaurants offer toilets. However, aside from hotels, expect squat toilets throughout the city. Always bring toilet paper when going out. Try to avoid the need to use public toilets at regularly visited sites, such as pagodas and temples. Here the longyi or the Burmese version of the sarong works well. Since Myanmar men squat when they do their business, they can totally do so. Pants constrict the legs to squat properly and steadily creating the possibility of not making a correct trajectory on the hole.
