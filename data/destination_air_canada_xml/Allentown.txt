'''Allentown'''[http://www.visitallentownpa.com/] is a small city in the [[Lehigh Valley]] region of eastern [[Pennsylvania]], in the [[United States]].  It is the third largest city in Pennsylvania, after [[Philadelphia]] and [[Pittsburgh]].  Allentown is also the county seat of [[Lehigh County]]. As of 2010, Allentown's population was 118,032. As of 2000, the population density was 6,011.5/mi²(2,320.8/km²). 

==Understand==
Allentown was founded in 1762 by William Allen. It was then known as "Northampton Town." It was renamed "Allentown" in 1838 and it was formally incorporated as a city on March 12, 1867.

Allentown has a large Latino/Hispanic population. Hispanics make up over 40% of Allentown's population.

===Geography===
Allentown lies on the Lehigh River. It is 338 feet above sea level. It is 60 miles north of [[Philadelphia]], 90 miles west of [[New York City]], and 80 miles east of [[Harrisburg]]. Allentown is only 15 miles west of the New Jersey state line.

===Climate===
The climate in Eastern [[Pennsylvania]] is unique in that it can be up to and over 100 degrees in the summer and get snow in the winter.  Summers are always hot, with temperatures in the upper 80s and humidity is usually high, above 80 or 85%.  Winters can be cold, with ice on the roads being a worse problem than snow, but it does snow.  Some years the area will only get a few inches all season, with the last major blizzard in 1996, when [[Lehigh Valley]] saw over 2 feet of snow.

==Get in==
===By air===
The primary and most convenient point of airline entry to Allentown and Lehigh Valley is '''Lehigh Valley International Airport''' ({{IATA|ABE}}), which is less than 15 minutes away from most parts of the city (the LANTA #324 bus provides service to Downtown Allentown during rush hours [https://www.lantabus.com/routes-and-schedules/route-324/] ).  Various airlines operate out of this airport. '''Philadelphia International Airport''' ({{IATA|PHL}}) is a major international airport that is about 70 miles away. Since it is a hub for several national airlines, it is easy to obtain non-stop flights to Philadelphia International compared to ABE and usually cheaper.

===By car===
* US Highway 22 is a main thoroughfare, being a 4-lane limited-access highway with a speed limit of 55 miles per hour through all of [[Lehigh Valley]] except in [[Easton]].
* Drivers coming from points east will want to note that all of the major bridges across the Delaware River (from [[New Jersey]]) are free eastbound, but require tolls westbound.  Locating the free bridge in [[Phillipsburg]] is possible, but not recommended to those unfamiliar with the area.  It is called Northampton Street for the adventurous, and only adds about half a mile to the trip (assuming you don't get easily lost).
* From the southeast and northwest, PA Route 309 provides fairly quick access and is a good road to travel.
* Interstate 78 and Interstate 476 (PA Turnpike; tolled) intersect very close to the city of Allentown, going in all directions north, south, east, and west.
* PA Route 33 is the best approach for travelers from I-80 in the [[Poconos]] and points east.

===By bus===
* '''Trans-Bridge''' bus line offers daily service from downtown Allentown to and from [[New York City]] and [[Newark, New Jersey]].  There are several express buses per day into New York City.
* '''Carl Bieber Tourways''' offers daily service to New York City, [[Atlantic City]],[[Philadelphia]] and other regionally located cities leaving from Wescoesville.  It also provides bus service within [[Lehigh Valley]] and its surrounding areas, including to and from [[Reading (Pennsylvania)|Reading]].

The city is served by a regional bus service, LANTA, whose transportation center is in downtown Allentown, providing convenient service to and from the center city.  Every LANTA bus is equipped with a bike rack.

==Get around==

Allentown is relatively easy to navigate. Most of the city is easily walkable or bikeable.  

The main east-west streets are listed from north to south: Sumner, Whitehall, Greenleaf, Cedar, Washington, Green, Tilghman, Allen, Liberty, Gordon, Chew, Turner, Linden, Hamilton, Walnut, Hernan, Hanover, Tannery, Monique and Union. Numbered streets run from north to south. They begin towards the west at 1 and continue to 42.

===By bus===
Extensive bus services are provided by '''Lehigh and Northampton Transportation Authority''' (LANTA). [http://lantabus.com]

'''Easton Coach''' also provides motorcoach and other transit services. [http://www.eastoncoach.com/]

===By cab===
Several cab companies also operate throughout Allentown and [[Lehigh Valley]]. These are:

* '''Lehigh Valley Taxi''', 610-867-6000
* '''Quick Service Taxi''', 610-434-8132 
* '''Car One Sedan of Allentown''', [http://www.car1limo.com/ca/], 610-266-9770 or 888-550-CAR1
* '''Premium Taxi LLC''', 610-433-7550
* '''Anytime Taxi by J&J''', 610-439-9241

===By limo===
* '''A&A Limousine Service''', [http://www.aalimousine.com/], 610-261-3838 or 800-281-5911
* '''J&J Luxury Transportation''', [http://www.jjtransportation.com/], 610-776-1516, 800-726-5466
*'''Royal Limousine''',[http://www.royalstretch.com/], 610-439-4800, 800-671-8511

===By car===
Most visitors to [[Lehigh Valley]] will want to either rent a car or drive their own.  
* Due to the fact that 7th street in Allentown is one-way, if you aim to go north to Whitehall, you will want to be on 6th street. Be forewarned, Route 145 turns off 6th Street at Greenleaf Street for one block, and then joins 7th Street (begins as two ways). Continuing on 6th will bring you to the same place, but will not carry the PA-145 designation.
* Hamilton Street is a continuation of US 222/ Hamilton Boulevard and provides easy access for travelers from Reading & Lancaster. Hamilton Street continues into nearby [[Bethlehem]] as Hanover Avenue, providing direct access to its downtown as well.
* Tilghman Street is also a useful east-west urban thoroughfare that also provides access to [[Bethlehem]], as Union Boulevard, and [[Easton]] as well.
* US Route 22 is a 4 lane limited-access freeway across the north side of the city, and is often the best route of approach.  However, this road is prone to minor traffic jams and accidents, especially during rush hour.  Don't panic, though; most traffic jams are only a mile or so long, and usually take less than half an hour before opening up into freer travel.
* Interstate 78 is a better bet during rush hours as it is as wide as eight lanes in some areas.

===By bike===
Riding a bike can also get you around in Allentown and its fabulous park system.

Allentown is a city.  When you ride it and park it, make sure you '''lock it'''. A '''Bike Line of Allentown''' will rent bikes.[http://www.bikeline.com/]  
Little Lehigh Parkway and Jordan Creek Park are accessible to pedal through.  Cyclists can access a trail head at Canal Park to get on the Tow Path to take them to Bethlehem and Easton.

Allentown is known for its extensive trail and park systems.  Of special interest to visitors will be the Bridle Path in Lehigh Parkway (stop to feed the fish in the Fish Hatchery, go to the Museum of Indian Culture or pedal along a trail that takes you to a covered bridge).

===On foot===
The main Allentown downtown area is small and easy to walk. You may want to park your car in one of the many garages and walk downtown.

==Stay safe==
Much of the crime in Allentown is gang related, so it is advisable to avoid poor neighborhoods and housing projects. Active gangs in the city include 18th Street, Black Dragons, Bloods, Crips, Latin Kings, Los Solidos, Mexican Mafia, GGU and MS-13. Thus, graffiti is very widespread.

In 2006, Allentown had 16 murders, 42 rapes, and 6059 property crimes. The crime index was 6667.5 per 100,000 in 2006, while the national average was only 4479.3. Allentown has a crime rate almost twice the national average in every category, including rape, robbery, theft, auto theft, murder, assault, and burglary. Rougher areas include parts of East Allentown and some neighborhoods of Center City north of Linden St. and south of Tilghman St., as well as the area between the American Parkway and Lehigh River, just east of Center City. Random acts of violence and crime against visitors is rare - much of the crime in the area involves people involved in drugs, gangs, or other illicit activities. It would be unwise to try to buy drugs or other contraband in the city.

It is fairly easy to stay safe by following common sense. Theft is an issue, so be sure to lock cars and stay out of poorer areas at night. Prostitution and street racing are also issues in Allentown. Don't walk alone late at night or on dimly lit streets. The most likely victim of a mugging on an Allentown street is someone who is alone and intoxicated, so keep your wits about you. If homeless approach you for change, just keep walking if you don't want to give anything. Pick-pocketing is not a large problem, but don't flash around your money.

There is a large police presence in the neighborhoods most frequented by visitors, especially Hamilton Street. Many officers in Center City use bicycles.

Political and cultural attitudes vary significantly between individuals, especially in the Lehigh Valley which is not LGBT friendly.

==Stay healthy==
===Hospitals===
If you are in need of medical attention, here are some hospitals in the area:

* '''Sacred Heart Hospital''' [http://www.shh.org/], 421 Chew St, Allentown, 610-776-4500
* '''Lehigh Valley Hospital - 17th Street''' [http://www.lvh.org/17thandchew], 1627 W Chew St, Allentown, 610-402-CARE
* '''Lehigh Valley Hospital - Cedar Crest''' [http://www.lvh.org/lvh/Locations/Cedar_Crest], 1200 S Cedar Crest Blvd, Allentown, 610-402-CARE
* '''St. Luke's Hospital''' [http://www.mystlukesonline.org/locations/stl-allentown-campus/index.aspx], 1736 Hamilton St, Allentown, 610-628-8300

==Respect==
As in many parts of the country, citizens may not want to share religious or political views. The city in recent years has seen an influx of Spanish speakers, mainly from Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.

==Contact==
In Allentown one must dial an area code when you place a call. Area codes in the Lehigh Valley are 610 and 484. Another overlay, 815, is planned, but is not active yet. You may still find some payphones on the street.
