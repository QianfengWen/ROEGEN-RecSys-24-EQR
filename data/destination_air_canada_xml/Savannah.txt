'''Savannah''' [http://www.savannahga.net/], the historic riverside birthplace of [[Georgia (state)|Georgia]], was settled in 1733 by British colonists led by General James Oglethorpe and Colonel William Bull.  In 1864 when General William Tecumseh Sherman  marched in, the mayor of Savannah gave Sherman's men run of the city in exchange for leaving it untorched.  As a result, Savannah is one of the few major cities in the South with antebellum charm and architecture remaining intact.  Savannah has one of the largest historic districts in the country.

Southerners joke that in [[Atlanta]], the first thing locals ask you is your business; in [[Charleston (South Carolina)|Charleston]], they ask your mother's maiden name; and in Savannah, they ask what you want to drink. It's partly that ethos that keeps the city tourism industry flourishing, along with a little help from what locals call "The Book:" ''Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil'' (also a feature film ). The local art school, Savannah College of Art and Design [http://www.scad.edu/], also keeps the city peopled with liberals and awash in accessible, affordable art.

*''' City Market''' [http://www.savannahcitymarket.com/]. City Market is a mixed use project in the northwest corner of the Historic District. The rehabilitation of the four block area began in 1985. The result is a physical facility that economically could not be replicated today. City Market has established itself as a destination for entertainment, dining, and retailing in downtown Savannah. To create an anchor attraction that would attract both tourists and Savannah residents, the developer emulated its successful Torpedo Factory project in Alexandria, Virginia and established the Art Center at City Market. This group of working studios for artists occupies approximately 19,000 square feet of space and has created an opportunity for other tenants of City Market to establish and operate viable food, entertainment, and retail businesses. In addition, City Market has three apartments and approximately 11,000 square feet of office space. The new Ellis Square opened in March of 2010 is immediately west of City Market and has an interactive fountain, information kiosk & a new underground 1100 space parking garage making it very easy to park in the heart of the historic & tourist area.

*''' River Street''' [http://riverstreetsavannah.com/], a popular cobblestone street (one way east) along the south bank of the Savannah River, is lined with numerous tourist-targeted shops and restaurants.   The sculpture of the Waving Girl is towards the east end of River Street.  The rest of the Historic District is on a bluff above the riverfront and is connected with River Street via stairs or ramps.

* '''Lucas Theatre''', [http://lucastheatre.com/]. SCAD uses it for a number of events including the Savannah Film Festival. The college’s support also allows for a wide range of community uses: the Lucas has presented top-line entertainment including opera from London and Italy, European orchestras, country stars, traveling repertory companies and film series. These events bring in an average of more than 1,000 people per week.

* '''Telfair Museum''', [http://www.telfair.org/]. The Telfair Museum of Art traces its history from 1886 when the Telfair family home opened to the public as an art museum and school. Now composed of three buildings: the original Telfair Academy of Arts and Sciences building, a National Historic Landmark; the Owens-Thomas House, also a National Historic Landmark; and the recently completed Jepson Center for the Arts.

===Great books set in Savannah===

* '''Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil''', [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_in_the_Garden_of_Good_and_Evil]. Shots rang out in Savannah's grandest mansion in the misty,early morning hours of May 2, 1981.  Was it murder or self-defense?  For nearly a decade, the shooting and its aftermath reverberated throughout this hauntingly beautiful city of moss-hung oaks and shaded squares.  John Berendt's sharply observed, suspenseful, and witty narrative reads like a thoroughly engrossing novel, and yet it is a work of nonfiction.  Berendt skillfully interweaves a hugely entertaining first-person account of life in this isolated remnant of the Old South with the unpredictable twists and turns of a landmark murder case.

====Events====
[[Image:Savannah Historic Home.jpg|thumb|One of Savannah's many historic homes]]

"College antics" are usually relegated River Street later that evening, making the day very much family friendly, and loads of kitschy fun.[http://stayinsavannah.com/st-patricks-day-savannah]

===Historic public squares===

Gen. Oglethorpe and Col. Bull laid out their new settlement in 1733 in a series of wards, in which commercial and residential buildings surround a public square.       The original four public squares were Johnson, Ellis, Telfair, and Wright.     By the mid 19th century, there were 24 public squares in Savannah.  Two squares, Elbert and Liberty, both along Montomery St., have been lost to modern construction, and a third one, Ellis, once lost, is being restored. 

* '''Calhoun Square''', Calhoun Square was laid out in 1851, one of the last squares. It is on Abercorn Street with the cross streets being Taylor and Gordon. It was named for John C. Calhoun a well known South Carolina politician and defender of slavery. Massie School and Wesley Monumental Methodist Church are on this square.

* '''Chatham Square''', Chatham Square was laid out in 1847, one of the last squares. It is on Barnard Street with the cross streets being Taylor and Gordon. It was named for William Pitt, the Earl of Chatham. On the Southeast corner of the square is Gordon Row, fifteen four story townhouses built as rental housing. The Barnard Street School, now one of the buildings of the Savannah College of Art and Design is on the Northwest corner of the square.

* '''Chippewa Square''', This square was laid out in 1815 and named for a battle in the War of 1812. In 1820, this square was a center of nighlife as the William Jay designed theater (still there although greatly altered) was on this square. The classical First Baptist Church and the Charles Cluskey designed Moses Eastman House at 17 W. McDonough are also on Chippewa. North of the square is Independent Presbyterian Church on Bull St. at Oglethorpe. The center of this square is James Edward Oglethorpe's monument.

Congress Streets, was covered by a city parking garage.  This parking garage was torn down in 2007 and is being replaced by an underground parking structure, Savannah's first, with Ellis Square restored on top.  
**On the west side of Ellis Square, the City Market complex extends for two blocks over to Franklin Square.  Ellis was the site of the Old City Market, which was demolished in the early 1950s to make way for the infamous parking garage. The loss of the Old City Market upset residents to the extent that efforts began to prevent further losses of irreplaceable buildings.

* '''Franklin Square''', This square is on Montgomery Street between Congress and Bryan Streets. It was named for Benjamin Franklin who had been the Georgia Colony's agent in London. It was laid out in 1791 and for many years the City's water tower was here so it was referred to as Water Tower or Reservoir Square.

Along with another teacher of African students, Mary Beasley, Jane DeVeauxes was a member of Second African Baptist Church on Greene Square. Jane Deveaux’s school is generally regarded as having been the longest lived, approaching 30 years, and was in existence when General Sherman arrived in late 1864.

His monument remained as done by the early colonists until it was demolished in the early 1880s to make way for a monument to William Washington Gordon. The members of the Colonial Dames in Georgia were responsible for placing a huge boulder of Georgia granite in the Southeast side of the square in memory of Tomochichi.

Savannah is called the "Hostess City of the South" and as such, there are no shortages of watering holes; from hole-in-the wall joints to upscale bars.

However, if you are uninterested in the politics of it all it is the best place in town to get an affordable drink and see locals, eccentrics and both functional and no so functional alcoholics.

There's also likely to be a healthy helping of voyeurs who've read Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.  You pay your admission at the door then wander through the street-level dance bar, trek down to the basement-level video bar for a (less noisy) change of venue, and (if your timing is right) climb one floor above street level for a view of the drag shows. There, a bevy of black and white artistes lip-synch the hits of Tina Turner, Gladys Knight, and Bette Midler. The bar is open daily 5PM to 3AM. Shows are nightly at 10:30PM and 12:30AM.

==Stay safe==

Savannah's Historic District is perfectly safe for exploring the area during the day and at night with at least one other person - normal safety precaution.  Outside the historic place, district crime is more prevalant.  While exploring the Historic District please do remember this is a tourist area and there will always be those who prey on tourists - be cautious but more so at night.  Savannah-Chatham County Police patrol the downtown area frequently on horseback and in patrol cruisers (Not as much as they used to!!). The Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD) is prominent throughout the downtown area and SCAD's Security detail frequently patrols areas near their buildings on bike and vehicle.

==Get out==
*[[Tybee Island]] - 18 miles east of Savannah, Tybee has a long sand beach, and various beachfront bars, restaurants, and hotels. Finding a hotel or parking can be difficult in the high summer season.
*[[Hilton Head]] - A lush seaside paradise across the Savannah river in [[South Carolina]]. 
*[[Skidaway Island]] - Home to Skidaway Island State Park, the University of Georgia Aquarium, and the Skidaway Institute of Oceanography.
