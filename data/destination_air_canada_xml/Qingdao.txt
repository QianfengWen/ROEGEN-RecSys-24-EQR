{{pagebanner|Qingdao Banner.jpg}}


'''Qingdao''' [http://english.qingdao.gov.cn] (青岛; ''Qīngdǎo''; also known as Tsingtao), is regarded by some Chinese as one of the most beautiful and clean cities in China.  It has a population of around 3.5 million (8 million regional) and is the largest city in [[Shandong]] Province. The name ''Qingdao'' means ''The Blue/Green Island''.  In 2012, Qingdao was named China's most livable city.

==Districts==
Qingdao City lies on the east shore of Jiaozhou Bay (胶州湾; Jiāo​zhōu​wān​) and comprises four districts from south to north:
* '''Shinan District''' (市南区; Shì​nán​qū​) &mdash; the downtown core that runs along the sea with most of the city's major hotels, attractions and beaches.
* '''Shibei District''' (市北区; Shì​běi​qū​) &mdash; sits directly north of Shinan District and contains many new major commercial and residential developments as well as the oldest parts of Qingdao in the west.
* '''Sifang District''' (四方区; Sì​fāng​qū​) &mdash; north of Shibei and contains a mix of residential, commercial and industrial areas as well a train station that is not currently used by passenger trains.
* '''Licang District''' (李沧区; Lǐ​cāng​qū​) &mdash; north of Sifang and home to Peach Blossom Tourism Spot as well as more industry.

Three Suburban districts comprise primarily coastal areas close to the city proper
* '''Laoshan District''' (崂山区; ) &mdash; southeast of downtown and home to Laoshan Mountain and some of the best beaches in the city.
* '''Chengyang District''' (城阳区; ) &mdash; north of Licang on the north shore of Jiaozhou Bay and mostly new industrial areas, but also contains a large Korean expat community, and hence many authentic Korean restaurants. The Qingdao Liuting airport is located here.
* '''Huangdao District''' (黄岛区; ) &mdash; on the southwest shore of Jiaozhou Bay and home to huge wharfs, the port area and other industry. There are also some nice beaches here.

Five Rural areas administratively part of Qingdao:
* '''Jiaozhou City''' (胶州市; ) &mdash; west of downtown.
* '''Jiaonan City''' (胶南市; ) &mdash; along the coast south of Huangdao District.
* '''Jimo City''' (即墨市; ) &mdash; north of downtown including the coast north of Laoshan District.
* '''Pingdu City''' (平度市; ) &mdash; far northwest.
* '''Laixi City''' (莱西市; ) &mdash; far northeast.

==Understand==
Qingdao is a city steeped in China's 20th century history.  It was taken as part of the Imperial German Concession of Jiaozhou Bay. Despite ongoing discussions with Chinese authorities about giving the Germans a territory, on 7 November 1897, they landed troops. Their pretext was the murder of two missionaries on 1 November of that year. 

The concession treaty was signed on 6 March 1899, for a 99-year lease.  The Germans acquired it as a relatively unimportant town of about 1,000 inhabitants. Yet by 1902, it had grown to 668 Caucasians and 15,000 Chinese.

During the colonial period, the Germans left a distinct mark on Qingdao's architecture that can still be seen in its historic center and train station.  The train station has undergone a recent overhaul that has tried to strike a balance between maintaining its colonial heritage while modernizing to be the terminus of the high speed rail line to Beijing. Many German-period buildings have been preserved as heritage monuments. It is a kind of ''Bavaria-on-the-East-China-Sea'', where they even sell Bratwurst on the street. In 1903, China's most well-known beer maker, Tsingtao brewery, was established by the new occupants homesick for [[Germany]].  

[[Japan]] occupied Qingdao on 27 August, 1914, as part of World War I, and remained until 1922.  They took the city because they were allied with the British against the Germans during World War I.  After the war, the Japanese wanted to continue to hold the city for the remainder of the German lease, and the Chinese government was going to accede.  However, protests by students in Beijing during the ''May 4th Movement'' of 1919, eventually forced them to return the city to Chinese sovereignty. In 1937, the Japanese again took Qingdao and remained until the end of World War II in 1945.  Between 1945 and 1949 the American 7th Fleet was based in Qingdao as it assisted the Kuomintang in fighting the Communist Party; the Communists took the city in 1949.  

While Qingdao has a long history, the eastern half of the city has been built since 1993, and there is no sign of it slowing down.  In 2008, it hosted the sailing events of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.  

Qingdao's early summer is quite an enjoyable season, although it can be humid near the sea shore. Late summer can become hot, while other places of Northern China start to feel cooler. The climate in late fall and winter can be harsh but snow patches can generally last no longer than a few days. Qingdao is an ideal destination if you want to combine sea-side fun with your trip to China.

Qingdao does not have swarming markets, unpredictable traffic and intense street commerce. The city is relatively clean and orderly and might give the impression of an upcoming wanna-be Singapore.

===Climate===
Qingdao lies in the transition zone between humid subtropical and humid continental climate and it is influenced by the east asian monsoon. Generally, the city experiences milder climate than the interior of the [[Shandong]] peninsula and the interior of the chinese plain, due to the maritime influence of the Yellow Sea. Winters are cold and windy, with the average January temperature being -0.5°C (31.1°F). When the northern winds become stronger temperatures might fall to around -8°C (17°F) and if they interact with rain patches, they can produce light snow. Winters isn't that bad of a season though as it isn't very cold for chinese standards and the city looks beautiful after snowfalls. Qingdao experiences almost a month-long delayed spring due to the sea influence and when summer come the weather isn't very hot. The average July temperature is 25.3°C (77.5°F) which is way cooler than the ones found throughout northern china. Also, in contrast with cities like [[Weifang]], [[Jinan]] or [[Beijing]] temperatures do not often climb above 32°C (90°F). The highest recorded temperature is 37.4°C (99.3°F), (for example the highest recorded temperature in [[Harbin]] is 38.2°C (100.3°F)). Most rainfall also falls during this period, mostly as downpours. Pollution is also not that much of an issue in the city and most days remain clear of smog. Overall there is no real best time to visit Qingdao as there are plenty of different things to see and enjoy year-round.

==Get in==

===By boat===

====Incheon====
From [[Incheon]], [[South Korea]] there are ferries three times a week operated by '''Weidong Ferries''' [http://www.weidong.com] for KRW120,000, although the ferry is only marginally cheaper than a flight (booked a couple days in advance at non-peak times) and takes significantly longer.

In October 2015, tickets from Qingdao to Incheon where discounted from 20% to 40%, depending on the day. The boat ride is very comfortable, even with cheapest tickets where you sleep in a small bunk. Make sure to take a shower in the morning: the male shower room has a hot tub!

====Shimonoseki====
There are also twice-weekly connections from [[Shimonoseki]], Japan on '''Orient Ferries''' [http://www.orientferry.co.jp/]. The trip takes over 24 hours and 2nd class one-way costs ¥12,000.  In Qingdao it is possible to buy tickets from the port on the morning of departure. The voyage is one night from Shimonoseki to Qingdao, but two nights from Qingdao to Shimonoseki.  The ferry also serves as a cargo vessel and after boarding in Qingdao, it will often take several hours to finish being loaded with cargo before it departs.

The restaurant food and drinks, snacks and souvenirs from the shop are all priced in Japanese Yen, so make sure to get some/have some left over before boarding. Japanese Yen can be purchased at the port in China, but only in dominations of ¥10,000(JPY). There are ATMs within 2 minutes walk of the port building.  The cost of most food and drink is reasonable considering you're stuck on the boat with nowhere else to buy things, but the pennywise traveller will definitely bring their own alcohol, cigarettes, and snacks (mind that there might be duties when crossing into Japan or China).

There are electrical outlets in the lounge area, but if those are taken, there are also some up in the gym/fitness area, where no one goes. If you have a cabin you'll have access to electrical outlets in the cabin. Be advised that on boarding from China, the ship operates under Japanese time, so change your watches and pay attention to announcements for when dinner will be served, as food is only served at certain times of the day.  There are Japanese-style shower/bath rooms on the upper level where the first class rooms are located (if you are nervous about naked bathing then be sure to scout the area before taking a bath to be sure it is empty).

===By plane===
The new '''Qingdao Jiaodong International Airport''' opened in August 2021 (replacing Qingdao Liuting International Airport). It is the main hub for Shandong Airlines[http://www.shandongair.com.cn/en/index.html] and a focus city of China Eastern Airlines[http://www.flychinaeastern.com/]. The flight paths linking Qingdao with Shanghai and Beijing are frequent. If you arrive in Beijing or Shanghai in the morning or in the afternoon, you even do not have to book the flight ticket to Qingdao ahead. Depending on the season, last minute tickets may be sold at discount, however this is definitely not the case during the busy summer months when buying in advance is advised.

International destinations include [[Tokyo]], [[Osaka]], [[Nagoya]], [[Seoul]] (Incheon), [[Busan]] and [[Frankfurt]] (via [[Shenyang]]). Qingdao also has flights to [[Hong Kong]] and [[Taipei]].
Asiana Airlines[http://us.flyasiana.com/Global/US/en/index] serves Qingdao twice daily from Incheon airport.

The airport is served by Qingdao Metro Line 8. The airport also has a railway station with train services on the [[Jinan]]-Qingdao high-speed railway line. For a wider range of train services, it is possible to take Metro Line 8 one stop northbound to Jiaozhoubei (Jiazhou North) railway station (胶州北) or 9 stops southbound to Qingdaobei (Qingdao North) railway station  (青岛北).

The airport is around 55 km (35 mi) from the city centre of Qingdao, around a 1 hour taxi ride.

There are various '''Airport Shuttle Bus''' routes [https://www.qdairport.com/cms/front/articlePage/187/%E4%BA%A4%E9%80%9A] (including night bus routes).

===By train===
'''Qingdao Railway Station''' (+86-532-6011111, reservations +86-532-2962777) is at 2 Tai'an Road (泰安路2号) at the west end of Shinan District. 		

Trains from major cities not too far away include:
* '''[[Beijing]]''' — The high-speed train has 10 trains per day and takes 4h20m–5h26m hours, a second class seat for ¥252–303. The high-speed line runs down from Beijing South station, not the Beijing station.

Recommended booking trains at least a couple days in advance, unless you don't mind sitting in a hard seat.

===By bus===
If you are travelling from within Shandong Province, going by bus is probably the easiest way. Especially now with the new excellent and fast expressways linking Qingdao with other cities in the province. There are several buses per day from Jinan, Taian, Qufu, as well as Yantai and Rizhao on the coast. They leave from and arrive to the bus station just outside the train station(青岛火车站旅游长途汽车站,Qingdao Railway Station Tourist Bus Station), but also from the new bus station north of town, which can be reached by local trolleybus number 5 in 20 minutes.

===Visa information===
Qingdao officials have been known to sweep bars. To avoid trouble, you should keep your passport and visa with you at all times. It is advisable to keep copies of your passport information page and visa in a safe place at your hotel or hostel.

==Get around==

===By taxi===

As of December 2010, the meter rate for normal taxis starts at ¥9 while the larger cabs start at ¥12, plus a ¥1 surcharge due to rising petrol prices. The meter is based on both distance traveled and time taken. If you take a taxi to or from the airport, and use the Qingyin expressway there will be a ¥10 rate added to whatever the meter price is.

During the summer months that are the peak tourist season, taxis may be hard to flag down. If ever you get one of the larger taxis, the drivers will usually be delighted to give you their business card, so that in the case of planned travel to somewhere like the airport or train station, you can avoid the hassle of trying to flag down a cab.

===By Metro===
Qingdao commenced building its metro network in late 2009. The first line, Line 3, comprises 22 stations running 25.1km from Qingdao Station (青岛站), passing May 4th Square and terminating at Qingdao North Station (青岛北站). Phase I from Qingdao North Station to Shuangshan Station (双山站,) opened in December 2015, one year behind schedule, with the rest of the line opening in December 2016. 

Line 2 began construction in 2012 and was to be finished by 2016, though now scheduled to open on October 28, 2017. Phase I of the line will run from Zhiquanlu Station (芝泉路站) to Licungongyuan Station (李村公园站) (18 stations, two transfers to Line 3).

===By bus===
The bus and trolleybus network is quite well put together and useful once you figure out the routes. Buses 11, 26, 228, and 501 run from the railway station (Shinan Distict) along the coast via Donghai Xi Lu to all the beaches in the modern eastern part of town (Middle Hong Kong Road), where pubs and cafes are located. Many major routes have dedicated bus lanes, that can make taking the bus faster than taking a car during rush hour. Buses 316 and 231 will bring you to the center of the town from the newly renovated station. Regular buses cost ¥1 and the air conditioned ones are ¥2. If you get on a bus that goes really far (out to the suburbs) you need to tell the ticket person on the bus where you are going and it will cost up to ¥6.

===By cycling===
Very few locals in Qingdao cycle because it is illegal on streets and sidewalks. When renting a bike make sure that it is legal to ride your planned route.  There are more than 40km of waterfront trails.  If you really want a work out, try hiking Fushan or the TV Tower hills as there are some decent mountain bike trails.

===Beaches===
Qingdao has some wonderful beaches worthy of visiting. Unfortunately, litter is a problem at all of them, ranging from the occasional cigarette butt to having to wade through a flotsam of trash just to get into the ocean itself. Your experience will vary depending on the tides and the time of year you visit. During summer weekends, Qingdao city beaches are very crowded (sometimes upwards of 100,000 people), and slightly less crowded on summer weekdays. Again, these can be packed full of people during the weekends. Bring sunscreen, while you can buy beach toys, food, drinks, and knick-knacks at any of Qingdao's beaches, surprisingly no one sells sunscreen at the beach itself.  You can find bathing beaches all along the seaside from the Zhanqiao Pier to the Shilaoren Beach in the eastern suburbs.

===International Beer Festival===

Qingdao International Beer Festival, held in the second half of July and all of August every year, is a celebration of Qingdao's brewing heritage. During the daytime, there are official ceremonies that celebrate Qingdao's heritage as well as carnival type rides, food and games. In the evening, the event really picks up as crowds flock to huge tents set up by each beer company with a presence in China. 
One can sit down and order beer, hard cider or snacks. The price of food at night during the festival may be beyond budgets of some.
One can also watch (or participate in) various performances such as karaoke, concerts, auctions, or comedy. The entertainment itself is tame and bland. Performances include dancers up on the walls of buildings, a circus, and various musicians around the grounds.  
The International Beer Festival, unfortunately, has only a small international presence save the beer. Much of what you see now can be found at any Chinese carnival, park or civic celebration.  Parking is extremely limited, so public transportation or taxi is recommended.

* <do name="Huangdao" alt="黄岛" address="" directions="" phone="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">A new bridge and a new tunnel both opened in 2011 linking Qingdao and Hunagdao.  Tunnel buses are available. The city has mostly been built in the last 10-15 years. There are plenty of Japanese hostess bars, and a few Western drinking holes too, if you get tired of Qingdao's fare. Providing there isn't persistent fog as is often in the area, one can take a ferry from Qingdao port to the neighbouring district of Huangdao. The ferry prices generally range from ¥15-30 one way, but be advised that if the ferries aren't running the taxi fare is 200RMB+ back to Qingdao. Bus 1 (or Tunnel Bus) travels from QingDao to HuangDao in about an hour for 1 yuan.  It starts at Qingdao bus station, and there are several each hour.  Buses stop running relatively early, around 9:30 p.m.  Buses use cash/coin or bus card (refillable).
  There is some interesting shopping in Huangdao, from night markets, shopping malls and an underground shopping area which is half flea market and half formal shops.  Qi Great Wall, located at the end of the route of Bus 6, is older than the Great Wall of China, but the small piece of wall standing in Huangdao is not impressive.  
Phoenix Theatre has been built with weekly live performances from comedy to kids shows, classical music and Chinese plays.  Tickets cost from 50 RMB to 880 RMB depending on the show/seating.  The acoustics of this new beautiful building are world class; and its location at one end of Golden Beach, make a great tourist venue.  Extra parking and a fountain have been added.  The theatre itself is a great curved wing shape, and at night is lit with a light show and video screens which are dazzling.  Carnival-like additions around the theatre include 3D videos, bumper cars, various junk food offerings, music, rent-a-robot, and a 25 m2 blow-up sandcastle for children to jump, wall climb and enjoy.  
Wanda Mall opened in 2018, which includes an indoor water park, overpriced shopping opportunities, an indoor carnival ride area, movie theatres, and a complete floor of restaurant choices on the top floor.

==Drink==
Being Qingdao, you can expect to find, well, copious amounts of fresh Tsingtao. The brewery was founded by Germans during colonial times. Every August there is a beer festival (check the listing in the "Do" section). Many European breweries participate. One of the neatest things about Qingdao is the ability to purchase fresh from the factory draft beer almost anywhere. You will often see kegs sitting outside most restaurants and snack stores. The beer is sold by weight (asking for "yi jin" gives you 500 g, or half a litre), this will be served to you in a plastic bag! There are also numerous beer gardens where you can sit and drink from glasses, one glass of fresh beer ("san pi") only costs an incredible ¥1.5. The Tsingtao "san pi" is some of the best Chinese beer you can get. Don't worry, it's served cold.

Qingdao's nightlife scene continues to evolve. The Jiangxi Rd. strip located downtown near Hong Kong Middle Rd. continues to have more and more bars. There is also a new development called Zhonglian Plaza (中联广场) located at Nanjing Rd and Ningxia Rd, that offers many large Chinese-style clubs. Karaoke (KTV) is very popular activity amongst the locals. There are a few western style club/discos in the Hong Kong Road area close to the Jusco. Thanks to the very large Korean expat population, there are many Korean style bars. Most of these bars can be found in the Hong Kong Gardens area.

==Stay safe==

Generally, Qingdao is a very safe city although the general travel advisories such as keeping your bag close, not flashing large amounts of money and using common sense are always advised. Violent crime or serious thievery is not a common problem.

Beware of the many taxi drivers who wait outside the bus stations and the train station, and prey on ignorant travelers, both Chinese and foreigner. Often these drivers have no taxi license, even if they have an official-looking taxi cab. These drivers can be very aggressive and will almost always try to rip you off by fixing prices and taking the longest route to your destination or by just driving circles on the highway. If you are not familiar with the city, then you would have no idea they are taking detours, and you could end up spending more than 100 yuan to get to your destination. Also, you should never let a taxi driver set a price to take you to your destination. Make sure the driver uses his meter. Make sure he is wearing an official taxi uniform and that the photo on the dashboard is his photo, not some other man's mugshot. The safest way to get a trustworthy cab driver is to wait for a taxi to pull up to the station and drop off another traveler, then hop into that taxi before it drives away. Otherwise it would be wise to walk several blocks away from any station before catching a taxi cab.

Also, be wary about buying Xinjiang nut loaves from vendors along the boardwalk near the Zhan Bridge unless you don't mind paying RMB200 for 2kg of the loaves when all you wanted was a small piece to try. If you must buy them, make sure you agree on the price for each liang (the unit of measurement) of the loaf before you get the vendor to slice it. Also, tell him exactly how many liangs you want, although some tourists have commented that the vendors will still cut a much bigger slice than what you asked for.

==Contact==

There is a small tourist information kiosk located close to the main rail station. Whilst exiting, turn right and walk through the plaza, crossing the street, then turn left to the corner where you will see a small kiosk. It's located near KFC. There is a tourist complaint hotline, which is 8591-2000.

The main post office is located at 8 Anhui Lu, and branches can be found throughout the city. Opening hours at the main post office is 8:00 am to 6:00 pm.

==Get out==
===Laoshan===

Located a 60 min bus ride east of downtown, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Lao Laoshan] (Mount Lao)  boasts a 2100-year-old Dao temple (Taiqing Gong) and is a must see for the Qingdao area. Often credited with being one of the temples that gave birth to the Dao way of thought, the Laoshan temple is tucked just between the mountains and beach. You can wander the temples or take one of the many paths winding up and around the mountains to enjoy the view, see waterfalls or listen to the tales of the ancient snake and other phenomena that haunt the Laoshan area.

Bus 304 can be used when travel to Laoshan from Qingdao. The bus can be boarded at the train station close to the west side of beach no. 6 and will take you to the parking lot of Laoshan's main entrance. The bus trip from the train station to the terminal bus stop will cost about ¥12. During the day, there are taxis waiting in the parking lot, which would cost about ¥60 going back to town.

From the main entrance, there are mandatory shuttle busses to the main sights. The bus to Taiqing Gong is ¥130 (including admission to Laoshan, but excluding another ¥20 for the temple) and makes three more stops at various resort sites. Another bus takes you to the JuFeng Qu cableway station for ¥95 (including admission to Laoshan, but excluding another ¥40 for the oneway cableway ride). From the top station starts a beautiful, but strenous three hour hiking loop (mostly stairs), which takes in the beautiful mountain scenery including caves, ancient gates and temples and a suspension bridge.
