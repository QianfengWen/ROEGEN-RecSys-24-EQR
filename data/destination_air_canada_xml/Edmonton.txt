'''Edmonton''' [http://www.edmonton.ca] is the capital city of [[Alberta]], [[Canada]] and has a [[Edmonton Capital Region|metro area]] population of 1,516,719 people.[https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1710013501] Edmonton is famous for its beautiful river valley park system, the North Saskatchewan River Valley, which offers over 100 kilometers of recreational trails, wildlife viewing, and city views. The river valley also contains many parks, including Fort Edmonton Park, which is Canada's largest historical park. If the great outdoors is not your target, the city also offers West Edmonton Mall, the largest shopping mall in Canada and the second largest in the Western Hemisphere. On top of that, Edmonton has a vibrant theater community, a busy cycle of annual festivals, national sports teams that are active year-round, and wonderful winter recreational opportunities.

===History===

The area around Edmonton, which sits to the south of the geographic centre of the province, was home to native populations for thousands of years before the arrival of European settlers. In 1795, a trading post called Edmonton House was constructed and work on Fort Edmonton began. The original site was near Fort Saskatchewan but was relocated near the present day Legislature in 1830.

The town developed around the fur trade and in the early days there was little to distinguish it from other such settlements in the area. The first hotel and hospital were built in the 1870s. The latter part of the century saw an influx of wealthy families and in 1892 the Town of Edmonton was officially founded. 

Early developments were centered around the Quarters area. In 1905, Edmonton was declared the capital of the province of [[Alberta]], and a year later it was designated a city. The 1907-1914 period saw the city experience an unprecedented boom with the population rising from around 6,000 to 78,000. During this period, the University of Alberta was founded.

In 1947 oil was discovered just outside of Edmonton in Leduc county, which spurred a second period of growth, leading to urban sprawl and the development of US-style malls. The Royal Alberta Museum opened in 1967. Today, Edmonton is the hub for energy development and petrochemicals processing in Canada. As well, it has become a centre of excellence in research through the University of Alberta and high technology industries like the National Institute for Nanotechnology.

If you want to spend time outdoors, the summer months offer the most opportunities for recreation and entertainment. In the summer, Edmonton offers great outdoor festivals, street entertainment, open-air concerts, and many other world-class entertainment opportunities. Winter also offers many recreational opportunities including snow sports for the outdoorsy, extensive indoors shopping in the many malls, live sports, theater, and music throughout the city.

Edmonton's climate is "northern continental", with a wide range of weather over all four distinct seasons. Edmonton receives 2,300 hours of sunshine per year, making it one of Canada's sunniest cities. Rainfall is low to moderate and entire weeks can pass without clouds or precipitation through the late spring and summer. Bright green foliage appears in May, signaling spring. Even as the city shakes off its winter chill, cold snaps and the occasional snowfall can still occur in Spring. The region's golf courses are generally open by this time.

Summer days generally bring daytime highs of between 21 to 25°C (70 to 77°F) in June, July, and August. Temperatures can rise to over 30°C (85°F) for periods of time. Thunderstorms are possible during the summer months, usually in the evening. Humidity is relatively low so warm days are more comfortable than they are in humid climates. At the height of summer, Edmonton enjoys more than 17 hours of daylight, with twilight extending past 11PM in June and July.

Fall starts in mid September, bringing bright yellow and orange foliage to Edmonton's treed neighborhoods and river valley parks. This season ushers in cooler temperatures ranging between 10 to 20°C for highs during the day. 

Winters are long, but not as harsh as those further east on the Canadian Prairies. Periods of mild temperatures with daytime highs over 0°C (32°F) can occur in even the coldest parts of the winter. Such mild weather makes outdoor winter sports extremely popular with the locals. Stop by a local outdoor ice rink to catch the fever of children and adults alike taking part in community hockey. Colder days in Edmonton are kept reasonably comfortable by the low humidity index, but it's wise to have some lip balm and hand cream with you, as the skin and lips can get cracked and chapped quickly in this dry environment. 

Winter walking and driving are not often affected. Cold snaps with temperatures down to -30°C (-22F) can occur during the winter, although it's unusual for these frigid spells to last more than 1 or 2 days. Extremely cold temperatures are usually accompanied by the crisp blue skies and bright sunshine of a prairie high-pressure zone. Even regular winter temperatures can feel very cold if there is a noticeable wind. So if you are visiting between December and February, be prepared.

==Get in==

===By plane===

Most major airlines service Edmonton. General travel times to Edmonton are 40 minutes from [[Calgary]], 85 minutes from [[Vancouver]], 4 hours from [[Toronto]], and 4.5 hours from [[Montreal]]. Edmonton's main airport is Western Canada's hub to the Canadian North. 

* '''Edmonton International Airport''' ({{IATA|YEG}}), [http://www.edmontonairports.com]. Edmonton International is located 10 km south of Edmonton in Leduc County. Edmonton International Airport is one of the fastest growing large airports in Canada with a new parkade, services, terminals, planes, hotels, and on-site shopping. It has two terminals including a terminal for US travelers (including US customs clearance) and a terminal for domestic and non-US international traffic. Public transit includes a bus that runs every 30 minutes from the airport to the Century Park LRT station. Fares cost $5 one-way [http://www.flyeia.com/ground-transportation/eia-express-route-747.aspx]. An '''airport shuttle''' travels between the airport and downtown at an affordable cost ($15 one way; $25 return). Taxi and Uber service is also available and costs around $60 one-way. The drive between Edmonton International Airport and Downtown Edmonton takes about 25 minutes. Allow extra time during the morning and afternoon rush hours. Car rental companies are located in the airport parkade for easy pick-up and return.

There are fifteen airlines that service the Edmonton International Airport. The largest are the following:

:*'''WestJet''', [http://www.westjet.com]. A Western Canadian-based airline that services most major Canadian cities as well as several US, Mexico, and Caribbean destinations.
:*'''Air Canada''', [http://www.aircanada.ca]. A national carrier with an extensive network out of the Edmonton International Airport.
:*'''Flair Airlines''', [http://www.flyflair.com]. An Edmonton-based discount airline with destinations throughout Canada and the United States.
:*'''Swoop Airlines''', [http://www.flyswoop.com]. A discount airline owned by WestJet. Several Canadian and US destinations.

To Europe, Edmonton has daily service to [[Amsterdam]] on KLM and [[Frankfurt]] on Condor Airlines. To the United States, Edmonton has scheduled departures to nine United States airports including [[Denver]], [[Las Vegas]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Minneapolis]], [[Orlando]], [[Palm Springs]], [[Phoenix]], [[Seattle]], and [[San Francisco]].

Edmonton International Airport also has seasonal charter service to [[Acapulco]], [[Huatulco]], [[Cancun]], [[Ixtapa]], [[Honolulu]], [[Kahului]], [[Liberia (Costa Rica)]], [[Mazatlán]], [[Montego Bay]], [[Nashville]], [[Orlando]], [[Palm Springs]], [[Phoenix]], [[Punta Cana]], [[Puerto Vallarta]], [[San Jose del Cabo]], and [[Varadero]].

===By car===

Edmonton is the largest city on the Yellowhead branch (Alberta Highway 16) of the Trans-Canada Highway system. Edmonton is 3 hours north of [[Calgary]] on the divided Queen Elizabeth II Highway (formerly Highway 2) and 3.5 hours east of [[Jasper]] on Highway 16. It is also 3 hours west of [[Lloydminster]] on the Saskatchewan border. These highways are broad and safe for travel during day or night and also during all times of the year. There are numerous places to stop for meals or refuelling.

From [[Vancouver]], Edmonton is best accessed using Highway 1 (the Trans-Canada) east to Hope, then Highway 5 (the Coquihalla) north through [[Kamloops]] to the Highway 16 junction near Tete Jaune Cache. The average travel time in summer is approximately 12 hours. Winter travel from Vancouver can take longer and highways are sometimes shut during snowstorms. Travel from [[Saskatoon]] will take about 5 hours away using the Yellowhead Highway, which is divided for the entire route between the two cities.

===By bus===

'''Ebus''', [https://www.myebus.ca], affiliated company of Red Arrow Motorcoach, runs economical coach service between Edmonton and Calgary (daily) and Fort McMurray (weekly). Through its partners, its network also reaches to Kamloops (twice weekly) and Saskatoon (5 times a week)

'''Red Arrow Motorcoach''' [http://www.redarrow.pwt.ca/home/index.php], affiliated company of Ebus, offers a premium service between Edmonton and Calgary, Red Deer, and Fort McMurray. It features spacious seating (only three seats to a row) and workstation seats with electrical connections for business travelers and their computers.

'''Rider Express''', [https://riderexpress.ca] also runs economical coach services between Edmonton and Calgary (daily), Fort McMurray (twice weekly), Saskatoon, and Regina (daily),

===By train===

'''VIA Rail''', The Via Rail station in Edmonton is located at 12360 - 121 Street NW, [http://www.viarail.ca/]. It provides daily passenger train service from Edmonton to several major cities along the Canadian National Railroad including west to [[Vancouver]] and east to [[Saskatoon]], [[Winnipeg]], [[Toronto]], and [[Montréal]]. The VIA train station is located approximately five kilometers northeast from Downtown Edmonton ($12 by taxi or Uber). [[VIA Rail]] prices are more expensive than train travel in Europe, Asia, or the United States because it is intended more as a leisure activity than for commuter passengers. Travel by train to the west over the Rocky Mountains is particularly scenic with snow covered mountains, gorgeous valleys, and green/blue lakes. Service on a VIA Rail is significantly superior to bus because you can get up and walk around the carriages, dine conveniently, find plenty of legroom, and comfortable seats.

==Get around==
[[Image:JasperEdmonton.JPG|thumb|right|Jasper Avenue is at the heart of downtown Edmonton.]]
Most central parts of the city, which were planned during the middle part of the 20th Century, are laid out in a grid pattern of straight streets. This makes for easy navigation by car or foot. The river valley can be an impediment to vehicular travel but numerous bridges help this situation.

===By car===

Due to the lack of traffic congestion and the spread-out nature of the suburbs, most adult Edmonton residents own a vehicle. Compared to other cities around the world, Edmonton drivers are generally polite, slow, and relatively timid. As such, visitors can drive in the city with minimal stress. Use of the horn and hazard lights are very infrequent. Driving is on the right side of the road in North America.

Pedestrians are provided with a high level of respect in Edmonton. Drivers from larger cities in other countries may be surprised to see that cars stop to allow pedestrians to cross even on busy roadways regardless of their right to cross at that point. This has emboldened pedestrians, who may not look both ways to cross at an uncontrolled corner during busy times. As such, if you are driving, be wary of pedestrians standing along the side of the road. They may make a move without warning. Bicycles are also treated with an elevated level of respect so give them a wider berth than usual.

====Highways====

Edmonton is less congested than most cities with a population over 1.5 million. Full stoppage is rare but traffic jams can occur during rush hour near bridges and major arterial roadways.

There is an "outer" ring road known as Anthony Henday Drive. It completely circles Edmonton near the city limits, making it a convenient route for commuters around the perimeter and those passing through. There are no traffic lights on Anthony Henday Drive and access is provided almost exclusively from highway overpasses.

An informal "inner" ring road is also situated within Edmonton. This consists of Whitemud Drive NW (south), 170th Street NW (west), Yellowhead Trail NW (north), and 75th Street NW/Wayne Gretzky Drive NW (east). These are the easiest routes through the middle parts of the city, although they can get a little congested during rush hour. Whitemud Drive has no traffic lights and the city is in the process of removing the last traffic lights from Yellowhead Trail, which should be complete by around 2024. 170th Street NW and 75th Street NW are still traffic light controlled.

The main highways into and out of Edmonton include Highway 2 to the south (Calgary Trail/Gateway Boulevard in the city), Highway 16 to the east and west (Yellowhead Trail in the city), and Highway 2 to the north (St. Albert Trail in the city).

===By taxi===

The most prominent cab companies include:
* '''Astro Taxi''', 780-467-2222 , [http://astrotaxi.ca/].
* '''Barrel Taxi''', 780-489-7777, [http://www.edmtaxi.com/].
* '''Capital Taxi''', 780-423-2425, [http://capitaltaxiedmonton.com/]
* '''Co-op Taxi''', 780-425-2525,  [http://www.co-optaxi.com/].
* '''Flat Rate Cabs''', 780-469-4222, [http://www.sherwoodparkcabs.ca/].
* '''Prestige Cab / Checker Cab''', 780-484-8888, [http://www.edmtaxi.com/]. 
* '''Taxi Sherwood Park''', 780-464-1500 , [https://taxisherwoodpark.com/].
* '''Yellow Cab''', 780-462-3456, [http://www.edmtaxi.com/].

All Edmonton taxi companies offer 24/7 service. From the last weekend in November to New Year's Eve on weekends, Operation Red Nose offers cab rides for drivers who have been partying and prefer not to drive themselves (780-421-4444).

===By ridesharing===

Uber has operated in the city for many years and is used more frequently than taxis. Lyft is not yet available in Edmonton.

===By public transit===
[[Image:Metro LRT Map-1.png|thumb|Edmonton's LRT map, click to enlarge.]]
Edmonton has a safe, efficient and inexpensive public transportation system: the Edmonton Transit System [http://www.takeets.com/]. Hundreds of different bus routes cover the city, traveling nearly anywhere you need to go.

During peak hours, buses run as frequently as every 15 minutes. Outside of peak, the frequency drops to every 30 minutes and on some routes to industrial areas or far-flung suburbs as infrequent as one service per hour. Many major bus routes will operate as early as 5AM to as late as 1AM, but many stop running by 9PM or only run only during peak hours (6AM-9AM and 3PM-6PM). Some bus routes do not run on Sundays. For more information or to plan your bus trip, you can call Transit Information at 780-442-5311, check out the Trip Planner [http://coewebapps.edmonton.ca/external/transit3/TripPlannerAdvanced.aspx], or use Google Maps. For where routes go and their route numbers, go to [http://www.edmonton.ca/transportation/ets/route-schedules-and-maps.aspx]. Edmonton's transit system is not unified with those of the nearby communities, so if you wish to visit the suburbs be prepared for more transfers and increased fares.

Edmonton was the first North American city with a population of under 1 million to have developed a Light Rail Transit (LRT) [http://www.edmontonslrt.com/] system. It is a part of the Edmonton Transit System (ETS), which also manages the buses. The track stretches from Clareview Station in the northeast section of the city to the Century Park Station, which goes past the University of Alberta main and South Campuses. A second line extends from NAIT in North Edmonton to Century Park Station. An extension to Millwoods in Southeast Edmonton is planned for opening 2023 and construction on a line to West Edmonton Mall is underway. During peak hours on weekdays, LRT trains run every 6 minutes. Outside of that and on Saturdays, frequency is every 7 to 12 minutes, depending on the time of day. Sundays and holidays, trains run every 15 minutes throughout the day. Trains operate from about 5:26AM to 1:26AM. On Sundays and holidays, the LRT stops running past 12:26AM.

Fares are $3.20 with children under 6 riding free. Day passes can be bought for $8.25 regardless of age group. A pack of 10 tickets can be purchased for $22.00 (adults). Tickets can be purchased at the ETS online store, automated fare vending machines located at all LRT stations, or at the ETS Customer Information Centre located on the pedway level of Churchill Station. Bus drivers and station staff are always happy to help.

===By bicycle===

Edmonton has excellent cycling routes which allow for all-year cycling, though winter cycling can be challenging for those unaccustomed to Edmonton weather. These marked routes, combined with a lack of freeways to traverse and relatively low traffic compared to other major cities, low snow or rainfall, and a fairly flat terrain, make Edmonton an easy city to travel by bicycle. The City of Edmonton provides free maps [http://www.edmonton.ca/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_0_288_222_0_43/http%3B/CMSServer/COEWeb/roads+and+traffic/cycling+in+the+city/where+to+ride/] of the bike routes.

===Finding addresses===

100th Street NW and 100th Avenue NW are located in Downtown Edmonton. Increasing street numbers mean that you are travelling west. Increasing avenue numbers mean that you are travelling north. Almost all new neighborhoods are designed with more curves, cul-de-sacs, and named streets. If visiting these newer areas, a current city map or GPS is highly recommended. When it comes to addresses, the vast majority of the city is technically located in the NW quadrant. Many residents drop the "NW" for these addresses. As the city has grown, however, there is increasing use of SW, SE, and NE in address that fall to the extreme south and east.

Addresses follow a regular system throughout Edmonton. Even-numbered address numbers are on the north side of avenues and west side of streets. The first two or three digits of a building or house number identify the street it lies just west of or the avenue it lies north of. For example, 10219 - 101 Street NW would be located on the east side of 101 Street NW just north of 102 Avenue NW.

==See==
There is plenty to see and do in Edmonton. The following list includes some of the more popular attractions:

A must-see when in Edmonton. See [[Edmonton/West End|West End]].

*'''Fort Edmonton Park'''. [https://www.fortedmontonpark.ca/] Fort Edmonton Park is Canada's largest living history museum. Join the costumed historical interpreters at and try your hand at living life as an early pioneer. You'll experience life as it was at the 1846 fort and on the streets of 1885, 1905, and 1920. See [[Edmonton/South|South]] 

*'''Elk Island National Park'''. [https://parks.canada.ca/pn-np/ab/elkisland] With the exception of the Serengeti Plains of Africa, Elk Island National Park has higher densities of hoofed mamals per square kilometer than any other wild area in the world. It is located less than 20 minutes east of Edmonton on the Yellowhead Highway. Visitors can see over 40 species of mammals including plains and wood bison, elk, and moose plus over 250 species of birds. Elk Island National Park protects the wilderness of aspen parkland. Open year-round, park visitors can enjoy hiking, canoeing, kayaking, sailing, cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, golfing, camping, and more.

*'''Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Village'''. [https://ukrainianvillage.ca/] The award-winning Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Village is located 25 minutes east of Edmonton along Highway 16 or 3 kilometers east of Elk Island National Park. This provincial historic site showcases Ukrainian settlements in East-Central Alberta. There are over 30 historic buildings including three churches, a fully-functioning grain elevator, blacksmith shop, and sod hut.  You can explore the buildings in the town while costumed workers portray Ukrainian settlers. They re-tell stories based on real accounts of early settlers. They go about the everyday events like baking bread (which you can taste), tending to the gardens, working the blacksmith shop, etc.  There are often special events with performances and agricultural shows. The weekends are busier but the crowds can be worth it with more interpreters on hand and often more things are going on to see. The trip can take a good part of a day including travel from Edmonton. 

*'''Aurora Borealis'''. The Northern Lights are less frequently visible in Edmonton than in the Northwest Territories or Yukon. However, they are still visible somewhat frequently from outside the city limits and usually during colder months. You can increase your chances of viewing this impressive natural display by downloading phones apps that track them.

===North Saskatchewan River Valley===

The Edmonton North Saskatchewan River Valley river valley is the longest expanse of urban parkland in North America. It contains more than 7,400 hectares, which is 22 times the size of New York’s Central Park. The river valley is mostly undeveloped but also contains several golf courses, 22 major parks, and over 160 kilometers of multi-use trails for walking, cross-country skiing, cycling, and more. Several attractions are located in the river valley including Fort Edmonton Park, the Valley Zoo, and the Muttart Conservatory. One of the most popular parks is Hawrelak Park, which is located just off Groat Road near the University of Alberta. It encircles a large pond, which is the summer home to a variety of ducks and geese. Hawrelak Park is the site of several Edmonton festivals, including Shakespeare in the Park and Symphony Under the Sky. In winter, it is a popular venue for outdoor ice skating, cross-country skiing, and ice sculpting.

===Architecture===

[[Image:Churchpres.JPG|thumb|right|One of Edmonton's many historic churches.]]

Edmonton is a relatively young city and therefore its historic structures are usually less than 100 years old. The City of Edmonton's '''Municipal Historic Resources''' includes a list of buildings or structures that have been designated by Bylaw as buildings or structures which are legally protected from demolition and from inappropriate changes and alterations. [https://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/edmonton_archives/historic-resources]. Built from 1907 to 1912, the province's foremost historic structure is the Alberta Legislature. This building is set amidst beautiful gardens and water displays. Inside and out, the Legislature offers a rich experience in exploring Alberta’s past and present as the focal point of the province’s democratic process.

For events specific to a particular week, you can reference Things To Do In Canada [https://www.todocanada.ca/things-to-do-in-edmonton-this-weekend/] for nightclub, theatre, family, and sporting events. Facebook is also a great source of information for Edmonton events and activities.

===Festivals===

===Recreation===

[[Image:Edmonton River Valley.jpg|Edmonton River Valley|thumb|right|Edmonton River Valley.]]
Edmonton's river valley and Mill Creek area have an extensive network of trails that are good for '''walking''', '''biking''', and '''cross-country skiing'''. At many points in the extensive ravines and forested areas in the river valley,  you can't even tell you're in a city.  Maps are published by the City of Edmonton [http://www.edmonton.ca/transportation/cycling_walking/cycling-walking-maps.aspx][http://www.edmonton.ca/attractions_recreation/sport_recreation/crosscountry-skiing.aspx] and are available at City Hall, Edmonton Tourism's Visitor Information Centres, and many bicycle and ski shops.

The Edmonton Bicycle Commuters' Society (EBC), a non-profit bicycle co-op [http://edmontonbikes.ca/], operates a staffed drop-in DIY workshop where rental bicycles are available.  During the summer months, at River Valley Adventures [http://www.rivervalleyadventure.com/our-services/bike-rentals] rents bicycles and operates Segway tours.  Fun group rides occur during the summer, mostly organized by the Edmonton Bicycle and Touring Club (EBTC) [http://www.bikeclub.ca] and EBC.  Most commercial bike shops organize training rides for those road cyclists who are interested in higher intensity workouts.  Larger commercial bike shops include United Cycle, Western Cycle, and Revolution Cycle.  Smaller ones include Velocity Cycle, Redbike, Hardcore Mountain Bikes, PedalHead Bikes, and Transition BMX.

Edmonton has small downhill ski hills in or near the city, including the Edmonton Ski Club, the Sunridge Ski Area, and Snow Valley. Natural and artificial snow cover their slopes from early winter to early spring, offering city skiers an easy way to learn, amuse families, and tone up for the big Rocky Mountain ski opportunities in Jasper and Banff.

===Golf===

Albertans are keen golfers and there is a large number of developed courses that can played at relatively low prices. Within city limits, the City of Edmonton operates three public courses, including Canada's oldest municipal golf course Victoria ([[Edmonton/Central|central]]) and the picturesque Riverside Club ([[Edmonton/East|South]]). Both of these courses are located close to Downtown (though difficult to access without a vehicle). There is also the par-three Rundle Park ([[Edmonton/North]]) and Kinsmen courses for beginners. There are over 50 golf courses located in the Edmonton region.

===Spectator sports===

Edmonton is home to a number of professional and amateur sport teams. The '''Edmonton Oilers''' of the National Hockey League are the most recognized team and have won 5 Stanley Cups. They play at Rogers Place, which was completed Downtown in 2016 and has a capacity of 18,347. Minor league hockey is also part of the Edmonton sports scene with the Edmonton Oil Kings of the Western Hockey League.

Casinos are relatively easy to access in Alberta compared to most locations in the world. You can start playing without showing identification, you can drink alcohol while you play, and you can even smoke at the River Cree Casino. About half of bars and nightclubs in Metro Edmonton also have VLTs, which are similar to casino slot machines but are generally less sophisticated and require cash-in with a bartender or server.

[[Image:Whyte_Avenue.jpg|thumb|right|Trendy Whyte Avenue in Old Strathcona.]]

Edmonton has a wide variety of shopping areas from arts-oriented streets to large shopping centres.

*'''West Edmonton Mall''' (in '''[[Edmonton/West End|West End]]''') is the second largest shopping centre in the Western Hemisphere and therefore should be on any shopping agenda. It is located at 8882 - 170 Street NW in the far west end of Edmonton. West Edmonton Mall includes over 800 shops plus a wide array of entertainment and recreation options. Pretty much any style can be found here including high-end shops like Gucci, Tiffany, Balenciaga, Saint Laurent, Indochino, and many more. Browse the shops for art, books, gifts, lingerie, soaps, groceries, clothing, watches, jewelry and what ever else you can think of.

*'''Whyte Avenue''' (in '''[[Edmonton/South Central|South Central]]''') is the stretch of 82nd Avenue between 99th Street NW and 109th Street NW. The most developed portion of the Avenue is between 103rd Street NW and 106th Street NW. Whyte Avenue is Edmonton's main arts-oreinted retail district and is certainly worth a visit. It can be edgy, funky, mainstream, indie, quirky, and nerdy. Stroll through book stores, clothing shops, and little gift shops. During the evenings, particularly on the weekends, it becomes one of the primary nightclub zones of the city.

*'''124th Street''' (in '''[[Edmonton/Central|Central]]''') includes a variety of art galleries and clothing stores. It is also home to the Gallery Walk, which is the first of its kind in Canada. The member galleries are easily accessible within walking distance. There are two self-guided gallery walks organized each spring and fall. It also includes a growing number of bars, restaurants, and brew pubs. The area between Jasper Avenue NW and 107th Avenue NW contains the main shopping storefronts.

*'''Southgate Mall''' (in '''[[Edmonton/South Central|South Central]]''') is Edmonton's second-largest enclosed shopping centre and connected with the city via the South LRT line. It has the fifth highest sales per square foot of all shopping centres in Canada but markets to a more suburban crowd. Notable stores include Hudson's Bay, Sephora, Crate & Barrel, the Apple Store, Aritzia, London Drugs, Zara, and many others.

*'''Downtown Edmonton''' (in '''[[Edmonton/Central|Central]]''') is centered around Edmonton City Centre Mall which covers two blocks although numerous other retailers are scattered through the area. The developing Ice District is adjacent to City Centre Mall and is starting to develop a complementary set of retailers. Still, the allure of West Edmonton Mall and Whyte Avenue has made Downtown Edmonton a secondary shopping destination compared to those major areas.

{{districtify}}
===Bars and Nightclubs===
Edmonton nightlife is relatively vibrant for a city of its size. Generally speaking, there are two main nightlife areas in Edmonton including Jasper Avenue (Downtown) and Whyte Avenue (Old Strathcona).

Nightlife in Downtown Edmonton tends to be for a more sophisticated and older (25+) crowd. There are approximately 25 bars and nightclubs in the Downtown area, providing the greatest number of options in the city. It is focused primarily along Jasper Avenue with clusters of bars near 101st Street, 104th Street, and 109th Street. The second nightlife area in Edmonton is known as "Whyte Avenue" or "Old Strathcona". This area, due in large part to its close proximity to the University of Alberta, has a more artsy, youthful, and bohemian feel than its more sophisticated Downtown competition. There are approximately 20 bars and nightclubs in this area plus a wide variety of restaurants and tourist shops. The bulk of the nightlife in this area is located along Whyte Avenue (82nd Avenue NW) between 107th Street NW and 102nd Street NW. There are also a minor number of West Edmonton, South Edmonton, and North Edmonton bars and nightclubs. The party starts earlier than most parts of the world (around 8:00 PM) and last call for most bars and nightclubs is around 2:00 AM. After-parties at residences thereafter are common.

Here is a partial list of the more popular nightlife locations in the city.

===Budget===
Most of the budget hotels in the city are concentrated in and around the [[Edmonton/Southwest|south]] (e.g. Derrick Hotel) end of the city or in the deep [[Edmonton/East Central|east central]] area. There is also a lot in the nearby suburbs, see [[Edmonton Capital Region|Edmonton's area]].

There are also hostels located downtown, by Jekyll & Hyde's Pub, and just off of Whyte Avenue.

===Mid Range===
Closer to the [[Edmonton/Central|core]], '''Holiday Inn Express Downtown''' and the '''Comfort Inn & Suites''' are good options. These two offer great views along with easy access to the benefits of downtown. In [[Edmonton/North|the north end]], '''the Prospector's Gaming Room''' and '''North Inn and Suites''' are some great examples of some modern and simple good priced hotels at that part of the city. In the [[Edmonton/West End|West End]], with the closeness of West Edmonton Mall, there are a ton of hotels to choose from, most of which are on '''100 Ave.'''

South of the river, in [[Edmonton/South Central|Old Strathcona-University]] the '''Campus Suites''' is a great option for nice service and its proximity to the University. '''Days Inn Edmonton South''' is a recent addition to Old Strathcona, just a few blocks off Whyte Avenue. Also on '''Gateway Boulevard''' there are a lot of hotels, such as '''Greenwood Inn & Suites''', '''Ramada South''', '''Ramada Edmonton''', '''Mayfield Inn''', '''Travelodge South''', '''Econo Lodge''', '''Sawridge Inn Edmonton South''' and '''Cedar Park Inn'''. In the east, there is a lovely '''Four Points''' hotel with easy access to the city.

===Splurge===
Edmonton has a good variety of high end hotels in different locations in the city. Some of the most popular locations are:

* <sleep name="Downtown Edmonton" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" url="" checkin="" checkout="" price="" lat="" long="" email="" fax=""> This region has the highest number of high end hotels in the city. One can choose from hotels with river valley views including '''Crowne Plaza - Chateau Lacombe''' and the '''Courtyard Marriott''' and ones that have good views of the city such as the '''Sutton Place Hotel''' and the '''Westin Edmonton'''. There are also beautiful boutique hotels like '''Matrix Hotel''' and the '''Union Bank Inn'''. Either way, all of these posh empires have good access to downtown, friendly service, nice architecture, and luxury suites. For the extravagant traveller, the '''Fairmont Hotel Macdonald''' is a classic, château-like building built in 1912 and is the most expensive in the city, overlooking the river valley in elegant style.</sleep>

* <sleep name="West Edmonton" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" url="" checkin="" checkout="" price="" lat="" long="" email="" fax="">The area is full of higher-class hotels due to the proximity of West Edmonton Mall. One can choose from '''Fantasyland Hotel''' that's right in the mall or further out ones like '''Hampton Inn & Suites''' and the '''Hilton Garden Inn'''.</sleep>

==Contact==
* Area codes for phones in Edmonton are '''780''' and '''587'''.
* '''Wireless connection''' - most hotels offer wireless connection and for outdoor use-check out City Hall/Churchill Square or most parts of downtown, as they have good internet connection.  Also there are some internet cafés that you can check out.

* '''Emergency''' - If you have an emergency, call '''911'''. Non-emergency's may call #377 on their cellular device and the police complaint line is 780-423-4567.

*'''Government''' -The city operates a question/concerns/bylaw complaints line that can be reached by dialing 311

===Police stations===
Edmonton is patrolled by the '''Edmonton Police Service'''. In addition to the Police Headquarters/Downtown Division located east of City Hall, the EPS is separated into five operational Divisions (the name in brackets denotes the neighbourhood in which the Division station is located):
*'''Downtown Division''' (Boyle Street)
*'''North Division''' (Miller)
*'''West Division''' (Glenwood)
*'''Southwest''' (Papachase Industrial)
*'''Southeast''' (Tawa)

===Internet cafés===

Edmonton has a small number of internet cafés, most being [[Edmonton/Central|downtown]] or in [[Edmonton/South Central|Old Strathcona-University]].

==Stay safe==
Edmonton has a low crime rate compared to other North American cities. Pick-pocketing and confidence scams are almost non-existent in the city. Still, there are some areas where increased caution is advised.

* The area to the east of Downtown Edmonton is known as the Inner City. This area (approximately between 90th Street NW and and 97th Street NW and between Jasper Avenue NW and 107th Avenue NW) contains lower cost housing plus support services for Edmonton's lesser affluent citizens. Although this area is safe to walk in, it does have a noticeably higher level of homelessness, drunk people, and drug use. Visitors would be wise to travel within this area with a higher level of awareness, particularly at night.

* In nightclub oriented areas of the city (Jasper Avenue and Whyte Avenue), it can become a little rowdy between Midnight and 3:00 AM as drunk party-goers travel between bars. Be polite and don't be confrontational if you are approached by drunks late at night in these areas.

There is panhandling, particularly near the commercial areas along Jasper Avenue and Whyte Avenue but it is rarely aggressive. Just decline such solicitations politely and it shouldn't be an issue.

===Northern driving===

Navigation in Edmonton is made easier by city's street grid and relative lack of traffic compared to most other major North American cities. Visitors should note that additional hazards are presented by winter driving in the city, especially during and after the first few snowfalls of the winter. Ice can be a problem, especially on bridges. Ice on roadways can be almost invisible, which is where the commonly used - and dreaded - term "black ice" comes from. Stay tuned to local radio stations, several of which have regular road reports, and be prepared to find alternate routes should weather conditions or accidents shut down some routes.

==Cope==

===Newspapers===
Similar to most North American cities, print journalism has faded in importance within Edmonton and has become a secondary form of information to online sources.

*'''Edmonton Journal.''' Sensationalist journalism focused on crime and negative news stories. [http://www.edmontonjournal.com/] 

*'''Edmonton Sun.''' Same owners as the Edmonton Journal and same tabloid oriented reporting style. [http://www.edmontonsun.com/] 

*'''Globe and Mail.''' National newspaper with a less sensationalist style of reporting. [http://www.theglobeandmail.com] 

*'''Financial Post.''' Business oriented newspaper with a national focus. [http://financialpost.com] 

===Hospitals and Health Clinics===
For emergency medical issues, call 911 for an emergency operator. For non-emergency medical issues, call 811 to speak with a registered nurse knowledgeable about city medical services. These phone numbers are open 24/7, free, and will provide you with the best advice for your medical needs while visiting Metropolitan Edmonton.

There are numerous health clinics located throughout Metropolitan Edmonton. These clinics offer walk-in services and they all accept patients from out-of-province and out-of-country. For emergency medical issues, call 911 or go to your closest hospital. Patience is usually required at Canadian hospitals due to minimal public funding and the lack of private health services. Wait times can be over five hours during peak hours. For a list of wait times, you can download the Alberta Health Services app on your mobile phone. That may help you decide which hospital to visit. Major hospitals include:

*'''[[Calgary]]''' Alberta's other large city, is situated approximately 300 kilometers south (three hours) of Edmonton along Highway 2.

*'''[[Jasper]]''' Jasper is a more natural-oriented, less-commercial national park compared to its southern neighbor Banff. It is approximately 3.5 hours west of the city. Although its visitor demand peaks in summer, skiing and hiking make it also a popular destination in winter. Some of the highest peaks of the Rocky Mountains are along the highway and you are likely to see a variety of wildlife during your bus or car ride there. It has a wide range of accommodation from luxury to spartan.

*'''[[Banff]]''' Banff National Park is approximately 5 hours southwest from Edmonton. It is a more touristy destination compared to Jasper and has picturesque mountains, lakes, and shopping districts.

*'''Elk Island National Park''' is less than an hour's drive east of Edmonton along the Yellowhead Highway (Hwy 16). This national park is one of the last remaining large areas of natural aspen parkland undisturbed by agriculture and other human activities. Elk Island National Park is home to a variety of wildlife indigenous to the region such as moose, wood bison, deer, elk, beaver, muskrat and various waterfowl. Over 250 species of birds make their home here, making it a good place for birdwatching. The Ukrainian Pioneer Home, located in the vicinity of Lake Astotin in Elk Island National Park, is '''Canada's oldest Ukrainian museum'''. There is camping, cross country skiing, hiking and other outdoor activities. As in most Canadian national parks, a fee is required for entry into Elk Island National Park.
