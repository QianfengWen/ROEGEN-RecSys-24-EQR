'''[http://www.riga.lv/ Riga]''' is the capital of [[Latvia]]. 

==Understand==
[[Image:IMG_4442.JPG|thumb|300px|The House of Blackheads in Riga's Town Square.]]
The approximately 610,000 inhabitants of Riga make up one-third of the population of [[Latvia]] and makes it the largest city in the [[Baltic States]]. 

Riga is famous for its Old Town (Vecrīga) and city center (Centrs), in which over 800 buildings are of the Art Nouveau (aka Jugendstil) style of architecture. The old town of Riga is a [[UNESCO|UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. The Art Nouveau style involves intricate building facades, with carvings of flowers and mythological creatures, and ornate doorways and windows. Much of the old town was either destroyed by fire or destroyed by the Germans in World War II and remained in ruins until it was rebuilt after the World War II, and further refurbished since Latvia's accession to the EU, to delight of many visiting tourists. 

Riga is also popular due to its nightlife and discount airlines that offer cheap flights to/from much of Europe.

Riga is bisected by the river Daugava. Old (medieval) town is in the center of the city on the east side of the river. It is surrounded by a ring of ~19th -- early 20th century architecture, followed by a mix of private 2-floor house districts (many also pre-WW2) and Soviet-era 5-18 floor apartment districts, with an occasional factory (especially near railroad lines). The term "centre" loosely refers to quite a large area around Old town limited by the river to the west, the railroad lines to the east and south, and without a definite boundary to the north.

===History===
[[File:Riga - Latvia.jpg|thumb|300px|View of Riga towards the cathedral and Vanšu Bridge.]]
Riga was founded in 1201 by Albert of Bremen as a port city and a base to conquer and convert the native Livonians to Christianity, a goal that was achieved in 1206 after a battle in Turaida during the Northern Crusades. Riga developed as the major trade hub of the area during the peak of the Hanseatic League in the 13th to the 15th centuries and was ruled by the Archbishop of Riga. The Reformation reached Riga in 1522, which ended the Archbishops' power. In 1621, Riga became part of the Kingdom of Sweden, although it maintained a great deal of autonomy. In 1710, an invasion by Peter the Great of Russia ended Swedish rule and cemented Russian influence on the city.

Latvia declared its independence on November 18, 1918, although it became part of the Soviet Union in 1940. Riga was the capital of the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic until Latvian independence in 1991.

Germans have inhabited the city since its establishment by Albert, and throughout most of its history Germans were the elite while Latvians remained a lower class. Their position as the elite continued through the Imperial period of Riga. As such, much of the architecture in Riga has been heavily influenced by Germany. The Germans were forcibly evicted after the Nazi occupation of 1941-44.

===Talk===
The official language of Latvia is [[Latvian]]; however, in Riga, the majority of the population speaks both Latvian and Russian, however Russian is increasingly less prevalent among the younger generation. English is widely spoken by younger people and by people in the tourism industry, although the latter may be a bit more comfortable with the Russian language. [[German]] is also commonly spoken by tour guides.

==Get in==

===By plane===
'''[http://www.riga-airport.com/ Riga International Airport]''' ('Starptautiskā Lidosta Rīga' in Latvian) ({{IATA|RIX}}) ({{ICAO|EVRA}}) is located 10km southwest of Riga. The airport serves over 7 million passengers per year.

There are designated areas in the airport where smoking is allowed.

To travel between the airport to the city - 

Take only the state licensed taxis from the first line when exiting the arrival hall. be very aware of taxi boys or girls calling you to a specific cab. Never commit to a ride inside arrivals hall (unless you have bought a fixed-value voucher from a stand inside the arrivals hall) . Always choose your initially preferred type of travel and stick to that. Just for your information, public transportation to the Riga Old Town will cost you max 2EUR if ticket is purchased from bus driver, but a scam taxi could cost you up to 80EUR per ride! Aside from public transport inconveniences, [http://www.rigassatiksme.lv Rīgas Satiksme] will bring you safe and sound very near to your destination, with maximum 10 minutes later than a taxi.
Never go for the "nice" taxi boy or girl invitation in or outside the arrivals hall. You should only choose a reputable transportation offer from a driver who has his/her vehicle in direct visibilty from the cab you will actually ride (max 10 metres). A 'reputable' transportation unfortunately stands for "Baltic Taxi" and "Red Cab" brands only so far.
It's up to you if you want to go your own wild ways, but please be aware that your choice will most probably sum up to 80EUR instead of the usual ~15EUR ride to city centre. Please be careful!
Meanwhile, if you feel cheated by any taxi provider provided that your journey started at RIX, please contact [http://www.ptac.gov.lv here] with your official claim. Thousands of local and foreign taxi users within the past few years have applied for compensations which the given institution has a legal obligation to investigate. 

'''[https://saraksti.rigassatiksme.lv/index.html#bus/22/a-b/1542 Bus 22]''' and '''[https://saraksti.rigassatiksme.lv/index.html#expressbus/322/b-a/en Expressbus #322]''' run between the airport and the old town, with a stop near the central bus and railway stations and '''[https://saraksti.rigassatiksme.lv/index.html#minibus/241/a-b Minibus #241]''' runs between the airport and Esplanāde, at the north end of the old town. These buses operate as any other public transport in Riga; see [[Riga#Get_around]] for more information on riding the buses. The journey to the old town takes 30-40 minutes. The last buses leave the airport at 0:05, or 23:40 on Saturday, Sunday, and holiday. The bus stop is located opposite the entrance of the terminal. There is a ticket machine at the bus stop or tickets can be bought at the Narvessen shop near the TGI Friday's at the departure level in the airport. Note that day and multi-day passes are not valid on the minibuses.  On the way to the airport by bus 22 there are two bus stops called Lidoste Rīga, the first one is the departure area, the second one the arrival area.

The ride to the center by taxi takes 15 minutes. Taxis can charge whatever they want, as long as the rates are displayed on the car and the maximum rate to the city center is €25. Some taxis will illegaly try to charge even more.

The best way to hire a taxi is to use the [https://bolt.eu/en Bolt] mobile app, which allows you to see the rates being charged, time to pickup, enter the destination, and pay with the credit card that is linked to your account.

'''[http://www.baltictaxi.lv/en Baltic Taxi]''' runs taxi service from the airport to the centre for a fixed price of €15 if booked online or via metered rates if paid to the driver. Service to the old town takes 15 minutes.

'''[http://redcab.lv/redcab-taxi/?lang=en Red Cab Taxi]''' offers metered taxi services from the airport. A journey to the city center costs approximately €12 and the ride takes 15 minutes, depending on the traffic. Wheelchair accessible mini vans are available but must be pre-ordered.

'''[http://www.rigaweekend.com/transport/airport-transfer.html Personal Minibus]''' offers airport transfer for groups. The price of €8 per person (6 person minimum) also includes guide to meet group with a greeting sign.

Any registered taxi can pickup at the airport. Most of these would now be pretty dodgy old cars, charging extremely high prices (Riga-registered companies can charge max. 2.14 EUR/km, while these would charge 3). Therefore it's better either to wait a bit in the line to get a Red Cab or Baltic Taxi (in worst case - low-coster black-yellow Panda Taxi, which generally enjoys mixed attitude), or to use Baltic Taxi stand inside the arrivals hall, or to use the Bolt application (Estonian and Latvian analogue of Uber). General rule should be to avoid black cars with longer company names on white ovals, and of course always to look at the price (the table includes price for embarkment, waiting, per km), that should be listed on rear door.

Taxis can charge whatever they want, as long as the rates are displayed on the car and the maximum rate to the city center is €25. Please be aware of this, as some of the smaller companies or individual taxi drivers are now charging up to 40-50 euros for the ride to city center, instead of the usual 12-15 euros. The bigger companies, such as Baltic Taxi, Red Cab or Panda are still keeping sensible rates, so do look at the rates displayed on the car and don't be intimidated to pick the first car you see.

===By bus===
There are international bus connections to anywhere in Europe, including frequent service to [[Tallinn]] and [[Tartu]] in [[Estonia]], and [[Vilnius]] and [[Kaunas]] in [[Lithuania]].

'''[http://www.ecolines.net/ Ecolines]''' oldest buses

'''[http://www.luxexpress.eu Lux Express]''' with media screens & free coffee.

'''[http://www.flixbus.com/ FlixBus]''' no media screens

'''[http://www.flybus.lv/ Flybus]''' service between Riga and the airports of [[Kaunas]] and [[Vilnius]].

'''[https://www.traveller.ee/tour/tallinn-riga-bus-tour Traveller Tours]''' minibus sightseeing tours from [[Tallinn]] to Riga, stopping off at different sights along the way

===By ferry===
'''[https://www.tallinksilja.com/stockholm-riga Tallink]''' operates a daily ferry service between [[Stockholm]] and Riga. The journey takes 17 hours. Prices are usually around €100. There're also other ferries connecting the city with [[Lubeck]].

===By train===
'''[http://www.pv.lv/en/ Latvian Railways]''' operates service to many cities in [[Latvia]], including the suburbs of Riga, as well as a few cities in [[Russia]], [[Belarus]], and [[Estonia]]. You can book tickets online via the Latvian Railways site up to 45 days in advance, but tickets must be collected from a station in Latvia, with the exception of tickets to Moscow and Saint Petersburg which can be issued as e-tickets in both directions.
You can also buy tickets in the Shopping center Origo. Train tickets around the country are usually very cheap.

Trains depart for the 16-hour overnight journey to [[Moscow]] daily (except New Year's Eve) at 16:45 with an additional train departing at 18:10 from May to September. The overnight trip costs €36-205 depending on service level.

Trains depart for the 15-hour overnight journey to [[St. Petersburg]] daily (except New Year's Eve) at 18:35. The overnight trip costs €30-175 depending on service level.

Limited trains operate between Riga and [[Valga]], [[Estonia]]. From [[Valga]], connections can be made to other cities in [[Estonia]] including [[Tallinn]]. However, it is much easier to travel to Estonia by bus.

===By car===
Riga has good road connections with Estonia, Lithuania, Russia, and Belarus. Riga is on the [[Via Baltica]] and ~300km from both Tallinn and Vilnius. Note that in the city center, you have to pay a [https://www.rigassatiksme.lv/en/services/parking-services-/ fee for public parking] which varies depending from distance to center.

==Get around==
Cars are allowed in the Old Town, although parking charges can cost up to €10/hour.

===By foot===
Old Town is comprised mainly of rounded cobblestone streets that may be hard to walk on if you are not wearing proper shoes. Outside of Old Town, most streets are paved with asphalt, although some smaller streets may be unpaved. Sidewalks are predominantly concrete everywhere. Old Town is best explored on foot. Due to the neglected drainage system, the streets may be flooded during heavy downpours.

===By public transport===
The city-owned [https://www.rigassatiksme.lv/en/ Rigas Satiksme] operates the '''trams''' (street-cars), '''buses''', '''minibuses''', and '''trolleybuses'''. They all use the same e-ticket system called e-talons. A single fare covers a ride on any one route independent of the distance - i.e. a transfer requires payment of 2 fares. However, if you enter a vehicle with the same route and in the same direction within one hour, your ticket is still valid and will not be charged again. The [https://www.rigassatiksme.lv/en/ Rigas Satiksme] website provides a great interface for planning a trip within Riga.

Single fares are €2.00 during at all times if paid onboard to the driver (cash only, exact change preferred) or €1.15 for bus/tram/trolleybus/minibus trips if a reloadable '''e-talon card''' is purchased in advance from a ticket office, vending machine, press kiosk, '''Narvesen''' shop, or other location listed on the Rigas Satiksme website. A 5 ride ticket costs €5.75, 10 rides are €10.90, and 20 rides are €20.70. Also available are tickets for 2 trips for 2 people costing €4.60 and 2 trips for 3 people costing €6.90. Unlimited ride 24-hour cards cost €5.00, 3-calendar-day cards cost €10, and 5-calendar-day cards cost €15. The cards all are activated by using the yellow device in the vehicles. Note that you must activate all cards every time that you enter a vehicle. [http://www.rigacard.lv/en The Riga Card] allows the holder to travel free on public transportation.

Tram lines are numbered 1-11; bus lines are numbered 1-55; trolley bus lines are numbered 1-27. Minibus lines have numbers 200-280. Night buses are numbered N1-N10.  While the numbers are similar, the routes are completely different - i.e. bus #2 is totally different than trolleybus #2. Tram numbers on stops are identified by "Tr", buses (not trolleybuses) by "A". Stops are marked by a blue rectangular sign with a stylized white image of the vehicle and lists the numbers that stop there. Timetables and stops of the route are also usually posted at stops and are fairly accurate. Note that bus routes are marked "A", but tram and trolley bus routes are both marked "T" on timetables, except tram timetables should have red background for the "T" letter and trolley bus—yellow. With the exception of minibuses, the vehicles include an LCD screen with next stop information.

Trams are generally the fastest public transportation apart from trains. Although they are on street level and the rails are not physically separated from the rest of the traffic, in all but the busiest rush hours they have the right of way. Minibuses are smaller and thus more maneuverable than buses and trolley buses, making them the second-fastest mode of transport.

===By bicycle===
'''[http://www.sixtbicycle.lv/en/ SIXT Latvia]''' operates self-service bicycle rentals at numerous bicycle stands across the city. The service is available to both residents and guests of Riga. You must have a mobile phone to register, but registration is free. The bikes have 3 speeds and lights, but no helmets. The cost is €0.90 per 30 minutes, with a maximum of €9 per day. Alternatively, ask your hotel if they provide bicycle rental.

===By taxi===
The way to hire a taxi is to use mobile apps such as [https://bolt.eu/ Bolt] or [http://www.clicktaxi.lv/index.php?ch_lang=en ClickTaxi] which allows you to see the rates being charged, time to pickup and pay with the credit card.

If you hail a random taxi on the street, be aware that the taxi may not follow the most direct route and most probably use a meter rate that will significantly overcharge you. Also try to avoid Panda Taxi - cars are very bad, drivers quite often do not speak foreign language, will also tend to overcharge tourists.

"Official" taxi companies like Airbaltic, Red Cab might look official, but they are just representatives of bigger companies/actual companies that employ staff not just freelance drivers, provide just app/operator service. Also fairs will be significantly higher than in above mentioned apps, yet to be fair more often than not also service quality will be accordingly high.
Another special/safe taxi you can take is Lady Taxi - company employs only women drivers that way eliminating a risk where driver might behave inappropriately towards women passengers.

DO NOT take taxis parked near "main/popular" sights like bus or train station, landmarks, big shopping malls etc. more often than not these sites are at best providing services from companies like Airbaltic / Red Cab that will be per se more expensive but most places are occupied by scam drivers who will charge very very high prices. Better use apps especially in such places or opt for public transport/car sharing.

===By car===
There are several car rental offices in Riga airport as well as in other parts of the town. You can even rent a cheap soviet style car. However, traffic can be extremely slow, especially on the bridges, and parking in old town can cost up to €10/hour.

====Drunk driving====
Driving drunk is considered a serious law violation. Besides high fines and seized driving license one may easily end up serving 10-15 days in an administrative arrest. Maximum alcohol contents in the blood must not exceed 0.5. There are plenty of police patrols and it is very common to be stopped for an alcohol test.

===By boat===
[https://www.visitjurmala.lv/lv/dari/ka-noklut/ar-kugiti/ Boat service] is available during the months of May to September from/to [[Jurmala]]. The boats stop in Riga stop near the Stone Bridge (Akmens Tilts), which is right next to the House of Blackheads/Riga Tourist Information Centre, in the old town. The trip costs €15-20 and takes 2.5 hours, which is obviously much slower and more expensive than train service.

[[File:Riga art nouveau building (Elizabetes iela).jpg|thumb|Riga art nouveau building]]

[http://www.rigacard.lv/ The Riga Card], which costs €16-€26, has discounts for museums and some tourist attractions.

The areas usually most interesting to tourists are the Old Town and the area around the nearby Freedom Monument. However, Old town is not the only place worth visiting. Very old and well preserved city districts unvisited by tourists are Agenskalns and Tornakalns, just over the Stone bridge. The residential areas outside Riga center are largely made up of gray apartment blocks built in the typically Soviet style. These areas are nearly identical to those all over [[Eastern Europe]]. However, they do give an idea of how the vast majority of the people in Riga live and of the history of the area.

====Organized tours====
The tourist office, located inside the House of Blackheads, offers both guided tours and free pamphlets, complete with detailed descriptions of many buildings, for independent walks. These walks cover the old town and the nearby city center sights as well as the Art Nouveau district. It's easy to do each of these in around an hour, or linger and read every detail in the booklet. In the absence of any signs or plaques around the city, the booklet gives you an insight to what you are seeing. 

Many private companies offer organized tours of Riga. Options include bike tours, Segway tours, pub crawls, hop-on-hop-off bus tours, walking tours, and tours focused on a certain aspect of Riga - away from the touristy old town. [https://www.rigafreetours.com/ Riga Free Tour] operates a free city walking tour that departs everyday from St Peters Church at 12:00. Look for a yellow suitcase.

Another popular option in Riga for free guided tour - [http://www.rigaculturefreetour.lv/ Riga Culture Free Tour]. The tour covers Riga's Art Nouveau district, boulevard circle, park lane and a part of Riga Old Town. ''Riga Culture Free Tour'' is usually on the way in small group as the majority of visitors of Riga don't dare to explore the city outside Old Town walls. Perfect option to explore and see the new Riga of 20th century. Starts every day at 12.00 o'clock from Rainis monument (at Esplanade park).

===Bars===
Riga is a major nightlife destination for tourists and bars here are often open later than those in other European cities.  On average, bars in Old Town will charge €3.00-4.00 per beer and bars outside of Old Town will charge €2.00-3.00 per beer. The nightlife of Riga is mostly focused around bars with nightclubs being less prevalent and less popular for locals.  A specialty liquor is '''Riga Balsam''', which is an acquired taste.

Spread out across three floors, the pub offers 12 local beers on draught for affordable prices served from a bar that’s actually an old VW combi van. Live bands play frequently in the basement and if the cheap happy hour prices are too much for you to handle you can always crash at its hostel upstairs. Happy hours are for beers from 17:00 until 19:00 (with 20:00 until closing on Tuesdays), and for cocktails from 18:00 until 19:00. </drink>

==Stay safe==

Riga is a quiet city for its size and crime is very low if compared to other EU capitals. The Old Town area becomes flooded with tourists during weekends so can become a bit rowdy during the evenings, however the rest of Riga remains quiet and calm as most tourists stick to the Old Town area bars. 

There is heavy police presence all over the city and if you are ever in need of an officer just head to the Freedom Monument which has a 24/7 police presence.

See the info box in the [[Riga#Drink]] section regarding common bar scams in Riga.

To avoid unnecessary confrontations especially with people who are not very fond of foreigners, try to be low-key in public places, keep your voice down especially in public transport, don't flash significant amount of cash bills 100+ EUR.

Be ready that men, especially ones under any type of influence, might approach women, trying to get acquainted - that is seen as ok in Latvia, actually in some cases perceived as brave move by a man. If you see a person who is not sober, better just create a distance and leave, do not engage in conversation, just say nothing and walk away. To make things even more safe try not walk alone and ideally have a male in a group - that usually discourages people pushing etiquette boarders.

===Riga's Central market/Riga International Coach Terminal/Train station===
All three are located next to each other and attract a lot of people including tourists as well as not so good people.
This area especially during crowded periods (holidays, rush hour) or late evenings are not too safe. Starting with taxi drivers that will scam you, homeless people/beggars that will ask for money, ending with pickpockets, drug addicts and maybe even worse.
Would suggest going to these places exclusively during the day time - you will be able to see them better in a light, have less people and lower risks running into some unpleasant situation.

Generally, this area is fairly safe. However, precautions must be taken to avoid being scammed or robbed. The station invites a rather motley sort of unsavory types. Keep your bags and personal items on your person and in your sight at all times. For males, it's advised to use situational awareness if approached by random women. If approached, expect to be given a sob story about losing their wallet or ticket. Another tactic they use is to flirt and attempt to entice you to go back to your hotel or her place. If you are inclined to go off with her, you maybe robbed. Also, watch out for hawkers, as they are generally trying to sell you overpriced and stolen merchandise. Generally, the perpetrators tend to be gypsies. Stay firm- don't buy from hawkers and don't walk off with any strangers, no matter how much she pretends to be into you.

===Maskavas forštate (Moscow district)===
Maskavas is the area along the Daugava River east of the train station. Maskavas had a bad reputation due to its high crime rate, buildings in disrepair, and homeless vagrants. Overall the area has improved immensely and is now a safe place to visit or live in. It's highly questionable that the crime rate is higher in 'Maskačka' than in many other neighborhoods of Riga. Even after dark, while you might meet a drunk or homeless person, your odds of encountering a person walking her dog, a couple on a romantic stroll or a teenager whizzing past you on a skateboard are considerably higher. Obviously the common sense still applies. Check out the very nice Miera Dārzs / Klusais dārzs parks area, take in the rather unique history and architecture or join one of the many arts, theater or social activities going on there. Districts starts from Zinatnu akademija building /academy of science/.
