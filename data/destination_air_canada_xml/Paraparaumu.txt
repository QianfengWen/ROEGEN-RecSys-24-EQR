==Do==

Paraparaumu Beach is the gateway to Kapiti Island where the visitors and locals come to catch their boat to the world famous nature reserve.  The Kapiti Island visit is an experience and one that can be made even more alluring because of seasonal weather making it inaccessible.  

Sheltered by the island, the popular yet unspoilt beach is a safe haven for children to play, build sandcastles, and swim.  A neat children's playground and a challenging skate park for the older ones make boredom here a slim chance.

For a bit of exercise try your luck at the Paraparaumu Beach Golf Club or some bowling practice at one of the local greens.  

==Buy==

The village is a good place to buy local.  The Saturday market is a special community experience.  Drop in to have your breakfast and have a look.  Its a great place to meet local people, local growers and local producers.  

==Eat==

There are many cafes and restaurants both in town and near the beach making this a great stop for those needing to refuel.  When ordering fish and chips down at the beach ask them to point you to Fish and Chip Hill where locals soak up the sun, picnic and at times feed the many seagulls that hang around. The Surfer's Mistress Restaurant is a great place near the beach serving authentic Italian Pasta and Pizza.

==Drink==

==Sleep==

With many motels and hotels this town is not short of a place to stay and accommodation rates suit those wanting a quick stop over or a relaxing weekend on the coast.
