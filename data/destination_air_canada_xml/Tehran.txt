'''Tehran''' (Persian: تهران), is the capital city of [[Iran]]. A bustling metropolis of 14 million people, it is situated at the foot of the towering Alborz mountain range.

Tehran is a cosmopolitan city, with great museums, parks, restaurants, and warm friendly people. It deserves at least a few days of your Iranian itinerary.

The city can be roughly divided into two different parts - north and south. The northern districts of Tehran are more prosperous, modern, cosmopolitan and expensive while southern parts are less attractive but cheaper.

At the time of the Zand dynasty, it was a little town that was significant from a strategic point of view. The first of the Qajar kings, Agha Mohammed Khan, named Tehran as the country's capital in 1778, and most of its growth started during the reign of a subsequent Qajar monarch, Fath-Ali Shah. The castle which Agha Mohammed Khan had built was to contain the new majestic buildings. 

At the same time, the city's populace was redoubled. Due to the increasing significance of the city, gates, squares and mosques were built and it was at the time of Nassereddin Shah that the city's master sketch was prepared and modern streets were constructed. Later, huge central squares like Toopkhaneh square (now Imam Khomeini) and quite a few military buildings were built. Even though the Qajar dynasty was in a period of decline, Tehran soon took the shape of a modern city. The structure of large government buildings, new streets, recreation centres, urban service organizations, and academic and methodical centres were started, even as most of the old gates and buildings were destroyed and the city's old architectural fabric replaced by a contemporary one.

Tehran has also earned itself the rather unenviable reputation as a smog-filled, traffic-clogged and featureless sprawl of concrete bursting at the seams with 14 million residents. But you can also find an endless number of nice and cosy places in and around the city - if you know where to look. Tehran is also a city of parks and possesses more than 800 of them, all well-kept. The city is nearly a mile high above sea level and as a result is cooler than other cities in the middle east. Summer temperatures are around 36°C or about 95-100°F. The air tends to be very dry.

A combination of factors make Tehran a pleasant place to visit: The dry climate which is constantly cool (at least in the evenings), the proximity of the mountains, the parks and gardens where flowers blossom all through the year, the alleys of trees in the avenues or even smaller streets, and even the water that runs down from the upper city along deep and wide gutters which look like small rivers during spring.  The Alborz range to the north of Tehran, which hosts the highest peak in Iran, provides fantastic conditions for ski lovers in the winter. In winter, the mountain hotels and ski-clubs at Shemshak, and Dizine are full several days a week. Some specialist skiers consider the snow value in northern Tehran to be some of the best in the world.

===By plane===
Imam Khomeini International Airport ({{IATA|IKA}} {{ICAO|OIIE}}), located 55km southwest of the city center, is the international airport in Tehran to which passenger flights operate. The domestic airport is called Mehrabad which is inside of the city. If you need a connecting flight inside Iran, you need to travel between the two airports which may take between 40 minutes to 2 hours depending on the traffic. 

There are direct flights to/from from numerous European, African, Middle Eastern, and Asian cities; however, there are no direct flights to/from North America or Australia. Iran Air [http://www.iranair.com/] is the national carrier of Iran.

To travel between the city center and the airport:
* '''Buses''' There used to be regular buses between city and IKA airport, but as of January 2018 they don't operate anymore.
* '''Metro''' railway station on the 1st floor airport, exit near escalator on 2nd floor  (Jan 2019) train every 80 min, travel time about 35 minutes, schedule from airport to Tehran: 6:10, 7:30, 8:50, 10:10, 11:30, 12:50, 14:10, 15:30, 16:50, 18:10, 19:30. Metro train go to red metro line (Line-8, Shahre Aftab Station), price 75,000IRR
* '''Minivan''' Take the metro line 1 toward south to the SHAHED metro station (one stop before Haram-e-Motahhar metro station). Outside there are shared Minivan to the airport for 48K Rials per person (takes about 30 minutes)They leave when full but fill quickly (Jan 2017) and drop you at the parking airport.
* '''Taxis''' cost a fixed rate 1200,000 Rials (Dec 2019). Try to find a companion to share this price. Drivers will accept US Dollars or Euros. The drive to/from the city center takes 45 minutes without traffic, but can take upwards of 90 minutes with traffic. There is a booth organizing taxis right outside the arrivals hall. You can also bargain with taxis dropping off passengers at the arrivals hall because otherwise they would have to go back to Tehran empty. Note that every price you ask for is usually expressed in tomen (1 Tomen = 10 Rials).You can try to book a [https://booktaxitehran.com Tehran taxi] with the app "Snapp" - the Uber for Tehran. Prices down to 450.000 Rial are possible and you can pay with cash. Be aware that there are two different exchange rates for the Iranian Rial. Some people might try to scam you by quoting the lower exchange rate and offer services or exchange your money at that rate, which is usually 2-3 times below the better rate usually used for exchanging money. Also you can book taxi online from Taxi companies like Seiro Safar and [https://booktaxitehran.com Book Taxi Tehran]. They charge you more because of their English speaking drivers (20 Euros)

* Tehran's Mehrabad airport ({{IATA|THR}} {{ICAO|OIII}}) [http://mehrabad.airport.ir/HomePage.aspx?TabID=0&Site=mehrabad.airport&Lang=fa-IR] is an older airport that is used for domestic and cargo flights. From the former US Embassy site, you can expect a metered taxi ride to cost about 250,000 IRR (August 2015). Be careful to bring exact change as many drivers will not give you change.

Despite the warnings in some travel guides, there is no exit fee for foreign travelers, neither in Mehrabad nor in Imam Khomeini Airport. The ''exit fee'' applies to foreign travellers only when leaving Iran on land or by sea.

===By train===

There is at least one train each day to the Iranian cities of [[Mashhad]], [[Isfahan]], [[Tabriz]], [[Kerman]], [[Yazd]], [[Sari]], [[Gorgan]], [[Ahvaz]], [[Shiraz]] and [[Bandar Abbas]]. Tickets can be bought from any station, from travel agencies or online from various train operator websites, such as Raja [https://www.raja.ir], Fadak [https://www.fadaktrains.com/], BonRail [http://bonrailco.ir/fa], Joopar [http://www.joopar.com/],Tiktrip [http://tiktrip.com/], Karvano [https://karvano.com] etc. You could also use one of Iranian OTAs to buy your tickets online. 
Until 2015, there was a weekly train (the "Trans-Asia Express") between Tehran and Ankara, with another between Tabriz and Van. All cross-border trains are now suspended indefinitely.
There are now plans for a train to Nakhchivan through Jolfa.

===By car===
Traffic is very congested but has improved with the completion of several new tunnels and highways (referred to as Bozorgrah or Otoban in Persian language) across the city. You can drive in from Turkey fairly easily as well as from the Southern parts of Iran. Although Iran has been always among the countries with high number driving accidents, the police have cracked down on accidents and driving is now safer than before. It is possible to rent a car at IKA airport, Mehrabad and in the city with [https://www.europcar.com/ Europcar.]. However local choices such as [https://www.saadatrent.com/english Saadat Rent] and [https://en.navaran.com/ Navaran] are much cheaper. Deposit should be paid in cash.

===By bus=== 
Almost every city and far-flung village in Iran has bus services to Tehran, as evidenced by the hundreds of buses that pour in and out of the capital each day. Most buses arrive to, or depart from one of four major bus terminals:

* The '''Western bus terminal''' (''Terminal-e-gharb'') is the biggest, busiest and best equipped of Tehran's terminals. Most international buses (e.g. Armenia), as well as those heading to the Caspian Sea region and destinations west of Tehran originate and terminate here. The terminal is a ten minute walk north-west from Azadi Square, and a few minutes walk west from the Tehran (Sadaghieh) metro station.

* The '''Eastern bus terminal''' (''Terminal-e-shargh''), seven km north-east of Emam Hossein square, handles buses to/from Khorasan province, as well a small number of services to the north. Bus for Damavand/Polour leaves from here.

* The '''Southern bus terminal''' (''Terminal-e-jonoob'') is well equipped and handles buses head to and from destinations south of Tehran. It is 2 km east of Tehran's main train station and easily accessible via the dedicated Terminal-e-Jonoob metro stop.

* The '''Beihaghi bus terminal''' (''Terminal-e-beihaghi'') is located beside Arzhantin Square, around 1 km west of the Mossallah metro stop. (Frequent shared taxis to/from the metro should be no more than 3,000 rials). The station has services to /from most major destinations in Iran including Mashhad, Esfahan, Rasht, Shiraz (~12.5 hrs for $15, VIP bus as of July 2016), Tabriz and Yazd.

Internationally, Tehran is connected with a bus service to Yerevan (60 USD one way).To buy your tickets online.

==Get around==
[[Image:8012436292 425435edf3 b.jpg|thumb|260px|Congested traffic in Valiasr street, Tehran]]

Getting around traffic-clogged, sprawling Tehran is a true test of patience. While taxis are your best bet, they are pricier here than the rest of the country. A large local bus network will also take you almost anywhere you need to go, as long you can make sense of the routes and  Persian line numbers. The true star of Tehran's transport system however, is the brand new metro.

===By bus===

Tehran has an expansive but confusing bus network. Some require prepaid contactless card (min 20000 rials), which can be bought from booths beside the bus stops and Metro Stations used when you get off the bus, and some should be paid by cash (ranging from 3,500-6,000 rials). Note that the buses are partitioned in two sections, men-only (the front section) and women-only (the back section). 

Note that in the BRT lines, the women-only section is at the front. Also, the fee is paid on the station, using the prepaid contactless card (shared with Metro), or paying to the guard. 

Since bus numbers, route descriptions and other information is in Persian, your best bet is to look confused at a bus terminal; a local will surely stop to help. Each bus line has a certain and almost invariable path but only people know exactly which bus stations exist for a certain road. You shouldn't expect a map or guides even in Persian showing the bus network or bus stations. Even asking the bus driver wouldn't be a great help for you to find your way either. If you get in a bus and looking for a certain station to alight, ask one to help you -  you will find many people wish to help you to find your way, most of the time.

===BRT (Bus Rapid Transportation)===

The BRT buses are colored in red. BRTs has special lines and travels very quickly from Azadi square (west of Tehran) directly to the East (Terminal-e-Shargh). Railway square (South of Tehran) directly to the North (Tajrish square). Azadi square to free university (Northwest). Azadi square to south Terminal and parkway bridge (North of tehran) to jomhuri square.  Costs between 1,000-3,000 rials. In high-traffic hours (7AM-9AM &amp; 4PM-8PM) it is the best way to traveling . BRT has too many stations near main streets. Although you may not find an empty seat on the bus because of the crowds, people give their place to you if they know you are a tourist. The women's and men's seats and queues are separate.

===By metro===

[[Image:Metro_Tehran.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Tehran Metro]]
Tehran's new '''metro system''' [http://metro.tehran.ir/Default.aspx?tabid=120] is comprised of five lines that will whisk you quickly from one end of the city to the other without having to deal with the noise, pollution and chaos of Tehran traffic. However, many residents decided to leave their cars and commute by metro, so expect huge crowds during rush hours.

There are five lines available (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) (some stations on line 3 are still under construction) but the two most useful are lines 1 (north to south- from northern most Tajrish Station to Kahrizak Station) 
and 2 (east to west) which connect at the central Imam Khomeini station. All stations have signs in both Persian and English. Trains run every 10 minutes or less on rush hours (15 minutes on Fridays and holidays) from around 5:30AM-11PM every day.
line4 (yellow line) recently extended eastward to Kolaahduz station and westward to Eram-e-sabz Station. It's really crowded since it is connecting some of most important points like University of Tehran in Enqelab Sq. and an interconnection to line5 (green); line5 is going to Karaj, which is a 3 million population  suburb!


'''Tickets''' valid for 1 trip (including change of lines) cost 7000 rial. A go and return ticket costs 11,000 rial. There are ticket booths at every station. You can also buy a contactless fare card which is the best option if you are going to use metro a lot, or simply want to have less hassle by paying 20,000 rials for a card and use it on both metro and most of city buses (note that if you use this card, you usually pay less than any other tickets, since they charge for the longest trip on the network), to charge minimum cost in metro with this chargeable tickets you should use the card in exit station. There are three dedicated women-only carriages at two end of the train, one and half in each side. Women can anyway choose to travel aboard the other carriages.

There are a few apps for Android and iOS devices to assist passengers on using the metro. You can try downloading the '''[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yashoid.tehranmetro Tehran Metro]''' app which is made specially for foreign travelers. First you can find yourself on Google map (with stations marked on it) and your destination to decide which station you can get in and to which you want to arrive. After it you can select them on the stations map to get a textual explanation on taking directions and line changes along with a travel time estimation.

===By taxi===

As with the rest of the country private and shared taxis are abound in Tehran, although you may find flagging down a shared taxi more difficult amid the traffic and chaos, while private taxis are more expensive than in the smaller cities. See the Get Around information on [[Iran]] for details on flagging a taxi. If you want to get around by shared taxi, your best bet is to hop from square to square, as drivers will be reluctant to pick you up if your shouted destination deviates too far from their route. In each square you will find certain places where the private taxis are lined up in a queue and drivers call for passengers to a destination. (mostly happening during the times when the number of waiting taxis exceeds the number of passengers). In this case, they would wait until the car gets full of passengers (mostly one people at front and 3 people at back, excluding the driver). Otherwise the people have to line up in a queue waiting for the taxis to come. This is the case during rush hours (approximately 7AM-8AM and 5PM-8PM). All these depend upon finding their regular station in the square. You can also ask them to alight sooner than your destination wherever you like but you have to pay their total fee up to destination. The cost of such a ride from Azadi square to Vanak Square is around 150,000 rails (15,000 Tomans) (Prices accurate as of August 2015, but huge inflation means they change quickly). Most drivers are very poor at English - if your destination is anything other than an extremely popular spot (Bazaar, etc) you should bring it on a map or written in Farsi. 

'''Snapp''' [http://snapp.ir] and '''Tap30''' [http://tap30.ir] are the Iranian version of '''Uber''' in Tehran which are fairly cheap and their price is calculated in advance. The app can be downloaded from Iranian App Market, Cafe Bazaar [https://cafebazaar.ir/install/?l=en] and had English version, but a local SIM card is required to activate it. Although the drivers may not be good English speakers, the support line speaks English well and can handle the communication problems between you and the driver. 

'''Motorcycle taxis''' are a Tehran specialty and offer a way to weave quickly through the city's traffic-clogged streets. You'll see plenty of these drivers standing at the side of the road calling "motor" at all who pass by. Keep in mind ''motor taxi'' operators can seem even more suicidal than the average Tehran driver when driving. Agree on a price ''before'' you take off and expect to pay slightly less than chartering a private taxi. There are now even online versions of motorcycle taxis offered by Snapp [http://snapp.ir] and Alopeyk. [https://alopeyk.com/]

===Parks===
* '''Jamshidieh Park''' which is in the Niavaran district at the base of the Kolakchal Mountain, is one of the most picturesque and beautiful parks in Tehran.  

* '''Niavaran Park''' is one of Tehran's famous and most pleasant public city parks. It is located within the Niavaran district and is situated immediately south of the Niavaran Palace Complex.

* '''Park Mellat''' (Literally the Nation's Park) is situated on Valiasr Street (the longest street in the Middle East) is the largest park in Tehran situated in close proximity to the national television headquarters.

==Do== 

* <do name="Tochal Sport and Recreational Complex" alt="تله‌کابین توچال" address="end of Velenjak St." directions="take the Metro line 1 to Gheytarieh, then any bus or taxi to Tajrish Square (about 5 minutes). Ask the driver to let you off at Meidan Tajrish. If you visit on a holiday when Tehranis flock to the mountain, you should be able to jump in a shared taxi to the telecabin entry gate for 2,000 rials. Otherwise charter one privately from Tajrish Square" . You can take a metro to Tajrish Sation and take a local savari or shared taxi to Tochal which cost 30,000 Rials ( January 2017 ) . If you want to ski, ski rental is at station 1. Cost 750,000 Rials for ski, boots and poles rental. You need a government issued ID liek a driving license as they need to keep this as a guarantee for rental. They will give you back when you return the ski rentals. Ski lifts and cable car ride up cost 650,000 Rials which you need to buy at station 1. phone="+98 21 22404001-4" email="" fax="" url="http://www.tochal.org/en/" hours="" price="Tickets range from 100,000-500,000 rials depending on how far up the mountain you want to go. From the entry gate a minibus service (10,000 rials) can take you to the base station">A recreation area on Mount Tochal that offers hiking trails, a ski resort, gym and other activities. It's also a great place to get some scenic views over Tehran and enjoy a little peace and quiet in contrast to the bustling city. Normal means to a saddle near the top is via the '''Tochal telecabin lift'''. However, if you're energetic (or strapped for money), you can hike all the way up. On foot from the area at the base station it is 5 and a half hours to the summit (if you are fit). You can also start walking and hop on one of the telecabins at the next station when you get tired. If going to the top, bring a jacket, even in summer, as the summit is just under 4,000 m above sea level so it can be chilly. In winter take warm clothes, a wind proof jacket, wear good shoes and glasses against the sun. Keep in mind that the last telecabin down from the 7th station (3750m)leaves at 16:00 (4 PM), after that the place is deserted and you will have to walk down. There is no emergency shelter and temperatures at night go down well under zero. In case there is wind the effect of the cold is severe. </do>

* The '''Darband chair lift''' is an alternative to the one at Tochal. Taxis to Darband go from Tajrish Square.

* '''Darake''' is another entry point into nearby mountains. Like Darband, Darake hiking trail begins with tens of open-air restaurants alongside a stream. The easiest way to get there is to take a taxi or minibus from Tajrish Square.

* Wander around Tehran's massive '''bazaar''' (بازار) in the city's south (''Metro: Panzdah-e-khordad''). The main entrance on 15 Khordad Ave leads to a labyrinth of stalls and shops that were once the engine room of Iran's commodity markets and one of Imam Khomeini's greatest sources of conservative, pro-Revolution support. As usual, shops are clustered according to the products they sell. If you're planning on heading out into remote areas, the bazaar is an ideal and cheap place to stock up on almost anything you need.

It is easy to find work in Tehran, but you must have a university diploma to be applicable for good jobs. Although there is some inflation, many of the people in Tehran have good and well paying jobs. Like every other big developing world city, there's a big difference between poor and rich.

==Buy== 

===Money exchange===
For information on Iranian currency see [[Iran#Buy]].

You can exchange your currency in most banks after filling out between two and five forms, but the exchange rate in exchange offices is always better than what is offered by banks. It is much advisable to go to one of these offices which are mostly (but not only) on Ferdosi St which begins at Imam Khomeini Square. 

Also, most exchange offices in Tehran don't exchange before 9AM, when the daily rate gets fixed. 

Do not exchange your money with one of the many individuals offering to exchange along Ferdosi St. It is a lot more risky and illegal.

To avoid to carry cash and exchange several times you can order an Iran travel card, it would be really useful during your trip. Ask a travel counselor to provide info.

===Bazaars and shopping malls===
Visit the '''Bazar''', very appropriate for shopping. It ranges from cheap things to very expensive luxury things. You can find almost anything in Bazar, from clothing to carpets, kitchen accessories, decoratings, jewellery....

When in the Bazar, don't miss out the ''''Sharafol-eslam'''' restaurant located in the Bazar. It is very famous for its kebabs and chickens, excellent food, excellent quality, you'll never have enough. It gets really crowded though, which requires some patience.

There are also numerous '''shopping malls''' in the city. Valiasr Street and Tajrish Square (also includes a traditional bazaar) are two of the many locations full of shopping centres in Tehran. Some of the great Tehran Shopping Malls and Centers are listed below:

*'''Milad-e Nour Shopping Center''', Shahrak-e Gharb district [http://www.miladenoor.ir]

*'''Tandis Center''', Tajrish neighbourhood [http://tandis-center.ir]

*'''Golestan Shopping Center''', Shahrak-e Gharb district [http://golestancenter.com]

*'''Tirajeh Shopping Mall''', Ashrafi Esfehany Blv. [http://tirajemall.com]

*'''Palladium Mall''', Moqadas Ardabili St. [http://www.palladiummall.com] The confectionery store next to the supermarket is perfect for shopping souvenir sweets. Though on the pricey side by Iranian standards, the quality of the sweets is also high. Look out for the Tehranis who are wearing traditional black ''chadoors''; they are a distinct minority among the well-to-do clientele of this ultra-modern mall.

===Computer software===
Due to Iran's refusal to sign up for the Berne Convention, the sale of pirated software is legal in Iran. However, bringing the software home may be illegal and carry large fines or jail sentences. In addition, the software many not include the correct ID keys and therefore may not work on your computer. 

Places where pirated software is for sale include the bazaar at the corner of Vali-e-Asr Ave and Enghelab Ave., Bazar-e-Reza, Bazar-e-Iran, and "Paytakht Computer Complex", a 7-story modern complex filled with computer equipment, at the intersection of Vali-e-Asr and Mirdamad. The prices at "bazaar reza" (at charrah-e-vali-asr) are usually cheaper. Some of the computer equipment that is sold in Iran are cheap knockoffs.

===Jewelry & Gold===
'''Jewelry &amp; Gold''' boutiques located in Geisha, Milade Noor, Karim Khaan St. Golds, gems, and diamonds.

===Bags & shoes===
Designer '''bags and shoes''' such as Gucci, Versace,Dior, Armani in Golestan shopping centre &amp; Milade noor and other shopping centers mentioned above but please keep in your mind that there are all fake products imported from Turkey or produced by local so their prices are cheap. Because of not being in the international business world due to sanctions , there is not any famous and expensive brands in Tehran or if there are sometimes double or triple times higher than the original price in countries like Europe. however, there are real branches of Nike, United color of Benton, Ecco, Geox, Clark's, Adidas, Reebok and some other premium brand's level.

== Eat ==

Note that prices quoted on the menu may exclude an 9% tax, a 10-15% service charge, and a 10% tip. Be prepared to add as much as 1/3 to the prices quoted on the menu. Foursquare is popular in Tehran these days. You could always check for nearest restaurants and their ratings in the App.

===Budget===

You'll find cheap & good enough abgoosht stew in any of the places they call ghahvekhuneh (قهوه‌خانه) which you can find in any non-strictly-residential area. Just ask for a ghahvekhuneh or get this قهوه‌خانه printed and show it. Nice traditional working class ambience as a rule.

* '''White Tower''' (Borj-e Sefid) along Pasdaran Ave, Definitely worth a visit if in the area- try "White Rose" in the White Tower.

* '''Malek Cafe''' No.11, Kooshk e Mesri street. A cozy cafe in a quiet street opposite of Ferdowsi International Grand Hotel . Has great coffee, espresso, etc., tea, cake (great cheesecake) and even '''vegetarian''' dishes. Be sure to speak to Amir, the very hearty owner of the cafe who speaks good English.

===Tea houses===
* '''Azari Traditional Tea House''' - Just north of the train station. A bit far from the center but worth the trek. The atmospehere here is unique, from the moment you enter from the beaded doorway. This is a popular hangout for people of all ages. Features an eclectic collection of water pipes and tea pots. It can be really busy with queues outside at the Iranian weekend in particular.

* <drink name="Chai bar" alt="Anjoman Khoshnevisan" address="145 North Salimi Blvd" directions="Farmanieh" phone="+98 21 22210310" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="">located in a beautiful historic garden in Tehran. It is an ideal place to spend late afternoons/evenings. It offers great selection of teas and coffees as well as sandwiches.</drink>

* '''Entracte Cafe''', (''upstairs in a cinema on Jomhuri Ave ,just west of Valiasr Avenue ''). An atmospheric and bohemic cafe operated by actress Leila Hatami and her husband. Ask for the traditional Iranian tea which is amazing. They serve a fantastic brunch between 11AM-2PM on Fridays and it includes sausages, bread and brie. Damaged by fire but possibly re-opened.

* '''Gandhi Shopping centre'''. For trendy cafes filled with liberal Iranians. You will find about ten coffeshops as well as a few very good restaurants, including Monsoon.

===Juice bars===
* In many places you can find fresh sickly-sweet carrot juice - as well as some other juices - for just 30,000 rials a cup.
* In the summer ask for ''Descurainia sophia'' drink called ''Khakshir'' by the locals. It is extremely delicious and very refreshing on Tehran hot summer days.
* By most main bazaar in Tehran you can get a drink of blended honeydew melon with ice and sugar. Its delicious and extremely refreshing on a hot day.

===Budget===
The old styled ''Mosaferkhanehs'' and budget hotels are often low quality and overpriced. The reason is that Iran has had very limited exposure to the outside world. In many low budget places, there are no European toilets or even no toilet and staff can be rather unfriendly with no English speaking ability. However, in recent years many modern western-style hostels have opened in Tehran.

==Stay safe== 

Tehran is still relatively one of the safest cities to travel through, particularly considering its size and security. Common sense and the usual precautions against pickpockets in bazaars and crowds should ensure your visit is hassle free. A thief might address you in farsi and "mistake" you for a Iranian. If he talks to you it is possible to report him to the police.

Even late at the mid-night it is safe in most parts of the city while you will find the city still crowded. It is advisable not to take a private taxi for instance at 2AM.

The '''fake police''' that target Esfahan's tourists have also found their way to Tehran in recent years. These are usually uniformed men in unmarked cars flashing phoney IDs are requesting to see you passport or search your luggage. It goes without saying that you should just ignore such requests and head to the nearest police station if you feel unsafe. The trouble is that it can be a little hard for the untrained tourist eye to tell these from the real police.

Another thing to watch out for are phone snatchers. One guy will wait on a motorcycle while another rips your smart phone out of your hands and jumps on the back of the bike before they take off. Happens in less busy streets at night. A precaution is to only use your phone inside shops. 

The traffic in Tehran is very dangerous and should be considered some of the worlds worst. Try to cross the street when the locals do. At first it looks impossible but the drivers do a very good job to avoid pedestrians even though they drive crazy.

Gay and lesbian travellers should be extremely careful when travelling to Tehran due to strict and harsh regulations on homosexual activity. Iran justice has death penalty for homosexuals, even teenagers. 

Exercising extreme caution in public is the key thing to remember, and in fact, it is mandatory to abstain from any kind of intimacy even for heterosexual couples, but it doesn't mean you cannot hold hands.

It is required by law, even for Westerners or non-Muslim women, to wear a headscarf and long sleeves/skirt/trousers when going out in public. Failure to do this will result in being arrested and fined.

If you decide to smoke the qalyan (waterpipe), make sure that you are not smoking opium or other kinds of drugs if you don't intend to do it. Although drugs and alcohol are illegal in Iran, it is not impossible to obtain them, especially in Tehran. Since the Iranian government decided to ban the qalyan and cigarettes in public places, it is a bit difficult to find a decent place for smoking. 

And if you really want to try the qalyan, you can expect to find this in dodgy places.

==Cope==

The traffic in Tehran is horrendous. To get a break from it head to the parks in the north of the city.

==Get out==

* If the hustle and bustle of Tehran becomes too much, it's possible to go to the Caspian Sea for a day or two. The holiday town of [[Ramsar]] is about five hours away, and the drive across the Alborz Mountains is spectacular.

* '''Namakabrud''' Villa city and gondola lift in beautiful green coasts of Caspian Sea in the northern Iran is about 4.5 hours away.

* '''[[Qom]]''' (The most religious city of Iran followed by Mahshhad) is about 2 hours away from Tehran by bus and one hour by car [120 km].

* '''[[Na’in]]''' is the first '''Desert''' destination toward south. it's a small and quiet town at the edge of desert. A perfect pattern of a desert town. Everything you like to see in a desert town you can find there. to get there from Tehran, bus available in both of Terminale' Jonub (10am and 5pm) and Beihaghi terminal.

* Two of Iran's biggest '''ski resorts''' are 1-2 hours north of Tehran in the Alborz Mountains. 
:* [[Shemshak]] is the closest of the two and its steep slopes are considered more appropriate for expert skiers and boarders.  
:*[[Dizin]] is the larger resort with more facilities and is considered better for beginners and intermediates.  The resorts generate some rivalry amongst the locals, with some 'Shemshakis' looking upon those who ski in Dizin as 'kids in the park' and see Shemshak as the place for 'true skiers'.

* Town of '''[[Varzaneh]]''' is undoubtedly the best desert town of Isfahan province. Having the most accessible desert of Iran ,which is 12 km southeast of town. Being close to salt lake and Gavkhooni wetland, makes Varzaneh a must-stop spot for travelers between '''[[Isfahan]]''' and '''[[Yazd]]'''.

In addition, most of housewives are weaving carpets. 1000-yeaer-old Ghoortan citadel are also in Varzaneh district. Varzaneh is famous as town of white pigeons, as women are wearing white chadors since many centuries ago, keeping the traditional of pre-islamic religion Zoroastrianism, though all the people are currently Muslim.
