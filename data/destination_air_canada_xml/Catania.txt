{{pagebanner|Catania Banner.jpg}}
'''Catania''' [http://www.comune.catania.it/] is a city located on the eastern coast of Sicily at the foot of Mount Etna, the biggest volcano in Europe. It is the second largest city in [[Sicily]] with the metropolitan area reaching one million inhabitants, a major transport hub, economic centre and a university city where you will enjoy a busy downtown and an active nightlife. Catania is also well known for its particular baroque architecture and urban design (the downtown area is a World Heritage Site, along with all the Val di Noto), consequences of the great earthquake of 1693 after which the city had to be rebuilt, like most of eastern Sicily. 

==Understand==
Sicilian used to be the common language here for centuries, as the Sicilian culture is isolated on an island. Even in Catania, you will notice Italian and Sicilian (like Palermo, Catania has its own dialect) in some neighborhoods, especially in inner areas, while most people speak mainly Italian in the city center.

The city has a history dating back 2700 years, dominated by several different cultures (Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Normans, Spanish, etc.) and was a rich commercial centre, mainly due to its port. Again, since the 70's, the city economy is growing as the urban area and the suburbs, making Catania a large metropolitan centre, mainly between the volcano and the sea. Today, even if you can find there most of the biggest commercial centers in Europe (especially Etnapolis); the old 17th century downtown area is still the center of the day-to-day life.

Catania is situated next to the biggest active volcano in Europe and has been destroyed many times in the past. As a result, Catania is a city where you can find a great variety of landscape and architecture, a lot of dirty buildings and also a lot of abandoned houses, especially in the mountains. However, since the city is a World Heritage Site, a lot of renovations have been made.

Today, you will feel in Catania a mix of nostalgia and "joie de vivre", especially at night or during festivals.

===Sicilian Baroque===
The major feature of this city is its architecture, which is predominantly baroque.
The major characteristic of Baroque architectural is its theatricality. This style dominated Europe in the 17th century as a result of the reformation/counter-reformation where the statement given was one of grandeur. The preceding style was Renaissance, while the succeeding was Neoclassicism. The three major features are a near excessive amount of detail (statues, lots of gold, columns and pilasters, garlands and wreaths etc), facades which are taller than the nave (to fool the viewer about the size) and frescoes often featuring ''trompe-l'œil''.
Baroque from Catania has several unique features such as use of dark lava stone (basalt), the Bell in the facade itself and grotesque masks and putti.

===Landmarks===

Some of the best feature of Catania's area are

* The Baroque architecture, mainly in the centre 
* Every morning, except Sundays, two fascinating markets are held:
:  - a large  fish market in a beautiful setting off Piazza del Duomo 
:  - a bustling food and clothes market off Via Etnea
* [[Mount Etna]], which has reshaped the city several times 
* The '''kiosks''' which act as social area for the locals by selling refreshments, such as coffee, Lemoncello or popular unique drinks such as "seltz al limone" (soda water with fresh-squeezed lemon juice) or "mandarino al limone" (soda water with tangerine syrup AND fresh-squeezed lemon juice). 
* The '''Elephant Fountain''', from the 17th century, in Piazza Duomo 
* '''La Plaja''', sandy beaches south of the city along the bay.
* The '''Riviera dei Ciclopi''', a rocky, volcano coast north of the city, stretching almost to Taormina

==Get in==
===By plane===
'''Catania-Fontanarossa Airport''' [https://www.catania-airport.com/] ({{IATA|CTA}}) with scheduled and charter planes arriving from destinations throughout Italy and Europe.

From the airport, there are half-hourly buses (ALIBUS) to Catania's bus station (just in front of main train station: Catania Centrale).  The trip takes about 20 minutes.  Tickets are sold on-board (4 euro). Do not forget to validate your ticket once you are inside the bus.
If going to the Duomo, the nearest stop is called "ARCHI", a few meters away. 

At 400mt from the International Airport Vincenzo Bellini “Fontanarossa” of Catania we have '''Catania International Airport Hotel''' [http://www.cataniainternationalairporthotel.com/]

===By bus===
Frequent buses run to [[Taormina]], [[Messina]], [[Enna]], [[Caltanissetta]], [[Ragusa]], and [[Syracuse (Sicily)|Syracuse]]. Less frequent buses run to local destinations, [[Naples]], [[Rome]] etc. The main bus station is opposite the railway station and 10 minutes walk from the city centre.

===By train===

Frequent trains run up the east coast to and from [[Taormina]] (but the station in Taormina is a long walk below the town, at [[Giardini Naxos]] better to take the Bus) and [[Messina]], then on to [[Naples]] and [[Rome]] etc. Trains also run to [[Enna]], [[Palermo]] (slower than the buses) and [[Syracuse (Sicily)|Syracuse]]. A scenic route runs inland to [[Caltagirone]] and [[Gela]]. There is one daily train to [[Agrigento]]. The railway station is 10 minutes walk from the city centre. A Trenitalia night train with couchettes and sleeper cabins runs up to Milan in the north of Italy.

===By ferry===
Several Ferries run from mainland Italy to Catania.  There is an overnight car ferry that runs daily between Naples and Catania as well as ones from Genova and Civitavecchia. One can also get a ferry to/from [[Valletta]], [[Malta]].

==Get around==
Catania has a compact centre and it is most convenient just to walk around.
===Bus===
Catania's public transportation primarily consists of buses (find timetables and route map at [https://www.amts.ct.it/percorsi-e-orari AMTS]). Just note that waiting times can be long, and delays of up to 20 minutes are not uncommon so don't panic if your bus is not arriving. To add to the confusion the time schedules only mark the departures from the first stop so you will need to guess the arrival time if you want to get on mid-way of the route. Tickets can be obtained at newsstands and tobacco shops located near larger bus stops. There's an option for a daily ticket priced at €2.50, making it a cost-effective choice if you plan to take three or more rides in a day.

===Metro===
There is a single metro line which connects the city center with the main train station and the northern parts of the city, from where you can reach villages on the slopes of Mount Etna. Closed on Sundays. 

===Car===
When driving around in a rented car, you may have to put up with heavy, slow, messy, unruly traffic jams. If you want to park there is a secure parking in the center of Catania called Piazza Lupo Garage.

* '''Cathedral of Sant'Agata''' (Cattedrale di Sant'Agata), Piazza del Duomo, 95100 Catania tel. +39 095 320 044 [http://www.cattedralecatania.it/]. ''Duomo'' is imposing and worth a visit.
* '''Food and fish markets''' just below the Piazza del Duomo are a lively and colorful place to visit. This fish market is the busiest and most exotic of all over Sicily and has been described by the British TV chef Rick Stein as the best fish market in the world. Monday to Saturday morning only.
* '''Piazza del Duomo''' is attractive, lively and contains the '''Elephant Fountain''' - the symbol of the city and the entrance to the elegant via Etnea, the main shopping street.
* '''Piazza Stesicoro''', the original centre containing '''ruins of the Roman Amphitheatre'''. It is also the entrance to the '''main market''' (Mercato de la Fiera), which is worth to visit. Additionally, it is one of the main bus hubs.
* '''Teatro Massimo Bellini''' Via Giuseppe Perrotta, 12, 95131 Catania, tel. +39 095 730 6111, [http://www.teatromassimobellini.it/]. It is 19th century opera house in Piazza Teatro, which is the main meeting for the local young people. So its neighborhood is very lively and busy by night.
* '''Via Etnea''' - the main shopping avenue, running North from the Piazza del Duomo has most of the city's imposing building and is busy throughout the day and evening. Lots of churches. This road is the equivalent of Las Ramblas in [[Barcelona]], so in the evenings the local people put on their Sunday clothes and walk at a relaxed pace along this avenue.

==Buy==
The "Pizzo free" shops are a group of shopkeepers that refuse to pay the racket to the Mafia. Catania's consumers sustain them by going shopping in their stores. You can find fresh fish at the main fish market, Piazza Duomo. You might have to haggle!

==Eat==

Catania is proud of some specialties, like '''Arancino''' (cone-shaped rice croquette filled with meat, tomato sauce, cheese and peas) and other many typical '''tavola calda'''. The fish is also good, as Catania is a large port. The city is also known for horse meat, especially in some areas around the "Benedictine Monastery". Another famous speciality is '''Pasta alla Norma''' which consists in pasta (generally macaroni) dressed with tomato sauce and topped with fried eggplant slices, grated ricotta salata and fresh basil. Catanese pastry include the world-wide famous '''Cannolo alla Ricotta''', the "Cassatella di Sant'Agata" (a small cassata) and the "Pasta di Mandorla" (based on almond meal). In summer, the typical breakfast consists in "Granita" (a kind of sorbet of almond or black mulberry) served with a sweet round loaf ("brioscia"): it is a nourishing and refreshing combination that can be found in almost any bar of the city.

===Fast food===

Like in most of Sicily, you can get a freshly made cold Panini in a “salumeria”, where you choose whatever you want to put in (prosciutto cotto/crudo and cheese is probably the most popular). Don’t forget that most of them are closed between 1-4PM and on Sunday afternoon.
You can also have a ''tavola calda'' which mean “hot bite”, most of them made with cheese and meat, fried or baked. 
There is also the Sicilian specialty of Arancino, which are deep fried rice balls with various fillings, meat or eggplant or spinach, that sell at most places. They make a good lunch snack.
During the evening, food trucks that sell hot, tasty Panini with even horse meat inside. Most people add fries into the sandwich. Usually, they are very popular among teenagers. Because it's quite cheap, there is normally confusion at these kiosks. The last few years Kebab shops have popped up all the city around.

==Drink==
Most of the nightlife is centered around the Piazza Bellini and the surrounding streets. Usually there are more people drinking on the streets than inside the bars. Tuesday is student night and gets quite packed. Another spot usually with a good mix of locals and tourists is the bar and courtyard of the Agora Hostel, usually packed on Mondays with live music most weekend nights. The area around the castle has plenty of places to drink and eat too.

==Get out==
* '''[[Mount Etna]]''' - an area of volcanic landscape, with solidified "rivers" of lava. The top is 3,323 m high, so be prepared for the cold, even in summer. One bus a day runs at about 8:30AM from near the railway station via [[Nicolosi]] to the '''Rifugio Sapienza''', 1,400 m below the summit. You can also take the private train line ([http://www.circumetnea.it/ Circumetnea]) at Borgo metro station.
* '''Acicastello''' or [[Acitrezza]] with a nice medieval castle built on a giant rock, over the sea. Little fisherman village is well known for its giant rocks lying in the sea, supposed to be the ones thrown by the Cyclops at Ulysses. You will also find good restaurants and a great port. You could have a look for Acireale, a town known for the greatest carnival of Sicilia (in February). To go there by public transport take bus number 534 which terminates at Aci Trezza. '''Sicilian Sail''' do a nice one day sailing tour up to Acitrezza from the port of Catania which is a great way to see these beautiful sights. 
* '''[[Syracuse]]'''
* '''[[Taormina]]''', a world famous city, being both beautiful and the quintessential medieval town on a mountain top.
