==Understand==

==Get in==
*By plane
PAL Express part of Philippines airlines has flights to Calbayog & Catarman.
You can also arrive via the greater serviced Tacloban and catch the local bus/van across the the island

*By bus
Major bus companies in Manila plying the Luzon-Visayas-Mindanao route pass through the province since Maharlika Highway runs through the entire length of the province. Travelers to the province of Samar may ride bus from Metro Manila at the Ali Mall Bus Terminal in Cubao and from the various Pasay City terminals that sprout along EDSA.

==Get around==
Local mini buses ply from Catbalogan City to Tacloban City in Leyte and vice-versa and from Catbalogan to Calbayog and Catarman, Northern Samar and vice-versa. The schedule of inter-provincial run of local mini buses is irregular since it is dependent on the volume passengers and the pace of passengers loading into the buses.

On top of these buses, there are a number of passenger vans that ply Catbalogan and Calbayog route almost every half an hour. The vans also run the Catbalogan-Tacloban route almost every quarter of an hour and Calbayog-Allen-Catarman route almost every hour.

The last schedule of run of both inter-provincial mini buses and vans is up to late in the afternoon due to distance. There are few vans that ply in the evening. However, buses from Manila or Mindanao pass through the Maharlika Highway on a 24 hour basis. However, stops are only made either in Catbalogan City or Calbayog City.

From the two urban centers of Catbalogan City and Calbayog City, there are jeepneys that ply from the two localities going to the various towns of Samar.
