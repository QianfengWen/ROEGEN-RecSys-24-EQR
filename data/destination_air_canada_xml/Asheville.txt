According to Lonely Planet, "This Jazz Age gem of a city appears like a mirage out of the mists of the Blue Ridge Mountains".
Asheville is a popular tourist destination and is known as a liberal, artsy community. It was named one of the world's top 12 must-see destinations for by Frommer's travel guides. This "Paris of the South," has also been described as the "San Francisco of the East," "New Age Mecca," and "Land of the Sky." It's a city of which ''Rolling Stone'' magazine dubbed "America’s New Freak Capital." But Asheville is by no means simply a haven for Hippies and 'Out There's', as ''Money'' magazine has called Asheville one of the "Best Places to Retire," and AARP cites it as one of the "Best Places to Reinvent Your Life." ''Self'' magazine proclaims Asheville as America’s "Happiest City." PETA lists Asheville as "America's Best Vegetarian-Friendly Small City." Author Lee Pantas, in his guidebook The Ultimate Guide To Asheville & The Western North Carolina Mountains says it all in describing Asheville "as a city not easily forgotten once visited". In 2007, Asheville was named one of the top seven places to live in the U.S. by Forbes, and in 2011 Asheville was picked as one of the “10 Most Beautiful Places in America” by Good Morning America.

Winters are generally mild and major snow storms are rare- usually the area receives multiple snow flurries averaging an inch or two at a time, normally melting off in a day or two.

===Architecture===
Asheville is nationally renowned for its unique architecture, especially downtown and around the Biltmore Estate. The city suffered greatly during the Great Depression, and consequently little development happened during the time. This actually had a positive effect, as the city's famous Art Deco Architecture of the Roaring 20's was saved from destruction. Therefore, today, Asheville boasts the nations most complete collection of Art Deco structures. Other architectural styles, of course, are present in abundance throughout the city; from the Neo-Gothic Jackson Building "Skyscraper" to the Modern BB&T Tower.

Asheville does not necessarily have a specific commercial district but rather it resembles a long line, curving through the mountains. Beginning directly north of downtown, '''Merrimon Avenue''' has many low density restaurants and small shopping strip malls. It is the typical American shopping street and many locals consider it “The Strip.” As you move south towards the city-center, Merrimon Avenue changes names to '''Broadway''', then '''Biltmore Avenue''' after it intersects with '''Patton Avenue''' at Pack Square, home to the Vance Monument, located directly in front of City-County Plaza.

Surrounding this area, '''Downtown''', you will find many boutiques, cafes, museums, and interesting historical buildings. At the eastern end of downtown, The '''Beaucatcher Tunnel''' is carved directly into Sunset Mountain. The recently renovated street leading out of downtown and into the mountain goes into the edifice as '''College Street''' and comes out as Asheville’s most celebrated shopping street, '''Tunnel Road'''.

Tunnel Road is very commercial and hosts mostly large corporate chains. Recently, construction has boomed along this stretch, and reaching towards the skies above the restaurants and stores you will see some brand new hotels. Finally, Tunnel Road transitions into '''South Tunnel Road''', which is home to the city’s main mall and smaller chain shopping centers. This area of town is not at all touristy, and prices are average and intended for locals.

At the end of South Tunnel Road there is a vast shopping center that extends across the Swannanoa River and up over the mountain, eventually overlooking the Industrial district, containing a relatively new and quite controversial shopping complex along the river, having the city’s Super Walmart as its flagstore. It was built upon the rubble of the abandoned Sayles-Biltmore Bleachery, which used to bleach paper for the US Treasury's currency manufacture.

From Pack Square going south (away from I 240), Biltmore Ave continues down past '''Biltmore Village''' and into '''South Asheville''' and '''Arden''', with many chain stores and strip malls, from which one can access via '''NC 146 Long Shoals Rd''', '''Biltmore Park''' a recently built exurb with high end shopping around a reproduced downtown square.  

'''Downtown''' Asheville is full of neat and quirky shops and prides itself on the lack of corporate chain stores. Spend some time exploring downtown (it's very walkable) and see what you can find. Here are some highlights:
* <buy name="The Grove Arcade" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" email="" fax="" url="http://www.grovearcade.com" hours="" price="">A newly-restored and exquisite building built by E.W.

'''Hip Replacements''' [http://www.hipreplacementsclothing.com/] has some great vintage clothing, while up the block '''Spiritex''' [http://www.spiritex.net/ashevillestore.asp] offers a wide variety of sustainably produced clothing. Buy a used book or read the newspaper or a magazine at '''Downtown Books and News'''. Get a tattoo at '''Liquid Dragon''' [http://www.liquiddragontattoo.com/], and stop by one of the many restaurants on Lexington for a quick bite. On the next block up is the '''Chevron Trading Post''' [http://www.chevronbeads.com/] for all of your beading needs, and '''Tops for Shoes''' [http://www.topsforshoes.com/], the biggest shoe store in Asheville.  While many wonderful stores and hot spots along this street are facing increasing pressure from landlords who want to "gentrify" the area, Lexington is still the best place to get a taste of Asheville's counterculture.

'''Biltmore Village''' [http://www.biltmorevillage.com/] Just South of Asheville's downtown, and right outside the gates of the Biltmore Estate is the quaint village   built around the 1890's called Biltmore Village. It is easily accessed from I-40 (Exit 50). A number of small independently owned retail stores which have carved out specialty niches can be found intermingled with restaurants beneath the shade of the tree-lined streets. Recently, National Specialty stores and a boutique Hotel have begun construction there. Of particular note are the following:
* <buy name="New Morning Gallery" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" email="" fax="" url="http://www.newmorninggallerync.com/" hours="" price="">Probably the best collection of regional Arts and Crafts in Western North Carolina. The gallery features ceramics, glass, jewelry and furniture from local Appalachian artisans. It is in front of Bella Vista Art Gallery [http://www.bellavistaart.com/]</buy>

'''River Arts District''' [http://www.riverartsdistrict.com/] Wrapped along the river, and visible from the bridge over the French Broad River (i.e. from I-240 or Patton Ave.) is an enclave of Art Studios, Galleries, and restaurants that is still not quite user-friendly but accessible to the adventurous. Some worthy points of interest are:
*'''Asheville Glass Center and Gallery''' [http://www.ashevilleglass.com/] Glassblowing instruction and studio rentals and a glass gallery representing some of the regions finest glass artists.
*'''The Old Cotton Mill Building ''' [http://www.pottersmark.com/] Owned by Marty and Eileen Black and inhabited by a mixed group of artists and studios.
*'''The Phil Mechanic Building ''' [http://www.philmechanicstudios.com/] Cutting edge Galleries, artists and a Bio-diesel plant can be found if you wander around inside the old building. Jolene Mechanic, the owner, is a great resource for getting to know the area.
*'''240 Clingman''' [http://www.jonasgerard.com/] This was originally a warehouse. Right after the Katrina Hurricane it was turned into a gallery by the owners of Bella Vista Art Gallery [http://www.bellavistaart.com/]. After they left, Jonas Gerard, from Miami, took over the space. He was featured on 20/20 and has some eye-popping art on display, and for sale.
*'''The Wedge''' Filled with little art galleries, artists, a brewery, fine porcelain [http://www.cravenhofman.com/] and mechanical dinosaurs is interesting but not for the timid.

Head away from downtown and visit the '''WNC Farmer's Market''' [http://www.ncagr.com/markets/facilit/farmark/ashevill/] for a huge selection of locally grown and produced crops 'n' crafts. You could spend hours and still not see everything.

==Drink==
Liquor is available by the drink in Asheville, but if you want to buy liquor by the bottle you must do it at state-run ABC (Alcoholic Beverage Commission) stores rather than at a traditional liquor store. These stores have limited exterior decorations so they can be difficult to find.  Open containers of alcohol are never permitted on the street; if you order a beverage you must finish it before leaving the restaurant or bar. Beer and wine are available for purchase at most markets, grocery stores and gas stations. The alcohol laws of the state prohibit the sale of alcohol after 2AM Monday through Saturday, and from 2AM until noon on Sundays. Pick up a copy or check the website of the local alternative newsweekly Mountain Xpress [http://www.mountainx.com/clubland/] for an up-to-date, detailed guide for what is going on at each bar and club for the night.

It's one of the pricier Asheville options, but for good reason. You could spend hours exploring the hotel and still not see everything. In the winter months it houses the The National Gingerbread House Competition & Display and entries range from the heartfelt efforts of elementary age children to fantastic creations that must have taken months to prepare (a few years ago the grand prize in the adult category went to an elaborate and amazing reproduction of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry). The hotel even has its own ghost, the '''Pink Lady''' [http://shadowboxent.brinkster.net/lemurpinklady.html]. Even if you can't afford to stay here, stop by the bar and lounge right through the front entrance for a cocktail or, in the winter, some delicious hot cocoa by the roaring fireplace.

==Cope==

==Stay Safe==

Panhandling, sometimes aggressive, is a significant problem in several parts of downtown and adjoining areas, particularly after dark. During the day, transient and distressed individuals often congregate in the areas near Pritchard Park, the Civic Center, Pack Library, Pack Square, and along I-240. Between the Beaucatcher tunnel and South Tunnel Road, the area is frequented by street prostitutes and drug dealers. Some parts of Montford and West Asheville have experienced frequent break-ins and assaults. Tourists are advised to avoid all of these areas after dark.

A thirty-mile drive south to '''Flat Rock''' will bring you to the '''Flatrock Playhouse''' [http://www.flatrockplayhouse.org/] where dramas, comedies, and musicals are shown April through December. Also in Flat Rock is the '''Carl Sandburg Home'''. This historic site consists of a 22 room house, barns, sheds, rolling pastures, walking trails, two small lakes, ponds, flower and vegetable gardens, and an orchard. 

A thirty-mile drive west to '''Waynesville''' during the last weeks of July will bring you to '''Folkmoot''' [http://www.folkmoot.com/], a festival of song and dance staged by performance groups from around the world.  

The town of '''Brevard''', an hour drive southwest, hosts the '''Brevard Music Festival''' [http://www.brevardmusic.org/index.php] each summer. Lasting almost two months, a variety of musical events ranging from grand operas and symphony orchestras to Broadway musicals and pop concerts as well as renowned guest artists are featured.

A 45 minute drive north brings you to the '''Hot Springs Resort and Spa''' [http://nchotsprings.com/]. Reserve the jacuzzi-style tub of your choice, all individually enclosed and private. Bring a bottle of champagne and spend an hour or two. '''Hot Springs''' also has a few campgrounds and is passed through by the [[Appalachian Trail]]. 

The '''Cradle of Forestry''' [http://www.cradleofforestry.com/] is located about 20 miles southwest of Asheville off U.S. Highway 276 in the Pisgah National Forest in Transylvania County. Visitors will find a number of hiking trails in the area. Open 9AM-5PM, mid April through the end of October. $5 for adults, 16 and under free. 

A popular tourist attraction is '''Chimney Rock Park''' [http://www.chimneyrockpark.com], located 25 miles (about a 30 minute drive) southeast of Asheville in scenic Hickory Nut Gorge.  It's a privately owned park (not part of the US system) with a fairly high admission fee ($14 for adults as of 2009), but the views are incredible and there are six different hiking trails, ranging in difficulty from easy-to-moderate to moderate-to-strenuous. Open all year. 

The '''[[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]]''' is on the border of North Carolina and Tennessee and is the country's most visited national park. A variety of trails for hikers of any age or skill level are available.

'''Gorges State Park''' [http://www.ils.unc.edu/parkproject/visit/gorg/home.html] is approximately 45 miles southwest of Asheville, located in Transylvania County and joins the North Carolina/South Carolina state line. Gorges State Park has over 80 inches of rain a year making it a temperate rain forest. The plunging waterfalls, rugged river gorges, sheer rock walls, and concentration of rare and unique species makes this a wonderful park to visit.
