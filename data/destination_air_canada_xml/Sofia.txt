'''Sofia''' (София) is the capital of [[Bulgaria]]. It is also the biggest city in the country with about 1.7 million citizens (including suburbs). Today, Sofia is a dynamic Eastern European capital, distinguished by its unique combination of European and Communist-style architecture as well as many beautiful orthodox churches. Furthermore, it claims to be one of the few European capitals with beautiful scenery and a developed ski-resort so close to it - the Vitosha mountain.

When planning a visit to Sofia, keep in mind the major national holidays (Christmas, Orthodox Easter, 1st, 6th and 24th of May, 6th of September). During these holidays the city is deserted as most citizens take advantage of the long weekend and travel on vacation. Most small shops and galleries close for the holidays. 

===History===
Sofia was founded 2,500 years ago. Over the centuries, it has been given several names - Serdica , Sredetz and the remains of the old cities can still be viewed today. Because of its strategic location in the middle of Balkans for a while it had been selected for a new capital of the Roman Empire.
Near Sofia is the Boyana church, one of the most valuable memorials of Bulgarian and European culture. The church has frescoes, acclaimed by specialists as “the best examples of Eastern medieval art during its twelve century history”.

The decline of Sofia during the Turkish Ottoman Empire was followed by the rejuvenation after the Russian liberation in 1878, when Sofia was chosen as the capital of Bulgaria at the First National Constituent Assembly, and followed by a brisk and straight-forward period of construction.

Springs and autumns in Sofia are short with variable and dynamic weather.

The city receives an average annual precipitation of 591 mm (23.27 in), reaching its peak in the beginning of the summer when thunderstorms are common.

There are shops, cafes, post offices, ATMs, and money exchange offices at the airport. For more details, see the [https://www.sofia-airport.bg/en/passengers/services airport website].

There is a [https://www.sofia-airport.bg/en/passengers/and-airport/inter-terminal free shuttle bus] operating between the terminals every 30 minutes between 5:00 AM and 7:00AM and 7:00PM to 1100PM and every 15 minutes between these times. Outside of those hours, a free shuttle bus can be requested at the information desk or you can use Bus #84 (see below).

To travel between the airport and the city centre:

* '''[http://www.metrosofia.com/en/sofia-airport Sofia Metro Line 4 (Blue)]''' operates service to the airport between 5:30 and 24:00. The stop is located in the eastern part of Terminal 2. The journey to the city centre takes 20-30 minutes. The journey to the central bus station takes approximately 30 minutes and a transfer is required. A single ticket costs 1.60 lev. You do not need new ticket when making the transfer from one metro line to another.

* '''Public Bus #84''' operates service between both terminals and the city centre. The journey takes 30-40 minutes. Tickets can be purchased from news stands or ticket machines in the airport. A single ticket costs 1.60 lev. If you are traveling with luggage bigger than 60х40х40, you will need to punch an additional ticket for each item or possibly pay a fine of 40 lev. Make sure to have a ticket with you and validated it after boarding because this bus is the one that inspectors love to check the most (because of the highest rate of fines).  The bus makes a stop at Orlov Most (Sofia University metro station), where you can transfer to the metro. 

* '''Public Bus #384''' operates services between Terminal 2 and the nearby neighbourhood Druzhjba. The line operates only in the rush hours and makes a connection to the Metroline. It does not go to the city center. 

* '''Taxi''' service from the airport is regulated. [https://www.oktaxi.net/ OK Supertrans AD] is the contracted taxi operator from the airport. It is best to request a taxi either from the taxi stand or the taxi office. Beware of touts offering taxi service as well as fake taxis with the fake "OK" logo! A taxi to the city center will cost approximately 15 lev. The regulated taxi fare is: initial fee of 0.70 lev, price per km 0.79 lev in the day or 0.90 lev at night, price per minute of stay of 0.22 lev, price for ordering a taxi via phone of 0.50 lev.

Since July 2015 there are coloured paths (Terminal 2) to the different types of transport. An yellow one will lead you to the taxi stand, a blue one will guide you to the metro station and a red one is for the bus station.

[[Image:Sofia_Central_Bus_Station.jpg|thumb|Sofia Central Bus Station]]

====Central bus station====
'''[http://www.centralnaavtogara.bg/ Sofia Central Bus Station (Centralna Avtogara/Централна автогара)]''' is in the north part of the city centre and is within walking distance to the central attractions. Schedules and fares are available in Bulgarian online. 

[http://www.eurolines.bg/?page=5&lang_id=2 Eurolines Bulgaria] is the largest operator of international buses to/from Bulgaria. Buses operate to/from [[Belgrade]] (5 hours, €23) and other cities in [[Serbia]], [[Vienna]] (15.5 hours, €59) and other cities in [[Austria]], [[Paris]] (36 hours, €120) and other cities in [[France]], [[Berlin]] (28 hours, €110) and other cities in [[Germany]], [[Budapest]] (11-13 hours, €48), and [[Prague]] (21 hours, €63).

[http://www.matpu.com/bg_international_lines.php MATPU 96] is the largest operator of buses in Bulgaria. The schedule is available in Bulgarian online. Buses operate several times per day to/from [[Skopje]] (5.5 hours, €15).

====Other bus stations====
In addition, there are 3 smaller bus stations that serve only local destinations. The bus to [[Samokov]] operates from the south station (near Жолио Кюри Metro Station).

===By train===

There are trains to/from Varna (8hrs, 34 leva), Burgas (7hrs07, 21 leva) or Plovdiv (2hrs40, 10 leva), as well as other cities in the country.

International trains provide a large number of routes to Sofia, arriving from such places as [[Kiev]], [[Istanbul]], [[Vienna]], [[Belgrade]], [[Bucharest]], [[Moscow]] and other common cities. Always check in the local train stations for the most up to date information. Due to the refugee situation, border closings may be installed, causing some lines to be cancelled.

The train to Istanbul is called the Balkan train and runs once daily in each direction. It leaves from Sofia at 20:40, arriving in Istanbul at 07:18 the next morning. There are a few stops within Bulgaria, but after the Turkish border it continues its way without any more stops until Istanbul. It leaves from Istanbul at 22:30, arriving in Sofia at 09:10 the next day. It costs 70 leva.

The primary trains from [[Bucharest]] to Sofia, and back, run twice daily through the border cities of [[Giurgiu]] and [[Rousse|Ruse]]. For example, recent trains are scheduled from Bucharest to Sofia in the daytime departing 12:45/arriving 22:25 and a night train departing 20:04/arriving 06:00. From Sofia to Bucharest there are also two trains: a) Sofia 09:00 - Bucharest 18:58 and b) Sofia 19:30 - Bucharest 05:44. One way ticket is 140 Romanian Leu. Discounts are available for under 25s. Passport control and customs takes place in Giurgiu (RO) and Ruse (BG), approximately mid-trip.

There are two trains from Sofia to [[Thessaloniki]] and vice versa each day. One way tickets cost €16.80, return tickets cost €33.60.
Train 360 towards Sofia departs from Thessaloniki at 06:55 and arrives at 14:07, train 361 to Thessaloniki departs from Sofia at 15:00 and arrives at 22:22.
Train 1461, coming from Bucharest, leaves Sofia at 23:50 to arrive in Thessaloniki at 06:30 the next morning. The opposite direction of this route is served by train 1460 leaving Thessaloniki at 23:10 and arriving in Sofia at 05:50.

[[Image:Sofia,_train_on_Poduene_Station.jpg|thumb|A train on Poduene Station]]

From Belgrade: 10h, one overnight train. Return ticket cost €41.20 and €6 for couchette reservation.

All services are operated by the Bulgarian State Railways [http://www.bdz.bg/], whose schedules are available on the internet in English. 

The main railway station (''Tsentralna Gara'') can be somewhat confusing. Domestic departures go from the main terminal and that is where you can buy tickets for domestic travel. If you want to travel to an international destination, upon entering the station from the front, turn to your left, walk past the heated waiting room on your left (and some small shops) and go to the office at the end of the wide corridor with "RILA" on it. It is straight ahead of you. They speak some English and to book a ticket you will need your passport. Credit cards are accepted.

Platforms can be accessed from the main floor down the escalators at the far left corner. Platform numbering is somewhat confusing: Roman numerals indicate the platform number (I to VI), and Arabic numerals (1 to 12) indicate the actual track. Each platform is divided into East and West. Departures and arrivals are indicated on reliable electronic panels, but beware: they indicate the track number, not the platform!

The rail travel and ticketing in Bulgaria is unique. When buying a round trip, you have to obtain a second stamp on your ticket at the cashier before boarding the train on the return journey. Otherwise you will have to pay a fine to the conductor or be kicked off the train to get the stamp.

On 26 April 2016 the central railway station was reopened after nearly 2 years of renovation. The new station has new waiting rooms, solar panels, more security and is more accessible to disabled people.

===By car===

Access to Bulgaria's Capital is via several entry points:
 
[[Image:Magistrala-Trakia-pri-Vakarel.jpg|thumb|Trakiya highway]]

1. From the North & South via E79/A6  
2. From the East - via Thrace Highway E80/A1-A3  or from the old road paralelling the E80 Highway - Zlatitza - Pirdop - Pazardzhik route.
3. From the West - via A1/E80 Liking the city and the Bulgarian-Serbian Border point of Kalotina.
* A1 connects Sofia to Burgas on the Black Sea.
* A2 is planned to be from Sofia to Varna and as of July, 2013 it ends at Yablanitsa and continues from Shumen to Varna.
* A3 is planned to be from Varna to Burgas, but currently has only a few kilometers built.
* A4 connects Sofia with Turkey. With the completion of Highway "Maritsa" this road is completed.

Otherwise coming from Greece the road E79/A6  is in very good shape, so the 300 km from Thessaloniki are done fairly fast if you don't happen to fall into Friday/Sunday traffic jams in the area of Sofia or Pernik. 

Coming from the Republic of Macedonia, via Kiustendil the roads are relatively good but driving within speed limits would avoid you much hassle caused either by traffic police, or road conditions. From Central Europe you can drive almost the whole length on highways (via Slovenia-Croatia-Serbia or Hungary-Serbia), with only the last 100 km between Niš in Southern Serbia and Sofia being heavily trafficked mountain roads around the Nishava ravine in not the best shape.

Note that the highways are poorly lighted and some sections are very old and in bad shape ("Trakiya" from Plovdiv to Sofia and the entire Hemus section).

The legal speed is:
* 50km/h in towns and populated areas
* 90km/h on the regular roads
* 140km/h on highways

The fines for speeding starts from 20 leva (for up to 10km/h over the speed limit) and has no top limit. Usually traffic police does not stop cars on the highways but they do stop cars on the regular roads quite often. If somebody (the car on the other lane) blinks with his high beams to you that means there are traffic police ahead. The policemen are known for taking bribes but do not be tempted as there are cameras on them or in their car so you might end up in jail. The fines are not so strict so better take your card and pay the fine. 

Seat belts (front and rear passengers) and low beam lights are mandatory at all times. 

Some drivers can be quite aggressive. There are a lot of traffic rules violations - most of them not a big deal but you need to keep your both eyes.

Avoid buying fuel from the small gas stations as it might be tempered. The prices there are lower but it isn't worth the risk. There is a well developed network of petrol and gas stations around the country. Some of the big ones are: Shell, OMV, Eko, Lukoil, Petrol, Rompetrol.

==Get around==

=== By public transport ===
[[Image:Sofia Trolley.jpg|thumb|A trolley in Sofia on line 11.]]
[[File:Serdika Metro station.jpg|thumb|Serdika Metro station]]
Sofia has a well-developed and efficient public transport system ([http://www.sumc.bg/en/]) that consists of buses, trolleys, trams, subway. The public transport operates from 5AM to about 12AM. From 7th of April 2018 there is an experimental program that operates 4 night lines of public bus transport between aprox. 12AM and 4:30AM. The ticket costs 2 leva and you can purchase it from a dedicated person inside the bus. Keep the ticket as it is for the '''entire night''' and you don't have to buy another one if switching lines. The bus lines have one common point (Knyaz Alexander I Batemberg sq.) where you can transfer to any of the other night buses. Buses stops only if you press the STOP button inside the bus or if you wave at them when you are outside of the bus. Otherwise they will not stop on each station. Each bus have security cameras and the drivers have a panic button in case of a malicious activity. In case the driver press it a police car will arrive shortly. The experimental program will run by the end of 2018 and is unsure if it will continue after that. You can find a map and a timetable [https://www.sofiatraffic.bg/media/uploads/sumc-night-map.png here]. Unfortunately the night buses don't go the Airport and if you have a night flight you should use the only option - taxi.

From June, 1st 2016 the public service will cost 1.60 lev per ticket, the carnet of 10 tickets (Card with coupons for ten travels for one passenger) will cost 12 leva. The fine for not having a ticket will be 40 leva (approximately 20 €)

There are several kinds of tickets and cards in Sofia. The single ride ticket costs 1.60 Lev - 0.80 Euro, and is valid for a single ride, without limitation of time or distance. After buying the ticket, you must stamp it inside the vehicle with the yellow stamp-machines (perforators). Another option for multi-travelling is buying a Card with coupons for ten travels for one passenger, the principle is the same with the rides. Such court of 10 tickets costs 12 Leva - 6 Euro. Beware that one such court cannot be used by two or more people on the same time, and the 10-th ticket must always be preserved and shown upon request to the ticket inspectors (this is to make sure that you are not using a punched ticket that you found on the bus). You can still use your 10th ticket - you just pinch it the last.

If you do buy a ticket from the bus driver, but don’t  understand the precise instructions on the ticket ''which are written only in Bulgarian,'' and encounter a ticket inspector, having bought a ticket will not help you, and you will have to choose between paying a fine on the spot or having further adventures with the Sofia police. Bulgarian prisons have featured in the TV series “The world’s harshest prisons.”

Tickets for the subway are obtainable only from the ticket machines or kiosks inside the stations. The normal tickets for buses or trams are not valid there. Also the ticket for the subway is valid only for 30 minutes after buying it (you cannot buy a few subway tickets in advance to use later)! You could also use a smartphone app called [https://tickey.me/ Tickey]. You can purchase tickets for the subway from it. It only works for couple of the center stations so be aware when you use it.

If you are planning a stay in Sofia, it is best to rely on single-day-cards. Such card costs 4 Leva - 2 Euros, and is valid for all buses, trams, trolleybuses and the subway. The card is stamped by the kiosk seller so you don't have to worry about stamping it inside the vehicles. It is valid after stamped until the closing time of the transport, so around 23:30 - 00:00. The subscription cards are not valid for the experimental night buses. You can also buy the daily ticket for the next or another day, by simply telling that to the employee, and he will put the appropriate date stamp of the next or another day, you wish to travel. Just find a kiosk where this card is sold, and buy every single morning such a card, and travel as much as you like. The card is valid for a single person only! Oddly enough, when using the day ticket in the Metro system, you must first go the manned ticket booth next to the sliding access doors to have it checked before each use. You present your day card wordlessly to the employee in the booth, who will scan the ticket with a bar code reader and release it for its next use. If you fail to do so, inserting the ticket in the access door reader will cause it to flash red and the doors will not slide open to let you pass through.

Another option to buy daily and nightly cards online is by using [https://sofia.mpass.bg sofia.mpass.bg] service. It is a service operated by the Public transport authority and allows for buying daily and nightly cards using either credit card or SMS (for local carriers only). After buying the card you will get a QR code. It will be valid till the end of the day (for the daily card) or for the duration of the night transport (for nighly cards). The QR code must be scanned on the tickets machines when entering the metro and to present the QR for manual scan by the control personal on busses, trams, and trolleys. Please watch the video on the website how to scan the code correctly as it may be tricky. If for some reason the code cannot be scanned contact the person in the booth and ask them for support. They would usually let you in by the gate for disabled people. Overall it is a very convenient way to purchase a card if you don't want to buy a physical one all the time. The cost is 4 leva for daily and 2 leva for nightly one.

For the subway, you can buy an electronic card that costs 1 BGN then charge it with ten trips for the price of 12 BGN. When you return the card, you get your 1 BGN back. This is recommended if you are going to use the metro at least ten times as you can avoid queuing to buy a ticket every time (and it is also 20% cheaper).

The ticketing system is simple. The whole city belongs to the same tariff zone, including the suburbs and the neighboring villages, where a public transportation from Sofia goes. The only exceptions are the lines 103 and 66, where tickets are bought from the driver only and act as an attraction lines. 

If you are traveling by public transport with a large suitcase or backpack, be sure to buy a separate ticket for your bag/case if sum of its dimensions are larger than 140cm (eg.60x40x40cm) or you might be fined! You need no an extra ticket for luggage on the metro. The fine for not having a ticket is 40 BGN. If you have no ticket for yourself and a big bag, that would be 80 BGN. 

The ticket inspectors are not always present but they can be rough if you don't have a valid ticket or you argue with them. Keep in mind that they not always understand other language than Bulgarian. Sometimes they are accompanied by a police car so if you are too aggressive about why you don't have a ticket you might end up in the local police office. If you do have a valid ticket you won't have any troubles. 

[[Image:Sofia_metro_train_2012_PD_3.jpg|thumb|Sofia Metro train at Tsarigradsko shose Metro Station]]
There are 15 tram lines, 9 trolley lines, 93 bus lines and three metro lines. Some of the buses cover the area outside the city center including neighboring villages. Useful routes are bus #84 from both terminals of the airport to the center; from the train/bus station to Orlov most - bus #213 or #214 or tram #1, #7 and #18 to Vitosha Street and Nedelya Square, #1, #6, #7 to the National Palace of Culture, #18 to Slaveykov square or #6 to Macedonia square.

The subway (metro) in Sofia has three lines - Red (M1), Blue (M2), and Green (M3). The Red line (Lulin, Obelya) goes through the city center to the southeast. Half of the trains continue to the airport and the other half to Mladost. The Blue line goes through the city center as well connecting Nadezhda r.d. (Lomsko shose), Central Train Station with city center ending at Vitosha station. Both lines meet at the Serdika station where one can transfer using a single ticket. One of the main stations in the center of town is called "NDK" or "National Palace of Culture" (НДК/Национален Дворец на Културата in Bulgarian) - keep in mind that both names refer to the same station. The Green line goes through the city center and connects Hadzi Dimitar r.d. and Krasno Selo r.d. (eventually Gorna Banya and trains to Pernik). It passes through "NDK", Sv. Patriarh Evtimiy, and Orlov Most (Eagles Bridge).

=== On foot ===
Streets have adequate tiled pavements, especially in the city centre. However, they are frequently uneven and potholed, and walking is further made difficult by parked cars, street vendors and cafes. Except for areas in the very centre, pavements rarely have slopes for wheelchair access or designated lanes for bicycle riders. Pedestrian crossings are numerous and are relatively respected by drivers. Use pedestrian underpasses to cross large intersections, though avoid ones in the suburbs as these are usually derelict.

=== By mini-bus ===
Mini-buses (marshrutki) are relatively tourist unfriendly. They are numbered and their route is written on the window but only in Cyrillic. The big advantage is that they do not observe all traffic rules in rush hour and get you to your destination faster than public buses or taxis. They do not stop at bus stops unless you signal them! They stop if you just wave a hand and usually are fast way to go somewhere without need to change the car. You pay to the driver when you get on the car. Prices are 1,50 leva (about 0,75 euro). To get off: when the minibus is close to your destination you need to tell the driver where and when you want to get off. Keep in mind that they run on certain main roads but in cases of congested traffic (like morning or evening) the drivers slightly alter the route and take side streets to skip the traffic jam.

=== By taxi ===
Taxis in Sofia are yellow. Taxis can be caught on the streets or can be ordered by phone, they arrive fast and are reliable. A drive inside Sofia will rarely exceed 10lv and a trip from the airport to the city center between 8 lv and 15 lv. There are many companies offering taxi services, some of them are OK Supertrans taxi (973 2121), €1 Taxi, "962-22-26", Yellow Taxi (91119) and Radio CV Taxi (91263) with fares around 0,70 leva (0,35€) per kilometer. There is a small fee for calling a taxi to your address usually about 0,70 leva. Please check the phone number and the prices before you board, because there are some taxis trying to imitate the most popular ones, but having outrageous prices (up to 5,90 leva (3,00€) per kilometer by letting you believe that it is 0,59 leva) on them and usually hang around hotels, shopping malls and tourist spots picking on unsuspecting customers, its the top line for the per km fares and bottom line for time you need to look at. The general rule is that if a taxi driver comes to you and offers you a drive, never accept it because they will try to rip you off.
For short rides in the city center where there are many one way streets it is sometimes better to walk to your destination than taking a taxi. Be clear about your destination and don't let them take you to the scenic route resulting in higher bill. They play this even to the locals so foreigners are particularly vulnerable. Also be aware that the taxi drivers may refuse to take you for short distances (like 1-2 kilometers) so in these cases you can negotiate a flat fare and the taxi driver won't use the meter.

=== By scooter ===

[https://www.li.me/electric-scooter Lime] and [https://www.bird.co/ Bird] electric scooters are available in Sofia and can be easily found in the city center. There seems to be more Lime scooters.
Both services charge 1.5 BGN for unlocking and then 0.30 BGN per minute.

=== Rent-a-Car ===
[[Image:Road_junction_@_Sitnyakovo_blvd,_Sofia.jpg|thumb|Tsarigradsko shose, one of the busiest boulevards in Sofia]]
Renting a car is possible, but not necessarily a good idea if you are not used to driving here. Be prepared for traffic jams and disorganized traffic. Parking is a major problem. To park you can use tickets for parking in the so-called Blue Zone (sinya zona/синя зона) and Green Zone (zelena zona/зелена зона). These tickets can be purchased from the people wearing bright green jackets, hanging around the parking lots. The tickets should be clearly marked with pen and placed on the dashboard so they are clearly visible. The price is 2 leva per 1 hour for the Blue Zone and 1 lev per hour for the Green Zone. The easier and more convenient way is to text the vehicle registration number from a Bulgarian mobile phone to "1302" - Blue Zone and "1303" - Green Zone. Five minutes before the prepaid time is up you will receive a warning SMS. You can either send another message for another hour or move your car. Zone parking is valid Mon - Fri 08:30 AM - 20:30:PM, Sat 08:00 AM - 20:00 PM.

Pay attention to this traffic rule: "If a tram, bus, or trolley stops and is on the left side of your car you must stop in your lane and behind it, ie. public transportation vehicle should be on your left side and in front of your car." It is because tram rails are in the middle of the road and tram station is on the pavement so passengers will exit the right side of the vehicle into the road. Even buses have bus stops in the middle of a road.

Car hire can be a good idea if planning day trips or longer from Sofia.

The currency in Bulgaria is the Lev, plural of Leva. You will also see the abbreviation lv. (лв.) or the ISO code - BGN. 
The currency exchange rate is fixed at 1 EUR = 1.95583 BGN. Exchange rate to any other currency (except for the EUR) is not fixed directly, but published by the Bulgarian National Bank [http://www.bnb.bg/Statistics/StExternalSector/StExchangeRates/StERForeignCurrencies/index.htm] and is used as a benchmark in the exchange offices and banks. 

Currency exchange offices and most banks offer a buy rate of 1.95 BGN and a sell rate of 1.96 BGN to 1 EUR.  However, at the airport and train station, the rates may differ substantially. During business days, it is strongly advisable to use banks for exchanging money. Although there are some really good exchange stalls giving you up to 1.955BGN/EUR, be aware of those who switch the digits giving you 1.59BGN/EUR. It's also possible to change money 24/7 in casinos where the rate is good, but you are required to play even some. ATMs on all major credit card issuers (Visa, Mastercard, Amex, Diner's, etc.) are widely available, although you have to watch for your daily withdrawal limit imposed by your card-issuing bank. 
Credit cards are widely accepted, but in small souvenir stores or restaurants; you will definitely need to carry some cash. 

'''Souvenirs''' can be bought in many small shops in the subways in front of the old Party House and in the metro station at the Largo. The Ethnographic Museum has a small shop tightly crammed with souvenirs of all kinds from all over Bulgaria (on the right, just as you enter the main entrance). Antiques and souvenirs can also be found in Alexander Nevski square, in stalls just opposite the church.

==Eat==
For information on typical Bulgarian foods, see [[Bulgaria#Eat]].

===Budget===
====Fast food====
You can easily find takeaway food in Sofia. For less than 2 leva you can get a slice of pizza, a hotdog or a sandwich. You can get more traditional Bulgarian food in bakeries, offering banitsa and other kinds of pastry. This food is often consumed with ayrian or boza. Another possibility is to get a katma, which is a big pancake filled with cheese, ham, jelly or chocolate. 

Pizzeria-type restaurants and snack bars can be found all over Sofia. Although many are very uninteresting for the traveller looking for a meal with a local flavour, some include excellent Bulgarian dishes.

====Soups====
The soup places usually have daily menu of 4-5 different soups, nice interior and reasonable prices. These places are popular for a luncheon during the working days but there are also a few soup-restaurants that stay open 24/7 and are great for party people to have something to eat in the morning after the long night out.

==Drink==
Smoking inside a bar or restaurant is prohibited by law. However, there are many bars and clubs where after 1-2 am smoking inside is allowed. They don't give ashtrays because officially smoking inside is prohibited so don't be surprised if you ask for an ashtray but you receive а saucer or a cup. Light a cigarette only if other people have already done so. There are rare inspections by the government and if caught you (and not the bar!) have to pay the fine. You have to go outside to smoke but all bars have designated smoking areas near the entrance which even has a heater in the cold winter months. 

There is a noise ban and especially in the Sofia city centre, the bars have to close their outdoor area by 10 pm. If you stay outside they will offer to accommodate you inside. Some bars have frequent problems with their neighbours (those along Shishman street) and won't allow you to go outside with your drink to have a cigarette. In the summer months, you can still enjoy having beers on the streets or in the parks, everyone does so! Just don't be too noisy. Note that there are a lot of (old) people living in the centre and if you are too noisy they can directly call the police and complain. 

===Most common drinks===
Wine is, together with beer and grape rakia, among the most popular alcoholic beverages in the country. Grape growing and wine production have a long history in Bulgaria, dating back to the times of the Thracians. 

* Rakia is widely considered to be а national drink produced by the distillation of fermented fruit. The alcohol content of rakia is normally 40% ABV, but home-produced rakia can be stronger (typically 50% to 60%). Homemade rakia is hard to find on the markets in Sofia. 
* Stolichno is a Bulgarian bock beer. The beer was originally brewed at Sofia's Ariana Brewery (hence the name, which literally means "of the capital city"). It is a strong beer with an ABV of 6.5%.
* Boza is a popular fermented beverage. It is a malt drink, made from wheat. It has a thick consistency and a low alcohol content (usually around 1%) and has a sweet flavour. It is popular with breakfast and it is not served in bars.

===Bars===
Many cafeterias and bars are located on Vitosha Street. Most of them are open-air places with cosy atmospheres and are very popular in Summer. Due to some noise regulations, all bars and restaurants in the city centre have to close their gardens after 10 pm and guests are encouraged to move indoors. Fines are serious and neighbours would call the police to complain of the noise, so do not be surprised if a waiter or waitress tells you that they are closing the bar at 10 pm, normally they mean that just the garden is closing. This is another reason why sometimes bartenders may refuse to give you a drink if you want to drink it outside the bar.


* Skaptobara [https://www.facebook.com/skaptobara] Skaptobara is a cosy bar, nestling in the heart of Sofia - at Bacho Kiro and Iskar streets. It is famous for its relaxed atmosphere, delicious food, good music and drinks. It is also the only university bar in Bulgaria, run by alumni of the American University in Bulgaria and always attracting a lot of English-speaking folks.
  
* JJ Murphys Irish pub [http://www.jjmurphys.com/]

* '''Clubhouse 19th Hole''', Str. Hristo Belchev 6. New Irish bar with a big variety of drinks, great food and good company. In the summer there is a nice outside garden to enjoy your drinks. Also shows every important sports event on TV.

* '''One More Bar'''  12 Tsar Ivan Shishman Str. [https://www.facebook.com/OneMoreBar] The house where the bar is was built in 1909, in the late 20th c., and it became a kindergarten. Today's bar owners encourage people to share their old memories and inside visitors can see many pictures of kids from this kindergarten. Cocktails are nice and the place is popular among open-minded people of all ages. Drinks start from 4 EUR.

* '''Sputnik'''  17 Yanko Sakazov Str. (right next to Zaimov park) [https://www.facebook.com/CocktailBarSputnik/] It is right next to Raketa Rakia Bar and is run by the same owners. The place mixes traditional Bulgarian drinks and modern trends.

===Nightlife===
* <drink name="Apartment" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" url="http://a-part-mental.org/?lang=en" hours="" price="" lat="" long="" email="" fax="">Popular among locals as well as foreigners is the "Apartamenta", some sort of private club in the second floor of a turn of the 19th century mansion where you find a series of rooms, all in different styles and wall-drawings, colourful tapestries, etc. Go to the right, get a drink in the kitchen (everything non-alcoholic is 4 lv), and just pick and choose a room which looks cosy enough (shouldn't be too hard to find one with all the couches lying around). If you love music, there are Mac computers in most of the rooms where you can pick something out of the playlist. Have a game of chess. There is also a cinema room, if there is nothing running just go in, pick a movie out of the list and start the projection.

There are also some tables on the court and lights decorating the trees illuminate the scene.

==Stay safe==
Sofia is a pretty safe city compared to most bigger U.S. and European cities. You should keep common sense and avoid getting into conflicts with locals, also going into dark alleys and parks during the night.

Here is some advice:

'''Cars'''
If you have a car, you are recommended to park it in a paid guarded lot. Parking in the center is difficult; although you can find free spaces, the Bulgarian police tends to behave harshly towards foreign license plates. Even though the other cars appear to be parked legitimately, double check that there are no signs or pavement markings prohibiting it. If you drive out of the city (or enter the country by road) you must have a vignette (винетка) on every high-way. Buy it right away at the border (even though no one will tell you to and there may not be signs) or before leaving Sofia (rental car) from any fuel station, or online via the official webpage: https://web.bgtoll.bg/. The price (2022) is 15 leva or 8 euro for one week; other validity periods include: one-month (30 leva), one-year (97 leva), one-quarter (54 leva) and one-weekend (10 leva). The fine, if you forget the vignette, is about 200 leva.

Car lights are compulsory at all times.

'''Places to avoid at night'''
Generally at night, you should avoid the area around the Bus and Train Station*, Maria Luiza Blvd, the Parks (around the Palace of Culture and Borisova). This is especially true for single women and girls. Junkies get high there, prostitutes (both female and transsexual) offer their "services", some people might want to tempt you with touts of contraband (stolen, illegal, etc.) and/or then try to mug you. These areas are also frequented with the homeless and the drunk. If your hotel is in the area you'll be alright, just don't hang around it unnecessarily. Try to act like you are familiar with the area (and farmiliarize yourself during the day) and look like a local. As long as you avoid the poorly lit areas, the centre is okay, stick to the well-lit areas such as Vitoshka, the Largo, the Sheraton hotel, the Ivan Vazov theater and Voennia Klub (Military Club). It is wise to choose a hotel/hostel in a better location, such as the ones listed above. 
If you are renting a car or happens to be in a traffic accident try to remain calm. There are more and more accidents these days (2016) where people that are part of the car crash get out of the cars and fight each other. If the other party is angry or aggressive better stay away and call 112 as soon as possible. Make sure there are witnesses. The majority of people are nice and calm and will help you out!

Avoid football fan groups, they tend to be drunk and aggressive. Avoid wearing football shirts or scarves of the Sofia-based football teams, especially on match days.

'''Justice system'''
Foreigners may find themselves in serious difficulty if they get into any legal trouble. 
Beware that the drug carrying and usage is strictly illegal and Bulgaria has very harsh penalties for consuming and carrying even the smallest amount of drug. 

'''Taxis'''
Be careful with taxis, make sure you check the prices first before you get in (the fare is per kilometer and it should be - as of 2022 - something like 1.10 during the day and 1.30 during the night, avoid cabs that display their fare as above 1.50), also make sure the cab has the driver's card on the front with his name. If arriving at the Sofia International Airport - Terminal 2 or 1 - and you need a taxi, order it ONLY from the stands inside the Arrivals zone - there are two stands, one for OK Supertrans and one for 91280 Taxi companies, with people who will escort you to your ordered taxi. Do not accept offers by taxi drivers standing near the exits, offering "Taxi to the city centre" (Taksi do Centara), as they will rip you off with the bill, which could come more expensive than the flight to Sofia! Just ignore them and go straight to the taxi stands inside the Arrivals Hall. A normal trip to the city centre will cost you around 6-7 Euro - 13 Leva, or a trip to the Central Train Station will cost you around 10-11 Euros - 20-21 Leva. Also never stop one of the taxis cruising around the terminals - they all are overpriced! 

If you want to use the public transportation from/to the airport or anywhere in Sofia, be aware that in Sofia tha luggage is charged with a single ride ticket after exceeding a specific size! The size, which is carried free of charge, is 60x40x40 cm, all luggage exceeding it must be charged with additional ticket! The fine for missing, invalid or lost ticket is 20 Leva - 10 Euros! Be very careful with the ticket inspectors at the airport, as they tend to try getting a fine of 20 Euro from the tourists and thus ripping you off with 10 Euro! Tickets can be bought at kiosks or by the bus drivers, however be aware that the most kiosks close at 16:00 and many drivers have already sold their tickets by this time as well. The best way to buy the tickets are the ticket offices, you will find a full list [http://www.sofiatraffic.bg/en/transport/tarifa-i-prevozni-dokumenti/42/biura-za-izdavane-zarezhdane-i here]. At the airport tickets are best to buy from the small supermarket on the right side inside the Arrivals Hall, you will see the sign "Tickets" pointing to it. Beware, however, that not all ticket sellers speak English, so in doubt you could ask a local to help you - the majority of the youngsters speak freely English and are helpful. 

'''Money Exchange'''
Also, be wary of money exchange shops. Some of them exchange money for generally lower rates than displayed on the exchange rate panel. Go to banks, otherwise you can easily become a victim and if you want your money back the security guard might intimidate you, rough you up or physically abuse you. One such change shop is on Maria Louisa as you walk towards the Lion's bridge (Лъвов мост) just after Halite (Халите) and Ekzarh Yosif street (you'll recognise it by the misspelling of currency, spelled 'currensy'). If possible, try exchanging money also in the exchange bureaus at the large shopping centers when available - one good example is Tavex Exchange Shop at The Mall shopping center. Rates on Graf Ignatiev street (market area) are generally better (e.g. Interchange near the Lidl). Never exchange currency on the street!

'''Stray Dogs'''
Sofia has a major problem with the homeless dogs. Although the majority don't disturb passers-by, there are recently some cases of attacked people in certain neighborhoods. It is best to avoid paths near abandoned buildings or dark alleys in the parks as it is sure there will be homeless dogs to find. In the unlikely event of getting attacked or bitten, call immediately 112 and visit the nearby hospital, as these dogs could carry diseases. 

It is also wise to avoid crossing certain underpasses during the night - especially be very careful with the underpasses near the Central Train Station*, near the Opalchenska Subway station, all underpasses along Bulgaria Blvd. At best don't use them at all, and cross the street at a place, where many people are to find. 

'''Disco Clubs'''
When visiting a night club or disco be very careful with the crowd. It is wise to avoid the Pop-folk discos, the majority of which are in Student's Town, as the visitors there tend to become very aggressive when getting drunk, thus resulting in starting a fight. Visit the discos in the City Center, which are a bit more expensive, but play decent music and are safe to visit. In case of a fight, never get involved, stay away or signal to the police.

* After renovations done in 2015 the Central Train Station (do not confuse it with other train stations in the city) is no longer an unsafe place There are dozens of security cameras, a constant police station, very well lighted areas and the old scary and smelly tunnels are gone. But as in any other big city the train station is place where junkies and homeless people gather late at night. So although pretty safe during the day, and not so dangerous at night, it is best if you can avoid after 10pm.

==Contact==
Sofia has a large number of mostly free wireless hotspots in bars, restaurants, and cafés. You may find also in hotels and public areas, like "Park Zaimov". The airport has a free public wireless hotspot for use in Terminal 2. So does the entire central train station in Sofia.

==Get out==
[[File:Rila Monastery (view).jpg|thumb|Rila Monastery]]
* '''Vitosha''' is a magnificent landmark mountain rising just south of the capital. It is easily accessible by public transportation or by car and day trips in Vitosha in a sunny day are highly recommended. In the winter it is well suited for skiing [http://www.skivitosha.com/] and its proximity allows one day ski-trips; in the summer it is great for hiking. A great way to spend few days in Sofia, being on its "balcony," enjoying sunny days on the mountain with a spectacular view on the capital. So going to Sofia provide gives you a  unique chance to witness the rare symbiosis of the metropolitan city with its nature park.

* [[Rila Monastery]] is the most famous monastery in Bulgaria, situated in the huge Rila Massive. It`s just one hour and a half drive away from Sofia. It's possible to take a bus from Ovcha Kupel Bus Station. There is just one bus at 10.20am that goes directly to the monastery; a ticket is 11lv. There are two more buses that go just to the village of Rila, from where you need to take another mini bus to get to the monastery. The only direct bus back to Sofia leaves the monastery at 3pm. You can see the schedule here, though the website is just in Bulgarian [[http://www.rilaexpress.com/%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5/]].  

* [[Plovdiv]] is a large city in Bulgaria. It`s just one hour drive on a good highway away from Sofia. Plovdiv lies around three hills in the otherwise totally flat Thracian plain. It's historical center, Roman remnants & relaxed feeling make it a great day-trip.

* [[Veliko Turnovo]] a beautiful city along a winding river,  the former capital of Bulgaria in the middle ages. The original city castle and walls are reconstructed. Be sure also to visit nearby [[Arbanassi]].

* [[Koprivshtitsa]] is a small, but picturesque and historical town in a valley in Sredna Gora Mountain, that's possible to visit as a day trip. There are six well preserved 19th century houses of wealthy Bulgarian merchants that are representative of the period and way of life of an upper-middle class Bulgarian family. Besides the six houses that can be visited, there are more houses in a similar style that you can enjoy by taking a walk on the cobblestone streets. It's possible to buy a ticket for each house or a cheaper, one-day combo ticket for all of them. The town is about 2 hours away from Sofia. The main way to reach the town is by train. The best is to take the 7am fast train that takes 1.5h and costs 8.90 lv for first class and 7.10lv (as of April 2017) for second class. It's cheaper to buy a round trip ticket or, if you are three or more travelers, to buy a group ticket. The train station is 10km from the town, but there are mini buses waiting for the train travelers in the back of the station. A ticket for the mini bus is another 3 lv (as of June 2016). Be sure to ask the mini bus driver when the last bus to the train station is, as especially in the lower season they stop around 5pm. The last train to Sofia is at 7.46pm.
