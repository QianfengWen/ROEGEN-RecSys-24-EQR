'''[http://www.indy.org/ Indianapolis]''' is in the [[Nine-County Region]] of [[Indiana]], right at the center of the state. It is the state capital and largest city of [[Indiana]], [[United States]], and is in Marion County.  The population within city limits is approximately 830,000 people, making it the 12th largest city in the US. The metropolitan area has about 2 million (23rd in the US). Indianapolis is also known as the "Racing Capital of the World" due to the proximity of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, home of the Indy 500 and Allstate 400 at the Brickyard (formerly known as the "Brickyard 400").

==Understand==

The name ''Indianapolis'' is simply ''Indiana'' joined with ''polis'', the Greek word for ''city''. The founders of Indianapolis expected it to be the "Great Inland Port," but they neglected to consider the fact that the White River is impossible to navigate most of the year; other than during the spring, it is a melange of sandbars and temporary islands.  However, this port-desire left the city with a beautiful, if useless, canal district.

Indianapolis is called the "Crossroads of America". The city is warm in the summer, with average highs in the mid-80s in June, July, and August.  Indianapolis has a typical mid-western winter.  January is the coldest month, with an average high of 34 degrees.

==Get around==

Outside Downtown and Broad Ripple, you'll need a car to get around this sprawling city. While the public bus system is both clean and efficient, routes are complex, and large parts of the metro area are not serviced.

===By car===

The general speed limit on highways is 55-70 mph. If there is no posted speed, assume that it is 35 mph. A car is necessary for almost all travel within the city.

===By bus===

'''Indy Go''' [http://www.indygo.net] is the public bus system. It travels throughout the city and suburbs. Single fares are $1.75, day passes are available for $4, and all buses are equipped with two bike-racks. The bus system is a very nice way to travel with the one exception of frequency&mdash;outside of rush hour routes, you can find yourself with a 30+ minute wait. Almost all routes travel from a locality in the outskirts of the city to the centrally-located bus stops downtown and back out; there are also a handful of smaller circulators and loops.

Perhaps the most useful route for visitors is '''#17 College''' [http://www.indygo.net/PDF/maps/17-College.pdf], which runs between all of the city's most popular dining and nightlife strips. It runs between '''Broad Ripple''' Ave and '''Downtown''', where it travels along the popular '''Mass Ave''' strip, and loops around Capitol, Ohio, Delaware, and Maryland.

M-F 7AM-9PM, Sa 8AM-9PM, Su 9:30AM-7:30PM.

In 2019, Indy Go introduced their new Rapid Transit division known as Indy Go Rapid. The first project of this division was the Indy Go Red Line. This is a Rapid Transit Electric Bus route that runs down College Avenue from 66th Street in Broad Ripple all the way down to UINDY off of Shelby Street on Indy's South Side. This new Bus System began operation in late 2019 and runs every 10 minutes during the day and every 15 minutes at night. Indy Go Rapid has plans for 'Purple' and 'Blue' line buses using the same design and technology in the Red Line system.

===By bike===
Biking [https://www.pacersbikeshare.org/] is easy due to the flat terrain. Indy offers a variety of bike paths throughout the city, including the Monon Trail and the Central Canal. The Indianapolis Cultural Trail is a world-class bike and pedestrian path connecting the city's seven downtown Cultural Districts, neighborhoods, and entertainment amenities, and serving as the downtown hub for the entire central Indiana greenway system. Also new as of 2008, Mayor Greg Ballard has announced a plan to make Indianapolis a bike-friendly city for those venturing out on open, and often busy, roads. The plan includes constructing 200 miles of additional bike lanes throughout the next 15 years.

===By taxi/rideshare===

The freshest and healthiest bar food in town - hummus, parfaits, bean sprouts, sandwiches and fresh salad. Great desserts, drink specials - lots of beer!

This pub is owned by Bobby Plump, who threw the winning Hail Mary shot in the Milan 1954 game that is immortalized in the film "Hoosiers." It's been described as a "boho sports bar" which is a good, yet cheesy, name for it. The type of sports bar that hippies, artists, and jocks can come together without a problem. And only one tv. Yes, one TV. A huge outdoor deck in this small house, that has indoor dining too. A good jukebox that is pumped outdoors and the best hush puppies this side of the Mississippi. Friendly staff, friendly locals. We'll hang out here for hours during the summer on the patio. Very dog friendly. 21+

It's been owned by the same folks since then. Model planes hang from the ceiling, awesome vintage art, and pennies on the ceiling that get tossed up and pulled down for donation each year (and thousands of them, seriously). A beer is served with a small glass and unique cheap eats are on the bar menu. There are rules here - don't put your feet on the chairs or booth seats, hang your coat up on one of the hooks, and don't get too obnoxious or you're out. They'll ask you politely of course the first time. A must see for lovers of classic bars. By the time you leave you'll be a regular.

==Stay safe==
While the majority of Indianapolis is safe, there are certain areas that are prone to high levels of crime. Most of these high crime areas are located away from most tourist attractions. Much of the east side (with exception given to certain areas of Irvington, Warren Park, Beech Grove and Lawrence), Haughville (immediately west of downtown), the near north side (immediately north of downtown), and certain segments of the south side are best if avoided entirely. Use caution while in certain parts of the west, northwest, and northeast sides of town. 

While most violent crimes in these areas occur between individuals who are familiar with each other, random crimes are not unheard of. The downtown, Broad Ripple, and Fountain Square districts remain safe and are usually well policed, even after dark.  Use the same vigilance and precautions that you would in any other large mid-western city.

Indianapolis has a smaller homeless population compared to other cities in the world, however it still exists and you should be aware of it when visiting. If you are on foot in the downtown district, someone may approach you and ask for money, cigarettes, or food. It is always good to give some cash to people who are in need but be aware that scams do exist and that some people might not actually be homeless and are looking to take your money. Stay alert and use your best judgment when giving money to these people.
