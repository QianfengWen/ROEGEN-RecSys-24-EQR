'''Genoa''' (Italian, ''Genova'') is a historical port city in northern [[Italy]], the capital of the Region of [[Liguria]]. Genoa today, as a tourist attraction, is often shadowed by cities such as [[Rome]] or [[Venice]], even though it has a long history as a rich and powerful trade centre. However, with its multitude of hidden gems behind cozy alleyways, excellent cuisine (notably fish and seafood), renovated old port, beautiful sights (including one of Europe's biggest aquariums), and its position as the European Capital of Culture in 2004 have made the birthplace of explorer Christopher Columbus an enticing place which is gradually becoming more included in the touristic market. With pastel-coloured terracotta-roofed houses, artistic churches, lovely seaside villas, and also several luxurious boutiques, Genoa is a must see if you want to experience the "quintessential" Italy. 

==Understand==
[[Image:Genoa port.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The busy city port, filled to the brim with yachts, boats, cruises, ferries and cargo ships. Genoa is a very important sea town in the Mediterranean.]]
Venice, Rome, Milan, and Florence are of course the most known and admired towns in Italy. When moving to north-western Italy (Milan, Turin) it is nevertheless absolutely worth staying for a couple of days or a weekend in Genoa. The city is a good base to explore the Italian Riviera and world famous places like [[Portofino]] and the [[Cinque Terre]].

Paolo Coelho wrote: "Among the marvels of  Italy, it will take some digging to find the beauties of Genova, but it is worth visiting it.  I remember walking there with a friend, when she suddenly said: “Let’s stop for a bit. I can’t stand this orange color!”". The fact is the more you stay the more you will enjoy and appreciate the town. A place where you discover daily new surprises, even if you stay for years.

The city may be less known by major tourist operators, but its splendor is often hidden inside the narrow streets of the historical center, called "caruggi". 

Genoa is a sort of decayed glorious port town, whose decay, however, is what makes it so interesting and pretty. The facades of grand palaces are hidden in scruffy, yet enticing alleyways, and there are really curious treats for anyone in virtually every alley. The city is your "typical" Italian one - quite sunny (during summer), with Mediterranean-looking houses topped by grey slate roofs, filled to the brim with outdoor cafes and bars, with lots of tiny and quirky alleyways, elegant designer shops, and restaurants. Today, also, the old port has been renovated, and currently contains some funky avant-garde modern architecture, a delightful marina, and several seaside bars and shops.

===Climate===
Genoa has a classic mediterranean climate that is heavily influenced by the sea leading to warmer winters and cooler summers than cities on the other side of the Lingurian Mountains and the Po Valley. Genoa is also one of the rainiest cities in Italy. Winters are cool, with temperatures usually ranging from 6°C (43°F) and 12°C (54°F), and rainy. The city has 3 nights with below freezing temperatures but extensive cold periods are rare. The record low is -8°C (18°F), recorded recently in February 2012. 

Summer is the touristy season of Genoa but it isn't as hot as in other italian cities. Summers are in fact cooler even than those of cities in the Italian Alps like [[Trento]] and [[Bolzano]]. Temperatures don't frequently surpass 30°C (86°F) (the average is 8 days each year) and nights usually stay around 20°C (68°F). Hot waves don't really affect Genoa but there might be 1 or 2 days per year when the mercury rises above 32°C (90°F). The record high is 38.5°C (101°F) and it was recorded in August 2015. Summer is also the driest part of the year and it's considered the most pleasant season to visit, being neither cold nor warm or rainy.

==Get in==

===By plane===
[[Image:Panorama Genoa.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The romantic port of Genoa, with its lovely seaside buildings and wooded rolling hills.]]
The Aeroporto di Genova - Cristoforo Colombo [http://www.aeroportodigenova.com/] provides several daily flights from other major European cities such as [[Rome]], [[London]], [[Munich]], [[Paris]] and [[Moscow]] and from [[Istanbul]].  From the airport it is fairly easy to rent a car or take a shuttle (bus no. 100, also called Volabus) to the city center.

===By train===
Genoa can be easy travelled to by train from [[Milan]], [[Turin]], [[Rome]], [[Tuscany]] ([[Pisa]], [[Livorno]] and [[Florence]] (changing train in Pisa or [[Viareggio]])) and [[France]] (There is a direct train connecting with [[Nice]] and [[Marseille]]).
There are two main train stations in Genoa, Brignole and Principe. Brignole serves most local routes and provides access to many bus lines. Principe serves local as well as long distance trains and many trains from [[Milan]] and beyond will only stop at this station.

===By car===
Coming from [[Milan]] you can reach Genoa via the A7-E62 (approx. 145 km). Mind though that the last part, from Serravalle to Genoa, is incredibly twisty, making you wonder if you’re still on the highway or accidentally have taken a wrong turn into a motordrome. It’s therefore advisable to take an alternative route, turning off the A7 at the deviation near Tortona and heading on the A26/A7, following Genova, [[Ventimiglia]], [[Savona]], Voltri; making it a longer (+20 km), but certainly safer and more comfortable trip, unless you want to spice up your journey and observe how (some) Italians drive. The same highway is less twisty northbound.

Coming from [[Turin]] you can either take the A6/E717 to [[Savona]] (137 km) and then go to Genoa following the beautiful, but twisty A10 coast highway (an other 45 km) or follow the Genova [[Piacenza]] indications you'll find on the ringroad heading south. This latter is the shorter alternative (170 km total), but offers fewer sightseeing opportunities.

Coming from the French Riviera just follow the highway A10 and enjoy the sight (approx 160 km from the  French border).  If you're tempted to avoid the toll roads, be aware that it will take you at least three or four times as long although you might get better views.

Coming from [[Tuscany]] you can take the A12 from Rosignano to Genoa; mind that you must have snow chains on board between the gates of Carrodano and [[Sestri Levante]] when travelling from November 1st to March 31st, even though snow is seldom a problem here.

===By bus===
Genoa can be reached via Eurolines coach from many European countries. Long distance buses also run from Nice.

===By boat===

Genoa is an important port, and has many ferry services. Grandi Navi Veloci crosses from Barcelona weekly, and takes about eighteen hours. It also offers a weekly crossing to Tangiers, which takes around forty-six.

===By Taxi or Transfer Service===
Taxi stands can be found just outside the airport and near the Cruise Terminal in Genoa. For groups of at least 3 people, taxi fares can be fixed between the airport and the city's main railway stations. Another inexpensive way to get to Cruise Port or Airport is private transfer service like TransferAirport24 in Genoa.

Other direct ferry routes from Genoa are;
[[Barcelona]] ([[Spain]]), 
[[Valletta]] ([[Malta]]), 
[[Bastia]] ([[Corsica]]),
[[Olbia]] and [[Porto Torres]] ([[Sardinia]]),
[[Palermo]] ([[Sicily]]), [[Tangier]] ([[Morocco]]) and [[Tunis]] ([[Tunisia]]).

==Get around==
Locals will say driving around the city is somewhat faster than public transportation (traffic jams at rush hours notwithstanding), but once you have reached your destination you are faced with the nightmare and frustration of looking for a nonexistent parking spot. It is not just chance that most locals switched from cars to scooters - to the extent that even finding a spot for a scooter has become difficult too. All attractions within the center are in walking distance or well served by public transportation, therefore a car is of no use at all. If you still decide to drive into the city, don't bet on available street parking (there are street parking fees anyway) go directly to a parking garage and hope not all of them are full. If you think of driving to the beach on a sunny weekend day within Genoa or in another town along the coast, forget it. Finding a parking spot in walking distance to your beach is an once-in-a-lifetime event. Use public transit instead.

Public transportation will probably be your best bet within the city. The bus network is operated by AMT[http://www.amt.genova.it/] and services the whole city from 4 AM until 2 AM at night. Be sure to check routes and timetables you need because the system can be somewhat confusing, e.g. some routes only travel at certain times and are replaced by other similar ones with different numbers at those times. There is also an underground line connecting the Brignole train station with the northwestern neighborhood of Rivarolo, serving the main square, piazza De Ferrari, the historical center, the Porto Antico touristic area, the Stazione Principe main train station and the ferry terminal at Dinegro along the route. Tickets are sold on board at a special fare (€2,50 instead of €1,50), so you may buy the ticket onboard only if there's no alternative; you need to buy your ticket before boarding the bus at a newspaper kiosk or a tobacconist's or an underground station, and validate it at a punching machine once you have boarded the bus. For trains, purchase a ticket from a machine at any underground station, and validate it at a punching machine before boarding. Single tickets cost 1,50 € and are valid for 100 minutes after validation for an unlimited number of travels in any direction. A daily pass costs 4,50 €, while a group daily pass valid for 4 persons costs 9,00 €. Those passes must be validated at the beginning of your first ride.

There are also a number of public elevators and cable railways connecting the center with the neighborhoods on the surrounding hills. The upper stations of the ''Ascensore di Castelletto'' elevator and of the ''Funicolare del righi'' railway offer an astonishing view of the city.

Trenitalia[http://www.trenitalia.com/] suburban and regional trains travel in east-west direction along the coast connecting all the coastal neighborhoods/suburbs with the city center. This is the most convenient means of transportation if you plan to see some peripheral districts or towns along the coastline. AMT tickets (not everyone, see below: '''in particular the 1,50€ is NOT valid on Trenitalia trains''') and passes are valid on Trenitalia trains within the city limits (Voltri and Nervi); single tickets only allow one train ride, and you will need to validate them again at the yellow punching machines at the stations - check for the correct validating space with the name "Trenitalia" on the back side of the ticket. If you are traveling outside the city limits to visit some outer towns, you will have to buy a ticket at a Trenitalia counter or machine. It is advisable to buy return tickets right away because there are usually no ticket counters at minor stations and chances are good that the ticket machines there won't work, turning buying a ticket (or discussing with the conductor on the return train) into a hassle.

There are many different types of public transport tickets, with different prices:
* The "Biglietto ordinario" (regular ticket) costs € 1,50 and allows you to make unlimited journeys within the AMT network for 100 minutes from the validation, except for Volabus (the bus serving Genoa Airport) and Navebus (the fast passenger ship service between the Porto Antico area and Pegli). You must validate the ticket immediately after boarding or at the entrace of the subway/funicular/elevator station.  '''This ticket is NOT valid onboard Trenitalia trains''': if found travelling on a Trenitalia train with this ticket you will receive an €50 ticket from the conductor.
* The "Biglietto integrato" (integrated ticket) costs € 1,60 and allows you to make unlimited journeys within the AMT network for 100 minutes from the first validation and one journey onboard a Trenitalia train within the urban area (from Genova Voltri to Genova Nervi). You must validate the ticket immediately after boarding or at the entrace of the subway/funicular/elevator station when using the AMT network (on the front side), and at the station just before boarding the Trenitalia train (on the back side). This kind of ticket is also sold in 10 tickets packs for €15.
* The GenovaPass is a ticket that allows you to make unlimited journeys onboard both AMT (except for Volabus and Navebus) ad Trenitalia for 24 hours from validation. This ticket needs to be validated only on the front side. This ticket is also sold in a 4 people version for €9 (50% discount), or in 5 24h tickets packs for €18.

The historic center of Genoa is serviced by bus only around some important squares and streets (Piazza Acquaverde for Stazione di Piazza Principe, Piazza della Nunziata, Largo Zecca, Piazza Corvetto, Piazza Caricamento). Its ''caruggi'' alleys are so narrow that no vehicular traffic is physically possible, and they have to be visited on foot - distances are definitely not huge anyway.

AMT also operates a public boat service called Navebus (check the timetables here: [http://www.amt.genova.it/rete_e_orari/navebus.asp]) connecting the Porto Antico to Pegli. It is a great and cheap way to have a look at the city from the sea; once in Pegli, you can pay a visit to the Villa Pallavicini public park.

Private boat services start from the Porto Antico and travel along the coast to Camogli, San Fruttuoso, Portofino, Chiavari and the Cinqueterre.

===Landmarks===
Genoa is known to have Europe’s biggest historical center. This is the heart of the old city. It’s made up of an incredible amount of tiny streets and alleys called ''Caruggi''. Walking through it will plump you right back in ancient times when Genoa was the most important harbor of  the Mediterranean sea. The city is generally safe, but caution is to be applied, especially at night time and in the more quiet zones toward Piazza Principe and the old harbor, due to presence of small criminality.

There are plenty of things to do in Genoa. A lot of young kids spend their time playing with their friends in public pools and share ice-creams in the summer time.

==Buy==
Genoa is great for shopping. You have the designer boutiques, department stores, food shops, and antique dealers.

Downtown, for those who want luxury boutique browsing, you can find some world class fashion-related shopping along Via XX Settembre, starting from Piazza Ferrari. 

There are a lot of small, picturesque and tourism-related shops in the centre. These are mainly in the central squares and the small alleyways. You can find souvenir stalls, kiosks selling books and snacks, sailor-themed stalls, traditional flea markets, modern and antique furniture dealers, little bookstores and tiny art galleries.
 
There is a large shopping center called Fiumara located near Genova Sampierdarena train station. To reach Fiumara, take a local train to Genova Sampierdarena station and exit the station. Turn left and go under a bridge, near which there is a sign to the left for Fiumara. The shopping center is visible from the other side of the bridge and is about 10 minutes walk. The mall can also be reached by car or bus routes 1, 2, 4 and 22. 
The mall is open from 9AM-9PM Monday - Sunday. Nearby there is a theater and activity center which includes a pool hall, bowling alley and restaurants.

==Eat==

The vast majority of places charges service for a fixed amount per person (called ''coperto''), as is custom in Italy. A trattoria, cafe or bar will not charge this fee for lunch, and this is often a good place to get pasta or a sandwich in the afternoon. Restaurants are open from approximately 12:30 - 3:00PM for lunch and 7:30 - 10:00PM for dinner. 

===Budget===

* Pasta e Birra Take It Easy [http://www.facebook.com/pages/Pasta-Birra/138321639533931], Piazza Ferretto 10 rosso - Close to Magistrato Di Misericordia Church and the Genova Cathedral. Great, fresh pasta on a budget - less than 5 euro for a pasta and drink. Try the regional 'trofie with pesto sauce'. No reservation.

* Trattoria Da Maria, Vico Testadoro 14 - ph. ''+39 010'' 581080 - Close to Piazza de Ferrari, traditional regional cuisine and a practical and crowded atmosphere. Possible opening for lunch only, no reservation.

* Osteria La Lanterna, Via San Siro 12R - ph. ''+39 010'' 2461608 - Close to Via San Luca and Museo del Risorgimento, this restaurant offers mainly fish dishes.

===Splurge===

* '''Grace Restaurant''' [http://www.thi-hotels.com/hotels/bentley-hotel/restaurant-genoa.html]: the cuisine, linked to the territory, combines the flavours and aromas of Liguria with the pleasures of traditional international cuisine and is entrusted to the expert hands of Chef Salvatore Di Carlo.

* '''Ristorante Zeffirino''': allegedly one of Frank Sinatra's favourite restaurants (apparently he had them send him regular supplies of their pesto), Zeffirino is one of Genoa's gems. Hidden up a long flight of steps just off Via XX Settembre in the heart of Genoa, it can be a little hard to find but well worth it. Stunning food, truly excellent service and a beautifully appointed dining room makes for a memorable lunch or dinner.

===Specialities===

* '''Pesto sauce''' originates from the city of Genova. It is used in many dishes, including pastas and pizzas. You can always order from the huge variety of pastas and pizzas available here, but trying the one which is based on Pesto is a must to experience the traditional Genovese cuisine.

* Another must try from the Genovese or Ligurian cuisine is the '''focaccia''', which essentially is a flat oven-baked Italian bread, which may be topped with onions, herbs, or other foodstuffs. They are quite tasty and often cheaper than pizzas. There are many 'Focaccerias' scattered throughout Genova and its surroundings. These are basically take away places, and easy on the wallet, too. In many of the focaccerias, you will find improvised varieties of focaccias, but usually, the best tasting ones come with only tomatoes or onions and a bit of olive oil. The original "focaccia" is simply topped with olive oil and salt.

* Don't miss to try the '''farinata''', a thin crusty pie made with chick-peas flour, water, salt, and olive oil.

==Stay safe==

Streets in Genoa are usually quite safe, especially in the main tourist areas and residential areas. Downtown, Castelletto, Albaro, Carignano, Sturla, Quarto dei Mille, Quinto del Mare and Nervi are all safe districts during the day as well as the evening and night.

However, tourists should exercise some caution in Genoa's '''old town'''. A tourist should be careful in sketchy areas north Piazza Caricamento and around Via di Pre, Via della Madellena, Via del Campo, Via Banchi and Via Luccoli. During the day these places are tolerable if you exercise caution and know exactly where you're going but during the night they should be completely avoided. Petty crimes, and in rare instances even muggings, do occur in these areas and prostitutes can be seen waiting for their clients even at noon (Genoa is known for being pretty tolerant towards prostitution). Via Garibaldi is completely safe during the day (after nightfall it can become deserted) but the areas immediately south of it are not and if you want reach Piazza di Ferrari or the Cathedral it's best to go around through Via XXV Aprille. Just follow your common sense and stay on the main roads where most other people are. '''NEVER''' enter dark, narrow alleys unless you really know what you're doing. Pay special attention to your surroundings and avoid displaying flashy items or carrying large amounts of cash or valuables. If you want to stay in the old town pick hotels south of the Cathedral, around Piazza di Ferrari or close to the busy Via di Porta Sorprana.

Pickpockets are a big threat accross the city. Be particularly careful in the via San Lorenzo/via San Bernardo/via San Donato area (which is a popular and very crowded nightlife zone for students and young people) and also on city buses.

When walking, you should not expect motorists (especially scooters and bikers) to be particularly disciplined. At unsignalized crosswalks, you might need to insist on your right of way by just starting to cross the road (with caution!), as Italian pedestrians normally do, rather than waiting for motorists to stop. If a car, van or truck has stopped to let you cross, '''be very careful''' and always assume there might be a scooter passing that vehicle at high speed without seeing you.

Virtually all beaches in Genoa and surroundings are made of cobbles, rocks and cliffs. The sea floor is normally very steep and you won't be able to touch the ground just some meters away from the shore, hence beware if your swimming skills are not good. When bathing, be extremely cautious as stones under water are mostly covered with vegetation and very slippery. Avoid bathing at all if the sea is not calm: waves that may seem innocent from the shore might be strong enough to turn getting out of the sea into a quite dangerous and scary undertaking, running the risk of being smashed into the shore or into a rock (that you perhaps don't see because it's under water). There is normally no lifeguard service on free public beaches.

Beware of paid parking lot scams. Car drives up to a parking lot, with the typical "push button to receive ticket to enter" deal. Before the driver can push the button, the scammer pushes the button and grabs the ticket for him "to be helpful". But then, in order for the driver to get the ticket -- since he'll need it later on to pay and to exit -- he has to give the "helpful" scammer a few Euro. In essence, the scammer holds the ticket ransom until he gets a few euro as compensation for "helping the driver park".

==Cope==

In general the knowledge of the english language is good, and it is not difficult to find someone who can help you with easy/touristic problems also in Spanish or French, but the best is of course to speak a little bit of Italian also due to the the presence of a percentage of old people.

==Get out==

Genoa makes a good base to explore [[Cinque Terre]], [[Rapallo]], [[Portofino]], [[Portovenere]], [[La Spezia]], or [[Chiavari]].
