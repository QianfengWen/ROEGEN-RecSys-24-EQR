'''Curitiba''' is the capital of [[Paraná]], [[Brazil]]. If you're heading for [[Igua&ccedil;u Falls]] from [[Rio de Janeiro (city)|Rio de Janeiro]] or [[Sao Paulo (city)|S&atilde;o Paulo]], it's worth stopping by for a day or two. 

==Understand==
[[Image:Curitiba-botanical-garden.jpg|thumb|350px|The botanical garden in Curitiba, Brazil]]
Curitiba is one of the largest cities in the prosperous Southern region, and its population is largely descended from German, Ukrainian, Russian, Italian and Polish immigrants. The city is known to urban planners worldwide for its innovative public transit system.

There is a great ''cidade velha'' (old city) in the center which was restored very well for its 319 years, but unfortunately much of it is covered in graffiti and only a few of the buildings are aesthetically pleasing as a result. There is a huge arts and crafts fair every Sunday in the old city that is well worth visiting.

==Get in==

===By bus===

Curitiba's Bus & Train Station (Estaçao Rodoferroviária) is a large station with 3 terminals (train terminal, interstate bus terminal and intrastate bus terminal) provides scheduled bus service from Curitiba to all over Brazil, as well as locations in Argentina, Chile and Paraguay. 

Actually the bus is the best way to come from or go through São Paulo and Florianopolis, since the travel doesn't last too long and the bus terminals are strategically located downtown in these cities (avoiding traffic jams and long transfers to distant airports). São Paulo Station is not located exactly downtown but is nearby, and has a subway station inside the terminal. Curitiba-São Paulo: travel time 6h, R$ 60-80, departures every hour (there's no need to book in advance). Curitiba-Florianopolis: travel time 4h30, R$ 50-70, lots of departures every day (although not so widespread than to São Paulo)

===By plane===

Curitiba is one of the major cities of Brazil and is served by an international airport, named Aeroporto Afonso Pena, which is in the nearby city of Sao José dos Pinhais and about 17 km (10.6 miles) from Curitiba city center. There are daily scheduled departures to [[Sao Paulo (city)|São Paulo]], [[Rio de Janeiro (city)|Rio de Janeiro]], Porto Alegre, Brasília and other major cities. It also serves flights to other Paraná State cities, such as [[Foz do Igua&ccedil;u]], Londrina and Maringá. International destinations with scheduled flights from Curitiba are [[Buenos Aires]] (Ezeiza and Aeroparque), although other destinations may be eventually served on a non-scheduled basis.

Major airlines such as Gol, Azul and TAM provide scheduled services to other cities, including those in Paraná State, as well as international destinations. Other minor airlines, such as Brava and Passaredo, also serve Curitiba in scheduled and non-scheduled basis.

There are different options of ground transportation between Afonso Pena Airport and Curitiba city center. Regular city buses cost R$ 4,25. However, you need to take two buses to arrive at downtown. At first, take the gray bus "E32-Aeroporto/T.Boqueirão" in the airport tube station (a bus stop in the form of tube) and stop at Terminal do Boqueirão (Boqueirão bus terminal). There, take one more gray bus called "Boqueirão/Centro Cívico" and stop at "Círculo Militar" , a tube station located at the downtown. 
The Airport Shuttle departs every 20-30 minutes on business days and is quicker than the city buses and much more comfortable, but its fare is R$ 15,00. You can pay with cash, debit or credit card. If you choose debit card and buy two tickets, you get a discount. 
Taxi cabs are available 24 hours per day, but the fare varies on the final destination.  You can plan on roughly R$ 60 to go downtown. 
Other options include Uber, Cabify and 99Pop apps, which are cheaper than the taxis (about R$30-R$40 until the downtown). 
There are more than 4 rental companies in site.

===By train===

Due to the Brazilian government decision on not providing passenger train services anymore, Curitiba is no longer serviced by scheduled passenger train service. However, there is a touristic train route that goes to Paraná State's ocean coast, reaching its end in Paranaguá. It is definitely a worthwhile ride for those willing to see natural and Atlantic Forrest scenery, with many waterfalls, cliffs, peaks and historic sites. For more information see the [[Curitiba#Do|Do]] section

===By car===

Coming from São Paulo use BR-116 South. From Florianópolis use BR-101. From Porto Alegre use BR-116 North.

==Get around==

Curitiba has a very simple and practical transportation system. Public transportation consists entirely of buses. There are several different types of bus, each with a different function.

Driving can be difficult for those who are not used to the traffic in Curitiba, especially for first comers. In the central area, there are many one-way streets, parking restrictions as well as pedestrian-only and bus-only streets. Bus lanes are very common in Curitiba, as the city has over 60 km (38 miles) of them. Most avenues are wide and have spacious sidewalks and they are mostly laid out in a grid system in the city center area.

Public transportation is probably the best option for those visiting the city. The fare is R$ 4,25 (€ 1 / U$ 1.15) on Sundays, and you can connect for free between the bus routes if you connect inside the bus depots or the tube stations. There are also special services, like the City Center Circulator, which costs only R$ 1.50 (€ 0.60 / U$ 0.90), the Touristic Route, which serves more than 20 attractions and allows each rider visit 4 of them paying only one fare, although expensive (R$ 35.00) and the Airport Shuttle, operated with mini-buses between Curitiba downtown and Afonso Pena Airport.

Actually the best way to come from the airport to downtown is a city bus lane called "Aeroporto", which final stop is on the tube just next to the airport's main entrance. The fare is R$ 4,25, cheaper than the Airport Shuttle (R$ 13,00,) and much  cheaper than by taxi (R$ 60,00).

The public bus system is overcrowded in rush hours.

As of 2019, Curitiba has a reliable Uber system. As in other countries, it functions using a credit card registered with Uber and thus using cash is not common. Tipping of Uber (or taxi) drivers is not required or expected. In general, travel around Curitiba by Uber is safe and dependable and about half the price of taxis, including trips to and from the airport.

[http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_bTzq4OE7Iso/SivvnAMSGoI/AAAAAAAACYQ/n84jubu8yBs/s1600/geada11.jpg Frost in a July morning]

Many visitors from outside Brazil are not prepared to feel cold in this tropical country. This is precisely the case in Curitiba, located off from the tropic parallel, and elevated by an altitude of almost 1000 meters above the sea level. These factors mean that winters (Jun-Sep) can reach freezing temperatures especially at night, which make coats and further protections necessary. Even in the other seasons, cold nights are not something unexpected, albeit it will rarely go down to freezing levels. Summers (Dec-Mar) tend to be mild, with some hotter days of maximum through 30's C or 90's F, but occasional nights of 10's C or 50's F.

Curitiba is very well served of rain, there's no dry season, and the dwellers are not familiar with a timelapse of more than 4 or 5 days without showers. There are some metereological issues that makes long periods of a permanent light rain or drizzle, which may comprises several weeks, typically foggy and grey, barely similar to London. 

Snow is very rare and the last snowfall was in 2013. But there are many sites within 3h or 4h of traveltime where it snows every year, specially Palmas (300km) and São Joaquim (400km). Frost, nevertheless, is very common within the city limits and produces painting-like landscapes in the urban parks, notably Barigui Park and Jardim Botanico (until 8 a.m., before the sunlight starts to melt the frost)

[[Image:Curitiba Trainride with the Serra Verde Express.JPG|thumb|300px|View from the Serra Verde Express]]
*The '''Serra Verde Express'''[http://www.serraverdeexpress.com.br/], a train to the coastal town of [[Morretes]], makes an excellent day trip and is for many tourists the main reason to visit Curitiba. The views from the train are unforgettable. The ride departs daily at 08:15 in the morning, descends through some of last remaining Atlantic rainforest and offers some spectacular views (not to mention it is one of the few train rides in Brazil). On Sundays the train continues to [[Paranaguá]], although the last bit between Morretes and Paranaguá is not very scenic. There are three price levels of the tickets claiming to offer different levels of luxury: round-trip tickets are R$72 for economic class (hard to come by), R$92 for touristic (R$ 58 for kids), R$ 133 for the executive class (R$ 63 for kids) and R$290  for luxury class (R$ 205 for kids). Buy the cheapest ticket you can get since there really is not much difference between the cars. The return ticket is about 30% cheaper. In addition to the regular train, there's a special tourist train, the ''litorina'', which only runs on weekends. One-way fare for the litorina is R$126.

One fun day trip is to leave the train in Morretes, and hitch a ride upstream by taxi or farmer's cart along the Nhundiaquara river.  There is a bridge a few miles upstream (Porto de Cima) where you can rent an innertube (boiacross in Portuguese), and get a ride a few miles upstream on dirt roads.  A fun float down the river through the tropical jungle is spectacular, refreshing, and you won't find a cleaner place in Brazil.  An unforgettable day, especially if it is not a holiday time or weekend when it may be more crowded.  Look for the bottle-hotel near the tube take-out point - that would be a memorable place to stay if it is open (seasonally).

Note that the downtown (centro) area caters mainly to the business lunch crowd, and is very quiet at night with many restaurants closed. On Sundays nearly all bars and restaurants are closed downtown.

==Stay safe==
Despite Brazil's high perception of crime by locals and foreigners, common sense can avoid most risk of violence. Among Brazilians, Curitiba is considered a relatively safe city. There are some precautions that tourists can take to ensure a safe visit. Don't walk in city center after 8pm, especially near Largo da Ordem. Do not show your valuables in public. The city center is very safe during the daytime. In general taxis are safe in Curitiba, but use common sense when using them, and do not accept strange offers. In general, the buses are safe. Do not under any circumstances go to poor neighbourhoods, such as tatuquara, cic, boqueirao, sitio cercado. 

As any big city, pedestrians must watch out the surroundings when walking on the streets, even by daylight. Stay away, or move yourself fast and cautiously, from streets where there are few or no people in the sidewalks, especially in the areas near the Historical Center, anytime. Both residents and tourists should avoid rambling long distances after dusk. In spite of the fact that Curitibans are more reserved people compared to the average Brazilian, the lack of people in the streets at night reflects a general fear of thefts and assaults, as most people prefer to get around by car.

Crime involving tourists is generally non-violent and related to thefts and pick-pocketing. In general, neighborhoods are relatively safe, however caution should be exerted in the following (particularly, but not exclusively, at night):

* Surroundings of the Main Bus Terminal (Rodoferroviária); if you arrive late, take a taxi even if your hotel is close
* Downtown squares - during the day are fairly safe, nonetheless, after 8PM, are generally hideaway to drug dealers and thefts - give preference to the streets on the edge of the squares instead of passing through them.
* Historical Center
* Batel neighborhood - always exercise common sense
* Rebouças and Prado Velho, neighborhoods within a distance of 2km from the city center (southbound)

The neighborhoods on the south side of the city (Sitio Cercado, Fazendinha, Pinheirinho, Cidade Industrial, Tatuquara), are the poorest areas and so far the most dangerous places, albeit there is not anything attractive to the regular tourist. Home of roughly 1/3 of the population, these places also host the majority of the city's shantytowns. More avoidable neighborhoods: Parolin (south side), Cajuru and Uberaba (east) and Campo Comprido and São Braz (west).

At night it is best to get around by taxi. The public transport are almost entirely off after midnight.

In general, a common-sense approach to personal safety is advised. Curitiba is a big city, and with it come the usual problems (poverty, homelessness, drugs, prostitution, etc.). Be cautious with your personal belongings, and avoid walking around empty areas by night.

Care must be taken as a pedestrian as well as most drivers in Curitiba do not respect the pedestrian crosses and in some cases red lights.
