'''Albuquerque''' [http://www.itsatrip.org] is a large, high desert metropolis near the [[Central New Mexico | center]] of [[New Mexico]].  

Although it is the largest city in the state, Albuquerque is often overshadowed as a tourist destination by [[Santa Fe (New Mexico) | Santa Fe]], 60 mi (97 km) to the north. But Albuquerque has a number of great attractions in its own right, with pleasant scenery, colorful history, and a spectacular hot-air balloon ''fiesta'' in the fall.

===History===
Albuquerque was founded in 1706 as a small Spanish settlement on the banks of the Rio Grande and was named for the Duke of Alburquerque (hence Albuquerque's nickname, "The Duke City"). In the 1880s the railroad came to town, and almost overnight a new city grew up around the train tracks a couple of miles away from the original settlement. This "New Town" became the hub of commerce for the state, and the city grew exponentially (eventually the "New Town", which today is Downtown, and the original "Old Town" settlement were joined to become part of the same city). 

In the 1920s the federal government officially recognized a series of highways that ran from [[Chicago]] to [[Los Angeles]] as [[Route 66]], and Albuquerque was one of the towns "The Mother Road" passed through. Starting in the 1950s, Albuquerque grew exponentially given federal investment in the local military bases and a massive influx of visitors and new residents, and for the most part it hasn't slowed down. Today, Albuquerque is still the hub of commerce and transportation in the state. While Santa Fe is the state capital and the principal tourist destination of New Mexico, Albuquerque is the state's only truly urban area, with a city population of over 500,000 and a metropolitan population of nearly a million people. This is where you'll find the headquarters of the state's businesses, the University of New Mexico, and the Albuquerque International Sunport, the only major international airport in the state.

Albuquerque is in the high desert [35.11N -106.64W (Elev. 4989 ft/1521 m)] and has a generally warm, dry climate. Spring is sunny and windy, although temperatures at night can be chilly.  Summers are very hot (highs average 90-95°F/34°C, and temperatures near 100°F/38°C are not rare) and still mainly dry, but monsoonal conditions develop in July or August and produce furious short-lived thunderstorms. Have rainwear available in the summer, although you won't use it most days. Fall is delightful, with comfortable temperatures and a return to generally dry conditions. Winter can be blustery, with overnight lows below freezing, and on occassion some snow, but subzero temperatures are rare. One winter weather issue for the traveler; snow can be infrequent, but does occur, and local drivers don't deal with it well. If you happen to be in town for a snowstorm, expect road chaos far out of proportion to the amount of snow that falls.

===People===
Albuquerque is a casual town — expect shorts, a T-shirt, and sandals to be entirely acceptable almost everywhere.  While Albuquerque does have a large non-native population, it is predominantly white, Hispanic, and American Indian.  Albuquerque is also something of a self-deprecating town; long-time natives here may often remark on how backward, dusty, and small it is, which is something that is frequently rebuked with a passion from many newcomers.  However, the wonderful upside of this self-deprecation is that Albuquerque is generally a rather humble city, where people tend to be very friendly.

==Get in==

===By car===
Two interstate highways pass through: I-40 goes east-west and I-25 goes north-south. Where they meet is a large intersection called "The Big I". Albuquerque's Central Ave. is part of old Route 66.  A minor note of caution: I-25 south of the city is a "safety corridor" in which state law mandates higher fines for traffic violations.  Enforcement is spotty, but take the speed limits seriously anyway.

===By plane===
Albuquerque's airport, the '''Albuquerque International Sunport''' ({{IATA|ABQ}}) [http://www.cabq.gov/airport/], is the major air hub for all of New Mexico.  Alaska, Allegiant, American, Delta, JetBlue, Southwest, and United serve the Sunport with limited service to their respective major hubs, but it's Southwest Airlines that operates most traffic into ABQ, with direct service to most western cities as well as some of Southwest's hubs in the Midwest and eastern United States.  There is also commuter service to destinations within New Mexico provided by Great Lakes and New Mexico Airlines.

One tip: If you're prone to airsickness, try to get flights into this airport that arrive either before noon or after sundown, particularly during late spring and early summer.  The high elevation, hot sun, and spring winds combine to produce thermals that can make afternoon arrivals an extremely bumpy proposition.  There are no major safety issues (the airport's runways are long, owing to the adjacent Air Force base, with no nearby obstacles to run into), but try telling your stomach that!  The rough ride is less of a problem with outbound flights.  

Incidentally, this airport contains a number of attractive displays of New Mexican arts and crafts, and is a more pleasant place than most airports to kill time while waiting for a flight. It echoes the regional "pueblo" or "Santa Fe style" architecture, with large talavera tiles for flooring, huge hand-hewn wood beams, and adobe style walls. The observation deck on the second floor between the two concourses provides a panoramic view of the runway. Since the nearby Air Force base also uses the runway, this provides an opportunity to observe various military aircraft from time to time, along with the normal passenger traffic. There are relatively few shops (only one short concourse before security, and two short ones after), but two are noteworthy because they are unique: Earth Spirit, essentially a gallery of artisanal clothes, accessories, functional art and crafts, dominated by local artists; and Greetings from New Mexico, which is more oriented towards souvenirs, but of relatively high quality, and still mostly local in origin. (These shops are the first outposts of an interesting Albuquerque-based company, Avila Retail, which is introducing similar, regionally-unique shops in other airports: [http://avilaretail.com].)  The Sunport also has charging stations for electronics and free wireless internet access.  The major car rental companies are nearby, with a shuttle from the airport to the large rental center.  The airport is served by a number of shuttle services as well as local bus #50, located on the lower level at the west end of the shuttle island [http://www.cabq.gov/airport/ground-transportation].

The Double Eagle II airport located on Paseo del Volcan on Albuquerque's west side provides services for smaller, personal aircraft.

===By train===
Albuquerque is a layover stop along '''Amtrak's''' ''Southwest Chief'' [http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer/AM_Route_C/1241245650447/1237405732511] daily train route. The depot is at the Alvarado Transportation Center in downtown, at 320 First St SW (in the same building as the Greyhound depot). The westbound train to Los Angeles is scheduled to arrive at 3:55PM and departs at 4:45PM. The eastbound train to Chicago arrives at 12:12PM and departs at 12:55PM. The station has a small cafeteria.

A commuter rail line, the '''New Mexico Rail Runner Express''' [http://www.nmrailrunner.com], connects Albuquerque to Santa Fe and to the smaller communities north and south along the Rio Grande, including [[Belen]], [[Los Lunas]], and [[Bernalillo]]. There are three stations: the Alvarado Transportation Center in Downtown, one in the South Valley on Rio Bravo Blvd, and one in the North Valley/Los Ranchos area just off of Paseo del Norte. The Downtown station has bus connections to the airport. The Rail Runner runs daily, although service can be limited outside the weekday rush hour periods. Fares are based on how far you ride; a day pass will usually be in the range of $5-9. Tickets can be purchased online [http://www.nmrailrunner.com/tickets_on-line.asp] or from ticket agents on the train.

===By bus===
Albuquerque has a fine bus depot at the Alvarado Transportation Center in downtown, 320 First St SW, which is served by '''Greyhound''' ''+1 505'' 243-4435, [http://www.greyhound.com] and '''Autobuses Americanos''' [http://www.autobusesamericanos.com.mx/joomla/] which provides bus service to many points in Mexico. The depot has a small cafeteria.

Albuquerque is a heavily planned city.  In much of the city, the major roads are lined primarily with businesses with residential mazes on the insides. The city is divided into four quadrants, with street addresses taking the form "12345 Main St. (NE/NW/SE/SW)" in which the NE/NW/SE/SW suffix denotes the quadrant of the city containing the address. The railroad tracks, which run parallel to I-25, are the east/west dividing line, and Central Ave. is the north/south dividing line. Thus, the street address 3600 Menaul NE would be north of Central and east of the tracks. This nomenclature, while useful in helping you with maps and directions, has the drawback that you can't tell whether a street runs north-south or east-west simply by looking at the address.

By and large it's difficult to get truly lost in Albuquerque, thanks in large part to the looming presence of the Sandia Mountains to the east. If you can also remember that I-25 runs north-south, I-40 runs east-west, and the Rio Grande runs along the bottom of the valley in the western part of the city, you should be able to make your way around the city without too many problems. Here are some basic terms that will come in handy when asking for directions or looking at a map:

*'''Central Avenue''' is a principal east-west artery, running roughly parallel to I-40 and through '''Downtown''' just west of I-25 and past the '''University of New Mexico''' (UNM for short) just east of I-25.
*The '''Heights''' are the eastern part of town closest to the Sandia Mountains. You may also hear reference to the '''Foothills''', which are the most extreme eastern part of the city, right at the base of the mountains.
*'''Nob Hill''' is a quirky business, shopping, and residential area just east of the '''University of New Mexico''', running along Central Avenue. 
*'''Uptown''' is a business and shopping district located in the Heights at I-40 and Louisiana Blvd.
*The '''North Valley''' and '''Los Ranchos de Albuquerque''' (technically a separate community from Albuquerque) encompass the area north of I-40 between I-25 and the river.
*The '''South Valley''' is the area west of I-25 south of downtown.
*The '''Westside''' is all the suburban neighborhoods on the western side of the river. '''Rio Rancho''', a separate community from Albuquerque, is the metro area's largest suburb and can be considered a northern extension of the Westside.

===By car===
If you're driving, be prepared for frequent road construction.  The city government web site, [http://www.cabq.gov/construction/traffic-reports], gives information on major construction projects, but there are always minor ones going on.  Several radio stations try to give traffic reports during morning and afternoon rush hours, but the service tends to come and go, and it's best to inquire locally as to which stations are currently offering it.  KKOB-AM, 770 on the dial, seems to be fairly reliable for these reports. The interchange of I-40 and I-25 is commonly called "The Big I", and you will hear it referred to as such in traffic reports. Traffic congestion, while not nearly as horrible as some of the other cities in the Western U.S., can still get bad during the rush hour and on Saturdays. The two interstates and the river crossings usually have the worst congestion.

Many Albuquerqueans seem to consider I-40 and 25, which run through the city, to be their own personal expressways.  The lack of turn signal usage is a running joke for most Albuquerque drivers, so watch for cars changing lanes without warning.  However, Interstate traffic usually flows around the pace of the speed limit.

Keep in mind that driving while talking on your cell phone is illegal in Albuquerque unless you use a hands-free system.

===By bus===
'''ABQ RIDE''', ''+1 505'' 243-RIDE, [http://www.cabq.gov/transit/], is Albuquerque's public transit system although it's a driving city, and until very recently the city was not trying to make any great strides in its public transit system. So with the exception of Central Ave., public transit here is still for the most part very underdeveloped. Most of ABQ Ride's routes spur out of the Alvarado Transportation Center (in downtown at Central Ave. & First St.), which also serves as Albuquerque's Amtrak station and Greyhound depot. Bus service is reduced during the weekend.

The '''Rapid Ride''' is an express bus service operated by ABQ Ride which runs frequently, utilizing bright red articulated buses. There are three Rapid Ride routes: the '''Route 766 (Red Line)''' and '''Route 777 (Green Line)''' each run very frequently and almost entirely on Central Ave., with the 766 running from Uptown to Unser/Central, while the 777 runs from Tramway/Central to Downtown. The '''Route 790 (Blue Line)''' connects UNM to the Cottonwood Mall area on the Westside, running less frequently than the Red and Green Lines.

Standard fares for all ABQ Ride routes are $1 per ride, with several discounts possible. A day pass is $2.  A day pass is included in the price of a Rail Runner Express day pass, so visitors who ride the train to Albuquerque can also ride the bus for free using their train ticket.

===By bike===
Albuquerque is fairly bikeable, but it's a sprawling Western city and things are spread out. It's hillier than it looks; Old Town and downtown attractions are several hundred feet lower than things in the heights on the eastern side of the city; plan accordingly. Getting around by bike can be a mixed bag in Albuquerque: street cycling can be risky at times; drivers may not always be aware and most major streets lack bicycle lanes (and even those that do have lanes may require uncomfortably close proximity to fast traffic). On the other hand, Albuquerque has a very proactive cycling community and a splendid paved trail network which is undergoing an expansion phase.

The crown jewel in this network is the '''Paseo del Bosque Trail''', which runs along the east side of the Rio Grande and offers lovely riverside scenery.  Another backbone to the trail network is the '''North Diversion Channel Trail''' which runs from UNM north to Balloon Fiesta Park, and while not nearly as scenic as the Bosque trail (it runs along a concrete drainage channel and past some industry) it offers the occasional grand vista of the city. Another fun ride is the paved trail along '''Tramway Boulevard''' on the eastern edge of the city, which offers excellent views of the city and access to the foothills of the Sandia Mountains. You can find a complete bike map of all the trails, lanes, and recommended routes on the city's bicycling website [http://www.cabq.gov/bike/].

===By horse===
A principal corridor for equestrian use is the '''Paseo del Bosque Trail'''.  Trailhead parking lots are large and one, at the Los Ranchos open space in the North Valley, has a feed store, Miller's Feed.

[[Image:Albuquerque oldtown.JPG|thumb|The San Felipe de Neri church, Old Town]]

Located east of Rio Grande Boulevard in between Central Ave. and Mountain Rd. (''west of downtown'').

A nice sightseeing area, Old Town is where the city was founded in 1706 and is a place where centuries of history and modern life merge; 18th century architecture with narrow brick paths is blended with adobe architecture, and there lots of little nooks and crannies, small restaurants, and specialty shops. Old Town has a central plaza with a gazebo which is bordered on the north by the San Felipe de Neri church, the oldest building in Albuquerque. In Christmas time, thousands of ''luminarias'' (paper bags filled with sand and illuminated from within by a lit candle) line the streets. Guided tours of Old Town are available from a private operator [http://www.toursofoldtown.com/] or from the Albuquerque Museum [http://www.cabq.gov/museum/oldtowntour.html].

If less athletically inclined, ride the tram to the top. At the base of the mountains, near the tramway, is the '''Elena Gallegos Picnic Area''' [http://www.cabq.gov/openspace/elenagallegos.html], which offers magnificent views of the mountains as you enjoy your meal and provides access to some of the trails of the Sandia Mountains.

===Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta===
[[Image:Albuquerque balloon fiesta.JPG|thumb|In the thick of it during a Mass Ascension]]
[[File:Filling the sky. (8182964304).jpg|thumb|Filling the sky]]

At Balloon Fiesta Park, located north of Alameda Blvd., one mi (1.6 km) west of I-25 (''take either Alameda Blvd or Tramway Blvd exit off I-25''), [http://www.balloonfiesta.com/]. $6, children ages 12 and under free (''parking $10 per car'').

The Fiesta is the world's largest ballooning event, largest annual international event in North America, and one of the most photographed events in the world. A cultural landmark for Albuquerque (and indeed, all of New Mexico), this festival gives you a first-hand look at the world of ballooning. For nine days in October, you may walk out onto a large field where balloonists from around the world set up, inflate, launch, and possibly land their balloons. Mass ascensions of balloons with hundreds of different colors and shapes create an often stunning and magnificent sight. It's one of the most heavily attended festivals in the entire U.S.

Balloons fly best in cooler conditions, so many of the events take place early in the morning. Traffic is pretty bad around the festival; expect a long, long line of cars (you may want to seriously consider taking park-and-ride to beat the traffic). Get your hotel reservations ''far'' in advance, because everyone fills up around this time of year.

The event begins on the first Saturday of October and ends with a farewell mass ascension on the Sunday of the following weekend, with numerous events in-between, such as concerts and balloon races. Here are a few of the highlights of the fiesta:
* Albuquerque International balloon fiesta a festival where more than 700 balloons lift off in the air at Albuquerque balloon fiesta park. The whole skies are colorfully painted due to the large amount of colorful balloons. Albuquerque International balloon fiesta is the world largest balloons festival since 1972’s held every fall in the first week of October[http://www.albuquerqueballoonfiesta2014.org/albuquerque-international-balloon-fiesta-2014/].
* Every day there's a '''Dawn Patrol''' at around 6AM, where a few balloons take off before the sun rises. These balloons test the conditions before other balloons take off.
* On weekend days at about 7AM the '''Mass Ascension''' occurs, which is the lift off of all the balloons participating in the fiesta, usually in two waves. Not to be missed.
* On weekend evenings (except for the final day of the event) a '''Balloon Glow''' takes place, when the balloons don't lift off the ground, but are illuminated by the light of their propane burners going off.
* The '''Special Shapes Rodeo''' happens at 7AM on the Thursday and Friday of the event, which is a Mass Ascension for all the "special shape" balloons. There are also Balloon Glows called Glowdeos (a portmanteau of "glow" and "rodeo") for the special shape balloons. The special shapes are the balloons in forms other than the standard balloon shape, and are very popular with kids - expect to see animals, cartoon characters, clowns, and many other colorful creations. Returning favorites include a milk cow, a wagon coach, and a trio of bees.

And if you want to do more than watch the balloons, there are several local companies which provide balloon rides year-round: '''Rainbow Ryders''', ''+1 505'' 823-1111, [http://www.rainbowryders.com/] is the only one which operates directly from Balloon Fiesta Park during the Balloon Fiesta, but there's also '''Above and Beyond Affordable Balloon Rides''', ''+1 505'' 293-0000, [http://www.aboveandbeyondballoonrides.com/], '''Above It All Balloon Rides''', ''+1 505'' 861-3386, '''Aliens Aloft''', ''+1 505'' 864-8871, [http://www.aliensaloft.com/], '''Beautiful Balloons Co.''', ''+1 800'' 367-6625 [http://www.beautifulballoonsco.com/], '''Private Balloon Flights''', ''+1 505'' 550-2677, [http://www.privateballoonflights.com/], and '''Skyspan Adventures''', ''+1 505'' 250-2300, [http://www.skyspanadventures.com/].

===Other annual events===
Besides the Balloon Fiesta, there are numerous festivals and celebrations on a yearly basis. Here are some of the major ones:

* The '''Native American Gathering of Nations Pow-Wow''' [http://www.gatheringofnations.com/front.htm] is an event bringing Native Americans from across the country together. There are many events, including the powwow, native music, arts, crafts, and food, and Miss Indian World. The event takes place in late April at the UNM Arena ("The Pit").
* '''Festival Flamenco International de Albuquerque''', [http://ffinm.org/]. One of the most exciting Flamenco gatherings in the country, with artists from around the world. Held annually during the summer, usually in early June, at a number of venues.
*'''New Mexico Arts & Crafts Fair''' [http://www.nmartsandcraftsfair.org/] takes place in June at the Expo New Mexico fairgrounds and features a great variety of arts and crafts all made locally. Last fair held June 2018.
* '''New Mexico State Fair''', ''+1 505'' 265-EXPO, [http://www.exponm.com/fair/]. The state fair takes place annually for two weeks in September. Like any state fair, there's lots of competitions, farm animals, rodeos, carnival rides, art, music, food, etc. There are also some interesting exhibits as well, showing off the pride and character of New Mexico, such as the Indian Village, the Villa Hispana, and much more. The state fair is held at Expo New Mexico (''on Louisiana between Central and Lomas, east of UNM and south of Uptown''). $7 adults, $5 seniors/children, children 5 and under free.
*Around Christmas time, thousands of '''luminarias''' (a paper bag half-filled with sand with a lit candle placed inside) line the streets of Old Town. If you come to the city during this time of year you are also likely to see electric luminarias (a string of lights designed to resemble authentic luminarias) lining the roofs of many buildings in the city. You may also see luminaria displays in some of the city's residential neighborhoods, on the UNM campus, and on many a individual's front yard, but Old Town provides the most accessible and dramatic display.
*The '''Albuquerque Folk Festival''' takes place every year the first Saturday of June at the Albuquerque Balloon Museum. Free camping is available Friday evening through Sunday afternoon. This is a participatory festival that features performances from national and local musicians, dances, workshops, music jams, storytelling and activities for children of all ages. Attendees are encouraged to bring their own musical instruments to learn, jam and maybe even get up on stage at the festival. For more information, visit http://abqfolkfest.org

==Work==

Albuquerque's has evolved into a fairly "high-tech" city from the employment point of view. Albuquerque's major employers are mostly military and technology based: '''Kirtland Air Force Base''' and the '''Sandia National Laboratories''' and the '''Air Force Laboratories''' are the region's largest employers. '''Intel Corporation''' has a huge plant just outside the city in neighboring Rio Rancho. These are surrounded by spinoffs, support organizations, etc.  '''UNM''' and the medical industry are also major regional employers as well. 

Recently, the film industry has hit New Mexico (and Albuquerque in particular) in a big way, with new movie studios being built and some big-name films being produced in the area. Keep your eyes open; you may be able to find an interesting job.

Unemployment tends to run below the national average, so jobs are comparatively easy to get.  Being bilingual (English/Spanish) is a plus in the retail workplace, although by no means essential.

Upon first glance, it might seem like your only place to shop are the miles and miles of strip malls that line the major arterials. While that's not ''entirely'' the case, everything is really spread out, with the exception of the concentrated Old Town-Downtown-Nob Hill area along Central Ave. So while you can find just about anything you're looking for, you will probably have to drive a ways to get it.

Here are some good places around town to shop:

==Eat==
{{Eatpricerange|$10 or less|$10-20|$20 or more}}
Dining out in Albuquerque tends to be relatively inexpensive and very casual.  Many places offer outdoor seating.  Iced tea is the beverage of choice.

===New Mexican dining===
New Mexican cuisine is unique.  Be ready for the question "Red or green?" or in Spanish "¿Rojo o verde?" which refers to the chile based sauce included in or used to smother various menu items.  There are constant arguments as to which is hotter, the ripe and often dried red chile, or the immature green chile; however, spiciness depends much more on the strain of pepper and how the chile is prepared rather than the color, and varies greatly by restaurant, so inquire and experiment.  Many meals will include ''sopapillas'', the characteristic New Mexican fry bread, as a side.  The characteristic desserts are ''flan'', a type of custard, or ''Natillas'', closer in texture to pudding. For vegetarians, a cheese enchilada or chile relleno is usually a safe option; however, beans may contain meat or lard (in traditional refried beans) and rice may be made with chicken broth, so it is best to ask. Vegan options are rare.

Upscale, trendy hotels are located downtown and heading east on Central Avenue towards the University of New Mexico and the Nob Hill neighborhood. If you want a more generic, franchise hotel, then head east on I-40 to "uptown" (in the northeast side of the city, which is at higher elevation than "downtown" close to the river) or north on I-25. Hotels around the airport are generally vanilla-flavored, business-traveler places, but at least are somewhat less expensive than airport hotels in many cities. There are a few nice highrise hotels in the Downtown/Old Town area.

Albuquerque has experienced a massive wave of hotel building, mainly in the "limited service" class.  This apparently is driven in part by the infamous lodging shortages during the Albuquerque Balloon Fiesta in October.  The result is that during other parts of the year, affordable hotels shouldn't be too hard to find.  Even with the growth in the hotel market, lodging can be tight for the Fiesta, so if you're coming then, reserve well in advance -- months rather than days.

==Stay safe==

Albuquerque has an extremely high crime rate compared to nearly all other American cities. It is ranked highest in the nation for auto theft. If you are driving through Albuquerque and need to stop for any reason, it pays to secure your vehicle with an anti-theft device. Don't leave valuables unattended in your vehicle.

Central Avenue is home to some of Albuquerque's main attractions including the new bus based public transit system, but portions of it are dangerous even during daylight hours. The downtown core is relatively safe by daylight, although smaller cross streets such as Copper should be avoided after dark. The downtown core and the Nob Hill/UNM district (between University and Carlisle) are relatively safe even at night, but the section between the train tracks (eastern edge of downtown) to University Blvd. should be avoided at night. Central Avenue gets progressively seedier east of Carlisle, with the area officially known as the "International District" but traditionally known as the "War Zone" stretching along both sides of Central Avenue between San Mateo and Wyoming all the way south to Ridgecrest Blvd, and north to Lomas Blvd. This area is known for a great deal of drug use, prostitution, gang activity, carjacking, and gun violence. The Fairgrounds area near San Pedro at Central can get quite scary by day or night. Consider the bus or a cab through these areas by day, roll up your windows and lock your doors if you simply must drive through them, and avoid them completely after the sun goes down.

Due to its size and mild climate, the streets of Albuquerque are considered home to many people. While not typically a danger, do expect to meet up with beggars and vagrants, particularly around UNM and at nearly every major intersection in town. Be careful while driving because beggars routinely walk into traffic to solicit money.

If you're going to be engaging in outdoor recreation (even as laid-back as watching an Isotopes day game), put on the sun screen.  The elevation of the city is 5000 ft or higher, and there is usually not much cloud cover, so one can get a bad sunburn in surprisingly short order. New Mexico, because of its high altitude, has a higher-than-average lightning risk during thunderstorms.

Be forewarned about New Mexican cuisine; if you're not used to green chile, go easy at first.  Many first-timers have tried to eat the hottest chile they could find, only to discover six hours later  that it was MUCH hotter than they remembered.  Be prepared.

==Contact==
The area code for the city is '''505'''.

Every branch of the '''Albuquerque/Bernalillo County Library System''' [http://www.cabq.gov/library/] provides free wifi; they also have computers available but these require that you purchase an internet access card for $3. The Downtown Main Library is at 501 Copper NW, ''+1 505'' 768-5141. There are also a number of free Wi-Fi hot spots provided by the city, mainly around Civic Plaza in Downtown, the Sunport, and the Old Town Plaza [http://www.cabq.gov/wifi/#map]. Also, it is free to connect to the guest wifi on the UNM campus.  Generally, there aren't very many wireless cafes in the city, but there is a good concentration around the UNM/Nob Hill area. The local Flying Star Cafe and '''Satellite Coffee''' [http://www.satcoffee.com/] locations offer free wireless internet to customers.

'''North of Albuquerque:'''
* '''[[Santa Fe (New Mexico) | Santa Fe]]''', one of the world's great travel destinations, is about 60 mi (97 km) to the north.  The direct route is via I-25, but if you have time and the weather forecast is good, consider taking instead the "Turquoise Trail" (NM SR 14) on the east side of the Sandia Mountains. If you'd rather not drive, you can also take the Rail Runner commuter train straight into the heart of the city.
* If taking the Turquoise Trail, stop at '''[[Madrid (New Mexico) | Madrid]]''', an artist community located along the way.  There's a small selection of galleries, a glass blower and decent tavern for lunch. Another attraction on the route is the '''Tinker Town Museum''' [http://www.tinkertown.com/], which contains a large collection of wood carvings and Americana.  Its off Hwy 536 on the Turquoise Trail about 20 minutes from Albuquerque.  Its open 1 Apr-1 Nov.
* '''[[Bernalillo]]''' is 15 mi (24 km) north on I-25 and is connected via the Rail Runner commuter train.  The '''Coronado State Monument''' [http://www.nmmonuments.org/about.php?_instid=CORO] is a popular attraction, as well as the Santa Ana Pueblo's casino and golf course, which are right next to Bernalillo.
* There are several Native American '''[[New Mexico Pueblos|pueblos]]''' between Albuquerque and Santa Fe just off I-25. Some of them offers attractions and a chance to explore the area. If you have a few hours to kill, consider a detour to Cochiti Pueblo and the '''Kasha-Katuwe Tent Rocks National Monument''' [http://www.blm.gov/nm/st/en/prog/recreation/rio_puerco/kasha_katuwe_tent_rocks.html]. This little known monument, open for day use ($5/vehicle), contains some gorgeous natural scenery and geologic formations, such as a narrow slot canyon you can hike through. To get there, get off at the Santo Domingo Pueblo exit (Exit 259) and follow the signs up SR 22 and onto a gravel road to the monument.
* The pretty '''[[Jemez Mountains]]''' offer pleasant hiking and fishing in the summer and can be good for skiing and snowshoeing in the winter, although snowpack varies greatly from year to year and may be insufficient for winter sports.  Take I-25 north to Bernalillo, then US 550 to San Ysidro, where NM 4 (502 on some maps) takes off through the astonishing red rock of San Diego Canyon and into the Jemez.
* '''[[Los Alamos]]''' and '''[[Bandelier National Monument]]''' are also to the north, and about as distant from Albuquerque via the Jemez route as via the Santa Fe route.  
* Beyond Santa Fe lies the beauty and cultural color of '''[[North Central New Mexico |north central New Mexico]]''' -- [[Taos]], [[Sangre de Cristo Mountains]], etc.

'''South of Albuquerque:'''
* '''Isleta Pueblo''', off of I-25 just south of the city, is a small Native American village with the St. Augustine Church, a large white mission and one of the oldest in the nation. Take the Isleta Pueblo exit (NM 314) and drive south until you reach the village.
* '''[[Belen]]''' is located about 30 mi (48 km) south and makes a good day trip.
* '''[[Mountainair]]''', about a 90-min. drive southeast, is the home of the '''Salinas Pueblo Missions National Monument''', a superb collection of pueblo and Spanish mission ruins.
* If traveling south during the winter, be sure to stop at the '''Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge''', south of [[Socorro]] and covered in that community's article...and while you are down there, consider visiting the '''Very Large Array''', one of the worlds biggest radio telescope arrays.
