Chengdu is located on the edge of the fertile plains of the Red Basin in China's Sichuan Province. Due to its agricultural wealth, Chengdu is sometimes called the "Land of Milk and Honey". The Funan river bisects the city, although boat traffic, common until the 1960's, has all but vanished.

The greater city area is now divided into 5 urban districts, 4 sub-urban districts and 9 counties, altogether home to more than 14 million people. Chengdu has the reputation as a very "laid-back" city that emphasizes culture and relaxation and as a result of this and much green space is ranked one of the most livable mega-cities in China. It is credited with a good nightlife scene and contains many new western style buildings in the large city centre.

===Climate===
Chengdu has a monsoon influenced, humid continental climate with much rainfall throughout the year measuring 870.2mm on average. Humidity is high year round. Winters are cold (the average January temperature is 5.6°C or 42°F) , however milder than these of the lower Yangtze, due to the Qin Mountains preventing the cold Siberian winds from entering the Yangtze Basin. Despite that, near-freezing lows should be expected during nightfall (around 3°C or 37°F) and periods of light frost normally occur in each winter. Hard frosts, with temperatures below -4°C (25°F) are rare, as well as the possibility of snow due to lack of precipitation. The lowest temperature ever recorded is -6.5°C (20.3°F). Summers in Chengdu are very warm (not hot) and humid, but not to the extent of other nearby cities, such as [[Chongquing]], [[Nanjing]] and [[Wuhan]].  Highs commonly surpass 30°C (86°F) and the very high humidity makes the heat sweltering. Highs above 35°C (95°F) are very rare and the highest recorded temperature is 37.3°C (99°F). The majority of precipitation falls between May and September, due to the effect of the south-west monsoon. Spring and autumn are pleasant periods and the best times of the year to visit the city. Chengdu is also one of, if not the, cloudiest cities in China with 24% possible sunshine on average every year.

===Pollution===
Air pollution in the city can sometimes cause hazardous conditions. Chengdu has an average particulate pollution of 72.9mm every cubic meter. Smog can be severe, so you should always check the readings before getting out. Always carry a mask with you.

==Get in==

===By air===
'''Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport''' is located 20km (12&nbsp;mi) outside of Chengdu city centre and is one of the main air hubs in China, recently ranked 4th in passenger volume. It serves flights to/from most major cities in China, many smaller cities within Sichuan, and some international destinations including [[Amsterdam]], [[Bangkok]], [[Denpasar]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Kathmandu]], [[Paris]], [[Melbourne]], [[Sydney]], [[Moscow]], [[Osaka]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[San Francisco]], [[Seoul]], [[Singapore]], [[Taipei]], and [[Tokyo]]. 

Since September 2017 metro line #10 operates between the airport and the city center. Line #10 connects directly to line #3. In Terminal 2 the metro is located at basement 2. Tickets can be purchased at the entrance of the metro station. 

Bus #1 operates an express service between the airport and the city centre, costing ¥10, stopping at the Air China airline office on Renmin Nanlu (2. Section) next to the entrance of the Minshan Hotel (there is no bus stop! just look for a bunch of taxis/pedicabs, since they are also ''waiting'' for the bus. The last bus leaves the airport around 01:00. Bus #2 also runs from the airport, and is not an express, so can take some time. It runs all the way to the North Railway Station. Fares vary, but to Tianfu Square it's ¥10. The buses have luggage compartments. They are well signposted within the airport terminal and, because they leave from immediately outside, are easy to find. 

Taxi fare from the airport to the city centre averages ¥45.  There is no extra charge for luggage or additional passengers. When going from the city ''to'' the airport, add an additional ¥7 to cover the toll on the Airport Expressway. If you intend to take a taxi from the airport, head for the domestic arrival area and exit the terminal where you should see the official taxi stand where you can queue for marked, green-and-yellow or blue-and-yellow taxis. If you are coming from an international flight, this is right at the other end of the terminal - almost ''past'' domestic arrivals. Beware scammers and pirate taxi operators who are waiting to prey on foreign tourists with unmarked vehicles both inside and outside the terminal. Beware some who may sport official-looking, but fake, identification. Even official taxis that you might pass on the way to the taxi stand will try to negotiate a fare instead of using the meter. The fare offered will often exceed ¥100, and if you bargain with them, you may find yourself sitting in the cab for a while until agreeing to raise the price back up.

===By train===
Train connections are available to most cities, such as [[Beijing]], [[Shanghai]], [[Kunming]] in [[Yunnan]], [[Chongqing]] and [[Xi'an]].
<listing name="Chengdu Station (成都北火车站)" alt="Chengdu North Station" address="" directions="Line 1, Chengdu North Metro Station" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="" email="" fax="">It is called Chengdu Station on railway ticket, but is usually referred as "North Railway Station(Huo Che Bei Zhan)" by local people and some maps. Handles most long distance services. Trains to Dujiangyan(the city that holds [[Qingchengshan-Dujiangyan National Park]]) also depart from this station.</listing>

High speed train or Bullet trains to Chongqing (¥97-2014,No.)depart from both North Chengdu Station and East Chengdu Station. So you have to check the train time table certainly. If you go to the wrong station, you will miss the train which you want.

==Get around==
Chengdu's rush hour traffic can be hellish. Plan your itinerary around not having to be on the road during these hours.

===By metro===
[[File:Chengdu-subway.jpg|thumb|Chengdu Metro Map (2017)]]

The first line of the [http://www.cdmetro.cn/ Chengdu Metro] opened in October 2010, slicing north-south through the city along Renmin Rd and connecting the North and South railway stations together.  The fare for a single ride is ¥2-4 depending on distance. You can purchase tickets from machines (English available) with ¥1 coins or ¥5 and ¥10 notes. Ticket booths are also available if you don't have suitable notes.

When entering the metro you need to put your bags through an x-ray machine. Sep 2014: Don't have any fluids like a bottle of water in your luggage: you will have to have those checked separately. The ticket is flashed by the gates on the reader on your right side. You need the ticket to get out as well so keep it safe. When exiting the ticket is placed into a slot that collects it. Again this slot is on the right side of the gate, so pay attention since it's very easy to accidentally open the gate next to you. When exiting, you must wait behind the yellow line until the passenger in front of you has passed and the gate shows it now accepts your ticket. If you're beyond the line the gate won't let you through and you need to back away for it to accept you as a new passenger.

Line 2 of the Chengdu Metro was extended in October 2014. This line now runs from Xipu in the North West of Chengdu to Longquanyi in the South East, interchanging with Line 1 at Tianfu Square Station. From Line 2 you can switch to the BRT at Niushikou station.  

Line 3 opened on 31st July 2016. As of March 2017 its' stops include Xinnanmen bus station and Chengdu Zoo. 

Line 4 opened on the 26th December 2015. At present it goes from Wannianchang in the east to the Intangible Heritage Culture Park in the west. By 2017 line 4 will be extended further at both ends. Line 3 should also be operational by then.

Line 7 opened in 2018 (see the new metro map at http://www.inat.fr/metro/chengdu/)

===By bus===
Chengdu has an extensive system of city buses plying the streets. At each bus stop, there is a list of the bus lines coming through on this road, and on some city maps the whole network is displayed.  However, the bus lines and maps only use Chinese characters, and even if the bus announces the station, it will usually only be in Chinese. Bus numbers are readable in arabic figures. Tickets are ¥1 for non-aircon (now very rare) and ¥2 for air-conditioned buses. The fare is paid by putting the exact amount into a metal box next to the driver. There's no possibility to get change so make sure you have the exact amount of cash available. Normally, you enter via the front door, and alight by the rear door. On the new articulated buses, you can enter at either the front or rear door, with the middle door designated for alighting only.

Use apple maps for easy to use custom bus routes (no VPN needed).  Great tool for Chengdu and broader China.

There's no official route map on the Internet but there is a well functional service available [http://ditu.baidu.com/] in Chinese. Click on Chengdu on the map, then select the middle tab from (公交) from the search field. To show the route of a particular line, click 高级搜索 and type the line number to the search field that appeared on the right side. You can also select from and to destinations from the map via a context menu (the two topmost options) and the service shows the route with bus line numbers and also where to change the bus if needed. Classical bus useful for tourists are 1 and 99 (inside city), 300 (link between south airport to north railway station). You can also use the Google Maps app on your smartphone to plan your travel and it will tell you which bus and subway lines to take to your destination.
Another good service is available at [http://www.mapbar.com/search/#c=%E6%88%90%E9%83%BD%E5%B8%82] in Chinese. You can select from and to destinations from the map via a context menu (the two topmost options) or type line number in the search window.

If you will be in Chengdu a while, you may want to purchase a transit card (公交卡). They are sold at all Hong Qi markets and at some pharmacies. Not only do you no longer have to worry about carrying correct change, but you get free transfers for two hours plus some discounts. The card costs &yen;25 and can be loaded with three types of credit. The first is cash. You will receive a 10% discount off the cash fare when using your card's cash. So a regular bus ride will cost ¥1.80 instead of ¥2. You can also load credits (次) for this month and credits for next month. Each credit costs ¥0.50, and most bus rides use two credits (the increasingly rare non-aircon buses cost one credit). So most rides then cost you only &yen;1. Credits expire at the end of the month for which they were designated, so it can take a little effort to not buy too many or too few. Note that some bus lines (usually higher numbered ones) and the subway only accept your cash balance (not credits), which does not expire. Other lines (usually those going way out to the suburbs) accept only cash. When you board the bus and tap your card, the display will show the number of this month's credits remaining (if you used credits) or the cash balance (if you used your card's stored cash value).

===By taxi===
Official taxis are either green or blue and are equipped with meters. A free taxi will display an illuminated sign with Chinese characters (空车) in its dashboard. The meter is turned on by tilting the sign, make sure the driver does that and if not, you can try to do it yourself and the driver usually gets your point. Some taxi drivers may try to offer you a fixed price but don't take it unless you know it's cheaper than with the meter on. Taxi drivers don't speak English nor do they understand the map, so have an address written in Chinese with you. Drivers don't know many street names so it's best to have the address to some well known place close to your destination. Collect taxi cards from hotels and restaurants and show them to the drivers, and when close to your destination start instructing by pointing with your hand. This method usually gets you there - some drivers however will not follow your instructions or get angry for you travelling a longer distance than what they expected. If you have an iPhone, you can download the Taxi Book app (free) which provides digital taxi cards for all locations in Chengdu. This gives you the freedom to go where you want, without worrying about translation issues.

Taxi fare is ¥8 on flagfall for the older taxis ¥9 for the new ones, and increase at ¥1.9 per km after the first 2km. For rides from 10-60km the kilometre fare is increased by 50% to compensate the taxi returning empty. During night time the starting price is ¥1 more and per km price is ¥2.20. Waiting price for the taxi is one km fare per every five minutes, and the meter counts traveling with speed less than 12 km/h as waiting time. Taxis often refuse to accept ¥100 bills so try to have some change on hand.

Taxis can be difficult to find depending on the area. There are also unlicensed taxis in the city but they're quite hard to notice. If you use one, know your destination and expected price and negotiate the fare beforehand.

===By motorized pedi-cab===
There are still some motorized bicycle-propelled pedicabs called san lun che (三轮车) which can take you moderate distances. Fix a price (¥5-15) in advance. The passengers ride behind the driver.  The ride is fun, but ''san lun che'' are being phased out and are forbidden cross or ride on certain streets, and may be gone altogether soon. Until the year 2005, all of these pedicabs were modified bicycles actually pedalled by the driver. Today, virtually all are motorized, either by electric or gasoline powered engines.

===By bicycle===
Most guest houses have bicycles for hire. Check for technical problems before starting out unless you want to be held responsible for it later. If you leave your bicycle, do so in one of the designated "bicycle parks", where it will be guarded over for a small fee. If you can not find such a place, be sure to lock it securely against some structure. Be careful as the bike traffic flow can be intense.

The building houses a large mall, indoor water park, IMAX movie theater, skating rink, and a couple five-star hotels.  It is located on top of the Jincheng Plaza metro station on Line 1, making it very easy to get to.  The water park, known as Paradise Island, is about $30 per person for a pass and is not really worth the money.  The wave pool requires life jackets to be worn by all swimmers, something that will be new to Western water park goers.  Aside from its hotel (which you cannot find from inside incidentally), the building is operational. It is nothing more than an oversized shopping center with a great deal of unused space. The water park is over securitised, there is no English for the IMAX Movies and there are very few choices in terms of stores, most of which are over-priced. There is a great selection of food on the top floor, but outside that its a good opportunity to go, have a photo taken out front, do a quick photo taking inside then get back on the metro to see the same stores in town. Behind the Global Center is Jinsheng Park and Jinsheng Lake.</see>

It is home to some 60 giant pandas, but also has some red pandas and a colony of black-necked cranes. The pandas are basically on display for tourists but views are much closer than is possible at most Western zoos. A small museum and a cinema screening related documentaries is also available. A restaurant and souvenir-stalls top off the tourist installations. The best time to visit is in the morning (early, once it opens at 7:30AM is best), when pandas are most active and crowds are light. Pandas sleep during the hottest time of the day. Feeding time is around 8:00-9:30 (depending on the time of year). It is recommended to arrive as early as you can to avoid the hordes of school and tour groups that arrive every morning and more importantly because panda are fed between 8h and 10h and most are starting a 6h nap between 10h to 11h. Park opens at 7:30am but expect people to be waiting starting around 715am.  According to an employee the best time of year to visit is winter as the pandas are more active with the cooler weather.  Holding a panda is no longer an option (June 2016). </see>

The Dujiangyan was built by Li Bing and his father, who built the Fisha Weir and the Baobukou, which laid a solid foundation for agriculture in the "Land of Milk and Honey". Originally constructed around 256 BC by the State of Qin as an irrigation and flood control project, it is still in use today. The system's infrastructure develops on the Min River (Minjiang), the longest tributary of the Yangtze. The area is in the west part of the Chengdu Plain, between the Sichuan Basin and the Tibetan Plateau. Originally, the Min would rush down from the Min Mountains and slow down abruptly after reaching the Chengdu Plain, filling the watercourse with silt, thus making the nearby areas extremely prone to floods. King Zhao of Qin commissioned the project, and the construction of the Dujiangyan harnessed the river using a new method of channeling and dividing the water rather than simply damming it. The water management scheme is still in use today to irrigate over 5,300 km2 (2,000 sq mi) of land in the region. The Dujiangyan, the Zhengguo Canal in Shaanxi and the Lingqu Canal in Guangxi are collectively known as the "three great hydraulic engineering projects of the Qin."</see>

Makes for a good change of pace.  Various clothing stores, bookstores, restaurants, arcades, and cinemas.  Good place to find something to eat; including a hotpot buffet, Japanese restaurants, Western food, and much more. However, the major disadvantage with this area is that each brand has many stores in this location (similar to other parts of China). For instance, Nike, Adidas, and Li-Ning, each have about 4-5 stores in Chunxi Road alone which reduces the variety of things to buy. If you are looking for stores in the same vein as Louis Vuitton and Ermenegildo Zegna, these stores are located outside of the Chunxi Road area and near the Tianfu Square district.</do>

Some places offer &yen;25 per hour for a very nice foot massage, including washing, soaking and massaging feet, free hot/cold drink (tea, coke or juice), fresh fruit.  A great way to relax with friends. Beware of erotic massage places that may be hard to tell from authentic ones.

==Eat==
You will find no shortage of delicious and fiery Sichuan food in Chengdu. Most of the food is quite spicy, be sure to specify whenever you order: non-spicy (不要辣; ''búyàolà''), a little spicy (微辣; ''wēilà'') or 'old' (very) spicy (老辣; ''lǎolà''). If you are not accustomed to it yet, a bottle of sweetened soy, almond, peanut, or cow milk, or something else sweet will work much better than water to quell the fire.  If you are used to the hottest of authentic Indian or Thai food, the level of spiciness in Sichuan food should be no problem at all. However, Sichuan food also makes heavy use of Sichuan pepper (花椒; huājiāo), which looks like but is not a true peppercorn, and causes your mouth to become somewhat numb.  Sichuan pepper is added in most spicy dishes. If you can eat spicy food but do not like Sichuan pepper, you need to order so (不要花椒; bú yào huājiāo). However, Sichuan pepper (in addition to causing numbing) has an important citrusy taste that it adds to foods and authentic Sichuan tastes bank on the play between the flavours of both Sichuan pepper and chili peppers, and it is strongly recommend you at least try the authentic versions with the Sichuan pepper before deciding for yourself.

The spiciest food in Chengdu is hotpot (also called steampot or steamboat), although the tradition originated in Chongqing, so it is not really Chengdu food. Sichuan hotpots are basically a big pot of soup and spices simmering in a hole in the middle of your table. Patrons choose from a large selection of meats, vegetables and other add-ins.  Most popular include: lamb, mushrooms, beef, tofu, quail eggs, potatoes and various others (pork, green vegetables, fish balls, carrots, and even pig's brain!) You can choose spicy pot or non spicy pot. With spicy hot pots, unlike eastern hot pots, the soup is NOT for drinking; instead, fish out your cooked items with chopsticks (do not fish the liquid out with a spoon, it is too spicy even for locals to drink; the fished out vegetables will be spicy enough), dip them in the small bowl of oil provided to each person, and enjoy.

You may also find the local food too oily or too salty for your taste, and may want to advise your server accordingly.

There are also a lot of weird local snack type of food, such as spicy dragon prawns (look like very small crayfish; 麻辣龙虾), spicy snails (香辣田螺), Chongqing duck neck (九九鸭脖子), Bangbang chicken (棒棒鸡), spicy rabbit meat (二姐兔丁).  These ones are so delicious and you must try them.  But you need to ask a local to take you to the right place. Quite often you will find that the small restaurants and shops offer the most delicious and cheapest food. If you want to find even cheaper food options, street vendors are the way to go (though the Chengdu police have been doing their best to extinguish this long tradition and you may have trouble finding them these days). Serving everything from barbeque (烧烤) to steamed breadrolls(馒头), they are a cheap and offer a great option for a quick bite to eat. 

If you are less adventurous but still like Chinese food, or just tired of Sichuan food, there are a number of Cantonese and Hong Kong restaurants, including Lei Garden near Shangri-la Hotel. At '''Jianshe Xiang Food Street''', close to Taikoo Li, you can find a whole street of snacks, such as baked tofu, rice noodles, and many unknown Chinese snacks, feels chaotic, but gathers a lot of locals and is next to the Electronic University, which is patronized by many local students, so it should be more authentic. '''Fragrant Fragrant Lane''', in Chinese 香香巷, or Xiāng Xiāng Xiàng, is a very small alley near Taikoo-li, you can basically all restaurants, with neon lights embellished, better to come at night. Next to it is '''Wangping Street''', which is also full of restaurants, including Sichuan cuisine, spicy hot pot, Asian, Japanese and Korean cuisine, Thai restaurants, and bars. Near the Iron Statue Temple (铁像寺), '''Water Street 水街''', is a place to drink tea. There are many cafes, teahouses, and restaurants. In '''Xiangnanli''', there are also many businesses, coffee, barbecue, seafood, hot pot, snacks, etc.

In '''Wenshu Fang''', or 文殊坊, close to Wenshu Monastery, there are many snack stores, stalls, and shops selling traditional Chinese costumes Hanfu, in addition to traditional Sichuan snacks. The '''Bubble Tree Street''', in Chinese 泡桐树街, Pāo Tóng Shù Jiē, next to Kuanzhai Xiangzi, is much quieter and sells snacks and private-house foods.

There are a number of stalls and hole in the wall type places all over town. Food here is dirt cheap, expect to pay no more than ¥8 for a meal, and the quality is good. Things to be on the lookout for are spicy bowls of breakfast noodles,  (担担面; dandanmian), double cooked pork (回锅肉; húigūoròu), and dozens of dishes coated in "málà" the Sichuan chili spice famous the world over.

The vast majority of Chengdu's mid-range hotels are not affiliated with a national or international brand and generally charge &yen;300-700.

The hotels listed below are the best of the bunch with lobby staff who speak at least a basic level of English and usually offer a free Chinese breakfast.

==Contact==

===Phone===
China's country code is '''86'''.  Chengdu's area code is '''28'''.  Coin-operated pay phones are located throughout Chengdu, and calling cards can be purchased from many vendors.  Local landline phone numbers are eight digits long; cellular phone numbers in Sichuan are eleven digits long and start with 13 or 15.

===Internet===
'''Internet access''' can be found in most guesthouses and through cheap internet cafes all over town. Look out for ''Web''-character 网 and the ''Pacman''-character 吧 in the Chinese name for internet bar: 网吧.

A large Internet cafe is located on the second floor of the Xinnianmen bus station, just 100 meters from the Jiaotong Fandian hotel. The connection is fast and access is ¥2/hour.

While getting a local SIM card is highly recommended (for GSM phones, use China Unicom. For CDMA, use China Telecom. 1gb data is about $10), you can get away with free public wifi. Note that while wifi from restaurants and hotels don't need further authentication when you connect, places like banks, malls, even airports do require identity verification (实名制) and the landing page either requires a Chinese phone number or doesn't have English instruction at all. Ask a local to help you login, most college age students are able to speak decent level of English!

==Stay safe==
Thieves are prevalent around certain areas of Chengdu. Be careful around the Yanshikou markets and especially around the North train station. There are also many thieves on crowded buses who use razors to cut open pockets and bags. Also watch your bag at all times when riding bicycles around the city, thieves like to run alongside bicycles at traffic lights and reach into bags.

Traffic can be insanely hectic and motorists as well as cyclists and other pedestrians often have a complete disregard of you, the pedestrian. Beware when crossing streets; even when the WALK sign is green, (this means nothing to them or to the Police), traffic taking a right or left turn even when they are not permitted to turn will try to run you over or honk at you to make way for them. Accidents are commonplace as are deaths. Look every direction but up. Watch out for taxi drivers, bus drivers and private car drivers who have absolutely no regard for your life. Also watch out for motorists, they are all unlicensed riding silent electric motorbikes coming at you from the left, from the right, from behind and from the front. To stay safe, it is best to walk with a crowd, preferably in the middle.

==Cope==
For such a big city, there's surprisingly little Western influence in Chengdu but certainly more than regional "rival" Chongqing. It's definitely not [[Beijing]] or [[Shanghai]] but this is changing fast with the arrival of more and more foreign students, teachers, and business people. This may be trying initially, as the level of English spoken is noticeably lower than other places, but it's also a blessing; carry a phrasebook and enjoy the authentic Chinese urban experience.  The Western quarter, if there is one, seems to be around Kehua North Road.

==Get out==

=== Day trips ===

Families and those short of time might consider hiring a car with driver(300-900 yen per day, depending on the type of car and the driver's experience and the long-term road)

* The ancient town of [[Anren]], about 45 km to the south.

* The '''Giant Buddha''' in [[Leshan]] is probably the most popular nearby destination.  A day trip to this ancient man-made wonder should be about ¥100-150. Two day tours are available which combine the Buddha with a visit to the nearby Buddhist holy mountain. If going by public transport, get bus from Xinnanmen bus station ¥45. The journey takes about two hours. After you get off at the bus station in Leshan take bus no. 13 ¥1. There are is front and a back entrance. If going via the back entrance you may end up paying for two tickets - one to see the Giant Buddha and the other to see the Oriental Buddha Capital. There is the 170 meter long sleeping Buddha and the 10,000 Buddha cave which also has hundreds of statues - some of which are also giant in their own right. Both attractions cost a combined ¥170 instead of the ¥90 to just see the Giant Buddha. Hop off and pay ¥10 to motorbike cabs to take you back to the main entrance or walk for about 15 minutes. Avoid going during the weekend or a public holiday as you can spend two hours in the queue to see the Grand Buddha if you are unlucky enough to bump into Chinese tour groups.  
* [[Emei Shan]]. This 3099 meter mountain is considered to be one of the four holy Buddhist mountains in China. It is also famous for its Tibetan Macaques which even featured on the BBC Wild China documentary. The mountain is under an hour by bullet train from Chengdu East Station, and takes about 3 hours to reach by bus.
* '''Mount Qingcheng''' (青城山) and the '''Dujiangyan irrigation system''' (都江堰, built 250 BC)  [[Qingchengshan-Dujiangyan National Park]] are easy day trips about 40km from Chengdu and make for a fascinating visit.  You can do both sites in one long day, or better yet, plan to spend a day at each.  Qingcheng is a beautiful mountain with an extensive and well kept network of steps and pathways; it includes many pagodas, a small lake, and a chair-lift for those who don't want to walk.  Qingcheng is an important site in the Taoist religion.  Dujiangyan has a fascinating history and a marvelous swinging pedestrian bridge.  Both trips involve lots of walking.  The entrance fees for both sites are not cheap. The mountain is ¥95. The cable car up is ¥35 one way or ¥55 round trip. There is a boat one can take to cross a lake for ¥5. The irrigation system costs an additional ¥80 to enter. There is a high-speed train from Chengdu Railway Station to Dujiangyan and Qingchengshan that opened in May 2010. Trains travel up to 220 km/h and the trip takes about half an hour, costs ¥15. From Qingchengshan train station take bus 101 which takes you about 2km from the Mount Qingcheng area entrance, or bus 101A to Dujiangyan irrigation system. From Dujiangyan train station there are several buses (4,6,9,31) that take you directly to the Dujiangyan irrigation system area - takes about 30 minutes. Each bus costs ¥2 per person each way. Return buses to the train station run until 18:00. 

* <see name="'''Jiezi'''(gaizi in local accent)> Old Town(街子古镇)Jiezi town, 25 km northwest of the city in Chongzhou the Fengqi mountain, the mountain connected with Qingcheng.</see>

[[Image:Stone_Elephant_Lake.jpg|thumb|Stone Elephant Lake]]
* '''Stone Elephant Lake Ecological Resort'''(石象湖) [http://www.selake.com] is a fantastic park with acres upon acres of live tulips and tiger lily flowers as well as nature walks and boat rides, and stone carved animals.  The best time to go is during the Tulip Festival in early Spring and when the Tiger Lillies bloom in late summer, however, various flowers are usually in bloom from March through August and the nature walks are open year round.  Bring your camera.  Also bring a picnic lunch or eat in one of the several Chinese restaurants and noodle shops there.  The park is about an hour and 15 minutes drive of pure highway driving south of Chengdu.  Arrange a car to take you there or ask about bus service.  ¥60.

* '''Jian Chuan Museum Cluster''' (建川博物馆）[http://www.jc-museum.cn/en/]Industrialist Fan Jian Chuan built this campus of museums to explain the history of 20th Century China.  This is the first privately owned museum in Sichuan (privately operated museums in China have only been permitted since the year 2001).  The Museum campus contains four buildings about World War II in China - one explaining the Communist Party role, one the Kuomington, one about the American volunteer group "Flying Tigers", and one about Sichuan volunteers.  There is also a the modestly named "New China Porcelian Museum", which actually tells the story of the Cultural Revolution through porcelians of that era.  A museum that more directly addresses that era is under construction.  You will also see buildings explaining the practice of foot-binding and one about prisoners of war.  Nearby, you can also walk through a landlord's manor.  Make a day trip out of it; the Museum is in the nearby county of Dayi about an hour's drive from Chengdu. Admission is ¥60.  Get around the museum cluster by walking or rent a bicycle built for two; a tea-house is located on site. 

* '''Bi Feng Xia'''[http://www.bifengxia.com] Bi Feng Xia is a large ecological park in the mountains about a two and a half hour drive from Chengdu. It centers around a huge gorge with waterfalls.  One can hike down into the gorge on well marked paths and take an elevator back up.  There is also one section of the gorge where hanging coffins can be seen on the cliff side. The park also has special panda habitats, as well as a more traditional "zoo".  The main reason to go here is for the walks and hikes into the gorge.  The zoo, although filled with animals such as tigers, lions, bears, monkeys, and even a drive-through section, has woefully inadequate and sometimes smelly enclosures.  (The enormous bird aviary is one exception). You can pay to enter the zoo for ¥150 which includes a safari or pay ¥118  to walk the gorge and go to the Panda Base.  There is an expensive hotel and basic restaurants on site. Direct buses to the park (via [[Ya'an]]) leave from Xinnanmen station every 30mins.

* '''Huang Long Xi''' (黄龙溪, "Yellow Dragon Creek ancient town")[http://www.huanglongxi.com/english/] is worth a day trip. Buses start from Xinnanmen station (新南门车站) and takes just under an hour. The little town features a few original dwellings and old temples but mainly recreated buildings from various periods. It does contain a street or two of authentic buildings and nice river view. Perfect biking destination in the countryside. Tourists can also take a boat ride to a monastery down stream.

* '''The Ancient Town of Pingle''' is a cute town about 2 hours away by bus.  Five buses leave and return daily from Xinnanmen Bus Station, the earliest leaving Chengdu at 8:30am.  The town is known for its numerous tea houses lining the riverfront.  Visitors can meander the winding lanes, shop, and see bamboo forest less than a kilometer northwest from the town center. 

* '''The Ancient Town of Luodai''' (洛带) is billed as an ancient village inhabited by the Hakka minority. Most of it is a recreation but still somewhat charming. It's a pleasant day-trip from Chengdu. Buses start form Wuguiqiao bus station(新南门车站 - south Chengdu, next to Tazishan Park) and take about an hour. Alternatively, take a taxi out (about 75 yuan) and come back by bus as return taxi's can be hard to find.

* '''Jinlong (Little) Great Wall''': This (replica) Great Wall is situated not far from Luodai Ancient Town. The 853 bus from Luodai bus station or minivans (from eastern city gate) take you there  or in about 20 minutes (2-10 yuan). Upon arrival, you can climb this local Great Wall, but be warned: although the wall is only a few kilometres long, it's a steep climb which is best not undertaken in hot weather (i.e. summer). Going all the way up will probably take seasoned hikers 1-1.5 hours. There is a temple at the top of the wall.

* '''[[Sanxingdui]]''' (三星堆 ''sanxingdui'') [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanxingdui]- This is an ancient Chinese city where archaeologists discovered remarkable artifacts that radiocarbon dated circa 12th-11th centuries BCE, and Sanxingdui (Three star mound) is the name given to this previously unknown Bronze Age culture. The Sanxingdui archaeological museum is located about 40 kilometers northeast of Chengdu in Sichuan Province and 10 kilometers east of the city of Guanghan (广汉). From Zhaojue Temple Bus Station in Chengdu catch a bus to Guanghan (¥17) and from the Guanghan bus station take public buses No. 6 or No. 10 to reach the museum (¥2). The last bus from Guanghan to Chengdu departs from the Guanghan bus station (广汉市汽车客运中心) at 6:20 p.m. ¥80 (¥42 for students). 0838-5651550. Hire a taxi from Chengdu city center for ¥500-¥800 round-trip, including wait time.

=== Further afield ===
* You can trek out to the Tibetan areas of Sichuan. Buses leave everyday for Moxi and other towns. These long bus trips from [[Chengdu#By_bus|Xinnanmen-bus station]] (it's about seven hours to Moxi, and the heating systems on buses in the winter are painfully inadequate) pass through incredibly steep mountain valleys wandering through the Gongga Mountain range. This all terminates at the [[Hailuogo Glacier]], a massive park nearly nine hours from Chengdu. A good two or three day trip. 

* The [[Jiuzhaigou]] (九寨沟) [http://www.jiuzhai.com/language/english/index.html Valley] to the north of Chengdu is famous for its stunning nature and the cyan water terraces. The morning bus from Chengdu leaves at 09:00, and takes roughly 8-10 hours, providing that the weather is good. See the [[Jiuzhaigou]] page for more information about getting there from Chengdu. Please check the current status of the park, as the 2017 earthquake has caused the main tourist areas to be closed until May 2018.

* [[Mianyang]] City (绵阳市), two hours to the north, is Sichuan's second-biggest city. As a large city, it has plenty to do and could serve as a day or multi-day trip. Nearby Xianhai (仙海) resort town is a lovely countryside getaway, easily accessible from the city center. The Holy Water Temple (圣水寺) in the northern suburbs is also very attractive. Mianyang is a 2-hour train ride from North Train Station (¥20). 

* '''Siguniang Scenic Park''' (四姑娘)[http://www.sgns.gov.cn/en/].  Located to the northwest of Chengdu, these mountains are sometimes called "Oriental Alps" but are also known as the "four girls" or "four maidens". From '''Chádiànzi''' station it is a 6 hour bus ride. 95 RMB for an adult. Don’t be put off by the length of the journey. It is one of the most spectacular journeys I’ve ever been on, and this also includes about one hour’s worth of stops. Some buses and drivers stop on the mountain pass (4200 meters) for a photo opportunity. There is also a 30km section where the road is still munted from the 2008 earthquake. 

* The city of [[Xian]], 13-18 hours by slow train or 3.5 hours by high-speed train. Direct flights also available from Chengdu.
