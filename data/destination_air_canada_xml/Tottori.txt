The city of '''[https://www.city.tottori.lg.jp/www/index.html Tottori]''' (鳥取市) is the capital of [[Tottori (prefecture)|Tottori Prefecture]] and is on the Sea of Japan coast. Its sand dunes are among the best reasons to visit western [[Japan]].
There's more to do than climbing and collecting seashells &mdash; hanggliders, sandboards, and even camels await. As of April 2021, Tottori had a population of approximately 187,750 people. 

==Understand==

''It's useless. The sand can swallow up cities and countries, if it wants to.''

Kobo Abe's existential meditation on sand and work, ''The Woman in the Dunes'', was published in 1964. Although the novel does not mention Tottori by name, it was a natural choice for the film adaptation of Abe's book. "There has never been sand photography like this (no, not even in ''Lawrence of Arabia'')," said Roger Ebert, of the Oscar-nominated film. 

You will, almost certainly, have a better visit than did the story's protagonist, Niki Junpei; come to collect insects, Junpei was fascinated by the patterns and movement of the sand, and missed the last train. Locals offered him lodging for the night, but the next morning, Junpei discovered that he was a prisoner at the bottom of a sandpit, which he and an unnamed woman must shovel out every day in order to keep the house and village from being swallowed in the endless, enigmatic movement of the sand.

The city itself is the industrial center of the prefecture, with several big electronics factories for companies like Sanyo. The fishing industry is also quite lively. There are also two universities, which attract agricultural students and researchers from other parts of Japan and a small number of foreign students. Although the number of foreign residents in Tottori is low, compared to other major cities in Japan, its 250,000 locals are certainly friendly &mdash; and thoroughly unlikely to strand you at the bottom of a sand pit.

==Get in==
[[Image:Tottori.png|thumb|450px|Map of Tottori]]
===By air===
'''ANA''' runs four daily flights from [[Tokyo]]'s Haneda Airport to the ''Tottori-sakyū Conan Airport'' (renamed after the manga Detective Conan, whose author is from Tottori). The flight takes 75 minutes.

===By train===

Tottori is on the JR Sanin Main Line, which travels along the coast from [[Kyoto]] to [[Shimonoseki]]. [[Okayama]] is about 2 hours south via the JR Tsuyama Line and the JR Imbi Line. 

The ''Izumo'' night train runs directly from Tokyo. It leaves at 9:10 PM and arrives in Tottori at 7:56 AM. The cost is about ¥10,200.

===By bus===
Express buses serve Tottori from Hamamatsu-cho in [[Tokyo]] (¥10,500), [[Osaka]]'s Namba Terminal (¥3400, 2½ hours) or JR Bentencho Station (¥3600), Kyoto (¥3200), Okayama and [[Nishinomiya]] Kita (¥3000), [[Hiroshima]] (¥4400), and [[Fukuoka]] (¥9500).

==Get around==
[[Image:Loop_Kirinjishi.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Loop Kirinjishi bus]]
===By bus===

There are two buses in Tottori: the '''Loop Kirinjishi''' and the '''¥100 Bus Kururi'''. For the sand dunes and port, take the Loop Kirinjishi bus. A special ''sakyū'' bus runs from the train and central bus station &mdash; it plays the sand dunes' theme song as it goes by.

The ¥100 Bus has two routes, Red and Blue. The buses depart every 20 minutes from JR Tottori Station. (As the name suggests, trips of any distance are ¥100.) The red bus starts running 8:05AM (9AM on weekends and holidays) and makes its last departure at 6PM. The blue bus starts at 8:05AM (9:10AM on weekends and holidays) with a last departure at 6:10PM.

===On foot===

The city center, between the train station and Mt. Kyusho, is easily navigable on foot. From downtown, a wide and pleasant greenbelt leads to the beach. Starting from JR Tottori Station, walk west about 5 blocks to find the river, Sendai-gawa. Head right when you find the path. The walk takes about 45 minutes. To get to the sand dunes, it is best to take the bus. Walking is possible, but it will take a few hours to get there.

===By sightseeing taxi===

The tourist information center offers a sightseeing taxi that can take you to any of the major sights for a fixed charge of ¥2000 per person for up to 3 hours. Especially if you are traveling alone, this is a great deal. The taxi will wait for you at the sights.

{{infobox|The White Rabbit of Inaba|Just offshore at Hakuto Beach is a small island that is part of a local folktale. The story goes that a rabbit was trapped on the island, longing to return to his family on the mainland. He tricked a family of sharks into lining up so he could hop on their backs to the shore, but as he reached the last shark, he sneered that he had deceived them; enraged, the sharks tore off all the rabbit's fur. To make matters worse, some cruel gods told the rabbit he would be cured if he bathed in the sea, which he did, only to find that the salt stung his wounds quite badly. The youngest brother of the gods, Okuninushi no Mikoto, felt sorry for the crying rabbit, and told him to bathe in fresh water and dry off with cattails. The rabbit was cured and predicted that the god would become the ruler of the Inaba region, which came true. Reminders of this story abound in the Tottori area, and you will see the white rabbit on everything from bridges to sewer grates to flower arrangements, sometimes accompanied by a rather fat god carrying a big sack.}}

Special activities typically begin at 9AM" price="Free"> 16km from east to west, the Tottori Sand Dunes are a favorite target for climbing, exploring, and more. The main portion of the dunes are much smaller than 16km (about 2km, east to west), but they can still be impressive.  If you arrive ''very'' early in the morning, you can see the unique patterns carved by the wind before they get trampled by the scores of people who come to climb the biggest dune. If you'd prefer not to get sand in your shoes, a cable car ride (¥200 one way) leads to the Dune Observatory Center. After heavy rains, the oasis below the ''uma no se'' (the largest dune) forms into a beautiful lake.  The 200¥ loop bus is the cheapest way of getting to the dunes from Tottori station; the local bus will cost ¥360, or ¥310 if you stop at "kodomo no kuni" stop, where you can walk right away on the dunes from the west side. </see>
