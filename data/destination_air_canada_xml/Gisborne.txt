'''Gisborne''' is a sunny seaside town on the [[East Coast (New Zealand)|East Coast]] of the [[North Island]] of [[New Zealand]]. It is a popular summertime destination as it has a relatively warm, dry and sunny climate, swimming and surf beaches with a more relaxed pace of life than the larger cities. It is the first city in the world to see the sun each day. 

==Get in==
Gisborne is a good day's drive from either [[Auckland]] or [[Wellington]] or half a day from [[Rotorua]] or [[Napier]].

There are frequent flights from Auckland (1 hour) and Wellington (1 hour) on Air New Zealand.

[http://www.intercity.co.nz/ InterCity] runs buses.

==Get around==
If you are going to the beach, walking is a good idea, as parking in the central city is often a problem. The central business district is quite small and easy to get around.

==Drink==
<P>Gisborne's drinking scene is fairly quiet and often starts late, around 11PM or midnight.  Expect to pay cover charges most bars/clubs in the CBD after 10PM on weekends; usually $5-$10. Busy nights are Wednesdays (payday for many people in town), Friday, and Saturday.  The exception is during Rhythm and Vines, when the bars and beachside are going for pretty much the whole week.</P>
<P>The entire downtown and much of the town's beach are liquor-free zones; drinking outside in these areas can result in a fine.</P>
