'''Larnaca''' ([[Turkish phrasebook|Turkish]] Larnaka) ([[Greek phrasebook|Greek]] Λάρνακα ''Larnaka'', [http://www.larnaka.com/tourism.html]) is a city in [[Cyprus]].

==Understand==

Larnaca has a reasonable claim to being the '''oldest city in Cyprus''', with evidence of habitation up to 6000 years ago.

Modern Larnaca, like other Cypriot coastal towns, is divided into an older city center and a wide sprawl of hotels and restaurants along the beach.

==Get in==
===By plane===

'''Larnaca International Airport''' ({{IATA|LCA}}) is the largest airport in Cyprus, located 6 km southwest of the city center. The airport had an upgrade 2006 and the new terminal opened in 2009 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larnaca_International_Airport] In the past were no left luggage/baggage storage facilities at the airport. Please double-check if necessary.

The public bus stop to central Larnaca is poorly indicated. The bus stop is at the departure hall level (upstairs) on the left side of the first lane. It shows a sign with a series of three-digit bus numbers. Every ticket costs 1,5 Euro.

Public City Bus 425 goes to the central city (Finikoudes Bus Stop) and takes approx 15-20 minutes. The bus runs every 30 minutes (approx between 6am and midnight).  The bus stops on demand/request. There is no indication of the current/next stop. Street names are written in Greek and English. The best reference point is Finikoudes beach.
Besides 425 other city, bus lines service the airport, but the majority have only one stop at Larnaca, and go further.

On ground floor (arrival) are the private buses of the travel agencies (and resorts). 

Taxis to the city take 15 minutes. 

In the past, shared taxis (''grammi'') connect Larnaca to [[Nicosia]] and [[Limassol]]. Now exists an Airport Express Shuttle to [[Nicosia]] and [[Limassol]]. Another option is the Intercity bus. For more details about the bus see ''Get around'' and the official home page [http://www.cyprusbybus.com/].

There are rules and dedicated crossings between the south and north [[Cyprus]]. Please double-check if you go to [[Nicosia]] or [[Famagusta]].

===By boat===

See [[Cyprus]]

==Get around==

Larnaca is a thin ribbon of a town and you can walk around most of it.  The seaside '''Larnaca Promenade''' (''Phinikoudes'') is particularly pleasant for a stroll in the evening.

Cyprus still drives on the left-hand side of the road (like most British colonies).

===By bus===

The home-page http://www.cyprusbybus.com/ provides routes, stops, and timetables.

In short: City Bus Single Ticket 1.50 EUR, Intercity Ticket approx 7 EUR (depending on route).

Important bus stops are : 
* '''Airport''': (see Get in)
* '''Old Hospital''': Bus 425 stops at ''Grigori Afxentiou Street'' and not in the "station" as indicated in some maps (''Agias Elenis Street''). Best reference point: short before is a large red cross. Opposite/At the bus stop is a bakery chain (Zobras), a church, and a cafe (Mario Coffee House). The supermarket is invisible from the Grigori Afxentiou street. If you see Costa Coffee then you have missed the Old Hospital bus stop. 
* '''Finikoudes''': The stop is at the promenade and you cannot overlook it. 
* '''Police Station''' the bus stop ''Archbishop Makariou C Avenue'' is near the Police Station (Europa Square, Finikoudes beach) and the best stop of Line 711 for the central city.

===By taxi===

By law, taxis should charge by the meter, but many cabbies will refuse to use it.  Metered fares should be 65 cent to get in; plus 22 cent/km. Night surcharges apply after midnight.

=== Diving ===
[[Image:Zenobia_FloatingAlong.JPG|thumb|Diving the wreck of the Zenobia]]

For divers, the main reason to come to Larnaca is the '''wreck of the Zenobia''' (watch video[http://www.cydive.com/video.php]),  a ro-ro ferry that sunk in 1980 on her maiden voyage only a few hundred meters from the harbor due to a fault in the ballast computer.  Fully laden with trucks and their cargo, the ship now lies on its side at a depth of 42 meters, with the top of the wreck at 18m and thus easily accessible even to PADI Advanced Open Water divers. If your flight comes in right, you can even see the shadow of the wreck as you land at Larnaca airport!

==Buy==
The nearby village of Lefkara is famous for its lace and silverware, and Larnaca being the nearest large town to the village, sells both in plentiful supply.

Independent jewelers and watchmakers are abundant, particularly among and just off the main Ermes/Ermou Street.

* '''Oro Fino Jewellery''', Pavlou Valsamaki 26, ''50 meters from Foinikoudes beach, near St. Lazarus'', tel. 24-654666.  Unique handmade creations by local designers and jewelry makers. Feel free to ask about custom pieces.

==Eat==
Often, eating in Larnaca can be quite expensive. However, if you're traveling on a budget, there are a few bargains to be had. Possibly the cheapest way is by grabbing a hotdog at the 'Enjoy. Finikoudes' kiosk on, you guessed it, Phinikoudes Avenue. Hotdogs are just €1 and are rather enjoyable. If you prefer to sit down for a meal, try Ocean Basket (also on Phinikoudes Avenue) where a huge, tasty serving of Fish and Chips will set you back just €7 (2022), which is comparable to (if not less than) the price of a meal at the likes of Phinikoudes' McDonalds or KFC, which are also useful places for eating on a budget, even if they do lack that local touch.

The beaches of Larnaca are littered with identikit seafood restaurants catering to tourists.  The easiest way to find a good place is to simply walk along until you find a restaurant packed not with tourists, but with Cypriots!

*'''Prasino Amaxoudi''', or '''Green Cart in English''', 20 Turan Road, tel. 24 622 939. It is placed on the corner of Turan Road and Buyuk Cami Road next to the big mosque at the end of the Promenade. They serve probably the best Sheftalia (traditional Cypriot meatballs) in Larnaca together with other regional specialties. Prices are most friendly (€6 for a generous portion of Sheftalia), just as the service. The atmosphere is authentic the place is usually filled with locals in spite of the touristic location. - P.S. by May 2018 this place has changed into ''Dimitris Souvlakeri'', one of the many kiosks offering grilled meat. Inexpensive but soulless. Try the next one, rather. 

*'''Taverna Edesma''' (Lordou Vyrona, close to Pierides Museum). A family-run, friendly place offering all the typical Cyprus dishes. Inexpensive fresh food, and a nice, colorfully decorated backyard garden to eat outside without jutting on the street.

* '''Aldente Cucina Italiana''', Located right on the beachfront of Larnaca, Phinikoudes Beach, a great place to enjoy authentic Italian cuisine and glance at the sea, +357 24 664540

* '''Militzis''', 42 Piale Pascha, tel. 24-655867. A long-running favorite serving honest Cypriot fare (read: meat and potatoes) washed down with their own wine.  No points for presentation, but the food is good and the restaurant is often packed.  Figure on &pound;5-10 for a meal.

* '''Hobo's''', Phinikoudes Promenade. A lively Cafe/Restaurant popular with many Cypriots, right on the main promenade. You can't miss it, and it is often full but doesn't take telephone reservations. Food is varied from Cypriot to International Cuisine.

*'''Kantara''', '''Rendez-Vous''', and ''' Ganga''' restaurants on Dhekelia Road are probably the best restaurants in Larnaca.  More expensive than the rest, but well worth it.  Both Kantara and Rendez-Vous have a good selection of international wines (Cyprus wines are an acquired taste ... to say the least!)

* <eat name="Nippon" alt="" address="Grigoris Afxentiou Ave" directions="opposite American Academy" phone="+357 24657555" url="" hours="" price="From €50" lat="" long="">Expensive, but reknown Japanese restaurant serving sushi.

Very good quality European-style dishes, with some more adventurous selections, eg prawns with ouzo sauce.</eat>

* '''Vlachos'''''' Taverna'''  on the Dhekelia Rd, 400 metres past the Palm Beach Hotel on the same side is a fantastic place to eat local food. Sheftalia is just great and the salads are lovely.

* '''Apollo Snack Bar''', the Alley Way, Kition Building, relatively close to the beach strip is a very nice snack bar tucked away in a back alley. Affordable, enormous and tasty portions, the owner is very friendly as well! 4-8 EUR for a decent lunch snack.

==Drink==
In the, city center an area just off the main promenade called "Laiki Yeitonia" fulfills the need for most Bars and Small scale Nightclubs. '''Club Deep''' is the most popular of these, along with '''Times'''. 

Driving about 15-20 minutes away from the City Centre to the East in the direction of Ayia Napa is the Larnaca-Dhekelia Road. This is the main 'strip' for high-quality hotels, nightclubs, bars, etc, and is where most British Tourists can be found.

* '''Blue Pine Bar''' near the American Academy has a huge selection of spirits (all real which is unusual for Cyprus) and has a real atmosphere.  The decor is wood and dim lighting and lots of Jack Daniels and Blues music paraphernalia. Comes alive after 10PM.  The Bar used to be located on Dhekelia Road but moved several years ago. By far the best bar in Larnaca for chilled music and spirits.
