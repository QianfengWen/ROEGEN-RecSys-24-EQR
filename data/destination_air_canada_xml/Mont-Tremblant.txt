'''Mont-Tremblant''' [http://www.tremblant.ca/] is a small village in [[Quebec]], [[Canada]], known for the famous Mont-Tremblant Ski Resort. Located in the [[Laurentides|Laurentian mountain range]], Mont-Tremblant ("Trembling mountain" in French) is surrounded by lush boreal forest and breathtaking views, standing at 875 meters (2871 feet). 

Despite being a ski resort, in recent years, Mont-Tremblant has become a popular getaway for tourist and locals alike, whether in winter or in summer.

==Understand==
Mont-Tremblant is divided into two parts.  The original village of Mont-Tremblant now goes by the name of '''The Village''', but these days it's '''The Resort''' (aka the '''Pedestrian Village'''), some 6 km away directly at the foot of the mountain, where the action is.  Built by Intrawest (the company behind [[Whistler]]) starting in 1992, the Resort is a somewhat Disneyland-y concoction of pretty pastel houses, but it looks improbably idyllic in winter with a light (or, not uncommonly, heavy) dusting of snow, maple logs on the fire and lights twinkling in the windows.  Vehicles are strictly prohibited &mdash; hence the name &mdash; and many hotels can be reached directly on ski.  A free gondola connects the lower hotels and parking lots to the ski lifts.

Surrounding the inhabited areas is Mont-Tremblant National Park (''Parc national du Mont-Tremblant''), the biggest park in the SEPAQ network and the first national park to have been created in Québec.

There are also other areas besides The Village of Mont Tremblant that visitors and locals can live in. Domaine de la Forêt offers direct access to the ski trails and is nestled along the mountainside. Domaine Nansen area is a private, peaceful area that consists of a small cluster of homes hidden in forested south side. Le Domaine du Géant area features luxurious condos in a peaceful setting not too far from the village. Domaine du Diable area include luxurious homes featured next to the golf course. Versant Soleil is the newest addition to homeowners settling in Quebec's Laurentian Mountains.

==Get in==

===By plane===
'''Mont Tremblant International Airport''' ({{IATA|YTM}}) [http://www.mtia.ca/}}]
has seasonal direct flights operated by Porter Airlines to Mont Tremblant airport from [[Newark (New Jersey)|Newark]], from [[Montreal]], and from [[Toronto]].

The nearest major airport is in [[Montreal]].

===By car===
Mont-Tremblant is most easily reached via Autoroute 15 North from [[Montreal]] to [[Sainte-Agathe]], where it merges with 117 for the last 30 km (still four-laned highway).  Take exit 119 (Montée Ryan) to Chemin Duplessis and follow indications for Tremblant Resort.  The trip takes about 90 minutes.

From the west (Ottawa and Toronto), it's ''possible'' to use smaller roads to shave a few kilometers off the journey, but the roads are ''very'' small at times and may be snowed in during the winter.  Detouring via Montreal is thus, in all likelihood, the faster option.

If you are driving in the winter remember snow tires are now required by law in Quebec! (Only mandatory for vehicles registered in Quebec.)

Car Rental really is essential if your looking to maintain your independence in and out of the resort, but prices vary dramatically between operators so do your homework on price comparisons.

===By bus===
Two intercity bus lines provide service into Mont-Tremblant. The primary service is operated by Groupe Galland [http://www.galland-bus.com/] between Montreal, Mont-Tremblant, and Mont-Laurier. There are generally six trips daily between Montreal and the St-Jovite section of Mont-Tremblant; some trips provide direct or connecting service to the Mont-Tremblant resort. Two of the trips continue beyond Mont-Tremblant to Mont-Laurier. Autobus Maheux [http://www.autobusmaheux.qc.ca/] also provides service to the St-Jovite section of Mont-Tremblant, but the service is restricted to carrying passengers only to points north of Mont-Laurier (local transportation to points between Montreal and Mont-Laurier is provided exclusively by Groupe Galland). During the winter ski season, Skyport [http://www.skyportinternational.com/] provides direct service between the Montréal-Trudeau airport and the Mont-Tremblant resort.

Most bus travelers from Ontario and points west travel first to Montreal, then to Mont-Tremblant. However, it may be possible to save some travel time by going through Ottawa instead of Montreal. Voyageur [http://www.greyhound.ca] operates one bus daily (two buses on Fridays and Sundays) between Ottawa and Grand-Remous, with a connection in Grand-Remous to Autobus Maheux [http://www.autobusmaheux.qc.ca/] for service to and from Mont-Tremblant. Check schedules carefully before travel.

Regional transit bus service is provided by Transport collectif intermunicipal Laurentides [http://www.tcil.qc.ca/]. There are eight weekday and three weekend trips that provide service to all points between the St-Jovite section of Mont-Tremblant and Saint-Jérôme. There are also two weekday services to all points between Mont-Tremblant and L'Assomption. At Saint-Jérôme, connections may be made with the rush hour only commuter trains between Saint-Jérôme and Montreal, operated by Agence métropolitaine de transport [http://www.amt.qc.ca]; and also bus #9 between Saint-Jérôme and the Montmorency Métro [http://www.stm.info] station in Laval, operated by C.I.T. Laurentides [http://www.citl.amt.qc.ca/]. Using the regional transit services, it is possible to travel from downtown Montreal to Mont-Tremblant for just $12.25, considerably less that the fare on one of the intercity carriers which are not that much faster, though are more comfortable.

Within Mont-Tremblant, transit service is available between the St-Jovite section and the Mont-Tremblant resort operated by a contractor to the local Chamber of Commerce. [http://www.villedemont-tremblant.qc.ca/en/citoyens.php?section=148]

==See==
Aside from mildly iconic clocktower in the lower village, there are no historic sights in Mont Tremblant. But what it lacks in history it makes up for in the surrounding natural beauty.  Mountains, lakes and forests provide an idylic setting - especially in the more rustic northern side.



*'''Mont Tremblant''' is a part of the Laurentian mountain range. Its elevation is 875 meters/ 2,871 feet and has a south side vertical drop of 645 meters/ 2,116 feet. The ski resort's includes 755 acres of skiable terrain with 465 acres of artificial snow coverage. It has a massive snow system powering 1,164 snow guns that produces snow from November to April. Mont Tremblant contains plenty trails with its total trail length being 81.9 km/ 50.8 miles. The mountain is designated to handle 27,830 skiers per hour because of its 14 express ski lifts. The trails cover 22% beginner, 30% intermediate and 48% expert level. This beautiful mountain transports thousands of skiers hourly by their two gondolas, one cabriolet, six high-speed 4-passenger lifts, one 4-passenger chairlift and one 3-passenger chairlifts.

==Do==
Mont Tremblant is an internationally-renowned and multi award winning '''ski destination'''.  It doesn't come cheap though: your basic day pass costs $70/day, plus possible high season surcharges.  However, this is competitive to European resorts thanks to favorable exchange rates. 

If you visit in the summer, the resort on the south side of the mountain is a great starting point for activities. As well as mountain activities there is cycle hire and an indoor pool, ‘Aqua Club de Source'. Try mini-golf or walk down to the shore of Lac Tremblant for water sports. At the top of the resort there is an ‘Activity Centre’ where you can book a huge variety of activities. [http://www.tremblantactivities.com]

Nearby, '''Parc de Mont Tremblant''' is one of the major parks listed in the Parcs Quebec network and features camping, canoe-camping, well-maintained hiking trails, canoe rental.  See the SEPAQ website (in French and English) [http://www.sepaq.com/En/index.cfm] for more information and rates.

If you are looking for a more convenient Ski experience try the north side of the resort - not only does it have the best runs, but also an abundance of free parking that makes your walk to the ski lifts both shorter and easier.  The North side also benefits from catering and equipment rental - great if you simply want to focus on what you came for and maximise your time on the slopes.  

It's nice to soak your bones in a hot tub after hitting the slopes all day, either in a locally rented home (if you're lucky enough) or in one of the half dozen or so '''spas''' in Mont-Tremblant.

If a guest gets sick of the cold weather, they can engage in the only '''golf simulator''' in the region.

===Summer Activities===

Mont Tremblant offers just as many activities during the warmer months, being known as the Most Animated 4 Seasons Resort in Canada. '''Gondola rides''' offer a spectacular view of the Laurentians. Kids of all ages can enjoy themselves at '''Pirates Water Park''' experiencing organized games. Families can play mini-golf at the '''Mini-golf Le Petit Géant''' or try '''Alpine Luge''', which is a gravity ride on a 3-wheel cart. This resort has tons of outdoor activities such as '''bicycling, mountain biking, rafting''' down the Rouge River and '''horseback riding''' through the Laurentian Mountains. With 10 different '''paintball''' playgrounds and '''Eurobungy-Trampolines''', there is always something exhilarating going on at Mont Tremblant. Mont Tremblant offers an aerial forest adventure, '''Acrobranche''', that includes zip lines, Tarzan ropes, monkey bridges and many other challenges.

Adventurous people can participate in '''Dune Buggy Tours''' or '''ATV rides''' through the backcountry trails.''' Helicopter, airplane and Caleche rides''' are available for people to explore and admire this beautiful area. For a different perspective of Mont Tremblant, experience''' The Diable Via Ferratta''', a walking and climbing course built onto the face of one of the Parks most magnificent cliff faces. 

===Golf===

For the most famous and well-known reason to visit Mont Tremblant during the summer, this resort gives you an incomparable '''golfing''' experience. These two courses make you choose between what they called, The Devil or The Giant. 

'''Le Diable'''
This 7,056-yard course designed by Master Architects Michael Hurdzan and Dana Fry will make you drive for your passion. With a par of 71 and an 18-hole championship course, there is no question why it was rated the Best Golf Destination outside of Ontario in 2008 by Toronto Sun. 

'''Le Géant'''
This 6,838-yard course designed by Thomas McBroom in 1995 makes it hard to concentrate by the aesthetic view of the Laurentians. After one experiences this course, he or she will realize why it was rated Best Golf Resort in Canada by ScoreGolf magazine in 2005.

The pedestrian village has a good selection of stores, with a predictable emphasis on high-end winter clothing, winter sports goods and maple syrup-themed souvenirs.  There is also one smallish supermarket and several convenience stores for daily necessities.  Prices for such convenience can be on the high side though, and you may be able to save quite a bit by visiting the original village or stocking up at nearby St Jovite instead.

Mont Tremblant offers plenty of shops for guests to enjoy.  From sporting goods stores to get the latest gear to art galleries, there is always something fun to do.
