[[Image:AalborgLoc.png|right]]

It is also possible to walk by foot all the way from the Airport to the city, 6km, approximately 1 hour)

Aalborg Busterminal on John F Kennedy Plads (The John F Kennedy square, phone: 98 12 87 13) right by the station is a large regional hub for long distance, regional and local buses.

In addition regional buses connects to nearly every city of some size in North-Eastern Jutland. 

* '''Abilskou''' route 888 [http://www.abildskou.dk/go.asp?LangRef=4] to [[Copenhagen]] takes 5 hours, 250 Kr (430 Kr return ticket).

From Frederikshavn: Use the E45 southbound to Aalborg.
From Hirtshals: Use the E39 southbound to Aalborg.

==Get around==

In the centre it's easy to walk by foot. To go further, there is a good public bus system and you can purchase a ticket from the bus driver; the standard tickets costs ~20 Kr and allows you to travel within two zones (for example from city centre (zone 1) to any other surrounding zone) within one hour. Taxis are very expensive.

The best way is still to get around by bicycle and you can rent one close to tourist information office. There is also a city bike scheme (doesn't work during the winter time, though) where you may borrow a bicycle from any of the 20 city bike stands shown on this  [http://www.aalborgbycyklen.dk/default.aspx?m=2&i=37 map]; you'll need to make a 20 Kr deposit to unlock the bicycle and you get the coin back when you return it to any of the bike stands. For longer stays, a better option is buying one. Police has auctions once per month, you can ask about them in the police station (the auction is held in Danish, so it's better to come with someone who speaks the language). 

Nørresundby is north of the limfjords bridge. There is also a footbridge along the railway bridge.

==Cope==



==Get out==

There are lots of beautiful nature around, easily accessible only by car. 

* Rubjerg Knude - impressing sand dunes and a half-sunken lighthouse in the sand. Hard to reach during the weekend, since there are no buses during that time.

* Bulbjerg

* Fur island

* Mors

* [[Skagen]]

For beach, you can take a bus to [[Blokhus]] or [[Løkken]] (North Sea, around 40km) or Hals (Baltic sea, around 30km) and walk some 3km north, or take a less frequent bus that passes Hou, to, e.g., Bisnap strand (Baltic sea). The North sea is more windy most of the time, and there are nice sand dunes there. There are German bunkers from World War II near to [[Løkken]], and they can be also interesting to see.

* Fårup Sommerland. This amusement park can be reached by bus from Aalborg Rutebilstation. The amusement park has many rides and a water park.
