''A city born in storm, nurtured in rivalry and established as battling ground for European empires.'' This phrase makes prefect understanding of Kochi which was formed as an ancient port city after the Great Floods of the Periyar River in 1341.  With partitioning of Chera Kerala empire in 14th century, this region came under control of a new dynasty, rivaled by other local feudal lords. With the advent of colonization, Kochi became the first major battle grounds of almost all European powers. However, least it made an impact over the fortunes of this city.

===History===

Kochi merchants began trading in spices such as black pepper and cardamom with the Arabs, Dutch, Phoenicians, Portuguese, and Chinese more than 600 years ago. This helped Kochi to prosper and to become the gateway to old India. It was from Kochi that the colonization of India started. Portugal was first to establish its base in Kochi in 1500s, followed by the Dutch and English. The Anglo-Dutch treaty of 1814, compelled the Dutch to hand over Kochi to the British in exchange for Bangka Island in Indonesia. The British managed to establish their influence over Kochi, limiting their direct administration to a small enclave of Fort Kochi and British Ernakulam with their capital at Bolgatty Island. The rest of the Kochi was administered by Kochi Maharajas from their capital at Thripunithura. However the real administration was done by ''Diwans'' (Prime Ministers), leaving the Maharajas to patronize culture, arts and focused heavily on public health and education areas. 

The foundations of modern Kochi city started when Sir Robert Bristow, a senior Royal Navy Engineer felt the need of a modern large port after the opening of Suez Canal. This made the creation of the largest man-made island in the country, the Willingdon Island to house new Kochi Port. 

In the 1930s, the [https://site.holidayworldwide.in Kochi] Maharaja joined the public outcry to form a common state of Malayalam-speaking people by merging with the Kingdom of Travancore and British Malabar. Kochi Maharaja Kerala Varma Raja was at the forefront of this agitation, and passed the Aykiakerala Resolution in the Kochi Parliament. In 1947, the Kingdom of Kochi and Travancore merged to form the Royal State of Travancore-Kochi. The Kochi Maharaja was amongst the first to advocate the state joining the newly formed Indian Union. Finally, in 1949 the state of Travancore-Kochi merged with India.

Since the formation of Kerala in 1957, Kochi has been the commercial capital of Kerala as well as the seat of the Kerala High Court. Since 2000, Kochi has revitalized its economy, with a focus on tourism, information technology, and the port.

===Culture===
[[Image:Fort Kochi.jpg|thumb|right|The colonial charms of Fort Kochi with arrays of traditional European bungalows and alleys]]
Kochi has a cosmopolitan culture, highly influenced by historical trading partners, Portuguese, Dutch, Arab, Chinese, and Japanese. Kochi has an unusual higher Christian population, thus the city being the seat of the Latin church of India, the ecclesiastical seat of one of the 4 Catholic Cardinals of India and has many Catholic churches and followers apart from other religious orders of Christianity.

Kochi was traditionally a potpourri of various Indian and international communities. Syrian Christians started the first wave of immigration, followed by Jews between the 7th and 10th centuries. Arab merchants also made a strong settlement in Kochi. In the 15th century, Gujaratis settled in Kochi, especially on Mattencherry Island, where they played a strong role in spice trading and other areas. Apart from that, nearly 31 trading communities across India call Kochi as their home. 

Later, at the beginning of the colonial era, the Portuguese, Dutch, French, and British all made their settlements in Kochi. The Portuguese had a strong influence in Fort Cochin while Dutch has lent many of its words and culinary influence into local cultures. British culture was strongly felt, lending Kochi a strong community of Anglo-Indians, the largest of the social group in India. 

In the early 1970s, Punjabis settled here, focusing their strong presence on the local automobile industry. Tamilians, Telugus, Kannadigas have all formed small settlements since the days of royalty. Recently, students from Cambodia, Thailand, Korea, and Indonesia have settled down in Kochi for studies and research activities. Kochi has a sizeable expatriate population mainly from European countries who have settled in Fort Kochi. Most of them are senior citizens who settled down to enjoy retirement life and many run boutique hotels and restaurants in that area. Due to the rapid growth of the city, a majority of the local population are immigrants.

Generally, Kochinites are modern and fashionable. Being a city that has a tradition of various cultures being given equal respect, a high level of tolerance exists.  The city has a modern attitude, but some basic social modesty still prevails, especially in villages and rural areas.

===Climate===

Kochi has a typical tropical climate. Temperatures range between 30&deg;C and 35&deg;C during daytime and around 24&deg;C during night. Kochi is one of the first places to experience the heavy Monsoon showers starting by mid of May. Kochi experiences heavy rainfall between mid of May to first week of September. Day time temperatures during the monsoon fall to  between 25&deg;C and 30&deg;C during these months. From September to early February, the weather is fine, marked with cool winds and light showers in between. However by February, summer season starts. Though temperatures never touch 40&deg;C, the presence of high humidity can make summers very harsh. This continues till early May. However frequent summer showers cool down the harshness of summer.

==Get around==

Getting around Kochi is not difficult. City transportation is not expensive.

===Orientation===

The main city arterial road is Mahatma Gandhi Road. Travelling inside the city at peak times (8AM-10AM, 1:30PM-2:30PM; 5:30PM-7:00PM) takes a lot of time, with frequent road blocks and traffic congestion. North and South Overbridges are two of the major bottlenecks. Knowledge of side roads and crossroads is very useful to avoid traffic blocks.  

Kochi has a typical Indian-style address system which is a bit confusing, as there is no sector or house numbering system. Most buildings have their own name which are commonly used along with the road name for the address, eg: ''Alappatt House, Diwans Road, Near Lakshmi Hospital''. 

Some up-market areas have their own house numbering system. Panampally Nagar and Giri Nagar are divided into various zones and each house has its own zone number followed by a house number. Many residential areas have formed their own associations and established their own addressing system. In most of the residential colonies or areas, a map sign is located at the entrance. Fort Kochi has a more western-style numbering system, yet still locals use the nearby landmarks for addressing, rather than house numbers. 

For communicating with auto/taxi drivers, you must know the nearby landmarks. 

===By bus===

[[Image:City bus.png|thumb|Kochi City Red Bus &amp; Thirukochi Line- BIG4 Routes. Feeder bus lines are not shown]]
Kochi has an excellent public bus network with four types of buses operated by Govt-run KSRTC and private operators. The most common option is privately operated '''Red buses''' (also referred to as 'Line buses') which provides a cheap no-frills journey. Using these is not that difficult as many destination boards have English lettering in small and most bus conductors can provide assistance in basic English, though route numbers exists only on papers. Peak hours on weekdays can lead to overcrowded buses, particularly Route 1. Government operated KSRTC also have a similar no-frills city services '''Thiru-Kochi''' which also ply in same Red-Bus routes. Thirukochi buses can be distinguished from other buses with its blue-white livery. Most of Red and Thirukochi buses run primarily on the '''Big 4 Routes'''. These cover virtually all parts of the city. There are other feeder routes, which interconnect places between these Big 4 Routes. Recently Vytilla-Vytilla circular services have launched, covering most of the city core. The fares for all city buses are Rs 4 for the first km and 55p for every additional km. The average waiting time is 1-10 mins. 

Apart from regular city services, KSRTC under JnNURM's funding operates 2 class of bus services which can be distinguished from other city buses with its distinctive livery and JnNURM logo. 

For premium travel low-floor air-conditioned Volvo services known as '''Orange buses''', connects many important destinations. The rates are Rs 10 for first 5 km and Rs 2 for every km thereafter. The average waiting time is 10-30 mins. These buses do stop anywhere on the route, as per passenger's request.  

[[Image:Orange bus Route.png|thumb|Kochi Orange Bus Line- Premium Low-floor Volvo A/c Bus services]]

For standard travel, '''Green bus''', which is non air-conditioned low floor services which virtually links all suburbs to city center. This is very ideal for budget tourists as connects to many far away tourist attractions while maintaining excellent standards. The rates are Rs 5 for first 5 kms and 75p for every km thereafter. Currently only 3 lines are served, which would be increased soon. Like Orange Bus, these bus also stops anywhere on the route, as per passenger's request. Timetable for Orange/Green available at KSRTC site [http://www.ksrtcblog.com/2010/05/ksrtc-kochi-volvo-non-ac-low-floor-city.html].

All city bus services start at 6AM and end by 10PM. A certain number of seats are allocated for women in the forward portion of each bus, and men must vacate them when a woman wishes to sit there. 

It must be noted that different bus shelters/stops are used for bus plying different routes. Though route notices are put before each stop, it will be in Malayalam. Route notices for Orange bus lines are now recently posted in English also. A query with locals or bus conductors helps a lot. The important city bus stations where all services touch are:
[[File:Kochi city -the night view of beautiful Vyttila Mob Hub.jpg|thumb|The Mobility Hub=Phase 1]]

Kochi metro was flagged off on 17th June 2017 and is operational from Aluva to Palarivattom. The second phase from Palarivattom up to Maharaja's College was made operational in October 2017.

The unveiling of the metro was considered a landmark event in India in terms of completion time, control systems used and initiatives such as employing transgenders, vertical gardening, respecting migrant laborers and use of solar power. Each station in the metro is designed on a specific theme around Kerala culture and geography. The metro can be used with regular tickets, and has also adopted a single card, single timetable and a singular command and control. This debit card along with the Kochi One Mobile App can be used for travel.

===By train===

Kochi does not have any local intra-city train service, but a metro line (Kochi Metro) is under construction and is operational from Aluva to Maharajah's College in the city. However, many suburban areas are well connected via regular passenger and long distance express trains. The most used route is between Ernakulam and Aluva. Almost all regular passenger, express and intercity trains have a stop at Aluva. Regular passenger trains have 1 minute stops at Edapally, Kumbalam, Angamally, and Aroor stations. Many long distance trains operate between Thripunithura and Kochi North station.  

It is a good idea to take the rail during busy peak hours when buses are overcrowded. Equally good idea, to take rail to Aluva from city center which is the nearest point to Airport (12 km) from where a cab or Orange Route A bus can taken to avoid city congested traffic.

===By autorickshaw===

This is a cheap method of transport between attractions. You can find an auto stand at almost every bus stop, and at important places near junctions and residential areas. Make sure you agree on a fare with the driver before the journey. The govt fixed rates starts at Rs 10 for the first 1.25 km and Rs 6 per km thereafter with a premium of 15% at night (7PM-6AM). However these rates are outdated and no more people follow though Govt hasn't changed yet. The practical rates are generally fixed ad-hoc by Auto Drivers Union, followed mostly uniformly among all city autos. The rates are generally Rs 20 as minimum fare for first 1.25 Km, with Rs 9 per km after this... The night charges changes only with increase of minimum fare to Rs 35, while per km rate remains same. However auto drivers may charge excessively, if they find you may not aware of general ad-hoc rates. Pre-paid auto stands are available only in railway stations.

===By auto taxis===

The new entrant to city's transportation sector is Autotaxis, which are hybrid varieties of both Taxi and Auto. They use Tata Iris vehicles, which are 4 wheeler hatch-back vehicle, but has operating platform mostly like an auto-rickshaw . They charge only Auto fares, not the standard taxi fares. The standard rate is Rs 15 per Km, with no minimum fare or night charges. They are mostly available on call, if one knows the number of driver or can be hired from road or from Auto-Taxi stand mostly near crowded places like Railway stations or Markets/Malls etc. As they have Pan-Kerala Taxi permit, one can travel medium haul distance like a trip to nearby city or town or village using Auto-Taxi. Most of the drivers are trained and are reported friendly as well as able to speak English & Hindi. Some of the taxis do have GPS enabled screens with Google Map support.

===By taxi===

Taxis are convenient, comfortable, and safer than auto rickshaws. If you are alone or going to an unknown destination, this is a good option, even though the rates will be double that of an auto. Unlike in most western countries,  regular taxis are not usually marked with signs on the top, and do not have taxi meters inside the cab. 

There are three type of taxi services, regular,call taxis and radio taxi. Regular taxis are normally available at designated taxi stands located at places such as railway stations, the airport, boat jetties, major bus stations and in front of important hotels. for radio taxi look above.

There is no need to negotiate prices, as most of them follow fixed rates. Regular taxis have tariff cards displayed on the dashboard. Call taxis have charges fixed by their respective companies (although they are normally uniform). The standard tariffs are Rs 50 for first 3 km, and Rs 8 per km thereafter. Add 10% for a cab with A/C, and 15-20% at night.

Many cab companies offer full or half day services. Most of them are fixed on ad-hoc basis, based on the negotiating skills of the passenger. Typical rates are Rs 1,100/1,500 for standard/AC cabs for a full day and Rs 500/750 for a half day. These rates are not available after 7PM.

===By private car===

Unless you are into adventure seeking, self drive in Kochi is not recommended as driving discipline is almost non-existent. There are long stretches of roads passing through heavily populated areas that have no median breaks and most of them being bi-lane roads which are mostly congested. A few major roads like MG Rd, NH Bypass Rd and Marine Drive are two lane-dual carriageways with good medians.  The speed limit inside city zone is 30 km/hr. Driving is on the left, and all foreign drivers need a valid International Driving Licence attested by the Road Transport Office (RTO). Driving outside the city limits is a fine experience with good scenery and far less traffic. Most of the bridges and few roads carry toll charges collected at manned toll plazas or checkpoints. Almost all tolls are uniformly charged separately for one/two way; 2 wheelers- Rs 3/5, 4 wheelers- Rs 5/10 and bus/minivans - Rs 15/25. Almost all the toll pass is valid for unlimited travel for a period of 24 hours, though a few bridges allow one time validity. 

Car rental is not so popular among foreign visitors. Many car rental companies refuse to provide self-drive cars to Westerners. Normally a bank guarantee letter or security cheque/traveller's cheque to the value of the car or a passport are taken as security for renting the car. No security deposit is needed if the car is chauffeur-driven.  

Most hotels with three stars or more provide private cars for their guests at rates slightly higher than elsewhere.

===By ferry===
[[Image:Ferry service.png|thumb|Kochi Ferry Route Map]]

Kochi has an excellent system of cheap (4.00rs Park Jetty to Fort Kochi) inter-island ferries. The Ro-Ro (roll on-roll off) ferry service called ''Junkar'' between Fort Kochi and Vypeen is very popular **UPDATE!As of April 2018 the Vypeen-Fort Kochi Vehicle ferry has been out of action for 2months. Vehicles must make the round trip through Ernakulam**. There are regular boat services operated by KSINC and other private operators, every 20-30 minutes, from Ernakulam to Mattancherry, Fort Kochi, Vypeen and Willingdon Island which are cheaper and in many cases faster, than buses.

The major boat jetties are Ernakulam Main Jetty (located in Marine drive near High Court), Park Jetty (in Park Avenue next to KSRTC Bus station), Customs Embarkation Jetty in Willingdon Island, Fort Kochi Jetties. Do take a look at the map provided, as some ferries do not stop at all stops along the way. A few tourist oriented private ferries service non-scheduled routes during tourist seasons connecting mainly to Kumbalangi Tourist village from Ernakulam Main Jetty as well as from Aroor.

===By foot===

Kochi is traditionally not a pedestrian friendly city, considering the humid tropical climate, poor state of pedestrian walkways and reckless traffic. Fort Kochi is one of the better places to walk, with elaborate colonial-style stone pavements. There are many attractions in Fort Kochi which you can walk between.

===By cycle===

Fort Kochi is a perfect place for cycling with dedicated tracks and walkways. There are several tourist firms that offers cycles and bikes on hourly basis. A popular option is Vasco Information Center in Fort Kochi ☎ +91 484 2216215), which rents cycles for Rs 7 on hourly basis.

*Koonan Kurishu Pazhaya Suriyani Palli ,  Lobo Junction ,Near kayees hotel ,Mattamchery. . * 'The church made of Mud'

St George orthodox Koonan Kurishu Old Syrian church is one of the historical centres of St Thomas Christians (also known as Syrian Christians and Nazrani Christians). The famous oath called Koonan Kurishu Sathyam ( Coonan Cross Oath) against Roman Catholic Petroado policies and Portugese rule was taken at this church in AD 1653 by the native Indian christians by holding on to a cord tied to a cross. The cross bent under pressure and hence the name ‘Koonan Kurisu’( Bent cross / leaning cross).  The cross and Church was distroyed by the portugese immediately after oath. 

The Koonan Kurishu Sathyam ( coonan cross oath) took place at this Church in AD 1653 is the first attempt to resist colonialism and western invasion in India .

In AD 1751 Church was dedicated to St George with the installation of holy relics of St George in its altar , is a unique specialty of this Church. The church is owned by Malankara Orthodox Church ( Indian Orthodox Church),one of the 6 oriental churches. Considering the historic importance of the Koonankurish Pally, the Holy Synod elevated the status of the Church and declared it a historic monument as well as a pilgrim centre.

Apart from the historical legacy the method adopted for the  recent renovation of the church building assumes importance. The church is built using clay to keep faith with the ancient architecture heritage. The use of cement and steel have been completely avoided. The church located at Mattancherry , Cochin is constructed entirely of compressed earth blocks (CSEB). The distinct style with catenary vaults, arches and a dome evokes the past in a way, never seen before. The technique of construction was developed in Egypt, today known as the Nubian Technique.

The koonan kurishu ( coonan cross) is now reinstalled in this church.

===Cuisine===

For the past 600 years, Kochi has catered to many vistors from around the world including Arabs, Chinese, Portuguese, French, English, Dutch, Russians and Japanese. This has made the city a melting pot of various cultures, and this diversity is evident in the cuisine. 

Being a coastal city, plenty of fresh seafood is the local speciality. With the backwaters, freshwater fish is also popular here. Prawns, squids and shrimps are easily available and cooked in many styles.  The most famous of Kochi's specialty dishes is ''Meen Molagitta Curry'' (smoked freshwater fish with chilly and coconut milk). The English popularized smoked fish with steamed bread and mashed potatoes. One of Kochi's traditional vegetarian specialties is ''Kurukku Kalan'' (a thick yogurt curry with toasted banana and hot rice). Packed ''Kurukku Kalan'' as well as ''Palada'' (a sweet dessert with rice flakes and milk) are sold in many supermarkets and food stalls, especially during festive times.

At Fort Kochi beach you can buy fresh fish and have it cooked at the nearby food stalls. Fishmongers will sell you a kilo of tiger prawns for around Rs 300 and a kilo of squid for around Rs 250. Food stalls will charge you Rs 40-50 per person to cook your fish (grilled, curry, whatever) and provide you with a serve of chips and salad. Conditions are reasonably hygienic.

''Fried fish'', ''Fish molly'' (a coconut milk sauce based curry almost like stew), ''Alleppey fish curry'' (traditional curry with tomato sauce and fish tamarind) and ''Fish Peera'' (chunks of fish toasted with grated coconuts with fish tamarind sauce), ''Varatharacha Kozhi'' curry (semi-fried chicken toasted with coconut and chilly) are the favorites, usually taken with rice or steamed ''tapioca'' (cassava). Also worth trying are the traditional rice based breakfast snacks, puttu and kadala, appam and stew.

===Restaurants===

====Budget====

Kochi has a variety of cheap restaurants all over the city. A full meal should cost less than Rs 50. 

'''Thattukadas''' are streetside food hawkers, where you can get hot, fresh-cooked delicious food, costing a maximum of Rs 50 for a good filling meal. Most offer set meal combinations served from portable cooking trolleys with a few benches or chairs nearby. The most famous delicacies are stuffed or plain ''thattu dosas'' (thick dosas almost like pizza bread), hot Kerala ''porottas'' (flat bread of milled wheat), Kerala roast beef with chappatti and ''kanzhi'' (rice porridge). The main concern is the lack of hygiene and constant reuse of oil for frying. 

Kochi has some home-grown fast food chains: KR Hot Chicken, 61 Pai Dosas, Luciya's Food Court, Potpurri, The Oven, Krispy Chicken, Arabian Treat, Papa Milano's and Breadworld Broasted Chicken have a presence in most parts of town.

==Stay safe==

Kochi is one of the safest cities in India with excellent police coverage. Common sense is of course required when being alone at night. 

* Late night life is not common in Kochi. If you are planning on clubbing, make your own transport arrangements before hand, very few buses ply after 9.45PM, and none after 10.30PM. You can find autos and taxis, but only near railway stations or major bus stands. Be wary of eve-teasers, especially drunkards.

* Kochi is infamous for mosquitoes, due to presence of large water bodies across the city. Make sure any room you book, has mosquito repellents or at least a mosquito net. Its always better to have any anti-mosquito creams or spice oil extracts like lemongrass oil to ward off mosquito bites. Malaria is eradicated, but beware of dengue fever.

* Crossing roads - unlike in the other cities in India, vehicles do not tend to stop when you initiate crossing; so wait till there is a comparative lull in the traffic - the oncoming vehicles will slow down for you.

* Be wary of Private Line bus and KSRTC bus drivers on the roads. Pedestrians live a hard life especially during peak hours in Kochi. There are many cases of road accidents and hit-run cases involving private buses and pedestrians, thus earning them the nickname, ''Red Killers''. Take extra care, while crossing the roads. If difficult to cross then do so only at major signal junctions or seek assistance of local traffic policeman. 

* Kochi lacks good pedestrian walkways, though many are being rebuilt now, along with the roads. Beware of walking on these walkways, especially during night. Jaywalking may be safe in the nights in sub-urban roads, but with the coming of better roads and with an increasing traffic, avoid walking on the roads in the city, especially in the daytime.

* Kochi is located a few metres below the sea level, so a few roads in the arterial city tend to flood during rainfall. Its better to avoid such roads while raining. When the these roads are flooded it may be difficult to distinguish whether you are walking on road or walkway, which sometimes can land you inside drainage holes. However, these floods do tend to drain off quickly after the rain. Flood prone roads are - Edapally Junction, roads leading to Ernakulam Junction (South) Railway Station, South junction (in front of Hotel Woodlands)

* Public smoking bans are strictly enforced in the city more so than in other regions. The High Court of Kerala has decreed a public smoking ban across the state. Smoking on the roadside, in shopping complexes, restaurants, and parks is illegal and police can charge Rs 500-1,000 for breaches. No shop that sells loose cigars or tobacco is allowed to provide lighters. Provision of lighters to customers may lead to a Rs 150 fine being imposed upon both the supplier and the purchaser.

* Prostitution is illegal in Kochi, as elsewhere in Kerala and India. However there is a very good chance, you will likely encounter street prostitutes and their agents, who may try to lure you. Beware of such offers, as many of such prostitutes are affected by HIV. Being illegal, they have no access to medical controls or treatments. As it is a criminal offence to commit adultery, regular police raids occur in local cheap hotels to catch prostitutes and their clients.
