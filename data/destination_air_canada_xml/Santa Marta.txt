'''Santa Marta''' is a city in the [[Magdalena Department]] of [[Colombia]]'s [[Costa Norte (Colombia)|Costa Norte]].

== Understand ==

[[Image:Santa Marta 3.JPG|thumb|Plaza de Bolívar: Banco de la República and Café Juan Valdez]]

Santa Marta an important commercial port and tourist destination. Every day, there are cargo ships coming and going and the action is very much so visible. From the beach, the view of the Caribbean Sea is more or less to the west (beautiful sunsets) with a huge rock of an island jutting up out of the water to make a somewhat dramatic effect. Off to the right is the port snug behind another even bigger rock. This is a decent beach if you like beaches that are right in town with lots of people, aggressive vendors, and plenty of noise. 

Aside from the old center, the main attractions of Santa Marta are its two resort-like suburbs El Rodadero, to the south, and [[Taganga]], to the north. El Rodadero has several high-end hotels and private "clubs" that cater mostly to wealthy Colombians, whereas [[Taganga]] was originally a fishing village and is very popular with (mostly foreign) backpackers. Taganga has many scuba-diving agencies.

There is a high season and low season. High season is December through April, with its peak from mid-december to late January (due to school and university vacations).

== Get in ==

The Simón Bolívar International airport (same name as the one in Caracas, Venezuela) has non-stop flights from [[Bogotá]], [[Medellín]], [[Cali]], [[Pereira]], [[Bucaramanga]] and San Andrés. It is located along the beach, 20 min south of town, but much closer to most of the beach resorts and only 10 min from El Rodadero (main beach). If you get in from abroad check if baggage is unloaded in Bogota even if airlines promise they´ll send the baggage directly to Santa Marta. 


VivaAir [https://app.vivaair.com/co/en] (formerly VivaColombia) has the only international flight: Miami, twice a week. VivaAir is building Santa Marta as an airport base, expanding the current 4 domestic routes (Bogotá, Medellín, Pereira and Bucaramanga) to other destinations.

The bus station is all the way out of town on the main highway (7,000 pesos to the beach in taxi. You should fix the price before you get into the taxi. Mini-bus 1600 Pesos and 1700 on holidays anywhere in the city.
Bus rides are available from:
* [[Cartagena (Colombia)|Cartagena]] (3.5 hours).
 - Linea Flamingo: 30.000 COP (July 2018), takes an hour longer because of several stops on the road
* [[Barranquilla]] (2 hours).
* [[Medellín]] (15 hours).
* [[Bucaramanga]] (8 hours).
* [[Bogotá]] (16 hours).
* [[San Gil]] (13 hours). 75,000 COP p/p with Copetran leaving Santa Marta at 18:30 and arriving at 07:00 the next day (as of March 2019) and Brasilia expreso in November 2016.

For more comfortable road travel across northern Colombia, a few companies offer air conditioned van services between Cartagena and Santa Marta, with stops in Barranquilla en route. Cochetur seems to be the most reputable of these. Price is 50,000 pesos per person between the main two stops and they will pick you up and drop you off at your desired location in each city. Note: you will likely share the van with 6-8 people including the driver.  Tipping did not appear to be expected but a thousand or two goes a long way here.

There are also exclusive private '''transfers by taxi''' which don't cost a lot more if you are more than one person and if you don't want to wait until the busses have picked up or dropped off anyone else.

== Get around ==

Unlike bigger cities in Colombia, taxis do not run on a meter. The cost for a single ride around the city is a maximum of $8,000 COP (as of March 2019). We paid $5000 COP for a ride from the centre to the hostal Galera Republic (december 2019)

== Do ==

* The nearby coral reefs provides good possibilities for '''scuba diving'''. All the scuba diving operators are at Taganga, so you'll need to go there to shop around (prices are very different from one to another). You can follow the PADI course (3-4 days), or just go for a 1-day dive (no licence required). 2 fun dives range from 200.000-280.000 in different dive centers so make sure you look around the day before (June 2022), if you haven't dived in more than 6 months, add 20.000 to the price they advertise. Most dive centers close by 19h.

* On the beaches (in Rodadero or sometimes Santa Marta), you can usually rent a jet ski in increments of 10 minutes. If you are not comfortable operating one, you can usually ask for a ride around. Life jackets are provided. You will find that the further away you get from the population centres, the cleaner the beaches are. It is little known fact that Bahia Concha which is just inside Tayrona National Park has no entrance fee instead of the 54000 charged at the main entrances (but does require payment of a toll when entering on the main road).  Please note that Bahia Concha is not connected to the more well known beaches in the park. Los Angeles and Costeño beaches just to the east of Tayrona are great if you want to escape the hordes at the weekend and stay somewhere a bit nicer than the dilapidated and overpriced options inside the Park. That said, the actual beaches themselves inside Tayrona are truly spectacular, some of the most beautiful in the world, and well worth a visit.

* '''[[Minca]]''' is a small village 650m above Santa Marta reached in a 9000 peso colectivo via a 45 min bumpy mountain road from "Estacion de Minca" en Calle 11 con 12 en el mercado publico de Santa Marta. The village centre itself is a quaint friendly little mountain town with not much to offer other than a few nice new restaurants and pool halls in the centre. It is only when you explore to it's very hilly edges you will discover the real magic of Minca in some truly spectacular hostels, fincas and places to chill by the river or with a beer and a panoramic vistas to the sea far below.

* Birdwatching at the world famous El Dorado, a bird reserve brimming with natural treasures. It is one of the most important bird reserves in the world and also harbours many rare amphibians and plants. The elegant wooden cabins command an amazing view of the ocean above Minca.

* '''[[Paso Del Mango]]''' is a tiny village in the Sierra Nevada mountains located on an old Tayrona civilization. 50 min from Santa Marta. There are plenty of waterfalls, natural pools, endemic animal and plant species and a range of hikes to make. Daytrips are possible. There are several possibilities to sleep and eat. Off the beaten track paradise.

* '''La [[Ciudad Perdida]] (Lost City)''' are ancient indigenous ruins that predate Macchu Picchu. Visiting takes a 4-6 days hike (roundtrip). You must go with a tour company due to indigenous land protection. Tours are fixed and cost 1.400.000 (June 2022) when visiting tourist agencies, although some online pages charge 1.500.000 and more. What is different is debit/credit card fees, which vary between 2-5%. Some agencies allow payment of the deposit (200.000) with 5% surcharge (so only 10.000 extra), but nothing on the rest when paying on the day.

== Buy ==

Santa Marta is famous for its beach sellers. someone can go to the beach 365 days a year, there are always people wandering up and down the beach selling anything. 
The beaches in the northern suburb El Rodadero have aggressive sellers, take this as an opportunity to haggle. Usually aim for 2000-3000 Pesos below the price asked.

If you are planning to go to Tayrona and need to buy snorkeling gear, you'll be disappointed to see only a couple of very basic chinese packs, the same in all the shops. If you decide to buy them, the cheapest prices are in a kitchenware shop at calle 15 with carrera 3 (15COP for the "good" one).

"Mochilas": the most popular bag of the country is made in "La Sierra Nevada", Santa Marta region. They are made by the Khoguis (indigenous people still  living in La Sierra Nevada). You can find them anywhere else in the country since they are very popular but you will have more choice and it will be a way cheaper in Santa Marta (60 000pesos for a big one)

== Drink ==

'''Santo Domingo''' Calle 17 No. 3 - 70 near the cathedral. The best place to party in Santa Marta. The owners are super nice, they will personally attend. The owners are two Spanish. That women more beautiful and rumba, to good music and really nice atmosphere.I always found it a good show. Thanks Elena and Kike

'''Crab's Bar''' - a fun rock n' roll bar. The Colombian owner (who is a spitting image of Neil Young) used to own a large rock club in Bogotá, but he sold it to settle down here. Every evening he VJ's videos of all the great classic rock bands. Friendly staff, great vibe, nice décor. Calle 18 No. 3-69 (between Carr 3 & 4). www.crabsbar.com
 
'''Seko Bar''' - A cool new bar at the walking street of Santa Marta's centro historico. Cold beers and economic cocktails. Music without vallenato. Play free pool while sipping techno sluts. Coffee and iced coffee drinks available. Propably the only place in town where you can find single malt Scotch whiskey. Good place to start and end you evening. Open everyday save occaisional sundays.

'''Burukuka''' - A trendy nightclub on the way towards El Rodadero. Burukuka sits on top of a hill overlooking the sea, with a great terrace. It's a high-end place, so dress appropriately. Also serves food. Vía al Edificio Cascadas del Rodadero, just out of town, to the south. [http://www.burukuka.com].

'''Miko''' - the only place where you can listen to electronic music in Santa Marta. Their delicious cocktails and amazing view on the bay make this place a must-seen at night or for the sunset.

'''La Puerta''' - the most popular place among locals. Enjoy the local songs and discover the rythms of the Carribean. Try to dance with a local if you want the experience to be amazing.

The drink of choice is, of course, beer! Because Santa Marta can get brutally hot during the summer (upwards of 35 C/95F), it is a good idea to constantly have a bottle of water with you. During the evenings, when it gets cooler, beer and friends is often an excellent combination. It would be good idea to take a couple of "Stubbie Coolers" (Australian vernacular for an item which keeps the beer in your bottle cooler or longer) as the heat will have you drinking warm beer by the time you are at the end of your drink.


Soft drinks can be found at nearly every restaurant - sometimes you can even pick it up in glass bottles. They are cheap: a Drink usually costs no more than 2,000 COP.

Ask about Ben´s Bar on the Beach. Barrio Samario, La Puerta, and El Garage.

==Get out==

===By bus===
The long-distance bus station which offers buses to Bogotá, Medellin, Venezuela and also Barranquila and Cartagena, is quite far away from the city center.

To get there, you can catch a bus/colectivo with a sign saying "UCC TRANSPORTE", at carrera 1. The ride will take some 45 minutes. If carrying a big backpack, you might be rejected by some colectivo drivers, just wait for the big buses.

In the bus terminal, you can get free wifi at the tourist office. From the bus station you'll find 2 main possibilities for going south: via Medellín or via Bogotá. The first is controlled by a couple of companies that fix very high prices.

If you're heading to the Coffee Region, a cheaper option is to catch a Berlinastur bus to Honda (70,000COP, 12+ hours, departure at 14pm), and right after that another bus to Pereira (30,000COP, 6hours). You'll need to wait for an hour or so in the middle of the night in Honda, but you can stay at Berlinastur office during that time.

To go to Tayrona NP or [[Palomino]] you don't need to go all the way out of town to the highway bus terminal. Buses leave from the bus terminal at Carrera 13 near Calle 11 ([https://www.google.com/maps/place/Santa+Marta,+Magdalena,+Colombia/@11.2446393,-74.2027451,479m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x8ef4f66ff59a173d:0x124b95fc153af9b8!8m2!3d11.2403547!4d-74.2110227 map]). The bus rides cost COP7,000 (Tayrona) and COP9,000 (Palomino).(08/2016)

For [[Minca]], you can either get a blue bus to Yucal and take a mototaxi from there for COP7,000, or wait at "Estacion de Minca" (Calle 11 y Carreta 12, near the mercado) for a shared taxi to fill up (COP 8,000 as of March 2019).

To go to Cartagena, take either Berlinastour, the bus ride should be 30,000 COP as of July 2018. Linea Flamingos also goes to Cartagena via Barranquilla for 25,000-30,000 COP depending on your bargaining skills (as of March 2019), but they make multiple stops to pick up more customers, making it a 5-hour trip. Brasiliana / Unitransco also has a line from Santa Marta to Cartagena although they frequently sell the same ticket twice and their busses can easily have a 1.5 hours delay.

===By air===
The bus to the airport passes the beach (Carrera 1c), you can get on there. It takes about an hour to get to the airport. If you are unlucky, you will encounter a busdriver that claims you have to pay extra for your big bag or suitcase. This is not true. You only need to pay the normal fee (usually stated on a sign or paper somewhere in the bus). One way to avoid this is to have (almost) exact change ready.

You may find that the price of flying between the major cities in Colombia is almost the same as (or cheaper than) taking the bus, but much quicker. VivaColombia, the low-cost airline, have direct flights from Santa Marta to Bogota and Medellin, as do LAN and Avianca. Reportedly it is cheaper to book on the airlines' Colombian websites, and in Spanish! Many people report problems paying for VivaColombia flights with foreign credit cards - one solution is to pay at Exito, the Supermarket chain (this is one of the payment options at checkout).
