'''Ivalo''' (Northern Sami: ''Avvil'', Inari Sami: ''Avveel'', Skolt Sami: ''Âˊvvel'') is a town in [[Finnish Lapland]]. 

== Understand ==
Ivalo is the administrative centre of the vast Inari municipality and most of the services of the municipality are located here. As well as almost half of the population. For most tourists Ivalo is just a place to sleep or fill resources. 

Even though Inari municipality is Sámi area, the Ivalo town is mostly Finnish. There is a very small military base close to the town so you may occasionally see some conscripts or military personnel hanging around.

==Get in==
===By plane===
'''Ivalo Airport''' ({{IATA|IVL}}) [http://www.finavia.fi/lentoasema_ivalo] is the northernmost airport in Finland.  There are scheduled flights from Helsinki by Finnair (twice a day) and Norwegian (thrice a day) depending on the season. There are also many charter flights from all over Europe during the Christmas/New Year peak tourism season.  The airport has a regular bus service to [[Saariselkä]] (25 km, 20 min, &euro;7,50), but none to central Ivalo (17 km).  Taxis to Ivalo, [[Utsjoki]] and Saariselkä cost around &euro;17, &euro;27 and &euro;35 respectively.

===By bus===
Ivalo is along highway E75 from [[Utsjoki]] to [[Sodankylä]] and the railhead at [[Rovaniemi]] (3 hours away), and is thus served by any buses plying this route.  Gluttons for punishment can even take a direct bus from [[Helsinki]], which takes around 19 hours.

One-way bus ticket from Rovaniemi to Ivalo is about 54 euros and from Helsinki to Ivalo about 110 euros.

There has been a bus connection from Ivalo to [[Murmansk]] (in Russia) but it doesn't seem to work in 2019 anymore.

==Get around==
Since it is a small town, it is very easy to walk everywhere. There are bicycle paths along the main road.

==See==
Ivalo is a little town with very little to see for the typical tourist. That's why most people head straight for much more interesting destinations like [[Inari]] or [[Saariselkä]].

* '''Ivalojoki River '''   is the perfect location for canoeing and fishing in the summer, and snowmobiling and cross-country skiing in the winter.

* '''Ivalojoki  Beach ''' Ivalo’s village centre boasts the best beach in Ivalojoki – a unique feature in these latitudes.
