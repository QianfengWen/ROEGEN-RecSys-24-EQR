'''Amarillo''' [http://www.amarillo-cvb.org], which means "yellow" in Spanish, is the center of the [[Panhandle (Texas) | Texas Panhandle]], located at the edge of the Great Plains and is also know as the "Yellow Rose" of Amarillo.

Amarillo offers a true Western heritage, a unique geographical area with wide open spaces and breathtaking sunrises and sunsets. Amarillo is also gateway to [[Palo Duro Canyon]], America's second largest canyon. With its relatively mild climate, the city is rated as having some of the cleanest air in the country.
Indians, conquistadors, buffalo hunters, settlers, cowboys, adventurers, lawmen, gunfighters, and the railroad all contributed in many ways to the development and growth of the area. That heritage is still felt here, where "cowboy" is still an honorable profession. Here you can enjoy the very best of the Old and New West!
Founded in 1887, the city charter was adopted in 1913. Amarillo is one of the first cities in the nation to use the City Commissioner-City Manager form of government. Now home to close to 200,000 residents (more than 300,000 in the metro area), the city features excellent accommodations, a spacious convention/civic center, symphony, ballet, little theater, opera, and is the home of Amarillo College.

Though technically located on the very northern tip of the [[Llano Estacado|Llano Estacado Plateau]], Amarillo has closer ties with the [[High Plains]] region, serving as the economic, industrial, transportation, and cultural hub of the region.

}}
Amarillo is at a high elevation (3,605 ft) and has mostly a flat topography, with exception of the Canadian River valley to the north, and Palo Duro Canyon, to the south/southeast.  This comes with bright sunshiny days when sunny, and an almost continuously windy condition year-round.  Average winds range from 12 miles per hour in August to 15.5 miles per hour in March, but can be much stronger, with or without storms or fronts coming through.  While wind can blow from any direction, the prevailing winds in the area come from the southwest.  The air is usually dry, especially in winter, so it's a good idea to have lip balm and skin lotion/cream handy when in the area.

===Water quality===
While the water from faucets is generally clear, the water that comes from city pipes in Amarillo has an unpleasant taste.  It is good idea to drink mainly filtered or bottled water when in the area.

Amarillo is located on:
*'''Interstate 40''' east of [[Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]] and west of [[Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma]] (There is no street naming of I-40 through the city.).
*'''Interstate 27''' north of [[Lubbock]], [[Texas]] (Also called Canyon Drive into the city, although locals may be heard calling it "Canyon Expressway" or "the E-way".).
*'''U.S. Highway 60''' west-southwest of [[Pampa]], [[Texas]], and northeast of [[Clovis]], [[New Mexico]] (Follows Amarillo Blvd. along the north and northeast side of the city, as well as Canyon Drive south of downtown.  In the downtown area, it follows Buchanan Street northbound and Pierce Street southbound in a one-way pair.).
*'''U.S. Highway 87''' south-southeast of [[Dalhart]], [[Texas]], and north of Lubbock, Texas (Follows Dumas Drive (although some locals may refer to it as "Dumas Expressway") north from downtown, as well as Canyon Drive south of downtown.  In the downtown area, it follows Fillmore Street northbound and Pierce Street southbound in a one-way pair.).
*'''U.S. Highway 287''' northwest of [[Childress]], [[Texas]], and south of [[Boise City]], [[Oklahoma]] (Follows Dumas Drive north from downtown, as well as I-40 east of downtown.  In the downtown area, it follows Buchanan Street northbound and Taylor Street southbound in a one-way pair.).
*'''[[Route 66]]''' (officially was '''U.S. Highway 66'''), which passed through town east-west mainly along Amarillo Blvd.  In a previous routing west of downtown, Route 66 followed SW 6th Avenue, Bushland Blvd., and SW 9th Avenue.
*'''Texas State Highway 136''' south-southwest of [[Borger]], [[Texas]] (Follows Panhandle Blvd. (although some locals may refer to it as "Fritch Highway") on the northeast side of the city.)
* Amarillo is also surrounded by '''Texas State Loop 335''' (most will likely refer to it as simply "'''Loop 335'''"; it follows Hollywood Road along the city's south side, Soncy Road on the west side, St. Francis Ave. along the north, and Lakeside Drive on the east.).

==Get around==

Public transit is woefully inadequate, taxis are rare and expensive, cycle only if you have little regard for your life and want to share the road with truck drivers who aren't used to cyclists. Get a car.

The N-S avenues in central Amarillo are named for the presidents of the United States in order of when they served, from Washington just west of downtown through Cleveland to the east. Most of the E-W avenues are numbered, from N 24th through S 58th.

Old Route 66 crosses east to west through Amarillo, named Amarillo Boulevard. It passes just to the north of the airport, downtown, and the medical center, connecting US-60 on the east side with I-40 on the west side.

Loop 335 has been designated, but has not yet been developed into a limited access loop as in other cities. It comprises Soncy Road on the west (near Westgate Mall), St. Francis Avenue on the north, Hollywood Road on the south, and Lakeside Drive on the east (near the airport).

*'''Cadillac Ranch''', originally an eccentric roadside attraction placed by the art collective ''Ant Farm'' on the now decommissioned Route 66 it was moved and can now be found via a frontage road for I-40 just outside of Amarillo.  You can see it from I-40; it will be on the southern side of the road.  Park along the side of the road and walk about 100 yards to see ten old Cadillacs upended and half-buried in a cow pasture.  Visitors are encouraged to spray-paint the cars; there are spray paint cans in a hole at the end of the formation.  Surprisingly compelling.  If you have GPS you can try using 35°11′14″N, 101°59′13.4″W to find it.

*'''Dynamite Museum''', another art project. This one consists of psuedo-road signs, scattered among commercial and residential parts of Amarillo.  They feature sayings and pictures that are seeming non-sequiturs.

==Stay safe==
As with any area, it is good to be aware of your surroundings. Although the Route 66 path through Amarillo is a draw for visitors, part of its path through town included Amarillo Boulevard. In the decades since I-40 bypassed it, the part of Amarillo Blvd. from the center of town to the east has not been the safest area to dwell in at night. Be aware there during the day, but other parts of town are better at night.
	
LGBT people face attitudes that are hostile here. The Panhandle takes a conservative stance on homosexuality and is not LGBT friendly. Public displays of affection are frowned upon. Violence happen towards LGBT and police turn a blind eye to violence towards the amount of LGBT, join in, or are complicit. Also businesses are not LGBT friendly you will be refused service. LGBT should stay out of Amarillo and the Panhandle.

Another thing to be aware of in the Amarillo area are certain insects and critters; specifics to watch for in the city and surroundings include tarantulas, brown recluse spiders, stinging scorpions, and rattlesnakes. For those who will be in or through Amarillo in wintertime, make sure you have adequate winter clothing, as it can get cold and snowy then, with potentially bitterly cold wind chill values. If driving, you may need additional items such as tire chains/cables or cat litter for adequate traction in inclement weather. The wind in the Amarillo area can get gusty at times throughout the year, which can lead to stiff crosswinds felt while driving, especially if you are on a bridge or overpass, so make sure you are attentive to your steering during those times.

==Cope==

* A taste of the Old West can be found with '''[https://www.cowgirlsandcowboysinthewest.com Cowgirls & Cowboys in the West]''' <do name="" alt="" address="(19100 FM-1258" directions="30 minutes from Amarillo" lat="" long="" phone="+1 806 672-9256)" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">  There are 2 ranch venues: Los Cedros Ranch, which offers 1-, 2-, and 3-hour horseback rides near or along the north rim of Palo Duro Canyon; and Longhorn Ranch/Doves Rest Resort (near the entrance to Palo Duro Canyon State Park), which hosts outdoor chuck-wagon-style morning breakfast/brunch, or evening dinner.  The chuck-wagon meals include musical entertainment and a local history narrative.  Either venue requires advance reservations.</do>
* On the way to '''[[Fritch]]''' (36 miles northeast on TX-136), is the '''[https://www.nps.gov/alfl/index.htm Alibates Flint Quarries National Monument]''' (<see name="" alt="" address="" directions="Turn left at Cas Johnson Road, a brown guide sign will point to the turn.

A visitor center with displays and gift items is on-site.  Guided tours of the area with a Park Ranger are available by appointment.  Another feature that can be seen there are several petroglyphs etched by Natives on dolomite rock formations.</see> A bit farther north off TX-136 is the '''[https://www.nps.gov/lamr/index.htm Lake Meredith National Recreation Area]''', along the shore of Lake Meredith, and adjacent to the town of Fritch.  Many activities can be enjoyed at the lake, including boating, fishing, camping, picnic areas, as well as hike, bike, and 4-wheel trails.
* In '''Goodnight''' (40 miles southeast on US-287), is the '''[https://charlesgoodnight.org Charles Goodnight Historical Center]''' <see name="" alt="" address="4989 County Rd 25, Claude" directions="Go SE of Amarillo and Claude to Goodnight, then right on CR 25, the Historical Center will be on the right" lat="" long="" phone="+1 806 944-5591" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="Tuesday-Saturday 10:00 am-5:00 pm" price="">Site of the restored ranch house lived in by Goodnight and his wife.

* In '''[[Panhandle (Texas, city)|Panhandle]]''' (32 miles northeast on US-60), is the '''Carson County Square House Museum''' <see name="" alt="" address="(503 Elsie St. (TX-207, at E. Fifth St)" directions="" lat="" long="" phone="+1 806 537-3524)" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">Indoor/outdoor displays of local historic early pioneer and railroad artifacts, based in an old restored home.</see>
* Tracing the path of '''[[Route 66]]''' east or west from the city leads to bypassed towns and historic places.  Watch for signs like [[File:Business_Loop_40.svg|18px]] or [[File:Historic-66.png|18px]] for the way off the interstate.  Going '''east''', there is [[Conway]] (25 miles east), [[Groom]] (42 miles east), [[McLean]] (73 miles east), and [[Shamrock]] (93 miles east).  Going '''west''', there is [[Vega (Texas)|Vega]] (34 miles west), [[Adrian]] (48 miles west) which claims to be the mid-point of Route 66, and the ghost town of [[Glenrio]] (70 miles west).
* For those wanting more Cadillac Ranch-style outdoor art, there is '''Combine City''' (FM 1151 near Whitaker Rd, SE of Amarillo; GPS users try: 35°05'29.8"N, 101°45'59.8"W (35.0916, -101.7666)) which has 12 different wheat combines partially buried at an angle similar to that of Cadillac Ranch.  The site is fenced, so the combines can only be admired or photographed from the road, no spray-painting or trespassing.  Another version east of Amarillo is '''VW Slug Bug Ranch''' (in Conway, I-40 (''exit #96'') at TX 207 (south side of interstate, west of TX 207 on service road, between 2 motels); GPS users try: 35°12'55.8"N, 101°23'01.3"W (35.2155, -101.3837)), which has 5 partially buried Volkswagen Beetles alongside the service road.  The cars are accessible and have been spray painted, like the Cadillac Ranch cars.
* A historic site that exemplifies the Amarillo area's Old West past is preserved at the site of '''Tascosa''' (40 miles northwest of Amarillo (''Go northwest on Ranch to Market Road 1061 to US-385, then right.  Cross Canadian River bridge, then right on Texas Highway Spur 233''), once home to lawmen and lawless alike, and the first county seat of Oldham County.  In its time, Tascosa rivaled [[Dodge City]], [[Kansas]] in importance.  And like Dodge City, Tascosa had its own Boot Hill Cemetery, populated with those who tried--and failed--to take the law into their own hands.  Bypassed by the railroad, and also hit by the eventual fencing-off of the Plains, Tascosa slowly faded in importance, and lost its county seat to [[Vega (Texas)|Vega]].  Before it became a complete ghost town, the town site was part of a land transaction to form '''[https://www.calfarley.org/boysranch/ Cal Farley's Boys Ranch]''', which houses and schools troubled kids 18 and younger.  Visitors can see '''Boot Hill Cemetery''' and the <see name="Julian Bivins Museum" alt="" address="" directions="" lat="" long="" phone="" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price=""> (housed in the former county courthouse), preserved as part of the Boys Ranch acreage, while on a tour of the facilities.  Tours are by reservation by calling ☎ +1 800 687-3722, Monday-Friday 8:00 am-5:00 pm.</see>
* Another historic site outside of Amarillo is '''[https://www.mobeetie.com Mobeetie]''' <see name="" alt="" address="(85 miles east-northeast of Amarillo)" directions="Go on US-60 northeast past Pampa, then right on TX-152.  At Mobeetie, turn right on FM-48 and go about 5 blocks." lat="" long="" phone="" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">, the site of the panhandle's first courthouse, post office, and school.  The town, an outgrowth of the former Fort Elliott, served as a form of "county seat" for the panhandle until all of the northwest Texas counties were formed and organized.  Several preserved and due-to-be-preserved buildings remain as part of the town's original makeup, including the town Jail, which is now a Museum.</see>
