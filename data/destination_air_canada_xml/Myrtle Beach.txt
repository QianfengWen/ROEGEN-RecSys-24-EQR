[[Image:Myrtle_beach1.jpg‎‎‎ |thumb|Myrtle Beach's sandy shore.]] 
While the area itself may be referred to as "The Grand Strand", this term is not simply limited to the city of Myrtle Beach. Several smaller towns to the north and south (Briarcliffe, Atlantic Beach, North Myrtle Beach, Surfside Beach, Murrel's Inlet, Pawley's Island, and Garden City) in addition to Myrtle Beach make up what is known ''en masse'' as the "Grand Strand".

Myrtle Beach is also heavily developed and crowded, in contrast to other Southern beaches, such as the [[Outer Banks]] in [[North Carolina]]. Myrtle Beach tends to be a favored tourist spot for families. The development of new roads including Highway 22 and Highway 31 have helped tremendously in the way of congestion.  It has also opened up avenues for tourists to visit the undeveloped beaches of '''Huntington Beach State Park [http://www.huntingtonbeachsc.org]'''.

==Get in==
=== By plane===
'''Myrtle Beach International Airport''' ({{IATA|MYR}}), 1100 Jetport Road, [http://www.flymyrtlebeach.com/]. Myrtle Beach International is a work in progress as expansion and budget approvals are pending in both the city and county councils.  Most guests arriving from either the west coast or overseas fly into a major hub, such as [[Atlanta]], before connecting to their final destination in Myrtle Beach. More carriers are offering non-stop flights to Myrtle Beach, providing fast and affordable travel to and from dozens of cities [https://www.visitmyrtlebeach.com/plan/maps-transportation/flights-to-myrtle-beach/]

The busiest routes from MYR are to [[Atlanta]] (Delta) and [[Charlotte]] (US Airways), with several flights each day. Spirit Airlines offers regular flights to [[New York City|New York]] (LaGuardia). American Airlines and United each have one daily flight to their hubs in [[Dallas]] and [[Newark (New Jersey)|Newark]] respectively.

'''Grand Strand Regional Airport''' in North Myrtle Beach also serves the area and is used mostly by private or chartered flights.

===By car===
From Interstate 95 South, take US 501 South for 66 miles.

The Grand Strand's network of roads has vastly improved. One way to get in is the 28-mile Veterans Highway, a four-lane road that links U.S. 501 west of Conway and U.S. 17 north of Myrtle Beach. 

Another is the Carolina Bays Parkway which runs from S.C. 9 to U.S. 544 (this will eventually extend to U.S. 17 Bypass). This is a six-lane scenic highway near Myrtle Beach Raceway.

Harrelson Boulevard is a new access road to Myrtle Beach International Airport from U.S 17 Bypass.

Robert M. Grissom Parkway runs parallel to U.S. 17 Bypass and provides a passageway through central Myrtle Beach. This is a four-lane route from 62nd Avenue North in Myrtle Beach to Harrelson Boulevard near the Myrtle Beach International Airport.

===By train===
There is no direct rail service to Myrtle Beach. The closest passenger stations are in [[Dillon]], [[North Charleston]], [[Florence (South Carolina)|Florence]] and [[Kingstree]], which are served by Amtrak's ''Silver Service'' and ''Palmetto'' trains.

Florence, SC is the closest station but it is located approximately seventy miles away from Myrtle Beach, so the best option is to pre-arrange a limousine, or a shuttle or bus service for the final hour or two ride to the beach.

==Get around==
=== By car ===
If you must drive, plan ahead - if you are going a short distance (under five miles), then take one of the main roads that runs adjacent to the beach. If you are going a longer distance, try and take one of the interstate roads that branches further out - these are generally clear of traffic, and thus are much more bearable than the city roads.

*'''The beach''' The namesake of Myrtle Beach is, of course, the beach. During the high season the beach can be crowded and parking scarce. Staying at a beachfront hotel or within walking distance can make for a more pleasant visit. For those on a budget, however, don't fret - the beach is still basically public. Never underestimate the beauty of the shoreline at sunrise, when the sands are basically abandoned, the temperature modest, and the seashells have yet to have been picked from the night before's wave crashes.

Myrtle Beach is home to over 120 golf courses and over 4 million rounds of golf have been played there, a world record.  According to the Myrtle Beach Golf Association (mbga.com), some of the most popular courses include the Barefoot Resort, the Dunes Golf and Beach Club, Ocean Ridge Plantation, Caledonia Golf and Fish Club, and the Tidewater Golf Course and Plantation.  The Barefoot Resort was ranked the number one golf course in Myrtle Beach in 2010 by golfdigest.com.  It features four world class courses- the Fazio, the Love, the Dye and the Norman.  The Barefoot Resort also offers dining, shopping, and lodging.
