{{pagebanner|Palm Springs Banner.jpg}}

[http://www.visitpalmsprings.com '''Palm Springs'''] is a resort city in the [[Desert (California)|desert]] region of [[Southern California]]. 

It became a destination during the 1950s and 1960s when Hollywood movie stars flocked there for nearby relaxation and vacations.  

Nowadays, the entire Palm Springs metro area is growing and offers entertainment for all ages, although the most common demographics still consists of retirees. Palm Springs offers indoor and outdoor activities. Known for its hiking, mid-century modern architecture, natural beauty, and sparkling pools, Palm Springs has the perfect blend of outdoor activities and casual relaxation. Rain is rare, so the weather is often very dry. Palm Springs has a high percentage of gay residents and is a favorite for gay travelers, and also [[naturism|naturist]] communities. 

==Understand==

===Climate===
Palm Springs has an arid climate. Summers are very hot! Summer routinely sees daytime temperatures in the 100s °F, sometimes up to 115°F. Summer nights are still hot with temperatures dropping to the 80s or 90s °F. Winter and spring are much more enjoyable, with daytime temperatures ranging from 60°F in winter to 80°F in spring. Nights are cold during this time.

==Get in==

===By plane===
*[http://www.palmspringsairport.com '''Palm Springs International Airport'''] ({{IATA|PSP}}). Located right in the heart of Palm Springs. Scheduled daily flight connections with many cities, especially western US cities. The airport is served by all major US airlines either with nonstop flights or with connections. Palm Springs International Airport is also popular for general aviation and business jet travelers. Air taxi and aircraft charter companies such as [http://www.airroyale.com '''Air Royale International'''], [http://www.jscharter.com '''Jetset Charter'''], [http://monarchairgroup.com '''Monarch Air Group'''] and [http://www.desertjet.com '''Desert Jet'''] provide private aircraft charter services from this airport.

*[http://www.lawa.org/ont/ '''LA/Ontario International Airport''' ] in [[Ontario (California) | Ontario]], about 70 miles to the west of Palm Springs, has many more flight connections and is the next closest large commercial airport. This airport is served by Southwest Airlines.

===By train===

*'''Amtrak Station''', 300 North Indian Canyon Drive (''.6 mi south of Interstate 10''), 1-800-USA-RAIL (872-7245), [http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer?c=am2Station&pagename=am%2Fam2Station%2FStation_Page&p=1237405732508&cid=1229726270390]. Amtrak's Sunset Limited route connects Palm Springs with Los Angeles and with Arizona and points eastward with three westbound and three eastbound trains per week. Eastbound trains arrive at 12:36am on Mondays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, and westbound trains at 2:02am on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays at the rail station, which is about 3-4 miles north of town, in the middle of the desert. Be aware that there are no rental car agencies that provide shuttles to the Amtrak station in Palm Springs and there is no public transportation available there.  The "station" is really just an open platform (though well-maintained) with a plain shelter, no amenities or services available.  Taxis from the Palm Springs Amtrak to the Palm Springs airport (where the rental cars are available) cost about $30 (2008).

Amtrak also provides Palm Springs with connections to and from the Pacific Surfliner and Metrolink trains at Fullerton, with 1 roundtrip terminating at Palm Springs, and one more continuing on to Indio. Amtrak also operates connecting buses to the San Joaquins trains, which run up California's Central Valley to the Bay Area and Sacramento, via multiple daily Amtrak Thruway motorcoach runs to and from Bakersfield, 2 round-trips of which go to Palm Springs and Indio.

These Amtrak Thruway bus services have stops at both Downtown Palm Springs (100 Indian Canyon) and at the Palm Springs Int'l Airport. They do not stop at the rail depot.

===By car===

From [[Los Angeles]], take Interstate 10 east towards [[Phoenix]], then take the exits for Highway 111 or Indian Canyon Drive. Palm Springs is about a two hour drive from most Southern California destinations if there is not much traffic.

When you see the exit for Highway 111, note the sign for through traffic on Interstate 10 for "Indio" and "other Desert Cities [''sic'']" (a rather bizarre way to refer to the rest of the Coachella Valley as well as [[Phoenix]]).  This sign is a well-known local landmark in its own right.

==Get around==

Palm Springs has a pedestrian friendly downtown. Visitors can enjoy the palm tree lined streets along Palm Canyon Drive and Indian Canyon Drive. Many boutique shops, outdoor restaurant and art galleries line the streets. 

===By car===
Rent a car at the airport, or if you want to splurge, numerous limousine services are available, including West Coast Transportation, Cardiff Limousine and A-1 Sahara Limo.
The main drags are Highway 111 and S. Palm Canyon Drive.  Highway 111 runs east-west along the mountain side and connects all the cities in the Palm Springs area.  This road has lights and lots of traffic, so if you are going far, you should drive out and hop on Interstate 10. S. Palm Drive is always busy and is hard to find a parking place on the weekends and at night. You should try to park on one of the side roads if possible. Most of the major car rental companies are represented at the airport.
