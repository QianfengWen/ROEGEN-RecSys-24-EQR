'''Matsuyama''' (松山) [http://www.city.matsuyama.ehime.jp/lang/en], meaning "pine mountain", is the homely capital of [[Ehime]] prefecture.

Quite provincial yet hospitable to travelers, and a hub of business and shopping amongst the lazy calm of the countryside, Matsuyama has much to offer in the way of curious literary and cultural assets. 

==Understand==

With a population of 515,000, Matsuyama is the largest city on Shikoku, though still noticeably sleepier than cities of comparable size on the Japanese mainland. The city is situated in a river basin formed by the flow of the '''Ishite''' and Shigenobu rivers, and nestled between the '''Ishizuchi''' mountain range to the south and Takanawa Mountains to the north. The center of town is '''Matsuyama-shi Station''' (松山市駅, "'''Shieki'''" for short), south of of Matsuyama Castle, which serves as a hub for local trams, buses, and the private Iyotetsu train line. JR Matsuyama Station is a short walk west.

The climate of Matsuyama is overall mild and temperate &mdash; somewhat balmy in summer, with most rainfall occurring in late spring, and almost no snow in winter. However, the city's star attraction &mdash; '''Dōgo Onsen''' (道後温泉) &mdash; is a good time in any season, drawing serious hot spring enthusiasts and newcomers alike to its steamy waters. This public bathhouse is thought to be the oldest in Japan, a claim reinforced by its mention in the second oldest book of Japanese history, ''Nihon Shoki'' (720 AD).

But Dōgo and its surroundings are better known for their place in another classic Japanese book, ''Botchan'' (1906). Renowned novelist '''Natsume Sōseki''' (夏目漱石) wrote ''Botchan'' while living and working in Matsuyama as a teacher. Although the area does not come off well in the [[Tokyo|Edo]]-phile's description, the town nevertheless celebrates the connection with a variety of events and displays. 

Sōseki’s friend and mentor, '''Masaoka Shiki''' (正岡子規), was a native of Matsuyama and one of the four great masters of haiku. Born to a lower class samurai family, Shiki had a modest childhood. Thanks to his education and an uncle in public office, Shiki was able to enter Tokyo Imperial University to study philosophy and politics, and later became a journalist covering the Russo-Japanese War. His literary career began when he started criticizing the Edo period's iconic haiku artist Matsuo Bashō and praising '''Yosa Buson''', whose work he felt was brief yet refined. Shiki is credited with revitalizing Japanese poetry and modernizing its themes, thus making the short verse once again relevant to modern Japanese culture.

Matsuyama's bastions of literary pride span centuries, and many of the city's attractions celebrate that heritage with unabashed cheer. In the words of one native, referring the character from ''Botchan'' (not the pop star): "We don't have geisha &mdash; we have Madonna!"

==Get in==

===By plane===

<listing name="Matsuyama Airport (MYJ)" phone="+81 089-972-5600" url="http://www.matsuyama-airport.co.jp/"> Nonstop service from major airports such as [[Tokyo]] Haneda, [[Nagoya]] Komaki, [[Osaka]] Itami and [[Fukuoka]], as well as from [[Okinawa]]. There are also direct flights to and from [[Seoul]] and [[Shanghai]]. The Limousine Bus connects the airport to Dōgo Onsen, running at 20 minute intervals (&yen;450) via JR Matsuyama Sta (&yen;300).</listing>

===By train===
Matsuyama is on the JR Yosan Line. From the mainland, take the San'yo Shinkansen to [[Okayama]], and transfer to the ''Shiokaze'' Limited Express, which will get you to Matsuyama in about three hours (&yen;6630). 

The ''Ishizuchi'' Limited Express connects Matsuyama with [[Takamatsu]] on the eastern end of Shikoku (2 1/2 hours, &yen;6010). The ''Uwakai'' and a few other limited express services run to [[Uwajima]] (75 minutes, &yen;3410). (Many limited express trains in Shikoku combine or divide with others at certain stations, so be sure you're in the correct part of the train.)

The ''Sunrise Seto'' overnight train from Tokyo departs at 10PM. It goes to Sakaide (坂出) station, the first stop after crossing the long Seto-Ohashi bridge, and the station before Takamatsu. After a 40-minute wait (during which you can get a bite to eat), take the ''Ishizuchi'' limited express to Matsuyama, arriving at 10AM. The ''Sunrise Seto'' is one of the few overnight trains in Japan with a shower on board. You can use the shower for a small fee, or for no charge, depending on your accommodation type. But if you don't like being limited to six minutes of water, just plan an early visit to Dōgo Onsen! Note that during holiday periods, the ''Sunrise Seto'' runs directly to Matsuyama after reversing direction at Takamatsu.

If you have a Japan Rail Pass, all travel on JR trains is covered except for room accomodations on the ''Sunrise Seto''. If you are traveling a long distance to reach Matsuyama, you can choose to simply split up your journey, stopping at an intermediate destination en-route in order to sleep somewhere. For example, on a trip from Tokyo to Matsuyama you could leave Tokyo in the evening on the Shinkansen and make your way to Osaka or Himeji to spend the night. The next morning you can continue to Okayama to connect to the ''Shiokaze'' train.

===By bus===

Highway buses connect Matsuyama with the rest of Shikoku, as well as with other major cities in Japan. The following buses are operated by '''JR Shikoku Bus''' [http://www.jr-shikoku.co.jp/bus] (Japanese website) and affiliated JR bus companies.

Within Shikoku, the '''Botchan Express''' bus runs multiple times per day from [[Takamatsu]] (2 3/4 hours, &yen;3900), while the '''Nangoku Express''' offers six daily round-trips from [[Kochi (Shikoku)|Kochi]] (2 3/4 hours, &yen;3500) and the '''Yoshinogawa Express''' offers service to/from [[Tokushima, Tokushima|Tokushima]] (3 1/4 hours, &yen;4300).

The interestingly-named '''Madonna Express''' bus service runs six daily round-trips between Matsuyama and [[Okayama]] (3 hours, &yen;4300).

From [[Osaka]] and [[Kobe]], service is offered on the '''Matsuyama Express Osaka''' bus. Eight daily round-trip buses during the day from Osaka and Sannomiya Bus Terminal (5 3/4 hours from Osaka, &yen;6700). One round-trip bus runs overnight, starting from Kyoto station (8 1/4 hours, &yen;7000) and stopping at Osaka and Sannomiya along the way.

The '''Olive Matsuyama''' bus service operates overnight between [[Nagoya]] and Matsuyama, via Tokushima and Takamatsu (10 1/4 hours, &yen;10,000).

Overnight buses are offered from [[Tokyo]] on the '''Dream Takamatsu-Matsuyama''' service (10 1/4 hours, &yen;12,000; &yen;14,300 for Premium Seats).

'''Iyo Tetsu Bus''' operates similar services in competition with those listed above, at similar prices. It should be noted, though, that Iyo Tetsu's overnight services make pickup and dropoff stops directly at '''Dogo Onsen''' (see below). Both Iyo and JR buses make stops at the Okaido arcade, from which Dogo Onsen is a short, convenient journey by tram.

Iyo Tetsu Bus also offers an overnight bus to Matsuyama from [[Fukuoka]] and [[Kitakyushu]] (10 hours from Fukuoka, &yen;8000).

'''Willer Express''' [http://willerexpress.com/en] operates buses from Matsuyama to Kobe, Osaka and Tokyo. Online bookings are available in English.

===By ferry===

Ferry services connect Matsuyama with various locations on [[Honshu]] and [[Kyushu]]. Ferries depart from '''Matsuyama Kankoko''' (松山観光港) [http://www.kankoko.com/contents/timetable.html]. To reach the terminal from JR Matsuyama Station, take the Iyotetsu Limousine Bus which leaves every hour (20 minutes, &yen;450). The bus also runs from the Dogo Onsen tram station (40 minutes, &yen;600). Alternatively, take the tram to Takahama station, which is a 15 minute walk or 5 minute bus ride from the ferry terminal.

*'''Ishizaki Ferry''' and '''Setonaikai Kisen''' [http://www.setonaikaikisen.co.jp/english/index.html] operate daily to and from [[Hiroshima]], with some boats stopping in Kure (呉). The ''Superjet'' Hydrofoil service departs from Matsuyama every hour, on the hour, from 7 AM to 6 PM, then at 7:30 PM and 9 PM. The ride takes 70-80 minutes to reach Hiroshima and costs &yen;6900 each way. Slower ferries depart on different schedules between 6:25 AM and 7:50 PM (10 per day), reaching Hiroshima in about 2 1/2 hours at a cost of only &yen;3500 each way.

*[http://www.matsuyama-kokuraferry.co.jp/sp/index.html Matsuyama Kokura Ferry Co.] runs an overnight service to Kokura in [[Kitakyushu]], leaving at 9:55 PM and arriving at 5 AM the next day.

==Get around==
If you plan on staying for an extended period of time (or believe you will spend more than &yen;2000 on transportation), you may want to buy an I~C Card at Shieki, which gives 10% discounts on all Iyotetsu transportation (including taxis).

Traveling on foot is an entirely viable way of getting around downtown at a comfortable pace.

===By tram===
Trams (streetcars) have a flat fare, &yen;160 per trip (or &yen;80 for children). A one-day pass costs &yen;400. 

You can also tour a few Botchan sites on the '''Botchan Ressha''', which is a recreation of the old steam-powered trams (though the modern version runs on diesel).

===By bus=== 
'''Iyotetsu''' (伊予鉄) [http://www.iyotetsu.co.jp/bus/busmap/english] city buses connect all corners of Matsuyama (except for the island, '''Nakajima'''), from the ferry port in the west to Kume in the east, and from '''Hōjō''' in the north to '''Tobe''' in the south. The hub is the aforementioned Shieki. Timetables are not in English, but if you can pronounce the destination, the driver will help you get there. Fares start at &yen;150. Enter buses in the rear and take a slip of paper. If you need to change a yen note, insert it into the machine at the front of the bus to receive change. When you are ready to disembark, go to the front, check the amount due on the above chart and drop the money into the slot. 

Buses run once an hour from the Takahama Ferry Port to ''Dōgo Onsen Eki''. There is also an East-West Loop bus which connects all vital areas and whose fare is &yen;150.

While having read Sōseki's novels or Shiki's haiku is by no means essential to enjoy most of these sites, it will probably represent the difference between whether you find them evocative pieces of history or just a pleasant collection of Meiji-era buildings.

* <see name="Akiyama Brothers Birthplace" alt="秋山兄弟生誕地 Akiyama Kyōdai Seitanchi" address="2-3-6 Kachimachi" phone="+81 089-943-2747" hours="Tu-Su 10AM-5PM, closed 12/28-01/03" price="&yen;200" url="http://www.akiyama-kyodai.gr.jp/"> Born to a lower class branch of the Matsuyama samurai clan, these two brothers became military heroes of Japan. '''Yoshifuru''', the eldest, is credited as the father of the Japanese cavalry, while '''Saneyuki''' excelled in naval tactics. Yoshifuru traveled to France to study cavalry techniques in 1887. After serving in the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) he established a cavalry division which debuted in the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905). After holding numerous posts of prestige, he was promoted to General in 1916 and finally retired to become a junior high school principal in Matsuyama. A childhood friend of Shiki, Saneyuki shared his friend's love of the written word, and the two studied literature at Tokyo University. However, at the behest of his brother, Saneyuki embarked on a military career. He was sent to America to study naval tactics, and had on-the-job training during the Spanish-American War (1898). After returning to Japan, he became the foremost strategist of the Russo-Japanese War, leading to a major victory on Tsushima.</see>

After having lived and studied in France, Hisamatsu became enamored with the romantic architectural style, and hired '''Kigo Shichirō''' (木子七郎) to build his villa. This Taishō Era estate was the venue of many parties for the elite in its heyday, and the Emperor himself made it a point to visit whenever he was in the area. Currently, it is used as the Museum of Art's annex. The first floor's gallery changes throughout the year and is free, while the collection on the second floor showcases ink paintings by Shiki, Sōseki, and other Ehime residents.</see>

An oval shaped patch of green in the overdeveloped Dōgo neighborhood, ''Dōgo Kōen'' is an important part of Matsuyama's identity because it harbors the ruins of Yuzuki Castle. '''Yuzuki-jō''' was the residence of the '''Kōno Clan''' (河野), who ruled Iyo Province (伊予, now Ehime) from the 13th to the late 16th century, when war lord '''Toyotomi Hideyoshi''' (豊臣秀吉) sent an army to Shikoku to conquer and unify Japan. The excavation of the 30,000 square meter site took over 14 years, but the castle, gardens, and residences were all recovered. Within the recreated homes, mannequins silently act out the daily lives of the elite during that time, drinking tea and writing ''renga'' (poems composed by a group). There is also a library and a volunteer English-speaking guide can show visitors around with advance reservations.</see>

It was promised by the lord of Matsuyama Castle, '''Matsudaira Sadanaga''' (松平定長), if the gods awarded him victory in the 1667 Edo Castle Yabusame (horseback archery) competition. The outer walls are modeled after the Iwashimizu Hachiman Shrine in Kyoto, while the inner sanctum (the oldest part of the shrine) is designed in various Shinto styles of the 17th century. Memorials honoring the warlords who fought against the Kamakura battalion are guarded by stalwart dogs who watch over the four deities adorning the four corners of the vermilion structure. There are exhibitions of feudal era armor (including Matsudaira's helmet) and swords (''Tachi Mei'', a mid-Kamakura era piece crafted by the famous ''Kuniyuki Rai'').</see>

Recently restored to its former beauty, when the ''fujidana'' wisteria are in bloom, ''Kōshinan Shiseki Teien'' is truly a sight to behold. It is free to tour, but reserving the rooms is also possible.</see>

It was constructed by the feudal lord '''Katō Yoshiaki''' (加藤嘉明) over the course of 25 years, completed in 1627. Four of its eight strategic gates are designated national cultural treasures, and with the wealth of historical artifacts within its majestic walls &mdash; swords and armor belonging to the three occupying families, calligraphy and official documents from the feudal era (English available) &mdash; ''Matsuyama-jō'' is well worth the hike. The castle is accessible by hiking a wooded trail, but the ropeway (&yen;500 roundtrip) can be boarded at the east entrance.</see>

Founded in 728 and part of the Shingon Sect of Buddhism, Ishiteji embodies one of the most moving of Buddhist legends of greed, sorrow, repentance, and reincarnation.

* <do name="Dōgo Onsen Honkan" alt="道後温泉本館" address="5-6 Yunomachi, Dōgo" directions="" phone="+81 089-943-8342" email="" fax="" url="http://www.dogo.or.jp/" hours="" price="" lat="33.852098" long="132.786427">Grab your towel and go bathing! Dōgo Onsen is the oldest and most famous ''onsen'' in Japan, with a history stretching back over 3,000 years. Quite a few legends surround these waters. One says that the springs of Dōgo were discovered when, during the age of the gods, a heron placed his injured leg into hot water streaming out of a rock and was miraculously healed. Another claims that when an ill god bathed in the hot spring, the god recovered and danced for joy. The heron motif is everywhere inside the building. ''Tama no ishi'' or ''Yudama'', the round rock from which the healing waters sprang, is the source of the symbol for Dōgo, though it looks more like a chestnut to some.

According to legend, '''Prince Shotoku''' (574-622) used to partake of the waters, and in 1899, the annex ''Yushinden'', was built so that the Imperial Family could enjoy Dōgo in privacy. The last time the Emperor visited Dōgo was in the 1970s, but the curious can peek into the rooms (15 minute tour without bathing: &yen;250 adults, &yen;120 children.) There is also an exhibition room that features artifacts from the various stages of Dōgo's history. 

There are two types of baths in the ''honkan'' for both men and women.</do>

No two pools have the same concoction (sulfur, alkaline, etc.) or style, which makes pool-hopping fun.

{{infobox|Hime Daruma and Hime Temari|Two stories explain the origins of these cheerful artifacts. One says that when Emperor Ojin visited Dōgo Onsen he was inspired by the memory of his mother's pregnancy, and decided to craft an object to give expecting mothers good luck. The other says that after being left fatherless by the Mongolian Invasion (1274-1281) and devoting the rest of her life to caring for her late patriarch's grave, the face of one of the daughters of the Kōno clan, Hime, was drawn over that of a Bodhidharma ''toyōka daruma'' (Bodhidharma being the founder of Zen Buddhism). In Japan, a bride brings a ''temari'', which is a technicolor string ball, to the groom's house as a sign of "amicable settlement", but it is more commonly exchanged during New Year's.}}
A stroll around Dōgo Onsen, particularly the Yunomachi shopping corridor, will turn up plenty of tourist-oriented souvenir shops. Look for '''Iyo Kasuri cloth''', which was traditionally woven with thread-dyed indigo, but is now made in many vibrant hues and is used for clothing, toys and accessories. (''Kasuri'' means "splashed pattern".) Another item of note is '''Tobe pottery''', which boasts a history of over 220 years. Designated a National Traditional Craft, it's valued for its thickness and simplicity, and the sensual contrast of the indigo against pristine white ceramic ware. Shops in Yunomachi sell Tobeyaki, but Tobe the town is not far from Matsuyama if you'd prefer to go to the source.

The '''Gintengai Arcade''', just east of Shieki, is the place to look for more contemporary and eclectic items.

Matsuyama is a great place to indulge a sweet tooth. '''Botchan dango''' (坊ちゃん団子) headline every sweet shop in town. They're skewered rice dumplings covered in bean paste dyed with green tea, eggs, and ''azuki'' beans. This soft, sweet snack was popularized by Sōseki, who had such a weakness for them that he included the treats in ''Botchan''. Another local favorite are the cute little '''tarts''' (タルト). Originally derived from [[Nagasaki]]'s Castella cake in the 1600s, the Matsuyama variety replaces jam with ''azuki'' bean paste, and rolls up the cake.

For a healthier sweet, '''mikan''' (みかん) (citrus fruits) come in a multitude of species, including ''iyokan'' (grapefruit-like) and ''dekopon'' (huge, orange and puckered). ''Mikan'' are mainly harvested in the fall and are very cheap, but they're so treasured that they are used as offerings to ancestral spirits.

Though more spacious than its previous grounds and the silhouette animal footprints leading to the entrance are endearing, the zoo may leave much to be desired for those not used to Japanese zoological standards.</see>
