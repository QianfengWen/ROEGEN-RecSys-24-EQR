[[image:Palace_tripura.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Ujjainti Palace at Agartala]]
Agartala lies on the bank of Haora River and shares its western border with [[Bangladesh]]. Unlike the other six capitals of north-eastern states, which are predominantly hilly, Agartala lies on the western end of the great Ganga-Brahmaputra plain of Bangladesh and shares much of its culture, language and cuisine as well with this neighboring nation. Agartala is famous for its temples, palaces, and rich history of the Manikya kings and its connection to Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore. Agartala is also noted for its bamboo handicrafts, and local hand-woven shawls and textiles. Its close proximity to other places of interest in Tripura (25km from Sipahijala, 55km from Udaipur, 50km from Neer Mahal, 178km from Unakoti) makes Agartala a suitable base for exploring rest of the state.

==Get in==
===By Plane===
Agartala Airport (IATA: IXA) is 12km northwest of the city in Singerbhil. It is served by most of the major airlines of India from [[Delhi]], [[Mumbai]], [[Bangalore]], [[Ahmedabad]], [[Chennai]] & nearly all other major airports in the country via [[Kolkata]] or [[Guwahati]].  There are several non-stop flights everyday from Kolkata and  Guwahati. Typical airfare for these flights varies from Rs. 1800 (USD 35) to Rs. 3500 (USD 70), but can be much higher during peak travel seasons (Durga Puja in October/November, Christmas and New Year) unless tickets are booked several months in advance.
 
To travel from the airport to the city: 
Taxis and auto-rickshaws are available outside the airport. The drivers flock around the arrival gate and are mostly reliable. Expect to pay around Rs. 150 (USD 3) for an auto-rickshaw and Rs. 300 (USD 6) for a taxi, but it is better to negotiate a price before boarding the vehicle. The drive to city takes approximately 20 minutes. 

Most of the hotels also have pickup services. Contact your hotel in advance to make an arrangement for you. Although  public transports (buses and shared auto-rickshaws) are available just outside the airport gate, they are typically very crowded and not advisable for first time travellers.

===By Train===
Agartala can be reached directly by train from [[Silchar]] and Lumding in Assam. From [[Guwahati]] one have to come to Lumding by B.G. train, then from Lumding there is an Overnight Express train for Agartala. Tickets can be booked online from the Indian railways website [http://www.irctc.co.in] or from any computerized railway reservation counter in India.

Agartala railway station is located a few kilometers south of the city center. It is modeled after the Ujjayanta Palace. The beautiful and grand architecture makes it a place worth visiting. One can hire an autorickshaw or a taxi from the station to travel to any part of the city.

===By Bus===
Agartala can be reached directly by bus from [[Guwahati]], [[Shillong]] and [[Silchar]]. The escort facility in the norther part of [[Tripura]] has been lifted recently as a result of the decrease in dominance of the insurgent groups.

The Akhaura Checkpost also connects Agartala to [[Dhaka]], the capital of the neighbouring country of [[Bangladesh]]. This route extends to [[Kolkata]] in [[West Bengal]].

==Get around==
Paddle Rickshaws are the principle mode of travel within the city limits. The fare may range from Rs 5/- to Rs25/-.

Auto Rickshaws plying in specified routes are also available. Tough designated stands are at Motorstand, Nagerjala, Abhoynagar, Old RMS etc. All you need to do to catch an "auto" (locally known as "Tempu") is to stand in the route and be watchful. Unlike many other Indian cities, in Agartala auto rickshaws have an authorised sitting capacity of 4 persons at the rear and passengers are comfortable squeezing in by little adjustment. Moreover, you may face problem if you do not carry much coins of Rs. 1,2 & 5 which are very much necessary for travelling in Agartala as well as Tripura. 

Recently, government city buses have started plying throughout the city and its sub-urban areas. The fare range is from Rs 5/- to Rs 10/- but the only problem is that the frequency is low. They currently ply in 7 routes covering the whole city.

Auto-rickshaws are available for to and fro travel to Airport.

Local buses are available for long routes.

For a day's trip to Kamalasagar, Sipahijala, Udaipur, Neermahal etc. a cab can be hired from Battala syndicate.
