'''Mangalore''' is a port city and the headquarters of [[Dakshina Kannada]] district in the [[Coastal Karnataka|coastal]] region of [[Karnataka]] State in [[India]].It is around 295 kms from the state Capital '''[[Bangalore]]'''.  Mangalore is now officially known as '''Mangaluru''' .

==Understand==
[[Image:Ullal Beach.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A panoramic view of Someshwar Beach]]
Mangalore is the gateway to [[Karnataka]]. It is the district head quarters for Bantwal, Puttur, Sullia and Belthangady taluks of the Dakshina Kannada District. This District formerly had 8 talukas, but these were split, for the ease of administration in August 1997 and the remaining talukas, namely [[Udupi]], [[Kundapur]] and [[Karkala]] then formed a part of the [[Udupi]] district,but there is no division found in the living of two cities and it is still being recognised as 'avibhagitha (undivided) Dakshina Kannada. 

Mangalore is named after the goddess Mangaladevi. Other names used by the locals are 'Kudla' (Tulu), 'Mangalooru' (Kannada), 'Mangalapuram' (Malayalam),'Kodeyaala' ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havyaka "Havyaka"]),  'Kodial' (Konkani), 'Maikala' (Beary) and 'Manjarun'(sanskrith).

Traditionally, it was an important trading port with ties with the Persian Gulf states dating back to the 14th century. With its strategic location, it was occupied by a number of dynasties and colonial rulers, namely the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] in the mid-16th century. In the 18th century, its control was contested by Haidar Ali and Tipu Sultan on one hand and the British on the other. Under the [[Mysore]] sultans (1763), it became a strategic ship building base, which was ceded to the British in 1799 after numerous sieges.

Mangalore is one of the fastest developing cities in India. Many multinational corporations and domestic corporations are opening their branches in Mangalore. Many reputed builders are bringing huge development projects. There is very good growth in the retail sector and many new shopping malls are being built. Infosys Technologies has 2 Development Centers in Mangalore with over 3000 employees. MphasiS has their India Training Center based near Mangalore Club. Corporation Bank and Karnataka Bank have their headquarters inside the city and Syndicate Bank HQ is in Manipal. Other industries are MRPL, MCF, BASF, KIOCL, Ultratech Cement Plant are some of the other industries in the city. 

Mangalore is also known as the 'Cradle of Education' in Karnataka with 16 Engineering(Nitk,surathkal being the rank 1 engineering college and MIT(manipal) being second), 6 Medical, 3 Dental, 12 MBA, 11 Physiotherapy, 8 Hotel Management and 58 Graduation colleges in and around the city. 

Mangalore is a blend of the new and the old. With the increasing influx of students from various states of India and different parts of the world, Mangalore has virtually become a 'melting pot' of cultures, given the various communities that make up the social framework of Mangalore: the Tuluvas (Bunts, Billawas, Mogaveeras, Kulals,Shivalli Brahmins,Jains,Devadigas,Chitpavan's), the Brahmins, the Konkani Catholics, the Bearys, the Goud-Saraswath Brahmins (Konkanas),Devang's(m'lore kannada and tulu) etc.

==Talk==
The number of languages spoken around here reflects the cultural diversity of Mangalore; '''Tulu''' (the most popular and most widely spoken language here, with a slight variation spoken by the Brahmin community), '''Kannada''' (the official state language), '''Konkani''' (two different versions exist: the one spoken by the Konkani Catholics and another spoken by the Konkanas or the Goud-Saraswaths). '''Beary''' is too spoken by Muslims. '''Haveeka''' is spoken by havyaka brahmins. English is also widely spoken, so communication shouldn't be much of a problem.

==Get in==

===By bus===

There are two bus-stands in Mangalore for long-distance bus services.
 
* One is the state-run KSRTC bus-stand in ''Bejai'', located towards the North of the city, but not far off from the city centre. The bus-services are run by the [www.ksrtc.in Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation]. They operate scheduled bus services to [[Mumbai]], [[Bangalore]], [[Mysore]], [[Goa]], Hubli-Dharwad and many other areas within and outside Karnataka. Services run by the Kerala State Transport and Tamil Nadu State Transport and Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation also call in Mangalore at this very bus-stand. 
 
* The other one is behind the ''Town Hall''. It is known as the 'State Bank' stand by the locals, because of its proximity to a branch of the State Bank of India. It is the last stop for most of the private bus services to Mangalore (mostly Inter-District viz. Mangalore-Udupi and Inter-taluk buses).

* There is a third bus-stand (not exactly a bus-stand but an alighting point for passengers) in front of Milagres Church where most private tour and bus operators: Lobo Travels, Ideal Travels, Canara, Canara-Pinto, Vishal Travels, Anand Travels, VRL etc. have their offices. They operate buses of semi-deluxe, sleeper and Volvo types to various destinations viz. Mumbai, Bangalore, Goa, Thrissur, Hubli-Dharwad etc.

* Various other pick-up points and drop points are there in Mangalore city according to your convenience! 

There are numerous bus services from Mangalore to all the nearby towns in Karnataka and Kerala. The long-distance bus services to major cities like Bangalore, Mumbai, Hubli-Dharwad and Goa run along the National Highways radiating to the North (towards Goa and Mumbai)  NH-17, South (towards Kerala) and the East (towards Bangalore)  NH-48.

===By car===

Mangalore is well connected to [[Goa]], [[Mumbai]], and [[Kerala]] via NH-17, to the state capital [[Bangalore]] via NH-48, and to [[Hyderabad]] via NH-13. Highways are only two-laned and very narrow, but make for extremely scenic drives as they all pass either through the Western Ghats or along the coastline. There is a lot of heavy traffic load on the highways owing to the increasing number of buses plying on these routes, as well as a lot of goods-transport trucks owing to the location of many plants and factories as well as New Mangalore Port on NH-17. So exercise caution while driving during periods of heavy traffic. 

NH-48 from Sakleshpur to Mangalore, which had been completely unmotorable thanks to government apathy, is now repaired and somewhat motorable.  Work is going on to convert NH-48 into a four-lane highway. Until they do this, one needs to go to Mangalore from Bangalore either through the potentially dangerous Charmadi Ghat road, or via the equally pathetic [[Mysore]]-[[Madikeri]]-Suliya route.

There are many car rental companies available.

==Get around==

===By bus===

There are numerous private bus companies which run bus services within the city of Mangalore and its suburbs. They have names like Padmambika Bus Co. Ltd. emblazoned in large letters in English on the front windscreen of the bus and on its sides. These buses also connect to all the minor urban centres surrounding Mangalore. Most of them originate from the Central Bus Stand at Mangalore behind the Town Hall: the 'State Bank' bus-stand.

Even though the buses are operated by different private companies, the bus numbering scheme is unified and quite useful. The destinations and routes are, however, all written in Kannada. The best way to use these buses is to ask around and the people are most helpful. If you are armed with a city map, one can get the hang of things within a day or so. The minimum bus fare is ₹5
If you are a student then you can avail concession on bus fares,that is, you just have to pay half the bus fare.
In addition city bus service, there is limited stop (usually called express) bus service (the majority of these are run by various private bus companies) for inter-town/city travelling to neighbouring places. You may find these useful to visit places like Udupi, Manipal, Kaup, Venur, Moodabidri, Karkala, Subramanya, Dharmasthala, Kateel  etc.  Bus fare ranges between ₹45 to ₹65 for a distance up to 65 km.

===By cab===

White Ambassador Cabs/Indicas are available: usually used by passengers on long-haul routes. Shared cabs are also available for travel between the city and other talukas viz. Bantwal (BC Road), etc. 
Prepaid cabs are available from the airport to the city: this is generally at a flat rate of ₹350-400.

<p>You can also call Cel Cabs and they will pick you up in 20 minutes from wherever you are. You can hold it for a day or a few hours. You can reach them on 60609090.</p>

Car-Rent facilities are also available in Mangalore.

===By autorickshaws===

They are available all throughout Mangalore City, the starting fare is ₹25. Pre-paid autos were available from the City Railway Station and the KSRTC bus stand at Bejai, but not any more. Autos also ply to far-off destinations, the outskirts, for one-and-a-half times the actual fare; this is roughly around ₹150, depending on the amount of money you have to spare, although one would prefer using buses to reach these areas as a cheaper mode of transport. The Private bus here are very good and well maintained - in fact the Mangalore-Udupi route bus have many amenities like TV & GPS. That said, Mangalore is one of the only few cities in India where the autorickshaw driver still uses the meter for all journeys. There is also an extra charge of 50% of your bill after 9pm.

(The Auto drivers will charge exorbitant rates if you do not haggle. If there is a problem with them, just search for a cop nearby. If the cop talks to them, the Auto drivers treat you fairly.)

===By Ride Share===

UberGo is available in Mangalore, as well as Ola Cabs. Both services require use of their smartphone apps. Rates are competitive with other metered cab services. Both services offer metered cabs, and UberGo has flat rate airport rides for ₹250.

===By Self-Drive Vehicles===
You can rent a car or a bike from many online and offline platforms to get around on your own. These vehicles can be rented on a per hour or per day basis and are quite affordable. You will require a valid driving license to use the car. Some platforms that provide this service are [http://drivezy.com/Mangaluru/ Drivezy] and [https://www.car4hires.com/Article/Self-Drive-Car-Hire-Mangalore.aspx#/searchcars Car 4 Hires].

===Udupi-style restaurants===

There are numerous small restaurants where one can gorge on cheap food as long as one likes South Indian food. The most typical ones are the Udupi-style restaurants which serve the staple fare of idli, wada and a variety of dosas. You can wash them down with some home-grown filter coffee or tea. 

One of the more famous Udupi-style restaurants is the '''Woodlands''' situated on Bunts Hostel Road which has preserved its old-world quaintness. The gentry of Mangalore drive into its courtyard and remain seated in their cars. Nimble-footed waiters with their white mundus hitched up scamper around to serve them their food which is eaten inside the cars.

The lunch menu in Woodlands is particularly tasty if you like typical South Indian food. Lunch includes two varieties of rice, normal rice and Boiled rice . The tiffin menu (evening) also is delicious with several choices.  The dinner menu is very plain and contains many repeat dishes.

This is a very rare food as it is banned in the city of Mangalore. However, there are quite a few restaurants serving beef.

Be aware that Mangalore is proud hindutva hub so eat beef at your own risk.

===Kerala cuisine===
Another category of small eateries is the Malayali joints. As Mangalore is adjacent to Kerala, it has a fair share of Malayalis who patronize these places.

A famous place to cite in this category would be Kairali Restaurant, near the Railway Station behind Milagres Church.

An array of mini fruit juice stalls dot every nook and cranny of Mangalore City; at bus stops, near shopping areas, etc. that serve the usual fare of juices and milkshakes. Name it and it's all there for you. But this is not recommended if your gut is not immune to such juices! Normal restaurants would definitely be a hygienic alternative! 

'''A must visit place i recommend''':''' Srinidhi Juice & Snacks''',Opp to Srinivasa Theater(Balaji),B.E.M High School Road,Carstreet, 50 Year old shop, Serves Fresh Fruit Juices, Fruit Chat, Lassi, Maggie, Pav Bhaji & other Snacks. 

'''Tendercoconut''' (Local language called Bonda / Shiyala )is available in plenty. Most vendors charge about ₹20 each.

Aerated cold drinks like Coke & Pepsi are also available, just as in any other part of the world. Try out the local varieties, such as 'Zaffa' or 'Joy' for taste. If you want to have hygienically flavored sugarcane juice, then you will find a joint in Bharath Mall. You will wonder how much technology has changed these days!

Another must visit place is the Temple Square (Car street). The juice shop to check out is the one located between School book company & an Ayurvedic medicine shop.This juice shop specialises in dishing out concoctions made up of locally grown berries.Famous flavours include "Nannari", "Jaljeera", "Hingastak", "Birinda", and the rest is up to you to explore.The juice shop perfectly complements the fried delicacies served at "Balli's podi" located right across the street. Its the best place to eat "podis" in Mangalore. The mouth watering hot hot podis are irresistible.

===Coffee Shops===
Well there's the usual Cafe Coffee Day with its main outlet at Balmatta and four others at Deralakatte bang opposite the A.B. Shetty Memorial Institute of Dental Sciences campus, at the ONGC-MRPL Complex at Katipalla, Surathkal (near Infant Mary Church) and two new outlets opened recently, at the Empire Mega Mall (MG Road) and at Bharath Mall (Opposite KSRTC Bus Stand, Bejai).  The outlets offer the youth a good hangout and a place to chill.

If you're game for just plain filter coffee, without the extra hype, try out any of the Udupi cafes. Like the Taj Mahal restaurant (at hotel Panchamahal) near Navabharath Circle, Kodial Bail and Town Hall areas.

===Alcohol===
And yes... if you're looking for that perfect night out with friends over a couple of beers or vodka, you can either buy your liquor from the many wineshops around: for example, HI-SPIRITS (Bendoorwell-Kankanady),Rajaram Wines(bolar) or you can check out the various resto-bars/lounge bars in the city.

==Stay safe==

Malaria is endemic in Mangalore. So, don't forget to carry your mosquito repellent creams, mosquito mats, coils, liquidators, etc. along with you (let that be your first priority on your list of things to pack!). Consult your doctor for advice on malaria prophylaxis before you arrive in Mangalore. If you have the slightest idea of a fever with chills, rush yourself to a nearby hospital to get yourself checked.

Also, it is advisable to get yourself vaccinated for Hepatitis A (food-borne Hepatitis) in case you haven't been vaccinated already.

Three things will do more to prevent an upset stomach or other traveling aliments than anything else:
*Always choose water from filters (Aquaguard water) or bottled mineral water, just to be on the safe side.
* Carrying water free hand sanitizer is a must (Germ-X, Purell, etc.) Go ahead and eat with your hands like everyone else! Once you use your hand sanitizer your hands are cleaner than the silverware that was washed with water you don't want to drink.
* Always choose foods that are steaming hot. Food is often prepared ahead of time so you want to see it cooked or see the steam coming of the food.

==Get out==
