'''Sioux Falls''' [http://www.siouxfalls.org] is a city of 148,000 located in [[Southeast South Dakota]].  Founded in 1883 in what was then known as the Dakota Territory, Sioux Falls has grown from a sleepy Midwestern town into a mecca for shopping and tourism in the northern Great Plains.  It is widely recognized as the largest urban center between [[Minneapolis]] and [[Denver]].

==Get in==
Sioux Falls may be traveled by car but does have courier and taxi service and trolley service downtown in the summer. The Sioux Falls Airport (FSD), 2801 N.

==Get around==

===By car===
While there is some public transportation in Sioux Falls and taxis are generally available, the easiest way to get around the city is by car.  Roads are generally well-maintained (with the occasional summer road construction) and traffic is quite light by typical North American standards, especially considering the exponential growth of the city.

As mentioned above, Sioux Falls is located at the intersection of I-29 and I-90.  Another interstate, I-229, runs from the southwest to northeast corner of the city, meaning that the vast majority of Sioux Falls is accessible via an interstate.
