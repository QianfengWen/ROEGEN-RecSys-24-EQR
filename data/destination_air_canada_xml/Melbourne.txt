Melbourne is famous as the host city for a range of major international sporting events such as the Australian Open, Melbourne Cup Carnival and Formula 1 Grand Prix. It also features some of the world's most popular art galleries and museums (National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne Museum) and internationally acclaimed festivals (Melbourne International Comedy Festival, Melbourne International Film Festival, Melbourne Fringe Festival). The city is also represented by its world-famous street art, coffee culture, pubs and live music... most of which can be found tucked away in a large number of iconic laneways. Frequently named as the World's Most Liveable City, Melbourne is close to and features many gardens, national parks and areas that are home to some of Australia's iconic wildlife ([[Great Ocean Road |The Great Ocean Road]], [[Grampians National Park]], [[Phillip Island]], Royal Botanic Gardens). Indigenous sites, museums and experiences (Koorie Heritage Trust, Birrarung Marr, Bunjilaka Aboriginal Cultural Centre) maintain a vital link to the people and culture of the First Nations.

===Climate===

[[File:Yarra Melbourne.JPG|thumb|Yarra River and Melbourne skyline on an overcast day]]

====Summary==== 
Melbourne is famous for being capable of showing 'four seasons in one day' and has a temperate climate with distinct seasons and usually mild weather. Melbourne is the third-driest capital city in Australia with half of Sydney's rainfall (at 600mm) and is good to visit year-round. Days in Summer have an average high of 26°C, though days above 35°C occur sporadically as it is the warmest season with the lowest rainfall (and fewest rainy days). Autumn and Spring are similar temperatures, hovering around 21°C averages, however there are an average of 11 days with rainfall for each of the Autumn months (March-May), compared to 14 days for each Spring month (Sep-Nov). These months usually help to prove the 'four seasons in one day' reputation, as rainfall and sunshine interchange frequently. Winters can be cool with temperatures around 14°C and 15 days of rainfall.

====Summer==== 
Melbourne summers are generally warm, with abundant sunshine and average temperatures of around 26°C by day and 16°C at night. Summers often feature a few very hot days and occasionally extreme 'heatwaves' lasting 3 or more days with temperatures above 35°-40°C (the hottest temperature ever recorded in Melbourne was 46.4°C). After a few days of extreme heat a 'cool change' will usually follow, dropping the temperature back to around 20°-30°C. January and February are Melbourne's hottest months and daylight-saving helps locals enjoy an average 14 hours of daylight and sunset in the late evening around 9pm.

====Autumn==== 
Autumn is a mixed bag of weather and lives up to Melbourne's 'four seasons in one day' reputation. One day might be 30°C, the next 15°C. The weather can change dramatically during the week so pack a diverse wardrobe! Daily highs usually range between 18°-25°C, with night-time temperatures between 8°-14°C.  In March, you can still get days of extreme heat. In 2013, Melbourne had 10 days above 30 in March, the most ever. May temperatures are noticeably colder than the days in March and early April.

====Winter====
Winters are usually cool and damp with daytime highs around 14°C in June and July, and 16°C in August. The average winter day is cloudy with sunny breaks. The temperature can get colder than 10 degrees but higher than 21. It rains averagely 2 in 5 days with around 38 'rain' days for the season. Melbourne winters can get below 10°C once every 3 years. Minimums are around 7 degrees but can get colder than 2 and higher than 12. Light snow usually falls on top of Mount Dandenong once a year, however the rest of the city is usually snow-free. There are usually 10 daylight hours in Winter with sunset around 6pm.

====Spring====
Spring is the wettest time of year in Melbourne and can still get quite cold early into the season, but then warmer as summer draws closer. Despite occasional showers, it is also arguably the prettiest and most comfortable season with flowers in bloom and the city thawing from winter cold. Daytime highs are around 18°-25°C, though November can also have days of extreme heat around 30°C. October is the wettest month with 66mm and night time lows are around 9°-15°. Spring is usually the windiest season as well.

===History===
[[File:Shrine of Remembrance, Melbourne, VIC.jpg|thumb|The Shrine of Remembrance]]
The Kulin Nation (as it is known to the peoples of the First Nations) has existed in present-day Melbourne for an estimated 60,000-100,000 years. The area has been inhabited by five First Nation groups continuously since this time, with unique cultural ceremonies such as Tanderrum surviving to this day.

British colonisation began in 1835 with the signing of Batman's Treaty between the Crown and Aboriginal Elders. There is much debate over the understanding and circumstances in which the treaty was originally signed. The treaty was declared void by the Governor of New South Wales in 1835 and all of Australia was declared 'vacant land of the Crown'. Settlers from [[Tasmania]] subsequently "purchased" land from the Crown and relocated to the areas surrounding Port Phillip Bay and the Yarra River. Subsequent hostilities between colonisers and First Nations people occurred due to the dispossession of Aboriginal land.

In 1901,  the British colonies of Australia became an independent federation and Melbourne the temporary capital of Australia, with the Federal Parliament meeting in the Parliament House of Victoria until 1927 when the new Federal capital of [[Canberra]] was founded. After World War II,  Melbourne grew rapidly, with its mainly Anglo-Celtic population boosted by immigration from Europe, particularly from Greece and Italy. The significant pre-war Jewish population was also boosted after the war. From the mid-70s,  many immigrants came from South-east Asia, particularly Vietnam and Cambodia. Melbourne has had a Chinese population since the gold rush of the 1850s and Chinatown has existed from that time but the population of Chinese and other East Asians has also been boosted by immigration in recent years.

New high-rise buildings replaced many of Melbourne’s interesting old structures in the construction boom of the 1970s and 80s. Melbournians belatedly recognised the loss of their architectural heritage and steps were taken to protect what was left. Construction of the huge Crown Casino (briefly the largest casino in the world) in the 1990s upset some Melbournians with its introduction of a gambling culture. Melbourne’s development continues in the 2000s with the opening of the Melbourne Museum, Federation Square and the Docklands precinct. The city has risen to over 5 million residents and become an Alpha- World City with significant creative, scientific, health and education sectors.  

===Culture===
Melbourne is often called the cultural capital of Australia,  with its many art galleries, film festivals, orchestras, choral and opera productions, vibrant live music scene, and a strong food, wine and coffee culture. People in Melbourne tend to dress up more than in Sydney, partly due to the colder climate. Many bars and clubs have strict dress regulations, such as requiring collars and dress shoes for men.

Particular events to note include the Melbourne International Film Festival in August, the Melbourne International Arts Festival in October, and the Melbourne Comedy Festival in April.  There are also many concerts and exhibitions throughout the year. In addition to the Melbourne Museum, there are special museums dedicated to subjects such as science, immigration, Chinese history, Jewish history, sport, racing, film and moving image, railways, police, fire brigades and banking.

===Gay & Lesbian===
While often referred to this term, 'Australia’s cultural capital', Melbourne draws much more influence from Europe in its architecture, fashion and food – and for the gay traveller it may feel like a more chilled out and refined experience after the glitz of Sydney. Melbourne is a city of less ostentatious delights than its northern cousin, regularly voted the world’s most liveable city – so set some time aside to relax and explore. [[https://www.vicrainbowtours.com.au/ VIC Rainbow Tours ]] provides Gay and Lesbian friendly tours throughout Melbourne as well as the state of Victoria.

The gay scene in Melbourne is basically divided between the north side and south side of the city. In the north side the best options are '''Sircuit Bar''' (mixed on Tuesday and Sunday) or '''The Laird''' for guys of the bear variety, while '''The Greyhound''' in St Kilda is a good pick for a mixed weekend party featuring ‘Boylesque’ performances. 

Melbourne's main annual community events are the [[https://www.midsumma.org.au/ Midsumma Festival ]] and the [[https://mqff.com.au/ Melbourne Queer Film Festival]]. 


===Sport===
[[File:Albert park aerial.jpg|thumb|Aerial shot of Albert Park]]
Sport is integral to Australian culture and Melbourne is the unquestioned sporting capital of Australia. Two major sporting administrations base their operation in Melbourne: Cricket Australia and the Australian Football League (AFL). The '''Melbourne Sports Precinct''' is a 15 minute walk from the CBD and features Melbourne Park, AAMI Park and the world famous Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), a major tourist attraction in the world's top 10 largest stadiums with crowds regularly exceeding 100,000 people. The city also features numerous other sporting venues that draw large crowds and enthusiastic supporters year round.

====Australian Football League====
Melburnians are sporting enthusiasts and particularly passionate about [http://afl.com.au/ Australian Rules football], a sport invented in Melbourne and first played in 1859. In fact, the Australian Football League (AFL) is often jokingly referred to as more of a religion in Melbourne, with 9 of 18 league teams based in the city and matches regularly drawing crowds in excess of 80,000 at the MCG. The main competition, the Premiership Season, runs from late March to late September with the Grand Final usually played on the last Saturday in September at the MCG. The Friday preceding the Grand Final is now also a public holiday. Marvel Stadium in the Docklands area is a smaller venue with a retractable roof that also hosts many AFL games and other events.

====Cricket====
Cricket is also a big drawcard in the summertime, and the [http://www.mcg.org.au/ Melbourne Cricket Ground (the 'MCG')] is one of the world's most famous cricket grounds. The National Sports Museum (NSM) (including the Racing Museum) -Australia’s only dedicated multi-sports museum- is also located at the MCG. One Day Test matches (annual) and The Ashes series (quadrennial) are the most popular events and often hosted at the MCG, with crowds often exceeding 90,000 spectators.

====Spring Racing Carnival====
Horse racing is another key sporting event, with the Spring Racing Carnival running between the AFL and Cricket seasons from October to November. The carnival makes use of Flemington and Caulfield race courses and features world-famous races, principally the Melbourne Cup. The majority of the state has a public holiday on the first Tuesday of November as '''Melbourne Cup''' race day, whilst other horse racing events in the carnival, such as Derby Day and Oaks Day, combine to draw crowds in excess of 400,000 yearly.

====Australian Open====
Each January, Melbourne hosts the [http://www.ausopen.org/ Australian Open], one of the world’s four Grand Slam Tennis championships played on hardcourt. It is the largest annual sporting event in the southern hemisphere with in excess of 700,000 attendees and over $55,000,000 in prize money.

====Grand Prix====
In March, Melbourne has hosted the first race of the Formula One season, the [http://www.grandprix.com.au/ Formula One Grand Prix] since 1996. The race is held around Albert Park Lake in South Melbourne and draws in excess of 90,000 attendees for main race day.

====Other Sports====
Melburnians have also taken soccer (football) to their hearts in recent times. Melbourne Victory, playing in Australia's premier competition, the '''A-League''', enjoyed enormous crowds and colourful, boisterous support at their original home ground, Etihad Stadium (Docklands Stadium). In 2011, the A-League added a second Melbourne team, Melbourne City (owned by Manchester City). The two teams now share the new Melbourne Rectangular Stadium, commercially known as AAMI Park.

The city also boasts one professional team in each rugby code, with both also playing at AAMI Park. The Melbourne Storm play Rugby League in the '''National Rugby League''' (NRL), against teams throughout Australia and one in New Zealand. The Melbourne Rebels play rugby union in '''Super Rugby''', which features four other Australian teams and five each from New Zealand and South Africa.

Melbourne was the first city in the Southern Hemisphere to host the '''Olympic Games''' in 1956, and has also hosted the '''Commonwealth Games''' (2006), both of which are commemorated in varying ways around the city.

===Wildlife===
Melbourne has wildlife both in and out of the city, and is the gateway to Victoria: Australia's most biodiverse state. Victoria has 516 bird species recorded - 54% of Australia's birds in just 3% of Australia's land area. 

Even in central, inner-city Melbourne, watch for Rainbow Lorikeets and Sulphur-crested Cockatoos flying around during the day, and Common Brushtail Possums and Grey-headed Flying-foxes at night. The numerous parks and gardens in Melbourne city are home to many other native species, including Australian Magpies, Magpie-larks, Red Wattlebirds, White-plumed Honeyeaters, Little Ravens, Silver Gulls, Long-billed Corellas and the occasional sighting of a Powerful Owl, a Rakali or Peregrine Falcon. 

In Melbourne's suburbs you can see a large number of native birds and some mammals.  Inner suburbs are mostly home to birds like Grey Butcherbird, Crimson Rosella, Superb Fairy-wren, Brown Thornbill and Pied Currawong and both Common Ringtail and Common Brushtail Possums.  St Kilda has a natural population of Little Penguins, along with other seabirds like Crested Terns and Little Pied Cormorants.  You are more likely to see big mammals like Eastern Grey Kangaroos and Swamp Wallabies in the outer suburbs around dusk and dawn. It is even possible to see a Bare-nosed (Common) Wombat in the hilly suburbs near the Dandenongs, and a Southern Brown Bandicoot near the Cranbourne Botanic Gardens.

Parks and reserves outside of Melbourne have the most to offer the wildlife enthusiast.  East of Melbourne is generally cool, wet forest - home to Superb Lyrebirds, King Parrots, Wombats & Wallabies.  The far east East Gippsland also has a spectacular coastline and mountain forests with Platypus, Goannas, Greater Gliders and wild Dingoes (but you have to be out at night to see them).  West of Melbourne is largely drier open woodland and plains - home to koalas, Eastern Grey Kangaroos, Kookaburras & Cockatoos. The far north-west - the Mallee - is very dry, known for Malleefowl, Major Mitchells Cockatoos, Regent Parrots, Emus and lots of reptiles.

==Get in==

===By plane===
Melbourne is served by two main airports — '''Melbourne Airport''', also referred to as Tullamarine Airport, is situated to the northwest of the city and is the main international and domestic hub. Some domestic flights from low-cost carrier Jetstar Airways also use '''Avalon Airport''', located to the southwest of the city centre on the road to [[Geelong]].

Two smaller civil aviation airports, [http://www.moorabbinairport.com.au/ '''Moorabbin Airport'''], to the south of the city, and '''Essendon Airport''' [http://www.essendonairport.com.au/], in the northwest of the city, serve limited regional flights to [[Flinders Island]], [[King Island]] and some other regional destinations.

====Melbourne Airport ====
[https://www.melbourneairport.com.au/ Melbourne Airport] ({{IATA|MEL}}) is the city's primary airport, 22km north-west of the city centre in the industrial suburb of Tullamarine. The airport is a hub for [http://www.qantas.com Qantas], Virgin Australia [http://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/plan/destinations/flights-to-melbourne/], Regional Express [http://www.rex.com.au/] and low-cost carriers Jetstar Airways [http://www.jetstar.com.au] and Tigerair Australia [https://tigerair.com.au].

Melbourne Airport is split into four terminals:
* '''Terminal 1''' Qantas domestic flights.
* '''Terminal 2''' All international flights.
* '''Terminal 3''' Virgin and Regional Express domestic flights.
* '''Terminal 4''' Tigerair and Jetstar domestic flights.

There are multiple flights per day to most major Australian and [[New Zealand]] cities, in addition to popular tourist destinations including Cairns, the Gold Coast, Hamilton Island, Townsville and Ayers Rock-Uluru. There is a daily flight to Los Angeles, and multiple flights per day to Asian hubs including [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Bangkok]] and [[Kuala Lumpur]], in addition to the major Middle Eastern hubs [[Dubai]], [[Abu Dhabi]] and [[Doha]]. 

'''Tip:''' Tweet @MELFlights on the day of travel for real-time flight information direct to your WiFi device. 

If you are driving or taking a taxi, allow at least an extra 20mins due to potential roadworks or delays on the Tullamarine Freeway, and traffic bottlenecks coming into the terminals (a wrong turn can lead to a 15mins delay easily). Especially during the afternoon peak between 3 and 7pm, when delays could add 30 minutes to your trip. Likewise, coming into town during the morning peak, expect some delays. Even an accident at 6am on Sunday morning will add delays too.

Inside the terminal, the busiest times are morning around 8-10am and evenings 6-8pm, in line with the big international flights departing. Expect congestion at security and immigration at these times.

If you want to claim something on the Tourist Refund Scheme (TRS), allow an extra 30mins again and be prepared to jostle with dozens of other travellers. TRS have an app where you prefill information from your purchase and a dedicated queue at the airport purportedly to scan a code and save time, although many tourists will queue there not having used the app and creating further delays. 

The fastest way to the city centre will be with a taxi, then Skybus/shuttle bus, then public transport being slower. When traffic is busy, public transport will have a similar travel time. The cheapest way to the city is with public transport, with a one-way fare costing $4.40 (plus Myki card), compared to $18 to $20 for Skybus or shuttle buses and $55 to $60 for a taxi. 

Melbourne has plans to open a [https://bigbuild.vic.gov.au/projects/melbourne-airport-rail/about/project-timeline direct rail line to Melbourne airport by 2029], possibly via Sunshine Railway Station.

Unofficial taxi drivers are becoming more prevalent at the airport now, approaching travelers at arrivals within all terminals. Their rates may be slightly lower, but probably similar to a regular taxi or Uber. Exercise caution, as they are not registered and may try to scam you.

*'''Regular bus''': The cheapest options ($4.40). [https://goo.gl/maps/RBRVvSSa5HjiS8obA Route 1 bus and train - 60-75 mins] - Bus 901 to Broadmeadows Train Station [https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/more/travelling-on-the-network/visiting-melbourne-and-victoria/airport-buses/ (6am-midnight)], then train to Southern Cross Station in the city.

Up-to-date timetable information, including a journey planner, is available on the [http://ptv.vic.gov.au/ PTV website].
*'''Taxis''' between the airport and the CBD cost between $55-65 and take about 30 minutes in clear traffic, much longer in busy times.
*'''Uber''' between $46-60 for the same trip as a taxi. If departing from Terminal 1, 2 & 3, follow the signs for ‘Uber’ towards the Pickup Zone. For Terminal 4, head to the Pickup Zone on level 2 of the T4 carpark.
*'''Skybus''' [http://skybus.com.au] ☎+61 3 9335 2811, Currently operating a limited service (08/2022) to Southern Cross Station, with ticket booths and stops outside Terminal 1 and Terminal 3. A one-way ticket costs $19.5, with discounts for groups, children and seniors. The trip takes around 20 minutes in good traffic, and usually leaves every 10 minutes during the day with connecting buses to major hotels in the CBD. Tickets can be purchased online, although bookings aren't generally necessary except for hotel pick-ups, which should be arranged at least three hours ahead.

====Avalon Airport ====

Avalon Airport, [http://www.avalonairport.com.au/] ({{IATA|AVV}}), is situated in outer Geelong suburb of Lara. The airport is located 55 km to the south-west of Melbourne, and is considerably further from Melbourne CBD than the Melbourne airport at Tullamarine. However, a shuttle to Southern Cross costs only $4 more than a shuttle from Tullamarine, and fares from Avalon are sometimes considerably cheaper. The terminal itself is about as simple as it gets, with just an ATM, car hire desks and baggage carousels in what looks like an old hangar at arrivals. The departure facilities are a little better, with a cafe and a bar, and a video arcade room. 

[http://www.jetstar.com.au Jetstar Airways] is the only airline operating from Avalon, with up to four flights per day to Sydney — be sure to double-check your booking is from Avalon, rather than the larger Melbourne Airport.

Besides Melbourne, Avalon is a useful gateway to [[Geelong]] and the [[Great Ocean Road]].

As per advice heading to Melbourne airport, allow at least 30mins extra if taking an evening flight from Avalon. Traffic on the M1 southbound is congested every day between 3pm and 7pm, and can take a lot longer than advertised. Traffic peaks at 5pm or so, and an accident can almost stop the whole freeway. Likewise, expect delays coming into Melbourne from Geelong 6-10am. 

*'''Taxis''' from Avalon Airport to the Melbourne CBD will run upwards of $100.

*'''SITA coaches''' [http://www.sitacoaches.com.au/avalon/rates_avalon.shtml] operates a coach shuttle service to Melbourne's Southern Cross Station, costing $20 per adult and $10 per child one way. The buses meet every Jetstar arrival. An additional $7 per person charge is made for a transfer to city hotels. Only cash is accepted, not credit cards. 

*'''Regional trains''' [http://www.vline.com.au/] run from Lara station, around 8km from the terminal, to Southern Cross Station hourly, and cost $5.60. Children 17 years and under are half price, however during off-peak times up to two children travel free with every adult. A taxi to the station should cost around $15, so there is no cost or time benefit for a single adult of the train over the shuttle.

*'''Hiring a car''' for a couple of days may be cheaper than a taxi, as long as you have somewhere to park it. Road connections between Avalon Airport and Melbourne are good, with the journey typically taking around 50 minutes — allow longer on Sundays and during peak hour.

===By train===
All regional and interstate rail services depart from Southern Cross Station, located on Spencer Street at the western edge of the Melbourne CBD. The station is well-connected to the rest of the city's transport network, including most suburban train lines, tram routes, and some bus services.

* <listing name="V/Line" alt="" directions="" address="" phone="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">Operates most regional trains, with regular services to [[Geelong]], [[Ballarat]], [[Albury]], [[Bendigo]] and [[Bairnsdale]] amongst others</listing>

===By car===
From [[Sydney]], the quickest route to Melbourne is the Hume Highway, which takes 10-11 hours. The Princes Highway (National Route 1) goes along the coast and is less crowded. It takes longer and the speed limit is lower, though.

[[Adelaide]] is slightly closer than Sydney and can be reached in 9 hours.  The coastal route is scenic but slower.

A direct journey from [[Brisbane]] takes 21 hours of driving and takes you further inland along the Newell Highway.  This makes for an interesting alternative to the standard Brisbane-Sydney-Melbourne coastal route.

===By bus===
Bus services to Melbourne from out of state are provided by Firefly Express [http://www.fireflyexpress.com.au ] and Greyhound [http://www.greyhound.com.au ].

Bus services within Victoria are operated by V/Line, and operate from most major and many minor Victorian towns.

===By ship===
Melbourne can be reached from [[Devonport]], [[Tasmania]] by car/passenger ferries run by Spirit of Tasmania [http://www.spiritoftasmania.com.au/].  The journey takes 10 hours and runs every night (in both directions), departing at 9PM and arriving at 7AM.  During the peak of summer, there are also day sailings (departing 9AM, arriving 7PM) on many days - check in advance.

Ticket prices depend on time of year and your sleeping accommodation. A seat (no bed) is the cheapest, starting (in off-peak season) from $108 for adults and $82 for children. Bear in mind, the seat is most uncomfortable, equivalent to a cinema seat. Cabins with bunk beds start from $187 adults, $97 children.  Peak season costs are about 25% higher.  Cars cost $59 all year round.

Melbourne is also served by several cruise ships throughout the year (mostly in the summer cruise season). Check operators for further details.
 
All passenger ships serving Melbourne arrive at and depart from Station Pier in Port Melbourne which is located in [[Melbourne/South Melbourne|South Melbourne]] about 2.5 miles southwest from the CBD. For those without private transport, the 109 tram departs from the old railway station across the road from the Station Pier and goes right into the heart of Melbourne (continuing to Box Hill in the north-east of the city).

===By public transport===
[[File:D1.3527 7News tram.JPG|thumb|right|A tram outside of the Melbourne Town Hall.]]
Melbourne's public transport is extensive, and in inner city areas frequent and easy to use — most popular attractions are easily reached by tram or train, and it is quite easy to get around Melbourne without a car. The Melbourne CBD is covered by the [https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/assets/PTV-default-site/Maps-and-Timetables-PDFs/Maps/Network-maps/Free-Tram-Zone-Map-Map-2021.pdf Free Tram Zone], which means travelling in the CBD by tram is free of charge. Best of all, most of the major attractions in Melbourne fall within the free tram zone. For more information refer [http://ptv.vic.gov.au/ Public Transport Victoria], the authority responsible for public transport throughout [[Victoria]].

The <listing name="PTV Hub" alt="" directions="" lat="" long="" address="Southern Cross Station, 750 Collins St, Melbourne" phone="" tollfree="1800 800 007" email="" fax="" url="http://ptv.vic.gov.au" hours="" price=""></listing> provides timetables, brochures, and can assist with other enquiries. [http://ptv.vic.gov.au/getting-around/mobile-apps/ PTV apps] are available for iPhone and Android, and a journey planner tool is available through its [http://ptv.vic.gov.au/ website]. Services generally run from 5am to midnight, with 24 hour services common on Friday and Saturday nights.

====myki====
All Melbourne bus, tram and train services fall under the '''myki''' [http://ptv.vic.gov.au/tickets/myki/] smart card ticketing system. Paper tickets are not in use and the purchase of a myki card is required. A myki visitor value pack is on sale at the [http://fedsquare.com/shopvisit/melbourne-visitor-centre Melbourne Visitor Centre] in Federation Square, SkyBus ticket booths and the PTV Hub. myki cards may also be purchased from vending machines at train stations, newsagents, convenience stores and major CBD tram stops.

Important information:
* Passengers must validate ('touch on') their myki card before each journey- either before entering a train station platform or after boarding a tram/bus
* Fares are standardised at '''$4.50 for a '2 hour pass'''' (unlimited transfers/changes) and '''$9.00 for a 'Daily pass'''' (unlimited travel on the date 'touched on'). 
* The myki system automatically applies the best fare for travel, up to a maximum rate equivalent to a 'Daily pass' ($9.00)
* Children under 16 years and Australian seniors card holders are eligible for cheaper concession fares, which are half-price. You will need to buy a concession card.
* Authorised Officers (known locally as "ticket inspectors") frequently patrol trams and trains to check customers have paid a valid myki fare. Its possible to go weeks without seeing them though, but best tag on to be safe.
* Lack of a valid myki fare/ticket may result in a $238 fine (given at the officer's discretion)

Other information:
* Most train stations (outside of the CBD and major centres) do not have ticket barriers to enter platforms. Instead, you 'touch on' or 'touch off' at myki readers (usually bright green) located next to the platform entrance
* Some myki consoles (usually blue in colour) are only for checking balance- these are not for 'touching on' to validate your myki
* When a myki is presented to a reader and no light or tone occurs, the card has not been read and is not valid for travel
* If a passenger has forgotten to 'touch on' and barriers are present, seek out a customer service officer and explain the situation- they are often sympathetic and will let you go. If an 'Authorised Officer' (Ticket Inspector) gets you, you may be liable to a fine.
* All railway stations in the (electrified) network are in Zone 1. However, in the middle/outer suburban railway stations, some are in Zone 2, and if you solely travel within this zone, you can have a cheaper Zone 2 fare.
* However, there are also some stations outside the electrified network that can also be travelled to on a suburban fare, and not a more expensive rural fare.
These are:
* Ballarat Line: Sunshine - Bacchus Marsh
* Geelong Line: Sunshine - Little River
* Seymour Line: Craigieburn - Wandong

* Trams do not require passengers to 'touch off' their myki as all stops are within Zone 1 so the default fare is charged.
* NOTE: There is an exception to the above rule. If you are travelling only within the Zone 2 overlap for trams, which is only applicable to a portion of three tram routes, being the 75, 86 and 109 (the portions are listed below), then you need to touch off the tram to receive the cheaper Zone 2 fare ($3.00 vs. $4.50, half if on a Concession fare)

Zone 2 overlap sections:
Route 75: Stop 41 (Riversdale Rd.) to Stop 75 (Vermont South S/C (Terminus)) 
Route 86: Stop 52 (Tyler St.) to Stop 71 (Bundoora RMIT)
Route 109: Stop 47 (Balwyn Rd.) to Stop 58 (Box Hill Central)

====Trams====
Melbourne's iconic tram network is the [http://www.yarratrams.com.au/about-us/who-we-are/facts-figures/ largest tram network in the world], and covers a large part of the CBD, inner and middle suburbs. A free [http://ptv.vic.gov.au/route/view/1112 '''City Circle tram'''] runs around the perimeter of the CBD and Docklands area using heritage brown "W-class" trams, providing a great introduction to the city. Trams usually run frequently - though they may be crowded during peak periods in the morning (6-9am) or evening (4-7pm) — especially along major routes such as St Kilda Road and Swanston, Collins and Bourke Streets. Around 60% of the current fleet (as of 2018) are air conditioned, and the majority of CBD tram stops are also wheelchair-friendly and clearly signed. Although outside of the CBD, many are either safety-zone or even kerbside stops.

A [https://static.ptv.vic.gov.au/siteassets/PDFs/Maps/Network-maps/PTV-Free-Tram-Zone-Map.pdf '''Free Tram Zone'''] also covers much of the CBD and Docklands. Using trams within this zone does not require a myki. If you have a myki and are travelling exclusively within this zone, do not touch on as you will be charged for a 2 Hour pass. If you board in the free tram zone but are travelling to a stop that is outside of it, remember to touch on your myki as failing to do so may incur a fine from a ticket inspector.

Any disruptions due to accidents or power loss are usually resolved quickly, and outages will be noted on electronic stop signage (if present) or will be mentioned on the '''Yarra Trams''' [http://www.yarratrams.com.au/ website].

====Trains====
All 15 suburban train lines depart from '''Flinders Street Station''', opposite Federation Square in the Central Business District (CBD). Many lines also run through the '''City Loop''', which connects to Southern Cross Station and three underground stations around the perimeter of the city centre: Parliament, Melbourne Central and Flagstaff. These city stations are well spread out in the Southern (Flinders Street), Western (Southern Cross), North Western (Flagstaff), Northern (Melbourne Central) and Eastern (Parliament) extremities of the CBD, making them a convenient base to explore the majority of Melbourne's attractions. All station entrances throughout Melbourne are identifiable with their prominent blue signage. 

Trains run frequently throughout the day with most lines commencing service around 5am and terminating around 12am. Carriages can be crowded during peak times in the morning (6-9am) and evening (4-7pm). On weekends (Friday-Sunday nights), train services run 24 hours a day, departing at least every hour between 12am and 5am.  Occasionally the network can fall victim to signalling issues, weather and extreme heat — the most up-to-date service information is available from the '''Metro Trains''' [http://www.metrotrains.com.au website] or [https://www.twitter.com/metrotrains Twitter account].

All trains are air conditioned and most major stations will have staff, bathrooms and other facilities. 82 stations are designated as '''Premium Stations''', featuring a customer service window where passengers can buy tickets and pick up timetables. Most Premium Stations also have additional passenger facilities such as indoor waiting areas and toilets. Southern Cross station is the best equipped station for travellers with toilets, supermarkets, food options and the 'PTV Hub' for help planning any journeys.

====Buses====
Buses tend to link areas without train or tram connections, with some exceptions, often service major shopping centres, middle and outer suburbs. The  [http://www.thatsmelbourne.com.au/visitors/transport/shuttle/Pages/VisitorShuttle.aspx '''Melbourne Visitor Shuttle'''] links attractions in the CBD, Carlton and Docklands every 15 minutes for a flat rate of $5 per day.

==Get around==
	
Although Melbourne itself is a very large metropolitan area, most sights of interest are within the city centre and easily reached by public transport.
 	
===On foot===
 	
Melbourne's city centre is laid out in an orderly grid system, similar to [[Manhattan]], making it easy to navigate around the most central areas. During peak hour, walking may even be quicker than taking the tram. A free map of the city centre is available from the Melbourne Visitor Centres in Federation Square and Bourke Street Mall.

===By bike===
[[Image:Yarra (1).jpg|thumb|Yarra River]] 

Melbourne has an excellent network of bike paths, plus a generally flat terrain, making pedal-power a great way to take in the city.  Most paths are "shared footways" under the law, although the majority of users in most places are cyclists.  This means cyclists should expect to share the path with pedestrians, dog-walkers, rollerbladers, joggers, prams and tricycles. Some trails contain on-road sections (in marked bike lanes). It is legal to cycle on footpaths only when supervising cycling children or when the path is marked or signposted as allowing bikes.  Helmets are required by law, and care should be taken when cycling near slippery tram tracks, where many have gotten injured in the past.  Reflective clothing and lights are essential for safe night rides.

====Trails====

* <listing name="Yarra River Trail" alt="" directions="" address="" phone="" email="" fax="" url="http://www.bv.com.au/bikes-&-riding/41356/" hours="" price="">Runs from the mouth of Melbourne's iconic Yarra River, through the city and onwards to Westerfolds Park in the outer suburbs.

There is no cyclist access permitted to the West Gate Bridge.</listing>

====Bike rental====
A folding bike of 20" wheel base is very convenient when traveling in the city. In addition when in folded condition it can be carried on bus, train and CountryLink without any additional charges. Just tell the driver that it will be folded and hand carried as baggage. As for inter-city train, avoid rush hour (7AM-9AM and 5PM-6PM).  If the wheelchair area is not occupied then the bike can be parked in this area safely without folding.

===By car===
The major car rental chains are well-represented and include [https://www.redspot.com.au/locations/coburg/ Redspot], Avis, Budget, Europcar, [https://www.hertz.com.au/p/hire-a-car/australia/victoria/melbourne/melbourne-downtown-franklin-street?utm_source=google&utm_medium=local&utm_campaign=gmb_listing&utm_content=melbourne_downtown_franklin_st Hertz], Thrifty & [https://www.sixt.com.au/car-hire/australia/melbourne/#/ Sixt]. Independent car rental companies are also plentiful and can offer good value for money. If you are looking to cover a long distance by car, ensure your rental policy includes unlimited mileage - most economy to standard sized car rental include this already.

There are a handful of intersections in the city centre and in South Melbourne, along Clarendon St. where you must do a '''Hook turn''' to turn right due to tram tracks running down the centre of the road.  Follow the signs, pull to the left of the intersection if you are turning right, as far forward as possible, and when the light for the street you are turning into turns green (the traffic on the street you are on stops) make the turn.

Check out CityLink's [http://www.citylink.com.au/] site for details of Melbourne's T-shaped tollway which links the Westgate, Tullamarine and Monash (formerly South-Eastern) freeways.  It is a fully electronic road with no manual tollgates.  You can buy a day pass in advance, or within 3 days of having driven down it, giving your registration and car details.  You can do this by phone, Internet, or at some Shell petrol stations.  The registered owner of the car will get a fine in the mail if you do not buy a pass within 3 days.  The tolled sections are indicated with blue and yellow signs, rather than the standard green and white.  CityLink can cut a worthwhile amount of time from your journey, especially if you are driving from, say, the south-eastern suburbs to Melbourne Airport.  Motorcycles are free, cars are around $11/day.  Larger vehicles are more.  

The EastLink tollway has recently been completed.  Formerly called the Scoresby, then the Mitcham-Frankston freeway, it links the Eastern, Monash, Frankston and Mornington Peninsula freeways. Like the CityLink, it is a fully electronic road with no toll gates. If you have a tag or account, tolls range from 28c for short trips on some segments, to a toll cap of $5.15. Weekends are 20% off, and motorcycles are half price. If you don't have a tag or account, passes are available for the cost of the trip cap (e.g. travelling one way will cost you $5.15 in a car). Passes are available online at [http://www.breeze.com.au/] and can be purchased before or up to 3 days after the trip. 

Tags from other Australian cities work on CityLink and the EastLink tollway, but passes do not.

One option for travel on both CityLink and EastLink is the Melbourne Pass. It costs $5.50 to start up an account, and tolls are debited from your credit card automatically once the accumulated tolls and fees reach $10, or when the pass expires (after 30 days, but can be extended once for another 30 days). No tag is required. The pass can be purchased online.

In the centre, parking at meters and ticket machines can be as much as $5.50 per hour.

Motorcycles and scooters are well catered for as footpath parking is both free and legal (providing the footpath is not obstructed).  Scooters are becoming very common, however for all size scooters a motorcycle license must be held.

{{infobox|Footy fever|It may be called "Australian rules" football, but the city that rules the game is Melbourne: until 1987, every team in what was then the Victorian Football League was based in Melbourne or Geelong, and even today 10 of 18 teams in the AFL hail from the city.  The season runs through winter from late March to late September, with big matches drawing up to 100,000 spectators.

For the first-time spectator, the "footy" looks like untrammeled mayhem, with the oval rugby-style ball carried, kicked, bounced or even punched &mdash; but never thrown &mdash; across the oval pitch while the opposing team's players tried to grab it or pummel its holder into submission.  The objective is simple enough: to kick the ball between the two tall goalposts (scoring 6 points), or barring that at least between a goal post and the shorter post next to it (a ''behind'', scoring 1 point).  No protective equipment of any kind is used and almost anything goes when tackling, although traditionalists bemoan the recent banning of moves like grabbing a player's arms from behind and ramming them into the ground head first!

All that said, footy fans are a surprisingly well-behaved lot and hooliganism is nearly unknown, with plenty of families and little old ladies attending matches.  Tickets can be booked in advance online, depending on the game, but for most games you can simply show up at the stadium before the match, with general admission tickets starting from around $20.}}

* See interesting films at the Art Deco-styled repertory cinema '''Astor Theatre''' [http://www.astortheatre.net.au/] in St Kilda. There are several moonlight cinema programmes in summer. The Melbourne International Film Festival [https://miff.com.au/ ] is on in August.

* Learn about aboriginal culture and history at the '''Koorie Heritage Trust''' [http://www.koorieheritagetrust.com/]

* Visit a comedy club. The '''Comic's Lounge''' [http://www.thecomicslounge.com.au/ ] has shows for $10-25 including a show filmed for Channel 31 on Mondays, or dinner and show for $45. The Comedy Club [http://www.thecomedyclub.com.au/] has dinner and show for $32 and shows only beginning at $7 (discount ticket price). Alternatively the comedy festival runs through most of April all over Melbourne.

* Watch the mesmerising process of personalised hard candy being hand-made at '''Suga''' [http://www.suga.com.au/]. Around lunch time is a good time to see (and sample!).

==Learn==

* You can take language classes, join a cafe book group, learn to draw, sign up for historical walk, foodie walk, or photography walk-shop, study for your Victorian Certificate of Education or take computer or business classes at the Council of Adult Education (CAE) [http://www.cae.edu.au/].  The CAE is also home to the City Library [http://www.citylibrary.org.au/] where you can sign up to borrow books or just read magazines in their cafe.

Melbourne is home to some of both the nation and worlds best Universities. The University of Melbourne is situated in Parkville, and is regularly ranked as the best University in Australia. Monash University is located in Clayton, in Melbourne's South. Both Universities are members of the exclusive Group of Eight Universities of Australia. Also to note are La Trobe University, Swinburne University, RMIT, Deakin University, Australian Catholic University and Victoria University. This list is not exhaustive, and Victorians are spoilt for choice in the quality of Tertiary education available.

==Work==

The most popular industry for a working holiday is to work in hospitality jobs around the St. Kilda area. The wages in all other industries are usually much better than working in hospitality but require more specific skills. At the moment there are a lot of job offers for nurses and craftsmen.

Fruit picking is a possible source of income but in the greater Melbourne area but there are not many jobs offered. You will find better chances are in the dairy business but you should have some basic experience. Grape vine tending is another possibility in the near by [[Yarra Valley]].

Shopping hours in metro Melbourne are typically 7 days a week, 9AM-5:30PM weekdays (from April 22, 2014 CBD trading hours for Myer Emporium Centre and Melbourne Central and nearby areas will be extended to 7pm, but 9pm trading on Thursday and Friday is unchanged) and 9AM( maybe later)- 5PM weekends. Most suburban shopping centres such as Chadstone have later closing hours on Thursdays and Fridays - mostly up to 9PM. Supermarkets have extended hours 7 days, the majority opening at 7AM and closing at midnight or 1AM, however there are many 24 hour supermarkets around.

Alcohol in Victoria can be purchased at licensed shops/venues and supermarkets often have an adjoining bottle shop, which close earlier than supermarket hours. Some supermarkets that close at the same time as their licence stock alcohol in the supermarket. You need to be over 18 years old to purchase alcohol. Most bottleshops close by 10PM to midnight (even on weekends), but some open until 3AM (e.g. on Riversdale road in Booroondara and Russell St Melbourne), and 24-hour bottleshops on both Chapel and Lygon streets, in Stonnington and Melbourne respectively.

===City Shopping===

[[Image:Bourke St.jpg|thumb|Bourke Street Mall]] 

Melbourne is known as the fashion capital of Australia with numerous malls and boutique lined streets.

In the CBD itself, '''Little Collins Street''' is home to some of the world's top designers and fashion houses; '''Collins Street''' also boasts other high end shops such as Louis Vuitton. '''Brunswick Street''' (Fitzroy), and the southern end of '''Chapel Street''' in Prahran/Windsor, have clusters of stores selling an eclectic mix of vintage, rave, retro and alternative gear such as Shag, Fat Helen's and Beaut Vintage to shop around.

'''Melbourne Central''' is another shopping mall based in the city, adjacent to the underground station of the same name. The '''Bourke Street Mall''' with the department stores Myer and David Jones is another city-central shopping hub.

'''Emporium''' connects Myer and David Jones to Melbourne Central and containing a large number of Australian and International brands.

For the bargain shopper, there is a DFO Outlets Centre located at South Wharf, on the southern bank of the Yarra River. It is located next to the Convention Centre.

It is also worth noting, for Backpackers, that Elizabeth Street has plenty of Bargain backpackers stores, for example Mitchell's Adventure (255-257 Elizabeth Street), which can offer outdoor products for bargain prices.

===Suburban Shopping===

Bridge Road [http://www.bridgerd.com.au/home.asp] in [[Melbourne/Richmond|Richmond]] is a strip where warehouse direct outlets rule and no one pays recommended retail price. 
'''Chapel Street''' in [[Melbourne/South Yarra|South Yarra]] is a favourite among the locals, with its spread of exclusive boutiques, cafes and well established chain stores. 

There are also several huge shopping complexes in the outer suburbs, such as Chadstone and Southland (Cheltenham) in the South-East. Westfield Doncaster Shoppingtown, (about 20 minutes from the city and recently vastly expanded). Eastland (Ringwood) and Knox City are in the outer East. Northland in the north, Highpoint in the west. Chadstone in [[Monash]]  is the largest shopping centre in the Southern Hemisphere with over 530 stores.

===Looking for something in particular?===

For those in the bridal market, '''High Street''' in Armadale, [[Stonnington]] and '''Sydney Road''' in [[Brunswick]], [[Moreland]] are the two main clusters for  bridal apparel and accessories.
For those who are looking for local, aspiring designer creations, try '''Greville Street''' in [[Melbourne/South Yarra|South Yarra]], [[Stonnington]] or '''Smith Street''' and surrounds in [[Melbourne/Fitzroy|Fitzroy]].

To buy funny souvenirs and Australian typical stuff, walk or take the tram to '''Victoria Market'''. You'll find all you need there and the price is usually a half or a third of the prices in the souvenir shops downtown.

==Eat==
For the culinary traveller, Melbourne is one of the best destinations in the world. There is an abundance of affordable, high quality restaurants representing almost every cuisine. Eating out is cheaper than in Western Europe but not as affordable as North America. The service in Australian restaurants may be more discreet than many North Americans may be used to. Although service staff in Australia are paid considerably more than their North American counterparts and tipping is not compulsory, a tip for good service is always welcomed.

Excellent eateries can be found sprinkled throughout all of the inner (and some outer) suburbs, while certain neighbourhoods have become magnets for residents and restaurants of particular countries. A large range of restaurants and cafes offering high quality food, and representating various cultures and countries, are scattered through the central city, Southbank, Carlton (mostly Italian and touristy), Victoria Street in Richmond (many low cost popular Vietnamese and South East Asian restaurants), Docklands, South Yarra and Prahran. Sydney Road in Brunswick and Coburg is known for its many Middle Eastern, Lebanese, Greek and Turkish restaurants. The popular tourist area of [[Melbourne/St Kilda|St Kilda]] offers a large range of good quality restaurants and cafes, especially on Acland Street, and Fitzroy Street.

English-style fish and chip shops are scattered through the suburbs - particularly in bayside areas. Souvlaki and gyros are very popular in Melbourne and outlets are plentiful through the inner and outer suburbs. Japanese nori rolls and sushi is very popular and many stores through the city and suburbs sell these items.

There are also a number of ongoing/pop-up markets and festivals dedicated to food. One of the larger and more well known food markets is the Queen Victoria Night Market held on Wednesday evenings 17:00-22:00. And don't overlook the growing food truck culture, with some of Melbourne's amazing chefs now starting up their own trucks, it is an experience not to be missed.

====African====
There is a concentration of African cafes in Nicholson St, Footscray and Racecourse Road, Flemington. Most serve a small range of Ethiopian cuisine and coffee, and are frequented by the local African residents. The [http://www.theabyssinian.com.au Abyssinian] is a well-regarded Eritrean/Ethiopian restaurant popular for locals and tourists for a more elaborate dinner. The stewed foods are served on a large pancake in the middle of the table. Everyone eats with their hands which is messy but fun.

====Australian====
"Australian cuisine" is a nebulous concept that may include traditional native foodstuffs and more modern cafe infusions of international influences. Items such a emu and kangaroo meat are available, however tend to be found only at the high-end fine dining restaurants as a speciality item. You can find great kangaroo steaks at the Napier Hotel (Napier Street, Fitzroy) for around $30, or at the Edinburgh Castle pub on Sydney Road, Brunswick for around $26. You can also find kangaroo products at some larger supermarkets; they are growing enormously in popularity due to their high level of nutrition. Ten good quality sausages can be purchased for around $15 at your local Coles or Woolworths supermarket. Kangaroo meat is also usually available from the meat section of the Queen Victoria Market [http://www.qvm.com.au/].

Meat pies are available from bakeries and convenience stores. The 'best' pie really comes down to personal taste and preference, however it is arguably a poor decision to base your opinion on this much loved Australian staple on a pie from a convenience store - head to a bakery in the suburbs, or if in the CBD, Pie-Face offers very good quality pies, at a price similar to that of convenience stores.

Other foods considered to be 'Australian' include lamingtons, Vegemite, and roast lamb. All of these products are widely available from just about any supermarket, no matter how small. Vegemite is ubiquitous and likely to be included with the buffet breakfast of any hotel or hostel, so be sure to try some spread on hot buttered toast. Whilst it's an acquired taste, the product is synonymous with breakfast ("Brekky") in Australia. Be warned - a little goes a long way!

====Café/delicatessen food====
High quality delicatessen style eating available in many of a cafes in the small lanes of central Melbourne. Many high quality deli style diners can be found outside the city, in Acland Street, St Kilda.

====Chinese====
[[File:Chinese-new-year-melbourne.JPG|thumb|Many of Melbourne's Chinese restaurants are located in Chinatown, pictured here during Chinese New Year]]
Chinese cuisine has a long tradition in Melbourne and a large number and range of quality restaurants exist. Many are in Chinatown (Australia's oldest Chinatown) in Little Bourke Street, City centre. They are also dotted through the inner and outer suburbs, with concentrations in Richmond, Footscray, and suburban Box Hill, Glen Waverley and Springvale.

Most of the food is from the Southern (Cantonese) school of cooking, although Northern favourites like dumplings are also available. Eating dim sum, which is consumed either during breakfast or lunch (called yum cha or "drinking tea" in Cantonese) is an extremely popular Sunday pastime for Australians of all ethnic backgrounds.

If you're after a budget option (meals $5-10), try Camy's dumpling house (Shanghai style dumplings) on Tattersalls Lane in the CBD. In the evening, the easiest  - and most amusing - option is the all-you-can eat service for $12 per person. Service is dicey, but always exciting.

====French====
Most of Melbourne's French restaurants are concentrated around the inner-city and CBD. Perhaps the most well-known is Bistro Gulliaume, which is located at the Crown complex in Southbank. French Saloon, Oter and Phillippe's are all located within the CBD. The restaurant Entrecôte has two locations: one in the city centre and the other at South Yarra.

CBD Recommendations include Vue de Monde (Fine Dining French/Australian Fusion), The French Brasserie (Fine Dining), Bistrot d'Orsay (Mid-Range) and Roule Galette (Cheap Eats).

====Greek====
Melbourne has the largest Greek population outside of Greece and Lonsdale Street in the [[Melbourne/Central|City Centre]] is Melbourne's Greek precinct. It features a choice between several bars, cafés, restaurants and cake shops. Greek establishments can also be found on Sydney Road in Brunswick, Swan Street in Richmond and in Coburg and Oakleigh in the south-eastern suburbs. These areas have typically been centres of Greek migration in Melbourne.

CBD Recommendations include The Press Club (Fine Dining), Tsindos (Mid-Range) and Stalactites (Cheap Eats/Souvlaki).

====Indian====
Indian restaurants can be found throughout Melbourne, particularly in the city, North Melbourne, and inner eastern suburbs such as Richmond and Hawthorn. The focus is mainly on Northern Indian dishes, though Southern Indian can be found. There are also numerous Indian snack bars in the city that serve cheap but tasty curries and samosas, cafeteria-style.

Recommendations include Delhi Streets, Curry Vault and Two Fat Indians in the CBD, and Mukka in Fitzroy.

====Indonesian====
Befitting its large number of Indonesian students, Melbourne has many Indonesian restaurants. One of the most famous is Blok M which many famous Indonesians have visited. Another popular restaurant is Nelayan with two restaurants on Swanston Street and Glenferrie Rd, Agung on Glenferrie Road, Bali Bagus on Franklin Street, Es Teler 77 on Swanston St, Nusantara in Caulfield and Bali Bowl on Flinders Lane. There are also Warung Gudeg, specialising in Yogyakartan local cuisine, as well as Pondok Bamboe Koening, focusing on serving Indonesian noodles to locals in Clayton. Warung Agus in West Melbourne serves Balinese cuisine on a rather upscale atmosphere.

====Italian====
With its large Italian population Melbourne has countless Italian restaurants, mostly offering food from the southern regions of the Italian peninsular. Pizza outlets are very much part of the Melbourne landscape, with many chains and standalone restaurants in all suburbs.

Italian cafes and restaurants are plentiful throughout Melbourne but are in the greatest concentration in Lygon Street, [[Melbourne/Carlton|Carlton]], just north of the city centre. Lygon Street is where Melbourne's coffee culture originated. Suburban Italian restaurants are often large and family orientated and tend towards the pizza, pasta, seafood and steak formula.

====Japanese====
A quick "sushi" take away lunch can be bought on almost every block where there is food. In and out of Chinatown there are also plenty of places that have good bento, udon and donburi as well.

For dinner, many of the inner city suburbs have Japanese restaurants, but in the city itself there is a long an interesting Japanese restaurant history that continues to this day. Both Melbourne's oldest, Kuni's (which has been around since 1978) and its sister restaurant Kenzans are known for a very authentic, if expensive, meal. There are a plethora of choices for those on stricter budgets as well.

====Jewish/Kosher====
[[Melbourne/St Kilda|St. Kilda East]] and Caulfield are home to vibrant Jewish communities and kosher bakeries and cafes abound most situated on Carlisle Street in Balaclava, Kooyong Road in Caulfield North and Glenhuntly Road in Elsternwick.

====Malaysian/Singapore====
Malaysians and Singaporeans feeling homesick will find a host of restaurants and foodcourt outlets offering items like roti canai/paratha, nasi lemak, prawn noodles, laksa, ayam kapitan, otak otak etc. Many are in the [[Melbourne/Central|City Centre]]; there are Malaysian restaurants scattered throughout Melbourne. The remarkable Malaysian restaurant here are '''Laksa King''' in Flemington offering vibrant atmosphere,  '''Jade Kingdom''' in Rosanna with casual family dining experience, '''Blue Chillies''' in Fitzroy in a fine dining setup and offering nyonya food in Docklands.

====Middle Eastern====
Arab, Lebanese, Moroccan and Turkish restaurants tend to be concentrated in Sydney Road in Brunswick and Coburg to the north of the city centre. Half Moon Cafe on Sydney Road (near Bell St) makes particularly good falafel. These restaurants can also be found in the outer suburbs that are home to those communities, including Dandenong.

====Nepalese====
There are a few choices for Nepali cuisine in Melbourne, with notable chain Ghurkas 

====Thai====
Thai restaurants are ubiquitous in Melbourne: even dining precincts mostly known for Italian or Vietnamese food boast Thai restaurants.

====Vegetarian====
Vegetarian food is widely available in Melbourne, and you can expect every restaurant or cafe to have a few vegetarian or vegan options.  There are also many vegetarian restaurants: Vegie Bar in Brunswick St, Fitzroy, Gopals in Swanston St and Shakahari in Lygon St, Carlton are just some of the options. Crossways at 123 Swanston St. serves a very popular $5 all you can eat vegetarian lunch, Mon-Sat. Most Indian and Thai restaurants throughout the city will either have a large vegetarian menu or give patrons the option of ordering any dish without meat (sometimes with tofu).

Trippy Taco on the corner of Gertrude St. and Smith St. in Fitzroy is an all vegetarian/vegan Mexican establishment. Around the corner, on Smith St. Las Vegan Cafe is a all vegan hot spot. Lord of the Fries do American style burgers with mock meat, and their food can also be vegan upon request. Lentil as Anything has Indian/African styled food that is all you can eat, with a unique pay what you feel system, there are locations in St. Kilda (a la carte), Abbotsford Convent (buffet/live music) and Footscray (buffet), all of the food is vegetarian and they label which of their food are vegan, gluten free etc.

====Vietnamese====
Melbourne's Little Vietnams are in [[Melbourne/Footscray|Footscray]], [[Melbourne/Richmond|North Richmond]] and Springvale out in the far eastern suburbs. The streets in these areas are lined with ''pho'' (noodle) shops and restaurants offering other Vietnamese favourites. Many outlets have also appeared along Swanston Street in the [[Melbourne/Central|City Centre]]. However for convenience to the city and reasonable prices, Barkly/Hopkins Street in Footscray and Victoria Street in North Richmond are your best bets.

====Others====
Spanish, Argentinian, Burmese and Polish restaurants can be found in the Richmond/Collingwood/Prahran area.

Melbourne has some Cajun/Creole restaurants and American style diners, food trucks and bars.

Korean restaurants are well represented and are scattered throughout the city. Other cuisines such as Sri Lankan, Russian and Afghani can also be found.

==Drink==

===Coffee===

Melbourne has a long and rich coffee culture beginning with Victorian era coffee palaces and further enhanced by Italian migrants arriving in the aftermath of World War II.

Perhaps the most famous Italian style cafe is Pellegrini's, 66 Bourke St, Melbourne city. [[Melbourne/Fitzroy|Fitzroy]] is known for funky, bohemian-style cafes. [[Melbourne/Central|Collins Street]] features many elegant cafes. Many Italian style cafes are found in [[Melbourne/Carlton|Carlton]]; '''Brunetti's''' is open late and always packed.

Serious espresso connoisseurs would enjoy visiting St Ali cafe/roastery in South Melbourne, Auction Rooms (Errol St) in North Melbourne, or the Maling Room café in Canterbury.

===Bars and Clubs===

Melbourne nightlife is  24 hours, loud, colourful and anything goes. Door policies can be strict but once inside high quality entertainment is guaranteed. DJ's, live music, artists, beautiful people and so much more can be found. There truly is something for everyone and every taste. It has a massive live music scene, with many inner-suburbs pubs catering many genres, with drink and food specials all week. The key is to find one you like the most!

Alongside its many clubs, Melbourne is also a fast-rising festival city.  Global event companies such as ID&T, Global Gathering, Ministry of Sound and Trance Energy have begun taking notice of the city and bringing their events. Upcoming electronic music events are well catalogued on www.inthemix.com.au

The city centre has a number of pubs, the most famous being the Young and Jackson.  Melbourne is also famous for its many trendy bars in the CBD.  Most of these, however, are down narrow alleys and streets, and are therefore hard to find unless you know where you are going.

The inner northern suburbs, such as Collingwood and Fitzroy cater for the young, laid-back, and bohemian crowd.  Here you will find lots of live music, cheaper prices, and a relaxed atmosphere. Head for Brunswick and Gertrude Streets in Fitzroy and Smith Street, Collingwood for cafes, bars and live music, while Lygon Street, Carlton has a range of Italian restaurants and cafes with a student vibe, as it's located near the University of Melbourne. Victoria Street, North Richmond is the heart of Melbourne's Vietnamese community, with many cheap and cheerful restaurants serving good food.

Chapel Street/ Toorak Road in South Yarra and Prahran has the most glamourous bars and clubs.  Here, expect high prices, strict dress codes, and beautiful people who want to be seen partying with the best.  
St. Kilda has a little bit of everything.  With its proximity to the beach, it is often regarded as the Melbourne suburb that feels most like Sydney.

The past decade has seen a revival of Melbourne's inner-city bar scene, with dozens of weird and wonderful watering holes opening up within forgotten alleyways and anonymous lanes of the [[Melbourne/Central|City Centre (CBD)]]. Melbourne also has its fair share of stylish places to drink, although the better ones can be hard to find. The theory seems to be: the harder your bar is to find, the more people will talk about it. Secrets are tucked around areas like [[Melbourne/Prahran|Prahran]], South Yarra and many other areas.  However there are plenty of alleyway bars, once you find one they seem to pop up everywhere you look. Melbourne's clubs often market a members only rule which can upset your more upmarket traveler. The rule is in place to prevent fighting and unappealing groups of men from entering a nice club and destroying the atmosphere.

Australian licensing laws are very similar to those in the UK, i.e. you are not allowed to be drunk on licensed premises. Some pubs and clubs are quicker to eject patrons than others, but it's only ever a short walk to another. Licensing is more liberal then what one may be used to, as you can still expect to find a drink past 2AM.  This has lead to a culture of late night drinking where some venues won't get busy until some time after 11PM, especially true during summer. 

Melburnians often draw a distinction between 'bars', meaning the small watering holes described above, and 'pubs' which are larger establishments in the usual Australian or British sense of the word. Melbourne's pubs, particularly those in the city and inner suburbs, usually serve restaurant-standard food and a wide range of local and imported beers.  Pubs usually offer lunch from approximately midday to 2PM, and reopen their kitchens for dinner from approximately 6PM-10pm

===Water===
Water from the taps is perfectly safe to drink. Melbourne has some of the best tap water in the world, so save your money, the environment and drink tap water. Many suburbs have drinking fountains, in which you can fill up your bottle.

==Sleep==
[[File:Hotel Lindrum Melbourne - MGallery.jpg|thumb|upright|Hotel Lindrum]]
There is a great range of accommodation in Melbourne, ranging from hostels with shared dorm rooms and bathrooms to luxurious, palatial boutique or international chain hotels. Most convenient options are located within the [[Melbourne/Central|CBD]], though several suburbs close to the city centre also offer accommodation options. Airbnb is also prevalent.

===Budget===
Melbourne's budget accommodation options can be found in two main areas, namely in the [[Melbourne/Central|City Centre]] and in the seaside suburb of [[Melbourne/St Kilda|St Kilda]]. Within the city centre, most hostels are clustered around Elizabeth Street or King Street. Outside of the city, there are also several popular budget options in bohemian [[Melbourne/Fitzroy|Fitzroy]], [[Melbourne/South Melbourne|South Melbourne]], and [[Melbourne/Prahran|Prahran]].

Please note that around the Melbourne F1 Grand Prix (late March) and other international events, hostel accommodation is often booked out ahead of time and some hostels raise their prices. Be sure to book ahead.

===Mid-range===
Accommodation in this price bracket can mostly be found in the [[Melbourne/Central|city centre]]. There are however options scattered throughout the suburbs.

===Splurge===
The [[Melbourne/Central|City Centre]] remains the main area for this category of accommodation.

==Contact==

===Post===

[[Image:GPO (1).jpg|thumb|230px|Melbourne's old GPO]] 

After a fire gutted the original building in 2001, most of Melbourne's grand General Post Office (250 Elizabeth St; ☎: 13 13 18; Fax: 9203 3078; M-F 8:30AM-5:30PM, Sa 9AM-4PM, Su 10AM-4PM; [http://www.australiapost.com.au]) has now been turned into an upmarket retail precinct. The main post office in the Melbourne CBD is situated at the corner of Elizabeth and Little Bourke Streets. Poste restante services are now located in a small post office at 380 Bourke St.

===Phone===

Payphones are easily found through the city, but many are being phased out due to growing mobile phone ownership. These phones are coin-operated or use prepaid Phonecards, which are available from most convenience stores or newsagents. International calling cards are also available at these outlets. Using a payphone to make a local call will cost you $0.50 (untimed, although some phones limit your call to 15 minutes).

Mobile phone coverage within the CBD and surrounds is usually good-to-excellent. All mobile carriers in Melbourne use GSM 850/1900, and UMTS 2100 is offered by all carriers except Telstra, who instead offer UMTS 850. By law, you will require some identification to purchase a prepaid (PAYG) SIM card which are sold at most convenience stores, newsagents and supermarkets. This may be requested at time of purchase, and/or time of activation.

The mobile carriers are Telstra, Optus and Vodafone; all other companies use one of these networks. For better value, use Amaysim or Optus Connect 4 Less or Aldi mobile, If you wish to make cheap international calls, Lebara and lycamobile are the best choices. All carriers have good coverage in Melbourne suburban areas and on major highways/towns in Victoria, with Telstra (or resellers such as Aldi) having the most coverage.

Melbourne's area code for landline telephones is 03 (internationally dial +613). To make an international direct dial call, the trunk line access code is generally 0011 or simply add a + in front of the number if your phone allows.

===Internet===

Internet cafes are dotted throughout the city, especially near the backpacker enclaves of St Kilda and Flinders Street. Speeds are usually excellent and rates range from $2.50-12 per hour, the cheapest usually found in combination market/internet cafes in the Asian parts of town.

==Stay safe==

The Australia-wide emergency number is 000, with the ambulance service, fire department and police being available through this number.

Melbourne is consistently ranked amongst the 10 safest cities in the world by the Safe Cities Index. It can occasionally attract the opposite reputation within Australia due to media beat-ups, however it is unlikely visitors will encounter any crime and normal safety precautions are recommended. 

Use slightly higher amounts of caution (particularly late at night) in Melbourne's red-light districts include King Street, known for its concentration of strip clubs, and certain parts of St Kilda (in particular Grey Street, Inkerman Street and Greeves Street) where there is some illegal street prostitution. Incidents of fist fights and 'coward punches' have been occurring more often around pubs and clubs at night, so use caution particularly when drinking alcohol in entertainment districts and avoid escalating situations. The best advice is to always walk away from confrontation, and seek out a busier area if there's trouble.

Generally speaking, take care walking late at night anywhere in Melbourne. Things can get very quiet once businesses close, there isn't a late night shopping culture like in Asia, and you really need to think twice before walking through deserted alleyways at 2am. Few people have any issues, but things do happen so you need to be aware.

Railway police (known as PSOs) patrol most services at night, helping to ensure robberies and alterations on public transport remain rare. If these do occur, it will usually be late at night and often in outer suburbs. Most inner-city stations are also monitored and staffed around the clock helping to ensure safety. As with any city, it is best to closely monitor your possessions on crowded transport. Sexual assaults have unfortunately risen in the last two years on public transport, so women need to exercise caution late at night.

Take '''extreme care''' when crossing tram tracks in and around Melbourne. Trams tend run very fast in Melbourne to avoid disruption with the traffic. There have been recent cases of pedestrians being hit by trams, which can cause life-threatening injuries or even instant death. Even if a tram has passed, look on the other side in case there is another tram approaching. You may not hear the more modern trams as they run fast.

Driving under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs is a '''very''' serious offence in Victoria, and it is common for police to set up checkpoints (referred to as a 'booze-bus') and breath test any driver who passes through them. These tests always test for alcohol and also occasionally for illicit drugs. Like the rest of Australia, Melbourne enforces a '''0.05%''' blood alcohol concentration (BAC) limit. Such checkpoints often increase (as does a general police presence) during public holidays such as Australia Day, the Easter weekend and the weeks leading up to Christmas and New Years. 

Melbourne has a strong police presence, as does the remainder of Victoria. Police in Melbourne and throughout Australia are extremely helpful, honest, respectful and reliable. Police will nearly always treat you how you treat them and remaining respectful at all times is recommended. It is sometimes possible to receive a warning for a minor offence (in place of a  fine) by showing contrition and respect for the Officer. Never attempt to bribe a police officer in Melbourne, or the rest of Australia.

==Get out==
Melbourne is fairly centrally located on the coast of [[Victoria (state)|Victoria]], and there are many natural and man-made attractions that make for a nice day trip.  Another way to visit regional Victoria is utilising the '''VicLink''' public transport system.  Regular train journeys leave from Southern Cross station.  Regional attractions include:

===Melbourne outskirts===
