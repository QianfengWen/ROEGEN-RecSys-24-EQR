[http://www.gotobermuda.com/ '''Bermuda'''] is a self-governing [[United Kingdom|British]] overseas territory in the Atlantic Ocean north of the [[Caribbean]], off the coast of [[North America]] east of [[South Carolina]]. It is one of the last remains of the once vast British colonial empire in North America.

==Parishes==

===Topography===

Bermuda consists of about 138 islands and islets, with all the major islands aligned on a hook-shaped, but roughly east-west, axis and connected together by road bridges. Despite this complexity, Bermudians usually refer to Bermuda as "the island". In terms of terrain, the islands are composed of low hills separated by fertile depressions, and interspersed with a complex set of waterways. 

The inhabited island chain is actually the southern sector of a circular pseudo-atoll, the remainder of the coral ring being submerged or inter-tidal reefs (Bermuda was formed volcanically but is not a true atoll). As a result the northern shores of inhabited islands are relatively sheltered, whilst the southern shores are exposed to the ocean swell. Consequently most of the best beaches are on the southern shore.

===Climate===

Bermuda has a subtropical climate, with hot and humid weather from spring through fall, however daytime temps fall to the upper 10s °C in wintertime, with wintertime lows of around 14 °C. Rarely do temperatures fall below 12 °C. The water also cools down into the 10s °C in the wintertime. Humidity remains high in the wintertime. For almost half the year (April to Sept) the UV index is over 8.

===History===

Bermuda was first settled in 1609 by shipwrecked English colonists headed for the infant English colony of [[Virginia]]. The first industry on the islands was fruit and vegetable cultivation to supply the early American colonies. The islands took a carefully unofficial role during the American War of Independence, with much of Washington's armaments coming from a covert (and likely locally complicit) raid on the island's arsenal. After US independence and during the Napoleonic wars, Great Britain found itself without access to the ports now on the US east coast. Because of this situation and Bermuda's convenient location between British Canada and Britain's Caribbean possessions, Bermuda became the principal stopover point for the British Royal Navy's Atlantic fleet, somewhat similar to Gibraltar.

The American Civil War and American Prohibition both added considerably to the island's coffers, with Bermuda forming an important focal point in running the blockades in both cases. During the Second World War, a large US air base was built on the islands and remained operational until 1995, and Bermuda served as the main intercept centre for transatlantic cable messages to and from occupied Europe.

Tourist travel to Bermuda to escape North American winters first developed in Victorian times. Tourism continues to be important to the island's economy, although international business has surpassed it in recent years, turning Bermuda into a highly successful offshore financial centre. 

In 1968, Bermuda gained a constitution, but the British Government determined that Bermuda was not ready for independence, eventually making Bermuda a British Dependent Territory in 1981. A referendum on independence was soundly defeated in 1995. For many, Bermudian independence would mean little other than the obligation to staff foreign missions and embassies around the world, which can be an onerous obligation for Bermuda's small population.

===Cup Match===

The Thursday (Emancipation Day) and Friday (Somer's Day) before the first Monday in August are when Somerset and St. George play cricket, a tradition since 1901. '''Almost all businesses, including tourist attractions, shut down''' and large numbers of tents appear throughout the islands on beaches and roadsides. It's a four-day weekend, Bermuda-style. Bermudians make the most of it, sporting their team's colours, feasting and even doing some legalized gambling with their "Crown and Anchor" dice game.

==Get in== 

'''All visitors do not need a visa''' for stays of up to 90 days (extendable for up to 6 months), just a passport (or US Passport Card if arriving on a cruise ship) valid for 45 days after intended departure and either a work permit or return or onward tickets. However, some requirements are still in place:
*Citizens and permanent residents of [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] need only a valid passport and return or onward tickets.
*All other foreigners who are not entitled to right of abode, freedom of movement or visa-free travel rights in the above countries will be required to present a valid visa for any of the above countries upon arrival. This is because such nationals will need to transit and return through the US, UK or Canada.

One of Bermuda's few taxes is its steep import ''duty''. This varies depending on the item and the importer. Some items are tax-exempt when brought in for personal use (books, educational materials). The duty on cars is fixed to their value. If the price of the vehicle before it is landed is less than $10,000, the duty is 80%. For cars costing $10,000 or greater, before landing, the duty is 100%. The dealer must add his own profit margin on top of this. Each person arriving on the island is allowed a $100 exemption, but visitors deemed to be carrying more than that amount will be subject to the duty on the excess value.

===By plane===

*[http://www.bermudaairport.com/ '''Bermuda L.F. Wade International Airport'''] ({{IATA|BDA}}), Phone +1 441 293-2470.
[https://www.aa.com/homePage.do?locale=en_US American Airlines], [https://www.delta.com/ Delta], [https://www.jetblue.com/ JetBlue] and United operate daily flights from [[Atlanta]], [[Boston]], [[Newark (New Jersey)|Newark]], [[New York City|New York]], [[Philadelphia]] and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], together with seasonal flights from [[Charlotte]].
[http://aircanada.com/ Air Canada] and [http://westjet.com/ WestJet] operate frequent flights from [[Toronto]].
[http://britishairways.com/ British Airways] fly from [[London]] (Heathrow).

There is a $25 airport tax for all passengers. Bermuda's Airport has the world's highest landing/parking fee for airlines, so the overall price for the air ticket (including all taxes) is considerably higher than for many Caribbean destinations.

Arriving passengers will need to pass through Immigration and Customs. Importation of narcotics and weapons (including all guns, ammunition, and catapults) is strictly prohibited, as is the import of any live marine animals, snakes or plants.

The airport is situated in St. George's Parish, adjacent to Castle Harbour, and nearer [[Saint George (Bermuda)|St George's]] than [[Hamilton (Bermuda)|Hamilton]] (though no part of Bermuda is far from any other). If you are arriving on an inclusive tour, then your tour operator will probably have arranged onward transportation to your hotel by private bus. The airport is well served by local public buses, but unfortunately these will not accept luggage. The bus only takes cash fare in coins.

An [https://www.limobermuda.com/ceo/ Airport Shuttle] can be booked for $10-$15 to take visitors to one of four hotels. It doesn't appear as though you have to be a guest at the hotel in order to reserve and ride but the hotel will be used as a drop-off or pick-up point. The shuttle must be booked online (or using their US toll-free number) in advance and has staff at a desk outside the airport. While there is a visitor information centre at the airport, it is unmanned and thus no bus tickets packs or transportation passes can be purchased at the airport, the closest visitor's information centre is an hour's walk away at the St. George's ferry terminal.

Taxis are available at the airport; depending on time of arrival and destination they may cost up to $50. Rates to and from the airport are set and posted. Hire cars are not available (see 'Get around' below).

It is possible to walk from the airport, however it should be noted that the bridge across the Causeway toward Hamilton is one lane each way with no sidewalk or shoulder. Despite this, Bermuda drivers are patient and considerate of pedestrians and will wait for an opening in traffic in the opposing direction before passing and many joggers and walkers walk this bridge.  Walking the Causeway may be a smart option if you are staying at Grotto Bay and don't want to pay the +$10 taxi fare that's less than a quarter mile.

US Customs and Immigration pre-clearance is done in Bermuda prior to boarding your flight home. This allows for easy domestic connections on arrival in the USA.

===By boat/yacht===
Bermuda receives many visits from [[cruise ships]] during the summer months, with most ships operating from the ports of [[Baltimore]], [[Boston]], [[Bayonne (New Jersey)|Bayonne]], [[New York City|New York]], [[Charleston]], [[Norfolk (Virginia)|Norfolk]], Miami/Ft Lauderdale, and [[Philadelphia]] on the eastern seaboard of the [[United States]].

The same immigration and customs rules apply as for arrival by air (above).

There are three different locations cruise ships may stop at in Bermuda, and some vessels visit more than one of these in a single cruise:
*'''[[Hamilton (Bermuda)|Hamilton]]'''. Cruise ships berth here alongside Front Street, one of the main streets of Bermuda's capital. Passengers here have access to the shops and restaurants of Hamilton, and can reach the rest of the islands using the bus and ferry systems described in 'Get About' below.
*'''[[Saint George (Bermuda)|Saint George]]'''. Cruise ships berth near the main square of the small town and historic former capital. Passengers can reach Hamilton and Flatts Village directly by bus, and other locations by changing in Hamilton.
*'''Royal Naval Dockyard, Ireland Island'''. This berth is situated in the historic naval dockyard complex at the extreme 'western' end of the island beyond [[Somerset (Bermuda)|Somerset]]. This is currently the only location in Bermuda that can accommodate the largest of cruise ships. Passengers can reach Hamilton directly by bus or ferry, and other locations by changing there.

Bermuda is a favourite, if challenging destination for off-shore yacht crews. Crossing from the US mainland or the Azores can take up to 3 weeks in the notorious calm of summer. The rest of the year there might be too much wind: nor'easters to hurricanes. Another hazard: lots of floating debris from sunken ships and the hurricanes of the the last few years. Within a 200 nautical mile radius from Bermuda collisions with solid objects are frequent and often deadly. 

Yachts have to clear in Bermuda Customs and Immigration at St George. Only bargain left in the islands: bring your own boat and anchor, moor or dock for free in all the islands' coves for up to 6 months. Check in is only $15 per person ($10 cheaper than by air).

==Get around==

===By bus & ferry===

The islands benefit from an excellent and frequent bus service, which connects all parts of the islands to [[Hamilton (Bermuda)|Hamilton]]. The buses are air conditioned and used equally by locals, visitors, and cruise passengers. When catching a bus, look out for the pink and blue painted poles which denote bus stops; pink indicates buses heading into Hamilton; blue heading out from Hamilton. Note that buses will not accept passengers with a lot of luggage. If you plan to get around by bus, note that some buses run every 15 minutes on weekdays, while others run every 30 minutes. Holiday, weekend and weekday evening (after 6:30pm) schedules are less frequent, typically once an hour. If you are going to a popular cruise destination, the bus may be standing room only or even unavailable due to full capacity. So plan accordingly.

There are also passenger ferries which ply the waters of Hamilton Harbour and the Great Sound, and are a great way of getting to Somerset and the Dockyard. There is also a ferry service between the Dockyard and St. George. See the schedule, as depending on your stop (the pink line, for example) the ferry runs every hour or less frequently.

The public transport fares are determined by zone, and the drivers and ferry staff are helpful in letting you know whether you need a short ride or long ride ticket. You can also use 2 short ride tickets if needed for a longer ride. 
Rather than buying a pass or a ticket on the bus, the most cost effective option for many visitors would be to buy a sheet of 15 transportation tickets for $25 (short rides) or $37.50 (longer rides) from the ferry station, any post office or the bus terminal in Hamilton. Each ticket covers a single bus or ferry ride for $2.50, quite a lot cheaper than the cash fare.

If buying a ticket at the time of travel, a one-way bus or ferry trip costs $5.00, with short bus journeys costing $3.50. Cash fares on the buses are coins only, no change given.

Transportation passes valid on both buses and ferries are available for unlimited use for periods of 1 to 7 days and cost $19-62, with one month and three-month passes for longer-term visitors and residents available.

If you intend to connect to another bus, or to a ferry from Hamilton to St. Georges, ask the driver for a free transfer ticket when getting off the bus. You will then have 15 minutes to make your transfer, unless the next bus is less frequent than every 15 minutes, in which case you must board the next bus.

Schedules for bus and ferry can be found [http://www.gov.bm/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_2_11846_311_1794_43/http%3B/ptpublisher.gov.bm%3B7087/publishedcontent/publish/gov__top_level__org__house_/govt_home_left_nav/bus_and_ferry_schedules.html here].

===By taxi===

Taxis are another easy way of getting around the islands. They are available at taxi stands on Front St. in Hamilton, at the major hotels or by phone. All taxis are fitted with a meter and charge $6.40 for first mile plus $2.25 for each subsequent mile. There is a 25% surcharge on Sundays.  If not in Hamilton, you can always flag one down on a major road or call to have one pick you up. 

With many services in Bermuda, but especially with taxis (though not with buses and ferries, which are very punctual), there is a concept of "Bermuda Time." You may find that when you call for a taxi to pick you up, they may not be as prompt as you would like. This may mean waiting an extra ten minutes, but remember that Bermuda is not at all fast-paced like many cities, it is much more laid back and relaxed here.

===On foot===

Walking as a means of transportation may be a challenge depending upon your location. Hamilton has side walks and crosswalks, and is easy to navigate. However, if you are staying at other locations, such as a guesthouse in a residential area, walking can be dangerous. In many locations, there are no sidewalks, so walking means on the narrow road with buzzing cars and mopeds. Roads are narrow and often butt up against a stone wall, with barely enough room for two cars. Do not assume it is an easy walk to a bus or ferry stop, store or beach. That may or may not be true.

===By bicycle/moped/e-scooter===

Until the arrival of the US military during the Second World War, cars were entirely banned from these islands. Even now, most hire cars (rental cars) are banned with the exception of the [https://www.currentvehicles.com/ smallest electric cars], and only residents are permitted to own cars - limit one per household! Bicycles, mopeds, and [https://www.grabawhip.com/ e-scooters] are available for hire, and are heavily used by locals and visitors alike. Depending on where you are staying, a moped may be your best way to get around (if you plan to use alternative transportation (bus or ferry), carefully investigate how far you are from the nearest stop). If you wish to use mopeds, rentals are very common, regulated and priced competitively, 

Travel is on the left hand side of the road (opposite to the US and Canada). Road signs are based on the ones used in the [[United Kingdom]]; however, the vast majority of signs use kilometres as the unit of measurement. The national speed limit is 35 km/h (22 mph), which is lower in built-up and other congested areas. "Road Rash" is a very common affliction affecting many. Furthermore, the roads are very tight one-lane roads, many without sidewalks (making walking dangerous) and many with many 'odd' intersections such as roundabouts (traffic circles), and 'triangular intersections' joining three roads.

==See==
There are surprisingly large number of excellent sightseeing places in this 53.3km² tiny island. 

Main Sightseeing Attractions : 

* [[Saint George (Bermuda)|'''Town of St. George''']]. A scenic [[UNESCO World Heritage List|UNESCO World Heritage Site]] and the oldest, continually inhabited British settlement in the New World.

There is a Tea Room at its base offering drinks and light fare.
* '''Dockland Glassworks''', You can watch glass blowing at The Dockland Glassworks. They have a seated area where people can watch some beautiful crafts being made.

==Do==

===Swim===
Go to one of Bermuda's lovely pink sandy beaches.  Keep in mind that some of the beaches do not have any shade, nor umbrellas to rent, so it can get quite sunny and hot. 

*'''Horseshoe Bay Beach''', Southampton Parish. Beautiful pink sand beach bordered by rocky areas suitable for snorkelling. Probably the most photographed (and most popular) Bermudian beach. Be aware that it may be crowded with cruise ship tourists, whose number one stop is often this beach. The surf can get rough at times here. There are bathroom facilities, beach rentals, and food concessions. Lifeguards in summer.  Be sure to look for the impressive sea caves and tunnels.
*'''Day Cruises''', Day cruises will give travellers the opportunity to discover the wide variety of sea life that dwells in Bermuda's crystal-clear waters. The trip takes you to 2-3 different locations to get closer to the reefs and noted shipwrecks. Jessie James Cruises.
* '''Elbow Beach''', Tribe Road #4, Paget Parish. Another beautiful pink sand beach between Coral Beach, Elbow Beach and Coco Reef hotels.
* '''Tobacco Bay''', St. George Parish. A boulder-sheltered, shallow, warm-water beach which can become quite crowded with cruise ship passengers. Can be reached on foot from St. George square or shuttles are readily available. Another walk will take you to nearby Fort St. Catherine. Rest rooms, food concession, beach rentals.
* '''Achilles Bay / St. Catherine's Bay''', Northeastern St. George Parish. Can be reached on foot from St. George square or shuttles are readily available. Adjacent to Fort St. Catherine. Rest rooms, food concession nearby, beach rentals.
* '''Clearwater Beach / Turtle Beach / Turtle Bay / Long Bay / Well Bay / Soldier Bay''', in St. David's near the eastern end of the airport runway. Located on former US Air Base lands used for NASA tracking station at Cooper's Island.  Rest rooms, food concession and bar. Children's playground. Lifeguards during the summer months.
* '''John Smith's Bay Beach''', Hamilton Parish. Nice pink sand beach. Summer lifeguards. Usually a mobile food concession.
* '''Shelly Bay''', North Shore Road, Hamilton Parish. Lots of shallow water and a large playground make this great choice for families with small kids. Not far from Flatts Village and the Bermuda Aquarium, Museum and Zoo. Restrooms, beach rentals, food concession.
* '''Chaplin Bay / Stonehole Bay / Warwick Long Bay''', South Road, Warwick Parish.  Warwick Long Bay is a very large beach.  It's less popular than the other large beaches due to its relatively steep sand slope, and strong undercurrent.  Chaplin and Stonehole bays, along with the accompanying Jonson's Cove, are pristine, picture postcard settings.  They are made up of small and medium sized sandy inlets.   
*'''Snorkel Park''', Royal Naval Dockyard, 234-6989. A limestone tunnel through the keep's wall puts you on the beachfront for snorkelling or water sports. This is often a popular stop for passengers coming off the cruise ships and reluctant to leave the Dockyard area.

===Golf===
Bermuda has many golf courses  and driving ranges spread out along its length.

*'''St. George Golf Course''', St. George Parish, north of the Town of St. George.
*'''Tuckers Point Golf Course / Mid Ocean Golf Course''', St. George Parish, near Tucker's Town.
*'''Ocean View Golf Course''', Devonshire Parish on northern shore.
*'''Horizons Golf Course''', Paget Parish south-west. (9 holes)
*'''Belmont Hills Golf Course''', Warwick Parish east.
*'''Riddell's Bay Golf and Country Club''', Warwick Parish west.
*'''Fairmont Southampton Princess Golf Course''', Southampton Parish east. 
*'''Port Royal Golf Course''', Southampton Parish west.
*'''Bermuda Golf Academy and Driving Range''', Southampton Parish west.

===Explore===
'''Bermuda Railway Trail'''

The bed of the former Bermuda Railway which was dismantled in 1948 after 17 years of service. Many sections still exist as a public walking trail stretching from St. George Town in the east end, through Pembroke Parish near the City of Hamilton and on toward Somerset Village in the west end. Many station houses, trestle footings and railway ties can be found. It offers spectacular views of the island and waters along its length.

'''Bermuda Forts'''

Bermuda has many examples of large fortifications and smaller batteries spread throughout the island which were built between 1612 after first settlement and manned until 1957. For its small size the island had approximately 100 fortifications built. Many have been restored, primarily the larger ones, and are open to the public with dioramas and displays. Many have their original cannons in place. Some lie on outlying islands and islets and can only be accessed via boat, or have been incorporated into private properties and resorts. Some of those which can be accessed are:
*'''Fort St. Catherine''' , St. George Parish north (has displays and dioramas and replica Crown Jewels)
*'''Gates Fort''', St. George Parish east (guarding Town Cut channel entrance)
*'''Alexandra Battery''', St. George Parish east
*'''Fort George''', St. George Parish (overlooking the Town of St. George)
*'''St. David's Battery''', St. George Parish east
*'''Martello Tower / Ferry Island Fort''', St. George Parish west (at Ferry Reach)
*'''King's Castle / Devonshire Redoubt / Landward Fort''', St. George Parish south (on Castle Island, accessed via boat)
*'''Fort Hamilton''', Pembroke Parish (overlooking the City of Hamilton)
*'''Whale Bay Battery''', Southampton Parish west.
*'''Fort Scaur''', Sandys Parish (overlooking the waters of the Great Sound)
*'''The Keep at the Dockyard''', Sandys Parish (within the Maritime Museum)

'''Royal Naval Dockyard'''

The sprawling stone building that were the former naval base to Bermuda now houses several different sites and attractions, including a pub located in the old Cooperage, or barrel-making facility; The Maritime Museum, offering the most extensive look at Bermudian history on all of the islands; or many shops located in the former naval administration building.  Now known as the [[Clocktower Mall]], these small shops offer many different speciality souvenir options exclusive to Bermuda such as fine linens and jewellery.  Located just off of [[King’s Wharf]], visitors coming off of cruise ships may find the Royal Naval Dockyard to be an appealing option because of its close proximity to the docks and the accommodations.  

'''Victoria Park'''

Located in [[Hamilton]], this public park is the home to many concerts in the summer months on the bandstand, which was established in 1899 and completely restored in 2008.  Visit one of the several flower gardens, walk on the paths or sit on one of the many benches under the trees.  Public restrooms are available nearby and the location is prime, between several of the busy streets of the capital. In the summer, expect frequent concerts on the bandstand during the day and into the evening hours, food vendors, and other attractions for both adults and children.  Conveniently for tourists, the main bus station of the city is located one block over from the park. Open daily sunrise to sunset.

'''Aquariums'''

The Devil’s Hole aquarium, located in [[Tucker’s Town]], has since closed, leaving the Bermuda National Aquarium and Zoo as the sole aquatic life centre in Bermuda.  Expect to see a variety of water and land animals nursed back to health after being found in danger on the shores of Bermuda.  This zoo/aquarium is unique because visitors can walk into the habitats of the animals due to the small nature of the facility.

'''Sports'''

Besides a large variety of golf resorts available, Bermuda also offers unique sporting activities to its visitors:
*'''Somerset Bridge Watersports''' has Jet Ski Tours, kayaks and boat rentals available with friendly staff members to assist.
*'''Spiceland Riding Centre''' offers horseback rides on a trail and the beaches.  Located in the [[Warwick Parish]]. 
*'''K.S. Waterspots''' in [[St. George’s]] is conveniently located steps from the cruise docking.  Offering both jetskiing and parasailing, this is an excellent option for those who don’t wish to go far from their cruise ship.
*'''Bermuda Squash Racquets Association''' asks for a $15 fee for non-members to play.  Located in [[Devonshire]], this squash club also offers training, membership and coaching for visitors who have a longer stay.
*'''Bermuda Fun Golf''' offers miniature golf in [[Sandy’s Parish]].

==Buy==

Bermuda's currency is the '''Bermudian dollar''' (BMD, abbreviated '$'), which is divided into 100 cents. It comes in the same denominations and sizes as US currency, except there is a one dollar coin instead of a banknote.

The currency is directly tied to the US dollar at a rate of 1:1, so one US dollar always equals one Bermudan dollar. Therefore, US dollars are accepted everywhere in Bermuda at equal value, including at government institutions. 

Bermuda offers ATMs in several tourist locations, including the airport, [[St. George]], [[Somerset]], and [[Hamilton (Bermuda)|Hamilton]]. Most banks have ATMs as well. Some ATMs dispense US dollars; this will be clearly marked on a sign on or above the machine. Otherwise, it will dispense Bermuda dollars.

Though MasterCard and Visa debit and credit cards are frequently accepted, it is common for smaller hotels and bed and breakfasts to '''not''' accept them. Before booking, check with the hotel or bed and breakfast in order to ensure they accept credit cards if you plan to pay this way. Though most stores accept cards to accommodate tourists, many hotels and even larger resort areas do not. Gratuities are typically paid in cash as well.  

If changing money before coming to Bermuda, then change into US dollars. When you spend US currency in Bermuda, you may sometimes receive change in Bermudian currency, which you should spend or exchange before leaving. Otherwise, you will be stuck with it as a souvenir, as Bermuda dollars are not exchanged outside Bermuda. There is no currency exchange counter at Bermuda's airport (or anywhere in Bermuda). Only Bermuda banks can exchange Bermuda dollars into foreign currency, for a 1% tax and a 0.5% service fee.

===Costs===

Bermuda can be '''expensive'''. Because of Bermuda's steep import tax, all goods sold in stores that come from off the island carry a significant mark-up. When buying groceries or other (non-souvenir) items of that nature, be aware that the best prices are usually away from the more "touristy" areas. For example, one cup of yoghurt might cost about $1.60 at a grocery store near hotels; it will cost 25% less at a grocery store further from the tourist attractions, and only 10 cents more than in the United States. When buying these sort of things, ''go to where the locals go''.

===Shopping===

A nice assortment of stores exists in [[Hamilton (Bermuda)|Hamilton]], especially on Front Street. The area can be explored easily by foot. Front Street, is one of the main shopping streets, and is facing the harbour. In recent years, two of the largest and oldest department stores on Front Street have closed. However, A.S. Coopers, first established in 1897, remains.

Shopping can also be found in the easily walked town of St George as well as in Dockyard, which has a small shopping mall. Smaller stores can be found throughout the island offering a variety of goods.

==Eat== 
Two relatively unique Bermudian dishes are salted codfish, boiled with potatoes, the traditional Sunday breakfast, and Hoppin' John, a simple dish of boiled rice and black-eyed peas. Shark hash was made, fish cakes were traditional on Fridays, hotcross buns at Easter, and cassava or farine pies at Christmas. With the high-end tourist market, great effort has been expended by hotel and restaurant chefs in developing an ostensibly 'traditional Bermudian cuisine', although this has usually meant adapting other cuisines, from West Indian to Californian, in line with the expectations of visiting clientèle. Most pubs serve a typical British Pub fare, although the number of these establishments has diminished as premises are lost to development, or establishments are redeveloped to target the tourist market.  While lobster and other sea foods are often featured on the menu, virtually everything is imported from the US or Canada. If you want local fish, ask or look for "local" as opposed to "fresh."  

Restaurants and Dining Options 

Restaurants can be found all over the island, with the largest concentration in the city of [[Hamilton (Bermuda)|Hamilton]] and [[Saint George (Bermuda)|St George]] town. Also, there are several at some of the hotels and resorts which can be outstanding (or not) and pricey. 

NOTE:  Gratuity is included in the bill (15% or 17%) depending on the restaurant, so check your bill to avoid accidently tipping twice.

Remember that with most restaurants, the closer you are to the cruise ship docks, the more expensive the menu will be. Most cruise ship passengers have a short time in which to experience Bermuda, and if they don't eat on the ship, most will be reluctant to leave the town to eat. The restaurants in proximity to the cruise ship docks in, say, St. George's can be as much as three times as expensive as a comparable one in, say, Somerset Village.

===Local dishes===
Local specialities include:
*'''Cassava pie'''. Farine is an alternate base. Traditionally eaten at Christmas, but becoming more commonly found in local markets year round.
*'''Bay grape jelly'''. Bay grapes were introduced as a wind break. Although, like Surinam cherries and loquats, they are found throughout Bermuda, and produce edible fruit, none of these plants are cultivated for agriculture in Bermuda, and their fruits are normally eaten from the tree, primarily by school children.
*'''Bermuda Bananas''' which are smaller and sweeter than others, are often eaten on Sunday mornings with codfish and potatoes.
*'''Fish''' is eaten widely in the form of local tuna, wahoo, and rockfish.  Local fish is a common feature on restaurant menus across the island.
*'''Fish Chowder''' seasoned with sherry pepper sauce and dark rum is a favourite across the island.
*'''Shark Hash'''.  Minced shark meat mixed with spices and served on bread
* '''Sweet Potato Pudding'''.  is made from sweet potatoes, spices, and fresh orange juice.  Served frequently during the holidays
*'''Codfish Brunch'''.  is a popular traditional Bermudian breakfast consisting of codfish that is boiled with potatoes and Bermuda (English) onions, as well as sliced Bermudian bananas. Expect to see this speciality dish at restaurants and bed and breakfasts during the weekend.

==Drink==

The drinking age in Bermuda is '''18'''.

Bermuda has two popular drinks:

*'''Rum Swizzle''' which is a rum cocktail made of Demerera Rum (amber rum) and Jamaican Rum (dark rum) along with an assortment of citrus juices. Sometimes brandy is added to the mixture as well. Note, it is quite strong. According to local lore, it was named after the ''Swizzle Inn'' (although ''swizzle'' [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?l=s&p=52]] is a term that originated in England, possibly in the 18th Century) where it was said to be developed.
*'''Dark n' Stormy''' is a ''highball'' of Gosling's ''Black Seal'', a dark blend of local rums, mixed with Barritt's ''Bermuda Stone Ginger Beer''.

Both drinks are comparatively  very sweet.

==Sleep==

Accommodation in Bermuda is typically quite expensive. The high cost of accommodation (and airfares) can make a vacation there from twice to five times as expensive as a similar experience in the Caribbean.  However, there are excellent options available.   There are many exclusive and four star accommodations.  Some "private beach clubs" offer rooms to tourists, enabling you to use their beach/pool/tennis/exercise facilities during your stay.

Additionally, some businesses offer private homes, apartments and studios for short term rent such as Bermuda Accommodations Inc.  AirBnB was late coming to Bermuda but is becoming increasingly popular.

==Learn==
*'''Bermuda College''', Stonington Av, South Rd, Paget, 441-236-9000, [http://www.bercol.bm]. Bermuda's lone college.
*'''Warwick Academy''', '''Saltus Grammar School''', and the '''Bermuda High School for Girls''' are some of the few private high schools located on the island.

==Talk==

The official language is '''English''', which is written using British spelling. English in Bermuda is spoken with a distinctive accent not really similar to the Caribbean; to Americans, it sounds slightly English, while those from the British Isles find it more American.

Portuguese is the second most widely spoken language in Bermuda, spoken mainly by migrants from the Azores, Madeira and the Cape Verde Islands, and their descendants.

==Stay safe==
===Crime===

Violent crime has become increasingly problematic in Bermuda but is mostly restricted to acts of retaliation between local gangs. Generally, crime levels are still low compared to other destinations in the Caribbean. Most crime as it relates to tourists is petty, such as robbery. Using common sense and similar precautions that one would take at home is usually sufficient enough to deter most thieves. 

Mopeds are very frequent targets for theft; make sure that you properly lock up any rented moped when leaving them unattended. When riding, do not place valuable items in the carry-basket unless they are secured - thieves have been known to ride next to tourists on mopeds and snatch purses and valuables.

Always lock your doors and windows before leaving your hotel or guest accommodation.

Note that Bermuda has no right to concealed weapons except for government officers.

===On the roads===

Rental mopeds are not recommended for inexperienced riders. Tourists using rental mopeds have a tendency to get into accidents due to the sometimes narrow roads as well as driving on the left hand side, which may take getting used to. Additionally, Bermuda has no highways and most roads have only one lane on each side, which means locals will overtake and pass if you are travelling at the speed limit. Using common sense and keeping calm in the traffic, which can appear quite close helps. 

===In case of emergency===

Dial 911 for all emergencies, (fire, police, and medical)

==Stay healthy==
Although it should go without saying, Bermuda can get very hot during the day, so sunscreen and a bottle of water is very handy for those venturing more than a short distance from their hotels.

Unlike the United Kingdom, there is no government-funded National Health Service in Bermuda. Health care in Bermuda is incredibly expensive, and is roughly at American standards. There is one hospital on the island, the King Edward VII Memorial, with emergency services, including a decompression chamber. Air Ambulance service is available to additional medical services on the East Coast of the US. As healthcare costs in Bermuda are expensive, it is wise to purchase traveller's insurance through a travel website or cruise line depending on how long you choose to stay. Most agents will be able to say whether any healthcare costs will be deducted immediately or upon returning home.

For minor issues or to purchase medication such as aspirin, stop by one of Bermuda’s many chain or independent pharmacy drug stores. Most are well-stocked, and are employed by friendly, knowledgeable pharmacists and staff who can assist with any questions. A well-known, reputable stop is The Phoenix Centre +1 (441) 279-5451 

Be wary of coral, especially in [[Snorkel Park]], as it is easy to cut yourself on the sharp edges.  Purchasing sandals or water shoes from one of the island’s many tourist shops or bringing them from home may be a wise choice.  Something else to be wary of is jellyfish.  If stung, apply a solution to neutralize the poison (typically a meat tenderizer) or seek medical attention immediately if breathing or consciousness are affected.

Because all drinking water in Bermuda is caught in tanks and neutralized by the lime rooftops of the houses and buildings, it is best to inquire with a hotel's manager or staff if the water is safe to drink.  If unsure, '''never''' assume it is safe, as the different bacteria in the water can vary depending on where you are staying. The differences of bacteria in the water in Bermuda in comparison to the water tourists are used to drinking may also cause stomach issues. Boiling the water or purchasing water neutralizing tablets are two ways to ensure the water is safe to drink.  

==Respect==
It is considered good manners when greeting someone, a shop assistant or the Premier, to say "good morning", "good afternoon" or "good evening" and to do the same when leaving them. This applies even in situations where you are the customer, such as when catching the bus or entering a store. It is considered rude and abrupt to ask a question or make a statement without first greeting them. Try to avoid talking about politics or religion unless you know the person very well.

Most Bermudians are very accommodating when it comes to helping out or answering any questions a visitor may have. Just stop someone on the street, or pop into any shop and ask.

In Bermuda, it is common for a tip to be included in your bill, whether hotel or restaurant.  However, in the event one is not, a 15% tip is customary.  Make sure to tip taxi drivers 10%, or even more if the driver is transporting tourists from the beaches to elsewhere.  It is not unheard of for drivers to turn passengers away if they are sandy or soaking wet. 

Local attitudes to LGBT+ people are tolerant, but conservative. Homosexuality was legalised in 1994, and same-sex weddings were previously legal between 2017 and 2022. Public displays of same-sex affection are often seen as taboo in Bermuda, even if they are allowed by law in private. The local gay community exists on a more low-key scale than elsewhere, with no gay specific venues at this time.
