'''Harar''' is an [[Old Towns|ancient city]] in eastern [[Ethiopia]]. Harar (sometimes spelled ''Harrar'' or ''Harer'') has a population of about 75,000. 

==Understand==
For centuries, Harar has been a major commercial centre, linked by the trade routes with the rest of Ethiopia, the entire Horn of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and through its ports to the outside world. The city is part of the famous Ethiopia Eastern Tourism Circuit, that includes Awash National Park, Babile Elephant Sanctuary, Kondudo Mountain with the Gursum Pearl Cave and Prison House of Lij Eyasu.

Harar Jugol has been included in the [[UNESCO World Heritage List]] in 2006 in recognition of its cultural heritage. It is considered '''the fourth holiest city of Islam''' with 82 mosques, three of which date from the 10th century, and 102 shrines.

==Get in==

===By bus===
There is a bus service from the capital, [[Addis Ababa]] and [[Dire Dawa]].

From [[Hargeisa]] in [[Somaliland]], hourly buses (2h, US$3 as of December 2017) run from near the Central Market (9°33'47"N 44°04'00"E) to the Wajale border. Once across, take a bajaj (5min, 5 birr) to the bus station, where you can connect to a minibus or bus to [[Jijiga]] (2h30, 90 birr). There may be multiple, extensive security checks on the road between Wajale and Jijiga, with security personnel emptying all of your bags on the desert floor. Once in Jijiga, frequent buses are available to Harar (3h, 50 birr).

===By plane===
*Harar is served by [[Dire Dawa]] international airport.

==Get around==
The blue and white minibuses and rental vehicles are available.

==See==

* A mansion that once housed the renowned French poet Arthur Rimbaud. The mansion is now converted to a museum.

*The old town is home to ninety-nine mosques and many more shrines, centred on Feres Magala square. 

*Notable buildings include Medhane Alem Cathedral and the sixteenth century Jamia Mosque. 

==Do==

* '''Feed the hyenas''', a tradition that's unique to Harar. The hyenas haven't attacked local livestock for almost a hundred years due to the villagers feeding them every night. The location of the feed changes frequently, so your best bet is to ask locals as to where it is on that given night. However, everyone becomes a tour guide once you are a tourist looking for something in particular, so it's better to ask your hotel or other travellers you meet where it is going to be that night. In October 2018, it was a fairly long walk out of the town (around 15 minutes) and it's better to have some company as the trail was poorly lit. Once you get to the hyenas, it's an incredible experience and well worth the journey to Harar alone, however the "hyena man" is a bit of a gruff customer who seems to be obsessed with the money. Don't pay more than 200 birr to feed the hyenas. Don't feed them from your mouth, as hyenas carry a lot of disease (you will see this for yourself on their faces). It might be quite hard to find a genuine guide to take you there that won't rip you off.

==Buy==
*Hand crafts are available at the market.
