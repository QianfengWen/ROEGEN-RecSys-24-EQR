'''Trondheim''' [http://www.trondheim.com/] is an old city in central [[Norway]]. The city is dominated by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology; its more than 25,000 students are a lot in a city with merely 184,000 inhabitants in total, and this contributes greatly to the city's economy.

==Understand==

[[Image:Trondheim.jpg|thumb|View of the Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim.]]
Trondheim is the oldest of Norway's major cities, and its old heritage can still be traced in and around the city centre. The marvellous Nidaros Cathedral, the second largest church of Northern Europe, towers over the city centre, which is roughly the area inside the meandering Nidelva.

The city boasts a rich, cultural heritage, but is still a major centre. Even if the size is modest, there's a lot going on in Trondheim. Music, arts, culture, alternative politics, nightlife, student life... all combines into making Trondheim one of the most exciting city centres of Northern Europe.

===History===
The city celebrated its 1000th anniversary in 1997 but, contrary to popular belief, Trondheim was not so much of a center for the Vikings, as it was founded at the end of the Viking Age. However, it was the religious center of northern Europe during the Middle Ages and a vital hub for North Atlantic trade, giving it plenty of characteristic mansions and harbor houses. For centuries, Trondheim was the northernmost mercantile city in Europe, giving it a special "edge-of-the-world" feeling. This also resulted in a more outgoing international culture than many other Scandinavian cities at the time. The inhabitants like to call their city the historical, religious, and technological capital of Norway.

==Get in==

===By plane===
'''Trondheim Airport Værnes''' [https://avinor.no/flyplass/trondheim/] serves international and national flights. There are plenty of flights every day to [[Oslo]], and several to places including [[Bergen]], [[Stavanger]], [[Bodø]] and [[Tromsø]], as well as the short-field airports of [[Mosjøen]], [[Sandnessjøen]], [[Brønnøysund]], [[Namsos]] and [[Rørvik]]. International destinations include [[London]] (Gatwick), [[Amsterdam]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Stockholm]], [[Alicante]] (Spain), [[Murcia]] (Spain), [[Malaga]] (Spain), [[Riga]], [[Warsaw]] and [[Prague]].

The following options are available for transfer to downtown Trondheim. Except the ATB service, all accept credit cards (minimum Visa and MasterCard).
*'''ATB''' [https://www.atb.no/en/] bus 70, 310, 330. Local public transportation service offers several buses to and from the airport. Bus 70 is the most frequent line, usually there is two buses each hour, but it is worth to check the timetables [https://www.atb.no/getfile.php/1342419-1574171249/Rutetabeller/Host19/AtB_Linje70.pdf] before departure. The final station is usually Strindheim, however some buses stops at Solsiden or Studentersamfundet. The other two lines brings to the city center, however buses only occasionally stop at the airport. Check the timetables of these lines, especially if you want to travel to the airport (310 [https://www.atb.no/getfile.php/1342675-1564657851/Rutetabeller/Host19/AtB_linje_310.pdf], 330 [https://www.atb.no/getfile.php/1342687-1563434210/Rutetabeller/Host19/AtB_linje_330.pdf]). The ticket for the buses covers zone 1 and zone 2 and the price is 76 NOK for an adult. It is possible to change ATB operated buses within 90 minutes. '''Warning''': There is no ATB vending machine at the airport, and bus drivers accepts only cash, in that case the fare is 98 NOK. In order to buy the cheaper ticket you need the ATB Mobillett application and good internet connection for the purchasing and boarding to the bus. More information about ATB Mobillett [https://www.atb.no/en/atb-mobillett/].
*'''Flybussen''' [http://flybussen.no/en/Trondheim] buses depart every 10 minutes. Fares (one-way/return) are 120/220&nbsp;NOK (student 90/150&nbsp;NOK, child up to 16 years or senior 60&nbsp;NOK (one way only)). Stops near most hotels in downtown Trondheim. Journey time is 30-60&nbsp;min depending on destination. Free Wi-Fi onboard.
*'''Værnes-Ekspressen''' [http://vaernesekspressen.no/] buses depart somewhat less frequent than Flybussen. Check the schedule before buying a return ticket. 130/220&nbsp;NOK (student&nbsp;90/150 NOK, child or senior&nbsp;60/120 NOK). Drives into the city centre like flybussen, but also goes up to Moholt Studentby (and Voll Studentby), where most international and exchange students are housed.
*'''Trains''' [http://www.nsb.no/] depart to Trondheim once per hour. One-way fares are 71&nbsp;NOK (student 53&nbsp;NOK, child or senior 36&nbsp;NOK). Buy from the ticket machine at the station to avoid the additional 40&nbsp;NOK onboard surcharge. Take left when exiting the arrivals hall and proceed around 100&nbsp;m past the airport hotel to reach the train station. Cheaper and more scenic than by bus, but far less frequent and not very practical if your destination is not close to a railway station. Journey time to Trondheim Central Station is 35-40&nbsp;min. Train may however be the best option for transfer to many other destinations such as [[Levanger]], [[Verdal]] and [[Steinkjer]]. Long distance ''Regiontog'' towards [[Fauske]] and [[Bodø]] in [[Northern Norway]] pass the airport three times daily.
*'''Taxi''' companies include (but are not limited to) Trøndertaxi, [http://www.trondertaxi.no/] Norgestaxi [http://www.norgestaxi.no/trondheim] and Stjørdal Taxi [http://www.stjordal-taxi.no/]. Many offer fixed price to Trondheim in shared or chartered taxi.

===By train===
'''NSB''' operates four daily trains between Oslo and Trondheim on the '''Dovre line''' [http://www.nsb.no/getfile.php/www.nsb.no/nsb.no/PDF/Rutetabeller/21-Oslo-Trondheim.pdf]. These are the quickest mode of ground transport between the cities.

There are no longer direct trains on the '''Røros line''' [http://www.nsb.no/getfile.php/www.nsb.no/nsb.no/PDF/Rutetabeller/25-Oslo-Hamar-R%C3%B8ros-Trondheim.pdf], but there are two daily connections to Oslo, with changes in Røros and Hamar.

Three daily trains make their way northwards on the '''Nordlandsbanen''' [http://www.nsb.no/getfile.php/www.nsb.no/nsb.no/PDF/Rutetabeller/71-Trondheim-Bod%C3%B8.pdf] towards [[Mosjøen]] and [[Mo i Rana]], with two of them continuing to [[Fauske]] and [[Bodø]]. Fauske is the main hub for buses northwards, for instance to [[Lofoten]]. Incidentally, the night service passes Hell station just before midnight...

'''Local trains''' (''Lokaltog'') [http://www.nsb.no/getfile.php/www.nsb.no/nsb.no/PDF/Rutetabeller/PDF-026-Tronderbanen-stortkort-13-12-09_12-06-10.pdf] between Trondheim and the airport, continuing to Steinkjer, depart every hour on weekdays, roughly every second hour on weekends. Trains for Oppdal and Røros depart a few times per day.

The '''Nabotåget''' [http://www.nsb.no/getfile.php/www.nsb.no/nsb.no/PDF/Rutetabeller/PDF-072%20Ostersund-Storlien%20kort.pdf] service runs twice daily to the Swedish border at [[Storlien]], continuing to the ski resort [[Åre]] and the city of [[Östersund]]. There are connections to [[Stockholm]], [[Gothenburg]] and [[Malmo]].

Train tickets may be purchased from the conductor onboard the train or from ticket vending machines at major stations. NSB imposes a 40 NOK surcharge if purchasing the ticket onboard the train which is waived if there are no ticket machines at your station of departure.

Tickets may also be booked online in advance with NSB [https://www.nsb.no/?lang=en_US]. Tickets for local trains may not be booked online, although they will still appear in the booking system with their price and schedule.  Nabotåget tickets may be booked online with either NSB or its swedish counterpart SJ [http://www.sj.se/start/startpage/index.form?l=en]. Prices and discount types differ between the two, so it might be worthwile to check both for the lowest price.

For long distance travel, restricted tickets (branded as '''Minipris''') ranging from 249 to 499 NOK are usually available if booking online at the NSB website well in advance. On long journeys such as to [[Bodø]] or [[Oslo]], this might be a fraction of the price of a full fare ticket. Minipris tickets are made available for sale with limited availability approximately 3 months prior to departure, and can be purchased no later than 1 day in advance. It is recommended to book early to get the cheapest tickets. Note that unlike full fare tickets there are no reduced fares (e.g. student fare, military discount etc.) on Minipris tickets.

===By car===

The Norwegian north-south highway E6 passes Trondheim. The coastal highway E39 has its terminus at Klett, 10 km south of Trondheim, where it joins the E6. The eastbound E14 forks off from E6 near the airport.

Parking in the city centre is easy, but expensive. Useful parking spots include the central station, the garage under the main square, the garage in Fjordgata, the Central Park garage, the garage in Sandgata (ALWAYS empty spots here).

===By bus===

From Oslo,''' Nor-way Bussekspress''' [http://www.nor-way.no] runs the '''Østerdalsekspressen''' [http://www.nor-way.no/wsp/nbe/frontend.cgi?session=qovd71uy46sem4bimy2brvojcsbpaa&func=frontend.show&func_id=135&template=vis_rutetider&tr=t] via Elverum and Tynset. No prebooking needed. This bus is painfully much more slow than the train, but convenient if you are going to/from some of the destinations the train don't serve.

Also from Oslo, the '''Lavprisekspressen''' [https://lavprisekspressen.no/index.php] budget bus line runs along the E6 all the way. Tickets must be booked and prepaid on the internet site. They are infinitely cheaper than Nor-Way, and are the cheapest alternative if you get discount tickets. However, the train is more comfy and quicker, even if the buses are okay.

The '''Mørelinjen''' [http://www.nor-way.no/wsp/nbe/frontend.cgi?session=qovd71uy46sem4bimy2brvojcsbpaa&func=frontend.show&func_id=630&template=vis_rutetider&tr=t] express, operated by Nor-Way, runs down the coast towards [[Kristiansund]], [[Molde]] and [[Ålesund]].

Other Nor-Way lines from Trondheim include the '''Namsos''' line[http://www.nor-way.no/wsp/nbe/frontend.cgi?session=qovd71uy46sem4bimy2brvojcsbpaa&func=frontend.show&func_id=670&template=vis_rutetider&tr=t] the '''Røros''' line [http://www.nor-way.no/wsp/nbe/frontend.cgi?session=qovd71uy46sem4bimy2brvojcsbpaa&func=frontend.show&func_id=611&template=vis_rutetider&tr=t]  and the useful '''Bergen''' line [http://www.nor-way.no/wsp/nbe/frontend.cgi?session=qovd71uy46sem4bimy2brvojcsbpaa&func=frontend.show&func_id=440&template=vis_rutetider&tr=t], passing the fjord areas of western Norway on the way and connecting these with Trondheim. All the way to Bergen, it takes a whopping 14 hrs.

===By boat===
If you have the time and money, you should definitely take the Coastal Steamer [[Hurtigruten]] [http://www.hurtigruten.no/]. It runs from [[Bergen]] to Trondheim, and on to [[Bodø]], [[Tromsø]], [[Hammerfest]] and finally [[Kirkenes]], just on the Russian border. The trip from Bergen takes 36 hours and costs about 750 NOK if you are a student (be sure to check for updated prices on their home page). This trip takes you through one of the most magnificent parts of coastal Norway, even popping by the famous Geiranger fjord during summer. Travelling north, Bodø is reached in 24 hrs, while Tromsø takes 50 hrs. All the way to Kirkenes takes another two days from Tromsø...

There is also a twice a day catamaran passenger boat-service to Trondheim from Kristiansund.

==Get around==

Trondheim has a well developed '''bus''' [http://www.atb.no] network, covering nearly all of the city. There are frequent departures during the day, less frequent during evenings. On weekend nights, a comprehensive night bus system runs from the terminus in Olav Tryggvasons gate, close to the action.

'''Here''' [http://www.atb.no/getfile.php/Filer/Rutetabeller/AtB_rutekart_A4%2BA3_s.pdf] is a '''map''' of the system.
'''Here''' [https://www.atb.no/getfile.php/132323-1531398433/Rutekart/AtB_Trondheim.pdf] you can find links to the time schedules (in PDF).

'''Here''' [https://www.nsb.no/en/] is a useful travel planner for local and regional trains in English from NSB site. Useful to find routes and stations as seems hard to find a local train schematic.

''' Travel planner for busses here - also in English.  ''' [https://www.atb.no/?lang=en_GB] 

A  '''Night service map''' [http://www.team-trafikk.no/pdf/Kart_nattbuss_210806_A4L.jpg] is here (in PDF). Remember, these only run nights after Friday and Saturday.

'''Tickets''' Can be bought from the driver (the most expensive option), and are NOK 60 for single tickets (NOK 25 for 4 to 16 year old and over 67, under 4 travel for free). while the night bus costs NOK 90 (day pass not valid). You can buy prepaid tickets at some convenience stores (Narvesen, 7/Eleven and Deli de Luca) selected parking meters and dedicated ticket meters at the largest bus stops in the city center. These tickets are cheaper than buying with cash from the driver. It is also relatively easy to download and set up the '''AtB-app''' [https://www.atb.no/en/atb-mobillett/], which is the cheapest option. 

One '''tram''' [http://www.graakallbanen.no/] line operates from St. Olavs gate near the centre to Lian, up in the Bymarka forests. It operates on the same fare schedule, so day passes are valid. The tram is the nothernmost tram service in the world.

The resort island of  '''Munkholmen''' [http://www.munkholmen.no/foto.htm], ideal for swimming, sunbathing or a peek at the old monastery, can be reached by boat from Ravnkloa every hour in summer. Make sure you don't miss the last boat home in the evening! A two way ticket costs NOK 70 for adults, NOK 40 for children and NOK 40 for strollers. Cash only.

'''Local trains''' [http://www.nsb.no/getfile.php/www.nsb.no/nsb.no/PDF/Rutetabeller/PDF-026-Tronderbanen-stortkort-13-12-09_12-06-10.pdf] can also be used within the city boundaries (between stations Rotvoll and Lerkendal/Heimdal). Sadly, these are no longer part of the common public transport fare system, so day passes are not valid. Buy single tickets from the station clerks or the conductor on the train.

If you want to find anywhere in Trondheim, try the '''Yellow Pages website''' [http://www.gulesider.no]. The maps have more detail than a certain popular map website, and are very useful if you've heard the name of a place, but don't know where it is.

==See==
An overview of museums can be found on [http://www.trondheim.com/museums].
Some museums only open in summer. 
* Stay close to the '''Nidelva''' if you want to see the real pearl of the city. The sunsets can be magnificent, especially in summer, and the city is so far north that the first hints of arctic blue sky is seen. Summer days seem to last forever, although for a real midnight sun, you have to travel further north. The river is nicely experienced in the park '''Marinen''' just behind the Cathedral.
* '''Nidarosdomen''' [http://www.nidarosdomen.no/en-GB/ ] is the biggest church of Northern Europe and the only major gothic cathedral in Norway, and the pride of the city. Towering over the city centre at its southern edge, the majestic cathedral is '''the''' defining feature of Trondheim. Nidarosdomen is also Norway's national cathedral. It was erected over what was believed to be St.Olav's grave and it became a major pilgrimage site in Northern Europe. Next door is the '''Archbishop's Palace''', which was partly burnt down in the 80's, and has been heavily restored. It houses an archeological museum, which includes an excavated Mint workshop for the minting of coins.
* '''Wooden mansions''' in and around the city centre. '''Stiftsgaarden''', the King's local residence, is the biggest together with the Singsaker summer hotel, but the small, wooden houses in parts of the city like  '''Bakklandet''' [http://www.bakklandet.com/], '''Hospitalsløkkan''' '''Ila''' and '''Ilsvikøra''' are even more picturesque.
* The ancient fortress island '''Munkholmen''', accessible by boat. 
* Wooden '''harbour buildings''' along Kjøpmannsgata, Fjordgata and Sandgata. The best view is from the Old Town Bridge [http://www.vad1.com/photo/stock/n12-29.html] across Nidelva river, leading from close to the Cathedral to Bakklandet.
* The world's first bike lift '''Trampe''' at Bakklandet, just across the bridge. (Sadly this is removed, but a new version of the lift is on it's way)
* '''TV-tower''' with a rotating top '''restaurant''' (bus 20,60 to Tyholttårnet/Otto Nielsens veg)
* '''Museum of Musical instruments''' [http://www.ringve.com/] at Ringve (bus 3,4 to Ringve museum). Also has the botanical gardens of Trondheim.
* The small community of squatters in the area of '''Reina''' (dubbed by themselves '''Svartla'mon''' [http://www.svartlamon.org/ ]), now an ecological experiment-part of the city. A different neighbourhood to walk around in, with very few shops, cafes and lots of graffiti. 
* '''DORA 1''' , the German submarine base for the 13th flotilla  during the German occupation of Norway 1940 - 1945. Today the bunker is housing many archives, among them the city archives, university and state archives.
* '''Trøndelag folkemuseum''' [http://www.sverresborg.no/] at '''Sverresborg''', with lots of old houses depicting lifestyle in old days. In a very beautiful park area overlooking the city, and truly worth a visit! Activities for children on Sundays. Eat at the nice inhouse-cafe, or at the next-door "Tavern" dating from the 18th century. (Bus 8 to Trøndelag Folkemuseum)

It holds a collection of weapons and uniforms dating back from the middle ages to modern day, and a permanent exhibition about the German occupation of Norway.</see>

==Do==
* Every year in the end of July and the beginning of August, you can visit the '''St. Olav Festival''' [http://www.olavsfestdagene.no/]. The festival is a celebration of Olav Haraldsson, who attempted to christianise Norway. The festivals programme consists of both religious contributions, like masses for pilgrimages in the Nidaros cathedral and cultural festivities like concerts, Middle-Age-plays, lectures, exhibitions and many other activities.
* Have a '''swim''' in the modern Pirbadet [http://www.pirbadet.no/] swimming pool, a magnificent water palace just by the sea, but definitely warmer! (Bus 46 or 52 to Pirterminalen, end station)
*  2 hour tour down the river with a kayak from Trondheimkajakk [http://www.trondheimkajakk.no/] and discover spectacular views of Trondheim hidden from the usual hiker.  
* Have a even cooler '''swim''' in the sjøbadet, a tiny little, but very cosy beach that consists of not much more than a wooden diving tower. It gains its uniqueness through its location, right to the left behind the central trainstation, in the area of harbor and industries. Don't worry, it's the cleanest water in the world! 
* Watch '''Rosenborg BK''' [https://www.rbk.no/english], the dominant team in Norwegian football, at the Lerkendal Stadion. The Norwegian season runs from March to November and Rosenborg are almost always involved in European football competitions in the midweek from July to November.
* If the weather is nice and the fjord is warm, the best swimming spots are found east of the city. The '''Lade''' area contains a footpath along the fjord, which passes many of the best swimming spots. (Bus 3 to Strandveikaia, then walk along the industrially-looking road to the left... and you'll find beauty soon!) Also, the '''Rotvoll/Ranheim'''-area further out is brilliant for sunbathing and swimming. (Bus 6 to Rotvoll or longer, or local train to Rotvoll station)
* Check out Trondheim's bustling '''nightlife'''. During term time, the students make the nightlife rocking all week, and skyrocketing in weekends. Check the "Drink" section for more.
* Have a walk in the '''Kristiansten Fortress'''-areakristiansen Fortress, overlooking the city. (If you can't be bothered with the hills, get bus 63 to Ankersgata, or rent a bike and use the bike lift!)
* Take the local train to '''Hell Station''' and get a photo of yourself.  If you can't be bothered going there, you can still buy a one-way ticket to Hell from Central Station... for that special someone.
* Go '''skiing at Vassfjellet''' [http://www.vassfjellet.com/] just outside Trondheim, in the season there's a bus service from Munkegata, and a Ski Shop [http://www.vassfjellet.no/] with ski and snowboard rental service.
* Cross-country skiing is popular november-april with hundreds of km tracks in Bymarka and Estenstadmarka.  You can rent skis at [http://www.skiklubben.no/index.php/Vinter/Skiutleie/Skiutleie.html Skistua] in Bymarka, bus 10.

==Learn==
The Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU [http://www.ntnu.no/]) in Trondheim represents academic eminence in technology and the natural sciences as well as in other academic disciplines ranging from the social sciences, the arts, medicine, architecture to fine arts. Cross-disciplinary cooperation results in innovative breakthroughs and creative solutions with far-reaching social and economic impact.

==Work==
If you're looking for work check out the website of the governmental agency NAV [http://www.nav.no]. Tech industry boom; Yahoo's arrived & there's other start-ups. If you are truly impressive in this field they'll pay for your move and process your work visa. But you have to excell in your field; if there's a Norwegian that can do your job, they'll get it not you.

=== Shopping Streets ===
* '''Nordre gate'''. The central shopping street in Trondheim, with international stores as well as local shops. Clothes, food, jewellery, watches, electronics, and much more can be found in this pedestrian-only street.

* '''Thomas Angells Gate'''. Crossing Nordre gate at approximately half-way, this is a slightly smaller street with record shops and different other stores.

* '''Fjordgata'''. Following the canal at the north of the city centre you have this lenghty street filled mainly with speciality stores as well as a decent selection of restaurants.

=== Malls ===

* '''Trondheim Torg''', Kongens g 11. Smack in the middle of the city, this mall should be able to suit most of your needs. This mall especially has many diners/cafés. In 2005 it was extended with about 20 new stores and cafés. No frill, nothing fancy, just a centrally located shopping mall with good prices.

* '''Mercur Shopping Center''', Kongens gate 8. Also very central, this is a smaller and slightly less crowded shopping centre than Torg; a good alternative.

* '''Byhaven''', Olav Tryggvasons g 28. Slightly posh shopping mall with a slight majority of expensive stores. Granted, there were many more posh stores when it opened some years ago now, but the posh enviroment seems to remain.

* '''Solsiden''', Beddingen 10, Nedre Elvehavn. Solsiden translates directly to "The Sunny Side". It was realized and hurrily transformed from an abandoned ship-building site into the hippest shopping mall Trondheim has to offer. Very stylish and well thought out in beautiful surroundings flanked by penthouse apartments as far as you can see. It has a long stretch of restaurants/bars located by the old area where ships were launched back in the good ol' days. Perhaps the most enjoyable of the malls in Trondheim(?). Walk across the pedestrian bridge from close to the train station, or get any eastbound bus from the centre.

* '''City Syd''', Østre Rosten 28 -30, 7075 Tiller. The largest shopping mall in central Norway, with 38000 square metres of shops, restaurants and whatever else you can think of. Slightly off the beaten tourist track but it can be reached by bus/taxi.  The buses 46 and 47 connects City Syd with downtown and has frequent departures, the ride is about 15 minutes. In addition there are 2 other shopping malls in close proximity (200 and 300 meters) to City Syd (easily spotted from the City Syd parking Lots), "StorM Sentret" and the larger "TillerTorget".

* '''City Lade''', Haakon VIIs gate 9. A new-ish, large mall at Lade, some 3kms from the centre. Bus 4 takes you there.

Trondheim has food spots to suit every taste, though remember that food prices are very high.

===Budget===

(The other meny has HIGH prices). It is every Sunday and Monday from 11AM to 11PM. All other days it is from 11AM to 6PM. Tap water is for free, other beverages. There are also other EGON outlets around town, the most central being in Søndre gate, Prisens gate and at the Solsiden mall.</eat>

===Mid-range===

* '''Credo Bar''', Credoveita just behind Byhaven shopping centre. This is one of the best restaurants in Trondheim, with prices to match. Nice, then, that they have a bar on the 1st floor serving the daily special (choice between fish and meat) for NOK 150(January 2011). It's ALWAYS delicious. 3-course dinner for NOK 275. Enter through the "hidden" door to the left of the restaurant, and walk up the stairs. This bar turns into a rocking place at night.

* '''Bakklandet Skydsstation''', Øvre Bakklandet. The place to find old Norwegian standards, such as kjøttkaker (meat cakes) and ''baccalao'' (dried, salted cod in a tomato sauce), in what must be the city's most charming and least right-angled house.

* '''Cafe Ni Muser''', Prinsens gate. Nice, artsy café with good food and a big outdoor section. A bit too close to the traffic-ridden Prinsens gate, however.

* '''Kaktus''', Nedre Bakklandet 6. Located in a small, but wonderful Trondheim street serving a nice range of very tasty food. Includes some mexican and plenty of steaks. 

* '''Frati/ØX''', KONGENS GATE 20. Italian restaurant with a bar that brews its own ale in the cellar

===Splurge===

* '''Emilies''', Erling Skakkes gate close to the Theatre. A homely gourmet restaurant with a slant towards French cuisine, Emilies is one of the top offerings in town.

* '''Credo''', Credoveita behind Byhaven shopping centre. A top offering with a stellar wine list, this restaurant manages to be both informal, creative and top-end. Expensive, but a memory for life.

* '''Speilsalen''', Inside Britannia Hotel. A MICHELIN star, elegant restaurant featuring a prix-fixe menu and extensive wine menu. Dating back to 1877, the iconic dining room has been beautifully restored.

==Drink==

Trondheim has a rocking nightlife. However, everything closes fairly early, meaning that there's a well developed culture for after-parties in homes. To find one, the area just outside Downtown and Harvey's in Nordre is the best bet, or befriend someone working at the Studentersamfundet, that can take you into the private quarters of the house. They are only allowed one guest each...  

Learn the customs if you want a good time... essential words are "Vorspiel", referring to the pre-parties people have before they go out, and "Nachspiel", the after-parties.  Vorspiels are necessitated by the very high prices in bars and clubs... the idea is generally to drink as much as you can before going out, spend as little as possible while in the venue, and drink more afterwards.

Also, beware of the stringent regulations governing the sale of alcohol!  You can only get drinks of strength 4,7% or less from regular shops.  So, only beer.  Also, they stop selling beer at 8PM sharp on weekdays, 6PM sharp on Saturdays and they don't sell it at all on Sundays... a legacy from Christian Democracy.  Beware of the alcohol-free beer too, there's lots of it, and many people drink it if they are driving... if you see beer that seems cheap(er) than the rest, check the strength!!

If you want wine or spirits, you'll need to find a Vinmonopolet, the state-run liquor stores.  There are only a few in Trondheim, and they close early, 5 or 6PM during the week and 3PM on Saturdays.  Sunday?  Forget it.  The most central one can be found in "Søndre gate", as well as in Byhaven mall, Solsiden mall, Valentinlyst mall, City Lade mall and CitySyd mall.

The cafe scene in Trondheim is the best developed in Norway, with tons of fine coffee-and-cake spots around. Most double as pubs during the night.

===Mainly alcohol===


* '''Studentersamfundet''', Elgeseter gate 1. A big, red, round temple to partying. Major concerts coincide with political meetings, discussions, wine tasting, disco, football matches and... you name it. You are certain to get lost in the mazes of this wonderful house. Fairly empty in summer and on weekdays, but on term time weekends it's good. Expect to pay around NOK 30- 60 in the door on weekends, more if there's a major concert going on. The place is run by approx 1300 student volunteers who do everything from serving drings, rigging concerts, sing in Samfundets choir, play in Samfundets symphony orchestra and hold political debates. Befriend anyone who works there, and try to gain access to their private quarters. Most volunteers are enthusiastic people that often are easy to befriend if you e.g. is a foreigner showing interest. The private quarters are secluded areas where the volunteers hang out after "work", and is an even more elaborate maze with some 20 pubs that stays open all night (and day... and night again...). Closed during summer (May-Aug).

* '''Bar Circus''', Olav Tryggvasons gate 27. Small, quite popular pub/venue and almost always very full - but that's not just because of the music or location, but because of the beer price which is cheap in norwegian terms (43,- for 0,4l.) 

* '''Kieglekroa Pub''', Kongens gate 30. Pretty nice place to start your evening. Half-welcoming prices and good music. Try the "kjeglespill" in the basement - amusing, addictive and its for free!

* '''Den Gode Nabo''', Bakklandet. Just across the Old Town bridge and down a scary-looking staircase, this is a brown fisherman's pub in an old warehouse. As atmospheric as it gets, they have Trondheim's most lovely outdoor seating in summer. The place is divided between the "grown ups section" by the entrance, and the "student section" further in. Popular amongst students and all others and not too expensive if you prefer the regular brands.  Furthermore,  they have an exceptional range of beer and a friendly and knowledgeable staff who are always happy to suggest new things to try.

* '''DownTown''', Near the crossing of Nordre gate and Fjordgata, it is widely known among students due to its pianobar. Cheap beer during the week (19 NOK for 33cl) and a lot of international students, especially on thursday.

* '''Crash''', Just besides DownTown in Nordre gate, being one of the nightclubs in the sweetspot of Trondheim's nightlife it is often crowded in the weekends. Popular club for young people and students.

* '''Gossip''', Nordre gate, across the street of DownTown and Crash. This is an another nightclub which together with DownTown and Crash is the main nightclub visited by students and young people (early twenties). On special occations, halloween for instance, Gossip will be the club most likely to host theme parties. 

* '''Cafe 3b''', Brattørgata. 3b is an institution in Trondheim. Leading on in the "big beer war" of the -90's, it was dirt cheap for years. Now it's more expensive, but it's still an enjoyable, black hole catering for rock and indie kids of every denomination imaginable. Hiphop kids have their own private dungeon down the corridor behind the bar in the basement.

* '''Credo''', Credoveita behind Byhaven shopping centre. Above the Credo restaurant is the 3b for grown ups. Rock and indie for people who know their musical history, and the occasional live gig of guaranteed quality music. Entrance in the dark alley around the corner from the restaurant. Hard to spot unless the smokers are taking fresh air. 

* '''Fru Lundgreens''', Olavskvartalet. In the basement of the concert hall, Fru Lundgreens looks like the inside of a lung but has good, cheap beer and a brilliant jukebox. Crowd is rock. Pooltable in the back. Prices vary on time, but always good value. The food of the day is good if you need something with your beer.

* '''Carl Johan''', Nordre gate. The northernmost end of Nordre gate is the hub of Trondheims nightlife, with mainstream discos, sausage kiosks and lots of drunk, well-dressed people. Carl Johan is a straightforward pub with more relaxed ambience than most offerings in the area.

* '''Kjemikjellern''', (Often pronounced Sjemisjeller'n by drunk students visiting from southeastern Norway), A great place for getting drunk in the weekends, very cheap beer and booze. Try befriending some local students and you might get to taste some lovely karsk.

* '''Kvilhaugen gård''', Tyholt (bus 60 to Kvilhaugen). If you venture out of the centre to get your beer, make it here. Wonderful outdoor seating with views of most of Trondheim. Inside, it's an old farmhouse with plenty of atmosphere.
 

* '''Bakklandet Skydsstation''', Øvre Bakklandet. Doubles as a cosy cafe-cum-pub at night.

* '''Cafe Ni Muser''', Prinsens gate. Their outdoor section is packed with artsy types in summer. A lovely spot to get imbibed, just by the Cathedral.

* '''Mormors Stue''', Although being a café, it's most known as becoming the cheapest place to buy beer, which at the same time provides a nostalgic atmosphere. The down side is that you have to come early to be sure to get a seat, and that it closes early.

* '''Familien''', Dronningens gate 11. Plays all kinds of music and caters to all kinds of people. A nice place if you want to dance, discuss or just drink with the other people. Cheap beer before 11PM. 

* '''Trondhjem Mikrobryggeriet''', Prinsensgt. 39. A brewery pub offering a range of beer brewed in-house (about six kinds plus a seasonal special). Prices for a 0.5L about 50% higher than elsewhere, but the only place in town to offer an IPA ''and'' a bitter from tap - along with the other four. Substantial food is served, too.

===Mainly coffee===

* '''Mormors Stue'''. In the centre of town, this cafe has a cake-buffet on Sundays, 69nok for as much cake and tea/coffee as you can eat and drink.  Carrot cake, cheesecake, apple cake, chocolate cake... all are totally edible.  The free coffee's not up to Dromedar standards by far, but do go in a group and hang out for an hour or two. It's a good way to spend a hung over Sunday afternoon. Opens at 1PM on Sundays, be sure to arrive on time to ensure you have place to sit.

* '''Choco Boco''', Solsiden. A good coffee-bar with Italian-style coffee and exotic specials like Snickers coffee. Lovely cakes as well. Decent, free wifi access.

* '''Dromedar Kaffebar''', Nedre Bakklandet and Nordre gate. The best coffee in Norway (save Tim Wendelboes in Oslo), ultra-top-quality coffee comes with the typical laid-back Trondheim atmosphere thrown in for free, especially at their Bakklandet outlet. Plain awesome.  Has wifi access.

* '''UFFA''', Innherredsveien 69c. The UFFA-Hus (Ungdom for fri aktivitet) is a autonomous youth-center in Trondheim with a lively history of 25 years. You'll find concerts of regional, norwegian and international Punk, Hardcore and Metal-bands for decent prices. During the week they serve cheep vegetarian food.

===Budget===

* '''Camping''' There are several managed camp sites, some with huts. If you want to go free-camping, get the tram to the terminus at Lian and walk into the forest from there. Some people camp rough in the area around the fortifications of Kristiansten festning: Do this at your own risk. (This is technically a park.) There is an unofficial law in Norway stating that nature is for everyone, you may camp out anywhere if you keep a distance of 300 meters from homes/structures. It underscores Norwegians deep love of the outdoors & their trust in people using but not abusing this precious resource. If you want to camp close to the city, it is allowed to camp behind the Studentersamfundet, under the administration of Trondheim InterRail Center, during the summer months against a low fee.

Campsites include:
* '''Flakk''' [http://www.flakk-camping.no/Welcome.html], close to the ferry terminal for the car ferry to Fosen. (Bus 75 to Flakkråa, infrequent)
* '''Sandmoen''' [http://www.sandmoen.no/], south of the city and frequently served by slo-o-ow bus. Shop, huts and all amenities. (Bus 19 or 47 to Sandmoen)
* '''Vikhammer''' [http://www.vikhammer.no/], east of the centre near the fjord. (Local bus towards Stjørdal or local train to Vikhammer station, day pass not valid)
* '''Storsand''' [http://www.storsandcamping.no/], east of the centre and maybe the most picturesqure of the lot. (Local bus towards Stjørdal, fairly frequent, day pass not valid)
* '''Øysand''' [http://www.oysandcamping.no/], south of the city near the Øysand beach. (Local buses towards Orkanger, frequent, day pass not valid).

Hostels include:

* '''Trondheim Hostel''' [http://www.trondheimvandrerhjem.no/] is located on top of a hill, fairly close to the centre, Lademoen and the fortress. Clean, efficient and nice. (Bus 63 to Sigurd Bergs allé)

* '''Pensjonat Jarlen''' [http://www.jarlen.no/en/] is the most central offering, in Kongens gate near the main square. Slightly more expensive, but still good for Trondheim.

Hotels include:

* '''Singsaker Sommerhotell''' [http://sommerhotell.singsaker.no/] is a lovely studenthome converted into a summer hotel while the students are home during the summer. It's located near to city center and the University. The standard is simple, but upgraded this year (summer 2008). The breakfast buffet is included. The hotel opens in the beginning of June and closes in the middle of August (this may vary). Be early to book if you want a room with bathroom, although the common bathrooms are really nice too.

==Stay safe==
Generally considered to be the sort of city where little old ladies can walk safely in dark alleys.
It is also not terribly uncommon that regular people will go to great strides to give you back your wallet if you drop it, with cash and credit cards intact.

The only "danger" you might encounter are the occasional youths stumbling around in large groups on Friday/Saturdays. The same goes for Trondheim as anywhere else; leave drunk people alone and it's a good chance they'll leave you alone as well.

There are some beggars and rough people. Norway has an extensive social wellfare system, and everyone is guaranteed a place to live and a minimum hand out from the government (for single person aprox 5000 NOK a month). Beggars are therefore usually people whose economical difficulties are related to excessive use of drugs or alcohol. In the summer, you might also encounter foreigners who have travelled to Norway on the purpose of begging for money. Begging is not illegal in Norway.

==Contact==
Internet cafes are scarce as most people are connected at home. You will however find a few PCs at some museums and public buildings, reserved for visitors, and more at the public library (may be waiting time).

* '''Wireless Trondheim''' [http://tradlosetrondheim.no/index.php?lang=en] is a wireless network covering most of the city centre. 3h=NOK 10, 24h=NOK 29.
* '''Trondheim Public Library''' Peter Egges plass 1. Mon - Thu 9:00AM - 7:00PM, Fri 9:00AM - 4:00PM, Sat 9:00AM - 3:00PM
* '''Main Post Office''', Dronningens gt. 10.
* The '''Railway Station''' has an electronic information kiosk about the city. It has a keyboard but the web browser has no address bar, so you can only click on links to other sites. But find your way to Google (it's possible, be creative), and you can type in the address of the website you want to visit into Google Search.
* '''NTNU University Library''' [http://www.ntnu.edu/ub] is several libraries around on different NTNU compounds with some of them having PCs reserved for visitors, even though this is mainly for visitors of the university.

==Get out==

The two main areas for those who are fond of hiking are Estenstadmarka and Bymarka. To get to ''Estenstadmarka'', take for example bus #5 to Dragvoll. ''Bymarka'' you can reach by the Trondheim's only tram line — Gråkallbanen. Be sure to put on a pair of good boots: the terrains of Trøndelag tend to be very wet.

===Day trips===

''Øysand'' is one of the best beaches close to Trondheim. Get the Orkanger-bound buses. You may also rent a car.

===Hitch-hiking===

Hitching a ride out of Trondheim can be difficult. The best spots require a bus-ride at the start. 

For south/south-westbound travel, the bus stop close to the Shell station at E6, just across the street from City Syd shopping mall, may be the best choice within city limits. Get bus 46 to City Syd and walk, or get the Orkanger-bound bus that stops right there.
If you want to make it clear whether you are going the E6 (towards [[Oslo]]) or the E39 (towards [[Molde]]/[[Ålesund]]), you need to get the Orkanger-bound bus to Øysand (for E39) or the Støren-bound bus to Kvål (for E6). This may be sensible, as the traffic splits roughly in half at Klett, where the two main roads meet. If you are lucky, a bus driver would drive you to the best available hiking spot free of charge (especially if you are from abroad).

For north/eastbound travel, get bus 7 or 36 to Travbanen stop. Sadly, there are no good hitching spots beyond the start of the highway. To avoid short runs, it may be wise to get a bus or train to [[Stjørdal]] (close to the airport), then hitch on the E6 or E14 depending on where you want to go. In Stjørdal, there are good spots at both roads close to the station.
