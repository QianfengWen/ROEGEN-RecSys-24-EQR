'''Jaipur''' (also known as the Pink City), is the capital of  [[Rajasthan]] in [[India]]. 

==Understand==
[[Image:VidhanSabha.jpg |thumb|Rajasthan's Legislative Assembly situated at Jaipur during festival season]]
Jaipur is the largest city in [[Rajasthan]] and was built in the eighteenth century by Sawai Jai Singh as ''India's first planned city''. Jaipur is a major tourist attraction amongst Indian as well as international travellers. It belongs to the tourist ''Golden Triangle'' of Delhi, Jaipur and Agra. It hosts several attractions like the City Palace, Govind Dev ji Temple, Vidhan Sabha, Birla Temple, several massive Rajput forts and so on. It also serves as a stepping stone for travelers heading to the desert cities of [[Jodhpur]] and [[Jaisalmer]]. 

Now Jaipur is growing fast and various development projects are being undertaken by the government and private enterprises. The town planning and infrastructure development in Jaipur is quite above the mark relative to many other Indian cities.

Jaipur is often called the Pink City in reference to its distinctly coloured buildings, which were originally painted this color to imitate the red sandstone architecture of Mughal cities. The present  earthy red color originates from repainting of the buildings undertaken for a visit by the Prince of Wales in 1876.

Jaipur gets its name from its founder Maharaja JaiSingh II (1693-1744) the great warrior and astronomer. He came to power at the age of 11 on the death of his father Maharaja Bishan Singh. Jai Singh’s lineage can be traced back to the Kucchwaha Rajput, clan who came to power in the 12th century. They were long-term rivals to the Sisodia Rajputs who ruled from [[Mewar]]. This rivalry led them to ally with the Mughals, and this alliance resulted in them eventually gaining a pre-eminent position in Rajasthan.   

Ruling from the magnificent Amber Fort which they built, the might of the Kucchwahas encompassed the kingdoms of Mewar (Udaipur) and Marwar (Jodhpur). After Jai Singh came to power, there was moment of disquiet when he supported Aurangzeb’s son Azam Shah’s bid to the throne. Azam Shah lost the battle of succession to his brother Bahadur Shah, who demanded Jai Singh’s removal and the installation of Vijay Singh to the throne of Jaipur. Jai Singh, not one to take setbacks lying down, formed a formidable front against the Mughals by aligning himself with other Rajput states and reinstated himself.

After the dust had settled, peace reigned and the kingdom prospered and its borders expanded. Jai Singh built the city around the Amber fort to serve as his capital, and the city was named Jaipur, after himself. Much of the credit for Jaipur goes to Vidhyadhar Bhattacharya, the chief architect from Bengal who, with Jai Singh’s approval, founded the city on strong scientific principles, laid out according to the Shilpa Shastra, the ancient architectural manual. It remains one of India’s best planned cities.However, expansion meant that the limited sources of water proved inadequate for the city. 

After Jai Singh’s death in 1744, his sons squabbled for power and without a monarch, the kingdom became open to invasion and neighboring Rajput states and the Marathas usurped large areas of kingdom. The core, however, remained part of the kingdom, which lasted during British times.  As with the Mughals, Jaipur maintained good relations with the British and during the war of independence in 1857 remained loyal to the Raj. Yet, the British gradually began to undermine the independence of the state and exercised greater control over the administration. 

In 1876, Maharaja Ram Singh  painted the entire city pink, traditionally a colour associated with hospitality, to welcome the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) to the city. The tradition has been maintained and today all residents in the old city are compelled by law to preserve the pink colour. Jaipur got the sobriquet of '''pink city'''. 

Maharaja Ram Singh also built the Ramgarh Lake to supply water to the burgeoning city. During the 19th and 20th centuries, the city’s population spread beyond its walls. In 1922, Man Singh II ascended to the throne and it was during his reign that civic buildings like the secretariat, schools, hospitals and other public buildings were built. After independence, Jaipur merged with the states of Jodhpur, Jaisalmer and Bikaner to form the state of Rajasthan. In 1956, Jaipur became the capital of the state of Rajasthan.

===By plane===

Jaipur Airport ({{IATA|JAI}}, {{ICAO|VIJP}}) is situated in the satellite town of Sanganer and offers sporadic (chartered) service to [[London]] and [[Dublin]]. Flights to [[Singapore]] and Bangkok are available via Delhi. Direct flights to Sharjah, Muscat and [[Dubai]] are also available.  

Jaipur also has daily domestic air links with many Indian cities such as [[Jodhpur]], [[Udaipur]], [[Aurangabad]], [[Delhi]], [[Hyderabad]], [[Kolkata]], [[Goa]], [[Chennai]], [[Ahmedabad]], [[Bangalore]], [[Mumbai]], [[Pune]],Hyderabad and Indore.

One plus point for those flying out of Delhi is that the Delhi airport is close to the highway, so you could reach the airport without entering the city.

===By train===

Indian Railways[http://www.indianrail.gov.in/inet_srcdest_names.html] connects Jaipur from all over the country and is one of the cheapest options. A number of daily trains connect Jaipur to [[Delhi]], Ahmedabad, [[Agra]], [[Mumbai]], Jodhpur, Kota, Alwar and Ajmer. Daily connections are also available for Udaipur, Chittaurgarh, Bikaner, Jaisalmer, Barmer, Kolkata, Jammu, Pathankot, Ludhiana, Kanpur, Roorkee, Haridwar, Gwalior, Indore, Jabalpur and Bhopal.

Long-distance trains arrive from many other major cities including Lucknow, Allahabad, Benaras, Vadodara, Surat, Nagpur, Bilaspur, Raipur, Patna, Ranchi, Bhubaneswar, Puri,  [[Chennai]], Bangalore, Mysore, Hyderabad, Goa, Mangalore, Kozhikode and Kochi.

The most popular option from Delhi is the Shatabdi express which departs New Delhi station at 6:05AM and reaches Jaipur at 10:30AM. 

There are three major railway stations Jaipur Junction (main station),Durgapura and Gandhinagar (Jaipur), which is not to be confused with Gandhinagar in Gujarat state. All trains stop at Jaipur Junction  and a few trains stop at Durgapura and Gandhinagar stations also.  There is a prepaid taxi stand at Jaipur Junction.

===By bus===

There is an excellent bus service between Jaipur to Delhi by Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation (RSRTC) with buses approximately every half an hour both sides. non-A/C and AC Volvo bus services are offered. A/C Volvo costs about Rs 600 per seat and the bus is taken through well maintained highway and has good shock absorbers. From Delhi you can board the bus from Bikaner House on Pandara Road next to India Gate. From Jaipur you can board the bus from Narayan Singh Circle or the main Sindhi Camp bus stand. You can also book  tickets up to 6 days in advance from both these places. These buses typically take 6 hours (by Volvo) or 6-7 hr by other buses.
You can also book your bus (govt.) tickets online at [www.rsrtc.rajasthan.gov.in].
There are also some private bus operators from Dhaula Kuan in Delhi and outside of Sindhi camp in Jaipur. No need to make advance reservations and cost is Rs 150 for a seat and Rs 250 for sleeper on an A/C bus but these buses are taken through bumpy backroads to avoid toll roads and their shock absorbers are not good. 

Also note that if you plan to leave from Delhi airport, you can get off the bus at Dhaula Kuan and get an autorickshaw (to the bus stand) or perhaps a taxi from there. You do not need to enter congested Delhi.

Express buses to several cities and towns within Rajasthan (such as Kota and Bundi) are also available.

==Get around== 

===By RTDC bus===

It is the best and cheaper way to visit the Jaipur Local Sights by RTDC (Rajasthan Tourism Dept. Corp.) There are three type of tours: 1) full day tour (Jun-2012 price: 300 Rs), 2) half day tour (Jun-2012 price: 250 Rs) and 3) Pink city by night tour (Jun-2012 price: 375 Rs). For details see the website [http://www.rtdc.in/ctt.htm]. There will be one guide with each bus to give you brief info about all sights.  Reports indicate that many times the buses are late, and the miss lots of the destinations on the list.  Also, the buses will often stop at overpriced markets and shops.

===By local bus===

City bus #5 connects directly Amber Fort, Hawa Mahal, New Gate and the intersection of MI Road and Railway Rd every 10 minutes until 9 PM. Cost is Rs 10 - 12 depending on distance. 

City bus #2 runs from the train station up station rd to the city palace, minar, observatory etc. The bus driver will try and charge you more. It's 6 rupees as of mid 2012. They also sometimes ask you if you need change, or say they don't have change, despite it being obvious they do.
http://www.jaipurbus.com/route_map.html# you can view this link to know about the bus routes in jaipur.

===By autorickshaw===

By and large, '''autorickshaw''' is the best way around the city. Hiring an autorickshaw for a whole day with a trip to Amber Fort should cost around Rs 350.  

Prepaid autos are available at the Jaipur railway station and the Sindhi Camp bus stand, although prices are a little inflated and often the same as you get with minimal bargaining.

The rates have been revised to around Rs 350-400, and the autorikshaw walas will tell you to take the Slip from the Police booths, but you can also go directly without the Slip but don't forget to Bargain over the price in that case, it could be much cheaper. It'll be best if you start your sight seeing by 10 in the morning as all the major spots get closed by 4:30PM and each spot takes a lot of time especially the Forts.

In some cases, the AutoRickshaw drivers try to bring up with some excuses that this happened or that happened so pay more, or any lame story or excuse to get some more from you after the trip is over. But stick to the original amount decided, Police in Jaipur are very friendly, in case you feel the autoRickshaw driver is trying to misguide you or forcing you for some extra money then just refer the police persons located at various spots. The cops are really friendly and caring there.

Also some autorickshaw drivers will tell you to buy artifacts and gifts from some shops especially some located on way to Amber fort. Firmly refuse to stop there as these shops operate on commission to the auto driver and fleece you. If you've got to buy some souvenirs buy them in city's main shopping areas like bapu bazzar.

Take along some of your own information about the eating and shopping places as the drivers have their fixed commissions at shops and eating outlets, so you might end up paying more for and item or eating at an undesirable place.

Autorickshaw drivers have been known to work together with the gem scammers. If you hire an autorickshaw for the day, he may suggest that you 'go for a beer' afterwards, at which point you will be introduced to the point man on the scam attempt, usually a very charismatic person who is clearly much wealthier than his rickshaw-driving 'friend'. Use common sense: why would a rickshaw driver who makes 350 rupees per day (minus petrol) want to take you to a bar where beers are 75 rupees each? Politely decline these invitations; they are nearly invariably more trouble than they are worth.

You can hire a rickshaw driver for a day to take you to all the sights. It will cost you more money, but cuts down on the hassle considerably and leaves you to enjoy the sights easily and conveniently.

===By cycle-rickshaw===

'''Cycle-rickshaws''' are cheaper, but the amount of time it takes quickly makes the extra few rupees worth it. Walking in the bazaar is a treat, although side streets are a bit less welcoming and offer a sharper glimpse of poverty.

===By taxi===

The taxis in Jaipur are very convenient and comfortable. Most of the vehicles are Maruti Omni Vans or Tata Indica cars, which are much safer than Auto rickshaws, and the drivers are polite. If you are alone or going to an unknown destination, you are strongly advised to choose this option, even though the rates will be double that of an autorickshaw. you must call for a taxi, as it is nearly impossible to hail one unless you are at a major point like the airport. When you call, you should negotiate a fare (or agree on using the meter) and get the taxi's 'number'. The taxi will come pick you up, and call you when they are close. Taxis generally have yellow license plates with black letters. Some taxis are painted with yellow & black color scheme on their body which helps to uniquely identify from the private cars.

The name has nothing to do with the rather pretty pastel yellow colour; instead, the fort is named after the town of Amber, in turn named after the goddess Amba.  The main sights within the fort include the ''Sheesh Mahal'', adorned with thousands on thousands of mirror tiles on the walls and ceiling.  The fort/palace grounds are sprawling and the information panels (hindi/english) are somewhat limited, so it might be worth getting an audio guide or a real guide. It's a bit of a hike up from the town, and the touristy thing to do is to hitch an elephant ride to the top (in order to get an elephant it is better to to arrive there in the morning, otherwise at midday the elephants are over. But the road that elephants pass is not so long). The elephant riding costs 900 (fixed government price) as of July 5th 2011.  The real guide will cost about Rs 70-100 and will also take you to the Rajasthan Kala Mandir (a government operated shop) to buy souvenirs. The guide gets a 2% commission on the items you buy.

An experience in itself, and another "don't miss." Once known as the best movie theater in India, and still the best in Rajasthan, it offers an overwhelming experience. From the pushing, shoving, and general chaos in the ticket line, to an audience that laughs, cries, cheers, claps, and consistently talks through the entire film, the Raj Mandir provides an insight into Rajasthani culture. The movies themselves are always interesting; ''Masala'' movies are action, drama, mystery, suspense, and epics all wrapped into one single movie, teeming with dances and obligatory wet sari scenes, and unabashedly lifting generous amounts of plot devices from Western movies. The theater-goers are very friendly and genuinely curious about overseas visitors who come to the Raj. Expect to answer many questions about country of origin and movie likes and dislikes, as well as take photos of theater-goers themselves with their mobile phones. Don't be put off by "House Full" notices at the entrance. The box office opens again a nominal 45 minutes before the next performance, and there are usually tickets available. Shows at 6:30PM and 9:30PM.  A great place to meet locals, with the nearby McDonald's as a central congregation spot.</do>

==Buy== 
* '''Bazaar'''. Visit the bazaar in the city centre. An evening visit is a complete assault on the senses - the colours, the sights, the sounds and the smells. There are different specialist zones, whether it's food, flowers, textiles, carved statues or plumbing. While you should always be wary (read up about gem scams thoroughly before arriving and be particularly cautious if approached by guys slightly too eager to hang out and go for drinks etc, as this can often be the beginnings of a very widespread scam which at best will waste your time and at worst cost you thousands), be sure not to completely close yourself out to the locals as one of the highlights of Rajasthan is the chance to interact with the friendly people.  It is not unheard of to be invited to homes for dinner, parties, and even weddings as many middle class young people are curious of foreigners and genuinely very hospitable as is the open culture of the region (which you will not find so widely in Delhi/Agra).

Just remember that nothing comes 'fixed price' in Jaipur, even in the self advertised Govt. (RTDC) approved shops & emporiums.There are a few RTDC approved shops along "Amer road" claiming to be Government owned and fixed price - but are overpriced by as much as three times (e. g. Rajasthan Textile Development Corporation), beware and note that some accept to take goods back.  Almost everything, from food to to transportation to handicrafts, even accomodation can be bargained down up to a 60% discount on the quoted price. The lowest rates will be found in the bazaars - Bapu &amp; Johari. Even here, keep inquiring in several shops - each one will have a different price for the same item. Don't be ashamed to spend an hour or more in each shop with the friendly shopowners sharing stories over masala chai as you look at their goods. While they are doing their best to run a business, do not overlook the genuinely hospitable culture of Rajasthani people.

A brilliant colorful explosion of flowers, elephants, ox carts, and wares. The traveller will smell the deep aroma of spices in canvas bags, the fetid smell of animals and open sewers, the sweet waft of tea, and the crusty acrid burn of dust and exhaust. The noise is chaotic, the people constantly will stare if you are a Westerner and anybody who has something to sell will try to sell it to you, repeatedly. Watch cobras dance out of their wicker baskets, and don't be too surprised if the snake charmer slaps his cobra for having a wayward eye. Be prepared to be asked for money if you plan to take photographs of snake-charmers and beggars.

*'''Rajais''' Jaipur is famous for its 'Rajais' (A type of light quilt stuffed with cotton). You can get colourful &amp; soft `Shaneel ki Rajai' in a velvet finish. These are quiet warm, soft and long lasting. You can shop in the main market area. But remember to bargain. If you want to be sure of quality and are willing you shell few extra bucks, visit govt. stores for rajais. Beware: After a tour of City Palace, some guides may take you to the shop inside the premises where they will show you how the traditional block print is done using natural colors. Then will make a sales pitch and show you overpriced rajais saying they are selling them cheap compared to market prices,that they are being run by trust and are salaried employees. Please visit the market before deciding to buy here as you will find the same rajais in the market at one-third of the price and the quality and design are not good.

==Stay safe==
Beyond the standard dangers of travelling in India (thieves, hustlers, touts, questionable drinking water), Jaipur has developed its own set of unique scams.
 
You may be accosted by youths on motorbikes who claim that Westerners are unwilling to engage with the Indian people.
"Why don't tourists want to talk to me",or "I am a student, I want to learn about your culture" is the normal opener. The scam artist then changes their tune and invites the traveller to drink  tea. Often the tourist will only be told of the gem stones the next day or after dinner. Usually it is some sort of tax problem. The unwitting mark is then sold fake stones for resale in his/her home country. Even if stones are posted in front of your eyes,you are more likely to see Elvis than the gems again. As a general rule, do not accept tea from strangers, but in addition be wary of any who invite you to talk in secluded areas. The simple fact of the matter that if you are a Westerner and a person outside your hotel accosts you, there is nearly a 100% chance that this person is scheming to acquire your money. There have been reports of smugglers trying to entice travellers to assist in smuggling items. Under no circumstances accept - smuggling is a major criminal act.

Due to the rise in complaints from travelers about being accosted by touts & con artists. The government has taken steps to ensure a hassle free experience for visitors, this includes partnering with [http://www.audiocompass.in AudioCompass], a smartphone app that serves as personal audio guide for travelers, consisting of audio guides for all attractions in Jaipur & other places of interest around the city. This eliminates the need to associate with pushy touts who visitors find to be untrustworthy due to the number of stories they hear about cheating, misbehaving, etc. This app is a tool to help visitors explore places in India independently but travelers should always exercise caution when talking to strangers or visiting unknown places.

==Get out==
