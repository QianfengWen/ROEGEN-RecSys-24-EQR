==Drink==
There is great night life here.

Try Cheers Bar in GRA every Sunday! Place is absolutely packed with guys and girls being treated to awesome music by Nick and Smart. Food is great, service is friendly and the beers are cold!

Also on weekends Wine Bar, Bunga Villa (as the locals call it) and Aristo House are great!

If you get the chance try out Tuscany, the smoking area is great and although the dance floor is small the vibe is electric! 

Sometimes locals may laugh at the way foreigners dance, this is by no means laughing to mock and cause offence, but rather joy in the difference that you bring to the situation, so don't be offended just smile back, chances are after a few drinks you will be dancing with the very people who were laughing.

You will hardly be able to find your way in Nigeria - especially in Port Harcourt - unless you have been provided earlier direction.

==Stay safe==

Port Harcourt is the centre of oil business in Nigeria. Some people have a strong feeling that the oil is "stolen" from them by local government in cooperation with foreign companies. There are frequent riots, worker strikes and regular reports of kidnapping.

Some bars and clubs, nevertheless, seem relatively safe even during the night.
