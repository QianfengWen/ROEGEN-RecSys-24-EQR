'''Calgary''' [https://www.visitcalgary.com/], [[Alberta]]'s largest city, is situated where the prairies end and the foothills begin. As such, it is the eastern gateway to the [[Rocky Mountains (Canada)|Rocky Mountains]] and an important centre of trade and tourism for the western prairies. It is your most likely point of access for [[Banff]] and [[Jasper]], and a worthwhile destination in its own right. Calgary is the heart of the largest metropolitan area between [[Toronto]] and [[Vancouver]],.

===Road development===
Calgary is divided into four quadrants: Northeast (NE), Northwest (NW), Southeast (SE) and Southwest (SW). The dividing line between east and west is Centre Street in the north, and roughly Macleod Trail in the south. The dividing line between north and south is generally the Bow River in the west, and Centre Avenue and Memorial Drive (from 36 Street) in the east. Addresses proceed outwards from the center of the city; for example, 219 16th Avenue NE is on 16th Avenue N, between 1st and 2nd Street E.

Deerfoot Trail (Highway 2) running north-south is one of two freeways in Calgary, the other being '''Stoney Trail (Highway 201)''' [https://www.transportation.alberta.ca/804.htm] which is an under-development ring road around Calgary. As of spring 2019, Stoney Trail runs north from Highway 1 West, then follows clockwise around the north, east and south sides of the city to its southern intersection with Highway 2A (Macleod Trail). A southwestern section running from Glenmore Trail to Macleod Trail is currently under construction and will open to traffic in 2021, with the remaining western section (Glenmore to Highway 1) to complete the ring to be opened in 2022. Certain other roads have sections that alternate between being a true freeway and an at-grade expressway, with plans to become full freeways. Other major roads in the city are often given the street suffix ''Trail'', such as Glenmore Trail, Crowchild Trail and Bow Trail; many of these roads are expressways for most or all of their length. Roads with the suffixes ''Boulevard'' or ''Drive'' are generally the next most major classification. Roads with the suffix ''Avenue'' run east-west, and roads with the suffix ''Street'' run north-south. Note that the names of small suburban roads usually incorporate the community name; this means that ''Taralake Garden'', ''Taralea Place'', ''Taralea Mews'', ''Taralea Court'', ''Taralean Grove'', ''Taralea Avenue'', ''Taralea Road'', ''Taralea Blvd'', ''Taralea Heath'', and ''Taralea Green'' are all separate roads, all in the same community - Taradale.   It can be very confusing for tourists and locals alike to navigate an area where the only differences in street names are the abbreviations.  If travelling in the suburban communities, have a map or directions and pay attention to exact name.

Calgary has a fairly dense downtown, ringed by inner city neighborhoods laid out on a grid pattern for roughly 30-40 blocks. These inner city districts often have unique characteristics and are worth wandering through, for the visitor with some time to spend in the city. The outer suburbs are a typical sprawl of uniform housing and, except for major shopping, parks and other facilities scattered around, have little interest for the typical visitor.

Despite the fact that Calgary technically covers a larger land area than cities of many times its population (such as New York), barring rush hour, weather or construction-related delays, it is relatively quick to travel from one end of the city to the other.

===Neighbourhoods of Interest===

'''The Beltline and 17th Avenue''': 17th Avenue S.W. is Calgary's premiere place to see and be seen. It boasts a large and eclectic variety of restaurants, unique shops, boutiques, and bars. This street is where Calgary parties, most notably becoming the "Red Mile" during the 2004 Stanley Cup (hockey) playoffs, where up to 100,000 cheering fans gathered to celebrate victories by the hometown Flames (the nickname has remained). While the entirety of the Beltline spans from the Stampede Grounds and Victoria Park on the east to Mount Royal on the west, the dense nightlife on 17th Avenue starts at about 2nd Street SW and goes to 15th Street SW.

'''Mission''': In many ways, Mission acts as an extension of 17th Avenue. Like the Beltline, it is packed full of interesting restaurants and shops. It does not share 17th Avenue's "late night" reputation, however and it generally lacks the bars and nightclubs. It runs along 4th Street SW from 17th Avenue to 26th Avenue. 

'''Forest Lawn International Avenue''' [http://www.internationalavenue.ca/]. Forest Lawn is known for its diverse culture, with the city's best Vietnamese, Lebanese, and Central American eateries lining 17th Avenue S.E. The nightlife of this area is a place to exercise caution. There are many pawn shops that line the streets, if you're looking for a deal.

'''Kensington''' [http://kensingtonyyc.com/]. Kensington is located along the Bow River on the north side of downtown. It is another one of Calgary's notable shopping neighbourhoods, with a somewhat more bohemian feel than 17th Avenue (one particular store specializes Birkenstocks and Futons). It offers a good variety of restaurants, with more of an emphasis on coffee shops than on bars. Kensington runs along Kensington Road NW from 14th St NW to 10th St NW, and also north along 10th St NW to 5 Ave NW.

'''Inglewood''': Inglewood is Calgary's oldest neighbourhood and the site of the city's original downtown. It is also one of Calgary's most culturally influenced and eclectic areas. Inglewood contains everything from stores targeted at bikers, to unique boutiques, antique stores, galleries, and restaurants. It is not as developed as some of the city's downtown districts, but it is quickly becoming one of the city's most popular "urban chic" neighbourhoods. It lies immediately east of downtown (east of 1st Street E) and is concentrated along 9th Avenue SE. Just to the north is the Bow River and the world-famous Calgary Zoo.

'''Bridgeland''' (Edmonton Trail on the west, The Campbell Hill on the east, Bridge Crescent NE on the north, and the river/Memorial/Zoo on the south) is a urban revitalization area northeast of the downtown. Although the community has been a destination for years as Calgary's "Little Italy" (hence the abundance of Italian restaurants in the area), the demolition of the old General Hospital in 1998 sparked a long-term project redevelop much of the era. The area is expected to be a family orientated Pearl District (see Portland Oregon) and the initial phases are already done.  The area includes posh shops, chic apartments, beautiful lofts, while maintaining the old charm of the distinct houses.  Eventually the neighbourhood will have more shops, and some high rise buildings.  It is a great area to walk through for those interested in architecture/planning. The far eastern end of Bridgeland connects with the Calgary Zoo and the newly opened Telus Spark science centre.

'''Marda Loop'''/'''Garrison Woods''' (east of Crowchild Trail along 33rd Avenue SW), which contains a large number of quaint shops, restaurants, and services and is a real up and comer area and would be a great place to check out. Marda Loop, centered on the intersection of 33rd Avenue and 20th Street S.W., is the older of the two areas and in mid-August hosts the Marda Gras Street Festival along 33 Avenue between 19 St. and 23 St. S.W. Garrison Woods is a recently developed residential/shopping district immediately to the south of 32 Avenue that features its own mix of eclectic shops and old-towne storefronts.

'''Parkhill''' is a neighbourhood south of downtown.  It is a quite wealthy area that was once home to many old homes.  Today it is home to a range of modern designs, with few old homes still standing.  It's a very interesting neighbourhood to go to.

'''Mount Royal''' is a neighbourhood south of the Downtown with charming old homes, that doesn't conform to the old street grid (that was used back then).  The area houses some of Calgary's elite.  It is a nice area to do a quiet nice stroll through, admiring old residential. Driving around the community can be challenging due to the preponderance of "traffic calming" and street closures to prevent cut-through traffic.

'''McKenzie Towne''' is located on the southeastern outskirts of Calgary (accessible via Deerfoot Trail and McKenzie Towne Boulevard). An exception to the "dull suburb" stereotype, this planned community features parks and classical home facades that come right out of a Norman Rockwell painting. Anchoring the area is High Street, a shopping centre disguised as a classic small-town main street. Worth checking out if you've rented a car to visit Spruce Meadows.

===History===
Calgary was founded by the Northwest Mounted Police in 1876 and was originally called Fort Briseboise and later changed to Fort Calgary.  It was founded in response to a surge of whiskey traders who traded for furs from the natives.  In 1883, the first rail station was built and Calgary started to grow in every direction and became an agricultural and business hub.  In 1894, it was renamed the City of Calgary.  By 1902, oil was discovered, though it didn't mean much until 1947.  After, during the fifties, oil became big in Calgary and major companies started heading to Calgary and opening offices.  The boom extended into the next twenty years bringing the city to 720,000 people in the metro area by 1985.  The relatively low-key low-rise downtown became filled with a sea of skyscrapers, starting with the Calgary Tower and some sixties towers.  By the 80s, Calgary's luck turned, and a drop in oil prices sent the Calgary metro economy downward.  High unemployment raged, vacancies became a reality,and growth was slow or even negative in some years.  In 1988, Calgary held the Winter Olympics and brought world attention to Calgary.  By the 1990s, it was on the rebound and began growing again. Calgary today has become a more cosmopolitan city of over one million inhabitants with genuine attempts to diversify its economy and expand its attractiveness to outside visitors.

Calgary is sunny and rather dry, with wide seasonal and daily temperature ranges. Summers tend to be sunny and mild, averaging highs of about 23&deg;C (73&deg;F) in July/August, usually accompanied by short afternoon storms - June being typically the wettest month. Hot weather (greater than 30&deg;C / 86&deg;F) is rare, occuring on average five times a year. Also temperatures typically drop dramatically during rain days as well (there's always a couple days in the summer months that barely manage highs over 10&deg;C (50&deg;F)).

Winter can also vary quite a bit. Temperatures can get extremely cold (below -20&deg;C / -4&deg;F) at times between November and March, while -30&deg;C (-22&deg;F) is possible (on average five times a year). Though average highs in January are about -2&deg;C (28&deg;F) based on a current 30-year average, there's nothing average with Calgary's weather. Because of the regular but unpredictable Chinooks (warm Pacific winds), there's no guarantee of when the cold weather strikes - one of coldest months in the last ten years has been a March (about -6&deg;C / 21&deg;F for average high), while a January has recorded one of the mildest (+6&deg;C / 43&deg;F average high). Temperatures can swell into the 15&deg;C (59&deg;F) range one day, and dip back into the sub-zero (sub 32&deg;F) temperatures several days later. A typical Chinook rolls in fast (and windy), and the effects will usually linger for several days to more than a week.

Regardless of the time of year, temperatures usually drop quickly at night. Lows in summer hover around 8c, while in winter they average about -13c. Because of the elevation, proximity to the mountains, and dramatic temperature drops, seeing some snow falling as late as June, and as early as September is a regular occurrence - but this usually results in a "trace" of snow on the ground at most.

As mentioned, having a variety of clothes is essential at all times in the year. Packing shorts and sandals to light, windproof jacket or fleece from mid-May to mid-October, and everything from T-shirts to fleece/ski jackets, gloves, scarves from mid-Oct to mid-May works best. There's not typically a lot of snow on the ground since Calgary is located in a very dry region of North America and the regular Chinooks melt any snow, so heavy boots aren't typically needed. The close-by Rockies are typically cooler year-round, so plan accordingly for any day-trips.

Being a major Canadian airport, YYC Calgary International has US border pre-clearance facilities; if your flight goes from Calgary to the United States, you will go through US Customs and Border Protection immediately after check in. Thus you get off the plane at your stateside destination as if you were on a domestic flight and make quicker connections there.  The price for this perk is that you should budget more time when departing; most airlines recommend for you to check in at least 90 minutes before flight time when traveling to the US.

The airport is served by "Calgary White Hat Volunteers", mostly retirees dressed in red and white Western wear who are quite friendly and more than happy to direct you and answer questions. 

Like most large airports, there are many options for getting into the city. Here is a brief summary of options for connecting between downtown and the airport:

*'''Simplest''': Taxi ($40-45 typically) [http://www.calgaryairport.com/Default.aspx?cid=64&lang=1] Should take 20 minutes on a good day.

*'''Easy''': Private shuttles ($15 per person) [http://www.airportshuttlecalgary.ca/schedules] These offer scheduled service to downtown hotels. Many hotels also operate their own free shuttle buses.

*'''Still easy''': Calgary Transit bus 300-Airport/City Centre ($10/adult from airport to downtown which is purchased with credit/debit or coins from the ticket vending machine next to the pick up area.  Cash not accepted in the machine but can be deposited in the bus fare box.  $3.25 from downtown to airport, exact change only.) [https://www.calgarytransit.com/sites/default/files/route/300_airport-brochure.pdf] This fully accessible express bus (with room for luggage) leaves the airport every 20-30 minutes running from 5:30AM to midnight everyday. Board at bus bay 20 on the arrivals level. Travel time to downtown is estimated at 30-45 minutes. The bus runs both ways with several pick-up/drop-off locations in downtown.
 
*'''Alternative''' ''(but slowest)'': Calgary Transit bus 100-Airport/McKnight Station and Light Rail Transit (LRT) [https://www.calgarytransit.com/schedules-maps/airport-service-routes]($3.25/adult, tickets purchased at ticket vending machine with coins or credit/debit cards) Take the 100-Airport/McKnight Station bus to McKnight-Westwinds LRT Station and board a train heading toward the city centre. The bus runs every 20-30 minutes, stopping at 1AM on weekdays and earlier on the weekend. Since the train isn't really designed for air travelers, there will be little room for luggage, especially during rush hour. However the bus and all stations are fully accessible and have elevators available. Board the bus at bay 20 on the arrivals level of the terminal. Travel time is estimated at about 60 minutes.

*'''Also possible''': Car rentals are also available as at any airport.

For connections to other parts of the city by transit, consult the Calgary Transit website [http://www.calgarytransit.com], or call the service centre at +1 (403) 262-1000.

===By car===
Calgary is just over an hour's drive East of Banff (on the Trans-Canada highway, #1, which in turn links Calgary to the west coast), and about 3 hours South of Edmonton on highway #2. From the U.S. side, the I-15 connects with Alberta Highway 4, which in turn leads to [[Lethbridge]]; follow Highway 3 west of Lethbridge to Highway 2 and then north to Calgary; Calgary is about 200 miles (320 km) north of the U.S. border. The Trans-Canada also enters from the east, bringing motorists coming from [[Saskatchewan]], [[Manitoba]] and points east.

==== By Limos====
While in Calgary you can choose to travel in style and comfort by reserving a limousine. Most limousine companies offer a variety of transportation options from stretch limousines, vans, shuttles, buses, sedans, and SUV's - depending on the travel needs of the client or clients.

===By bus===

* '''Red Arrow''', [http://www.redarrow.ca].  Provides service to several Alberta cities, including [[Edmonton]], with a somewhat more accessible bus stop on 9th Ave at 1st St SE.

===By train===
Due to service cuts back in 1990, There is currently no rail service to Calgary.

==Get around==
[[Image:Calgary downtown map.png|thumb|450px|right|Calgary's downtown]]

===By transit (train/bus)===
Calgary can be surprisingly fairly easy to get to most destinations of interest on bus/rail easily.  This would be important for those not renting a vehicle, not within walking distance to all destinations that are desired, or not using taxis.
[[Image:CalgaryCTrainMap20130918.jpeg|thumb|400px|right|C-Train map as of September 2013]]

Calgary's public transit system was first established in 1909 as the Calgary Municipal Railway. Since then, it has developed into an efficient, fast, and extensive transit system. In particular, it was significantly built up in preparation for the 1988 Winter Olympics.  The light rail transit system is called the '''C-Train''' (LRT) and runs faithfully and frequently.  In the downtown core, you can ride the C-Train for 14 city blocks for free, along the length of 7th Avenue. There are four spurs of LRT track meeting in the downtown along 7th Avenue; the Red Line starts in the far south (at Somerset-Bridlewood station), travels through downtown to the northwest, traveling to Tuscany Station in the northwest. The Blue Line starts in the northeast at Saddletowne Station, and travels through downtown, ending at 69 Street Station on the SW leg. Both lines share the 7th Ave corridor. Trains are marked with the end station they are traveling to; a 'Somerset' train leaves Tuscany Station, travels south into the downtown, then south to Somerset station (where it turns around to become a 'Tuscany' train). Be sure to go by the destination declared in the FRONT of the train, as the rear of the train often displays where the train came from, not where it is going.  Starting in 2016 the train signs will also have red or blue LED lights on the front signage to indicate which line but not all trains have been retrofitted with this feature.  Check the website to see schedules and if the C-Train is down for maintenance. Unfortunately, the C-Train does not serve the Calgary International Airport, although bus connections exist. 

Although buses come along somewhat less often, and tend to serve commuters more than tourists, it is still possible to get around to the main places without too much difficulty. Bus routes are numbered, and generally designed to connect with the downtown or with an LRT station. Trains run every 10 minutes (5 minutes or less in rush hour and 15 minutes on general holidays), serving from around 4 AM to 1 AM. The exception to this schedule is when the Calgary Stampede, which occurs at the beginning of July, is in session. On those days, the trains run 24hrs a day [http://www.calgarytransit.com/stampede/index.html]. Major bus routes may run as early as 5 AM and late as 1 AM, but many more only operate until 8 or 9 PM, or, worse, during rush hours only. Bus frequencies can be as low as one per hour, although 30 minutes is more common.

Transit tickets are $3.30 for adults, and permit 90 minutes of travel connecting to any transit line. Day passes ($9.50) and books of 10 transit tickets ($3.15) are also available at most convenience stores and at two Calgary Transit offices downtown. A monthly pass can also be purchased for unlimited usage within the ticket's designated month ($106). The C-Train operates on a honour system, although inspectors do occasionally check riders for valid tickets, with expensive fines ($150 or more) being charged; inspectors may board trains and ask to see tickets or passes, or they will be placed near station exit points. Travel on the C-Train in the downtown free fare zone (between the Downtown West-Kerby Centre and City Hall stations) is free of charge.

Information about the Transit System is available on the Calgary Transit Web Page [http://www.calgarytransit.com], or by phoning their information line (403)262-1000 from 6:00 AM to 9:00 PM, local time.

===By car===
It is easy to be confused by Calgary's quadrant address system at first, but it is very logical, and, well, systematic.

Streets run north-south and avenues run east-west. Centre St divides the city into east and west, and Centre Ave (and parts of the Bow River) divide the city into north and south. Together these split the city into NE, NW, SE, and SW: the four quadrants. Thus any time you get an address on a numbered street, you MUST get whether it was NE, NW, SE, or SW. Street and avenue numbers--and thus addresses--increase as you move away from Centre St or Ave.

Many of Calgary's roads are numbered, but this is less common in the newer developments. Important roads are usually called "trails," but there are many exceptions. Note that newly-built neighbourhoods may not yet appear on maps, whether they be paper or GPS. If you are travelling to these places, it may be a good idea to ask for directions beforehand.

In general the city's driving situation is a result of rapid, unanticipated growth, so prepare for the roads being grossly inadequate and gridlocked during rush hour. Also watch for lane reversal rules during these peak times on weekdays (6:30 am-8:30am and 3:30pm-6:30pm) when going in and out of downtown on some larger streets. This increases the traffic flow in one direction by "borrowing" a lane normally going the other way.

Keep in mind that driving in winter is very different from driving in other seasons. Major roads are plowed, salted, and sanded, but often smaller residential streets are not at all. Note that as of fall 2011 the city has instituted Snow Route parking bans. This means after a heavy snowfall certain priority routes in the city - marked as snow removal routes with street signs - become no parking zones for 72 hours; this includes some residential streets, so bear this in mind if you're visiting family and parked on the street during the winter.

As confounding as driving in Calgary may be driving is still the best way to explore and see the city.

=== On foot ===
Downtown Calgary is a compact area which is easily accessible on foot.  The pathway system, Eau Claire Market area and Stephen Avenue Mall (8th Avenue) are the primary walking destinations of downtown workers in the warmer months.  In the wintertime, everyone navigates their way around the downtown core via the Plus 15 system [http://www.calgary.ca/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_2_786_203_0_43/http%3B/content.calgary.ca/CCA/City+Hall/Business+Units/Land+Information+and+Mapping/eMaps/City+Maps/Getting+Around/Plus+15+Downtown.htm], so called because the enclosed walkways joining buildings are approximately 15 feet above ground.

=== By bicycle ===
With approximately 635 km of pathways and 260 km of on-street bikeways within its boundaries, The City of Calgary boasts the most extensive urban pathway and bikeway network in North America. Pathway maps are available online [http://www.calgary.ca/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_2_425155_0_0_18/Pathways+and+Bikeways+Map+.htm] or at Calgary Co-op [http://www.calgarycoop.com] stores.  Downtown, there are many pathways along the rivers and park areas.  Though Calgary can be thought of as a safe city, use common sense when biking at dusk and at night. This is particularly true on the east side of downtown along the river (close to the neighborhood of East Side Village), which is a rougher end of town. 

Calgary has a good network of off-street bike paths, although motorists are sometimes less-than-courteous. Weather is unpredictable, and snowy cycling conditions may occur anytime from September to May. Bike racks are fairly common, especially in shopping areas.  Be sure to use the bike racks provided, or another solid object to lock you bike to; as simply locking your back wheel will not provide sufficient security. Calgary Transit has bike racks at C-Train stations and allows bikes on the C-Trains during off-peak hours (at no additional fee).  Some bike routes also have buses equipped to accommodate bicycles with racks on the front [http://www.calgary.ca/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_0_104_0_0_35/http%3B/content.calgary.ca/CCA/City+Hall/Business+Units/Transportation+Planning/Transportation+Solutions/Cycling/Cycling+and+Transit.htm].  Cyclists must remember that they must obey the same rules of the road as other vehicles  [http://www.calgary.ca/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_0_104_0_0_35/http%3B/content.calgary.ca/CCA/City+Hall/Business+Units/Transportation+Planning/Transportation+Solutions/Cycling/Bylaws+Safety+and+Education/Rules+of+the+Road.htm].  All cyclists under the age of 18 are required to wear a helmet, and all cyclists must have an working bell on their bike.

Each major body of water in the city (bow river, elbow river, Glenmore reservoir, etc) will have both city parks and thus city bike trails passing through. These bike paths are heavily used during the morning rush hour to work, but can provide hours of scenic peddling. A scenic route starts in downtown and head along the "bow river pathway" as it heads south to Fishcreek provincial park. Here, leave the banks of the bow river and cycle though Fishcreek Park park along the main cycle path path until you reach the Glenmore reservoir (a good place for lunch). At the reservoir, as the bike path crosses the Dam, leave the "bow river pathway" for the "Elbow river pathway" This highly scenic path will take you back to downtown. Cycle time : 4 -6 hours (with lunch).

Another major pathway extends north up Nose Creek valley just east of the zoo, including two overpasses to cross Deerfoot Trail (busy freeway). While there is a pathway that leads to the airport, connecting to it requires crossing an industrial area, which is not recommended for novice cyclists.  Cyclists are not permitted on Stephen Avenue Mall or Deerfoot Trail.

===Architecture===

Calgary has some highlights that may be worth visiting/seeing for those interested in architecture. '''The Bow''' is the newest modern masterpiece of glass and steel and would be a shame to miss (but really how could you?  The Bow pierces through the skyline from pretty much any angle).  Stephen Avenue and Atlantic Avenue both have an abundance of tightly packed, small, old commercial buildings with great architectural details.  The '''Calgary Tower''' is a beautiful early modern tower with a minimalist design that, even if you don't care for the design, shouldn't miss if only for the views.  One could also stroll the construction mazes of '''Macleod Trail''' and '''Scarth St/1 Street SE''' for many beautiful modern condominiums.

==Do==

===Urban shopping===

*'''Inglewood''', centred of Atlantic Avenue (9 Ave SE) east of the Elbow (river), this quirky neighborhood is almost devoid of chain businesses (save maybe a Starbucks), leaving a sea of unique businesses.  The highlights are the coffee shops, art galleries, trendy clothiers, and upscale furniture shops.  This is arguably Calgary's best urban shopping area.

*'''Stephen Avenue''' is in the heart of the Central Business Area of the Downtown and as a number is 8 Av SW.  It is home mostly to restaurants and some bars, but you will still find shops like HMV fronting it.  The Avenue is also home to most of the Downtown malls which are all coming together in one giant renovation into '''the Core''' which should be completed in the near-future.

*'''17 Avenue SW''' is Calgary's most well known urban business street and is home to chains like the Source and Le Chateau, and more independent-focused businesses like Megatunes.  If you literally drop from all the shopping, the heart of the strip is this little park called '''Tompkins Park''', filled with nice shading from summer heat and cozy benches.

*'''Kensington District''', centred on 10 Street NW and Kensington Road NW is home to art galleries, fashion retailers, and antiques.  It is somewhat more upscale than say Stephen or Atlantic, but not in a snobby way.

===Suburban shopping=== 
*'''Chinook Centre''' [http://www.chinookcentre.com/] is on Macleod Trail at 58th Avenue south close to the Chinook C-Train station.  This is Calgary's largest mall and is one of the best shopping experiences in the city for variety and amount of retail shops. An extension opened in 2010. This new section includes many high-end luxury retailers, such as Burberry, Harry Rosen, Anthropologie, Scotch & Soda, and Tory Burch. 
*'''Market Mall''' [http://www.marketmall.ca/home/index.ch2] is in the northwest near The University of Calgary.

Similar in format to other "Mills" malls, it has many well-known stores and outlets. When it opened in 2009 it was the first new enclosed mall to be built in the Calgary area in a generation. Plan on driving, however, there is a limited mall-owned free shuttle for mall workers at the end of the line C-train station in the north-east, if you're lucky you might be able to get on it. Store highlights include the province's only branch of Bass Pro Shops (worth checking out for the spectacular wildlife and hunting displays inside), Pro Hockey Life, Bed, Bath & Beyond, Indigo Books, a multiplex movie theatre, and even one of the only Canadian locations of Nathan's Famous Hot Dogs.</buy>
*If you take the time to drive out to CrossIron Mills, it may be worth driving the extra five minutes further on Highway 2 to the city of [[Airdrie (Alberta)|Airdrie]], which has its own eclectic shopping scene including the "Where On Earth Did You Get That?" antique mall.

==Eat==

Calgary offers a wide variety of dining options. While Calgary doesn't have a single signature dish, residents are very proud of Alberta Beef, and Calgarians are discerning clients of steakhouses.  Speaking of beef, the popular Chinese-Canadian dish of ginger beef was invented in Calgary in the 1970s. The Ceasar, a variation of the Bloody Mary, which uses Clamato instead of tomato juice originated here. Calgary is also home to a very culturally diverse population, with a very wide selection of international restaurants, especially from East and Southeast Asia, and the Mediterranean from Italy through Lebanon. The inland location means that a good meal of seafood is sometimes hard to find.

Restaurants in the downtown area are very busy between noon and 1 PM on weekdays due to the lunch crowd of office workers; if you can, try to stagger your lunch to start around 11:15 or 1:30. You'll face much shorter lineups. Buffets are often only prepared once for lunchtime, and visiting a buffet after 12:15 or so will typically be a depressing dining experience.

Calgary is also the city of founding for major Canadian restaurant chain, Moxies.

===Budget===

Note that Calgary's most abundant ethnic specialty is Vietnamese. Most neighbourhoods have at least one Vietnamese noodle shop or Vietnamese sub (banh mi) joint. Some of the other inexpensive options are as follows:

*'''4th Spot''' is a charming neighborhood pub located in Mount Pleasant.  Located at 2620, 4th Street NW.

*'''Chianti''' is an Italian restaurant with many branches in Calgary. You can get any of their awesome pastas for $7.99 during pasta nights (Sun, Mon, Tues) otherwise around $10 during the rest of the week. Bread is served free of charge.

*'''Chicken On The Way''', 1443 Kensington Road NW, ''+1 403'' 283-5545. One of the longest-running fast food institutions in Calgary (opened 1958), Chicken On The Way delivers wonderful deep-fried chicken, french fries and corn fritters, at a fair price. This is an old-school joint; no frills, nothing fancy, and none of that new-fangled low-fat junk. The dining space is two picnic tables next to busy 14th St. But it's still hands-down the best fried chicken in the city. A meal runs in the $4 - 6 range.

*'''Falafel King''', 803 1 St SW, ''+1 403'' 269-5464. The friendly service and top-quality Middle Eastern food means that there's a lineup out the door evey lunch hour. Falafel, chicken and beef shawarma, and the best hummus in the city on the menu, with a free piece of baklava with every order, and fresh-squeezed juice on tap. Hail to the King, baby. $6-7.

*'''Louie's Sub & Pizza,''' 1941 Uxbridge Dr. N.W, ''+1 403'' 289-8070. Best Subs in the city. Also you will find an Excellent Gourmet Pizza Selection, Chicken Souvlaki, Salads and Tina's Famous Homemade Baklava. Delivery is available. www.louiesub.com. A meal runs in the $4 - 8 range.

*'''Peter's Drive-in''', 219 16 Ave NE, ''+1 403'' 277-2747. Peter's Drive-In is a classic drive-through burger joint.  Great fries, burgers and milkshakes at very affordable prices, and higher quality (and large portions -- watch out for the "large" = shoebox of fries).  Well known throughout Alberta. Rather than waiting in the drive-through line, park in the adjacent lot and walk up to the front windows; you'll get faster service, and you can eat on one of the picnic tables. Burger, shake and onion rings will cost about $8. Peter's Drive-in now accepts cash and debit as a forms of payment. They serve the finest milkshake in the city; thick and made with real fruit (over 20 flavours!). 

*'''Pho Pasteur Saigon''', 207 1st St SE, ''+1 403'' 233-0477. Pho Pasteur Saigon is a favourite Vietnamese noodle joint. Filling and tasty and all for around $6. If they're busy, try Little Vietnamese Village, at the south entrance to the mall (half a block south), or Pho Hoai, located inside the mall.

*'''Spolumbo's''', 1308 9 Ave SE, ''+1 403'' 264-6452. Owned by former Calgary Stampeders players, Spolumbo's offers delicious Italian style deli foods; sandwiches, soups and salads. An in-house sausage plant makes some of Calgary's finest sausage. Try the Spolumbo's Special, a panini sandwich featuring mortadella, capicolla and genoa salami. Fresh and delicious, but a little pricey; $7-8 for a typical sandwich.

*'''Super Donair Kabab Restaurant''', 1018 9 Ave SE, ''+1 403'' 262-2930. This is a restaurant even Calgarians don't really know about; located in a grimy hole-in-the-wall next to a bottle depot in an out-of-the-way part of Inglewood, billed as "a touch of excellence for classy people" (the excellence part is true) and decorated with a kitschy style all its own. Kim, the charismatic owner/cook, makes some of the finest Donairs in the city, with wonderful beef and magnificent sauce; a donair and drink can be had for just $5. 

*'''Tubby Dog''', 1022 17th Ave SW, ''+1 403'' 244-0694.  Tubby Dog is a hot dog restaurant right on 17th, close to many of the bars.  They offer huge hotdogs with toppings like nacho cheese, bacon bits, peanut butter and jelly, captain crunch, fried eggs, sausage and potato chips.  Some nights they have a DJ spinning in the corner, and other nights they have video game tournaments.  Expect to wait in line if planning on going on a Friday or SAturday after partying on 17th.

*'''Wicked Wedge''', 618 17th Ave SW, ''+1 403'' 228-1024. The Wedge offers pizza-by-the-slice, but a cut above all other such joints. Innovative pizzas, lots of toppings and hand made crusts have made the Wicked Wedge a local landmark. Located on 17th Avenue, they draw a heavy after-bar crowd, and are busiest at 2AM on a Friday night! One of the best places to go for late-night food. $3.50 a slice.

==Stay safe==

===Law enforcement in Calgary===
Calgary Police Service is the primary law enforcement in Calgary and the surrounding areas. 

Although Calgary is generally a very safe place, walking at night should be avoided in the East Village and Victoria Park areas of downtown (generally speaking, this is the area adjacent to the Stampede Grounds and north to the Bow River). 

Calgary drivers are typical drivers for a mid sized western North American city.  Culturally, Calgary is a mash up of small town culture and big city living and driving in Calgary is no exception.  If you come from a small town in rural North America the drivers would be considerably more aggressive than you are used to. If you are from a larger busier urban area, or are from Europe for instance, Calgary drivers can be considered quite timid and under skilled.  A driver from New York, London or even Montreal and Toronto would consider the Calgary driver to lack confidence more than anything. Calgarians are generally quite aware of pedestrians and usually give pedestrians right of way, as required by law. Calgarians are very safe and cautious (some consider overly cautious) drivers though.  Note though that Calgarians are probably some of the best inclement weather drivers in the world.  Blizzards, storms, floods, etc. are where Calgarian drivers shine compared to the rest of the worlds drivers and they can navigate them safely with the minimum of problems.  Although nowhere near as congested and confusing as L.A. freeways or the 401 in Toronto, the Deerfoot Trail is to be avoided if you're not comfortable with 100 km/h freeway driving, and even by experts at rush hour (accidents occur on a daily basis). A secondary freeway, Stoney Trail, now exists on the north side of the city providing an alternate, less hectic route.

Be aware of lengthy wait times at the emergency rooms of the city's hospitals. Due to severe cutbacks in health care, waiting times may take up to 1 to 2 hours to see an emergency doctor. 

Panhandlers are a sight in Calgary's downtown core. The majority of them just need to be told 'No' but some can be persistent. Panhandlers have also been found at signalized intersections, holding a cap or hand out to drivers stopped at red lights.

Take care when crossing LRT tracks, as the trains are quiet. There are no electrified rails. There are usually bells and barriers at pedestrian crossings; heed them.

Boaters on the Bow River should note the Calgary White Water Park (Harvie Passage) located just downstream of the Calgary Zoo; heed the warning signs. People have perished here, the strongest swimmers among them.

Driving within Calgary can be dangerous in the winter months. This is because despite its lack of heavy snow, temperatures still remain below freezing and thus allow ice to form on many roads. The most dangerous times are when the ice is a clear sheet which resembles the road, rightly called "Black Ice". The most dangerous times to drive in these conditions are the 2-3 days immediately following the first major snowfall of the year, or after a period of warmer weather.

Weather in Calgary is unpredictable. It is always best to dress in layers and come prepared for extremes, even within the same day.
