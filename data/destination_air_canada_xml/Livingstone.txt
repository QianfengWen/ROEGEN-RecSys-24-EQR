'''Livingstone''' is to [[Zambia]] what the town of [[Victoria Falls (Zimbabwe)|Victoria Falls]] is to [[Zimbabwe]].  Also known as '''Maramba''', it was once the capital of Zambia before it was moved to [[Lusaka]].  Livingstone is in the [[Southern Province (Zambia)|Southern Province]] of [[Zambia]].

:''The falls are on the border between [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Zambia]].  For information on the Zimbabwean side (including a comparison of the sides) see [[Victoria Falls]].''

==Understand ==

==Get in==
===By plane'===
[[Livingstone]] has its own airport ({{ICAO|LVI}}), and flights arrive daily.  
*British Airways [http://www.ba.com] and South African Airways [http://www.flysaa.com] fly between [[Livingstone]] and [[Johannesburg]].  Kulula (operated by BA) often has great prices [http://www.kulula.com]
*ProFlight Zambia [http://www.proflight-zambia.com] flies between [[Livingstone]] and other destinations in [[Zambia]] and has several flights between [[Livingstone]] and [[Lusaka]] each day. 
*SA Airlink [http://www.flyairlink.com/] flies between [[Livingstone]] and [[Nelspruit]].

The Livingstone International Airport was renamed Harry Mwaanga Nkumbula International Airport - he was an integral part of Zambia's independence movement.

You can also fly into [[Victoria Falls (Zimbabwe)]] (airport code VFA),  Livingstone's sister city,  on the [[Zimbabwe]] side of the border.

===By train===
Rail services have been cut back in recent years. A twice-weekly overnight train from [[Kitwe]] via Lusaka, taking around 40 hours is still running. Also, a third-class only train connects with [[Mulobezi]] once a week.

===By bus===
Relatively comfortable luxury buses travel between [[Lusaka]] and Livingston. Tickets may be purchased one day in advance at the bus terminal in [[Lusaka]]. The most reliable bus operator is '''Mazhandu Family Bus''' takes 6 and a half hours. They have seat number system, so there is no need to fight for your seat when boarding. Reserve tickets in advance from the blue kiosk on Mosi-Oa-Tunya Rd. If taking the overnight bus from Livingstone to Lusaka, note that the Lusaka station can be dangerous at night. Either ask the bus driver to help you find a taxi or wait on the bus with the other passengers until daylight. Other bus companies also operates this route, about 6 departures per day. Uncomfortable things with these buses are that most of them have five seat on row, so space per passenger is not too much. These buses transport you in 6 hours to downtown Livingstone (total distance 470 km), near a taxi rank. It is also possible to catch a minibus from [[Lusaka]], for about the same price.

There are some buses from the [[Kazungula]] border with [[Botswana]]. Some of these buses come from other routes and could be crowded.

Coming from Namibia there are two buses per day that originate in Mongu and stop in [[Sesheke]]. The road from Sesheke to Kazungula is in very poor condition and the ride will be bumpy. Total duration of the trip is 5 to 6 hours.

===By car===
If you are aching to rent a car and drive yourself around [[Zambia]], this might be the trip for you.  The roads between Livingstone and [[Lusaka]] are among the country's best, and the trip involves only one left turn. 

For the international driver, roads lead into Livingstone from [[Victoria Falls (Zimbabwe)]].  You can buy a temp. import permit at your port of entry, for 1 month, 3 months or longer. Also a Zambian third party insurance is mandatory, next to reflective stickers or reflectors at the front of your vehicle (white) and at the back (red). Dimensions must be 5 x 5 cm, however rectangular is permitted as well.

===By taxi===
If coming from [[Victoria Falls (Zimbabwe)]], you can cross the border on foot, but you will need to get a blue taxis into Livingstone town.  They charge about 10 USD for the trip. Minibuses charge about 5000 ZMK.  Taxis are waiting just the border post.

Coming from Botswana, there are 3 to 5 taxis that are always waiting whenever the border is open. A shared taxi should cost 50 KZW per person and renting the entire taxi will be 200 KZW. It takes 1 hour to travel between Kanzungula and Livingstone.

==Get around==
The city of Livingstone -- where the bulk of the accommodation, restaurants, nightclubs, etc. are located -- is relatively small.  Most likely, you will be comfortable walking around town.  However, if you prefer not to, taxis prowl constantly. Official taxis are ones which are blue and have a red number plate. If you flag a taxi down on your way to the town centre, the driver may ask whether you are booking the taxi or not. If you are booking, you should pay full fare and driver is taking you to your doorstep. If you don't book, it means that you pay only for one seat and the driver can pick up other passengers who are going in the same direction.

The city sits about 6 miles/10km from The Falls, making it long enough to not want to walk.  The going rate for a taxi is U.S. $10 in each direction between the town and the falls.  However, if you are prepared to haggle you may get a lower price. Journeys to 5-star hotels tend to cost substantially more than the average journey but are still relatively inexpensive. If the hotel or guesthouse is arranging the taxi for you to the Falls, the price might be higher than what you can get when negotiating with the driver directly. The middle man needs money too!

[[Image:Zambia victoria falls footbridge.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Consider hiring a raincoat before you walk through the park]]

=== Victoria Falls park ===

[[Victoria Falls]], a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is one of the most amazing sights in the world.  Twice as tall as [[Niagara Falls]], and several times longer, Victoria Falls affords visitors a once-in-a-lifetime sightseeing experience. It might not be the very biggest, but few will debate that it's the most spectacular. If it is the official records you are after, the Victoria Falls is the largest curtain of falling water in the world.

Thanks to a well-designed park, visitors can touch the waters of the Zambezi just meters before it plunges over the falls; cross the gorge on a narrow bridge that provides spectacular views; and take thousands of photos - without a single one being redundant.

Wet weather gear is for hire as you enter the park.  Turn left to walk in front of the gorge and see the water, take the track to the right to see the water just before it drops.  Consider possibly doing the walk upriver first, as it may be less appealing when you are already soaking wet.  Think about how you are going to keep your camera dry.

An admission fee is payable as you enter the park.  The ticket is valid for multiple entries on the same day.  There is limited food or drink inside the park. There is a small stand that sells bottled water and cold drinks.  There are a couple of food stalls near the curio markets

=== Other sights === 

*The '''Livingstone Museum''' costs $5 and is worth breezing through.  Has a natural history section, as well as an area describing the independence of Zambia from (naturally) a very Zambian perspective.  There is a curio shop in the museum, and many touts out the front.  A curious piece of information is that Zambians did not have access to a wheel until Europeans brought one in the 19th Century.

==Do==

Don't forget the activities  at [[Victoria Falls (Zimbabwe)#Do|on the other side of the falls]].

=== Adventure activities ===

Victoria Falls is becoming an adventurer's paradise.  In recent years, many "extreme sports" have appeared, including:

* '''White Water Rafting''' -- boasting several Class V rapids, the roiling waters south of the Falls provide 18 of the world's best rapids literally starting in the gorge of Victoria falls in the Boiling Pot, right under Victoria Falls Bridge.  Several outfitters ('''Bundu''' and Safari Par Exellence) have popped up in the past few years to take the courageous down the river.  The rafting, itself, can be physical.  You finish on a lovely sandy beach and then there is a cable car at the end of the day to get you out of the steep gorge..  The cost is well worth it ($155 for a full day) and includes lunch, dinner and refreshments.

* You can '''body board''' the first few rapids (it is advisable that you be able to swim fairly well or you won't get the most out of it) 

* '''Bungi Jumping''' from the bridge spanning [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]] is very popular.  The location affords a spectacular view of the Falls -- behind you, on the Zam side -- and the Victoria Hotel -- in front of you, on the Zim side.  The cost is $160 per jump or there is the Big Air Combo for $210 where dare devils can do one bungi, one bridge swing and one zip line.

* '''The Zambezi Swing''' For $95, this group lets you abseil, rap jump, do a zip line, and -- the highlight -- a gorge swing.  While Bungi Jumping is over in a few minutes, these guys let you play all day.

* '''Livingstone Island''' a trip to Livingstone Island is '''unmissable'''. An island situated in the Zambezi river, 2 or 3 feet from the top of the Victoria Falls on the Zambian side. Trips leave from the Royal Livingstone Hotel and cost about $95 including breakfast. You will have the opportunity to stand in shallow water, 2 inches (literally) from where the water gushes over the edge of the falls, and swim in Devil's Pool, a reasonable current-free pool a couple of feet from the top of the falls, close enough to lean over the edge. This makes fantastic photo opportunities with a permanent rainbow from the mist of the falls behind you.  Livingstone island itself opens during July when the water levels and currents drop to make the transport safe.  Devils Pool opens a few weeks later.   Book with a reputable company as this is a dangerous activity and unregistered access to the island is illegal (ask at your hotel or hostel).

*Batoka Sky and United Air Charters offer '''helicopter pleasure flights''' over the Falls, for $180 per person for a 15 min flight (2015 season). This is a spectacular way to see the Falls and highly recommendable. A 30 minute flight for $360 is also possible, combining the magnificent view of the Falls with flight over the gorge and game viewing over Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park. Just as important, however, it's a neat way to get to see the Zambezi River -- look for alligators attacking prey! -- and to see exactly how the River has moved over time.  It's truly awesome to see how nature has carved away at the landscape.

*Batoka Sky also offers '''microlight rides''' over the Falls. This provides a much closer view of the Falls than the helicopter ride, but it does not give you as broad of a view. The microlights do not fly on windy days. Prices are $185 for 15min or $366 for 30min. Photos, taken from a camera mounted on the microlight, cost US$30 extra.

*Another option is the elephant back safari run by Elephant Trails. However, consider that numerous tour operators worldwide have stopped offering elephant rides because of the harm they cause to the animals [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/news/Elephant-rides-dropped-over-welfare-fears/] 

*It's possible to walk with several young lions in a park in Zimbabwe.  It costs $160 and is well worth the expense.  Inquire at your hostel or hotel.

*Several companies provide a '''sunset booze cruise''' on the Zambezi, above the Falls.  For $45-$75, depending on your choice of boat and time of day, you get a two-hour cruise, all the drinks you can throw back, a little game-viewing, and a braai (BBQ) afterwards.  The trip can be really crazy or really mellow, depending on who's scheduled on your trip.

*Then there is '''Jet Extreme''', wherein you fly across the class five rapids of the Zambezi River for $95, the tickets can be booked at any of the back packers. The trip also involves an hour and half drive through the bush and a vertical climb down in a cable car about 220 meters. The thrill of coming to a spinning halt from 50 mph to 0 in a second is too good to miss.

*Finally, there are several '''National Parks''' nearby, many of which are well-worth the visit.  Livingstone, has the well known Mosi-Oa-Tunya National Park which has the only White Rhinos in Zambia.  The numbers have since been increasing with the blessings of two newly born babies within Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park bringing the total number to '''Seven Rhinos''' thus 2 male adults, 3 female adults and 2 babies respectively 2010/2011.  These Rhinos are very healthy and currently under heavy guard 24/7.

* Take a tour with the '''Royal Livingstone Express''' [http://www.royal-livingstone-express.com] offering excursions by a colonial era steam train.

==Buy==

It is important not to rely on your bank card to withdraw money from ATMs, especially if you do not have a VISA card. There are ATMs in the town centre and in the shopping centre on the way to the falls. 

(Sept 2016) Most ATMs support VISA only. However, Stanbic & Barclays support Mastercard as well. Barclays charges 25 ZMK commission for international cards, Stanbic does not.

The ATMs only give money in local currency. Most prices (esp for activities) are quoted in USDs, however by Zambian law all vendors must accept payment in ZMK so generally vendors will have an exchange rate to do this. If you are coming from the Zimbabwe side of the falls it may pay to get cash before crossing the border.

Livingstone provides an inexhaustible supply of curio vendors, women selling fabrics, boys selling cool drinks, girls selling jewelry, and so on.  Their main curio markets are near town, and near the entrance to the falls.  The range of merchandise is about the same at both, as are the prices.  The range of goods apart from souvenirs, curios and other locally made products for the tourist market is poor to non-existent.

Although there are some vendors who will follow you to try and sell their wares, they sellers are nowhere near as common or as aggressive as in neighbouring Zimbabwe.  They mostly are near the falls, the markets, and the museum, and you can generally walk the streets through town without being accosted by touts.  

You could easily spend all your money here.  Be aware, though, that since this is a popular stop for tourists unfamiliar with bargaining, prices might be somewhat higher here than in other places.  A savvy bargainer, however, can still strike gold although indistinguishable souvenirs are much cheaper outside Livingstone (on the roads to Lusaka for example)

==Eat==
Considering Livingstone is such a tourist destination, you can be certain that Western-style meals are easy to find -- everything from pizza, to burgers, even burritos! Several of the lodges and accommodations have restaurants and pubs on their grounds. 

*'''O'Discols Restaurant''', near Fawlty Towers Backpackers, is a popular joint that attracts a young crowd. It features ''al fresco'' dining that receives mixed reviews.
*'''The Funky Munky''' Is just down the street from Jollyboys Backpackers, this is an excellent take away with some very nice pizzas.

==Drink==
Every hostel, hotel, and resort in Livingstone features its own bar.  If you want to get a cold one, you won't have to look far.  There are also a number of nightclubs downtown, where tourists and locals alike dance to local and Western music. Manu local music is from Congo, those artists perform in Congo (DRC) local languages, so many times even local Zambians don't know meaning of the words, but rhythm, twisting and shaking is the issue here. 

* '''Stepright''' which is reputedly a hub of organized crime (though tourists should not have trouble), as well as a open-air club across the road and the bar and grill has a disco later on again next door in the center of town all very good. There is also a casino a short taxi-ride away where the drinks were slightly more expensive.

* '''Hippos''' - the bar attached to Fawlty towers is the most common spot where tourists hang out, but many locals socialize there also.

* '''Chez nTemba''' - typical Zambian nightclub. Open daily. One of the few places there is a door charge and the drink is slightly more expensive.

==Stay safe==
Generally, Livingstone is a fairly safe town.  They want to continue to attract foreign currency, so they are careful to make travellers feel safe.  However, be careful about walking downtown at night, especially if you've been drinking.  There are very few street lights, and many of the locals are very poor. Try not to annoy the taxi-drivers, particularly late at night when some have been drinking. It is not generally recommended for tourists to walk the 5 miles from Livingstone to Victoria Falls due to a number of recent reports of crime. The times of year in which bull elephants in musk are another reason for not walking; they become very irritable and aggressive, and are not shy about humans.

Increasing numbers of Zimbabweans are leaving their country. Zambia, especially Livingstone on the border, receives its share of Zimbabwean refugees, many of whom are poor and desperate. There have been some attacks reported recently.

Rafting can be dangerous anywhere in the world, and Livingstone is no exception. Make sure you raft with an experienced and genuine guide. Ask around your hotel or resort about a potential guide's reputation: SOME ARE NOT GENUINE GUIDES. They will either take your money and leave, or worse, lead you on a bogus rafting experience that may endanger your life. Although this is a demanding river, there is no reason why anyone cant partake in a rafting trip, provided they go with experienced guides and a reputable company. Make sure your safety equipment and gear is in good repair and that you secure it properly.

You need to be very careful while exchanging currency to Kwachas - a number of touts will approach with better exchange rates and fool an unsuspecting tourist by clever tricks of hand - it is best to use the government bureau for exchanging your currency. Even the post office at Livingstone can be change currency.

==Get out==
You can catch a bus in Livingstone to Lusaka airport or, alternatively,
you can catch a bus in Livingstone that will take you through the desolate [[Southern Province]] to the Zambia-Namibia border.  (If the bus breaks down, be prepared to wait; bring water and a snack.  However, for the independent traveller, this is the fastest, cheapest, most memorable way to [[Namibia]].)  The bus will drop you in [[Sesheke]], a small, dusty village on the Zambian side of the Zambezi River.  

After crossing the Zambezi River by ferry or dugout canoe (!), you'll be in [[Katimi Mulilo]], on the eastern tip of the [[Caprivi Strip]].
The ferry is taken out of service due to the new bridge which opened early 2004.

There are also direct busses to Windhoek in Namibia. The only company is currently Oasis which charges 520 ZMK for the 19 hours trip. Busses leave from the bus terminal in the city centre on Wednesday, Friday and Sunday at 11:30 AM. The bus is pretty crowded and there is a bus change at the border after which the bus was only half full (07/2018).

Crossing to Botswana via Kazungula (Sep 2016): Take a shared taxi to Kazungula border post for 35 ZMK per person (120 ZMK if you want the taxi for yourself). Stamp out of Zambia. Take the small ferry (with capacity for 2 trucks) to Botswana side (2 ZMK or 4 BWP). Walk 500m to Botswana border post to stamp-in. A shared taxi to Kasane is 4 BWP or 20 BWP if not sharing. Change currency in Livingstone town (marginally better rate) or at second container from the gate at Kazungula - it is a fixed booth so more confidence that the notes will be genuine.
