'''Isfahan''' (or Es·fa·han (ĕs'fə-hän', Persian: اصفهان) is a city in central Iran, south of [[Tehran]] and is the capital of [[Esfahan (province)|Esfahan Province]]. The Persians call it "Nesf-e-Jahan", meaning "Half The World". Due to its beautiful hand-painted tiling and magnificent public square, it is considered to be one of the most beautiful cities in the world. An ancient town and capital of Persia from 1598 to 1722, it was long noted for its fine carpets and silver filigree. Today, textile and steel mills take their place. Its architecture, tree-lined boulevards and relaxed pace make it one of the highlights of [[Iran]].

[[Image:Chehel_Sotoon.jpg.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Chehel Sotoon Palace]]
The city is 430 km south of [[Tehran]] at the foothills of the Zagros mountain range. The city enjoys a temperate climate and regular seasons. Isfahan is located on the main north-south and east-west routes crossing Iran. It is similar to [[Denver]] in the [[United States]] in terms of altitude and precipitation. It is the twin city of [[Freiburg]] and '''Freiburg''' street in Isfahan is famous.

===Climate===
Isfahan experiences an arid climate, much like the rest of the Iranian plateau with little rainfall. It features cold winters with temperatures between -2°C (27°F) and 8°C (47°F) in January. Cold waves can occasionally lower temperatures to -10°C (14°F) and the record low is -19.4°C (-2.9°F). Snow does fall at least once every winter. In contrast, summers can get hot with highs topping 36°C (97°F) in July but with pleasant nights just above 21°C (70°F). Heat waves do occur and the record high is 43°C (109°F).

==Get in==

===By plane===
*'''Isfahan International Airport''' or '''Isfahan Shahid Beheshti'''  ({{IATA|IFN}}) ({{ICAO|OIFM}}) was a military air base before the revolution. There are daily flights to [[Tehran]] and [[Mashhad]] in Iran. There are also flights to [[Damascus]], [[Dubai]], [[Sharjah]], [[Kuwait]], [[Doha]] and  [[Istanbul]]. From the Airport, you can take a cab for around 350,000 IRR (April 2016) to the city center. Note that since most people are going there anyway, you can always ask people to share a taxi. Be sure to agree on the price beforehand or insist that the driver uses the taxi meter - be careful, as some drivers will turn on the meter and turn it off mid-ride. Drivers will generally not give change to foreign travelers, so carry small bills.

In April 2019 Isfahan airport, while not really equipped to be entitled an international airport, will also provide visum on arrival for those first arriving in Iran on this airport. Even when your e-visum got rejected, they do not care. When you get into the terminal, don't stand in line for the passport checks but linger around near the VISA office opposite of the entrance. Someone in a suit will ask you about your trip and your occupation. They also ask for a reference number. In case your e-visum was rejected, just say no. They will tell you first to go to the VISA office, fill out a form (the same one as the online one), then you pay at the bank. Wait around for a bit and in about half an hour they will return with your passport. Then they ask you to pay for insurance and you can get on to passport control. They put a sticker in your passport and then you're in. Don't freak out if your bags aren't on the luggage belt (you can see it through a glass wall), they gather it for you when you're in the application process and give it to you when you're finished.

===By train===
There is a night-train to [[Tehran]] and a daily train to [[Mashhad]]. There are no trains to [[Shiraz]]. 

The night train from Tehran to Isfahan costs IRR350,000 for sleeping in a small 6-bed compartment.

===By car===
Isfahan is well-served by highways. There are automobile routes to capital [[Tehran]],[[Qom]], [[Na'in]], [[Kashan]], [[Varzaneh]], [[Shiraz]], [[Yazd]] and [[Ahvaz]].

===By bus===
Isfahan is well connected to most parts of Iran by bus. There are multiple bus terminals in Isfahan and you should note which one is more suitable for you. Kaveh, Sofeh, Zayanderud, and Jey are namely the major bus terminals of Isfahan city.

There are buses to/from Tehran every 15 minutes in Kaveh terminal. Also, there are a few luxury buses with a so-called "European standard" (very comfortable seats, open mini-bar, etc.). The ticket to Tehran costs IRR330,000 with luxury ones.

Jey Terminal bus is dedicated to major destinations at the east of Isfahan, including [[Varzaneh]] (famous for its [[desert]] and traditional lifestyle), [[Na'in]] and [[Yazd]].
