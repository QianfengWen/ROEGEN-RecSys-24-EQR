'''Debrecen''' is the "Capital city of the [[Great Hungarian Plain]]", and the county seat and largest city of Hajdú-Bihar county in eastern [[Hungary]]. It is the second largest city in the country with about 200,000 inhabitants and historically the most important city in Hungarian Protestantism.

==Understand==
[[image:nagytemplom.jpg|thumb|400px|The Great Church of Debrecen in winter]]
They used to ask "who in their sane mind would build a city in the middle of nowhere where there are no mountains, or roads?". Well, the answer is easy: thanks to the Great Plain situated in this area earlier there had been agricultural villages settled here. Step by step these villages were built together, a common administrative and cultural centre was created, and nowadays Debrecen is the second largest city of Hungary. 

It used to be Europe's largest Calvinist city (was called "The Calvinist Rome"), and the Grand Church (''Nagytemplom'') is a reminder of the city's heritage.

Debrecen also has a university with all kinds of science areas. It has about 25000 students. The main building at the ''Nagyerdő'' is beautiful.

==Get in==
[[image:DebrecenTrain.JPG|thumb|200px|Main Train Station in Debrecen]]

=== By car ===
It can be easily accessed from [[Budapest]] by driving on the '''M3''' highway and then the '''M35''' (about at 186 km sign) highway but vignette is required. It is about a 2-hour drive. Or follow the '''main road 4''' from [[Budapest]] or anywhere except east (more than 3 hours travel from Budapest), but it is not recommended because '''main road 4''' is overcrowded and accidents are common.

===By plane===
The Debrecen Airport [http://www.debrecenairport.com/en/] is the second biggest of the country and after many years of operation [http://www.debrecenairport.com/history/] currently serves planes to several cities of Europe directly. 
Wizz Air flies from [[Tel Aviv]], [[Dortmund]], [[Eindhoven]], [[Brussels]], [[Paris]], [[Milan]], [[London]] [[Luton]], [[Doncaster/Sheffield]], [[Barcelona]], [[Palma de Mallorca]], [[Malta]], [[Larnaca]] and [[Moscow]]. 
Lufthansa flies to [[Munich]] since April 2016 on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Through this destination most of the world's big cities are accessible with a single layover. 
Charter flights are available to [[Erfurt]], [[Crete]], [[Burgas]], [[Corfu]] and [[Antalya]].
Taxi between Debrecen Airport and Debrecen city has a fix price of HUF 3000 (approx. EUR 10).

===By train===

* From [[Budapest]]: There are trains from Budapest to Debrecen every hour during the day. InterCity trains, the fastest option, take 2.5 hours to reach Debrecen, and also stop at Budapest Airport (Ferihegy station). When buying a ticket, specify the exact train because there is a supplement with compulsory seat assignment on the IC trains. As of 2016, the price is HUF 4605 (2nd class) or HUF 5595 (1st class). The best option is to leave Budapest from the Budapest Nyugati railway station because even tough there are trains from the Keleti as well but the travel time is over an hour longer. 

* From [[Vienna]]: Starting from 2015, the Hortobágy EuroCity train directly connects Debrecen to Vienna. Travel time is about 5h 15min. The price starts from 19 € one way (buying in Hungary the ticket has a significant discount, buying in Austria will be more expensive).

==Get around==
[[image:DebrecenTram.JPG|thumb|200px|Tram outside of Debrecen Train Station]]

===Public transportation===

Although the quickest way to get around is often on foot, there is an extensive network of trams, trolleybuses and buses all around the city and its suburbs. Head ways of trams and trolleybuses are 5-15 minutes, while frequency on bus lines vary.
There are two tram lines which serve the north-south axis of the town, while the east-west axis and the peripheries are served by the trolleybus and bus lines. Trams also provide good means of hop-on hop-off travel within the very center of the town. Tram line 1 starts from the railway station, goes along the main street, turns at the Grand Church a bit, goes to the Old Forest, then in a big loop it goes around the Forest to stop at the Zoo, the Theme Park and Public Bath, the Medical and Main campuses of the Universities, then back.

One needs a ticket or pass to use the public transport. Tickets are for a single ride excluding transfers. Prices as of 2019 include: HUF 330 (approx. EUR 1) for a single trip ticket purchased in advance, HUF 400 for a single trip ticket purchased to the bus driver, and HUF 1200 (approx. 4 EUR) for a day pass.

Some connections that are worth mentioning (as of 2019).
* Trams from the Grand Railway Station to the center (lines 1 and 2) and further to Nagyerdő (line 1 only). 
* Trolleybus from the coach station to the center and the Grand Railway Station (3,3A,4 and 5 respectively).
* Buses 25,41,45 from the coach station via the center to the Zsuzsi railway.
* Buses Airport1 and Airport2 between the Grand Railway Station and Debrecen Airport. The schedule is synchronized with arrivals and departures, but they do not wait for delayed flights.

The timetables and a journey planner can be found on the page of the public company DKV [http://www.dkv.hu/].

===Walking===

The most effective way to get around in the inner city is to walk. Most of the sights are in a couple of hundred meters from each other.  
While the center reflects the former status of Debrecen as an important cultural centre and capital with multi-story Classicist and Art-Nouveau buildings, the picture radically changes just a couple of streets away, where closed rows of one-level, large-gate houses dominate the view, that are typical to the smaller towns of the Great Plains of Hungary. Further away from the centre there are many higher concrete-block buildings.

There are many nice streets around, however there are many less attractive ones as well, but walking around is generally safe.
Try ''Nagyerdő'' (the Great Forest): it is beautiful.

===Driving===
The city center is just the right size to walk around but there are places where it is comfortable to drive. The road conditions are good but during peak hours some of the major intersections will get crowded, expect some delays around 8-9 am and 4-5 pm. The center is not accessible by car and it takes time to navigate around it.
Sixt, Hertz and Avis are available in the city if you want to rent a car. It is also possible to order your rental to the airport.

==See==

Although Debrecen is the second largest city in the country, it is a way smaller place with about one tenth the inhabitants, so do not expect as buzzing life as in Budapest. Still there are quite some attractions that reflect its former status as a main hub of the Great Plains, a cultural centre and once even the capital of Hungary. The Nagytemplom is a must see and easily accessible. As for museums, the Déri Museum is definitely worth a trip, but all the others really depend on how much Hungarian art interests you. Most of the major attractions are in the city park, or Nagyerdő, where you could easily spend a pleasant afternoon.

'''Places of Worship'''
