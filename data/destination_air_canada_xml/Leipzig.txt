'''Leipzig''' [http://www.leipzig.de] is the largest city in the [[Germany|German]] federal state of [[Saxony]], with a population of approximately 560.000. It is the industrial center of the region and a major cultural center, offering interesting sights, shopping possibilities and lively nightlife.

==Understand==
[[Image:Leipzigcentre.jpg|thumb|Fountain on Augustusplatz. The building in the background is the Krochhochhaus, Leipzig's first highrise]] 
First documented in 1015, and endowed with city and market privileges in 1165, the city of Leipzig has fundamentally shaped the history of Saxony and of Germany. It was founded at the crossing of two ancient trade routes, Via Regia and Via Imperii. Leipzig has always been known as a place of commerce and still has large trade fairgrounds and exhibition halls known as the Leipzig Messe and located north of the city. Before it became common to dedicate a specific area to trade fairs, they took place in the city itself. Which is why many of the historical buildings were constructed by merchants, as well as Leipzig's unique system of arcades and courtyards.   

Other forms of exchange soon followed the trade of goods. The University of Leipzig (latin: Alma mater lipsiensis) was founded in 1409, which makes it the second-oldest university in Germany. University facilities are scattered throughout the city, and you cannot miss the central campus at Augustusplatz with the new main building.

Leipzig acquired the nickname Klein Paris ("Little Paris") in the 18th century, when it became a center of a classical literary movement largely led by the German scholar and writer Johann Christoph Gottsched.

The city is also the home of the Nikolaikirche (Church of St. Nicholas) – the starting point of peaceful demonstrations against the communist regime which led to German Reunification. The collapse of communism hit Leipzig's economy very heavily (as did communism itself), but after being on the mend for over twenty years, it has emerged as one of the success stories of the "New German States".

Traces of Leipzig's history are everywhere: the ring of streets around the city center marking the former course of the city wall, the city trade houses, abandoned and repurposed industrial buildings in Plagwitz, small town structures in the outskirts where surrounding towns were incorporated during phases of rapid growth, the battlefields of the Napoleonic wars in the south and southeast of the city, and much, much more.

Leipzig can easily be reached by car, as it is very well connected with the Autobahn highway system. The nearest Autobahn highways are A14 (North, Northeast), A9 (West) and A38 (South).

===By train===

[[File:Leipzig - Hauptbahnhof (main station).jpg|thumb|Hauptbahnhof (main station)]]
Leipzig's Hauptbahnhof is the largest terminal railway station in Europe with 26 platforms above ground plus 2 tunnel platforms, and also includes a large shopping mall, a tedious way to waste away an hour or two between connections. The train station also has the most expensive station toilets in [[Western Europe]]: €1.00 per tinkle, and worth every penny.

'''Deutsche Bahn''' [http://bahn.de] operates regular train service between Leipzig and nearby cities such as [[Halle]] (€9, 25 minutes), [[Magdeburg]] (€20, 75 minutes), [[Erfurt]] (€28, 60 minutes), [[Jena]] (€24, 60 minutes), [[Weimar]] (€25, 60 minutes), [[Dessau]] (€11, 50 minutes), [[Lutherstadt Eisleben]] (€13, 80 minutes), [[Lutherstadt Wittenberg]] (€12, 30 minutes), [[Potsdam]] (€47, 2 hours), and [[Berlin]] (€43, 80 minutes).

===By bus===
Several bus companies (for example FlixBus or MeinFernbus) connect Leipzig with other cities in Germany. Long distance busses stop in Leipzig in Goethestrasse (between Central Station and Opera House) and/or at the airport (near airport railway station).

==Get around==
[[File:Leipzig Citypanorama.jpg|thumb|700px|right| Panorama of Leipzig City, view from Fockeberg.]]
===By Bike===

The best way to get around in Leipzig is by bike. Leipzig has a wide network of rivers and channels and almost all of them have a bike track on at least one bank. Since these bike paths often run beneath the street level, they form a bike highway system in Leipzig. The bike paths on street level are also abundant, but slower, because of the many street crossings. Leipzig has a bike sharing system from nextbike [http://www.nextbike.de/en/], an international public bike sharing company that was actually founded in Leipzig. Here is a web site dedicated to biking in Leipzig [http://www.radfahren-in-leipzig.de/](in German only).

===Public Transport===

The primary means of public transport is the tram. '''LVB''' [http://www.lvb.de/] operates trams and buses in Leipzig. Most lines run every 10 minutes during the day and at least hourly at night. A single-trip ticket costs (prices as of May 2018) €2.60. A full day bus & tram ticket, valid 24 hours, costs €7.40; a day ticket for 5 people traveling together costs €23.00. A weekly pass costs €26.10. After 8pm, you must enter buses through the driver's door and show/purchase your ticket. For trips within 4 stops a short trip ticket is available for €1.90.

The tram network is structured like a star with a circle in the center. Tram lines generally lead from the outskirts into the city, which they half-circle on the ring, and continue to someplace else in the outskirts. Bus lines provide additional direct connections that often do not touch the center. 

Trains ("S-Bahn") are crossing the city center in north-south direction though the city tunnel, connecting Hauptbahnhof and Bayerischer Bahnhof via underground stations at Markt and at Wilhelm-Leuschner Platz. From both ends of the tunnel lines branch off into several directions towards Leipzig suburbs like Connewitz, Stötteritz, Thekla, fair area and Miltitzer Allee and beyond. Please note that the city tunnel provides fast connections north - south, but is not of great help in the east - west direction. 

====Tickets====

LVB is part of the regional integrated transport network '''MDV''' [http://www.mdv.de/]. Tickets to nearby towns and cities (e.g. [[Halle]]) are available at LVB ticket offices and vending machines. Tickets can be purchased by cash or credit card. They are valid for all participating means of transportation. The fares quoted above are for MDV fare zone 110, which is the area within the city limits. A single-trip ticket includes transfers to other lines. You have to complete your trip within one hour. Buy tickets from:
* Vending machines at some stops and at all train stations, payable with coins or (small) bills
* Vending machines inside the trams. Coins only
* Bus drivers
* One of the LVB service offices
* Some tobacco, stationery, or press shops

Stamp your ticket after boarding the first bus or tram on your itinerary, or on the platform when using a train. Week tickets are issued for calendar weeks, month tickets for calendar months. Day and week tickets are valid until 4 a.m. the next day after their validity has ended; month tickets until noon the day after their validity has ended.

A leaflet listing all the benefits is available online [http://www.leipzig.de/int/en/tourist/leipzig_card/].

====Night bus network====

Regular services operate until around midnight. A network of Nightliner bus lines (N1...N10) takes you around at night. All Nightliner buses start from Hauptbahnhof at 1:11, 2:22, and 3:33 a.m. They service most parts of the main tram network, but on different routes. Each line makes a loop, returning to Hauptbahnhof at the end. Check the blue network plans at stops or inside trams.

===By taxi===

Plenty of taxis are available. They wait for customers in various designated locations around the city. You can also wave a taxi on the street if its sign is lit up. To order a taxi to your current location call [http://www.taxi4884.de/ 4884]. Pubs, restaurants and hotels will be happy to do that for you if you are their customer. Expect a fare of €15–20 for a trip from the outskirts to the center or vice versa.

===By car===

Leipzig suffers from the same traffic problems as all cities of its size. Access to the city center is restricted, so don't plan to go anywhere inside the inner ring of main streets.

If you still like to use a car within the city, be prepared to pay a fee for parking around the center. Car parks are available at Hauptbahnhof, Augustusplatz, Burgplatz, and several other locations. A parking guidance system is installed on the main streets. Around the inner ring, signs point you to the different car parks and display the current number of unused parking spots. Signs are color-coded, each color representing a car park location. Since the city center is pretty compact, for most purposes it won't matter much where you leave your car. When you visit the Gewandhaus or the opera, the car park underneath Augustusplatz is the most convenient option with exits to both buildings.

Watch for the trams when making turns. They are stronger than your car and sometimes come from behind beside the street. At marked tram stops, if the driving lane is to the right of the track, you have to wait behind a stopping tram and let passengers get on and off. After everyone is off the street, you may pass slowly.

Starting in March 2011, most of the city of Leipzig will become a designated [[Germany#Traffic_rules|low-emission zone]] (''Umweltzone''). Cars operating within the limits of the city have to comply with strict emission standards. Many modern cars do, but to enter the zone your car has to show it by exhibiting a green badge (''Feinstaubplakette''). If you enter the city without this badge, or with a yellow or red badge, you risk a fine.

* <see name="Old Town Hall" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="Entrance fee: €2.50">built in 1556 in the Renaissance style and remains one of Germany's largest. The position of the tower follows the ancient ideal of "golden mean". Located on the pretty main square of the city, it is a good orientation point.  The Old City Hall was built 1556 by Hieronymus Lotter on basements of two Patrician houses. It is a beautiful Renaissance style building, 90 meters long with arcades (1906 - 09), six gables and a tower. In the 18th century the tower was enlarged and it received a Baroque spire. Until 1904 the Old City Hall was home of the city administration. Then it became home of the city museum. Most impressive is the huge Banquetting Hall with Renaissance interior (open fireplaces). Many fine works of medieval religious art: altars, paintings, wood-carved sculptures etc. Most of them were saved from churches which were deconstructed in Leipzig's surrounding. Very impressive are the rooms with interior from old Patrician houses. Also interesting: the treasure chamber (steep and narrow staircase!). This Renaissance building was erected in just nine months in 1556/57 under the direction of the architect Hieronymus Lotter. The municipal government moved into the New Town Hall in the year 1909. If you have a bit of luck you are allowed to visit the cellar of the building. Here you find the chamber of torture and the jail. Leipzig's Renaissance City hall contains a museum of city history which possesses the original of the only confirmed painting of Bach produced in his lifetime. It also contains interesting information regarding the public executions that previously took place in the market in front of the city hall. The most famous execution was that of Woyzeck later made famous by the Büchner play and the opera of Alban Berg. The interior of the Old City Hall (built in 1556) is far more interesting than the outside view. Inside there's an interesting museum covering the history of Leipzig from the very beginnings (in 12th century) till our days. One of the most touristy places of the whole city.</see>

====Lakes====

Leipzig is surrounded by several lakes [http://www.leipzigseen.de], resulting from former open-cast lignite mining and now developed into places for various outdoor activities.

==Stay safe==
The city is considered somewhat safe. Crime levels are low, however there's some people dealing drugs around the very active clubbing scene in Leipzig. But you should not be worried to walk alone in the streets at night.
