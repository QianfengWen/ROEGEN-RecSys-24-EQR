'''Ōsaka''' (大阪) is the third largest city in [[Japan]], with a population of over 2.5 million people in its greater metropolitan area.  It is the central metropolis of the [[Kansai]] region and the largest of the Osaka-[[Kobe]]-[[Kyoto]] trio.

==Districts==

"Osaka" can mean either the larger [[Osaka prefecture]] (大阪府 ''Ōsaka-fu''), covered in a separate guide, or central Osaka city (大阪市 ''Ōsaka-shi''), the topic of this guide.  The city is administratively divided into 24 wards (区 ''ku''), but in common usage the following divisions are more useful:

{{infobox|Osaka and the "808 Bridges" (八百八橋)|
Many districts in Osaka derive their names from the Tokugawa-era bridges that were built during the city's reign as transportation hub for the country. Today, Yodoyabashi (淀屋橋) and Kyobashi (京橋) still retain their crossings, while the bridges in Yotsubashi (四ツ橋), Nagahoribashi (長堀橋）and Shinsaibashi (心斎橋) are long gone.

橋 (''hashi'', often pronounced ''-bashi'', when affixed to a preceding name) is the kanji character meaning 'bridge'.}}
If [[Tokyo]] is Japan's capital, one might call Osaka its anti-capital.  Whatever you call it, though, there are many opportunities for you to discover its true character.

Veiled much with a commercial-centric city touch, you may as well start from picking up the lively intonation of Osaka dialect, heard from the people as you ride on the escalators standing on the right, instead of the left in Tokyo; then discovering the contrast of popular food to eastern Japan, as you look for places to lunch.  The deeper you get inside, and at the end of your stay, it is not completely impossible that you may have compiled your own original list of reasons covering from history, culture, sports, to business.

Osaka dates back to the [[Asuka]] and [[Nara]] periods. Under the name '''Naniwa''' (難波), it was briefly the capital of Japan 645-655, 661-667 and finally 744-745 AD. Even after the capital was moved elsewhere, Osaka continued to play an important role as a hub for land, sea and river-canal transportation. (See "808 Bridges" infobox.) During the Tokugawa era, while Edo (now Tokyo) served as the austere seat of military power and Kyoto was the home of the Imperial court and its courtiers, Osaka served as "the Nation's Kitchen" (「天下の台所」 ''tenka-no-daidokoro''), the collection and distribution point for rice, the most important measure of wealth.  Hence it was also the city where merchants made and lost fortunes and cheerfully ignored repeated warnings from the shogunate to reduce their conspicuous consumption.

During Meiji era, Osaka's fearless entrepreneurs took the lead in industrial development, making it the equivalent of [[Manchester]] in the U.K.  A thorough drubbing in World War 2 left little evidence of this glorious past — even the castle is a ferroconcrete reconstruction — but to this day, while unappealing and gruff on the surface, Osaka remains '''Japan's best place to eat, drink and party''', and in legend (if not in practice) Osakans still greet each other with ''mōkarimakka?'', "are you making money?".

==Get in== 
===By plane===
The main international gateway to Osaka is '''[[Kansai International Airport]]''' ({{IATA|KIX}}) [http://kansai-airport.or.jp/en/index.asp]. The airport has two railway connections to the city: JR West's Kansai Airport Lines [https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/en/travel/shopping/access/train.html] (which consist of the Limited Express Haruka Line that goes to Shin-Osaka and Kyoto Stations and the slower Kansai Airport Rapid Service that goes to Osaka Station.) and the private Nankai Electric Railway that offers service to Namba. Limousine Buses are also available for travel to Osaka or Shin Osaka: 

* '''Easiest''': Limousine bus direct to Hotels near Osaka Station, ~60 minutes (add 15 minutes if arriving in terminal 2), &yen;1,550 [http://www.okkbus.co.jp/en/index3.html]
* '''To Namba''': Nankai "Rap:t" to Nankai-Namba Station, 35 minutes, &yen;1,400; Nankai Airport Express to Nankai-Namba Station, 45 minutes and &yen;920
* '''To Osaka''': JR Limited Express "Haruka" to Shin-Osaka Station, 50 Minutes , &yen;1,300 if using tourist ICOCA Haruka Ticket [https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/en/ticket/icoca-haruka/]; JR Kansai Airport Rapid to Osaka Station, 70 Minutes, &yen;1,200
* '''To Kyoto''': JR Limited Express "Haruka"to Kyoto Station, 70 Minutes, &yen;1,600 if using tourist ICOCA Haruka Ticket [https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/en/ticket/icoca-haruka/]

Most domestic flights arrive at '''Osaka International Airport''', also known as '''Itami Airport''' ({{IATA|ITM}}),  [http://osaka-airport.co.jp/].  Itami is connected via the Osaka Monorail [http://osaka-monorail.co.jp/eng/index.html], but the monorail is expensive and traces an arc around the northern suburbs. To get to downtown Osaka, you will need to transfer to the Hankyu Takarazuka Line at Hotarugaike Station or to the Kita-Osaka Kyuko Railway (which offers through service to the Osaka Metro Midosuji Line) at Senri-Chuo Station. A more convenient option for most are the Airport Limousine Buses [http://okkbus.co.jp/eng/], which run frequently from Itami to various locations within Osaka and elsewhere in the region (including Kansai Airport), with fares starting around ¥500-600. Taxi from Itami airport to Osaka castle area costs ¥4000 plus ¥700 for toll road.

===By train=== 
Tokaido and Sanyo Shinkansen (新幹線） trains arrive at '''Shin-Osaka''' station, to the north of the city center. From Shin-Osaka, you can connect to the city center by using the Midosuji subway line, or connect to the local JR network for other destinations.

*From [[Tokyo]], ''Nozomi'' (のぞみ) trains cover the one way ride in about 2 1/4 hours (¥14,050); ''Hikari'' (ひかり) trains take 3 hours and all-stopping ''Kodama'' (こだま) trains take 4 hours (both ¥13750). With the Japan Rail Pass, there is no charge to take the Shinkansen if you use the ''Hikari'' or ''Kodama'' service.

*From [[Chugoku|points west of Osaka]], <i>Nozomi</i> and ''Mizuho'' (みずほ) trains run from [[Okayama]] (¥6060, 45 mins), [[Hiroshima]] (¥10,150, 80 mins) and Hakata station in [[Fukuoka]] (¥14,890, 2 1/4 hours). Japan Rail Pass holders can use the ''Hikari Rail Star'' (ひかりレールスター) or ''Sakura'' (さくら) service instead, which runs at a comparable speed to the ''Nozomi'' and ''Mizuho'' and makes a few more stops, but these train services are shorter (8 car trains, compared to 16 cars on the ''Nozomi'' service), with ''Mizuho'' and ''Sakura'' trains also connecting to [[Kumamoto]] and [[Kagoshima]] in [[Kyushu]]. Slower ''Kodama'' trains connect the rest of the stations on the route. 

If travelling from the east without a rail pass, you can take advantage of the '''Puratto Kodama Ticket''' [http://jrtours.co.jp/kodama/ (in Japanese)]. This ticket offers a discount for the all-stopping ''Kodama'' services if you purchase at least one day in advance. You get a reserved seat and a free drink on board. With this ticket a trip from Tokyo to Shin-Osaka costs ¥10,000 - a savings of almost ¥4000. Note that there is only one ''Kodama'' service per hour from Tokyo, and a few early-morning ''Kodama'' trains cannot be used with this ticket.

During travel periods when the '''Seishun 18 Ticket''' is valid, you can go from Tokyo to Osaka during the day in about nine hours using all-local trains. Travelling in a group, however, discounts the cost significantly from the standard ¥8500 fare: A party of three costs '''¥3800 per person''', and a group of five traveling together brings the cost down to '''¥2300 per person'''. See the [[Seishun 18 Ticket]] article for more information.

There are many regional railway lines connecting Osaka to nearby cities:

*From [[Kyoto]], JR offers fast, but slightly more expensive, ''Special Rapid Service'' (新快速; ''shin-kaisoku'') trains to Osaka Station. The cheaper but slower alternative is the Hankyu Railway's limited express service. Both lines terminate in the Umeda area of Osaka. Keihan Railway offers Kyoto-Osaka trains. The Yodoyabashi terminal in Osaka does not connect directly with JR, but it is possible to transfer to the JR Osaka Loop Line at Kyobashi. In Kyoto, Keihan and Hankyu trains do not connect with JR Kyoto Station but both travel to stations which are more convenient for reaching the centre of the city. 30-45 minutes.

* From [[Kobe]], JR again offers slightly faster and slightly more expensive service than Hankyu. The third choice is Hanshin Railway, which is identical to Hankyu in terms of cost and similar in time, useful for getting to Koshien Stadium to see Hanshin Tigers games. All three lines go to Osaka / Umeda. about 20 minutes.

* From [[Nara]], JR offers trains to Tennōji and Osaka Stations, and Kintetsu offers trains to Namba. Kintetsu station in Nara is closer to Tōdaiji and Nara Park. 35-45 minutes.

* From [[Nagoya]], an alternative to the Shinkansen is Kintetsu's premium limited express service, the ''Urban Liner'' (アーバンライナー) which goes directly to Namba. Trip times are as little as two hours each way, with departures at 0 and 30 minutes past the hour at a cost of ¥4150. In comparison, the shinkansen takes just under an hour for ¥5670.

Stations with the same name but belonging to different railway companies are sometimes very far apart. For example, the ''Nakatsu'' stations on the Hankyu and subway networks are about ten minutes' walk from each other, even though they look close on the railway map. Allow up to half an hour for walking between the various ''Umeda'' stations and about the same for the various ''Namba'' stations, especially if you are a first time visitor.

In Kobe the ''Sannomiya'' stations belonging to JR and Hankyu are connected but Hanshin Sannomiya is across a street.

====Overnight by train====
Direct daily overnight train service between Tokyo and Osaka consists of a single Tokyo-bound departure only &mdash; the Sunrise Izumo/Sunrise Seto, leaving Osaka station at 12:34AM and arriving in Tokyo just after 7AM. 

One overnight train, the ''Twilight Express'' (トワイライトエクスプレス), runs between Osaka/Shin-Osaka Station and [[Sapporo]] in [[Hokkaido]] several times a week. Japan Rail Pass holders must pay additional fees to use this train, but note that due to its popularity it tends to get sold out.

During University holidays there are some additional overnight services to [[Matsuyama]], [[Kochi (Shikoku)|Kochi]] and [[Fukuoka]]. As these are considered ''rapid'' services they can be very economical if you use a [[Seishun 18 Ticket]].

====Overnight by train with rest stop====

As a Rail Pass holder, you may also choose to simply split up your journey, stopping at an intermediate destination en-route in order to sleep somewhere, and the cost incurred will only be for the hotel room. This is also a good way to travel overnight, especially if you are able to find cheap accommodation, such as a business hotel. Yes, it may be a little hectic, and it might require some research, but this method carries two significant advantages: '''location''' and '''money'''. You will more than likely find good accommodation very close to a main train station in a smaller city, compared to a big city such as Tokyo, and it will more than likely be cheaper than hotels found in Tokyo. You could use the money you save to forward some of your luggage to Osaka using a '''luggage delivery service''' and take an overnight bag with you, which will make the journey easier.

For example, you can use the Tokaido Shinkansen late at night and sleep over at a hotel in [[Shizuoka]], [[Hamamatsu]], [[Toyohashi]] or [[Nagoya]]; In the morning, grab one of the first bullet train departures in the same direction to continue your trip. Here is an example: In the evening hours, take a ''Hikari'' or ''Kodama'' train to Hamamatsu (75-90 minutes via ''Hikari'' or 2 hours via ''Kodama''). Once there you can take a rest at Hamamatsu's [http://www.toyoko-inn.com/e_hotel/00169/index.html '''Toyoko Inn'''], which costs as low as '''¥4000''' for a single room if booked in advance. At 6:30 the next morning, board the first bullet train of the day, a Kodama, and you will be at Shin-Osaka station by 8:15.

===By car===
It is generally a bad idea to use an automobile to visit Osaka. Many streets do not have names, signs are usually only in Japanese, and parking fees are astronomical. In addition, an international driver's license is required.

===By bus===
As Osaka is a major city, there are many day and overnight buses which run between Osaka and other locations throughout Japan, which can be a cheaper alternative than shinkansen fares.

The run between Tokyo and the Kansai region is the busiest in Japan, and fierce competition between bus operators has resulted in better amenities and lower prices. Buses from Tokyo follow either the Tomei Expressway or the Chuo Expressway to Nagoya, then the Meishin Expressway to Osaka. Trips take approximately 8-9 hours depending on the route and stops.

The following are among the major bus services available between Tokyo and Osaka: ''(Current as of March, 2012)''

=====Willer Express=====

Discount bus operator '''Willer Express''' [http://travel.willer.co.jp/en/] runs daytime and overnight buses with a variety of seating options ranging from standard bus seats to luxurious shell seats. Bus journeys can be booked online in English, and Willer's '''Japan Bus Pass''' is valid on all of their routes with some exceptions.

Buses from Tokyo leave from Willer's own bus terminal, located west of Shinjuku Station in the Sumitomo Building. Some buses also leave from '''Tokyo Disneyland''' - Goofy Car Park, '''Tokyo Station''' - Yaesu-Chuo Exit, '''Shinagawa Station''' - Shinagawa Prince Hotel and '''Yokohama Station'''.

In Osaka, Willer has their own bus terminal at the Umeda Sky Building. Buses also stop at Osaka Doyama-cho, Osaka Station's Sakurabashi Exit, Kintetsu Namba Station and Tennoji Park. 

Willer's overnight one-way fares to/from Tokyo start from approximately ¥3800 for overnight trips in standard seats up to ¥9800 in shell seats with advanced purchase. Daytime bus fares start from ¥4900. Fares are typically higher on weekends and holidays.

=====JR Bus=====

'''JR Bus''' [http://www.kakuyasubus.jp/kanto_kansai/index.html (Japanese Website)] is also a major operator on the Tokyo-Osaka route. The drawback is that you cannot make online reservations in English, but you can make reservations in train stations at the same "Midori-no-Madoguchi" ticket windows used to reserve seats on trains. 

JR Buses depart from '''Tokyo Station''' - Yaesu Exit (八重洲口) and the '''JR Highway Bus Terminal''' (JR高速バスターミナル) located adjacent to Yoyogi Station on the Yamanote Line (one stop south of Shinjuku). In Osaka, buses congregate primarily at the JR Highway Bus Terminal there, the Minato-Cho Bus Terminal, and at Tennoji Station.

JR Bus offers, in order of comfort and price, '''Seishun (youth) buses''' with 2x2 seating configurations, '''Standard buses''' with individual seats arranged 1x1x1, and '''Premium Buses''' that offer wider seats and more amenities.

JR Bus' overnight one-way fares to/from Tokyo start from approximately ¥3500 for overnight trips in Seishun buses up to ¥7600 for premium buses with advanced purchase. Daytime bus fares start from ¥4200. Fares are typically higher on weekends and holidays.

Note that the Japan Rail Pass CAN be used for overnight trips on standard buses between Tokyo and Osaka called "Dream" services. If traveling during the daytime, direct buses between Tokyo and Osaka are NOT covered by the rail pass (you can use the much faster bullet train instead).

=====Other bus services=====

*'''Hankyu Bus:''' Several overnight buses from Tokyo Station, Shinagawa Bus Terminal, Shinjuku, Shibuya, Ikebukuro and Yokohama. Fares start from ¥8610. Buses stop at Shin-Osaka Station (bullet train stop) and Hankyu Umeda Station.

*'''Keihan Bus:''' overnight buses from Shinjuku Highway Bus Terminal, Shibuya Mark City, Tokyo Disneyland and Keisei Ueno station. Buses stop at Keihan's Hirakatashi station, from which central Osaka can be reached by Keihan Train in 25 minutes. Regular bus fare ¥8360; train fare ¥320 from Hirakatashi to Yodoyabashi station.

*'''Kintetsu Bus:''' overnight from Asakusa Station, Ueno Station, Tokyo Station, Shinjuku Station and Yokohama Station. Regular buses from ¥6480; "Flying Sneaker" discount bus from ¥3900 with advance purchase. Buses stop at the Higashi Umeda subway station, Kintetsu Namba Station and Abenobashi station.

=====Nighttime Bus from Yamaguchi Prefecture=====
Bocho bus offers a nighttime bus from the cities of Hagi, Yamaguchi, Hofu, Tokuyama, and Iwakuni to Kobe and Osaka.
It currently costs between ¥6300 and ¥9480 for a one way ticket, depending on where you get on and where you get off. The bus departs Hagi Bus Center at 7:55PM nightly, and arrives at Osaka station at 7:15AM daily. The bus makes a return trip from Osaka station at 10:05PM nightly, and arrives at Hagi bus center at 9:25AM daily. Full details including round trip fares are on the [http://bochobus.co.jp/02/03.htm (Japanese Website)]. It is a good deal if you have time to spare.

===By boat===

'''Osaka International Ferry Terminal''' [http://city.osaka.jp/port/04_facilities/e_04_06.html] is located at ''Nankō'' (南港) in the Osaka Bay Area. There are no banks, post office, shops, or restaurants in the terminal. The nearest subway station is Cosmosquare Station (C11), which is about a 15 minute walk from the terminal. A free shuttle bus is available at the station. Taxis are also available at the station.

The PanStar Line [http://panstarline.com] operates a ferry between Osaka and [[Busan]]. The ferry leaves Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday, at 3:10PM from both Osaka and Busan and arrives the following day at 10AM. In Busan, the luggage check-in time is prior to the passenger check-in time: for the Busan-Osaka run, luggage check in is 12:40PM-2PM and the passenger check in time is 2:15PM-2:45PM; for the Osaka-Busan run, luggage check in is 1PM-2PM and the passenger check in time is 1PM-2:30PM. Many different room options are available, including family rooms.  Fares start at ¥17,000 and range through seven different room/suite classes culminating in a Presidential Suite, which is ¥250,000 per night. Tickets can be purchased online, but much of the website content is only available in Japanese and Korean, and may be difficult to navigate for English speakers.  Tickets are easily obtainable through agents specializing in Korean or Japanese travel.

The ferry holds live musical performances, magic shows, and other entertainment on the run. Schedule varies.

You can take your car on the ferry, but there are documentation requirements, and you should check the website [http://panstarline.com] for information. The cost for a single basic room and a car is ₩690,000. Room upgrades are available. Temporary insurance must be purchased at the port upon arrival in Osaka.

===By subway===
[[Image:Osaka Subway Map.png|thumb|300px|Osaka Subway Map]]

The '''Osaka Subway''' [http://www.kotsu.city.osaka.jp/foreign/english/index.html here] is Japan's second-most extensive subway network after [[Tokyo]], which makes the underground the natural way to get around.  The '''Midosuji Line''' is Osaka's main artery, linking up the massive train stations and shopping complexes of ''Shin-Osaka'', ''Umeda'', ''Shinsaibashi'', ''Namba'' and ''Tennoji''.

The signage, ticketing and operation of the Osaka subway is identical to its larger counterpart in Tokyo.  Fares ¥200-360, depending on distance.  Station arrivals are displayed and announced in both Japanese and English.  Keep your ticket when you enter the train &mdash; it is required when you exit.

===By train===
True to its name, the '''JR Osaka Loop Line''' (環状線 ''Kanjō-sen'') runs in a loop around Osaka.  It's not quite as convenient or heavily-used as Tokyo's Yamanote Line, but it stops in Umeda and Tennoji, and by Osaka Castle. Namba and Universal Studios Japan are connected to the Loop Line by short spurs. Fares ¥120-250, depending on distance.

===By bicycle===
Many residents get around by bicycle, as the city is mostly flat and easily navigable by bike.  Riding on the sidewalks is permitted and some sidewalks even have bike lanes marked.  If nothing is marked, try to stay to the left where possible (but often you simply need to find the best path through the pedestrians).  

Rental bikes are available, but if you are staying longer than a few weeks, purchasing a used bike can be a good deal.  Finding a used bike can be a bit tricky, however, particularly if you don't speak Japanese.  Craigslist and websites such as Gaijinpot.com have classified listings, and there are a few used bike shops around.  Renge [http://www.cycle-renge.com/], near Osaka Castle, sells a range of used bikes starting at around ¥5500.

Technically, you are required to register your bicycle with the police.  Bikes registered under a name other than the rider may be considered stolen, and bicycle theft is not uncommon.  Bike shops can help with the simple registration process.

===By car===
You can rent a car in Osaka from [https://www.carngo.com/car-rental/japan-osaka-shi €52] in Osaka Kansai Airport (KIX) from [https://www.carngo.com/car-rental/japan-osaka-kansai-airport-kix €52] in Osaka Domestic Airport (ITM) from [https://www.carngo.com/car-rental/japan-osaka-domestic-airport-itm €47] and see the surroundings of the cities on it.

'''Naniwa Palace Site Park''' or Naniwanomiya can also be found south to Osaka Castle Park (although it's one of Japan's oldest habitats and palace sites, today it's little more than an empty grass field where the outlines of Naniwa's palace foundations from around 643 AD have been partly recreated in concrete).</see>

==Work==

The occupation of most resident Americans, Europeans and Australians is [[teaching English]] (as is the case in most of Japan). There are also many international students and staff at various universities in Osaka. In recent years, the economy in the Osaka region had been relatively stagnant compared to Tokyo's: although there are jobs in law, finance, accounting, engineering and other professional fields in Osaka, demand for foreign professionals tends to be higher in Tokyo (as is pay). Osaka does have several educational publishers that employ foreign workers, but these jobs require fluent Japanese language ability. Temporary work in a variety of industries is available.

==Buy==

* Osaka's most famous shopping district is '''Shinsaibashi''' (心斎橋), which offers a mix of huge department stores, high-end Western designer stores, and independent boutiques ranging from very cheap to very expensive. Within Shinsaibashi, the '''Amerika-mura''' (アメリカ村, often shortened to "Amemura") or "American Village" area is particularly popular among young people and is often said to be the source of most youth fashion trends in Japan. Near Amerika-mura, '''Horie''' (堀江) is shopping street of mainly Japanese brand shops. The many shops in Umeda are popular among trendy locals, particularly in the '''Hep Five''' and '''Hep Navio''' buildings adjacent to Hankyu Umeda Station, although these shops tend to be too expensive to captivate most tourists' interest. In this area, new shopping buildings have been constructed recently. For example, the“E-ma” buildings next to Hanshin department store, and “Nu-Chayamachi” (Nu 茶屋町), opened in October 2005 near Hankyu Umeda station.
* For electronics, the '''Nipponbashi''' (日本橋) area southeast of Namba, and particularly the [http://denden-town.or.jp/ "Den-Den Town" shopping street], was once regarded as the [[Tokyo/Akihabara | Akihabara]] of western Japan; nowadays, more people would rather shop at the new, enormous '''Yodobashi Camera''' (ヨドバシカメラ) in Umeda or '''BicCamera''' (ビックカメラ) and '''LABI1''' in Namba, although Nippombashi still offers good deals on many gadgets, PC components and used/new industrial electronics.
* For Japanese and foreign books, try '''Kinokuniya''' in Hankyu Umeda Station or '''Junkudo''' south of Osaka Station.[[Image:Osaka night.JPG|300px|right|Tenjinbashi-suji]]
* The official '''Hanshin Tigers''' (baseball team) Shop is on the 8th floor of the Hanshin Department Store at Umeda.
* '''Tenjinbashi-suji''' Shopping Street (天神橋筋商店街 ''Tenjinbashi-suji Shōtengai'') is said to be the longest straight and covered shopping arcade in Japan at approx. 2.6km. The arcade runs north-south along Tenjinbashi-suji street and is accessible from multiple subway and/or JR stations, e.g., Tenma, Minami-Morimachi, Tenjinbashi-suji 6-chome, etc. Not meant for sightseeing, the arcade is a live exhibition of Osaka's daily life, open since Edo period.
*'''Don Quijote''' (ドン・キホーテ, or Donki, how many Japanese call it) is a discount and novelty store chain with over 400 stores in Japan, Hawaii and Singapore. Wherever in Osaka you go, you will find one of their stores. Don Quijote generally sells anything. From brand items over medicine, suitcases, apparel, electric appliances, adult toys to snacks and drinks. If you want to buy souvenirs, their stores are the best place to find whatever you need. 
The three Don Quijote branches in Osaka Namba （灘波）are among the busiest Tax-Free Stores in all over Japan. The Dotonbori Store in the notorious entertainment district has a ferris wheel on its roof, that gives you a great view all over Namba.

{{infobox|Okonomiyaki - The DIY Food|
Okonomiyaki Osaka style is usually do-it-yourself food at smaller, independent specialized restaurants.  Tables are equipped with embedded hot plates and you'll receive a bowl of ingredients, which you are expected to cook on your own.  However, in larger franchised chains the staff can often cook for you — and even in smaller places staff will usually gladly help if asked.

Should you decide to try your luck on your own, you might want to dress for the occasion: pork slices, the most common topping, are usually very fatty and tend to splatter grease all over the place. Try Modernyaki which is an Okonomiyaki with Soba on top, or go fried egg on top of the pancake.}}

The widest selection of restaurants is in Osaka's main entertainment districts, with the highest concentration of all in the [[Osaka/Kita|Umeda]] and [[Osaka/Minami#Do|Dōtonbori]] areas.

Even in a nation of obsessive gourmands Osaka is known as an excellent place to eat, exemplified by the Osakan maxim ''kuidaore'', "eat yourself into ruin".  The best place for trying out ''kuidaore'' is probably '''Dōtonbori''' (道頓堀) and neighboring '''Hōzenji-yokochō''' (法善寺横町) or '''Soemon-cho''' (宗右衛門町), the whole area containing nearly nothing but one restaurant after another. 

Some typically Osakan foods worth trying include:

* ''Battera'' (バッテラ), is a block type sushi, with mackerel put on rice and squeezed very hard in a wooden box, cut into pieces when served. ''Battera'' sushi is a variant and direct descendant of primitive sushi, this one from Osaka is unique for its squarelike shape.  Available not only in sushi restaurants but also as take-away in department stores and train stations.
* ''Okonomiyaki'' (お好み焼き), fried cabbage cakes that resemble a cross between a pancake, pizza, and omelette.
* ''Takoyaki'' (たこ焼き), bits of octopus inside fried dumplings.
* ''Kushikatsu'' (串かつ), skewers with various sorts of food (meat, vegetables, cheese, etc.) deep-fried in panko and served with tonkatsu sauce.

Okonomiyaki is best eaten in hole-in-the-wall restaurants, while takoyaki is best eaten from street vendors' carts, which can be found all over the major districts around nightfall. The best place to find kushkatsu(串カツ) is in [[Osaka/Tennoji|Shinsekai]], between Dobutsuen-mae and Ebisucho stations on the Sakaisuji subway line.

There are many nightlife districts in Osaka. Nightlife in Osaka is very popular.

*'''Kitashinchi'''(北新地)
This area, located just south of JR Osaka station, is the most famous nightclub and entertainment district of contemporary Osaka. It’s just like Tokyo’s Ginza, filled with many hundreds of high-class bars, clubs and small restaurants where Japanese businessmen entertain their clients.
*'''[[Osaka/Minami#Do|Dōtonbori]]'''(道頓堀)
This area is the centre of nightlife.
*'''Hozenji-Yokocho'''(法善寺横丁)

Osaka has a vast range of accommodation, including some of the best hotels in the world. Most of the city's moderate and expensive hotels can be found in Umeda , Namba, Shin-Osaka and Kyobashi , though they also have their share of budget options.

Backpackers have recently begun to use budget hotels around the JR '''Shin-Imamiya''' (新今宮) and subway Midosuji Line '''Dōbutsuen-mae''' (動物園前) stations, located in [[Osaka/Tennoji|Tennoji]] area.  Room quality varies widely and prices vary from ¥800-3000, but there are many options &mdash; see the '''Osaka International Guesthouse Area''' [http://www11.ocn.ne.jp/~otomari/oig/index.html] for the full list of foreigner-friendly establishments. The area is rather poor and there are many homeless that wander about during the day, but generally they are harmless and safety is not an issue. One benefit of the district being so poor is that prices at the supermarkets and such are generally very low. However, as always use common sense when traveling in unfamiliar areas.

==Contact==

* '''Opti Café''' is a surprisingly cheap internet café in Umeda. ¥100/30min. Yodobashi Camera department store's groundfloor, next to Excelsior Café. You are requested to register for membership but it doesn't cost anything.

==Stay safe== 
Osaka has a dangerous reputation (by Japanese standards), but is still '''remarkably safe''' for a city of its size, and the overall level of crime is as low as in [[Tokyo]] or other Japanese cities.   However, some areas, particularly Shinsekai and Tobita, can be a little dodgy at night and the Airin/Kamagasaki area — Japan's largest slum, home to a lot of jobless and/or homeless people — south of Shin-Imamiya is best avoided at most times, especially after dark. 

Incidentally, despite the movie stereotype of gangsters speaking in Osakan dialect, the actual base of Japan's biggest ''yakuza'' families is neighboring [[Kobe]] — and the most gang violence occurs in [[Tokyo]].  Unless you're dealing drugs, you're unlikely to get involved with the local mafia.

==Get out== 
* Its location makes Osaka a '''perfect base''' for doing one-day trips to nearby cities like [[Kyoto]] (30 minutes), [[Kobe]] (20 minutes), [[Nara]] (40 minutes) or [[Himeji]] (1 hour). (Typical times shown on JR Trains available without extra express charges starting from Osaka Station.)

* The '''Expo Park''' in [[Suita]], the huge commemorial park of the Japan World Expo '70, with its interesting Japanese Garden and Museum of National Ethnology. It's a very large park, and a good place for a picnic.

* [[Hirakata]] - Home to the child-friendly Hirakata Park and Kansai Gaidai University.

* '''Church of Light''' (茨木春日丘教会 Ibaraki Kasuga-oka Kyoukai)([[Ibaraki (Osaka)|Ibaraki]]), one of the masterpiece architecture by Tadao Ando. 

* [[Minō]], a popular maple watching spot in autumn and nature escape all year round. From Hankyu Umeda station take the train to Minō station. It is a pleasant walk to the waterfall (~30 minutes one way) through shady forest, with wild monkeys and deer . Try the local Minoh beer or maple leaves in sweet tempura batter.

* The temples and lush greenery of [[Mount Koya]], 90 minutes away by train, are an entirely different world and the perfect getaway when all the concrete starts to get to you.

* [[Akashi Kaikyo Bridge]], the world's longest single-span suspension bridge is located near Kobe, about 40 minutes away by train.

* '''Tokimeki Beach''' is a good get away if you want to spend the day at the seaside. Take the Nankai line from Namba station to Tannowa Station. The trip costs around ¥720 and takes about 45 minutes. The bag and shower service closes at 5 p.m.
