'''Anhui Provincial Tour Bus station''' (安徽省旅游巴士站 Ānhuī shěng lǚyóu bāshì zhàn) 合肥火车站东侧（临近安徽大市场）站前路 Zhàn qián lù 
* This station services Huangshan and Jiuhuashan mountains, Tunxi, Tianchang ,Yiwu, Shanghai, Tongling, Changsha, Lu'an, Hangzhou, Wuhan and other places. Buses leave every half hour. Approx. 4 hours to Huangshan.

===Public Transport===
* '''Taxis: Green, blue or orange''' These taxis are metered and start at ¥8. Around the city area, you can reasonably expect to pay between ¥10-20. A driver might occasionally try to pick up an extra passenger and carry them with you, i.e. pooling. Sometimes, they try this on foreigners who don't know how to object. It is not considered an acceptable practise. 

* '''Taxis: Black''' Black taxis are also properly signed and metered and are a little more spacious. The fare for these taxis starts at ¥9.

* '''Unmarked taxis''' Unmarked cars often pull up and offer to give you a ride. These are not metered and the price is negotiated beforehand. The fare is always higher than usual, and if you don't know Hefei well, it may be significantly higher. There is also the risk of taking a car that is not insured to carry you and has an unidentifiable driver. Saying that, there are often times when legit taxis are very scarce, and if you really need to be somewhere, it might be an option. These cars will not provide you with a receipt. 

* '''Motorbikes''' You can also jump on the back of a motorbike if taxis are scarce. There are plenty of motorbikes and they usually congregate on the corners of busy intersections. They are not legal, but are generally tolerated. They are unmetered and you negotiate a price beforehand.

* '''tuk-tuks (ma zi da)''' These are now banned in the city center. However, a little further out you might find them (particularly around the long-distance bus stations). Avoid taking them. With the amount of construction underway in Hefei, there are a lot of heavy trucks flying around the streets and mazidas are too slow and dangerous. In the townside or countryside, this mode of transport is quite common.

* '''Public Buses''' This is the dominant mode of public transport in Hefei. The central hub is at Municipal Square. A single bus fare to anywhere costs ¥1 for an non-air conditioned bus or ¥2 for air conditioned. All bus routes, schedules, and announcements are in Mandarin (no English). However, don't let this put you off. Use the "Get Directions" function on Google Maps and you can search bus routes, find bus numbers/stops in Engilsh and pinyin. The results are very accurate.

* '''Metro''' Hefei's first subway line, Line 1, opened December 2016, running a north-to-south line through downtown and has stations serving both Railway Station and South Railway Station. Line 2 began operations in 2017 and connects to Line 1 at Dadongmen. City plans call for five lines to be operational by 2020.

You can walk into the tomb of Gong and climb the tower for a view across the park and city. A ticket for all three attractions costs about ¥50. With a guide, ticket price is about ¥100 each.
