Situated in the east of the country, [http://www.wien.info/en '''Vienna'''] (German: ''Wien'') is Austria's largest city (sporting a population of more than 1.9 million inhabitants in 2022) as well as the nation's capital. It is also one of Austria's nine federal states.

As you'd expect, Vienna serves as Austria's cultural, economic, and political centre. As the former seat of the Habsburg court, the city still has the trappings of the imperial capital it once was, and the historic city centre is inscribed on the [[UNESCO World Heritage List]].

===History===
The low-lying Danube plain in and around what is now Vienna has had a human population since at least the late Paleolithic: one of the city's most famous artifacts, the 24,000-year-old '''Venus of Willendorf,''' now in Vienna's Natural History Museum, was found nearby. Vienna's own recorded history began with '''the Romans,''' who founded it in the 1st Century CE as ''Vindobona,'' one of a line of Roman defensive outposts against Germanic tribes. Vindobona's central garrison was on the site of what is now the Hoher Markt (the "High Market" due to its relative height over the Danube), and you can still see the excavations of its foundations there today.

[[Image:Schloss Schönbrunn Wien 2014 (Zuschnitt 1).jpg|thumb|Schönbrunn Castle]]

Vienna hosted the '''Habsburg court''' for several centuries, first as the Imperial seat of the Holy Roman Empire, then the capital of the Austrian Empire, and later of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which finally fell in 1918 with the abdication of the last Emperor Charles I. The court tremendously influenced the culture that exists here even today: Vienna's residents are often formal in manner, often showing courtliness, using polite forms of address, and dressing more formally than in other cities. They are considered to blend attitudes that are modern and progressive with those that are more traditional.

The empires also served to make Vienna a very '''metropolitan city''' at an early time, and especially so through the years of industrialization and fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the turn of the 20th century. Imperial Austria and Austro-Hungary were multi-lingual, multi-ethnic empires and although the German-speakers normally played the dominant role in Vienna there has long been ethnic and lingual diversity in the city. Proof of '''Jews''' in the city dates back to the History of the Jews in Vienna 10th century. After World War Two many of the city's minorities had been exiled or killed and much of the city lay in ruin. When Austria was given sovereignty after the post World War Two occupation, it was eventually established that Austria was going the way of the West and not that of the Eastern Block. So the city became more isolated from its previous ties to its Slavic and Hungarian neighbours; the east of Austria was surrounded by the Iron Curtain. Vienna had gone from being the well established metropolitan city of Central Europe to the capital of a small, predominately German-speaking nation of states with strong regional identities.

Since the formation of the first Austrian Republic and the first mayoral election 1919 the Social-Democratic Party of Austria has had the majority of representatives on the communal council and controlled the mayoral seat. During the early years, the socialist '''Red Vienna''' ("Rote Wien") revolutionized the city, improving the extreme conditions that the industrial revolution and rapid urbanization had created. Most famously the city built many housing projects (housing estates or "Gemeindebauten"), and they also began to offer many social services and made improvements across the board in quality of life. The public housing that was built at that time is now famous for its distinctive style. To this day the city continues to build public housing and about a third of the city's residents live in it, some 600,000 people! Obviously through this high percentage, the quality, and the integration of public housing across the city have kept it from becoming as stigmatized as in most cities. The Viennese are used to having the city government in their lives, and of course have a love-hate relationship with it. Vienna functions on its own as a federal state in the Austrian system (along with 8 other states) and the sense of local pride and home is more of being Viennese than being Austrian, many say.

===Culture===
'''Traditional Vienna''' is but one of the many façades of this city; the historic centre, a UNESCO world heritage site, is sometimes begrudgingly compared to an open-air museum. But Vienna is also a dynamic young city, famous for its (electronic) music scene with independent labels, cult-status underground record stores, a vibrant Monday through Sunday club scene, multitudes of street performers, street art and murals spread throughout the city and a government that seems overly obsessed with complicated paperwork. However, people are willing to go out of their way or bend the rules a little if they feel they can do someone a favour.

The Viennese have a singular fascination with '''death''', hence the popularity of the Zentralfriedhof (Central Cemetery), where there are more graves than living residents in Vienna, as a strolling location and of Schrammelmusik - highly sentimental music with lyrics pertaining to death. Old-fashioned Sterbevereine (funeral insurance societies-literally translated "death clubs") provide members with the opportunity to save up for a nice funeral throughout the course of their lives. This service does not exist solely to save their children the hassle and expense - it is considered absolutely mandatory to provide for an adequate burial. Vienna even has the "Bestattungsmuseum", a museum devoted to coffins and mortuary science. The country’s morbid obsession may be correlated with its higher suicide rate when compared with the rest of Europe. Here too, the socialist Vienna has its hand, the city also offers a socialized undertaking service [http://www.bestattungwien.at/bw/ep/home.do?tabId=0], with hearses branded in the same department of public works logo as the subway cars, and a link to the transit-planner on their website.

Vienna is also famous for its '''coffee culture.''' "Let's have a coffee" is a very commonly heard phrase, because despite incursions by Starbucks and Italian-style espresso bars, the Kaffeehauskultur is still the traditional way to drink a cup of coffee, read the newspaper, meet friends, or fall in love.

===Orientation===
[[Image:Vienna street sign.JPG|thumb|1., An old street sign with abbreviated district name "Innere Stadt", which is the 1st district.]]

There are 23 districts ("Bezirk") in Vienna. These serve mainly as decentralized administrative branches of the city government, making some local decisions. They vary immensely in terms of size and population, and each has its own flair. You can always tell which district you are in by referring to the first number on street signs, preceding the street name proper. (In this article addresses will be written in a similar manner.) Example: ''9., Badgasse 26'' means Badgasse #26 in the 9th district. 

District numbers are also part of the postal code, which is sometimes used as a shorthand for the district. These codes are usually composed as 1'''XX'''0, where XX refers to the district's number. This way, 1'''01'''0 refers to the 1st district, 1'''13'''0 to the 13th, 1'''22'''0 to the 22nd etc. In addition to district numbers or names, common '''points of reference''', most notably public transportation stops, are sometimes used. Reference to ''U1/U4 Schwedenplatz'' or ''Schwedenplatz (U1, U4)'' means that something is near to the ''Schwedenplatz'' stop of the underground lines 1 and 4. If the place is not directly at the subway stop you can usually ask around and find it easily.

The '''Vienna Tourist Board''' [http://www.wien.info] operates information and booking booths at the airport Arrival Hall, 7AM-11PM and in the center at 1., Albertinaplatz/Maysedergasse. Information and free maps are also avialable from the ÖBB InfoPoints and offices at train stations.

The city has a very centralized layout radiating from the historic '''first district,''' or '''Inner-City''' with the Stephansdom and Stephansplatz at the centre of a bullseye. It is encircled by the ''Ringstraße'' (Ring Road), a grand boulevard constructed along the old city walls, which were torn down at the end of the 19th century. Along the Ringstraße are many famous and grand buildings, including the Rathaus [City Hall], the Austrian Parliament, the Hofburg Palace, the Natural History Museum, the Museum of Art History (''Kunsthistorisches Museum''), and the State Opera House.

[[Image:Prater riesenrad.jpg|thumb|2., Leopoldstadt's Prater boasts the ''Riesenrad'']]

'''Districts 2-9''' are considered the core districts and are gathered within the ''Gürtel'' (Belt Road), which encircles the core districts as an outer ring concentric to the Ring around the first district, with the noteable exception of Leopoldstadt (District 2).

'''Leopoldstadt''' (the 2nd District) is the southern half of the island that is formed between the Danube and the Danube Canal. It stretches from the more wild forests of the '''Prater''' in the south up through the point where the Prater becomes a more formal park and amusement park where the transportation hub '''Praterstern''' is located. Going onward to the North are several neighbourhoods from the Gründerzeit[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%BCnderzeit] with dense housing including impressive Neo-Baroque buildings. Towards the north of the district along the Danube Canal across from Schwedenplatz is the '''Karmeliterviertel''' (Karmeliter Quarter) which was once a Jewish ghetto and today is the hub of Jewish life in Vienna. This area is indeed quite diverse across the board and is becoming gentrified. At the edge of that area is the '''Augarten'''. The area past that has been hand-picked for an intense development project that will turn several former freight yards into entire new neighborhoods. Along the Danube are numerous massive housing projects from the twenties onward.

'''Landstraße''' (District 3) is a rather large district to the southeast of the centre separated more or less by the Wien River (which is partially underground and otherwise channelled. Stretching from the station '''Wien Mitte''' and the surrounding business and financial district where the lively Landerstraßer Haupstraße shopping street begins, over quiet residential areas where the '''Hundertwasser Haus''' is located, all the way to the industrial hinterlands and the bus station at '''Erdberg''' in southeast, through neighbourhoods containing examples of public housing like the '''Rabenhof''' and many '''embassies''' to the '''Belvedere Palace''' and the Soviet Memorial at '''Schwarzenbergplatz'''.

[[Image:Vienna Mariahilf.jpg|thumb|6., Mariahilf's Rooflines]]

'''Wieden''' (District 4) and '''Margareten''' (District 5) run from the area around the Opera south to where a the gigantic new central station ('''Hauptbahnhof''') is located, with energetic pockets of businesses and squares to be discovered from the University of Technology to artsy galleries to a cluster of hair-cutting salons to even Vienna's miniature version of a Chinatown. These districts are bordered by the Wien River to the north.

'''Mariahilf''' (Distric 6) contrasts between the more raw areas around the Wien River where the '''Naschmarkt''' is. The district covers neighborhoods of bars and other popular bohemian and queer haunts along the '''Gumpendorfer Straße''', and it borders Neubau along Vienna's most popular shopping street the '''Mariahilferstraße''' up the the hill from the '''Gumpendorfer Straße'''.

[[Image:Donau-Wien-UNOcity.jpg|thumb|right|22., Transdanubian: U.N. Headquarters in Donaustadt]]

'''Neubau''' (District 7) starts with the aclaimed '''MuseumsQuartier''' next to the center and spreads across popular hip areas to the '''Westbahnhof''' (Western Railway Station).

'''Josefstadt''' (District 8) is the smallest district. '''Alsergrund''' (District 9) is known to be more affluent and also includes much of the University of Vienna several cozy business districts.

The outer 14 districts are largely less urban but are equally as diverse streching from '''Floridsdorf''' (21st District) which radiates from its own town center in the northeast on the eastern bank of the Danube and '''Donaustadt''' (22nd District) which includes a mix of farms, suburbia, soviet-style housing blocks, villages, the '''United Nations''' Headquarters and the '''Donauturm''' (Danube Tower) and includes the largest development project in Central Europe at '''Aspern''', through tarditional worker-oriented districts like '''Simmering''' (11th District) and '''Favoriten''' (10th District) in the south to more mixed urban areas with much immigrant culture like '''Rudolfsheim-Fünfhaus''' (15th District) and '''Ottakring''' (16th District) in the West and '''Brigittenau''' (20th District) in the northeast and '''Döbling''' (19th District) on the adjacent side of the Danube famous for its vineyards, working class history and architecture, as well as its upper class neighbourhoods. Don't miss Schönbrunn Palace to the West along the Wien River in '''Hietzing''' (13th district).

'''Spring''' starts sometime in late March, normally it is very brief and summer-like weather sets in before the trees have had time to grow back their leaves.

'''Summer''' in Vienna is usually warm. Weather in June is moderate and sunny with a light summer windy breeze. In July and August, there are some hot and humid days where it reaches 35°C (95°F), but overall, summer in Vienna is pleasant. 

'''Autumn''' starts around September, although an "Indian Summer" with warm and sunny days often occurs that month and it gets colder as it approaches November. A main disadvantage of the Viennese climate is that it is rather windy and usually overcast during these months.

'''Winter''' in Vienna can be just above 0°C (32°F) and drizzling for days on end, or just below with dustings of snow that manage to melt again quickly. There is the occasional cold-snap where it will stay below freezing for a week or two at a time. Due to Vienna's relative easterly position in the Central European Time Zone its daylight hours (if it's not too grey outside entirely) are relatively early during the winter.

===By plane===

====Vienna International Airport====
Vienna International Airport (''Flughafen Wien-Schwechat'') {{IATA|VIE}}) [http://www.viennaairport.com] is located just outside the city limits of Vienna, and a few miles southeast of the suburb of Schwechat. The airport is the home base of the flag-carrier '''Austrian Airlines''' [http://www.aua.com], as well formerly budget airline '''Niki''' [https://airportstuff.de/flughafen-wien].

Most European airlines and a significant number of intercontinental airlines have direct connections to Vienna from their respective hubs. However, only Austrian Airlines and Air Canada fly to the Americas (Chicago, Montreal, New York, Toronto and Washington), and there is no service to Africa (aside from [[Egypt]] and Tunisia) making a change necessary to reach Vienna.

=====Airport transfer=====
Just past customs, there are numerous companies offering airport transportation. Here you can look for two very small monitors displaying all the next trains and the buses departing, to the right and left respectively (at the back of the space where people receive travellers). 
By preference:
*<listing name="S-Bahn" alt="commuter rail" address="" directions="underneath terminal" phone="" url="http://www.oebb.at" hours="5:00-24:00" price="€4.10 each way" lat="" long="" email="" fax="">
''S-Bahn'' suburban trains run on the S7 line to Vienna. These provide the cheapest and most convenient connection to the city centre, and the single fare is €4.20. Take a train bound for Floridsdorf, which departs twice an hour, and get off at Wien-Mitte station on the eastern edge of the city centre (25 min). From there the U-Bahn line U3 connects to Stephansplatz right in the core of the city centre, whereas line U4 provides service to Karlsplatz (for the Opera House) as well as the Donaukanal and the Schönbrunn Palace.

The station is one level below arrivals: follow signs to separate platform near the CAT and downstairs from the CAT. You need a Vienna Zone 100 ticket (€2.20 and including all connecting transit in Vienna; day/week/etc. passes are also valid) + one extra VOR ('Verkehrsverbund Ost-Region' -East Region Transport Association-) 'Außenzone' (outside zone) (€2.20) since the airport is legally outside of the city. (Not sure, but the 'Außenzone' does not appear in the English menu of the ticket machine, so you have to buy a €2.20 zone 100 ticket instead and stamp it.)

Tickets have to be ''purchased and stamped'' before boarding. You can also buy a VOR weekly or monthly card which may or may not cover the airport, depending on chosen zones (see [http://www.vor.at], a point at ''Tickets & Preise'' and click on ''Wochen/Monatskarten and Tarifzonenplan''). Conductors aren't hesitant to fine anyone (€103) without a valid ticket, and being a tourist is not a valid excuse, although unless you're an Austrian citizen or resident you cannot actually be forced to pay the fine. ÖBB (red) ticket machines are on the way and on the platform itself.</listing>

*<listing name="IC/Railjet trains" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="" shuttle="shuttle"> Since december 2015, direct trains are running between Vienna International Airport and Vienna Hauptbahnhof (Main Station) every half an hour. The trip costs the same as the S-Bahn (2 x 2.20 for two zones) and only takes 16-18 minutes. At Main Station, there is connection to the underground line U1 and to several tram and bus lines. </listing>

*<listing name="Shuttle provided by hotel" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="" shuttle="shuttle">Select Vienna hotels offer guests shuttle service to and from the airport, usually for a fee that's cheaper than a taxi, sometimes you will share the shuttle with guests from your own or nearby hotels.</listing>

*<listing name="Vienna AirportLines Bus" alt="" address="" directions="outside arrivals" phone="" url="http://www.postbus.at/en/Airportbus/Vienna_AirportLines/index.jsp" hours="5:00-24:00" price="All routes: One way €9, Round-trip €15" lat="" long="" email="" fax="">Direct buses drive frequently between Vienna International Airport and assorted points in Vienna. Operated by Postbus. Tickets can be purchased with cash from the operator. You can also use app called WienMobil (Android).</listing>

*'''Morzinplatz/Schwedenplatz''' line goes to the city center (District 1). Buses every 30 minutes, the trip takes 20 minutes. At Schwedenplatz there is a connection to the underground lines U1 and U4 as well as buses and trams. Saint Stephans Cathedral (the very centre of Vienna) is a five-minute walk away.

*'''Meidling/Westbahnhof''' line is the railway connector, departing every 20-30 minutes and stopping at Meidling Railway Station (30min) and Westbahnhof/West Railway Station (45min).

*'''Kaisermühlen VIC/Kagran''' line goes to Vienna International Centre (the UN) and serves hotels in the eastern part of Vienna. Runs hourly and takes 20-45min. depending upon destination.

* <listing name="City Airport Train (CAT)" alt="" address="" directions="underneath terminal" phone="" url="http://www.cityairporttrain.com" hours="" price="One way €11, return trip €19" lat="" long="" email="" fax="">Over-advertised, non-stop to Wien-Mitte Station (Landstraße) in 16 minutes. Departs at :09 and :39 past every hour from 6.09 to 23.39. The return departs Wien-Mitte at :07 and :37 past the hour between 5.37 and 23.07. The CAT is only useful if it is the next train departing (otherwise take the S-Bahn S7 line, it runs the same route). If you aren't heading to Wien-Mitte area, definitely consider a more direct train or bus, it will be faster and cheaper.

Star Alliance offers check-in (including baggage) at Wien-Mitte (Landstraße) Station. Alternatively, consider luggage lockers and the regular train. City check-in may be denied from 90 minutes before departure.</listing>

*<listing name=Taxi to and from the Airport>[http://airportdriver24.at Airport taxis] (outside at the taxi rank) will charge according to the meter, with fare to the city centre likely to cost at least €50. You can try to agree a fixed fare before getting in; to anywhere for €36-€42, but if you don't care to negotiate, or your destination is at the northern or western edge of the city, a pre-booked flat-rate transfer is likely cheaper and easier. You can order online with a fixed price ab 36 €. Go back inside the airport and there are several offices at arrivals where you can arrange a cheaper car straight away or You can order directly online. </listing>

===Tax refund===
Refer to the brochure for locations and tips. Your best bet for receiving tax refund is to find a refund office in the city. Otherwise, indicate that you need to receive tax refund at check-in. You then take any checked luggage containing tax-free purchases to a customs office (right in the check-in area) to get a stamp and drop off the checked luggage; then visit a nearby refund office.

Customs officers don't normally ask you to actually unpack and show your purchases. You will be asked if any applicable purchases are in your hand luggage. Although it is illegal, you may be encouraged to lie to agents, saying that everything is in your checked luggage even if it isn't. This is due to an otherwise tedious process; you have to visit yet another office by the gates. (Especially at the C Gates--there you will have to ring for an officer, wait to be picked up by bus and taken to the a refund office and back to your departure, allow 1 hour for the whole procedure.) Alternatively, you can visit a refund office on arrival in your home country--provided that you visited customs and had your receipts stamped in Vienna. Additional commission or unfavourable exchange rate can apply if refunding in other country.

===Bratislava Milan Rastislav Štefánik Airport===
Another option if you're flying to Vienna is [[Bratislava]] Airport ({{ICAO|LZIB}}, {{IATA|BTS}}) [http://www.airportbratislava.sk/] which is located ca. 54 km (34 miles) from Vienna International Airport across the Slovak border and is the largest in the Slovak Republic. The budget airline Ryanair [http://www.ryanair.com] has the most flights. Additional carriers are Danube Wings [http://www.danubewings.com/] flying to [[Kosice]], [[Rijeka]], [[Split]] and [[Zadar]];  Norwegian Air Shuttle [http://www.norwegian.no/] to [[Oslo]] and [[Copenhagen]];  UTair [http://www.utair.ru/] to [[Moscow]] and Sun d'Or [http://www.sundor.co.il/] to [[Tel Aviv]] (seasonal flights).

====Alternatives====
There are a number of other smaller airports in the region, many are served by budget airlines: [[Linz]] (1 hour by train), [[Graz]] (2.5 hours by train), [[Brno]] (2.5 hours by train or bus), [[Bratislava]] (1 hour by bus), and [[Salzburg]] (2.5 hours by train]] . 

[[Budapest]] and [[Munich]] Airports are at least 3 and 5 hour journeys respectively but can mean substantial savings and direct flights on intercontinental trips. There is a thrice daily direct albeit not so speedy shuttle van from '''Budapest Ferihegy Airport''' to Vienna Schwechat Airport [http://www.airportshuttle.hu/], €36. It is cheaper and quicker to transfer via [[Vienna#Hungary|bus]] or [[Vienna#from_Hungary|train]] from Budapest city which can be [[Budapest#Airport_transfer|reached easily]] from Ferihegy Airport. From '''Munich International Airport''' you should take the commuter train into the city and transfer to a high-speed RailJet train to Vienna at Munich's main station. The ÖBB (Austrian Railways) [http://www.oebb.at/] sell tickets directly from that airport to Vienna from €29.

===By train===
The station names of all stops in Vienna start with its German name "Wien". This is internationally recognized and helpful for buying tickets. The railways are managed by the ÖBB (Austrian Federal Railways)[http://www.oebb.at/en/index.jsp]. Read more about [[Austria#By_train_and_bus| train travel within Austria]] and [[Austria#By_train|reaching Austria by train]].

It can be puzzling to understanding where trains depart and arrive, i.e. trains heading East often leave from West Station. It is best to check the schedules online and plug in the exact train, subway or tram stop you are going to/departing from, this will give you the quickest solution. Railway agents are likely to give you an easy answer where the most train to somewhere leave from, you may not be told about certain trains that don't fit the regular pattern.

Ticket offices are normally open during all departure hours at Wien Meidling and Wien West (around 5AM-11PM). It has come to light that with more trains leaving from stations like Wien Praterstern, trains depart outside of ticket office hours. If this is the case you can buy the ticket on-board from the conductor, they are only able to sell regular as well as certain discounted tickets (cash only), so it is best to buy ahead if possible.

Keep in mind that Google Maps only has transit information for ÖBB, and not the Viennese bus or trolley system. In general, locals are very knowledgable about moving around the city and will be happy to tell you which bus or tram to take to your destination.

====From abroad====
There are very frequent trains for all neighboring regions and countries. Night trains and quicker ''Euro-City'' trains arrive from virtually every city in Central Europe. High-speed ''ICE'', ''RailJet'', and ''Pendilino'' trains arrive from places like [[Munich]], [[Budapest]], [[Zurich]], and [[Prague]]. There are frequent (at least hourly) regional trains to Czech, Slovak and Hungarian border regions.

When buying '''tickets''' always consider '''two domestic tickets''' instead of one international one, as it is often cheaper. Tickets used to only be sold this way and can normally still be purchased '''to the border''' and then from the next conductor from there to your destination, sometimes you can even buy both tickets before departure. No, you don't actually have to change trains!

=====From Germany=====
Some of the prominent direct connections from various cities of Germany to Vienna are:
*<listing name="RailJet:">Munich</listing>
*<listing name="Euro Night Line:" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="">Dusseldorf, Cologne, Frankfurt, Nurnberg - ''runs every night''</listing>

=====From Czech Republic=====
From [[Czech Republic|Czech]] border towns and as far as [[Brno]] you can buy "Wien Spezial" discount ticket. Consider buying it conjunction with a domestic ticket if coming from elsewhere like [[Prague]], they should be able to sell you both tickets.

The ÖBB sell one-way 'SparScheine' to Brno(€12) and Prague(€29). Its cheaper to just get this to Brno and buy an onward domestic ticket to Prague(€10), and there is better availabillty than with the single Prague ticket. The information about a SparScheine ticket to Brno for €12 appears to be outdated: as of January 2017, the ÖBB ticket office in Vienna's main station was selling a three-day return ticket to Brno (133km from Vienna) for €56 -- far higher than the €16 return to Bratislava (80km from Vienna). For those wanting a day trip out of Vienna, it is therefore far better financially to travel to Bratislava. The fastest trains to Brno and Prague are offered by RailJet, leaving every 2 hours during the day (free wifi on board, but no charging sockets in 2nd-class carriages).

EURegio tickets are valid from Vienna to cities near to the border and tourist towns, including the return ticket with-in four days; [[Znojmo]] €15, [[Mikulov]] €18, [[České Budějovice]] (Budweis) €27 or [[Český Krumlov]] €27, and [[Plzeň]] €29 (children half-price, weekly and monthy tickets available).

=====From Hungary=====
From [[Budapest]] East/Keleti pu buy a discounted round-trip ticket, "kirándulójegy" (excursion or 4-day ticket) for €31. It includes the return with-in 4 days and is valid for all public transportation in Vienna for 2 days. So its a deal even if you don't need a return ticket to Budapest. There are limited amount of SparSchiene tickets each day for €13. All tickets are valid in all trains (including the high-speed RailJet). Trains confusingly depart Budapest East (Keleti pu) and arrive at Vienna West Station (Wien West). Direct trains run every two hours or more. Otherwise transfer at Győr.

to Hungary the ÖBB offers tickets from €19 to Budapest as well as the EURegio ticket (Vienna to Hungary and return with 4 days); [[Mosonmagyaróvár]] €12, Győr €19, [[Tatabánya]] €25, [[Fertöszentmiklós]] €19, and [[Szombathely]] € 22 (children half-price, weekly and monthy tickets available).

=====From Slovakia=====
From [[Bratislava]] the cheapest ticket is €11 (return), or €14 including a one-day public transportation ticket for all of Vienna. A one-way ticket is available to Rail-Plus cardholders for €10.

To Bratislava, the ÖBB offers an EURegio ticket for €14 valid for return (in 4 days) and for travel on public transportation in Bratislava on the day of arrival. Its also free to take a bike along. A one-way ticket leaving from Vienna also costs €14 but doesn't include public transportation in Bratislava, so get the EURegio ticket and maybe you can give it to someone else who's headed for Vienna once you get to Bratislava.

As of January 2017, the price of a return to Bratislava was €16. This is much cheaper than a ticket to Brno in the Czech Republic, another possible destination for day trips. Although Brno is only 133km and 1 hour 28 minutes from Vienna (by RailJet), a return ticket costs €56. Bratislava is 80km and 1 hour 6 minutes away. The ÖBB ticket office in Vienna's main station attributed the very substantial difference to a "special deal" for Bratislava.

Note that some trains from Vienna to Bratislava do not go to Bratislava main train station. Some trains end at Bratislava Petržalka, a large residential area south of the Danube. Buses go from Bratislava Petržalka to Bratislava main station, but count on 30 minutes for the transfer.

Tickets from Vienna to cities beyond Bratislava (such as Banská Bystrica) can be bought at Vienna main train station, with little or no mark-up.

====From the East of Europe====
via [[Slovakia]] or [[Hungary]].

Each railway has an independent partnership with others, so tickets can be much cheaper to (or from) neighboring countries. A common type is the so called CityStar ticket that is valid for return and can be sold any station in both of the participating countries. [[Sopron]] in Hungary is near to Vienna (€14, hourly trains) for tickets on MÁV Hungarian Railways [http://www.mav.hu/] at that train station (operated by the Raaberbahn Railway [https://www.gysev.hu/]). Hungarian prices [http://www.mav-start.hu/res/vasuti_menetdijtablazatok-09-12-13.pdf]. [[Bratislava]] in Slovakia is another nearby alternative. Most tickets need to be purchased 3 days in advance, possibly meaning an extra trip to the border to buy the ticket in advance.
*'''Ukraine''' and '''Russia''' There is a blog about its use between Austria and CIS countries [http://citystarticket.blogspot.com/2007/07/getting-citystar-ticket-and.html]. 
*'''Greece''' CityStar tickets are sold between anywhere in Greece and Hungary.
*'''Bulgaria''' BDZ[http://www.bdz.bg/] sell the return CityStar directly to Vienna (€88), a group of 3 will pay €59 each. Conversly you'll have to go to the Hungarian Railways if you want to go the other way.
*'''Turkey''' Buy a ticket to the border at Kapikule (€5 from [[Istanbul]]), get a ticket from Bulgarian Railways.
*'''Serbia''' Serbian Railways [http://www.serbianrailways.com/] sell the so called ''Wien Spezial'' for €70 return from Belgrade, but a cheaper connection can be made through Budapest, buying the Budapest-Vienna portion in Hungary (€56 return).

===By car===
Car ownership is common in Vienna and about 1/3 of the trips taken within the city are by car. However, since parking space is scarce in the central districts and parking fees are steep, it's usually a good idea for visitors to leave their car parked somewhere in the periphery and use the city's excellent subway & tram system to get to the center.

For using the Austrian highway system, you will need a toll sticker ("Autobahnvignette"), which you can buy at gas stations and rest stops. There are stickers for 10 days (€8), 2 months (€23,40) and 1 year (€77,80).

In Vienna, avoid the A23 Südosttangente at rush hour. Traffic jams are almost guaranteed there as well as throughout the city streets at rush hour.

'''Parking''' anywhere within districts 1-9, 20, and in specially marked areas is restricted to 120 minutes (from 9:00 and 22:00, M-F) and subject to a fee of €2 per hour unless you have a resident permit. The municipality provides detailed information on parking on their website in English [http://www.wien.gv.at/english/transportation/parking/]. If you're unsure whether fees apply to the place you're in there's a free Android app that can help you [https://market.android.com/details?id=org.lukrop.kpw&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsIm9yZy5sdWtyb3Aua3B3Il0.]. Payment is made by marking the time of arrival on a ticket ("Parkschein"), which can be bought at tobacco shops. If you have an Austrian cell number, you can pay by text or using a smartphone app [https://www.handyparken.at/handyparken/home.seam]

A much cheaper and often more convenient alternative is '''Park and Ride''', available at some subway stations in the city periphery [http://parkandride.at/] for €3 per day. The weekly rates come with a discount if you add a subway/tram ticket. Commercial car parks ("Parkhaus", "Parkgarage") are available throughout the city, but these can be very expensive (for instance, €32 per day in the Parkgarage Freyung). Another option is to leave the car in the street in one of the outer districts. However, since the option is rather popular, parking space has become rather scarce there, too.

===By bus===
There is a slew of international bus services coming into Vienna daily. It is safe to assume that discounts are available (about 10% from Eurolines affiliates, about 15% on independent carriers) for those under 26 and over 60 on walk-up fares but not on discounted advanced purchase ("promo") tickets.

Eurolines Austria, is the largest operator. Euroline's own vehicles have assured quality, but this is not the case of all of their international partners. Confusingly Eurolines Austria is doesn't always cooperate with an inbound Eurolines affiliate from an other country, for instance there are two competing Eurolines services (Slovak and Austria) to Bratislava departing from separate stops. Always check the webpages of both the arrival and departure countries' Eurolines affiliated operator for the best price as well as checking for non-affiliated carriers. 

There are two main bus stations in Vienna, as well as other locations where national and international services deposite passengers.
*'''Vienna International Busterminal (VIB)''' located adjacent to the subway stop Erdberg (U3) is overseen by by the local Eurolines affiliate ''Blaguss'', who publish timetables [http://www.eurolines.at/en/home/travel_with_eurolines/timetables/]. 
*'''Waldmanngründen''' on the southwest corner of '''Südtirolerplatz'''(U1, S-Bahn) is a stop with an office only for services to Bratislava, other operators have offices in the nearby streets or just operate curbside services. 
*'''Praterstern''' on the (U1, U2 and S-Bahn) has two main bus stops, one in Lasellestraße for Tourbus and Student Agency services from the Czech Republic and one in Nordbahnstraße for Orangeways service to Hungary.
*'''Vienna International Airport''' is served by nearly all buses to Bratislava, the Czech Republic, and Hungary, in addition to each bus line's city stop.

====Austria====
There are few private domestic inter-city bus lines in Austria. Several regional services to Vienna operated by a mix of the federal government, the states of [[Lower Austria]] and [[Burgenland]], local governments and coach operators. Sometimes the cash-price for these is marginally lower than the train, otherwise the normal VOR public transport rates apply. They are most useful for traveling to the countryside, though timing and different departure locations in Vienna can make them attractive for inter-city travel in certain cases. All routes are operated with high-quality coaches and regional buses.

====Balkans====
If you are travelling from the [[Balkans]] there are plenty of buses daily. Some may not be advertised and tickets are often not for sale at the ticket counter but rather from the bus driver or attendant. Ask around the bus stations, most of them leave in the afternoon. Buses from non-EU countries may be subject to higher scrutiny at the border. Sometimes operators smuggle or transport goods to supplement their low fares and the Hungarian border guards are not afraid to accept bribes from non-EU operators. You will likely never be asked to participate monetarily, although a bus driver may ask to put a carton of cigarettes above your seat or in your luggage. Legally, you're transporting "your own" one-carton cigarette allowance across the border, so you will not get in any trouble for that. It's also okay to decline to co-operate.

Most buses from Serbia go to VIB Erdberg (U3) while most buses from Albania go to Südtirolerplatz (U1). Bus lines from Bosnia and Croatia are split between the two bus stations.

===Public transportation===
Vienna has a good public transport system [http://www.wien.gv.at/english/transportation-urbanplanning/public-transport/], which includes rail, commuter rail, underground, trams (trolleys), and buses. The underground is very efficient and will take you to within a few minutes walk of anywhere you are likely to want to visit. The subway alone has the second highest per-capita ridership in the world, and that is not accounting for the 27 tram lines, dozens of train lines or numerous buses.

Note: Google Maps works with most public transport options, including the underground (U-Bahn). The city has decided to make its travel data more available to 3rd parties.

====Fares====
Public transportation within the city proper, including most everywhere you are likely to visit (the entire subway and tram network) is considered a single (core) zone ("Kernzone 100"). Any combination of transportation may be used: subways, all trains (including inter-city and express trains, provided you are traveling between two Viennese stations), trams, buses, night buses, and an inter-urban railway (Wiener Lokalbahn) – again, within city limits.

Pre-sold blank tickets must be validated before entering the subway platform or train, or as soon as you get on a bus or tram (unless simply continuing your journey by switching lines or modes of transportation). You do not have to show your ticket to the bus driver or tram operator; use one of the blue metal boxes ("Entwerter") to stamp your ticket. There may be occasional spot checks (including checks of all tickets at the exit of selected subway stations), but the penalty for traveling without a valid ticket (€ 105 when paid on the spot) is rarely enforced against non-residents.

The most convenient way to get a ticket is to use the WienMobil app ([https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.wienerlinien.wienmobillab PlayStore], [https://itunes.apple.com/at/app/wienmobil/id1107918142?l=en&mt=8 AppStore]) which supports PayPal, various credit cards and other payment options. Tickets are also available at vending machines (Visa and Mastercard accepted) and from counters at subway and railway stations as well as tobacco shops (Tabak "Trafik"). Single tickets can also sometimes be purchased in trams (with a 20 cent surcharge) for € 2.60 (children: € 1.40). These should not be relied upon, however: Not all trams have them, sometimes they only accept coins, etc. There is currently (2022) no way to buy a ticket after boarding a bus or train (except using the app mentioned above).

*''Single Trip Ticket'' € 2,40 (as of Oct 2022) A single direction uninterrupted trip to anywhere, with as many transfers as needed. (Children aged 6 to 14, Dogs €1.20) 
*''Day ticket'' € 5.80 (as of Oct 2022) Valid on the chosen day until 1AM. 
*''24-hour ticket'' € 8.00 (as of Oct 2022) Valid from time stamped.
*''48-hour ticket'' € 14,10 (as of Oct 2022) Valid from time stamped.
*''72-hour ticket'' € 17,10 (as of Oct 2022) Valid from time stamped.
*''7-days ticket'' € 17,10 (as of Oct 2022) Valid for 7 days starting from the date of your choice.
*''31-days ticket'' € 51,00 (as of Oct 2022) Valid for 31 days starting from the date of your choice.

Children up to 14 do not need a ticket on Sundays, holidays and during Austrian school holidays. Students enrolled in Austrian schools are similarly exempt from 15 to 19 years of age.

If you are staying for a few days and hope to do a lot of sightseeing and/or shopping, the '''Vienna Card''' (Wien Karte) [http://www.wienkarte.at/EN/?l=e] is a good deal. It is good for 24 hours (13,90€), 48 hours (21,90€) or 72 hours (24,90€) of unlimited public transit within Vienna. The card also gets you discounts (typically €1 or €2 at the major museums and art galleries) to many attractions and shops. You can buy it at the airport, hotels, and underground stops.

[[Image:Tram Map Vienna.png|thumb|right|450px|An unofficial tram-network map.]]

See the [[Vienna#Airport transfer|airport section]] for details on transfer to/from the airport.

====Network====
The best rail (heavy rail and underground) transport map [http://www.oebb.at/de/Reisen_in_Oesterreich/Wien/S-Bahn/Netzplan_Wien.pdf] is displayed at all ÖBB stations. There are so many lines that maps are normally very simplified, and there are no maps of the tram network. It can pay to ask or check the best connection ahead of time [http://www.wienerlinien.at/wl/ep/home.do?tabId=0]. Major stations are well signed and connections are scheduled to match-up if service isn't frequent.

====Rail====
Vienna's suburban rail network is often overlooked by tourists. It comprises three types of trains: '''S-Bahn''', which mostly serve inner suburbs and stop at all stations with few exceptions, '''Regionalbahn''', which are generally more long-distant than the S-Bahn and make limited stops on parallell S-Bahn routes, but otherwise all stops, and '''RegionalExpress''', which mostly serve the outermost suburbs and make very limited stops in the inner suburbs (although not all RegionalExpress trains are suburban trains). The network also stretches over the borders of the neighbouring countries.

The most important rail streches:
*'''Stammstrecke''' trains (i.e. ''Meidling''-''Südtirolerplatz''-''Südbahnhof''-''Rennweg''-''Mitte''-''Praterstern''-''Florisdorf'') run every 2-5 min (the right platform goes northbound and vice versa). This is not a line itself but rather the result of the bunch of lines using the same stretch.

*'''S45''' runs in the northwest of the city every 5-10 min along a beautiful railway built by architect Otto Wagner.

Rail trips to the suburbs of Vienna (in Vienna city all rail stations start with "Wien") require an extra ticket. These are avaialble as zones in VOR (Austria's Eastern Transit Region) or as point to point tickets from the railways. It is easiest to buy extra zones from the edge of the city. If you have a Vorteilscard a railway ticket will be cheaper; if you are planning to transfer to a bus the VOR-ticket is also valid for it, with-in the same zone.

[[Image:U-Bahn-Netz_Wien_2010.png|thumb|right|450px|Vienna's U-Bahn network]]

====U-Bahn====
The five '''U-bahn''' lines (i.e. ''U1'') are the most common way of getting around Vienna. These underground, metro or subway lines have trains every 2-7 minutes and cover most of the important parts of the city and sights.

====Tram====
Tram(''Bim'', ''Straßenbahn'') lines have just a plain number or letter (''O'',''1''). There are 27 lines which stop locally, useful for taking things a bit slower and seing more of the city.

The famous '''Ring lines''' were recently changed: there is a tourist tram[http://www.wienerlinien.at/wl/ep/programView.do?channelId=-28163&programId=19580] around the ring, or you can take tram 1 (bound for ''Prater-Hauptalle'') from ''Oper'' to ''Schwedenplatz'' and take tram 2 (bound for ''Ottakring'') from ''Schwedenplatz'' back to ''Oper''.

====Badner Train====
The Wiener Lokalbahn (''WLB'') also referred to as the Badner-Bahn is an interurban railway traveling from the Opera running as a tram on-street southwest through Vienna to Meidling station where it becomes a railway continuing onwards through the 23rd District and through suburbs and the rolling wine hills in [[Lower Austria]] to Baden.

====Bus====
Bus lines are denoted by a number that ends in letter (i.e. ''3A'', ''80B''). You are unlikely to need to take a bus, but it is safe to assume if you see one that you can get on and it will take you to some higher form of transportation like the U-Bahn. Cheaper tickets (€1) are available for most 'B' buses; regular tickets and passes are also valid.

====Night Services====
The regular trams, trains and buses run until about 00:30 (just past midnight). Most of the commuter rail is shut between 1 AM and 4 AM. On Friday and Saturday (as well as on nights before holidays), the entire U-Bahn network runs all night. Additionally, a dense network of night buses, called "NightLiners" is available every night of the year. Regular tickets are valid. Most buses terminate at "Kärntner Ring, Oper", which allows for easy interchange. Intervals are every 15-30 min. Daytime service resumes at 5 AM.

===By taxi===
[[Image:Fiaker Wien.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Fiaker coachmen waiting for customers]]
Taxis are plentiful and can normally be hailed on the street or found at a taxi stand. Fares are set to a meter price, but if you prefer, you can always negotiate a fare. Always negotiate when traveling to the airport or outside of the city limits as fares are not set to those places. Pedicabs, horse-drawn coaches and the like are also available.

===By car===
Avoid driving a car within the central ring if possible. While cars are allowed on many of the streets there, the streets are narrow and mostly one-way. They can be confusing for a visitor and parking is extremely limited (and restricted during the day). Due to the comprehensiveness of the transit system, you most likely will not need a car within Vienna, except for excursions elsewhere.

Furthermore, it might be a good idea to leave your car at home during rush hours. Vienna's streets can become a little clogged in the mornings and early evenings and the drivers are not really known for being especially polite and friendly.

Pedestrians have the right of way in crossing all roads at a crosswalk where there is no pedestrian signal present. If there is such a pedestrian crossing on an otherwise straight section of the road, there will be a warning sign: you are required to yield to any pedestrian on this crossing. Austrians accustomed to experienced local drivers will step out with little thought and force you to stop, so slow down here and be careful. When driving in a neighborhood this "right of way to pedestrians" is an understood rule at every intersection, although pedestrians will be more careful before they step out. Again, be on the lookout for this: if you see a pedestrian waiting to cross, you should stop at the intersection for him or her.

===By bicycle===
[[Image:ViennaBicycleStand.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Bicycle stand pump at Siebenstern]]

Cycling is another option for travelling within Vienna, although it is still seen more as a leisure activity in Vienna. [http://www.wien.gv.at/english/leisure/bike/index.htm] Vienna's compact size makes cycling attractive. On a bicycle you can reach most places of interest within half an hour. There are many bicycle paths and lanes along major streets, in parks, and by the rivers. However, it can be complicated to cross town because the lanes follow illogical routes. One major complaint is that bicycle facilites were an afterthought and this is very appearant, many stop lights and intersections are dangerously or annoyingly set for bicyclists and paths are very illogical: they are sometimes on-street sometimes off, sometimes shared with pedestrians, sometimes not, and can vary or end out of nowhere. You are required by law to use a bike lane or path if there is one, unless it is marked using a square sign or blocked, otherwise regular traffic laws apply. Lights are required at night as are independently functioning brakes.

If your destination is in the outer suburbs, or you want to take a relaxed ride to the countryside, you may consider taking your bike for free on the U-Bahn (prohibited at [https://www.fahrradwien.at/tipps-und-regeln/rad-und-oeffis/ rush hour], and not possible at all in buses and trams) or on a train. You will need a [https://shop.oebbtickets.at/en/ticket ticket] for your bike on trains.

* '''WienMobil Rad''' [https://www.wienerlinien.at/wienmobil/rad] is the new bike sharing offer subsidised by the city of Vienna. Once completed, by the end of 2022, there will be over 200 stations where rides can be started or finished. It is operated by nextbike. In order to get started, you will have to install the nextbike app ([https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.nextbike PlayStore], [https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/nextbike/id504288371 AppStore]) and follow the instructions there. Pricing is comparably cheap at 0,60€ for each half hour or part thereof. Make sure that there is a station to return the bike at your destination.

* '''Pedal Power''' [http://www.pedalpower.at/] offers guided bicycle tours and bicycle rental. They deliver to hotels or you can pick them up at the State Opera (subway station U1/U2/U4 Karlspatz) for a discount.

===On foot===
[[Image:ViennaGrabenWT.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Graben]]

Walking can also be very pleasant. The inner ring is quite compact with lots of pleasant cobblestoned and paved streets. It can be crossed in about 20 min.

Bring a comfortable pair of walking shoes as this is the most common way of getting around.

==Talk==
Most Viennese speak a range and mix of Austro-Bavarian (a German dialect group) and Standard German ("Hochdeutsch") as their mother tongue, unlike in most other parts of Austria where pure dialect is much more prevalent. Nevertheless, with the possible partial exception of old people in the outer suburbs, everyone will be able to speak standard German to you fluently. Standard German here means Austrian German, which differs slightly in vocabulary and more so in pronunciation. However, the differences are small enough that German-speaking foreigners should understand. 
Should someone be so proud as to continue speaking in dialect and you don't understand, just ask the person to speak "Hochdeutsch" (standard German, literally "high German") and he/she usually will.

German is the sole official language and thus the main recognized written language.

People in jobs dealing with foreign visitors are usually fluent in English, though English is not as universally spoken as in northern European countries, and signs (including descriptive signs in museums) don't as often include English translations as in some other European countries, so those who don't speak German may find a traveler's phrase book or bilingual dictionary useful in some situations.

Minority languages are wide spread as well, such as Serbo-Croatian, Turkish, Slovak, Hungarian and Romanian.

==See==
Vienna has a rich history as the capital city of the monarchy and thus abundant historical buildings and museums. The most of these, including '''Stephansdom (St. Stephen's Cathedral)''' and the two most well-known museums, '''Kunsthistorisches Museum''' (Museum of Fine Arts) and '''Albertina''', are located in the Innere Stadt.  The '''Ring Road''' (German: ''Ringstraße'') is a circular road surrounding the Innere Stadt district of Vienna and is one of its main sights. Its architecture is typical of the eclectic, historicist style called ''Ringstraßenstil'' (Ring Road Style) of the 1860s to 1890s. Built in the style of the Renaissance according to plans by Heinrich von Ferstel, the '''MAK- Austrian Museum of Applied Arts / Contemporary Art''' is the first museum building on the ''Ringstraße''. The Schloss Schönbrunn palace, a part of the UNESCO World heritage list, is located in the Outer West district.

* '''Ball Season''': One thing you should not miss when you visit Vienna during the carnival season is to attend one of the many glamourous balls in the city, some of them in wonderful elegant locations like the Vienna Hofburg or the City Hall (Rathaus). The most widely known and elegant balls are the Opera Ball in the State Opera [http://www.staatsoper.at] or the ball of the ''Wiener Philharmoniker''. Many professional guilds have their own ball like e.g. the ''Kaffeesiederball'' by the Vienna Coffee house owners. The ball calendar can be found on the pages of the [http://www.wien.gv.at/vadb/internet/AdvPrSrv.asp?Layout=Ballkalender&Type=S Vienna City Council]

* Classical Concerts: Every day, up to three dozen classical [https://www.vienna-unwrapped.com/vienna-concerts-2/'''Vienna Concerts'''] take place in the city. The most famous concert is the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra's New Year's Concert, which is broadcast live across the world from Vienna's Musikverein each year.

*There are also a lot of other '''open-air-film festivals''' in summer, e.g. at the Augarten, the Vienna Turf Krieau, the Prater, and Schloss Neugebäude. 

*In the summer, there is also '''the ImPulsTanz Festival''' [http://www.impulstanz.at] for contemporary dance & performance. They are also good if you are interested in dance workshops.

*Every other year, starting in 2015, the [http://www.viennabiennale.org/en//'''Vienna Biennale'''] takes place. It is the first event of its kind to combine art, design, and architecture.

==Buy==
Store hours are generally 8/9AM-6/7PM Monday-Friday, 9AM-1/6PM Saturday, Closed Sunday. There are slightly longer hours at some malls. Credit cards are normally accepted at large and at high-end stores. All chains that you can find in the malls also have stores on the city's shopping streets, which tend to be more accessible and tourist-friendly.

[[Image:Mariahilferstrasse1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Mariahilferstraße looking toward the district Mariahilf]]

[[Image:ViennaKraut.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Kraut on Naschmarkt]]


===Duty-free shopping===
Vienna airport has a duty free shopping area with 70 shops. Plan around one hour if you're going to visit every other shop. The shopping area is just after ticket control counters, so you only need to checkin before getting to shops, not pass security check nor passport control.

===Outdoor markets===
There are 21 '''markets''' [http://www.wien.gv.at/english/fima/markets.htm] with stands and small characteristically Viennese hut-like shops that are open daily (except Sunday). Additionally many of these have true farmers' markets, often on Saturday mornings. There is a large variety of sellers and markets, from the upscale to the dirt cheap. Each has several shops of different kinds (butcher, bakery, produce, coffee, etc.). There is another handful of weekly farmers markets [http://www.tourmycountry.com/austria/markets-vienna.htm] around the city as well as seasonal markets like the christmas markets.

====Christmas markets====
[[File:Christmasmarket in Vienna.png|thumb|300px| Christmas market]]
[[File:Rathaus Christmas Market.jpg|thumb|300px|Rathaus Christmas Market]]
Open from Nov 15s or 20s to Dec 23th or 24th, most Viennese Christmas Markets ("Christkindlmarkt", "Adventmarkt" or simply "Weihnachtsmarkt")  are not so much for shopping as for eating and drinking. From midday until the late hours of the night, people gather at Christmas markets to drink mulled wine, punch, and chat to one another and the occasional stranger. Entry to all of these markets is free.

* '''Rathaus''' [http://www.christkindlmarkt.at/]: More of a fairground than a Christmas market, this is Vienna's largest and busiest incarnation. Located on the large town square between Rathaus and Burgtheater, the Wiener Christkindlmarkt is by far the largest and probably best known christmas market in Vienna. Large christmas tree in front of the townhall, skating possibility, adorned trees in the park, often crowded! 

* '''Spittelberg''' [http://www.spittelberg.at/weihnachtsmarkt/english/markt.htm]: Probably the most delightful, though often quite packed Christmas market in Vienna, the Spittelberg market is scattered over a series of lanes lined with picturesque early 19th century [[Biedermeier]] houses (many of them former brothels, which is the reason the area was spared early 20th century urban renewal). Some of the stalls are extensions of the shops and bars of this normally rather sleepy area. 

* '''Maria-Theresien-Platz''' [http://www.weihnachtsdorf.at/weihnachtsdorf/en/mtp/index.html]: A relatively new market between the two museums and en route to/from the MuseumsQuartier (MQ). It is easy to maneuver than some and the quality of the goods is better than most. 

* '''Schönbrunn''' [http://www.weihnachtsmarkt.co.at/engl/info.html]: One of the better markets with higher quality goods and a more festive atmosphere in front of [[Schönbrunn]] palace. It is easier to spread out here and the specialties are food, handmade soaps, and candles.

* '''Belvedere''' [http://www.weihnachtsdorf.at/weihnachtsdorf/en/bvd/index.html]: Another recent addition to the city's Christmas markets, the market in front of the [[Belvedere]] palace is spacious and emphasizes the homespun.

* '''Resselpark/Karlsplatz''' - A small, alternative and more rambunctious Christmas market in front of Karlskirche. 

* '''Freyung''' [http://www.altwiener-markt.at/9379]: A fine market in the First District frequented by locals and professionals on their lunch break and downtown shoppers. Focus on handicrafts and original gifts such as hand-made Christmas decorations, mangers or objects made of natural materials. Christmas cakes and biscuits as well as hot punch and Glühwein. There are usually fewer tourists.

Further afield a famous and overly bustling Christmas market may be found at Grafenegg castle [http://www.grafenegg.at]. Entry is €7, children under the age of 12 are free.

===Charity sales===
Charity auctions are common in Vienna. Some stores give their proceeds to social programmes (often second-hand store back-to-work programs similar to Goodwill, or other charity shops).
*'''International Festival Charity Bazaar''' [http://www.iaea.org/unwg/bazaar] taking place in 2012 on December 3rd at the Austria Center U1 – Station Kaisermühlen, has been organized yearly for over 40 years by the ladies of the United Nations Women’s Guild of Vienna. Volunteers, from a 100 different countries, who have some kind of connection to the United Nations, organize it and all proceeds from the Bazaar go to children’s charities in Austria and around the world.

===Groceries===
Viennese '''supermarkets''' are not very large, especially compared with the hypermarkets covering the rest of Central Europe. However, there is practically one on every corner. They are open roughly M-F 07:00-19:00 and Saturdays 07:00-18:00. Only stores in main train stations (Wien Mitte, Hauptbahnhof, Westbahnhof, Praterstern and Franz-Josef-Bahnhof), one at the General Hospital (Allgemeines Krankenhaus, AKH) and three at the airport are open later (Praterstern and Franz-Josef until 22:00, Westbahnhof and the airport to 23:00), on Sunday and on public holidays. [http://www.hofer.at '''Hofer'''], [http://www.penny.at/ '''Penny'''], and [http://www.lidl.at '''Lidl'''] strive to be discount stores, whereas [http://www.billa.at/ '''Billa'''], [http://www.spar.at/ '''Spar'''] and [http://www.merkur.at/ '''Merkur'''] tout variety and quality. There is not a major difference in prices. Most regular stores have a deli where the shop assistants make sandwiches for the cost of the ingredients you select. Although many products are Austrian most of the chains are not actually Austrian-owned except Spar. If you want to support the local economy more you can do so by frequenting independent shops or visiting actual markets.

'''Upmarket grocers''' are not common in Vienna.

Viennese restaurant '''menus''' offer a bewildering variety of terms for dishes, most of which the visitor will never have heard of and many of which aren't in the brief lists of menu terms included in phrase books. However restaurants that have any foreign patrons at all usually have an English menu, though you may have to ask for it:  the phrase "English menu" usually will be understood even by wait staff who don't speak English.  A small bilingual dictionary will be useful for trying to decipher menu listings:  at least it will enable you usually to determine what sort of food (chicken, beef, potato, etc.) is concerned, even if you can't tell how it's prepared. Not only savoury but also sweet main dishes are common in Austria.

Viennese restaurant '''portions''' tend to be large. Recently many restaurants are including more vegetarian options. Most restaurants have daily specials listed on a chalk board or sometimes on a printed insert in the regular menu. These are usually the best bet, though they may not be on the English menu, so you may have to ask to have them explained or try to translate them yourself.

{{infobox|Tobacco|Smoking used to be ubiquitous in Vienna's bars and restaurants. Since 2019, when Austria became one of the last European countries to ban smoking in these establishments, this is no longer the case. In addition, smoking is also prohibited in the usual places, like schools and offices, airports, train and subway stations, museums, hospitals, stores and shopping malls, cinemas and theatres etc. That said, smoking in public is by no means considered socially unacceptable. People frequently smoke in the street, at bus and tramway stations, even at outdoor dining tables.

'''Buying cigarettes''' is more or less only possible at tobacconists ("Trafik"). Vending machines are frequent, but since selling tobacco to minors is illegal they all require an Austrian bank debit card ("Bankomatkarte") to operate. In a pinch, a pack of cigarettes can be obtained in most bars and restaurants, at a legally mandated surcharge of at least 10%.
}}

'''Bread''' in Viennese restaurants is usually charged as an extra; if there is a basket of it on the table, you'll usually be charged by the piece only if you take some.

'''Tipping customs''' are similar to those in Europe, i.e.: not required unless you want to especially reward good service. Ten percent is usually sufficient in restaurants. Traditionally the way to tip a waiter is to mention the amount of the bill plus tip when you pay; for instance, if the bill is €15.50 you could give the waiter a €20 note and say "siebzehn (seventeen)," meaning he is to take out €15.50 for the bill, €1.50 for the tip, and so give you only €3 change. In this situation English numbers will usually be understood. Sometimes in less formal restaurants you can alternatively drop the tip into the money pouch the waiter usually carries.

'''Credit cards''' are now commonly used in restaurants, with the ability to add tip via card as well (though you must specify the total amount as described above).

===Street food===
The traditional Viennese fast food is '''sausage''' in all shapes and sizes. You can buy hot sausages and hot dogs at snack bars called "Würstlstand" all over the town. The famous Wiener Würstel is known as "Frankfurter" in Vienna, but many inhabitants prefer Bosna (with onions and curry), Burenwurst, and Käsekrainer or "Eitrige" (with melted cheese inside). 

In addition to this, the '''local snack culture''' also includes more ex-Yugoslavian and Turkish varieties of fast food, such as the  Döner Kebap, sandwiches of Greek and Turkish origin with roasted meat, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and yogurt and/or hot sauce. Places that sell kebap often sell take-away slices of pizza too.

Good '''kebaps''' can be bought at the Naschmarkt. The lower end of the Naschmarkt (further away from Karlsplatz or city centre) is cheaper than the upper end (closer to Karlsplatz), and the right lane (facing away from the city centre) is reserved for mostly sit-down eateries. Another good place to find snacks (especially while going out) is Schwedenplatz, also on the U4 and U1 line.

By far the cheapest way to get a fast food meal in Austria (and probably the only meal available for just over €1) is buying an Austrian sandwich (sliced brown bread + ham/cheese + gherkin) from a supermarket. Supermarkets with a  deli counter (Feinkostabteilung) will prepare sandwiches to take away at no extra charge. You only pay for the ingredients. There is usually a large selection of meat products, cheese, and bread rolls available here, too. You point at the combination you want, can also mention the max total you can pay, and then pay at the cash register. One of the favorites is the "Leberkässemel", which is like a bigger but less dense version of a high quality hot dog on a bun. There is a nice supermarket,"Spar", that caters towards this idea, with WiFi, off of the U2's MuseumsQuartier train stop. Freshness and quality at the grocery stores are normally better than at a sandwich stand on the street.

Another great way to eat on a budget is at one of Vienna's hundreds of bakeries. They sell anything from cinnamon rolls to pizza for a good price. It's also a great breakfast-on-the-run alternative because they also have coffee/espresso to go.  However, most places do have a couple of tables and chairs where you can enjoy your food.

==Drink==

===Cafés===
Vienna's ''Kaffeehäuser'' (coffee houses) are world famous for their grandness and the lively coffee house culture. Skipping the ''Kaffeehauskultur'' is missing out a big part of Viennese culture. You should at least visit one of the countless traditional baroque 19th or funky 20th century where you can sit down, relax, and enjoy refreshments.

Most cafés also serve beer, wine and liqueurs. Many serve meals, especially at lunch, and these are often cheaper than in restaurants. Most have a fine selection of ''Torten'' (tortes or cakes), some offer other baked goods. In general some are more restaurant-like, some more café-like and some more bar-like.

====Coffee====
{{infobox|"Entschuldigen Sie Frau/Herr Ober!"|Although the head waitress/waiter (''Ober'') of most cafés is not nearly as snooty as they might let on, there are some '''definite don'ts''':
*Don't ask for coffee to go. International chains and many bakeries offer it if you really need it.
*Don't just order ''"coffee"'' - that is like going into a restaurant and ordering ''"food."'' Find a type that suits your taste.
*Don't expect your waitress/waiter to just bring you the bill - you are supposed to ask for it when you are finished and ready to go. It is considered impolite for them to rush you by bringing it on their own.
*If the service has been good, you may like to tip when you pay, for example, by rounding up about 10%. Say explicitly how much you wish to pay (e.g., €3.50 for a €3.20 coffee) when handing the money the waitress/waiter.
Remember: cafés are a very slow-paced environment, so approach them as you would a sit-down restaurant -- bring a book or some friends, or make use of the newspapers on hand and enjoy your hours relaxing there!
}}
Coffee is obviously an important part of the coffeehouse culture. Vienna was not only the center of the Austrian Empire but also the center of a much larger coffee empire, and the local roasts were sold across Europe. Today many people are still familiar with the term ''Vienna roast''.

Vienna prides itself of its dozens of varieties of different coffees, although the Italian style and names are better known by many youth than the Viennese, the cafés are keeping the traditions alive. Most commonly:
*'''Kleiner Schwarzer''' also known simply as a '''Schwarzer''' or as a '''Mokka''' is the Viennese version of espresso. It is made with a tick more water, a Viennese roast (the point between origin and roast flavor) and it is pulled slowly allowing it to oxidize.
*'''Großer Schwarzer''' is simply a double Schwarzer (similar to a double espresso).
*'''Kleiner Brauner''' is a mokka (espresso) with cream, often on the side.
*'''Großer Brauner''' is a double Mokka with cream.
*'''Melange''' is prehaps the most typical Viennese coffee. Similar to cappuccino but with the Viennese style mokka and more foamy milk in equal parts.
*''''Verlängerter''' is mokka (espresso) with extra hot water, similar to a small Americano.
*'''Kapuziner''' is a mokka (espresso) with a dollop of whipped cream on top.
*'''Kaffee Verkehrt''' (or in the more modern places '''Kaffee Latte''') is the local version of a latte.
*'''Einspänner''' is a mokka served in a small glass (instead of a traditional coffee cup) with whipped cream on top. For the best taste, drink the coffee through the whipped cream (don't eat the whipped cream before you start drinking your coffee).

Also consider specialties like the ''Kaisermelange'' (coffee, milk, egg yolk and cognac) on the menu. Most cafés have a house specialty (for instance, "Kaffee Central" at Café Central).

====Coffee houses====
'''Finding a café''' is not hard in Vienna; Finding a particular café you are looking for is another story. Most of the baroque "top" coffee houses are on the Ring and main streets of the Innere Stadt (District 1), mostly cozier and often less formal 1970s or 80s modern style coffee houses are hidden away on the Innere Stadt's backstreets, and distributed across the rest of the city.

===Water===
Rather unusually it is necessary to say some words about Vienna's drinking water which is really unique in Europe.
The majority of Vienna's water comes from the three "Hochquellwasserleitungen." Meaning "high-(as in mountain) spring waterlines (as in aqueducts). Indeed the city's water flows through aqueducts from the mountains around 100 kilometres south of Vienna (Schneeberg and Hochschwab). These were built during the reign of Emperor Franz Josef and supply Vienna with nearly unchlorinated high-quality drinking water, with a considerably higher quality than many bottled waters.
So if you visit this city, it is not necessary to buy water, you can simply drink tap water here - unless you prefer sparkling water.

Another speciality is that at typical coffeehouses a coffee is always accompanied by a glass of cold clear water.
In most restaurants, you can get a glass of drinking water for free with any order, just specify tap water ("Leitungswasser").

===Wine===
New wine is usually enjoyed at a ''Heurigen'' (family-run vineyard bars allowed to the the new vintage). Austria in general, but especially the area around Vienna, produces quite a large amount of wine each year. There are even many vineyards within the city in Döbling (19th District). The wine is not often exported and white is more common than red. Grüner Veltliner is a common tart and fresh white wine served almost everywhere. Officially the new wine season begins on November 11 (St Martin's Day), but as early as September, some partially-fermented new wine (called ''Sturm'' which is cloudy, because it has not been strained) is available around town at stands and in 2L green bottles (try the Naschmarkt – sometimes the vendors will have samples, it is less strong than wine, about 4 percent alcohol ). Taverns can call themselves Heurigens whether the wine they serve is their own or not – for genuine in-house product look for a ''Buschenschank''. This is a particularly Viennese Heuriger which can only be open 300 days per year or until their supply of house-made wine runs out. Heurigen can be found e.g. in Grinzing, Sievering (19th district) and Mauer & Rodaun (23rd district) areas, but also in almost every suburban area in Vienna. Even in the center, there are some ''Stadtheurigen''. While the Heurigen of Grinzing are bigger and more famous with tourists, they are often a rip-off. If any of the year’s vintage lasts until next year, it officially becomes ''Alte'' (old) wine on the next Saint Martin's Day.
The Heurigen in the South of Vienna or in [[Perchtoldsdorf]] are much cheaper and serve the same quality as the Heurigen in Grinzing. Also in the Northern suburbs, you can find cheap and somewhat authentic Heurigen. Try the towns of [[Stammersdorf]] or [[Hagenbrunn]], for example Karl Matzka [http://www.matzka.at.tt/], hard to reach by public transport.

After a long day, the perfect place to relax among Viennese are the Heurigen in the suburbs. Somewhat akin to a beer garden, except with wine, these tiny treasures are the only places authorized to serve new wine. New wine is made from the first pressing of the grape and can appear a little cloudy. Be careful, it's stronger than you might think! This is why it's served in very small glasses, .25L and up. Some Heurigen serve food, either elaborate Viennese specialties or very simple bread and cheese platters. No matter which one you choose, you're guaranteed to enjoy yourself. Just hop on a convenient outbound tram line, take it to the very last stop, and look for buildings with large, evergreen foliage hung over the doors. Each one is unique, but all are a good bargain (~€1,50 for 175mL, ~€11/L). If you're a planner, just search 'heurigen' in Google Maps near the last stop of a metro line. Locals invariably have a favorite: ask around.

===Wine bars===

Shop locations include Naschmarkt, Marihilfer str., near Burggarten and near Stephansplatz. </drink>

===Bars and beerhouses=== 
[[Image:ViennaBeerG.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Beer garden]]

===Nightlife===
Despite Vienna's stuck-up reputation don't be led to believe it is a quiet city. There are diverse cafés, bars, clubs, parties and festivilles as well as thriving noctornal prostitution and casino scenes. 

====Cafés and bars====
The café scene often continues into the early hours, during the week and on weekends. Additionally there are many traditional neighborhood bars some which also have Viennese food. Most popular though, are bars (some with a nominal cover fee) with a dj and small dance floor. These are quite comfortable and there are plenty to meet anyones musical taste, many are open all night.

====Mainstream/Austro-Trash====
Although "mainstream" is hardly a majority of people in Vienna it is still refered to as such. Even here there is quite a bit of variance between places the conservative working class goes out and the conservative upper class tends to go.

* '''Gürtel at Nußdorferstraße''' (U6)  has a few mid-size cheap clubs like '''Loco'''[http://www.locobar.at/] and '''Ride Club'''[http://www.rideclub.at/] around. They all have very cheap booze and cover if you arrive early.

====Alternative====

====LGBT====
Although gay nightlife in Vienna is not concentrated in one area, it's blossoming. It can be difficult to keep up with what's on offer, but luckily Vienna is fairly accepting and you can go out and meet other gay people in most venues. Austria is, however, a very conservative Catholic country, and during the day gay and lesbian couples might get some stares - especially from older people - but at night a younger, less conservative crowd heads out.

* '''Why Not''' [http://www.why-not.at/] is Vienna's main-stream everyday gay disco. The crowd is varied. In the 1st District at Teifergraben 22 (Herrengasse U3). Saturdays are house-music free.

* '''The Circus''' [http://www.circusclub.eu/] is Austria's biggest gay event featuring Circuit House sound.

* '''Ken Club''' [http://kenclub.at/] features Pop music for a younger crowd.

* '''Heaven''' [http://www.heaven.at/] happens at irregular intervals.

* '''Meat Market''' happens regularly at both the Pratersauna and on the Badeschiff (see above). It is more alternative and its the hot major queer party in Vienna these days. The same people put on '''Dem Schönen Frönen''' which is similar but with a focus on minimal, instead of alternative music.

* '''Rosa Lila Villa''' [http://www.villa.at/] is a gay resource center with an excellent a bar and resturant. (Pilgramgasse U4)

* '''The Big Gay Picnic''' [http://www.gaypicnic.org/] is a place for the LGBTQ-community to hang out in summertime.

* '''Gumpendorfer Straße''' in the 6th District has several very gay-friendly bars to meet most any taste, there is one every block or so.

The guide '''GayInVienna''' [http://www.gayinvienna.com/]  covers general infos on Vienna for LGBT travelers (& locals) and the latest news & events from the scene in Vienna, both in German and English.

====Indulgent====
'''Brothels''' are legal in Vienna, as is street prostitution. There are male and female prostitutes, many from Austria's neighboring countries (few from Austria), but also from Africa, Latin America and Asia offering their services. Brothels differ greatly from small to the point one-room operations to hokey grand parlors. There is no true red-light district, but there are many 'bars' located on the 'Gürtel' as well as in the 2nd District, but they can be found everywhere. Street prostitution areas exist but should be avoided due to the low-regulation and high amount of trafficked and unregistered workers. There are plenty of go-go clubs as well though, that are not brothels. Some of these have male and female dancers dancing together and are frequented by men and women together.

'''Casinos''' are plentiful in Vienna. Also a spectrum hole-in-the-wall places with machines to the hokey Eastern-European style with pumping music and strobes on the facade to grand elite places.

==Sleep==
<!--Please do not list hotels/hostels here, place it in the correct [[Vienna#Districts]] -->
''See the [[#Districts|Districts]] articles for more listings.''

Vienna offers a complete range of hotels. Prices are relatively higher than in neighboring countries, or in the neighboring countryside, but quality is also often better.

In '''choosing an accommodation''' it is important to know which part of the city you want to spend time in. Most accommodations claim to be centrally located, which for the Viennese would mean they should be in or next to the 1st District, few actually are. Many are even outside the core districts 2-9. Still, all of them are located within about a 5-minute walk to an underground or at least a rail or tram station, you can get to the center within 20 minutes or less on public transportation from anywhere in the city.

A quick reminder about '''addresses and districts''': the number preceding the street name is the district. So ''9., Badgasse 26'' is Badgasse #26 in the 9th district. These can also be made into a postal code by substituting it the XX: A-1XX0 Vienna (0X for districts below 10), for instance A-1090 Vienna for the 9th district.

'''Smoking''' rooms are relatively common. '''Non-smoking''' rooms are in limited supply, and hotels with non-smoking floors are less common. Senstive non-smokers may be bothered that public areas of the hotel (often the hallway outside your room) are often heavy with tobacco smoke.

There is a New York Times insert in the Monday edition of the local newspaper Der Standard [http://derstandard.at/] which can be found quickly in coffee houses and elsewhere due to its tan color.

==Stay safe==
Vienna is potentially one of the safest cities in the world for its size. There are no slums or districts you should avoid. In general, you can visit any part of the city at any time of the day without taking many risks — just use your common sense. At night, though, it is wise to avoid parks. The drug scene at Karlsplatz (underneath the Opera) hangs out there during the day, but they do not care at all about tourists. Just ignore them and they will ignore you. The Prater (fair grounds/amusement park area) is said by some locals to be less safe at night, though more in reference to pickpockets than anything else.  As in any major city, watch out for '''pickpockets''' who grab and run when boarding the U-Bahn (['uːbaːn] subway). Petty crimes (like jackets 'going missing') are more common and normally go unreported and won't get much sympathy. There have been a very few '''racist assaults''' in Vienna (even some by the police themselves). One runs the risk of being pickpocketed. Schwedenplatz, along the Ring, is sleazy in the evenings, but basically harmless; the Stadtpark, along the Ring, to the East, is a bit deserted at night and therefore best avoided.

'''Prostitution''' in Vienna is legal, if heavily regulated. All “providers of sexual services” must be of age and must register with the city and obtain a medical check-up card (colloquially referred to as “Deckel”, i.e. “lid”) with recurring visits every six weeks.
Even though “soliciting in the street” is technically not illegal, it is forbidden in all residential areas, cemeteries, near all stations of public transportation etc. This covers almost all of Vienna, with the exception of a few streets on the very outskirts of the city in the 21st and 23rd districts. Consequently, most legal prostitution takes place in licensed bordellos and walk-up brothels (“Laufhaus”).
 
Recently, there have been some reports of '''fraud''' around Karlsplatz and the Ring. The usual scenario is that someone will stop you and ask for directions. A couple of other guys show up claiming to be police, showing a badge (must be fake). They ask if you were getting drugs from the other guy and then will ask for your passport and wallet for verification. When you are busy trying to convince them that your passport is valid, one of them sneaks out some money from your wallet. Best to tell them that you want to go to the police station — there is one at Karlsplatz U-Bahnstation. It's a minor annoyance, but it's better to be careful. In a different case of fraud they try to convince you that your money is counterfeit money and that they have to inspect it. As always use common sense: police are ought to approach you in a very distinctive way (you will notice if they do so), the badge must have ''Polizei'' ([ˌpɔlɪˈʦaɪ̯] police) and the Austrian coat of arms  and/or the Austrian flag located somewhere on it, and they will be willing to bring you to the police station or a properly uniformed officer.

Do not walk on the '''bike lanes''' and cross them like you would cross any other road. Some bike lanes are hard to recognize (e.g. on the "Ring" in Vienna) and some cyclists bike rather fast. Walking on bike lines is not only considered impolite but it is illegal and you run the danger of getting hit.

If you see people '''gambling''' on the streets (usually in popular tourists' destinations like Stephenplatz or Mariahilferstrasse), stay away! The modus operandi usually involves a guy playing the classic game of "hiding the ball". This involves covering the ball (or small trinket) with either a bottle cap or a match box and swirling it around with two other bottle caps asking people to guess the position of the ball. The game is set in a way that you can easily see the ball's position. This is done to lure the unsuspecting person into placing a wager. There are usually two main players and, between them, they will lose and win money back and forth to give the appearance that it is a fair game - do not be tricked! They are from the same gang. Once you get greedy and get lured in, you will surely lose your money! The person in control of the bottle caps will remove the ball from their position through sleight of hand and you will never see your money back. Besides the two or three other players involved, there are usually at least two lookouts - one on each side of 'stage'. Vienna has plenty of legal casinos if you care to try your luck.

In addition, it is common for suspicious persons to approach you in the city centers if you are standing still for a while (particularly if eating at outdoor tables). They will be holding magazines for sale, and will ask you if you are interested in looking at one for free. They are typically very aggressive in their demeanor. Do not be fooled by them! It is not free. If you look at the magazine for free, they will refuse to take the magazine back and demand payment for it at a high cost (typically 2 euros, which is the price of local homeless' magazines in Austria like "[http://www.augustin.or.at/ Augustin]", but they are in German anyways and it indeed has become a trend amongst non-related people to abuse the idea). The best response in this situation is, when they first approach, to simply wave your hands demonstratively to say no while shaking your head and repeat the phrase "Nein danke" ([naɪ̯n ˈdaŋkə] no thank you) to them repeatedly until they leave. If police are nearby, these people may accuse you of stealing the magazine, but many police know of their trickery so stand your ground. However, the best response in all cases is simply to dismiss these beggars by saying "Nein danke" and refusing to take the magazine. They will often look for tourists or people who look as though they are visiting hoping to make a sale; therefore, be prepared to tell them "Nein danke" as necessary so that they will leave you alone. They are not violent and just trying to get money from you, so do not be afraid that they will hurt you if you tell them no.

==Get out==

Vienna's metropolitan area is large, and its suburban rail takes you to suburbs so large that they are worth a visit in their own right. All of the following places (except ''Bratislava'', ''Bruck and der Mur'' and Slovenia) are within the metropolitan area and reachable on an all-zone Vienna travelcard (and yes, this also applies to Sopron).

* '''[[Laxenburg]]''', a charming small town less than 20 km from Vienna. Being a former imperial summer residence of the Habsburgs, it is famous for its huge picturesque park and several castles. You can easily reach it by a comfortable local bus (takes 35 minutes from the '''Hauptbahnhof'''). It is an excellent option for a day trip from Vienna.  

* '''[[St. Pölten]]''', the capital of Lower Austria, hosts many sights. One is the Dom zu St. Pölten, a baroque which until 1722 served as a Roman basilica cathedral. The St. Pöltner Rathaus (city hall) and the Pottenbrunn Castle (which can only be seen from the outside) are also worth a visit. St. Pölten is accessible by an hourly suburban rail service from the '''Westbahnhof''' station (''U-Bahn U3'') which takes 80 minutes to St. Pölten ('''passengers for Pottenbrunn Castle should get off at Pottenbrunn, one stop before St. Pölten'''). Total travel time from the city centre is 100 min. As of 2016 there are additional direct connections from Wien - Meidling and Wien - Westbahnhof that take 20 minutes to St. Pölten (for €10 one way).

* '''[[Wiener Neustadt]]''' also has a lot to offer for tourists: the cathedral, renovated in 1975-1999, the castle and the city museum to name a few. The city is best reachable by suburban train from the '''Wien Meidling''' station, and the travel time is about 30 minutes, depending on the train you take. The place is also related to tragic moment in Croatian history, death of Petar Zrinski and Fran Krsko Frankopan which occured 30th of April 1671.

* '''[[Eisenstadt]]''', the capital of Burgenland, hosts several large churches as well as the Esterhály castle which offers a wine cellar, gift shop, guided tours, and concerts in the famous Haydnsaal as well as the large garden on the back. There are two suburban rail connections: the direct service '''Hauptbahnhof''' - Eisenstadt - Wulkaprodersdorf - (Wiener Neustadt) which takes 67 min to Eisenstadt, and the Deutschkreutz-bound service from Hauptbahnhof through Meidling to Wulkaprodersdorf + connecting service on the Hauptbahnhof route (opposite direction, towards Wien) to Eisenstadt, which takes 1 hour from Meidling and is thus slightly faster. However, from the city centre both routes take 80 minutes so you might as well go with the direct service from Hauptbahnhof.

* '''[[Bratislava]]''', the capital of [[Slovakia]], lies 55 km to the east of Vienna and is reachable by two suburban rail routes: one runs to ''Hlavná stanica'' (Bratislava Main Station) via northeastern Vienna and ''Marchegg'', and the other one to station ''Bratislava-Petržalka'' via ''Bruck an der Leitha''. Both journeys take approx. one hour. Both lines originate at the '''Hauptbahnhof''' station. A return ticket costs €15 and is valid for two weeks. Another (slightly more expensive) option is available, which also includes a day ticket for the entire Bratislava public transport, on the first day of the ticket's validity. In the past prices in Bratislava were one-fifth of what they are in Vienna but many things now cost pretty much the same. Drinks in pubs are still considerably cheaper than in Austria, but of course not much so in the touristy restaurants in the Bratislava city centre. A day trip to the Czech Republic of roughly similar travel time (1.5 hours) from Vienna -- a trip to Brno -- is made significantly more costly by very different pricing policies by OBB: a return to Brno (fast and slow trains) costs €56.

* '''[[Brno]]''', a city of around 400,000 people in the [[Czech Republic]] with close historical links with Vienna, is 1.5 hours from Vienna by fast train.

* '''[[Sopron]]''', a historic town in in [[Hungary]] is also reachable by suburban rail: from Wien Hauptbahnhof  the hourly service to Deutschkreutz takes you to Sopron in around 1hr20min.

* '''[[Krems]]''', a smaller and historic town at the entrance of the Wachau valley about 80 km west of Vienna. Reachable by rail from Wien '''Franz-Josefs-Bahnhof''', Wien Spittelau (U4, U6) and Wien Heiligenstadt (U4) with suburban trains to "Krems/Donau". There are hourly connections and the travel time is about one hour. Krems is a relatively small, so you can walk there or rent a bike [http://www.krems.gv.at/system/web/zusatzseite.aspx?menuonr=218454324&detailonr=220288925&bezirkonr=0], [http://www.krems.info].

* '''[[Slovenia]]''', a small, but very beautiful country which offer a lot of touristical attractions (Maribor - European capital of Culture, charming Ljubljana city, Julian Alps, gorges (Tolmin, Vintgar), caves (Postojna), coast (Piran) and amazingly beautiful Bled lake.

* '''[[Bruck an der Mur]]''' is a small city located in the north of [[Styria]]. It is an important international train hub. What is most interesting here is scenic train journey to get there, which takes in the famous [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semmering_railway Semmeringbahn] line, the Europe's first mountain railway built on standard gauge. It is also midway to [[Graz]].
