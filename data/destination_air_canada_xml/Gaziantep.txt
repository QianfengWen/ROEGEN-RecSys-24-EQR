'''Gaziantep''', or informally known as ''Antep'', is a city in Turkey.

==Understand==
Gaziantep, previously and still informally called Antep, is a city in southeast Turkey and among the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. The city is located 185 kilometers (115 mi) northeast of Adana and 97 kilometers (60 mi) north of Aleppo, Syria. It is the sixth most populous city in Turkey. Apart from being renowned for its cuisine, Gaziantep is also an industrial city having the third biggest industry in Turkey, which makes it vulnerable to migration from other cities, especially the East.

==Get in==
===By plane===
'''Gaziantep International Airport'''. Gaziantep has an international airport and direct flights to major cities in Europe, especially in summer. It is also well-connected with daily flights to major cities in Turkey, allowing to reach different destinations easily. It is 15 km from the city center. You can reach the city center from the airport with the Havaş[http://www.havas.com.tr] shuttle service.

===By train===
Passenger trains no longer run to Gaziantep. The railway lines to [[Adana]] for Istanbul and Ankara, to Mosul in Iraq, and to Aleppo in Syria, are all closed indefinitely.

===By bus===
The coach station "otogar" in Gaziantep is one of the most convenient stations in Turkey. It is well-integrated with most of the cities in the West and the East. The local coach companies, "Seç Turizm, Ben Turizm and Çayırağası" provide excellent service with punctual arrivals. As a common Turkish tradition, you might expect 5 to 10 minutes delays on departure, yet the drivers compensate for it on the highway. From Istanbul, it usually takes 15 hours by express overnight buses. From Ankara, it takes 9 hours and from Izmir, it is 16 hours. But don't worry, Turkey has surprisingly perfect motorways and comfortable coaches with beverage offerings that will make your journey safe and relaxed.

==Get around==

The city center is reasonably compact and walkable. There are plenty of local buses if you prefer and of course taxis for tired feet.

==Do==


==Buy==
You can buy a lot of traditional things in Gaziantep. You should try ''Bakırcılar Çarşısı'', a traditional bazaar in the center of the city. You can buy ''baklava'', ''nargile'' (hooka pipe), ''yemeni'' (local leather shoes) and much more. Prices here are much better than at the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul.

As the centre of a large pistachio-growing region, as the groves along the highway leading to Gaziantep indicate, you can find many stores selling this local product (known in Turkish as ''Antep Fıstığı'', i.e. "Pistachio of Antep", an expression which surpassed the former name of ''Şam Fıstığı'', i.e. "Pistachio of [[Damascus]]", used during Ottoman period), both fresh (not very tasty, though) and also in a salty roasted variety (a lot more delicious!).

==Eat==
Antep is known for its cuisine that is heavily influenced by its [[Middle East|southern neighbors]]. The city is renowned for its local variety of kebabs (''Antep kebabı''). You can find many places that sell spicy kebabs here. Make sure you enter a place that is crowded and order ''ayran'' with your kebab. Try a ''lahmacun'', which is minced, marinated, spiced meat with minced vegetables on an extremely thin, crunchy dough. ''Lahmacun'' can be made with garlic or onions, in general, you will find garlic ones in Antep.

Antep is also famous for its pistachios. You can find fresh, unroasted pistachios as well as roasted ones. Try the spicy nuts.

Beyran is a spicy lamb soup with rice served for breakfast.

Katmer is a thin phyllo yufka pastry stuffed with sheep cheese, pistachios, and sugar served for breakfast.

Upon finishing your dinner, make sure to have ''baklava'' made with pistachios. Also, you can try the hot desserts with a scoop of ice cream on top.

Antep is known for its food, and meals there are one of the highlights of visiting the region.  So enjoy yourself.
