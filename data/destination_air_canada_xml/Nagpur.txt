== Get around ==

===By Taxi-Rickshaw===
The best way to get around are the yellow and black 3 wheeled taxicabs known as the Autorickshaws or simply Rickshaws. 
Hollering 'Auto' or 'Rickshaw' at a passing Rickshaw should be enough to catch the drivers attention. In most cases the drivers would be able to understand Hindi and maybe even a few words of English. 
They are normally quite helpful but are known to cheat tourists so bargain hard and it might be a good idea to ask a pedestrian to get an idea about how much it costs normally to reach your destination by auto.
In Nagpur, auto rickshaws don't follow the meter system. They all have them, they are supposed to follow them, but, it will be hard to find an auto with a working meter.

===By Taxi-Cabs===
There are taxis (cabs) available at the Airport and Railway Station. You can also rent a "Qualis", a slang generic term for a SUV-taxi named after the common Toyota Qualis(but now are available as many other brands, such as the Chevy and India's own luxury brand, Mahindra). Normally they are offered with a driver, and they will stay with you all day, week, or even month if you'd like. This chauffeur can normally understand English, and knows the city very well.

Besides, buses are the most common transport facility for the common people in the city and hence they are overcrowded at times. Now Star Bus service started here also. Bus mainly go to Buldi station from there you can conveniently to other places.Frequency of City buses are quite good enough to reach local destinations and suburbs area.
