'''Wichita''' is the largest city in [[Kansas]], in the [[United States of America]].

==Understand==


==Get in==
===By car===
Wichita is located at the junction of Interstates 135 & 35 (Kansas Turnpike)
* Approximately three hour drive from [[Kansas City]] or [[Oklahoma City]].

===By plane===

'''Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport''' ('''ICT''', formerly Wichita Mid-Continent Airport), [http://www.flywichita.com], five miles west of the city's center, serves nine carriers providing service to 11 cities across the country, most of which are major hubs with connecting service to points around the world.

*'''Allegiant Air''', [http://www.allegiantair.com/].  Service to/from [[Las Vegas]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Phoenix]].

===By train===
* '''Amtrak''', [http://www.amtrak.com] doesn't serve the city directly, but its Southwest Chief service  that runs between Chicago and [[Los Angeles]] stops daily in [[Newton (Kansas)|Newton]], a town 25 miles north of the city's center, around 3 in the morning. From Newton, you'll need to rent a car or hire a taxi to get to Wichita, and arrangements are best made in advance for either, particularly given the hour of arrival.

==Get around==
* '''City Bus''', [http://www.wichita.gov/CityOffices/Transit/BusRoutes/].  As the only form of public transit serving the city, bus service may cover the areas near some sights you'd want to see, but not nearly all. Routes are long and the wait for the next bus can stretch to an hour. In general, this is not a good way to get around.
* '''Taxi'''.  Hailable only at the airport, they don't even queue at downtown hotels.  Points of interest are far enough apart that a rental car quickly becomes cost-effective. When taking a taxi from the airport, be sure to negotiate a fare BEFORE you get in. The driver may tell customers to pay more than what is listed on the meter.
* '''Rental Car'''.  If you didn't drive to Wichita, you'll likely want to rent a car when you arrive. 
* '''Navigating Wichita'''.  Wichita is almost exclusively a driving town.  Even so, traffic is generally lighter than most larger cities, and parking is almost always free and plentiful, even downtown. Wichita's streets are laid out in a fairly easy to navigate grid system.
* No trip to Wichita is complete without an excursion through the nearby [[Flint Hills]], and that's only possible in a car (preferably a convertible).
