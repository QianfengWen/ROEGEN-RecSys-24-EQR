'''Nanchang''' (南昌; ''Nánchāng'') is the capital of [[Jiangxi]] Province and is the cultural, economic and scientific center of Jiangxi. 

==Understand==
With deep historical ties, known as ''Heroes' City'' because it was here that the communist uprising of 1 August 1927 began.

==Get in==
Nanchang Airport has regular connections from many Chinese cities.
It has also a few international flights from Singapore, Taipei, Chiang Mai and other Asian cities.
International flights arrive and depart at the small Terminal 1.
Terminal 1 is not a 24hr terminal. It opens at approximately 6.30am, so if you arrive early during winter, be prepared to stand out in the cold for a while. The airport is also not heated during winter time. As of Jan 2019, there are no shops and F&B establishments present in the international terminal.
You go through a luggage scan first before proceeding to the check-in counters. Thereafter, proceed to the customs immigration counters and later, the more thorough security screening stations.

Not all international flights park near the terminals with aerobridge access. Shenzhen Airlines flight from Singapore parks on the tarmac, requiring passengers to descend via stairs to the ground and be transported to the terminals via bus. This is also the case during winter months.

==Get around==
Taxis and buses are the most popular ways of getting around, bus journeys being &yen;1 regardless of distance traveled (&yen;2 for the doubledecker buses). The taxi fare in Nanchang is also cheap compared to other cities in China with same scale and the initial starting price for a ride on taxi is &yen;6 up to 2 kilometers. Beyond this mandatory starting-price-region, the rate is &yen;1.9 per kilometer. It should also be noted that the taxi fare has an additional 20% surcharge in the nocturnal time period between 11:00pm and 5:00am to compensate for the low demand at night. However you will probably find that during peak times both buses/taxis are nearly impossible, at which point either walking or cycling are the only options (there is nowhere to rent bikes in Nanchang).

Metro was opened at December 2015 (Line 1). Number of stations 24 (2015). Length 28.7 km. Line 2 was opened in August 2017, with 28 stations and a length of 31.51km (2019).

If visiting during the summer a bicycle is a good investment, at &yen;110 from WalMart beside Bayi Square. Just like other typical Chinese cities, there are many cycle lanes covering the entire city, busy nearly all the time.

*Understand that Nanchang cuisine (and Jiangxi food in general) can be quite spicy. Some specialties include a clay pot soup called waguan tang (瓦罐汤), one of the few foods that isn't spicy at all, and Nanchang ban fen (南昌拌粉), a local type of fried vermicelli. An excellent place to try a wide variety of local street food is the night food street close to Jiangxi Normal University of Science and Technology (江西科技师范) in Honggutan on Yuping Road (玉屏西大街). Facing away from the school towards KFC, walk one block right.

==Drink==
There seem to be two main areas for drinking.  On the main walking street in the upscale apartment complex there are 3-4 bars and a few clubs, all of which are hopping on the weekends.  Another area is found around fuzhou road, there is VV club, and CD 1925.

Jiangxi Fandian was established in 1961, and although renovated in 2004, feels like it was renovated to 1960's standards. </sleep>

==Stay safe==
Pickpockets are everywhere, especially near Zhongshan Road area. They can steal things even from your shirt pocket! Never leave your belongings unattended in restaurants or shops, even if it is a upper-class one. Apart from that, the city is quite safe.

==Get out==
Nanchang is a good place to start other trips in Jiangxi Province. It has good connections with [[Lushan]], Jingangshan, [[Jingdezhen]], [[Wuyuan]] etc.

Famed [[Lushan]] is about two and a half hour bus ride to the north.
