'''Malatya'''  is one of the biggest cities in the [[Eastern Anatolia]] region of [[Turkey]]. 

==Understand==
Malatya in the ancient names was known as ''Malidiya'', dates back to Hittites, a Bronze Age people of Anatolia. 

In 1838, during a war between Ottoman Empire and the forces of Ibrahim Pasha of [[Egypt]], the Ottoman army seized what was then the town of Malatya, forcing the local population to '''Aspuzu''', then a collection of cottages amidst the orchards in the outskirts of the town. After the war, the people decided not to return to their battered town, settling permanently in Aspuzu, and renaming it to Malatya (the abandoned old town, 10 km north of the current city, has later been re-populated, and is now called [[Battalgazi]], covered in its seperate article).

Today, with its population of more than 400,000 inhabitants, There are some Kurds that live there and Malatya is the largest city of central-eastern Anatolia, where gently rolling steppes of [[Central Anatolia]] give way to heavily-rugged terrain of [[Eastern Anatolia]]. The plateau on which Malatya lies is surrounded by higher mountains, some of which are covered with orchards that produce the '''apricots''', for which the city is famous.

Unlike rest of Eastern Anatolia, much of the urban population speak a non-dialectical standard [[Turkish phrasebook|Turkish]], sometimes with a slight accent.

Local people are generally friendly and helpful.

===Climate===
A semi-arid continental climate reigns in the area. In summers (May onwards), daytimes are sunny and hot, enough to walk around comfortably in just a t-shirt, however, nights and early mornings are cool enough that you will want to pack along a jacket or a sweater.

==Get in==
[[image:merkez01.jpg|thumb|300px|The entrance of the city center]]

===By plane===
'''Malatya Erhaç Airport''' ({{IATA|MLX}}, {{ICAO|LTAT}}) is 30 km away from the city center and can be reached by shuttle buses of the airlines and taxis. Flights leave from [[Istanbul]] and [[Ankara]]. Turkish Airlines ''THY'' [http://www.thy.com.tr], AnadoluJet [http://www.anadolujet.com], Pegasus Airlines [http://www.flypgs.com] and Onur Air [http://www.onurair.com.tr] have daily flights to Malatya.

If bought one month prior to the flight date, a one-way flight between Istanbul and Malatya costs between 114 and 154 TL, depending on the company.

===By train===
Direct trains run daily from [[Ankara]] to Malatya, taking 16 hours. There are couchettes and a sleeping car but no buffet. The main stops along the route are [[Kayseri]] and [[Sivas]]. Twice a week the train continues east via [[Elazig]] to Tatvan (10 hours by the ''Vangölü Express''), with dolmus connections to [[Van]]. Trains the other days (the ''Guney Kurtalan Express'') continue to [[Diyarbakir]] (6 hours) and Kurtalan (9 hours). For details see Turkish railways website at tcdd.gov.tr, but beware that the timetable and the online booking system give different days of running for these services. Note also that Ankara railway station is partially closed for rebuilding until early 2018, with bus replacements to Irmak 60 km east of the city, and altered timings. 

The Firat Express runs daily south to [[Adana]], taking 8 hours via Gölbaşı and Osmaniye, and north to Elazig (3 hours).

Malatya railway station is about 4 km northwest of the town centre, about 200 metres off the intercity highway D300. Look for the small white sign saying ''TCDD Gar'' at the roundabout with a big Carrefour store. Town bus lines #1A and #1B and dolmuses run frequently between the station and the central square.

===By car===

Malatya can easily be reached by car, via [[Kayseri]]-Malatya motorway, which is numbered '''D300'''.

===By bus===
There are many domestic coach firms from [[Istanbul]] bus station. The coaches, reach Malatya via Ankara and the journey takes nearly 15 hours. Beydağı Turizm [http://www.beydagi.com.tr], Aksoğanoğlu Zafer Turizm [http://www.zaferturizm.com.tr], Kernek Turizm [http://www.kernekturizm.com.tr] have at least 5 daily coaches to Malatya within the specific times of the day.

Buses from [[Ankara]], which also shortly call at [[Kayseri]] bus station on the way, take between 9 and 11 hours depending on the service, costing 35 TL on the average. In addition to some of the local companies based in Malatya listed above, nation-wide Metro Turizm [http://www.metroturizm.com.tr/] operates on this line, too. 

Long-haul buses from other major centres in the country, both regional and elsewhere alike, such as [[Bursa]], and [[Van]] also call at and accept passengers for Malatya bus station.

Malatya's '''bus station''' (''otogar'') lies at the western outskirts of the city, on the highway from [[Kayseri]] and way out of city centre. Luckily, quite frequent public buses, which call at the stops on the highway in front of the station (cross the street for eastbound buses, i.e., those heading for the city), connect it with the city centre (although not all of the buses calling at that stop make it to the city centre—some proceed to the suburbs on the other side of the city via the intercity highway). The earliest public bus services start around 6AM.

The name of the bus stop in front of the ''otogar'' (as well as the administration of the station itself) is ''Maşti'', so look for that in bus signs when getting from elsewhere in the city.

The bus station has an official tourism information office, an internet cafe open 24-hr, toilettes (which cost 0.75 TL), as well as benches which might offer a quite uncomfortable sleep if you arrive in the middle of the night. The place is calm and safe through the night with a visible presence of security officers.

==Get around==
The city has a wide number of '''public buses''', some fairly modern and some quite old, easily recognizable by their flashy yellow colour and big ''Malatya Belediyesi'' ("Malatya City Council") banners on the sides. However, not every of them heads into downtown, some ply up and down the intercity highway (which is named ''Çevreyolu'' on the maps and such, literally "ring road", however it's a wide avenue through the residential neighbourhoods of the city rather than a motorway surrounding the city nowadays), which lie a few blocks north of the main street of city centre. The bus stops at the central square are called ''Valilik'' or ''Vilayet'' (both means "Governer's Office", and it seems there is no fixed standard for it—it's possible to see both words on bus signs), so make sure you catch one heading for there when you want to make it right to the downtown. A ride, regardless of the distance or the direction, costs 1.25 TL.

Once in the center, everywhere is easily accessible by foot as the city lies on a fairly flat ground, except for southern neighbourhoods leaning against a steep hillside, which an average traveller takes little, if any, interest anyway.

==See==
* <see name="New Mosque" alt="Yeni Cami" address="" directions="at the central square" phone="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="Free">A beautiful mosque built in 1912, and perhaps the only one in Turkey featuring three minarets. The one on the side—top of which was demolished long ago—was perhaps the minaret of an older mosque on site.</see>
* Just across the street from the New Mosque at the front yard of Governer's Office is the last standing '''statue of İsmet İnönü''', a native of the city and the second president of Turkey (in office 1938-1950), who was later blamed for instituting a cult of personality for himself after the death of Turkish Republic's founder, Kemal Atatürk.

From the central square, a stroll of 800 metres along the Fuzuli Caddesi (Street) will bring you to '''Kernek Square''' (''Kernek Meydanı'').

* <see name="Waterfalls Park" alt="Şelale Parkı" address="Kernek Meydanı" directions="" phone="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="Free">A park on the side of a hill with lots of water features. A man-made waterfall running through a concrete canal and getting stronger at each upper cascade is the main attraction. The park surrounds a small hydropower plant harnessing the power of the waterfall—which, actually why the waterfall exists in the first place—although the plant is not open for visits. Some open-air cafes line the cascading water canal.</see>

The waters of the waterfalls park keep runing along a canal spanned by pleasant foot bridges in the leafy median strip of Hamit Feritoğlu Caddesi, unofficially known as ''Kanalboyu'' (literally "along the canal"). A stroll of about 500 metres along the ''Kanalboyu'' will bring you to another square.

*On the side of the square is '''Hürriyet Park''', the largest in the city.
*At the side of the entrance of the park is '''a statue of Kemal Atatürk''', complete with his cloak, next to a guy, presumably symbolizing Turkish youth, who is wearing nothing but a fig leaf.

Heading back to northwest from here along Kışla Caddesi—which has a beautifully landscaped wide median strip, which includes benches and palm trees (yes, palm trees. Like those that are found in tropical paradises. All thanks to legendary cold hardiness of ''Trachycarpus fortunei'' species)—you will arrive back at the central square; drawing a triangle in the city. However, there are a few more sights on the way, which might slow down your pace a bit.

* <see name="Atatürk Museum" alt="Atatürk Evi Müzesi" address="Kışla Caddesi" directions="very close to Hürriyet Park" phone="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="Tu-Su 9AM-noon 1PM-5PM" price="">The historic mansion in which Kemal Atatürk stayed during his visits to the city.</see> 
* There are also a number of other '''historic stone buildings''' along the Kışla Caddesi from the late Ottoman or early Republic eras, which look quite stately and impressive.
* At yet another square on your way, there is an old-looking '''clock tower''', which actually was built recently but is nice anyway.

===Outer neighbourhoods===
*There is a '''large park''' east of the city, on the highway to [[Elazig|Elazığ]] with a large pond and distant views of the [[Battalgazi#Get out|Karakaya Dam lake]]. Minibuses and public buses heading for ''Üniversite'' pass by the entrance of it.
*Northwest of the city centre (on Boztepe Caddesi a block north of intercity highway-''çevreyolu''), there is a ruined '''Armenian church''' that is...well, ruined. Only its outer walls are standing and the neighbourhood in which it stands seems to be a somewhat rough one, so a distant look from the highway might suffice unless you have a special interest in the Armenian heritage of the region.

==Do==
* Visit during the '''Malatya International Arts and Apricot Festival''' in July.

* Go to '''Malatya Park AVM''' (shopping mall), the largest mall in eastern Turkey. An '''ice skating''' rink and a '''movie theater''' with subtitled films are also available there.
*<do name="Aslantepe" alt="" address="Aslantepe Mah., Orduzu, Malatya Merkez, Malatya" directions="Located on the North East periphery of Malatya it is a short 10 minute taxi ride from the city centre that should cost about 20TL each way.  It is worthwhile asking your driver to stay or to come back within an hour as other transport options are limited." phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="">A partially excavated ancient mound, Aslantepe contains ruins dating from 5000BC onwards - although ancient Anatolian buildings and the newer Hittite walls are the core of the site. The site is effectively an open air museum, with much of it under partial cover.   Remains of truly ancient artwork can be seen on a few walls.

As of June 2013 there is no entrance fee, although tipping the friendly and helpful site guard when you are finished gives you the chance of sharing some fresh tea (cay) with him while you wait for your taxi.

As the site is the focus of long and ongoing work by Italian universities there is excellent signage in Turkish, Italian and English that clearly explains what you are seeing and Aslantepe's story in a logical fashion.

A small and self contained site it only takes 30 - 45 minutes to see it properly. An extremely well presented site, it is well worth your while if you want to see some physical history during your time in Malatya.</do>

==Work==

==Buy==
Malatya's most famous product is apricots as well as other dried fruits and nuts. You can find them for sale in small shops all over the city center. The place with the most variety of dried apricots and apricot sweets is in the newly rebuilt bazaar which is located in between the New Mosque (Yeni Cami) and the main high way (Cevre yol). You can buy nice little arrangements of dried apricots and nuts for around 5 to 6 TL. These arrangement make a great souvenirs but be careful they are addicting and eating too many apricot products can cause digestive problems.

==Eat==
The city is known for huge '''apricot''' orchards of the surrounding countryside, and it's possible to sample a number of local products based on apricot, from the usual dried apricots to highly unique shish kebabs with grilled apricots.
