{{pagebanner|Jinan Banner.jpg}}


'''Jinan''' (济南 ''Jǐnán'') is the provincial capital of [[Shandong]] in the [[People's Republic of China]]. It is located in the North-West of the province. In the South the city is flanked by the hills of The [[Tai'an]] massif, while the [[Along the Yellow river|Yellow River]] passes North of the city.

Jinan carries the nickname '''City of Springs''' (泉城 ''quánchéng'') because of the many artesian wells that bubble up within the city limits. The water from these springs flows North towards the main landmark, Daming Lake (大明湖 ''dàmíng hú''), and onwards to the Yellow River.

While it doesn't always make the short list of tourists visiting China, there is certainly enough to be done in Jinan to warrant a couple of days stay. You can visit the best parks and springs in a day trip from [[Beijing]]. It is also a perfect base for exploring the region, notably [[Qufu]], the hometown of Confucius, and [[Mount Tai]], the foremost of the sacred [[Five Great Mountains]] known in Taoism.

===History===
The Yellow River basin was China's cultural centre during the Neolithic period, and so it comes as no surprise that the area around present day Jinan has been inhabited for over 4,000 years. The oldest finds in the region are from the Longshan culture, a Late Neolithic culture noted for its advanced black 'egg-shell pottery', sometimes as thin as a millimetre.  

Fast forward past the Shang and Zhou dynasty. After the fall of the Zhou dynasty many independent states arose during a time known as the Spring and Autumn period. Eventually only a handful remained, striving for power during the Warring States period. During this era Jinan lay on the border of the state of Qi and the state of Lu. The great wall of Qi, to the East of Jinan, is a remnant of this age. It is the oldest Great Wall in China, and portions are accessible as open air museum. Lu (鲁） on the other hand was the home state of Confucius, and the character is still used as abbreviation for Shandong.

It was during the Han dynasty that Jinan became an important economic and cultural hub, and its role only became more prominent during the following dynasties. Some well known poets, painters and even a Han dynasty ruler all called Jinan their home.

Two events which both connected Jinan to the outside world in a new way spurred development and brought Jinan firmly into the modern age. The first was a natural evolution. In 1852 the Yellow River shifted it course, moving to the bedding of the Ji river from which Jinan derives its name. The Yellow River, being connected to the Grand Canal, now connected Jinan both to the Imperial capital in the North, and to agricultural areas in the South.

By the end of the 19th century the Germany Empire had established a concession in Qingdao on the Shandong coast, and a similar German area was built in what is now the area around the train station. The Germans built a railway connecting Jinan and Qingdao, this however was met with strong local resistance, which eventually led to the anti-foreign Boxer Rebellion. Despite all this the railway was opened for traffic in 1904, opening up Jinan to foreign trade.

===Climate===
Jinan is located in the North China Plain and has a temperate climate.

The heat and moisture can be crushing in the summer when the breeze doesn't get down in the basin. Infamously hot and humid in summer.

The Air quality is getting better now but still severe. Please try to avoid the hazy days.

==Get in==
Jinan is the hub of traffic for the region and province so you'll likely end up here if heading elsewhere in Shandong, notably [[Qingdao]] and [[Yantai]]. Most people will arrive by bus or train.

===By plane===
You can fly to Jinan, but the airport (济南遥墙国际机场) is located 40km northeast of downtown.  A taxi will take an hour and cost about &yen;100 (foreigners might be asked to pay a higher fixed price or be taken on a detour).   There is a shuttle bus between the airport and Jinan's Central Railway Station that runs hourly from 06:00 to 18:00. There is also a shuttle bus between the airport and Jinan's downtown area (with its final stop being the Simpson Hotel) which also runs after 18:00. Both shuttle buses each cost ¥20. A subroute of bus 16 also goes to the airport.

You can find flights from most major cities with Shandong Airlines [http://www.shandongair.com/] being the major carrier.  (Shandong Airlines code-shares with Air China, so your ticket and check-in may well say Air China.)

===By train===
For the train, you will likely arrive at '''Jinan''' train station （济南站） in the centre of the city. You will also probably arrive at Jinan East, about 15km from the downtown, or Jinan West, about 20km further away.

Jinan is on the major line from [[Shanghai]] to [[Beijing]] so you can take the train. With the new China High Speed Rail train that runs from Beijing to Shanghai and stops in Jinan, the trip from Beijing to Jinan takes about 1.5 hours and the trip from Shanghai to Jinan takes approx. 3.5 hours. The CRH train stops at the '''Jinan West''' train station （济南西站） all the way on the western outskirts of the city. A taxi ride from there to center of city will take you over 30 minutes and there are also various bus routes which will take longer. 

Other fast trains from Beijing go to '''Jinan''' main station. There's plenty of transport choices outside: bus 83 stops nearby to take you downtown to more options, K51 takes you to Quancheng Square and Thousand Buddha Mountain.

In 2018, '''Jinan East''' train station （济南东站） opened. The trip from [[Qingdao]] to Jinan takes only about 2 hours.

Using a slow train it's about five hours from Beijing and nine from [[Shanghai]], but the tickets are much cheaper. 

Several travel agencies around the city sell train tickets for an additional &yen;5.

===By bus===
It is very easy to get to Jinan with lots of buses running all day and some at night. Be sure to ask which station the bus will arrive in as there are two main ones, the long distance bus station (长途汽车站) and the train station bus station (客运汽车站).

===By car===
Several expressways (G2, G20, G35) connect to Jinan.

==Get around==
[[Image:Jinan De BRT.jpeg|thumb|200px|A BRT (bus rapid transit) station]]
First thing you have to consider is, do you really need to take the bus? Taxis are the easiest options.  Other options are various motorcycles, and other vehicles that are either unsigned or a bit flimsy-looking.  These are hard to use as you have to negotiate not only the destination, but also the fare.

===By bus===
Buses are often overcrowded.  Still, if you are interested in traveling as the locals do, hop on.

Buses are &yen;1, or &yen;2 for air-conditioned.  Buses that begin with K are supposedly air-conditioned and even if the a/c is off or not working, you are likely to get a seat on these buses as they are much less crowded than the &yen;1 (no a/c) buses. It should be noted though, that a line either is a K-line or not, same lines don't have K buses and non K buses operating on them, so mostly it is not possible to prefer either type without some walking being involved.

Most busses with two digits serve the central city. Three digit ones are either coming from or going to the suburbs. Bus stops are easily identifiable and bus numbers are written in the Western numbers both on the busses and at the bus stops. The lists of stops for a given route are posted at every bus stop, but in Chinese only, although the beginning and end stations are written in pinyin.

===By taxi===
Taxis drivers rarely speak English, and they will often not be able to read maps or your destination in letters.  So to be certain to reach your destination, make sure you have it written out in Chinese.  Price for shorter trips from &yen;7.50.  It can be difficult to get a taxi between 07:30-08:30 and 17:00-19:00.

You can also call a taxi on the taxi hailing app "Didi" (滴滴出行).

===By metro===
Line 1 (济南地铁一号线) runs north-south in the western part of the city linked to Jinan West Railway Station.  Unless you plan to go to the University town in Changqing (长清) or Fangte amusement park （方特东方神话主题乐园）, metro is totally useless during the trip.  Line 2 and Line 3 is under construction now. 

===By bicycle===
The bicycle-sharing system (共享单车) is very developed in Jinan.  You can easily find a red bicycle (mobike) through Wechat app or a blue bicycle (hellobike) by using Alipay app.  Don't forget to lock the bicycle after riding it.

===Clothes===
For clothes make your way over to Shanshi East Road (山师东路 ''shānshī dōng lù''). There you will find a handful of adjoining buildings each full with tiny stores, and tiny aisles between them. It might be hard to find something here to satisfy a western taste, but at least you pay Chinese prices.

For much more upmarket shopping experience head over to a newly developed area called '''Parc 66 (恒隆广场, Hang Lung Plaza)''', sitting on the Quancheng Road(泉城路). This shopping mall is the biggest and best shopping all in the Jinan. 

You can also find some local styled clothes in Quanlefang (泉乐坊) on the Xianxi Xiang( 县西巷) locates on the east of Hundred Flower Pool. Spread over three levels with streaming water and elevated walkways, this open air shopping complex provides a great afternoon strolling opportunity. Note that prices are what you would pay in Europe, so don't come here looking for a bargain. But window shoppers might be happy to know there is also some delicious food to be had, Italian ice cream, chocolate cake, a Chinese renowned tattooist (does not speak English) and even a reasonably priced Japanese restaurant.

On sale are all kinds of items, pottery, wooden sculptures, painting, calligraphy supplies, even old coins, notes and stamps. During the week it's usually pretty quiet, so come during weekends, when much more is on offer. This is a great place to find small souvenirs. Some of it is said to be real antique, but don't be fooled in spending top dollar. Unless you bring, or consider yourself, an expert.
When you get tired of shopping head to nearby Hero mountain for a change of scenery.

Shandong cuisine is known as Lu cai (named after the ancient Lu State) and is one of the eight culinary traditions of China and a major influence on the present day food in northeastern China.  Jinan cuisine represents a branch of Shandong cuisine famous for its soups.  

There are the usual mediocre international fast food chains, plenty of street food, scores of little restaurants, etc.  The easiest is either street food or one of the many buffets where you can see the food and order that way. Or if you want expensive and exotic (eg Japanese, go to the 4-5 star hotels).  There are some nice local restaurants, but if you can't read Chinese it is not worth the hassle and the free entertainment you provide to onlookers. Each restaurant seems to specialise in a style of cooking and a special dish or two. However, finding what you might like can be quite a challenge, as many restaurants don't have menus with pictures, and next to none have English menus. Some of the smaller places have a part of their menu printed into a large poster on the wall, with photos, and provides an easy way to get something you want.
