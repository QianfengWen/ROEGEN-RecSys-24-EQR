'''Toulouse''' [https://www.toulouse-visit.com] is a city in southwestern [[France]], near the Pyrenees, in the [[Midi-Pyrenees]] region, halfway between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. Toulouse is the fourth largest city in France, after Paris, Marseille, and Lyon, and is renowned as a city of rugby and violets.

==Understand==

[[Image:Toulouse.JPG|thumb|Hotel Dieu Saint-Jacques on [[Garonne]] in Toulouse]]

Toulouse has become a center of aviation and spaceflight in the past 20 years. More than 35,000 of the inner city's 400,000 citizens work in the civil aviation or space industries; Airbus Group (formerly EADS) is the largest employer in the region. The city has remained relatively unchanged despite the economic boom.

The city, on the '''Garonne''' river, is on the site of an ancient Roman settlement; even today many of the smaller streets follow their Roman counterparts and many of the red brick buildings are of a pseudo-Roman style. These buildings are also what gives Toulouse its nickname '''La ville rose''' (The pink city).

In the middle ages, Toulouse was one of the richest cities in France due to the sale of blue coloring (pastel) extracted from woad plants. This monopoly was only broken when the Portuguese began to import Indigo to [[Europe]]. Over 50 '''hotels''', mansions, remain witness to the past wealth.

The tourism information office, '''Toulouse Tourist Office''' [http://www.toulouse-tourisme.com], is on the backside of the Capitolium.

==Get in==
===By plane===
Regular scheduled domestic and international flights arrive at '''Blagnac airport''' [http://www.toulouse.aeroport.fr/], 11 km west of downtown Toulouse. Air France operates flights to/from [[Paris]] flight time of approximately 30 minutes, which are usually priced around €50 each way if booked in advance. There are also many flights to major European cities such as [[London]], [[Munich]], [[Frankfurt]] and [[Madrid]].

To get to the city from the airport, you can take the "Shuttle Bus" [http://www.toulouse.aeroport.fr/airport/access-transport-car-park/access/public-transportation/navette-city-centre] for €8 one way or €15 return (price as of Mar 16) to either the main bus/train station or the Jean Jaures or Jeanne D'Arc metro stations in the city center. The journey takes 20-30 minutes and the bus operates every 20 minutes. The ticket is also valid for transfers onto other public city buses within 90 minutes of validation. Tickets can be purchased from the desk in the airport or the driver. Option two is to take tram line T2 right outside the airport, then change to Metro red line A at Arenes station. This costs €1.80 (price as of July 2023), only one ticket is required as the ticket is valid within 1 hour from the first validation. This journey takes approximately 35-40 minutes and may take slightly longer on the weekend as there are fewer trams. You can buy the ticket from the ticket machine, or in the ticket office at the airport tram station. Another option is to take bus 30 to the Andromede-Lycee metro station and the tram from there, but this bus only operates sporadically. A taxi to the center should cost €20-25.

Sea-Lifts [http://www.sea-lifts.com/Airports/Toulouse-Airport.aspx] operates transfers from the airport to the beach and ski resorts as well as other, further out, destinations.

The departure/arrival hall for your flight can be found by searching for the flight number at the flight timetable: [http://www.toulouse.aeroport.fr/en/vols/recherche].

It is sometimes cheaper to fly to [[Beziers]] or [[Carcassonne]] and then take the train to Toulouse, rather than flying directly to Toulouse - however, Ryanair flies to all three of these airports.

EasyJet [http://www.easyjet.com/en/routemap] offers cheap direct flights from the UK, (Bristol and London Gatwick). Also from 8 French, and 8 other European Airports.

===By train===
'''SNCF''' [http://www.voyages-sncf.com/] is the national intercity train operator in France. Cheap tickets can be purchased via '''iDTGV''' [http://www.idtgv.fr], which offers tickets from [[Paris]] starting from €18. Trains to Paris take 5-7.5 hours, trains to [[Bordeaux]] take 2 hours, and trains to [[Marseille]] take 4 hours.

The train station in Toulouse is centrally located.

====To/from [[Barcelona]] and [[Andorra]]====

Toulouse is one end of the train line through the Pyrenees (TER Midi-Pyrénées line 22). This line passes through [[Ariège]], and most trains end at the capital '''Foix'''. However, 6 trains a day continue from Toulouse and Foix on to Andorre-L'Hospitalet (the closest train station to [[Andorra]]) and Latour-de-Carol, at which you can change trains towards [[Barcelona]]. The train to Andorre-L'Hospitalet takes 3 hours, 30 minutes, and the full journey to Barcelona takes about 7 hours (including the change at Latour-de-Carol) and costs €30. 

The schedule for the French train is on the [http://www.trains-touristiques.sncf.com/region.asp?menu=3&train=transpyreneen&lang=en Touristic Routes section of the SNCF website], while the Spanish schedule can be found by looking on the [http://www.rodalies.cat Rodalies de Catalunya] page. The Catalan name of Latour-de-Carol is ''La Tor de Querol'' as listed on the Rodalies webpage.

===By car===
Major highways towards [[Paris]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Marseille]], [[Barcelona]]

Carsharing is pretty popular and most Toulouse residents do it as train fares are expensive and bus routes are almost nonexistent. Bla Bla Car is an online service that connects drivers and passengers. Easy to book last-minute trips too! [[http://www.blablacar.com/]]

===By bus===
Bus and metro terminal at the railway station.

Megabus now runs ultra-cheap bus rides with stops at Barcelona, Paris, and London. Also, they have routes to Amsterdam and other cities. Fares to any destination start from 1€ plus 50 cent reservation fee if you book well in advance.[http://uk.megabus.com/]

Bus services to Spain, Belgium, Italy, and Portugal can be made through Alsa bus departing from the main bus station in Toulouse. [http://www.alsa.es/portal/site/Alsa/?portal.alsa.request.locale=en_GB]

==Get around==

Toulouse is a big city, but the historical center (downtown) is quite small, so you can walk to most destinations in the inner city quite comfortably. This is definitely the best way to explore the city. 

===By bus, tramway or metro===

'''Tisseo''' [http://www.tisseo.fr/] operates a network of bus, tramway, and metro lines throughout the city. The website features an online route planner as well as maps and schedules. Bus tickets can be bought from the bus drivers for €2.00 or from machines for €1.80. Note that most bus lines stop operating at 22:00, but some of the most popular lines operate until 01:00. When purchasing tramway tickets at vending machines, which are conveniently located at every tramway stop, keep in mind that ticket dispensers might not always accept non-French credit cards, so have enough coins to hand just in case (banknotes aren't accepted either, and change is hardly available even at the central metro stations). A one-day ticket costs €6.60 and a three-day one €13.30 but you may not need these as distances in the center are relatively short.

A free electric shuttle bus circles the historic center of the city throughout the day on all days except Sunday. These buses are usually red and white and don't have set stops, so if you see one, flag it down. They are known as the Navette Centre Ville Gratuite.

The metro is relatively small, there are two lines, one going east-west (line A), and the other going north-south (B), but is modern and easy-to-use. The metro operates from 05:00 until midnight (3:00 on Friday and Saturday nights).

===By car===

You should avoid going downtown in a car, as parking spaces are limited. One good option is to drive to a metro station just outside of the center and park there, then head downtown by metro.

===By bicycle===

Rent a bike from any one of the 253 VeloToulouse [http://www.velo.toulouse.fr/] bike stations. After paying €1.20 by credit card, you can use the bikes as many times as you like during the day, but if you do not return the bike to a station within 30 minutes, you will be charged extra, but charges are not high. A €150 hold on credit cards is taken but only charged if the bike is not returned.

The tourist office provides maps of cycle lanes (carte des itinéraires cyclables) and cycle tours of the city. The map of cycle lanes is also available from a number of local administrative offices known as mairies [http://www.toulouse.fr/web/la-mairie/-/les-coordonnees-des-mairies-de-quartier?redirect=%2Fweb%2Fla-mairie%2Fparticipation-citoyennete%2Fmairies-de-quartier].

===By taxi===

Capitole Taxi [http://www.capitole-taxi.com/] is the only licensed taxi operator and it often has poor service.  If you want to get back to your hotel after the buses have stopped, you need to pre-book a taxi or be prepared for a wait which could be over an hour.

For more information about taxis in France, see the main [[France#By taxi|France]] article.

==See==
Toulouse has a small center, and you can reach the most interesting places in the downtown area comfortably on foot.

*'''Basilique Saint Sernin''' - a church from the 11th Century, partly restored by the famous french architect Viollet-le-Duc.

*'''Hôtel d'Assézat''' - one of the most appealing of the many old mansions of the city. It houses the art collection of the Bemberg Foundation.

*'''Capitole''' - the imposing and palatial town hall and theater, its beautiful facade facing onto the grand Place du Capitole

*'''Pont-Neuf''' - despite its name(like the Parisian bridge of the same name, its title is most probably derived from the French for 'New', not 'Nine'.), the only old bridge across the Garonne river; built between 1544 and 1626

*'''Le Couvent des Jacobins''', place des Jacobins, 10h00-18h00, cloister free for students, 3€ otherwise. The convent and the church were built in the 13th century to fight against local "cathare" heresy along the crusade led by French nobles that took place at the same time. The church part is very interesting as its beautiful and typical paintings have been preserved, and contains Thomas Aquinas' relics. You will see an unusual and very high "palm tree" shaped column sustaining the roof, proof of the old European mastery of building techniques. Near the small cabin on the left of the church, you can find a hidden wooden door that will lead you to the cloister of the convent. Made of red bricks and marble, it is a great haven of tranquility and beauty, with the nice advantage of being cool during summer. This is the perfect place to go if you want to read a book, or just relax away from the city center's activity.
*'''City park''' at the Grand Rond, a bit south-east to the center of the city

*'''Les Augustins''' Used to be a monastery church, and is today an art museum. Admission is €5 for an interesting collection of art and an attractive cloister where there are also a dozen or so deckchairs if sightseeing has become too exhausting.

*'''Les Abattoirs''' Modern Arts museum, and there is also a nice garden with a nice view of the Garonne

*'''Georges Labit Museum''' Asian arts and Egyptian antiquities museum in an exotic and Mediterranean garden built in 1893, 17 rue du Japon

*<see name="Canal du Midi" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="">The Canal du Midi or Canal des Deux Mers is a 240 km long canal in the south of France, le Midi. The canal connects the Garonne River to the Étang de Thau on the Mediterranean. The Canal du Midi is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. You can walk or cycle along its banks but in the city, there are also major roads on both sides. Things become quieter south of Port St-Sauveur (where many of the canal boat moor).</see>

===Airbus===
'''Airbus''' offers tours of their facilities in French and English. The tour takes about 90 minutes and includes a bus ride with a guide who will tell you some background about the company, the screening of a promotional/historical video, and a look at the A350 production line.  Photography is strictly forbidden, and you need to bring a piece of photo identification (passport in most cases). You need to book well in advance, especially for an English-speaking tour, taking note that it is CLOSED ON SUNDAYS. To get there by public transport, take the tram to Andromede Lycee, then walk west for about 15 minutes (you can see the Airbus buildings in the distance).  The whole trip takes about an hour, so the tour is probably only worthwhile for real aviation enthusiasts.  

Visit the website of '''Airbus Visit''' [http://www.taxiway.fr/], the only company authorized by Airbus to provide tours of the A340, A380, and Concorde.

===Cité de l'Espace===
'''The "space city"''' [https://en.cite-espace.com] is another of Toulouse's "aviation" attractions. However, you must be aware that it is not exactly a museum but a sort of scientific theme park without rides. There are some replicas of spacecraft and other exhibits, many of the latter interactive in some minor way. There's also a small planetarium. The park is suited well to 5-14-year-old children, everybody else should probably spare themselves the trip. It's situated fairly far outside the city but there's a bus service starting outside the Jolimont metro station. 
*'''By Public Transport''' (Bus):
Take bus route no. 37 from the Jolimont metro station going to La Plaine. Ask for the Cité de l'espace bus stop.

*'''Admission Fees''': For Adults : €18.5, for Children: €12.

{{style}}
* <do name="Peniche Baladine Boat Tours" alt="" address="" directions="Boats depart from Daurade, near the Capitole" phone="" email="" fax="" url="http://www.bateaux-toulousains.fr/" hours="" price="€8 for a 70 minute cruise">Take a boat trip down the Garonne River and/or through the canals leading to the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean.</do>

*'''Walk''' through the '''city''' and along the '''Canal du Midi''' or along the '''Garonne river''' from '''St Pierre bridge''' and '''Pont-neuf''' during the evening. Since no bombs fell on the city center during the war, the '''architectural heritage''' is astonishingly large and well preserved, so walking around can be a very good experience of a typical European town for foreign tourists.

*'''Party''' at St Pierre Place: very popular among Toulouse's students

*'''See a Rugby Match'''. If you are fortunate enough to be in Toulouse on match day, follow the crowds and the excitement to the stadium and soak up the atmosphere while watching one of Europe's top Rugby Union teams, Stade Toulousain.

===The Toulouse Alternative Arts Scene===

Websites are in French

*Toulouse is one of the most alternative French cities - may be due to its huge student population and its historical past, with half a million Spanish republican/communist/anarchist civilians, soldiers, and fighters who escaped Spain through the Pyrenees during the 'Retirada' in 1939 following the Spanish Civil War. So even though the city is trying to get rid of them, it still offers a large number of squats, some of them hosting artistic movements. '''MixArt Myrys''' [http://www.mixart-myrys.org/] is one of the oldest and most active squats of artists within the city.

*'''La Dynamo''' [http://www.facebook.com/people/La-Dynamo-Toulouse/100001431842032] is a club located in a former sex club and a great place to see live bands and other performances - ça bouge! Located in the city centre at 6 rue Amélie (Metro Jean Jaurès). 

*'''Les Motivées''' [http://www.motive-e-s.org/le_site/accueil.php3] is an association that is very active on the political and social scene in Toulouse, and that organizes or takes part in many free events, strikes, concerts, etc. throughout the year. They founded a political party a few years ago that is pretty active locally and holds a few positions with the City Hall Council. Check also the '''Tactikollectif''' [http://www.tactikollectif.org/] their fellow co-working association on events like festivals, etc. that has its origin in the Northern quarters of Toulouse, which are the ones with social housing and lower quality of life.

*'''La Grainerie''' [http://www.la-grainerie.net/] is more particularly dedicated to circus and was first created and settled on derelict brown land; it hosts various collectives of artists every year.

*'''L'Usine''' [http://www.lusine.net/] is another residence for artists and collectives, located in the close suburb (Tournefeuille, 12kms from the City center of Toulouse]

*'''le Collectif d'Urgence Acteurs Culturels - Emergency Collective for Cultural Actors''' [http://www.couac.org/] defends the local associative and alternative cultural world, whereas '''the Toulouse Réseau Unitaire Citoyen - Civil Unitarian Network of Toulouse''' [http://www.truc.abri.org/] aims at stirring local, social and political debates.

===Clubbing===
Toulouse and its neighborhood offer a big choice of techno and electronic music festivals. You can check them in [[Music Festival Circuit]], France section.

==Learn==

*Toulouse has major universities and lots of engineering or management schools. In France, public universities are almost free, and yearly fees amount to around 600€, health assurance included, whereas private schools charge around 5000€. Most of the teaching is done in French, but some Masters are taught in English. Among them:

*'''Toulouse School of Economics''' 21 Allée de Brienne, +33(0)561633690 . Part of Toulouse 1 - Capitole public university, TSE focuses on Economics and Econometrics. Starting after high school, Licence (first 3 years) is taught in French while Masters (last 2 years) are fully taught in English. Hosts many world-famous researchers in Economics, and hires around 20 PhD students each year, although you have to study there for the last year of the master's in order to be eligible for the PhD program.

*It has the second largest student population in France: 120,000, so most of the facilities here are adapted to this population, and you can have a nice quality of life while living on a tight budget. For a small studio in the city center, expect to pay around 350-450€ (State subsidies available, around 150€ for foreigners, more for locals), and food will cost you 200€/month if you eat and cook fresh and quality vegetables along with a reasonable amount of meat (which can be quite expensive if you want something better than supermarket low-quality proteins). Internet and mobile plan comes at 20€/month each (unlimited access), electricity shouldn't cost you more than 30€/month heating included, and water's usually already paid by the landlord, and 25cl beer is 2€50 on average in bars, coffee is 1€50. 

Of course, if you do not have much money available, you can save on the internet (available in universities), phone (mobile plan starts at 2€ for 2h-text unlimited, or take a 20€ plan if you have a recent 3G smartphone and share an internet connection with your computer), food (eat at the university's restaurant for 3.2€), rent (live outside the city center, find a roommate - large flats are cheaper), drinks (do it at home).

==Work==
Anglophone travelers might find employment in the Aviation industry; however, even here French is commonly used. Also, with the current heightened security concerns, extensive screening is required for new employees, so these jobs are not suited for short-term work.

==Buy==
Opening hours in Toulouse are generally Mon-Sat 9AM-1PM and 3PM-7PM, but there are numerous exceptions.

*'''Marché Victor Hugo''', place Victor Hugo, Tue-Sun, 7h00-13h30. For those fond of Southwest French cuisine, a must-go is the Victor Hugo market where you will find a typical European market atmosphere and a large choice of high-quality products for a reasonable price.

*'''Flea Markets''' are quite common in Toulouse and part of the local culture. You will find a "general" one every Sunday morning around the Basilique St. Sernin, one on the place St. Etienne every Saturday (books), and one on the place St. Cyprien every Monday (books and second-hand vinyl and CDs).

* Also a very nice '''organic farmers market''' around the St. Aubin Basilica every Sunday morning, selling organic producers' vegetables and fruits. Very relaxed atmosphere.

* Every weekday there is a '''vegetable market''' before noon along with the Boulevard de Strasbourg - this is actually the cheapest of all the vegetable and fruit markets of the city.

* There are excellent '''second-hand shops''' or "fripperies" in the Esquirol neighborhood between the Capitole and the 'Ecole des Beaux Arts', around the 'place de la Bourse' which is the historical textile production quarter of Toulouse.

* Near the Capitole along the Gambetta and the adjacent streets, you will find many '''bookstores''', the biggest one, "Ombres Blanches," having a very broad choice of books in French and also in foreign languages. You will also find many '''comic books''' ("bandes dessinées," which are different from the American type) stores, or very specialized ones selling thrillers, cinema-focused, musical sheets, collectible comic books...

* As Toulouse is a city of aviation and spaceflight, check Airbus and the Cité de l'Espace for '''souvenirs'''

==Eat==
=== Local specialties ===
Toulouse is located in the heart of Southeast France and has a reputation for gastronomy due to its strategic proximity from Gascony. 

'''Saucisse de Toulouse''', a sausage unrelated to the traditional chipolata. It may look the same, but it has a more peppery taste and the meat is a pink color. Grilled over a wood fire, it offers an incomparable experience.

'''Duck''' is a regional specialty, and thus many restaurants will offer duck for dinner. It comes in most various forms, all being delicious: foie gras, confit, dried, and many more.

'''Cassoulet''' is the most famous regional dish, a stew made with white beans, duck, saucisse de Toulouse, and herbs. If you visit Toulouse in summer, beware that this quite hearty meal may be hard to finish!

Toulouse is full of a wide range of restaurants. Beware that if you want a table outside in the summer months you will have to book in advance or get there early.

====Budget====

*'''Mezzo Di Pasta''': 43, Rue des Frères Lion (''Métro Francois-Verdier''), Tel: +33 5 34 40 67 01. Mon-Sun 12h00-22h00. A small, inexpensive eatery that provides good quality pasta and salad dishes. Nothing special, but if you are on a budget, can't be bothered to get all dressed up or want something a little less rich than the local cuisine then you can't go wrong here - especially with prices starting from only €4.

*'''La Baie de Morlaix''': 8, rue de l'Esquile (''Métro Jeanne d'Arc''). Tel: +33 5 61 23 02 49. 10h00 - 18h00. A small and friendly Art Déco Crêperie near the Place du Capitole. For inexpensive yet filling eating you can't go wrong with French Crepes. An excellent savoury option the St Jacques Roquefort is recommended. Prices range from €6 to €10.

*'''Chez Nous Les Libanais''': 10 Rue Jean Suau (''Metro Capitole/Esquirol''), Mon-Sun 11h00-23h00 (non-stop). A small Lebanese restaurant is well-known by the locals, where you can eat a generous Lebanese-style sandwich for €7 (wide range of meats and vegetarian available) or a large plate filled with meat (chawarma chicken, kefta beef, shish taouk, vegetarian available), fresh vegetables and Lebanese specialties for €11. The place is quite crowded at lunchtime, so if you want to be seated come early or ask for a take-away, and go to the rivers of the Garonne nearby to enjoy your meal.

*'''Rue Pargaminière''': This street, located between universities and the city center, is full of small restaurants, kebabs, and original snacks. Since most young people eat there and the competition is fierce, expect cheap price (<10€) and a large variety of food available.

====Mid-Range====

* '''Emile''', 13 Place Saint-Georges (''Metro Capitole''), Tel: +33 5 61 21 05 56. Mon-Sun 12.00-14.00 & 19.30-22.00. A beautiful restaurant originally opened in the 1940s as a hotel. Serving fresh seafood and local specialties from €20 for three courses (This price is for a lunch meal on weekdays, if you come at night or during the weekend it may be more expensive). It is quite popular among the locals, so calling to book a table one or two days in advance is recommended. Emile is located in the heart of 'Old Toulouse' at Place Saint-Georges - a quintessential French public square that provides an excellent atmosphere and ambiance for al-fresco dining. Alternatively, choose the Carte option for a more modern take on class French cuisine. Although expect to pay for it! [http://www.restaurant-emile.com/]

* '''Aux Saveurs des Paradoux''', 14 Rue des Paradoux (''Metro Carmes''), Tel: +33 05 61 25 23 23. Mon-Sun 12.00-22.00. A favorite with locals, Aux Saveurs des Paradoux offers generous portions in a small, intimate atmosphere. Specialties include Swimming Lobster, Lamb Stew with House Vegetables, Veal Medallions with Chive Mash, and a Carpaccio of Cherries with Mascarpone and Chocolate. After ordering a small plate of Bread and Tapenade is served which helps prepare for the gastronomic delights ahead. Not cheap it has to be said but for the choice and quality of the food coupled with the quintessentially quaint French setting, €30 each for three courses isn't too bad. A bottle of wine (an excellent choice from all the classic French wine regions) costs around €15. Due to it being a small establishment, make sure you book for both lunch and dinner to avoid disappointment.

* <eat name="Délicatessen" alt="" address="11 Rue Riquet" directions="Metro François-Verdier" phone="Tel: 05 61 62 49 00" email="" fax="" url="" hours="Mon-Fri 4pm–2am, Sat 6pm–3am, Sun 11am–4:30pm, 6pm–2am" price="">Busy tapas bar with friendly atmosphere that offers meals, a good  selection of beers on tap and a real happy hour; tapas here are tasty, cheap and generous (choose 5 for €16.50 - March 2012). It's a popular place so it's better to get there a little earlier in the evening.</eat>

* ''' La Faim des Haricots''' 3 Rue du Puits Vert (''Metro Esquirol'') +33 05 61 22 49 25. [http://www.lafaimdesharicots.fr/en/]. Open 9am onwards. Toulouse's cuisine can leave many vegetarians feeling rather left out, hence why, in 1996, Les Faims opened to a mixture of delight and bewilderment. Since then it has become a favorite amongst carnivores and veggies alike! Possibly one of the best value eateries in the city, La Faim des Haricots offers five all-you-can-eat options including; salad, quiche, a dish of the day, soups, and desserts. Prices start at €11 for two options working up to €14 for all the options and €16 all in includes a glass of cider, all the food options, and a cup of coffee. Given the amount of choice (and the quality of the food on offer) you will be hard-pressed not to return more than once — particularly if you are vegetarian.

* '''Le Sales Gosses''', 7 Rue de L'Industrie (''Metro Jean-Jaures''), +33 05 61 99 30 31. Mon-Sun 12.00-22.00. For something a little different which is meant to provide a nostalgic experience for people who wish to return to childhood in France. Big gourmet burgers and experimental dishes that combine flavors of childhood such as Orangina and Nutella with high-quality ingredients such as cod fillet to produce dishes you will not have tasted before. Think of a French, less pretentious (surprisingly) Heston Blumenthal. [http://www.restaurant-salesgosses.fr/]

*'''Restaurant Les Caves de la Maréchale''': 3, rue Jules Chalande (''Métro Esquirol''). Tel: +33 5 61 23 89 88. 12h00 - 00h00. Hidden away in a cave-like setting (as you may have garnered from the name) this restaurant offers a wonderfully intimate atmosphere for a wonderfully inexpensive price. You will feel like you are sitting in an upmarket establishment, but with a three-course meal made all from fresh ingredients (menu of the day) costing only €17.50 you, and your wallet, won't have to dread receiving the bill.

====Splurge====

*'''Restaurant Michel Sarran''', 21 Boulevard Armand Duportal (''Metro Compans Cafferelli''), Tel: +33 (0)5 61 12 32 32. Mon-Fri (Excl Wed) 12.00-14.00 & 20.00-22.00. Arguably the finest restaurant in Toulouse. The two Michelin-starred restaurants run by the Sarran family strive to do away with the formality of a restaurant and instead invite the guest (not a customer) to a familial experience. The food is exquisite with dishes such as Foie Gras, Pidgeon, and the finest Beef featuring on the menu. If you are able to afford it, prices start at €98 for a three-course evening meal or 51€, for lunch (wine included), and are a fan of outstanding French gastronomy then this restaurant is for you. [http://www.michel-sarran.com/]

*'''La Gentymagre''', 3 Rue Gentymagre (''Metro Esquirol''), Tel: +33 05 61 21 38 60. [http://www.legentymagre.com/#Presentation/Dejeuner]. Mon-Sat 12.00-22.00. A fine dining bistro that prides itself on presentation, full-on French flavors, and good service. It is also quite well known for its Rum Barba which, it is said, is not only delicious but will leave one struggling to walk in a straight line. Taxi! The decor is that of a plush, modern bistro which, in increasingly cosmopolitan Toulouse, is a tremendous atmosphere in which to dine. 
*'''Le Pyreneen''', 14 Allée Prés Roosevelt (''Metro Jean Jaures''), Tel: +33 09 65 23 12 19. [http://www.lepyreneen.com/brasserie_uk.php]. Mon-Sun 12.00-14.00 & 19.00-22.00. Simply put, a quintessential Toulousian brasserie situated near Place du Capitole, Place du Wilson, and the charming Hotel De France. Opened in 1925 'Le Pyreneen' has been serving the 'Pink City' Eggs Minosa, Kidneys, and Calf's Head ever since. But traditional French fare that may not be to your taste is not all that is offered. St Jacques Scallops with Kidney and Beans is a firm favorite as is the Pigs Trotters and the Steak Tartare.

==Stay Safe==

Like most of France, Toulouse is a very safe city, and you are unlikely to encounter any problems. Nevertheless, it is always wise to keep a close eye on your belongings and your surroundings.

Some Northern parts of the city tend to be rather sketchy, especially at night. Also, in recent years, the number of beggars has tended to rise. You can simply ignore them. 

Not unlike other cities, the train station is a hotbed for scam artists.
