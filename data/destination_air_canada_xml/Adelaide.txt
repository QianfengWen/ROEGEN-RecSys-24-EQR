'''Adelaide''' is the capital city of [[South Australia]]. 

==Understand==
[[Image:River Torrens at the University of Adelaide.jpg|thumb|The River Torrens passing near the University of Adelaide]]
In Adelaide, you can enjoy stylish architecture, boutique shopping, sandy swimming beaches, fabulous arts events, nightlife, fine dining, and some of Australia's best caf√© strips. Population is about 1.3 million, which makes it Australia's fifth largest city and by far the largest city in the otherwise sparsely populated state.

Adelaide is centrally located among the wine regions of [[McLaren Vale]], [[Barossa Valley]] and [[Clare Valley]], all of which are within day-trip distance.

Unlike the other state capitals of Australia, Adelaide has never been a convict settlement, and was settled entirely by free settlers since its founding.

==Get in==

===By car===
Adelaide is at least a 1 day drive away from any capital cities on the Australian east coast. The shortest route from Adelaide to [[Melbourne]] takes 8-9h.  Roads are all paved, and there are some freeway sections, but it is mostly 2 lane roads of reasonable quality. 

*[[Melbourne]] to Adelaide is 736km (457mi) via [[Horsham]] (National Highway 8) or 901km (560mi) via [[Mount Gambier]] (National Highway 1)

*[[Sydney]] to Adelaide is 1,422km (884mi) via [[Wagga Wagga]] and [[Mildura]] (National Highway 20). The road through Wagga will save you some hours due to freeway conditions for most of the way from Sydney to Wagga. Via [[Broken Hill]] (National Highway 32), Sydney to Adelaide is 1,659km (1,031mi) . 

*[[Brisbane]] to Adelaide is 2,031km (1,262mi) via Broken Hill

===By plane===
'''Adelaide International Airport''' ({{IATA|ADL}}) is around 7km (4mi) to the west of the city centre. West Beach, an excellent swimming beach with plenty of accommodation is located only 4km (2.5mi) away.

Adelaide's airport has scheduled international services. Air New Zealand via Auckland is particularly useful for flights to and from the Americas and the Pacific Islands. Cathay Pacific via Hong Kong is generally useful for flights to and from both East Asia and Europe -although this service also ceased during the pandemic.  Malaysia Airlines and Singapore airlines via Kuala Lumpur and Singapore are useful for flights to and from South East Asia, India, the Middle East and Europe - and continued, at reduced frequencies, throughout the pandemic. Qatar also offer flights direct to Doha on the new A350 XWB aircraft, and from there connecting to much of Europe and the Middle East. In addition, domestic flights to Sydney and Melbourne are useful for connections to the Americas, while domestic flights to Perth are useful for connections to Africa. 

Adelaide had long been the only state capital without international flights provided by Qantas, following the cessation of a previous route to Singapore (continued by Singapore Air), Melbourne - Adelaide - Delhi flights by Qantas begin in December 2021.

Domestic services and connections are available to many major Australian cities and regional centres. Budget airlines [http://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/plan/destinations/flights-to-adelaide/ Virgin Australia], [http://www.jetstar.com/ Jetstar] and [http://www.tigerair.com Tigerair] offer the cheapest domestic airfares. Adelaide is also provided with scheduled services by Qantas and REX - regional airlines. Regional services and operations are provided by Regional Express Airlines (''Rex''),  Alliance Airlines, and Qantaslink flights.

There is only a single terminal for international and domestic departures so transfers are relatively seamless.

The airport has ATMs, currency change, food, shopping and lockers.  Free Wi-Fi is available throughout the terminal.

====Between the airport and the city====
JetBuses J1, J1A, J1X and J3 link the airport with the city, operating every 15 minutes throughout the day. A ticket costs $5.10 during peak, $3.30 off-peak and includes unlimited transfers within a 2h period. Alternatively you can buy a 3 day Visitor Pass with unlimited travel for $26.60. The city centre can be reached from the airport in 15-25min.

Taxis are available outside the terminal, at around $16-20 to the city centre. An extra $3 is added to fares starting at the airport.

Rental cars are available. Major national renters are represented in kiosks at the terminal.

===By train===
[http://www.greatsouthernrail.com.au Great Southern Rail] runs long distance tourist train services, The Ghan runs to [[Alice Springs]] and [[Darwin]], The Overland, runs to [[Melbourne]], and the Indian Pacific runs to [[Perth]], [[Broken Hill]] and [[Sydney]]. The The Ghan and Indian Pacific services are train experiences, more like a cruise on rails than a plain transport service, offering sleeper cabins, dining, off-train excursions and the opportunity to take your car with you on the train. However, they take considerably longer and invariably cost more than the journey by bus or plane - a minimum of $800 up to $2500 depending on class of service.

The Overland service to Melbourne is a regular seated day train and while it still takes over 10 hours, the fares can be cheaper than or of comparable price with air fares - starting at $99 each way (red standard class advance purchase). The trains stop at intermediate stops which may not be serviced by air connections. Note that the rest of the train services are very infrequent - running only once or twice per week so you should plan well in advance!

V/Line runs a daily combined bus/train journey to Adelaide from [[Melbourne]]. You can connect from NSW TrainLink trains to V/Line buses at [[Albury]] or [[Benalla]].

===By bus===
[http://www.greyhound.com.au Greyhound Australia] run services to Adelaide from [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]] and [[Alice Springs]].

[http://fireflyexpress.com.au Firefly] runs two services per day to [[Melbourne]] with WiFi and USB charging

==Get around==
[[File:Adelaide (16205578880).jpg|thumb|350px|Adelaide as seen from Green Hill]]
===Public transport===

Accurate transit directions can be obtained through Google Maps. To navigate around, just enter your "to" address and "from" address (or use current location) on your device (including iPhone, Android), then select the public transport icon.

====Ticketing====
Metropolitan train, tram and bus services are contracted out by the State Government under the unified brand name '''Adelaide Metro''' and use a unified ticketing system, "Metroticket". The [http://www.adelaidemetro.com.au Adelaide Metro website] or the '''Passenger Transport InfoCentre''' (Adelaide Railway Station, 125 North Terrace, Adelaide CBD) is the place to visit for timetable and route information. 

A key point for ticketing in Adelaide is that the vast majority of tickets and fares allow the passenger to move freely around the transport network for at least 2 hours. No validations are permitted after 2 hours but the passenger is allowed to remain on the current vehicle if their ticket has already been validated before the 2 hour limit. 

The off-peak period in Adelaide is between 9:01am and 3:00pm on weekdays, Sundays and all public holidays. Tickets are approximately 30% cheaper during this time. 

There are several options for purchasing tickets:

*Single trip tickets ($5.40 for adults ($3.50 in off-peak)) allow the passenger to move freely around the transport network for 2 hrs. If traveling often, it is cheaper to use a stored value Metrocard (below).

*A $10.20 daytrip ticket is available, allowing unlimited travel within the Adelaide Metro area for an entire day. If travelling for 3 days, it may be more economical to purchase a 3 day visitors pass (below).

*There is a 3 day visitors pass available for $26.60, allowing unlimited travel on the Adelaide Metro network for 3 days. A map and a travel guide is included. If you wish to continue using the ticket beyond the 3 days, more Metrocard credit can be purchased.

Single Tickets can be purchased from ticket machines on board trains (coins or card) and trams (coins or card), and from some bus interchanges (Tea Tree Plaza, Klemzig, Paradise). A small number of stations (Adelaide, Gawler, Noarlunga Centre, Oaklands and Mawson Lakes), and a number of newsagents, corner stores and post offices sell & recharge the contactless, stored value Metrocard.

If using a Metrocard or visitors pass, you validate by touching against the reader when entering a bus, train or tram - just do what the locals do. Ensure that the light on the machine is green before proceeding. There is no need to touch off. Additionally, you need to validate to pass through the platform gates at Adelaide Railway Station (you still have to validate on the train after going through the barriers).

====Buses====
The Adelaide Metro bus system is quite comprehensive, and extends out to the Adelaide Hills in the east, down to Maclaren Vale in the south (although buses there are infrequent) and as far as Gawler in the north. It does not cover the Barossa Valley. Routes that may be useful for tourists include:

* '''864F''' to Crafers Park & Ride, then '''823''' to Cleland Wildlife Park and Mount Lofty Summit (from Currie Street in Adelaide CBD, limited services per day)

* '''751W''' or '''753''' (from Noarlunga Centre station) - to Maclaren Vale (limited services per day)

* '''117''', '''118''', '''150''', '''156''', '''232''' - to Port Adelaide (different routes)

The free '''City Loop (#99C)''' bus runs M-F 07:40-18:00 every 15min, F 18:00-21:20 every 30min, Sa 08:00-17:00 every 30min and Su (and public holidays) 10:00-17:00 every 30min. It has clockwise and anticlockwise routes each with about 30 stops taking in all the major cultural and commercial centres, beginning at Victoria Square and including Adelaide Railway Station. The buses have ground-level access ramps.

Be warned that bus frequency declines sharply after 18:00, with hourly intervals being typical in the suburbs. All services cease operation around midnight, so check your timetables and expect to catch a taxi if required if you are out after this time. Very basic ''After Midnight'' bus services along limited routes operate hourly after midnight on Saturday nights.

====Tram====
A tram service runs from the Royal Adelaide Hospital in Hindmarsh, an inner north-western suburb, to the Adelaide CBD, travelling along North Terrace and King William Street, through the city and then onward to the south west terminating at the popular seaside suburb of Glenelg. You can park in the Entertainment Centre carpark and take the tram into the city, which is more convenient than finding parking within the city itself. Stops within the city centre include Adelaide Railway Station, Rundle Mall and Victoria Square. '''Tram travel from South Terrace, through the CBD to the Northern Terminus of the line is free.''', as is travel confined to Jetty Road in Glenelg. Otherwise the standard ticket system applies and the whole trip takes about 30 min. Tickets may be bought in advance or purchased from a ticket machine on the tram (card or coins).

====Train====
The Adelaide Metro train system has four main lines, with two additional branch lines:

* The '''Gawler Line''', to Gawler Central, about an hour north of the city.

* The '''Outer Harbor Line''', which goes up the Le Fevre Peninsula in the north-west of the city via Port Adelaide. A branch extends off this line to the beachside suburb of Grange.

* The '''Seaford Line''', formerly the Noarlunga Line, which now extends through Noarlunga Centre to Seaford, in the far south of the city, via the beachside suburb of Brighton. A short branch extends off this line to the suburb of Tonsley (which only operates Mon-Fri during business hours and peak hours, except during the AFL season when additional dedicated Footy Express trains run on game day, on all lines).

* The '''Belair Line''' which extends to Belair in the foothills of the Adelaide Hills to the south-east of the city.

Visitors may find the Outer Harbor line useful to get to Port Adelaide. Although the station is about 0.5 km (0.3 mi) south of the port area, but is an easy walk up Commercial Road. The Belair Line is useful to access Belair National Park, and the Seaford Line provides access the seaside suburbs of Brighton and Hallett Cove. Some of the larger shopping centres are close to stations. Westfield Marion shopping centre is very close to Oaklands Railway Station, while Noarlunga Centre is next to Colonnades.

===By foot===
The city centre is compact and can be easily covered on foot. Most attractions are centered around the blocks between North Terrace and Victoria Square on either side of King William Street. 

===By taxi===
Taxis are provided by several companies and can be hailed on the street or arranged by phone. There is a common rate of flagfall and a per-distance/time charge, both of which are increased at night and on weekends. Uber also operates its service in Adelaide, which was legalised in mid-2017.

A taxi fare from the airport to the city will cost between $22 and $28 on weekends and peak periods and between $20 and $25 on weekdays. There is an extra $1 levy on all fares and $3 if the fare starts at the airport.

===By bicycle===
NGO [http://www.bikesa.asn.au "Bicycle SA"] provides a range of bicycle services, including free-to-use tourist bikes, from its offices in Currie Street, next to the Adelaide Central Bus Station. ‚òé +61 8 8168-9999. Bicycles can be hired, with the deposit of a driving licence or other ID, for the entire day for free, but must be returned before 16:30 or a $25 fee is payable. Arrangements can be made for bicycles to be hired overnight. This service closed during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 with no date set for its return. 

A popular ride is to ride from the city centre along the Torrens out to West Beach, then down to Glenelg and back. '''You cannot take your bike on the Glenelg Tram or any bus''', even outside peak hour, however you can take them on trains. An alternative to taking the tram back from Glenelg is to ride a further 20min south along the coast to Brighton Station on the Noarlunga Centre Line where there are reasonably frequent trains back to Adelaide.

===By car===
Although the city centre is easily walked or travelled by public transport, as Adelaide's public transportation network is limited and infrequent outside the city centre and the major transport hubs (like Glenelg), renting a car is the most practical way of getting around Adelaide, particularly if you want to head into the suburbs. All the big international companies such as [http://www.redspot.com.au Redspot], [http://www.avis.com.au Avis], [http://www.hertz.com.au Hertz] have an office at Adelaide airport and there are also depots in the central city area.

Pay attention to speed limits.  The default metropolitan speed limit, which applies in the absence of any signs in built-up areas, is 50km/hr. The default rural speed limit, which applies in the absence of any signs, is 80km/hr. Although rare, some suburban streets are 40km/hr.  Main roads in the inner-city are usually sign posted to 50 or 60km/hr. A few road corridors are 80 to 90km/hr, and most freeways are 110km/hr, including most outback roads outside the city. On multi-lane roads above 80km/h, keep on the left unless overtaking. Vehicles on multi-lane highways will often drive above the speed limit in the rightmost lane, up to around 130km/h, especially on the Northern Expressway.

===By e-scooter===
There are two e-scooter rental companies operating in the main Adelaide area, Neuron (orange scooters) and Beam (purple scooters). They are activated by scanning with an app, prices vary and some have promotions for cheaper or free rides, so it's worth searching for any active deals while you're there. You legally must wear the provided helmets while riding, and cannot ride scooters into restricted areas (such as Rundle Mall) or outside of the Adelaide area. Personally owned e-scooters are not legal to ride and police may fine you for using them. A map of the operating area of these scooters can be found on the [https://www.cityofadelaide.com.au/transport-parking/public-transport/e-scooters/ City of Adelaide website.]

[[image:KoalaAdelaide.jpg|thumb|A Koala at Cleland Conservation Park]]

*[http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/parks/belair/ Belair National Park] is a national park of 835 ha, 11 km (7 mi) south of Adelaide City.  Due to its history as a "Recreation Park" it has many good trails for bushwalking, as well as tennis courts and grassy areas available for hire, and a good adventure playground for children.  Old Government House, the colony's first official Vice-regal summer residence, is located within the park.  A vehicle entry fee applies to cars entering the park, or else its western parts can be accessed from the Belair line train, a 35 min journey from Adelaide city.

Visitors can feed and wander at their leisure among kangaroos, wallabies, Emus and waterfowl. Displays of Dingoes, reptiles, Tasmanian Devils, Wombats, Echidnas and Koalas allow easy viewing access, or stroll through the aviaries.

There is also a popular rock climbing area within the park. Note that the waterfalls only flow in the winter months, and are usually completely dry by Christmas.

===Churches===
Adelaide is called the ''City of Churches'', although the locals say that there are definitely more pubs than churches!

Some of the interesting churches are:

==Drink==
There are pubs and bars dotted all around the CBD, but a few districts are worth singling out. Rundle Street and its neighbouring area  known simply as "The East End" have a number of popular pubs. Hindley St used to be notorious as the seedy home of Adelaide's strip clubs and bikie bars, but it, and "The West End" have undergone a renaissance. The eastern end of Hindley Street is more mainstream, whereas the western end, west of Morphett Street has a few trendier and more alternative venues. The seedy places are still there, but so too is a university campus and a number of trendy bars and clubs. Also important are Gouger Street and its many restaurants but with an increasing number of bars and pubs.  O'Connell Street is home to a few of North Adelaide's popular pubs.

There are also many bars in the suburbs of Adelaide which usually are busier on Thursday and Friday evenings. Quite a lot of the locals will go to the hotels in the suburbs on Thursday and Friday evenings, and go into the Adelaide CBD on Saturday evenings.

Smoking in pubs and clubs is banned under South Australian law. Many drinking establishments have outdoor areas where smoking is permitted.

==Stay safe==
The Australia-wide emergency number is 000. The ambulance service, fire service and police are available through this number.  

As with any city, people should exercise personal safety, particularly at night. 

Your biggest risk in the inner-city and night is drunk people. If you want to avoid drunk people, avoid Hindley Street between 10pm-4am, as this is where you are most likely to encounter them, as this is where most of Adelaide's nightclubs are located. 
You are not at a high risk in other parts of the city in the evening. It is safe to go out to eat, or to a bar, as late as 11pm. You are still unlikely to be a victim of a crime after 11pm, but there will be drunk people around the city.

The city park lands are poorly lit and are best avoided after dark due to the presence of intoxicated people. Robberies have known to occur in these areas. If you need to cross the park lands to reach the suburbs, stay near the road. Catching a taxi or public transport is recommended at night.

When catching a train at a suburban station, it is best to arrive at the station within 1-2 min of the scheduled arrival time. Trains in Adelaide are generally reliable and arrive and depart on schedule. There are security guards on all trains after 7PM and many rail services have bus connections available. Exercise personal safety in and around train stations. 

At night police actively patrol the city centre, especially Hindley Street where most of the city's nightclubs and bars are located. Taxi ranks are located near the Adelaide Casino on North Terrace, the Hilton Adelaide Hotel on Victoria Square, and the junction of Rundle Street and Pulteney Street outside the Hungry Jacks fast food outlet.

Remember to lock your car and avoid leaving valuables in view in unattended vehicles.  

Pickpockets are very rare and there are no "hotspots", but opportunistic theft does happen.  Do not leave valuables unattended.  When swimming at the beach in busy areas near the city, leave one person on shore to look after your things.

Avoid walking at night in outer suburbs known for having higher crime rates, most notably areas like Elizabeth and Salisbury (20km north of the CBD), and Hackham and Noarlunga (25km south of the CBD). The most publicised criminal element are youth gangs that commit robbery and vehicle theft. They tend to be more opportunistic and target people in the wrong place at the wrong time. It's advised you don't walk alone at night in these areas, This heightens your chance of being a victim. There are motorcycle gangs, but they rarely interact with the public and are kept in check through dedicated police operations. You are highly unlikely to encounter any gangs.  

If common sense is used, Adelaide is a very safe city overall.

==Contact==
There is extensive free Wi-Fi access (port 80 only) in the CBD and the airport provided by Internode [http://www.internode.on.net]. View coverage here: [https://hotspot.internode.on.net/coverage/]
