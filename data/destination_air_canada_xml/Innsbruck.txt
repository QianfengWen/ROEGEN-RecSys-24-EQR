'''Innsbruck''' is the provincial capital of [[Tyrol]]. Its 120,000 residents make it the fifth largest city in [[Austria]]. It was one of the eight host cities in the [[Euro 2008|2008 European Football Championships]]. It has twice hosted the Winter Olympics making it not only an interesting and beautiful situated city but the "largest ski resort in the alps". It is located both close to Munich and northern Italy making it a must see alpine destination.

==Understand==
Innsbruck became the capital of [[Tyrol]] in 1429 and in the 15th century the city became a centre of European politics and culture as emperor Maximilian I moved the imperial court to Innsbruck in the 1490s. Many old buildings from the middle ages and modern times survived in the heart of Innsbrucks old town. 

Innsbruck has also hosted the Winter Olympics in 1964 and 1976 as well as the World University Games in 2005. In summer 2008 it hosted several games of the EURO 2008 European Football Championship. 

The city is well known for its sporting opportunities, especially alpine sports, as it is in the Alps and surrounded by mountains. Several ski resorts are situated inside the city territory or within short distance. Innsbruck was one of the centers of snowboard boom in the 1990's and the derived distinct subculture endured until today. The population of skateboarders, snowboarders and people alike is therefore above average and nothing unusual to the people. This culture is also celebrated by a lot of events in and around Innsbruck especially in the winterseason, attracting (predominantly young) people from all around the world.

There are two universities and several colleges in Innsbruck, with over 25,000 students altogether, (including a significant Italian population) making the city's nightlife very lively.

==Climate==

Innsbruck's fair distance from the coast and altitude lead to a continental climate. 
Winters are cold and snowy; 
summers are generally warm, with highly variable weather. Hot and dry days, with temperatures hitting 30°C, are quite common; but can be followed by a cool and rainy spell, with temperatures only around 17°C in the day. 
Be warned, however, at any time, summer nights are cool and temperatures often drop quickly after sunset, sometimes falling below 10°C in early morning.

[[Image:InnsbruckAirport.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Innsbruck airport]]

As an alternative, if you have ski equipment with you and need a Minivan, you can pre-book one. There are a lot of companies, which offer private transfers from and to Innsbruck.

===By train===
Regular (direct) trains operate from [[Venice]], [[Bolzano|Bolzano/Bozen]], [[Zurich]], [[Munich]], [[Graz]], [[Vienna]] (via [[Linz]] and [[Salzburg (city)|Salzburg]]) and many other destinations. 

Despite being a smaller city Innsbruck has fantastic train connections to all major cities in its neighborhood. The main station, ''Innsbruck Hauptbahnhof'', is located at ''Südtiroler Platz'' (South-tyrolean square) in the east of the city center. In addition there are several stations which serve suburban and regional train connections.

The Austrian train system is operated by the Österreichische Bundesbahnen, OEBB [http://www.oebb.at].

====Discounts====
Travelers with ÖBB Vorteilscard [http://www.oebb.at/pv/de/Servicebox/VORTEILScard/index.jsp] get up to 50% discount when traveling within Austria.

There is a special Vorteilscard for people under the age of 26 which comes at a reduced price.

With a [[Rail_travel_in_Europe#RailPlus_card|RailPlus]] dicount cards travelers save up to 25% when traveling by train from any of the surrounding neighbour countries.

===By car===
Innsbruck is reachable through both of Tyrol's motorways: Inntalautobahn (A 12) and Brennerautobahn (A 13).

===By bike===
Innsbruck  can be reached on the Inntalradweg from Passau to St. Moritz. Even in the city this bicycle trail is signposted with small green road signs.

==Get around==
Most one-day visitors don't use any transport: all of the major Old Town sites are within a reasonable walking time.

===On foot===
The classic walk into old Innsbruck follows.

From the main station (Hauptbahnhof) to the city center is a relatively short and enjoyable 10 to 15 minute walk. Walk out of the Hauptbahnhof, cross the street at the train station cross walk, turn to your right, and go down to the next street to your left. Walk on this street until Maria-Theresien Strasse, then turn right toward the city center. Taking this street all the way leads to the pedestrian zone and the Golden Roof.

===By car===
Big parts of the downtown area are declared (fee-based) short-term parking zones. For longer visits, it is highly recommended to park off-site and use public transportation.

===By public transport===
Public local traffic (4 tram-lines, and a dense network of buses) is operated by ''Innsbrucker Verkehrsbetriebe'' [http://www.ivb.at] and a couple of private operators. All public services are organized in ''Verkehrsverbund Tirol'' [http://www.vvt.at], which means that tickets are valid in every public transport line (including buses, trams and trains). All buses and trams are modern low-floor vehicles. A major extension of the tram network is currently carried out (it ist the line to the technical university campus, first phase to be completed in autumns 2012)

Visitors should be aware that there sometimes are bus lines that split up into different destinations (the bus line O, for example), and so it's important to pay attention to the destination displays (outside and inside) and the spoken announcements. Single-fare tickets are 1.90 euro in the city fare zone if paid by the driver or 1,80 euro if purchased at ticket machines. Regardless of the door you enter, go to the driver and pay, exact change not necessary. 24-hour tickets, weekly tickets and other sorts of tickets are only offered at multi-language ticket machines to be found at many stations. They can also be purchased at the identically looking machines for short-term parking tickets. You must validate the ticket when you get on your first bus or tram.  

The special bus line "TS" ("The Sightseer" [http://www.sightseer.at]) connects the major sights like Schloss Ambras, Bergisel and Alpenzoo to downtown. However special fares apply for this line. If you don't plan to visite every museums it might be reasonable cheaper to use the normal 24 hour ticket without this bus.

Two tram lines lead to two villages in the neighborhood of Innsbruck. 

Tram line nr. 6 connects Innsbruck and the mountain village Igls, which is worth a visit. The line passes the uplands with vast forests and gives some spectacular prospects for travelers either on Innsbruck or on the lovely landscape between Aldrans and Igls. It provides stops immediately near Schloss Ambras and the bathing-lake Lansersee (ice skating in Winter is also possible there). The terminus Igls lies within the city fare zone, so no additional ticket is needed. From there it is just a fine 10 Minutes walk to the Patscherkofel Ropeway. 

Tram line STB is 18 kilometers long and connects Innsbruck with several villages in the Stubaital valley. This tram provides also acces to Bergisel (Tirol Panorama) at the station Sonneburgerhof. This station is also situated within die city fare zone. In Mutters, Nockhofweg acces to an easy skiing area, the Mutteralm, is provided (10 Minutes walk). A beautiful hour's ride will take you at least the small town of Fulpmes. The new red liveried trams offer great scenic views on the journey. It is recommended to make a trip around Halloween, when the larch-trees on the Telfer Wiesen have got their best autumn colour.

====By S-bahn====
A suburban train system called S-Bahn with five routes (S1 - S5) connects Innsbruck to villages and towns around the city, from Landeck to Kufstein or Kitzbühel and from Mittenwald to Brennero. Timetables and fares can be found at  [http://www.vvt.at].

====By bike====
If you don't mind a little exercise you can get everywhere in Innsbruck by bike as shown by the many students, who are not willing to pay for a bus ticket. The biking lanes have been improved recently, so it's probably one of the most uncomplicated ways of transport throughout the city.

The '''Innsbruck-Card''' [http://www.innsbruck.info/en/experience/innsbruck-card.html] offers free entrance to all of Innsbruck's sights, free use of public transportation (including the TS line). It also includes a one-time ascent&descent to ''Nordkette'', ''Patscherkofel'' and ''Axamer Lizum'' and free entrance to Swarovski Kristallwelten [http://www.swarovski.com/kristallwelten/] in Wattens. The Innsbruck-Card is valid for 24/48/72 hours and can be purchased at ''Innsbruck Information'' (Burggraben 3), the TI in Hauptbahnhof, and several museums and tourist offices. Tip: The Innsbruck card is pretty expensive, 49/55/66 euro for 1/2/3 day cards. And daily or weekly public transport cards are cheap - the "all inclusive" sales pitch is alluring to disoriented travelers, but make sure the discounts are worth the initial price. If you are not planning to see these major entrance-fee sites, remember that you may buy more than one daily card at a time, as the 24 hours only starts once validated. Be sure to compare with the price of a weekly ticket too. 

The bus line ''Sightseer (TS)'' connects the major sights in Innsbruck. However it there is always a cheaper public transport line going to the same destination, though it might take you more time.

==Do==
* '''Nordpark''' [http://www.nordpark.at/] is accessible via the tram line 1, the bus lines 1, 4, A, D, E, J and T. The ''Nordkettenbahn'' goes up to Seegrube and Hafelekar, where many hiking routes and trip routes start. In August 2004, the ''Nordpark Singletrail'', one of the most ambitious mountain bike freeride routes in Europe, was opened (more information: [http://www.vertriders.com/]).
:In winter, the Nordpark can offer several ski routes. They are steep and offer a great view of the nearby mountains and the city itself.
:One ascent&descent is free with the Innsbruck-Card.
:It is possible to walk/hike all the way up to the summit without taking the cable cars. It is vigorous but doesn't require special equipment. There are places where it is not completely clear which way to go (even with local hiking maps) but other walkers are very friendly and you can almost always see your goal.

* '''Patscherkofelbahn''' [http://www.patscherkofelbahnen.at/] is accessible via  bus line J, destination "Patscherkofelbahn" or "Olympiaexpreß" and tram line 6 to Igls. Tram line 6 is particularly worth taking - a beautiful meandering route up the mountain and included in the city zone of Innsbruck's public transport. Much better value than the Hungerburgbahn on the Nordkette. The ''Patscherkofel'' is a skiing region south of Innsbruck, that has a number of timbered ski-runs of the former olympia-routes. In summer it is a great region for hiking along the forestline.
:One ascent&descent is free with the Innsbruck-Card.
* '''[[Stubaital]]''' [http://www.stubai.at/] offers several ski resorts in the winter.

* '''Casino Innsbruck''' [http://www.casino-urlaub.at/casino-innsbruck.en.htm] gaming enjoyment in Tyrol.

===Events===

* '''Tiroler Abend with the Gundolf Family''' [http://www.tiroler-abend.com] - For almost half a century this show is visited by travellers and gives good insight on traditional Tyrolean culture— everybody who likes everything stereotypical about the alpine culture will be served the full menu: Yodeling, traditional dances, plays, music and clothing are mixed with typical surroundings.
* '''New Orleans Festival''' - Since New Orleans is the partner city of Innsbruck a festival is held every summer featuring a lot of prominent musicians and focussing on Jazz, Blues, Gospels and other styles from the region around New Orleans.
* The '''Ski Jump Contest''' around new year at the Begisel stadium is one of the few moments when Austrians demonstrate true patriotism. As Austrians are very competitive in alpine disciplines this is one of the events that many people follow.
* For the younger generation the '''Air & Style Snowboard Contest''' [http://www.air-style.com] is the high point of the year when the best snowboarders of the world compete in the biggest snowboard event of Europe. The event is the first snowboard competition that ever featured the straight jump, it's accompanied by international bands and a crowd beyond the 10.000's. Usually it is held either around the beginning of December or end of January.
* In late spring a lot of clubs and pubs participate in the city event '''Sound City''' [http://www.soundcity.at/], where downtown Innsbruck becomes a network of discos. Shuttle busses circulate around the city and bring the guests to various locations where a range of international DJ's play different styles.
* The '''Hafen''' [http://www.hafen.cc/], the '''Treibhaus''' [http://www.treibhaus.at/] and the '''p.m.k.''' [http://www.pmk.or.at/] are event centers downtown or a little oustide of the city. Many concerts, events and parties take place all around the year and are visited by young locals, students and travellers. 
*'''Note''': In the summer season Innsbruck is flooded by tourists from the far east and far west - predominantly older people who are mostly on a European tour - the event calendar adapts to this. The winter season is dominated by younger people, especially students and travellers from all around the world, who provide the city with a vivid nightlife.

==Buy==
'''Malls:''' There are several shopping malls in Innsbruck:
===Inner City===
* '''Rathaus Gallerien''' [http://www.rathausgalerien.at/], 2 minutes walk from the Old Town, main entrance via Maria-Theresien-Straße
* '''Kaufhaus Tyrol''' [http://www.kaufhaus-tyrol.at/], recently opened shopping mall with five levels, located right in the inner city just opposite ''Rathaus Gallerien''. 
* '''Sillpark''' [http://www.sillpark.at] (just outside downtown--turn right from train station (Hauptbahnhof), walk one block, turn right, walk under a railway--and you are looking at it. The 3, C, F, J, and O lines take you there.

===Outside Down Town===
* '''DEZ''' [http://www.dez.at] (bus lines C, R, S and T), many stores just right around it, such as Ikea etc.
* '''Cyta''' (in the suburb "Völs") (S-Bahn S1 or S2, or bus line T)

Furthermore, there are several warehouses, especially in the suburb of Neu-Rum. 

'''Shopping areas:''' There are numerous shops in central pedestrian areas like Maria-Theresien-Straße, the Old Town, Franziskanerplatz, Sparkassenplatz and Anichstraße as well as Museumstraße. You will also find shops/stores in quarter centers of Wilten (tram lines 1, 6 and STB) and Pradl (tram line 3).

'''Souvenir stores''' in the Old Town offer souvenirs of varying origin, but the '''Tiroler Heimatwerk''' (Meranerstraße 2) offers real Tyrolean handcraft. However most of the shops are real tourist traps and are overpriced by far. You will probably find more authentic and cheaper souvenirs in one of the surrounding villages of Innsbruck.

====Clothes and footwear====
Buy creative footwear:
* '''El Natura Lista''' in Salamander shop (Maria-Theresien 1; also great choice of Tomy Hilfiger shoes)
* '''Think!''' in Stiefelkater (Marktgraben str. 14, +43 512 583065)
