'''Vilnius'''[http://www.vilnius.lt] is the capital and largest city of [[Lithuania]]. It lies in the valley of the confluence of Neris and Vilnia rivers and has 706,832 inhabitants (2019 statistics). Along with [[Linz]], [[Austria]], Vilnius was the European Capital of Culture in 2009.

The word ''Vilnius'' is a masculine form of the ''Vilnia'' river's name (which is feminine) and refers to the river surge. Therefore, the spelling in other languages (Vilna, Wilna, Vilno, Wilno) is the same word adapted to the corresponding grammar. The area has been inhabited since the Mesolithic era, but it only became a capital city in 1323 when Grand Duke Gediminas transferred the Seat from [[Trakai]] to Vilnius. A monument to Gediminas (author of the concept is a Lithuanian-American sculptor Vytautas Kašuba) stands in Cathedral Square near the site of the former pagan temple. The Grand Duke is depicted at the monument when he made a final decision, dismounted from his horse, and blessed the land which essentially became the capital. It's known that its glory would echo like an iron-wolf-like sound throughout the world. The howling Iron Wolf from the Grand Duke's prophetic dream is depicted below. You can find these two key names, Gediminas and the Iron Wolf (Geležinis vilkas), along with the motif of the howling iron wolf quite often everywhere in Vilnius. They are branched into the forms of daily life so they are often overlooked unless you're purposely looking for them.

===History and people===
[[Image: Street of the Gate of Dawn.jpeg|300px|thumb|You just entered the Old Town through the Gate of Dawn early in the morning]]
Vilnius has always been a multi-national city populated with Lithuanians, Poles, Germans, and Slavs from the immemorial time, later on with Jews as well. Although the original city location was lost due to erosion, the present-day Old Town reappeared in the Middle Ages. These inhabitants were forced to settle down there since the heights of a Vilnia river bank made it impossible to live elsewhere. The colonies of German and Ruthenian merchants and missionaries existed prior to that and evolved into German Town and Ruthenian Town. Then afterward, the towns turned into suburbs and finally fully integrated into the city. Now, they can be identified by a cute Lutheran Kirche hidden in numerous courtyards of the Old Town or a complex of the Orthodox Monastery and Church of the Holy Spirit. Since 1652, Vilnius formally became one of the principal cities for Lithuanian Jews and became a symbolic capital of Jewish culture in 1661. The Jews of Vilnius in the 19th century were constantly increasing the economical factor, which remained so until 22 June 1941. According to the data of the Jewish Community of Lithuania[http://www.lzb.lt/en/], 70,000 out of the 100,000 victims murdered by the Nazis and their Lithuanian collaborators at the forest of Paneriai were Jews from Vilnius (mostly polish jews) and surrounding regions.

After the decisions made at the Yalta Conference after the war, the Soviets expelled most of the urban Polish population to [[Poland]] and the newcomers (mostly workers and military) arrived from Russian SFSR. During extensive urbanization through 1950-1970, more people from other parts of [[Lithuania]], neighboring parts of [[Belarus]], as well as [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]] and other Soviet republics arrived and became an integral part of the city population.

The largest civil airport in Lithuania is located 4.6km south of both bus and train stations, and 6.22km from the city center, as measured by the transport routes. The airport is very compact and consists of one dual building. The original part was constructed in 1944 in Socialist Classicism style, but now serves as an arrivals terminal and retains all flaky Soviet-style details, except for the gloomy mood. In 1993 the building was substantially expanded by constructing a new modern departure terminal in late High Tech Architecture style, best seen when viewed from the side of the runway. The city bus stop is immediately next to the main entrance and the taxis can be found just in front of the arrivals terminal.</listing>
The cities reachable from Vilnius International Airport are: [[Amsterdam]], [[Antalya]], [[Athens]], [[Barcelona]], [[Belfast]], [[Bergen]], [[Berlin]], [[Billund]], [[Birmingham (England)|Birmingham]], [[Bremen]], [[Brussels]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Corfu]], [[Doncaster]], [[Dortmund]], [[Dublin]], [[Eindhoven]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Gdansk]], [[Helsinki]], [[Hurghada]], [[Istambul]]), [[Kiev]], [[Kharkiv]], [[Kutaisi]], [[Larnaca]], [[Leeds]], [[Liverpool]], [[London]], [[Lviv]], [[Lyon]], [[Madeira]], [[Malta]], [[Marsa Alam]], [[Milan]], [[Munich]], [[Nice]], [[Oslo]], [[Paris]], [[Prague]], [[Reykjavik]], [[Riga]], [[Rome]], [[Sharm el-Sheikh]], [[Stockholm]], [[Tallinn]], [[Tel Aviv]]), [[Tenerife]], [[Treviso]], [[Vienna]]),  [[Warsaw]], [[Yerevan]], [[Zurich]].

'''Transfers from Vilnius airport to Vilnius center''':
*'''Train'''. ''Lietuvos Geležinkeliai''[http://www.litrail.lt/en/] operates trains from the airport to the main train station. The train ride takes 7 minutes and departs every hour.
*'''Bus'''[http://stops.lt/vilnius] ride to the center takes 15 minutes and buses depart from the airport every 10–15 minutes. Vilnius bus passage is allowed only with card „Vilniecio kortele“ where tickets are obtained in advance. Only one piece of hand luggage to fit under a single seat is allowed. For larger luggage, extra tickets should be bought, however, no one really requires it.
:* '''Bus #1''' goes from the airport (Lithuanian: ''Oro uostas'') to the central bus/train station (''"Stotis"''). 
:* '''Bus #2''' goes from the airport to the bus/train station, passing the football stadium at ''Liepkalnis'' street.  
:* '''Bus #88''' goes from the airport to the City Business Center (on Konstitucijos avenue, ''Europa'' square), riding through the Old Town first. This is also an Express bus since it does not stop at every bus stop. The bus also runs during the night. It changes its number to 88N. (N meaning “naktinis” - night bus in Lithuanian)
:* '''Bus #3G''' goes to the north through the center (Lukiškės square stop), business center (Konstitucijos avenue), continuing on to Fabijoniškės sleeping district in the north, near the beginning of the A2 highway towards [[Riga]] (within city limits the highway is called ''Ukmergė'' street). The bus number's trailing letter "G" on a green background stands for "Greitasis" which means "Express bus". It stops at all relevant stops in the center while skipping some regular stops before and after the center.
*'''Taxi'''. It is recommended that you follow the local practice and book the taxi before arrival. Use taxi apps for mobile phones like Taxi.lt, Bolt, Uber, or eTaksi. These apps show the estimated fares before your ride. There are also taxis waiting at the airport in front of the arrivals terminal. In order to avoid misunderstandings, know your destination because all average prices are for the distance from the airport to the bus station (c. €10) or the center (c. €15), but if your hotel is somewhere further than the price it can be double or triple. Prices per kilometer are not fixed so they are highly dependent on fuel prices therefore all figures above should be interpreted as approximate. Specific info on taxi prices at the airport can be found at the Vilnius airport website "Services" section.

===By train===
[[Image:Train to Kaunas in winter, Vilnius railway station, Lithuania.jpeg|300px|thumb|Vilnius train station in winter: double-decker EMU EJ575 Vilnius-Kaunas. Note that the deep snow never causes any inconveniences to the railway traffic in Lithuania]]
*''Lietuvos Geležinkeliai'' operates trains from major destinations. The train station in Vilnius is located just south of downtown.

===By bus===
The bus station is located across the street from the main train station. A schedule of all regional buses is placed at the waiting hall entrance.

*'''Eurolines'''[https://www.eurolines.lt/en] and '''ECOLINES'''[https://ecolines.net/lt/en/] operate service between Vilnius and [[Kaunas]], [[Kaliningrad]], [[Riga]], [[Tallinn]], [[St. Petersburg]], and [[Warsaw]], with further connections all over [[Europe]].

*Since 2015, '''PolskiBus'''[https://global.flixbus.com/polskibus] opened the "Baltic route" and it's now possible to travel from Warsaw to Vilnius (and/or further to Riga and Tallinn) at fairly cheap fares with their buses.

===By car===
Motorways serve Vilnius from [[Kaunas]] and [[Panevėžys]]. The modern four-lane motorways and main roads are in a very good state, however, in the winter smaller roads are not cleared. The speed limit is 130kph on the motorways (110&nbsp;kph in winter), but 100&nbsp;kph on the Vilnius-Kaunas sector, 90&nbsp;kph outside towns and 50kph in town.

[[Image:Solaris Trolleybus in Vilnius 15-08-2006.jpeg|300px|thumb|The ''troleibusas''. The same type of tickets is used for both bus or trolleybus, however, bus and trolleybus route networks are separate, as well as schedules and route (line) numbering.]]
[[Image:Inside the bus, Vilnius, Lithuania.jpeg|300px|thumb|Inside the bus. Now are used only yellow electronic reader for electronic tickets.]]
Bellow, in many places there will be mentioned "New Town" one of the Vilnius regions "Naujamiestis" which have long since ceased to be a new town. That was the name of that era.

===By Public Transport===
"Susisiekimo paslaugos"[https://judu.lt/en/for-public-transport-passengers/routes-and-timetables/], [https://www.stops.lt/vilnius/#vilnius/en] operates buses and trolleybuses in Vilnius. A single ticket for either bus or trolleybus use costs ~€0.70/30min if a ''Vilniečio kortelė'' (Vilnius Citizen Card) is purchased on the mobile as Trafi app, also from a kiosk, "PayPost" outlet, Post office, or "Maxima" supermarket for €1.50. When changing buses, be oriented for a limited time. Tickets need to be validated at the yellow electronic readers. Validate your ticket immediately after boarding the vehicle. Controls are regular, especially during the first days of each month and hefty fines are issued to those without validated tickets. There is a 50% discount for students and elderly people, both in public and private buses. There is also an 80% discount for disabled people and people over 80 years old. 

Be aware that trolleybuses and other buses use the same numbering system but the routes are completely different.

There are several routes of the fast buses (not trolleybuses) called "Greitasis" (Express) which stop only at the major stops and connect important parts of the city (residential districts - center - airport and such), they have the route number with a trailing letter "G" on a green background. Altogether, there are 6 different express-bus routes: 1G, 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G, and 6G. Their schedules and routes are marked in green. Routes and numbers of the regular buses are marked in blue, and those of the trolleybuses are marked in red.

===By taxi===
You could call a taxi by phone or mobile application, even if you see a taxi on the street nearby. Street taxis could charge as much as twice the price as taxis called by phone. A good practice is to dial the number written on the vehicle you see, tell the supervisor the address you're at, and you will most likely get the same vehicle for a fair price. Taxi from the airport to the city center is very expensive if you take it to the taxi stop and a better option is to take the public bus or rent a car.

Bolt[https://bolt.eu/en/cities/vilnius] is a convenient mobile app for taxi and scooters booking in Baltic countries, covering hundreds of verified taxis in Vilnius, working with leading taxi companies. Uber[http://www.taxihowmuch.com/location/vilnius-lt] are also available in Vilnius. There are other mobile taxi apps like etaksi[https://etaksi.lt] or eTransport[https://www.etransport.lt].

===By car===
Traveling by car is not advisable during the rush hours (7:00-9:00 and 16:30-18:30) due to traffic jams. 

There are several well-known foreign car rental companies as well as several domestic companies in Vilnius.

City-Bee[https://citybee.lt/en/transport/] operates a car-sharing network where you can rent a car by the hour. There is no contract nor monthly fee, you pay only for the service when you use the car, no parking expenses when you are not using it. There are 13 pick-up points throughout the city, mostly in the center and some relevant points in northern districts.

===By bicycle===
In many places, the city is covered by cycling paths for bicycles, scooters which makes it easily reachable at any spot. Development of bicycle path connections and improvement of the existing network is basically completed. New paths to the most remote districts and recreation areas as well as densification of the network in the center are scheduled to complete until 2027.

This and a few other nearby hills mark the site of the original irregular "Y" shape citadel with perimeter defense fortification. River Vilnia below in the west was an additional natural obstacle. Dwellers lived further east. Deep ravines between the hills reflect the position of the former unpaved streets which was the cause of the ensuing massive erosion. The Crooked Castle was besieged in 4-16 Sept 1390, broken in using the ''Welsh Cat'' technique and burned down by the Prussian-Livonian army, with the help of French and English mercenaries. It was a conflict between two Lithuanian monarchs: Grand Duke ''Vytautas'' allied with the Teutonic Knights against his cousin ''Jagiełło'', who by that time became the King of Poland.</see>

*<see name="Old town" alt="Senamiestis" address="" directions="" lat="" long="" phone="" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilnius_Old_Town" hours="" price="">It is a city area which began to develop extensively around the Middle Ages and it eventually became surrounded by a defensive wall after some time. The wall has long been distinguished by a solid environment and form, but now this area is called the Old Town and has a separate status in the administrative division of Vilnius. While the urban structure reflects the earliest development from the 14th century, the architecture of the buildings is mostly from the Baroque and Classicism periods with some examples of Renaissance and Gothic, to a lesser extent. One should keep in mind that medieval Vilnius was once a wooden city. The huge fires ravaged Vilnius several times from 1513 to 1749. Therefore, many buildings of the 19th and 20th centuries (still considered new) have Gothic and Renaissance cellars, many of which now are occupied with restaurants, bars, or shops. One particular nice area is a block of artisan guilds that is notorious because of its evil fate of 6 September 1941 when the two Jewish ghettos, commonly known as Vilnius Ghetto, were established. The ghetto operated until 24&nbsp;Sept&nbsp;1943. In 1994, the Old Town was added to the [[UNESCO World Heritage List#Lithuania]].</see>

==Drink==
The drinking age in Lithuania is 20. ''Drink carefully'' as most bars will politely ask you to leave if they notice that you appear drunk (staggering, yelling, grabbing strangers). Falling asleep in bars is not tolerated. If you break a glass, many places will expect to be repaid for it on the spot but it's usually a very reasonable price.

Smoking is banned in all public places, however, a number of nightclubs have internal smoke rooms; the ventilation can be of variable quality. If you leave a club to smoke outside, make sure you get stamped and get eye contact from the bouncers so you won't have problems getting back in. It can be a good idea to show the bouncer your cigarette or cigarette packet, before exiting the premises.

===Cafes===
[[Image:Stikliu street Vilnius.jpeg|thumb|300px|''Stiklių'' street in the Old Town]]
In both Old Town and the Center there are plenty of cafés. You simply can walk and choose the one you like or ignore if not in mood, not much effort is needed. There are chains of coffee shops and you can easily find them without a guidance.

Most of proper cafés are designed like little fancy restaurants that operate like budget eateries in daytime and turn to something like a cross between bistrò and restaurant in the evening. Vilnius stretches further beyond the Old Town and the Center, and there is also no shortage of cafés. If you need to find some cosy or just different place to rest or eat, the following list may be useful.

==Stay safe==
[[Image:Vilnius_Business_center.jpg|thumb|300px|Business center and a White Bridge at night]]
Vilnius is a relatively safe city; however, crimes do occur. Use typical common sense. 

The area around the central train station is particularly dodgy and frequented by prostitutes and their clients. Being drunk and acting obviously foreign in the middle of the night is a bad idea. If you have traveled from out of town to visit a nightclub or other venue, take a taxi to and from your venue, and on return to the railway station remain in the ticket hall, which is patrolled by security guards.

It is recommended not to enter South Vilnius suburbs, including Naujininkai and Kirtimai, especially at night, as well as some parts of Šnipiškės which are located any deeper than its business district.

Taxis in tourist areas can overcharge 3 times the normal rate.

==Cope==

===Emergency number===
Similarly to the rest of Europe, the emergency number is '''112''', it would work for free even when roaming (even in a phone without a sim!)

===Left luggage===
The coin-operated baggage lockers in the cellar of the railway station are a secure place to store bags and other items. Ensure that nobody is around when you are getting the receipt, because there are thieves who pretend to be station staff.

*'''[[Kernavė]]''' was the medieval capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania listed on [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].
*'''[[Kaunas]]''' is the second-largest city, which served as the national capital in the 1920s and 1930s. 
*'''Geographical Centre Of Europe''' in [[Purnuskes]]. It is situated 25 km to the North of Vilnius and is one of the geographical centers of [[Europe]], which was confirmed by the National Institute of Geography of [[France]] in 1989. Now it has somehow moved a little bit closer due to the different methods of calculation[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographical_midpoint_of_Europe].
*'''Struve Arc''' is a chain of survey triangulations included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. One of the points of the Struve geodetic arc system is located near Meskonys (Meškonys) village (54°55′51″N 25°19′00″E). It is only 4 km away from the Geographical Centre Of Europe in Purnuskes.
*'''[[Trakai]]''' - A very worthwhile day trip, home to five peaceful lakes and two castles. Buses leave often from the central bus station, cost about 2 euros and take about 40 minutes. Trains[https://traukiniobilietas.lt/portal/en] depart eight times a day and tickets can be bought online.
