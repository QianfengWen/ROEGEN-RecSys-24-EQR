'''Manaus''' is a [[Brazil]]ian city of about 2.5 million, located on the Rio Negro a few miles before it meets the Rio Solimões to form the Amazon River properly. The two rivers flow side by side for many miles, different in color, mixing in eddies: the "Meeting of the Waters." Legend has it that they never mix.

==Understand==

The wealth of the primeval forest becomes visible first of all in the architecture of the city. The city was rich and the rubber barons afforded the biggest luxury from Europe, a copy of the Grand Opera de Paris - the ''Teatro Amazonas''. Other monuments from this epoch are the ''Mercado Municipal'', a copy of the famous market halls ''Les Halles'' in Paris, and the arts center ''Palacio Rio Negro'', located among fascinating Portuguese facades. Today Manaus is a foreign trade zone. Foreign enterprises don't pay import duties, what guarantees a certain income for the city and the region. Electronics, wood industry and oil refineries have settled in the outskirts in industrial areas. The harbor is the most important trading center in the city with regional, national and international products.

The city is pleasant and friendly, although quite hot, and is still a major port, and a good starting point for river tours. 

The Rio Negro (northern) branch of the Amazon is the color of strong tea, peaty brown and its comparative acidity means few mosquitoes. At Manaus the Amazon rises and falls almost twenty meters between seasons. In May and June it's at its peak, full and very wide, spreading way out into the trees. In November and December it's low; still massive but with sandbars.

==Get in==
===By plane===
The airport is some 15 km by road from the city centre. A taxi will set you back 100 reais (fixed price but can vary depending on the specific destination - March 2019). It is possible to get to the centre using buses, but you may need to change to get to your hotel. The bus stop is outside departures. Buses 306 (3.80 BRL) will take you to the center. Be sure to ask the bus driver "Centro" to make sure the bus is going in the right direction.

Manaus is about 2200 km from [[Sao Paulo (city)|São Paulo]] or [[Rio de Janeiro (city)|Rio de Janeiro]] which takes about four hours by air. From North America, it's much faster if you go direct without backtracking via SP or Rio. From June 2014, TAP Portugal flies from [[Lisbon]] to Manaus and [[Belém]], making the trip from Europe to the Amazon shorter. 
* American Airlines has one flight daily direct Miami in an Airbus A319.
* TAP [http://www.flytap.com/] has direct flights from Europe.
* TAM [http://www.tam.com.br/] and United Airlines [http://www.united.com/]are flying once daily direct Miami - Manaus which takes less than 5 hours in a Boeing 767-300. 
* Copa Airlines[http://www.copaair.com/] also does Miami-Manaus via Panama in an Embraer 190. 
* Azul Airlines [http://www.voeazul.com.br/] has direct flights to Campinas and Tabatinga on the Colombian-Peruvian border.
* GOL [http://www.voegol.com.br/] flies nonstop from Rio (6 days a week, except Saturday), Sao Paulo (2x daily) and Brasilia (3x daily).
* TAM [http://www.tam.com.br/] has direct flights to Belem, Brasilia, Boa Vista, Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paolo, Santarem
* TRIP [http://www.voetrip.com.br/] has direct flights to Belem, Belo Horizonte, Porto Velho and other municipalities in northern Brazil.

===By boat===
Manaus is a major destination for boats on the Amazon River. From [[Bel&eacute;m]] on the Atlantic Coast, it takes about five days. Boats go to [[Porto Velho]] two-three times per week. [[Tabatinga]] on the border with [[Colombia]] can also be reached by boat from Manaus, with connections further on to [[Iquitos]] in [[Peru]]. To save a few hours on your way to Colombia or Peru, you can take a boat from [[Manacapuru]] instead.

===By bus===
Due to road conditions, there is very little (if any) long-distance bus service originating from major cities in this area. There are several daily buses from [[Boa Vista]] in the north and there are also buses from destinations in Venezuela, such as Santa Elena. The bus from Caracas in Venezuela takes about 36 hours, but it is air-conditioned, has comfortable reclining seats and a toilet. The bus terminal is located to the north of the city, on Avenida Mario Ypiranga, close to the where it intersects with Constantino Nery and Joao Machado. To get to the centre you can take a taxi, or walk out of the station and over the pedestrian overpass to the next parallel street (Avenida Constantino Nery) and catch a bus for R$3.

==Get Around==
There are many local buses within the city. At bus stops there are only numbers, but on the front of the buses themselves the destinations are listed. Fare is R$3, either pay before entering the station (if boarding at a station), or onboard.

[[Image:TEATRO.jpg||thumb|300px|Teatro Amazonas]]
* '''Opera House''' (''Teatro Amazonas''). n/n Praça São Sebastião, Center, +''55 92'' 3622-1880. Everyday, ''starting time of shows may vary''.  The Opera House was built during the heyday of rubber trade, using materials from all over the world, and was once visited by all the most famous opera divas and maestros. Regular guided tours in English. There are frequent free performances; be sure to arrive at least an hour in advance to secure a seat. Prices vary.

* '''The Meeting of Waters''' (''Encontro das aguas''), the mysterious place where the waters of two different-colored rivers meet to form the great Amazon. Served by many tour operators, but also entirely reachable independently by public transportation. One can take a public bus to Ceasa port, located outside Manaus (for example, there are buses departing from the giant station near Mercado Municipal), then a public ferry Ceasa-Careiro, which will slowly pass over the meeting of waters. (It is also possible to take an express boat, but it doesn't provide a good view.)

*'''Mercado Municipal'''. n/n Rua dos Barés, +''55 92'' 3234-8441. Every day, 8AM-10PM. The city's main market is modeled after the Les Halles market in Paris.

*'''Natural Science Museum''' (''Museu de Ciencias Naturais da Amaz&ocirc;nia''). n/n Estrada Belem , Colonia Cachoeira Grande. Few locals visit this museum, know about it, or would even want to, considering that it's basically critters they'd find (almost) in their backyard. For visitors, though, it's a chance to see a live ''pirarucu'' and other fauna (mostly preserved) of the region. The museum was constructed single-handedly by a Japanese entomologist (specializing in butterflies) with his own money and resources. It's out of the way and about half an hour by taxi. The nearby '''INPA''' is a preserve and research center with birds and other wildlife.

*'''Rio Negro Palace'''. 1546 Av. 7 de Setembro , +''55 92'' 3232-4450. Call for information on attractions. The Rio Negro Palace was built by German farmers in the "golden age". Nowadays it's a cultural center and theater. It's one of the city's postcards. Prices vary.

*'''Ponta Negra Beach''' it's a nice spot,and popular river beach. It has several bars and restaurants and is some distance west of the city.

*'''Praia da Lua Beach''' very clean and nice river beach a few kilometers from Ponta Negra upstream the Rio Negro. Access by shared motorized canoe from Estalagem de David.

*'''Paricatuba Waterfall''' is on the right bank of the Negro River, along a small tributary, is formed by sedimentary rocks, surrounded by abundant vegetation. Access is by boat. The best time to visit is from August to February.

*'''Love Cascade''' is in the Guedes bayou, with cold and crystal clear water, is accessible only by boat and, then, hiking through the Forest.

* '''The National Park of Jaú''' The Park is situated in the lowland plateau in the Western Amazon and North of Amazon state, it is one of the largest National Park in Brazil and in Latin America. It is 2,272,000 hectares in size and 1,250 km of perimeter. It was created on 24th September 1980. It is of paramount importance in ecological terms for its high endemism and richness of its wild flora and fauna. Part of the Park area constitutes of varzea denominated as Pluvial Lowland. Terra firme (formlands) is divided in two: (1) large flat tops separated by shallow valleys occupying the largest area, and (2) small hills on a higher level. There are small areas which are flattened by sand sediments in the Park central part. Open Forest is predominant throughout represented by either Tidal Flat Open Palm Forest especially in varzeas (wet lands) alongside Jau and Carabinani rivers, or Tidal Flat Canopy Dense Forests. In the tidal flat areas, frequently flooded, alongside the Carabinani and Jau rivers there are a great number of palm trees such as paxiúbas (Iriarte spp), cabbage palm (Euterpe oleraceae) and Jauaria (Astrocaryon spp). In older tidal areas, rarely flooded, the predominant palms are miriti and carana (Mauritia spp). Many other tree species are found in the Park area, some of them with commercial value such as Brazilnut tree (Bertholletia excelsa), sucupira (Bowdichia virgilioides) and others.

For details on the '''Jaú National Park''' and other nearby attractions, see the ''Get out'' section below.

===Adventure trips to the rainforest===

There are a number of companies operating jungle adventure trips from Manaus, but only a few seem to be more established and reputable. 
First you need to check if the Tour Operator has a valid Embratur (Brazilian Tourism Board) registry.
Then you make up your mind what you really want.
You need to travel at least 100km from Manaus to see virgin rain forest and the wild life you are looking for.

* '''Location of trip'''
There are basically two main areas which you can explore: the Rio
Negro basin and the South of Rio Amazonas. Both of these regions are (sparsely)
inhabited, so you will not be completely isolated from civilization. If you want to
make a trip to a reserve or a remote area, ask for a special expedition package and
plan to pay much more and spend a few days for the transfer to and from the reserve.
Rio Negro is an area that is great for the jungle vegetation and for the lack of
mosquitoes (due to the acidity of the river). Unfortunately, the lack of mosquitoes
means there are a lot fewer animals that live there. The South of Rio Amazonas
is a network of rivers, lakes and channels. There are mosquitoes and wildlife, however,
there are quite a lot of houses and farms -- and thus
civilization is a lot more visible. Most tours go to or through lake [[Mamori]]. There are
quite a lot of jungle things to see around the lake, but do not expect pristine nature
due to all the farming going on around the lake. There is a reserve nearby called
[[Jurara]]. It also seems to be inhabited and there is not much difference between
the reserve and lake Mamori. A better option may be a trip to lake
[[Juma]] which is a special protected area. 

* '''Time of travel'''
There are two seasons in the Amazon basin: wet season and dry season. During the dry season it's very hot (that means 40 C plus the humidity) and thus may be unbearable for some. As well, many channels and rivers dry out. On the other hand, fishing is much easier since all fish concentrates in the remaining water basins. During the wet season, it rains almost every day. When there is a storm, the amount of rain may be overwhelming. Thus, if traveling in wet season, be prepared to get wet and not dry out until the end of your trip. During the season the rivers and lakes rise several meters and many new channels are formed in the flooded jungle. Temperature-wise, the weather is more bearable and only the humidity will be a problem. The wet season lasts roughly January to July, with the best time to visit the jungle May to August.

* '''Equipment'''
If you travel during the wet season, keep your important things like documents
in (tested) waterproof bags/containers. Cotton clothes let your skin breathe but there is
no chance that they will ever get dry. Some people find nylon/synthetic clothes to work well.
Long sleeves and long pants are not 100% necessary but you will not regret wearing them.
A flashlight is necessary for the night, as the jungle is pitch-black. A machete most probably
will not be required on short/casual trips but is essential for longer expeditions.
A lighter and a pocket knife are a good idea. The pocket knife is especially important since
it can provide the only defense against the boa and the anaconda (indeed, attacks do occur).
A mosquito repellent is most probably a very smart idea. It keeps other
bugs away too and it reduces the risk of being infected by a disease-carrying insect.
However, the number of mosquitoes in the jungle is not completely overwhelming, so for
longer expeditions you may consider getting used to them. Additionally, a good guide can show
you some natural repellents available in the jungle.
Sun block is needed especially during the dry season. Otherwise, keep your luggage to
the minimum. Do not take things you do not really need.

* '''Dictionary''' of trip operators:
** ''native people'' - people who live in the region. Most of the time that means, with Portuguese descend. These are not aboriginal inhabitants.
** ''native guide'' - a guide who is a native (see ''native people''). If at all, usually speaks only marginal English.
** ''explore the '''meeting of the waters''' '' - a 10-second chance to glance at it while crossing the river on a speedboat.

=== Tour operators ===

Do not buy tours from people at the airport or on the street in Manaus. The best guides are hired by the best companies; the best shysters don’t work for the best companies.  If you don’t want to book a tour before arriving and want to book a tour in Manaus use a reputable published guidebook first or just look for the official tourist information center (CAT), they'll help you out and even make free calls if required. Tour companies are relatively easy to find in downtown Manaus and many will meet you at no charge.

The tour companies (even the ones in Lonely Planet) tend to trick the tourists sometimes, they ask you "may I do the reservation?" if you say yes and later cancel they will want to charge you 25%. It is not legal unless they let you know about it and make you sign something, so remain alert. Ask other tour operators to check prices. 

If you take a river tour, go up the Rio Negro. From a three-night river boat trip from Manaus up the Rio Negro with a guide, you can expect to see some wildlife and visit some of the forest remnants, but two weeks or more are needed to reach untouched areas. Small two-story river boats carry five to ten people, sleeping in hammocks on the upper deck. Large boats carrying hundreds ply the river too, but the big boats don't stop between ports.
The most popular place for jungle tours is Lake [[Mamori]]/Lake [[Juma]] about 100km south of Manaus. Other recommended areas are [[Rio Urubu]] about 200 km east of and [[Novo Airão]] about 100 km northwest of Manaus. 
Make sure that your travel agency has a valid Embratur (Brazilian Tourism Board) registration.

==Stay healthy==

The climate is very hot and humid. Packing thin, light-colored clothing will help you suffer the least during the day. There are also many mosquitoes known to carry malaria and yellow fever, so wear long sleeve shirts and pants and insect repellent; The vaccine against yellow fever is free in Brazilian public health centers and international airports and must be taken at least 10 days before going to endemic areas[http://bvsms.saude.gov.br/bvs/febreamarela/viajantes.php]. There is little cotton or natural fiber clothing available in Manaus, so don’t count on being able to pick up something on short notice. People seem to prefer synthetic materials, which have the advantage of drying easily without molding.

==Stay safe==
Manaus is fairly safe for a Brazilian city of its size. As always, deserted streets are a bad idea after dark. Avoid the east zone, it has a really bad reputation.

==Get out==
*'''Bus station''' - Manaus' bus terminal is located to the north of the city. To get here by public transport from the "Centro", take any of the buses numbered 300, 448, 500, 560 or 640 and get out at the stop AFTER you pass the stadium - NOT in front of the stadium. You will pass the stadium on your left, the bus stop is in front of a cheap-looking hotel. Walk across the road towards the hotel, then along the sidewalk in the direction of the bus to petrol station at the corner. Turn right and cross the street using the overpass, the bus station is on the other side. R$3.

*[[Presidente Figueiredo]] – 105 km from Manaus, offers archaeological grottoes and caves, waterfalls, and native scenery.
*[[Sao Gabriel da Cachoeira]] - Home of many Indian tribes and the Pico da Neblina, the highest mountain in Brazil.
