Downtown Detroit is unique: an International Riverfront [http://www.detroitriverfront.org/], ornate buildings, sculptures, fountains, the nation's second largest theater district, and one of the nation's largest collection of pre-depression era skyscrapers. Two major traffic circles along Woodward Avenue surround Campus Martius Park and Grand Circus Park, both gathering points. The city has ample parking much of it in garages. Many historic buildings have been converted into loft apartments, and over sixty new businesses have opened in the Central Business District over the past two years. Downtown Detroit features the Renaissance Center, including the tallest hotel in the Western Hemisphere, the Detroit Marriott, with the largest rooftop restaurant, Coach Insignia. Many restaurants emanate from the Renaissance Center, Greektown, the arts and theatre district, and stadium area. Joining the eastern, riverfront parks, the city has the 982-acre (3.9&nbsp;km²; 2.42&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) Belle Isle Park with the large James Scott Memorial Fountain, historic conservatory, gardens, and spectacular views of the city skyline.

Visitors may reserve a public dock downtown at the Tri-Centennial State Park and Harbor. Great Lakes Cruises are also available. Surrounding neighborhoods such as Corktown, home to Detroit's early Irish population, New Center [http://www.newcenter.com/], Midtown, and Eastern Market [http://www.easternmarket.org/] (the nation's largest open air market), are experiencing a revival. Detroit has a rich architectural heritage, such as the recently restored historic Westin Book-Cadillac Hotel, the Guardian and Fisher buildings with exquisitely ornate interiors and exteriors, the Detroit Institute of Arts (top five museums in the country) to name a few. In 2005, Detroit's architecture was heralded as some of America's finest; many of the city's architecturally significant buildings are listed by the National Trust for Historic Preservation as among America's most endangered landmarks.

Detroit is the largest city in the U.S. to offer casino resorts. The three major casino resorts are MGM Grand Detroit, Greektown, and MotorCity. With Caesars just across the river in Windsor, Ontario, Canada.  Detroit Metro Airport is one of the few to offer world class hotel and meeting facilities inside the terminal. The Renaissance Center and the Southfield Town Center are among the nation's finest mixed use facilities for large conferences. Downtown Detroit serves as the cultural and entertainment hub of the metropolitan region, [[Windsor (Ontario)|Windsor]], [[Ontario]], and even for [[Toledo (Ohio)|Toledo]], [[Ohio]] residents, many of whom work in metropolitan Detroit. While most of the region's attractions are in the city of Detroit, tourists will find that nearly all of the shopping malls are located in suburbs, such as Troy. The Detroit-Windsor metro area population totals about 5.9 million; it jumps to 6.5 million if Toledo is included. An estimated 46 million people live within a 300 mi (480 km) radius of Detroit. The city's northern inner ring suburbs like [[Ferndale]], Southfield, [[Royal Oak]], and [[Birmingham]] provide an urban experience in the suburbs complete with dining, shopping and other attractions. The Detroit area has many regal mansions, within the city and especially in Grosse Pointe, Bloomfield Hills, and Birmingham.  Ann Arbor provides the nearby experience of a college town.

Detroit is an international destination for sporting events of all types; patrons enjoy their experience in world class venues. The Detroit Convention and Visitors bureau maintains the Detroit Metro Sports Commission [http://www.detroitsports.org/]. The city and region have state of the art facilities for major conferences and conventions.

Detroit is known as the world's "Automobile Capital" and "The Motor City”, where Henry Ford pioneered the automotive assembly line, with the world's first mass produced car, the Model T. and “Motown” for its world renowned music performers featuring The Supremes, Stevie Wonder, Smokey Robinson and others. During World War II, President Franklin Roosevelt called Detroit the "Arsenal of Democracy." Today, the region serves as the global center for the automotive world. Headquartered in metro Detroit, General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler all have major corporate, manufacturing, engineering, design, and research facilities in the area. Hyundai, Toyota, Nissan, among others, have a presence in the region. The University of Michigan in Ann Arbor is a global leader in research and development. Metro Detroit has made Michigan's economy a leader in information technology, life sciences, and advanced manufacturing. Michigan ranks fourth nationally in high tech employment with 568,000 high tech workers, including  70,000 in the automotive industry. Michigan typically ranks among the top three states for overall research and development investment expenditures in the US. 

===Climate===

Detroit's climate is continental, therefore subject to rapid change and a variety of weather. Winters are snowy and very cold, with an even colder wind-chill factor. Snow usually doesn't remain the entire winter. Spring and fall are normally pleasant but colder temperatures will likely creep in during late fall and remain during early spring. Summer is rather short, but often times it is hot and muggy with sometimes strong to occasionally severe thunderstorms.

===Orientation===

Detroit is bordered to the south by the Detroit River, which divides the US and Canada. Detroit is the only place in the continental US where you have to go south to enter Canada. Downtown is adjacent to the riverfront, so the rest of the city expands north, east, and west from downtown.  For major roads, the Detroit area is laid out in wheel-and-spoke configuration downtown, strip-farm configuration along the river front, and grid pattern elsewhere. Woodward Avenue runs northwest-southeast (more or less) and divides the northern half of Detroit into east and west; West Warren Street, for instance, becomes East Warren Street when it crosses Woodward. The wheel-and-spoke configuration was designed in the 18th century for tactical reasons when Detroit was a fort. Mile roads run east-west, start north of downtown Detroit and continuing through Macomb and Oakland counties. These mile roads may not have their traditional street name in some suburban areas.

'''Detroit Metro Airport''' ({{IATA|DTW}}) [http://www.metroairport.com/]  is in Romulus, about 20 minutes west of the city proper, located at the junction between I-275 and I-94 with many nearby hotels. The airport is a major Delta hub and operational headquarters, so it offers direct flights to and from a surprising variety of cities, from Seattle to Mexico City, London, Amsterdam, Paris, Tokyo, Seoul, Beijing, and Shanghai. The terminal offers Delta SkyClubs as well as a Westin Hotel and conference center. The midfield McNamara Terminal serves Delta and its SkyTeam partners; all other carriers utilize the new Evans Terminal. For convenience, the McNamara Terminal and Evans Terminals have both domestic and international gates in the same terminal. An enclosed tram system shuttles travelers in the McNamara Terminal. There is a free shuttle between the terminals: look for blue and white vans that say "Westin - Terminal." The airport is one of the most recently modernized in the US, with six major runways.

The quickest way to get to downtown Detroit is to rent a car, take an uber, or taxi. Standard cab fare to downtown is $45-$50.  Standard Uber fare is $31-40.  For McNamara terminal, go to ground transportation and walk across the metrocab area.  You can also get to Detroit using the SMART (suburban) mass transit bus system [http://www.smartbus.org]. Route 125 serves the airport approximately every half hour, beginning alternately at the Smith and McNamara terminals (no bus serves both terminals), and takes about 75 min to get downtown. The fare is $2.00. Familiarize yourself with the route map and schedule before you try this–-it is more commonly used by workers at the airport than tourists.

Airport Shuttle and Taxi services are available by reservation. Reservations 9a-9p (313) 759-7741. Rates from Detroit Metropolitan Airport to downtown Detroit are $49.00 + $10.00 Airport Fee. Detroit Metropolitan Airport charges a $10.00 fee to all licensed transportation providers this fee to pick up passengers at the airport.

===By car===
Several interstates converge in downtown Detroit. I-75/the Chrysler (north of Downtown)/the Fisher (south of Downtown) Freeway North/South runs from [[Toledo (Ohio)|Toledo]] through downtown Detroit to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. I-94/the Ford Freeway East/West runs from [[Chicago]] to Detroit and continues up to Sarnia. I-96 East/West heads from Detroit to [[Lansing (Michigan)|Lansing]], Michigan. I-696/the Reuther Freeway runs along about 3 mi north of city limit (8 Mile), connecting the eastern suburbs (such as St. Clair Shores) to Southfield. I-275 connects with the suburb of Livonia.  Highways, the Lodge Freeway, M-14, M-23, and the Southfield Freeway are major freeways which interconnect with the Interstates in the Detroit metro area to ease navigation. The Southfield Freeway connects Dearborn to Southfield. The Lodge Freeway, connects Southfield to downtown. Highway M-14 connects Ann Arbor to Detroit via the Jeffries Expressway. Bypassing Ann Arbor, highway M-23 connects I-94 to I-96. 

The metro area's major Interstates and freeways were overhauled in preparation the 2006 National Football League Super Bowl XL in Detroit and are in good condition.  

As with any major city, traffic during rush hour can make travel really slow. This is especially aggravated during shift changes at the local automotive plants. But due to economic hardships for the region, rush hour traffic lasts less than an hour, and some freeways are clear all day. The Mixing Bowl, I-75/696 interchange, the I-94/Ford Freeway through Detroit, and the Southfield Freeway can be slow in late afternoons. However some freeways can be congested. 

The following freeways have chronic congestion in the morning and evening rush:
*'''Northbound I-75''': Between 8 Mile and 12 Mile
*'''Southbound I-75''': Between Rochester Curve and I-696
*'''Westbound I-696''': Dequindre Curve to Woodward; Coolidge Highway out the Mixing Bowl; Drake Rd. to I-96.
*'''Eastbound I-696''': Mixing Bowl to Woodward Ave.; Groesbeck Highway to I-94
*'''Westbound I-96''': Off of I-696 to Wixom Rd. (due in part to the growing urban sprawl in the area)
*'''Eastbound I-94''': Warren Ave. to Mt. Elliott St.
*'''Westbound I-94''': 12 Mile to I-696; Connor to Jeffries Freeway

For smaller streets, the Detroit area is laid out in wheel-and-spoke, grid, and strip-farm configuration. This was due to first French development (strip farms along the river), early city layout (wheel and spoke from the river's edge), followed by the modern North/South grid. Mile roads run east-west, starting at downtown Detroit and increasing as you travel north. These mile roads may change name in different cities, so pay attention. There are also several spoke roads, including Woodward Ave, Michigan Ave, Gratiot Ave, and Grand River Ave. Only in the old downtown business district is the original Washington D.C./L'Enfant-style wheel and spoke layout found (it is quite confusing, with several one-way streets added for fun). In areas along the River and Lake St. Clair, the colonial-era French practice of allocating strips of land with water access is seen as main roads parallel the water, and secondary roads perpendicular to it. This is very confusing to non-residents.

===By bus===
*'''Greyhound''' [http://www.greyhound.com].  Service west to [[Chicago]] (5-8 h, $35), east to [[Toronto]] (5-6 h), and south to [[Toledo (Ohio)|Toledo]] (1 h, $15), as well as all over Michigan. The terminal is near downtown at 1001 Howard St.

===By train===
*'''Amtrak''', 11 W Baltimore Ave (''at Woodward''), [http://www.amtrak.com]. Train service to and from [[Chicago]] on the ''[[Wolverine Service]]'' (5-6 hours, $25-$50), with many connections in Chicago. Deeply discounted tickets are often available at Amtrak's weekly specials page [http://tickets.amtrak.com/itd/amtrak/WeeklySpecials]. For travel to the east, a bus is available to the Toledo Amtrak station, with connecting trains to [[New York City|New York]] (21 hours, $75-$150) and [[Washington, D.C.]] (16 hours, $65-$130), but travelers may find the middle-of-the-night departures unappealing. The train station is located in the New Center neighborhood.

===From Ontario, Canada===
U.S. and Canadian citizens are required to present a passport, passport card, enhanced driver's license, or trusted traveler card when crossing the US-Canada border. For more detailed identification requirements, visit [http://www.getyouhome.gov/html/eng_map.html Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI)]. Although it is efficient for an international border, this is the busiest crossing between the two countries, with frequent delays. 

There are two ways to get to Detroit from Windsor:
* <see name="Ambassador Bridge" alt="" address="" directions="accessible from Huron Church Road, which connects to the 401" phone="" url="http://www.ambassadorbridge.com" hours="" price="Toll per passenger car: $4 (US or Canadian)" lat="" long="" email="" fax="">Bridge traffic can be congested, due to the high number of 18-wheelers. Expect wait times of 30 minutes.</see>
* <see name="Detroit-Windsor Tunnel" address="" directions="accessible from downtown Windsor" phone="" email="" fax="" url="http://www.dwtunnel.com" hours="" price="Toll per passenger car: $4.00 (US), $4.75 (Canadian)">Every time traffic backs up in the tunnel the tunnel is shut down until traffic congestion is eased, which can sometimes take quite a while. A "tunnel bus" connects downtown Detroit with Windsor for the price of $4.50 (Either CAD or USD) or for concerts, Ford Field and Comerica Park the tunnel bus fare raises to $5.00 (??Either US or Canadian). The tunnel bus has its pros saving you money from parking on either side of the border, but the customs/immigrations process can be quite lengthy for bus riders as everyone on the bus must disembark and be cleared through customs.</see>

Pedestrians cannot walk across the bridge or through the tunnel, they must use the tunnel bus. Bicyclists are also prohibited from using the bridge and the tunnel and may use the bike racks. The only way someone traveling by bike can bring their bike across the border is to disassemble the bike and put it in a bike bag, which can be brought on the bus.

==Get around== 

===By car===
Detroit spreads over a large area, it is difficult to be without a car. An extensive freeway system and ample parking make the region one of the most auto-friendly in North America. Detroit has one of America's most modern freeway systems.  See the Michigan Department of Transportation [http://www.michigan.gov/mdot] website for a current listing of downtown road closures and construction projects. Downtown has parking garages in strategic locations.

Greektown Casino, located [[Detroit/Downtown|downtown]], has a free 13 floor parking garage. Visitors are welcome to pay to park at the Renaissance Center garage. There are plenty of pay-to-park garages, lots, and valet near the Greektown/stadium areas. Premium parking right next to the stadium is well worth the extra price and usually available during a game. Downtown has an ease of entry from the freeways that may surprise new visitors. Valet parking is available at four Renaissance Center locations, the main Winter Garden entrance along the Riverfront, the Jefferson Avenue lobby, Marriott hotel entrance west, and Seldom Blues entrance west.

Detroit has an abundance of taxi, limo, and shuttle services. Car rental prices are reasonable.

While MDOT has since discontinued emphasis on the names of freeways, most locals still cling to their names. Make sure you have an atlas with the names as many road s change names as you go along them.

The Mixing Bowl is the confluence of the Lodge/Northwestern, the Reuther, Telegraph Rd, and Franklin Rd. The Spaghetti Bowl is the confluence of 96/275, the Reuther, the M-5, and the Haggerty Connector. The Junction is the confluence of the Jeffries, 275, and M-14 on the far west side suburbs. The Triangle is the beginning of the Jeffries at the Fisher Freeway. The Interchange is the interchange of the Reuther and the Chrysler Freeways. Many freeways bend and because of this many bends are called Curves:

*9 Mile Curve, Gardenia Curve, Rochester Curve, Big Beaver Curve, Crooks Curve all on I-75
*Dequindre Curve on I-696
*Mound Curve on I-696
*Wyoming Curve and Linwood Curve on the Lodge Freeway
*Fisher/Chrysler Curve: Near downtown Detroit, I-75 makes one of the sharpest turns in the interstate system. It is also the change between the Fisher Freeway and Chrysler Freeway. So if you are going north on the curve it is the Chrysler Curve, if south, the Fisher Curve.

Unlike in most other US cities, traffic signals change to yellow while the pedestrian signal ("hand") is still flashing.  Exercise caution at intersections to avoid hitting pedestrians scrambling to cross the street when the signal is yellow.

===On foot or by bicycle===
A car is helpful for getting around the rest of the city, but due to the unusual layout and large number of one-way streets, getting out and walking for a few blocks is a good way to see downtown. 

Bike rentals are available in downtown Detroit along the International Riverfront at Rivard Plaza from '''Wheelhouse Detroit'''[http://www.wheelhousedetroit.com/]. There is also a public bike share available in Downtown and Midtown called '''MoGo'''[https://mogodetroit.org/]. If you go the kiosk, you pay $8 to use the bike for 24 hours.  You are given a 5 digit code that can unlock a bike.  However each ride can only be 30 minutes, and you get charged an extra $4 if you exceed the 30 minute window.  To save money, you can buy a monthly pass online for $18 (this option is not available at the kiosk).  Like bike shares in other cities, day, week, and annual passes can be bought which allow unlimited 30-minute rides between stations.  Download the cyclefinder app to find the locations of where you can pick-up and drop off the bicycle.  Also, bicycles are allowed on the new Q-line (just be sure to store it vertically).

Detroit is one of the best cities for biking, with a thriving bike culture. Streets are flat and have usually multiple lanes in each direction. Motorists are used to bikes on the road and are usually courteous. The city has made an effort to increase the number of bike lanes, though you will find an occasional parked car.

Detroit is home to many budding bike co-ops, the most active is  '''The Hub of Detroit'''[http://thehubofdetroit.org/], and its sister program Back-Alley Bikes. Back-Alley Bikes has weekly volunteer nights, and monthly women and transgender bike workshops. 

There are two major regular group rides visitors should check out. '''Slow Roll'''[http://slowroll.bike/index.php] is a big community ride every Monday from roughly May to September. Check the website for each week's starting point.  '''Detroit Critical Mass'''[http://www.facebook.com/groups/71297671024/] is held on the last Friday of every month. Check the location and time before you meet-up. Attendance varies with season.

Always exercise caution while biking, as aggressive driving and speeding can be common.

===By bus===
The '''Detroit Department of Transportation''' [http://www.detroitmi.gov/DepartmentsandAgencies/DetroitDepartmentofTransportation.aspx] provides mass transit bus service within the city of Detroit. Downtown has a the new Rosa Parks Transit Center. DDOT buses are yellow and green. For safety, DDOT buses may be patrolled by the Wayne County sheriff's deputies. 17 routes serve the central bus terminal, which is downtown at Cass Street and Michigan Avenue. The standard fare $1.50; transfers are $0.25.

In addition, people traveling throughout Detroit and the suburbs may use the SMART bus system, which services most areas in metro Detroit. [http://www.smartbus.org/smart/home]. Standard fare is $2.00 and a transfer is $0.25.  SMART only operates within the city limits Monday-Friday during morning and evening commute times.

===By elevated rail===

[[Image: IMG_2407.jpg |right|thumb|People Mover]]

Detroit does not have a elevated/subway network that covers the entire city. In 1987, the '''People Mover''' [http://www.thepeoplemover.com/] was completed, an automated, elevated rail system that runs a three mile loop in the downtown area. It is the best way to get around the downtown area. A round trip excursion, covering 13 stations, takes approximately 20 min, and offers great views of the city's downtown landmarks. Signature stops include the Renaissance Center (GM HQ & Retail Complex), Greektown, Joe Louis Arena (the now-demolished previous home of the Detroit Red Wings), TCF Center (formerly called Cobo Center), and Cadillac Center (Campus Martius Park). The stations feature original works by local artists. Standard fare $0.75 in cash, and a token can also be bought at the same price.  The people mover only travels in one direction (think of it more as a monorail).

===By streetcar===

Opened in 2017, the '''QLine''' [https://qlinedetroit.com/] is a streetcar line that runs from Downtown up Woodward avenue to New Center. Fare is $1.50 for 3 hours, with day, month, and annual passes available.  [http://www.mlive.com/news/detroit/index.ssf/2017/06/qline_extends_free_rides_throu.html]

===Groceries and other basics===

Detroit does not really have a lot of retail options within the city and as a result most city residents tend to head to the suburbs to do any major shopping. Thankfully this has started to change somewhat with a few local independently owned supermarkets opening up and the opening of a Whole Foods Market in Midtown, two Aldi stores, and two Meijer stores means that Detroit no longer has the dubious distinction of being the largest city in the US without a chain grocery store. The major drug store chains such as CVS and Walgreens in addition to convenience stores such as 7-11 however do have a few locations scattered throughout the city.

Detroit is world famous for the coney, a hot dog with chili, mustard, and chopped fresh onions.  The most known coney restaurants are the American Coney Island and Lafayette Coney Island, both located next door to each other in downtown Detroit. The two restaurants have had a rivalry since the 1920s. Coney Island style restaurants can be found all over Detroit. Local chains such as National Coney Island and Leo's Coney Island serve suburban areas outside the city limits.

Detroit-style pizza is a delicious and crispy deep dish pizza that you can't truly find outside of Michigan. It is not quite as thick as Chicago-style pizza, but the buttery crust is worth seeking out. The Detroit classic is Buddy's Pizza restaurants chain, with numerous locations a half hour drive from the city. In downtown, numerous restaurants serve Detroit-style pizza, including Niki's Pizza.

Explore Detroit's Greektown, with its Greek restaurants and shops surrounding the Greektown Casino. Detroit's Mexicantown is known for Mexican cuisine at restaurants such as Mexican Village, Evie's Tamales, El Zocalo and Xochimilco. Restaurants, bakeries, and shops are located on Vernor Highway, on both the east and west sides of the Interstate 75 service drive. Hamtramck is famous for its Polish cuisine and bakeries and neighboring Dearborn is known for it's wide selection of restaurants serving Lebanese and Arabic fare. Choose to dine in elegance at one of Detroit's many fine restaurants a sample of which include the Coach Insignia atop the Renaissance Center Downtown, the Whitney House restaurant in Midtown, or the Opus One in the New Center.

==Stay safe==
Despite an improving crime rate in recent years, Detroit remains the most dangerous major city in the United States. Many neighborhoods within the Detroit city limits, including some relatively close to the downtown core, have high crime rates and should be avoided. Many areas in the city also suffer from extensive urban decay. 

When travelling through Detroit, sticking to major roads and freeways is key to avoiding unnecessary problems. Carjacking, while uncommon, can occur in dangerous and isolated neighborhoods. Also noteworthy are the aggressive, sometimes violent confrontations that can occur after car accidents, especially involving pedestrians. 

However, despite these obvious problems, most tourist attractions are in the safe downtown and midtown neighborhoods. In fact, the overall crime rate in the downtown area is below the national average, and crime has largely declined in the revitalized area in the last twenty years. [http://www.tedconline.com/uploads/DMCVB_June_Final_Report.pdf] But, even with the declining crime rate, one should be aware opportunistic crimes can and do occur in downtown and midtown, and some precautions should be taken when out after dark, including staying in groups and not carrying large amounts of money. Typically, how you carry yourself can easily keep you from getting mugged.

Unfortunately for the arts and music lover, much of the current scene is scattered between downtown venues like the Majestic Theater/Magic Stick complex, places in Hamtramck, and suburban venues in places like Royal Oak. Some venues, such as Harpo's on the east side, are in dangerous neighborhoods. Other attractions, including Fort Wayne and The Heidelberg Project, are also in unsafe areas.

Sporting events, festivals and other large public events are always heavily policed and typically safe. Sporadic crime events, mostly alcohol-related and involving groups of youths, have been reported at some of these events but they are by far the exception.

Unlike the inner city, suburban Detroit is remarkably safe and has several sights worth seeing. The Detroit Zoo, Greenfield Village, and The Henry Ford Museum are all in low crime neighborhoods.  Unsafe suburban areas are typically far away from any tourist attractions and have little to no interest for the typical traveler. Nevertheless, however, '''NEVER''' enter impoverished neighborhoods outside of downtown Detroit that are known to have dilapidated and mostly abandoned houses and it is '''far less''' safe to enter at night due to increased gang activity, and there is a high chance that you can be a serious victim of carjacking or worse, murder, if you find yourself surrounded by armed and dangerous hoodlums and police rarely patrol these kinds of areas.

==Cope==

Driving on major roads and freeways in Detroit can be a stressful task. Motorists typically drive 20-30mph above the legal speed limit, which is 25 or 30mph on urban collectors/major roads and 55-70 mph on freeways. Traffic signals are often ignored, especially at night and in poor neighborhoods outside the downtown area. It is advisable to avoid driving in Detroit if you are a new and inexperienced driver or feel hazardous while going at very high speeds. Road accidents are a common experience, some which are fatal. Additionally, these kinds of drivers disregard safety of others, and are also increasingly hostile and are not hesitant to incite road rage, and police presence is rare even in the downtown area. Emergency services are quick at responding to accidents on Interstate highways and freeways, but long waits and delays can occur in some neighborhoods of Detroit due to limited resources and poor funding.

If you find yourself a victim or witness of a crime, be sure to contact the Detroit Police Department at (313) 267-4600 as soon as it is safe to do so, or dial 911 if in an emergency. If your passport or personal identification are stolen, this should be reported immediately to the Detroit Police Department and your federal government to prevent identity fraud. Assault victims with injuries should go to an emergency room to have said injuries documented, even if they are minor in nature. Victims of crime who are not American citizens should also contact their country's embassy and report details of the event.

==Get out==

===Michigan===

Although Detroit itself provides the majority of the region's visitor attractions, the entire Southeast Michigan area is large and diverse and contains a great wealth of hot spots and attractions that are also well worth visiting.

*[[Ann Arbor]] - Home to the University of Michigan [http://www.umich.edu], Ann Arbor offers many attractions of a self-enclosed small city. A thriving downtown, lots of culture, and plenty of students. Cannabis possession in this city outside of University of Michigan property is only a 25 dollar fine, making this one of the most liberal cities in Michigan. Canoeing is a favorite pastime on the Huron River, available through Metro parks [http://www.metroparks.com/Huron-Clinton] near Ann Arbor.  Additionally, the city boasts the number one rated Ann Arbor Street Art Fair [http://www.artfair.org] which attracts over 500,000 attendees from across the nation each July.  Enjoy the Beach at Kensington Metropark, or winter skiing at nearby Mt. Holly, and Brighton.

*[[Dearborn]] - Detroit's suburb to the Southwest and home of Ford Motor Company, Dearborn, has a leading attraction, '''The Henry Ford''' (the Henry Ford Museum & Greenfield Village)   [http://www.hfmgv.org/] a large historical and entertainment complex, and the '''Automotive Hall of Fame.'''  Dearborn has the second largest Middle-Eastern population in the World, with mosques being a common sight and a wide selection of Middle-Eastern food and shopping. Detroit's public information campaign, "The World is Coming, Get in the Game" has created an online tour (see section "Do" for the link) of Dearborn's cultural scene.

*[[Flint]] - The home of the modern labor union movement in the U.S.  While not as tourist-friendly as Ann Arbor, Flint has a great art scene for a city of its size and is much less pretentious.

*[[Grand Rapids]] - Michigan's second largest city. With a skyline filled with construction cranes, many believe Grand Rapids is Michigan's future. With a great, clean downtown area and the city's proximity to Lake Michigan, Grand Rapids is a grand experience waiting to happen.

*'''Lake St. Clair''' and the '''St. Clair River''' -  Waterfront activities and living are among the luxuries of the metropolitan Detroit area. Experience cruises and boating on beautiful Lake St. Clair. The St. Clair River connects Lake St. Clair to Lake Huron. In the quiet town of St. Clair, along the St. Clair River, dine at the ''Voyager'' Seafood restaurant at 525 South Riverside. Enjoy the charm of a small town lifestyle in a major metropolitan area in and around Lake St. Clair's Anchor Bay [http://www.anchorbaychamber.com/].  Visitors to downtown Detroit may reserve a dock at Tri-Centennial State Park and Harbor [http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,1607,7-153-10365_24648-94491--,00.html]. Or enjoy a Great Lakes cruise [http://www.greatlakescruisingcoalition.com/cruises.html].

*[[Royal Oak]] - Home to the beautifully landscaped Detroit Zoo, Royal Oak is a gay friendly suburb outside of Detroit which boasts a classy night scene with exciting dining and a diverse avant-garde bar culture. 

*[[Troy_(Michigan)|Troy]] - Troy, a suburb of Detroit, contains the Somerset Collection, one of the largest upscale malls in the Midwest. Visit Nordstom, Macy's, Henri Bendel, Ralph Lauren/Polo, Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, Tiffany & Co, Barney's New York, and more than 180 other specialty shops. Follow Big Beaver Road east as it becomes the Metropolitan Parkway toward Metropolitan Beach on beautiful Lake St. Clair.

===Ohio===
*[[Toledo (Ohio)|Toledo]], [[Ohio]] is about an hour south on the DT Expressway (I-75). This mid-sized city is on the edge of Lake Erie, which offers numerous nearby recreational opportunities. The city is a good destination for restaurant and architecture buffs. Toledo also boasts a nationally known art museum and zoo, and is a regional center for alternative energy research and development.

*[[Cedar Point]] located in Sandusky, OH is about an hour east of Toledo, this action packed amusement park is routinely ranked among the best in the world.

===Ontario===

*[[Windsor (Ontario)|Windsor]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] lies just across the Ambassador Bridge or through the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel, which is located right next to the Renaissance Center (good to use if you see traffic backed up onto I-75).  This heavily trafficked border crossing has shaped Windsor more than anything else; well-maintained, walkable streets, shops and restaurants, Caesars Windsor casino, and adult entertainment. The lower drinking age (19) draws young Americans and ensures a vibrant club scene on weekends. Windsor provides great views of Detroit's skyline, especially on summer nights from waterfront Dieppe Park. Crossing the border requires a passport, enhanced driver's license, or a trusted traveler card.
