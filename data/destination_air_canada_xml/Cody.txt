{{pagebanner|Wikitravel Cody Banner.jpg}}
'''Cody''' is in [[Northwest Wyoming]], close to the east side [[Yellowstone National Park]]. Unlike Jackson, with its pet spas and high-end shopping, Cody is more authentically ''cowboy''. Cody is famous for its rodeo, which occurs nightly during the summer, and for its proximity to fantastic wilderness adventures in Yellowstone and in the national forests surrounding the park.

==Understand==
* '''Buffalo Bill Dam and Cody Visitor Center''' Six miles away from the Eastern Yellowstone entrance is the [http://www.bbdvc.org/ visitor center] that covers Cody and the Buffalo Bill Dam. There's not a tremendous amount of information, but it's a decent stopover if you're between hikes. 

==Get in==

===By plane===
You can fly into Cody via the [http://www.flyyra.com/index.php Yellowstone Regional Airport]. Pre-Covid, Delta Express flew here via [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]] but stopped due to pilot shortage during the summer of 2023, so worth checking. United Express flies here via [[Denver]].  Billings is not too far away (about 2 hrs) and is served by Delta among others.

===By car===

Car trips to Cody are a bit long, but you're rewarded with beautiful scenery.

* From the NORTH - MT 310 connects I-90 with WYO 120 from Billings, Montana.

*From the WEST - Through Jackson, Wyoming and Yellowstone National Park on WY 191 to WY 14-16-20, the Buffalo Bill Cody Scenic Byway to Cody.

==Get around==
Given Cody's rather remote location and the activities you've come to Cody to enjoy, you will want a car to get around.

==See==
* '''Buffalo Bill Center of the West''', 720 Sheridan Avenue, 307/587.4771, [https://centerofthewest.org/]. One center offers up five different museums. The Plains Indian Museum is award-winning, and the Whitney Gallery of Western Art has many stunning pieces by Bierstadt, Russell, Remington and more, the Natural History Museum is vast and comprehensive, and the Firearms Museum is immense, and the centerpiece is an extensive museum of the life and accomplishments of the namesake Buffalo Bill Cody.  The gift store is excellent.
  
* '''Cody Stampede Rodeo and Cody Nite Rodeo''', From June 1 to August 31, the [http://www.codystampederodeo.com/events_codyniterodeo.html Cody Nite Rodeo] runs every evening with bull riding, steer wrestling and more.

*'''Dude Ranches''', there are several ranches in and around Cody that offer horseback riding and ranching experiences. Many of them are close to Yellowstone National Park, so you can piece together two different types of trips. One of the many ranches is K3 Guest Ranch [http://www.k3guestranch.com/].

==Buy==
There are a large number of excellent outfitters and merchants in Cody appealing to the visitor and resident alike.  These include the Yellowstone Gift Shop, Sunshine Outfitters, Legends Bookstore, the Chamber of Commerce local artists co-op, and many more, mostly along Sheridan, which is the main drag through town.

Cody also offers the only Walgreens and Wal-Mart within 90 miles, both of them very well stocked and staffed.

Albertsons is where the locals shop, and it has wonderful selection.  The daily fresh-made guacamole is to die for.

==Eat==
* '''Grannys''', 1550 Sheridan Ave, ''+1 307'' 587-4829. This easy-to-miss, old-school establishment is a local reference for breakfast. Excellent value. Close to the Holliday Inn and Walgreens.  Gets crowded sometimes.  Junior and senior lunch and breakfast specials. Excellent cinnamon and caramel rolls.  Known for pancakes. Bacon and link sausages are amazing.  Service is great.  If you are alone, try to get a spot at the community table on the left where the local news is traded daily.
* '''Proud Cut Saloon''', 1227 Sheridan Avenue, ''+1 307'' 527-6905. This is one of Cody's most famous restaurants. Don't be surprised to find yourself eating a great cut of meat out on a patio with plastic table coverings. Proud Cut is more about good food than fancy surroundings.
* '''Zapata's''', 1362 Sheridan Avenue, ''+1 307'' 527-7181. Zapata's is located at the end of Cody's business district. The Mexican food isn't bad, but the margaritas and beer are great after a long day's hike.

* '''Holiday Inn''', 1701 Sheridan Ave, ''+1 307'' 587-5555, [http://www.ichotelsgroup.com/h/d/hi/1/en/hd/codwy].  This hotel is a favorite of tour groups.  They have a great team.  They have handled the gamut of customer situations and needs.  It's vintage Holiday Inn (no free breakfast, but Granny's is practically across the street and another Cody institution).  Not cheap.  You can often get a better deal if you stay in one of their cabins (free standing units in back).  The Cody Holiday Inn sits on old camp and rodeo grounds from before trees in Cody.  Convenient to everything in the downtown.
