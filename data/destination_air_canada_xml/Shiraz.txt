{{pagebanner|Shiraz Banner.jpg}}

'''Shiraz'''  [http://www.eshiraz.ir/main/en/index] (شیراز) is the capital city of [[Fars]] province and a treasure trove of Persian culture. It is also the former capital of [[Iran]], during the Zand dynasty's era (1747-79), and also the celebrated birthplace of the great Persian poets Hafiz and Saadi. It is also been said to be the origin of one of the most popular grape variety called Syrah. The city has a population of about 1,300,000.

==Understand==
===Climate=== 
Shiraz has a hot semi-arid climate with large temperature differences between winter and summer. Despite being at the same latitude as [[Cairo]] and central [[Florida]], Shiraz features quite chilly winters and the average low temperatures is -0.4°C (31.3°F), while afternoons remain cool at about 12°C (53°F). Cold waves don't usually dip that south in the country, but nighttime lows can occasionally fall below -5°C (23°F). The record low is -14°C (6°F). Most precipitation also falls between November and April, mostly in the form of rain as snowfalls are very uncommon. Summers on the other hand, can become hot, but not to the extent of cities such as [[Ahvaz]] or [[Bandar Abbas]]. Temperatures usually range from 36°C-38°C (97°F-100°F) to 19°C-21°C (67°F-70°F). The record high is 43°C (109°F) and above 40°C (104°F) can be expected during heat waves.

==Get in==
===By plane===

There are International flights to [[Istanbul]], [[Dubai]], [[Sharjah]], [[Kuwait]], [[Doha]]: Turkish Airlines operating daily direct flight from Istanbul to Shiraz and vice versa; Qatar Airways flies 4 times a week (on Sundays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays) from Doha to Shiraz and vice versa; Air Arabia operates Daily Flight between Sharjah (UAE) and Shiraz; Iran Aseman Airlines Flies once a week (on Fridays) from Shiraz to Muscat and vice versa; several daily flights are available between Shiraz and Dubai operating by Iran Air, Iran Aseman Airlines and Fly Dubai; there are some weekly Flights between Shiraz and Kuwait City; BoraJet is planning to fly between Istanbul and Shiraz and Fly Baghdad will operate a weekly flight (on Tuesdays) between Najaf (Iraq) and Shiraz soon; there are some charter weekly flights between Antalya (with an hour stop in Adana) and Shiraz operating by Freebird Airlines. These charter flights usually operated from mid-March until late September.   

As the metro have not reached the Dastgheib roundabout there is a shuttle bus running from Namazi to the airport. Number is 110 and runs about every 15th minutes. Number 120 (minibus with yellow stripe and approximately 10 seats, located at the outside of the Namazi roundabout/first platform of the bus station) also runs from Namazi on the main street through Shiraz to the airport. Price is 10000 Real.

===By bus===
Shiraz is well connected to most parts of the country by bus. The main Karandish bus terminal is 4 km from the city center. 
Buses to Yazd take 6 hours; to Isfahan it is 7 hours. Prices vary as there are different companies and different types of buses. A standard bus to Yazd may cost IRR220,000. There are two kinds of VIP buses: one with 24 seats (IRR350,000), one with 36 seats (IRR250,000). To Isfahan IRR360,000 for a VIP bus. Information: Jan 2017

===By car===
Motorways connect the city to [[Isfahan]], [[Kerman]], [[Bushehr]], [[Ahvaz]] and [[Yasouj]], and [[Bandar-e Abbas]] is reachable by highway.
===By train ===
Shiraz Train station has recently been finished and there are Trains to Tehran but not to Esfahan (Oct 2015). However, the bus journey is shorter (2hrs less), so that might be recommended. There is a connecting bus from the train station to GhasroDasht bus and metro station. Price in Aug. 2015 was 10,000 rial for single ticket.

==Get around==
There is a tourist information on the main boulevard a bit west of the palace. They speak English and can give helpful tips and have English maps. 

For non-Iranian visitors, taxis are probably the most convenient mean of transport. There is not a lot of room for haggling as prices are more or less fixed. Ask locals who take taxis about what the price should be and agree with the driver before you get into the car.

If an unmarked car stops while you are hailing a taxi, don't be alarmed. Many taxis in Shiraz are unmarked and also as a means to supplement their income, is not uncommon to find private car owners touting themselves as taxis. 

However it is always good to find a taxi through a reputable "telephone taxi" agency. For a set fee, drivers of these agencies will take passengers to their destination, drive them around town and also wait for them while they shop or run errands. All hotels and local residents will have a phone number of one these agencies. There are also taxis driven by women that specifically cater to women passengers.

The city also has a reasonable bus service.

Shiraz metro is operating with a single line between Shahid Dastgheyb (next to airport) and Ehsan stations. Single ticket costs 5000 rials and a train every 15 minutes

==Talk==
Dont hesitate to talk to people, especially educated youths. Almost all of them speak English well enough to talk to you, answer your questions and chat with you. They're all very welcoming and like getting into conversation with you. Some of them might even invite you to be their guest.

* '''Hafez Tomb''' - Mausoleum of Hafez- Hafez (1324-1391), the greatest master of Persian lyric poetry and the literary giant of the 14th century in the west and central Asia, was born in Shiraz, lived all his life here, sang its praises in unsurpassed verse and was buried in a garden known after him as the Hafezieh, in the northeast part of the city. The extraordinary popularity and the wide appeal of this great poet among all Persian-speaking people make his tomb a cherished placed, visited by all. This mausoleum too was rebuilt in the early 50’s. A flight of stone steps reaches to the tomb under a tiled cupola resembling a dervish’s hat. The tombstone is beautifully inscribed with two of Hafez’s poems or Ghazals. Visitors to the tomb can still, as they have done for centuries, take the omens, or faals, by picking a page at random from a volume of Hafez, kept for this purpose. Entry 200,000 rials for foreigners. Overpriced.

* '''Takht-e-Jamshid (Persepolis)''' - The centre of the great Persian Empire, ceremonial capital of the Achaemenians and the showpiece of Achaemenian art, Persepolis (Capital of Persia in Greek) is a historic site in Fars Province, 60 km to the northeast of Shiraz. Iranians call it Takht-e Jamshid (The throne of Jamshid), Jamshid being the first, probably mythical, ruler of Iran. This magnificent court was the summer residence of the Achaemenian emperors and their official reception quarters. It must be by some strange accident of history that Persepolis was never mentioned in foreign records, for it was here that representatives of all the varied peoples of the empire gathered to pay homage, and bring tribute, to the King of Kings, probably each spring, at the time of the ancient Now Ruz festival. Although set on fire and destroyed by Alexander in a gesture symbolizing the destruction of Persian imperial power, its still impressive ruins permit a fairly complete reconstruction of its original appearance. Entrance fee 200,000 rial (not including optional guide or museum entrance)

* '''Naqsh-e Rustam''' - an ancient necropolis 12 km northwest of Persepolis, with a group of ancient Iranian rock reliefs cut into the cliff, from both the Achaemenid and Sassanid periods. Entrance fee 200,000 rial.

* '''Palace of Apadana'''
* [[Varzaneh]] desert is the closest desert town to Shiraz. It is easily reachable from Shiraz-Abadeh-Ramsheh Road. 

* [[Firouzabad]]
* '''Palace of Ardashir''' &ndash; The Palace ruins of Sassanid king Ardashir I. As of September 2014, entrance is 150000 Rial per person for foreign tourists. To get there, there are several options. You can either hire a taxi from anywhere in Shiraz, take a shared taxi from the front of the Kar Andish Bus Terminal in the east of the city or go by bus. Local minibuses leave from the so called Ali Ibn Hamze Terminal, which is a smaller terminal south of the bigger Kar Andish domestic bus terminal, right next to the river. Ask for minibuses to Mavdasht or Persepolis. One ride is 22000 Rial per person [May 2016]. From Mavdasht, taxis take you to Persepolis in 10 minutes. Don't pay more than a maximum of 60000 Rials. To get back to Shiraz, take a taxi from Persepolis to Mavdasht Terminal, which is a hardly visible spot next to the street near the southern exit of Mavdasht. If you ask locals for 'bus Shiraz', they'll point you. From there, minibuses leave again when they are full for 15000 Rial per person. On the way to Persepolis, you pass the Qur'an gate(city gate). You can ask the driver to drop you off at 'Darvazeh ye Qur'an' to visit that after coming back from Persepolis. 

* '''Ghalat village''' &ndash; Located 30 km northwest of Shiraz, Ghalat village is an ancient village popular with locals escaping the city. It has restaurants, stylish coffee houses, ruin mosque and church, river and picnic area, waterfalls and mountain hike. It's particularly beautiful in autumn when all the maples turn red. To reach Ghalat, take the metro to Ghasr-e Dasht station, walk 5 minutes to the Qasr Dasht bus station and take bus number 50 (one hour ride, bus every 30 minutes, 8000 rials). Otherwise hire a taxi from Shiraz for 600,000 rials return which usually allows 1 hour stay.
