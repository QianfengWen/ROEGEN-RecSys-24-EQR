'''Wenzhou''' (温州; ''Wēnzhōu'') is a city in [[Zhejiang]] Province.

==Understand==
[[Image:Wenzhou1.jpg|thumb|350px|Downtown Wenzhou seen from one of the surrounding hills.]]

Wenzhou is the third city of Zhejiang Province and one of the economic power houses of the region. Famed for its businessmen and women (and the ''Wenzhou model'' of business), Wenzhou is frequently used by Western media as a barometer of the Chinese export economy; among other things, Wenzhou manufactures around 90% of the world's spectacles and massive quantities of shoes. Wenzhou is not on many China tour itineraries and despite being a Chinese cultural hotpot, it is not the most foreigner friendly of cities (compared with [[Hangzhou]] and [[Ningbo]], for example). However, there are plenty of things to do and see should you find yourself with time on your hands in Wenzhou. The city has a resident foreigner community that is below average for the city's size (100-200) although foreign businessmen often pass through.

Although Mandarin is widely spoken, the local dialect is Wenzhounese (温州话; Wēnzhōuhuà) and is regarded by Chinese nationals as one of the most difficult dialects in the country, so much so that Wenzhounese speakers were used by the Chinese resistance in World War II to communicate under the nose of the Japanese. Wenzhounese people populate many of the China towns around the globe (where their language is still spoken) and own the leases to many properties in Beijing and even San Francisco.

===Higher Education===

Most universities and colleges are located in Chashan Higher Education Zone. Wenzhou Medical College and Wenzhou University has more than 1000 International students making Wenzhou a place for Higher learning for students worldwide. Currently there are students from more than 70 countries living on campus in both institutes. [http://www.wku.edu.cn Wenzhou-Kean University], an American university in China, has been created out of a collaboration of Kean University in the U.S. and the Wenzhou city government to offer English-language higher education.  The new campus is in the Ouhai District, not far from Chashan.

==Get in==

===By plane===
Wenzhou Airport is east of the city, receiving flights from around China, and because it also supports flights to and from Hong Kong, it is considered international. Wenzhou Airport recently built a new terminal which is much more user friendly and less oppressive for foreigners. You can fly directly from [[Madrid]] with China Eastern Airlines.

You can get from the airport to the city center by taxi or bus. Taxis are the most expensive and you should bargain hard; if they do not like the price you are offering they laugh at you and start shouting ''Bus!''. If a taxi driver offers you a ride under ¥100 it can be regarded as a good deal. Taking the bus is now much easier due to a ticket desk in the new terminal opposite the exit gate. The bus costs ¥12 and drives through New City (新城; Xīnchéng), Xialüpu (下吕浦; Xiàlǚpǔ) and finally stops at a depot on Nanpu Road (南浦路; Nánpǔlù).

===By train===
Wenzhou Central Train Station serves most cities throughout China, although because of Wenzhou's mountains, train journeys are sometimes much longer than their bus counterparts. The train station is at the major junction of Wenzhou Avenue (温州大道; Wēnzhōudàdào) where it meets Chezhan Avenue (车站大道; Chēzhàndàdào).

Wenzhou South Train Station (温州南站; Wēn​zhōu​nán​zhàn​) has been opened in 2009 and now serves the high-speed trains that comes from Shanghai and bounded for Fuzhou and Xiamen. Some of the stations along the way are Hangzhou, Ningbo and Taizhou.

===By bus===
Wenzhou has a number of bus stations that serve a variety of locations around the country. Arrivals from Shanghai and Fuzhou will find themselves at New South Station (新南站; Xīnnánzhàn) which is near the train station on Wenzhou Avenue (温州大道; Wēnzhōudàdào), arrivals from Hangzhou and Ningbo will find themselves at New City Station (新城站; Xīnchéngzhàn) which is in New City, and arrivals from places as varied as Yiwu and Qingdao will find themselves at Shuangyu Bus Station (双屿汽车站; Shuāngyǔqìchēzhàn) which is on the west side of the city near the suburb of Huanglong.

==Get around==

===By bus===
Buses cost ¥1.5-2.5 within the city and can be very useful once you figure what number goes where. Useful buses include the 78 that goes between the old train station and the new south train station (¥2). The price is listed on the outside of the bus and on the bus stop sign. The bus stop sign also lists the stops on one side and shows a map on the other. Strangely, you will not find this in Beijing or Shanghai.

===By taxi===
Taxis are ¥10+2(gas charge) for the first 4km and ¥1 for each .5km thereafter (after 11:30PM prices rise to ¥12+2(gas charge) for the first 4km and ¥1 for each .5km thereafter). If you are outside the centre of the city, or in the centre trying to get elsewhere, you will not be able to catch a taxi between 4:30PM and 6PM. This is because of the driver shift change.

Many taxis drivers like to haggle for prices and not use the meter especially for relatively far places. So be cautious when you board one.

===By ferry===
Although one ferry serves the tourist island of Jiangxin, there are other ferries that serve destinations up and down the Ouhai River (  瓯海; ōuhǎi) such as the suburb of Oubei (瓯北; ōuběi)

High prices and a bad menu contribute to an uncomfortable experience.

On the upside, there are two rolls. Menu is in Italian and Chinese.</eat>

Some are busier and more likely to stare at foreigners. Nanpu is the quietest and will give the least hassle, while Renmin is the biggest and busiest(as it is near the Movie theatre) with large numbers of staring eyes watching any foreigners present. 

Expect differences in the menu - chicken leg or wings but not chicken breast is typical for Chinese chicken places :)</eat>

Pizza Hut recently withdrew it's Pepperoni Pizza from it's Chinese restaurants and increased the price of it's stuffed crust pizza, which is a shame. 

Pizza hut has stopped giving discounts to foreign students studying in Wenzhou. Discounts are only for Chinese Students nowadays!  This is really a waste of time because not many Chinese Students go to Pizza Hut! Generally will see families with children. </eat>

==Get out==
*'''Linhai''' &mdash; in the Taizhou prefecture, north of Wenzhou, Linhai has the Southern Great Wall of China. There is also an East Lake (东湖), and long old streets. Really nice place. Buses leave the City Bus Station (新城长途车站) every 30 minutes or so, take 1:45 hours and cost ¥66.

*'''Hangzhou''' &mdash; buses take about 4-4.5 hours, leave from New City Bus Station, and cost ¥150. They leave really frequently first thing in the morning, and then every 30 minutes or so afterward.    

*'''Shanghai''' &mdash; can get there by train, bus or plane. Train costs ¥90 for a seat, &yen;175 for a hard-sleeper and takes about 10 hours.  In 2009, the CRH Train service has officially entered Wenzhou at their newly opened South Railway Station (温州南站). The tickets are ¥180-220 and it takes slightly over 4 hours.  The bus costs ¥200 and takes about 6 hours. It is notable that the bus route between Wenzhou and Shanghai will take you across the longest sea bridge in the world. The plane takes no time and can be as little as ¥200 if you leave very early.

==Stay Safe==
Wenzhou is not a dangerous city for foreigners, especially foreigners that are careful.

* '''Clubs''' &mdash; Be warned, at clubs, notably Muse Club, the nouveau riche Wenzhounese men who go there seem to believe they're allowed to grope, touch and otherwise help themselves to foreign females without permission or repercussion. Drunk Wenzhounese men can also be quick to anger if you reject their advances. The club owners either don't know or don't care. Be vigilant especially going in and out of bathrooms and on the dance floor.  

* '''Taxis''' &mdash; it is not unknown for women to be harassed while in a taxi on their own. If you are catching a taxi on your own at night it may be best to sit in the back of the taxi, out of reach of grabby hands. Do not flash too much cash around late at night, as robbery has been known by taxi drivers who pick up accomplices. However, this is rare, and many taxi drivers are well intentioned and friendly.

* '''Fights''' &mdash; if a fight breaks out between Chinese people, do not get involved. If a Chinese person gets aggressive with you or a friend, leave discreetly as soon as you can.

* '''The streets at night''' &mdash; the streets of Wenzhou are normally safe, and because there are always eyes on foreigners, someone will always see anything that happens. This said, there are certain no-go areas of the city where poverty and demographic abnormality (excess men) can lead to high aggression levels.

* '''Beggars''' &mdash; here are a number of beggars throughout the city especially around Wuma Street and Renmin Road. The beggars are run by gangs that maintain the beggars (with food and shelter) while taking the money that is collected by the often disabled/disfigured panhandlers. Don't stand and watch a begging 'performer' because you WILL be harassed for money; being foreign is reason enough to harass you.  If they bother you, give them 1 yuan and they will go away.

* '''Prostitution''' &mdash; prostitution is illegal in China but is widely tolerated. Brothels or 'Pink Houses' (because of the pink lights) riddle the city and many foreigners are known to use them. Brothels are far from safe, not just because of STIs, but also because of under-age prostitutes, robbery and police raids. Police in Wenzhou have been known to raid brothels while a foreigner is inside, the consequences of which can be far reaching; your visa could be revoked resulting in deportation.
