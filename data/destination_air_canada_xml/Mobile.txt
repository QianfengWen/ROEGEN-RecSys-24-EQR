==Stay safe==
Although the city isn't as big as with other major cities such as New York City, Los Angeles and Miami, and that its at least safe overall, it's still best to take necessary precautions such as locking your car doors and never leave belongings inside your vehicle. Avoid traversing through poorer neighborhoods in the Mobile area, and be mindful that traffic can get erratic at times so be vigilant when driving.
