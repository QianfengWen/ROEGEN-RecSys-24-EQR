'''Jodhpur''' is the second largest city in the state of [[Rajasthan]], [[India]]. It is called the ''Gateway to Thar'', as it is literally on the edge of the Thar desert. It is also called the ''Sun City'' as the sun shines (very bright and hot!) almost every day of the year.

Jodhpur is an historic city whose origin dates to the year 1459 AD when it was founded by Rao Jodha, the Rajput chieftan of the Rathores. The Rathore kingdom was also known as the [[Marwar]] and was the largest in Rajputana. 

The city was built as the new capital of the state of '''Marwar'''  to replace the ancient capital [[Mandore]], the ruins of which can be seen near what is now the Mandore Gardens.  The people of Jodhpur and surrounding areas are hence also commonly called as Marwaris. 

Jodhpur is also known as the '''Blue City''', an apt name as most houses in the old city are shades of blue.  This is particularly noticeable on the north side of the town, known as '''Brahmpuri''' for the many Brahmins that live there.

The forts and palaces, temples and havelis, culture and tradition, spices and fabrics, colour and texture, a booming handicrafts industry, all add up to make this historic city worth a visit.

===By bus===

Jodhpur can be reached by RSRTC [http://www.rsrtc.gov.in] (Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation) buses and private luxury buses which operate from all major towns and cities in Rajasthan as well as the cities of Ahmedabad and Delhi.

==Get around==

Means of transport include:

*'''Cabs''' (Taxis) - You can book Ola/Uber after reaching Jodhpur very conveniently. However, local apps like "Meri Cab" or "Meri auto" are very popular along with '''Suncity Cabs''' [http://www.suncitycabs.in/] provide cab service in city. They charge as per distance traveled. 

*'''Mini buses''' - Public transport is available but chaotic and not advisable except when on a shoestring budget.

*'''Car Rental''' - There are many car rental companies available. The narrow lanes of the inner walled city of Jodhpur can not reasonably be  traversed by cars without creating major havoc and posing a severe risk of damage to the rental car for the unpracticed driver, but should best be explored on foot, by bicycle, Auto Rickshaw or motorcycle/scooter. Talk to any local travel agency and book your cab in advance. Usually, hotel reception maintains a list of available cab operators with contact details.

* '''Auto Rickshaws''' (unmetered) - They do not operate on meter and you have to negotiate and fix fare before you get on board. They are the most common mode of public transport in Jodhpur and are readily available.

* '''Tongas''' horse driven carriages. They operate in very limited region near the Clock Tower.

===Mehrangarh Fort===
[[Image:Mehrangarh Fort.jpg|thumb|240px|Mehrangarh Fort]]
[[Image:Fort_MotiMahal.JPG|thumb|240px|Moti Mahal]]
[[Image:Fort ZenanaDeodi.JPG|thumb|240px|Zenana Deodi]]

'''Mehrangarh Fort''' [http://www.khojbin.com/Mehrangarh-Fort_Jodhpur_Rajasthan_things-to-do-overview/28/2910001] dominates the city and is the largest fort in all Rajasthan.  Founded in 1458 as the site of Rao Jodha's new capital &mdash; hence the name, Jodhpur &mdash; the city has grown around it, and in the 500 years that have passed the fort has never been taken by force.  It's easy to see why: it occupies the entire top of a 150 m hill with commanding views all around, with some three kilometers of massive ramparts built around the edges. An English owned company 'Flying Fox' operates a zip tour out of the beautiful Chokelao Gardens within the fort. As for July 2015: it is possible to go up to the fort and see the views of the city for free, but to enter the palaces and museum you do need the tickets that are sold at the entrance, Rs 600 for foreigners (see below all price details).

The name "Fort" belies the size of the complex, which houses the Maharaja's palace, several temples and, tucked away in the back, an extensive garden still farmed to this day.  Highlights within the palace include:

* '''Moti Mahal''' (Pearl Hall).  Pearl-colored inside and decorated with colored glass windows, this is where the Maharaja held his audiences, with the five alcoves on the far wall allowing his queens to listen in.

* '''Sheesh Mahal''' (Mirror Hall).  Just what the name says.

* '''Phool Mahal''' (Flower Hall).  The most extravagant of them all, this was the Maharaja's pleasure chamber, for dancing girls and revelry.

* '''Zenana Deodi'''.  The inner sanctum of the palace once guarded by eunuchs, this is where the Maharaja's wives whiled away their days.  The delicate sandstone screens and carvings are exquisite.

* '''Chamunda Mataji Temple'''.  Tucked away at the far end of the battlements, this temple is devoted to Rao Jodha's favorite goddess and remains a local favorite to this day.

A number of people are employed here and there to add flavor by dressing in period costume and doing photogenic things like playing traditional instruments and smoke opium (yes, the real thing).  Snap away, but they'll appreciate a tip if you do.  The museum also includes galleries devoted to ''howdahs'' (elephant-mounted seats), palanquins, fine arts, weaponry, and the inevitable '''Turban Gallery'''.

An audio tour is included in the entry fee of Rs600 (for foreign tourists, Rs400 for foreign students, a deposit of Rs2000, passport, credit card or drivers license is required). Usage of video is Rs200, still camera is Rs100. (July 2015). The audio guide is actually quite good, and gives you information you otherwise wouldn't get from signs within the fort. Some audio guide devices have poor batteries, which may run out within minutes. Just take it back to the ticket office and they'll give you another one.

Entry to the fort is free each year on it's birthday (about the 12th of May), and is not as crowded as you would think.

The fort is open daily from 09:00 to 17:00.

There is a set of stairs leading down to the city below, tucked away between the entrance gate and and the car park. Easily walked and shorter then the winding road. 

'''Tips:''' 
* '''Explore the fort:''' If you have the time, also venture deeper into the fort (outside the palace) which will give you a more complete idea of it's size. You will also see the Chokelao Gardens, which are located outside the inner wall and accessed through a gate to your right (follow the signs for the FlyingFox). Cool and relaxant.

* '''Black kite spectacle:''' Daily from around 15:30 to 16:00, there is a person (young boy, sometimes a man) feeding the black kites leisurely cruising around the tower opposite the Chokelao Garden entrance by throwing pieces of meat from its top. Quite a spectacle, if you have never seen 200 plus kites in one place.
  
* '''Outside walk:''' You can also walk outside the eastern side of the walls (to your left as you face the entrance gate) on a sometimes overgrown path. It will eventually bring you to a small temple on the southern end of the rock and will give you great views of the walls towering above and the city below. Especially nice for early morning photography. Police, though, warn of 'naughty boys' there and the area shows evidence of evening/night activity. Also, dogs roam the area. At the temple are two sets of stairs leading down to the old market area.

===Historical sites===
[[Image:JaswantThada Lake.JPG|thumb|240px|Jaswant Thada]]

* '''Jaswant Thada''', 1 km downhill from Mehrangarh (''easily walked - ignore the tuk tuk drivers who try to convince you otherwise, or lie about walking not being allowed'').  Royal cenotaphs built in marble, with a picturesque location next to a little lake.  Entry Rs 30, plus Rs 25 for a camera. It is also free on the birthday of the Fort (about the 12th of May). The place is actually kept free of waste accumulating in corners and the lake.

* '''Mandore''', 7 km outside the city.  The ancient capital of Marwar, before Jodhpur was built. It is open to the public free of charge. The lower part consists of small temples and garden areas including a river. Would be nice except for the usual waste. The upper part holds the ruins of the old fort. No charge, but closed from 7pm to 7am. Good views. Entrance to the museum (Indians 20 INR, Foreigners 100) allows you to see the buildings of the old capital, beautiful architecture, a small steps-well, and is very clean and well maintained. The exhibition rooms inside do not hold much of interest. Getting to Mandore Gardens is very easy: from the clock tower, go about 1 KM down the main street until you reach the main junction (with traffic-light). From this point, bus #1 till take you directly to the gardens entrance (10 INR, 20 minutes), other busses (ask the drivers) will drop you on the main road, which is only 200 meters away from the gardens. A relaxed visit to the gardens, museum and fort would take you about 2.5 hours.

* '''Umaid Bhawan Palace'''.  Clearly visible to the south of the city and completed only in 1944, this is the last great palace built in India.  The Maharaja of Jodhpur lives here to this day, but half the building has been converted to a 5-star hotel (see Sleep). Only paying guests are allowed inside the hotel. There is also a small museum on the grounds (Rs.100 for foreign tourists, Rs. 30 for Indians, Rs 10 for kids 5 to 11 years, open 9 AM to 5 PM).  There is not much of interest on display:  some old photographs and china place settings. Few vintage cars are also on display in glass enclosures.You'll have to take a rickshaw to get here, and it's best to ask them to wait: figure on Rs. 100 for a round-trip with an hour's waiting time.

* '''Khejarla Fort''' [http://www.jodhpurfortkhejarla.com], located 85 km. from the main city. Situated in a rural setting, the 400 year old, Fort Khejarla is now a hotel rather than an attraction to visit and offers guests an enlivening experience. The stunning red sandstone monument is an example of the Rajput architecture. The Fort offers picturesque settings, latticework friezes, and intricate Jharoka. To reach Khejarla from Jodhpur, head on Jodhpur Jaipur highway for 73 km. You'll cross Bhavi village and a railway crossing. After railway crossing go 3.5 kms and take a left turn. Then go straight for 12 km and you'll find Khejarla fort.

* '''Ghanta Ghar Clock Tower & Sardar Market''' Ghanta Ghar, also known as the clock tower of Rajasthan. It was built by Maharaja Sardar Singh (1880-1911) from whom the market takes it name. In fact, the tower dominates the entire scenario. The clock tower is a popular landmark in the old city. The vibrant Sardar Market is close to the tower, and narrow alleys lead from here to a bazaar selling vegetables, spices, Indian sweets, textiles, silver and handicrafts. It is a great place to ramble around at leisure. Entry Fee (10AM to 5PM) is 30 INR (Foreigners/Indians). The view is only from the balcony (you cannot see it from the top of the tower). Inside the tower you can have a look at the mechanism of the clock. Try to time your visit at a round hour, and hear the bell.

===Natural sites===

* '''Balsamand Lake''' - now converted to a resort

* '''Kailana Lake''' - a picnic spot and a main drinking water source for the city

* '''Ranisar Padamsar''' - Ranisar was made by Queen Jasmade Hadi, Rao Jodha's wife in 1459. Ranisar is situated near Fateh Pole in Mehrangarh.

* '''Gulab Sagar Lake''' - Gulab Sagar water storage was constructed by Gulab Rai in 1788.

==Buy==
[[Image:SardarMarket Fabrics.JPG|thumb|240px|Fabrics for sale, Sardar Market]]

The city's main shopping area is '''Nai Sadak''', lined mostly with sari and shoe shops and leading straight into '''Sardar Market''', a full-on bustling Indian market with a barely contained riot of sights, sounds and stinks.  The clocktower in the center is a useful orientation point.  Best to head into the different shops by yourself, as rickshaw drivers and other locals will do their best to direct you into certain shops where they can  earn a commission for sales; you can expect to get better prices if the shopkeepers do not have to pay a percentage to these other guys.  And be prepared to spend a good hour or more in a shop chatting with the very friendly owners over a cup of masala chai.  This is the true highlight of Rajasthani hospitality. You will find Rajasthan (and especially Jodhpur) to be full of amiable and kind people who will be quick to offer you chai as a symbol of genuine hospitality first and foremost (not at all significant of an attempt to coerce you to buy). It is not uncommon for them to turn their shop upside down to show you all of their goods, as many are quite proud of their business.  Popular souvenirs include:

* '''Bandhej''' sarees and dress material

* '''Mojris''' or Jootis. Shoes with a pointed front, a must-have accessory if you plan on dressing like a Rajput Maharaja.

* '''Handicrafts''' these are handmade wooden showpieces(made to look like old antiques). The handicraft industry is a booming industry in this city.

* '''Spices and Tea'''  Expect to pay 100-150rps for each 200g packet of spices or 150g packet of tea.  Among the highlights are the various masala mixes: different one for vegetables, rice, meat, fish, etc.; individual spices: especially cardamom, vanilla, and saffron - very high quality for a fraction of what you pay back home; tea: including the cinnamon-infused Kashmiri Khawa, masala mix to add to assam/darjeeling, and ginger tea.  Be sure to stop in various different shops as each store has their own recipe for mixing their own blend.

* '''Textiles''' Far better prices here for rugs, scarves, duvet covers, etc. than buying in Delhi.  Scarves are the top sales item with prices varying from 50rps to 3000rps depending on the material (pashmina, silk, kashmir, blends,e tc.)
There are numerous shops around town:

* '''National Handloom''', Nai Sadak (''and ten other outlets around the city''):  A four-story air-conditioned shop easily identified by their logo of a gloriously mustachioed and turbaned man, the jumble of items inside is authentically Indian. Prices are cheap, clearly marked, and hassle-free.  The fourth story houses handicrafts and art, with most of the rest devoted to clothes and groceries.

* '''Thar Handloom''', Gol Building Road: is a common place for purchase of traditional cloths and sarees. Its a kind of store with premium quality with premium pricing. Contrary to their naming, they do not sell anything apart from cloths.

*<buy name="Ganesh Handicrafts" alt="" address="84-85 Nai Sarak" directions="near Clock Tower" phone="0291-2624165" url="http://www.ganeshhandicrafts.com" hours="" price="" lat="" long="" email="maheshabani@hotmail.com">The owner (Mahesh) typically invites customers for a cup of masala tea and engages in friendly chats. The shop sells jewelry, textile, clothes (can be tailored-made), and furniture. Prices are fixed so you don't need to bargain. Some scarves are as cheap as 200rps. They offer international shipping for bulky items. The owner dose not allow the guides or comission people as they hate paying commission.</buy> 

* '''Nitisha''',Located at Raikabad, Near Rajmata School. The store does readymade garments for both men and women, silver and semi precious stones jewellery, cushions, bedsheets and bedcovers, fragrances, gift items, souvenirs, candles, gift packing material, show pieces and handicrafts, gift packaging accessories at great rates. All prices are clearly marked on the items and thus there is no chance of quoting high prices.

==Eat==

'Restaurants' as you find them elsewhere are somewhat hard to find in Jodhpur, except for around the tourist areas such as in front of the Fort. Otherwise, especially for lunch it's stand-up street food such as Samosas.

Don't forget to try the Rajasthani delicacies 

* Makhaniya Lassi &mdash; ''lassi'' (yoghurt drink) spiced up with cardamom and butter. '''Mishrilal''' at the Clock Tower possibly serves the best lassi in town.

==Stay safe==

This is a comparatively safe city, however it is advisable not to venture out late in the night alone.

While travelling in trains or buses, avoid any snacks offered by seemingly well meaning strangers. There have been some incidents where tourists or even locals have been drugged and looted after consuming narcotic-laced biscuits or tea. Though the incidents of rape or sexual assualt are far and few in between, women may feel more comfortable dressing a bit conservatively; avoid very short skirts or micro shorts if possible.

Please have the following numbers with you all the time. They can be dialed from any mobile or fixed line phone.
* Police - 100
* Fire - 101
* Ambulance - 102, (+91-240)-2473301, (+91-240)-2473302

Beware of touts selling rail tickets or promising reservations on trains. It is a criminal offence to buy and sell tickets except from recognized agents or the reservation offices.

*[[Ranakpur]] - Ranakpur is widely known for its magnificent marble Jain temple devoted to Lord Adinath and is a must see. Ranakpur is between Jodhpur and Udaipur, in a valley on the western side of the Aravalli Range. Easily accessed by road, Ranakpur is around 90km north of Udaipur. White marble has been used for the construction of this grand temple. The temple, with its distinctive domes, rises majestically from the slope of a hill. Over 1444 marble pillars, carved in exquisite detail, support the temple, and no two columns are the same. There is one beautiful carving made out of a single marble rock where there are 1008 heads of snakes and numerous tails over the head of  Lord ParsvaNatha. One cannot find the end of the tails. The image faces all four cardinal directions. The temple is designed as chaumukha with four faces. The construction of the temple and quadrupled image symbolize the Jain Tirthankara's conquest of the four cardinal directions and hence the cosmos.
