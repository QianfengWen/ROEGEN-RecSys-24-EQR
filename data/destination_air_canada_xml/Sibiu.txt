'''Sibiu''' [http://www.sibiu.ro/index-en.htm] is a town in southern [[Transylvania]], [[Romania]] 282 km from [[Bucharest]].
The city's historical centre has been recently renovated in 2006 and looks spectacular.

==Understand==
[[Image:Sibiu.JPG|thumb|Sibiu centre]]
Known in [[German]] as ''Hermannstadt'' and in [[Hungarian]] as ''Nagyszeben'', Sibiu has always been the centre of Romania's German minority since medieval times. Even today, it contains Romania's largest German community, and due to initiatives by the local government, the Germanic feel of the area has been maintained. Sibiu also has a significant Hungarian minority, remnants of Transylvania's past as part of the Hungarian Empire and, later, Austria-Hungary. Despite this, Sibiu is also distinctly Romanian (95% of the population are ethnic Romanians) and manages to fuse these three cultures, as well as smaller minorities of Roma, Slovaks and Ukrainians into a city that is as wonderful as it is vibrant.

Today, Sibiu is one of Romania's cultural and tourism capitals, attracting tourists due to its wonderful medieval charm, excellent views of the surrounding landscapes, great food, and stunning parkland. Sibiu today is also doing excellently economically, having an income per capita higher than the Romanian average.

Much of the city has been reconstructed due to it being the European Capital of Culture in 2007 and has benefited greatly from the funds made available. The people in Sibiu are friendly and much of the city centre is pedestrian area. Many locals use their bikes in and outside the city.

==Get in==

===By bus===
Sibiu is well connected to [[Bucharest]] and [[Cluj Napoca]]. From Cluj Napoca there are buses almost every hour, provided by Dacos, Fany and Transmixt, taking around 3.5 h. The buses are smooth-running, very comfortable and cheap.

===By train===

There are 3 direct IRs from Bucharest (5h 40mins) and one Re that takes 8h. From [[Brasov]] there are 7 trains daily (2.5 to 4h) and from [[Cluj-Napoca]] there are no direct trains but connections through Copsa Mica , Medias or Vintu de Jos 

The train schedule changes every summer and winter so it is better to check it online.  [http://www.infofer.ro]

===By plane===

If you're not coming to Sibiu from another Romanian town, plane is an excellent option, as there are direct connections to  '''Sibiu International Airport [http://www.sibiuairport.ro]''' from many European cities, especially those in [[Germany]] and [[Italy]]. 

City bus 11, 112, 118 all go into town the cost is 3 lei per hour (2022).  To find the bus stop exit the airport walk to the main street and it is on the left.  There is machine at the stop to purchase a ticket with coins or 1 or 5 lei notes. 

There is also Uber and Bolt in Sibiu, so there are many ways to get to Sibiu. You can book your airport transfer to the hotel at a fixed price or you can use a regular taxi, uber or bolt. But considering the traffic the buses would be a better choice. The only way to get a taxi is to get lucky that you have one at the airport or you need to call one to come pick you up. It is recommended to call for one instead of taking one from the airport because they will try to scam you.


'''Tarom [http://www.tarom.ro]''', Romania's national carrier, as well as '''Lufthansa [http://www.lufthansa.com]'''  flies five times a week from Sibiu to [[Munich]] and also five times a week to [[Vienna]]. For those with money to splurge, there are also flights three times a week to Bucharest, even though you're better off taking the train if you're coming from inside Romania.  There are frequent specials, though, so look at the TAROM website before deciding one way or the other.

'''There are also Ryanair, Austrian, WizzAir operating a significant number of flights to different destinations just check [https://www.sibiuairport.ro]'''

==Get around==

Sibiu, a city of 170,000 people, seems quite large for its population, even though most tourists won't have to venture outside the conveniently-walkable city central area. In fact, try to walk as much as you can, as only in this way can you sample Sibiu's more remote gems, hidden behind lanes in the middle of the city and crooked, cobbled alleys taking you a step back in history.

===Bicycle===

Bike rentals are available also from the info centre at Casa Luxembourg on [https://transfagarasan.travel/ghid/locatie/piata-mica/ Piața Mică]. Guides bike tours are offered to explore the surrounding area by mountain bike, but the prices are too high compared to other places. You can also rent [http://www.ivelo.ro/ yellow city bikes] for 15 LEI at the '''ivelo''' office, tucked away behind a parking lot on [https://transfagarasan.travel/ghid/locatie/piata-unirii-din-sibiu/ Piața Unirii]. Ideal to venture outside the city centre to visit Cisnădie or enjoy the Natural park [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumbrava_Sibiului_Natural_Park Dumbrava Sibiului].

===Public transport===
If you do need to venture outside the medieval city limits, the local public transport operator '''TurSib [http://www.tursib.ro]''' offers reliable services. These services may be useful if you're staying in hotels, pensions or homestays outside the city centre or would like to visit some of the wonderful villages surrounding Sibiu, for a taste of Romanian country life and stunning Transylvanian scenery.

===Rent-A-Car===

Cars can be rented from various operators:

==See==

*'''The old town''' The old medieval town is perhaps Sibiu's main attraction, and it is indeed very beautiful. Most of the buildings in the old town were built by German settlers and merchants who came to Sibiu in the late Middle Ages. Today, the buildings remain in very good conditions, and the streets are peppered with small, secluded lanes, corner cafes and wonderful churches. The old town is divided into two parts: the '''Upper Town''', which contains most of the city's historic sights, and the '''Lower Town''', which is home to many charming buildings and cobbled squares.

*'''The Citadel of Sibiu''' [https://transfagarasan.travel/ghid/locatie/cetatea-medievala-sibiu/ The Citadel of Sibiu] was, in the Middle Ages, one of the best fortified in [[Europe]] and today remains very well preserved. The towers and bastions of the area are well worth a visit, but most of all, make sure you visit the wonderfully charming '''Stairs Passage''', which connects the lower part of the citadel with the upper part. If you want to splurge, dine at the '''Golden Barrel''' (''Butoiul de Aur''), the oldest restaurant in [[Romania]], which sits at the end of the [https://transfagarasan.travel/ghid/locatie/pasajul-scarilor/ Stairs Passage].

*'''Huet Square''' The Huet Square ('' Piaţa Huet'') is home to a jumble of Gothic buildings and is dominated by the [https://transfagarasan.travel/ghid/locatie/catedrala-evanghelica/ Evangelical Cathedral], one of the most beautiful in Sibiu. Ascending the cathedral's tower offers views of the inner-working of the bell, but also offers stunning views of the city and surrounding mountains and countryside. Here, you can also find the city's only fully-German school, the '''Samuel von Brukenthal Gymnasium''', which shows the city's proud German heritage. In fact, Huet Square stands to be the most German of all places in this city which is as much German as Romanian, and, all the same, 100% Transylvanian.

*'''The Brukenthal Museum''' [http://www.brukenthalmuseum.ro/] Said by many to be the second best museum in Romania (after the National Art Museum in the capital Bucharest), the Brukenthal is '''[https://transfagarasan.travel/ghid/locatie/muzeul-brukenthal/ a must see]''' in Sibiu, containing 1090 paintings. The museum is named after Samuel Brukenthal, the governor of [[Transylvania]]. There are paintings from Dutch and Flemish schools, Italian schools and, of course, German, Austrian and Romanian collections. The museum also displays Governor Brukenthal's own collection dating from the 15th-18th centuries.

*'''"ASTRA" Museum of Traditional Folk Civilization''' is part of ASTRA National Museum Complex [http://www.muzeulastra.ro/] and with over 300 buildings in an area of about one square kilometer the biggest open air museum in Europe. Not only does it have interesting and very picturesque exhibits but it also lies in a very beautiful area with a nice view of the mountains. The museum is located about 3 kilometers south of Sibiu with a good bike path connecting it all the way from the city centre through [https://transfagarasan.travel/ghid/locatie/parcul-de-sub-arini/ Parcul Sub Arini]. It's also reachable by bus, the tram is not running anymore. The museum and the surrounding park is  fine and there's a collection of about 20 different watermills or more, one more creative than the next in taking advantage of water power.

*'''Outlying attractions''' In addition to Sibiu's wonderful historical and cultural attractions, the city has a nice green area within walking/cycling distance from the city centre. '''Cisnădie''' can easily be reached through Natural park Dumbrava Sibiului on quiet roads. Paying a visit to some more outlying attractions enables you to sample the amazing Transylvanian environment. Sibiu is a good base to explore the '''medieval fortified churches''' of Transylvania. [[Medias]] is accessible by train from Sibiu, but to see many in one day you will need your own transport or try and seek out a guide from the local travel agencies. '''UNESCO World Heritage''' sites are the villages '''[[Biertan]]''' and '''[[Valea Viilor]]'''.

*'''[https://transfagarasan.travel/ghid/en/locatie/balea-lake/ Balea lake]''', a wonderfull glacier lake about 50 kilometers south east from Sibiu right off from the road to [[Brasov]], on the spectacular [https://transfagarasan.travel/ Transfăgăraşan].

==Eat==
{{style|[[Listings|listings format and info]]}}
In the old town there are many restaurants, fast foods and cafes where tourists and locals can enjoy not only good food from the local and international cuisine but also good music and cosy atmosphere. 
The Small Square (Piata Mica) became in the last few years the best place to go out in Sibiu because of the big range of restaurants, cafes and pubs which also have terraces during the summer.  The quality of restaurants and the service delivered is also generally higher in the Small Square as it is more for the locals.

When staying in Sibiu you should try the local dish "Ciorbă", a sour soup which has different variants with meatballs and/or vegetables.

The food and drink available in Sibiu is of a higher standard generally than the equivalent restaurant in Bucharest and is cheap by Western European standards, though prices are comparable to Bucharest.  You could expect to have a good meal for two people with drinks and 2 courses for around €25 total.

It's a shame, that potentially great places like Piața Mică are packed with cars combined with expensive, nouveau riche restaurants. There are some more down-to-earth places where you can enjoy Sibiu.
