'''Guatemala City''' is the capital of [[Guatemala]], a country in [[Central America]].

==Understand==

Guatemala City is located in the department (territorial division) of Guatemala, and it's the capital of the country. All the main highways start at Kilómetro 0, located inside Palacio Nacional de la Cultura (National Palace), in Centro Histórico (Historic Center).

Guatemala City became the capital after [[Antigua Guatemala]] had been destroyed by an earthquake in 1773.  With a population of around 3 million people, Guatemala City is the largest and most modern city in Guatemala. It can be interesting to visit "Guate," as it is also called by the locals. Guatemala City has plenty of attractions and pretty good restaurants.  Sunday evenings' gatherings of hundreds of locals at the main plaza is certainly an unforgettable experience. 

===Tourist Information===

* '''INGUAT''', 7 Avenida 1-17, Zona 4. Travellers have mixed reports about the service being unreliable here at the official travel office. There is little written material You can get some nice posters for Q6, and if you bring your own blank CD, they will copy some ''marimba'' music for you. Although it holds a repelling reputation for violent crime, Guatemala is also known for its good-natured, friendly citizens.

==Get in ==

Guatemala City has one big airport called La Aurora in the south part of the city, in Zona 13. There are daily arrivals from the USA, México, El Salvador, Honduras (San Pedro Sula, Tegucigalpa), Costa Rica (San José), Nicaragua (Managua), Panamá.  The only domestic flight route (within the country) available is a flight between Guatemala City and Flores in Peten offered by TAG and Avianca (formerly Taca Regional).

Any transportation option at the airport can be paid with US Dollars, so you don't really need local currency until after you've left the airport. That being said, if you'd like to use the ATM before leaving the airport you will need to exit the departures area, cross the street, take an elevator to the third floor and reenter the airport arrival area. You may need to show your passport with your stamp from that day to enter the arrivals area. The ATM is somewhat hidden behind the stairs that lead up to the food court. The exchange kiosks that pepper the airport have an exchange rate that is worse than most (6.8 Quetzals/USD as of Nov 2014 in comparison to 7.4 elsewhere). Banrural (located next to the ATM) has better rates.  In the city, BAC Credomatic will exchange currency for a reasonable rate plus a fee of Q12.

There are always taxis at the airport. They operate with fixed prices (around $12US from the airport to Zona 10) that are 2-3 times higher than what you would pay for the same distance with an ordinary taxi. The minimum charge for a taxi in any direction is 70 Quetzals. If your hotel is in Zona 10, chances are high that there is a free shuttle service.  Uber from the airport is much cheaper than a taxi, because there is no minimum.  Uber picks up at the front of the arrivals, although the app says "by the coffee shop."

There is also a bus route operating the road that passes the airport that will take you to Zona 10 at around La Reforma and 12 Calle, although riding city buses in Guatemala city is considered by many to be unsafe. If you are going to the old city center (Zona 1), many buses go that way from La Reforma or from 7 Avenida that runs in parallel with La Reforma, including the safer Transmetro bus line. The nearest Transmetro bus station from the airport is a 30-45 minute walk from the departures exit.

Regular shuttles run to Antigua each day, several times a day from 6AM to 8 PM (prices $8-12US per person).

===By car===
Central American highways CA-1 and CA-9 run through Guatemala City.

CA-1 is part of the Pan-American Highway and comes from the border with Mexico near Tapachula through the western highlands. Within the city, CA-1 is first Avenida Roosevelt, then Boulevar Liberacion and then Bulevar Los Proceres. It then becomes Carretera a El Salvador outside of the city and it leads to the Chinamas border with El Salvador.

These main roads are badly marked. Finding, for instance, the airport or a street address is not easy at all. Be aware that the city is divided into 24 "zonas", or districts. An address such as 6 av. 13-43 is useless if you don't know the number of the zona.

If you have a mobile phone with data coverage and Google Maps, you can actually get around. As of 2016, Apple Maps and Garmin are of little use, but Google has a well updated map and the instructions can guide you to your destination.
Getting lost with a car in an unknown part of the town can be dangerous, especially at night.

===By bus===
In almost any town in Guatemala, you will find a bus that eventually will take you to Guatemala City. The second-class ''extra-urbanos'' or ''camionetas'' are often crowded and uncomfortable but cheap.  They are known as '''"Chicken buses"''' as they are used to carry everybody and everything including live chickens going to market and were once American school buses.  Expect to pay around Q10 per hour if you are a foreigner. There are also various first-class buses from some of the larger cities and from neighboring countries (Belize, México, El Salvador and Honduras). Most buses end up in Zona 1 or Zona 4 but they can be located elsewhere in town too.

{{cautionbox|As of January 2007, there has been a transition to a new mass transit system that has more or less removed buses from their normal terminals in Zona 1 and Zona 4. Guatemala City is currently converting to a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system, where intercity buses bringing in riders from other parts of the country drop them off at different stations at the periphery of the city, and the privately-owned municipal bus system brings them to their respective destinations within the city. Currently, intercity buses heading in the direction of Antigua can be found at the Plaza del Mariachi at the periphery of Zona 3. This arrangement is currently in flux, however, with the bus cooperative members fighting for a legal right to use the old terminals in Zona 1 and Zona 4 again.  In 2011 they had opened a new bus station at CENTRA Sur (Central de Transferencias Sur) located 16km south, next to Colonia Villa Lobos II in Zona 12 with buses going south towards the Pacific coast and on shorter routes to/from nearby places of San Miguel Petapa, Amatitlán, Bárcenas, Villa Nueva and Cd Peronia south of Guatemala City.  CENTRA SUR is also the southern terminus of the 'orange' line (T70,D70,D71) of the BRT Metro system.  They also added  another bus station at 'CENTRA Norte' (combined w/ a mall) at Km 8.5 de de la Carretera al Atlántico (CA-9) en Zona 17  for buses going north, such as to Peten, and northeast of the country.  Chicken buses going to the western highlands leave from a series of stops (paradas) along Calle 41 between 6a & 7a Ave. It would be best for travelers to consult locals or the bus companies below to find out what the situation is instead of going anywhere for the buses.}}

Most of the first class pullman bus companies have their own terminals located in Zona 1.  The terminals are generally clustered in an area south of the Plaza Barrios (by National Palace) bounded north by 15 Calle, south by 20 Calle, west by 2a Avenida and east by 12a Avenida. They can also be located in other parts of the city or inside hotel lobbies instead.  Some of the first class companies also operate second class chicken buses while others only operate chicken buses that have their own stations or lots.   The area around the bus stations in Zona 1 is sketchy especially at night and it is advisable to get a taxi to get from one station to another or to wherever you need to go. With everything in a state of flux regarding their location it is BEST to verify locally before going to the stations as their locations may of changed and they may or may not update their websites to reflect these changes.

==Get around==

[[Image:Guatemala_City_map.png|thumb|200px|Map of Guatemala City]]

The city is divided into 21 zones (''zonas''). Zona 1 is the old historic center. Here are the national palace, the presidential palace, the cathedral, the main plaza, and the Central Market. South of Zona 1 is Zona 4, with many of the official buildings like the national bank, the national theatre, and the tourist board (INGUAT). Farther south is Zona 10 and Zona 9, divided by Avenida La Reforma. Zona 10 hosts most of the high class hotels, restaurants, bars, shopping facilities. A small part of Zona 10 is called ''Zona Viva'' (the lively zone) because of its nightlife.

===By bus===
The common way to get around in Guatemala City is by bus or taxi. Hardly anyone walks (people might find it odd if you do).   The below are what kind of buses are available:

* '''Transmetro''' [http://transmetro.muniguate.com/] are the green Volvo buses running on dedicated lanes separated from other traffic, on a fixed route basis, and only stop at a limited number of stations where passengers pay the fare while waiting. The vehicle and stations are guarded by municipal police and the drivers carry NO money.  This is the closest thing to a 'metro' in Guatemala City.  Currently there are two routes operating and plans are underway to build more dedicated lanes & stations to expand.

* '''Trans urbano''' [http://www.transurbano.com.gt] are the the blue & white buses similar to the 'Transmetro' only they don't have dedicated lanes, have more stops, and use the same lanes as other traffic.  Drivers carry NO money and access is controlled by a prepaid [http://www.siga.com.gt/siga SIGA card] which can only be obtained at specific customer service centers upon showing passports (for foreigners) or cedulas (national ID card for all others) and pre-paying the fare making them safer than the regular red city buses.  These cards are rechargeable and can be used on either the blue white Transurbano or the green Transmetro buses. The routes most useful to most travellers are the ones running between Plaza Barrios in Zona 1 and the Centra Norte terminal as well as the one traveling between Zona 1 & 10. Note: as of July 2019, it is possible to pay your ride (3Q) in cash to the guard standing next to the entrance gate in the bus, without having obtained a SIGA card. 

* Regular '''Red city buses''' are like the local version of the chicken buses running all over the city on multiple fixed routes and will stop anywhere on request.  These are the cheapest but the least safe way to travel within the city as they have been targeted for extortion (protection money), robbery and/or other crimes. They cost Q1.00 (Q1.25 on Sundays) per boarding and more at night.

===By taxi===
There are two kinds of taxis: the ones with a meter and the ones on which you have to agree on a price before the trip. Of the metered taxis, the best service is given by Taxis Amarillo (yellow cabs). It is not possible to hail them in the street so you have to call 1766. They will demand an address (they can sometimes by quite picky about getting an exact address: look around at nearby houses, and give the correct zona) and normally a telephone number, so it might be wise to have someone call on your behalf from a restaurant or so. With Amarillo, every trip is logged, and riding is considered safe.

The other kind of taxis are white. With these taxis you have to negotiate a price, and as you are a foreigner, they will most likely try to get more money from you as you will be viewed as a ''rich foreigner'', especially if you're from the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, or Western Europe. Normally, the white taxis should be cheaper, but unless you negotiate well, the yellow taxis might actually be the cheaper choice. There also is the question of safety. There are approximately 800 unregistered/unlicenced/stolen white taxis circulating around the city. If you do find a white taxi who is decent, the driver will be happy to give you a card and pick you up if you call in advance. Many locals who can afford the odd taxi have their favorite "taxista" whom they call, and the drivers themselves can refer you to another reliable driver should they be busy. The minimum price for a metered cab ride is 25Q. 

*Taxis Amarillo: [http://www.amarilloexpress.com/home.html] 1766. [servicioalcliente@amarilloexpress.com]
*Taxis Mariscal: 2473 2441
*Taxis Las Americas: 2362 0583
*Servitaxis Rotativos: 289 5188
*Blanco y Azul: 360 0903

===By Uber===
Uber arrived in Guatemala in 2016 and is now a reliable option in the city. A car is almost always just a few minutes away and it is cheaper and safer than a taxi. Specially in late hours of the night, it is advisable to use Uber instead of hailing a cab in the street for safety reasons.

As of September 2019, the Uber direction app does not seem very good in Guatemala, and the driver will often text to tell you that he is on the street and wants to know where you are.  Try to call for an Uber at an easy-to-describe location (such as a supermarket, hotel, police station) so that you can respond to the driver with the name of the business.  Also as of September 2019, Also, Uber seems to insert an zero into the license plate number that does not show on the plate (e.g., P0123456 when the plate is actually P123456), so look for the plate with and without the zero after the first letter.

Antique churches provide the capital city with a very special historic and architectural touch, such as Cerrito del Carmen, Catedral Metropolitana, Calvario, Iglesia de Santo Domingo, Iglesia de Yurrita, and Iglesia de la Merced.  The archaeological site of Kaminal Juyú is located within this capital city, which according to specialists, is a city buried under one of the most commercial areas of the city, comprising Zona 7 and Zona 11.

*'''Popol Vuh Museum''' [http://www.popolvuh.ufm.edu.gt], 6 Calle final, Zona 10, at the campus of Universidad Francisco Marroquín. Tel 361-2301/11. Mon-Fri 9:00-17:00 Sat 9:00-13:00. Q35 adults, Q15 students, Q15 for permission to take pictures (without flash), Q25 for video.

There is also a room dedicated to Colonial items. The explanations are in both English and Spanish. 

*'''Archaeology and Ethnology Museum''', 7 Avenida, Zona 13. Presents an archaeological sample of the Mayan civilization. This is where you find the famous ''Tikal mask''.

*'''Museum of Modern Art''', 7 Avenida, Zona 13. This is directly across from the Archeology and Ethnology Museum and the ticket from it should get people into both.

*'''Aurora Zoo''', Zona 13. See local and exotic animals in a decent environment. Make sure to listen to the songbirds that gather in the trees above. 

*'''Kaminaljuyu''', Zona 7. An early Maya ruin right in the heart of the city. The buildings are mostly mounds, however, the excavations have opened up a lot of areas that are interesting to tour.

==Do==

*'''Pacaya Volcano''' is about a 1.5 hour drive from downtown Guatemala City.  Going to a volanic rock area is a fairly easy 3 hour round trip hike.  In the volancio rock area, you will see steam coming from the rocks and there is a hole where you can roast marshmellows on a stick because of the heat.  There is lava about 15 meters underground. Entrance is about Q50 per person.  Hire a horse to ride up and down the mountain for about Q125 (you will have to negotiate the price and should specify up and down ["alto y baja"] in the negotiations).  A guide to the volcanic rock area is about Q200.  Parking is Q25 and there are bathrooms at the bottom.  You can take an Uber or taxi to Centro de Visitantes, Volcan Pacaya (99XM+QX San Vicente Pacaya, Guatemala).  If you take an Uber, make sure to negotiate round trip with the driver because you will probably not find a return trip if you let your driver go.  About Q500-Q600 (plus gas) is a fair price for the day for a three way trip from Guatemala City to Pacaya to Antiqua, with plenty of time for hiking and seeing Antiqua.  

Recreational activities can be done as well, from climbing volcanoes (Agua and Pacaya), to swimming in several recreational facilities, as well as water sports in Lago de Atitlán (lake).

For recreation, Zona Viva, an area of Zona 10 that has become the main center for nightlife.

'''Fútbol'''

If you want to experience a fútbol (football soccer) game in a fútbol nation, spend a Sunday morning/afternoon at Estadio Mateo Flores. You can catch a match of the most popular fútbol club in the country, CSD Municipal ("Los Rojos"). Tickets are cheap and you can get them at the stadium entrance. Go to [http://www.rojos.com] to see when there is a local match. "Palco" is the most expensive seating with ample spaced seats followed by "Preferencia", "Tribuna",where the "hinchas", or fanatics, sit and "General Sur y Norte" which are the cheapest. The first three are best for a good view.

The other big Guatemala City fútbol team is Comunicaciones ("Los Cremas"). If Municipal isn't playing, go see Comunicaciones play as they both share "Estadio Mateo Flores" as their home venue.

[[Image:Guatemala_textiles_lin_canola.jpg|250px|thumb|Selection of fabrics from Lin-Canola]]

Guatemala is famous for its textiles. In the city you should be able to find textiles from all over the country. If you are particularly interested in Guatemala or the Maya, you might find books (in Spanish) here that are hard to get anywhere else. For books in English, you get better prices at an online bookstore like Amazon in most cases.

===6 Avenida (Zona 1)===
This street has undergone massive changes in the last year and is now free of street vendors. Now almost fully pedestrianized, it is best experienced on a Sunday afternoon or early evening. Several coffeeshops and restuarants.

===The Aurora International Airport===
The Airport is going through remodeling in phases. The first phase, the North wing, has been finished as of December 2007. It is a modern design with nothing to envy from airports in developed nations. Phase two will see the construction of the South wing. When finished, the airport is said to be the most modern and largest airport in Central America being able to tend to 32 airplanes of different sizes at one time. 

One thing you should take home with you from Guatemala is the prize winning rum ''Ron Zacapa Centenario''. If you don't drink, somebody else is bound to be very happy for a bottle of this exquisite rum. The price tag is around $45 for a full liter, slightly cheaper than at a supermarket. Note that there are two duty-free shops. The fancy one everybody passes by on the way to/from the gates and one at the end of the terminal behind Gate 11. The latter one is about 20% cheaper for ''Ron Zacapa'' rum. The souvenir shops have some nice things if you need some last minute gifts before you leave the country (a bit more expensive than the markets, but not too bad). The books they sell at the airport are ridiculously expensive, double or triple price of a bookstore.

===ATM===
Visa is the most common credit card for use in ATMs. In the main shopping areas, especially in Zona 10, you should have no trouble finding an ATM that takes Visa.

There is a Visa/MasterCard ATM at the south side of the central plaza 8 Calle 5-36, a Visa-only ATM at 5 Avenida 9-39, and a MasterCard only at the corner of 5 Avenida/11 Calle, all in Zona 1.

Note that ATM key pads can be oriented with the 9 at the top left with the numbers descending right and down, or with the 1 at the top left with numbers ascending. If you have a spatial memory and have memorized the motion of punching in your PIN instead of the actual numerical sequence, you might be in for a surprise!

Safer to use ATM inside one of the Dispensa Familiar stores where guards reduce risk of card scanners, and BI machines rather than the more common Beta.

===Banks===
CitiBank or Citi is found throughout the country. The retail branch in Antigua is a fine place to bank and perform international transactions.

==Eat==

===Fast Food===
You can find quite an array of American fast food restaurants (McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, etc.) as well as Pollo Campero which is the most popular Guatemalan fast food chain. Fast food restaurants in Guatemala are very clean and accessible only to the middle class.

===Street Food===
Though a little risky, there are great street vendors that offer a variety of good local foods. Just remember to scope out the one with the best hygiene. 

*"'''Shucos'''" can be found in carts that are usually parked in between "Estadio del Ejercito" and "Campo Marte" zona 5. They are comparable to a super charged hot dog with guacamole, meats such as "longaniza", "chorizo", bacon etc... Just make sure you get the one with everything (Con todo).

*"'''Mangoes or Cucumbers with Salt, Pepitoria & Limón'''"You can also get sliced fruit such as magoes with "pepitoria" (roasted, crushed pumpkin seeds), salt, and lemon in a small clear bag. Or sliced oranges from carts all over the city. 

*"'''Gauchitos'''" are also good cart foods. They are basically a pattie with scrambled egg, "chimichurri" and some dressings on a bun. You can find them in various places throughout the city. One favorite is on the "Mirador" on Carretera a El Salvador. It sits adjacent to Cafesa, diner like restaurant, on an outlook overlooking the city. You can order a "Súper Gauchito", a soda, and sit and admire the hustle and bustle of the city below.

*"'''Atol de Elote'''" Is a very local and custom drink made from a corn (maize) base. It's somewhat sweet and a drink you must try. It's very rich so if you're not too hungry you can substitute it for a meal. The best place to try it is on the outlook on the other side of the city leaving towards Antigua. Just before you get to San Lucas. Its also another place where you can sit and admire the city from atop a mountain.

===Road to La Antigua Guatemala===
*'''Restaurante La Abuelita''', the best homemade food in San Lucas.


===Zona 10/Zona Viva===

There are phone booths spread out generously over the whole city. Most of them are from the company Claro, some from Telefónica, and most take only phone cards. Look for the sign ''Ladatel'' or ''Telefónica'' both on the phone booths and the places that sell the cards.

There are 3 cellular airtime service providers in this country (Claro, Tigo & Telefónica). GSM frequencies used are 850, 900, and 1900 MHz. If you have an unlocked cell phone that can use one of these three frequencies, you’ll find prepaid SIM cards for sale. Should your phone be of the wrong sort to use locally, very cheap prepaid phones with airtime are said to be available for as little as 150-200 GTQ.

==Stay safe==
Guatemala City can be either very safe or very dangerous, depending on the zona you're in. The city is generally safe, particularly during the day, and at night depending on the "zona" you're in. However you need to know what Zona you're in, as some zona's are places where you absolutely should not walk around at night or even be in to begin with. Zona 9, 10, 13, 14, 15 and 16 are ideal, and these are areas you can walk around at night without issue. 

So there are some things to watch out for:
*'''At night''' - There is a general rule of the thumb in Guatemala City (depending on the 'zona'): '''DON'T walk around at night'''. In most other Latin American cities you would be fine if going out at as a group and stay in nice areas but in Guatemala City most streets are empty at night. Unless you're in Zona 9, 10, 13, 14, 15 or 16, don't walk around at night. If you want to go somewhere else hop on a taxi or an Uber and make sure it leaves you in front of your destination. 
*'''Pickpockets''' - Pickpockets and thiefs are present in Guatemala City as in any other city in the world. Be careful in crowded streets of the city center and packed buses during the day. Always watch your belongings, don't carry more cash than you need for the day and don't put them all in one place. DON'T wear flashy jewelerry like necklaces, braclets, watches and especially earings that if snatched can injure their owner. In addition, don't show around your camera too much and, as hard as this might be, keep your phone usage to the BARE MINIMUM. 
*'''Public Transport''' - Public Transport in Guatemala City is quite limited and unfortunately a bit inefficient. Buses are the main way to get around followed by taxis and Ubers. You can use buses with a high degree of safety during the day (always watch out for pickpockets) but DON'T use buses at night. Incidents occur inside buses that range from sexual harassment to armed robberies every night. Taxis are okay to use but never hail a cab on the street or enter white taxis; most of them are not regulated and you have a very high chance of being robbed. Use official taxi apps from reputable companies to call a taxi. Uber is another safe and cheap method to get around
*'''Driving''' - Driving in Guatemala City can be kind of hectic especially during rush hour when the roads are packed. Due to the fact that public transport ranges from inefficient to tragic, most residents move around by car and this can result in huge traffic jams at some times during the day. Be on watch for aggressive drivers. At night it's better to stay on the main avenues and always drive with your windows closed. Car-jackings are not uncommon in isolated streets and even in the avenues after midnight. If a person or a group comes suspiciously close to your car when you're stopped in a red light '''GO'''. It's very unlikely that you'll get in trouble and even the police do it sometimes. 
*'''Police''' - The police in Guatemala unfortunately is not very effective due to being under-funded by the goverment and some police officers have problems with corruption. Be alert if you're stopped but also be polite; not everyone is corrupt and some policemen/-women are nice and helpful.
*'''Political Demonstrations''' - Public Demonstration against the goverment do happen sometimes in Guatemala City. They don't usually turn violent but it's better to just stay out of them and continue your way. 

'''If you're mugged DON'T RESIST'''. Chances are that you will be injured if you resist and even, in some cases, killed. Cooperate with the thiefs, no matter how upsetting this might be and hand them over what they want (most likely cash, passports or jewellery). It's not worth risking your life for something that's ultimately material and recoverable. 

===The Zones===
Guatemala City is divided into different Zones. It's essential to know which zones are safe, less safe or a complete no-go for tourists. Here's a rundown of the zones:
*'''Zona 1''' - Zona 1 is essentially the downtown of Guatemala City. This where you will most likely start your tour of the city as here are most of the tourist attractions. During the day you'll find many visitors seeing the sights and locals shopping, eating or working. It's ok to wander the zone during the day but stay in populated areas and don't enter side streets. At night avoid the zone COMPLETELY. Once shops close the area becomes deserted and dark. There are many cheap hotels and hostels here but it's better to stay in another a bit pricier but ''safer'' part of town. 
*'''Zona 10, 13, 14, 15 and 16''' - Zones 10, 13, 14, 15 and 16 are essentially the "safe" areas of Guatemala where the upper middle class and wealthy citizens live. These areas are full of gated communities like Colonia Oakland, Colonia La Canada (where many foreign embassies are located) and others. Here are also the cities more reputable hotels aimed directly at tourists. 
*'''Zona 2, 4, and 17''' - Zones 2, 4, 9 and 17 are the "middle" zones when it comes to crime. They are generally considered nice for tourists to stay but you should be more vigilant here at nighttime than in the safer aforementioned zones. You should always do more research when booking a hotel in Zona 2 and Zona 17 as some parts are much more dangerous than others. 
*'''Zona 3, 5..8, 11, 12, 17...21''' - All the Zones from 5 to 8 and 17 to 21 along with Zona 3 and Zones 11-12 are very dangerous. '''Tourists SHOULD NOT go there at any time of day'''. These are the parts of the city where 80% of the violent crime happens as armed robberies and muggings are common even at noon. You should know too that some of these Zones (like the notorious Zona 3) are controlled by gangs who won't hesitate to shoot at you if you enter the area, even accidentally. 

One thing to always keep in mind is that '''crime is present EVERYWHERE in Guatemala City'''. The fact that you're in Zona 15 or Colonia Oakland doesn't mean that you should have your guard down at night; some might even warn you not to walk around even in these areas after 1-2am. Always be vigilant in the Guatemalan capital.

==Stay healthy==
Guatemala City is at a somewhat high elevation (about 1500 m) in the mountains (plus the air is very polluted in Zona 1), so if you are coming from a location near sealevel, you might wish to plan to take it easy and get extra rest on your first day while your body adjusts to the altitude.

Also, make sure that any food that you eat is well-washed and well-cooked, or you might get quite ill.

*'''Centro Médico''', 6 Avenida 3-47, Zona 10. Tel 334-2157/384-2600/332-3555. 24 hour service.
*'''Hospital Bella Aurora''', 10 Calle 2-31, Zona 14. Tel 384-3535. 24 hour service.
*'''Hospital Universitario Esperanza''', 6 Avenida 7-49, Zona 10. Tel 362-8626.

===Pharmacy===
Pharmacies are all over the city.

==Cope==
If you have electrical equipment that need 220-240V 50Hz input instead of the country's standard 110V 60Hz, you can find a transformer at Electronica Panamericana, 3 Avenida y 11 Calle, Esquina, Zona 9. They have various models with prices depending on how much power you require. Q230 for a 500-Watts transformer.

Also, in the smaller hotels/motels, the electrical outlets only take 2-pronged plugs.  So, if you have a laptop, for example, you'll need a plug adapter that will allow you to utilize the 2-pronged outlets.
