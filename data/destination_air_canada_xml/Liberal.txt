==Get in==
Liberal is located in the heart of the Great Plains with a trading area covering the corners of five states: Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico and Kansas. It was named for the early day settlers who were "liberal" with the scarce supply of water. The City is positioned at the crossroads of U.S. Highway 54 and U.S. Highway 83. The Liberal Mid-America Regional Airport is located within the city limits of Liberal and serves commercial, freight and private aircraft traffic. 

Liberal is served (current as of 12/2007) by United Express/Skywest from Denver (airport code "LBL"), or by Amtrak to Dodge City or Garden City (about one hour away) and driving.  There is currently no Greyhound Bus service.

* '''Seward County Museum''', 587 E. Cedar, [http://www.sewardcountymuseum.com/]. Features the Coronado Museum, Dorothy's House, Land of Oz and Riverside School.  The Coronado Museum is housed in the magnificent old Larabee home built in 1918 that was moved in 1961 from it's original location (be sure to see the pictures of the move!).  The rooms of the house feature general and local southwestern Kansas history, Native American History relevant to the area and many displays of 'old-time' equipment ranging from farm implements to doctor's utensils to a post office window. On the museum grounds are found native tamarack, sand hill plums, cottonwood trees and wild roses in addition to the famous 'Yellow Brick Road'.  Ask to see the cement pancakes created by LeRoy Chance for the Pancake Day race, which were originally located at the start of the race, in front of the Liberal Public Library.  They are currently stored in the barn out back along with other larger pieces of farm equipment and an entire turn-of-the-century homestead shack.
