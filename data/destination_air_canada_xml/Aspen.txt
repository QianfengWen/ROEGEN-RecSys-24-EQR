Independence Pass is only open in the summer months, but provides spectacular views and can be a bit faster than the longer route through Glenwood. To take this route, travel south from Copper Mountain exit off I70 through Leadville. For the Glenwood Springs route, take I-70 all the way to Glenwood Springs and then head south on Colorado State Highway 82.

===By bus===
Scheduled and chartered services are available from Denver International Airport and Eagle County Regional Airport.

[[Image:Maroon Bells Wilderness Aspen Colorado USA.jpg|thumb|Maroon Bells near Aspen]]
*John Denver Sanctuary - this Aspen park is a pleasant place to take your dogs or kids for a splash in the creek in summertime. The park is named after the famous country and folk singer who resided in Aspen. Lyrics from his most popular songs are inscribed in the creekside boulders. John Denver Sanctuary is on the creek trail on the north side of Aspen, near the Rio Grande Park at N. Mill St. and Rio Grande Pl. 

*Maroon Bells - a short drive outside of Aspen, the Maroon Bells are one of the most photographed mountain scenes in Colorado. The views of the small lakes and the 14,000 foot peaks are spectacular. There are some short, non-strenuous hikes around the Maroon Bells that vary from 1 mile to 10. People also like to climb the Maroon Bells; however, it is very dangerous, and a guide is highly recommended. In the summer months (mid-June to the first weekend in October) between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., visitors must take a shuttle bus to the Maroon Bells to control traffic. Tickets are $6 for adults and $4 for children. Board the bus at the Aspen Highlands Village. Parking at the village is $5 per vehicle. Another option is to take the free shuttle from the Rubey Park Transit Center to the village. In non-summer months, you may drive yourself. The entry fee is $10 per vehicle. The area is run by the U.S. Forest Service, and they accept national parks passes. Campgrounds are also available.

*Independence Pass - In the summer months, this pass is open to vehicular traffic. The drive south of Aspen takes you up to the Continental Divide and along the way, passes some of the most beautiful scenery in the area and a ghost town that is open to visitors.
