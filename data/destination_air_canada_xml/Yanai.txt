Yanai's most famous attribute is the charming and picturesque '''Shirakabe No Machi''' located approximately 1km north of the Yanai JR station.  Most of the homes and buildings in the district date back to the Edo Period (1603-1867). There are many shops specializing in local handicrafts as well as a locally famous Soy Sauce factory.

Located in '''Shirakabe no Machi''' is the large and culturally important '''House of Kunimori Family'''.  the house, built in the late 18th Century is a good example of a typical merchant class residence from the mid-Edo period.  Admission is ¥200 for adults and ¥100 for children.  

A much larger museum and old merchant residence is '''Muroyama no Sono'''.  The residence was constructed by the Oda family around 1702 from revenues generated from the family's control of the lucrative rapeseed oil trade in western Japan.  The complex, which has been faithfully preserved, includes several warehouses and ancestral home that showcase various antiques from the Edo period as well as items from the Meiji and Showa eras.  An elderly man, who is a descendant of the Oda family, is the curator and can provide a wonderful insight into the building and many of its contents.  Admission fee is ¥350 for adults and ¥200 for children.  Open 9-5 every day except Wednesdays.  

The Shokoan Temple grounds hosts a small well with nearby willow tree that is reputed to be the origin of name of Yanai (Well of the Willow Tree in Japanese).  According to legend, a princess traveling through the region 1400 years ago is said to have briefly stopped at the well to quench her thirst.  A tooth pick discarded near the well during this brief stop is said to have grown into the large willow tree occupying the location currently.  Admission is free.
