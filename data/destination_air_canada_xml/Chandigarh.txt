'''Chandigarh''' [http://chandigarh.nic.in/] is [[India]]'s first planned city, quite distinct from the rest of the country and considerably better organized. It is the capital of both [[Haryana]] and [[Punjab (India) | Punjab]], but the city itself is not part of either state, being a union territory, i.e. administered directly by the central government.

==Understand==
[[Image:OpenHand.JPG|thumb|300px|Le Corbusier's Open Hand]]
The most striking thing about the city is the expanse of resplendent blue sky with the mountains in the backdrop. When you are approaching the city, you would see the jagged skyline of the Shivalik Hills looming large over the city and the faint image of an old temple dedicated to Goddess Chandi (15 km from Chandigarh) from which the city got its name. 

Chandigarh may appear oddly familiar to Western visitors and idiosyncratic to the rest of India. Because of this, Chandigarh is a good place to visit if you need a break from the constant flow of which is often said to assault the senses, and can be overwhelming to foreign travellers. 

Chandigarh is also a very secure city. With the lowest crime rates in the country, you can feel safe at any hour. 

The political position of Chandigarh is quite ambiguous for anybody not knowing the city well. It is the capital to two northern Indian states Punjab and Haryana besides being a union territory in itself. The birth of this modern, youngest and vibrant city was an act of anguish and drama that took place at the time of partition of India and Pakistan. [[Lahore]], the historical capital of Punjab was ceded to Pakistan and Chandigarh was conceived to be a symbol of India's freedom.  

The government of the state decided to build a new city at the foot of the Shivalik hills. Architects Albert Mayer and Mathew Novicki drew the initial plans in New York. When the latter died in an air crash in 1950, the work was entrusted to renowned Swiss born, French architect Edouard 'Le Corbusier' Jeanneret who created Chandigarh as a city of "Sun, Space and Verdure" to fulfill basic functions of working, living, and care of body and spirit. It is the first planned city in independent India. Today, the city is home to more than 900 000 people living in harmonious conditions that are considered to be the best in the country. 

[[Image:ChandigarhSecretariat.JPG|thumb|300px|Le Corbusier's Secretariat Building]]
One can see architectural genius in the neat geometrical design of residential quarters, reinforced concrete structures and self-contained area layouts. Chandigarh is divided into 47 self-contained sectors. Each sector of the city is designed with its own shops, academic, and health care buildings, and places of worship, open spaces, greenery and the residential areas. Chandigarh is one of the best planned cities of India. Roads are pretty wide and spacious. It hasnt grown in a haphazard way as some of other Indian cities have.

The city is divided into four major work areas. In the north, the capital complex, consisting of the Secretariat, Legislative Assembly and High Court, with the hills as a background dominating the city. Punjab and Haryana High Court at Chandigarh (also known simply as Chandigarh High Court) has original as well as appellate and supervisory jurisdiction over all matters pertaining to Chandigarh, Punjab and Haryana. Sector 17, which is the city and district centre, houses the administrative and state government offices, as well as shopping malls, banks and other offices. The west contains the university, and institutions of engineering, architecture, Asian studies and medicine. Finally, the east zone, which is the industrial area of the city. Chandigarh is one of the few planned cities in India, the others being [[Gandhinagar]] in [[Gujarat]] and [[Bhubaneswar]] in [[Orissa]]. 

In 1966, the [[Hindi phrasebook|Hindi]]-speaking areas were split from the [[Punjabi phrasebook|Punjabi]] speaking areas of the state to form a new state of [[Haryana]]. Chandigarh, however, continued to be the capital of both Punjab and Haryana. In a strange anomaly, the city itself was not made part of either state to avoid any dispute but instead brought under direct rule by the Central Government as a '''union territory'''. It was agreed that in 1986, the city would pass to Punjab, but this has been indefinitely delayed because Haryana insists on getting some territory in return, and the two states have not been able to agree on it.

===By train===

There is frequent service to and from New Delhi. The popular trains connecting New Delhi include Kalka (Chandigarh) Shatabdi Express (twice daily) and the economical Chandigarh Jan Shatabdi Express (Una (H.P) to Delhi). Shatabdi Express is quite popular and it is better to have an advanced reservation at least 2-3 days prior to the journey.

Traveling by smaller vehicles like Indica is the most common mode of cab transfers on this route. The highway is pretty scenic.

While it is good to take the cabs for travel on this route in summers, it should be avoided in winters due to heavy fog. Dec -Feb are winter months in India. Chandigarh, being situated in laps of mountains, faces heavy fog in night and early morning. Sometimes the visibility on roads get reduced to less than six feet in such times.

Delhi is extensively connected with bus service every 15 min offered by Chandigarh Transport Undertaking, Haryana Roadways, Punjab Roadways and Himachal Roadways. Volvo A/C buses are also run on Chandigarh-Delhi section and offer connection to the Airport and towns like Gurgaon. The fares of Volvo buses are usually comparable with the Shatabdi Express. The Haryana State Transport service allows you to book the tickets to Delhi, IGI Airport and Gurgaon online here.[http://hartrans.gov.in/online/index_cf.asp].

Chandigarh Transport Undertaking offers a comprehensive connectivity between the two bus terminals with air conditioned and normal buses plying throughout the day between the terminals.

There are many private local taxi services in the city like Chandigarh car rentals Black Taxi India, Hiway Cabs, Guru Taxi Service Chandigarh, Amy Cab Chandigarh, Gagan Taxi Service  Gill Taxi Service. The private taxi operators can be located at Taxi stands in the Commercial market of every sector.

UT administration has authorized many taxi service operators who offer a fully air-conditioned cab service. The cabs are available at the doorstep on giving a call. The cabs are stationed at important places including Railway Station and Airport. The cabs are fully air-conditioned and extremely comfortable. They serve Chandigarh and satellite towns of [[Panchkula]] and [[Mohali]]. All the taxis are brand new, air-conditioned/air heated and driven by the uniformed drivers.

Available on call at +91-9023-121-121 or through the "Jugnoo - autos on demand" app on android and iOS stores.

On the whole, Auto Rickshaw are not quite popular in the city although are easily available at Bus Terminals, Railway Station, and Auto Stands in the commercial market of every sector. It is very unlikely that they would operate with a meter so negotiate the price before engaging one.

===By Cycle Rickshaw===

Cycle rickshaws are three-wheeled pedal powered rickshaws with seats in the back to seat passengers and a driver in the front. They are good for short distances, or places which are too far to walk but too short for taking a bus/taxi/auto rickshaw. Cycle rickshaws can be easily spotted in all parts of the city. You should negotiate the price before boarding one of these.  Ask the locals to help if you doubt the charges demanded.

===By cycle===

[[Image:High Court.JPG|thumb|120px|High Court front entrance]]

* '''Rock Garden''' [http://www.nekchand.com] designed by Nek Chand. One day 36 years ago, Nek Chand, a humble transport official, began to clear a little patch of jungle to make himself a small garden area. He set stones around the little clearing and before long had sculpted a few figures recycled from materials he found at hand. Gradually Nek Chand's creation developed and grew; before long it covered several acres and comprised of hundreds of sculptures set in a series of interlinking courtyards. After his normal working day Chand worked at night, in total secrecy for fear of being discovered. When they did discover the garden, local government officials were thrown into turmoil. The creation was completely illegal - a development in a forbidden area. However, rather than demolishing the garden, they decided to give Nek Chand a salary so that he could concentrate full-time on his work, plus a workforce of fifty labourers.  The park is open daily from April to September between 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 3 to 7 p.m. Between October and March, it is open from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 to 6 p.m.

* '''Sukhna Lake''' Located in Sector 1, the Sukhna Lake is an artificial reservoir. A popular place to hang out, one can expect to find residents of the city jogging or strolling along the banks. There is a walking path, a cafeteria, shops and a mini-amusement park and paddleboats. The Sukhna Lake was created in 1958 by damming the Sukhna Choe, a seasonal stream that flows down from the Shivaliks. Storks and cranes make migratory stops at the lake. The lake, incidentally, has Asia's longest water channel for rowing and yachting. One can also rent a bicycle from pedalchandigarh and roam around the lake on a bicycle. available through email at pedalchandigarh@gmail.com. Also you can check their webpage pedalchandigarh.blogspot.in

* '''Rose Garden''': The city houses the largest rose garden in Asia. It also hosts annual rose festival which is quite popular among local population.

* '''The Capitol''' Most of the capitol complex is fenced off due to tight security, the open hand is accessible and from there you can see the main buildings,  albeit in the distance. If you want a closer look at the Capitol, you need permission from the Tourist Bureau, in the â€˜Deluxe Administration buildingâ€™ in Sector 9.  Please note the capitol and bureau are only open on M-F.  The tourist bureau is not well signed, youâ€™ll need to ask. Itâ€™s in the single story building out the back.   Bring your passport and prepare for the beginning of the most amazing experience in Indian bureaucracy. One can also get the permit from the Tourist Reception Centre in Sector 17 Plaza. All in all I spent three hours in total of which 50 minutes was spent looking at architecture.  The tourist bureau gives you three letters giving you permission to visit the three main buildings of the Capitol complex, The Secretariat, the High Court and the Assembly. 

* '''The High Court''' - The letter is fine for looking around the High Court just show to security at the entrance, around the back, but if you want to take photos you need to surrender your camera, and head in to fill out some more forms in the protocol office, and the take the forms back to security to get your camera back.  Itâ€™s worth it as the building is amazing, and extremely photogenic.  You canâ€™t take any photos indoors.

*'''The Secretariat''' - To check out the Secretariat, itâ€™s a little harder.  First you need to find â€˜receptionâ€™, which is just a small building out the back and show them your letter to get a visitor permit, then you need to see security who will let you in, then you need to see the main security officer inside, who will send you up to the registrar who will then send you back to the main security office.  Thankfully you are escorted through most of this confusing, overly complex procedure, usually by a junior soldier with large machine gun.  Whole process takes about 30 min. to an hour.  Once itâ€™s all clear you can go up to the roof, check out the geranium gardens, and take in an expansive view of all of Chandigarh.  Then theyâ€™ll let you have a look out the front, which is more interesting.

* '''The Legislative Assembly (both for Punjab and Haryana)''' - Ran out of time, so make sure you have a whole clear weekday to appreciate all the capitol buildings.

[[Image:Pinjore.JPG|thumb|180px|Pinjore Gardens]]

*'''Pinjore Gardens''' - Pinjore Gardens, also called  Yadavindra Gardens, are 20 km (12 mi) from  Chandigarh and 15 km (9 mi) from  [[Panchkula]], on the Chandigarh Shimla road. Taxis and buses ply regularly between Pinjore and Chandigarh. Pinjore lies on the foothills of the lower Shivalik ranges. The fascinating gardens in the Mughal style are one of the most popular picnic spots in the region. A mini zoo, plant nursery and Japanese garden, as well historic palaces and picnic lawns await tourists.

*'''Museum and Art Gallery''' - Located in Sector 10, the museum and the combined art gallery is an interestin palce to go to. Artefacts range form the Harrapan Period relics to the paintings and coins from different areas and time periods. The Art Gallery has good collections of ancient and modern Indian art.  Fossils of the local dinosaurs found in the region are on show in the adjacent natural history museum.  The buildings that the Museums and Art Gallery are housed in are attractive.
<b>The Chandigarh Museum</b>, which is just next door, provides an interesting aspect on how Chandigarh was founded. It begins with the principles on which Chandigrh was built, selection of the Architects, the design for the people etc.  The correspondence between the Punjabi officials overseeing the construction of the city, and the Federal Government in Delhi is fascinating, and well worth taking a few minutes to read.
*'''Mohali cricket stadium''' - This is a lush green cricket stadium and people throng here in masses during the cricket matches which the stadium hosts on regular basis

Frequent misspellings of the names of Italian dishes, unpardonable at ''these'' prices (e.g. "Penne Pomodoro Bassilico" for "penne al pomodoro e basilico", etc.).  "Spaghetti con Fungi [''sic'']", apart from the misspelling, is translated in the menu as "Black fungus [''sic''] in pesto cream sauce", which may put some off (unnecessarily).  The buffet breakfasts (7:00AM~10:30AM; Rs 675), lunches (12:30PM~3:00PM; Rs 1,100), and dinners (7:30PM~11:30PM; Rs 1,300~1,400) here are mostly geared towards the Indian palate and best avoided (the atmosphere, somewhat sterile in the best of times, also changes for the worse during these communal feeding periods).  The WiFi comes at a premium here (Rs 140 for 30 minutes).</eat>

===Bed and Breakfast===
The Chandigarh Administration has launched a bed and breakfast scheme for accommodating more tourists in Chandigarh. This scheme provides a reasonable and comfortable alternative to tourists and visitors in the city.The residential premises registered under this scheme are registered as establishments under two categories Gold and Silver. Rooms are available at Rs.900/- and Rs.700/-. Details[http://chandigarhtourism.gov.in/]. The scheme apparently has been canceled since the year 2009 by the district administration due to violation of the norms[http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/business/chandigarh-scraps-its-bed-and-breakfast-scheme_100262133.html]

===Budget===

Lodgings in central Chandigarh are notoriouly overpriced, and the expense is generally not matched by quality improvements. Don't be surprised to be asked over 1000 rupees/night for a dingy room without windows in sector 22. As a Union Territory, both Federal and State taxes can be added to your bill (approx. 18%).

There is a number of budget housing options (of price and quality comparable to typical Indian cities) located in the large market area of sector 45. The area itself is considerably more "Indian" than the central districts, with its narrow winding streets and a strong community feel. As of February 2013, you should aim at 500 rupees/night in this area, after some haggling, and there are many hotels to choose from.

==Contact==
STD code for Chandigarh is 0172. When calling from overseas, dial +91 172 XXXXXXX. The same STD code is shared by [[Panchkula]] and [[Mohali]]. If you have a non-working phone number with only 6 digits, try to add a "2" in front of it.

Chandigarh has one of the highest cellular density in India. The city is served by all major cellular operators : Airtel, Vodafone, Reliance, BSNL, Tata Indicom, Docomo, Virgin, Spice, and Connect. The cellular connection provided covers the cellular network of state of Punjab and city limits of [[Panchkula]] district in Haryana.

If you do not have an Indian phone number, it is strongly recommended that you get a pre-paid calling card if you plan on using your phone frequently. Because of new government regulations, you need a photocopy of your passport (visa and the ID pages), a colour photo, and proof of local address (in Chandigarh) when buying a pre-paid card.  Pre-paid cards are sold in a few of the shops that sell mobile equipment.

PCOs are a good option. You will find them almost every 100 m. These are public pay-phones (post-pay) and there will be a person on the shop to take the payments. Check your bill generated (from the billing machine) and make the payment accordingly. Payments are always in Indian rupees. 

Internet is cheaply and easily accessible via various cyber cafes operating in every corner of the city with rates ranging from Rs 15-Rs 30 per hour.

Major Cyber Outlets:

*Reliance Web World: Operates through various centres in Sector 9, Sector 35, Sector 46, etc.
*Sify Centres: Spread throughout the city.

==Stay safe==
Chandigarh is a safe city. With the lowest crime rates in the country, you can feel safe at any hour. Police assistance can be found at the nearest police station or at the patrolling booths in every sector.

You can call following numbers for respective help : '''100 (Police)''', '''101 (Fire)''', '''102 (Ambulance)''', '''1073 (Traffic Police Helpline)'''. If you are calling from a mobile phone, just add the STD code such as  '''0172''' in front of the emergency numbers. This is true in any other Indian city.

==Cope==
===Balance===
India is often said to assault the senses, and can be overwhelming to travelers. Chandigarh may appear oddly familiar to Western visitors and idiosyncratic to the rest of India. Because of this, Chandigarh is a good place to visit if you need a break from the constant flow of India.

===Hospitals===
List of major hospitals and health care centres:
