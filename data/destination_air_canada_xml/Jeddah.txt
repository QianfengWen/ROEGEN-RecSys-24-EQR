{{pagebanner|Jeddah Banner.jpg}}


'''Jeddah''' (جِدّة, also spelled ''Jiddah'') is on the Red Sea in western [[Saudi Arabia]]. It is the second largest city, with a population of approximately 3,400,000, and a major commercial center in the country.

==Understand==
Jeddah has been a port and trading city for centuries, which is reflected in its cosmopolitan mix of inhabitants. Today, it is a major commercial center in Saudi Arabia. It also has many government offices. Jeddah is known in the kingdom for its shopping districts, restaurants and cafes. It also hosts the '''Jeddah Corniche''' (waterfront area), which is the largest in the Kingdom with a great bunch of hotels, beaches and resorts clustered around it.  To the north of the city, a string of beach resort compounds are known as party spots where many of the social mores of the rest of the country are flouted, especially by rich, liberal families from Jeddah.

Jeddah is also the main entry point, either by air or sea, for pilgrims making the [[Hajj]] pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]], the two sacred cities of Islam. Both are a few hours inland from Jeddah. 

===Orientation===
Jeddah is a huge city that sprawls along the coast of the Red Sea, connected together by the '''Corniche''', a seaside avenue full of bizarre sculptures and nearly 30 km long.  The old city or '''al-Balad''', on the southern side of modern Jeddah, is a crumbling but fascinating warren of multi-story houses made from coral.  The main thoroughfare '''Medina Road''' starts from the northern side of al-Balad and runs all the way to the city.

==Get in==

===By plane===

'''King Abdulaziz International Airport'''[http://www.jed-airport.com], ({{IATA|JED}}), is the largest airport in the Kingdom and is well served by airlines from around the world. 

Jeddah Airport had recently been moved to the new terminal. It is the biggest Airport in Saudi. The old South terminal is already closed and now all domestic and international flights are operated through terminal 1 

The airport is considered the top airport in Saudi and at current stage it serves 30 million passengers with plans to accommodate up to 100 million passengers in subsequent stage. 

====Connections to the city====

A taxi to the city from either will cost between SR60 to SR130, so agree on the fare before you set off. It is cheaper to go with one of the locals at arrival terminals who will be offering his services.

===By bus===
Also there are many bus routes to neighboring countries, especially [[Jordan]].
Usually bus trip starts in [[Syria]] down to [[Amman]], [[Jordan]] then to most Saudi major cities. However, make sure before booking your seat that you don't have a "by air only" entry visa.
Most bus companies in [[Amman]] are located in '''Abdali'''. Ticket price is around 25 JD, some companies have daily trips to large cities like '''Jeddah'''. Make sure to check buses before booking, as some companies have old and small seats buses (this is a long trip, so make sure to pick a company with "business class" buses, some companies offer business class buses at a price cheaper than "normal buses" companies!).
Trip is about 18 hours nonstop through [[Medina]] route (there are two routes for the trip, sea route passing by '''Yanbua''' which is a rough one but short, and Medina route)

===By ferry===
Travelers coming from Egypt and Sudan, precisly Port Sudan, have a choice to take a ferry. Jeddah is becoming a cruise ship destination. There're cruisers of MSC Cruises and Silversea stopping there.

==Get around==

===By car===

Many of the hotels chains have a "water taxi" or a small minivan that will take you to the mall and main shopping areas. Taxis are very inexpensive, with most 10 minute rides costing about SR10-20 (about USD $3-6). There are two types of taxis: one is yellow and will have a sign that says, simply, TAXI. They are usually cheaper, but a little "rougher" on the inside and out and and usually are not air conditioned. But they are very rare in Jeddah now. And the other is the more common white, air conditioned, better quality taxis locally known as "Limousines". There is a rule in KSA that a Limousine must not be older than 5 years. So most Limousines are either new or fairly new. Most Limousines are Toyota Camry's, Hyundai Elantras and Hyundai Sonatas, but it is not uncommon to see more high end Limousines which will be privately owned, licensed taxis. Limousine taxis are about USD $1-3 more expensive. There are also "unlicensed" taxis, those are normal cars (usually a Toyota Camry) without the "TAXI" sign. Those taxis are cheaper than a "Limousine" but these Taxis are not legal. Police take strict actions against such Taxis but but the passenger is usually just left to take another taxi. Try to avoid getting in such taxis, besides, you will most probably not be saving more than SR10(about USD $3). Normally they honk or flash their lights when they see you standing by the road.

Take note that you can negotiate with a taxi driver for a fixed price, which is much cheaper than using the meter. Hardly any resident of Jeddah asks to use the meter. Though this needs some "experience" with Jeddah and its streets. Sometimes a taxi driver will pretend to be "lost" so he would turn on the meter or make you pay extra in exchange for his "lost time". Whatever the case, never pay more than you agreed to pay at the beginning of the ride. The average taxi fee is SR10-30,depending on how far your destination is and the traffic crowd.
Also take note that some Saudi drivers ask for higher prices but if you need to get there fast and aren't faint of heart, then a Saudi driver is your best bet. On the other hand, if you want to get there cheaply and safely, then go for Indian or Pakistani drivers.

Many rental agencies, like Avis or Budget, will rent you the latest mid-size car for the price of SR100-140 (about USD $30-50) per day. You'll also find a bargain when it comes to fuel, as Saudi Arabia has some of the cheapest petrol prices in the world (USD $0.36 a gallon for 91 octane gas, and USD $0.48 for 95 octane gas).
The streets are wide, but often crowded due to numerous roadworks throughout the city, and signs are written in both Arabic and English. Look for maps in the libraries or big supermarkets.

If you have access to the internet you may book a car/limo using applications such as UBER, Careem or EasyTaxi. The cars provided are clean, the drivers are friendly and the fare is cheap. Plus, you don't have to worry about communicating directions, most of these apps are joined with google maps.

===By bus===
Buses are not a commonly-used means of transportation in Jeddah even though you can ride one for SR1-2 from certain main streets to Albalad (downtown). It is, however, a very interesting way to enjoy traditional Arab music and the sound of people mixing together all while enjoying sights during the ride. Smaller buses are mostly private so the owner is responsible for cleanliness. Larger buses are provided by the government, which are big and clean but don't follow a schedule, so consider using the smaller buses if you're on a specific timetable.

===By boat===
Boats are not particularly a means of transportation, but rather a way to enjoy the views of the Red Sea. You can catch boats in Obhur north of Jeddah at the marina; a one hour ride in a small boat is around SR200 (US$55).

==See==
* <see name="Al-Balad" alt="" address="" directions="" lat="" long="" phone="" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">Jeddah's top sight is Al-Balad or the old town. The city wall has long since been torn down, but the old gates still mark where it once stood.  Within you'll find a warren of ancient buildings and traditional souqs (markets), and the teetering, multistory "coral houses" that Jeddah is famous for. Unfortunately, coral is not a very durable building material, and most of the buildings are in disrepair. Spend time wandering around the old city and get lost in the seemingly endless souks. You will find yourself in another world and entirely 'in' the world, surrounded by people form all over the Arab world, Asia and Africa. Here you will see many forms of dress that are colorful as well as the traditional black. Many of the shops and stores are cut into the sides of buildings and offer stacks of colorful clothing.</see>

===Scuba diving===

[[Scuba diving]] is a major draw for ex-pats in the Kingdom, although the Saudis seem oblivious to the treasures that await offshore.  

Because of Jeddah's location on the Red Sea, flora and fauna are quite similar to what you'd see on [[Egypt]]'s [[Red Sea Coast]] or of the [[Sinai]] Peninsula, only minus all the tourists.  

Visibility can be spectacular (30-40m is common) and the corals are virtually untouched. There are plenty of interesting sites to explore like the '''Chicken Wreck''', a boat carrying tons of frozen chicken that hit the reef and sunk at a depth of 10-18m.  Most of the better dive sites are around one hour out to sea by speed boat.

The Red Sea gets chilly in the winter, with water temperatures dropping to 22&deg;C, so you'll want to use a 5 mm wetsuit with a hood. In summer, temperatures climb up to a much more balmy 29&deg;C, and 3mm shorty or 1 mm dive skin is plenty.

The Amazon Ride is spread over an area of 1,800m² with a lagoon and 15m high waterfall.  Seven restaurants, party rooms and a games arcade are housed in the entertainment building. The party rooms can be reserved by the public for birthday parties and private gatherings at pretty reasonable rates. The park also has a European village theme area, a Far East village area and a large number of retail outlets for souvenirs and soft toys for the children. The complex has a separate building for car parking which can accommodate 300 cars plus an additional open air parking facility which has an additional capacity of 300 cars.</do>

===Basketball Parks===
Jeddah is flourishing with the number of expats from the philippines. With basketball being the number one sport for filipinos, it may come as a great surprise for basketball enthusiasts, the number of ball parks present in Jeddah.

==Learn==

==Work==

There are many places to find work in Jeddah and jobs are plentiful, but unemployment among Saudi nationals remains high especially among the youth population. One must obtain a visa to work in Saudi Arabia and the complicated process can only begin with a sponsorship from a company or individual already located in the Kingdom. Western expats cannot simply arrive in Saudi Arabia and then look for employment; needless to say, Western women will experience great challenges in finding employment.

Jeddah is full of restaurants with almost every cuisine imaginable and eating out is part of the city's culture. All the restaurants have separate sections for single men and for families. Dating is theoretically forbidden but widely practiced, and most restaurants will allow a couple into the family section without question. All businesses close for prayer for about half an hour at noon and at sunset. They close again an hour after sunset for about 45 minutes. If you like to eat early, you can often stay in a restaurant during prayer time. Saudis tend to eat late, well after the evening prayer.

The standard cheap meal is the shawarma - giant layers of beef or chicken turning on a vertical spit. Thin slices are cut off and served with vegetables, garlic, and sauce in pita bread. You can also find a few falafel shops or eat at boofias (cornershops). Another thing that is very cheap is ''Homus,'' which is the paste of white chickpeas mixed with olive oil, and is very tasty. Try the Filipino Souk near Saudia City. Ask for the Pakistani area Kababish. There's a group of shops and restaurants with very low prices. Most of the American Fast Food franchises can be found in Jeddah, including McDonald's, Applebee's, Subway, and numerous others.

==Drink==

Like all Saudi Arabian cities, you aren't going to find much nightlife revolving around alcohol in Jeddah, since Saudi Arabia is a Muslim country. What you should be able to find are ''shisha'' cafes and a large variety of coffeeshops such as: Java Lounge, Vertigo, Starbucks, Mugs & Beans, Costa Coffee and Second Cup. Non-alcoholic beer is available in restaurants as are non-alcoholic cocktails and drinks.

==Stay safe==

While not as strict as Riyadh, Jeddah still falls under Islamic law. Jeddah is the most modern city in Saudi Arabia. Murder, rape, drug dealing are crimes punishable by death. Anyone caught with Any illegal drugs/alcohol will be prosecuted. Make sure not to eat outside during the month of ramadan (the fasting month of muslims). People fast from Sunrise still sunset. Don't approach random women as this is highly discouraged due to the Islmaic tradition, even you want to ask something and need any kind of advice.

==Contact==
Most shopping malls have Internet cafes. Coffee places such as Costa Coffee, Starbucks Coffee, Barnies, Second Cup and many more provide WiFi access to customers.
