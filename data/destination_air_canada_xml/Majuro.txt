'''Majuro''' is the largest city in and capital of the [[Marshall Islands]]. The downtown area is located north of the airport on the eastern side of the main island. It consists of the smaller towns Delap, Uliga and Darrit which are located on islands linked by small stretches of land.

==Understand==

==Get in==

A boat dock is on the atoll side of Uliga.

===By plane===

'''Amata Kabua International Airport''' ({{IATA|MAJ}}) ({{ICAO|PKMJ}}) is on the south side of the Majuro atoll.
United Airlines has thrice-weekly service from [[Honolulu]] as part of its "island hopper" route which also serves the [[Federated States of Micronesia]] and [[Guam]]. Non-stop flights from [[Guam]] are available on the remaining weekdays. If time permits the island hopper flight stopping at various atolls on the way to/from [[Guam]] makes for a scenic way to the destination.

Hotel transfers are usually available for free upon reservation. Taxis are cheap as well (around US$1) and it is a customary process to pick up more passengers on the way.

There is only one principal road in Majuro. If you are on a walk far away from the city center, police and other people will often give you a ride if they are going in the same direction.

==Get around==

Much of the island can be explored by foot with the main exception to this being a trip to '''Laura Beach'''. Taxis are cheap ($0.75) as long you stay east of the airport. To further reduce costs, cab sharing is common and to be expected. The taxi is like a shared taxi that will let people on and off anywhere on the main road. Do not hesitate to hail a cab even if you see there are already passengers inside. Getting to '''Laura Beach''' by taxi is expensive, but buses make the round trip to Laura 6 days a week (not on Sundays) for $2, departing from the RRE parking lot. Hitchhiking is widely practiced and quite safe.

There are packs of feral dogs roaming all inhabited parts of Majuro. Anyone walking or running needs to be ever alert as these dogs frequently attack without provocation. Walkers and runners should always carry a stout rod or similar, and several rocks for use in thwarting marauding dogs.

Rental cars run at somewhat fixed rate of $US 60 per day. None of the huge commercial rental agencies operate on the island. Hotel Robert Reimers has about a dozen cars available. A gas station is located south of Hotel Robert Reimers about two thirds of the way to the National Telecommunications Authority building (easily identifiable by the big satellite dishes).

The Majuro atoll itself has a few things to offer and is a good base for exploration of the surrounding islands.

The main tourist attraction is '''Laura Beach''' on the western tip of the main island about 40km away from town. As taxis to '''Laura Beach''' are quite expensive the added value of a rental car should not be neglected.

'''Eneko Island''' is a small atoll about 45 minutes away from Uliga by boat. Day trips and overnight stays at their small cottages need to be arranged through the Hotel Robert Reimers. On the island, known to locals as "Picnic Island", are grills for preparing meals, but there are no places with food and beverage service - it's important for visitors to bring their own. Reimers offers sea kayaks for paddling around the shoreline, and there's a small pontoon deck about 50 meters offshore, a good place to swim, jump in the water or sunbathe. The beaches are full of coral and seashells, which is great for beachcombers. Many of the seashells are inhabited and actually walking about on the beach. A round-trip excursion with a stay of several hours is $30 and is offered multiple times a day, depending on demand. Check at Reimers Hotel in the city to book and to learn when the departures will be. 

The '''Marshall Islands Resort''' offers a day trip to a private island or $60 per person, plus an admission fee at the island of $25 per group. They will also organize fishing expeditions and tours. 

The '''Alele Museum and archives''' is small but worth a short visit. There is one main passageway with photos focusing on the history of Majuro Atoll and two exhibition rooms. The number of artifacts is limited, but photos tell the history and culture of the island chain. One interesting exhibit focuses on the navigation techniques of the ancient Polynesian seafarers, including instruments they devised to learn and remember where the various tiny islands are in the vast sea. The museum is located in the center of town a short walk from the Reimers Hotel.

*'''Majuro Peace Park''' is a memorial park dedicated to World War II.

The '''Convention Center''' is mostly a place for meetings, but does have a few exhibits and photos on Marshall Islands life. It's worth a quick visit, even if just to get into something air conditioned on a hot day.

*'''Airport Beach Park'''. Place similar to famous Maho beach, ideal for plane spotting.

==Internet==

Internet access in Majuro is relatively good. The options include buying a Wi-Fi card and taking your laptop or smartphone to a National Telecommunications Authority (NTA) hot spot or by going to NTA in Delap and signing up for Wi-Fi (smartphones $15 a month, laptops $35 a month). NTA also has an internet cafe.

Asia's Beauty Salon and Boutique offers free Wi-Fi to customers if you get a haircut, pedicure, or manicure here. Romely is a very friendly hair salonist. +692 455 0669. She offers free massages and a shampoo with a haircut.


The small '''Formosa Supermarket''' has groceries and basic supplies but closes early. A bigger '''Payless''' supermarket is located off the main road in the southeast corner of the main atoll. A place with an intriguing name is simply called "'''Tourist Trap'''" and has the usual tourist items and some practical gear as well.

==Eat==

The Tidetable Restaurant attached to the Hotel Robert Reimers is a meeting place for locals as well as expats looking for cheap quality food and Internet access. The restaurant overlooks a busy town square as well as the lagoon. Try the MEC Blackout - seasoned slices of tuna which just touched a hot pan for a few seconds. Self catering is available with several groceries and shops around the central parts of the town.

==Drink==
For nice places full of foreigners, check out the bars at RRE/Tide Table or at Marshall Islands Resort.

Marshall Islands Club is a local favorite. Spacious, with an open air deck situated right on the lagoon.

The Flame Tree is a very popular bar/club combination.

The Pub, Awa Zero, and Lanai (recently shut down) are the late-night dance clubs. They generally don't get going until well after midnight.

There's a wide choice of accommodation in Majuro.

==Stay safe==
Majuro Atoll is considered safe. People are friendly and the crime rate is low. Be aware of mosquitos if they tend to find you attractive.

==Get out==

'''Marshall Islands Resort''' sometimes offers live music, especially on weekends. A modest cover fee is charged. If you wish a full meal with the music, order in the restaurant off the menu, then pay your admission to the ocean-side bar area where the performance is held. Food will be delivered to you when ready. You can also simply pay the admission and order anything you like from the bar.
