'''Salzburg,''' [http://www.salzburg.info/en] birthplace of Mozart, is a city in central [[Austria]], near the German (Bavarian) border with a population of some 150,000 in 2013. If you have seen the movie ''The Sound of Music'' [http://www.sound-of-music.com], you may think you know all there is to see in Salzburg. Admittedly, it is difficult not to spontaneously burst into song when you're walking along the Salzach River, or climbing up to the Hohensalzburg fortress which looms over the city. But there is a lot more to this compact, courtly city than Julie Andrews. 

==Understand==
[[File:Old Town Salzburg across the Salzach river.jpg|thumb|Old Town Salzburg across the Salzach river]]
Salzburg is the fourth-largest city in Austria (after Vienna, Graz and Linz) and the capital of the federal [[Salzburg_(state)|state of Salzburg]]. Its "Old Town", with its world famous baroque architecture, is one of the best-preserved city centers in the German-speaking world and was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997.

===Origins of name===

The name Salzburg literally means "Salt Fortress", and derives its name from the barges carrying salt on the Salzach river, which were subject to a toll in the 8th century.

===Early history and medieval period===

Traces of human settlements dating to the Neolithic Age, and later a Celtic camp, have been found in the area. Starting from 15 BC, the small communities were grouped into a single town which was named by the Romans as Juvavum. Little remains of the city from this period.

The Festung Hohensalzburg, the city's fortress, was built in 1077 and expanded in the following centuries. Independence from [[Bavaria]] was secured in the late 14th century.

===Independent state===

Salzburg was the capital of an independent state from the early 14th century until 1805. It was ruled by prince-archbishops, who became rich from the salt mines located in the south of the city. This led to the architectural gem you see today as not only materials, but also architects, were imported from Italy and other European countries. This is also the reason why, compared to other Austrian cities, sacred monuments outnumber the few secular buildings. This is how Salzburg got its nickname as "the Rome of the north". Everywhere you go in this city, you see and read about the legacy of the Archbishops.

==Get in==

===By car===

Salzburg is well connected to both Vienna (Wien) and Munich (München), Germany via the autobahns A8 (Munich – Salzburg) and A1 (Salzburg – Vienna). There is an [[Austria#By_car|Austrian Motorway "Vignette"]] you have to purchase. The price varies, depending on whether you buy a yearly or 10 day vignette.

Driving around Salzburg can be a pain. The road names are small and written in a traditional German font which can be hard to read. The best bet is to get into the city, find a parking space, and travel by foot. If you are driving in cold weather, be prepared for snow, and snow chains are recommended in extreme weather. From October to April, the law requires all cars to have snow tires (''Winterreifen'').
 
===By train===

Salzburg's railway station, the ''Hauptbahnhof'' (Hbf.), is located to the north of the Salzach River within the New Town of Salzburg. The train ride from Munich to Salzburg takes about an hour and a half (Regional trains take about 2 hours), and international trains operate from Zurich, Zagreb, Ljubljana and Budapest to name just a few destinations. Fast Inter-city trains operate very frequently, especially to Linz and Vienna, with up to three connections every hour operated by ÖBB and WestBahn.
The station was completely renovated between 2009 and 2014 and now has a modern look. The Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB) and German Federal Railways (DB) have ticket offices. Tickets for ÖBB, DB and WestBahn trains are also sold at machines. The popular ''Bayern Ticket'' train pass for Bavaria sold by DB also covers train rides between Bavaria to Salzburg Hbf., but it is only valid for Regional trains (code RE and RB). The rail pass can be bought from DB ticket offices as well as DB Ticket Selling Machines in the station.

* <see name = "Salzburg W.A. Mozart International Airport" address = "Innsbrucker Bundesstraße 95" directions = "" phone = "+43 662 8580 7911" email= "" fax = "" url = "http://www.salzburg-airport.com/" hours = "" price="">The Salzburg W.A. Mozart International Airport ({{IATA|SZG}}) is situated about 20 minutes from the center of the city. Connection with the city is provided by a trolley bus [http://www.salzburg-airport.com/en/passengers-visitors/arrival-parking/bus-train-taxi/public-bus-service/]. The trip from the airport to the train station is approx. 20 minutes and costs €2.50 for an adult. The airport has direct connections from Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Brussels, Dublin, Birmingham, Exeter, London, [[Istanbul]], Palma de Mallorca, Paris, [[Saint Petersburg]], Moscow, Vienna, all big German cities, and Zurich. For more connections you may prefer flying to Munich or Vienna and taking the train to Salzburg.</see>

==Get around==
[[File:Salzburg Roofs and Domes.jpg|thumb|Salzburg Roofs and Domes]]

The best way to get around Salzburg is on foot. There is a network of city buses, the '''StadtBus''', with numbers from 1 to 8 (trolleybuses) and 20-27 (diesel buses). A single trip ticket on the bus is €2.60, a single short trip ticket €1.30 (maximum 3 stops), a 24 h ticket €5.70 (from 1st Jul 2016) which covers the whole city. If you travel by bus, make sure you catch none of the last buses. They will take you several miles out of town with your only way back being on foot or by taxi. If you need to get somewhere late at night, it may be best to take a taxi.

Conveniently, bus tickets can be bought on the buses from the bus driver. However, if you have time, buy the tickets in advance at a "Trafik", since they are then significantly cheaper. But you have to buy the tickets in blocks of 5, 5-single-ticket package costs €9 (means €1.8 each), 5-short-trip-ticket package costs €4.5 (means €0.9 each) and Day Ticket Single tickets is €3.7. Single tickets and 24-h Day ticket are also available from automatic machines at central bus stops.

The "Lokalbahn" train has a separate station under the main railway station and travels in the direction of Oberndorf and Lamprechtshausen. Tickets can be bought on the train.

Another option for exploring areas around the main city (Bad Ischl, Fuschlsee, etc.) are the '''Postbuses'''. These also leave from the main railway station; tickets can be bought from the driver. Also you can [https://www.carngo.com/car-rental/austria-salzburg rent a car] from €35 and drive in the surrounding of the city.

Finally, another excellent option is renting a bike, or a [http://www.rennradverleih.com Road Bike]. Salzburg has over 100 km of bike paths, and using this mode of transportation is often faster than bus, car or foot. There are also excellent bike paths on either side of the river, which you can follow to either Freilassing (35 min), Oberndorf or Hallein (each about an hour away).

Having arrived at the airport (Flughafen Salzburg) it is very easy to make your way into the town centre by trolleybus or other modes of transport. Tickets for these services can be bought easily from the bus driver and you can travel from here to the "Hauptbahnhof" main station where you can reach many destinations, predominantly in Austria, but also across the whole of Europe.

A variety of paths lead to the top, but most people use the cable car that lifts passengers over 1300m to the Geiereck peak. The cable car runs from the 'St Leonhard' station in the town of Gartenau to the station at the Geiereck peak.

It will bring you to the ticket building, which gives you a ticket for the lift to the top and a tour of the caves.  Bring good shoes because there is an additional 20 minute walk up the mountain, and bring something warm because the caves are below freezing and the tour lasts 30 minutes.  Check the website for ticket prices and times.  

*'''Salt Mines''' &mdash; There are a few different salt mine tours available in Salzburg's immediate surroundings. A good one is  Salzwelten Salzburg [http://www.salzwelten.at/cont/salzwelten/en_salzwelten_salzburg.aspx] in Bad Dürrnberg. Getting there is easy with the ''Salz Erlebnis Ticket'', available at the train station; it covers the local train and a bus transfer (round-trip), admission, and the (required) Salzwelten tour. The 90-minute tour is great for families, although children under 4 are not allowed on the tour. Put on white coveralls, ride a trolley into the mine, and use wooden slides to descend into the lower levels. A café and picnic benches are available on-site, as well as a small reconstructed Celtic village that includes a playground. Allow about 2 1/2 hours for the tour and the Celtic Village. Open 9AM-5PM Apr-Oct; 10AM-3PM Nov-Dec. Adults €21; Children €10.00. Family and Group tickets are available.

It was founded by Hugo von Hoffmansthal, Max Reinhardt and Richard Strauss in 1920. It takes place in July and August, the most famous piece is the "Jedermann" ("''Everyman''") by Hugo v. Hoffmansthal, being conducted in front of the Dom (Cathedral) every year.

More recently, festivals also take place during Easter time (with mostly Baroque music), and in autumn.

==Buy==

*'''Mozartkugeln''' (''Mozart balls'') are chocolate-covered marzipan candy balls inspired by the famous composer, Salzburg's most famous son, Mozart. Try the original version at '''Café Fürst'''; be aware, though, they are rather expensive, with a small box costing as much as €7. The more widespread Mirabell brand is sold in many tourist shops, but they are also available at most local grocery stores for a lot less. The Reber brand sits between Fürst and Mirabell in terms of quality, it is however made in Germany and thus not authentic; its price is in line with Mirabell's. There's a Reber chocolate shop in the Altermarkt with a wide range of chocolates, Kugeln and pastettes.
* The annual '''Christmas Market''' (''Christkindlmarkt''), located at the three squares around the dome (''Domplatz, Kapitelplatz, Residenzplatz'') features traditional fast food, such as hot potatoes, doughnuts with kraut, and candies, as well as christmas decorations, winter clothes, and craftmanship. It opens end of November and closes on Christmas.

==Stay Safe==
Salzburg is the most dangerous city in Austria – but literally all of these crimes are just pickpocketing cases. The most crime occurs at the train station. Violent crimes such as murder and armed robbery is incredibly rare. 
Tourists are targeted the most, so make sure that you keep your wallet/purse safe. 
So far, no terrorist attacks have happened in Salzburg at all – however, the risk of one happening is increasing. Multiple attack plans have been foiled by the police. Make sure to keep a watchful eye for anything suspicious – if you feel unsafe, just leave as soon as possible.

Salzburg has a growing number of options available for email and Internet access:

*'''Internet Cafe at the YOHO Hostel''', Paracelsusstrasse 9, Happy Hour € 0,10 per hour is from 6PM – 9PM.

* '''Starbucks''', opposite Mozart's birthhouse on Getreidegasse.  Has plenty of power sockets and wifi
* '''McCafe''', also on Getreidegasse.  Has power sockets and better seating upstairs though the wifi is slow and it can be pretty noisy.

==Get out==
* '''[[Hallein]]''' (22 000 inhabitants) with the [[:wikipedia:Hallein Salt Mine|Hallein Salt Mine]]  also known as ''Salzbergwerk Dürrnberg''.
* If you get tired of the city you can visit the '''ice caves''' [http://www.eisriesenwelt.at/] south of Salzburg, or the '''salt mines''' [http://www.salzwelten.at/en/hallein/saltmine/] in the nearby city of Hallein. 
* [[Oberndorf bei Salzburg]], a small city next to Salzburg where '''Silent Night, Holy Night''', the famous Christmas song, was composed and premiered. You can see the Silent Night Chapel [http://www.stillenacht.info] there.
* For people who prefer '''nature''' to sights, hiking on the '''Untersberg''' [http://www.untersberg.net/english.htm], a trip to  '''Salzkammergut''' or the '''Königssee''' [http://www.koenigssee.com/], a visit to '''Bad Ischl''' [http://www.badischl.com/] may be interesting.
*The town of '''Golling''' is a small quaint farm town that is a 35 minute train ride to the south. It features a nice waterfall (closed in the winter, but there's nothing to stop you from going unless the path is icy), scenic gorges, small alpine lakes and mountain views in the Bluntautal Valley, along with several other attractions.
* Freilassing is a small German town just across the border, 10-15 minutes by train. Some locals prefer to shop here as goods are slightly cheaper than in Austria.
* Salzburg is about 2 hours from [[Munich]] and [[Passau]], 3 hours from [[Vienna]], and is only a stone's throw from the [[Alps]].
