'''Bissau''' is the largest city in and capital of [[Guinea-Bissau]].

==Get in==
===By plane===
There are direct flights Lisbon-Bissau with TAP [http://www.flytap.com/]. Senegal Airlines also flies from Dakar [http://www.senegalairlines.aero/].

TACV [http://www.flytacv.com/] have four flights each week from Dakar to Bissau, returning to Dakar the same day. These flights are not an example of punctuality and it is a good idea to check with the TACV office in Bissau (Av. Amilcar Cabral 8B, tel. 206087) before you head to the airport.

===By shared taxi===
A sept-place (7-seat shared taxi) from Ziguinchor, Senegal costs CFA$4,000.  Additional CFA$1,000 for a normal sized bag.  The trip takes 2.5 to 3 hours depending on border formalities..

==Get around==

Shared taxis are cheap and plentiful during the day (less so on sundays and at late hours in the night). Stop taxis and tell them where you want to go (or tell the passing taxis by pointing), and they will either accept "nô bai" (We're going), or decline "não" (no) if people, already in the taxi, are going to another part of the city. Prices are more or less fixed, and you'll normally not get cheated, except when you're an obvious foreigner and taking a taxi from the airport or Hotel. 

The mininum rate is 250 FCFA, which will get you around the city center up until the Chapa roundabout, or a similar distance (a 5min ride). The further the distance the more you pay (300, 350, 400, 500 FCFA...). You shouldn't pay more than 1000FCFA to move around the city, unless you enter dirt roads. Luggage is charged separately.
 
Group travel is cheaper, if you're 2 ou more the taxi driver should do a small discount (100 FCFA less).

To get from the city center to the airport entrance you should not pay more than 1000 FCFA (you can pay between 500 FCFA and 750 FCFA depending on your familiarity). To get from the airport to the city center there's a fixed rate of 5000 FCFA and the taxi won't take any other passangers.

There are also minibuses "toka-toka"s going on fixed routes, you'll pay 100 FCFA a person for the ride, but the buses are often very crowded!

*'''The presidential palace''' - bombed-out during the civil war, but then remodeled.

*'''Bissau Velho''' - the old Portuguese colonial centre. Some, not much, life there nowadays, but still a nice place to walk around. Don't miss the prison converted into Casa dos Direitos (Human Rights House) (At the corner of the fort, close to the harbour). The Metro Lavapiés is a nice bar in the area, opened with live music on Fridays and Saturdays.

*'''Porto Pidjiguiti''' - walk out the little port and talk to the fishermen, watch the pelicans and see the city from a distance. The Pidjiguiti port was the site of the Pidjiguiti massacre on 3rd of august 1959, where police shot down some 50 striking dockworkers. This became the beginning of the active resistance against the Portuguese colonial power. There is a monument shaped as a gigantic black fist commemorating the massacre.

*'''Artisan Market''' - Known as "Coqueiros", near the Heróis Nacionais Square (city center).

*'''Museu Etnográfico Nacional''' (National Ethnographic Museum), on the university campus, opposite "Lenox de Bairro". Open mornings only, it has a small collection of Bissau-Guinean wooden masks and statues, baskets, cloths etc. The staff is very helpful and good at explaining the purpose of the different items, and connecting it to traditional spiritual beliefs.

Guinea Bissaus main hospital is '''Hospital Nacional Simão Mendes''' ... But if you really need to go to the hospital, probably you should try and get your insurance company to pay for you at least going to Dakar. 

Pharmacies are on every street corner in Bissau, pharmacies '''Rama''' (there are three), '''Rina''' and '''Amilcar Cabral''' are usually well-stocked and the indian owners speak english.

==Get out==
'''Ilheu do Rei''' - a nice get-away for a picnic if you're in Bissau on a longer term. Go to Porto Canoa (behind Mavegro and the cemetery) and ask around for a canoa to take you to the island, it takes about 10 minutes and you should not pay much for the return ticket (1000 FCFA?). Once there, check out the abandoned peanut oil factory, and continue through the little village down to a little "beach" (ask people where it is), from where you can turn left and walk along the coast, if you don't mind climbing a little over trees and rocks. For once there is no mangrove, so you can actually get the feeling of strolling along the coast.

'''Volta de Bissau''' Starting at the Porto Canoa, this track goes around Bissau, passing rice fields and small suburbs, the big cemetery in Antula, São Paulo etc, and eventually you'll end up at the airport road close to Hotel Bissau Palace. A nice sunday walk, some 4 hours, not all stretches are suitable for vehicles.

'''Hotel Marazul''' [http://www.marazulpeche.com], in Quinhamel. Makes a fine daytrip for swimming and lunch, and maybe a fishing trip. In the town of Quinhamel there's also an interesting weavery,  "Artissal" [http://www.artissal.org/], producing handwoven textiles.

'''Hotel Rural de Uaque''' [http://www.hotelruraldeuaque.com/] is also recommendable, if you need to escape from Bissau for a day, swim and relax.

'''Praia Suro''' in Prabis is the Guineans favorite weekend get-away in the dry season. The beach is a bit muddy, but there's always good ambient with music, people dancing, barbecuing, playing football and swimming. Just follow Estrada de Bor out of Bissau, continue when it turns into a dirt road, and eventually you'll reach the beach (might be a two-hour drive).

'''Saltinho Waterfall''' - A pleasant little waterfall located just under the bridge where the main road to southern Guinea-Bissau crosses the Rio Corubal. There is a hotel "Pousada do Saltinho" overlooking the waterfalls, with decent rooms (FCFA 20.000) and meals. Many Portuguese hunters and fishermen stay there. About three hours drive from Bissau.
