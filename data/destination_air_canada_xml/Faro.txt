'''Faro''' is a city in the [[Algarve]] region of [[Portugal]]. 

==Understand==

A popular destination for sun-seekers from northern Europe, Faro has a reputation as being an overrun party beach town for much of the year. Visitors who use it as a base to explore the more remote areas of the Algarve in the off-season will experience much more of what southern Portugal has to offer; but those looking for no more than a tan and cocktails won't be disappointed. In winter, it is a beautiful, peaceful corner of Southern Europe with plenty of sun bleaching the white-washed town with Iberian and Moorish-influenced architecture. The people are more friendly than other parts of Europe. Many speak a bit of English, but are very appreciative of any attempts at Portuguese.

==Get in==

===By plane===
*'''Faro Airport''' ({{IATA|FAO}}) ({{ICAO|LPFR}}),  [http://www.faro-airport.org]. Many package tour and discount airlines arrive from the UK and Ireland, mainland Europe and Canada. There is a large group of Car hire agencies if you turn right after the main exit.

=== By train ===

The ''Alpha Pendular'',  a high-speed train, runs at least twice a day to and from [[Lisbon]]. About 3 hours, €22.20 one way, €29,80 on first class (there is discount for persons under 26yo) The Inter City trains run more frequently but take a little longer, with more stops - about 3h30 . There are also regional trains along the Algarve coast to [[Lagos (Portugal)|Lagos]].

=== By airport transfers ===

There at more than 50 Faro airport transfers companies that operate directly at this airport. You can search for "Faro Airport Private Taxis Transfers" and choose the company that best suits your needs.
For cheap taxis from Faro airport you can choose airport transfers. You can also use one of the e-hailing apps for different price and type of car like Talixo.

===By car===

Car hire is an option for visitors. You can arrange car hire at the airport, however, as with many tourist locations it is wise to arrange your vehicle hire prior to arrival - this can save both money (the airport car rental desks can be far more expensive) and disappointment as availability during peak season may be very limited.   Organising it from home before you arrive is now a very simple process with numerous companies specialising in pre-booking car hire in Faro. With fares under €10 a day renting a car is never expensive in Faro [http://www.holidaycars.com/car-rental/portugal/faro/]

Roads can be quite busy, but if you want to see a bit more of the city and indeed the Algarve region then driving by car is an easy option. Driving in the Algarve region is far easier than in the rest of Portugal, there are more non-toll roads and road-signs are plentiful and relevant.

===By bus===

There is a daily bus service from [[Lisbon]] and [[Porto]] in the north of Portugal, as well as from [[Madrid]] and [[Seville]] in [[Spain]]. A fare from Lisbon to Faro costs either 18 EUR (for a "Expresso" connection takes about 4 hours, stopping in [[Albufeira]], [[Vilamoura]] and [[Quarteira]]) or 19 EUR (for a "Expresso Qualidade" direct connection which takes just over 3 hours and includes a movie projection, a stewardess, and a mini-bar service) and can easily be bought at the bus station just before boarding. This bus station in Lisbon is next to a subway stop called Jardim Zoológico.

===By boat===
Main harbours: Portimao, Faro.

==Get around==
===By bus===
Buses 16 and 14 go around the city and the airport of Faro. Tickets can be bought from the driver.

===By car===
It can be difficult to find a parking slot in the center. Most of the parking stations near the restaurants and shopping malls are payable. However, there is a huge free parking station next to the ship yard from which tour boats depart.

====Hiring a car====
Many of the cheaper rental firms hit customers with expensive fuel charges at the desk, even if you book online. Search for cars with a "fair fuel" or "full to full" policy to make sure that you only pay for what you use. Excess insurance is also much cheaper online and easy to find. Sometimes sales people at the desk will tell you that your policy is invalid or does not cover you - even though the level of cover from online policies is almost always greater (excess waivers from the rental firms do not always cover damage to the wheels, underbody and tires). However, always check the policy documents to make sure you are clear on what is covered and if you are still unsure ask the insurer.

===On foot===

Walking in the center is enjoyable and distances between highlights aren't too large.

==See==
* Fans of automotive engineering will be intrugued by some of the weird and wonderful vehicles on Faro's streets.  These include pick-up trucks with motorcycle front-ends, and various mopeds and micro-cars that never made it across the Channel.  Renault 4s, now almost extinct in their native France, are still a common sight in Faro.

* If you're in a macabre mood then check out the Capela dos Ossos in the Igreja do Carmo church.  This is a chapel decorated with the skeletal remains of over 1,200 former monks.  There is a small admission charge.

==Do==

* '''Centro Historico''' - The Old City, or ''Cidade Velha'', is a well-preserved section of town off the harbor with cobblestone streets and 18th century Portuguese and Moorish-influenced architecture. It is great place for a peaceful and almost private walk back in time in an area that has been virtually untouched  by modernity.

* '''[[Ria Formosa]]''' - Take a boat trip into the Ria Formosa - a nature reserve that stretches along the tip of Portugal into Spain. There are several options to explore the area and the boat leaves from the Marina (Doca do Recreio de Faro). '''☎ +351 918 720 002 or +351 914 539 511'''.

* '''Praia de Faro''' - This beach is several kilometers long and so should never get crowded, even in the height of summer.  Most of the beach is gently sloping though it can take a sudden dip in places.  There are the usual beach-side stalls and a public lavatory, but no showers. Praia de Faro is just past the airport, the airport bus stops there and costs €2.25 (in 2017).  A lot of people with early check-outs and late flights seem to go there on their last day.
*<do name="Faro Jewish Heritage Centre" alt="" address="Rua Leao Penedo" directions="In fron of Faro Hospital" phone="289829525" url="http://www.farojewishheritagecentre.org" hours="9.30-12.30 and 14.00-17.00" price="free" lat="" long="">Oficially established in 1851, the Faro Jewish Cemetery is the only remaining vestige of the first post-Inquisition Jewish presence in Portugal. It served as a burial place for a thriving 60 family community (also known as "Little Jerusalem"). The Jews of Portugal fled the Inquisition from the end of the XVth century and settled in Gibraltar and North Africa. After the devastating 1755 Lisbon Earthquake their descendants have been invited by the Marquis of Pombal to help rebuild the economy. Although the community is long gone, the Cemetery still remains to remind citizens and travellers of its former glory. The Faro Jewish Heritage Centre features over one hundred graves in Sephardi style, with beautifully engraved slabs instead of headstones. Although the land has been purchased by the Jewish community in 1851, the first burial, that of Rabbi Toledano, dates back to 1838. Apart from the Cemetery, there is also a museum, housing many objects linked to the history of the Jews of Faro, like the furniture from one of the two non-existent synagogues of Faro or the facsimile copy of Gacon's 1487 Pentateuch in Hebrew - the first book ever printed in Portugal!</do>

===Events===
*'''MOMI International Physical Theater Festival''' occurs in the end of May. There're mime, pantomime, dance and theater performances as well as circus one. Moreover the festival offers different workshops . [https://www.colectivojat.com/momi.html]. 
*'''Monsta''' is an Afro, hip hop and funk music festival in September.
