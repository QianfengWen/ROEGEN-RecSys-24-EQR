'''Yanji''' (Chinese: 延吉, Korean: 옌지) is a city in [[Jilin]] Province.

==Understand==
Koreans first migrated to the Yanji area after a series of famines struck in 1869. The area, called the Yanbian Chaoxianzu (Korean) Autonomous Prefecture, is the home of the largest group of ethnic Koreans living outside of Korea, and while there are a small number of expatriates from North and South Korea, most of the Koreans living here hold Chinese, not Korean citizenship. While some ethnic minorities such as the Manchus have since been assimilated by the Han, and others such as the Uyghurs and Tibetans continue to fight against the Chinese government in separatist movements, the Koreans have a unique place among China's ethnic minorities as despite being fiercely protective of their culture and language, they generally do not harbour any separatist intentions. Since large areas of Yanbian were off-limits to travelers, the tourist facilities and people who speak English are kind of non-existent at the moment but that is changing.

Unlike other Chinese cities, this little city is relatively clean and peaceful. You can find quite many cafes for this little city where serves good coffees and also you will see many tea houses (茶坐) around the city.

==Sleep==
Like many other Chinese cities, foreigners are only allowed to stay in the places that meet 'the standard', even if there are plenty of cheap inns. It means you have to pay above 100 per person in high season(in low season, it would be around 80). If it says inn (Luguan, 旅馆), you foreigners are not likely allowed to stay. If it says hotel or motel (宾馆, binguan) you might be able to stay there, but it's more expensive than those small inns. (normal inns are 20~50 yuan for a room) However there's one option below 100 yuan for foreigners.

* <sleep name="Shi Shang Motel(binguan) 时尚宾馆" address="30 meters South from Lihua elementary school(梨花小学校, Lihua Xiaoxuexiao), at the south end of Yuanhong Hutong （园虹胡同）On 2F" phone="(0433)832-5111" fax=""></sleep>This little but clean motel is the best deal for a budget (foreign) traveler. A double room with a computer(internet available) and an inside toilet/hot shower with no window starts at 50 yuan even in high season. The cleanest sheets and towels than other more expensive hotels. The city center is in walking distance and the creek next to it provides a good walk path. The amusement park on riverside and the nightclub Star Box is also in walking distance. If you planned to take a taxi, don't say the road name but say Lihua Xiaoxuexiao (elementary school) since it's more famous than the names of little allies.

* <sleep name="Cha Er Si Hotel 查尔斯宾馆" address="At the intersection of Changbai Road and Zhanqian Road , three blocks north of the train station and three blocks west from the bus station. Look out for a large, black neon sign saying karaoke and hotel." phone="" fax=""> The reception on the first floor is for a different hotel, instead take the elevator to the 3rd floor for the correct one. Cheapest room is 139 yuan and some come without window. You can get about 15 yuan discounts when you planned to stay more than 3 days(need to make a membership card). Rooms are equipped with computer, a TV and with a bathroom inside. Water pressure is poor. Karaoke Bar is in the same building, so it can be a bit noisy around 11pm to 1am. Close to the train station as well as one of the bus stations, but not a good location if you want to hang around in the city center. The airport is a short taxi ride away that shouldn't cost more than 10-20RMB. </sleep>
