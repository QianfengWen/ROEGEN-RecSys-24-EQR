'''Turin'''[https://www.turismotorino.org/en/] (Italian: ''Torino''; Piedmontese: ''Turin''), a large city of about one million inhabitants, is the capital of [[Piedmont]], a region of northwestern [[Italy]], a one-hour drive from the French border and slightly more than that from the Mediterranean sea. It's famous for being the home of the Sabaudian former royal family. Today, Turin, with its fine, aristocratic atmosphere, old-world sophisticated shops, grand boulevards and palaces, leafy parks, and several art galleries, is an increasingly popular tourist resort. The 2006 Winter Olympics and its status recently as World Book Capital have promoted tourists to visit this beautiful and underestimated Italian city, which has a longstanding cultural and artistic history.

Turin was the first capital of modern Italy and was the host of the 2006 Winter Olympic Games. While it's not a famous tourist destination like [[Florence]] or [[Rome]], the setting is pleasant, with the Po River flowing through the city, the genteel hills overlooking the city and scattered with pleasant villas and surrounded by the Italian Alps off in the distance. This is why the famous architect Le Corbusier defined Turin as "the city with the most beautiful natural location in the world".

Turin is an important hub of technology and industry. The FIAT automobile company is based here: The 'T' in the name stands for Torino (F I A T = Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino, which translates as Italian Automobile Factory Turin). It was also the birthplace of several cultural and political movements in Italy.   

Turin inhabitants are well known across Italy for their understatement and composure and the city reflects this attitude.

Many people consider Turin the European capital of Baroque: many palaces and churches were built in this style by the kingdom of the Savoy. It isn't a typical Italian city, with red and yellow buildings: is a bit more French, so much so that is also called "the little Paris"; wide boulevards with white buildings make the city center more similar to Paris. Around the city, a crown of churches and castles, some up on a hilltop, some lost in a park, provide plenty of interesting views. Turin also has an aristocratic atmosphere - the center is filled with posh 19th-century cafes, regal-like arcaded mansions, debonair glittering restaurants, and grand churches.

Turin is home to the famous '''Shroud of Turin'''.  More recently, it has become the home of the '''Slow Food Movement'''.

===Climate===
Turin has a humid subtropical climate (not Mediterranean like most of Italy). Turin also sits in the coldest part of the Po Valley with chillier winters and cooler summers than cities like [[Milan]] and [[Bologna]]. 

Lows during the winter are almost always below freezing and the average low is -2.5°C (27.5°F). Daytime highs are around 5°C (42°F). Temperatures can occasionally get as low as -10°C (12°F) when cold waves hit northern Italy but long cold periods are uncommon. The record low is -21°C (-6°F). Snow does fall around 9-10 days every year and can cause some minor problems if it's heavy. On the other hand when southerly winds blow they can raise temperatures above 15°C (60°F). Air pollution is not as severe as Milan's but it can happen in Turin and especially in the winter. 

Summers are pleasantly warm but with very high humidity. Even when the average daytime temperature is 28°C (82°F) the humidity can make the atmosphere really uncomfortable sometimes. Heat waves don't usually affect the area and the record high is only 37°C (98°F). Keep in mind that sometimes nighttime lows can get below 15°C (59°F) so jackets shouldn't be left out of the question if you're traveling in the area even in the middle of July. 

Spring and fall account for more than 60% of the yearly precipitation. Both seasons are good to visit but nights are still cold even in April and snow can fall as early as November.

==Get in==

===By plane===

Turin's international airport is located 15km north of the city center and is named after Italy's former President Sandro Pertini. It is in the town of Caselle, connected to Turin city by a convenient motorway.

The main carriers to reach Torino from abroad are Lufthansa, Air France, Turkish Airlines, and Alitalia if flying from Rome or Naples [http://www.alitalia.com/], Italy's flagship airline, which operates flights from some European and Italian cities. Caselle is also a destination for some low fares airlines, such as Ryanair, Volotea, and Easyjet. The airport is connected to the city by train, local bus (with a regional bus service, which is long), SADEM direct bus, and taxi.  

The Arriva SADEM bus service runs every 15 minutes (30 on Saturdays, Sundays, and bank holidays) from the airport to Torino Porta Nuova train station. Buy a ticket at a ticket kiosk inside the airport terminal or you can buy it on the bus. If you buy the Turin + Piemonte Card, the ride is only 5 euros. The journey from the airport to the station takes approximately 40 minutes. The bus schedule can be found here: [http://www.sadem.it/media/6355/000268.pdf]

The city’s public transportation company also operates a second SFMA bus service from northern Turin to the airport which costs €3.00 euros, and runs between every 20 minutes and once an hour depending on the time and weekday. Schedule here: [http://www.gtt.to.it/cms/risorse/ferrovie/oraripdf/FTC.pdf].

Turin can be also reached from Malpensa airport[https://www.milanomalpensa-airport.com/it/], which may be cheaper to fly to. There is a bus service running ten times daily between the city and the airport. The ride lasts 2 hours. Flixbus also provides several connections a day, at fluctuating prices. 

===By train===

Turin has three main railway stations, '''Porta Nuova''', '''Porta Susa''' and '''Lingotto FS'''. 

Generally speaking, Porta Nuova and Porta Susa are stations dedicated to mid-range and long-range trains. The brand new stunning Porta Susa station serves trains to all northern regions of Italy ([[Milan]], [[Venice]], [[Aosta]]), and [[Paris]], while Porta Nuova serves especially trains to the south ([[Genoa]], [[Florence]], [[Rome]], [[Bologna]]). You'd better check in advance where you need to go. Many trains also stop at both stations. All trains coming from/going to the south of Turin, depart from Porta Nuova via Lingotto FS. All stations are managed by Trenitalia [http://www.trenitalia.com], the Italian state railways.

Porta Nuova has a luggage storage service called Ki Point at the beginning of platform 1. You'll need to show a photo ID when leaving the luggage and pay upon collection. The closure is at 10pm. You can find more similar services within walking distance, like the completely automated Stow Your Bags (prices by the hour and the size of the locker).

===By bus===
There are many buses from [[Milan]], Milan airports, [[Lyon]], [[Genoa]]. Check the internet

===By car===
* '''A4'''.  From [[Milan]] and [[Venice]] (six-lane toll motorway).
* '''A5'''. From [[Ivrea]] and [[Aosta]] (four-lane toll motorway).
* '''A6'''. From Fossano, Ceva, and [[Savona]] (four-lane toll motorway).
* '''A21'''. From [[Asti]], [[Alessandria]], [[Genoa]], and [[Piacenza]] (four-lane toll motorway).
* '''A32'''. From Frejus and [[France]] (four-lane toll motorway).

==Get around==
=== By public transportation===
[[Image:Metro_Torino.png|thumb|Turin's metro map]]
Turin has an efficient system of city connections with buses and trams managed by GTT [http://www.comune.torino.it/gtt/en/]. Currently, the first driverless, ultra-modern underground line was opened for the Olympics in 2006. Both urban and suburban areas are served by an efficient network. Buses and trams cross the city from morning to late at night.

The hard part of bus travel is remembering you must buy your ticket before you get on the bus. All tabaccherie (tobacconists) sell bus tickets as do some bars and various ticket offices at stations.

There's possibly a bewildering array of tickets from singles to annual season tickets. Generally the longer the ticket the greater the saving but for many season tickets of one week or more you'll need a separate card with a photo ID which costs very little and can usually be issued on the spot by the ticket issuer. It's not necessary for single tickets or, in Turin, weekly town tickets.

You may run into ticket inspectors at any time, anywhere, even on night buses, but most of the time they are easily recognizable. Most of them do not speak English and some of them may be rude. Be sure to take your ticket/pass with you and validate it before the first stop after you get on the bus. If you are caught, you will certainly pay a fine of about 25euros on the bus. If you pay later, this amount may increase to 36 euros. If you forget to take your pass/valid ticket with you, you may tell the inspectors of your situation and then receive a fine ticket of 10 euros. Then you go to the GTT office with your fine ticket and your pass/valid ticket and pay. Some suggest that if you are not Italian, the fee will not reach you.

You're pretty safe in Turin with every bus or tram. The stops are clearly marked with yellow signs and maps of the city and public lines. If it appears to be a very long list, your stop will be highlighted in grey and buses go from the bottom to the top direction. If it appears to be a short list with just the highlighted area, you will probably see an arrow pointing down on the left of the sign, showing stops going from top to bottom. It takes a bit of getting used to! Some of the more modern and popular trams and buses have onboard indicators and announcements of forthcoming stops. But don't bank on it.

All buses are divided into urban and suburban. In Turin the urban tickets allow you to hop on and off of as many town buses as you like within 90 minutes of validating your ticket (fare at 1,50 € in 2012). Suburban tickets cost a little more and can get you anywhere up to 20km on some routes (1,70 € in 2012). They are also valid for trains within the same area. There's a bit of confusing overlap with some areas appearing to be both urban and suburban. If in doubt buy the suburban ticket, it's a lot cheaper than a fine.

You can also buy your tickets in a 'blocchetto' of 5 or 15, which works out at a reasonable amount cheaper. There are daily (€ 4,00) or 2-day (€ 7,50) or 3-day (€ 10,00) tickets for town travel as well as various weekly and monthly combinations [http://www.gtt.to.it/cms/en/fares]. If you plan to stay there for a few days and explore the city, then a 3-day pass is recommended and costs 10 euros; valid in all the urban network and all means of transport.

====Blue is the color====

Things get a little more complicated when you need to go further afield on the bus. Each town, district or region seems to have its own bus service. Generally in Turin there is a healthy selection of blue buses run by SADEM and other companies which tend to go further afield.

If possible still try to buy your ticket before you get on the bus, although vendors are not as numerous. Generally look around for the nearest tobacconist, cafe or news stand.

It should also be possible to buy your ticket on the bus, but this will cost up to 60 cents more and you may get a certain amount of abuse from driver who plainly is not on a percentage.

This also applies to the blue buses between Porta Nuova and Turin airport. There's a kiosk and two vending machines (usually out of action) at the airport and cafes near the terminal in Turin where you can buy tickets for five euro. In theory the bus driver should be able to sell you a ticket but don't bank on it.

*'''Torino and Piemonte Card'''

Torino and Piemonde Card is certainly worth its money if you plan to visit most places on the "See" section below. Using the three day(72 hours) option and paying 42 euros you have free access to all the museums and and other attractions of the city listed above. You also can use free the Venaria Reale bus service, which is operated by GTT, to travel to Venaria and see the restorated Palace. Of course the entry to the Palace is also covered by the pass(1 day 23euro with a max. of 3 museums, 2 days 35 euros, 3 days 42 euros, 5 days 51 euros). Also don't miss the opportunity to use the Navebus service and take a boat tour in the river Po. This service is also operated by GGT and is included in your pass. As of July 2012 the Torino and Piemonte Card does not included free travel in the public transport.The best option is to buy a separate pass for that.However the Card entitles you with free travel from Dora Station to Torino International Airport, service operated by GTT.As mentioned the Card is very attractive and cost effective if you plan to visit the top attractions of the city. Trip with chain train to Superga is also included with the small fee to reach the top of the church and a guided visit to the tombs of the Savoy Royal family.

===By bicycle===
The City of Turin has recently completed a network of bicycle paths throughout the city. However, a lot still has to be done, and cycling outside the paths (and sometimes even on them) can be quite tricky.
From 2010, a bike-sharing service provided by a company named ToBike is all across the city center. It's very difficult to find a ticket if you are not resident. It is possible to buy a ticket at the Tobike shop located in Via Santa Chiara 26/F.

===By car===
'''Car Rentals''' If you would like to rent a car, you can find all the main car hire companies at Turin Airport. 
Car rentals companies are grouped together immediately in front of the Domestic Arrivals, Ground Floor-Level Zero. Car Rental offices are also situated in the two main railway stations (Porta Susa and Porta Nuova).

===By taxi===  
Taxis in Torino start the meter the moment your call is received.  It is not customary to hail a taxi on the street.

==Buy==
Turin is not the best Italian city for shopping for fashion brands, although there are plenty of small and expensive brand shops. It's a great spot for buying food and wines.

* '''Via Roma''', from Piazza Castello to the main railway station. Here you can find upscale brands like Hermes, Gucci, and Prada as well as cheap chains like H&M, United Colours of Benetton, and Zara. In Piazza CLN, behind Piazza San Carlo, there's a good branch of La Feltrinelli, a bookstore chain with shops all over the country. 

* '''Via Garibaldi'''- People in Turin say it's the longest pedestrian shopping street in Europe. There are clothes shops, bars, a Nike store, and a new branch of the Japanese store Muji at the beginning of the street near Piazza Castello.

* '''Via Po''' is more alternative, with record shops and strange clothing stores under the arcades. It houses one of the three shops of Frav. This 2-story shop sells trendy clothes and is very popular in the city. This street goes from Piazza Castello to the Po River (Piazza Vittorio Veneto).

* '''Via Pietro Micca''' also houses upscale shops.

* '''Bookstores''' are very popular in Turin, and there are many in the Via Po area. An innovative bookshop is in Via Cesare Battisti, near a lovely square, Piazza Carignano. Together with books you can also sit down and have a cup of coffee, or the famous aperitivo.  The Luxembourg International Bookshop is at V. Accademia delle Scienze, 3 (just off Piazza Castello) and it's your best destination for English-language novels, EFL teaching materials and foreign magazines and newspapers.

* '''Quadrilatero Romano''' is a trendy neighborhood north of Piazza Castello. It is the most ancient part of the city, and once was an unsafe area. But now there are many design shops (Marcopolo, via Sant' Agostino) and independent shops like Autopsie Vestimentaire or Born In Berlin in its pedestrian cobbled streets. Lots of cozy restaurants and outdoor trendy cafes and bars (even if the competitor San Salvario area partially eroded their audience and appeal). For dog lovers, there is a dog park inside the fenced area around the Roman ruins.

* '''Porta Palazzo'''  in Piazza della Republica (north of the Quadrilatero) is the largest open-air market in Europe, and a spectacle that is well worth the visit (from 6 am to 13 pm working days, from 6 am to 19 pm Saturdays).  A newly built building by the famous architect Massimiliano Fuksas remains unused.

* '''8 Gallery and Eataly''' 8 Gallery is a long corridor with various shops, located in the Lingotto area, sharing the same building with the Politecnico di Torino Automotive department and Turin University. Created by the famous architect Renzo Piano, it can be reached by autobus No.1, 35, 18, and 17. Or if you are near the Lingotto FS station, you can pass a bridge that directly connects to the 8 Gallery. It is one of the few shopping centers which still open on Sunday. Next to 8 Gallery, Eataly is the greatest gourmet grocery in Europe: here you can buy, or eat, the best Italian food (guaranteed by Slow movement). Eataly Lingotto was the first Eataly grocery (opened in 2005): other spots opened in NYC, Tokyo, Rome, Milan, and Chicago (as well as in other Italian cities).

* '''Porta Palazzo market''' situated 5 minutes walking from Piazza Castello, at the very beginning of the multi-cultural quarter, is one of the biggest, cheapest, and most diverse markets in Europe. Turin has lots of street markets, all around the city, that serve thousands of people every day. Porta Palazzo is the best, especially for foodstuffs, cheap clothes, housewares, ethnic products, handicrafts, craftsmen, and second-hand stuff. The markets are open every weekday morning and all day long on Saturday. On Sunday Porta Palazzo houses a smaller flea market. Take a walk there, keep track of your wallet and pockets, and explore its multicultural, colored humanity.

==Stay safe==
Generally, Turin can be considered a safe city. Be aware that the Porta Nuova area (train station) can be pretty dangerous on its east side, not only at night (watch out for pickpockets).  This especially applies to the San Salvario neighborhoods, which lie between the station and Parco Valentino. Be very careful, especially with your luggage and backpacks.  

Also, the areas near Porta Palazzo can be dangerous, especially in the smaller streets.

Turin is home to two football clubs, Juventus and Torino, both playing in Serie A. Juventus is one of the most successful club sides in Italian domestic football having won the UEFA Champions League twice in their history, while Torino has also got a proud history. Juventus play at the Allianz Stadium in the north of the city while Torino plays at the Olympic Stadium constructed for the 2006 Winter Games. The rivalry is intense, so one would exercise caution when wearing their colors (Juventus wear black and white, Torino a brownish red) when the other side is playing. Wearing the colors of other Italian sides (AC Milan, Internazionale, Lazio, Roma, Fiorentina, and Napoli in particular) when they are playing Juventus should also be avoided, especially the colors of the two Milan sides and Fiorentina.

* House of Savoy residences and hunting reserves. The city of Turin is surrounded by magnificent XVI, XVII and XVIII residences, like the Royal Palace and Carignano Palace (in the center of the city), Valentino Castle (inside the city, near the Po river, within Valentino Park), Rivoli Castle (10 km west of the city), Stupinigi Hunting Pavillion (between the town of Orbassano and Nichelino, south of the city), the Racconigi Castle (near the border with Cuneo province). The two main Savoy hunting reserves, La Mandria Park and Stupinigi Park are now nature reserves.

* [[Alps]]. Turin is a city that feels its mountain legacy and their proximity is why so many inhabitants have second homes in the thousands of little valley villages. During Summer, if you have a day and want to relax, take a trip to Gran Paradiso National Park, Orsiera Rocciavrè Park, or Val Varaita Park. During Winter, the Alps offer a wide range of ski resorts, from one of the world's greatest, [http://www.vialattea.it Via Lattea], to a number of small ski areas which are less crowded and cheaper. The closest ski resort is Sestriere.

* [[Aosta]]

* '''Saint Michael’s Abbey''' (Sacra di San Michele) [http://www.sacradisanmichele.com/] a fascinating ancient abbey built on top of a rock at the beginning of Susa Valley. Only 30 minutes from Turin, by train: go to Avigliana and there take a taxi to San Michele. In summer, there are buses from Avigliana to the abbey. It is also possible to go to Sant'Ambrogio di Torino by train and walk from there. You need to follow the "Vecchia Mulattiera" (mule path) which is clearly marked by signposts (the first being in front of the train station). It can also be found on OpenStreetMap. Note that the path is quite steep and you should schedule at least 1-2 hours (for going up). On the other hand, there are beautiful views along the way.

* '''Sant'Antonio di Ranverso''', a medieval abbey with some wonderful 13-15th century frescoes. Very near to the Rosta train station, 20 minutes from Turin.
