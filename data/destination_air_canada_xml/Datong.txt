'''Datong''' is a city in [[Shanxi Province]], [[China]].

==Understand==
Datong is a small city with little experience with foreigners. People here are friendly and curious, and will definitely stare at foreigners. For simple entertainment, stop at a ''chuanr'' (meat on a stick) stand near Red Flag square, or Red Flag square itself and chat up the locals.

Datong itself doesn't contain much to do, with many 'historical' sites currently under construction, but makes for an excellent base for visits to the surrounding attractions. As of Summer 2016 the city is still covered in building sites, especially inside the recently constructed city wall.

==Get in==

===By bus===
*[[Beijing]] - 4.5hr. Buses depart every hour from the Liuliqiao Passenger Transport Hub (Liuliqiao Long Distance Bus Station 六里桥客运主枢纽) in the south-west of the city. To get there, take exits C or D from Luiliqiao Subway station (六里桥), which is on subway lines 9 & 10. Tickets are bought in the Transport Hub ticket office, at a cost of cost ¥133, and buses usually depart from gates 4 or 6. The journey is on very good roads, and includes a 20 minute comfort break about half-way as there are no toilets on the bus.

*[[Hohhot]] - Buses depart from Hohhot's bus station (next to the train station) regularly all day. Just turning up and buying a ticket should usually get you on a bus within an hour, two at most. The journey takes about 5 hours with average traffic conditions, costing c57. The buses terminate at Datong main bus station (a short taxi ride from the train station).

*[[Wutai Shan]] - Three buses a day in summer from Wutai Mountain from 8am to 1pm.

===By train===
Booking tickets at the Datong train station can be difficult for popular directions so book tickets from Datong as early as possible. 

*Beijing - 6 hr.  Daily overnight trains run from Beijing to Datong and back.  A hardsleeper ticket costs around ¥108.  Night trains are available from both Beijing West Station (Beijing Xi Zhan) and Beijing Station (Beijing Zhan).  In addition to the night train, there is a daily morning train, starting at 8:50AM and ¥54 for a hardseater.

*[[Pingyao]] - overnight train

*[[Xian|Xi'an]] - overnight train, approximately 17 hr. Train leaves for  Xi'an at 4:40PM. Hardsleeper (as Sep 23, 2010) ¥217.

===By Air===
*Beijing - 1 hr. Reasonably priced but expect early mornings.

==Get around==

[[Image:Yungang_Caves.jpg|thumb|Yungang Caves]] 
===By Bus===

* '''Bus 4''' - runs from the train station into town (6th stop (四牌楼）for 9 Dragon wall, 7th stop (清远街, bus sign “青年宫”) for Huāyuàn Monastery and Youth Hostel , 8th stop (红旗广场）for Red Flag square. The final stop on bus line 4 is the start of bus line 3.
* '''Bus 3''' - runs from the Xinkaili bus station (final stop of bus 4) to the Yungang Caves (end of the line).
* '''Bus 15''' - runs from train station to near the main bus station (the fifth stop from train station 市供排水集团 shìgōng páishuǐ jítuán, from that bus stop walk ahead to crossroads, turn left and main bus station 大同汽车站 is just ahead on left. ) 
* '''Bus 30''' - runs from the train station all the way to the south bus station (新南客运站), the last stop (45+ mins).

Buses within Datong are ¥1.  Trips to the Yungang Caves are ¥1.5.

===By taxi===
* Fares start at 7rmb and then increase in 1.6 increments. You can get around everywhere in the city itself for less than 10rmb, taxi drivers will happily take you further afield.

* It may be convenient and less stressful to hire a taxi to visit the main sites out of town.  A trip to the Hanging Monastery and Wooden Pagoda (both out of town - this is about 5 hours travel time) for 2 people cost for ¥400 in June 2016, with the driver waiting for us at each site. It is possible to do this for cheaper but for convenience and speed (plus stops to stretch legs at interesting places such as cave houses and dragon screens en route). If you find a good driver it is worth arranging for them to take you on your other trips as this can save time and money arranging something else.

You can try to find a taxi yourself (eg in front of the train station in the morning there may be taxi drivers seeking this business) or ask at China International Travel Service (CITS, +86 0352 5101816, +86 13008088454). If asking via CITS, do not forget to ask for a new taxi or you may end up in an old car which is not safe for a trip out of town. Local hostels and tours may have shuttle services starting at ¥300 for the Hanging Monastery and Yungang Grottoes, and others for higher prices.

These mountain-side caves and recesses are filled with 51,000 Buddhist statues - the largest being a 56-foot Seated Buddha while the smallest is only a few centimetres tall. In addition to the carvings of the Buddha, there are also scenes depicting Buddhist teachings and famous monks. Unlike Dunhuang grottoes, most caves here permit photography, (notably excepting caves 5&6).  The entrances to caves 5 and 6 are fronted by wooden temple structures.  The cave walls at these entrances were damaged by graffiti during the cultural revolution although the majority of the site is well-preserved. At least you get the impression that the caves are mostly ancient/original and not reconstructed.  Cave 20 may have people praying in front.</see>

Only the ground floor and the first floor of the pagoda are open to visitors. Maybe half an hour needed to visit. For an additional ¥40 you can visit a small exhibition on the premises.

A beautiful and newly constructed park surrounds the city wall and is well worth a walk through. The city wall itself is still under construction, it is a modern reconstruction and is by no means an ancient monument. It does, however, look very beautiful at night.

* <see name="XiPing Volcanoes" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">
Xiping is a smaller town than Datong about an hour away, there are a field of inactive volcanoes about 4 km east of the town and are a good place to go hiking if you feel up for it. Catch a bus to Xiping (¥5)from slightly up the road east of the Dong Guan Bus Station (Bus to Hanging Temple), not sure why this bus no longer leaves from Dong Guan Bus Station but learn the characters for Xiping and you will see it. Get off in Xiping and walk an hour east and you will see the field of volcanoes (rolling green hills). Its a long day of walking but a good chance to get outside and no entry fees means its a relatively cheap day. Could hire a driver also to explore.

==Do==
* <see name="Red Flag Square 红旗广场 Hóngqí guǎngchǎng" alt="" address="" directions="8th stop on bus line 4 from train station" phone="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">An area frequented by locals dining on streetfood, socialising and playing games. Most locals are unable to speak much English they will show some interest in foreigners and be willing to play ball/'kick the shuttlecock' or similar. Some very nice food on stalls nearby but not much going on as it is now largely closed off for reconstruction (June 2016). Worth a trip for some streetfood but don't expect an evening's entertainment.  As always, although most Chinese who show an interest in foreigners are just curious, or genuinely want to practise English, remember that young female/male con artists may target you in Datong just as in Beijing, Shanghai and elsewhere.</see>
