[http://www.visitbrisbane.com.au '''Brisbane'''] is the capital of the state of [[Queensland]] with a population of about 2 million people, making it the third-largest city in Australia. 

Its positive attitude and creative confidence makes Brisbane a genuine new-world city. Even though Brisbane is rapidly developing and forward-thinking, it maintains a youthful enthusiasm and has what is arguably the most vibrant, laid back and friendliest atmosphere of any east-coast capital city.

Gaining international exposure during the 1982 Commonwealth Games, the 1988 World Expo and the 2001 Goodwill Games, Brisbane's year-round warm climate, spectacular scenery and pleasant locals has been the draw-card for many domestic and international visitors, making Brisbane the fastest-growing city in Australia. In November 2014 the city hosted the G-20 summit, attracting thousands of media, delegates and security staff.

[[File:Brisbane skyline bluesky.jpg|thumb|View of Brisbane from Kangaroo Point.]]
Like most Australian capital cities, Brisbane features a large urban sprawl with many different areas having their own unique features and characteristics.

* '''The CBD''' (locally referred to as "The City") is where Brisbane's major businesses are interspersed with several shopping malls, cinemas, parks, office buildings, and many of Brisbane's historical tourist sites. Queen Street Mall [http://www.queenstreetmall.com/] in the heart of the CBD is Queensland's premier shopping destination and a must see for all visitors.

* '''[http://www.visitsouthbank.com.au/ South Bank]''' (often misspelled as 'Southbank') has ethnic restaurants, edgy cafes, riverside boardwalks and an inner-city beach. Located at South Bank is Queensland’s Cultural Precinct, which includes the Performing Arts Centre, Queensland Museum, the State Library, Queensland Art Gallery and the spectacular Gallery of Modern Art (GoMA). The term South Bank is also commonly used to refer to South Bank Parklands, which was the site of World Expo 88.

* '''Fortitude Valley''' (or "The Valley") [http://www.visitbrisbane.com.au/Travel/Precinct/Default.aspx?pid=10] combines Brisbane's Chinatown, alternative shopping and vibrant nightlife. Eclectic bars with emerging and innovative DJs and world-class super clubs have brought a larger than life feel to the Valley precinct. Home to the best live music and entertainment scene in Australia.

* '''[http://www.visitbrisbane.com.au/Travel/Precinct/Default.aspx?pid=2 West End]''', located just behind South Bank, is an edgy, bohemian district with artsy shops and cafes. West End is where you’ll find alternative books, cult video stores and organic produce and quirky locals. The area has several waves of immigration to thank for its feel, from the Greeks in the 1950's and 1960's and the Vietnamese in the 70s to the urbanisation of the last few years creating a new vibe. 

* '''[http://www.visitbrisbane.com.au/Travel/Precinct/Default.aspx?pid=11 New Farm]''', located next to The Valley, features upmarket shopping and trendy dining places. A confirmed favourite of the locals, New Farm is high up on the hot list of places to be and to be seen.

* '''[http://www.visitbrisbane.com.au/brisbane/things-to-do/shopping/racecourse-road?sc_lang=en-au Hamilton]''' Hamilton is home to Racecourse Road, one of Brisbane's oldest urban villages nestled next to some of Brisbane's most expensive real estate. It is a lovely Poinciana tree lined boulevard, which in December is a blaze of red flowers worth seeing. Fashionable shops are mixed with restaurants to see and be seen at just a few klms from the city centre. 

* '''[http://www.portsidewharf.com.au/ Portside Wharf]''', located at Hamilton, is where the cruise ships dock on the Brisbane River. This area was formerly known as Brett’s Wharf and offers fine dining, cinemas and specialty shopping. A great place to wander and have a meal.

* '''[http://www.visitbrisbane.com.au/paddington-and-rosalie?sc_lang=en-au Paddington / Rosalie]''' / Milton. Paddington is quickly becoming the place to shop with many little, unique boutiques full of local designs and hard to find fashion gems. Rosalie is home to many quaint bars, markets and restaurants. ''' Milton''' has two of Brisbane’s most famous icons placed side by side - the Castlemaine (XXXX) brewery and Suncorp Stadium.

* '''Mount Coot-tha''', a suburb as well as a mountain (more accurately, a large hill) approximately 6&nbsp;km (4&nbsp;mi) west of the CBD, easily recognised by the large TV and radio antennae that line its peak. The bushland area has numerous walking and cycle tracks. There is a scenic drive through the Mount Coot-tha Reserve which climbs to the Summit [http://www.visitbrisbane.com.au/Travel/Products/ProductView.aspx?id=24090], which has a restaurant and cafe, and offers majestic 360° views of Brisbane and the surrounding region. Mount Coot-tha also features at its base the Brisbane Botanic Gardens [http://www.visitbrisbane.com.au/Travel/Products/ProductView.aspx?id=484] and the Sir Thomas Brisbane Planetarium.

*'''Sunnybank''', a suburb that has a large Asian population. A great destination for authentic Asian food. This suburb is famous for its asian restaurants, which are located together in a large group. Usually when locals say “Sunnybank” they are referring to those restaurants, not the suburb.

*'''Bulimba''', a suburb located east of the CBD just across the river from New Farm, boasts some of Brisbane's best restaurants, easily accessible by ferry from New Farm Park and the CBD.

* '''[https://www.moretonbay.qld.gov.au/ Moreton Bay]''', part of greater Brisbane and is located to the north of Brisbane City. The region is known for festivals, markets and protected environmental areas. It is a great place to relax and unwind within an hour of the CBD.

Most inner-city suburbs have their own style and offer some small, unique attractions, notably cafés, restaurants, historical sites or artistic ventures. Some of the other major districts are Spring Hill, Indooroopilly, Manly Harbour, Toowong, St Lucia and South Brisbane.

== Understand ==
[[File:Walkway-Kangaroo-Point.jpg|thumb|Brisbane CBD by night from Kangaroo Point]]
For many thousands of years Aboriginal people have lived in what is now known as Brisbane. In 1823, John Oxley was the first English colonist to explore Brisbane, which was then selected by the colony of New South Wales as the location for a new jail, intended to house dangerous prisoners in a remote location. The settlement was named "Brisbane" after Sir Thomas Brisbane, the Governor of New South Wales at that time. The original settlement was established in what is now the suburb of Redcliffe but was later moved to a location further down the bay.

In 1837, free settlers moved to the area and pushed to close the jail and to release the land in the area.

In 1859, a gold rush led to the establishment of the colony of Queensland with Brisbane as its capital, named after Sir Thomas MakDougall Brisbane, the sixth Governor of New South Wales.

In 1925, the Queensland State Parliament created the City of Brisbane Act, and set up a single government for the city of Brisbane.

Recent strong migration to Brisbane and the whole of south-east Queensland is taking place due to cheaper house prices, a pleasant climate, and good employment opportunities. The area is currently facing the challenge of providing enough fresh water for its residents. You're not likely to find the tap dry or see any visible signs of the shortage, but keep your showers relatively brief (local water restrictions call for 4 minute showers).

Brisbane is notorious for having been established on the floodplain of the Brisbane River, which has resulted in major floods in 1893, 1974, 2011 and 2022. The flood in January 2011 damaged various infrastructure along the river and surrounding suburbs, but most businesses and services have since recovered from this event. The flood in 2022 impacted many houses and businesses, but was caused by different factors and not as extensive as the 2011 flood.

===Climate===
Brisbane has a year-round living climate.  When the wet season hits the northern Australian tropics, Brisbane enjoys hot and clear summer days (with afternoon thunderstorms).  When winter hits the southern capitals of [[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]] sending temperatures into the low teens (&deg;C) the Brisbane climate stays mostly dry and sunny, with daytime temperatures usually remaining above 20&deg;C.  

Humidity is high during the summer months and daytime temperatures can get as high as 35&deg;C with night temps rarely dropping below 20&deg;C. Occasional heat waves can raise the temperature in excess of 40&deg;C, however these are not common. Just about any outdoor activity you do at the height of a regular summer day in Brisbane will leave you bathed in sweat. In summer, a t-shirt with shorts and thongs (flip-flops) is appropriate attire for most casual activities, and air-conditioning will ensure you of a comfortable night’s sleep. Summer storms with hail and heavy rainfall are common in afternoons on hot humid days. They usually pass quickly.  

Limit your outdoor physical activity in the summer until you are used to the heat and drink plenty of water. Cover up with sunscreen, loose clothing, and sunglasses to protect from sunburn.

===Visitor centre===
The Brisbane Visitor Information Centre and Booking Centre [http://www.visitbrisbane.com.au/] on the Queen Street Mall, M–Th 9AM–5:30PM, F 9AM–7PM, Sa 9AM–5PM, Su and public holidays 9:30AM–4:30PM, closed Good Friday and 25 Dec. ☎ +61 7 3006-6290.

==Get in==

All visitors - apart from citizens of New Zealand - require a visa in advance of travel.

===By plane===

'''Brisbane Airport (BNE)''' [http://www.bne.com.au] is 20km (12 mi) north-east of the city centre at Eagle Farm, north of the river.

There are direct flights from all Australian capitals and numerous regional centres. Major carriers include Virgin Australia [http://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/plan/destinations/flights-to-brisbane/], Jetstar, and [[Qantas]]. The airport is serviced by many regional airlines and it is possible to fly daily to most Asian centres (and on to [[Europe]]), the [[United States]], [[Canada]], the Middle East and [[New Zealand]], without flying via Sydney or Melbourne.  

There are International and Domestic terminals, but some domestic flights leave from the International Terminal and some international flights (via other Australian cities) leave from the Domestic Terminal. Check which terminal your flight uses and don't presume based on whether it is an international or domestic flight. 

====Transferring between terminals====
Allow sufficient time for the transfer between terminals. The terminals are 3km apart and it's not practical to walk with luggage between them; the main road that connects them has no pedestrian walkway and is very busy.

Transfers between the airport terminals can be made on the '''Airtrain''' [http://www.airtrain.com.au] service. It offers connections during the day with a train every 15-30mins. The train fare is $5, $4.50 if you book a ticket online beforehand, and the trip lasts 2min. The Airtrain fare is included by Virgin Australia and by Qantas when connecting between their flights; just present your boarding pass to the Airtrain station staff.

* Domestic to International Transfers operate M-F 5:40AM-8PM, Sa Su 6AM-8PM.

* International to Domestic Transfers operate M-F 5:30AM-7:45PM, Sa Su 5:30AM-7:30PM.

Another option is the '''Airport Transfer Bus''' [http://www.bne.com.au/sites/all/files/content/files/BAC515%20Bus%20Timetable%20Master%20v1.pdf] service. Services operate approximately every 20 minutes between 5:20am and 10:50pm and bus stops are located outside the Qantas and Virgin Australia arrivals hall at the Domestic Terminal, and outside the arrivals hall at the International Terminal. The bus is free and this bus also services Airport Village, which is close to the Direct Factory Outlet (DFO) [http://www.dfo.com.au/brisbane/], a small shopping centre that specialises in clothing and homewares stores, but also contains a food court. It's expensive, but worth checking out if you've got more than a few hours between flights. Be careful though, as the last bus back to the airport terminals is at 6:20PM.

Outside of Airtrain hours or if you have a limited connection time, a '''taxi''' is your only option. If your flights are booked on the same ticket Virgin Australia or Qantas may pay for a taxi when booked on a tight connection.

====From the airport to the city====
* '''Airtrain''' [http://www.airtrain.com.au] connects to the city from the airport every fifteen minutes during peak times and stops at Central, South Bank, Fortitude Valley and Roma Street stations. An adult fare to the city stations is $19.5 and a return ticket is $37 and can be purchased at Airtrain stations. If you are purchasing a ticket online a week before of your travel, 15% discount for one-way or return journeys, but only if you are starting at the airport. Travel time to the city stations can be up to 30 mins. Trains start running between 5AM-6AM. The last trains leave the city around 9PM and the airport about 10PM. It is possible to take the Airtrain direct to the Gold Coast, although it is necessary to connect to a G-Link light rail service at Helensvale Station to reach Surfers Paradise, or a to connect to a bus service at Robina Station to reach Coolangatta.

* '''CoachTrans''' [http://www.coachtrans.com.au] also provides transfers via shuttle bus to Brisbane City accommodation and to the Gold Coast. Adult fare (one way) to Brisbane City is $20, and an adult fare (one way) to the Gold Coast is $44. Fares are cheaper if you buy a return ticket. '''You can end up waiting up to an hour''' if you try to book when you arrive at the airport, so pre-booking is a must and no refunds are allowed. Travel time varies depending on the number of passengers on the bus and traffic; it could be anywhere from 20 to 60 minutes.

* '''Public transportation''' Using public transportation, you can get to town for around $4 only. From the airport, ride the free of charge T-bus to Skygate (Airport Village). Note that the T-bus stops near the terminal building and not at the bus stop for other buses and vans (very easy to find though, or ask at the information counter), and only some of the T-buses go to the Airport Village (express buses only go between domestic and int'l whereas regular ones also go to Skygate every 20 minutes). From Skygate, wait at the place you got off the bus and take Translink bus 590 to Toombul Shopping Centre (only 2 stops). From there you can catch a train to the city. This costs under $4 with a go card, off peak. You can also buy single tickets, however that will be more expensive. You can purchase a go card at the Airtran station for $30 ($10 deposit and $20 usable), but you cannot purchase the go card at the Airport Village or from a driver. Thus for the cheapest way of getting to town, first go to the Airtran terminal to buy a go card but don't go through the turnstile and instead backtrack to the T-bus stop.

* A '''limo transfer''' [http://www.limousineline.net.au/airport-transfers.html] is by far the most expensive way to get around, but it is also the easiest & will be more relaxing than public transportation. You can book a limo ahead of time and the driver will meet you at the airport when you arrive. Most limo companies will monitor your flight in case the flight is delayed or even arrives early.

A taxi from the airport to Brisbane central costs approximately $50.  A good option for getting into the City can therefore be for two or more travellers to share the cost of a taxi to Brisbane Central.  Always ask a set price before agreeing to a taxi ride, however, and be sure to tell the driver how many people he/she is taking to avoid sudden price hikes with detail changes.  It is additionally useful to find a local returning home to avoid drivers taking advantage of foreigners.  Brisbane locals are invariably friendly and happy to skirt the system for convenience and cost savings.  From Brisbane Central or Roma Street station a traveller can get to just about anywhere else in Brisbane.

====From the Gold Coast====
Surfside buses regularly ply the route from Tweed Heads all the way along the Gold Coast, with connections to the train to Brisbane at Robina.  You can buy a single ticket to cover the trip, costing around $17.

* A '''Private transfer service''' [https://prioritytransfers.com.au/transfer/gold-coast-transfers] are available between cities and regional locations. They offer a similar service to taxi's and limo's, but at a more affordable price point. The services must be accredited by the Queensland Government and they must pre-booked by customers. The drivers must also have a driver's authority. Private Transfer services are available to transfer passengers to and from the Gold Coast Airport and Brisbane Airport, Hotels and other Tourist related locations.

The [http://www.goldcoastairport.com.au/ '''Gold Coast Airport'''] ({{IATA|OOL}}), also called '''Coolangatta Airport''', is a low-cost carrier hub, serviced by AirAsia X, Jetstar, Pacific Blue and others. It is NOT open 24h and closes at night, so don't plan on spending the night before an early morning flight. It's around 30 minutes drive to [[Surfers Paradise]]. There is a shuttle bus connecting the airport to the main Surfside buses route on Gold Coast Hwy between Tweed Heads and Surfers Paradise.

===By train===
* '''NSW TrainLink''' [http://www.nswtrainlink.info] operates two daily rail services from [[Sydney]], with connections from [[Melbourne]] and [[Canberra]].

* '''Queensland Rail Travel''' [http://www.queenslandrailtravel.com.au] has services from most centres in [[Queensland]]

===By car===
Visitors from southern states can reach Brisbane by either the New England and Cunningham or Pacific Highways.

'''The A1 Bruce Highway''' connects the northern coast of Queensland to Brisbane.

'''The M1 Pacific Motorway''' connects Brisbane to the Gold Coast and the Pacific Highway along the New South Wales coast.

'''The M2 Ipswich Motorway''' connects to Ipswich and surrounding Western Brisbane areas.

'''The A2 Warrego Highway''' links Brisbane to the west through the Lockyer Valley, Toowoomba and the Darling Downs.

'''The 15 (A15) Cunningham Highway''' links Brisbane to Southern Queensland and Central western New South Wales.

===By bus===
'''Premier Motor Service''' [http://www.premierms.com.au/] links some centres on the east coast of NSW and Queensland to Brisbane, as well as connections to Melbourne.

'''Greyhound Australia''' [http://www.greyhound.com.au/] link to most other locations to Brisbane.

===By boat===
Brisbane has recently become the home to an international cruise terminal titled Portside Wharf [http://www.brisbanecruiseterminal.com.au].

==Get around==
[[File:Riverfire Fireworks on Story Bridge (5082597027).jpg|thumb|Story Bridge]]
Getting anywhere in Brisbane is extremely easy. The CBD is relatively flat and condensed, which makes it perfect for walking or cycling and virtually all other areas can be reached by public transport. 

However, some areas can be difficult to navigate through a combination of dead ends, winding roads and steep slopes. This applies to some inner-city suburbs, but especially outer suburbs. If you find yourself lost, it's advisable to head to the nearest main road as more than likely it will be serviced by buses or trains. If you are driving, a street directory is an essential addition to your car. Locals are generally friendly and more than willing to help you out if you are lost, so don't be afraid to ask.

===By foot===
Brisbane is an excellent city for walking and you should have no problems getting around the CBD. Within minutes of walking in virtually any direction you will be able to find a bus, train or ferry station. Maps can be purchased from bookstores such as QBD (Queensland Books Depot) [http://www.qbd.com.au/], Dymocks [http://www.dymocks.com.au/], any tourist information centre or viewed online.

Beyond the CBD and inner-suburbs however, sights can become very spread out, so you might want to consider other modes of getting around.

=== By bicycle ===
[[image:BicycleBrisbane.jpg|thumb|Bicyclists on Clem Jones Promenade]]

Getting around the city and the surrounding areas is easy thanks to the many cycle paths along the river. Bicycles can be rented in the centre of the '''Brisbane City Botanic Gardens'''. 

The Brisbane City Council has recently introduced a scheme known as CityCycle, which offers bicycles for hire at different stations around the city. Tourists can register for a 24-hour period for $2 or for a week for $11  [http://www.citycycle.com.au/]. The bikes are free to use after that, as long as you return the bike to a station within 30 minutes (afterwards usage rates apply). You'll need to provide your own helmet, as it is the law to wear them, and few stations offer them.

Cycling on footpaths is legal in the Brisbane City Council area, however pedestrians have right of way. Keep left and take special care when riding through South Bank Parklands as the shared (and quite wide) foot and cycle path is often clogged with large groups taking up the whole path, pedestrians stopping unexpectedly for photos and playing children running heedlessly in front of you. It is often too noisy here to use your bell, so out of courtesy and safety, you're strongly urged to dismount and push your bicycle through crowded areas.

Maps showing bikeways in the Brisbane City Council area are available on the BCC website [http://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/facilities-recreation/sports-and-leisure/cycling/bikeway-and-shared-pathway-maps/index.htm].

Some areas of Brisbane are very hilly. If your street map shows a tangle of winding streets close together that is a sign of steep roads. A short trip can quickly become a lot of work, especially if you are using the heavy CityCycle bikes. Stick to the river when possible, it's where you get the best views and it is almost entirely flat.

If you leave the cycle paths, footpaths, and minor streets you should be prepared to contend with busy urban traffic. Feel free to ignore any Brisbane motorists that may have resentment toward cyclists and ignorance of the road rules applying to cyclists; cyclists are permitted to travel on just about all roads in Brisbane. Special "bicycle lanes" on Brisbane's roads are becoming increasingly common and are often denoted by a narrow green-coloured strip of road adjacent to the curb.

Wearing a safety helmet is '''mandatory''' in Brisbane (and the rest of Australia). The police issue a $120 fine for cycling without a safety helmet which is heavily enforced.

If you are more into guided tours. Electric Bike tours around Brisbane are a great option. These guys do 2 hour tours at day and night and you get to see the most of Brisbane in a short period of time.

====Green Cabs====

Green Cabs [http://www.greencabs.net.au/] are one of the latest additions to the city and growing in popularity. Essentially a rickshaw, they are a novel way of getting around the inner-city areas. Able to accommodate up to 2 adults and 2 small children (though it can vary - talk to the rider and see what you can arrange), they mostly operate between West End, South Bank, the CBD, Fortitude Valley and along the river where it's mostly flat, although you can arrange to be taken elsewhere. Prices start at $5 and tours are available.

Currently Green Cabs operate on weekends and during special events. During the day operators who are ready to go are usually based at South Bank at the Wheel of Brisbane. At night, you will find Green Cabs at South Bank and throughout the CBD.

=== By car ===

Many of the roads in Brisbane Central Business District (CBD) are one-way, making driving in this area complicated for people not familiar with the layout.  Drivers used to city driving should not find Brisbane too much of a challenge, and parking is readily available in parking stations in the city, albeit it at a steep cost, around $40 to casually park for a day. $15 parking is generally available with early-bird deals (arrive before 9AM, leave after 4PM.),

CBD roads become clearways at 4PM, and any cars parked on the side of the road will be fined, towed or both.  You have to pay for the towing to get your car back, and then they expect a fine to follow in the mail.  Check for signs when parking, or just play it safe and find a parking station.

An area of roads around the CBD are covered by the 'Brisbane Central Traffic Area', meaning that parking on unmarked roads is limited to 2 hours between 7am and 5pm on weekdays and before noon on Saturdays. More information including a map of the area affected can be found on the [http://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/traffic-transport/parking-permits/parking-brisbane-cbd/brisbane-central-traffic-area Brisbane City Council website].

If you are looking to visit the areas surrounding the city, then generally a car will be as quick as any other way of getting around, with the possible exception of the height of peak hour. Brisbane is notorious for having roads that bottle-neck and what would normally be a 15 minute trip could easily turn into well over an hour during peak. 

There are several toll roads in and around Brisbane, including the Gateway Bridge which crosses the river near the airport, the Clem-7 tunnel as well as the Go-Between Bridge. Cash is not accepted, toll users must have a prepaid transponder or post-pay via a website. Check the [http://queenslandtollroads.com.au/ Queensland Toll Roads] website for more details.

=== By motorcycle / motorbike / scooter ===

Brisbane Central Business District (CBD) is not the friendliest of places when it comes to finding a parking spot for your car. Leaving your car for an hour could cost you in excess of $25 or a few parking fines.  The best way to get around the CBD is either by scooter, motorbike.  Motorbike and scooter parking is free and there are plenty of areas designated for parking of motorbikes, scooters and Mopeds.

Mopeds, however, are not allowed on major highways.  Even though they can be ridden by just about anyone who holds a car drivers license, it is difficult to see all of Brisbane on a moped as most major streets are zoned as 60-80 km/hr and the standard 50cc mopeds are limited to 55 km/hr.  

North of Brisbane you will find many beautiful scenic drives for motorbike enthusiasts.  The North side is surrounded by many windy roads and great mountain roads on which any motorbike rider can enjoy a full day out on the motorbike of just about any size.  

There are services available throughout Brisbane and the Gold Coast which deliver both scooters and motorbikes right to your door-step.  Some will even provide all the necessary gear as well.  Take a look at a few rental companies below to find a perfect motorbike/scooter for your trip.

==== Rentals ====

Most major car hire companies have offices at Brisbane Airport and in the city centre.  As is common with many hire car companies, you will often pay a premium to pick up or return at the airport location. While most car rental companies hire to people 25 years of age and over, some all age car rental companies do hire to younger drivers over 18 years of age (there are surcharges involved for under-age drivers).

=== Taxi ===

Taxis are numerous throughout Brisbane and can take you anywhere. The major companies are Yellow Cabs [http://www.yellowcab.com.au/] and Black & White Cabs [http://www.blackandwhitecabs.com.au/cms/pages/!/display.html]. All cabs can be hailed down no matter where you are, provided their roof light is on, though in some areas they might not be able to stop, so it might be best to book one in advance. All cabs accept cash, credit and debit cards. Despite cabs being fitted with GPS units, you'll find it wise to check with the driver about your destination before departing and make sure they are willing to go there.

In the outer-suburban areas, cabs will pull over if you hail them down from the side of the road and can be found in designated taxi ranks in shopping centres, or near bars and pubs. The same can be said for the inner-city, however taxi ranks are more common and it's usually best to catch a cab from there. At night though, especially on Friday and Saturday, taxis exclusively pick up passengers from these ranks and you'd be extremely lucky if you get one elsewhere. These ranks are usually monitored by security and have ushers at night. Between midnight-5:30AM on Friday and Saturday nights, all taxis from the CBD and Fortitude Valley become "FlatFare", meaning that there is a fixed price for any given destination and you will have to pay before entering the taxi.

Taxis can be expensive in Brisbane; a trip between the airport and the city can be in excess of $50-60 and can easily run to over $100 if you go beyond the central Brisbane region.

=== Public transport ===

The three main public transport options of Brisbane (ferries, buses and trains) are linked by a common ticketing system, known as ''TransLink''. This coordination arrangement allows free transfers to be made between the three different transport modes, providing relevant time and zone restrictions are met. The TransLink website [http://www.translink.com.au] (13 12 30) is handy for researching public transport options between destinations, and is essential for Brisbane visitors planning their commute.

Single tickets for travel in Brisbane start at over $4 for a one way trip, the most expensive of any city within Australia and the third-most expensive globally (behind Oslo and London). A paper ticket is valid for travel only in the zones you ask for and is only valid for one way trips, so make sure you buy a ticket that covers all the zones you'll need to travel in. Paper tickets are being phased out in favour of the competitively cheaper Go Card (see below).

Travellers should ensure they have a valid ticket as ticket inspectors make frequent appearances and fines can be significant. You may also be required to display a valid student/senior card if you are travelling on a concession ticket type.

==== Go-card ====

TransLink has integrated ticketing called the '''go card''' [http://www.translink.com.au/qt/TransLin.nsf/index/go], a contactless smart card which you purchase before travelling and you top-up with funds. The fare is deducted as you touch-on and touch-off as you board and leave public transport. Buses and CityCats/Ferries are fitted with go card machines that are apparent when you board, whilst train stations have external panels located on the platform or nearby. A deposit of $10 applies when purchasing a go card. Go cards can be purchased and topped up online, or from staff at train stations, some ticket vending machines and selected newsagents and convenience stores, of which there are many in the city centre.

Buying a go card removes the hassle of figuring out zones.  Fares are discounted by 30%, and once you make 8 journeys with a go card during a Monday to Sunday week, then the travel is half-price until Sunday. Obviously, this works best if you arriving on a Monday.  Translink uses the word "journey" to mean end-to-end journey including any required transfers, and the word "trip" to mean the leg of travel on one vehicle.  A journey can be made up of one or more trips.  When making a number of trips to get to your destination it is still one journey if you touch on within 60 minutes of touching off on your previous trip.

Getting a go card will save you around 50c to $1 on the average journey.  However, getting a refund for the unused money and $5 deposit can be a hassle.  If you have paid by credit card you need apply and have the money returned by cheque or by transfer to an Australian bank account.  If you have paid by cash you can get a refund at a train station, including the airport train station.  Make sure you tap out when you get off or a penalty (A$30) will be deducted from your card!

==== SEEQ (See Queensland Card) ====

For a 3 or 5 Day Trip In Brisbane a SEEQ Card [http://translink.com.au/tickets-and-fares/seeq-card] may be better then getting a go-card. Unlike the Go-Card where fares are based on a pre-paid system and you pay for what you use, the SEEQ Card allows for Unlimited Trip on Translink Buses, Trains and Ferries.

====Fares====

The fare you pay will depend on public transport "zones" [https://translink.com.au/tickets-and-fares/fares-and-zones/new-zones][https://translink.com.au/tickets-and-fares/fares-and-zones/current-fares]. The 8 zones form concentric rings and propagate outwards from the CBD (zone 1).  All official public transport maps clearly mark the zones and zone boundaries. Generally speaking, most major attractions around the inner-city are within zones 1.   Your fare is determined by ''how many'' zones you travel through. Travelling between zones 2 and 3 will cost you the same fare as travelling between zones 7 and 8.  You must observe the time restrictions for transfers to avoid having to pay for another journey.

Often, major stops like shopping centres and busway stops are used as zone boundaries. Stops that form part of the zone boundary are considered part of both zones, so you may travel to them on a valid ticket that covers either zone. 

If buying a paper ticket, say which zones you wish for it to be valid for, although all operators generally know what to give you if you tell them your destination. Ensuring your ticket is valid for your current journey is important as bus drivers may make you pay for another ticket or not allow you on at all, and officers on trains and ferries may fine you.

If you are using a Go Card, then fares are calculated automatically.

====CityFerry and CityCat====
[[Image:Brisbane CityCats.jpg|thumb|Two of Brisbane's CityCats]]

CityFerries and CityCats have become an icon of the city and are fantastic ways to tour Brisbane along the river. The CityCats are high-speed catamarans with stops at South Bank and the city centre as well as many riverside suburbs, and are a very popular method of getting around for tourists. CityFerries are more traditional ferries which generally operate shorter routes with more frequent stops; you may end up on one if you must use one of the smaller terminals, but in practice, most riverside destinations are accessible from the faster and more modern CityCats. The red CityHopper ferries that operate in the city centre are free of charge, whereas the regular blue ferries attract a fee according to the above mentioned zones. These are also being phased out and being replaced with newer KittyCat ferries that carry up to 60 people.

====Trains====

Trains in greater Brisbane run along radial lines. Most train services in Brisbane are through-running, travelling from one end of the suburbs to the other, however all trains service Roma Street, Central, Fortitude Valley and Bowen Hills regardless of their ultimate destination. Interurban services can also be caught to the Gold Coast (using connecting bus services at Nerang and Robina) and Sunshine Coast (using connecting bus services at Landsborough and Nambour) as well as Australia Zoo (connecting bus at Beerwah). Trains generally run from 6AM to midnight, though there are some variations such as running later on Friday and Saturday nights, and finishing earlier on Sundays. 

====Buses====

Brisbane has a large network of bus routes. Virtually all buses have a digital display of their route number and destination(s). The inner city areas are well serviced by buses, with the most popular routes running from 6AM to 11PM as a minimum, and most routes ultimately terminating at Queen St Bus Station, Fortitude Valley (via Adelaide St or Elizabeth St) or on the '''busway'''. In some of Brisbane's notoriously dispersed outer suburbs, services may be less frequent or have reduced running hours, so it is advisable to check timetables if making these trips.

Brisbane's dedicated busway runs from a corridor in the southern or northern suburbs, through South Bank and the central business district. If you are unfamiliar with the geography of Brisbane, use of the busway is recommended where possible. The busway and rail network meet at Roma Street station, and the two combined provide very good coverage of the key inner city areas.

Drivers carry notes with them, but not always many or of high value. If you must pay cash, try to pay the correct amount and with coins where possible. Some services, especially in peak hour, do not sell tickets onboard and only accept pre-purchased tickets or go cards. These are signed with the letter ''''P'''' before the route number. Brisbane has express buses: not all buses observe every stop. In peak hour there are more express routes ("rockets" and "bullets") for commuters which make very few stops. Ask the driver if you are unsure.

Brisbane also has all-night bus services on Friday and Saturday nights on selected routes; this is branded 'NightLink'.

It is a prominent landmark approximately 6 km (4 mi) to the west of the Brisbane central business district and is visible from much of the city. Before the Moreton Bay penal settlement, Mount Coot-tha was the home of the Turrbal Aboriginal people. Early Brisbane people called it One Tree Hill when bush at the top of the mountain was cleared except for one large eucalypt tree. The Aboriginal people of the area used to come to the mountain to collect ‘ku-ta’ (honey) that was produced by the native stingless bee. Mount Coot-tha (Place of Honey), a derivative of (the indigenous term), replaced the former title ‘One Tree Hill' in 1880 when the area was declared a Public Recreation Reserve.

===Events===

Thanks to Brisbane's year-round wonderful climate, it's the perfect city to host outdoor events. The city often plays host to cultural and historic celebrations, music festivals and family entertainment, particularly in the Summer holiday months of December, January and February.

====Cultural and historic====

By far the largest and most popular event in Brisbane is the annual '''Brisbane Festival''' [http://www.brisbanefestival.com.au/]. This festival, which originally started as a celebration of the Brisbane River, now incorporates a number of smaller events at various places around South Bank Parklands, the Cultural Centre and the CBD as a celebration to Brisbane itself. Notably the 'Riverfire' event which is held in South Bank every September and draws the largest crowd. It offers free family entertainment all day and the city's biggest Fireworks display at night.

The annual Royal Queensland Show or '''The Ekka''' [http://www.ekka.com.au/] as it's almost exclusively called by the locals is a staple event in Brisbane's history and culture, held every August and dating back to 1876. It is hosted at the RNA Showgrounds in the inner-suburb of Bowen Hills and runs for a week, where the Wednesday is a public holiday (so expect large crowds on this day). Primarily marketed toward families, attractions at the Ekka include fairground rides, a Side Show Alley, animal parades, wood chopping competitions, agricultural displays, equestrian events and Showbags, usually containing food items (such as confectionery) and novelty items. If you are in Brissy at the time, it really is not to be missed!

The '''Brisbane Powerhouse''' [http://www.brisbanepowerhouse.org/], renovated from a decommissioned power station, is an arts and cultural hub located in the Brisbane suburb of New Farm, Queensland, Australia. The venue offers an array of performing arts, visual arts, festivals, and free community events along with dining and drinks at Bar Alto or Watt Restaurant+Bar.

In Musgrave Park, the Greek '''Paniyiri Festival''' [http://www.paniyiri.com/] is another popular family entertainment event. Brisbane has a large Greek population who come out in force to celebrate Greek culture. Offers authentic Greek foods and entertainment.

Brisbane hosts the bigest '''Tatoo Expo''' in the country (mid of July). You can not only meet tatoo artists and studios. There're live show accommpaning the event. [https://www.tattooexpo.com.au/].

====Music====

Brisbane has been named one of the world's top 5 hotspots for music by the influential US entertainment Billboard magazine. A night out in Brisbane is not complete without experiencing some of the live music on offer. The Valley has the highest concentration of bars, pubs and clubs anywhere in Australia and in 2005, was given Australia's first and only "Special Entertainment Precinct" zoning, which protects and promotes the live music scene.

If you are looking for what's happening in Brisbane, most music and entertainment stores as well as some hipster restaurants and cafés offer free entertainment magazines like Scene [http://scenemagazine.com.au/] that list what's coming up within the next month or so.

Though you might find most musicians playing in the numerous bars and clubs around the CBD, West End and The Valley, there are some venues which are geared specifically toward hosting bands or artists that are on official tours. Some events allows under 18s in, but not all, so it's best to check beforehand.

*'''Black Bear Lodge''' [http://www.blackbearlodge.com.au/] 322 Brunswick St, Fortitude Valley - tucked away above street level in the Brunswick Street Mall, this stylish candlelit speakeasy venue is the perfect place to enjoy a drink and gig.

*'''The Triffid''' [http://thetriffid.com.au/] 7-9 Stratton St, Newstead - an old World War II US aircraft hangar converted into a modern music venue by former bassist from the internationally-renowned Brisbane band, ''Powderfinger''.

*'''The Zoo''' [http://www.thezoo.com.au/] 711 Ann St, Fortitude Valley - this live music venue is almost more Brisbane than the river. Indie rock, hipsters and that alternative vibe.

The '''Valley Fiesta''' [http://www.valleyfiesta.com.au/] is an annual three-day event. It was launched by Brisbane Marketing in 2002 to promote Fortitude Valley as a hub for arts and youth culture. It features free live music, market stalls, food and drink from many local restaurants and cafés, and other entertainment.

== Drink ==

Brisbane's drinking and nightlife scene is separated into some distinct areas. Anyone planning a night on the town should be aware that after 3AM no more patrons are allowed into pubs and clubs. This is a safety measure, coupled with increased security presence at taxi ranks. Additionally, smokers should beware of strict anti-smoking regulations. Smoking is now banned in 'all areas where food & drink is served', both indoors and outdoors. This means that smoking is banned in all hotels, clubs, and cafés except in designated smoking areas.

The drinking age is 18 and only an Australian or New Zealand  license or 18+ card, or a foreign passport is accepted as proof of age. Other forms of ID such as a student card are not accepted. These regulations are strictly enforced - for nightclubs in particular your ID will always be checked at the door, and while venues serving food may let you in, most are very prudent in checking ID if you wish to purchase alcohol.

=== Fortitude Valley ===

The Fortitude Valley is a unique area of Brisbane catering to the live music scene. A large number of Brisbane's hippest clubs are located here.

More recently it is sometimes thought of as being one of the more dangerous areas of the city but this attitude is changing as the area becomes more popular and hence, safer. This however has had an adverse affect on the area's creative vibe as locals turn their back on the area, forcing the creative epicentre of Brisbane to other areas of the city such as West End and Paddington.

Less crowded than 'the valley' or the city, this bohemian district popular with locals offers a few hip clubs, intimate restaurants and a very laid back atmosphere.

Check out:

* '''Lychee Lounge''' [http://www.lycheelounge.com.au] 94 Boundary St - intimate setting, sensual cocktails, beautiful crowd

* '''Uber''' [http://www.uber.net.au] 100 Boundary St - opulent, sophisticated & funky restaurant/bar/lounge/dance floor. nice spot, popular with working professionals. Especially popular on Wednesday nights.

* '''Archive Beer Boutique''' [http://www.archivebeerboutique.com.au/] 100 Boundary St - located at street level beneath Uber, Archive stocks over 200 different craft beers, primarily Australian. The food is generally excellent, although the menu is in no way as extensive as the beverage list. Prices are reasonable, particularly on Sunday "Beer O'Clock" where the price on the majority of bottled beers are reduced to $5.

* '''The Boundary Hotel''' [http://www.theboundaryhotel.com.au/] 137 Boundary St - West Ends oldest pub has recently (2011) completed extensive renovations. This is perhaps the largest drinking establishment in West End, with two bars downstairs and a beer garden & deck on the upper floor. The food is fairly plain but well priced, and the drinks menu is about the same. Excellent live blues acts Sunday afternoon and evenings from Wednesday to Saturday are the main reason to visit.  

* '''Sling Lounge''' [http://www.slinglounge.com/] 153 Boundary St - extremely knowledgeable cocktail staff, with a huge range of drinks on the menu. Bigger than it appears from the outside, you'll find a garden hidden out the back with high ceilings and a great atmosphere complemented by the jazz and lounge music usually playing. It can get busy on Friday and Saturday nights, with a resulting increase in wait times for your beverage. Well worth visiting, especially during quieter times - the staff are more than happy to walk you through the process of making your drinks, including the reasoning behind each individual ingredient being included. Tapas is also available, but prices are a little high considering serving size. 

* '''Rumpus Room''' 56 Russell Street - great cocktails, and a good selection of spirits and bottled drinks. The music here is primarily funk and hip-hop, with live DJs on the weekend and during the latter half of the week. The beer garden out the front is a great spot to relax in the shade on a hot day and meet some locals. The crowd tends to be a lot thicker and drunker on Saturday nights, however.

* '''Lock n Load''' [http://www.locknloadbistro.com.au/] 142 Boundary St - friendly staff, live music most evenings and a decent array of cocktails. The beer garden at the back is a nice spot to relax, but is often crowded. Excellent spot for a light meal.

* '''The End''' [http://www.73vulture.com/] 73 Vulture St - Calls itself a "boutique bar for everyone". Quite small inside, so if you're not there early you will probably miss out on a seat to 'hipper than thou' types. Decent selection of beers at the average price, ever-changing seasonal cocktail menu.

=== Craft Beer ===
In the past few years Brisbane has seen a surge of interest and activity surrounding craft beer. If vague lagers aren't your drink of choice then there are some great new venues for the hop-head traveller to check out.

* '''Kerbside''' - [http://www.kerbside.com.au] cnr Constance and Ann St, Fortitude Valley - 3 taps and lots of bottles. This bar has a laid back feel with second hand furniture (from 'kerbside' collections) in what used to be the drive through bottle shop. Tapas style food is available.
* '''Archive Beer Boutique''' [http://www.archivebeerboutique.com.au/] 100 Boundary Street, West End - Arguably has the largest selection of craft beer in Brisbane. Open for lunch Mon-Fri and does your standard pub fare.

* '''Bitter Suite''' [http://bittersuite.com.au] 75 Welsby St, New Farm - 7 taps and a moderate range of bottles. Located in a quieter residential back street this cafe offers great food for breakfast, lunch and dinner served with some great beers.
* '''Tipplers Tap''' [http://tipplerstap.com.au] 5/182 Grey St, Southbank - 11 taps and a moderate range of bottles. With a keg line up that frequently changes and an American street food inspired menu this is a great afternoon retreat. 
* '''Bacchus Brewing Co.''' Unit 1, 2 Christine Pl, Capalaba - While not a bar this homebrew supply place also doubles as a micro brewery supplying some of the above venues. Your long journey from the city (approx 23km) will be rewarded with the ability to sample all of the 40+ beers produced by the brewery.

===Internet===

There are numerous internet cafes around the CBD. Check this page [http://www.ourbrisbane.com/food-and-drink/cuisine/Internet%2BCafes] for the closest one. Expect to pay around $2-3 per hour, although most places will offer you a discount if you pre-pay a certain number of hours.

There are also alternatives to internet cafes:

* Free Internet access is available at the Brisbane City Council library, although you might need to book your session in advance.

* Free Internet (including wifi) access is available at the Queensland State Library, South Bank in selected areas.  The main Infocentre area is quite large and has a number of 30 minute (no booking) and 60 minute (booking required) computers.  The 60 minute computers are booked using a queuing system upon arriving at the library (no library card required).  The Infocentre also has a very large lounge and desk area for those with their own laptops wishing to use the free WiFi.  Printing is $0.10 per page, but requires the purchase of a $2 copy card in addition to the per page cost.  The library is also air-conditioned (as one might expect) so is a good place to spend some time during the scorching mid-day heat.

* Many cafes and hotels provide free WiFi access to patrons.  Keep an eye out for signage and use the internet city guide.[http://www.brisbane.tv]

===Crime===
Brisbane has a relatively low crime rate in comparison to other cities of such size. In most cases being aware of your environment and using common sense will keep you safe. Like Sydney and other large cities, trains and train stations are usually considered a common crime zone throughout the afternoons and nights, however trains and stations are patrolled by Police, Transit Officers, railway personnel and private security guards. Cameras are also used to increase security. It is advised to exercise caution when travelling on trains and buses during these periods of the day.

On trains at night especially on a weekend it's not uncommon to be harassed (not majorly, just verbal annoyance) by ignorant, casually racist bogans. "Get out me country" and so on.

(Advice from a local): Crime isn't a major issue for most people in Brisbane. It is generally a case of "wrong place, wrong time" and many crimes are considered out of the ordinary when they occur.

Here are some particular areas of note:

* '''Outer Suburbs''': Tend to have a higher crime rate than inner suburbs which should be taken into account when visiting these areas.
**Days: Very safe during the day, but using common sense goes a long way. Avoid gangs of people, especially if they seem trashy or obnoxious and be mindful if a questionable person approaches you.
**Nights: Like most other places, outer suburbs to get more dangerous. It is recommended that individuals walking in these areas at night take precaution or venture within a group. 
**Suburbs to avoid: Most of the dodgy Brisbane suburbs are far away from the common tourist trail and on an international scale, would be considered generally 'safe'. Avoid Bracken Ridge, Brendale, Caboolture, Ipswich, Acacia Ridge, Inala, Goodna, Logan Central, Kingston and Woodridge. 
Safe outer suburbs include Redcliffe, Wynnum and Shorncliffe.

* '''City Central/CBD''': Usually very safe at all hours.
**Days: Very safe during the day thanks to a good police presence and most people only being there for work. Though during school holidays groups of youths can congregate, especially around Queen St and South Bank and can get rather rowdy, but they usually mind their own business.
**Nights: Still relatively safe at night. Police presence isn't as strong, except on Friday and Saturday nights, but you're still urged to travel with others. Be careful if catching a train at night, even though the train stations and trains are well patrolled and watched by CCTV. Treasury Casino patrons often gather outside and unwanted attention can be received late at night due to drunks. However, security is tight and the entire area around the Casino is monitored by CCTV. Take extra caution if in South Bank at night due to groups of youths congregating there.
**Suburbs to avoid: No inner city 'no go' zones exist, but it's adviseable to avoid parts of New Farm and South Brisbane, particularly near Musgrave Park at night. During the day, this part of South Brisbane is generally safe.

* '''Fortitude Valley''': Police presence very strong here due to the concentration of bars. 
**Days: Just as safe as the CBD during the day. 
**Nights (especially Friday and Saturday): Taxi ranks in particular can be a little dangerous due to many frustrated drunks having to wait for cabs. Wait only at ranks that have a security guard. Stay to the well-lit busy streets and never venture off alone, especially down back-streets or far away from a crowd. Especially for females, it is recommended to travel in pairs or groups to avoid any unwanted attention from drunken travellers, especially in the early hours of the morning.

* '''Suburban pubs''': generally less safe than inner-city pubs, bars and clubs due to less police and security. Drunks can be a hassle when in the vicinity of suburban pubs, especially around closing times. Fights in these venues are common.

==Sun safety==
'''Important!'''
Probably the worst thing that can befall your trip to Brisbane is ''sunburn'' and other heat-related issues. The ''local UV Index is almost always in the '''extreme''' rating during the day (10AM-3PM) and precautions should always be taken''. Do not be fooled though, even in the cooler months or when it is overcast you can still be affected by UV rays or the heat.  Sunscreen, shirts, sunglasses and lots of water are essential. Try to stay in the shade as much as possible.

== Get out ==
Brisbane provides a base for day trips to explore the southeast of [[Queensland]]. The North Coast of [[New South Wales]] can also be reached in an hour if traffic is light, but allow up to two hours travel if traffic is heavy or there is an accident on the Pacific Motorway. Queensland Rail also provides extensive services out of Brisbane to the north and south of the city and to the Gold Coast.
