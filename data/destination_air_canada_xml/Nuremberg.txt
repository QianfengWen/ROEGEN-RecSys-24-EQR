== Understand ==
[[Image:Nürnberg_panorama.jpg|thumb|old town, view from west]] 
When people think of Nuremberg, they usually think of gingerbread, toys, Christmas, the Nazi Party Rally Grounds or the Nuremberg Trials. The old town of Nuremberg is much more than this and indeed Nuremberg probably comes closest to many tourists' expectations of a typical German city: on the one hand one can find half-timbered houses, gothic churches within a medieval city wall in the shadow of the towering imperial castle, which was one of the most important residences of the emperors of the Holy Roman Empire. On the other hand, Nuremberg and the surrounding cities are home to many well-known German companies, e.g. Adidas, Diehl, Faber-Castell, Playmobil, Puma and several divisions of industrial giant Siemens. Finally, Nuremberg even can live up to culinary expectations with breweries and beergardens and its most famous dish, the Nuremberg sausages with Sauerkraut.

Between it and the five-cornered tower is the ''Kaiserstallung''. It was built in 1495 in only one year and served originally as a storehouse for grain. Today it is used as a youth hostel. The ''five-cornered tower'' was constructed before 1050 and is the oldest building of the castle and city. Further east are the entry to the castle garden and the castle gate. Through the castle gate one gets to the ''Freiung'', where you can enjoy one of the best views of the old town. If you want to look further you can climb the round tower (''Sinwellturm'') in the first court of the castle. There you also find the deep well (''Tiefer Brunnen''). In the main court is the Kemenate on the right and the Palas on the left side. The Palas houses the ''castle museum'', further rooms including the two-storey chapel can be seen on a guided tour.

From the 13th to the 16th century the wall was continuously strengthened and is one of the reasons why the city withstood all attacks during this time. Nearly four kilometers of the wall are still standing. Only on the east side between the main station and Rathenauplatz are large gaps. The city moat, which was never filled with water, still exists in its full width for about two kilometers.

* '''175 Years of Railway in Germany''', [http://www.nuernberg.de/internet/bahnjahr2010_e/]: Nuremberg is the central venue for the german Railway Year 2010 because it is here that 175 years ago, the first German train took to the tracks. On 7 December, 1835, the steam-driven "Adler" started off from Nuremberg’s Plärrer square towards the neighbouring city of Fürth. The Town attracts between late spring and the end of 2010 visitors with a programme of events which will appeal to railway enthusiasts and non-specialists alike.

==Buy==

Nuremberg's main '''shopping district''' ist the ''Lorenzer Altstadt'', the part of the old town south of river Pegnitz. There are three shopping streets running from the white tower (''Weißer Turm'') to the vicinity of St Lawrence church (''Lorenzkirche''): The cheapest stores can be found in ''Breite Gasse'', in ''Karolinenstrasse'' you find mid-priced stores and ''Kaisserstraße'', next to the river, offers luxury goods. At their eastern end the three streets are connected by the street ''Königsstraße'', which runs from the main station via St Lawrence church to the main market place. The biggest '''department stores''', ''Karstadt'', ''Galeria Kaufhof'' and ''Breuninger'', are located here. On '''Trödelmarkt''' you find some small snugly shops. At ''Sebalder Altstadt'' you find antiques, curiosities and designer shops.

'''Malls''':
*'''City Point''', Breite Gasse 5, 90402 Nürnberg (City)
*'''mercado''', Äußere Bayreuther Strasse 80, 90491 Nürnberg (North)
*'''Franken-Center''', Glogauer Straße 30-38, 90473 Nürnberg (South)

'''Outlets''':
'''Puma Sport''', Klingenhofstr. 70, 90411 Nürnberg (North-West)

'''Gothic, Dark Wave, Fetisch''':
*'''Crazy Fashion''' (for Adults only), Schweiggerstr. 30, 90478 Nürnberg (South)
*'''Mac's Mystic Store''', Ludwig-Feuerbach-Str. 13, 90489 Nürnberg (South)
*'''Underground''', Königstr. 39, 90402 Nürnberg (City)
*'''Vampiria''', Kappengasse 10, 90402 Nürnberg (City)

The shopping streets and smaller centres outside the old town have less to offer. Only visit them if you are looking for a specific shop.


*<buy name="Galerie Parfum" alt="" address="Weißgerbergasse 22, 90403 Nürnberg" directions="old town" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="">Luxury boutique for rare, niche perfumes and gifts.  Nürnberg perfume is located here. </buy>
===Souvenirs===

'''Ginger bread''' (''Lebkuchen''): Several large manufacturers and a number of small bakeries produce these. The best quality is called ''Elisenlebkuchen''. The large manufacturers sell packages labeled ''Bruch'' (broken), but they usually don't contain broken gingerbread: it is just a trick. You get them cheaper, but you can hardly use a package labeled ''broken'' as a gift.

'''Sausages''' (''Nürnberger Bratwürste'') are available in tin cans.

'''"Nürnberg Parfum"''' The scent of Nürnberg was developed by a local perfumer.  Available only at Galerie Parfum Weißgerbergasse 22.

==Eat==

'''Bratwurst''' (roasted sausage): Within the city you get Nürnberger Bratwürste, in the surrounding area Fränkische Bratwürste. Nürnberger are only about half the size, but contain more spices than Fränkische. Consequently one typically eats three Fränkische or six Nürnberger. In restaurants Bratwürste are served with Sauerkraut or potato salad. In some better restaurants you can order also "Saure Zipfel", cooked Bratwürste in vinegar-onion sauce with fresh horseradish and bread. On the street you can also buy two or three sausages in a roll ('Drei im Weggla'). But be careful to get "real" Nürnberger and not "foreign" Thüringer Bratwürste. ''Nürnberger Bratwürste'' / ''Nürnberger Rostbratwürste'' is also protected under EU law with ''Protected designation of origin'' status. 

===Budget===

Many food stalls and fast food restaurants can be found along Königstraße leading from the main station into the old town.

One stand is in the middle of the street perpendicular to the front of the Lorenzkirche.

==Drink==

'''Beer''': many great beers are made in Franconia (the area around Nuremberg has the largest concentration of breweries world wide) and even in the Nuremberg itself. About 300 Breweries still working.

'''Wine''': The Franconian wine is said to be a "man's wine". Analogous to "man's chocolate" this points to a rather dry taste. Furthermore the rather harsh climate and the soil structure definitely contribute to this fact. An extravagance of the Franconian wines is their bottle. In Germany the Bocksbeutel bottle shape is generally reserved for higher-quality wines from Franconia.
