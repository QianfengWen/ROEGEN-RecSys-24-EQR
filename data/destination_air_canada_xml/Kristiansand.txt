'''Kristiansand''' is the capital of [[Vest-Agder]] County, [[Norway]]. By population, it is the fifth largest city of Norway.  The city is sometimes called '''Kristiansand S''', where S stands for South, to distinguish it from [[Kristiansund]] in western Norway.

==Understand==

Kristiansand is the largest city located between [[Oslo]] and [[Stavanger]].

Kristiansand is located on Norway’s southern coast and has long been a favourite summer holidays spot amongst Norwegians. The sea and surrounding fjords are perfect for recreational activities like fishing and sailing. Kristiansand is the business and cultural capital of Southern Norway. Nicknamed “the coolest riviera” by the media, it is a modern city with a cosmopolitan history.

The city was named after its founder King Christian IV in 1641. 

The name was written "Christian(s)sand" (for "Christians sand" - meaning en:(King) "Christian's Sand") until 1877. Then, the ch was changed to k, the form was changed to "Kristianssand". The name was again changed to its present form Kristiansand in 1889.


==Get in==
===By plane===
'''[http://www.avinor.no/en/airport/kristiansand Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik]''' ({{IATA|KRS}}) [http://www.avinor.no/en/airport/kristiansand] is located 12 km (7 mi) north-east of the city. 
SAS [http://www.sas.no] runs 8 daily flights to [[Oslo]], 6 to [[Bergen]] and 3 to [[Stavanger]], as well as 3 daily flights to [[Copenhagen]] and a weekly flight to [[Alicante]]. Norwegian [http://www.norwegian.com/en/] runs 3 daily flights to Oslo, as well as some weekley flights to Bergen and [[Trondheim]].  Planes from Dutch airline KLM depart twice daily for [[Amsterdam]].
There are bus connections to the town centre for every arrival, both airport buses and local buses. The airport bus costs kr 100. Local buses are to the left as you exit. No 35 and 36 to city centre Kvadraturen is kr 37 (Jun 08). Taxi to Kvadraturen is kr 280/350 in weekends.

===By train===
Regional trains connect Kristiansand to other cities and towns along the Southern Railway Line (Sørlandsbanen). Up to 8 trains daily depart for [[Stavanger]], while up to 6 daily trains leave for the country's capital, [[Oslo]]. The trip to [[Stavanger]] takes about 3 hours and the trip to Oslo between 4 1/2 to 5 hours. Trains both westwards towards [[Stavanger]] and eastwards to [[Oslo]] follow an inland route, meaning that travel to the towns along the coast is quite inconvenient by train. There are lots of nice forest views and rural settlements, though.
The train station[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristiansand_Station] is situated right next to the town centre, the ferry terminal, and the bus terminal.

===By car===
Kristiansand sits along the E18 highway from Oslo. The highway changes its name to [[European_route_E39|E39]] when it passes Kristiansand on its way to Stavanger. Route 9 starts in Kristiansand and takes you through the natural beauty of the [[Setesdal]] Valley to Haukeligrend on the [[Hardangervidda]] (Hardanger Plateau), while Route 41 leads to the north-western parts of the county of [[Telemark]].

===By bus===
The bus-connections to Oslo and the towns along the western shore of the Oslo Fjord is excellent. Nor-Way Bussexpress [http://www.nor-way.no/] has 9 daily connections to [[Oslo]], Konkurrenten.no[http://www.konkurrenten.no/] 4-7 buses while Lavprisekspressen runs twice daily. You are guaranteed a seat - if the bus is full, the bus company will add an extra bus. Lavsprisekpressen[http://lavprisekspressen.no/] provides online ticketing only.
These express busses are usually just as fast as the trains to Oslo. To towns such as [[Larvik]], [[Tønsberg]] and [[Sandefjord]] you might arrive several hours later if you go by train.
There's also infrequent express bus connections to Stavanger and up along the [[Setesdal]], with connections to cities such as [[Bergen]] and [[Haugesund]]. Regional buses run frequently along the coast, from [[Lyngdal]] and [[Lista]] in the west to [[Arendal]] in the east, run by several different bus companies. 
The bus terminal is located about 100 meters from the main shopping street, right next to the ferry terminal and the train station. There's also a taxi stand here.

===By boat===
'''Ferry''' companies operate car ferries to [[Denmark]], 2 times each day (3 times on Saturday - Monday) to [[Hirtshals]]. The trip takes 3 hours and 15 minutes, with the brand new superspeed ferry services.


The port has a lot of '''cruise ship''' arrivals in the summer, and is one of the biggest cruise ship ports in Norway.  From the cruise ship port, is a walking distance to city centre and the boardwalk, the bus terminal, the ferry terminal and the railway station[http://www.cruise-norway.no/Ports/Kristiansand/Default.aspx].

==Get around==
The town's centre is quite compact, which means that everything is within walking distance. Suburbs are spread over quite a large area. There are dedicated bike lanes along most of the main roads.

===By car===
Most roads except the highway is just one lane each way - thus rush hour should be avoided. Parking might be difficult in the city centre, try the parking houses. There's a toll booth on all roads leading to town.

===By bus===
Nettbuss Sør operates the blue city buses. Eastbound buses depart from the Henrik Wergelands gate while westbound buses depart either from the Tollbodgata or from the bus terminal. Northbound buses (to [[Vennesla]]) leave from the bus terminal.
The main lines going from west to east is called the Metro bus. You can expect a bus every 5 minutes on weekdays. Service elsewhere is quite frequent during daylight hours, but the frequency drops significantly in the evenings and on weekends. Night buses operate Fridays and Saturdays.

====By taxi====
Taxis are expensive.

In Kristiansand, there are two major Taxi Companies:

==Stay safe==
Norway is a fairly safe country in general, and Kristiansand is no exception. Though you might want to be extra careful at night in weekends, due to an occasional drunk youths stumbling around.  Pickpockets can sometimes be a problem, especially in the crowds, and be cautioned against giving money to beggars on the streets.

==Cope==
Kristiansand is nice small city and almost every Norwegian speaks English more or less fluently. Most people will respond in English to any question you may have. Some Norwegians also speak some German, due to the proximity of the country and that they study it in school.
VISA and MasterCard are normally accepted in any restaurant, taxi or store. ATMs accept all major credit and debit cards and are available in English language. The currency is Norwegian kroner (crowns).

==Get out==
