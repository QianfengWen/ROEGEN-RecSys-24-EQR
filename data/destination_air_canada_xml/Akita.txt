In Akita, late June to late July is the rainy season.  The spring and summer before and after that tend to have fairly moderate amounts of rain, and are good for outdoor activities.  Compared to the southern half of Japan, it does not get the brain-crushing humidity that comes over the country like a thick blanket, but they pay for it with a long, bitterly cold winter. In November, it is common for some cold weather thunder storms to occur -- this is said to mark the end of fall and the beginning of ''hatahata'' (a local fish) season.  In the winter, Akita sees moderate to heavy snow, though certainly inland areas get more.

==Get in==

===By plane===
Akita Airport (AXT) has domestic flights coming in from such places as [[Tokyo]], [[Nagoya]], [[Osaka]] and [[Sapporo]]. Buses connect the airport with Akita Station (秋田駅) -- a ride costs ¥980 and takes 40 minutes. There is one international route from [[Seoul]] on Korean Airlines.

===By train===
The '''Akita Shinkansen''' provides hourly service from Tokyo Station to Akita Station.  These trains, called the ''Komachi'' (こまち) trains, have only reserved seating. The Komachi stops at [[Tokyo/Ueno|Ueno]], Omiya, [[Sendai]], [[Morioka]] before slowing down to travel to Shizukuishi, Tazawako, [[Kakunodate]], Omagari, and finally Akita over conventional rail lines. Trains also reverse direction once at Omagari, the stop before Akita.  Komachi trains from Tokyo reach Akita in four hours and cost ¥18,500 each way. Be aware that the Komachi trains are coupled to [[Aomori]] or [[Hakodate]]-bound Hayabusa trains, which split at Morioka, but as all seats are reserved the chance of getting in the wrong car is minimal at best. For foreign tourists traveling from Tokyo, the better deal is to purchase a '''JR East Tohoku Area Pass''', '''South Hokkaido Rail Pass''', or the national '''Japan Rail Pass'''.

===By bus===
* JR Bus operates the ''Dream Akita-Yokohama'' overnight bus to Akita from the bus terminal at [[Yokohama]] Station (9¾ hours, ¥9500) and from [[Tokyo]] Station (8¾ hours, ¥9100).

* Odakyu and Akita Chuo Kotsu run the ''Flora'' overnight bus from [[Tokyo/Shinjuku|Shinjuku]] (8 hours, ¥9450).

* The ''Senshuu'' daytime bus runs from [[Sendai]] with multiple departures (3½ hours, ¥4000).

===By boat===

Two ferries go to [[Hokkaido]] -- one to [[Otaru]], and the other to [[Tomakomai]].  Both of those towns are relatively close to [[Sapporo]].  To the south the ferries go to [[Niigata]], and also to [[Tsuruga]] and [[Maizuru]] (which are roughly near [[Kyoto]]).  Reservations can be made in English by email.  For Golden Week and busy times, ferries fill up weeks or months in advance.  These ferries accommodate passengers with or without vehicles, though the ferry terminals may be inconveniently located for passengers on foot.</listing>

==Get around==
You can get around by bus, taxi, car, or bike.  Many bus routes start in front of Akita Station.  In the winter, there can be snow and ice, so drivers should decrease their speed.
You can walk around much of the main sites from the train station weather permitting. The train station also [http://www.acvb.or.jp/sp/news/detail.html?id=2063 rents out bicycles] for free (9AM-6PM, Nov 9AM-5PM) through the tourist information office.

The most well-known Akita dish is '''kiritanpo'''. It is essentially a tube made of rice, generally formed around a disposable chopstick. It is often roasted, sometimes after being smothered in miso paste. It is also eaten in '''kiritanpo nabe''', a stew of sliced kiritanpo, vegetables, and chicken or fish, most commonly eaten during the winter.  Of course, there are many non-local styles of food available in Akita City, including a wide variety of ramen and Indian restaurants.

As one of Japan's most famous rice-growing regions, Akita has some of the best local sake in all of Japan.  A great place to find many different bottles for sale (and usually free samples) is in the Prefectural Goods Shop in the basement of the Atorion Concert Hall.

==Sleep==
Akita seems to be not very popular for budget travelers and is quite lacking in budget accommodation in any convenient location. Some travelers sleep in their cars, and if you can find a quiet area, this is typically not a problem.  However, if you drink in the evening and sleep in your car, it is a good to use a personal breathalyzer before driving the next morning as even a small amount of alcohol in your system makes driving illegal, and the police are known to watch for people who have slept in their cars.
