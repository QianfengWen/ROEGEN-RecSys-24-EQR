You can take this 37 minute ride for 6RMB. Line 2 has opened at December 2020, as Line 1 would be scheduled to be built in 2024. The link provided has no English settings, but if you scroll down and see five white buttons. From left to right, the first button featuring curved metro lines and circles leads you to the metro line area where you'll see a long red line. Click on the red circles on the line, and if you click it, there would be two options, the green and the red. The green one is for the starting point, and the red as the ending point. Click on two stations (your starting point and ending point) on the map, and click on the button at the left panel. After doing so, a new panel would pop up. If you haven't learnt much Chinese, there are four icons. The first indicates a clock. And next to the clock is some numbers, indicating how long the ride would travel(in minutes). The second one indicates a money logo, and next to it is the fare. The third one indicates a curvy line with circles and it shows how much stations would you pass through in the ride. The fourth is not too important, as it shows how much times you need to transfer, but since there is only one line, you can ignore it. It always shows 0 as for now. The second button indicates a location logo enclosed in a box. This is where you can see the 3D map of a station, and it indicates the toilets and exits of every station. If you want to switch to a station, click to the top left of the 3D panel to switch it. The third button has a clock, and it shows the train timetables of the first and the last train. You should remember some of the station's Chinese name, as it may be very important later. The fourth button is just what people should know in the train. It's just the usual. The fifth one is also the same as the fourth one. Scroll even more, and you'll see Taiyuan Metro Culture, where it features "station art".</listing>
