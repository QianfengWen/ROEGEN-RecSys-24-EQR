[http://www.visitcanberra.com.au/ '''Canberra'''] is the capital city of [[Australia]]. The city is located in the '''Australian Capital Territory''' (ACT), an enclave in the south-east of New South Wales. 

Canberra is a planned city, with national monuments, museums and galleries built around a large artificial lake.  As a bush capital, Canberra is also a great place to enjoy the outdoors, with excellent cycling, gardens, parks, bushwalking and nature reserves.

===History===
Canberra was established in 1913 as the capital for the newly federated Australian nation. The ACT was excised from [[New South Wales]] and put under the control of the federal government. The creation of the planned city was not without critics who claimed it was a "waste of a good sheep pasture". 

Canberra's design was conceived by the American architects Walter Burley and Marion Mahony Griffin, built on the shores of an artificial lake (Lake Burley Griffin). Populated at first largely by politicians and public servants, it took time to develop its own identity and culture. Extensive building of national facilities and a concerted effort to develop public institutions in the city have made it an interesting destination.

===Geography===
Lake Burley Griffin divides central Canberra.  The central shopping and commercial area, known as "Civic", is on the north side and the parliamentary triangle and embassy area is on the south side. National institutions are likewise divided, examples being the National Museum of Australia and the Australian War Memorial on the north side and the National Library and National Gallery of Australia on the south side.

There are suburbs surrounding central Canberra, and also suburbs surrounding several outlying town centres.  These town centres are, Belconnen and Gungahlin to the north, and Tuggeranong and Woden to the south. The ACT also has surrounding towns, such as [[Murrumbateman]], which boasts a strong cool climate wine selection. The historic village of [[Hall]] is also on the outskirts of Canberra.

It had a population of 395,790 people at the time of the 2016 Census [http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2016/quickstat/UCL802001].

===Time===
Australian Capital Territory follows the same time as [[New South Wales]] that surrounds it. It's 10 hours ahead of GMT (UTC+10) and 11 hours ahead (UTC+11) during daylight saving (first Sunday in October and ends the first Sunday in April).

===People===
Many people who live in Canberra are not originally from Canberra, having usually moved there to study or take up employment with the Australian Government.  A common pattern is that people from other parts of Australia move to Canberra, study or work for a few years and then return to their place of origin or move on to elsewhere.  As this means a constant influx of new arrivals to Canberra, you should not be reluctant to ask for directions and the like from locals - they are more than used to it and usually only too happy to help.

Canberrans on the whole are easygoing, friendly and tolerant people who have the highest levels of education and income in Australia.

Ethnically, Canberra's population is more diverse than most regional areas of Australia, but nowhere near as culturally and linguistically varied as [[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]].

Canberra can get just as hot as anywhere else in Australia during the summer months, with temperatures above 30ºC a frequent occurrence from December through to March. It can get bitterly cold during the winter months (June-August) owing to its altitude and proximity to the [[Snowy Mountains]].  Overnight temperatures in winter frequently drop below zero and tend to hover slightly above 10ºC during the day.  However, it is usually a clear, brisk cold, and rarely a dull, damp cold. 

Canberra is less humid than Australian coastal cities.  The hottest days are often mitigated by welcome, cooling, mountain breezes, particularly towards the end of the day, and the temperature drops overnight.

===Visitor Centre===
The comprehensive visitor centre has recently moved to Regatta Point on the north shore of Lake Burley-Griffin. It shares a building with the National Capital Exhibition.  ☎  +61 2 6205-0044.

[http://www.canberraairport.com.au/ '''Canberra International Airport'''] ({{IATA|CBR}}) is well served by flights from other Australian capital cities. Its always been known as Canberra International Airport, although international flights only resumed in 2016 after a long absence. 

There are flights almost hourly to [[Sydney]] and frequent flights to [[Melbourne]].  Other capitals may see only a morning and evening flights.  A flight from Sydney to Canberra only saves an hour or so over driving from Sydney and for those who are not coming from an area close to Sydney Airport, air travel offers only a marginal time saving.

The following airlines fly to Canberra daily:

*[http://www.virginaustralia.com/ Virgin Australia] flies to and from [[Sydney]], [[Brisbane]], the [[Gold Coast]], [[Townsville]], [[Melbourne]], [[Adelaide]] and [[Hobart]].
*[http://www.qantas.com.au/ Qantas] flies to and from Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Adelaide, Darwin and [[Perth (Western Australia)|Perth]].
*[http://www.flypelican.com.au/ FlyPelican] flies to and from [[Newcastle (New South Wales)|Newcastle]] and [[Dubbo]]

Flying time is 50 minutes from [[Sydney]], 1 hour from [[Newcastle (New South Wales)|Newcastle]], [[Dubbo]] or [[Melbourne]], 2 hours from [[Brisbane]] and [[Adelaide]], and 4 hours from [[Perth (Western Australia)|Perth]].

International Services operating to / from Canberra include; 
*[http://www.singaporeair.com/en_UK/au/home/ Singapore Airlines] flies from Singapore to Wellington via Canberra International. As of December 2017, flights to Canberra depart Singapore at 23:00 hrs on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday

Flights from Canberra to Wellington depart at 11:00 hrs on Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday. The return leg operates on the same day. Flights from Canberra to Singapore depart Canberra at 00:35hrs on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. 

* [https://www.qatarairways.com/en-au/homepage.html Qatar Airways] flies from Canberra to [[Doha]] via Sydney.

ACTION buses, the local public bus company, has recently added an airport service. Routes 11 and 11A leave at least every half hour during operating times and travel directly to the City Bus Station. The services are still somewhat erratic, and the last service is in the early evening, so best to check the timetable [http://action.act.gov.au].  Tickets are $4, including a transfer. There is a private bus service provided by the Royale Group [http://www.royalecoach.com.au/canberra_airport_shuttle.asp] for $10 one way into the city, with no discount for return.

Taxis are available in front of the terminal towards the Qantas end for around $25 to Civic.

It is possible to use Canberra's offroad cycleway network to access the airport. Follow the cycleway along the north side of the lake. A section of cycleway was recently completed alongside the Molonglo River underneath the Monaro Highway Bridge which veers left and passes underneath the Pialligo Avenue bridges. Turn right, cross the creek (beware of the gravel surface at this point), cross over Fairbairn Avenue, use the airport service road through the airport precinct, and make your way to the terminal.

There is a long stay and short stay car park, both within walking distance of the terminal. Expect to pay around $17 per day to park at the long stay. The long stay is cheaper than the short stay only if you park for a day or more. 

There are convenient scheduled international services to Singapore and Wellington, New Zealand, on Singapore Airlines.  International visitors can also fly to [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]] or [[Brisbane]] and transfer to connecting flights.  There are coach services to Canberra non-stop and direct from Sydney International Terminal taking around 3.5 hours.  The last coach leaves Sydney airport at 19.15 Monday to Wednesday, 20.15 Thursday to Saturday, and 21.15 on Sunday.

===By train===
[[Image:Countrylink-Xplorer-2502-at-Central.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The Countrylink Xplorer at Sydney before leaving for Canberra via the Southern Highlands and the scenic Molongolo Gorge]]

'''NSW Countrylink''' [http://countrylink.info/] runs from [[Sydney]] to Canberra three times a day, morning, midday and afternoon, every day in both directions. The trip takes just over 4 hours, which is slower than a bus or driving, but the train takes a very scenic route through the [[Southern Highlands (New South Wales)|Southern Highlands]] and the Molongolo Gorge, compared to an unexciting freeway journey by road. The train arrives in Kingston on the south side of Canberra, a pleasant 25-30 minute walk from the closest of the attractions on the south side of Lake Burley Griffin. Buses connect the station to Civic (the Canberra CBD) on the northern side of the lake, ACTION buses pass the station every 15 minutes on weekdays (routes 200 and 80) and every hour on weekends (route 980). Cash fares cost $5, and are good for anywhere in Canberra for 1.5 hours. The tap on tap off MyWay card is much cheaper especially off peak and weekends. Taxis and coaches to further destinations meet each train arrival. It is possible to do a day trip from [[Sydney]] and get 5-6 hours to spend in Canberra. Bicycles must be boxed and checked as luggage on CountryLink services and cost $12.10 per bicycle, and there is room for only three on any train.

The economy train fare is $40 year round, bookings are essential but the train is rarely fully booked except around annual holidays, There are no discounts except for seniors, students, unemployed and people on disability pensions, who pay half fare.

If you are enthusiastic about train travel, desperate to save money, travelling from [[Sydney]] and wish to see [[Goulburn]] on the way, the Cityrail train to Goulburn costs $10.80, and the Countrylink train from Goulburn to Canberra costs as little as $10.

Countrylink also runs a once-daily train/bus between [[Melbourne]] and Canberra: the bus runs from the centre of Canberra (City Bus Interchange) via the Barton Highway, Burley Griffin Way and the Olympic Highway to the town of [[Cootamundra]], where travellers switch to the XPT (Countrylink Train) to Melbourne's Southern Cross Station; tickets cost $91 in off-peak and $107 in peak season.  

V/Line runs an alternative train/bus service between [[Melbourne]] and Canberra: the bus runs from the Jolimont Centre coach terminal (across the road from the City Bus Interchange). This service is called Canberra Link. The bus runs to Wodonga, from there a V/Line train will take you through to Melbourne's Southern Cross Station. Northbound, the reverse applies, train from Melbourne to Wodonga or Albury and bus to Canberra. Tickets cost $46. This is the better option and takes eight hours. You can travel with or without reservation but reservation guarantees you a seat on both the coach and train.

V/Line also run a Canberra service via the NSW and Victorian south east coast to connect with the Melbourne train at [[Bairnsdale]]. This service is called Capital Link. Services run twice a week (three times a week during Victorian school holidays). At Bairnsdale, a road coach will take you via Orbost, Cann River and Cooma to Canberra, with stops at Canberra Railway Station (Kingston) and the Jolimont Centre (across the road from the City Bus Interchange). Tickets on this service also cost $46.

===By bus===
All coaches to Canberra stop at the Jolimont Centre, in the city centre and immediately across the road from the Canberra local bus (ACTION) interchange. The burgers at the Coach station are worth trying, for their sheer size.

'''Murrays''' [http://www.murrays.com.au/], tel 132251, Murrays operate up to 10 daily express services between Sydney (Central Station) and Canberra with extra services on peak days.  They are the main operator on this route. Service takes 3h30min, bookings are between $35 (non-changeable) to $41 (fully flexible, you can rebook on another bus up to half an hour before the journey). The service is non-stop (with some services via Sydney International Airport). Murrays also run a daily service from Canberra to Wollongong and Canberra to Narooma. The coaches are more cramped than the trains. Seats are unassigned, so it helps to be there early and not to have luggage to go under the bus, as that lets you get on first and secure your window seat. Buses often fill to capacity, and can experience delays due to peak traffic into and out of Sydney, although the non-stop nature means that they have been known to run 10-15 minutes early on a good run.

'''Greyhound Pioneer''' [http://www.greyhound.com.au/], tel 131499, operate a bus service competing with Murray's. Fares seem to be either $15 or $36, so you might get lucky and get a cheap ride. Note that it may not be possible to get the $15 fares when booking a return journey; if so, you probably need to book each leg separately. They also offer a direct service to [[Melbourne]]. Greyhound's coach services usually include video entertainment.  The Greyhound services have stops which make the service slower than Murrays'.

'''NSW Countrylink''' also run daily buses to and from [[Eden]] on the South Coast, via [[Bega]] and [[Cooma]].

===By car===
The drive from [[Sydney]] to Canberra is 290 km and takes around three and a half hours from the Sydney CBD, less from outer suburbs in Sydney. The road is dual-carriageway, mostly freeway-like conditions from the Harbour Bridge all the way to Canberra, mostly with a 110km/h speed limit, via the M5 Motorway, Hume and Federal Highways.  There are three sets of on-road services located on the Hume Highway between Sydney and the turn-off to the Federal Highway to Canberra, as well as many well-maintained and often scenic rest stops with toilets and picnic tables ideal for a picnic.  Take drinks, as the rest areas have no water, or tank water which is not recommended for drinking. A third option which will enable you to see more of the countryside is to stop at one of the small towns in the [[Southern Highlands (New South Wales)|Southern Highlands]] on the way which will have a cafe or two.

It is rare to make the entire trip between Canberra and Sydney without at least one police speed trap. The city of Goulburn, on the way to Canberra, is the training centre for New South Wales police officers and often send new recruits to run speed checks on the freeway. There are also several fixed speed traps, all of which are signposted in advance.

The drive from [[Melbourne]] to Canberra is 650 km and takes roughly eight hours on the Hume and Barton Highways, again mostly on dual-carriageway roads.

[[Image:City_Centre_Canberra.JPG|thumb|City Centre]]
While Canberra on the whole is not walkable by any standards, some parts of it, including Civic and the central part of the northern shore of Lake Burley Griffin, as well as the sights at the southern shore of Lake Burley Griffin, are possible to tackle on foot.

For transfers between suburbs, the best options are the bus, the [https://www.actcabs.com.au/ car], and the bicycle.

===By bus===
[[Image:Canberra_ACTION_bus.jpg|thumb|right|ACTION buses are Canberra's primary form of public transport]]
'''ACTION''' buses [http://www.action.act.gov.au] cover the majority of Canberra. 

Fares are $4.90 for adults and $2 for concessions. An all-day ticket costs $9.00 for adults and $3.80 for concessions. If spending more than $20 on tickets, you may want to consider purchasing a ''MyWay'' stored value card. It offers discounts on single tickets, monthly and weekend all-day travel. However, there is no discount on weekday all-day tickets. 

The inter-town routes are frequent and reliable, especially during peak hour, but are often crowded. Other services can be infrequent, particularly in the off-peak and weekends. Check timetables carefully. 

Tips for riding the buses:
* If you need to change buses to get somewhere, ask for a ''transfer'' ticket; it will let you on to as many buses as you need within 90 min of getting on the first bus.
* Tell the driver where you need to get to, and ask them what your options are. Some buses snake through the suburbs and can take a while to cover a relatively short distance while others may be more direct or express services.
* To travel between the interchanges (Belconnen, Civic, Woden and Tuggeranong), catch any bus in the 300 series (300, 312, 313, 314, 315, 318 or 319) as these are much faster than other buses. Note that this service runs as 900 on weekends and public holidays.
* Buses do not operate between midnight and 6 a.m. Monday to Saturday or after 7 p.m. on Sundays and public holidays.
* Many buses (including inter-town routes) have a push-bike rack on the front, and the passenger can put the bike there to get to another bike-friendly destination.

===By bike===
Bicycles are a practical way to get around Canberra while visiting, and will get you to most attractions using a well developed network of off-road cycle paths. Functional bicycles can be bought cheaply from The Green Shed [http://www.thegreenshed.net.au/] at the Resource Management Centre (tip) at Mugga Lane, Symonston and Flemington Road, Mitchell, expect to spend around $30 and bring an air pump and puncture repair kit.  

Canberra also has generally well developed on-road cycle facilities but the on-road cycle lanes do sometimes end and start in utterly inexplicable places.  The grade can be a little steep as away from central Canberra is fairly hilly, but all the attractions around the lake are accessible on fairly flat paths.  Pedal Power [http://www.pedalpower.org.au/rides-and-events/cycling-facilities-in-canberra/cycling-maps/] has a list of commuter and other routes.  Bicycles are also permitted on footpaths in the ACT (except when passing shops during trading hours).

There are bike racks to lock your bike up at most shopping centres and points of interest.  Bike helmets are compulsory.

The intertown buses will carry two bikes on bike racks on the front of the buses.  The bike racks have clips, so no additional equipment is necessary.  Only 20" tyres or larger bikes are carried. There is no charge for using the bike rack.  Kids must be accompanied by adults, and child seats and other accessories must be removed from the bike.

A bicycle path map bought from a visitor information, petrol station or newsagent also shows bike paths and on-road cycle lanes.  The map is also online at the ACT Department of Planning [http://files.transport.act.gov.au/cyclingmap/index.html].

===By car===
{{infobox|Town Centre?|Drivers are often confused by the many signs around Canberra that direct you to the "Town Centre".  The unanswered question that the sign poses, is "Which Town?".   The city centre, also known as "Civic", is its own centre, but the other Canberra "towns" are Belconnen and Gungahlin (to the north of the lake), and Woden, Weston Creek and Tuggeranong (to the south).  Each of these towns has its own suburbs.  You will see signs directing you to each of these towns, but once you get closer the sign will simply direct you to the "town centre".  You need to know which town you are in for the sign to make sense.}}

Most [https://visitcanberra.com.au/attractions attractions in Canberra] provide parking at no extra cost, However paid parking (AUD$9.50-$14 daily) has recently been implemented within the central suburbs. Canberra roads are generally of excellent quality and relatively uncongested.

The default speed limit on all roads in the ACT is 50km/h, unless signposted otherwise. Major roads in the ACT will have 60-100km/h speed limits in 10km/h intervals. There is little rhyme or reason regarding how a speed limit is set in the ACT, with similar roads having vastly different speed limits.  In some situations, the same road will have a different speed limit for traffic heading in oposite directions. Speed limit signs within the ACT tend to be spiradic and intermittently placed. Several major limited access roads like the Tuggeranong Parkway (between the City and the town centres of Woden, Weston Creek and Tuggeranong) are 100km/h, though others are 80-90km/h.

The ACT also has the highest amount of speed cameras per capita in Australia. Fixed speed cameras have plenty of warning signs in advance via overt signage. Red light/speed cameras have much smaller warning signs, usually not coupled with a sign reminding of the speed limit. Mobile speed camera vans operate on major roads in the ACT. These may be overtly or covertly parked, and may be identified by a large white sign on the roof.

Motorists should watch out for 40km/h school zones which in Canberra are active throughout the school day (8am-4pm) (unlike surrounding New South Wales where they only operate for an hour or two at the beginning and end of the school day). School zones are rigorously policed.

The main shopping and commercial area of Canberra is known as Civic, but you will never see a signpost to Civic.  It is signposted as "City".

Take change for parking meters in Civic if you want to park on the streets or in the government parking lots. Parking in the CBD can be difficult on weekdays, due to development of carparks and encouragement to take public transport. There are several multi-level carparks near the Canberra Centre with ticket pay-stations and pay-booths. Note that all day parking in the Canberra Centre is cheaper on the rooftop level. You will need to collect a parking entry ticket from the first boom gate and then feed the ticket into the second boom gate as you enter the rooftop level.

Fixed speed traps in Canberra are highly visible with multiple signs informing motorists that they are approaching a speed trap. However, mobile police speed traps are set up in large, highly visible white vans with police signage informing motorists that their speed has been checked. Many red light cameras double as speed cameras regardless of whether a red light infringement has occurred. The signage for these speed cameras is substantially less visible than the signage for standard speed cameras.

There are remarkably few fuel stations on the main roads. Instead, they tend to be located near local shops, off the main roads. Look for the small blue fuel pump signs pointing off the main roads. Start looking well before you run too low. There are several petrol stations just east of Northbourne Avenue at Civic.

In the suburbs of Tuggeranong, the "Monaro Highway" is signposted as a destination on numerous signs for the three roads that head east-west. The Monaro Highway is actually a north-south road to east of Tuggeranong Town, and the intended meaning is that the road is an appropriate route to the Monaro Highway.

* '''Embassies'''. As the national capital, Canberra hosts the embassies of most countries, listed below in [[Canberra#Embassies|Embassies]]. Most of the embassies are built in an architectural style typical of that particular country. In Yarralumla (the closest embassy district to the city), the '''Embassy of China''', '''Embassy of Papua New Guinea''' and , '''The Royal Thai Embassy''' are particularly worth a look. The '''Embassy of the United States of America''' is also worth a drive past, being the oldest embassy in Canberra. It is best to have a car or bicycle for touring so you can stop and have a look around.
*<see name="Government House" alt="Yarralumla" address="viewing platform off Lady Denman Drive, Yarralumla" url="http://www.gg.gov.au/content.php/page/id/39/title/government-house"> The main official residence of the Governor-General of Australia, representative of Queen Elizabeth II in Australia.

Well worth a visit, day or night, for the fantastic views - look for the cork tree plantation and Parliament House. It has a revolving restaurant and telecommunications history display. Above the restaurant there is a two level viewing platform: the bottom level is indoor and has a souvenir shop and refreshments; the upper level is an open air area. Its a nice view, but the mountain is already already 260m above the lake, and the viewing platform is only another 60m above the mountain.  You can decide if that is worth the price of admission.</see>

===Country ACT===
[[Image:Namadgi_Bimberi_wilderness.jpg|thumb|right|Bimberi wilderness, Namadgi National Park, southern ACT]]

*'''Take a scenic drive into the southern ACT''' - recommended by locals:
**Head south to Tharwa, and then take the road to Adaminaby. The road is very good for all of what I describe, any car can go on it, but further south than what I describe requires a 4WD. Take the road out of Tharwa, and remain on the road for about 10km. Take the signed road to Honey Suckle Creek. Very important historical site, this is where the signals from the Apollo 11 space landing were received, and then beamed around the world. Also a nice drive, and a very good camp ground.
**On the same road, not far off the Adaminaby Road is a walking (Fire ranger) trail to the top of Mount Tennant. About a 5 hour round hike, but worth every step. Go back onto the Adaminaby road, and head south. Another site of a space centre on the right down the road, worth a look, but not as interesting
**Remaining on the road for another ten kilometers, entering the Namadgi National park, and two hundred meters after a single lane bridge is a signed turn off to Yankee's Hat. This is a four km drive, any car can take it, and look for Kangaroos. Hundreds either side of the road. The walk to Yankee's hat will take you to see aboriginal art.
**Road to Adaminaby. If you have a robust vehicle, take the road south. The country is magnificent. It takes about an hour from Yankee's hat.

If consensus is achieved to allow apartment listings in an article then any listing MUST include a local address with a phone number and the listing must also specify the physical address at the destination.  Please consult the Rental listings section of the Wikitravel:Accommodation listings article for guidelines.

==Stay safe==
Canberra is a very safe city and enjoys one of the lowest crime rates in all of Australia. However, be cautious, especially around bus interchanges, where some youths may tend to be hostile.

Despite its apparent affluence, Canberra has people who live 'rough'. Particularly around Civic, it is not unusual to be asked for money. This is a well-organised activity targeting both visitors and locals: if you simply say that you don't have any money, the beggar (real or fake) will usually move on to the next available person (unless they will start stalking you, in which you'll need to look over your shoulder to be sure you're not followed).

There are no public lockers. If you want to store your luggage, book a room or keep it at a friend's place.

==Contact==
The National Library of Australia provides free WiFi and free internet access from its 40 computer terminals (webmail is blocked on some computers, so ask the staff to show you which ones you can access webmail from).  The library is located adjacent to Commonwealth Avenue Bridge on the southern side of Lake Burley Griffin near the National Gallery of Australia and Questacon.  It is open 9AM-9PM Monday-Thursday, 9AM-5PM Friday-Saturday and 1.30PM-5PM on Sundays.

There is also free internet available at all of the public libraries in Canberra, though the terminals at Tuggeranong may be occupied during school hours by students of the college next door since it is a dual-use library. Membership is not required, but you may have to book a few hours in advance due to high demand.

McDonald's restaurants in the ACT offer free WiFi, no purchase required. Full list of participating restaurants available at [http://www.maccasfreewifi.com/]; there is one in the Civic bus interchange in the city centre. Service is subject to content filtering and session download limits.

The Pancake Parlour at Civic (in the Sydney Building, near bus bay 4) also offers free Wi-Fi to customers, along with power points at several tables.

The Barracks LAN Games & Internet Cafe located in the Bus Interchange in Civic offers pay for use internet and gaming. It goes without saying that it smells like a 13 year old's room in there.

==Get out==
NSW regions:
* [[Queanbeyan]] - located just across the NSW border. Many people live in Queanbeyan and work in Canberra. 
* [[Yass]] - Service town, near the road to [[Melbourne]]
* [[Goulburn]] - Country town, worth a visit if you are travelling onward to [[Sydney]].
* [[Snowy Mountains]] - the New South Wales and Victorian ski fields are only a 2.5 - 3 hour drive from Canberra, via car or bus. Keep an eye out for Kangaroos and Wombats if you are driving. 
* [[Batemans Bay]] - the closest ocean beaches to Canberra - 115 minutes away.
* [[Collector]] - a small historic town 30 minutes drive north of Canberra ideal for a day trip. Famous for a kidnap and murder by bushrangers.
* [[Gundaroo]] - a small historic town north of Canberrra, you can follow the range from Gundaroo through to Collector as an scenic alternative to the federal highway.  Some dirt roads involved (between Gundaroo and Collector, the road between Canberra and Gundaroo is all sealed).
* [[Bungendore]] - a small historic town 20 minutes drive from central Canberra, via Queanbeyan. It has an award winning wood gallery [http://www.bungendorewoodworks.com.au/] and associated cafe and many interesting places to eat, shop or stay.
