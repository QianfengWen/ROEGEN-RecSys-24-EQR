'''Camarillo''' is a city located in [[Ventura County]], California.

==Get in==
Camarillo is served by more and more frequent [http://www.amtrak.com/home Amtrak] and [http://www.metrolinktrains.com/ Metrolink] Commuter Rail service from San Diego, Orange County, Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley to the south and San Luis Obispo to the north. The station is located at the intersection of Lewis Road and Ventura Road at one end of Old Town. The  From here, you are not far from many eateries, a wonderful Saturday morning farmer's market and the famous Camarillo Premium Outlets. Several destinations, including the train station and the Camarillo Premium Outlets, are served by [http://www.goventura.org/?q=travel-ventura VISTA inter-city bus routes]. Most people, however, will chose to drive and that is very easy, given that Camarillo is right on the US 101 Freeway.  Camarillo Airport (CMA/KCMA) is a major general aviation hub.

==Get around==
Camarillo has the CAT (Camarillo Area Transit) bus service. The fixed routes are limited, but they have a dail-a-ride service that will pick you up and take you anywhere in the city for $2. That said, a car, or bicycle, are the only practical ways to get around.  Walking Camarillo's wide boulevards is nice if you want to experience the city that was rated number 2 in the world for weather, the clean air and numerous parks, but you won't get very far in the spread-out city.

==Drink==

Camarillo is generally a suburban bedroom community and what bar scene there is is generally dominated by locals.  Chuy's Restaurant is probably your best bet with The Clubhouse also an option.  Don't even bother with the lone nightclub in Camarillo which has gone through multiple name changes and is still unpopular with anyone over 22.
