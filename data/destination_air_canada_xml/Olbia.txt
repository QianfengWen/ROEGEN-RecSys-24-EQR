'''Olbia''' is in [[Sardinia]], [[Italy]].

==Understand==

==Get in==
Olbia is a ferry port, so you can easily get in by ferry/cruise ship, from [[Civitavecchia]] ([[Rome#By_boat|Rome's]] ferry port), [[Genova]], [[Livorno]] and [[Naples]].

===By car===
Beware the way locals drive: racing along the narrow and bendy roads in the hills.
Many companies offering car hire ex.: Avis or Only Sardinia Autonoleggio.
