'''Chongqing''' (重庆; ''Chóngqìng''), (formerly spelled '''Chungking'''), is an economically important municipality in West [[China]] and is the biggest inland municipality of the country with plans for even more massive growth. The term "Chongqing" can refer to either the city of Chongqing (urban area with a population of approximately 8,518,000) or the Chongqing municipality (much large administrative area including non-city areas and a population of over 30 million).  

Chongqing is also the launching point for scenic boat trips down the [[Along the Yangtze river|Yangtze River]] through the Three Gorges Dam. The Buddhist [[Dazu Rock Carvings]] are located three hours west of Chongqing City in the outlying Chongqing Municipality and is listed as an UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Chongqing is one of four municipalities in China. Chinese municipalities are large administrative districts that report directly to the national government but are not a province. China has 3 similar municipalities: Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin. Chongqing municipality is the largest directly controlled municipality in China. While no longer part of Sichuan province since 1997, it was historically and culturally part of it and still shares the same love for hot and spicy food dishes.

Chongqing was temporarily the capital of the Republic of China during World War II, after Nanjing was occupied by the Japanese. The capital was subsequently relocated back to Nanjing after the Japanese surrendered in 1945.

Neighbouring provinces: Hubei (east), Hunan (east), Guizhou (south), Sichuan (west), Shaanxi (north)

Located on the edge of the Yungui Plateau, and surrounded by small green capped mountains, Chongqing City is intersected by  the Jialing River and the upper reaches of the Yangtze. It contains the Daba Shan in the north, Wu Shan in the east, Wuling Shan in the southeast, and Dalou Mountain to the south.

===Climate===
Chongqing has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate with plenty of rainfall throughout the year, measuring 1.108mm on average. It is one of the least sunniest places in China, with 24% possible sunshine every year. Winters range from chilly to cold (the average January temperature is 7.9°C or 46.2°F)  with very small temperature variations, around 4°C (7°F). Nights usually feature lows around 6°C (42°F), near-freezing conditions should be expected though. Lows at or below freezing point are extremely rare, since the Siberian winds don't make it this far south and are blocked by Qin Mountains. Snow is also a very rare occurrence. The lowest temperature ever recorded is -1.8°C (28.7°F). Days usually feature highs around 10°C (50°F). There is a little amount of precipitation during these months. Summers are hot and very humid. Chongqing is actually one of the hottest and least pleasant places in China during summertime. Temperatures almost never fail to reach 30°C (86°F) and occasionally surpass 35°C (95°F). This, combined with very high humidity (74% during August, which is the hottest month) makes the heat sweltering. During heat waves highs may reach 40°C (104°F), so that the highest temperature ever recorded is 43°C (109°F). Spring and autumn are transitional seasons and inarguably the best periods throughout the year to visit Chongqing.

===By train===
There are three major train stations in Chongqing: 
* <see name="Chongqing Station" alt="Chongqing Zhan - Caiyuanba 重庆站" address="Cai Yuan Ba Li Jiao Qiao, Yuzhong" directions="Line 1 &amp; 3 Lianglukou Metro Station" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="29.549968" long="106.548337" email="" fax="">Original station closest to the centre of Chongqing. Handles many long distance trains from many destinations across China. Some services are being transferred to Chongqing North Station, due to planned redevelopment of the station.</see>

Trains arrive daily at the Chongqing station, including the daily T9/T10 express train from/to Beijing, a 25-hour ride.

If arriving from Chengdu, the T88xx express trains provide a 2 hours 30 minutes link between the two cities, there are also a large number of D trains that tale around two hours.  Either are the simplest choice of transportation for the two cities.

===By bus===
Long distance buses travel to Chongqing from many places. There are numerous buses into Chongqing, including an hourly service to and from [[Chengdu]], [[Nanchong]], and [[Xi'an]]. From the west Chengdu is 2.5 hours and to the east Wanzhou is three hours, both on good highways and good buses.

The main bus / and old rail station is Caiyuanba can be chaotic at times. Many hotels will sell rail tickets.

*'''Chaotianmen Station''', Buses to points eastward ([[Fuling]], [[Pengshui]], [[Yunyang]], etc.)
*'''Chen Jiaping Station''', Buses to the west and in particular towards [[Sichuan]].

==Get around==
The use of bicycles may not be a safe option due to the driving etiquette and custom in the city is generally poor.

First timers to Chongqing should also be warned it is easy to get lost due to the many hills and valleys found within the city.

The bus systems and monorails are advised as the best forms of transportation as they are cheap and efficient.

===By metro/monorail===

[[File:Chongqing_Rail_Transit_Map.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Chongqing Metro]]

The first part of Chongqing's new rapid transit system [http://www.cqmetro.cn/] opened as a monorail in 2005. The system was only useful for getting around in the city center, but major expansions have now linked major railway stations, major shopping districts and the airport, with more extensions under construction. Announcements are made both in Mandarin and English. No smoking is allowed and all services are airconditioned, which is a reason alone to board one from April to September! Don't forget your electronic ticket card to get out of the station. If you overshoot your stop just go to the service counter and add value to your card.

'''Line 1''' ''Chaotianmen to Daxuecheng'', east-west heavy rail metro line. Handy for visiting Ciqikou or Chaotianmen

'''Line 2''' ''Jiaochangkou to Yudong'', original monorail line. Convenient for visiting the Zoo, Yangjiaping CBD, Stilwell Museum, Flying Tigers Exhibit, Peoples Great Hall, Three Gorges Museum and Jiefangbei CBD.

'''Line 3''' ''Yudong to Jiangbei Airport'', is the monorail line running north-south. Convenient for Longtousi Long distance Bus Station, Chongqing North Railway Station, Guanyinqiao CBD, Caiyuanba Railway Station, Sigongli Long Distance Bus Station, Chongqing Garden Expo site and airport.

'''Line 5''' ''Dalongshan to The EXPO Garden Center'', newly opened rail metro line. Handy for visiting the EXPO Garden Center.

'''Line 6''' ''Beibei/Yuelai to Chayuan'', is the second heavy-rail subway, connecting four major city districts. Convenient for visiting International EXPO Center, Happy Valley, Jiangbeizui CBD and Jiefangbei CBD.

'''Line 10''' ''Liyuchi to Wangjiangzhuang'', is the metro line running north-south and connects major transportation hubs including North Railway Station and Jiangbei Int'l Airport.

===By bus===
Buses are frequent and cheap, but unless you can read Chinese you have to know where they are going and choose the right number bus going in the right direction. If you are going to one of the city centres in Chongqing, simply ask each bus if they go there. There are four city centres, so be sure you know the name of the place you want to go to. 

The four city centers in Chongqing are called '''Shapingba''' (Sandplains)(GPS 29.559900-106.457440) NW part of town and is an academic and university centre, '''Jiangbei''' (Northplace)(GPS  29.577000-106.528000), '''Nanping''' (Southernplains) (GPS  29.530531-106.561379) and '''Jiefangbei''' (GPS  29.560454-106.573400), which is one of the oldest centres and a shopping centre and near Chaotianmen harbour where there are lots of small markets and shops (often called the "fleamarkets" locally)(GPS 29.566742-106.583977).  

The bus station in Shapingba is at GPS  29.559300-106.455450. There are two bus stations in Jiefangbei, south and west of the monument. There are two bus stations in Jiangbei near the pedestrian street.

===By taxi===
Taxis in Chongqing are bright yellow small sized Suzuki sedans. They are relatively cheap, though more than similar cities due to a strong taxi union (starting at ¥10 and ¥2.0/km, ¥11 and ¥2.3/km after midnight) and can be easily found 24 hours a day. Few drivers speak anything but Mandarin, so you must know where you are going. Either have your destination written for you in Chinese, learn how to say it, or be able to direct the driver. A good way to use taxis is to gather cards from hotels, then simply show the driver the one you want to go to or is nearest to your destination.

Caution: Empty Taxis are hard to find on extremely hot days.  It is advisable to seek alternative transportation or stay indoors.  The reason is due to the fact that most Taxis have A/C running thus making more frequent stops to the natural gas station.  Added to the fact that there aren't many natural gas stations around and the pump pressure is frequently inadequate, most taxis will be stranded lining up for gas.

==See==
On the surface, the city appears rough around the edges and a bit grungy and thus there may appear to be not much to do, but further investigation will uncover a city with truly its own character and a number of interesting sites actually worth looking into.

Chongqing served as the capital of the Republic of China for seven years during the late 1930s and early 1940s during the Anti-Japanese War (World War II).  With this political history comes a number of historic sights which are worth visiting. Chongqing has the largest population in West China and is the focus of China's "Go West" strategy to help further develop the western part of China. As a result, it is a very lively and rapidly modernizing city, although it does get a bit hectic at times.

She was herself an important political figure, especially after his death. The youngest married Chiang Kai Shek. A saying about them is "One loved money, one loved power, and one loved China". Qing Ling is the one who loved China. There is an interesting  movie [http://www.hollywood.com/movies/detail/id/162638] with an English soundtrack and a book, "The Soong Dynasty" about the family.  This house wedged in between tall, ugly buildings is a nice German design (the original owner was an engineer who studied in Germany) that is not unlike many of the pre-liberation colonial architecture that can be found here and there in and around Chongqing.

The temple at the top of the hill is worth a visit. Worth a visit for a couple of hours. Unlike similar places in China, this one is still in its original state and not a reconstruction.

==Eat==
===Local food===
Chongqing is a harbor city and with this comes what is called dockside culture (matou wenhua).  This culture is blamed for a lot of things from cursing to...Hot Pot. While many great restaurants abound in the city, memorable dining is best along Nanbin Lu with incredible night views back across the Yangtze River with the city skyline lit up.

'''Jiao Chang Kou Night Market''' (较场口夜市) at the intersection of Bayi Road and Zhonghua Road. It is the largest night market in Chongqing, with about 30 to 40 stalls alongside the road. Because it attracts a lot of tourists, the prices are not cheap. But in general is okay. There is also a '''Haochi street''' (好吃街) next to Bayi road, which is also full of restaurants. Because they are right next to the Jiefangbei, they also attracta a lot of people off work. Also, on Tongkang Road (同康路), you can ask for '''Caijia Night Market''' (蔡家夜市, Cài Jiā Yè Shì). There is also the '''S. Garden Shiji Night Market''' (南方花园夜市) near KeyuanSi Road.

====Hot Pot====
'''Hot Pot''' (huǒguō, lit.: firepot) is one of Chongqing's claims to fame. In cities across China, one can find hot pot restaurants, but only Chongqing people can really stand a real hot pot, so if you want authenticity, get it while you can in Chongqing.

When ordering hot pot you have a a choice between three kinds. First, the spicy version called red soup (hong tang).  Then there is one without any spices. This is basically a bone soup, and it is tasty. To get this, simply ask for "yuan wei" or tell them "wǒ bú yào là de” （我不要辣的）which means "I don't want the spicy stuff!" Finally there is a compromise with Yuan Yang Hot Pot (Yuan Yang Huo Guo), which is basically a pot split down the middle with the spicy stuff on one side and the mild on the other. 

For those who like spicy but do not like it too spicy, it is possible to order red soup without the jolt (wei la hong tang). It is a nice mild experience.

====Suggested dishes at nicer restuarants====
* '''Twiced cooked spicy pork slices''' (huiguorou)
* '''Fish slices in sour and spicy pickled vegetable soup''' (suancaiyu)
* '''Fried pork fillet slices in sweet and sour sauce''' (tangculiji)
* '''Steamed fatty pork with preserved vegetables''' (shaobai)
* '''Fish flavoured aubergine''' (yuxiangqiezi)
* '''Onions and parsleys in spicy mustard''' (laohucai)
* '''Fish with tofu''' (doufuyu)
* '''Fish flavoured pork shreads''' (yuxiangrousi)
* '''Chinese bouilli''' (hongshaorou)
* '''Gongpao Chicken''' (gongpaojiding)
* '''Black agaric and pork slice stir-fries''' (muerroupian)
* '''Pork/beef slices in hot and spicy soup''' (shuizhuroupian) (very spicy)
* '''Numbing and spicy tofu''' (mapodoufu) (spicy)

====Suggested dishes at noodle shops====
All dishes served in the noodle shops can be either spicy flavoured or plain flavoured.
* '''Noodle with no tops''' (xiaomian) ¥3
* '''Beef noodle''' (niuroumian) ¥6
* '''Cold noodle''' (liangmian) ¥2.5
* '''Rice/soybean pudding slices''' (liangfen'r (fer)) ¥2.5
* '''Szechuan dumplings''' (hundun (T'sao sou)) ¥4

====Western food====
There are many "Western Restaurants", but it is very difficult to find any real western food in them. Many smallish restaurants will have a reasonable stab at spaghetti bolognese, and some will have menus in "Chinglish" and even pictures of dishes. However as an exception, you can find quite nice fusion dishes (ranging from Japanese Sushi and Tempura to American Sirloin Steak.

As Chongqing becomes more international and open to the world, it gets easier to find authentic international food that makes you feel like home. Restaurants run by Italian chefs are booming in recent years thanks to the Italian consulate of Chongqing. You'll certainly find good quality food with reasonable price in major shopping malls.

===Tourist center===
There are three tourist centers in the shopping pedestrian street at the Guanyinqiao metro station (Line 3). 
The one close to the station exit is near the end of the pedestrian street to the south (walk straight ahead when leaving the station through Exit 2). The map next to the information booth pin points the other two booths in the area.
The tourist center seems to be sesonal, since they were never opened when we were there (30 Mar - 8 Apr).

===Shopping===
If you're looking for IT and computer related items, go to Shiqiaopu (stop 10 on metros' red line), and exit through Exit 4, then make a right. All the buildings facing the road up to the over pass intersection sell cell phones, laptops, headphones, video cameras, compact cameras, DSLRs + lenses, printers, LCD screens, and computer related items. If you need computer parts, the building behind the last (closest to the over pass) mall is the best. They've got motherboards, CPUs, GPUs, PSUs, RAM, cases, network equipment, computer accessories (cables, mice, coolers, fans, USB cams, etc). You can even find chineese made vacuum tube amplifiers here.
In the weekends there are stalls set up between the malls and the main street, selling everything from cell phone cases to puppies.

At the metros' red line Xiaoshizi station (use the exit facing opposite the trains direction, when coming from Lianglukou, and keep walking uphill), you can find small malls selling car audio equipment, speakers (even inwall models), batteries, oscilloscopes, video surveillance equipment, projectors, PA systems, LED and other low energy lamps, smaller TVs (mostly < 33"), DVD players and portable DVD players, amplifiers, audio cables, microphones and karaoke equipment. 

Further down the road, the focus changes towards kitchen and bath, with stoves, freezers and refrigerators, kitchen fans, table and floor cooling fans, electric water heaters, taps and showers, lamps (also inwall LEDs), power switches, electrical and ethernet sockets, AC units and bug zappers, and even further down, power tools.

Exiting the Xiaoshizi station in the other direction, and making a direct right at the intersection, will take you to the shoemaker and tailor area.

Sporting goods, like table tennis rackets, badminton and tennis rackets can be found around the stadium one block away from Hilton Chongqing, on Tiyu Rd. 
The stores sell paddles/blades and rubber separately. Badminton and tennis rackets can be bought with or without strings, and you can have the strings on your 
racket replaced. There is also a store selling hiking gear like jackets, gloves, shoes and back packs. You can also buy canteens, tents, sleeping bags etc. 
Mainly goods for the three rackets sports mentioned above are sold, but they also carry equipment.

===Entry Registry===
Passengers from 53 countries enjoy 72-hour visa-free transit at Chongqing Jiangbei Int'l Airport. If you are going to stay in Mainland China for more than 72 hours, a Chinese visa IS required!

Upon arrival, foreign travelers are required to complete entry registry within 24 hours at your staying hotel or at the nearest immigration office, aka Public Security Bureau (PSB).

==Stay safe==

Given its size, Chongqing still remains relatively safe thanks to strong law enforcement. However, minor crimes like pickpocketing and scams are still happening. Use your common sense when dealing with street vendors, and avoid walking alone in back streets at night.

The summer in Chongqing can be extremely sweltering. Heat stroke is very common in July and August. Stay cool and keep hydrated all the time!

====Food====

Local food can be tricky to most westerners, as they are often oily and spicy, not to mention the hygiene problems of some street food vendors. If you have a sensitive stomach, choose where to eat wisely or better avoid street food all together.
