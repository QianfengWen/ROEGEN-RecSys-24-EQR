Dhahran completes the triangle of the Dammam Area and is accessible from both Dammam and nearby Khobar by 6-8 lane expressways. A journey can last 15 and 7 min respectively. Dhahran airport(DHA) was attached to the town, but now the new complex is about 65 km away, Dammam King Fahd Int'l Airport (DMM). Regular buses don't operate in the inner areas of Dhahran but are overlinked by Aramco. This bus service is for Aramco employees and dependents only. Dammam railway station is 18 km away. Dhahran itself lies on the Dhahran-Hofuf highway.

The easiest way to get to Khobar from King Fahd International Airport (DMM) is to take a taxi. The ride is about 15 min away. While DMM is not serviced by many international carriers, the other option is to go to nearby Bahrain and take a bus over the causeway connecting the island of Bahrain to Al Khobar (60 mins trip).
