'''Teresina''' is the capital of the State of [[Piaui]], [[Brazil]]. It is a hot, sleepy, unpretentious town. It is known as one of the hottest cities of Brazil, and is also an important center for hospitals and other health-related institutions.
Formerly called Nova Vila do Poti, Teresina replaced Oeiras as capital of Piauí in 1852. The city was named after the Brazilian Emperor's wife.

==Get around==

==See==

*Parque Potycabana. Potycabana Park is Teresina’s water wonder-world, situated in front of Teresina Shopping.

*Mercado Troca-Troca ("barter"). This is a place to exchange your kitchen sink for an old bicycle rather than buy a memento of Brazil. The market started under the vast fig tree that now stands behind the permanent roofing, on the banks of the River Parnaíba. It is fun for those who like a good rummage; the more refined may wish to give it a miss.

*Catedral de Nossa Senhora do Amparo

*Museu Histórico do Piauí. This state museum is divided into a series of exhibition rooms devoted to the history of the state; religious art; popular art; archaeology; fauna, flora and minerals; and an eclectic assortment of antique radios, projectors and other ancient wonders. Hidden in the corner of one room is a pathetic cabinet containing a flag, kerchief and some scribbled notes from comunistas, a flexible term used here to describe a group of independent thinkers, who were wiped out by the government in 1937. Admission is free, and the museum is open Tuesday to Friday from 8 to 11AM and 3 to 6PM, and on Saturday and Sunday from 8AM to noon.
 
*Palácio de Karnak. This Greco-Roman structure once functioned as the governor's residence and contained valuable works of art and antiques. In the late '80s, the outgoing governor made a quick exit, together with many of the valuable contents. 

*Parque Zoobotânico do Piauí, Rodovia PI 112, KM 5, Tel.: (86) 232-4093, Fax: (86) 222-1415. The botanical park is on the road going north from Teresina towards União.  The zoo part of the park is fifty years behind the West with bored unhappy animals (including a blind lion) in cages and insects on pins.   Happily the armadillos (tatu) are not in cages and are free to wander around the park with the visitors. Don’t swim in the lake – it is full of caimans (jacaré). The main attraction of the park is the collection of local flora.
