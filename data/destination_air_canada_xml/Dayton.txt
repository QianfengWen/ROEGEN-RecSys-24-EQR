'''Dayton''' is a city of 166,179 in [[Southwest Ohio]]. It is the center of the Dayton-Springfield-Greenville, Ohio metro area.

==Understand==
[[Image:Dayton-ohio-flyover-sculpture.jpg|thumb|'''Flyover''' is a sculpture that retraces the path of the Wright Brothers' first powered airplane flight--located in downtown Dayton.]]
Dayton is known as the ''Gem City'' and it's no wonder.  In addition to being the birthplace of aviation (the Wright brothers, Orville and Wilbur, lived here and perfected their design for the first practical aircraft), it is also home to one of the few multi-site National Parks in the U.S.- the '''Dayton Aviation Heritage Park'''. There are several things to do and see in the region; the city itself and the suburbs that surround.

===Climate===
Dayton has a humid continental climate, which means, like the rest of Ohio, sees four very distinct seasons.

;Winter : Being situated in the Midwest, winters are cold.  Snowfall isn't particulary excessive; but it can at times fall at a rate that will cause havoc with traffic.
;Spring : Often cool, with cold and mild days sprinkled throughout the period.  Storms during this period may produce tornadoes.
;Summer : Characteristically hot and humid.  While the thermometer may read one number in the summer, it will often feel hotter due to humidity.
;Autumn : Autumn in Dayton and Southwest Ohio is usually cool, but an extension of summer-like days into this season is possible. Storms seem to increase during this season too, which, due to the fluctuation of temperatures can produce extremely dangerous storms with the potential of producing tornadoes late into the year.

* <listing name="James M. Cox Dayton International Airport" alt="" address="3600 Terminal Dr" directions="Vandalia" phone="+1 937 454-8200" url="http://www.daytonairport.com/" hours="" price="" lat="" long="" email="" fax="">James M. Cox Dayton International Airport (DAY, KDAY) is in the northern part of the metropolitan area. 
Nonstop service is available from [[Atlanta]], [[Baltimore]], [[Charlotte]], [[Chicago]], [[Cleveland]], [[Dallas]], [[Denver]], [[Detroit]], [[Houston]], [[Milwaukee]], [[Minneapolis]], [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[New York City|New York]], [[Orlando]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[Washington, D.C.]] (IAD and DCA). 
Dayton is the nation's number one 90-minute air market, meaning the city can be reached in 90 minutes or less by 55 percent of the population.  A surprising and very nice feature is free wifi, which can be accessed under the name of "public" in the airport.  There is no public bus service going to the airport at this time. This makes the Dayton International Airport the second-busiest airport in the continental United States without a public transportation option. Cabs from the downtown area to the airport cost at least $30.</listing> If you want to take public transit, you can take the #43 bus. [http://www.i-riderta.org/schedules/schedule]

===By car===
*  '''Interstates 70 and 75''', major cross-country routes, meet just north of Dayton near the airport, making Dayton easily accessible by car from almost anywhere in the region.
**I-75 runs from north to south through downtown Dayton.  Dayton is less than one hour from Cincinnati and about two and a half hours from [[Toledo_(Ohio)|Toledo]] on this road.
**I-70 runs east to west across the northern part of the Dayton area.  To the west, [[Indianapolis]] is about two hours away; to the east, [[Columbus]] is about one hour away.
*  '''I-675''' is an eastern interstate by-pass for Dayton that connects with I-70 at the north end and I-75 at the south end.
*  '''U.S. 35''' is another important expressway, providing access primarily from places to the east and southeast.  The road has been improved to a limited-access freeway as far east as [[Chillicothe]], making [[Charleston]], West Virginia only 4 hours away to the south and east.

==Get around==
To get around efficiently you should travel by car. Travel in the region is easy by car and you can move from the urban city to the rural county in minutes.  The '''Greater Dayton Regional Transit Authority [http://www.greaterdaytonrta.org/]''' has several bus routes, including electric trolley buses, within Montgomery County if that's your pleasure, but in general, travel by automobile offers the best flexibility.

Dayton is also bicycle-friendly; several streets have bike lanes, and there are bikeshare stations scattered throughout, especially south of downtown.
