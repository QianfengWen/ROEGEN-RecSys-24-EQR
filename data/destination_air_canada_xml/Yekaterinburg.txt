'''Yekaterinburg''' [http://www.ekburg.ru/english_version/] ([[Russian phrasebook|Russian]]: Екатеринбу́рг ''yee-kuh-tee-reen-BOORK'') is the capital of the [[Urals]] region of [[Russia]].

==Understand==
With a population of 1.4 million people, Yekaterinburg is the 4th most populous city in Russia after [[Moscow]], [[Saint Petersburg]], and [[Novosibirsk]]. The city was founded in 1723 by the order of Peter the Great as a metallurgical factory. It was named after the wife of Peter the Great, Yekaterina. In 1918, the last czar family was imprisoned, and later executed, in a house in Yekaterinburg which was later demolished. During World War II, the city grew rapidly as industries and people moved east to escape the war. Between 1924 and 1991, the town was known as '''Sverdlovsk''' (Свердловск), named after Communist party leader Yakov Sverdlov and signs with this name still abound, particularly at the train station.

To this day, the city retains its metallurgical roots and the metal industry is the largest contributor to the economy.

The city is situated near the Ural Mountains, the border of Europe and Asia, and there are several symbolic monuments to mark the border.

==Get in==

===By plane===

'''[http://www.koltsovo.ru/en/ Koltsovo Airport]''', ({{IATA|SVX}}), +7 800 100-03-33, is 18km southeast of the city centre and serves 4.3 million passengers per year. The airport is the base of operations for [http://www.uralairlines.ru/ Ural Airlines]. There are direct flights to most major cities in Russia and there are international flights to  [[Minsk]], [[Rome]], [[Sofia]], [[Dusseldorf]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Munich]], [[Prague]], [[Barcelona]], [[Vienna]], [[Dubai]], [[Tel Aviv]], [[Istanbul]], [[Tashkent]], [[Bishkek]], [[Osh]], and [[Helsinki]].

Municipal bus #1 operates between the airport and Yekaterinburg-Sverdlovsk Railway Station through the city centre every 15 minutes, the journey takes 50-70 minutes and costs RUB28 as of June 2017. There are also small #01 express buses operating on the same route, but without any intermediate stops, the journey takes 30-40 minutes and costs RUB100. A taxi to/from the city centre should cost no more than RUB500 for the 25-minute journey, but airport taxis will ask more, so better consider using taxi services like Uber or any local services.

===By train===
[[Image:Station-Sverdlovsk-Ekaterinburg.jpg|thumb|250px|Ekaterinburg (Sverdlovsk) Station]]
{{seealso|Trans-Siberian Railway}}

All Trans-Siberian trains stop at Yekaterinburg-Sverdlovsk Railway Station. It's located almost in the city center and you can reach the center in 30 minutes on foot or in 5 minutes using the underground.

There is also an extensive network of local trains serving the [[Sverdlovsk Oblast]].

==Get around==

===Tourist information and maps===

[[Image:Yekaterinburg_Tourist_Information_Stand.jpg|thumb|right|Information stand.]]

You should either buy a street map from one of the many newsstands and shops in the train stations, print out a street map of Yekaterinburg, or pick up a free detailed street map from the [http://its.ekburg.ru/en/ Ekaterinburg Tourist Information Service] at 8 Marta St. #21, office #2, located in the city center.

Consider using a 2GIS app (search for it in App Store, Google Play and Microsoft Store), doesn't require an internet connection once installed and city info downloaded, supports the English language, has detailed city map and a directory of all the organisations (restaurants, bars, pharmacies etc.) and public transportation routes.

===By public transport===
The public transport system is very extensive and has lots of routes. The city is known for its extensible tram network, which is still being extended, unlike other Russian cities. Trams are very popular among citizens and can be quite crowded. There are also lots of buses and trolleybuses which are also very crowded during peak hours.

Yekaterinburg has 1 [http://metro-ektb.ru/ underground metro line], connecting the city south, through the city centre, to Uralmash — a large industrial and residential area, with a stop near the main railway station. The metro is popular with locals because it is quick and inexpensive. The stations are impressive, decorated with native Ural stones, granite and marble. All stations are open between 6:00 and 24:00. Train frequency on weekdays in rush hour is 4-5 minutes; all other times and weekends it is 8-15 minutes.

The metro costs RUB32 (as of February 2020) for a single ride, and RUB28 for all other public transports.  Tickets can be purchased from the special person in trams, trolleybuses, big buses and some small buses. In rare cases, in small buses, you have to buy the ticket from the driver. Underground tickets can be purchased in ticket offices  or at ticket machines at any station.

Most payments must be in cash or with the [http://www.ekarta-ek.ru/ Ekarta] transport card which will work everywhere, except some rare small buses. Ekarta has lots of plans including unlimited plans for 3, 30 and 60 days, but it's useful even with the pay-per-ride plan because the fare will be a couple rubles cheaper, than the cash one.

===By taxi===
Taxi is very cheap if ordered by a phone call or using mobile apps like Uber, Gett, Yandex.Taxi, Maxim, RuTaxi, etc. Taxi taken right on the street could be way more expensive and unpredictable. Uber is very reliable and is extremely cheap using uberSTART plan. Most of the taxi services in Russia have a fixed, known ahead pricing (even Uber). Uber rides inside the city centre (without multiplier) will cost around 100RUB, rides from the centre to other areas up to 300RUB.

===By car===
The central part of Yekaterinburg has traffic problems. However, you can drive from one side of the city to the other in 30-40 minutes if there is no traffic.

==Buy==

===Markets===

When in Yekaterinburg, make a visit to the "Chinese Market" or Bazaar. The market consists of many hundreds of small outdoor stalls, selling everything from toilet paper to fur coats, all at the best prices in the city. But this kind of market is not really the right place to buy souvenirs. Vaynera Street, in the center of the city, has a lot of shops with a wide range of small things to buy. Usually this street (it's pedestrian only) is called The Urals Arbat, after the famous Arbat in Moscow.

Leather in Russia is considered some of the best in Europe; handbags and wallets are of especially high quality. Gold jewelery, while expensive, is also very good. Markets, such as the Chinese market is good for cheap bargains.

==Get out==

* <listing name="Ganina Yama (Ганина Яма)" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">You can visit this wooden monastery semi daily by bus tours offered right in front of the main train station building. It is situated in the north direction from the city, near the village Shuvakish (Шувакиш). You can get there by train from the main station in the direction Nizhni Tagil (Нижний Тагил). When you get off the train, go to the bridge over railways and turn right (not to the station). From the bridge turn to the right again, go, go, go and after a while you will get to the asphalt road. There turn left and go some two kilometres.</listing>

[[Image:Pervouralsk_Border_Europe_Asia.jpg|thumb|right|Monument "Europe-Asia".]]
* <listing name="Europe & Asia border monument" alt="" address="" directions="Take a tour or buses 150 or 180" phone="" url="" hours="" price="RUB50 (bus 180) or RUB87 (bus 150 in 2014) one-way, or RUB300 and upwards with a tour" lat="" long="" email="" fax="">There are semi-daily tours offered from the main train station. If you can't make a tour, you can take bus 150 from the northern bus terminal (Северный Автовокзал) near metro station Uralskaya (Уральская). Buy your ticket for the 150 at ticket counter no. 13 (for Pevoural'sk) which is outside the main ticket hall. The 150 runs about every 20 minutes and takes about 40 minutes.  Ask the driver to let you get off at the '''old''' border monument. This is common practice. (On the highway the bus speeds past the new border monument which is much less impressive - look right five minutes outside the city.) When you first get off the bus, there is a small (somewhat historical-looking) stone monument that has a red brick line where the border is. To get to the main monument, follow the tarmac path up through the wood for five minutes and you will get to a tall impressive monument where the tour buses go on the big tour. This is where Czar Alexander II is said to have stopped and opened a bottle of wine in 1837. It is a spot for weddings, so usually you will find a bride or two. After you are done taking pictures, go back down the tarmac path, cross to the other side of the highway and signal a bus driver to pick you up. Buses 150 or 180 take you back, however 180 takes you only near metro station Tsirk (Цирк). If no bus driver happens to be willing to pick you up outside a bus stop (though this is common practice), you can walk into Pervoural'sk.  If you decide to walk without attempting to flag down a bus, then turn right at the big monument and walk along the small road, which joins the main road just before the town - this saves about ten minutes walking.  Bus 150 stops at the first bus stop you encounter in Pevoural'sk, to take you back to Yekaterinburg.</listing>
