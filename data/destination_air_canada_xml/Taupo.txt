===Cruising/sailing===
With a surface area of approximately 616 square kilometers, Lake Taupo is the focal point for the town and its people and to truly appreciate it you really need to head out on it. There are many hidden bays and some spectacular views to be had from on the water. Well worth a look are the large Maori rock carvings which can only be accessed by water.

The options available range from large, powered charter boats to kayaks. The Barbary, a 1926 racing yacht with an interesting history, is quite popular and a good option for a sunny day.

===Chartered & Fly Fishing===
Lake Taupo itself is widely considered to be the Rainbow Trout capitol of the world and the lake's tributaries also contain some fine Brown Trout. As a result, there are numerous charter and guiding companies which offer both lake and river fishing expeditions. The easiest way to find and book such trips is via local fishing stores and booking centres.

===Geothermal activity===
Being in the heart of the Taupo Volcanic Zone you don't have to travel far to encounter geothermal activity and there are several examples of this around Taupo, though not as heavily marketed or developed as those in nearby [[Rotorua]] they still provide a fascinating insight into the fragility of our planet.

Craters of the Moon is located a few minutes drive north of town on highway 1 and only costs $8 to visit. It provides an other worldly atmosphere and is easy to walk around.

Ten minutes north of town also on highway 1 the Wairakei steam field can be accessed by car and provides an insight into the tapping of the earths heat for power generation with this field feeding the 2nd largest geothermal power station in the world.

25 minutes north is Orakei Korako which has geysers, boiling mud pools, hot springs and large silica terraces and also the majestic Ruatapu Caves.  Entry charges apply. Tutukau Road, +64 7 378 3131, [http://www.orakeikorako.co.nz].
