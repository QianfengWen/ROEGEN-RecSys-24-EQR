==Get around==

Due to its small size (approximately 3sq. mi), it is easiest to walk or bike around Oberlin. Navigation is fairly simple as the streets run mostly east/west or north/south in a standard grid system. There are two major east/west streets (Lorain/511 and College St) which are divided by Main/58 into East/West Lorain and East/West College. North/south streets are divided by College St (ex: Pleasant St. is divided into North/South Pleasant by College St.

Downtown Oberlin is located at the corner of Main and College. The central square, Tappan Sqaure, is located across College St. from downtown and is a square block with corners at Main/College Sts., Main/Lorain Sts., N Professor/Lorain Sts., and Professor/College Sts. The Oberlin College campus is located just west of Tappan Square (the Student Union building, Wilder Hall, is located at 127 W. Lorain St).

==See==

* <see name="Oberlin College" address="" directions="" phone="" url="" hours=""> Aside from being an excellent liberal arts school, Oberlin offers a unique cultural experience in the middle of rural Ohio. The school is known for its liberal and progressive leanings, and the campus sees its share of drifters moving through, particularly within the Bohemian co-ops on campus. The school itself is very beautiful in the Spring and Summer. Oberlin College has always taken great pride in its architectural heritage, and visiting the campus is like seeing a slice of New York architecture in Ohio. Beaux-Arts architect Cass Gilbert designed many buildings on campus. World Trade Center architect Minoru Yamasaki designed the Conservatory. The campus features many Gothic and Victorian specimens as well, all well-preserved. Architecture buffs will be pleasantly surprised with Oberlin.

The Conservatory attracts lots of great musicians to the school, which also has a very active cultural life. On any given night, there are usually several attractions or events taking place anywhere in the vicinity.</see>
