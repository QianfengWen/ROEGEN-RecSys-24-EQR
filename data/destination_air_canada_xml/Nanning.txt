==Get in==

===By plane===
Nanning Wuxu International Airport serves both domestic and international flights, though the latter feature is only offered on a few destinations on a non-daily basis. Since Nanning City is China's gateway to Southeast Asian countries, the local government is putting a lot of emphasis on connecting Nanning to the capitals of every Southeast Asian country. AirAsia recently launched [http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/litee/business/article/airasia-gains-stronger-foothold-in-china-with-entry-into-nanning/] new route Kuala Lumpur-Nanning.

There are 4 airport bus lines in operate connecting the airport and the city. Bus tickets can be purchased outside the arrivals doors for 20 RMB in cash at the ticket counter. WeChat payments are accepted at the automated machines but a Chinese local ID must be tapped against the machine to purchase. Passports are not accepted if doing electronic payment.

* Airport Bus Line 1: Run directly to Vienna Hotel Nanning Chaoyang Road (Chinese: 朝阳路维也纳酒店) which is 400m away from the Nanning Railway station. Operation time: from first arriving flight to last flight of the day, frequency: half an hour, fare: 20 RMB. The buses run from the Vienna Hotel Nanning Chaoyang Road to airport every 30 min from 05:30 to 22:30. Full journey time is around 45~60 min.

* Airport Bus Line 2: Run to Wharton International Hotel near the South Lake (Nanhu, chinese: 南湖) via a downtown stop at Jiangnan Bus Terminal (Chinese: 江南客运站). Operation time: from first arriving flight to 23:00, frequency: half an hour, fare: 20 RMB. The buses run from the Wharton International Hotel to airport every 30 min from 05:30 to 21:00. Full journey time is around 50~75 min.

* Airport Bus Line 3: Run directly to Nanning Zoo (Chinese: 动物园), operation time: 09:30 - 18:30, Frequency: every hour. The buses run from the zoo to airport every hour from 08:00 to 19:00. Fare: 20 RMB. Full journey time is around 45~60 min.

There is also a public bus line no. 301 runs between the old terminal T1 and the city center, journey time is approximately 1.5 hours and costs only RMB 3. But since all airlines moved to T2 from 2015, walking from T2 to nearest stop of bus line no. 301 is more than 5KM. So please don't try this bus anymore.

Taxis are also available. Fixed price to downtown is RMB 100. A taxi from the airport to Langdong bus terminal will cost RMB 120-130, but it is still possible to bargain for RMB 100-110. The drivers might refuse to use the meter but the price is not exorbitant as it may even cost more with the meter.

===By train===
The railway station is at the northern end of Chaoyang Road at the corner of Zhonghua Road, just north of the city center.  There are trains from
* [[Beijing]] - 23-24 hours (Z trains) or 13-14 hours (G trains)
* [[Guilin]] - 2.5-7 hours (ranging from faster D trains to slower Z/T/K/no letter trains) - book a few days ahead for these trains, or take the bus. The train is quicker and more comfortable, but buses are more frequent and are likely to have seats at short notice. Tickets can be booked in advance from the station. Note that the buses also leave from the train station and arrive outside the train station in Nanning. 
* [[Guangzhou]] - 12-13 hours (K trains) or 4 hours (D trains)
* [[Kunming]] - 12-13 hours (K trains)
* [[Pingxiang]] - 13-18 hours (K trains) or 6-7 hours (G trains)
* [[Hanoi]], [[Vietnam]] - T8701 sleeper through the borders from Nanning to Gia Lam (Hanoi). This journey takes about 4 hours. Tickets to Hanoi are sold from window 16 at the train station in Nanning (January 2013). Can also buy tickets in Guilin from window 1 for 215 RMB pp soft sleeper (best to ask your hostel to write this out on paper in mandarin as very little English spoken). When you board the train your bed is allocated by the conductor who replaces your ticket with a numbered card. First border crossing in Pingxiang at about 10pm for approximately 50 minutes - everyone gets off the train and goes through customs with luggage then gets back on the train. Second border crossing around midnight Dong Dang again everyone gets off the train goes through customs and gets back on. Can change some money with women at stalls offered 2,000,000 VND for $100 or  about 490000 for 150 RMB (30/5/14). Sleep from about 1am to 5am Chinese time (4am in Vietnam). Have control over your own lights in the cabin. More people board at Pingxiang. On the trip back to Hanoi, they do not turn the lights off until you have been through both borders so only expect to get to sleep after about 2 AM, 8 hours.

===By bus===
Nanning has two major bus terminals:

* '''Langdong''' bus terminal is on Minzu Dadao (民族大道; Mínzú Dàdào) to the east of the city center amongst all the new skyscrapers.  Yunde (云德; Yúndé) [http://www.yunde.cn/] buses from [[Hanoi]] arrive at Langdong Bus Station.  Buses for Hanoi are 170元 (10/2016), which includes water, lunch at [[Pingxiang (Guangxi)|Pingxiang]] and insurance.  It is possible to opt out of insurance, which costs 2元 if you tell the ticket-seller.  This is a through-service, which will bring you all the way to Hanoi, though the station you arrive at may vary by bus or time. You will have to exit the bus at the border crossing and take all your belongings with you, but you will get back onto the same bus on the Vietnam side. Just stay with your group as you move through the immigration checkpoints.  Buses leave Langdong at 8 AM, 8:40 AM, 9 AM, and 10 AM. The journey takes 7 1/2hours. The bus will stop about every 90 minutes for lavatory break, then the border crossing, then lunch, then around the 7 1/2 hour mark you should be arriving at a bus terminal. Don't take the taxis from the bus terminal, rather go to the street and flag one down. All the drivers waiting as the bus arrives have rigged their meters to increase the fare every time they honk their horns. There are also direct buses to Nanning from [[Haiphong]] and [[Ha Long Bay]].

* '''Jiangnan''' bus terminal is on Xingguang Dadao way south of the city center. Buses from the south, Pingxiang near the Vietnam border (arrivals roughly hourly, 2.5 hrs, 60元), and [[Yangshuo]] (via [[Guilin]]) operate from Jiangnan. Bus 41 (3元, 20 minutes journey) connects Jiangnan to Chaoyang Road in the city center. Catch them from the square in front of the terminal. Alternatively, a taxi will take you to 5-10元.

*Note* Some bus routes may also end at the railway station, including those from [[Guilin]].

==Get around==
Local buses serve the city, and most are 2元 per trip. Buy a bus map of the city for about 元5 for the routes around the city, which doubles as a city map. Bus 301 also serves Wuxu International Airport, and costs 元3 for the one-hour ride to the city. It terminates in the city center.

Taxis are also convenient for getting around the city, and most rides within the city should cost under RMB 40. Fares start at RNB 9 during the day and 11 yuan at night. No extra charge for fuel.

The first metro line of Nanning: Nanning Rail Transit Line 1 started full operation on 28 Dec 2016. This 25-station line connects between Shibu and Nanning East Railway Station, crossing the city from east to west, operates from 06:30 to 22:00 every day. The fare is between RMB 3~6 based on stops.

You can get there from Chaoyang Plaza on buses 10 or 33 for ¥2. The entrance fee is ¥20 for adults, ¥10 for students (including foreign students) and free for children under 120cm. Qingxiu Shan is not really a mountain, despite its name. It is actually an enormous park with many natural and manmade attractions, including sculptures, ponds, temples, pagodas, gardens and the China-ASEAN Friendship Corridor, which contains photos and information about all the countries of South-East Asia. There is beautiful lotus pond, a cycad garden with dinosaur sculptures, a monument to the students who fought against the Japanese in the second world war, a Thai-style Buddhist temple, an ancient walkway through the forest, natural springs, and a peach flower garden. At the Heaven Lake you can buy fish food for ¥5 and feed it to the ravenous carp, or hire a paddle boat. At the top of a hill near the lake there is Longxiang Pagoda which was originally built in Ming Dynasty (although the current incarnation was built in 1985). It is 51m tall and has excellent views, but it closes at 5pm so don't leave it til last! You can easily spend a whole day wandering around the park, taking in the sights. There are numerous rest stops with food and drinks for sale. If you don't feel like walking, there are bikes for hire, or you can take ride in one of the many open-air minibuses which zip around the park, although this will cost you ¥5 per trip! </see> [http://www.chinatouradvisors.com/attractions/Nanning-Qingxiu-Mountain-894.html]

About:
ShiShan (Lion Hill) Park was founded in 1962 around the Yong Wu forest plantation. Lion Hill Park was once called ZhiQing Bamboo Park but officially opened to the public as Lion Hill Park in 1995. The park encompasses 64.5 square kilometers to the northeast of Nanning city and includes a wedge of water measuring 6.5 square kilometers. It is famous for the natural greenery, architecture and fresh air inside the park. Each year millions of visitors come to Lion Hill Park to walk along the tree and bamboo-shaded walkways and enjoy the marvellous views.

With over 30 different buildings representing South-China's architecture, ShiShan Park focuses on displaying South-China's garden architecture and bamboo art. The park is divided into six regions for tourist attractons as Hydrophilic activity area, Entertainment area, Natural Grass Area, Nature Interpretation Area, Pine-Bamboo Resting Area, Bamboo Shaded Entertainment Area. The most famous tourist sites are the Bamboo-shaded bridge, Heron Lake, Bamboo Garden, Lotus Garden, Flower Garden, Palm Garden, Red Bean Canyon.

The park is family oriented with exercise and play equipment provided free for adults and children. At different times you may see people around the park dancing, exercising, playing, flying kites, singing karaoke, practicing er-hu or violin or doing tai-chi. Paid activities generally cost between 10 and 25 yuan and include rides for the kids, playing pool, a bbq area, a rollerskating rink, a ferris wheel, a small rollercoaster and large plastic balls you can walk inside on a lake.

==Do==


==Learn==
Though older people and some young people mostly speak Baihua (白话 báihuà) which is similar to Cantonese (广东话 guǎngdōnghuà), the younger generation mainly speak Nanpu (南普 nánpǔ) which basically the same as Mandarin (普通话 pǔtōnghuà), but with different tones and vocabularies. Nanning is regarded as one of the most successful cities in China in terms of popularizing Mandarin or 'common language'. So it is a very good place to learn Putonghua for foreigners. Universities offering Chinese courses are many, including Guangxi University for Nationalities and Guangxi University. However, be aware that Nanning people, like virtually all Chinese in the south, have a non-standard pronunciation for many of the basic sounds of Mandarin (which comes from the northern Han people).

Note also that Nanning, as the capital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, embraces the Zhuang ethnic language, and virtually all public building signs in Guangxi display the Zhuang written text alongside Chinese. It is not to be confused with pinyin, the standard romanization of Mandarin.

==Work==
As a regional capital, Nanning has a lot of work opportunities compared to other cities of Guangxi Province. The booming import and export business exchanges between Guangxi and Vietnam means that there is a big demand for people who can speak both Chinese and Vietnamese. Also, if you are a native English speaker, teaching jobs are also abundant. However,if you do plan on teaching, be aware that government regulations have tightened considerably, post-Olympics, and to gain employment you must be under 60, have two years teaching experience; have a minimum Bachelors degree, and preferably, additionally, ESL/EFL certification. Although, with the demand for teachers far outstripping supply, those who don't meet these qualifications can still find teaching work (just without the comfort/legality of a working Visa).

==Buy==
*<buy name="Chao Yang Road" alt="" address="朝阳路; Chao Yang Lu" directions="" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="">The main shopping street lined with department stores, like Nanning Department Store, and Walmart, in addition other intentional brands and local brands.

'''Zhongshan Rd''' (中山路) is Nanning's food street, with a vast assortment of street stalls serving many kinds of ''Liang Guang'' (literally, the two Guang provinces, Guangxi and Guangdong) foods, as well as food from neighbouring provinces, such as Hunan and Yunnan. It is diagonally opposite the Wanda Plaza, home of Wal-Mart. Throughout the city there are many good-value restaurants. Few have English menus. The newly developed eastern end of the city (around Langdong, and the APEC Exhibition Centre) has lots of up-market restaurants, cafes and coffee lounges.

===Budget===  
There are dumpling stalls and small eating houses all over the city. Fresh, tasty and very cheap. Zhongshan Rd food stalls are also worth a try. Try the local rice noodle soup, laoyoufen (老友粉; literally old friend rice noodle). It is traditionally made with pork based broth, pickled bamboo shoots, fermented soy beans, and other typical Chinese spices. It is an acquired tasted due to the pickled bamboo shoots.

==Contact==

==Stay safe==
Chinese cities are generally speaking very safe and Nanning is no exception. But petty robberies are quite common. On buses, be extra-careful about your mobile phones and wallets.

Don't swap your phone or buy iPhone 4 offered for sale for 2000 Yuan by men from Tajikistan around the train station. On the street they offer you to inspect a real (non Chinese copy) working iPhone 4 with a SIM card in it. If you decide to buy it they probably take your money and the iPhone 4 to take the SIM card out. Thereafter you most likely will get a working Chinese iPhone which is far from the real one.
