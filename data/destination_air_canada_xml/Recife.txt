__TOC__
'''Recife''' [http://www.recife.pe.gov.br/], the capital of [[Pernambuco]], is one of the largest important cities on the northeastern coast of [[Brazil]]. This lively capital, originally founded by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] colonizers, is brimming with a vibrant culture, an interesting old town (which includes the oldest synagogue in the Americas) and some nice beaches and LOTS of sharks

==Understand==
[[File:Recife e suas pontes.jpg|thumb|300px|Recife and its bridges]]
Recife is on the Atlantic coast, at the mouth of the Capibaribe, Beberibe and Jordão Rivers, close to the eastern most point of the Americas. The climate is tropical, with two main seasons: dry (September-March) and rainy (April-August). Average annual temperature is 78.8°F, with limited variation. The city, which is only two meters above sea level (some parts are below), is distributed across rivers, canals and islands. Due to the prevalence of waterways in its geography, Recife is known as '''Veneza Brasileira (Brazilian Venice)'''. Its 1.5 million inhabitants (3.5 million in the Grande Recife) are called ''recifenses''. Services are the base of the economy. Despite the high incidence of poverty, the municipal Human Development Index (HDI) in 2000 (0.810) was above Brazil's national average (0.800). Recife is famous for its beaches, history, Carnaval, arts and cuisine. 

The city can be roughly divided in four major areas:

* The '''Centro''' (''Center'') is composed of the neighborhoods of '''Recife Antigo (Old Recife), Santo Antônio, São José, Santo Amaro''' and '''Boa Vista''', which are scattered through a couple of islands and part of the mainland.  They are connected to each other by a series of bridges over the Capibaribe River.  The Centro contains most of the historic and government buildings in the city.  The port, located in Recife Antigo, was once the most active in all of the Americas.

* '''Zona Sul''' (''South Zone'') is the most modern and touristic part of the city, as it was built around the beautiful natural reef beaches that gave the city its name (''recife'' is Portuguese for reef).  This area has a great many hotels, restaurants, and bars, as well as the airport and the largest shopping mall.  Its most important neighborhood is '''Boa Viagem''', set along the beautiful Boa Viagem beach. Because of the beach and the skyline Boa Viagem is also called the ''Copacabana of the North East''. 

* '''Zona Oeste''' (''West Zone'') is by far the greenest part of the city.  It contains remnants of the Atlantic Forest that once covered most of the Brazilian eastern coast.  It contains two famous museums (Instituto Ricardo Brennand and Museu-Oficina Francisco Brennand), as well as the Federal University of Pernambuco, and the Recife Military school (2nd best school around all Brazil).

* '''Zona Norte''' (''North Zone'') is mostly a residential area.  Throughout the centuries, the neighborhoods along the Capibaribe River were home to the local aristocracy.  It contains the city's best schools and hospitals, and is also famous for its parks and bars.

The term [[Grande Recife]] is used to describe the Metropolitan Region of Recife, the fifth largest urban agglomeration in Brazil (after Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte and Porto Alegre) and the single largest in the Northeast.  Grande Recife offers superb touristic attractions both in Recife proper and outside the city limits.  Do not miss [[Olinda]] or [[Porto de Galinhas]].  The first is famous for its natural setting, colonial architecture and carnaval, while the second has been consistently voted the best beach in Brazil.  Cabo de Santo Agostinho, [[Itamaracá]] Island and [[Igarassu]] are known for their beautiful beaches and important historical monuments.

MetroRec has three basic lines: 
* Two '''Central''' lines run together from downtown to the west, where they split after Coqueiral station and go to [[Jaboatão dos Guararapes]] and [[Camaragibe]] respectively. It does provide a useful link between the city center and the TIP Bus Station in the outskirts, at the penultimate stop on the Camaragibe (Centro 1) line. 
* A new '''South''' line provides direct access to the airport and Shopping Center Recife on its way to Cajueiro Seco.

[[File:Boa Viagem (2) - Recife - Pernambuco, Brasil.jpg|thumb|250px| Boa Viagem Beach]]
===Beaches===

Recife is known for its amazing beaches. 

*  '''Boa Viagem Beach''' - Probably one of the world's best urban beaches, with pristine white sands. With 8km of hotels and restaurants, it is the longest urbanized stretch of beach in Brazil. If you want a tan, you came to the right place. The beach road has a wide walkway attached and this is dotted with huts selling food and drink. Try the traditional "água de coco" (coconut water). The beach itself is full of vendors selling food and drink. There are also vendors selling t-shirts, hats, suncream, sunglasses. These guys can get a bit insistent.  Simply smile and one word will have them on their way: não (pronounced "now.") The beach is somewhat protected by a coral reef wall visible at low tide, there has been many shark attacks and deaths so stick your feet in the water but you might want to consider another place to swim
* '''Brasilia Teimosa Beach''' - A smaller and less frequented beach near the port.
* '''Pina Beach''' - A well-developed and popular beach north of Boa Viagem Beach. It's a little more relaxed, with weak waves.

[[File:Bolo de Rolo, doce brasileiro, típico de Pernambuco.jpg|thumb|250px|Bolo de rolo, typical Brazilian dessert, from Pernambuco state.]]
===Local specialties===
Pernambuco has a multicultural gastronomy with African and indigenous influences, among others. The national dish ''Feijoada'' (a stew of beans, pork and beef, served with rice and Farofa) is not very popular in Recife. 
On the other hand some ingredients which are widely used in Recife are hardly found in the South of Brazil, as manioc flour (which is the main ingredient of ''tapioca''), ''cuscuz'' (corn flour), pumpkin, jerked beef, goat or lamb. Seafood is exotic and delicious. The regional food has some peculiarities like ''Carne de Sol'' and ''buchada'', a dish prepared with the stomach of billy goat.
* Recife is the birthplace of two traditional and delicious cakes ''Bolo de Rolo'' and ''Bolo Sousa Leão''.
* Do try the ''snacks'' on offer from beach vendors---little chicken and beef kebabs, oysters, prawns, and grilled cheese. Just be aware that some of the vendors may have been carrying them around for hours--if it doesn't look fresh, it probably isn't.
* A must try is ''Caldinho'': a soup served all over the place (restaurants, dedicated carts and people with flasks selling it on the beach). Comes in a variety of flavors from black bean to shrimp. The person selling it will say "completa" when you order it. This simply means "complete", and if you say yes at this point you get a few added extras, such as a small boiled egg put into the cup of hot soup.

===Beach food===
Fancy sitting around all day on the beach under a beach umbrella?  Well, you can! The chairs and the guy that moves the umbrella are free. All they ask in return is that you buy your food and drink from them.

They all carry a menu and the food arrives quickly and freshly made on the beach. Try the seafood. The fish is usually caught locally and earlier that same day.

Apart from your own vendor, there will be a variety of vendors walking up and down the beach, selling a variety of things. Learning the language for these items is useful but unnecessary as the vendor will take the time to show you what he/she has on offer.
* '''Prawns''' (''Camarao'') - Be careful of the prawns-- smell them before purchase. A free sample is available with the word ''prova''.  They might have been walked up and down the beach for hours in the hot sun. A quick sniff is enough to tell you if they are fresh or not. If you decide to eat them, here is a quick tip: hold the tail of the prawn, tear off and discard the head and leg sections, hold the very tip of the tail, pop the rest in your mouth and bite off the tip leaving it in your fingers. Yes, you can eat the shell; peel it if you wish, but you will not see the locals doing this.
* '''Oysters''' (''Ostra'') - Vendors will be carrying a bucket full of ice and live oysters. They are prepared for you one at a time. Served with a squeeze of lime, salt and cumin powder. 
* '''Crab''' - They do not come prepared, so unless you know which bits to eat and which bits to discard, steer clear! 
* '''Grilled cheese''' (''Queijo de Coalho'') - No warnings here--just go ahead and enjoy.  It's a real treat.
* '''Kebabs''' (''Espetinhos'') - Grilled chicken or beef. Cooked fresh right in front of you.
* '''Ice-cream''' - The prices are a lot more expensive than just off the beach. But you don't have to get out of your chair.  In that heat, you will appreciate that.
*'''''Caldinho''''' - you will notice guys walking up and down the beach with flasks. These are full of different flavors of a soup called ''caldinho''. Try prawn one with hot pepper sauce.
*'''''Ovos de codorna''''' - Small boiled quail eggs ready to peel salt and eat.
* '''Nuts''' - A variety of nuts is available, cashew being the most obvious because it is grown right there in northeastern Brazil.  Also, peanuts in 2 varieties: roasted or boiled.

==Drink==
===Bars===
There are many many bars in Recife, most, if not all, serving food as well as drinks.  The prices are cheap, ranging from R$2.50 to R$4 for a 600 ml bottle of cerveja, a lager style beer.

There are bars of varying quality up and down the streets of Recife.  A few good picks include the following:

* <drink name="Bar Central" alt="" address="Rua Mamede Simões 144 - Boa Vista" directions="" phone="81 3222 7622" email="" fax="" url="" hours="Mon-Fri 12-2AM, Sat 8PM-2AM, Sun closed" price="">A lively and fun place more upmarket than most.

Although it may not be too pleasing to the eyes, Guaiamum Gigante serves great portions of delicious seafood for a relatively low price.  This is a nice place to go on Sundays!</drink>

At the less classy end of the market, there are some great bars. They don't have great signage to tell you that it's a bar.  Basically, if you see some plastic garden furniture in the street, you are looking at a bar.  These are usually the most fun places with the loudest people and the best vibe. Be careful of the ice in places like this as it might not be made from bottled water. It also helps to have a good constitution of you are going to eat in these bars.

*There are huts selling food, beer, and the like about every half kilometer in the center of Boa Viagem beach.

*'''Warning''': It might not be safe to walk to and from all these nightspots. Ask around, and take a cab to escape muggings.

==Stay safe==
Recife's reputation for safety is not one of the best. Robberies on streets and buses are fairly common. Do not be alarmed &mdash; odds are you will have a fabulous time here &mdash; but be aware of your surroundings and take the usual big city precautions.
*While entering or leaving Olinda at dusk or dawn, you have an elevated risk of being ambushed. Taxis are recommended.
*Beware of the unlicensed guides.  Make sure you have the travel itinerary planned out and a price (including meals, fuel, etc.) agreed upon before starting out.
*Watch out for '''shark''' warnings before entering the water at the Boa Viagem beach.
*If you are carrying notes of 50 or 100 reais, be sure to tell the taxi driver before you get in because he might not have change. Some taxi drivers might not know how to get to where you are going, so make sure that you have the address written down. If you are a woman traveling alone, sit in the back as some drivers may try to take advantage of the situation.
*Avoid Recife's downtown on Sundays. Streets are deserted all day long and are very unsafe. Consider taking a tour to a neighboring city or beach instead.

==Stay healthy==
As elsewhere in Brazil, some beaches in Recife are not suitable for bathing, and conditions can change from day to day. On the day of your visit, check the map of the latest weekly [http://www2.cprh.pe.gov.br/monitoramento-ambiental/balneabilidade/informativo-semanal/ bathing report] (in Portuguese, ''informativo de balneabilidade'') of the state's Environment Department (CPRH). There is also a mobile app called ''[http://www.cprh.pe.gov.br/deupraiape/ #deupraiaPE]'' (in Portuguese) that provides an up-to-date map of polluted bathing sites.
