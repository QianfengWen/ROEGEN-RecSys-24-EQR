Omaha is a unique city, as it has the highest number of millionaires per capita in the nation. Conversely, it also has one of the highest rates of African Americans living under the poverty line. It is still quite racially divided, with the affluent west side and Midtown being predominantly white, the south side Latino, and the northeast side African American.

Residents are universally friendly and polite, and Omaha has a well-deserved reputation for hospitality.

'''Secondary GA airports''' serving the area include Millard Airport (MLE) in West Omaha, Plattsmouth Municipal Airport (PMV) south, and Council Bluffs, Iowa Municipal Airport (CBF) across the Missouri River east.

===By train===

'''Amtrak''' [http://amtrak.com/] serves Omaha with the '''[[California Zephyr]]''' [http://amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=Amtrak/am2Route/Horizontal_Route_Page&c=am2Route&cid=1081256321209&ssid=137], which runs daily between Emeryville (in the [[Bay Area (California) |San Francisco Bay Area]]) and [[Chicago]]. It has several stops along the way, with connections throughout America.  Omaha once had a large Union Station like Chicago, but it is now retired as a museum.  The Amtrak station can be found behind the museum.

The station is within walking distance of Downtown Omaha & The Old Market. The #13 bus can be picked up from 13th & Leavenworth to access other parts of the city. (The trains usually arrive in the late evening and early morning, so double-check the bus schedule to see if it works for you. You may need to walk further into Downtown Omaha and catch a different bus)

===By bus===
*'''BurlingtonTrailways.com''', [http://burlingtontrailways.com/locations/nebraska/]. Express service to [[Chicago]]. Serves as an alternative to the now-discontinued MegaBus service.

The station is located at 16th Street & Jackson Avenue, a couple of blocks from the Greyhound station.

==Get around==

===By bus===
The Metro Area Transit [http://ometro.com] has regular bus services serving around Omaha for $1.25 ($1.50 for express routes). Buses have recently been restructured to offer more evening and weekend service. [http://www.citylab.com/cityfixer/2015/05/omaha-just-designed-a-way-better-transit-system-for-zero-cost/393620/ The top five routes now run every 15 minutes during peak hours, and nine routes operate past midnight]  Weekend service runs every 30-60 minutes, depending on the route.

===By taxi===
Taxi service is available but on a much reduced scale as compared to major cities. Taxis are always available at the airport and train and bus stations, but you are unable to hail a cab downtown; it is necessary to call and arrange for a taxi to pick you up. Rates are fixed by city ordinance and do not vary among companies.

*'''Happy Cab''', ''+1 402'' 333-TAXI [http://happycab.com/].

*'''Safeway Cab''', ''+1 402'' 342-7474 [http://theomahataxi.com].

===Bicycle===
the Omaha metro has a large and growing network of bike paths, trails, and lanes, with the centerpiece being the Bob Kerry Pedestrian Bridge. [http://www.activateomaha.org/downloads/OmahaBikeMap2010-05-05.pdf Here is a slightly out of date map of it.] Getting to sites along the riverfront or downtown is relatively easy, but remember that both Omaha and Council Bluffs are hilly cities. Precipitation can appear with little warning, so be prepared for it at any time. In addition to the community bike share system [https://heartland.bcycle.com/], a new electric bicycle rental venture launched the summer of 2016 called Quikbyke [http://quikbyke.com]. Uniquely it operates out of a repurposed shipping container powered by solar energy only. It operates from May through September and then relocates to St. Petersburg, FL for the Winter.

===Walk===
Downtown Omaha and the Council Bluffs riverside are quite walkable. It is a long walk, but you can get to downtown from the Airport on foot; follow Abbot Drive (which is well lit) south to Riverfront Drive or North 10th Street; turn left and you'll get to downtown either way. Don't take Locust or go north, especially at night.

===Parks===
[[Image:GeneLeahyMall.jpg|frame|Gene Leahy Mall]]
Many parks and recreational areas are scattered throughout Omaha.  The '''Gene Leahy Mall''' is nestled in downtown Omaha and features  walking paths through grassy knolls, slides, a sandy playground, and a horseshoe pit.  Not far from there is the '''Heartland of America Park''', which runs along the riverfront and has two fountains.  The Heartland of America fountain shoots water 300 feet into the air and has a colorful nighttime show.  There are also boat rides for a quarter per person.  '''Memorial Park'''[http://ci.omaha.ne.us/parks/Parks/memorialpark.htm], located in the '''Dundee-Happy Hollow''' area, contains a playground, a baseball field, paths, trails, and plenty of open space.  The park is unique because of its floral displays and historical monuments.   Adjacent to Memorial Park is '''Elmwood Park'''[http://ci.omaha.ne.us/parks/Parks/elmwoodpark.htm], which has an 18-hole golf course, two baseball fields, a swimming pool, and many other things.  The '''Lauritzen Gardens'''[http://omahabotanicalgardens.org/], (also known as the Omaha Botanical Gardens) have an admission fee, but it's worth the visit. The site features the Robert H. Storz Family Rose Garden, an arboretum and an herb garden with plans for a Japanese garden.

===Sports===
Omaha is home to the '''NCAA College World Series'''[http://cwsomaha.com/].  Every June, the best college baseball teams from around the nation gather for the College World Series (CWS).  The series is always a sellout event, so be sure to plan ahead. As of 2011, the CWS is held at the new TD Ameritrade Park Omaha in NoDo (North Downtown). If you can't make it to the CWS but still want to see quality baseball, take a short drive to the southern suburb of Papillion to catch an '''Omaha Storm Chasers''' [http://www.omahastormchasers.com] game at Werner Park. The Storm Chasers are the Triple-A affiliate of the Kansas City Royals, one step down from Major League Baseball.  Each September, the '''River City Roundup'''[http://rivercityroundup.org/] takes place. The event includes a festival of events, a professional rodeo, stage shows, expositions, parades, kiddie rides and more.  During hockey season, the '''Omaha Lancers''' take the ice in the 6,700 seat Mid-America Center across the Missouri River in [[Council Bluffs]]. The '''Omaha Beef''' [http://beeffootball.com/] is Omaha's indoor football team, which plays at the '''Omaha Civic Center'''.

The '''Creighton Bluejays''' [http://www.gocreighton.com], the sports teams of Creighton University, are also a big part of Omaha life. Jays men's basketball especially, played at the CenturyLink Center (formerly Qwest Center), is a big draw for students and residents alike. Creighton also has a great soccer team that plays in one of the best soccer stadiums in the country, Morrison Stadium, located right on campus.

Also, the '''Omaha Mavericks''' [http://www.omavs.com] (currently being rebranded from "UNO" and "Nebraska–Omaha"), the sports reams of the University of Nebraska at Omaha, include a hockey team that is usually a top 20 team. UNO is in the middle of upgrading its entire sports program to Division I; previously, only the hockey team was Division I.

Although the city's two biggest universities contrast greatly—Creighton is a relatively small Catholic school, and UNO is a large public institution—the sports programs have one key feature in common. Neither school has a football team. 

For a taste of subculture sports, check out the Omaha Roller Girls, Omaha's one-and-only flat track roller derby team.  [http://omaharollergirls.org/]

On April 15, 2010, the United Football League (UFL) announced that Omaha would be the latest city to host a team in the growing franchise. The team, ultimately named the '''Omaha Nighthawks''', played its inaugural 2010 season at Rosenblatt Stadium and then moved to TD Ameritrade Park Omaha.

In the last two Olympic cycles (2008 and 2012), Omaha has been home to the '''Olympic Swim Trials''' at the Century Link Center. Heats and finals usually begin the last week of the College World Series and tickets are open to the public. Omaha is currently bidding to retain the event for 2016.

The '''Taste of Omaha'''[http://tasteofomaha.info] festival is usually held between the '''Lewis & Clark Landing''' & '''Heartland of America Park''' downtown. Held in early June, this is a great way to sample food from various local vendors. There is also live music and other fun events. The '''Taste of West Omaha'''[http://tasteofwesto.com/] or '''Westfest''' is similar to Taste of Omaha, only it is held on the western edge of Omaha, 168th & Center St. In the winter months, the '''Holiday Lights Festival'''[http://holidaylightsfestival.org/] takes place in Downtown Omaha.

==Stay safe==
Omaha is generally a safe city. Simply using caution and avoiding any situation in which you are uncomfortable will basically keep you out of trouble. The vast majority of violent crime occurs in North Omaha, roughly defined as the area north of Lake St, between 24th and 72nd St. Exercise a bit of additional caution when in this area after dark. Most crime that occurs in this area is gang related. If you are not partaking in gang activity while there, you should be safe.
In general, use good common sense, and you will be able to navigate without any concern. Number streets run north-south and grow larger as you travel west. During the College World Series exercise caution with valuables in your pockets. Do not leave anything in your back pockets. Avoid paying over face value for CWS tickets around the stadium, as this unlawful. If you have any questions regarding commerce around CWS time ask a state trooper, county deputy, or Omaha police officer, they will be glad to answer your question. 

[[Image:2572956825 2594db07be b.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Storm brewing over Downtown Omaha]]

Omaha is in Tornado Alley, so severe weather can erupt at any time between the months of April and August with the main threats being hail, high winds and street flooding, but tornadoes can sometimes be a threat. Tornado alert sirens are located throughout the city. At 11 A.M. on the first Wednesday of the month, the sirens are tested. If in doubt, ask a resident. Most are friendly and more than willing to answer. Local stations KETV Channel 7 (ABC), WOWT Channel 6(NBC) and KMTV Channel 3(CBS) break into programming if a severe weather event is in progress. Radio services 1110AM and 590AM also provide severe weather coverage. Be aware that Omaha is within Douglas County in the state of Nebraska, as meteorologists often point out warnings this way.

During winter months, Omaha often sees cold temperatures as well as snow or ice events. Also, be aware that steep hills do exist within the city, and precaution should be taken during slick driving conditions.  Blizzards are possible, and the entire city normally shuts down during one.

==Get out==

Although gambling is not allowed in the state, go across the Missouri River into Iowa to visit [[Council Bluffs]] to gamble at several casinos including Harrah's, Ameristar, and Horseshoe.

Visit [[Lincoln (Nebraska)|Lincoln]] (50 miles west on I-80) to explore various museums and shopping there. Or catch a University of Nebraska football game, with a mean streak of sold out home games. 

The nearby cities of Bellevue, La Vista, Papillion and Ralston also have various shopping areas.

There are also orchards and vineyards in Nebraska City (Kimmel Orchard and Vineyard or Arbor Day Farm) about an hour drive from Omaha.
