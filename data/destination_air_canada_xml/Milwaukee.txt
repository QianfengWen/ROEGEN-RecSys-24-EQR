'''Milwaukee''' https://www.visitmilwaukee.org] is the largest city in the state of [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]]. The city's population is 594,833 with an estimated total of 1,572,245 in the Milwaukee metropolitan area (2010). It is the 31st largest city in the U.S. and is in the southeastern portion of the state on the western shore of '''Lake Michigan'''.

===History and Culture===
[[Image:Mkesky.JPG|thumb|500px|Skyline as seen from Bay View]]
Milwaukee's human history begins with American Indian people who lived near the confluence of Milwaukee's three rivers into Lake Michigan for centuries. Tribes who inhabited the area that is now Milwaukee included Menominee, Fox, Mascouten, Sauk, and Potawatomi. With the arrival of Europeans and an increasing population, large and often violent divides become more prominent. These settlers built three dueling settlements (Juneautown, Kilbourntown, and Walker's Point) around what is now Downtown. The two former communities were extremely competitive and created two non-aligning street grids. This is why 1st Street is west of the Milwaukee River and the reason that many of the city's bridges cross the river diagonally (connecting the two grids). 

Milwaukee has historically been a major immigrant city. During the early 20th Century, German and Polish immigrants tended to dominate, and the city still strongly identifies with its German and, to a slightly lesser extent, Polish heritage. For part of the early 20th century German was even the main language of the city, and German names are still very common. 

As waves of immigrants arrived in Milwaukee they tended (and tend) to form communities in specific areas. The different areas of the city are still identified with the ethnic groups that originally populated them. The Near North and Northwest sides were originally German, but are now mainly African American with Hmong enclaves. The Near South side was originally Polish but is now mainly Hispanic. Juneautown was originally mainly populated by English immigrants as well as people from the eastern United States.

The city experienced 'white flight' during the 1960's and 70's, creating a large socio-economic divide between the inner city and suburbs. Today the city remains highly segregated with low rates of social and economic mobility within the inner city.

Milwaukee is home to some instantly recognized corporations such as '''Miller Brewing''' and '''Harley Davidson'''. Harley holds an enormous celebration on every fifth anniversary during Labor Day weekend attracting riders (and celebrity riders such as Jay Leno) by the millions to Milwaukee each time. The 115th anniversary was held in 2018. 

Milwaukee was once the home to four of the world's largest breweries (Schlitz, Blatz, Pabst, and Miller), making it the number one beer producing city in the world for many years. Despite the decline in its position as the world's leading beer producer through the loss of three of those breweries, its one remaining major brewery, Miller Brewing Company is a key employer. Miller employs over 2,200 people on Milwaukee's west side. All this beer brewing has earned the city the nickname "Brew City" and its identification with and fondness for beer remains strong as ever. In 2017, Pabst (now headquartered in Los Angeles) opened a brewpub on the original Pabst campus.

Milwaukee has advertised itself as the "City of Festivals," especially emphasizing an annual summer party along the lakefront called '''Summerfest''' [https://summerfest.com]. Listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as "the largest music festival in the world", Summerfest attracts about a million visitors a year to its twelve stages. Smaller ethnic festivals throughout the summer celebrate many of Milwaukee's ethnic groups.

===Geography===
Milwaukee is in the northern Midwest, along the shores of Lake Michigan. It is approximately 90 mi (145 km) north of Chicago, and 330 mi (530 km) southeast of Minneapolis/Saint Paul.

===Film===
Milwaukee is probably best known from TV as the settings of the 1970's sitcoms "Laverne and Shirley" and "Happy Days". It has also served as the backdrop for numerous Hollywood films. The recent films Bridesmaids, Transformers 3, ''Mr. 3000'' and ''Milwaukee, Minnesota'' are both set in the area. ''Milwaukee, Minnesota'' gives a good winter portrait of the city and was largely filmed in the Bay View neighborhood.

===Climate===
Weather patterns in Milwaukee can fluctuate daily, often with little consistency in temperature or conditions. In general six months of the year are cold, overcast, and wet. Winter is very long and cold! Spring is often very wet and sometimes cold and miserable. It is not unheard of to get snowfall in April. Winter visitors may quickly get an idea why there are so many bars, bowling alleys and festivals in Milwaukee. The best time to visit is by far in the summer or the early fall during Indian Summer when the whole place comes to life and everybody is outside.

==Get in==
There is an array of almost every transportation mode thinkable to get to Milwaukee. The cheapest way is by bus, but many travelers prefer the comfort and convenience of air, boat, car, or train travel. [[Chicago]], a massive transportation hub, is less than 100 miles (161 km) away.

===By plane===
====General Mitchell International Airport====
Milwaukee is served by '''General Mitchell International Airport''' ({{IATA|MKE}}), [https://www.mitchellairport.com]. Southeast of the city.

*'''Concourse C''' Air Canada [https://www.aircanada.com], Southwest Airlines [https://www.southwest.com], United [https://www.united.com], Volaris [https://www.volaris.com]
*'''Concourse D''' Alaska Airlines [https://www.alaskaair.com], Allegiant Air [https://www.allegiantair.com], American Airlines [https://www.aa.com], Apple [http://www.applevacations.com], Funjet [https://www.funjet.com], Delta [https://www.delta.com], Frontier [https://www.flyfrontier.com]

Direct international flights are offered a few times daily from [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], and seasonally from the [[Dominican Republic]] and [[Jamaica]]. Other international travelers will have to connect or fly to Chicago and take ground transportation.

'''Ground Transportation''':
*'''Milwaukee County Transit System (MCTS) buses''' run frequent airport service from roughly 4AM to 2AM. The fare is $2.25 (exact change required). The new '''GreenLine''' express bus goes from Mitchell Airport to the North Shore via Bay View, the Third Ward, the eastern edge of Downtown and the East Side. Route '''80''' goes from Mitchell through the South Side into the the middle of Downtown and continues north to Villard Ave. (Both lines cross the main Wisconsin Ave. transit corridor, and have stops a couple blocks from the Intermodal Station.)
*'''Go Airport Shuttle''' shared taxi-van shuttle. Approximately $12 to Downtown.
*'''Taxi''' approximately $30 to downtown.
*'''Coach bus or train''' is  an alternative, but only faster if you are lucky with timing and need to go to or near the Intermodal Station. Several bus lines (Badger, Wisconsin Coach USA, Lamers) and the Amtrak Hiawatha Train go downtown en-route as part of incoming or outbound onward services. Buses (and the shuttle to the Airport Rail Station) all leave from just outside the baggage claim, if you're lucky there'll be one waiting (on average there are 1-2 per hour). $4-6.

====Alternative airports====
Chicago's main airports—'''[[O'Hare International Airport]]''' ({{IATA|ORD}}) or '''[[Chicago/Southwest Side#Get in|Midway Airport]]''' ({{IATA|MDW}})—can be cheaper or easier alternatives, especially for destinations not served from Milwaukee. There is an hourly direct shuttle from Chicago O'Hare Airport to Milwaukee Intermodal Station run by Wisconsin Coach Lines [https://www.coachusa.com/info/wisconsincoach/gc/coach.index.item1.content.asp]. $26.
It is possible take a CTA 'L' train from either of the Chicago airports to Chicago Union Station ($5) and then go on to Milwaukee with either bus or Amtrak saving time or money in some cases. With ideal timing you can make it from Midway to Downtown Milwaukee via rail in under 3 hours from landing.  However, many flights arrive at Chicago after or near the time that shuttle or rail service end for the day. Greyhound does offer late runs to Milwaukee from their Downtown depot, in case of a late arrival in Chicago, but is not for the faint of heart. Greyhound also has a few buses each day from the Cumberland CTA Blue Line station, just two stops outside of O'Hare on the CTA blue line 'L'.

===By train===
'''Amtrak''' [https://www.amtrak.com] serves downtown and an airport station. The newly remodeled Milwaukee Intermodal station offers connectivity to inter-city bus services and is located downtown a short distance from many attractions and hotels.

The '''Hiawatha''' [http://www.amtrakhiawatha.com] has 7 daily round trips to Chicago. It offers the quickest travel time to Chicago, power outlets at your seat, a quiet car, and snack & beverage service. It runs between Milwaukee Downtown Intermodal Station, stops at Milwaukee Mitchell Airport, Sturtevant(Racine) WI, Glenview IL, and arrives downtown Chicago Union Station. $23.

The '''[[Empire Builder]]''' [https://www.amtrak.com/empire-builder-train] has 1 daily round trip from Chicago through Milwaukee to Seattle/Portland, via Central Wisconsin, Minneapolis, Fargo, Spokane and many other smaller cities. The Empire Builder only stops at the Milwaukee Intermodal Station. Passengers wishing to reach Mitchell Airport must change trains to the Hiawatha at Milwaukee Intermodal Station. 'Weekly Special' Internet fares can be found for $120 to Portland and $40 from the Twin Cities.

===By car===
'''I-94''' comes in from [[Madison (Wisconsin)|Madison]] to the west, and continues to [[Chicago]] to the south. 

'''I-43''' will get you to the city from [[Green Bay]] from the north, and continues south-west to [[Rockford]].

===By ferry===
Starting service at May 1st, and ending service at November 1st, it is possible to take the ferry from Muskegon, MI to Milwaukee Harbor.
The trip takes 2 1/2 hours and takes you over majestic Lake Michigan.
The price for an adult one-way ticket is $93.50, but students, elderly and children ride at a reduced rate.

You can board the ferry in Muskegon, MI at 1918 Lakeshore Dr and you arrive in Milwaukee at 2330 S Lincoln Memorial Dr.

===By bus===
Milwaukee is served by several interstate bus lines daily, there is competition on most routes as well as onward connections. Book a few weeks ahead online for the best prices. Most buses stop at or across the street from the Milwaukee Intermodal Station (where all trains stop as well) on St Paul Street on the south edge of Downtown Milwaukee. Chartered tours of Milwaukee are also arranged from cities in the region, and there are casino charters from across the Midwest.

==Get around==
Getting around in Milwaukee is easy. Block numbers are consistent across the city, including most of the suburbs, starting roughly where the Milwaukee and Menominee rivers meet. All numbered streets run north-south, increasing in number as you head west from 1st Street. Most named streets go east-west, with the notable exception of streets east of 1st St. Standard blocks are 1/8th of a mile long north to south, and 1/16th of a mile east to west. The larger metropolitan grid numbering extends to the equivalent of 250 St. West and 275 St. North/South. (Although many of the suburbs rename their streets to something else). This grid addressing (at least in the more remote suburbs) is usually expressed as WxxxNxxxxx SomeStreetName, WxxxSxxxxx SomeStreetName, SxxxWxxxxx SomeStreetName or NxxxWxxxxx SomeStreetName (i.e. numerical grid addresses with the SomeStreetName corresponding to the second grid coordinate address). WN & WS addresses imply a north/south street (more or less, they often are curved) and SW & NW addresses imply an east/west street.

===By public transit===
====Milwaukee County Transit System (MCTS)====
Milwaukee's bus system, MCTS [http://www.ridemcts.com], has an extensive coverage area (85% of Milwaukee County) and core routes with very frequent service. Outlying suburbs have shorter hours, slower and less-frequent service. Express buses called "Freeway Flyers" provide excellent service from park and ride lots across the county to Downtown as well as to Brewers games and festivals saving you the hassle of traffic, parking and worries of drunk driving. Express buses called "UBuses" offer service to the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee Area Technical College, and other area colleges. MCTS also serves Mitchell International Airport with both a local bus and a new, more express route; see '''Get In''' for details.  Most routes run from about 5AM until at least midnight.

'''Useful routes for visitors'''
*Green line: Mentioned in the '''Get in''' section, this route travels from Mitchell Airport to Bayshore Mall in Whitefish Bay, hitting many bar/entertainment areas on the way.  Service is roughly every 20 minutes.
*30/30x:  This is likely the most popular route in Milwaukee, serving the east side, UWM, Marquette, Avenues West, Washington Park, and Sherman Park.  Service is frequent but slow.
*Gold line:  Similar to the 30/30x, but also serves the Milwaukee Regional Medical Center and the Zoo.  Service is fast and frequent.
*14: Serves Riverwest, Downtown, and Potowatomi Casino.  Service on this route is a bit less frequent.
*15: Serves Riverwest/Harambee and Bayview via Downtown.

'''Fares''' ''As of July 2018:''
* Cash: $2.25 (exact change required, MCard required for 90 minute transfer)
* M-Card or Ride MCTS app prepaid: $2.00 (90 minute transfer included)
* Day Pass: $4.00 MCard or $5 cash on the bus (MCard or Ride MCTS app required)
* 7 Day pass: $19.50
* 31 Day pass: $72
* Reduced Fare: $1.10 (Children 6-11, seniors 65+ with medicare card, passengers with disabilities.)
* Premium fares are required for travel on freeway flyer and UBus service.  Although tourists are unlikely to use these buses (they are meant for commuters), the cost is $3.50 one way/ $2.50 with an MCard.

On the bus, cash fares must be paid in exact change. If you do not have exact change, you will not have any choice but to pay extra and no refunds are available.  It is highly recommended to use an electronic form of payment.  If paying in cash, it is common courtesy to board the bus behind any electronic fare-payers, as the fareboxes can be quite slow.

Paper tickets are no longer sold as of 2015.  There are two ways to pay electronically:

*MCTS MCard.  These are RFID-enabled cards onto which fares and time-based passes can be loaded.  New cards can be purchased for $2 [https://mcardonline.ridemcts.com online, sent via snail mail] or [https://www.ridemcts.com/fares-passes/mcts-mcard/where-to-buy at various sales outlets] in the county.  Cards can be loaded online or at these sales outlets.  '''Note that if purchasing your fare online, transactions will take at least overnight to load onto your card, sometimes up to 36 hours.'''  Transactions at physical sales outlets are available immediately.  Therefore, if you need to ride the bus the same day, it is recommended to use a sales outlet or the new Ride MCTS app (see below).
* The Ride MCTS app is available for iOS and Android smartphones.  Mobile single tickets and day passes can be purchased through the app with a credit card or bank account.  After activating your ticket in the app, simply show your phone to the driver when you get on the bus.

Cash, MCard, or tickets purchased through the app include 90 minutes of free unlimited transfers.  However, if paying in cash, you will still need an MCard if you would like a free transfer, and you will need to ask the driver when boarding the bus.   No value needs to be stored on the MCard for a transfer to be loaded onto the card.

Day passes are also available for purchase on the bus.  You can either pay with MCard stored value or cash, but in either case, '''you will need to inform the driver you would like to purchase one before inserting your fare.'''

If you need any information don't hesitate to ask the bus operator for help. Most drivers are friendly, know the city well, and will be happy to give you directions or call your stop.

=====Tourist "Trolley"=====
Trolley Loop [http://www.ridemcts.com/seasonal_services/index.asp?id=838] is a frequent scheduled tour bus loop (themed as a trolley) sponsored by local businesses. Rides are free though service is seasonal.

====Regional Services====
*'''Ozaukee County''' is served by the Ozaukee County Express from Downtown Milwaukee (some service also to Milwaukee's South Side) via the I-43 corridor. Ozaukee County Transit [http://www.ozaukeetransit.com] also offers shared-ride taxi services. 
*'''Washington County Commuter Express''' (WCCE) [http://www.ridewcce.com/]
*'''Wisconsin Coach Lines''' [http://www.coachusa.com/wisconsincoach/] offer service from Racine and Kenosha in the south to Downtown Milwaukee, and from Waukesha and Mukwonago in the west to Downtown Milwaukee and to the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

===By bicycle===
Milwaukee was awarded bronze status from the League of American Bicyclists in 2004 and again in 2009. A bike map is available from the city  [http://www.ci.mil.wi.us/maps4460.htm] or for sale at local shops. Weather permitting, Milwaukee is a very pleasant place to bicycle. There are several separated bike lanes and network of leisurely trails called the Oak Leaf Trail.  Some are even limited access paths (think: bike freeway) as well as 65 mi (105 km) of on-street bike lanes and 75 mi (121 km) of signed bike routes (the city  aims to raise that number to several hundred miles of on-street bike lanes as streets are re-paved).

'''Bicycle Rentals and Tours'''
*Milwaukee Bike and Skate Rental [http://www.milwbikeskaterental.com/] a kiosk in Veterans Park on the Lake Michigan shore, just north of the art museum.
*Brew City Bike Tours [http://www.brewcitybiketours.com/] offer rental as well as tours including Pub Spin, Bite 'n Bike and History 101.
*POWWOW [http://www.wisconsinbicycletours.com/] offer tours across the state.
*Cream City Rickshaw [http://www.creamcityrickshaw.com/] will take you anywhere.
*Bublr bikes are now available in many areas of Milwaukee as well as in the suburbs of West Allis, Shorewood, and Wauwatosa. You can rent them from the stalls at the locations in Downtown Milwaukee. Fees go for 4 Dollars per 30 minutes, up to 80 dollars for a pass.  To save money, you can buy a "pay as you go" pass online in advance, which costs $2 upfront but allows you to check out bikes for $2 per 30 mins, presuming you use the same credit card. Pick them up and put them back at any location. More info [http://bublrbikes.com/]

'''Bicycle Shops''' are also often willing to do rentals, and also sell high-quality products that are often locally made:
*Ben's Cycle / Milwaukee Bicycle Company [http://www.benscycle.net/] sells top-notch locally made bicycles and has the best selection of track and '''fixed gear''' equipment in the Midwest.
*Milwaukee Bicycle Collective [http://bikecollective.org/] is useful if you need a space and some tools to fix your bike while traveling, they have assorted hours and suggested donation rates.
It is fairly easy to find a used bike in good working condition at local thrift stores, which is much cheaper than renting if you are going to be staying in the city for any length of time.

All MCTS buses have bicycle racks which are free to use with bus fare, so if you get tired, lost, the weather turns bad or whatever you can hop on the bus.

===By taxi===
While there are plenty of taxis to meet demand, do not expect to simply flag one down. With the notable exceptions of queues at larger hotels, the airport, train- and bus stations, largely attended events and most of the downtown area, you should call for one. Even going from the Upper East Side to Downtown can cost $20. The number one company is Yellow Cab (''+1 414'' 271-1800), with phone numbers of other taxi companies available here: [http://milwaukee.about.com/cs/gettingaround/a/taxiinfo.htm].

In the warmer (and occasionally the colder) months there are alternative ways of getting point to point.
*'''Horse-drawn carriages '''[http://www.milwaukeecarriage.com/] are available downtown and sometimes on the East Side, and often outside public events.
*'''Cream City Rickshaw''' [http://www.creamcityrickshaw.com/] available for private events, bike-taxi services.
*'''Water Taxi''' [http://www.watertaximilwaukee.com] service may be suspended.

===By car===
While it is possible to use the bus to go to many suburbs, some tourists prefer driving. Parking outside the Downtown/East Side is overall a non-issue. Traffic conditions vary.

'''Parking''' Downtown and in some business districts (on the East Side, in some suburbs) costs money. Keep an eye out for electronic meters: there will be a number on a post at each space, and you need it to pay at a machine down the block (cards accepted). Visitors parking overnight on city streets should call the City at ''+1 414'' 286-8300 by 1AM to request parking permission. Overnight parking can also be registered for free (up to 3 nights) online at [http://www.mpw.net/services/np_permission the DPW's night parking site].

In the end, even the original ornamental bronze railings, lighting fixtures, and doorknobs of the customs house were used for furnishings. Opulently decorated and designed, it is perhaps one of the finest examples of the so called "Polish Cathedral" style of church architecture in North America.</see>

===Breweries===
{{infobox|Prohibition and Al Capone|The Brew City was hit hard by prohibition, a huge section of the local economy was shut down and thirsty Milwaukeans couldn't drink their sorrows away. In the 1920s Chicago gangster activity came north to Milwaukee during the Prohibition era.

Breweries are integral to Milwaukee's image. Although the number of large scale operations has dwindled in the last decade, the nickname "the Brew City" still rings true, and microbreweries are booming.  In several spots around the city, the smell of yeast from the beer factories is quite strong.  Milwaukee was once the home to four of the world's largest breweries: Schlitz, Blatz, Pabst, and Miller.

===Sports===
[[Image:Miller Park.JPG|thumb|250px|American Family Field, home of the Milwaukee Brewers]]
Milwaukee has memorable moments in sports history, with the Brewers and Bucks most likely to interest travelers. Home run slugger Hank Aaron hit most of his home runs in Milwaukee (mostly as a member of the Braves, who have since moved to Atlanta, though he finished his career with the Brewers).  Additionally, the Bucks are the youngest team to ever win an NBA title.

*'''Milwaukee Brewers''' - Milwaukee's MLB franchise, plays at American Family Field just outside downtown.  The Brewers were formerly owned by Bud Selig, former commissioner of MLB. [http://milwaukee.brewers.mlb.com]  
*'''Milwaukee Bucks''' - NBA member, with games at the Fiserv Forum. [http://www.nba.com/bucks].

The track is located at the grounds for the Wisconsin State Fair. The track has held events sanctioned by major sanctioning bodies, such as the American Automobile Association, USAC, CART/Champ Car World Series, NASCAR, and the IndyCar Series. There have also been many races in regional series such as ARTGO.
*'''College basketball''' - The city has two NCAA Division I college basketball teams—the Marquette Golden Eagles [http://gomarquette.com] of the Big East Conference, and the Milwaukee Panthers [http://uwmpanthers.com] of the Horizon League. Marquette's men's team plays at the BMO Harris Bradley Center, while Milwaukee's men play at U.S. Cellular Arena (the women's teams of both schools play on their respective campuses).

===Neighborhood visits===

*'''Downtown''' - Downtown Milwaukee consists of two neighborhoods which sit across the Milwaukee River from each other.  

Juneautown, between the lake and the river, is the financial heart of the city, as well as the place where Milwaukee was born.  The city's tallest building, the 601-foot USBank Tower, is located here along the lake, as are a number of the other architecturally significant buildings, including the Cathedral of St. John and Milwaukee's City Hall.  There are a number of coffee shops and restaurants, but except for around Cathedral Square and Milwaukee Street area mostly closes down after business hours.  

Across the river, Kilbourntown (or Westown) serves as the city's entertainment center.  Here you will find attractions such as the Wisconsin Center, Milwaukee's primary convention center.  Nearby are the Grand Avenue Mall, the Milwaukee Theater, and the Bradley Center.  Many of the city's hotels are located here as well, as are a number of excellent restaurants and clubs. Further to the west is Milwaukee's gigantic neo-classical Courthouse, the Milwaukee Public Museum, and the ornate Milwaukee Central Library. While none of the city's tall buildings have public observatories, you can get a fantastic view from Polaris [http://milwaukee.hyatt.com/hyatt/hotels/entertainment/restaurants/index.jsp/], the revolving restaurant perched atop the Hyatt Regency in the heart of Kilbourntown.  

The Riverwalk lines both sides of the Milwaukee River through the downtown area, and is home to a number of pieces of public art, as well as some of the city's most popular restaurants.

*'''Historic Third Ward''' - This small district, located directly to the south of Juneautown, is Milwaukee's version of the trendy urban "warehouse district."  The streets of the Third Ward are lined with 19th and early 20th-century warehouse buildings which have been converted into lofts and offices.  At street level, chic shops and restaurants are commonplace.  The area is also an entertainment hub.  The Eisner Museum of Advertising and Design [http://www.theeisner.com/] is located at 208 N Water St, just blocks from the Broadway Theater Center, home of the Skylight Opera [http://www.skylightopera.com/].  On the ward's southern boundary -the Milwaukee River - one can find the Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design (or just MIAD [http://www.miad.edu/enter.php/]), which is the centerpiece of the city's art scene.  On Gallery Night, which occurs once every three months, the Third Ward hums with activity, as it is home to the city's largest collection of art galleries.  The Third Ward is also home to the newest section of the Riverwalk, which offers some fantastic views of the downtown skyline. The Third Ward is within walking distance of downtown. 

*'''Fifth Ward/Walker's Point''' Founded by George Walker in June of 1835 as a fur trading post, Walker's settlement was combined with Juneautown and Kilbourntown to become the City of Milwaukee in 1846. Walker also contributed to the building of the city's first streetcar line in 1859. Walker's Point is located just south of the Third Ward, and is served by the #18, 15, and 19 buses from Downtown. The northern part of the neighborhood (especially north of National Avenue) is a rapidly re-developing warehouse district, home to many popular restaurants, cafes, clubs, and bars, while the southern and western parts are mainly Hispanic. The neighborhood is also the center of Milwaukee's gay scene. 

*'''Avenues West/Marquette''' is the neighborhood immediately west of Downtown. Home to Marquette University, the area has a large student population, and consists mainly of mid-rise apartments and walk-ups as well as many of the city's social services institutions. The neighboorhood is relatively seedy the further away you get from the university, although its not particularily dangerous. The Pabst Mansion and Rave/Eagle's Ballroom (music venue) are both located in the neighborhood along Wisconsin Avenue. 

*'''Martin Luther King Drive''' - A period of urban renewal has revitalized this neighborhood with brand new restaurants, coffee houses and jazz, blues and neo-soul lounges.  It is known as the epicenter of African-American commerce in Wisconsin.  From downtown, simply continue north on Old World 3rd Street which turns into Martin Luther King Drive.  The #19 bus runs the entire lenght of the street.

*'''The East Side''' [http://www.theeastside.org/]. This neighborhood stretches from downtown to the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee. Sandwiched between the Milwaukee River and Lake Michigan, it is home to hih-rises, elegant mansions, college students, and everything in between. The areas around Brady Street and North Avenue are particularily lively, with many different local shops, restaurants and bars. The number 30 bus runs from Downtown down Farwell/Prospect every few minutes during the day, and the #15 runs down Water, Brady, and Oakland. At Brady, Ogden, and Lafayette there are steps down to the parks and beaches along the lake. 

*'''Riverwest''' - An older working class neighborhood bordered by the Milwaukee River or the south and east and Holton Street on the west. Riverwest is one of the most racially integrated in the city. As the East Side and Downtown have gentrified, Riverwest has become an increasingly diverse neighborhood, and is also home to much of the hipster and alternative scenes in Milwaukee. Amongst the many hipsters, one still find plenty of Puerto Rican families and grandmothers. Center Street and Clarke Street are the main commercial ares of the neighborhood. The buses 10 (Humboldt Ave) and 14 (Holton St) stop at both streets on their way north from Downtown.

*'''Bay View''' - An historic and vibrant middle-class neighborhood settled along Lake Michigan on Milwaukee's southeast side. Kinnickinnic Avenue is the neighborhood's main street, curving through the heart of Bay View, and is lined with shops, bars, restaurants, and cafes. A reflection of its early history, Bay View is very dense with neighborhood bars and restaurants, seldom separated by more than a few blocks. Bay View's South Shore Park also offers the best view of Milwaukee's skyline, as well as some of the city's most scenic lakefront. The 15 bus runs southbound from downtown to Bay View, as does the GreenLine, which also runs through Bay View from General Mitchell International Airport.

*'''Historic Mitchell Street''' - This once Polish center is now home to some of Milwaukee's most vibrant Hispanic culture. The busiest area of the street is between 6th and 13th Streets. The #54 bus runs down Mitchell, and the 80, 19, and 14 connect the neighborhood to Downtown.

===Parks===
Milwaukee has one of the best public parks systems in the country. The area of parkland and beaches along the lake is the crown jewel of the system, and gets very busy during good weather. 

*'''Cathedral Square Park''' - This park is a square in the center of the city, bordered by Kilbourn on the North, Wells on the South, Jackson on the the East and Jefferson on the West.  It is most notable for Jazz In the Park, free outdoor Jazz concerts on Thursday evenings during the summer [http://www.easttown.com/info/Jazz%20in%20the%20Park/jipindex].

*'''Veteran's Park''' - This park is located by the lakefront, just north of the Art Museum and War Memorial.  Veteran's Park includes a lagoon where you can rent a paddle boat, a kite store, and bike rentals.

*'''McKinley Marina and Beach''' - McKinley Park is a great place for people who want to fish or relax on the beach.  Many people also love to stroll out on the giant breakwater that goes out into Lake Michigan.  During the summer, there are plenty of fishermen here as well.

{{infobox|Alternative Economies|The Cream City had a socialist city governement for several decades, the only city in the United States to have had this political leaning. The city has a strong labor union network, organized due to poor treatment of the massive amount of industry workers. Today, unions remain very controversial and are constantly given as a reason businesses outsource or move production out of state. Recently collectivism has gained some new steam. Collectives include the artists of Borg Ward, designers at Sparrow Collective, Brewing Grounds for Change Coffee, as well as several food-coops like the Riverwest Coop.}}

===Nightlife===
There's no shortage of night life in the Brew City.  Milwaukeeans spend more (per capita) on entertainment than the citizenry of any other major American city, and you can bet that a good percentage of that entertainment is served in liquid form. Despite the amount of money spent on it, drinking is still very cheap. Expect to pay $4 for a decent local beer or import, $2 for a Pabst, Hamm's, Old Style or Schlitz. Read the specials boards, there are often great deals, for instance, a pint of a dark local micro-brew for $2 several places on Thursday and many places have $1 PBR or Old Style. '''Cover''' is only charged at some places with live music, bigger clubs, or if there is a special very cheap drink night. Every bar can serve you mixed drinks, but wine is less popular. '''Closing time''' is an early 2AM during the week and 2:30AM on Friday and Saturday. All retail alcohol sales stop at 9PM.

With 957 licensed taverns its hard to go thirsty. There is a corner bar at least every few blocks, no matter where you are in Milwaukee. Plus there are several handfulls of licensed ''dance halls'' (what kids call clubs and venues these days), if you want to get your groove on. Other popular nighttime activities include bowling (black-light bowling at midnight), movies, concerts, and theater.

Many of the main places to go out in Milwaukee are concentrated in a few different areas, which are easy to walk around and bar-hop within. Cabs are also easy to hail Downtown and on the East Side. 

'''Downtown''' the biggest bar street is Water St with a heavy drinking scene. Across the river to the west is Old World 3rd St with some German-inspired taverns and sports bars (it's near the Bradley Center arena). Back across the river and up the hill to the east is Milwaukee Street, hosting a wide range of classier, more upscale small bars.

The '''East Side''' has two of the city's main bar areas: on Brady Street and on North Ave between Oakland and Prospect. 

Brady Street is full of people outside during the summer and has a mix of different bars, cafes, and restaurants.

'''Riverwest''' houses several bars and venues reaching across the neighborhood. Its a mix of DIYers, hippies, and hipsters. A great place to easily experience the Milwaukee neighborhood atmosphere.
* <drink name="Art Bar" alt="" address="722 E Burleigh" directions="" phone="" email="" fax="" hours="from 3PM, Sa-Su from 10AM" price="$2+ beers, $5 cocktails" url="http://artbar-riverwest.com/"> Happening local bar that attracts varied crowds.

* <drink name="The Polish Falcon" alt="" address="801 E Clarke" directions="" phone="" email="" fax="" hours="" price="$2 beers" url=""> A legendary law-less little bowling alley and bar. Its real old Milwaukee.</drink>

The '''Third Ward''' has a number of places in old warehouses right on the river, several blocks south on Water Street from the main bar area, as well as on Broadway one block east. Places here tend to be a little more upscale and draw a yuppie/ middle aged clientele. 

* <drink name="Milwaukee Ale House" alt="" address="233 N Water St" directions="" phone="(414) 276-2337" email="" fax="" hours="11AM-close" price="" url=""> Milwaukee Brewing Company's brew pub serves their own selection of self-brewed beers.

It's the neighborhood bar for art students buying $2 PBR, but also a common destination for yuppies. Lively bar on any night, and a busy patio in back -- weather permitting. </drink>

The '''Fifth Ward/ Walker's Point''', just across the river and a few more blocks south, is the hub of gay nightlife but has some straight bars and Latin-themed places too. There are a number of places, mainly along S 2nd St and National Ave. There are also a few places south of the Allen Bradley Plant (with the huge clocktower) on 2nd and 1st Streets.

* <drink name="La Cage" alt="" address="801 S 2nd" directions="" phone="" email="" fax="" hours="from 10PM" price="" url=""> Milwaukee's largest gay club. Multiple floors.</drink>
* '''Walker's Pint''', 818 S. 2nd St. has a primarily lesbian clientele

'''Bay View''' to the South has many bars scattered throughout the neighborhood. Kinnickinnic Ave is lined with bars between Bay and the Lake Parkway, and there's another cluster near the lake at Russell and Superior. There are lots of really old-school places here. If you're not staying here and are drinking, plan how to get back, as the last buses run at 2AM and taxis are expensive if you are going further than Downtown.

* <drink name="Palomino Bar" alt="" address="2491 S Superior" directions="" phone="" email="" fax="" hours="" price="" url=""> Great Bay View hipster retro corner bar hangout. Serves great fried vegan food.</drink>

==Sleep==
Visitors to Milwaukee find it easiest to stay in or near downtown, where most of the city's hotels are located. Milwaukee does have one hostel that recently opened along with an array of hotels to meet most budgets. There is a small '''bed and breakfast''' district on the Westside.

Cheap hotels can be found on the Near South Side as well as as the North Side, the quality of these tends to reflect the average quality of life in the areas these are in, hence may not be up to the standards of relatively affluent travelers.

More generic cheaper hotels are located outside the urban city. For instance, there is a strip of budget hotels on College Ave near Mitchell International Airport. Near most interstates you can also find chain hotels.

==Stay safe==
Milwaukee has a high crime rate when compared to the national average. But, since most of the crime is concentrated in specific poorer neighborhoods away from popular tourist spots, majority of the city is perfectly safe for the average visitor. Still, common sense should always apply when traveling throughout. The areas along the lakefront and downtown tend to be the safest and is where most of the city’s tourist attractions are. Like anywhere, it helps to be aware of your surroundings and as with many U.S. cities, dangerous neighborhoods tend to be very run down.

The north side is by far the most dangerous part of Milwaukee. The areas west of Holton Street contains some of the poorest parts of the city and are on par with the worst areas of Chicago. The south side neighborhoods north of Cleveland Avenue has its share of crime amongst various Hispanic gangs but is fine during the day, especially along the main commercial streets. It is likely that when asking someone for help in this area you may not get an answer because some of the residents don’t speak English. The area immediately west of Marquette University is also a bit sketchy. As a general rule, if buildings are boarded up, have bars over its windows, or are abandoned, there is a good chance you are in a bad neighborhood. It is usually okay to walk in or shop at these areas during the day, but at night it should most definitely be avoided.

The Milwaukee metro Area has seen a spike in carjackings in recent years, so please be vigilant.

If you are the victim of a crime, notify the Milwaukee Police Department immediately either by visiting your nearest police station, or by dialing 911. If it is a non-emergency case, the MPD can be reached by calling 414-933-4444.

==Cope==
Also, the suburbs of Ozaukee, Waukesha, and Racine Counties have a reputation for being politically and socially conservative. It's your best bet just to go with the flow here. If you are an LGBT visitor, displays of affection will turn heads in these areas. Some suburbs are even more conservative than the rural parts of the state! Milwaukee is not as socially liberal as [[Madison (Wisconsin)|Madison]], although people in Milwaukee are overall tolerant of each other, even if many of the assorted social and ethnic groups tend to avoid each other.  Clique culture is big in the region and many people grew up together so don't be surprised to get an unfriendly reception from some people you meet being an outsider.  Dressing in a non-conservative manner here (keeping up with fashion trends, v-necks, high fashion, etc.) is generally frowned upon in southeast Wisconsin and will get you some funny looks from locals so if this kind of attention bothers you then pack accordingly.  The city is becoming more and more laid back.
