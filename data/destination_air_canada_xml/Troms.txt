==Understand==

==Talk==

Norwegian is the official language of Norway and it is the most commonly spoken language in Troms. Norwegian is mutually intelligible with Danish and Swedish. 

Sami is official in one municipality, [[Kåfjord]].

Most people speak English well. In theory, all Norwegians are also able to speak a third language, usually German or French (but also Spanish, Italian or Russian), as learning a third language is mandatory in the Norwegian school. However, most people's knowledge of their third "school language" is basic at best.

===By car===

E6 is the main route to Troms when driving from the southern parts of Norway (Oslo, Trondheim). Be aware of the long distances. From Oslo to the southern border of Troms it is appr. 1400 kilometers, and to the northern border appr. 1820 kilometers.

It is also possible to drive to Troms from Finland via European Route E8 from [[Tornio]] through the Torne Valley. E10 from [[Kiruna]] and [[Luleå]] in Sweden enters Norway just north of [[Narvik]] in [[Nordland]] county. The distance from the national border to Troms county border is appr. 50 kilometers.

If you arrive during winter, be aware that winter tires are necessary and required by law. Do not try to drive without, even if you don't expect snow or ice.

===By train===
There is no railroad in Troms. The closest station is in [[Narvik]] just south of the county border. From Narvik there are buses to Harstad, Finnsnes, Tromsø and other towns in Troms. Narvik is the end station of the Swedish Malmbanan ("the ore rail"). Passenger trains are operated by [http://www.veoliatransport.se/ Veolia Transport]. Narvik is not connected to the main norwegian railroad network.

===By bus===
===By boat===

==Get around==

Getting around in Troms is easiest if you have your own car. There are reasonably good roads all over the county. The main road network is mostly of quite good standard. Some roads are narrow and windy, this is especially true when it comes to local roads. Traffic levels are low, except in and around the largest towns.

If you do not have a car, bus might be a good option, maybe even the only option. Most communities in the county can be reached by bus. There are regular bus connections between the larger towns, normally several buses each day. There are also regular connections to [[Alta]] in Finnmark county and [[Narvik]] in Nordland county. When it comes to smaller communities there might be a very limited service, maybe just a few buses during the week. It's important to plan ahead and check the timetables!

Many coastal communities can be reached by catamaran from the nearest town; Harstad, Finnsnes, Tromsø or Skjervøy. There are also catamaran routes between these towns. Hurtigruten travels most of the Norwegian coast and also calls at these four ports.

Air travel is possible between Tromsø and Harstad (Evenes airport), and between Tromsø and Storslett (Sørkjosen airport). If you book your ticket well in advance this is likely to be the cheapest (and fastest) way of travelling between these places.

Timetables for most city- local- and regional buses, catamarans and ferries in Troms county can be found at [http://177troms.no/ 177troms.no]. Unfortunately this page is in Norwegian only. Look for "Rutetabeller".
