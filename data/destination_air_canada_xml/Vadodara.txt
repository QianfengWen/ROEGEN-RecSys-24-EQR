'''Vadodara''', a town in [[Gujarat]] in [[India]], also known as '''Baroda''', is named for the Vad (banyan) trees that flourish in the area. 

==Understand==

The language spoken by people in Vadodara varies, but almost everyone speaks Gujarati and Hindi. Marathi community is also on a large scale in the city. Most young people speak passable English, and in certain areas you will meet people that are fluent in English. Alkapuri is heavily frequented by NRI's (non-resident Indians) and has western restaurants (Pizza Hut, McDonald's, Subway, CCD, Barista, Barbeque Nation etc.), stores (Adidas, Nike, Metro, etc.), etc. This area is frequented by highly affluent individuals and you can generally find English speaking people on a large scale.

Recently the city has been attracting many International IT Companies to invest in the area to set up operational hubs, including L&T, Collabera, and TCS. Many people from IT centers in India like Bangalore prefer working here because of the simple life, but with all resources like schools, water and electricity.

==Drink==

It is a nice place to be but lacks a nightlife altogether because of a '''blanket ban on alcohol''' that coats Gujarat. Foreign nationals can procure alcohol after getting a permit, but this procedure is not without its headaches.

You will need your passport plus a photocopy of your passport data page and your visa.  You must ask your hotel to stamp this photocopy and write a simple statement to say that "xxx is residing at this hotel room xxx. 
The fee for the permit is 100 Rs.  The permit is valid for one month during which time each person is allowed to buy a limited quantity - 10 units at a time (one unit is 10 large bottles of beer, or 3 bottles of wine or 1 bottle of spirits), no more than twice in six days.  This should satisfy all but the heaviest of drinkers.  
You can use the permit at any location that sells alcohol.

The wine shop at the Hotel Kaviraj (the hotel is currently being refurbished but the wine shop is open on the side of the building) is open from 12.00 to 20.00 hrs and can always issue a permit.

==Sleep==
{{style|[[Listings|wrong format and incomplete listings]]}}
Accommodation can be a problem for foreigners in Vadodara, with the majority of hotels and lodges refusing customers who are clearly non-Indian or lack Indian proof of identity. This concerns a requirement for the lodges to obtain and submit various forms to the local police, and appears to be strictly enforced. The cheapest rooms available to non Indians (in the popular region near the railway station) are typically around 1200, with a handful at around 950.

===Budget===
Choose any of the hotels available besides the railway station. This option is not available to foreigners as of Jan 2013, see above.
