[http://www.gotobelfast.com/'''Belfast'''] ([[:wikipedia:Irish language|Irish:]] ''Béal Feirste'', Béal meaning "mouth" and Feirste meaning "sandbank") is the capital and largest city of [[Northern Ireland]], [[United Kingdom]] and the second largest city on the island of Ireland after [[Dublin]], the capital of the neighbouring [[Republic of Ireland]]. Situated at the mouth of the River Lagan on Belfast Lough, Belfast is surrounded by low hills and has a population of 267,500. This figure refers only to the Belfast City Council area whose borders date back to the 1950s. Since then the city has expanded and the population of the Belfast Metropolitan Urban Area which incorporates the surrounding suburbs and towns is 483,000.

Belfast gained notoriety around the world during '''The Troubles''' (1969-1997) due to the frequency of gun and bomb attacks in the city. Parts of Belfast were effectively no-go areas for security forces and therefore took on a lawless quality. Today, the scars of Belfast's troubled past make it an intriguing destination for travellers from around the world. 

Since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, most of the politically-motivated violence has evaporated. Belfast was recently awarded the accolade of being the safest city in the UK, based on a comparison of nation-wide crime figures, and, as part of its commitment to maintain peace, now seeks tourism from all around the world, especially from countries other than the Irish Republic and the rest of the UK.

Those who live in Belfast tend to either absolutely love the city or loathe it, although the outsider's perspective tends to be more forgiving, as Belfast was voted the fourth best city in the UK for a city break in the Guardian/Observer travel awards. Needless to say, a visit to Belfast will be rewarded by a glimpse of a unique city that has finally begun to celebrate, rather than fight over, its place as a cultural meeting-point of Britain and Ireland. Belfast is certainly exhibiting an air of determined optimism, with new hotels, bars, restaurants, clubs and shops opening at an incredible rate. It is a city that is proud of its Victorian and Edwardian heritage and efforts to restore historic buildings are proving successful. Tourism is on the increase in Northern Ireland, especially among those seeking a weekend away or short break in Ireland as Belfast can offer a significantly cheaper and more rewarding alternative to the bigger, busier, more expensive and more tourist-driven [[Dublin]].

Belfast remains a great place to explore, as it is still relatively undiscovered compared with its neighbour in Dublin and is ideal for the tourist who enjoys a city with character, yet still has a raw, unspoilt energy. A visit to the capital of Northern Ireland will provide a more stimulating trip as, once you scratch the surface, it is easy to see beyond the ethno-political conflict of past years. It is a city which has changed dramatically in a decade due to this peace and prosperity and you will be greeted with warmth from locals who feel a new-found sense of pride in their city. Indeed, the old cliché that you will be welcomed like an old friend by the patrons of Belfast's many pubs and bars is actually true, as the locals love to find out what draws you to their little part of the world and, of course, they like the chance to share a little bit of their history with you! Ask any local and they will tell you that a trip to Belfast will mean that you learn far more about the Irish and British psyche than a trip to a cheesy Irish pub in Dublin or on a tourist-orientated tour in [[London]].

==Get in==

===By plane===
Belfast has two airports:

[http://www.belfastcityairport.com/home.asp '''George Best Belfast City Airport'''] ({{IATA|BHD}}) is just two miles from Belfast's city centre, with magnificent views of the city of Belfast or Belfast Lough on approach and departure. This small but beautifully formed airport principally serves routes from other parts of the British Isles plus a couple of flights from France. Airlines using the airport include:
*[http://www.aerlingus.com/ Aer Lingus] from London Heathrow
*[http://www.britishairways.com/ British Airways] from London Heathrow
*[http://www.klm.com/ KLM] [[Amsterdam]] Schiphol.

In 2019 the redevelopment of Carlisle Lake District Airport, Cumbria saw the route Belfast - Carlisle operated by Loganair using small craft. However, as with many operations and indeed airlines, the future of this route is in question since the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic lockdowns and restrictions. 

The terminal is served every 20-30 min 06:00-22:00 by the [http://www.translink.co.uk/Services/Other-Translink-Services/Airport-Services/Airport-Express-600/ Metro 600 bus] (£2.40 single, £3.60 return - valid 1 month). Depending on traffic, the journey to Belfast's Laganside and Europa Buscentres should take no more than 15 min.

Alternatively, NIR trains serve the airport at Sydenham station twice an hour on the Portadown/Belfast/Bangor line. Upon arrival, ask at the airport information desk for a free shuttle ride to the station. If arriving by train, the courtesy bus may be requested just inside the airport perimeter across the bridge from Sydenham station. A single fare to Belfast Central, Botanic, City Hospital or Great Victoria Street costs £1.60. A single to Bangor costs £3.80

Taxis cost approximately £10 to most parts of the city and are an economical choice for small groups.

[http://www.belfastairport.com/en/ '''Belfast International Airport'''] ({{IATA|BFS}}) is further from Belfast than City Airport, lying closer to the towns of Templepatrick and Antrim, but offers significantly more international destinations. United Airlines has connections available to destinations throughout the Americas and beyond.

* Easyjet [http://www.easyjet.com] to Alicante, Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin Schoenefeld, Bristol, Edinburgh, Faro, Geneva, Glasgow International, Ibiza, Krakow, Liverpool John Lennon, London Gatwick, London Stansted, Malaga, Newcastle, Nice, Palma, Paris Charles de Gaulle, Prague, Rome Ciampino, Venice
* Jet2 [http://www.jet2.com] to Alicante, Almería,  Antalya, Blackpool, Chambery, Cologne, Dubrovnik, Gran Canaria, Ibiza, Jersey, Leeds Bradford, Malaga, Menorca, Murcia, Naples, Palma, Salzburg, Tenerife South, Toulouse, Verona, and Vienna
* Wizzair [http://www.wizzair.com] to [[Vilnius]]

The terminal is served up to every 30 min from 5:35AM-11:20PM by the 300 Airport bus [http://www.translink.co.uk/Services/Other-Translink-Services/Airport-Services/Airport-Express-300/] (£7.50 single, £10.50 return). Depending on traffic, the journey to Belfast's Laganside and Europa Buscentres takes about 45 minutes. Taxis should cost no more than £25-30 to Belfast City Centre.

There is also a slower route available by taking the (hourly service M-Sa) Ulsterbus 109A service to Antrim from the stand outside the airport, leave the bus at Antrim Bus station (£2.40 one way if bought on board and £2.50 if bought at the tourist info point inside the airport; Sep 2012). Take a train from Antrim to Belfast Great Victoria Street (£5.20 one way). In return, the views are greater when taking the train. Train times to be found on timetables at station, you can also get by train to Londonderry/Derry, Ballymena/Ballymoney and Coleraine/Portrush/Castlerock by train also just ask what platform they are departing from trains usually run every  hour to Londonderry/derry and to Belfast Great Victoria Street.

====From Dublin====
It is also possible to get to Belfast from '''Dublin Airport''' 160 km (100 mi) to the south. Ryanair and Aer Lingus (the national airline of the Republic of Ireland) serve many international destinations in Europe and North America (including Boston, Los Angeles and New York). Hourly buses (24 hours, daytime services operated by Ulsterbus, night services by Bus Éireann) [http://www.translink.co.uk/VisitorAirportFerry.asp] link Dublin Airport and the Belfast Europa Buscentre (which is in the same building as "Great Victoria Street " Train station Handy if you are planning on continuing your journey elsewhere in Northern Ireland by train.
There are several day tour companies that operate daily tours to Belfast.

===By train===

You can now get cheap tickets to and from Belfast on http://www.translink.co.uk/en/Buy-Tickets-Online/Enterprise-Web-Fare/ . This link is quite tricky to find on translink website so here you go.

Despite decades of underinvestment and service cutbacks, Northern Ireland Railways [http://www.nirailways.co.uk] (a division of Translink, Northern Ireland's public transport operator) manages to maintain a small but increasingly reliable passenger rail network around the province, with four 'domestic' lines radiating out from Belfast. '''Great Victoria Street Station''' is in the centre of Belfast and is the most central train station or stop, on, as the name suggests, Great Victoria Street. Just yards from the Grand Opera House and beside the Europa Hotel, the Great Victoria Street Station is part of a combined bus/rail station, the bus centre being called '''Europa Bus Centre'''. Look for the sign above the door to access the station from Great Victoria Street, '''Great Northern Mall''', or access from side-street running the side of the Grand Opera House, Glengall Street. Another major city rail station is '''Lanyon Place Station''' (until 2018, this was known as "Belfast Central Station"). Among other routes served from Lanyon Place, the station is the terminal for the train south to the city Newry and to [[Republic of Ireland]] destinations on the single cross-border line, ending in [[Dublin]] (see below). Decades ago Lanyon Place was the main and so most central city station, while it lies close to a mile from the city centre. It is, though, fairly close to the Belfast Courts area and the Waterfront Hall and surrounding Laganside area and within easy walking distance. The station is also handy if going to East Belfast, with bus routes going to the east of the city and also routes through the city centre. Travellers arriving at Lanyon Place can, keeping their train ticket into Belfast city, stay on the rail platforms to take a short, free train transfer from Lanyon Place Station to Great Victoria Street Station or Botanic Station. (Botanic Station is for the Botanic Gardens environs and Queen's University area). 

There are four rail corridors in/out of Belfast:
* Belfast - Bangor
* Belfast - Portadown
* Belfast - Larne
* Belfast - Coleraine - Londonderry/Derry or Portrush

Service is most frequent and reliable on the Portadown - Belfast - Bangor corridor, on which new trains offer frequent and fast suburban service. The line to Londonderry/Derry is exceptionally beautiful as it passes along the north coast after Coleraine, however travellers should note that the railway line is slower (two hours or more) than the equivalent Ulsterbus Goldline express coach (one hour and forty minutes). Contact NIR for information on tourist passes for exploring Northern Ireland by bus and train: with integrated bus and train stations in most major towns, the province is easily explored without a car.

Services to Dublin (with connections to other destinations in the Republic of Ireland) is offered by the '''Enteprise''', a modern, comfortable, but relatively slow train jointly operated by '''Northern Ireland Railways''' and '''Iarnrod Eireann''' (which operates trains in the Republic of Ireland). Journeys between Dublin and Belfast take two hours and twenty minutes, and there are up to eight trains a day, offering two classes of service. The train takes a less direct route than the road, but offers some superb views and is still generally quicker than equivalent buses. Cheap day returns are available to those willing to book online [http://www.translink.co.uk/en/Buy-Tickets-Online/Enterprise-Web-Fare/]. Standard fare is £25 one-way when purchased on the day of travel.

===By bus===

Ulsterbus [http://www.ulsterbus.co.uk/] (a division of Translink, Northern Ireland's public transport operator) operate the intercity bus network in Northern Ireland, linking most major towns and cities. Services are well-used and, in most cases, reasonably priced. The most frequent service is to [[Londonderry]]/[[Derry]]. Bus Éireann [http://www.buseireann.ie/site/home/] jointly operate cross-border services with Ulsterbus and operate almost all intercity routes in the Republic of Ireland. Bus Éireann offer a €15 single fare and €22 return fare from Dublin Busaras (bus station) and Dublin Airport to the Europa Buscentre in Belfast (currently unavailable to purchase online); Ulsterbus offers similar specials in the opposite direction. There is also a daily bus to Cork, via Athlone and one to Galway via Cavan.

Under the Eurolines banner, Ulsterbus offer 2 daily services to [[Glasgow]] and [[Edinburgh]], and 2 daily services to London via [[Manchester]] and [[Birmingham (England)|Birmingham]]. All of these are via the fast ferry Stranraer. Connections are available via National Express to virtually every destination in mainland Great Britain.

For less independent travellers, you can also book day trips from [[Dublin]] to Belfast on Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays. This includes a bus trip to Belfast followed by a black taxi cab ride through the two neighbourhoods and a visit to the peace wall. See Belfast Taxi Tours [http://www.TaxiTrax.com] for info.

Local bus travel in Northern Ireland can be expensive outside of Belfast, but services are frequent and reliable. Belfast itself is small enough to walk anywhere comfortably.

There is also a bus based Park and Ride facility available, see National Park and Ride Directory [http://www.parkandride.net/belfast/belfast_frameset.shtml]

===By car===
Belfast is the focus of the road network in Northern Ireland, and as such is very well connected to the road network in Northern Ireland. While there are only three motorways in Northern Ireland (M1, M2 and M22), the rest of the country is very well provided for with high quality trunk roads.

Access to Belfast from the Republic of Ireland has never been better. Due to the great improvements the peace process in Northern Ireland has gained, crossing the border into Northern Ireland is now nothing more noticeable than a change in signposts and road markings. The M1 connects Dublin to Dundalk and almost to the border with Northern Ireland. The M1 is 83km long and has one toll over the Boyne Cable Bridge near Drogheda (€1.80 for a car).

====Car rental====

Belfast is not as well served by car rental companies as Ireland in general. Some Irish car rental companies offer a drop off option in Belfast while others have locations in Belfast City. If you plan to rent a car in the Republic of Ireland and drive it into Northern Ireland be aware of the additional insurance cost. Dan Dooley and Hertz do not charge for additional cross border insurance.

===By boat===

* Frequent sailings across the Irish Sea connect Belfast to the rest of The UK in mainland Great Britain. All the operators  offer special promotions throughout the year both for car journeys and foot passengers. Through ticketing with rail and bus services at each end are available from various sources. Advance, single and return ticket inter-city bus or train journeys (train often known as "Rail and Sail") are available from and to numerous cities on Great Britain, such as Glasgow, Edinburgh, Carlisle, Manchester, Birmingham and London. These tickets are available from local providers such as Scotrail and often for inter-city cross channel bus services on the day from the closer city bus stations. Simple port to port passenger tickets, as well as port to port vehicle tickets, are available to all destinations online and by phone from Stena, as well as from many travel agents and centres. 
** England - Northern Ireland. Stena Line provides at least two services daily in each direction between Liverpool Birkenhead and Belfast. The service takes around 8 hours, based around one early morning departure in both directions and one night ferry in both directions. Sleeping cabins are available, making an overnight ferry a handy way, year round, for all kinds of travellers to transfer from England to Northern Ireland and vice-versa. Liverpool - Birkenhead is ideally placed for rail and road connections to or from all directions, including quick connections for Wales. Northern Ireland - Fleetwood (for Liverpool) services were discontinued some years ago. 
** Scotland - Northern Ireland: Stena Line [http://www.stenaline.co.uk/] provides daily ferry services from [[Cairnryan]] in [[Scotland]] to both the Port of Belfast and Larne port. The modern, "superfast" vessels serving these two routes provide a journey of around 2 and a half hours. Cairnryan - Belfast services offer a spa relaxation area to passengers, including sauna and jacuzzi, at extra cost, booked onboard. Previous Northern Ireland - Scotland services using Scottish ports Stranraer and Troon were discontinued as of some years. The Cairnryan hub is the single Scottish ferry port for the large scale North Channel crossing services in 2020. Larne is easily accessible directly by train or bus from / to Belfast. The Port of Belfast is not in the City Centre and it's best to be prepared to arrange private transport such as a taxi to or from the centre. (That is, unless travelling with a full inter-city bus and ferry ticket including bus travel to or from the Europa Bus Centre in Belfast. Note that this is for inter-city bus tickets only. The "Rail and Sail" train and ferry combination tickets in either direction to any destination do NOT include a transfer between the Port of Belfast and Belfast City Centre, and it is not possible to add one at any point. Mostly, a private transfer ought to be arranged on arrival. Travellers leaving Belfast in most cases will need to arrange a taxi from where they are in Belfast to the port.) The public bus, Metro 96, is very infrequent after earlier morning rush hours, and may be mostly unhelpful for ferry passengers. It is a good idea to be prepared not to rely on this service. 
** Scotland - Northern Ireland, small scale, passenger only services: For around six months of the year, between April and September, the Kintyre Express foot passenger ferry serves two routes in both directions between Scotland and Northern Ireland. The first route is Campbeltown on the Kintyre peninsula, Argyll, mainland Scotland - Ballycastle, Northern Ireland. The other route is Isle of Islay, Inner Hebrides - Ballycastle. There are some varied connection opportunities at both of these Scottish ferry terminals. These routes offer great options for all kinds of travellers to these parts of the UK who aren't driving. However this is small scale transport, places can be very limited and it may often be required to book significantly in advance to avoid disappointment. Ballycastle is not on a train line from Belfast. The public transport route is bus between Ballycastle and Ballymena, and either bus or train between Ballymena and Belfast. It might be possible to get a reasonable advance taxi quote for Ballycastle to Ballymena, especially making sense if shared, yet that 25 or 30 minute road journey may also be quite expensive. It isn't too long in the bus. 
** Isle of Man - Belfast. The Isle of Man Steam Packet Company operates services on the routes Belfast - Isle of Man, and Isle of Man - Heysham, Liverpool. The journey from Belfast to Isle of Man takes either 2h45 or 4h45 depending on which vessel makes the crossing. This ferry company is the oldest, continuously operating passenger shipping service in the world.

===By sail and rail from Great Britain===

It is possible to buy a through train ticket between any railway station in [[Great Britain]] and any railway station in Ireland, north or south. It is generally cheaper to do this than buy separate train tickets to ferry ports and then foot passenger tickets on the boat, and this remains one of the cheapest ways of reaching Northern Ireland, especially at short notice.

'''For journeys from Great Britain''' tickets can be bought from any staffed station and from some automated ticket machines. Few online ticket agents sell cross-channel rail tickets, and those that do add additional booking fees. Since tickets are no cheaper booked in advance, they can usually be bought at the station on departure.

'''For journeys from Northern Ireland''' cross-channel tickets (and, in fact, all rail tickets for travel within Great Britain) can be bought from NI Railways Travel, the travel agency located at Great Victoria Street railway station (with a small handling fee) or at the Stena Line terminal in Belfast.

Most rail and sail passengers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland are routed via Stena Line's Belfast/Stranraer Stena HSS fast ferry. [[Stranraer]] railway station is immediately adjacent to the ferry terminal, although Stena Line will leave Stranraer for the non-rail connected Cairnryan in 2011. Fares are priced by zones within Great Britain, starting at £25 single / £50 return (£16.50 / £33 with a National Rail railcard) between Belfast and destinations in south-west Scotland. London to Belfast via Stranraer costs £46 single / £92 return. Tickets include rail travel to Stranraer and passage on the Stena HSS, although not the transfer from Stena's terminal in the Port of Belfast. Metro 96 runs hourly throughout the day between the terminal and the city centre, or for slightly more rail and sail passengers can travel on the faster coach transfer to the Europa Buscentre offered free for cross-channel coach passengers.

An alternative 'rail and sail' routing from London and southern Britain is via Holyhead and Dublin. Seat61.com [http://seat61.com/NorthernIreland.htm] offers informed and independent advice on how to book combined train and ferry tickets from any railway station in Great Britain to Northern Ireland.

==Get around==

The centre of Belfast is small enough to be explored by foot. Translink [http://www.translink.co.uk/] operate Belfast's urban bus network, called Metro (previously Citybus). Buses run along colour coded high frequency routes that radiate from the city centre from around 6AM until 11PM. All major bus routes start or pass through Donegall Square, and a Metro information kiosk is on the north-western side of the square. Tourist passes are available from here, or for the more frequent traveller, you can purchase and pre-load a Smartlink card with credit for bus trips. While the routes are extensive, the travel is expensive, as it is for the whole of the country. Buses frequently do not turn up and staff can at times be unhelpful.

There are no buses or trains running during the night (except to the airports), so your only option is to take a taxi if you need to travel anywhere you cannot walk to.

If your time is limited, the open-top 'Belfast Sightseeing' bus tours are recommended, costing about £10 per person for a 2 hour journey. You will be shown the sights in the city centre and suburbs including famous murals painted on the ends of terraced houses during 'The Troubles' in the Falls Road area, the Harland and Wolff shipyards where the Titanic was built and Queens University. The guides are friendly, well informed and interesting, although many locals still remark that is unusual to see bright red open top tour buses passing through once troubled neighbourhoods. You may prefer a less obvious exploration of the city.

Belfast is now famous for its Black Taxi tours of the city, which are highly recommended, and can be arranged by most hostels, hotels and at the tourist office (47 Donegall Place, above the Boots pharmacy, just north of the City Hall). These tours are given by regular taxi drivers who have worked through the troubled years, and have a wealth of knowledge and very personal experiences, which they are glad to share during a tour that can last up to two hours.

Also of interest are the shared taxi routes of North and West Belfast. These run along set routes and cost around £1, no matter how long the journey. Their origins date from the darkest days of the troubles, when city bus services were frequently disrupted by violence and attacks. There are fixed locations in the City Centre where these begin their routes, and will generally queue until filled with 4 or 5 people. Note that minicabs (regular saloon cars with taxi licence plates and illuminated roof signs) generally do not operate as black taxis.

==See==

To make the most of your time in the city your first point of contact should be the centrally located Belfast Welcome Centre (Tourist Office) [http://www.gotobelfast.com/] at Donegall Square North, just opposite City Hall.  The staff can provide maps, book accommodation and tours, recommend itineraries and places of interest and sell you overpriced and tacky souvenirs. There is also a useful left luggage facility. 

===Central===

Belfast city centre is focused on Donegall Square and Belfast City Hall in its centre. All major city bus routes converge here and, on sunny days, this is where shoppers and office workers can be found enjoying their breaks. The City Hall is the grand centerpiece of the city and the orientation point for your exploration of Belfast. Running north from the centre of Donegall Square is Donegall Place, a broad and bustling shopping street, which will lead you towards the Cathedral Quarter and the Arts School. The city centre is bordered to the east by the River Lagan, and to the south by the area around Donegall Pass. Where Belfast city centre meets the River Lagan, windswept pavements prove that meaningless sculptures and grandiose attempts at urban planning do not necessarily make for a popular urban space. The horrendous dual carriageway known as the Westlink separated the centre of Belfast from the western suburbs of the city in the 1970s; this borders the city centre to the west. On the plus side, the network of dual carriageways and motorways mean that one can get from the city centre to all the surrounding suburbs and satellite towns in less than fifteen minutes, even during the rush hour, something which is impossible in many other cities, for example Dublin.

In between these rough boundaries, you'll find Belfast's heart. Parts of it are blighted by dereliction, others are blighted by narrow-minded money-grabbing redevelopment. Note that while largely safe at all times, years of city centre curfews during the troubles means that the centre of Belfast can be startlingly empty of pedestrians after 8PM, with groups of teenagers the only people to found on Donegall Pl. City centre living has yet to become as popular here as in other parts of Britain and Ireland.

*'''City Hall''', Donegall Sq, Tel: +44 28 9032 0202 - Opened in 1906, the City Hall will possibly seem familiar to South African visitors, who may notice a resemblance to the city hall in Durban. This is a fine example of turn of the century architecture from the heart of the British Empire's drafting office. The City Hall houses Belfast's Council chambers and administrative offices. Excellently presented free guided tours are available every day; ring ahead for details of times. Also of note are the grounds, containing a memorial to victims of the Titanic and a statue of Queen Victoria. The City Hall will temporarily close to the public from November 2007 for essential renovation works. However, the grounds of the building will remain open and will continue to play host to popular events, such as the Continental Christmas Market. The building is scheduled to reopen in 2009 and, until then, most Council services, including the Registrar's office for births, deaths, marriages and civil partnerships, will relocate to Adelaide Exchange in nearby Adelaide Street. 

*'''Place''' [http://www.place.uk.net/], 40 Fountain St, Tel: +44 28 9023 2524. This diminutive shop space was recently taken over by the Royal Society of Ulster Architects (RSUA) as a small gallery space to promote the built environment in Northern Ireland. Regular exhibitions and workshops are held here.

*''' Ormeau Baths Gallery''', 18a Ormeau Ave, Tel: +44 28 9032 1402, [http://www.ormeaubaths.co.uk/]. Significantly lacking in credibility, the Arts Council of Northern Ireland has now taken over the running of this once-lively and vibrant art gallery. This change of direction has left the OBG without a single artist involved in the running of the museum. A group of local artists has subsequently formed the Ormeau Baths Gallery in Exile, a mobile venue which hopes to 'return' to the OBG building in 2007.

*'''Saint Anne's Cathedral''', Donegall St, Tel: +44 28 9043 4006. The stunning cathedral building is situated at the opposite end of '''Royal Avenue''', the main shopping street, from the City Hall. It is a fascinating building, and is at the centre of the "Cathedral Quarter", which is reluctantly being redesigned and cleaned up by various investment agencies to become Belfast's 'cultural' district. Thankfully, a lot of work remains to be done, and the area contains many fine cafés, bars and interesting buildings that recall the city's commercial and industrial heritage. Rent prices have yet to jump significantly, so keep an eye out for the small galleries and studio workspaces that remain in this area.

*''' Belfast Exposed''', 23 Donegall St, [http://www.belfastexposed.org/]. Tu-Sa 11AM-5PM, Tel: +44 28 9023 0965. Belfast Exposed is Northern Ireland's only dedicated photography gallery, and as well as operating a fine exhibition space in a refurbished warehouse building, also provides local photographers with dark room and processing facilities and a well maintained library. Exhibitions are usually free and always worth seeing.

*''' Belfast Print Workshop and Gallery''', 30-42 Waring St, Tel: +44 28 9023 1323, [http://www.belfastprintworkshop.org.uk/]. This gallery is combined with an active workshop, where local artists are able to use the facilities to print their work. Usually a good selection of local work.

*'''Belfast Central Library''', Royal Ave, Tel: +44 28 9050 9150. Opposite the road from the Cathedral, the Victorian library building houses an excellent Irish section and a newspaper library, containing archives of all Northern Irish newspapers. 

[[Image:Bigfish.JPG|thumb|Belfast Big Fish, beside the Lagan Lookout]]

*''' Titanic Boat Tour''', [http://www.laganboatcompany.com/tours.php]. Belfast takes a bizarre pride in that the ill-fated Titanic was built here (not caring to promote the many hundreds of other ships that were built here which did not sink) and you can now take a boat tour around the area that the ship was built. The former boat yards of Belfast are being ambitiously redeveloped into a residential and commercial neighbourhood that will be called (you guessed it) the Titanic Quarter. Tours cost £10. Check sailing times on their website.

*''' The Waterfront Hall''',  2 Lanyon Pl, Tel: +44 28 9033 4455, [http://www.waterfront.co.uk/]. Standing on the northern side of Donegall Square, Belfast's imposing concert and conference venue is visible to the east where Chichester St meets the riverside. Built in 1997, it has been credited with generating £10 for the Belfast economy for every £1 spent on its construction . The main auditorium offers some of the best performance hall acoustics anywhere in Europe, and it is worth checking with the box office for upcoming shows.

*''' The Bar Council & Bar Library of Northern Ireland''', 414 Chichester St, [http://www.barlibrary.com/]. Not open to the public, but notable for its striking architectural design. The northern half of the building is the opulent home of Belfast's (privately employed) barristers; meanwhile the southern end of the building (visible from May St) is occupied by the more modest Royal Courts of Justice Stamp Office (a tax-payer-funded government agency). Presented with two clients with two wildly different budgets, local architects Robinson McIlwaine successfully designed one building which seamlessly merge a more modest design and cheaper materials for the southern half of the building and a more elaborate and expensive design at the northern end.

*'''Cornmarket''' is at the centre of Belfast's retail area. Visitors from other parts of the UK and Ireland will feel immediately at home with the bland selection of high street chains.

===South===

Belfast's leafiest and most accessible suburbs are found south of the city centre along Botanic Ave, and University Rd around the Queen's University. Apart from the small loyalist community around Donegall Pass, the areas between University Rd and Lisburn Rd are mostly mixed, and there is a dense student population living in rented accommodation. It's a 20 min walk from Donegall Place to Botanic Avenue. The commercial core of Belfast is apparent on Bedford St, and the lively bars, takeaways of Dublin Rd are busy most nights of the week. Botanic Ave is somewhat quieter with less traffic and is lined with cafés, restaurants and small shops. Farther south, beyond the University, is the Lisburn Rd, recently christened "Belfast's Bond Street", with its eclectic mix of boutiques, chic bars and restaurants, and lively coffee shops. This part of town is the most affluent of the city, and is regularly referred to by its postcode: BT9. 

*''' Queen's University''', University Rd, +44 28 9024 5133, [http://www.qub.ac.uk/vcentre]. Take any number 8 bus (8A - 8C) from the city center. At the southernmost end of the Golden Mile, the university is a fine Victorian building with extensive grounds. It contains a visitors' centre in the main central building.

*''' Queens Film Theatre''', 20 University Sq, +44 28 9097 1097, [http://www.queensfilmtheatre.com/]. Belfast's art house and repertory cinema, and is the central location for the annual Belfast Film Festival.

*''' Botanical Gardens''',  accessed from University Rd beside the university and at the southern end of Botanic Ave, [http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/parksandopenspaces/parksdetails.asp?id=54]. Very popular with locals and visitors alike. The '''Palm House''' contains local and interesting plants, such as carnivorous plants. Beside it is the '''Tropical Ravine''', unique to the British Isles, where visitors walk around a raised balcony observing tropical flora and fauna. With large lawns and well maintained planting, the park is a popular destination in the summer. Fans of the BBC TV hidden camera comedy show 'Just for Laughs' will recognise the park from many hidden stunts. During the summer months be on the lookout for cameras pointing at you from parked vans and badly disguised tents.

*''' Ulster Museum''', +44 28 9038 3000, [http://www.ulstermuseum.org.uk/]. Accessed off Stranmillis Rd in the Botanic Gardens, +44 28 9038 3000. This excellent museum has much to see, including a large section on the history of Irish conflict, Northern Ireland's marine life and a significant collection of art. While many locals dislike the 1970s extension, it is one of the finest examples of a Brutalist modern extension being added and successfully integrated to an older classically designed museum. The museum is closed until the end of October 2009 for major redevelopment. Free.

*''' Lyric Theatre''',  55 Ridgeway St, +44 28 9038 1081, [http://www.lyrictheatre.co.uk/]. The diminutive Lyric remains the only full-time producing theatre in Northern Ireland. A busy schedule of productions can be found online. A major redevelopment is planned to take place in the next few years.

===North===

*''' Belfast Zoo''', Antrim Road, +44 28 9077 6277, [http://www.belfastzoo.co.uk/]. Open daily 10AM-7:00PM (April 1 to September 30)/ 10AM -  4PM (October 1 to March 31), admission £11.50 (adults)/£5.80 (children, students, senior), take any number 1 bus (1A - 1G) from the city centre. A substantial modernisation programme has recently been finished, and the zoo has a very good variety of animals. The prairie dogs are of particular interest, as their tunnels extend throughout the park, rendering any open space looking like a giant game of 'whack-a-rat'. Much merriment was caused when the zoo was praised for letting the prairie dogs run wild and free, an accident that was caused after much effort was spent preventing them from digging out of their enclousre but noone checked on their ablity to climb and they simply scampered over their small enclosing wall. The Zoo has recently welcomed Lily, the first Barbary lion cub to be born in Ireland. 

*''' Belfast Castle''', Antrim Rd, +44 28 9077 6925, [http://www.belfastcastle.co.uk/]. Daily 9AM-6PM, admission free, take any number 1 bus (1A - 1G) from the city centre. The castle (more accurately a large stately home) dates from 1870 and was restored in 1988. It is situated on '''Cave Hill''' and has good views of the city and coast. Cave Hill Country Park has marked walking routes and is an excellent viewpoint from which to get a view of Belfast.

===West===

*'''An Chultúrlann''' (Irish Language Cultural Centre) [http://www.culturlann.ie/], 216 Falls Road, BT12 6AH, +44 28 9096 4180, the hub of Irish language activities in Belfast.  Cultúrlann McAdam Ó Fiaich, at the heart of the Gaeltacht Quarter on the Falls Road is the Belfast Irish Experience, a friendly drop-in space where you can engage with the locals and experience Irish culture, but depending on your interests, it is also a dynamic arts centre, a centre for traditional music, a tourist information point, a café, a place to buy crafts or books, a place to learn the Irish language or take up new hobbies, to meet friends or book a tour, a place to feel proud of your heritage or to explore Irish culture.
 
*'''West Belfast Taxi Association''' 35a King St, +44 28 9031 5777, operate a remarkably efficient service from Belfast city centre to areas of West Belfast. Taxis run every few minutes up the Falls Road to destinations including Whiterock, Andersonstown and Twinbrook. The services operate as taxi buses, with passengers sharing a black cab with others who are going to roughly the same place. The routes are similar to bus routes, but the driver will stop and let you out at any point. Taxis can be hailed along the Falls and Andersonstown Rds. Fare from the city centre to Andersonstown are £1.30 one-way, cheaper and more convenient than the equivalent bus service.

*'''Fáilte Feirste Thiar''' (Welcome West Belfast) [http://www.visitwestbelfast.com/], 243 Falls Rd, +44 28 9024 1100, Tourist Information office and welcome centre located in the heart of the Falls. The office distributes free maps, offers tours and general information about this part of the city.

*'''Political Murals''', throughout Falls Rd and Shankill Rd. Visit the world renowned murals in the nationalist Falls and unionist Shankill portions of West Belfast. The main murals are situated on gable walls of buildings on both the Falls and Shankill roads, but others are located in the lower Shankill estate (off the lower Shankill Rd onto North Boundary St) and Bombay St (off the Falls Rd onto Clonard Gardens).

*'''Milltown Cemetery''', 546 Falls Rd. One of the two massive cemeteries of West Belfast. Milltown is dripping with history, being the final resting place for many Republican paramilitary members (mostly buried at the Republican plot, beneath the tricolour flag). There is also a memorial garden for IRA members killed during the Troubles, including those who took part in the 1981 Hunger Strike. Milltown cemetery is also the site of the notorious killings in 1988 of three mourners at an IRA funeral by Loyalist paramilitary Michael Stone. The attack took place near the Republican plot.[[Image:Milltowncemetary1110.jpg|thumb|Pictured: Milltown Cemetery in November 2010.]]

*'''Falls Park''', Falls Rd, 079 1754 3626. A large open space populated by a huge cemetery, gardens, Gaelic Football and Hurling pitches. Falls Park is a pleasant place to visit on a sunny day and provides a welcome respite from the city.

*'''Casement Park''' (''Páirc Mhic Asmaint'') is the principal stadium of the GAA (Gaelic Athletic Association) in the province of Ulster. The sports of Gaelic Football and Hurling are played here, both of which provide a unique experience for visitors to the city. Tickets are extremely well priced (admittance to a major game would not be more than £20) and are, in most cases, available on the gate. For match dates and times check the ''Irish News'' newspaper or online[http://www.ulster.gaa.ie]. 

*'''O'Neills Sportswear''', 14 Andersonstown Rd, +44 28 9062 7032. O'Neills is the largest manufacturer and retailer of Gaelic Sports equipment and memorabilia, ideal for a more individual souvenir. Merchandise such as team or county jerseys are well priced, with a clearance department in-store where factory seconds and older stock are on sale at very low prices.

*'''Eileen Hickey Republican History Museum'''[http://www.eileenhickeymuseum.com/], Conway Mill, +44 28 9024 0504. Museum exploring the history of Republicanism in Belfast. A charming museum, offering the history of Belfast from a Republican perspective. Offers a very interesting glimpse into what Belfast was like for the Catholics and Nationalists who had to live there through the discrimination and violence of the troubles. Free admission.

===East===
East Belfast is the largest of the cities' 4 electoral wards and is serviced by a number of large arterial roads (Cregagh Road, Castlereagh Road, Newtownards Road and Holywood Road), which all start in or close to the city centre.

East Belfast is a mainly residential and largely Protestant area encompassing a wide range of housing from the working class terraced streets along the Beersbridge road, to wide tree lined avenues of Belmont, and all areas in between.  Despite its largely Protestant nature East Belfast is generally the area of the city where newcomers to Belfast of all religious and political persuasions from within Northern Ireland will look to purchase houses in when they arrive in the city.  The rationale for this may be that although South Belfast is often thought of as a desirable locale it is in many cases prohibitively expensive.  North and West Belfast are even cheaper than the East but whilst both contain many pleasant neighbourhoods they still have a lot of echoes from the troubles that can put newcomers off. North Belfast especially has a large number of "interface areas" (regions where working class loyalist and republican areas meet) that can occasionally flare up into trouble.  East Belfast, possibly because it has only one interface area and is relatively homogeneously Protestant, was less on the "coalface" of the troubles than both the North and the West.

*'''Stormont Parliament Buildings''', +44 28 9025 0000. The parliament buildings are the home of the recently reinstated '''Northern Ireland Assembly'''. The buildings are massive and have marble interiors. The grounds are interesting in themselves, and a walk down the mile long road to the main parliament buildings is well recommended. Guided tours commence at 10am and 3pm (Monday to Friday) during weeks when the Northern Ireland Assembly is active. During 'Recess' (Christmas, Easter week, July and August) there are tours from 10am to 3pm on the hour, every hour. These tours are free and do not need to booked in advance.

*'''Be aware that the buses directly to Stormont are not frequent and there is usually one an hour (either Metro 20a or Metro 23, time depending) from the city centre which will bring you very close to the building itself. If you prefer to see the beatiful tree-lined Stormont Estate with its mile-long (1.2km) Prince of Wales way then get the Metro 4a to the gates of Stormont and make your way on foot up to Parliament Buildings. Do bear in mind that you are going to the top of a hill so it may take 15 minutes to get to the top if you are a fast walker.

*''' Ulster Folk and Transport Museum''', Cultra, +44 28 9042 8428, [http://www.uftm.org.uk/]. Approximately 8 miles north-east from Belfast City Centre and most easily reached by train from Cultra station. Open daily 10AM-6PM, admission £6.50. It is one of Ireland's premier tourist attractions. It has a vast collection, and you could spend days exploring all of it. Highlights of the transport museum include a DeLorean (great scott!, etc.) and two train sheds full full of old steam locomotives and buses from Northern Ireland's past. The Folk Museum, on the other side of the railway line features a re-creation of an old Irish town. On Saturdays, there is a miniature railway operating, which is great fun. The folk museum is outdoors, so come prepared for the changeable Irish climate.
'''Lorne Guide Headquarters''' Close to the *''' Ulster Folk and Transport Museum''', about a mile. It is the guide headquarters for Northern Ireland but to access you must be part of the guiding community e.g. Brownie, Guide etc.

*'''The Golden Mile''' is the name given to the mile or so between Belfast City Hall and '''Queen's University'''. It sometimes disappoints tourists because it's less immediately evident and less densely packed together than the name suggests. It's also not the safest part of Belfast at night - local taxi trivers will tell you some horror stories about things they see on Friday and Saturday nights and a large police presence is usually in evidence. Be careful using cash machines, and if you're having trouble getting a taxi it's probably better to start walking than to stick around for too long on street corners. Exploring the area in the day time will help you if you come back later for a night out. You'll find the lion's share of the City Centre's best bars and some good places to eat here. The Golden Mile starts around the Europa Hotel on Great Victoria Street, takes a skip to the left to continue down Dublin Road, reaches a buzzing climax around Bradbury Place (just south of the big screen overlooking the junction) and graduates to student friendly but welcoming bars along Botanic Avenue and University Road. See the Drink section for specific recommendations.
*Enjoy a long, slow afternoon with a pint or two of '''Guinness''' in one of the bars listed here. 
*'''Crown Liquor Saloon''', 46 Great Victoria St, +44 28 9027 9901, aka '''Crown Bar'''. Situated on the Golden Mile opposite the '''Europa Hotel''', it is by some visitors rated to be the most beautiful pub existing in Northern Ireland today, and even if you don't drink, it's worth a visit. Apart from the stained glass windows (lovingly restored and replaced after several car bombs) it is largely unchanged since Victorian times, and the dark interior is still gas-lit. The intricate tiling and woodwork is attributed to the Italians, who came to Belfast to build numerous churches. The men worked after hours on renovations to the saloon in exchange for bar service. Inside, you'll find the famous booths which can seat about a dozen people, and be closed off from the bar with the attracted wood paneled doors. These are hot property after work on a Friday afternoon, so move quickly if you have the chance to occupy one. Note the button inside which was once used to summon a barman to take your order (sorry, these no longer work). If you find yourself without a private booth, the open area in front of the bar is sociable with drinks flowing and friendly people all around.
*'''Odyssey Centre''', 2 Queen's Quay, +44 28 9045 1055. Across the bridge from the Lagan Weir is the Odyssey centre. This complex contains a cinema, the Odyssey Arena (home of ice hockey team Belfast Giants), a bowling alley, W5 (an interactive science discovery centre) and a range of restaurants and bars.
*'''Parks and open spaces''' Belfast is home to a wide range of parks and open spaces, making it one of the greenest cities in Ireland. The main parks include Sir Thomas and Lady Dixon Park, Ormeau Park and Botanic Gardens (located in the south of the city), Waterworks, Belfast Castle estate, Cave Hill Country Park and Alexandra Park (north Belfast), Dunville and Falls Park (west Belfast) and Orangefield and Victoria Park (in the east of the city). There are a host of walking routes through these parks and many include play facilities for children. Slightly further out from the City Centre, the Lagan Towpath is a delightful, peaceful and safe walk particularly during the summer months.
*<do name="Grand Opera House" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" url="http://www.goh.co.uk/" hours="" price="" lat="" long="">Possibly the finest remaining example of Georgian theatre architecture in the UK, this century-old building is a must-see for theatre and art lovers alike. Plays tend to show every evening except Sundays, with matinee performances on Thursdays and Saturdays. Discount is often available for students and senior citizens. The theatre also features an art gallery, displaying local artwork: viewing the pictures is free. If you ask nicely staff are usually pleased to give you a short tour of the theatre so you can take photos and learn a little bit about the theatre's history. The theatre also has a contemporary bar and cafe for people to relax during the day or have lunch. The staff are very friendly and helpful, with a good knowledge of the area. The theatre is right next to Great Victoria Street Station, making it a perfect place to visit when you arrive.</do>

===Theatres===

*'''Grand Opera House''', Great Victoria Street, Booking, +44 28 9024 1919.  A fine Victorian building, which showcases large productions, both local and touring.

==Buy==

Belfast has the full complement of high street chain stores that can be found in any other UK and Irish city. It does however have a variety of more interesting places to browse and shop, and a visit to Belfast would not be complete without experiencing them.

[[Image:Stgeorgesmarket.JPG|thumb|A trader at St. George's Market]]

*''' St. George's Market''', on May Street, is situated near Belfast Central Station, [http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/markets/index.asp?menuitem=Saint-George]. It is Northern Ireland's largest indoor market and one of Belfast's major attractions for visitors and locals alike. It sells a fascinating range of foods, clothing and crafts and will appeal to all of your senses. You can pick up some real bargains here, and the market itself provides a charming glimpse into Belfast life both past and present - many of the stall holders will be more than happy to tell you some fantastic local lore. Details correct as of Sept 2015: Friday Variety Market 6am-2pm, Saturday City Food, Craft and Garden Market 9am-3pm, Sunday Food, Craft & Market 10am-4pm.

*''' Victoria Square''', this large shopping complex opened in 2008 and will appeal to fans of mainstream shopping. [http://www.victoriasquare.com] There are plenty of places to eat and drink, as well as an 8-screen Odeon cinema. Additionally, the now-iconic glass dome at the top of Victoria Square offers unparalleled views of the city and beyond, not to be missed by visitors as this is a free attraction. 

*''' Smithfield Market''', Winetavern Street, behind the Castle Court shopping centre, [http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/markets/smithfield.asp?menuitem=Smithfield]. A treasure trove of independent retail outlets, and provides a much more authentic experience than the afore mentioned Castle Court centre in Royal Avenue.

*''' No Alibis''', 83 Botanic Avenue, +44 28 9020 1261, [http://www.noalibis.com/]. One of the finest independent bookstores anywhere in the whole of Ireland, this is a must for fans of British, Irish and American crime fiction, with a wide selection of books imported from the United States. No Alibis reassures bibliophiles and bookworms that there is more to life than Borders or Waterstones.

You will also find a number of interesting shops on and around College Street, and on Dublin Road, including quirky vintage shops.

==Drink==

Belfast has a vibrant and varied nightlife which is improving year on year. The most popular areas tend to be the Cathedral Quarter and around the Dublin Road area. Closing times and last orders are generally a source of confusion even to many locals - but as a rule of thumb nights out in Belfast begin early and end earlier than in many similar European cities. As of December 2015, pubs around the city centre are generally open until 1am on weekends, bars 2am and a handful of clubs stay open until 3am. Clubs rarely let people in after 1.30am. Occasionally there are BYOB pop-up parties in the city centre, which can last most of the night.

Be aware that getting a '''Taxi''' home on a Friday or Saturday night can be very difficult, as demand hugely outstrips supply
around the peak hours of midnight-3am. There are a limited number of black taxis that can be hailed on the street; the rest are private hire which must be booked by phone. While increasing public pressure will hopefully help resolve the problem, the best current advice for late-night tourists is to try and stay in accommodation within easy walking distance of the city centre. Some hotels/hostels may be able to obtain priority bookings. 


*<drink name="Belfast Pub Crawl" alt="Belfast Crawl" address="Filthy McNasty's" directions="Starting on the Dublin Road, a few hundred metres from the Europa Station." phone="07445521950" url="http://www.belfastcrawl.com" hours="7.30-close" price="£8" lat="" long="">Belfasts only dedicated pub crawl service brings you to some of the best and most famous bars in the city, including Filthy McNasty's, Laverys, The Taphouse, The Elms, The Parlour and The Bot.

Affectionately known as 'The Bot', this bar is very popular, especially with students during the university term. It has a reputation for great atmosphere and craic, though can get very crowded at weekends. Downstairs is a large, attractive bar that regularly shows live sport, while upstairs has a highly regarded club. Good food is offered and drinks are reasonably priced.

*'''Scratch Nightclub''' [http://www.theflybar.com/], 5-6 Lower Cresent, +44 28 9050 9750. Centrally located just off Botanic Avenue, Scratch has been recently refurbished and regularly hosts popular club nights. The bar/club stretches over three floors and has a great reputation as the place to dance the night away! Open six nights a week, Scratch caters for all tastes. Friday and Saturday nights are the most popular; with famous local DJ Paul Kennedy spinning dance classics every Saturday.

*'''The Globe''' [http://www.theglobebar.com/], 36 University Rd, +44 28 9050 9840. Another popular university area bar, the Globe is open 7 days a week, serving fantastic food at a reasonable price. Like most of the university area bars, The Globe hosts regular club nights, but is also popular for big screen sports.

*'''Brickies Bar (aka The Speakeasy)''' Brickies is in Queen's University Student Union and is usually a good starting point for a night out. Don't hesitate to ask the students about the best place to go on any particular night!

*'''Thompsons''' [http://www.clubthompsons.com/], seems to be the place to be. This club plays music too loud and too late, with good DJs and a foggy somewhat underground atmosphere. Next to the City Hall, look for the narrow entry across the street from the Belfast Eye.

===Traditional bars===

*'''The Kitchen Bar''' [http://www.thekitchenbar.com/], 36-40 Victoria Sq, +44 28 9032 4901. One of the most historic bars in Belfast, the original Kitchen Bar dates back to 1859 and was one of the favourite watering holes of the star performers of Belfast's famous Empire Music Hall.  Relocated just round the corner from its original site to an old converted warehouse, it retains all the charm and charisma that visitors experienced at the original venue.  Real Ale...Real Food...Real Craic...is the keywords for The Kitchen Bar and it certainly delivers on all three points, a must for any visitor to Belfast.  Traditional fresh food is served daily including the renowned soda bread based 'Paddy Pizza'!

*'''McHugh's Bar & Restaurant''' [http://www.mchughsbar.com/], 29-31 Queens Sq, +44 28 9050 9999. Situated in Belfast's oldest building, dating back to 1711. McHugh's has a 100 seater restaurant, a basement bar offering live entertainment and the main gallery, providing enough space and atmosphere for a great night out.  The Basement & main bar hosts live traditional music sessions at various times of the week and weekend so make sure you go along and catch one of these free sessions!  The restaurant provides impeccable service and great food with sacrificing value.  With entertainment, art & culture, McHugh's is a traditional bar with a difference.

*'''Madison's Hotel''' [http://www.madisonshotel.com/], 59-63 Botanic Ave, +44 28 9050 9800.

Offering all modern features a guest expects today, Madison's has an established reputation for great food, fine wines, amazing cocktails and fabulous entertainment all under the one roof.

*'''Ryan's Bar & Restaurant''' [http://www.ryansbarandgrill.com/], 116-118 Lisburn Rd, +44 28 9050 9850. The emphasis in Ryan's is on providing good food, good value and great service.  The ground floor provides an informal & comfortable venue for craic & conversation where you can partake of great all day bar food.  One thing you have to be sure to try are Ryan's World Famous Chicken Wings - the recipe is a secret but it's no secret just how good they are!  Best washed down with a pint of the black stuff.  Ryan's 75 seater restaurant offers a comfortable setting to enjoy traditional meals cooked to perfection.  A rather intriguing & tasty choice are the 'Boxty' selections - a kind of Irish potato pancake!

*'''The Parador''' [http://www.theparadorhotel.com/], 116-118 Ormeau Rd, +44 28 9050 9850. The Ormeau Road's Parador Hotel has been given a new lease of life with a complete facelift and a packed schedule of nightly entertainment.  There is a mix of live traditional music on a Tuesday, Pub Quiz on a Wednesday and live Jazz every Thursday.  The Jazz Session has been described as one of the best in the city which draws jazz lovers from far and wide.  The Parador Hotel offers the best budget accommodation in the city starting at only £25 per night for a single room and £38 for a twin or double.  There's no need to venture out looking for somewhere to eat either as the hotel provides a great selection of homemade food.

===Alternative and Indie bars===

*'''Limelight/Katy Dalys/Spring and Airbrake''' [http://www.the-limelight.co.uk], 17 Ormeau Ave. A great trio of adjacent venues that open up into each other for live music and alternative club nights. Tuesday nights are the most popular and can be very crowded; be sure to come before 10PM to make sure you get in. Famous bands can regularly be found gigging here, and there are always a at least a couple of live gigs a week.

*'''The Rotterdam Bar''' [http://www.rotterdambar.com/], 52-54 Pilot St, +44 28 9074 6021. One of Belfast's oldest bars, with great personality and character. Features music every night.

*'''Pats Bar''', 19-22 Princes Dock St, +44 28 9074 4524. Right next door to the Rotterdam, this bar has also great character. What a lot of people do is go between the two pubs.

*'''The Menagerie Bar''', 130 University St, +44 28 9023 5678. This hidden away place near the Holiday Inn Express is a fun, atmospheric place. Dilapidated, but nice. Note: its popularity has declined a lot recently, not as funky as it used to be.

The following bars are beside each other in the Cathedral quarter. These all get a friendly alternative crowd:

*'''The Spaniard''', 3 Skipper Street, +44 28 9023 2448. A fantastic small friendly bar. 

*'''Duke of York''' [http://www.belfastbar.co.uk/?pid=11&venueid=82], 7-11 Commercial Ct, +44 28 9024 1062. A very popular bar, check it out on Thursday where they have traditional music.

*'''Whites Tavern''', 2-4 Wincellar Entry. Founded in 1630, one of the many bars to claim to be Belfasts oldest. Cosy downstairs bar with live music on Friday nights, upstairs has a jumping alternative disco on Friday and Saturday nights that is usually crammed to the roof.

===Mainstream bars===

*'''Cafe Vaudeville''' [http://www.cafevaudeville.com/], 25-39 Arthur St.  A huge over-the-top, 1920's Paris themed restaurant and bar.  The upstairs section features Northern Ireland's first "Bollinger bar". 

*'''Europa Piano Bar''', Europa Hotel, Great Victoria St, +44 28 9027 1066. For the more mature drinker, this place is relaxed and offers great views of the Golden Mile below.    

*'''Empire Bar''', 40 Botanic Ave, +44 28 9024 9276. This place, a former church, is a cosy bar downstairs, featuring traditional Irish music some nights. The upstairs section features live music and comedy.

*'''The Pavilion''' 296 Ormeau Road, +44 28 9028 3283 A three-level atmospheric pub with live music, pool and cheap live open mic comedy every monday.

*'''Errigle Inn''', 320 Ormeau Rd, +44 28 9064 1410. Unchanged since the 1930's, this bar is a popular authentic Belfast boozer. A great local bar, but a bit out of the way if you are only in Belfast for a short space of time.

*'''Odyssey Complex''' [http://www.theodyssey.co.uk], depending on your point of view its either a souless hole of a place populated with underage kiddies, or Belfast's entertainment mecca. It features about 3 bars, 6 restaurants, cinema, IMAX and a bowling alley. At weekends it gets a boozy slightly rough 'beautiful people' crowd. The best place to go to if you want girls in short skirts and guys who look like they're auditioning for a boy band.

*'''The Cloth Ear and The Bar''' [http://www.themerchanthotel.com/], 35-39 Waring St, +44 28 9023 4888. The Cloth Ear is The Merchant Hotel’s comfortable public bar. The warm and welcoming interior provides the ideal environment to relax and enjoy oneself in style. Combining both modern and traditional elements with a healthy dose of the eccentric.  For example, the many unique items of vintage and antique clothing, the wooden moose and deer heads and the classic 1930’s – 1950’s sheet music that adorn the walls.  Alternatively, go next door to the Merchant Hotel's own classic cocktail bar, simply named “The Bar”. The Victorian Grandeur of the building is abundantly evident, with its ornate ceilings, silk damask walls, antique Baccarat chandeliers and a cocktail list to which all the superlatives apply.  Also home to possibly the world's most expensive cocktail at £750 a go!

===Traditional music=== 

*'''Robinsons Bar''', Great Victoria St, right next to the Crown Bar, and opposite the Europa Hotel. Has tradional music every day in the back bar (Fibber Magees).

*'''The Hatfield House''', 130 Ormeau Rd. About as far from a tourist trap as one could possibly get. Located on the Ormeau Road, within walking distance from Botanic Avenue. Go to the Hatfield for an undiluted local experience - this is a ''real'' Irish pub, but be forewarned, it is very likely you will be the only tourist in the place. Very popular with a young crowd on weeknights and always busy on match days when Gaelic sports are shown on the big screen. Live music most nights. 

*'''Sunflower Pub''', 65 Union Street, Belfast, BT1 2JG. Very central location, right near the Linen House backpackers and the Cathedral Quarter, recognisable from the green steel cage out front, a leftover from The Troubles. Cheap pints, friendly staff & locals, with locals playing traditional Irish music in the booths regularly.

*'''Kellys Cellars''' [http://www.kellyscellars.co.uk], 30-32 Bank St, just off castle street. Has traditional music at weekends. Another place with a claim to Belfasts oldest bar title.

*'''Maddens Bar''' situated beside Castlecourt Shopping Centre in the Old Smithfield Square. Has traditional music at the weekends, gets an intellectual political crowd. Don't freak if you have to press the buzzer for entry, its a leftover from the troubles days, the place is quite safe.

*'''Note:'''Maddens and Kellys can be tricky to find so don't be scared to ask for directions.

===Late Clubs===

Generally, all clubs listed here are open until 3am. It is best to check the website or Facebook pages of the venues for the most up to date information on individual nights.

*'''Aux''' The upstairs club in Aether and Echo has rapidly gained a reputation as one of the most progressive and atmospheric clubs in Belfast. Music played tends to be funk, house and techno. Alcohol served until close.

*'''Thompsons''' Thompsons has given itself a makeover in recent years to become a very popular Belfast late night venue. Music differs depending on the night but covers all tastes.

*'''Love & Death Inc.''' An intimate and fun club hidden away from the bustle of the Cathedral Quarter.

===Budget===
*'''City Backpacker''' , 53-55 Malone Avenue, +44 28 9066 0030. This is the newest Hostel in Belfast and it has raised the standards.  Possibly the comfiest beds in the backpacking world.  The location is close to the Botanic Gardens and Queens University and only a 20 minute stroll into town.

*'''Lagan Backpackers''', 121 Fitzroy Ave. This small hostel is good for meeting other travelers and you can have a lot of fun there.

*'''Belfast International Youth Hostel''' [http://www.hini.org.uk/hostels/Belfast-International], 22-32 Donegal Rd, just off Shaftesbury Square (halfway between City Hall and Queen's University), +44 28 9031 5435. A good HI - YHA hostel near Shaftesbury Sq. Rates range from £10.50 for a bed in a shared dorm to £31.50 for an ensuite single room.

* <sleep name="Travelodge Hotel Belfast" alt="" address="15 Brunswick Street" directions="Just behind the Crown Liquor Saloon, and less than five minutes walk from the Europa Buscentre" phone="0870 1911 687" email="belfast@travelodge.ie" fax="+44 28 9023 2999 " url="http://www.travelodge.ie/belfast-hotel" checkin="3.00PM" checkout="12.00PM" price="from £39"> Part of the national chain of high value low frills motel-cum-hotels.

* '''Loughconnolly B+B''', 103 Carnlough Rd, Broughshane (just east of Ballymena, road heading in direction of Carnlough), ☎ (+44) 07761014434. High quality B+B at refreshingly low rates in a beautiful area. ''NOTE'' this B+B is about 35mins north of Belfast so a car would be necessary. Makes an ideal base for exploring the Glens of Antrim and worth a stop if you are making an onwards journey to the North Coast.

===Mid-range===

*'''Day's Hotel''' [http://www.dayshotelbelfast.co.uk/], 40 Hope St, +44 28 9024 2494. One advantage of staying in this place is that you don't have to look at it. The building seems to have taken the design of a suburban house and stretched it upwards by twelve storeys. However, there are usually great deals to be had online (rooms from £65) and the location is good: right next to the side entrance of Great Victoria Street Station and the Europa Buscentre, and just around the corner from the Europa. The colourful kerbstones of the loyalist Sandy Row are just a few feet away in the other direction, however tourists need not be intimidated. If you can't sleep at noise, it is not recommended. The walls are very thin and you can hear the doors opening and closing in the corridor. 

* <sleep name="Maldron Hotel Belfast City" alt="Located in the heart of Belfast city centre, the hotel is only minutes from popular attractions including The Grand Opera House, Victoria Square and Titanic Belfast.

*'''Malone Lodge Belfast''' [http://www.malonelodgehotelbelfast.com], 60 Eglantine Ave, Malone Rd, Tel: +44 28 9038 8060.

*'''Tara Lodge Belfast''' [http://www.taralodge.com], 36 Cromwell Road, Botanic Avenue, Belfast, BT7 1JW, Tel: +44 28 9059 0900.  Highly recommended on both Tripadvisor and Trivago, Tara Lodge is a boutique hotel located near Queen's University Belfast and is on the doorstep of nearly everything Belfast has to offer!

*'''ibis Belfast Queens Quarter''' [http://www.accorhotels.com/gb/hotel-7288-ibis-belfast-queens-quarter/index.shtml], 75 University Street, BT7 1HL , Tel: (+44)2890/333366.  Ibis Belfast Queens Quarter hotel is a 3-star hotel, just outside Belfast city centre.

*'''Park Inn by Radisson Belfast Hotel''' [http://www.parkinn.co.uk/hotel-belfast], 4 Clarence Street West, BT2 7GP , Tel: +44 (0)28 9067 7700.

===Splurge===

*'''Clayton Hotel Belfast''' [http://www.claytonhotelbelfast.com] 22 Ormeau Avenue, +44 28 9032 8511. This 170-bedroom, 4-star boutique style hotel is located in the city centre opposite the BBC and within a very short walk to the major attractions within Belfast.  This 4-star Belfast Hotel has a Club Vitae [https://www.clubvitae.com/belfastLeisure] Club with swimming pool, gym, spa, steam/sauna room.  The Academy Conference and Training Centre located on the 2nd floor of the hotel has 9 flexible meeting rooms with a capacity of 120 delegates along with a ground floor Ballroom for up to 550 people.

*'''Hilton Belfast''' [http://www.Hilton.co.uk/Belfast] 4 Lanyon Pl. Tel: +44 28 9027 7000. A luxurious Belfast hotel located next to the Waterfront Hall, or take a five minute walk into Belfast's new Victoria Square Shopping Center, stay in a recently refurbished guest room , executive Room or stay in one of the suites. Have a drink in the recently refurbished bar, Cables or have something to eat in the restaurant, Sonoma . Rooms from £100 per room per night, 5 min from Oddyssey Arena and Pavilion. Popular with conferences and many famous singers stay.

*'''Europa Hotel''' [https://www.hastingshotels.com/europa-belfast/], Great Victoria St, +44 28 9027 1066. A Belfast landmark in itself, the Europa is famous for having been bombed more times than any other hotel in any other city. Raucous events in the popular ballroom are more likely to disturb you than car bombs now, but it's comforting to know that the hotel (Northern Ireland's largest) has been built to withstand both. Its location could not be better: beside Great Victoria St train station and the Europa Buscentre, across from the Crown Liquor Saloon and next door to the Belfast Grand Opera House. The rooms are comfortable, but increasingly outclassed by more modern arrivals in the city. Doubles from around £100, but why not treat yourself to one of the few Presidential Suites in Northern Ireland that can rightly claim the name: Bill Clinton has stayed in it twice. Popular with business folk, politicians and package tourists.

*'''Radisson Blu Hotel''' [http://www.radissonblu.co.uk/hotel-belfast], 3 Cromac Pl (The Gasworks), off the Ormeau Rd, +44 28 9043 4065. Situated on the banks of the River Lagen and on the grounds of the old "Gasworks" this hotel manages to be in the city centre, but also off the main roads, so still quiet and peaceful.

*'''Malmaison Belfast''' [http://www.malmaison-belfast.com/], 34-38 Victoria St, +44 28 9022 0200. Condé Nast Traveller called it a 'Hot New Hotel' when it opened in 2005, and Belfast's upwardly mobile trend setters went crazy for the opulent bar and restaurant. Fashionably bold and different, and occupying a beautifully restored building that makes the Radisson look business-class dull and the Europa look like a monolith. No word on the rooms, but it's got a great location close to the increasingly popular night time hub of the Cathedral Quarter, and is a short walk from the Waterfront Hall. A serious contender for turning Belfast into a honeymoon location. Perfect for a romantic and/or dirty weekend away.

*'''Merchant Hotel''' [http://www.themerchanthotel.com/], 35-39 Waring St (Cathedral Quarter), +44 28 9023 4888.  The Merchant is an intimate, sumptuous, five star standard hotel. It was opened in April 2006 following an extensive conversion of the old Ulster Bank Headquarters in Waring Street. The architectural grandeur of the exterior and the opulence of the interior with its custom made furniture and carefully chosen antiques, demand an excellence of service and warmth of welcome, that immediately sets guests at ease with an ambiance that embodies luxury and comfort around the clock.  Definitely worth the expense.

===Boutique===

*'''Madison's Hotel''' [http://www.madisonshotel.com/], 59-63 Botanic Ave, +44 28 9050 9800. Set amidst the bustling Botanic Avenue this rather sexy boutique hotel is just a stones throw away from Belfast City Centre, Queens University & Botanic Gardens.  The hotel has an excellent restaurant serving early morning breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner. The main bar in Madison's is popular with locals & tourists alike with live music being played in the bar most nights.  Offering all modern features a guest expects today, Madison's has an established reputation for great food, fine wines, amazing cocktails and fabulous entertainment all under the one roof.

==Stay safe==

Belfast's reputation as a dangerous city is often exaggerated. A recent study by the United Nations International Crime Victimisation Survey (ICVS) shows that Northern Ireland has one of the lowest crime rates in Europe. The majority of incidents are committed by local people against local people, unsurprisingly following religious, sectarian or political differences. Tourists are outside this culture and should not be very concerned. As with any other city, it pays to be careful and always be aware of your surroundings. Do not flash valuables or money or walk around reading your guidebook or map. If you need directions, ask in any shop or bar.

There are areas in Belfast which have been scarred by trouble in the past. Though these areas are largely safe to visit, it is important to be aware of where you are. In nationalist areas of the city, it would be foolish to wear a Glasgow Rangers, England, or Northern Ireland football jersey. In unionist areas, wearing Glasgow Celtic, Republic of Ireland and Gaelic Football (GAA) jerseys would almost certainly lead to trouble. Though this is unlikely to affect tourists, it is best to avoid wearing green or orange or the name of any area, especially Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland or England.

* The '''City Centre''' is generally a safe area and is also regarded as a neutral zone. Avoid leaving the main streets at night and try not to venture into dimly lit streets.

* '''North Belfast''' is not usually on the tourist trail but is becoming increasingly popular with the more adventurous traveller. '''Tiger's Bay''' is a unionist enclave which is generally safe during the day but should be avoided at night. The '''New Lodge''', a nationalist area, is similarly patchy and probably best avoided altogether. The '''Antrim Road''' (including Carlisle Circus) and '''Shore Road''' areas are best avoided at night. The '''Limestone Road''' is an interface (on one side is a nationalist area, the other a unionist enclave) and should be avoided at night due to occasional violence. It is best to avoid the nationalist '''Ardoyne''' area at night, especially the interface area which links it with the Crumlin Road and Shankill areas of the city. 

* '''West Belfast''' is perfectly safe and generally tourist-friendly during the day as long as you don't venture too far from the main roads. Do not venture off the '''Falls Road''' at night. The '''Shankill Road''' itself is best avoided especially at night. The nationalist '''Turf Lodge''' estate in Andersonstown is best avoided altogether. '''Falls Park''' and the area around it is dimly lit at night and is best avoided. The '''Crumlin Road''' is a unionist area and is generally safe during the day but not at night. I also suggest tourists don't write on the Peace Wall not because it is dangerous to do so but highly insensitive to do so. Messages like "tear down this wall" etc are not appreciated by the locals - the wall is there for a reason so be sensible and don't do it !

* '''South Belfast''' is the most affluent part of the city and is generally trouble-free. Student night life can lead to altercations outside the bars and clubs on '''Bradbury Place''' at night. '''Sandy Row''' is a unionist neighbourhood that would probably be best avoided at night but is perfectly safe during the day and usually very quiet. The unionist '''Village''' area which lies further on from Sandy Row between the Lisburn Road and Boucher Road is quiet and residential but best avoided at night. The mixed '''Holylands''' and '''Ormeau Road''' areas do not deserve their reputations as trouble spots as they are generally both very quiet other than the occasional student party.

* '''East Belfast''' is a predominantly unionist, working-class district that suffers from the same social problems as similar areas in other cities in Britain and Ireland. The '''Newtownards Road''' is generally safe and well lit at night. One potential flashpoint is the interface with the nationalist '''Short Strand''' neighbourhood. Though fairly well kept and safe during the day, it is best to avoid this area at night.

Perhaps more importantly, it is not advisable to make any overtly political statements about Northern Ireland, even if you think that your comments will align with the views of the people to whom you're making them. Otherwise, ask locals for advice and enjoy the hospitality of the majority of Belfast people. If anyone asks your opinion (unlikely as it is taboo to keep the peace but still just in case), say you don't have one and don't pay attention to politics.

Like television from south of the border, there are a number of Irish republic radio broadcasts which tend to spill over into Northern Ireland such as Today FM and RTÉ 2FM.

==Get out==

* '''Translink''' [http://www.translink.co.uk/] operate all public transport (Northern Ireland  has been spared the process of privatisation that has made Britain's public transport system so confusing to visitors). Most bus and train services operate out of Belfast, so the city is a perfect base to explore the province.
* On Sundays, '''Northern Ireland Railways''' [http://www.translink.co.uk/] offer the Day Tracker, a £7 ticket (£3.50 concessions) which offers unlimited travel all day across the NIR network.
* '''The [[Giant's Causeway]]''' and the scenic north coast is easily accessible by public train and bus from Belfast. See Translink's website for fare and schedule information. If you have a car take the M2 to Newtownabbey, then the A8 to Larne. From Larne follow the astonishingly beautiful A2 road right along the coast. Leave yourself enough time for a day to meander up to the Giant's Causeway, stopping en route in Cushendall, Cushendun and Ballycastle. A speedier return to Belfast can be made inland from the coast along the A26.
* '''Bangor''' is an attractive seaside town with more than its fair share of good fish and chip shops, and makes for a good day out from the city on a sunny day. Trains from Belfast Great Victoria Street, Botanic and Belfast Central take about twenty minutes.
* The picturesque village of '''[[Hillsborough (Northern Ireland)|Hillsborough]]''' in '''[[County Down]]''' is easily accessible by car or frequent Ulsterbus services from the Europa Buscentre.
