'''Sarnia'''[http://www.sarnia.ca/] is a city in [[Southwestern Ontario]]. With a population of around 90,000 it is the largest city in Lambton County. It is on the south shore of Lake Huron where it empties into the St Clair river, about 100km west of [[London (Ontario)|London]] and 100km north east of [[Detroit]].

Historically home to Ojibwe of the Three Fires Confederacy this area didn't see much European settlement until the discovery of oil in what is now nearby '''Oil Springs''', home of the first commercial oil well in the world. Sarnia's location made it the perfect transportation hub for local industry and its now the perfect base for exploring Lambton County's many recreational and historical sites.

Located on Lake Huron, there are many public-access beaches along the shore. Canatara Park has a large public beach with plenty of parking, although it is known to be somewhat rocky and the water is colder, due to the current of the St. Clair River.
Beaches in Bright's Grove (the most North-East end of Sarnia) are generally sandier and warmer, and there are large areas of public access, notably at Mike Weir Park (the largest public park on Lake Huron, it has a large sandy beach, with parking, playground, baseball diamonds, and sheltered picnic areas) and Kenwick Park (which has tennis courts, a basketball court, playground and sheltered picnic area)

If you have children, The Animal farm in Canatara Park is a hit.  This attraction is free of charge and the animals come right out to greet you.  It's very safe and the whole family will have a ball.  

Canatara Park also has a great beach, hiking trails, and a big park for barbecues or family picnics, sports fields, and a lot of bird wildlife.
