'''Freetown''' is the capital city of [[Sierra Leone]] and is the heart of the [[West (Sierra Leone)|Western region]].  It is on a peninsula on the south bank of the estuary of the Sierra Leone River. The city lies at the foot of the peninsula mountains and faces one of the best natural harbors on the west coast of Africa. The peninsula is home to some of the finest beaches in Africa - Lumley Beach, Lakka Beach, No. 2 River Beach, and Tokeh Beach are some examples.  

==Understand==
[[Image:Freetown_Lakka.JPG|thumb|300px|Lakka Beach]]
Freetown, like the rest of [[Sierra Leone]] has endured some very difficult times during the civil war. It was occupied by rebels twice and the resident population and infrastructure suffered badly. As stability returned to Freetown, many Sierra Leoneans fled the rural areas to the city to escape the carnage. Though the country has been peaceful since 2002, the population of the city is still much higher than it was prior to the war. This has put pressure on land and local services. Many areas of the jungle have been cleared to house the new residents. Some claim that the US government has not helped the situation with their new embassy development at Leicester. Some blame the new developments for severe flooding of the city during the rainy season. Deforestation has also been blamed for a shortage of water in the city.

==Get in==

===By plane===
'''Freetown International Airport''' ({{IATA|FNA}}) ({{ICAO|GFLL}}), in Lungi (''on the other side of the estuary from Freetown''), Tel: (232-22)-338405,[http://www.freetownairport.com/]. Getting from the airport to Freetown can be a challenge and the safety of the various operators has been questioned.  There are a number of fast boat services that cross the estuary, and most foreign visitors use this option for roughly US$40. To pick them up, just walk to the right after exiting the airport building. Sea Coach Express (Pelican Water Taxis) operate small boats, some covered, some not, from Mahera Hotel to the Aberdeen bridge for Le180,000 (40USD). Sea Bird Express is another option (40USD), which you can catch from the airport (they bus to a nearby hotel with a dock) and arrive/depart Freetown from a private terminal in Murray Town. Both Sea Coach and Sea Bird seem safe and are comfortable. The hovercraft service no longer operates.  The hovercraft is abandoned in Man of War Bay, Aberdeen. The Sea Coach Express is convenient for most foreign travellers as it avoids the slow route through the crowded east end of Freetown.  The helicopter now only operates a charter service. 

Another possibility is on the overloaded ferry which runs to the main part of Freetown. A seat on a bus which uses the ferry costs Le60,000.  The bus takes passengers to Rawdon Street in the center of Freetown.  This trip can take 3+ hours and has been known to take 8 hours. By road it is 4+ hours to the city, via Port Loko using some poor roads.

Finally, some private boats cross the estuary. This is not recommended at night.

Unfortunately, thefts from hold baggage are very common at the airport, especially on the way out of the country. Carry anything of value in your cabin luggage. Having your checked baggage wrapped in cellophane at your point of origin is another good tactic.

If arriving at night, as many flights from Europe do, you could get a room at one of the Lungi hotels, which exist mainly for this purpose. Book in advance. If the weather is not storming, it is safe to make the crossing at night. The estuary that you must cross between Lungi and Freetown is quite wide and takes about 30 minutes to cross.

===By train===
[[Sierra Leone]]'s public railway service was closed in 1974.  A railway museum has been opened at Cline Town and is well worth a visit.  Many of the original railway buildings and signs can still be seen in and around Freetown, particularly at Hill Station and Congo Cross.  It is also possible to walk along much of the track bed, starting near the Hill Station Club [http://www.capitalradio.sl/hsc.htm] and dropping down the hill via Congo Cross into Freetown.

===By bus===
Many intercity buses leave Freetown. The Government Bus is highly recommended as being unusually safe and reliable, with no overcrowding or standing allowed. New buses with (intermittent) air conditioning have been purchased in 2015. Prices are low (for example, 20,000 SLL for one person to Bo).

Government buses depart early in the morning from the bus station on Wallace Johnson Street in the downtown area. Passengers start arriving around 5:00am, with queues formed or forming around 5:30am alongside by hawkers selling travel essentials like toiletries, sandals, bread, and mobile phone top-up. Note that different ticket office windows serve different locations - don't miss out on a seat by waiting in the wrong queue. 

The ticket offices may open any time between 6am and 7am, and the buses fill quickly and leave shortly after. It's best to arrive early to be sure of a seat. Tickets are usually numbered manually in pen. Seats themselves aren't always numbered; if they are, it's usually written on in marker pen. Buses usually only depart early in the morning - all buses may have departed by 8am.

Don't be alarmed if a religious preacher gets on a bus to or from Freetown and starts preaching to passengers, or prompts a religious debate. This is quite common.

Checkpoints are not uncommon, particularly when traveling between cities outside of Freetown. Foreigners may be asked to register at the checkpoint, and they will check to see if they have a valid visa. The officer may attempt to solicit a bribe. If this happens, be firm but polite, and insist that your visa is valid. 

===By car===
Many roads in Freetown are being reconstructed as dual carriageways and a bypass road is also being built to link the western part of Freetown to the rest of the country, cutting out the congested eastern part of town.  The roads via Leicester and along the coastal part of the Freetown Peninsula are also under reconstruction.

The road works affect many roads.  Unfortunately, the Sierra Leone Roads Authority have given up maintaining other roads, which means they are increasingly in poor condition.

===By boat===
Freetown has two ports, the downtown port called "Government Wharf" (among various other titles), and the Clinetown port called "Queen Elizabeth II Quay" (which the locals refer to as the "Q.E.II Quay" (i.e., "KYOO-ee-TOO-kee", with most of the emphasis on the "TOO" part). The quay is deep enough to receive cruise ships, but most of its traffic tends to be freight transport— the nearby cement works and flour mill likely regular customers. All cars and machinery also come in through the quay, which has been plagued by corruption in which quay authorities expect those receiving goods to pay exorbitant bribes in order to get their goods released from customs, to the detriment of the economy generally. Pleas from locals to root out this corruption go through bouts of action followed by the return of the bribe business.  

Unless you are picking up or shipping a vehicle or several tons of cement, or perhaps own a ship that has a draught of 30 feet, you are unlikely to have need or desire to visit the Q.E. II Quay, except that the customs office is located there and any foreign travelers who have not entered the country through the airport in Lungi are likely to have no choice (this is highly unlikely, however).  If you are arriving in Freetown by boat and have already cleared customs in Lungi or elsewhere, you are almost certainly going to arrive at the Government Wharf located right in the middle of Freetown's business district or the Kissy ferry terminal in the township of Kissy. The Kissy Ferry Terminal is located to the east and south of the quay and much to the east of the wharf.  It also runs service to and from Lungi, though the township of Kissy is rather less well-kept than the city's downtown area is.

==Get around==
[[Image:Freetown overview map.png|thumb|600px|City overview]]

Local taxis run fixed routes and are shared rides. For the uninitiated, there is no real way to figure out where they are going, and they're busy making a living rather than trying to explain everything to foreigners. But they're so cheap (1,000 leones), you can just hail one and see how long it takes you the right way before making a turn! Empty taxis will assume that foreigners want to charter a taxi (see below) and not share it. To let them know you prefer a shared ride, just declare "no cha cha" when you get on board.

''Poda-podas'' are a more miserable shared ride option, but are more straightforward for longer trips, as they display their start and end points on the front of the vehicle. If only you knew what those landmarks meant! "Lumley" will take you to Lumley Beach via the southern bridge, "Aberdeen" will take you to Aberdeen via the north bridge from Murray Town, "Eastern Police" will take you to the big clock tower at Kissy Road on the East Side (this is a good place to get dropped off to find a poda-poda to Waterloo), and there are others that hopefully other Wikitravellers will figure out and write about here. If you are looking for downtown, locals call it "Tong."

One can approach a taxi and charter it (cha cha) for a few hours, a day, or even days if one wishes. A decent price per hour is about $5, for a day around $50. Taxis can be hired for a complete journey, which really should not exceed the equivalent of $4 for a trip within Freetown. The drivers do expect to be negotiated with, so don't be scared—be cheeky and negotiate! A very convincing bargaining tactic is to let the driver know that, if he gives you a good price and you like his service, you will keep him on your speed dial for longer chartered rides. Having a trusted taxi driver on your phone shortlist is generally a very good idea for female travelers, anyway.

However, if you feel this isn't the route for you, hotel taxis are usually available in much better condition; and they are regulated. These will also cost up to around $10.

Car hire is possible and can normally be arranged through hotels or local car dealerships. They will normally come with a driver. Journeys outside of Freetown often may require a 4-wheel drive vehicle and will cost more, typically $150 plus fuel per day, including driver.

However, if you wish to mingle with the locals—which is encouraged, as it creates more social inclusion—you may be surprised. Local people can help you find your way around town, hire taxis for you, and introduce you to their friends and families and, in some cases, ceremonies taking place. They can also cook for you, as Sierra Leoneans are very hospitable people. Many tourists tend to fall in a trap where they visit and hang around with only familiar people. It's better to see visiting Sierra Leone as a social/cultural holiday, allowing visitors and locals to exchange customs and at the same time experience the "diamond in the rough." Seeing the good and bad parts is what makes visiting Sierra Leone an experience to remember.

==See==
Many of Freetown's attractions are underdeveloped and not well publicized. The relatively low number of tourists visiting has meant there was not an adequate incentive or financial reward for developing them.  However, there are many hidden gems that can be well worth finding.  It is not unusual to be the only visitor to some of them.
[[Image:Freetown_Railway_Museum.jpg|thumb|Railway Museum]]
*'''National Rail museum''', Cline Town.  The museum has several steam/diesel locomotives and carriages, including one used by HM Queen Elizabeth II during her state visit.  All have been restored.  A guide will usually show guests around. Entry is 50Le Open Monday-Saturday 1030-1700.
*'''Tacugama Chimpanzee Sanctuary''', outside Freetown and will require a 4-wheel drive vehicle, aussi possible to go with a keke or with a motorbike, for ~30Le.  Follow the Regent Road through Hill Station and Leicester.  Watch for the entrance on the right. Tel: +232-76-611211, (''email: [mailto:info@tacugama.com info@tacugama.com]'') [http://www.tacugama.com/]. Check their website for up-to-date information about the visits: it is at fixed hours. For foreigners, Le 180 (approx. 15 USD).
*'''Charlotte falls'''
*'''Sierra Leone Peace Museum''', Jomo Kenyatta Rd, Freetown, ph.+232 76819242, [http://www.sierraleonetrc.org/index.php/sierra-leone-peace-museum].
*'''Cape Sierra Leone Lighthouse''', Aberdeen.  Right at the end of the peninsular close to the Barmoi Hotel.  Head towards the new radar tower.  The lighthouse was built in 1812 by the Portuguese.  It is in very good condition (it has been refurbished in 2010).  There are some stunning views of the Atlantic Ocean. If you are lucky, the local staff will show you around.
*'''Hill Station Club''', [http://www.capitalradio.sl/hsc.htm]. Gentleman's Club, dating from colonial times.
*'''Colonial houses on stilts''' at Hill Station.  Most are in a poor state but offer insight into how people lived in the past.

*'''Aberdeen''' part of Freetown will give a break from the busy city center. It's a short drive from any part of Freetown by car/taxi. The roads are passable, but watch the speed bumps on Beach Road and Sir Samuel Lewis Road.  There are small stalls outside of Alex' bar selling 'tourist' fare. There is a fashion boutique at the Family Kingdom. Various other stalls can be found on Lumley Beach Road and in the area of the Mammy Yoko heliport. There are plenty of hawkers on the beach selling sunglasses, fruit, peanuts, clothes, etc.
*'''Bastion des Fort Thornton'''. See the National Monument (a sculpture garden who's are tells the history of Sierra Leone) Entry is Le.15,000 Leones. There is a young man who will walk you through the garden while explaining the stories behind the people and events that the sculptures are erected to remember. A single man created all the art in the entire park, you may see him there.
*'''Sierra Leone National Museum''' (see some amazing historical tribal artifacts)

====Bunce Island====
Bunce Island is arguably the most important historical site in Africa with regard to the history of the United States. Attempts by African Americans to find their ancestry via DNA testing have shown more ties to Sierra Leone than to any other country, and the slave forts of Bunce Island were the busiest in the then-called Rice Coast of Africa, sending countless numbers of captured slaves to the [[South (United States of America)|Carolinas]], [[Georgia (state)|Georgia]], and [[Florida]].

While the ruins are fairly large, they are completely overrun with vegetation and long-awaiting restoration. There is ''no'' development of tourist infrastructure here whatsoever unless you count the guestbook. 

Getting to Bunce Island is simple enough if you are willing to drop at a minimum $150 to charter one of the long wooden fastboats from Kissy Ferry Terminal. For a nice speedboat from Aberdeen, where the speedboats leave for Lungi Airport, you'll need about $300. 

Neither option guarantees much guidance when you actually arrive, though. The 75-some-odd-year-old caretaker, Pa Braima Bangura, retired in 2011, but will still join you if you pick him up in '''Pepel''', the village across the narrow on the north side of the river. He does not, however, speak English, so you'll need a Krio translator. Interestingly, his guidance diverges pretty strongly from the information available on the internet, so you can decide who knows what's what!  The fact is that while some visitors regard Pa Braima as a traditional griot representing the authentic oral traditions of his village, he did not grow up in the area, and doesn't know the local oral traditions regarding Bunce Island. His story of the castle and its buildings derives mainly from what he has learned from the historians and archaeologists who have done research there, except that Pa Braima never fully understood what they told him.

If you want the actual story of Bunce Island, you should go to the Sierra Leone National Museum ''before'' you leave for Bunce Island.  The museum is located just next to the Cotton Tree in downtown Freetown.  The museum has a permanent exhibit on Bunce Island that was produced by an American historian who has been doing research on that subject for many years.  While you're in the museum, don't miss the model of the Bunce Island ruins commissioned in 1947 by Dr. MCF Easmon, the founder of the museum.  Moving back and forth between the model and the section of the exhibit that explains the ruins will give you a lot of information on what the ruins look like today, what those buildings originally looked like, and what their various functions were. And make sure you take a good look in the exhibit at the computer-generated images of the slave castle as it appeared in the year 1805.  Studying those images before you go to Bunce Island will make your trip to the old slave castle a much richer experience.

So, if you are a solo traveler without $150 to blow, this becomes a grueling adventure. One way to get to Bunce Island is to catch a passenger boat (one of the long roofed motorized boats, called "pampas," that take people and goods up and down the harbor like a floating bus) from Big Wharf to the east of Kissy in East End of Freetown straight to Pepel (~$2). There will in all likelihood be only one of these per day, only on weekdays, and it should leave around 3PM or so, so you would need to be there earlier to make sure you get on it. Try to see Bunce Island upon arrival, so you can catch the fast boat back early in the morning, after staying in Pepel with the permission of the chief (budget a good $15-20 in leones so that you are able to pass 10,000 notes to all the necessary hands). Realistically, this won't work, though. So plan to spend the morning going to the island, then return to Pepel and hire a taxi or motorcycle taxi ("okada") to take you on the 90 minute dust-choked journey back to Tagrin (~$5-10) to catch the Ferry to either Kissy or Government Wharf in Freetown. In Pepel you need to bargain the price to get to the island: they might say 500Le at first, but this can very easily be bargained to 200Le, which remains a very good price for them given the short distance. 

There's another rough travel way to get to Bunce Island, though, that's not quite so grueling.  You can take the ferry to Tagrin, then a taxi to Lungi, and then hire a local taxi in Lungi to take you to Pepel.  The taxi trip from Lungi to Pepel takes about an hour and a half one-way (or three hours in both directions).  Then, you can hire a local fisherman in Pepel to take you by canoe to Bunce Island, which takes about half an hour in a paddle boat or five minutes in a local boat with an outboard engine.  Then after you've seen the island, you reverse your steps to return to Freetown.  The major expense in this strategy is the taxi.  You'll need to negotiate a daily rate with a driver in Lungi, which is probably about $50.  But the advantage of this strategy is that if you start off in the morning with the first ferry to Tagrin, you may be able to complete the trip in one day.  And if you have to spend the night, there are a number of hotels and guesthouses in Lungi with a range of quality and prices.  
Also, you can go from Tagrin or from Lungi with a motorbike, the price if you bargain a bit is 60Le (4,5€) one way from Lungi.

On the other hand, you could pay everything at once by hiring a car and driver in Freetown for a day, but then you'll be back to the $150 you'd have paid anyway for a comfortable speedboat trip from Freetown to Bunce Island.

===Beaches===
{{style}}
The beaches are beautiful and unspoiled. Most popular places like Lakka Beach, No. 2 River Beach, and Bureh Beach offer simple but decent accommodations. Poda's (minibuses) will only take you until Lakka junction. If you want to continue with public transportation you'll need to go by okada (motorbike). If you're driving yourself a good vehicle will be required as the road conditions are pretty bad. The peninsular road is currently being reconstructed. The tarmac was complete as far as Goderich in October 2012.  The beaches are often not well sign-posted, so watch carefully or use GPS.  

The following beaches are listed counterclockwise around the peninsular, starting at Aberdeen.

*'''Lumley Beach''' The main public beach close to Freetown itself facing the Atlantic with a white sandy beach, shops, restaurants, hotels, golf course, as well local clubs.  Being closest to town, it is always busy and often quite dirty. Head further if you want to see some fantastic beaches.
*'''Goderich Beach''' Goderich is not known for its beach - most people drive past on the way to other beaches.  Anywhere else, this would be a top attraction.
*'''Lakka Beach''' Takes about 15 minutes driving from Lumley.  Here are many places to eat and sleep. The Hard Rock on the rocky peninsula has great views on the beach and offers, just like Paul's and Club Med, superb fresh seafood. These places also have excellent accommodation. Palm Beach (formally the Cotton Club) is in very bad shape but will soon be renovated.
*'''Hamilton Beach''' Unfortunately this beach has become a mining site.
*'''Sussex Beach''' The popular Franco's restaurant is here. Nice setting, and good food but really bad service.
*'''No. 2 River Beach''' Driving further, for another 20 minutes will get you to No. 2 River Beach.  The villagers have set up a community project to look after this stunning beach and river outfall and everyone will tell you about "helping the community" which is handling the beach, bar, and restaurant. The children have a functioning school and it is the cleanest beach on the peninsula. 

That being said the place is beautiful and If you are old enough to remember the 1970s Taste of Paradise commercial for the Bounty chocolate bar, this is where it was filmed.

From Tokeh junction you'll find yourself driving on an excellent, modern, and smooth paved road. However, the following beaches are also well reached by driving around the other side of the mountains (Bai Bureh Rd), depending on your starting point from Freetown.

*'''Banana Island''' Has only 2 beaches but both are small, secluded and provide a unique getaway experience.
*'''Tokeh Beach''' Amazing white sandy beach which could be the best in West Africa. Has only two resorts. Visit during the day if you are not interested in spending money to stay overnight. The Place Resort is highly recommended. 24-hour electricity, very good wi-fi & food. A small entry fee is to be paid to access Wi-Fi, infinity pool, beach towels & beach beds. Which is quite OK I believe to get access to all these facilities. You can get a room for day use. I paid 100 USD ( 4 of us shared the cost )
*'''York Beach''' Grey sanded beach, but an interesting little fishing village with some old Portuguese remains.
*'''Black Johnson Beach''' Difficult to spot from the main road but look out for signs to Tito's Paradise which is a small beach shack serving food and drink.
*'''John Obey Beach''' Stunning beaches and two small restaurants (if you can find them). Home of the recently settled Tribewanted [http://sierraleone.tribewanted.com] initiative.
*'''Bureh Beach''' Stunning beach and river. Three good restaurants. Try the surf club or dine at Princes. 
*'''Kent Beach''' Besides the beach, Kent has some interesting historical sites. First off there is the 'slavery administration office', where slaves were kept and registered before being them away. You'll find remains of the walls and buildings of this colonial settlement. Secondly, you can visit an old residence of Siaka Stevens.
*'''Mamah Beach'''

Lungi (where the airport is located) also has some excellent beaches, which are often missed by visitors because of the limited accommodation available.

==Learn==
Learn about the national history at the National Museum and the National Monument. Each has guided tours. The National Monument is a sculpture garden that is located near the Presidents government offices. It is said that the President is able to see the garden from his office window.

==Respect== 
It seems that most people don't like talking about the civil war/ "rebel" war, at least in public conversation. So unfortunately don't expect to hear much about that at the museums. One reason for this may be that during the "reconciliation period" after the war the ex-combatants (rebels) were reintegrated into society. Therefore none want to stir up bad memories that could lead to resentment among friends, family, coworkers, or the random guy on the street. That said, the climate is stable and this appears to be how it's kept that way: they are not including this part of Salone's history in school lessons, and simply want to erase the war from the collective memory.

==Work==

==Buy==
Local crafts are inexpensive, some are unique in that they are made from scrap gathered after the war.

==Eat==
Freetown has a few high-quality restaurants, but very little in the tier below that.  Being on the Atlantic coast, some excellent seafood is on offer.  Barracuda, grouper, and lobster are readily available.  Freetown has a large Lebanese community.  Consequently, some very good Lebanese food is available at most restaurants.

==Drink==
Apart from the hotels and restaurants, there are many bars along the beaches, particularly at the Aberdeen end of Lumley Beach.  Man of War Bay in Aberdeen has several popular bars and restaurants, all of which have terraces overlooking the bay.

There are countless small bars along every street, often catering for just a handful of customers.

A "must-see" for any visitor is Paddy's (now Quincy's) on the road into Aberdeen.  This bar is famous and was the only place to be consistently open during the war.  Get a cold Star and enjoy the atmosphere.  Star beer is now available on tap in better bars.  Also worthy of a visit is the Hill Station Club [http://www.capitalradio.sl/hsc.htm] at Hill Station.  This old gentleman's drinking club was looted during the war, but the building itself survived and the bar will be opened for visitors.  If you are lucky you will be allowed to see the snooker room, where the tables appear untouched for many years and old champions' names are still on the sign boards.

On Sir Samuel Lewis Road (same as Quincy's/Paddy's) there is also a small local pub, called Tribes, with a pool table.

*<drink name="Quincy's (Paddy's)" alt="" address="Sir Samuel Lewis Road" directions="Near Aberdeen Bridge" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="">Paddy's was one of the oldest bars/dancehalls in Freetown, undoubtedly recreated in scenes of the film Blood Diamonds. It was closed in 2009 after a decline, but has now been renovated and reopened under new Management as Quincy's. Quincy's serves a small selection of freshly made grilled food with a handful of sides. The bar stays open until dawn and operates as a nightclub. A VIP section was opened in December 2015, allowing customers to party in air conditioned luxury. Two good pool tables are always busy with a great atmosphere.
In their own words, they 'don't close, until you finish drinking!'</drink>

==Sleep==
Freetown has some high-standard hotels.  All in the splurge section will offer air-conditioned rooms with power available 24 hours per day. Most will also have Internet access, with some providing wireless access too.  Hotels in the Aberdeen area are closest to Lumley Beach. There are very few options in the main part of the town itself.  During the busiest time of the year (December-March) it can be hard to find a room, especially with the closure of the Cape Sierra Hotel, Solar Hotel, and Mammy Yoko Hotel (all in Aberdeen).  Booking ahead is advised.

==Stay safe==
Violent crime is rare in Freetown.  However, there have been some incidents in Lumley and Aberdeen, near to the clubs/bars and it's recommended to avoid them at nighttime.  

Petty crime is common - take care of possessions and be wary of leaving valuables in rooms. 

There are currently many pickpockets operating in the neighborhood of "Town Hill" and "Magazine" (an area where there are many street money changers), they are very active. 

Be careful when changing money as it's opening many opportunities to trick you. A small exchange shop is much safer than the street.

Gold dust/diamond scammers are active and targeting foreigners in Freetown, stay away from anyone claiming to own or manage a gold/diamond mine.

Thefts from luggage at the airport on the way out of Sierra Leone are quite common.  Do not leave valuable items in your luggage.

==Cope==
The unrelenting heat and humidity can make life uncomfortable.  For anyone not used to this, an air-conditioned room to sleep in will be almost essential. BBC World Service can be heard on 94.3MHz (FM) and Western-style commercial station Capital Radio [http://www.capitalradio.sl] on 104.9MHz.
