[https://penang.travel '''Penang'''] (Malay: ''Pulau Pinang'')  is an island-state off the northwestern coast of Peninsular [[Malaysia]]. It comprises two halves - Penang Island, where the capital city of [[George Town (Malaysia)|George Town]] is located, and a strip of mainland Peninsula named Seberang Perai (formerly Province Wellesley).

Penang's beaches are nice, though a little lacklustre when compared to those in some other Malaysian states, but this is more than compensated for by the island's rich multicultural history dating back to the beginnings of British colonisation in the 18th. century, and is full of Malay, Chinese, Indian and European influences. Penang is also well known domestically and in [[Singapore]] for being the "food paradise" of Malaysia.

* [[George Town (Malaysia)|George Town]] — the capital city of Penang and is a favourite spot for visitors as it has many attractive pre-Second World War houses and shophouses, as well as 19th century churches, temples, mosques, and colonial buildings. George Town is a UNESCO World Heritage site (it was inscribed as one of the Historic Cities of the Straits of Malacca together with the city of Melaka). The city is clean, safe and well managed. Very walkable as there are pavement along most roads and the condition of the pavement is very good.  Good free maps are available at the Tourist Information Counter located in the centre of the airport arrival halls.  One thing to note is that if you eat in a coffeeshop, you must order a drink even if you don't need one or have your own drink in your backpack. Some coffeeshop levy a RM0.50 (Jul 2015) table charge if no drink has been ordered.

Penang was part of the Malay sultanate of [[Kedah]] until 1786, when Captain Francis Light built a fort at the site of present-day [[Georgetown (Malaysia)|Georgetown]] and managed to get the island ceded to the British East India Company. The island, along with [[Malacca]] and [[Singapore]], was one of the three British Straits Settlements.

The name '''Penang''' comes from the Malay word '''''Pinang''''', means the betel nut (槟榔） tree ''(Areca catechu)''. The name '''''Pulau Pinang''''' translated literally from Malay means "betel nut island". The original name of Penang was ''Pulau Ka-satu'' or "First Island", it was renamed to ''Prince of Wales Island'' on 12 Aug 1786 to commemorate the birthday of the Prince of Wales, later, George IV. During the early and middle part of the last century, Penang Island was also known as "The Pearl of the Orient".

The capital city, '''[[Georgetown (Malaysia)|Georgetown]]''', was named after King George III of Great Britain. Today, Penang Island is Malaysia's second largest city and has the highest population density in [[Malaysia]]. In addition, Penang is the only state where the ethnic Chinese are the majority. Penang also has the third-largest economy amongst the states of [[Malaysia]], after [[Selangor]] and [[Johor]], incredibly for its tiny size.

The cargo trade has largely shifted down to [[Port Klang]] and [[Singapore]] since Penang lost its free-port status in 1969, but now Penang makes a good living off tourism and electronics manufacturing. The multi-national corporations that operate factories in Penang's Free Trade Zones include Intel, AMD, AVX, BBraun, Dell, Flextronics, Agilent, Osram, Motorola, Seagate, and Jabil Circuit. Penang was granted Cyber-City status on 21 June, 2004. At the World Heritage Committee Session in July 2008, Georgetown and [[Malacca]] were listed as [[UNESCO World Heritage Sites]].

===Orientation===
The state of Penang is made up of two parts, Penang Island, a turtle-shaped island in the Straits of Malacca 8km west of Peninsular Malaysia, and Seberang Perai (formerly Province Wellesley), a rectangular-shaped district that is situated on Peninsular Malaysia. 

[[Georgetown (Malaysia)|Georgetown]] is Penang's capital city and Malaysia's second largest city. It is located on Penang Island. Development of the east coast of the island is slowly linking Georgetown, in the northeast, to the industrial town of Bayan Lepas in the southeast, thereby urbanising the entire eastern seaboard of Penang Island. The northern coast, including [[Batu Ferringhi]], is also being heavily developed and features the island's best beaches and resorts. The island's western side is still relatively undeveloped and has a serene "kampung" (village) feel about it.

===Climate===
Penang like the rest of Malaysia has an equatorial climate. Monthly temperatures vary only about 1&deg;C throughout the year, typically daily between 24&deg;C and 32&deg;C, with humidity to match. Annual rainfall is about 2400mm which mostly arrives in short sharp bursts. The driest months are usually January to March, but visiting is OK all year perhaps with the exception of the Sumatra burning season which arrives anytime July to September for several weeks or longer.

===When to go===
[[Image:Dragon_Boats.JPG|thumb|300px|Dragon boat competition, normally held in May/June]]

Penang's '''high season''' is around Christmas, New Year's Day, and Chinese New Year (check the lunar calendar; it could fall on the end of January or early to mid February), when the east coast of Malaysia is drenched and hordes of sun-seeking tourists descend on the island. Accommodation tends to be packed, and priced accordingly.

==Get around==

===Walking===

One of the best ways to sight see is to walk around Georgetown; but wear light clothes, start early in the morning, and put on plenty of sun-block during the daytime. When crossing the roads, remember to look both ways, even on a one-way street. 
Walking tours are available by local residents and Georgetown personalities, arrangement can be made direct or through hotels or guest houses.  Individual tours usually start at 9.00 am and are tailored to suit.

===By bus===

RapidPenang [http://www.rapidpg.com.my/], the local bus service, features new buses. All bus stations and bus stops which are serviced by the RapidPenang buses are labeled with proper signboards to ensure user-friendliness. Buses are somewhat frequent on the main artery to [[Batu Ferringhi]]. Rapid Penang bus 101 bound for Teluk Bahang goes through midtown Pulau Tikus, (northwest end of) Gurney Drive, Tanjung Tokong, Tanjung Bungah, [[Batu Ferringhi]] and terminates at the Penang National Park entrance. Avoid so-called 'minibuses' because they usually go as far as Tanjung Bungah and can be poorly maintained. 

Be aware that you have to hand over the exact fare, as the driver doesn't have change (of course you can pay more and resign the change). So when arriving e.g. at Penang airport from abroad, you won't get far with your freshly ATM-dispensed RM 50 notes. The fare from the airport to KOMTAR is RM 2.70, so buy a snack or similar in the arrival hall.

Rapid Penang bus 203 and 204 to Air Itam (RM1.50 adult) departs westward on Lebuh Chulia (the main backpacker hotel road) or southbound from the KOMTAR building are handy for visiting both Kek Lok Si Temple and Penang Hill (Bukit Bendera) Funiciular Base Station, approximately 30mins south west of the city centre. The driver will inform you of when to alight. Bus 204 departs from the funicular base station to return to Komtar and onward.

The main hub for buses in [[Georgetown (Malaysia)|Georgetown]] is KOMTAR, the tallest building in town. The secondary hub is located at the Pengkalan Weld (Weld Quay) ferry terminal. All buses depart from the ferry terminal will stopover at KOMTAR, but city centre-bound buses destined for KOMTAR may not go all the way to the ferry terminal; ask the bus operator. There is a new long-distance bus terminal at Sungai Nibong, refer to '''[[Penang#by bus|by bus]]''' entry.

Municipal Council of Penang Island [http://www.mppp.gov.my] provides a '''free CAT shuttle bus''' hop on hop off service in [[Georgetown (Malaysia)|Georgetown]] which runs approximately between the Pengkalan Weld ferry terminal and KOMTAR every 20 min daily 6AM-12am, (including Sundays & public holidays). Visit [http://www.mppp.gov.my/cat] for more details.  An unofficial route map detailing the location of the CAT shuttle bus stops can be found here [https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&oe=UTF8&msa=0&msid=110373835700622206958.0004611d0cb2d3a8e8808].

Also, foreigners can purchase a Rapid Passport [http://www.rapidpg.com.my/tourist-passport/how-it-works/] for only RM30 and enjoy a week of unlimited travel onboard all rapid Penang buses.

RapidPenang has a very useful mobile app MyRapid Pulse which features a GPS powered route planner and updated arrival/departure times based on the GPS equipped on the busses. Enter your route first to see the bus locations.

This website [http://www.penang-traveltips.com/rapid-penang-bus-routes.htm] gives a useful list of bus numbers, their destinations, and route maps.

The Penang Hop On Hop Off buses services [http://www.myhoponhopoff.com/pg/index.php?pageid=1] offers value for money - RM45 for a 24 hour pass if you intend to be out and about in the island, covering most tourist attractions.

===By trishaw===

These three-wheeled human-powered vehicles might be the best idea for a pleasant city tour. One can stop at any point to take a photo or buy souvenirs. Many trishaw riders are also excellent 'tour guides'. Negotiate the fare first before getting on a trishaw; it is advisable to hire them by the hour(around Myr30 per hour) for extended sightseeing.

=== By car ===

Car rentals may be a viable option, especially if you are planning to get off the beaten track and explore the rural western or southern coast of the island. Take note that Penang Island has quite a number of one-way streets and narrow roads. Many Penangites ride motorbikes and quite many of them have disregard for pedestrians, cars, and even their own lives, so you must be very careful when driving on the roads. Avoid driving during the rush hours between 7:30-9:30AM and 5:30-7:30PM. Motorcycle riders can be undisciplined and tourists should be extra vigilant of them.

===Taxis===

Taxis in Penang are equipped with meters but most drivers are reluctant to use the meters. Always haggle with the taxi driver and agree on a price beforehand.

At some high-end hotels, particularly on Batu Ferringhi, you may find blue SUVs marked "Teksi Executif" (Executive Taxi). These taxis do use the meter, but are hard to find on the streets.

As of May 2013, a taxi from the Queensbay Mall to Georgetown will cost MYR30 fixed (drivers around the mall will refuse to use the meter), though a bus ticket (bus 401E and others in the 300 series) are plentiful and cost MYR2.

Grab, a ride-hailing app similar to Uber, is used extensively in Penang. Prices are relatively cheap. For instance, a trip from Penang Airport to the northern end of Georgetown may cost only MYR21. Airport taxis have a surcharge and will cost you MYR50 and up to get to Georgetown (April 2016).

==Talk==

Almost all locals in Penang are able to speak [[Malay Phrasebook|Malay]], the national language of Malaysia. The ethnic Chinese in Penang (who form the majority here) usually speak a localized variant of [[Minnan phrasebook|Hokkien]] known as Penang Hokkien, which Minnan speakers from [[Taiwan]] and [[Fujian]] may have some difficulty understanding due to the slang and some loan words from Malay. Most ethnic Chinese are also able to speak [[Chinese phrasebook|Mandarin]], and many are also able to speak [[Cantonese phrasebook|Cantonese]] and Hakka. Teochew is mainly spoken in Seberang Perai, the mainland side of Penang. Ethnic Indians usually converse with each other in [[Tamil phrasebook|Tamil]] and ethnic Malays usually converse with each other in [[Malay Phrasebook|Malay]], but a good number of Indian and Malay Penangites can also converse in Hokkien.

'''English''' is spoken fluently by most professionals and businessmen, as well as by service staff working in hotels and tourist attractions. Most other locals are able to communicate in broken English, supplemented by non-verbal forms of communication such as pointing and gesturing. When in doubt, gravitate toward younger locals, as English is a required subject in Malaysian schools. Nearly all teenagers or adults in their 20s or 30s are able to communicate with you in English.

''See [[Georgetown (Malaysia)|Georgetown]] for detailed attractions located in town.

* '''UNESCO World Heritage Zone & Armenian Street''', old historical area in the heart of the UNESCO Heritage Zone in downtown Georgetown. The area contains a melange of late 19th century colonial and settler architecture, texturized by a community that still maintains a traditional way of urban life. For walking, highlights include Armenian Street, Pitt Street, Love Lane, Little India, the esplanade and Beach Road. Within this area, the Khoo Kongsi clan temple, Kapitan Keling Mosque, and Pinang Peranakan Mansion are highlights. A small flea market starts every evening at the park near the Armenian Street & Lebuh Acheh junction (pickpocket alert). Mostly, its used second hand junk for sale, but there may be the occasional find. Further towards Penang Road, the Cheong Fatt Tze mansion on Leith Street that exemplifies early Chinese courtyard houses is also a favorite.

* '''Penang Street Art''', [http://www.penang-discovery.com/attraction/mural_wall_art/] In conjuction with Penang’s Georgetown Festival, certain old walls within our dear capital has gained a new lease of life, thanks to the awesome efforts of Lithuanian artist, Ernest Zacharevic, Penang Street Art artist.

* <see name="Penang Hill / Bukit Bendera" alt="升旗山" address="Penang Hill"directions="" phone="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">Probably has the best view of [[Georgetown (Malaysia)|Georgetown]], especially at night. Go up via the Penang Hill Railway (Return fare: Malaysians - Adult RM10, Child RM4; foreign tourists: Adult RM30, Child RM15). The train takes 5 minutes to reach the summit. The service runs from 6:30AM-9PM daily, accessible by taxi or Rapid Penang bus no. 204 to the last stop (RM2). The train, which was upgraded in 2011, is a fascinating little cable train service that lifts you out of the heat and humidity of the coastal plain and up to a fabulous view and cool breezes. The 19th-century English travel writer, Isabella Bird, called the temperature on the hill 'delicious' because it can be very much cooler than at sea level. More than a century later, Ms. Bird's statement still holds true. The more adventurous (and fit) may want to hike up the hill (800m elevation, bring water). Starting points for a trek up the hill is from the tarred road at the entrance of the Botanic Gardens (the more adventurous can start from the Moon Gate 300m from the entrance of the Botanic Gardens but trails are not well marked so best to follow a local during weekends/evenings). The hike takes about 2-3 hrs depending on fitness level. At the summit, you can take a leisurely stroll, or ride a buggy, along a track that runs for about 1km into residences built around turn of the 20th century. Food and refreshments can be found in the David Brown restaurant, which commands a nice view of Georgetown, or the food court. </see>

* <see name="Kek Lok Si-Temple of Supreme Bliss" alt="极乐寺" address="" directions="" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="" email="" fax="">A sprawling hillside structure that is reputed to be the largest Buddhist temple in South-East Asia, with the Khmer/Thai/Chinese style '''Ban Po Thar''' (Ten Thousand Buddhas Tower) and various Buddha images in the main temple complex. Furthermore, a mini-funicular train (RM4) connects to the summit of the hill featuring a giant 36.5m high statue of '''Kuan Yin''', the Goddess of Mercy. The current bronze version was completed after donations from mainland Chinese in 2003. Photographers will find it well worth the inclined elevator ride up. During the Chinese New Year period, the temple is decorated with hundreds of lanterns which turns it into a night-time wonderland. Located near the village of Air Itam; a taxi from [[Georgetown (Malaysia)|Georgetown]] will set you back RM 20-25; catching a bus from the station next to the Komtar or 7-Eleven at Lebuh Chulia will cost you RM4 (take Rapid Penang bus no. 203/201 to Air Itam, the last stop). The complex reeks of commercialism with shops at every level and Buddhists may find little sacred at this site. Try to avoid the busy weekends. During the fifteen days of Chinese New Year the temple is colourfully lit and opened to the throngs of tourist and worshippers till 11pm.</see>

Legend has it that Chor Soo Kong, who was also a healer, gave shelter to the snakes of jungle. After the completion of the temple, snakes appeared on their own accord. Today, the snake population of the Temple of the Azure Cloud is very small, due to the urbanization of the area, but you can still see them coiled up on the altar tables, and you can touch them, if you are brave enough.

Located at southeastern tip of Penang, it is a large military fortress built in 1930s by the British to protect the southern approaches to the island. The British Royal Engineers and a work force of local laborers blasted and dug into the hill to create a fort with underground military tunnels, an intelligence and logistic centre, halls, offices, ventilation shafts, artillery firing bays, sleeping quarters, cook houses as well as an infirmary. The site lay abandoned for 60 years before it was reopened by a private entrepreneur. Historical accuracy should not be the prime motivation for visitors, with the attraction being quite kitschy and generous with self-researched "facts".

There are also two walk-through aviaries and a fish pond. Some of the enclosures do need a touch of paint, but kids should love this place. Open daily from 9AM-7PM 

* '''Amazing Nibong Tebal'''. See the synchronised flashes of light gently hovering over mangrove trees that line the river bank. The specific species of mangrove tree which attracts these fireflies is the berembang (sonneratia caseolaris).

The fireflies emit light at the lower abdomen not only to attract mates but also to scare away predators. Their abdomens are filled with a chemical called lucibufagens which in fact tastes pretty nasty.

==Eat==

Penang offers plenty of delicious and cheap Malaysian food, but is famed throughout the rest of the country for some specialities such as ''Char Kway Teow'', Penang ''Laksa'', and ''Nasi Kandar'', which are found practically everywhere on the island. Penang is an island of countless food stalls, a veritable "food paradise". It is known to many around Asia for its culinary originality and diversity. However, Penangites find good food in many places usually unknown (and even odd) to tourists. 

The best way to find good food is to ask the locals. Don't be surprised that some stalls that are set up beside a busy road or coffee shops located in some inconspicuous back alley are considered to serve very good food by the locals, sometimes even under a tree! The rule of thumb is to be adventurous with your tongue and to look at the condition of the stall and its surroundings. Generally, if a stall is being patronised by many locals, the food will be good to eat.

''For restaurant listings, see [[Georgetown (Malaysia)|Georgetown]], [[Batu Ferringhi]], etc.''

For the most well-known ''Char Kway Teow'', try "Sister's Char Koay Teow" at ''Macalister Road''. Sister's Char Koay Teow however, is widely regarded as overpriced, overrated and unfriendly service by most locals. More popular albeit still relatively expensive Char Koay Teow can be found at Lorong Selamat together with a wide variety of other stalls which are popular with both locals and tourists alike. 

*'''Bao Sheng Durian Farm'''- A king of fruit experience in an organic durian farm. Located in Balik Pulau, Bao Sheng Durian Farm first opened in 1959 after ‘Durian Seng’s’ father - Chang Fatt Hin discovered durian grafting. Today, the farm is managed by his son who switched the 6.7-acre durian farm to organic farming practices free from harmful pesticides. Now coming to their 3rd generation of durian farmers, Durian Seng a.k.a Cheng Teik Seng together with his son and wife manage the durian farm that comes fully equipped with Standard Villa, Deluxe Villa, Tatami Room and pristine swimming pools.

===Penang cuisine===
If you've been travelling in Singapore or elsewhere in Malaysia, you'll see some familiar names, but don't be fooled:  Penang ''laksa'' or ''hokkien mee'' are quite different from what you'd get in, say, [[Kuala Lumpur]] or [[Singapore]].  Topping the list are:

*'''Mee Sotong''' - Hameed’s spicy Mee Rebus, noodles served with a fishy, spicy sauce made with chilli and cuttle fish, has been at the Kota Selera Hawker Center in Padang Kota Lama (Fort Cornwallis) for nearly 30 years.

* '''Assam Laksa''' (亚三叻沙）- A far cry from the sweet, coconutty [[Singapore]] version, this noodle soup comes with sour broth flavored with tamarind (''assam'') with pureed fish, fruits, veggies and a generous helping of chili mixed in. Watch out, the combination is powerful and will have the uninitiated breathing fire! Famous assam laksa include Balik Pulau New Market, Air Itam market, Gottlieb Road, Gurney Drive, etc.  

* '''Penang Char Koay Teow (炒馃条)''' - The definitive version of the ubiquitous stir-fried flat rice noodles, tossed with bean sprouts, cockles, and anything else the chef has handy. Eggs are additional and cockles can be opt out, if preferred by the customer; request when placing order. Some say the best Char Koay Teow can be found at Lorong Selamat but it costs at least RM8 per plate and that only if you have the patience of a saint to wait for it. Another choice is Ah Leng Char Koay Teow and the Char Koay Teow in Bukit Emas Restaurant, Seberang Perai.

* '''Penang Nasi Kandar''' - White rice (nasi) with anything else that you want with it! Usually served with fried chicken, fried fish, prawns, squid, hardboiled eggs, various vegetables, and a curry (which is poured onto the rice). Be careful though! Taking too many of the 'side dishes' can be quite expensive. Can be found at various places around Georgetown. The most popular restaurant selling nasi kandar is Nasi Kandar Line Clear in Penang Road , Restoran Kapitan at Chulia Street and Kayu Nasi Kandar in the Bayan Lepas area.

* '''Hokkien Mee''' - Two types of noodles in prawn and pork soup with slices of pork, prawns, hard boiled egg, vegetable, beans sprout and sprinkling of deep fried shallots.

* '''Koay Teow Th'ng''' （粿条汤）- Flat rice noodles (Koay Teow) in clear chicken soup (Th'ng) with slices of chicken, pork and fish cake. Garnish with chopped spring onions. Some places have duck meat and other organ meats as extras. Some say the shops in Hutton Lane and a couple of shops opposite Tandoori House are a good choices for this dish. You can also get good KTT at Gurney Drive, though at higher prices.

* '''''Lobak''''', or ''Lorbak'' （卤肉）- Minced pork wrapped in tofu skin) - Very famous in Penang, Lorbak is similar to sausage (''Lor'' means a kind of sauce whereas ''bak'' means meat in Hokkien). You can choose the accompanying servings of prawn fritters, tofu, fish cakes, Taiwan sausages, century egg (preserved duck egg, unique taste and texture. Usually eaten with pickled young ginger) and others. Locals dip Lorbak in sweet sauce and chilli sauce. Can be found in rather consistent quality all over Penang. Also available at Gurney Drive's hawker centre and New World Park.

* '''Penang Sar Hor Fun (炒河粉)''' - A local dish with koay teow (flat rice cakes) in a delicious broth of beaten eggs and seafood bits. Goes best with pickled green chillies.

* '''Seafood ''' - As you might expect on an island, '''seafood''' is abundant. Head for the fishing village of '''''Teluk Bahang''''' in the north, or go to '''''Batu Maung''''' / '''''Teluk Kumbar''''' in the south for fresh fare at local prices. You can also get good seafood at Batu Ferringhi beach.

* '''Or Chen''' (''Oyster Omelette'') （Chinese：蚝煎）- This is a popular dish available in multiple locations all around Georgetown. The food centre at Gurney Drive is a tourist-friendly place to get an oyster omelette. It is next to the Gurney Plaza shopping centre and a stone's throw away from G Hotel.  Expect to queue for ten to fifteen minutes; the price ranges from RM 8 to RM 16 depending on the portion you are ordering.

* '''Pasembor''' (''Indian mixed fruits'') - Despite its name, this dish does not contain any fruit. Basically it is cucumber plus your chosen ingredients covered in spicy peanut sauce. You can choose to add squid, sausage, tofu, local crackers, crabs, potato, eggs, and fish cake, among other possibilities. Prices range from RM 5 to RM 20, depending on the ingredients you want on your pasembor. Available at the food centre at Gurney Drive.

* '''Lor Mee''' (''Noodles'')卤面 - A bowl of yellow noodles in sticky brown coloured sauce. Unique to this part of Malaysia and a must try, lor mee can be found on the road called "Lebuh Presgrave" in town. There is a little link house converted to a restaurant that serves them. Also available in other hawker centres. Depending on the cook, it may or may not contain innards such as intestines, stomach, and liver. You can ask them first and if they do serve innards, you may request a serving without them. Lor mee are commonly served with shreds of chicken breast and some pork slices. Prices range from RM 3 to RM 6.

* '''Satay''' (''Malay: sate'') 沙爹- the famous meat-on-a-stick, is a traditional Malay food typically made from marinated meat - chicken, mutton or beef, skewered onto bamboo sticks and grilled over hot charcoals. A fresh salad of cucumbers & onions are served together with a spicy-sweet peanut dipping sauce for dipping.

===Traditional foods===

* Nutmeg, (豆蔻) products - In traditional medicine, nutmeg oil or balm were used for illnesses related to the nervous and digestive systems. Preserved nutmeg strips either in dry or wet form are used as a snack by locals.

* Traditional biscuits such as ''Tambun Pneah'' (淡文饼), ''Beh Teh Sor'' (马蹄酥), ''Heong Pneah'' (香饼), ''Pong Pneah'' (清糖饼), ''Tau Sar Pneah'' (豆沙饼) and etc.

Desserts include:

* '''Kaya''', (''a type of jam'') - A mixture of eggs and cocount milk to be spread over anything you want. According to some, the best kaya is at a little coffee shop at the end of Madras Lane. To impress the locals, order some kaya toast and dip it in some half-boiled egg.

* '''Coconut tart''' - If you have eaten egg tart before then instead of the egg put in some coconut and voila! You get coconut tart and definitely the best is at Cintra Lane.

* '''Cendol''' - A mixture of blended ice with big mushy red beans with gula melaka (brown sugar)added. This will satisfy anyone even if it is raining. Cendol can be found anywhere but the best is at Penang Road.

* ''' Durian Fruit '''榴梿 - Penang's durian is unique in the world. Best way to eat is at the stall (don't try to take it back to your hotel). They open the durian for you. You pay what you eat. The medium durian will cost RM8-15. You don't have to worry about buying rotten durians. Stalls are usually located by the roadside next to durian plantations, along the road from Teluk Bahang (almoust end station of bus 101) to Balik Pulau (end station of bus 401E or 401), and along the road from Air Itam to Relau. Within Georgetown, there is one at Jalan Anson, opposite Jl Dunlop, and another along Jl Macalister.

And wash it all down with some...

* '''''Teh Tarik''''' (literally, Pulled Tea) - This sweet tea-with-milk drink is "pulled" by the vendor, that is, the drink is poured into the serving cup from a can/pot that is moved from near the cup to a considerable height above it. This is repeated until frothy. (Like most Malaysian drinks, it's very sweet, but you can ask for "less sweet" (or "kurang manis" in Malay) - and it won't be quite so sweet.) Enjoy at any ''Mamak'' (Indian Muslim) stall or restaurant along Penang Road in the evening, chit chat with friends, while watching the culture of Penangites.

==Stay safe==

Penang is a relatively safe place for travellers, however it has its share of crime. Apply common sense as you would when you're at your home country. Precautions should be taken to guard against snatch-thieves, pickpockets and scams. Some other precautions:

* Avoid walking alone or be extra cautious in deserted places, alleys, and streets, especially after dark. Love Lane has become safer in the last few years, when it was a red-light strip but muggings and snatch-thefts can occasionally happen. Some suburbs like Jelutong have higher crime rates but these are usually off the tourist trail.

* Don't accept rides from unlicensed unmarked taxis known as ''Kereta Sapu''. Be wary of strangers offering a ride in their car.

* Be wary when carrying valuables (camera, handbags, etc.) in motorbike or bicycle baskets. Thieves (usually also on motorcycles) may target these when you're stopped at a traffic light.

* Use the safe in your hotel room if available to store valuables. Do not leave valuables in your car.

* Be careful when placing your cellphone, handbag, camera, valuables on the table when dining at roadside stalls, food courts, or open-air restaurants. Quick fingered thieves may walk by and swipe them when you are not looking...

* Do be wary of purse-snatchers - especially when wearing jewelry and/or carrying bags. Some of these felons practice the art of 'ride-by' grabbing handbags which can result in serious injury to the victim. So ladies: walk against traffic and keep the handbag on the side away from the road or better still, don't carry one. Safety in numbers may apply.

* Do be wary of the (sometimes aggressive) long-tail macaques at the botanical gardens. Don't eat when entering the gardens. The monkeys love food (including ice-cream) and may try to get it..

* Look out for men who grope people on the bus (it happens to both male and females!).  In the event this happens, get off the bus to a fairly populated, well lit street, in the event the perpetrator may choose to follow you.  You can easily look help from other locals or the 'Polis' (police).

* Be careful about your surroundings in waters off Batu Feringhi beach, where you may be harmed by unregulated & haphazardly piloted jet skis and/at other water activities. Jellyfish (including the rarely seen but dangerous box jellyfish) can be a risk at certain times of the year. Be careful for strong currents off Kerachut Beach during the monsoon season (usually June-Oct). The sea off Kerachut Beach may be infested with jellyfish during certain months, so swimming during this times is not advisable.

* Look both ways when crossing the road. Do not assume vehicles will stop for you at pedestrian crossings.

* But don't be too paranoid and enjoy Penang.

* Be careful with street food. Easy to get food poisoning.

==Get out==

* [[Pulau Aman]] - A small island between the first Penang Bridge and the new bridge. The ferry is at Batu Kawan's Batu Musang Jetty (you need own transport to get there- 45 min drive from Georgetown). The 5 min boat trip costs RM6 for a return journey. From Mon-Fri the boat departs Batu Musang for Pulau Aman at 10am, 1pm, 4pm and 7pm. The trip from Pulau Aman for Bukit Tambun at 8am, 12noon, 3pm and 6pm. On weekends, the boats are always running. For enquiries, you can contact the Seberang Perai Fishermen Association at +604 397 9796 or +604 530 7185. Most locals come here to enjoy the live Mantis Prawn of your choice (relatively cheap vs price on Penang island) and bring to the restaurant for them to steam. The Mee Udang is popular too. There's also some hiking treks and it's a good place for fishing.

* [[Alor Star]] - capital of [[Kedah]] state

* [[Hat Yai]] - South Thailand

* [[Ipoh]] - capital of [[Perak]] State

* [[Kota Bharu]] - capital of [[Kelantan]] State

* [[Perhentian Islands]] - [[Pulau Perhentian]]. Many agents, including guest houses, in Georgetown sell transfers to the islands which includes minibus transfer and a two-way ferry ticket (140RM August 2014), to travel indpendently requires a bus to Kota Bahru followed by a second bus to Kuals Besut for the boat jetty to the islands so this makes sense. You can leave Georgetown at 5am (hotel pickup) and be on the islands by midday.

* [[Langkawi|Pulau Langkawi (Langkawi Island)]]

* [[Taiping]]- a town in north Perak State

* [[Phuket]]- South Thailand 

* [[Medan]] - on Sumatra, Indonesia. There is no longer a ferry to Medan, as the price of flights to Medan became cheaper than the ferry. You can fly to Medan with several airlines.

* [[Bangkok]] - If planning going on into Thailand, your best bet is to hop on the Butterworth-Bangkok International Express. It's dirt cheap (RM112-lower berth), very comfortable, super clean sheets, and blankets laundered after each use) and wide cosy beds. Train leaves everyday at 14:20 from Butterworth Station and arrives in Bangkok just about time for lunch the next day. You can, of course, jump off at Surat Thani (if going to the islands of Ko Samui and Phang Nga), arriving in the wee hours of the night like 03:00 or 04:00, as well as Hua Hin around 07:00. It's not worth your while for short trips such as Hat Yai because all tickets are charged at sleeping berth prices and your berth is only made ready at the Hat Yai station stopover.
