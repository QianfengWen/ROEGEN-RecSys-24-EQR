== Get around ==

=== On foot ===
Biarritz is very pedestrianised, and it is easy to get around the town centre, to the beaches, and to the best spots for surfing or shopping. This means whatever your holiday needs is a short and pleasant walking distance away. However, it can be quite hilly in places.

=== By bus ===
There is an excellent bus network, since 2011 called Chronoplus ([[[http://www.chronoplus.eu]]] for timetables and routes), serving Biarritz as well as the neighbouring Anglet and Bayonne (which form a conubation called 'BAB'). Bus journeys are a flat one euro (€1) payable in cash on the bus.This ticket is valid for one hour to allow passengers inter-change between bus services and routes.
Cheaper multiple journey tickets are also available from the bus kiosks at Biarritz Mairie (beside the tourist office) and at Bayonne Mairie, but cannot be bought on the bus. These include a 10-journey ticket (€8); a seven-day travel pass (€11); and a 24-hour pass (€2). These tickets are also sold at 39 tobacco shops/cafes in the Biarritz-Anglet-Bayonne (BAB) area.

Bus Line C links the '''airport''' with the Biarritz train station at La Negresse and the main Bayonne train station. The slightly less frequent No 8 bus also serves the Airport every 20-30 minutes.

== See ==
Biarritz is famous for its coast and the rocks in the sea.
There is the church of Sainte Eugenie, a Russian Orthodox church, and the Museum of the Sea (entrance about €6) with a lot of interesting animals like different kinds of fish, anemones, sharks, and seals in aquariums. Other topics include fishing in the last centuries, birds, catching whales.
Then there is a Museum of Asian Art and a lighthouse (entrance €2).

== Do ==

The beaches are excellent and this is a major surf resort. The main beach, Grand Plage, gets very crowded, but there is also a long surfers' beach on the Boulevard du Prince de Galles, called Cote de Basque, that has almost no sand at high tide, but is superb at low tide. The surf beaches at Anglet are easily accessible by bus, and surfboards that aren't too big are allowed on the local buses in the summer at least. There is a small beach by the Esplanade du Porte Vieux that is good for swimming when the surfer's beach is closed.

There are several thalasso-therapy centers, with sea water, seaweed and related treatments.

* '''Thermes Marins''', Rue de Madrid.  Offer a reasonable half-day pass for € 17, including use of warm sea water pools, sauna, and steam room. The sauna is rather worn, but serviceable.

There are several places to go clubbing in Biarritz. One recommended club is La Copa, which is located in the centre of the town. Nearby are also several bars, suitable for a pub crawl night, a must do when you visit Biarritz.
