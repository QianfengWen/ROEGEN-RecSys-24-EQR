===History===
Batumi is one of the oldest cities in Georgia founded as early as BC. Its initial form – Batus – had already been mentioned in the 4th century BC. The name must have derived from the Greek word meaning ‘deep’. Aristotle (4th c BC) Pliny (2nd c AD) and others called the place “Pontus Bathea”. In antique times the local population used to have active trade relations with the neighboring as well as distant countries. During the reign of the Roman Emperor Hadrian (2nd c AD) there used to be a Roman military camp on the territory of present Batumi.

Batumi has always been distinguished by a favorable natural and strategic location. From the 18th century Batumi was under Ottoman rule. After the Turkish-Russian war of 1877-1878 and the resulting Berlin Treaty, Batumi became a part of Georgia. In 1878-1886, Batumi Port was announced as “Porto Franco”, something that fostered the further development of the city. After the construction of the Baku – Batumi railway system in 1883, the reconstruction of the Batumi port and connection to Baku via pipelines in 1897-1907, Batumi became an important sea terminal along the Black Sea coast. In 1918 and 1920 the city was governed by the Ottomans and the British respectively.

Batumi's varied past has considerably contributed to the city's architectural diversity, with a number of interesting projects accomplished by European architects during the Porto Franco period. During the soviet and post-soviet period it became a popular seaport and tourist city.

===Climate===
Batumi is distinguished by a seacoast humid subtropical climate. Winters are cold without snow and summers are warm to hot. The average annual temperature is 15 C, 7 C in January and 23 C in August. Annual precipitation is 2.560 mm. Relative humidity is 81%. There are frequent showers. It rarely snows, and when it does it melts very quickly. The average annual water temperature is 17 C at the shore. Cool breezes blowing from the sea moderate the temperature in the summer. A small natural lake is located in Batumi in the 6 May Park. Various types of subtropical plants are spread throughout Batumi and its vicinity. There are many cultivated parks, tea plantations and citrus plantations. Indigenous Colchis natural trees and shrubs have been preserved in select areas around the region.

Most Georgians do not use central heating, so although the day temperature can be warm, bring warm clothes for sleeping at night.

===Cuisine===
Local cuisine is distinguished by its diversity and cooking technology, table-laying and relevant rituals. It has always been complemented with fruit, viticulture and bee keeping products as well as local fish. There are almost 150 types of dishes registered in the region. The cuisine has numerous Asian influences. Dairy products are prevalent in the highlands. The most popular local dishes are: borano (cheese melted in butter), chirbuli (breakfast with eggs and walnut) and sinori (a dish with cottage curds and dough plates). A visit to Batumi is unimaginable without Ajarian khachapuri, a dish with a distinctive shape. The bread bowl resembles a boat, while an egg yolk inside represents the sun. Varieties of local sweet pastry are also famous, especially baklava and shakarlama (sugar pastry).

===Currency and payment===
In Georgia all payments are realized in a national currency - Georgian Lari (GEL). The most common method of payments is by cash, especially in regions and village.

===By bus===
Buses and minibuses (marshutkas) operate regularly between Batumi and [[Tbilisi]]. Travel time is between 6 and 7 hours depending on stops. The fare is 25 Lari. The scenery along the way is interesting.  The best place to take the marshutka in Tbilisi is from Didube metro station, exit the station and you will get bombarded by people asking where you are going, just tell them and they will find you the right bus.  They leave approximately every hour.  But they will wait until the bus has enough passengers on it before they leave.  The ride can be a bit rough, so if you get travel sick, definitely take something for it before you leave.

On the Batumi - Kutaisi route there are frequent minibuses. The fare is 10 Lari (one way). Recently (sep2019) the drivers started charging tourists 50% more = 15 Lari. In Kutaisi they may refer you to an office, where an English speaking lady will tell you the price is 15 lari. She will insist. According to the Tourist Office this is illegal. Advice: just take a seat in the bus and hand over a 10 Lari bill to the driver. If he does not accept, just take the next bus.

4-5 times daily large size buses also operate between Batumi and [[Trabzon]], [[Turkey]] for 25 Lari, with stops in [[Rize]] and the border crossing at [[Sarpi]]. Make sure you meet all visa requirements before crossing the border into [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. After the 1st of January 2015, you will need to apply for a visa online to enter Turkey. If coming from Turkey, your bus might leave you at the border (Sarpi). You will be able to find a marshutka on the Georgian side (Sarpi) going to Batumi for 1GEL. The marshutka goes all the way to Tbilisi Square in Batumi, but you can hop off before that if you wish. There will be ATMs and money changers in Sarpi once you go through Georgian customs. 

There are two Marshutka stations. One has long distance minibuses to [[Kutaisi]], [[Tbilisi]], [[Poti]], etc. The other, on Tbilisi Square, has marshutkas to [[Sarpi]] (2 GEL, 20 minutes). Marshutka, or minibuses, from Borjomi arrive at the Argo Cable Car station opposite Techno Boom.

If you arrive as a tourist at the Batumi bus Station and need a taxi, you may well find that none of the taxi drivers will offer you less than a quite inflated tourist price. Downloading the Uber or Bolt app or similar app before you arrive and making a booking via the app on a nearby wifi will help you avoid these exorbitant tourist prices.

Western Georgia has plenty of local flavors, but in Batumi the dish you '''must''' try is a special kind of ''khachapuri'' named ''acharuli khachapuri'' (Ajarian khachapuri) that resembles a viking boat, with the cheese all mixed up with an egg in the center. Avoid this one if you have high cholesterol, but you'll be missing out - it's absolutely delicious.
