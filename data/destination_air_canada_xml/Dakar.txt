'''Dakar''' is the capital of [[Senegal]].

==Understand==
The Senegalese are very proud of their reputation for "teranga" — hospitality. Locals are extremely friendly and helpful; but as anywhere else, watch out for scams and pickpockets. Petty crime here is relatively high, be cautious. While some locals are friendly, be careful, because local shop owners are very persistent.<br>
Dakar was founded in 1857 when the French built a fort on the site of the modern Place de l’Indépendance to the interests of merchants. 
The city’s name comes from "dakhar", a Wolof name for the tamarind tree and the name of a coastal Lebu village, that was located south of what is now the first pier. The city is crossed by rivers of Gambia and Sénégal.<br>
For many years Dakar was home for the annual desert rally, which was first held in 1977 as Paris-Dakar Rally. In the past, the rally was held on the rally tracks of Southern Europe, in the mountains and deserts of northern Africa until 2007. Since 2009 the Dakar Rally had been taking place on the South American continent and starting from 2020 in Western Asia[https://www.dakar.com/en/]. The final stage of the rally took place around Lac Rose, a red salt lake in the north of the Dakar peninsula.<br>
Dakar is the economic and cultural center of Senegal. It is currently experiencing strong economic development, with high rise buildings being constructed in the more affluent parts of town (e.g. city center, Almadies, Ouakam). If you watch Google Streetview from a few years back you will hardly recognise some parts of the city as building activity is so strong. Dakar has restaurants of all kinds. In downtown (Plateau), you can find sushi places with Western prices. In the more popular neighbourhoods, such as Yoff or NGor, you can find local food, typically fish, rice and vegetables, at very affordable prices.<br>
The disadvantage of the building activity is that public infrastructure, in particular roads and public transport, is not being invested in at the same rhythm. Dakar is heading for a mobility crisis. Still, a lot is being done, with a new regional train line connecting Dakar to Rufisque, which is supposed to be prolonged to the new airport. Highways have been built and are in good condition.<br>

==Get in==
Dakar is a major West African hub, so there are lots of flights coming from and going to Europe, North America, and other African cities. Be prepared to arrive and leave at any time of the night or day — many flights come in at around 2 and leave at around 4 AM.

===By plane===
Blaise Diagne International Airport (AIBD; airport code DSS) opened in December 2017, taking over from the current hub, Léopold Sédar Senghor (DKR). Unfortunately, due to extremely aggressive security measures (hand-searching every bag of every passenger) without adequate staffing, AIDB is currently experiencing severe delays (up to 2.5h)

'''From/To Airport'''<br />
AIDB is situated around 50 km from Dakar City Center. '''A railway link is not yet finished'''. Thus, AIBD can be reached by Bus or Taxi.

The DDD Bus Nr. 404 links the City with the Airport. It runs app. each 0.5h between 08:00 and 22:00. the line starts at the Station "Palace 2", goes via "Place d'Independance" and then takes the Toll-Road to AIDB. A journey costs 1'000 CFA/Pers. Another option (as of June 2019) is to take the Dem Dikk AC bus from the airport (busses are waiting right outside to the right as you exit the main terminal) that costs 6,000CFA with a route that ends in the terminal in Grande Yoff (location: 14°44'40.4"N 17°27'16.1"W) across from the Stade Léopold Sédar Senghor. From there, you can grab any of the waiting taxis to wherever you are staying in the city. Taxi to Médina or Plateu for a single person should not cost more than 2000CFA depending on how patient you are and your French/Wolof, though a more probable price will probably end up being in the 3,000CFA range. 

Plenty of Taxis and Coaches can be found that drive to the Airport. Expect fares of about 15'000 CFA per cab or more. The journey takes about 60 minutes under good conditions, or more if your driver gets confused (many don't know their way around the new airport). Be prepared to give them directions and help them read the signs. Drivers will ask whether you are happy to go the 'fast way' via the toll roads as you are expected to pay the tolls as part of your total fare at the end of the journey. Often they will try to charge you much more than theypaid for the tolls. If in doubt ask to see the app on which they paid (all tolls are paid via this app) where you will see the amount they actually paid; look carefully at the time and date as they may try to show you old fares. At night follow the route on your phone and be extremely wary of your driver turning the oposite way down unlit and deserted streets. Always agree the price before getting in the taxi. 

'''Flight operators'''<br />

===By rail===
The rail service connecting Dakar and [[Koulikoro]] in [[Mali]], once stopping at many cities in Senegal, has been cancelled indefinitely.

===By bus===
The main method of travel around the country is by ''sept places'' (from French, "seven seats," literally questionable station wagons in which they will pack seven people so that you are basically sitting on the next person's lap throughout the journey). You can also come with a group and rent out an entire ''sept place'', but this will be expensive. If you are obviously a tourist, they will try to rip you off, so make sure to set a price before you agree to a driver. There are set prices to often-travelled locations.

[[Image:Senegal_137.jpg|thumb|300px|Place de l'Independance]]
===By Bus===
The Dakar bus system, known as Dakar Demm Dikk (Dakar coming and going), is fairly dependable.  Fares are 150 CFA, and there are no transfer.  Unfortunately, there's not much of a map of the bus system. But multiple Apps (such as "[https://talibi.net Talibi]") make up for the lack of maps.

The number 10 bus runs along the Corniche de l'Ouest and turns into the suburbs at Rue Aime Cesaire. The number 1 bus runs along the VDN.

'''Cars Rapides'''. These are the usually blue, yellow or white mini-buses that careen through Dakar and some of Senegal's other cities.  There are somewhat fixed rates for certain distances, but you need to check with a Senegalese beforehand. As of 2011 150
CFA would cover most destinations.  To find out where one is going, flag it down and shout out your destination at the apprenti, the boy in charge of collecting fares who hangs out the back.  If she shouts back at you the destination you want, signal it to stop and hop aboard.  To stop, bang loudly on the side of the bus, on the roof or signal to the apprenti you want off. Apprenti's don't always speak French, so be prepared to communicate otherwise if you do not speak Wolof.

===By taxi===
Cheap and safe and everywhere. All taxi fares are negotiated beforehand and will require bargaining.  If you're not from Senegal, it is best to check with locals before to get an idea of what they pay, in order to know what you will be able to get. Make sure your taxi has the right change as well before departing. Leave tips when you feel the service was good.

===By car===
Besides the large rental companies small companies offer cars at reasonable prices.

==Get around==
Bus no. 85 from terminus Liberte 5 goes straight to the pink lake. It takes around 2h 30m.
Second option is bus no. 73 from Keur Massar. This is probably faster option if you are in the downtown (take the "highway" bus to Keur Massar).

Ferries can be taken from the terminal north of Place de l'Independance (very close to the Dakar Railway Station). IMPORTANT NOTE: as of June 2019 you must present your passport to the port guard to be allowed to enter. A copy of your passport will not be accepted, no matter how much you try to explain, that you did not previously know. The trip takes about 20 minutes. The ferry schedule can be found [http://www.portdakar.sn/en/nos-services/trafic-passager/dakar-goree]. The ferries leave on time. There are many small restaurants and a handful of places offering to lodge. This is a place of a great atmosphere because it gives you kind of a pirate-island (with friendly folks all-over kind of feeling). Just walk around and explore. It is a small island, so you can easily stroll around it in an hour. You can buy cheap beer and lounge on the beach when you're after strolling or buy an artwork from the locals.</see>

==Buy==
*'''Ecobank''' with banking operations in 36 African countries. has Mastercard visa card ATMs all over Senegal.

*'''Islam Couture/ Embroidery''' Dakar has some amazing (and amazingly expensive) stores specialized in haute-couture, embroidered traditional west African Muslim clothes.  

*'''Marche Sandaga''' Madness. A decrepit concrete structure that has - despite appearance - three levels of activity: meat and vegetable stalls on the main floor, fish in the basement dungeon, and - surprise - restaurant stalls on the roof. You will need to brave the crumpled stairs and step around guys cleaning dead chicken to make it up. Around the market building a sprawling network of stalls offer everything from copied music CDs, Manchester United shirts, electronic gadgets, and Islamic books - but be aware the hawkers can be ''very'' aggressive. The place is also famous for [[pickpockets]], so take only the amount of money you need and keep it in a safe place.

*'''Marche HLM''' A smaller market geared primarily towards fabric vendors, Marche HLM is slightly less crazy than Sandaga. Hundreds of options for fabric that you can buy and then get tailored into perfectly fitting traditional Senegalese wear (if you will be in Dakar for a while, ask a Senegalese person who his or her tailor is, and go there. A little less convenient for travelers who will only be staying a week). Most vendors won't sell less than 3 to 6 meters of fabric. A reasonable price for local 'African decorated' cotton fabric is 1000CFA/yards, rather than meters.  There are several types, qualities, and styles and the price range is 3,500cfa/4,000cfa for 6 yards of 'wax,' Sotiba, Afritex, and a few others are 1,000cfa a yard, imported tye-dye called 'thioup' from Mali is 9,000cfa for plain colors, 15,000cfa/18,000 up to 25,000cfa for best quality elaborately hand-dyed fabric.  It comes in plastic packages, 4 yards with two pieces of cloth. The price is based on quality rather than decoration.

* '''Marche Kermel''', near the city center in the area across the street from Casino supermarket, Marche Kermel is a smaller market than Sandiga but has better quality artisanal goods, from ostrich leather attaché cases, crocodile belts & camel wallets, to antique African masks and beautiful bronze sculptures both made locally and imported from Burkino Faso. It is also high-quality (expensive and beautiful) imported handmade textiles from Ghana. This market also has an extensive fresh seafood market featuring the largest shrimp (Cameroon) and lobsters to be found in Dakar as well as grouper (called thiouf), red snapper (called rougette), organic chicken (free range from farms) and meat.  The market is clean and well kept and the vegetables, fruit and fresh flowers are also sold there as well.  Marche Kermel, although it is a traditional African market, the design of the building (round) makes it an interesting place to shop and the quality of the goods are as you would expect in any grocery store anywhere in Dakar.  

* '''Soumbedioune''', a popular evening fish market. There is also a "Village Artisanal" nearby where especially tourists can buy hand-made African jewelry, wooden decoration elements, and much more. Be prepared to bargain.

==Stay safe==
Petty crime in Dakar is relatively low; crime against tourists is common, even around Place de l'Independance. Use common sense: women should not walk around alone after dark. Watch your pockets in crowded places, such as Sandaga, and keep a close eye on your belongings. There are many different scams to get money from tourists, so be wary.  The African favorite 'I work at your hotel and have run out of fuel, please can I borrow €10' etc. are common, so don't be fooled.

Avoid the beaches at night. Try not to wear any outwardly expensive items of clothing or jewelry. Generally, the Senegalese are not violent. Some people turn to stealing so that they can drink and eat. Overall, though, the Senegalese are an incredibly friendly and hospitable people and you will meet many people who are interested in talking to you.

Senegal is one of the most politically stable countries in Africa. The police force is useless for your safety, although they all speak French hence are good to ask for directions.

You should particularly avoid walking in the evenings (or nights) along the Corniche, particularly the stretch between the International School of Dakar and the Club Olympique.

Another place where you want to pay attention is in the vicinity of the gare routière, where you would typically only go when travelling to other parts of the country. This is a poor neighbourhood and your cab driver may ask you to lock the doors of the car from the inside. Pay attention to your belongings.

Overall, Dakar is a very safe city. You will get charged too much, but this is typically the worst that is going to happen.

==Cope==
There are many beggars in Dakar, and so this can be an uncomfortable situation. One way to handle it is with a simple, polite "ba BEN-een yohn" ("next time" in Wolof). They may be persistent, but be firm without being rude. Another option is to give the talibes food. Also, keep in mind the Islamic tradition of giving daily - after you've given once, you can say, "sah-RAHK-sah AH-gah-nah," which means "charity has already been done."

==Get out==
Traveling outside of Dakar can be manic and harrowing, but is definitely worth it.
* [[Saint-Louis]] &mdash; The old French capital of Senegal, St. Louis is on the northern border, near [[Mauritania]], and has fantastic colonial architecture and nightlife. A popular destination for travelers. Near many bird parks. A ticket in a mini bus from Gare Routiere Des Baux Maraichers should cost around 5,500CFA
* Sine Saloum Delta &mdash; Just north of the border with the [[Gambia]], the Delta has amazing mangrove forests that you can tour by pirogue (essentially a motored canoe). Negotiate a fair price with a guide, and remember that once you get into the Delta, it's difficult and expensive to get around any way besides by pirogue.
* [[Casamance]] &mdash; The southernmost region of Senegal, the Casamance boasts some of the most spectacular beaches and friendliest people in the country. 
* [[Ziguinchor]] - nice to visit but not much to do. Cap Skirring is the main tourist destination, and there are many hostels as well as a Club Med ("Club Merde" as the locals call it). The Casamance has been involved in a secessionist conflict for years; though the warring factions do not purposely attack tourists, there have been tourist deaths. The overnight ferry from Dakar to Ziguinchor is affordable and comfortable.
** Details on the ferry:  The boat leaves from Dakar on Tuesdays and Fridays at 8PM and from Zig on Thursdays and Sundays at 3PM, arriving 15-17 hours later.  Office hours in Dakar are M-Friday, business hours with a break for lunch.  To purchase tickets, you must go to either the port in Dakar or the one in Zig. You cannot buy tickets online or over the phone. Bring your passport to purchase. Advance purchase is advised, if possible, but not always necessary. The price for a couchette in a two-person room is 30,500 and for a four-person room is 28,500. Both include a private bath and breakfast. Dakar ticket office tel. +221 33 821 29 00. They will give you information on availability, prices and office hours.
* [[Touba]] &mdash; Senegal's religious center, Touba makes a great day trip. Unfortunately, non-Muslims are no longer allowed inside the mosque, which is enormous. Women will be asked to wear long skirts and cover their heads to tour the grounds.
* [[Mbour]] a seat in a sept place to Mbour should cost around 1,800CFA from the Gare Routiere Des Baux Maraichers.
