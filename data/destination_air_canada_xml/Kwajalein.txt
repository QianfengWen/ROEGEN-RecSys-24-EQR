'''Kwajalein''' is an atoll in the [[Marshall Islands]].

Although a restricted US Department of Defense missile research and testing site, and not accessible to the general public, Kwajalein is home to around 1,800 Americans who live and work there. There is a fully functioning community including bank, post office, shops, schools and a small hospital, as well as buildings and installments to support the US military mission.
