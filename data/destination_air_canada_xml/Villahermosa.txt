'''Villahermosa''' is the capital city of the state of [[Tabasco]] in [[Mexico]].

==Understand==
Recently the city became rich because oil has been found in the area. The search for oil resulted also in the finding of artifacts of the Olmec culture.

==Get in==

===By plane===
'''Carlos Rovirosa Pérez International Airport (VSA)''' is a 15 min drive from the city and is a small international Airport with not so many connections. Some main flights are Mexico City, Merida, Monterrey, Cancun, Houston, and Panama City.

===By car===
The city lies at the highways 180 and 195.

===By bus===
Inter-city bus service is available to surrounding cities including [[Ciudad del Carmen]] and [[Palenque]] on [http://www.ado.com.mx Grupo ADO].

==Get around==
===By bus===

There are two main streets in Villahermosa, Av. Gregorio Mendez and Av. 27 de Febrero, these are the two main routes for public transportation.
Mini-buses and especially combis (refurbished small VW vans) are widely used by locals at a price of 5.5 pesos. Stops are fixed as well as routes. Feel free to ask (in Spanish) the driver if he is going close to your destination. You will see destinations written on the windshields.

===By taxi===
People also rely on a network of collective taxis. As a tourist, you should ask the driver if he is going by your destination. Prices vary by distance but a 10-15 minute ride should be around 20 pesos in a yellow taxi and 40 pesos in a white taxi.

Taxis are collective but in no way have pre-established routes. You tell the driver where you want to go and if the taxi is empty he should take you and if during the way to your destination someone else happens to go somewhere close to where you are going he will hop in the taxi and continue. It is advisable then to always try and sit in the front seat. About prices, anywhere in the city is 20 pesos in a yellow taxi, 40 pesos in a white taxi. It doesn't matter where in the city you are going. Many Taxis will stop even if they have a passenger, and ask you where you are going. If you are headed in the same direction or near the same direction as the original passenger, he will take you as well. You do not get a discount if he has a passenger, the price is the same.

Currently most taxis do not allow passengers in the front seat and don't work collective. The far for a ride in town or from the bus station to town is a more or less fixed 40 pesos per car.
