'''Muskegon''' is a city in [[West Michigan]].

==Get in==
Muskegon is located at the western terminus of the interstate highway, I-96. It is roughly 30 miles NW of [[Grand Rapids]], via I-96. Also, US-31 runs north/south through Muskegon. Some travelers arrive by airplane through the Muskegon Country Airport (MKG). As of the summer of 2004, Muskegon reconnected with Milwaukee, WI across the lake by a high-speed car ferry which makes three round trips a day during the summer season. The Greyhound Bus System also has a stop in downtown Muskegon.

==Get around==
While in Muskegon, most visitors prefer to get from point A to point B by car - while locals may sometimes opt to use the Muskegon Area Transit System (MATS). During summer months, MATS provides trolley services around both the Lake Michigan and Muskegon Lake areas. Because of its proximity to award-winning beaches, visitors are highly encouraged to bring bicycles along for there are plenty of bike trails which run in the city and plenty throughout the county.  A notable trail is the Musketawa bike trail [http://www.musketawatrail.org/] which runs from just southeast of the city through the countryside to the city of Marne in Ottawa county.

==See==
The Pere Marquette Beach on the shores of Lake Michigan and adjoining the Muskegon Lake Channel is the only nationally certified "Clean Beach" on the Great Lakes.  Miles of beach, gorgeous sunsets, outdoor dining possibilities, and a recently-completed bike trail make this beach a must-see.

The Muskegon Museum of Art deservedly is touted as one of the finest art museums in the Midwest. Among the highlights of its permanent collection is "Tornado Over Kansas," by John Steuart Curry (one of three leading painters, along with Grant Wood and Thomas Hart Benton, identified as Regionalists and known for their canvases celebrating the rural Midwest.)

Muskegon is also the home of the Great Lakes Naval Memorial and Museum, which features the USS Silversides, a World War II submarine; the USS LST 393, a World War II amphibious landing ship; and the USCGC McLane, a Prohibition-era United States Coast Guard cutter.

In addition, Muskegon also berths the S.S. Milwaukee Clipper a former car ferry that traveled the same route as Lake Express does today. The boat is in the middle of a long process of being restored to its original form, but in the mean time is open for tours and hosts a museum aboard the vessel with information on both the Milwaukee Clipper, as well as the history of Maritime in Muskegon. Muskegon’s entire history surrounds around being a port for commerce or travel, and this is an image the city has embraced.

The Muskegon Area Sports Hall of Fame exhibits, detailing the area's rich athletic past, are on display at the L.C. Walker Arena.
