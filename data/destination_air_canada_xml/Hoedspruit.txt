'''Hoedspruit''' lies in the Valley of the Olifants in Big 5 Country close to the [[Kruger National Park]] and surrounded by Big 5 Game Lodges and Private Nature Reserves like [[Timbavati]], [[Balule]], [[Thornybush]], [[Kapama]] and [[Klaserie]].  It is quite possible to fly into Hoedspruit, and travel straight to the local private game reserves without venturing near to Hoedspruit town.

==Get in==

=== By plane ===

Hoedspruit Eastgate airport is a a left turn from the R40 about 7km south of the town. You have to go through a gate into the reserve, but if you look like you are on the way to a flight the guard will wave you through. There are no signposted to the airport from Hoedspruit.

The airstrip in the centre of town isn't the airport, and has no commercial scheduled flights.

==Get around==

The town itself is small, and would be easy to walk around.  However, the attractions of the area don't lie in the town itself, and public transport is limited.  So you almost certainly need to hire a car or be on an arranged tour or transfer.

There are various private transfer companies such as Eastgate Safaris.

There are a couple of car hire companies in Hoedspruit such as Avis and Europcar.

It is sensible to pre-arrange your car-hire before you arrive.  There are many companies on-line which will help you to arrange your car hire:

* Avis [http://www.avis.com/]
* Europcar [http://www.europcar.com/]

Over the past six years Hoedspruit has grown and now has a number of shopping centres.  

There is a tourist shopping centre called the Kamogelo Centre just on the right as you turn from the R40 into Hoedspruit.  There are jewellers, pubs, restaurants, travel agents and souvenir shops.  Fuel and other supplies are readily available.
