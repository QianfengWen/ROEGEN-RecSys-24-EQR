'''Lubumbashi''' is the second largest city in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] with a population of 1,374,000 and the principal city of the [[Katanga]] region.

==Understand==

Creole Swahili is the principal language of the Copperbelt mining cities and is somewhat more different from classical East African Swahili than that spoken elsewhere along the eastern edge of Congo. Most people can communicate in French, and many of the elite are more at ease in French than Swahili. English is widely spoken in businesses.

==Get in==
===By plane===

Lubumbashi is served internationally by South African Airways, Kenya Airways, Ethiopian Airlines and Zambian Airways. Flights within Congo D. R. are offered by Hewa Bora Airways [http://www.hba.cd/], Korongo Airlines (operated by Brusselsairlines) and by CAA [http://www.caacongo.com/].

===By car/truck===
Travel by car is totally discouraged as the roads in the Congo are of quite poor quality and you risk being attacked in the remoteness around Lubumbashi.

===By bus===
Connections via Zambia to Dar es Salaam and to South Africa.

===By train===
Freight trains connect to [[Zambia]], Dilolo to the west on the Angolan border in Katanga province, Ilebo to the far northwest in [[Kasai]] Province with river transport on to Kinshasa, and via Kamina to Kindu and Kalemie (Lake Tanganyika border with Tanzania) to the north. Passenger service is infrequent and slow without international connections. Angola is completing rebuilding of the link from Dilolo to the ocean at Lobito after decades of war, and a direct rail link to [[Kinshasa]], connecting on to the Atlantic coast, is again being planned.

==Get around==
Unless you are a local your only means of travel around the city is by foot but if you can handle try driving a 4x4 car or a jeep.

==Contact==
You can buy a SIM card or an entirely new cell phone from one of the roadside stands, or you can use your current phone plan. Although it is sometimes difficult to find a signal, it is sometimes successful and rates are not outrageous.

ONT (National Tourist Organisation): Ave. Kabila 64 (2eme etage), Batiment LAC; helpful Mme. Jenny, phone 0997147872.

SNCC Lubumbashi (train station): phone 081409515159 chef de consigne, very helpful with timetable.

==Get out==
The safest way to leave by using the direct rail link to kinshasa and leave at Njili airport which might cost a lot of dollars so it's best you leave the way you came.

Comment:
There is no "direct rail link to Kinshasa", the railway only goes as far as Ilebo (very rare, from where you have to find a boat via Badundu to Kinshasa or get a shared taxi to Kikwit and then Kinshasa), and about every 15 to 30 days trains to Kananga, Kindu and Kalemie.
