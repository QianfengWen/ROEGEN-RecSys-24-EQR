[[Image:Kobe Port Night.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Port of Kobe]]
[http://www.feel-kobe.jp/english/ '''Kōbe'''](神戸) is a city in the [[Hyogo]] Perfecture of [[Japan]].

==Understand==
A cosmopolitan port city with an international flavor, hemmed in by Mt. Rokko, Kōbe is often ranked as the best place for expatriates to live in Japan. The city has a population of over 1.5 million people.

===History===
A port in what would become Kōbe was established as a concession to western powers in 1868, during the time when Japan was opening to the western world. Nagasaki and Yokohama had already begun serving foreign ships nine years earlier. Today, a synagogue, Japan's first mosque, Japan's first Sikh temple, a Chinatown, and European architecture mark Kōbe as a place where foreigners and foreign culture first arrived in Japan.

====Great Hanshin Earthquake====
At 5:46 AM JST on January 17, 1995, the Great Hanshin Earthquake, measuring 7.3 on the Richter Scale, struck near the city. The quake killed 6,433 people, made 300,000 people homeless and destroyed 10,000 buildings and large parts of the port facilities, and toppled the the Hanshin Expressway, an elevated freeway. It was one of the most costly natural disasters in modern history. However, visitors will not see any of the aftermath of the quake as the city has been restored.

===By plane===
[[File:Kobe Airport 01.jpg|thumbnail|right|Kobe Airport is on reclaimed land]]
'''[http://www.kairport.co.jp/ Kobe Airport]''' (神戸空港,  {{IATA|UKB}})), built on reclaimed land in front of the harbor, opened in February of 2006. The airport handles domestic flights only: both Japan Airlines (JAL) and All Nippon Airways (ANA) have flights to Kobe from [[Tokyo]] Haneda, [[Sapporo]], [[Sendai]], [[Okinawa]], and [[Kagoshima]]. ANA also offers service from [[Niigata]], while JAL has flights from [[Kumamoto]]. A low-cost airline, [http://www.skymark.co.jp/en/index.html Skymark], operates cheap flights to/from [[Tokyo]], [[Naha]], [[Ibaraki]], [[Kagoshima]], [[Nagasaki]], and [[Sapporo]].

From Kobe Airport, the [http://www.kairport.co.jp/eng/access/pub_port.html Port Liner light rail] to Sannomiya Station runs about every 10 minutes (18 minutes, ¥330). Sannomiya Station offers connections to the Japan Rail (JR), Hanshin, Hankyu and subway lines. From there, a small trip on the subway will link you to the Shin-Kobe bullet train station (¥200). If coming ''from'' Sannomiya to the airport, be sure to board a train marked "Kobe Airport", as some head to the Kita Futo branch line instead.

'''[[Kansai International Airport]]''' is 70km from Kobe and is the nearest international airport. The fastest way to get there is on the [http://www.kobe-access.co.jp/ Kaijo Access] high-speed ferry from Kobe Airport, which runs every 45 minutes (29 minutes, ¥1,500). However, if you are coming from or going to Sannomiya Station or Rokko Island, it's nearly as fast and less of a hassle to take the [http://www.okkbus.co.jp/en/timetable/kix/f_kob.html Airport Limousine bus] (60-75 minutes, ¥1,980 one-way, ¥3,080 round-trip). Alternatively, you can take the JR ''Kanku Kaisoku'' (関空快速) rapid to Osaka station and change there to the ''Shin-kaisoku'' (新快速 - Special Rapid) that runs to both Sannomiya and Kobe stations (90 minutes, ¥2,410).

'''Itami Airport''', officially known as '''Osaka International Airport''' is 30 km northeast of Kobe. [http://www.okkbus.co.jp/en/timetable/itm/f_kob.html Airport buses] operate service to/from Sannomiya Station (40 minutes, ¥1,050).

===By train===
The central business district and many attractions are near Sannomiya station, 1.7km south of Shin-Kobe Station. Sannomiya station has a tourist information office well-stocked with area maps. Be sure to ask for the coupon book, which offers discounts of 10% to 20% for many attractions. The Japanese characters for Sannomiya station on Japan Railways (三ノ宮) differ from the Sannomiya station on other railways (三宮).

The nearest station on Japan's high-speed ''shinkansen'' network is at '''Shin-Kobe''' station.
From [[Tokyo]] station, Shin-Kobe is 2 hours, 50 minutes away via ''Nozomi'' (¥14,670); 3 hours and 20 minutes via ''Hikari'' (¥14,270; no charge with the Japan Rail Pass). From Shin-Kobe station, take the Seishin Yamate subway line one stop to Sannomiya (¥200).

From [[Osaka]], there are several ways to arrive in Sannomiya:
* Trains on the '''Hankyu''' and '''Hanshin''' private lines depart respectively from Hankyu-Umeda and Hanshin-Umeda stations. The ''Tokkyu'' (特急) express takes roughly half an hour to reach Sannomiya (¥310).

* '''Hanshin''' trains also operate to Kobe from Namba station. ''Kaisoku Kyuko'' (快速急行) trains depart every 20 minutes, reaching Sannomiya in 45 minutes at a cost of ¥400. In some instances you may have to change trains at Amagasaki.

* The best option via JR is to take the ''Shin-kaisoku'' (新快速 - Special Rapid) or ''Kaisoku'' (快速 - Rapid) service that departs from '''JR Osaka''' station, running to Sannomiya in 20 and 26 minutes, respectively (¥390, no charge with the Japan Rail Pass).

From [[Kyoto]], Sannomiya is 50 minutes away from the main train station via ''Shin-kaisoku'' (¥1050; no charge with the Japan Rail Pass). You can also make the run to the area in 30 minutes via bullet train, but it is more expensive, and if you have the rail pass, you can only take one train every hour without changing trains (the ''Hikari'' that runs through to [[Okayama]]). 

From the '''central area''' of Kyoto (near Gion and the shopping district), you can reach Sannomiya in 70 minutes via Hankyu limited express, changing once at Juso station (¥600). Hankyu trains depart from the Kawaramachi and Karasuma stations.

From [[Nara]], direct Kintetsu trains operate to Sannomiya Station on the Hanshin line via [[Namba]] every 20 minutes (75 minutes, ¥940).

===By bus===
Buses from Tokyo follow either the Tomei Expressway or the Chuo Expressway to [[Nagoya]], then the Meishin Expressway in the direction of Kobe. Trips take 9-10 hours and tickets can be bought online. Buses have either a 1x1x1 seat layout, or a cheaper 2x2 seat layout. Fares vary and are cheaper if purchased in advance.

'''[http://willerexpress.com/en/ Willer Express]''' operates overnight buses with 2 different seating layouts. Willer's '''Japan Bus Pass''' is valid on all routes with some exceptions. Buses leave from Tokyo station and Tokyo Disneyland. The drop off point in Kobe is near Sannomiya station. Fares are generally in the range of ¥5,000-6,500, depending on seating option, advance purchase, and demand.

'''[http://www.kakuyasubus.jp/kanto_kansai/index.html JR Bus (Japanese Website)]''' operates overnight services from Tokyo to Kobe. The drawback is that online reservations must be made in Japanese, but you can make reservations in train stations at the same "Midori-no-Madoguchi" ticket windows used to reserve seats on trains. Buses depart from '''Tokyo Station''' - Yaesu Exit (八重洲口) and the '''JR Highway Bus Terminal''' (JR高速バスターミナル) adjacent to Yoyogi Station on the Yamanote Line (one stop south of Shinjuku). Buses stop in Kobe at the Sannomiya Bus Terminal (三宮バスターミナル).
Fares are generally in the range of ¥6,000-7,500, depending on seating option, advance purchase, and demand.

There are no daytime JR Buses to Kobe, and the entire Tokyo-Kobe run is not vaild with the Japan Rail Pass. In these cases you can take a JR Bus to Osaka Station (covered with the Rail Pass) and then take a 20 minute ride by JR train to Sannomiya.

The Japan Rail Pass CAN be used for overnight trips on standard buses between Tokyo and '''Osaka''' called "Dream" services - once you arrive in Osaka the next morning you can take a 20 minute ride by JR train to Sannomiya. Overnight buses between Tokyo and Kobe are NOT valid with the rail pass.

'''[http://honyaku.j-server.com/LUCKEISEIB/ns/tl.cgi/http://www.keiseibus.co.jp/kousoku_night/02.html?SLANG=ja&TLANG=en&XMODE=0&XCHARSET=utf-8&XJSID=0 Keisei Bus]''' operates service to/from Tokyo Station and Tokyo Disneyland leaving Tokyo Station at 23:00 and arriving at Sannomiya Station at 8:00AM (9 hours, ¥9,100)

Other operators such as Hankyu Bus, Hanshin Bus, Keio Bus, and Shinki Bus operate service to/from Tokyo but are more expensive, less comfortable, and cannot be booked in English.

===By boat===

Several ferry services are available from Kobe, including routes to/from:

* [[Takamatsu]]: [http://www.ferry.co.jp/ Jumbo Ferry], +81 78-327-3333. 3 1/2 hours; ¥1,600.
* [[Kitakyushu]]: [http://www.han9f.co.jp/ Hankyu Ferry], +81 78-857-1211. 12 hours; ¥7,400+.

==Get around==

===By train===
If you are planning to travel beyond city limits you might want to consider using the [http://www.surutto.com/tickets/kansai_thru_english.html Kansai Thru Pass]. 

There are some other useful tickets:

'''[https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/en/ticket/icoca-haruka/ ICOCA Card]''' is a rechargeable card that can be used on rail, subway, and bus networks in [[Kansai]] area, [[Okayama]], [[Hiroshima]], [[Nagoya]] (Kintetsu) and [[Tokyo]] (JR East). These cards are available at vending machines at these rail stations, and cost ¥2,000, which includes ¥1,500 in transportation credit and a ¥500 deposit that will be refunded when the card is returned at JR West Station.

The Hankyu (阪急), Hanshin (阪神) and JR lines cross Kōbe in a west-east direction, and provide the cheapest and fastest way to travel across town. Each of these three lines have their own station located around the busy central Sannomiya shopping district and each provide access to different points of interest.

For visitors with a [[Japan#Japan Rail Pass|Japan Rail Pass]], JR will be of the most use. ''Shin-kaisoku'' (新快速 - Special Rapid) trains stop at both Sannomiya and Kōbe stations and provide the best way to travel west towards [[Akashi]] and [[Himeji]] or east towards [[Kyoto]] and [[Osaka]]. Boarding a ''Futsu'' (普通 - Local) from either Sannomiya or Kōbe stations will allow you to easy access to Motomachi (for Nankin-machi and Meriken-park) Nada (for the sake brewing district and museums) Rokkomichi (for buses to Mt. Rokko) and Sumiyoshi (for the Rokko Liner to Rokko Island).

The Hankyu and Hanshin lines are of less use to tourists but you may be forced to use them to visit certain sights. Koshien Stadium, home of the baseball team the Hanshin Tigers, is easily accessible from Hanshin Koshien Station and both lines provide service to Shinkaichi for transfer to the private Kobe Dentetsu line and access to the famed [[Arima Onsen]] hot-spring district.

===By subway===
Kōbe has two subway lines. The [[:WikiPedia:Kaigan Line|Kaigan Line]] runs along along the coast, and the [[:WikiPedia:Seishin-Yamate Line|Seishin-Yamate Line]] runs toward the mountains. Both are more expensive than ordinary trains and unlikely to be of use for the traveler, except when connecting to Shin-Kōbe, the station located north of the city where the Sanyo Shinkansen stops. The small jaunt between Shin-Kobe and Sannomiya costs ¥200. If you want to explore Kobe, there is a one-day-pass for both lines (1日乗車券; Ichinichijoshaken), costing ¥800 (children: ¥400) or subway plus bus for ¥1,000 (children: ¥500). 

North of Shin-Kobe station, the Yamate subway runs over the '''Hokushin Express Line'''. Trains run 7.5 km under ground and terminate at Tanigami Station, from which you can transfer to the '''Shintetsu Arima Line''' for Arima-guchi Station and [[Arima Onsen]].

===By light rail===
The automated '''[http://www.knt-liner.co.jp/en/ Port Liner]''' links Sannomiya to the reclaimed port district south of the city, and continues over the Kobe Sky Bridge to Kobe Airport. Likewise, the '''Rokko Liner''' links the Rokko Island area to JR Sumiyoshi station.

===By bus===
Kobe has a comprehensive city bus system, which is often your best choice when travelling to areas located north of the city, away from the predominately east-west running train and subway lines. Schedules and boarding locations can be obtained from the tourist information office below JR and Hankyu Sannomiya stations.

The city also operates a loop-line tourist bus that travels around scenic spots and famous tourist locations in Kobe including the Kitano Ijinkan streets, Nankin-machi and Meriken Park. These distinctive old-fashioned green buses can be boarded are 15 stops between the Shin-Kobe area and Harborland and cost ¥250 for a single loop or ¥650 for a day pass. Boarding locations are indicated by green and red signs on the side of the road. Buses run at 15-20 minute intervals and one loop takes approximately 70 minutes.

===By ropeway===

Kobe has several ropeways that travel up Mount Rokko. One that is near a major station is the '''Shin-Kobe Ropeway''', a 5-minute walk from Shin-Kobe station. The ropeway, reputed to have one of Kobe's best scenic views, runs up to the Nunobiki Herb Park (see below). Tickets include admission to the Park.

===On foot===
Kōbe is narrow in the north-south direction, but long in the west-east direction. Since much of it is built on a hill, a reasonable itinerary is to take the bus up the hill, and walk down.If you get lost, find the mountains or the harbour. The mountains are on the north, and the harbour’s on the south.

[[Image:Ijinkan_GermanHouse.JPG|thumb|240px|German house, Ijinkan]]

Kobe's main attraction for the Japanese is its concentration of '''Western-style houses''', some dating back to the days when Kobe was opened for foreign trade in 1868. Europeans who grew up in similar scenery may find them less fascinating.

===Districts===

The area is also packed full of high-fashion boutiques such as Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Prada and Fendi.

* '''Chinatown''' (南京町 ''nankinmachi'') was the original settlement of Chinese merchants. Today, it is rather touristy though it offers some "Japanised" versions of Chinese food such as pork buns (豚饅頭 ''buta-manjū''). Its architecture is still rather pleasant though.

[[Image:JP-28_Kobe_Kobe-Beef.jpg|thumb|The famed Kobe beef: finger-licking good, budget-busting expensive]]

Kobe has many restaurants offering international cuisine.

Kōbe is known worldwide for its '''Kobe beef''', exquisitely marbled, very fatty and very expensive beef. Recommended for a splurge, but expect to pay close to ¥10,000 per 100 grams. At the opposite end of the culinary spectrum is ''sobameshi'' (そば飯), a concoction of fried rice and noodles mixed together, which is cheap, filling and pretty much unique to Kobe.
===Budget===
Cheap eats can be found in Kōbe's Chinatown ('''Nankinmachi''' in Japanese), walking distance from Sannomiya station.
