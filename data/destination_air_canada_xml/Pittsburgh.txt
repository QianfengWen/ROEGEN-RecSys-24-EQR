'''Pittsburgh''' [http://www.visitpittsburgh.com] is a city of about 300,000 in [[Allegheny County]], at the center of the [[Pittsburgh Region]] in southwestern [[Pennsylvania]]; the population of its metropolitan area is about 2.3 million. It is situated at the confluence of the Monongahela and Allegheny Rivers, which meet to form the Ohio River. Pittsburgh's unique terrain has resulted in an unusual city design and a hodge-podge of unique neighborhood "pockets" with diverse ethnic and architectural heritage.  Pittsburgh has a rich history and, for its size, an unusual array of cultural treasures, largely thanks to the wealth that was generated when Pittsburgh was a hub of industry. 

The pleasure of Pittsburgh remains a well-kept secret.  Though not built up by reputation, the city's unique combination of bridges, steep hills, and broad rivers make it one of the most naturally scenic cities in the country.  Cheap food and beer abound in this true sports town and the locals are amazingly friendly.

===History===

The first European to "discover" the site of Pittsburgh was French discoverer/trader Sieur de La Salle in his 1669 expedition.  The settlement of Pittsburgh began as a strategic point at the confluence of '''three rivers''', with Britain, France, and the local Native American tribes all vying for control over this spot and thus, the region.  On what is now referred to as '''The Point''', where the rivers meet, several forts were constructed by competing French and British forces during the French and Indian War. In 1758, British general John Forbes ordered the construction of Fort Pitt, named after British Secretary of State William Pitt the Elder. He also named the settlement between the rivers "Pittsborough".

Manufacturing in Pittsburgh began in earnest in the early 19th century, and by the US Civil War the city was known as "the armory of the Union."  This began a sharp escalation of industry, particularly steel and glass.  By the late 19th century, Pittsburgh was known as the '''Steel City'''.  Andrew Carnegie began the Carnegie Steel Company in 1892, which became United States Steel (USS) a decade later and grew to be the largest corporation of any kind in the world.  Carnegie became the richest man on Earth and, along with other local magnates of industry, gave Pittsburgh cultural institutions such as the Carnegie Museums, Carnegie Library, and Carnegie-Mellon University.  A number of other Fortune 100 companies have called Pittsburgh their headquarters, helping fund world-class museums, theaters, universities, and other attractions.

{{Infobox|Pittsburghese|The Pittsburgh English dialect, popularly referred to as "Pittsburghese", has derived from influences from its immigrants.  Locals who speak in this dialect are sometimes referred to as "Yinzers" (from the local word for "you guys/people", ''yinz'' [var. ''yunz'']).  The dialect has some tonal similarities to other nearby regional dialects, but is noted for its somewhat staccato rhythms.  It also has so many local peculiarities that the New York Times described Pittsburgh as "the Galapagos Islands of American dialect".

Some examples of Pittsburghese words include:
* '''Yinz''' - ''pr.'' You (plural).  People from Pittsburgh are often referred to as "Yinzers"
* '''Slippy''' - ''adj.'' Slippery
* '''Buggy''' - ''n.'' Shopping Cart; Stroller
* '''Gumband''' - ''n.'' Rubber band
* '''the 'Burgh''' - ''n.'' The city of Pittsburgh
* '''Redd up''' - ''v.'' To clean up
* '''N'at''' -  (and so forth, literally "and that") is sometimes used to end a sentence.  For example: ''"Yinz need to redd up your room n'at."'' 

Many words are also pronounced uniquely in Pittsburgh:
* '''''ee''''' sounds are pronounced as '''''i''''' (as in the word ''bit'') before the letter l.  For example, '''Steelers''' is pronounced '''''Still-ers'''''.
* '''''ow''''' and '''''ou''''' sounds are pronounced '''''ah'''''.  For example, ''downtown'' is pronounced ''dahntahn''.  
* '''Washer''' is pronounced '''''worsh-er''''', and '''wash''' is sometimes pronounced '''''worsh'''''.
* '''Iron''' is pronounced '''''arn'''''.

See the Pittsburghese website [http://www.pittsburghese.com/] for more examples.}}


At the height of this industrialization Pittsburgh was notorious for its severe air pollution. One journalist, James Parton, descriptively dubbed it "hell with the lid off".  White-collar workers came home in the evening as "brown-collar" workers.  When asked what to do to fix Pittsburgh, the noted architect Frank Lloyd Wright famously replied with his characteristic frankness, "Raze it."  Following World War II, the city launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the "Renaissance."  This much-acclaimed effort was followed by the "Renaissance II" project, begun in 1977 and focusing more on cultural and neighborhood development than its predecessor.  The industrial base continued to expand through the 1960s, but beginning in the 1970s and 1980s, the steel industry in the region imploded, with massive layoffs and mill closures.

Today Pittsburgh is a model of cleanliness due to the remediation of the polluting industrial plants in the late 1950s, as well as the gradual migration of the mills to other cities and countries.  There is now only one operating steel mill in the region, Carnegie Steel's venerable Edgar Thompson Works, now a USS state-of-the-art integrated steel mill.  With the implosion of the steel industry in the region, the city's population shrank dramatically, from 600,000 in 1950 to 330,000 in 2000.  Remnants of the city's more prosperous past can be seen throughout the area.  But while the region is still reeling from the economic collapse, Pittsburgh is now (for the most part) economically stable, as the city has shifted the economic base to services such as education, medicine, technology, and finance.

===People===

The people of Pittsburgh are indeed what make it such a unique place.  The city has been shaped by its immigrants, whose specific traditions have left a lasting mark.  Pittsburghers are generally welcoming, down-to-earth, and unpretentious.  Pittsburgh has also recently gained attention as a burgeoning center for counter-culture.

The British were the first to permanently settle Pittsburgh, and early settlers included the English, Scottish, Welsh, and Irish, as well as German, drawn by mining, shipping, and manufacturing.  These people formed the foundation of Pittsburgh, still physically visible in the oldest parts of the city.

By the late 1800s, the demand for labor was so strong the new immigrants - the so-called "millhunkies" - began flocking to Pittsburgh, chiefly from Central and Eastern Europe.  They not only provided labor, but brought their families, their languages, their churches, and other traditions.  Today Pittsburgh's identity has been strongly molded by the ethnic traditions of these immigrants from countries like Poland, Slovakia, Ukraine, Italy, Lithuania, Serbia, and Croatia.  Steeples and the bright copper onion-dome churches of the Eastern Orthodox tradition dot the old parts of town, and grandmas wearing ''babushkas'' are a common sight. Pittsburgh is also home to a large Jewish community, centered in [[Pittsburgh/East_End-South|Squirrel Hill]].

Pittsburgh's modern economy has brought new immigrants from places such as India and China, along with their traditions; the Pittsburgh region today is home to a number of Hindu temples, for example.  Pittsburgh has truly been a great melting pot, and continues to be as a home to thousands of students from across the world that attend the many universities in the city, especially Carnegie Mellon University and the [[Pittsburgh/East End-South#Pitt Campus|University of Pittsburgh]].

In addition, Pittsburgh has an organized LGBT community. Anti-discrimination laws inclusive of LGBT people have been enacted at both the city and county levels.

The surrounding landscape has had a huge impact on Pittsburgh; Pittsburgh's characteristic rivers and hills have shaped the city physically, economically, and socially.  

Like most older cities, it was the rivers that made the city.  The rivers allowed for the transport of raw materials and provided water used for making steel, and allowed for easy shipping of finished products.  Today, the rivers attract mostly recreational boaters, but still support extensive barge traffic.  Pittsburgh claims to have more '''bridges''' than any city in the world (only counting bridges over 20 feet, 440 or so within Pittsburgh, and over 1700 in the county) [http://pghbridges.com/].

The hilly landscape&mdash;arguably the most rugged of any city east of the Rockies&mdash;has created unique neighborhoods; flat lands near the rivers were used for mills, while workers' houses cling precariously to the hillsides above.  In many places "pockets" of neighborhoods, divided by rivers and valleys, have developed distinctly different characteristics from each other, despite being very close together.  Much of the landscape, with its many unbuildable slopes, remains lush and green, and provides for amazing views.

===By plane===

'''Pittsburgh International Airport''' ({{IATA|PIT}}) [http://www.flypittsburgh.com/] is the normal way in, although the area is also served by the smaller Allegheny County Airport in [[West Mifflin]], primarily used by private and corporate airplanes. The airport is located near [[Robinson Township]] in Findlay, about 20 miles west of downtown, translating to about a $35 cab ride ($50 in rush hour traffic).  Hotel shuttles and buses are also available, and can be cheaper.  A city bus, route '''28X''' [http://www.portauthority.org/PAAC/apps/pdfs/28X.pdf], also connects the airport to Downtown and Oakland, taking a reasonably fast route mostly along freeways and dedicated busways, and costing much less than a taxi.

The airport terminal is relatively new, yet you will find it is quite empty in terms of passenger traffic, even after closing one of the main concourses. This is mainly due to the relocation of many USAir (later US Airways, now American Airlines) flights to/and from Pittsburgh. When it was built it was the first "airport mall" in the country, which contains many shops and restaurants. It has been much copied since it was completed. 

From your plane, you will arrive in the ''Airside Terminal''.  If you are transiting to another destination you don't have to leave this building, and this is where most of the Airmall shops are which makes window shopping a pleasant way of passing the time.  Free Wi-Fi is also available (Pittsburgh's was the first "international" airport to provide such service).  If you are coming to the Pittsburgh area though, you will take a light-rail shuttle a short distance underground to the ''Landside Terminal'' where you will find the baggage claim and the various transportation modes to the city and other regional locations.  A Hyatt Hotel is connected to the landside terminal complex and there are several hotels (Embassy Suites and Sheraton among them) within 5 miles of the airport.

The airport is served by United, Delta, Airtran, Allegiant, jetBlue, and Air Canada, but American and Southwest Airlines are predominant. Porter airways flies from Toronto. There are non-stop flights to/from most of the major airports around the country, as well as some service to Canada and the Caribbean and limited service to Paris.

===By bus===

'''Greyhound''' [http://www.greyhound.com] (''+1 412'' 392-6513 or +1 800-231-2222 for routes and schedules) serves Pittsburgh from a station in the new (Sept 2008) transportation center at 11th and Liberty [[Pittsburgh/Downtown|Downtown]]. 

'''Fullington Trailways''' also serves Pittsburgh out of the Greyhound station.  Twice daily direct Service to DuBois PA, along with one daily (5AM departure) connecting service to Buffalo, NY, and Wilkes-Barre, PA.  As a Greyhound alternative, you can travel to New York City by taking the 5AM Fullington departure and connecting in Wilkes-Barre with the Martz Trailways bus to NYC, for a less-crowded bus (but longer trip).

'''Megabus''' [http://us.megabus.com] serves Pittsburgh with service from various cities in the Northeast and Midwest. The bus stop is located under the David L. Lawrence Convention Center just north of the intersection of 10th Street and Penn Avenue. Fares from $1 and up.

'''Metropolitan Shuttle''' [http://www.metropolitanshuttle.com/] 11141 Georgia Ave., Ste. 218, Wheaton, MD 20902, +1 866 556 3545 . Metropolitanshuttle offer charter buses and rental bus services.

===By car===
The city proper is served by three interstate routes that spur from the triangular-shaped beltway formed by I-76 (PA Turnpike) to the north and east, I-79 to the west and I-70 to the far south.  These three spurs form what locals often refer to as "parkways".  As of November 2009, the Parkways West and East are signed as I-376, and the Parkway North is signed as I-279. Prior to 2009, the Parkway West's interstate highway designation terminated at I-79; however, this odd route numbering scheme has been fully corrected.

The interstate system links Pittsburgh with many cities. If coming from the east or west, your best bet into the city is I-76, the Pennsylvania Turnpike. From the west, take exit 10 (New Castle) and follow I-376 east to downtown.  If coming from the east, take exit 57 (Pittsburgh) and follow I-376 west to downtown. From the north, use I-79 and take the exit to I-279 south.  From the south, use I-79 and take the exit to I-376 east.

Within the metro area several limited-access turnpike spur routes have been partially or fully completed recently including the ''Mon-Fayette Expressway'' linking the historic "Steel Valley" area to State Route 51 in Jefferson Hills (and eventually to Monroeville).  PA Route 66 in nearby [[Greensburg (Pennsylvania)|Greensburg]] offers a quick jump on the eastern side of the metro from I-70/I-76 (Turnpike mainline) junction area to the Kiski Valley in the northeast, and the newly completed Findlay connector offers quick access from the airport terminal to points west and south of the airport such as Steubenville, Ohio, and Weirton and Wheeling, West Virginia.  PA 65 along the northern section of the city of Pittsburgh, PA 28 along the Allegheny Valley from downtown through the Oakmont and 76/Turnpike area to beyond Kittaning in Armstrong County and PA 60 from the I-279/79 junction through the airport area and up through Beaver to New Castle and I-80 are all toll-free state limited access highways in the region.  US 22 from Robinson through to the Findlay airport connector and on to the West Virigina panhandle and east-central Ohio offers toll free interstate like travel as well.

===By train===

'''Amtrak''', +1 800 872-7245, [http://www.amtrak.com] services Pittsburgh with a station [[Pittsburgh/Downtown|Downtown]] at Grant and Liberty, just across the street from the Greyhound depot.  Two Amtrak routes serve Pittsburgh: the ''Capitol Limited'' [http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=Amtrak/am2Route/Horizontal_Route_Page&c=am2Route&cid=1081256321384&ssid=134], which runs daily between Chicago and Washington, DC, and the ''Pennsylvanian'' [http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=Amtrak/am2Route/Horizontal_Route_Page&c=am2Route&cid=1093553988378&ssid=134], which runs daily between Pittsburgh and New York City through Philadelphia.

==Get around==

Pittsburgh is often difficult for strangers to navigate because the roads go every which way, constrained by the rivers and hills. Many are one-way and nearly all are narrow, as they were laid out in the days of horse-and-buggy transportation. Those with a GPS navigation device should get around fine.  For those without, a taxi is an option until you get used to the roads, but the public transit, operated by the '''Port Authority''' (see below), works quite well for travel within the City.  If you do find yourself lost or unsure, however, do not be afraid to ask for help.  Most locals are very friendly - and giving directions can be so confusing - that they might just show you to your destination themselves.

===By public transit===
[[Image:US Steel tower.jpg|thumb|250px|Pittsburgh's tallest skyscraper, the U.S. Steel Tower]]

'''Port Authority''', (''+1 412'' 442-2000, [http://www.portauthority.org]) (or ''PAT'' as some residents refer to it) operates bus, light rail, and incline service.  

Bus service covers much of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County and, for the most part, is reliable and clean.  Light rail (commonly referred to as "The T") connects the south side of the city to downtown and the stadiums, but doesn't connect to many other points of interest.

Routes can be confusing, but both the Port Authority [http://www.portauthority.org/PAAC/Schedules/TripPlanner/tabid/164/Default.aspx] and Google Maps (which is perhaps better) offer trip planners.  Google Maps also shows bus and trolley stops.  Bus stops are typically marked with a simple blue sign reading "Bus Stop" and listing route numbers and names.

Before boarding a bus or trolley, always check Port Authority's schedules (all of which are available on their website) and confirm its destination with the driver.


;Fares:
**'''Base fare''' is $2.75 if paying with cash, $2.50 if paying by ConnectCard, and covers all destinations. 
**The '''Free Fare Zone''' extends from the North Shore to First Avenue Station and includes all light rail stations in between. 
*'''Transfers:''' Can only be used if you have a ConnectCard and cost $1.00.  
*'''Reduced Fare:''' Discount fares are available for individuals with disabilities, Medicare recipients and children ages 6-11. Seniors 65+ ride free, as do children 5 years of age or younger when accompanied by a paying adult. Police, fire and municipal employees ride for free on all Port Authority services while in full uniform. Proof of eligibility is required for all discounted passengers.

'''Paying:''' Pay as you enter using the front door of the bus. Regardless of travel direction or time of day, you'll enter using the front door, pay your fare and then exit through the back door.

===By taxi===

Taxis are notoriisly unreliable and expensive.  They can be difficult to hail on the street except when Downtown and on the South Side. Plan to wait a while if you call one on a night or weekend.  Taxis are usually widely available outside of major hotels. To compete with Uber and Lyft the local taxi company started Ztrip.

* '''Yellow Cab'''  ''+1 412'' 321-8100.

===By car===
With a multitude of hills, valleys, Pittsburgh is an eclectic town to travel by car for even the natives.  Very little is straightforward about Pittsburgh travel via car, but some constants help road warriors get by.

Major highways include the Parkways East, West (both Interstate 376), and North (Interstate 279). The PA Turnpike (Interstate 76) connects Pittsburgh to [[Harrisburg]] and [[Philadelphia]] to the east, and [[Akron|Akron., Ohio]] and [[Cleveland]] to the west, while Interstate 79 provides connections to [[Erie]] in the north and [[Morgantown|Morgantown, West Virginia]] in the south. Other major routes include Interstate 579 (Crosstown Blvd), PA 51, PA 28, PA 837, PA 885, PA Turnpike 43 (Mon-Fayette Expressway (''partially completed'')), US 19, US 22, and US 30. 

A trick to not getting lost in Pittsburgh is the well-kept secret of the '''Belt System''' [http://www.routemarkers.com/usa/Pennsylvania/Belt_System/].  The Belt System consists of 5 color-coded routes along main roads, forming a unique system of ring routes around the City and county.  It provides a navigational aid for motorists in unfamiliar portions of the county.  These belts are long, winding circular paths which allow travelers to freely explore the city with little fear of getting truly lost.  If you are hopelessly lost and encounter a Belt sign (blue, red, yellow...), following these signs is a good way to locate a main travel artery and get back on track, as they cross most major highways.  If nothing else, the belts tend to eventually circle back on themselves and, at the very least, you will get back to where you started if you keep following them.  Routes are marked with signs showing a colored circle.  

Visitors may want to be careful of the '''Pittsburgh left.'''  At traffic lights, a driver wishing to turn left will do so as soon as the light turns green, regardless of whether another vehicle has the right-of-way.  This may sound strange and even dangerous, but it actually has a useful purpose; at many intersections, there is only one lane of travel in each direction, so someone waiting to make a left turn will block the traffic behind them if they cannot make the turn.  While waiting to make a left turn at an intersection, you may find cars traveling the other direction will wait in order for you to make the left turn and keep the traffic behind you moving.  While not done as much by the younger generation, the Pittsburgh Left still has its adherents.

;Lane Irregularities:
*Beware the "left only" lane: you can be driving straight down the road and suddenly the lane you are in becomes a "Left Turn Only" lane, although you did not change lanes. This is common in other cities in the right lane but not the left.  However, there is no rule for when this will happen in Pittsburgh, and it can happen in right lanes as well, so drivers tend to drift back and forth from left lane to right without signaling.  If you are new to the city keep an eye on the signs leading up to each intersection.
*As in Baltimore, many times there is no separate lane for parking, so driving in the right lane can mean you suddenly become stuck behind a parked car.

===By boat===
'''Gateway Clipper''' [http://www.gatewayclipper.com] and '''Pittsburgh Cruise Lines''' [http://www.pghwaterlimo.com/] offer shuttle services to sports events at Heinz Field and PNC Park.  Gateway Clipper operates all cruises from Station Square in the South Side.  Pittsburgh Cruise Lines operates all shuttles to Heinz Field from Downtown, and all shuttles to PNC Park from the Strip District.  If you are traveling the rivers on your own boat, be sure to check out '''Boatpittsburgh.com''' [http://www.boatpittsburgh.com].

===By bicycle===
Pittsburgh has some fine biking trails, most of which run along the rivers. However, Pittsburgh isn't so friendly to street cycling - the streets are narrow, are often very rough, and much of the city is very hilly. '''BikePGH''' [http://bike-pgh.org/] offers information for bicyclists and hosts biking events. Since 2015 the city has had a public bike share called '''Healthy Ride''' [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthy_Ride] and has been expanding rapidly since.

===Museums===
Pittsburgh is home to many wonderful museums, including some truly world-class institutions. The '''Carnegie Museums''' in [[Pittsburgh/Oakland|Oakland]] are absolutely spectacular; enclosed in one massive building is the '''Carnegie Museum of Natural History''', with extensive exhibits on paleontology, geology, and biology, and the '''Carnegie Museum of Art''', with classical and contemporary works by many fine artists. Nearby is the '''Frick Art and Historical Center''',  which is the home of steel magnate Henry Clay Frick's mansion, now open for tours. In the [[Pittsburgh/East End-North|Strip District]] is the '''Senator John Heinz History Center''', an affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution and the largest history museum in Pennsylvania, with six floors of permanent and changing exhibitions on the history of Western Pennsylvania.

[[Pittsburgh/North Side|North Side]] is home to quite a few museums - the '''Andy Warhol Museum''' is one of the most comprehensive single-artist museums in the world, with exhibits of the artist's life and work, recreations of portions of "The Factory", screening of films, and educational programs about the Pittsburgh-born artist as well as other contemporary and pop artists. The '''Carnegie Science Center''', a major science museum which is another of the Carnegie Museums, and the '''Children's Museum of Pittsburgh''' are both very popular with kids. The '''Mattress Factory''' is contemporary art on the installation-scale, with several notable James Turrell works in their permanent collection. The '''National Aviary''' allows you to get up close with plenty of exotic birds.

You can check out further artistic venues on the '''Pittsburgh Art Places ''' website [http://www.pittsburghartplaces.org].

===Architecture===
Pittsburgh has more than its fair share of incredible architecture in many different styles, largely thanks to the wealth of its earlier industrialists and diverse influences of its many immigrants. Following the decline of the steel industry, the city has prioritized historic preservation and sustainable building as the city modernizes. Architecture buffs will find something interesting in every corner of the city, but there are some highlights:

Naturally, [[Pittsburgh/Downtown|Downtown]] gets the lion's share of attention here. Walking some of the narrow downtown streets gives a very notable urban canyon effect, unusual for a midsized city.  Pittsburgh has an impressive skyline for a city of its size, with the '''U.S. Steel Tower''' being the tallest building in the city. However, it's Phillip Johnson's shimmering '''PPG Place''' that captures much of the attention, with its glass pinnacles that make the building resemble a castle right out of a fairy tale. Beneath these towering structures are numerous historic buildings from the early 20th century, built by the biggest names in industry at the time. H.H. Richardson's '''Allegheny County Courthouse and Jail''' are gorgeous stone structures that still serves as a government building, while just across the street the '''Frick Building''' and the '''Union Trust Building''' are prime examples of commercial architecture from the time. Recent years have brought buildings like the '''David L Lawrence Convention Center''', an impressive modern structure along the Allegheny River.

[[Image:HeinzChapelSouth.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Heinz Chapel at the [[Pittsburgh/East End-South#Pitt Campus|University of Pittsburgh]]]]
Heading east through [[Pittsburgh/Oakland|Oakland]], stately Victorians and large parks replace the bustle and height of downtown. This was, after all, where some of the wealthiest men of the early 20th century lived and played. Among them was '''Henry Clay Frick''', whose house in Point Breeze is open for tours near the massive park that also bears his name. Within Oakland proper are the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University, and both campuses contain even more stunning architecture. Dominating the Oakland landscape is the '''Cathedral of Learning''', the 42-story centerpiece of the [[Pittsburgh/East End-South#Pitt Campus|University of Pittsburgh]] campus and the second-tallest academic building in the world (the tallest is in Russia). The Cathedral is a magnificent example of Gothic Revival architecture and is also home to the '''Nationality Rooms''', a series of rooms decorated in the themes of the various cultures that played a role in the city's development. Next door to the Cathedral is the much shorter (but still impressive) '''Heinz Chapel''', which sports magnificent stained glass windows.

If you want to get closer to the industrial past of the city, both [[Pittsburgh/South Side|South Side]] and the area around the [[Pittsburgh/East End-North|Strip District]] are home to numerous industrial buildings and old warehouses, most of them now converted into lofts, shops, restaurants, and other uses. 

While many of Pittsburgh's neighborhoods may not have many stately and notable buildings (besides many churches), their urban design - how they were laid out and built, often with narrow, winding streets - can feel more like Europe than the US, and provide a great opportunity for exploring.  It is sometimes easy to get lost, but with surprises around every corner, that can be half the fun.  Most neighborhoods (especially those of greatest interest listed above) are very walkable and safe, and this activity is of course 100% free.  Some of the most interesting neighborhoods for exploring are the South Side, Lawrenceville, Bloomfield, and the North Side.

===Parks and outdoors===
[[Image:Pittsburgh frick park trail.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Frick Park]]
For a city previously defined by industry, Pittsburgh has an impressive quantity of good parks to enjoy.  Pittsburgh's four large city parks [http://www.pittsburghparks.org/] are excellent places to bike, jog, walk, or play. The city parks department operates several swimming pools (including the unusual, industrial-era Oliver Bath House on the South Side, open year-round), an outdoor ice-skating rink in Schenley park, tennis courts, bocce courts, miles of biking and hiking trails, and a public golf course. 
 
[[Pittsburgh/East End-South|East End-South]] has many of the city's finer park spaces. Next door to Oakland is '''Schenley Park''', a 456-acre park which is a haven for exercisers, sunbathers, and anyone who appreciates beautiful green space. Schenley Plaza, next to the Cathedral of Learning and Carnegie Museums, features snack stands, a carousel, and sometimes festivals. Nearby is '''Phipps Conservatory''', which boasts stunning indoor and outdoor gardens with beautiful floral displays. On the eastern limits of the city is '''Frick Park''', the largest of Pittsburgh's parks and the perfect escape from the city, with its naturalistic setting and beautiful woodlands.

In [[Pittsburgh/East End-North|East End-North]] is '''Highland Park''', a large park with some beautiful gardens and a couple of lovely lakes situated among the hills of the area. Within Highland Park is the '''Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium''', a large zoo/aquarium complex with animals from all over the world.   '''Point State Park''' in [[Pittsburgh/Downtown|Downtown]] has a large fountain which marks the spot where the three rivers of Pittsburgh meet.  In addition to being a favorite spot for office workers to take breaks, many festivals and special events are held in this park.  Finally, the [[Pittsburgh/North Side|North Side]] is home to '''Riverview Park''' and the '''Allegheny Observatory'''.

* If you can only do one thing in Pittsburgh, take one of the '''inclines''' to the top of '''Mount Washington''' near [[Pittsburgh/South Side|South Side]] to take in the view of the beautiful skyline.  The '''Monongahela''' and '''Duquesne Inclines''' rise nearly 400 feet over the city from stations near Station Square. The views from Mount Washington are magnificent, but they are only the most popular - there are numerous other spots to take in views of the city, many that are more off the beaten path.

===Sports===
[[Image:Pnc park pittsburgh2.jpg|thumb|300px|PNC Park]]
With tons of die-hard fans, three major league sports teams, and a long history of sports dedication, Pittsburgh is truly a great sports town. And few things define Pittsburgh like the '''Pittsburgh Steelers''' NFL team, who go down in history as one of the greatest NFL franchises of all time and have one of the largest fan bases in all of American football. The Steelers play all their home games at Heinz Field in the [[Pittsburgh/North Side|North Side]]. Also in the North Side is PNC Park, home of the '''Pittsburgh Pirates''' MLB team. Due to its tremendous views of the city, PNC Park is almost universally considered one of the best baseball parks in the country. Pittsburgh is also home to the '''Pittsburgh Penguins''' NHL team, the 2016 and 2017 Stanley Cup winners. The Penguins play [[Pittsburgh/Downtown|Downtown]] at the newly constructed PPG Paints Arena, next to the former Mellon Arena (or Civic Arena), or more informally "The Igloo" for its unique architectural design.

College sports are also very big in Pittsburgh. The '''Pittsburgh Panthers''' of the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) are very popular in the region, with teams in a variety of sports. The men's and women's basketball teams have been very competitive lately, with the men's frequently ranking in the top 15 in the NCAA basketball playoffs. Both basketball teams play at the Petersen Events Center on the Pitt campus in [[Pittsburgh/East End-South|Oakland]]. The Panthers football team is also quite popular; they share Heinz Field with the Steelers. Also in Pittsburgh are the '''Duquesne Dukes''' of Duquesne University near Downtown, whose basketball and football teams remain popular, and the '''Carnegie Mellon Tartans''' of Carnegie Mellon University in Oakland. The '''Robert Morris Colonials''' of Robert Morris University are in the northwest suburb of Moon Township.

===Arts and music===

The PSO prides itself in artistic excellence and a rich history of the world’s finest conductors and musicians.  This world class orchestra has a season starting mid September through late June.  The orchestra performs downtown at Heinz Hall which is located at 600 Penn Ave. 
* Pittsburgh is also home to a number of smaller theaters and companies such as the '''Quantum Theater''', the '''Attack Theater''', the '''Pittsburgh Playhouse''' operated by Point Park University [http://www.pittsburghplayhouse.com/default.aspx?id=835], and '''No Name Players''' [http://www.nonameplayers.org/].
* The '''IonSound Project''' [http://ionsound.googlepages.com/] adds to Pittsburgh's cultural life by programming innovative concerts, commissioning works of new music, collaborating with artists in a variety of disciplines, and exploring the boundaries between concert and popular music. 
* '''Pittsburgh Irish and Classical Theatre''' [http://www.picttheatre.org] is a professional company which has emerged as a significant contributor to the cultural fabric of Pittsburgh with almost 2000 loyal subscribers, and an annual attendance of over 23,000. PICT has garnered a yearly position on the Pittsburgh ''Post-Gazette's'' list of the city's Top 50 Cultural Forces. The organization's productions are consistently ranked among the year's best by the critics of the Pittsburgh ''Post-Gazette'', Pittsburgh ''Tribune-Review'', and Pittsburgh ''City Paper''. PICT was named '''Theatre of the Year''' in both 2004 and 2006 by critics of the Pittsburgh ''Post-Gazette''.
* '''Pittsburgh Glass Center''', 5472 Penn Ave, 412-365-2145, [http://www.pittsburghglasscenter.org]. The Pittsburgh Glass Center is a nonprofit, public access glass studio and gallery dedicated to teaching, creating and promoting glass art. The 16,000+ square foot building is one of the top glass art facilities in the country and houses state-of-the-art studios.

===Festivals===
Pittsburgh holds a number of '''arts and cultural festivals'''.  Some of the favorites include the '''Three Rivers Arts Festival''', '''Pittsburgh Folk Festival''', '''Greek Food Festival''', '''Three Rivers Regatta''', '''Pittburgh Vintage Grand Prix''', and '''Little Italy Days'''.

'''Monster Pumpkin Festival''', October 16 & 17 2021 [https://www.pa-carnivals.com/2021/monster-pumpkin-festival-2021-pittsburgh-pa/].

Many different restaurants such as The Hard Rock, Joe's Crab Shack, Bar Louie etc. 
Save room for dessert, or spend the day enjoying the show next to "The Waltzing Waters Fountain Show" in "Bessemer Court," at The New York Original Italian ice & Fresh Cannoli.  Have a Mango Gelati, or a delicious shaved ice while having fun choosing your newest favorite pair of "Designer Inspired Sunglasses and Flip Flops in "The Courtyard." "Bessemer Court" is a favorite enjoyed by locals, and tourists alike.

===Tours===
Several different tour companies are centered around Station Square in [[Pittsburgh/South Side|South Side]], and most of them focus on giving river tours - indeed, one of the best ways to see Pittsburgh is from the three rivers themselves, taking in views of the downtown skyline, the hillsides, the bridges, and the stadiums.

Oakland is the hub of college activity, home to CMU, Pitt, Carlow, and Chatham Universities.  The greater Pittsburgh region boasts even more colleges and universities.

The city also has an extensive library system, both public and university. Most notable are the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh and the University of Pittsburgh's University Library System, which rank 9th largest (public) and 18th largest (academic) in the nation, respectively.

==Work==

Pittsburgh's most popular shopping districts include:
* The '''[[Pittsburgh/South Side|South Side]]''', which has many hip shops along a mile-long stretch of E Carson Street, along with two shopping centers - '''Station Square''' at Smithfield and Carson Streets and the '''South Side Works''' the opposite end, at E Carson and 28th Streets. 
* '''Shadyside''', near Oakland in [[Pittsburgh/East End-South|East End-South]], is concentrated along Walnut and Bellefonte Streets, and is one of the main upmarket sections of town. 
* '''Squirrel Hill''', in [[Pittsburgh/East End-South|East End-South]] is concentrated along at Murray and Forbes Avenues, and has tons great little shops, notably some catering to the Jewish community. The Squirrel Hill shops tend to fall under the 'specialty' store category.
* '''[[Pittsburgh/Downtown|Downtown]]''' has shops of every description, but is best visited during standard business hours. 
* The '''[[Pittsburgh/East End-North|Strip District]]''' is home to many ethnic markets and street vendors, as well as the '''16:62 Design Zone''', which stretches between 16th and 62nd Streets from the Strip to '''Lawrenceville''' and offers a distinctive blend of neighborhood shops, artisan studios and unique showrooms, all focused on the arts and home decor.

There are many outlet stores and suburban malls located in the Pittsburgh region, but not within Pittsburgh itself. For info on these, see the [[Allegheny County]] article.

==Eat==
''See the [[Pittsburgh#Districts|Districts]] articles for individual listings.''

The Pittsburgh restaurant scene is a little different than most cities. In many neighborhoods, they can be difficult to find and are often patronized mainly by locals. The hills and rivers make the roads tricky. So, if you're from out of town your best bet is to pick up a local copy of the Pittsburgh magazine and do a quick search of the "Best Restaurants" section.  

Each district has its unique restaurants, but the main districts for eating are the Strip District, South Side and, of course Downtown.  Mt Washington, Lawrenceville, Shadyside, Oakland, Bloomfield, and Squirrel Hill also contain a wide variety of restaurants.  If you're willing to go a little off the beaten path, you'll also find gems tucked away just slightly further out which are still accessible by PAT bus.

* The '''[[Pittsburgh/East End-North#Eat|Strip District]]''' has tons of ethnic groceries, eateries, and vendors, with plenty of free samples.
* '''[[Pittsburgh/East End-South#Eat|Squirrel Hill]]''' has a variety of more ethnic restaurants: Mediterranean, kosher, Italian, etc.
* '''[[Pittsburgh/East End-North#Eat|Bloomfield]]''', known as Pittsburgh's Little Italy, is home to many small Italian restaurants.  Don't expect the Olive Garden!

Unique Pittsburgh dishes to try include halushky, pierogies, kolbasi, stuffed cabbage, city chicken, and chipped ham.

==Drink==
''See the [[Pittsburgh#Districts|Districts]] articles for more listings.''

Pittsburgh is a city serious about its drinking.  A popular anecdote tells of the priorities earlier Pittsburghers: It's said that for every church, there's a bar across the street (and there are a lot of churches!).  A Slavic drink ethic has made the city largely "a shot and a beer town."  Even today, trendy and pretentious bars are scarcer than elsewhere, but almost any taste in bars and clubs can be found.  The highlights are listed below, but almost every neighborhood has a fair concentration of bars.  

* The '''[[Pittsburgh/South Side|South Side]] Flats''' neighborhood has the most popular and diverse bar scene, and is said to have more bars per block/capita than almost anywhere else in the U.S. Most bars are along a mile-long strip of E Carson St. between 7th and 29th Sts.  

* The '''[[Pittsburgh/East End-North|Strip District]]''' is home to some more posh nightclubs, as well as some other bars. It is a former warehouse district-turned-nightlife area, recalling the Meatpacking District of New York City.

* '''[[Pittsburgh/Downtown|Downtown]]''' is home to Market Square and the Cultural District, which offer many great jazz options, such as the Backstage Bar at Theater Square, NOLA Restaurant, and the lobby of the Fairmont Hotel. Downtown is also one of the centers of Pittsburgh's gay culture, with several gay-owned businesses, bars, and clubs lining Liberty Avenue. A semi-fictionalized account of Liberty Avenue's gay culture is depicted in the television program Queer as Folk.

* '''[[Pittsburgh/East End-South|Shadyside]]''' is also an important center for Pittsburgh's gay community, mostly concentrated around Ellsworth Avenue. Shadyside features the popular gay bars 5801 and Spin, and the gay-owned-and-themed restaurant Harris Grill. There are also many salons, spas, gyms, and art galleries in this area that cater to the gay community.

'''Beer''' is very dear to Pittsburgh, highlighted by '''Penn Brewery''', in the [[Pittsburgh/North Side|North Side]], a popular German beer hall and restaurant in a beautiful historic old brewery building, which also hosts an annual Oktoberfest.  The new '''Hofbräuhaus Pittsburgh''' on the [[Pittsburgh/South Side|South Side]], modeled after the legendary 400+ year-old Hofbräuhaus in [[Munich]]. In addition, East End Brewing and the Church Brew Works are two local breweries whose beers can be found on tap all over the city.

'''Coffee''' is just as important to many Pittsburghers as beer.  Some of the best can be found at: '''Enrico's Tazzo d'Oro''' in Highland Park (said to be the best); '''Coffee Tree''' in Squirrel Hill and Shadyside; '''Nicholas Coffee''' downtown; and '''Crazy Mocha''', which has many locations around town.  The Strip District also has three roasters, notably '''La Prima Espresso'''.

==Sleep==
''See the [[Pittsburgh#Districts|Districts]] articles for more listings.''

Downtown has the greatest concentration of hotels. It is sometimes possible to get a room at some of the top downtown hotels (the Marriott, the Wyndham, and the William Penn, for example) at bargain prices ($120-150) from discount sites such as priceline and hotwire, so do a search before calling the hotel itself. For those visiting the universities or other attractions in the Oakland area, there are a number of convenient options. Airport accommodations, located near the airport outside of Pittsburgh itself, are mostly in [[Robinson Township]] and [[Moon Township]], about 12 miles west of Pittsburgh.  Bear in mind that hotels close to the city are booked solidly in advance and/or inflated in price around the time of Steelers home games, so plan ahead.

==Contact==
;Telephone:
Pittsburgh is one of those cities where you ''must'' use an area code even when dialing locally.  The City's main area code is '''412''', but the new 878 area code is also used.  724 is used in surrounding areas.  Use of a "1" prefix when dialing these codes locally is optional.  

The city has set up a '''311''' hotline which allows you to receive information and access to City government services.

;Internet:
Almost all of downtown and much of the surrounding areas have WiFi which can be accessed free for two hours daily [http://www.downtownpittsburgh.com/about-pdp/pdp-services-and-initiatives/wifi-downtown-pittsburgh].

==Stay safe==
* As in most of the United States, the phone number to dial for emergencies is '''911'''.  

* Pittsburgh is routinely ranked as one of the safest cities among others of comparable size in the US. Most areas of the city are safe for tourists, and most of the unsafe areas are residential, so tourists are unlikely to visit these areas. Nevertheless, extra caution, especially at night, should be used in the following neighborhoods: 

'''The Hill District''' (located between Downtown Pittsburgh & Oakland)

'''Homewood''' (located on the far east side of the city)

'''Wilkinsburg''' (located outside of the far east of the city)

'''Lincoln-Larimer''' (located on the far east side of the city)

'''Central North Side'''

'''Hazelwood''' (located to the southwest of Squirrel Hill/Greenfield)

'''Upper Homestead''' (The Waterfront is still a viable attraction in lower Homestead)


* On Sundays in the fall and winter, some fans of the local football team (the Steelers) tend to get out of hand. While the great majority won't bother you, it is suggested that out of town fans do not wear the clothing of the team they are playing that day or that of their main rivals (the Baltimore Ravens) at any time. You may run into crazed fans who will pick fights or ridicule you, although you're unlikely to get more than a sideways look. There was a time when wearing Cleveland Brown apparel would be cause for concern, but currently this will more than likely get you laughed at. It is also advisable to not wear any athletic apparel of the rival hockey team, the Philadelphia Flyers. Pittsburghers do take their sports loyalty to another level, but will by and large do so in a respectful manner.

* Whether driving, bicycling, or walking, watch out for drivers making the "Pittsburgh Left" (see [[#By car_2|By Car]], above).

* '''[[Cleveland]]''' - with the Rock'n'Roll Hall of Fame and other attractions, a couple of hours to the northwest (though no Pittsburgher would ever advise you to visit willingly).
