'''Budapest''' (Hungarian pronunciation approximates to "boo-dah-pesht") is the capital city of [[Hungary]]. With a unique, youthful atmosphere, a world-class classical music scene as well as a pulsating nightlife increasingly appreciated among European youth and, last but not least, an exceptionally rich offering of natural thermal baths, Budapest is one of Europe's most delightful and enjoyable cities. Due to its scenic setting and its architecture it is nicknamed "Paris of the East".

In 1987 Budapest was added to the [[UNESCO World Heritage List]] for the cultural and architectural significance of the Banks of the Danube, the Buda Castle Quarter, and Andrássy Avenue.

==Districts and quarters==
[[File:Budapest districts.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Districts of Budapest]]
Modern Budapest is the result of a historic amalgamation of the separate cities of Buda and Pest (as well as the smaller and more distant Óbuda), and it is still typical to refer to a restaurant on the "Buda side" or "living in Pest". Administratively, the city is also divided into 23 numbered districts.

* '''[[Budapest/Buda|Buda]]''' - Districts I-III, XI-XII, XXII. Covers the area west of the Danube including Castle Hill, the Buda Hills, and Óbuda to the north. 

* '''[[Budapest/Pest|Pest]]''' - Districts IV-IX, XII-XXI, XXIII. Covers the area east of the Danube.

Budapest is the economic, historic, and cultural capital of Hungary, with approximately 2 million inhabitants and approximately 2.7 million visitors per year. Hungarians are proud of what their beautiful capital has to offer and of its contributions to European culture. They also take pride in their unique language which is very different from all other European languages.

While Buda has been the capital of Hungary - or that of the Osman-occupied territory - for the better part of a millennium, it has become a grand cosmopolitan city during the country's fast industrialization in the late nineteenth century. The population of 2.1 million in 1989 decreased formally due to suburbanization.

===History===
The first settlement on the territory of Budapest is accounted to Celtic tribes. During the first century AD, the Roman fortification on the territory of present-day Óbuda (now part of Budapest) gradually developed into the town of '''Aquincum''' which became the capital city of the province of Lower Pannonia in AD 106. In the beginning, Acquincum was only a Roman military settlement and then it gradually turned into a civil settlement. It was the main center of the Pannonian Region, becoming the most important commercial point. Nowadays the area that was covered by Acquincum corresponds to the Óbuda district within Budapest. Acquincum is the main and well-conserved Roman archaeological site in Hungary. It was turned into a museum with inside and open-air sections. The Roman Ruins in Aquincum have been dated around the 2nd and 3rd century AD. The archaeologists during the excavation works brought back to light a lot of objects and monuments. In the past the city had paved streets and lavish houses with fountains, courtyards, and pavements in mosaic. At the northwest of the ruins is the civil amphitheater in which are still visible the cells in which the lions were kept during the gladiators’ fights. The capacity of this structure was about 16,000 people. The Romans even founded a fortress known as '''Contra Aquincum''' on the other side of the river which is assumed to have developed into the later town of Pest. This was part of the Limes, marking the eastern border of the empire, and was gradually given up by Rome during the early fourth century, becoming part of the Hun empire for a few decades. (Modern historical research does not associate the Huns with Hungarians, albeit even the name of the latter expresses this once popular idea.)  

Once the horse-riding Magyar (Hungarian) tribes arrived in the Carpathian Basin in 896AD, Óbuda served as the seat of the Magyar high-chieftain (or prince) Árpád.

After a century marked by frequent raids in Christian Western Europe, (prince) Álmos realized that converting to Christianity was the key to survival in Europe. The Christian '''Kingdom of Hungary''' was founded by the crowning of his son, '''Szt. István''' (Saint Stephen) on 1 January 1001 (or possibly Christmas day of 1000). As visitors will quickly realize, Saint Stephen became an omnipresent national symbol, as did the artifact known as '''Saint Stephen's Crown''' (the Holy Crown of Hungary) which was regarded as a legal entity ''de jure'' equivalent to the country itself during medieval times. It is still unclear whether the millennium-old crown used in this function for many centuries and shown in the Parliament today was already used by St. Stephen.   

In the following centuries, Buda emerged as the most important royal seat. In 1241/42 the Mongol Empire conquered the territory along with large parts of Europe - this short but devastating conquest of the country is still remembered as tatárjárás - the name reflecting the erroneous confusion of Mongols and Tatars at the time. Medieval Hungary reached its zenith under '''King Matthias''' (Matthias Corvinus), the vividly remembered Renaissance ruler whose patronage of arts and sciences made Hungary, a notable power at the time, the first European country that adopted the Renaissance from Italy. However, after residing in Buda for decades, he moved his seat to Vienna in 1485 for the last five years of his life after defeating the Habsburg Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III.

In 1541, Buda and Pest fell to the Ottoman Empire. The Habsburg Empire, centered in Austria, conquered the country on its way to becoming a major European power in 1686. Marks of these two cultures are still part of everyday life in Budapest. 

The Turks, under their occupation, constructed many thermal baths and some of them are still in function nowadays (Rudas and Király). The citizens of Budapest customarily frequent these baths to this day. 

After the Anti-Habsburg Revolution in 1848–49 (defeated through the decisive help of the Russian Czar) the 1867 Compromise (kiegyezés) with a weakened Vienna made Buda the capital of a near-autonomous Hungary, a large, multi-ethnic-Kingdom-comprising half of the newly created Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary. In this peculiar double-state, the Monarch was emperor and king, respectively, of these two rather autonomous realms. 
The following half-century marked by peaceful development counts among the most successful times in the history of the country as well as its capital. With the 1873 '''unification of Buda, Pest, and Óbuda''', the city of Budapest was officially created. The two parts of the city were already connected by the first permanent bridge across the Danube since 1849 when the magnificent Chain Bridge was inaugurated. It saw a leap in terms of industrialization, urbanization, and the development of a capitalistic society as well as population. It even aimed at rivaling Vienna - the '''Millennium''' in 1896, marking the thousandth year of Hungary offered the perfect excuse for large-scale projects such as the Parliament, Vajdahunyad Castle, or the Grand Boulevard (Nagykörút) - Budapest transformed into a world city during these decades, enriched by Austrian, Jewish, Slovakian, Serbian, Croatian, Roma and other cultural influence. This age is remembered as the 'Monarchia' (or as 'K. u. K.' - abbreviation for Imperial-Royal - in Austria, and other parts of the Empire) and associated with the rule of '''Franz Joseph I.''' (I. Ferenc József) who died in 1916 after 68 years on the throne. 

Neither the Habsburg empire nor Hungary survived World War I in their previous form - leaving Budapest as the capital of a now formally independent Hungary which lost two-thirds of its territories and most of its ethnicities, as well as a few million Hungarian speakers, to neighboring countries. The city's population reached one million around 1930. During the interwar years under the rule of regent Miklós Horthy, a former Admiral of the Austro-Hungarian fleet, Hungary became an ally of Germany. Near the end of World War II, nazi Germany occupied Hungary after it attempted to negotiate a separate peace with the Allies, and eventually installed a bloody dictatorship putting the hitherto fairly unimportant nazi Nyilaskeresztes (Arrow Cross) party in charge. While practically all of 400,000 Jews on the countryside were murdered by German nazis and their Hungarian nyilas sympathizers, roughly 60% of Budapest's Jewish community was saved during the '''Holocaust'''. People we keep in our memory for helping the local Jewish community include '''Raoul Wallenberg''', the famous Swedish diplomat, who organised the distribution of Swedish passports by his Embassy to as many Jews as possible, and the Italian '''Giorgio Perlasca''', who - pretending to be a Spanish diplomat - rescued many thousand Jews.
Air raids and a terrible three-month siege towards the end of World War II resulted in the death of over 38,000 civilians and the destruction of much of the once lively city.

After the war, Budapest slowly recovered and became a showcase for the more pragmatic policies of Hungary's hard-line Communist government under the dictatorial rule of Mátyás Rákosi. The city was, however, also the main site of the '''1956 uprising''' which was successful in installing a reform-oriented (albeit Communist) government of '''Imre Nagy'''. This was swept away before long, as the Soviet leader Khrushchev felt Hungary slipping from Moscow's rule. The Soviets installed János Kádár as the leader of the Communist state who, after over thirty years of controversial rule, was elected out of leadership in 1988 by the central committee due to health issues. Kádár died in 1989. 

The October 23 1956 uprising was one of the most dramatic historical events of the country. This uprising lasted until November 11 of the same year. During the revolution, more than 2000 Hungarians lost their lives. A monument erected in 2006 commemorates this tragic event. The monument is in iron and wood and is found at the edge of City Park. It symbolizes the Hungarian forces that eradicated the communist dictatorship. October 23 is a national holiday commemorating the uprising.

Since the peaceful 1989 'system change' ('''rendszerváltás''') which was achieved as a compromise between reformist party forces and the opposition (notably including a younger self of the current PM, Viktor Orbán), Budapest transformed in appearance and atmosphere, a process further accelerated by the country's long-awaited joining of the European Union in 2004.

===Cost of living===
Visitors will notice that (except for touristy attractions and restaurants) many items cost less in Hungary than in Western Europe. Hungarian salaries are lower also, to the extent that when compared to income, the relative cost of living is actually quite high. Unemployment is also high, and many people are employed in low-paying jobs, so a higher proportion of the population has difficulty making ends meet. Even university-educated middle-class citizens with "good" jobs generally have less disposable income for luxuries and conveniences than their counterparts in Western Europe.

For Hungarians who can afford it, and for visitors who earn their money in wealthier countries, Budapest offers everything that other modern cities can offer in terms of accommodations, entertainment, shopping, and culture. Tourist attractions, restaurants, and accommodations generally charge prices on par or slightly below similar places in Western Europe (since visitors can afford to pay and prices seem reasonable by their standards).

===Climate===
The climate of Budapest is continental with cold winters and warm summers. Budapest has one of the highest differences between the highest and lowest recorded temperatures as the record high is 40°C (104°F) and the record low is -25°C (-14°F). The coldest months are from November to March with January being the coldest one with the average low and high being -4°C (25°F) and 1°C (33°F) respectively. Winters are also cloudy with an average of only 48 monthly sunshine hours on average in December. Temperatures at around -15°C (5°F) aren't uncommon during this part of the year. Snowfalls happen many times annually with as much as 20-40 cm falling in a single day. 

Summers on the other hand are pretty warm with the average 24-hour high in July being 20.8°C (69.4°F) similar to cities like [[Vienna]] or [[Bratislava]] to the west. Temperatures above 30°C (86°F) are common and they can occasionally reach 35°C (95°F) during heat waves. Summer is also the rainiest part of the year.

It is also possible to fly to airports in Debrecen, Sármellék, Győr-Pér and Pécs-Pogány. Liszt Ferenc Airport, also commonly referred to by the old name ''Ferihegy'', is Hungary's largest airport and it is located about 16km (10 miles) southeast of the city center. It is a small airport by international standards, easy to navigate, and well connected to the city by public transit. Tickets will direct visitors to either terminal "2A" (gates 20-30, Schengen area destinations) or "2B" (gates 11-19, non-Schengen area destinations), but the airport is now only one terminal, and 2A and 2B simply refer to two halves of the same building. The signs point to separate security entrances for 2A or 2B. Both lead to the same post-security area, so in practice, travelers can easily use either entrance, especially if queues are longer at one than the other. Behind security, there are typical airport shops and services, including duty-free stores operated by Heinemann, luxury brand shops, fast-food stops, restaurants, and cafes.</listing>

=====Long-haul Connections=====
LOT Polish Airlines[https://www.lot.com/lt/en] now operates a non-stop flight to Chicago, USA (ORD), using brand new Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft.

====To/from the airport====
'''Bus 200E'''. The main public transit connection from the airport to the city is to take bus 200E from the airport to metro M3 (blue line) terminus 'Kőbánya-Kispest' (~25 minutes). Since 6 April 2019, the 200E has been operating non-stop, day and night, on an extended route between the Airport and Nagyvárad tér (~35 minutes), while line M3 is being refurbished. Between Kőbánya-Kispest and Nagyvárad tér, it also stops at Határ út and Népliget. Then continue within the metro system (~20-30 minutes to the city center from Kőbánya-Kispest, ~10 minutes from Nagyvárad tér). During the night, the bus departs from Határ út metro station which offers better transfer connections to night buses serving the city center.

One public transport ticket for each leg. (See Get Around for ticket information.) The route is well marked with signs and the bus runs frequently. The bus stops almost right next to the metro stop but be prepared to carry luggage up or down some stairs.

'''Bus 100E'''[https://bkk.hu/en/airport-shuttle]. This is a special fare airport shuttle bus that operates directly between 'Deák Ferenc tér' metro station in the Pest city center and 'Liszt Ferenc Airport Terminal 2' (~40 minutes) every 30 minutes. Tickets can be bought at BKK customer centers, cash desks, and automated ticket machines. 100E buses have a special design to make them easy to recognize and you validate your ticket in the machine next to the driver. These buses also stop at 'Astoria' [https://www.bud.hu/en/passengers/transport/public_transportation/budapest_public_transportation station] and 'Kálvin tér' and in the city center of Pest each way. These special fare buses operate from 04:00 - 21:00 from 'Deák Ferenc tér' and 4:45 - 21:00 every day from the airport. 

It is also possible to take the 200E bus to the local Ferihegy train station and continue on the MÁV network to Nyugati station in Budapest or other rail destinations. 

'''Official shuttle''' -  MiniBUD.hu[https://www.minibud.hu]. Since 2016, official shuttle services have been operated by MiniBUD Ltd. One-way fares range from 1900 to 6500 HUF, depending on the destination within Budapest.

===By train===
[[File:Budapest - Keleti pályaudvar (East main railway station).jpg|thumb|300px|Keleti pályaudvar (Eastern main railway station)]]
Trains connect Budapest with almost all countries in central and eastern Europe. The main railway stations ''(pályaudvar)'' are '''Keleti pályaudvar''' (Eastern Railway Station), '''Déli pályaudvar''' (Southern Railway Station) and '''Nyugati pályaudvar''' (Western Railway Station). All are well connected to the metro system. Most international trains arrive at Keleti but check your particular itinerary[https://www.mavcsoport.hu].
* [[Belgrade]]: 8h, one daytime train ''Avala'' and one night train ''Beograd''. 
* [[Berlin]]: 11¾h, direct trains daily, or an overnight option.
* [[Bratislava]]: 2¾h, six EC trains a day. €17.50 for a return ticket (April 2016). The earliest train is the sleeper ''Metropol'', departing the hl. n. at 5.45am. A 'special' priced ticket can be bought up to the day before departure for €9 one-way, valid for any train so long as it follows the main route which passes by Szob at the Hungarian border. However, not every sales clerk appears to know this; please inform them of this promotion when purchasing. You can see some very nice views of the Danube cutting through the countryside as the train approaches Hungary. 
* [[Bucharest]]: 16h, two night trains ''Dacia'' and ''Ister'' and one daytime direct train ''Traianus''. ''Ister'' tickets starting at €29 can be  booked online[http://elvira.mav-start.hu]. Normal tickets cost about 50 euros or more.
* [[Kyiv]] and [[Moscow]]: 25h/39h, fast train ''Tisza'', a typical Russian long-distance train going over 2 nights. An international ticket is much more expensive than a domestic Russian, especially a Ukrainian domestic ticket. If you are on a tight budget, use another train from Kyiv (departing at 18:52 or 20:06) to Chop (arriving at 10:04 or 10:52) near the UA/HU border. In Chop, buy a ticket for the local train to Záhony (HU), and in Záhony buy a ticket for the IC to Budapest (arriving at 18:37). You have more than 3 hours in Chop and 1 hour in Záhony to buy your tickets - and there are later trains from Záhony to Budapest too. The overall trip is even shorter than that on the direct train and you'll pay less than half of the official international fare. Beware that Ukraine uses Eastern European Time, which is one hour ahead of Central European Time. Local residents of Chop and Zakarpathya Oblast use CET among themselves, they call it 'local time'.
* [[Ljubljana]]: 9-10h, ''Rippl-Rónai'' via Zagreb or change at Maribor for IC ''Citadella''. One direct night train (Ljubljana: 00:15 - Budapest: 08:29)
* [[Munich]]: 7½h, four daytime ''Railjet'' trains and one night train ''Kálmán Imre''. Cheaper if bought online at [http://www.bahn.de], at least 3 days in advance. 
* [[Prague]]: 7h, direct trains almost every two hours and night train ''Metropol''. Online tickets[https://www.cd.cz/en/default.htm] are cheaper than normal tickets (the price begins at €19), but you should buy them at least 3 days in advance. If e-tickets are sold out or you have to buy a ticket immediately before departure, buy a (domestic) ticket from Prague-Kúty Gr. (the CZ/SK border point) and international tickets from Kúty Gr.-Štúrovo and Štúrovo-Budapest. This combination costs about 65% of the direct ticket.
* [[Sarajevo]]: Only possible via Zagreb with 12 hours of waiting at Zagreb Glavni Kolodvor.
* [[Sofia]]: 18¼h, ''Balkan Express'' with a through couchette car via Belgrade. Direct ticket is expensive, the better solution is to buy a  [[Belgrade#By train|Sofia-Belgrade ticket]]) and then a Belgrade-Budapest ticket at Belgrade station. The through car waits 2.5 hours in Belgrade and even if ''Balkan Express'' is delayed (a quite common situation), you have time until the through car is shifted to the train to Budapest. ''Balkan Express'' leaves Sofia at noon and arrives at Belgrade in the evening, so you can travel to Belgrade in a sitting car, and buy a cheaper couchette reservation only from Belgrade to Budapest.
* [[Vienna]]: 2.5-3h. High-speed services every two hours. The train connects Budapest Keleti to several main stations in Vienna. Tickets are cheaper if booked in advance. Expect to pay around €20-30. Slow/regional train options are also possible.
* [[Warsaw]]: 10½h, one direct day train, one direct night train, and three daytime trains that require a transfer. Starting around €29.
* [[Zagreb]]: 6-7h, two daytime trains a day, ''Agram'' and ''Rippl-Rónai''. Different seasonal trains to various sea resorts. A return ticket valid for 1 month costs about €30 and it's even cheaper than a one-way ticket. There is a seasonal sleeper train twice a week to [[Split]].
* [[Zürich]]: one direct daytime railjet and direct night train ''Wiener Walzer''.

===By bus===
Hungary’s national bus network is operated by '''Volán Association''' [https://www.menetrendek.hu/mobile/?lng=en]. If you arrive in Budapest from another Hungarian city, the bus is often the best option. International bus routes are operated by '''Eurolines''' ph.+36-1 318-2122 [http://www.volanbusz.hu/en/#indexmainpage]. Most connections run two or three times a week; connections to/from [[Austria]] and [[Slovakia]] run daily. '''Eurobusways''' [http://www.eurobusways.com/] do shared or private transfers from door to door from Budapest to many destinations including [[Slovakia]], [[Croatia]], [[Poland]], [[Austria]], [[Slovenia]], [[Romania]]

Budapest’s long-distance bus stations are located outside the city center but are very well connected to the rest of the city. The main stations are:
* '''Etele tér Bus Station''' (''Etele téri autóbuszállomás'', metro 4 ''Kelenföld vasútállomás station''). This is a newly built station next to Kelenföld Railway Station, at the terminus of metro line 4. Useful for getting to Statue Park and some suburban destinations.
* '''Népliget Bus station''' (''Népliget autóbuszállomás'', metro 3, ''Népliget station''). Buses from abroad and most Western Hungarian destinations arrive and depart here. It is a fairly modern station with reliable facilities. Do not forget to check in if you travel abroad.
* '''Stadion Bus Station''' (''Stadion autóbuszállomás'', formerly known as ''Népstadion autóbuszállomás'', metro 2 ''Puskás Ferenc Stadion station''). This is the biggest hub for Eastern Hungarian destinations, with quite a modern but somewhat dirty station built underground.
* '''Széll Kálmán tér Bus Station''' (''Széll Kálmán téri autóbuszállomás'', metro 2 ''Széll Kálmán tér station''). This is also a newly built station (with the closure of Széna tér Bus Station). Some suburban destinations to the northwest may be reached from here.
* '''Újpest-Városkapu Bus Station''' (''Újpest-Városkapu autóbuszállomás'', metro 3, ''Újpest-Városkapu station''). This is a small station, which covers Northern destinations and suburban traffic; use it to and from [[Szentendre]], [[Esztergom]], or [[Visegrád]]. Alternatively for Esztergom, you might also take '''Árpád híd Bus Station''', which can also be accessed via metro 3.

===By car===
Major motorways connect Budapest to other cities and neighboring countries and driving is often the fastest way to reach long-distance destinations. For those who have flexible schedules and are comfortable traveling with strangers, ridesharing is often the cheapest and fastest way to make a trip.

===By boat===
* Mahart Passnave[https://mahartpassnave.hu/en] operates a hydrofoil boat service on the Danube to and from [[Vienna]] from May to September. Tickets start at 99 EUR one way or 125 EUR return.

==Get around==

===Public transport===
Budapest's extensive public transit system is generally convenient and easy to use. Tourists can navigate most central areas by metro, but a few major destinations, particularly on the Buda side, are served by buses or trams. Unfortunately, compared to similarly-sized cities in Western Europe, Budapest's public transit infrastructure is generally more worn-down, outdated, dirtier, less reliable, and less comfortable. Ticketing systems are not automated, many vehicles are insufficiently or not at all heated/air conditioned, and mechanical problems are frequent. Nonetheless, for getting from A to B, public transit is still a good option, and many routes frequented by tourists (e.g. the bus to the airport) are more modern and clean. The company responsible for local transport is BKK. Its website has an English version [https://www.bkk.hu/en/], it provides maps, schedules, and also a journey planner. 

{{cautionbox|Remember to '''validate your ticket''', major tourist stops are regularly policed! This means that after purchasing a ticket, the traveler needs to get it punched or stamped before boarding the metro or once on board the bus/tram. Look for a box about the size of a toaster and insert your ticket. If it's the older mechanical version, then you also have to pull the top part firmly towards yourself in order to punch holes into the ticket. An unvalidated ticket is invalid! So forgetting to punch your ticket is the same as traveling with no ticket at all. Ticket inspectors are frequent and fines can be heavy. }}

====Tickets and passes====
[[File:Bkv200902.jpg|thumb|Single ticket, valid for one journey]]
Most types of tickets and passes can be purchased from 300 BKK vending machines around the city, or on your mobile phone. There are customer service points at most of the main transport hubs[https://bkk.hu/en/about-bkk/contacts/bkk-customer-service-centres/] as well. A single ticket may also be purchased from the driver for a higher price, but note that it can be a lengthy process, and the driver may not have changed or may refuse to sell you a ticket on board on a busy line, so please only use this option as a last resort.

If you plan on using public transport frequently, downloading the BudapestGO[https://bkk.hu/en/tickets-and-passes/budapestgo/] application on your phone is recommended. The app displays real-time traffic information and is great for planning journeys with up-to-date information. The app shows all public transport vehicles (buses, trams, metros, etc.) along with MÁV trains and most Volán bus services.

Some useful options for public transport include:
*'''15-day pass''' (''kétheti Budapest-bérlet'', lit. two-week Budapest pass): Valid from 00:00 on the indicated starting day until 02:00 on the following fifteenth day (start+15), with a photo ID (e.g. passport). Valid also on MÁV trains and suburban Volán buses within the city boundaries. HUF6300.
*'''24-hour group travelcard''' (''csoportos 24 órás jegy''): For a maximum of 5 people traveling together. Valid for 24 hours after purchase. HUF5000.
*'''24-hour travelcard''' (''24 órás jegy''): Valid for 24 hours after purchase. Valid also on MÁV trains and suburban Volán buses within the city boundaries and boat services (D11, D12, D13) on workdays only. No validation is required before boarding. HUF2500.
*'''30 and 90-minute tickets''' (''30 perces / 90 perces jegy''): Only available through the BudapestGO mobile app. Tickets are valid from validation, for 30 or 90 minutes. The ticket must be validated/scanned when getting on each vehicle. After the ticket expires, you can still finish your trip, as long as you started it within the time limit (e.g if the 30 minutes are up, you don't need to get off, and you can still ride the vehicle as long as you boarded within the 30-minute window). Not valid on MÁV trains or Volán buses. 30-minute ticket: HUF530, 90-minute ticket: HUF750.
*'''72-hour travelcard''' (''72 órás jegy''): Valid for 72 hours after purchase. The 72-hour travel card can be of excellent value if one is using public transport multiple times during a 3-day visit. The 72-hour pass is almost equal to 16 single tickets. The pass also removes the validation issues that can occur, especially on buses/trams. HUF5500.
*'''Block of 10 single tickets''' (''gyűjtőjegy''): Ten single tickets. HUF3000
*'''Budapest card''' (''Budapest kártya''): Travelcard that also offers discounts at museums and restaurants. 24-hour card HUF4,900, 48-hour card HUF7900, 72-hour card HUF9900.

Requires student ID from a European country or ISIC. HUF3450. If staying for more than two days, this is cheaper than a 72-hour pass.
*'''Single ticket (100E airport express bus)''' (''Repülőtéri vonaljegy'') Single ticket for the 100E express shuttle bus, which operates between Deák Ferenc tér (city center) and the airport. Can also be bought on the bus with a debit card by using the Pay&Go system[https://bkk.hu/en/tickets-and-passes/pay-and-go/]. HUF2200.
*'''Single ticket (public transport boat)''' (''Hajó vonaljegy''): Valid for one uninterrupted journey on the whole length of lines D11, D12 and D13. It can be purchased from the crew. HUF750.
*'''Single ticket''' (''vonaljegy'' or ''jegy''): Valid for one uninterrupted journey on the whole length of a line (only within the city limits on suburban railways). Transfers are not allowed on buses and trams. A transfer between metro lines (M1, M2, M3, M4) is allowed. Price: HUF450 (HUF600 if purchased from the driver, available on almost every bus and trolley bus line). Validate before boarding the metro or right onboarding a surface vehicle! Not valid on MÁV trains and suburban Volán buses!

Traveling without a valid ticket or pass can result in hefty fines. Ticket inspections are frequent on busy lines, especially in tourist-frequented areas. Ticket inspectors generally wear a white or purple uniform, but always wear a purple armband with the BKK logo. The fine for traveling without a valid ticket is HUF12000 but can rise to HUF25000 if the fine isn't paid in 2 business days. If you get fined, you can pay on the spot with cash or sometimes with a debit card. You can also pay your fine in a BKK customer service center, or via bank transfer. Ticket inspectors may also fine you for violating the travel terms, such as eating or drinking on board or improperly transporting animals or bicycles. While this is rarer, it can happen, especially to tourists, so always double-check that you have the correct ticket (and it's validated) and that you are transporting your animal or bicycle properly.

Most tickets and passes can also be purchased through the BudapestGO app. Tickets bought through the app must still be validated. To validate your e-ticket, scan the QR codes placed next to each door. Please note that on most vehicles, there are no QR codes inside, so you must validate your ticket before boarding, otherwise, you won't have a valid ticket. Most stickers also have NFC tags. This will be indicated by a special symbol on the sticker. To validate using NFC, simply hold your phone close to the sticker. 

Passes don't need to be validated, but you must scan the QR code or use the NFC stickers when boarding a bus that is "front-door boarding only", and show the animation that shows up to the driver. If you have an e-pass and get approached by ticket inspectors, press the dedicated 'inspector' button and show the QR code to the ticket inspector. More detailed information on how to use e-tickets can be found in the BudapestGO app, with visual guides.

==== Daylight services ====
[[File:Budapest Metro station Deák tér.jpg|thumb|300px|Budapest Metro station Deák tér]]
'''Metro'''
[[Image:Budapest alstom metro blaha square 2012.jpg|thumb|300|Blaha Lujza square metro 2 station with the new Alstom carriage in service from 2012]]
The '''underground network''' consists of four lines (Metro 4 opened in March 2014), connecting several centrally located sights, railway and autobus stations with suburbs. The lines cross only at '''Deák tér station''' in central Pest with the exception of line 4. Many stations have been recently renovated and usually have small shops, bakeries, and various other businesses.

* The historic '''line M1''' or '''Millennium Subway''' (yellow line) connects the Városliget (City park) with touristy Vörösmarty tér in the center of Pest, making stops at the Opera and Heroes' Square, as it mostly follows the majestic boulevard Andrássy út. Notably, the line was the first underground in continental Europe (preceded by London) constructed as part of the Millennium celebrations in 1896. Although the stylish vehicles are not original, the renovated, tile-covered stations retain a historical atmosphere.
* '''Line M2''' (red line) connects Déli pályaudvar (Southern Railway Station, in Buda) with Eastern Pest, passing Széll Kálmán tér M (former Moszkva tér, Buda's top transport hub), Kossuth tér (the Parliament) and Keleti pályaudvar (Eastern Railway Station).
* '''Line M3''' (blue line) can assist you in reaching the Airport as you can change to Bus 200 at Kőbánya-Kispest terminus. A notable station is the historic Nyugati pályaudvar (Western Railway Station). Due to reconstruction, as of 7 November 2020, metro line M3 is out of service between Nagyvárad tér and Lehel tér. Check here[https://bkk.hu/en/news/2020/11/travel-options-during-the-reconstruction-of-the-middle-section-of-metro-line-m3.5957/] for information.
* '''Line M4''' (green line) connects the Keleti pályaudvar International Railway terminal in Pest with Kelenföld railway station in Buda. Important stops include Gellért tér for the famous Gellért Baths and Fővám tér for the Central Market Hall.

'''Suburban rail'''
Green suburban railway lines (called '''HÉV''') connect central Budapest with several suburbs. Note that your tickets and travel passes are valid only within the city boundaries, otherwise, you should purchase a supplementary ticket (kiegészítő jegy) at a ticket office. These lines are numbered H5 to H9.
* '''Line H5''' goes upriver to the nearby baroque town of [[Szentendre]]. It connects at Batthyány tér with metro 2, at Margit híd (Margaret bridge) with tram 4/6.
* '''Line H8''' takes you to the beautiful royal castle of [[Gödöllő]] from the M2 terminus Örs vezér tere M.

'''Tram''' 
Budapest's 32 (as of April 2021) tram lines offer a slower but more scenic way of getting around. Some of the more notable ones are
* Lines '''4''' and '''6''', along the Grand Boulevard (Nagykörút) of Pest, is the busiest surface line in the city and, according to some, the most traveled tram line in the world. It runs from Széll Kálmán tér M to south Buda (Újbuda-központ M / Móricz Zsigmond körtér M respectively), crossing the Danube twice.
* Line '''2''' is a scenic but swift route along the Pest side of the Danube, offering majestic views of the Buda castle. (It is considered as the  top trolley ride in Europe by National Geographic[http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/top-10/trolley-rides/#page=2].)
* Lines '''19''' and '''41''' are the counterparts of Line 2 on the Buda side. The southern end of line 41 offers a rather rural ride to Kamaraerdő.
* Lines '''47''' and '''49''' run along Lesser Boulevard and connect it to Móricz Zsigmond körtér M, the main hub of south Buda.
* Line '''56''' (or '''56A''') runs along Buda Boulevard from south to north and then takes the historical route westwards up to Hűvösvölgy, the gateway to the Buda hills.
[[Image:Villamos.jpg|thumb|160|In 2006 the world's longest trams started their service on lines 4 and 6]]

'''Bus'''  
[[Image:busz.jpg|thumb|160|Blue urban bus in Buda]]   
The dense bus network connects the suburban zones with several metro and train stations and the city center. 
* Numbers with an added 'E' (for example 7E or 200E) indicate express services that don't stop at all stops. 
* Numbers with an added 'A' have shorter routes than their regular counterparts (for example bus 30 has a longer itinerary than 30A). The letter 'B' usually denotes a slightly altered route of the number-only version.
* Numbers between 900 and 999 denote night services.
* Numbers between 300 and 899 denote mid-range suburban services provided by the Volán company, BKK tickets, and most tourist passes are not valid on them, but local monthly, weekly, and day passes are.

Some of the most notable services are
* '''The 7-axis''', served by many express and local lines in addition to no. 7, runs along the most important east-west thoroughfare of Budapest, making stops at the international railway terminus Keleti pályaudvar, then along Rákóczi út (take it to Uránia for the nightlife in/around Kazinczy u.) and over the Danube on the Elizabeth bridge.
* Line '''200E''' is the daytime connection to the airport from Kőbánya-Kispest M.

'''Trolleybus'''
Budapest's 13 trolleybus lines run mostly in northeast and central Pest. Some of them pass through the City Park (Városliget) and cross Andrássy Avenue (Andrássy út), giving you beautiful views while using this eco-friendly mode of transport. Line '''70''', connecting Kossuth Lajos tér M (Parliament) to the City Park (Városliget) also passes through the lively Nagymező Street, Budapest's "Broadway". The reason why the numbering starts with 70 is a historical one: the first trolleybus line started on Dec. 21, 1949, the 70th birthday of the Soviet dictator Stalin.

'''Other'''
[[Image:fogas.jpg|thumb|160|Tram 60 (aka cogwheel railway) at Városmajor terminus]]
Some more exotic means of public transport may help you to escape from the hustle and bustle to the lush green hills surrounding Budapest.

* '''Cogwheel railway''' (Fogaskerekű vasút), numbered '''60''', is a rack railway with historic charm, running from Városmajor terminus (two stops from Széll Kálmán tér metro station (M2) by tram 59 or 61) climbing Széchenyi hill (Széchenyi hegy), Buda's popular picnic, excursion, and sledding place. BKK tickets and passes are valid.

* '''Boat'''. Budapest currently (starting with July 2012) has three regular boat services, running hourly between around 6am and 8pm, from Kopaszi-gát (South Buda) or Haller utca (South-Central Pest) to Rómaifürdő (North Buda) or Árpád út (North Pest), making 8-10 intermediate stops. Tickets cost 750 HUF - ordinary tickets are NOT valid. BKK passes are, however, valid on weekdays.

* '''Buda Castle funicular''' (Budavári sikló). This handsome, short funicular line takes you from Chain Bridge (Lánchíd) Buda end to Buda Castle offering a breath-taking scenario as it emerges from street level. Originally built in 1870, it was completely destroyed in the War, only to be reconstructed in 1986. As it is considered a tourist sight, tickets and passes are NOT valid.

* '''Széchenyi Hill Children's Railway''' (Széchenyi-hegyi Gyermekvasút), operated by the Hungarian State Railways, is a narrow gauge line run partly by children. The 11.2km long line runs in the Buda Hills, providing a beautiful look at the nature around Budapest. You can reach the terminal station ''Széchenyi-hegy'' by the cogwheel railway, or the other one, ''Hűvösvölgy'', by taking the tram number 61 from ''Széll Kálmán tér''. Before using it, you should take a look at its home page for the timetable at [https://gyermekvasut.hu/en/home/]. Regular tickets and passes are NOT valid.

====Night lines====
Tram 6 along Nagykörút (Pest's ring road) is round-the-clock.
Apart from that, Budapest is fully covered by 34-night bus lines. Numbers are triple-digit, starting with '9', their timetables are marked with an owl. Buses on most lines run every 15-60 minutes from around 11pm until 4am. The main hubs for the night bus network are Széll Kálmán square (former Moszkva tér) in Buda and Astoria (junction of Kossuth Lajos utca–Károly körút) in Pest. Daytime tickets and passes are valid. All the services on the scheme are at [http://www.bkk.hu/apps/docs/terkep/ejsz_sematikus.pdf]. Some of the most useful night buses are:
* '''900''' is the one that takes you to/from the airport at night. It's a little complicated though: one has to change from/for 950 at Üllői út or Honvéd utca.
* '''907''', '''973''' substitute daytime bus line '''7''' and metro line M4
* '''914''', '''950''' substitute metro line M3 (on slightly different routes)
* '''956''', '''990''' cover most of metro line M2

===By car===
Apart from the summer holiday, Budapest has heavy traffic, especially in the morning and in the late afternoon. If you don't want to spend your visit to Budapest in a traffic jam, leave your car in the hotel's garage, and use public transport. 
Driving across the center requires some local know-how to be efficient. For example, you cannot turn left in most of the crossings of the great boulevard (Nagykörút) or on the main avenues like Andrássy út, Váci út, Üllői út or Rákóczi út.

You can rent a car in Budapest for center[https://www.carngo.com/car-rental/hungary-budapest], and see the surroundings of the city on it.

===By taxi===
When you get to the airport be aware of taxi touts waiting in the arrivals hall. They will usually overcharge you. So unless you enjoy bargaining with taxi drivers the best thing you can do when arriving in Budapest is to exit the arrivals hall and look for the taxi booth directly outside. (Főtaxi currently has the airport contract.) Tell the English-speaking dispatcher where you need to go and receive a voucher with the destination address and number of the taxi line. The driver will ask to see this and then return it. There are no fixed-priced airport transfers, every trip is priced by the distance of the destination.
   
In normal traffic conditions, you can get around in the central areas in 10-25 minutes by car. Taxi rides cost a 1000 HUF base price and 400 HUF for every kilometer. Time-based fare unit 100 HUF per minute. The ride from the airport to the downtown area takes about 35 minutes and costs about 8,000 forints when the traffic is light and otherwise about 1,000 more. Going to the airport will cost 1,300 more because the taxi will have to pay that much to enter the terminal area.

Budapest's taxi drivers are not always prepared for English-speaking clients, but it does not necessarily mean that they intend to overcharge their foreign guests – you can call one of the major taxi companies with English speaking switchboards to avoid problems. Most companies' websites now have pages in English.

'''Do not accept offers from taxi drivers waiting in the airport terminals or railway stations. Use your common sense, sit only in taxis carrying logos of bigger companies.'''

Many taxis parked in the downtown areas do not belong to radio taxi companies and charge much more than the usual HUF 400 per km. Ask about their price in advance or call any of the taxi companies below.

If you are forced to take a taxi from the street, try to pick one with the meter in a place where the driver can't fiddle with it while driving. (While the fare per kilometer stays the same, it may sometimes be possible to "bump" the price by adding extra basic fees.) Asking the approximate price in advance may be a good idea in such cases.

Note that calling your own taxi is usually cheaper than having one booked for you in a hotel.

Tell the driver in time if you need a receipt.

A ruling requires all taxis to have a universal yellow color. You can book a taxi in advance. 

===By bicycle===
For those comfortable with urban cycling, the bicycle is a relatively cheap and convenient way to get around. Bike paths range in style from car-free dedicated bicycle paths to on-street painted bicycle lanes to normal traffic routes painted with "bicycle route" markers. Cycling on non-marked paths is generally possible for confident cyclists except on busy major thoroughfares. On some major routes, the right-most lane is reserved for buses, taxis, and cyclists only. Some intersections have bicycle traffic lights. Often one-way streets allow cycling in both directions. Signs are marked "kivéve", meaning "except" ("one-way street, except for bicycles"). Many pathways (whether marked or unmarked) are mixed use for both pedestrians and cyclists and (slow speed) cycling on the sidewalk is generally tolerated when necessary. Cyclists should ring their bell in advance if approaching pedestrians who are walking on a marked bicycle path.

Bikes can only be taken on the HÉV (suburban train), the Fogaskerekű (the mountain cogwheel railway starting at Városmajor), a few tram lines, and on (most) long-distance trains. A supplementary bicycle ticket is usually required.

Visitors wishing to cycle can join an organized bike tour, rent a bicycle from a shop, or use the "Bubi" public transport bicycle service. See "do" for information about renting a bicycle. Longer-term visitors may wish to purchase a bicycle. Basic functional used bicycles start around 20000 HUF.

As with most major cities, there are street bikes which can be hired, this is called ''Bubi''. However, they are not really intended for use by tourists. Usage requires a pass, then the first 30 min of use is free. However after penalty charges are applied and a significant bill can be incurred, use of the bikes for 7 hrs will cost in the region of €45. No pricing structure is displayed on the hiring stations, so be wary. The best option is to hire the bikes from the hotel or local shop.

If you are heading from North to South on '''Eurovelo6'''[https://en.eurovelo.com/ev6/hungary] you can take a rest and find a bicycle repair station with some important tools at '''Yacht Club Budapest''' (Budapest district 3., Kossuth Lajos üdülőpart 115.)

Similarly to the systems in other major European cities, users purchase an access ticket and can pick up a bicycle at one of many stations located throughout the city. Once the user has an access ticket, bicycles can be taken for free for up to 30 minutes at a time. (After that, the bicycle must be returned and re-withdrawn, or surcharges will be applied.) Access tickets start at 500 HUF for a 24-hour period. Bicycle stations are located throughout the central part of the city.</do>

===By scooter===
Although not as fancy as in Rome or Paris, scooters are becoming more common in the streets of Budapest. Inside the city scooters can be driven on the tram and busways, often buzzing in between traffic. Although most car drivers are quite used to the scooters around them, some can still be slightly irresponsible. Ignore their pushiness and drive conservatively and you should not experience any problems. The best roads are the main ring roads as these have plenty of space and good asphalt. The smaller in-between roads and roads in hilly Buda can be of lesser quality with some unexpected potholes or tough-to-see speed bumps. 

A limited number of companies offer scooter rental and scooter tours inside the city center. Expect to pay around HUF 6000 for a day. Some companies that offer scooter rental are:
*'''Retro Robogó''' ph.+36-70 432-0444. Rent a scooter starting at 3,600 HUF per day (week rental).

In Hungary scooters with an engine up to 50cc can be driven without a license plate and only a regular car driver's license. However, these 50cc scooters cannot be driven by a passenger. Helmets are compulsory. For scooters and motorcycles with an engine size above 50cc, a license plate and motorcycle driver's license are required. If you are experienced with driving a scooter, it is a great way to experience the city

[[File:Budapest from Gellert Hill MC.jpg|thumb|750px|center| Budapest as seen from the Gellért Hill. Left: the Buda Castle, middle: the Széchenyi Chain Bridge, right: the Hungarian Parliament Building.]]

===On foot===
Most of Budapest's highlights are within easy walking distance of each other and the city center. All major areas have sidewalks and crosswalks for pedestrians. Drivers generally obey traffic signals, and similar to other major European cities, pedestrians should firmly indicate their intention to cross at a crosswalk. Many sidewalks and paths tend to be mixed-use for both pedestrians and cyclists.

===Bridges===
The river Danube splits the city approximately in half, with the west side called [[Buda]] and the east called [[Pest]]. North/south orientation can be referred to relative to the city's bridges:
[[File:Lánchíd (17. számú műemlék) 23.jpg|thumb|300px|The Chain Bridge and a view of Pest]]

* <see name="Árpád Bridge" alt="Árpád híd" address="" directions="" lat="" long="" phone="" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">A modern bridge linking to Northern Margaret Island. The longest bridge in Budapest is at 973 meters. It was inaugurated in 1950 where the Romans previously erected a bridge to connect Acquincum with another settlement on the Pest side.</see>
* <see name="Chain Bridge" alt="Széchenyi lánchíd" address="" directions="" lat="" long="" phone="" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">Completed in 1849, the oldest, arguably most beautiful, and certainly the most photographed of Budapest's bridges, floodlit at night. It was the first permanent bridge across the Danube. At the time of its construction, it was the second-largest suspension bridge in the world. The suspension structure of the bridge is made of chains whose links are huge dog-bone-shaped metal bars linked by pins at their ends. Make sure you stop by after dark to take a picture as the bridge is beautifully lit up. Four stone lions took their place at the edge of the bridge in 1852. They fortunately survived the air raids of World War II.</see>
* <see name="Elizabeth Bridge" alt="Erzsébet híd" address="" directions="" lat="" long="" phone="" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">Completed in 1903. Its original chain structure was destroyed in World War II, and was eventually substituted by a modern cable bridge opened in 1964. This bridge in liberty style was dedicated to the murdered Queen in 1898. It is the third newest bridge in the city.</see>
* <see name="Liberty Bridge" alt="Szabadság híd" address="" directions="" lat="" long="" phone="" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">Elegant but simple, opened in 1896; it connects the Gellért Baths (Gellért fürdő) in Buda with the Great Market Hall (Nagyvásárcsarnok) in Pest. Recently renovated. This bridge was rebuilt in Art Nouveau style on the occasion of the Hungarian millenary festivities of 1989.</see>
* <see name="Margaret Bridge" alt="Margit híd" address="" directions="" lat="" long="" phone="" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">Easily identified thanks to its distinctive shape: it makes an approximately 35° turn halfway across, at the southern tip of Margaret Island. Trams 4 and 6 cross the Danube here. This bridge was built in 1901 and then destroyed during the war by an explosion. It was rebuilt in 1948. It is located in the north of the city center.</see>
* <see name="Petőfi Bridge" alt="Petőfi híd" address="" directions="" lat="" long="" phone="" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">For a long time, the southernmost bridge links the inner ring road (Nagykörút) of Pest with Buda. It was built during the 30s, destroyed by an explosion in World War II, and then rebuilt in 1952.</see>
* <see name="Rákóczi Bridge" alt="Rákóczi híd" address="" directions="" lat="" long="" phone="" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">The second newest bridge in Budapest as of 2013, with modern architecture and a spectacular lighting system where mirrors reflect the beam of the upward-facing floodlights. Built very next to a railway bridge on its southern side. Originally called Lágymányosi Bridge, it was built between 1992 and 1995, initially destined to smoothen the augmented traffic flow during the 1996 expo that finally never took place in Budapest.</see>

It is located in the city center just at the end of Váci Utca (do not confuse it with Váci ut which is a completely different street!). It is the largest and oldest covered market in the city. This is the right place to buy a Hungarian souvenir or to eat traditional food. Normal hours are 6am - 6pm. Closes early at 5pm on Mondays, 3pm on Saturdays. Closed on Sundays and public holidays.</see>
* <see name="Citadella" alt="" address="Budapest, Citadella stny. 1, 1118" directions="" lat="" long="" phone="" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">The former fortress on top of '''Gellérthegy''', offers a superb panorama over Central Budapest including the bank of the Danube River, Buda Castle, and Pest City. To get good views up and down the Danube, take the steps going down in front of the Liberty Statue in front of the Citadella. There are several outposts offering good photo opportunities. The Citadella is served by local bus 27 from either Sánc utca (''reached by bus 8, 112, 239 from Corvin Negyed (former Ferenciek tere) or Astoria Metro stations'') or Móricz Zsigmond körtér (''reached by tram 6 from Corvin Negyed (former Ferenciek tere) Metro station or tram 47, 49 from Kálvin tér Metro station''). The bus stop is called Búsuló Juhász (Citadella), but the Citadella is 600 m away on foot along Szirtes utca.</see>
* <see name="Fisherman's Bastion and lookout terrace" alt="Halászbástya" address="Budapest, Szentháromság tér, 1014" directions="" lat="" long="" phone="" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">For impressive views across the Danube to Pest. This neo-Gothic construction was built in 1905 by the architect Frigyes Schulek. It is composed of seven towers that symbolize the seven Magyar clans’ leaders that came to the Carpathian Basin at the end of the IX century. It was built between 1890-1905 and is named after both the medieval fish market once nearby and the Guild of Fishermen who defended this section of the wall during past wars.  The story is that different trades were responsible for defending different parts of the castle walls and that this section of the defenses was raised by the fishermen’s guild. In fact, the structure is a late 19th-century fantasy built to add class to the area. That this is an invention does not detract at all from the attractiveness of the structure, nor from the impressive views of the river and Pest on the opposite side. The mounted statue between the bastion and the church is King Stephen (Istvan in Hungarian) the first king of Hungary (crowned about 1000.) He was declared a saint for his efforts in bringing Christianity to Hungary. He carries the apostolic cross with two crossbars – a symbol granted to him by the Pope. In tourist season there is an admission charge of about $1 to climb on the bastion. In the daytime around the year, the bastion is the place most overcrowded by tourists in Castle Hill, mainly brought in here by buses. The '''sculpture of a Turul bird''' just outside the cable car station is not, as you might think, an eagle, but the mythical turul bird (which is believed to be a kind of falcon). This bird is a part of the story of how the Magyars settled the Hungarian homeland. This bird appeared in a dream to the wife of the Magyar leader Ügyek and told her that she would be the founding mother of a new nation.</see>

The hospital was built during WW II and was functioning as a hospital between 1944-1945, and later, during the Hungarian Revolution in 1956. In the 1950s the institution was nationalized, received a secret code, and was classified as TOP SECRET until 2002 due to the extension works that converted the place into a nuclear bunker. Since 2008 the museum has been open to the public, you can join historic walks scheduled every hour to take you back to the past and experience the living history of the 20th century.</see> 
[[Image:Budapest_parliament_42447015_9d06c74869_o.jpg|thumb|right|The Parliament Building]]
* <see name="Hungarian Parliament" alt="Országház" address="Kossuth Lajos tér 1-3, 1055" directions="" phone="" email="" fax="" url="http://latogatokozpont.parlament.hu/en" hours="" price="">The Hungarian National Parliament building is the largest in Europe, designed by architect Imre Steindl for the 1896 millennial celebrations, and built 1880-1902. It is based on England's Parliament building and supposedly is one meter wider and longer than that August building, just a little bit of architectural conceit. The building is so immense, that the weak alluvial soil along the Danube had to be reinforced with a 7-foot-deep concrete foundation. Not surprising, as the building is 300 yards long and 140 yards wide, with 691 rooms and 12.5 miles of corridors. The lacy white Gothic froth covering the building is actually educational: 88 statues representing Hungarian rulers, princes, and military commanders. These statues are small and cannot be readily distinguished from the ground, but they are there. Under the Parliament's cupola the '''Hungarian crown jewels''' are exhibited. After World War II, the medieval crown (last used in 1916) was taken out of the country by escaping Hungarian fascists, ending up in the United States. President Carter returned the crown to the Hungarian state in 1978, accompanied by a large American delegation. It was exhibited in the National Museum until 2000 when it was moved to its present location. The only way inside the building is with an organized tour. The tour lasts about 30 minutes. Tours only run at specific times during the day, and you have to get your ticket in advance for a timed slot. The House of Parliament's Visitor Center is directly north of the Parliament building itself and is an underground office reached by stairs. Come back at the specified time on your ticket, and a guide will appear (not in a uniform). Then you can go through security screening before starting. There is a bar/cafe just inside the main doors which is open to the public during the tour times. Tickets can be purchased in advance online. You can also wait in line and purchase tickets for the guided tour inside the Visitor Center. Multiple guided tours in English, Spanish, German, Italian, Hungarian, Russian, Hebrew, and French are held throughout the day. Visits to the House of Parliament are restricted during weeks in which the National Assembly holds its plenary sittings.</see> 
* <see name="Royal Palace" alt="Királyi palota" address="Szent György tér 2, 1014" directions="" lat="" long="" phone="+36 14583000" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="http://www.budavar.hu/budai-var" hours="" price="">The most popular attraction on the hill. Entrance to the area is free, while some museums and attractions have paid admission. Can be reached on foot (sloped paths and/or a long series of steps), by tourist funicular, or by public transit bus. On foot, walk to the base of the castle on the Buda side and look for the white stairs next to the palace garden park. In the park, there is also a small elevator and then a small escalator that will get you partway up. By funicular, cross the chain bridge and then proceed to the base of the station. Tickets cost 1100 HUF for adults for a short ride, and the view is not particularly impressive, so this is a better option for those with limited mobility than those looking for a fun experience. By public transit bus, take bus number 16. The first known buildings here where the Royal Palace stands today, were built by Charles Robert’s eldest son, Stephan Duke of Anjou (1308-1342). It was later remodeled, but the reign of King Matthias brought about the golden age of Buda (1458-1490). Legend has it that when a Turkish ambassador came to Buda, he saw all the wealth and grandeur, forgot his greeting speech and all he could say was „The emperor sends his respects”. After several remodelings, the unique building we see today is the recreation of Alajos Hauszmann and Miklós Ybl’s1896 millennial designs. During its history, the Royal Palace was destroyed and rebuilt at least 6 times. The first palace, in Gothic style, built and added over 300 years ago, was destroyed by the Christian army that liberated Buda from the Turkish occupation in 1686. In 1715 work started on a completely new, smaller Baroque palace, but over the years more and more space was added to the palace until it reached its current length (304 meters). The palace, in neo-Baroque style, had many added wings (which now house the '''National Gallery''', among other treasures--see below). Reconstruction after the various indignities suffered during rebellions of the 19th century finished in 1904. This reconstruction, by Miklós Ybl and Alajos Hauszmann, was undone by German troops holding out at the end of WWII. The roof fell in entirely and most of the furniture was destroyed. A Baroque façade which had never existed before and a real dome (there had previously been a faux dome with attic space beneath) were added to the building. Today the building houses three large museums (see below) and the '''National Széchényi Library'''. The statue of '''Hussar General András Hadik''', a favorite of Empress Maria Theresia is well known to local students. The statue, designed by György Vastagh Jr. was presented to the public in 1937. The general is on horseback; take a close look at the horse's testicles. They are shiny yellow, unlike the patina on the rest of the statue. Engineering students have for years polished the horse testicles on the morning of difficult exams, supposedly for luck. '''Mary Magdalene Tower''' (Mária Magdolna torony), on the corner of Országház Street and Kapisztrán tér is part of a 13th-century Franciscan church used by Hungarian speakers. Under Turkish rule, this was the only church allowed to remain Christian: all others were converted into mosques. The chancel was destroyed in World War II and has not been rebuilt except for one stone window, as a memento. It hosted rulings but also invaders such as the Turks. Today the Palace is converted into some museums. It hosts the National Gallery. Sections of the Royal Palace include:</see>
:* <see name="Hunyadi Garden" alt="" address="" directions="" lat="" long="" phone="" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">The Hunyadi Garden was a marketplace during the reign of Sigismund of Luxemburg. The group of bronze statues known as the Mátyás Fountain is the work of Alajos Stróbl from 1904. The work features Matthias Corvinus in the company of his henchman, his hunter, his Italian chronicler, and his hunting dogs. On the left side is Szép Ilonka, a young woman from a humble background, who knowing nothing about Matthias’s status falls in love with the king during a hunt. The busy fountain is a popular rest stop for tourists. This is Budapest’s answer to the Trevi Fountain in Rome: visitors wishing to return to the city toss shiny coins into the fountain, of which thousands shimmer under the water.</see>
:* <see name="Lions’ Courtyard" alt="" address="" directions="" lat="" long="" phone="" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">The courtyard got its name from the four stone lions that guard its gate. The two formidable lions at the gate try to deter one from entering, while the two on the inside roar furiously at those who dare walk past the gates. They were created by sculptor János Fadrusz in 1902. As we walk past the gate lighter stripes in the grey cube veneer show the excavated, reburied remains of the medieval palace walls. The 4300 m² courtyard is bordered by the building complex containing the Hungarian National Museum, the Budapest Museum of History and the National Széchenyi Library.</see> 
:* <see name="Savoyai Terrace" alt="" address="" directions="" lat="" long="" phone="" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">One of the most representative areas of the Buda Castle, the Savoyai Terrace boasts the best view of the city. Standing on this spacious square we can see the graceful Danube dividing the two sides of the city, the limestone walls of the Parliament, the Gellért Hill, the capital’s bridges, the Monument of Liberty, and on a clear day you can see the sites of Pest. The Terrace is in front of the Hungarian National Museum and on it you will find the neo-baroque bronze statue of Austrian Prince Eugene of Savoy military strategist made by the sculptor József Róna which has been there since the beginning of the 1900s. Eugene of Savoy is an important figure in Hungarian History because he was the general who irrevocably freed Hungary from the Turkish occupation.</see>

The structure has three distinct wings, one Gothic, one Romanesque, and one Baroque, making it quite a bizarre sight when seen from a distance. But sneak up closer and its magic will be revealed: thanks to the moat, the trees, and the carefully laid footpaths, you can usually only see one section at a time. The attention to detail (all copied from real sites around the country) has been painstaking, so it's like seeing three extraordinarily pretty castles rolled into one.  The structure was originally supposed to be only a temporary one, but Budapest's people liked it so much that it was rebuilt to last. Located on an island in the middle of the park's lake.</see>

Onion domes are typically found in Catholic churches, and Hungary is a very Catholic country. Perhaps Ludwig Förster, the architect, meant for it to blend in a bit. Those interested in Jewish history or culture may be interested in a guided or self-guided tour of the old Jewish Quarter of Budapest is the neighborhood bordered by Károly Boulevard, Erzsébet Boulevard, Király Street, and Rákóczi Road. Main sites include Wallenberg Park, The Tree of Life, The Temple of Heroes, the Rumbach Synagogue, the Carl Lutz Memorial, and the Kazinczy Street Synagogue.</see> 
* <see name="Matthias Church" alt="Mátyás templom" address="Budapest, Szentháromság tér 2, 1014" directions="" lat="" long="" phone="" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">Dominant neogothic church crowning Budapest's cityscape - nowadays is under reconstruction. The church praises a wonderful and unusual roof made of colored shingles and elegant pinnacles. The interior is worth a visit because of the frescoes and the artistic glass walls. The rococo spire of this church is one of the easily seen landmarks of the castle district. Originally the Buda German community's parish church, its official name is the "Church of the Blessed Virgin". The popular Hungarian king, Mátyás, held both of his weddings here, and so it is known as the Matthias Church. Today an eclectic mix of styles, the church was started in the thirteenth century. The main apse, which ends in a seven-sided polygon, is in French style and is the earliest extant section. The central section was built about 100 years later. During the Turkish occupation of Budapest, all the furnishings were removed and the painted walls whitewashed to cover art unacceptable to the Islamic eye. Once returned to the Catholic community, it was Baroquified (i.e. covered with Baroque ornamentation that obscured the original style like many other Central European churches were), and the rose window was bricked up. In the last century, between 1873 and 1896, Frigyes Schulek began a major renovation and restoration of the Matthias Church. The interior is sumptuously decorated in a style which is on the one hand Art Deco and yet evokes the medieval predecessors of this structure. As you enter the church turn to the right and proceed down the right-hand aisle to the front of the church. For a small fee, you can visit the underground treasury which includes a replica of the Crown of St. Stephen - the real crown (a 12th-century object even though Stephen was a 10th-century king) is on display in the parliament building. Also, take a look at the opulent chapel at the rear of the church (around the corner to the left of the entrance. Be aware that this is a functioning church and you may find that at times it is closed to visitors for church activities or concerts. To the left of the neighboring Hilton Hotel is what looks like the wall of a medieval church with a monument set into it. In fact, it is a copy of a monument located in Belsen, Germany (near Dresden). The copy was erected by the Ilton Company. It portrays King Mátyás (15th century), the most beloved of Hungarian Kings. In front of the Matthias Church is a tall column decorated with many statues – this is a “plague monument” erected by thankful survivors.</see>

* <see name="Rock Church" alt="Sziklatemplom" address="" directions="at the southeastern edge of Gellért Hill" lat="" long="" phone="" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">The church was created from a natural cave system, following the Lourdes cave as a sample in 1926. To reach the church, go to Gellért tér, turn towards Gellért Hill, and look for the big white cross or the statue of King Saint Stephen - you can find the church below the cross and next to the statue.</see>
* <see name="St. Stephen (István) Cathedral" alt="the Basilica" address="Szent István tér" directions="" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="" email="" fax="">Though often called "the Basilica" for short due to its clerical rank as a basilica minor, it actually is shaped like a Greek cross, with two steeples and a dome on top. Designed by Miklós Ybl and József Hild, and built 1851-1905, it is as high as the Parliament building -- it's the highest church in Budapest. Walking in the main entrance, after climbing a series of stairs, the viewer is first greeted with a relief of St Stephen, then a mosaic of Christ's resurrection. There are many notable mosaics in this church, especially those within the dome designed by Károly Lotz, best known for his ceiling frescoes in the State Opera and Ethnographic Museum. While designed here, the mosaics were made in Venice. The foremost Hungarian artists of the day designed the artworks within St Stephen's, among them Bertalan Székely, Gyula Benczúr and two men also known for their work in the Opera, Mór Than and Alajos Stróbl. Here Stróbl contributed the central statue of St Stephen on the main altar. In the left-hand chapel is the "Chapel of the sacred right hand". This is pretty surreal as St Stephen's surviving hand in a glass box, lovely.  For a fee, you can also climb to the very top of the Basilica to get a wonderful view of the city.</see>

===Thermal baths===

====Context====
Budapest is famous for its thermal baths[https://www.budapest-baths.com], where tourists and locals go to swim, relax, and soak in the hot or cold mineral waters. Thermal baths differ from normal baths or swimming pools because their hot water is drawn up from deep under the earth's surface where temperatures are higher. Thermal hot water saves on heating bills and also has different mineral contents compared to normal tap water. Soaking in certain types of mineral water is considered to have health benefits for some types of health problems, so it's not uncommon for Hungarians or visitors to come to the baths for therapeutic reasons, sometimes even prescribed by a doctor. Thermal bathing is more popular in Hungary than in other destinations for several reasons. First, because of Budapest's geography, thermal waters run closer to the surface here than in other places. Secondly, thermal bathing was (and is) popular among many Turkish cultures, and Hungary was occupied by the Turkish people of the Ottoman Empire for many years. In Budapest, some thermal baths are large, historic complexes visited as a cultural subject as well as a bathing experience. Other thermal baths are operated more as spa hotels, with thermal water but in a modern, spa-like atmosphere.

====Etiquette and customs====
At most baths, especially those frequented by tourists, people wear typical swimming attire and all public access is mixed-gender. (Certain days, hours, or sections at some baths may designated women-only or men-only, and often during these times, people bathe nude or nearly nude.) All baths have changing areas and showers designated women-only or men-only. Transgender/non-binary gender identities are not widely recognized in Hungary, so the closest option to gender-neutral changing is to rent a private cabin within either the women's or men's section.

====What to bring====
A swimsuit (unless otherwise stated) and admission money are essential. A towel should be brought or rented onsite. Shower shoes or sandals are recommended as the floors are not modern and not especially clean. Some may wish to bring swimming goggles, a water bottle, a bathrobe (in the winter), or a bathing cap. For some facilities or certain sections, a bathing cap might be mandatory. For those who plan to swim or lounge outdoors, small beach items like sunglasses, sunscreen, reading material, etc, maybe a good idea. Hair dryers are generally available on-site. Bathers may wish to bring showering items (e.g. shampoo) and a change of clothes. Most facilities use a wristband electronic locking system for lockers and cabins, so bringing a padlock is not required. It's possible for a busy venue may run out of locks. As much as possible, valuables should be left at home, and safety boxes may be available depending.

====Tickets and prices====
Access to the baths is often available with many different types of tickets. Expect to pay something in the realm of 4000-5000 HUF for the major tourist baths. A general ticket usually includes all-day access to the main areas of the baths and a small private locker for storage of clothes and personal effects. Discounted tickets are usually available for young people, students, and seniors. Cheaper tickets are sometimes available for shorter bathing periods (e.g. 2 hours or 4 hours vs. all day), weekdays (vs. weekends), or off-peak hours (e.g. early morning, late afternoon, evening). Advance booking is generally not required, as prices are the same and it's typical for there to be no lineup or a short one (e.g. 10-20 minutes' wait). If you have little time and want to be compact in your time try to choose a ticket this way[https://www.budapest-baths.com/best-thermal-baths-in-budapest/].

====Spa services, rentals, upgrades, and amenties====
Some baths offer additional services such as specialized water massages, typical spa massages (e.g. relaxation or Swedish massage), manicures/pedicures, etc. Prices vary.
Most baths offer rentals or purchases of various items like towels, robes, swim caps, swimsuits, etc.
Most spas offer or require the rental of a private cabin rather than a locker. A private cabin is a small booth where bathers can change clothes, and then lock and leave their valuables and personal effects. A private cabin can generally be shared by several people using the same locker area (i.e. women-only/men-only).
Depending on the size of the bath, most facilities offer small cafes for sandwiches, drinks, and snacks. Water fountains and washrooms are also available.

====Children====
Children (e.g. under 14) are either not recommended or not allowed at the thermal baths. Verify in advance.

====Traditional public baths====

==Work==
[[Teaching English]] is a popular profession for travelers and people moving to Budapest.

Generally speaking, finding a full-time job is fairly difficult unless you speak Hungarian. You should also be prepared that Western standards at job interviews regarding personal life and diversity issues do not always apply. Do not be surprised if you are asked about your smoking habits. Also, companies are not always prepared to fully understand and accept people from diverse backgrounds. You should be prepared that most places won't hire you until you speak at least a little Hungarian. Restaurants with a specific country's cuisine (such as Italian restaurants and pizzerias) tend to hire people from that country to make the food more authentic.

===Currency===
Hungary's national currency is the Hungarian Forint, or HUF. Coins are available in 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 denominations, and banknotes in 500, 1,000, 2,000, 5,000, 10,000, and 20,000 denominations. Depending on market values, €1 exchanges for approximately 300 forint. At the airport, however, the rate is only 245 forint. So, one should change as little as possible there. Typical vendors accept only local currency, although euros may be accepted at major attractions or very touristy places. Only paper notes are accepted, usually no higher than €50 or maybe €100, and change is always given in front. (Sometimes the exchange rate is fair and sometimes quite bad.) Forint can be obtained by exchanging money at a vendor, exchanging money at a bank, or withdrawing money from a local bank machine. Bank machines generally give 20,000 HUF notes but will also give smaller bills if withdrawing irregular sums of money (e.g. 39,000 HUF vs. 40,000). Currency exchange businesses range from simple, cost-efficient services that charge a small fee to highly inflated tourist rip-offs to outright theft or scamming. Fortunately, credit cards are widely accepted, even for a few euros worth of a meal at a fast food restaurant. At the airport duty-free shops, cards are charged in euros only at a rate of about 304 forints per euro.

===Tourist shopping and souvenirs===
''Váci utca'' is the main area for tourists, and features the normal array of overpriced cafes, souvenir shops, and popular fashion brands. Beyond normal tourist souvenirs, popular Hungarian-specific items are linens, lace, blouses, and other imitation folk items. Paprika peppers and spices, honey, and Hungarian liquor are popular food items. The '''Great Market Hall''' (''Nagy Vásárcsarnok'') at ''Fővám tér'' is an atmospheric historic market hall selling mainly tourist souvenirs.

===General Fashion===
Popular global chain stores like H&M, Abercrombie & Fitch, Intimissi, etc, can be found along Váci Street, in major tourist squares, and in major shopping malls like West. Prices are comparable to Western Europe even though many other items in Hungary are cheaper.

===High End Fashion===
[[File:Shop at Andrassy Utca.jpg|thumb|300px|Shop on a restored building at Andrassy Utca]]
Andrassy Utca is Budapest's main street for high-end brand-name fashion shops like Gucci, Prada, and Coach.

===Used Clothing===
Second-hand clothing shopping is typical for many Hungarians in the working and middle classes since wages are substantially lower than in Western Europe but brand-name shopping mall clothing is the same price. Secondhand shops can be found throughout the city, often advertising themselves as selling "Angol" (English) wares or displaying a British flag. These shops purchase bulk used clothing in Western Europe and sell it in Hungary since used clothes from other places are thought to be more lightly used or more fashionable styles than local ones.

===Local artists and designers===
Budapest has many small shops selling locally designed and locally made clothing, jewelry, and household items. It takes time to find your favorite gems, but try wandering near Astoria. Prices are generally consistent with Western Europe.

==Eat==
{{seeDistricts}}. See '''[[Budapest/Buda#Eat|Buda]]''' and '''[[Budapest/Pest#Eat|Pest]]'''
<!-- NO INDIVIDUAL LISTINGS HERE. List in district articles for 'Buda' and 'Pest'.-->
Local specialties often revolve around meat (pork, beef, veal, or poultry), and often involve liberal use of paprika, however not necessary of the hot kind. Note that - due to a historical translation error - "goulash soup" is indeed a soup, not the "goulash" that visitors may be familiar with from the home which is known as "pörkölt". 

Major specialties include:
* '''Balaton pike-perch''' (fogas) 
* '''Gyümölcsleves''' - fruit soup - cold, creamy, and sweet, consumed as a starter. 
* '''Gulyás (leves)''' is usually translated as 'goulash soup' - a filling meat soup (usually beef) with potatoes and paprika, among other ingredients. Served as a main dish or as a (heavy) starter. The name refers to the Hungarian version of a cowboy taking care of a 'gulya' (cattleherd).
* '''Halászlé''' - fishermen's soup served differently depending on the region
* '''Pörkölt''' a stew with of sautéed onions and - paprika. Similar to what is served as 'goulash' abroad. 
* '''Töltött káposzta''' - stuffed cabbage, the cooked cabbage leaves are filled with meat and in a paprika sauce, served with sour cream (similar to crème fraîche or crème acidulée)

From the desserts, you may not want to miss:
* '''Gundel palacsinta''' - Gundel pancake (crepe) - with a filling prepared with rum, raisin, walnuts, and lemon zest, served with a chocolate sauce, and the careful reader may guess its birthplace. 
* '''Kürtőskalács''', (chimney cake) is a delicious sweet dough pastry that is cooked on a chimney-shaped spit and coated in butter and sugar to form a crispy crust. After the cakes are cooked they can be rolled in a variety of toppings such as cinnamon sugar or chocolate.
* '''Somlói galuska''', a poem on biscuit dough, cream, and chocolate sauce, invented by Károly Gollerits at Gundel 
[[File:Dobos Torta.jpg|thumb|300px|Dobos Torta]]
*  There is also a great variety of wonderful pastries/cakes (Torta), some of which you will recognize if you are familiar with Viennese pastries. You may want to try '''Dobos torta''' (Dobos cake, named after József Dobos), and '''Rigó Jancsi''' a light chocolate-cream cake.  

'''Of special note:''' Hungarian law does not require restaurants to forward either the (included) service charge or the added tip to the wait staff. Dubious restaurants, especially those favored by tourists, will simply pocket the extra Forint into their private coffers. While it is customary to tip 10% of the bill, it is important to ask your waiter if the service charge is included in the bill and if the staff receives either the service charge or any additional tip. Obviously, it is better to frequent restaurants that treat their staff well, but you may not know in which kind of establishment you are dining until you receive the bill and inquire.

===Grocery shopping===
Needless to say, if you want to take home some Hungarian paprika, Pick szalámi, or Tokaji wine, grocery shops are naturally cheaper than specialized souvenir kiosks. In the central areas, you will find smaller Spar, Aldi, Lidl, Tesco Express, and Hungarian chains like GRoby and CBA.

Further from the center, you can find foreign-owned hypermarkets like Auchan and Tesco with a large range of goods.

== Drink ==
{{seeDistricts}} See '''[[Budapest/Buda#Drink|Buda]]''' and '''[[Budapest/Pest#Drink|Pest]]'''

<!-- NO INDIVIDUAL LISTINGS HERE. List in district articles for 'Buda' and 'Pest'.-->

Budapest offers plenty of places to drink, from cool and ultra-hip to dirty and down-market. If you are in the mood for a particularly Hungarian experience, visit a so-called borozó (wine pub). These pubs are usually in cellars and offer inexpensive Hungarian wine on tap at very low prices if you manage to find one outside the tourist areas.
 
Hungary's most renowned wines are the dessert wines originating from the Tokaj region in NE Hungary. Lesser-known but still high-quality wines are produced in the Villány, Szekszárd, and Eger regions. Among red wines, the best are Kékfrankos, Egri Bikavér „Bulls Blood”, and Cabernet Franc, while white wines such as Szürkebarát, Cserszegi fűszeres, and Irsai Olivér can be very pleasant and refreshing.

You should at least try the Hungarian spirit, '''pálinka''', a clear brandy made from fruit. The most popular is made from honey, plum, apricot, sour cherry or Williams pear.

Unique Hungarian soft drinks to try are ''Traubi Szoda'', a white grape soda, and ''Márka'', a sour cherry soda.

==Contact==

===Dialing===
Calling outside Budapest press the city code (Budapest is 36-1) or mobile (06 -30/  70 /20 )
Calling international press 00 + country code + area code + local number (Hungary's country code is 36).

===Mobile phones and internet===
Mobile phones from other countries will generally work in Hungary, but roaming fees can be high if you're not visiting from an EU country. Check with your phone provider for more information.

WiFi is widely available. Many restaurants and shops offer free wifi to their patrons, and wifi is sometimes available in public squares or parks. 

Hostels and hotels generally have free wifi, or they may charge a fee.

Temporary mobile phone or data services can be purchased from major Hungarian carriers like Vodafone or T-Mobile. You will need to first buy a sim card (something like 1000-3000 HUF) and then choose a pre-paid top-up style plan. For example, a typical plan might require you to pay a 2000 HUF top-up, and with this top-up, you will receive 500 MB or 1 GB of data for the next 30 days. Calling and texting might cost a per-use rate (e.g. 50 HUF/minute or 30 HUF/message) and this will be deducted from your original top-up balance.

==Stay healthy==
Hungary has typical summer temperatures upwards of 30-35 °C, so plan your clothing and hydration accordingly.

Tap water throughout Budapest is safe to drink, so carry a bottle you can refill. Public fountains are often available throughout the city. Some look like regular drinking fountains. Others are decorative fountains (e.g. statue of a lion with water coming from its mouth) but are also safe to drink from. It can be hard to tell which fountains are for drinking, but it's likely okay if there's either a steady stream of flowing water (versus water bubbling up from a spout), a button that makes the water flow, and/or if you can walk right up to the stream of water (versus if there's a guard rail or fence). If in doubt, ask someone.

Routine medical care, emergency medical care, and dental care in Hungary vary widely in terms of quality. Budapest is a popular destination for medical tourism, where uninsured foreigners come to get a root canal from a well-trained dentist for lower prices than in their home country. Clinics that cater to tourists, expats, and wealthy Hungarians generally offer similar standards of care to other Western European countries. For planned procedures, visitors should conduct some basic research in advance (e.g. professional-looking website, client reviews, knowledgeable telephone staff). For emergencies, visitors should seek appropriate medical attention and would also be well advised to enlist the help of a Hungarian-speaking friend or even hostel/hotel staff. Where possible, insured travelers should also consult their insurer for local contacts or recommended facilities. Foreigners may be treated differently than locals (maybe better, maybe worse) and it is commonplace for doctors to discretely collect extra fees from those who expect proper care.

==Stay safe==
Budapest is generally very safe for tourists. The main concerns for visitors are pickpocketing/minor theft and scams/rip-offs. Violent crime is low and unlikely to affect tourists. Most areas of interest to tourists are safe for wandering about day or night. Take normal precautions when walking alone or in isolated places. Some areas outside the center might be riskier for walking alone or at night. Ask a local or your hostel/hotel staff if planning an unusual route and you're concerned.

Visitors should be aware of their belongings, especially in busy areas frequented by tourists (e.g. Váci utca, monuments and attractions, public transportation, queues, and crowds). Basic precautions should prevent most problems. Keep money and valuables somewhere you can see and feel them (e.g. in a small shoulder bag you can keep your hand on in crowded areas, rather than in a back pocket or in a backpack). When possible, avoid carrying your passport or excess cash. Avoid people who are giving you unwanted attention. 

Tourist scams range in seriousness from overpricing normal goods to outright theft and blackmail.

Be careful of people trying to change your money, they can try to give you fake or useless (e.g. Yugoslavian) money.

'''A recent scam is selling fake drugs around tourist places during the night. The sellers are harmless if you say that you are not interested, so the best tactic is to walk away from the "dealer". These "drugs" most of the time are baking soda or some green spices.'''

===Restaurants and bars===
In general, large restaurants and cafes in heavily touristed areas offer mediocre food for high prices. Usually heading a little bit off the main street and choosing somewhere where locals seem to be eating will allow you to find something that is of better quality and value. For example, on Váci Street a 5-liter beer might cost around 1000 HUF while elsewhere it would cost 300. Restaurants are required to post their menu outside, so have a quick look at the prices before you sit down. There have been a few instances of restaurants charging foreign tourists exorbitant sums of money and escorting them to an ATM to withdraw money when they couldn't pay.

===Taxis===
"Taxi hyenas" are known to rip off foreign tourists. Always use regulated taxis with proper signs and license numbers. When possible, use a phone to call a cab or go to a taxi stand rather than hailing one off the street. When possible, ask a local what an approximate fare to your destination might cost. In the taxi, either make sure that the meter is running or agree on a fixed price before departure.

Főtaxi is the official airport taxi partner and they have a stand outside the terminal building. Taxis from other companies can pick up passengers who call them directly.

===Sex workers===
Sex work is illegal in Hungary. Sex workers may be discretely offering their services in areas frequented by tourists (e.g. Váci Street). Some may be involved in scams, theft, or blackmail (e.g. forcing you to pay a large bar tab).
