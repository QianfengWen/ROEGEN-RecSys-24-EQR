{{pagebanner|Tulsa Banner.jpg}}

'''Tulsa''' [http://VisitTulsa.com] is in the [[Green Country (Oklahoma)|Green Country]] region of [[Oklahoma]]. It is also called '''“T-town”''' by the locals  and has been called the '''"Oil Capital of the World"'''. The city had about 391,000 people and the metro area had about 937,000 people as of 2010 from the US Census Bureau. The Tulsa Bartlesville Combined area had 988,000 in the 2010 census.

==Understand==
Tulsa lies in northeastern Oklahoma, within the state's "Green Country", and at the convergence of the Great Plains and the Ozark Plateau. The wide and shallow Arkansas River runs through the metro, and numerous lakes, reservoirs, smaller rivers, and wooded hills enliven the landscape. 

Weather is very unpredictable, with winters often in the teens, but down to -15f and a high number of freeze thaw cycles, making road repair a constant effort. There is not much snow, just a few inches each year, typically, but ice storms are more of a concern. The months April through June are often wet, and, Tulsa being in Tornado Alley, twisters will pop up quickly throughout the year, bur are concentrated in late spring. Summers are hot 2023 had a stretch of 100f plus temps for weeks. It will often be above 90 degrees from May through September. Fall is the best time of year: mild temperatures, a nice breeze (all of Oklahoma is breezy), and changing tree colors. Tulsa has over 225 days of sunshine annually. In all, the city receives an average of 40 inches of precipitation each year, which helps keep Tulsa and Green Country green. 

There are more nearly a million people in the metro area. Tulsa is often paired with its neighbor Broken Arrow, itself the fourth largest city in the state, though Tulsa is clearly the big brother. Here you will find a combination of western, Midwestern, and southern charm, along with a cosmopolitan atmosphere. The people love their city and are welcoming and eager to help you find your way. You may notice that Tulsa has one of the largest concentrations of Art Deco design in the country, and other mid-century architecture, a result of having been a boom-town from the 1920s through 1950s. Oil was what made Tulsa. Wealthy barons such as Frank Phillips built stately mansions for themselves but also beautified the city along the way. As a result the city has a skyline that, until recently, bested Oklahoma City's. Tulsa likes to think of itself as the cultural capital of the state, boasting notable museums, universities, restaurants, festivals, quirky neighborhoods, and especially music - particularly country and blues musicians. Stars from Roy Clark to Leon Russell to Garth Brooks all made their start here.

==Get in==

===By plane===
*'''Tulsa International Airport''' ({{IATA|TUL}}) [http://tulsaairports.com/] in the northern part of Tulsa. It has major airlines with direct flights to major cities in the U.S. It is a small but nice airport with sofas and chairs all around and a very laid-back feel. The car rental area and parking is well integrated.
*'''Richard L. Jones, Jr. Airport''' ({{IATA|RVS}}) [http://tulsaairports.com/index.cfm?id=11] (often called the "Riverside Airport") is south of downtown and is a general aviation airport.

The #203 bus travels from the airport to Downtown. http://tulsatransit.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Traveler-12-2016-Final.pdf (Page 59)

===By train===
There is no passenger train service to Tulsa.

===By car===
Most Tulsans drive almost everywhere, although bus, bike, and pedestrian routes are starting to catch on. 

From the North/Kansas - US-75 South from [[Bartlesville]], OK, or US-169 South from Coffeyville, KS. 

From the Northeast/Missouri - I-44 West, aka the "Will Rogers Turnpike."  The world's former largest McDonalds spans the roadway near Vinita, OK. 

From the East/Arkansas - US-412 West, aka the "Cherokee Turnpike."

From the Southeast/Arkansas - The "Muskogee Turnpike."  

From the South - US-75 from [[Okmulgee]], OK, aka the "Okmulgee Beeline."

From the Southwest/[[Oklahoma City]] - I-44 East, aka the "Turner Turnpike."

From the West - US-412 East, aka the "Cimarron Turnpike."

For the slow scenic route from Northeast or Southwest come in on old [[Route 66]].

===By bus===
* '''Greyhound Bus Lines''' [http://www.greyhound.com/home/] ''+1 918'' 584-4428, 317 S Detroit Ave. (downtown).

==Get around==
Thanks to urban planning, the major city streets are placed in a grid layout. Almost all major intersections are one mile from each other, and exactly in a straight line. That makes it much easier to find places than in cities where streets go every which way. The major exception is downtown, which is slanted at almost a 45 degree angle to the rest of the grid.

=== By car ===
Several freeways and bypasses can be used to easily get around the Tulsa Metro area: I-244, I-44, US 169 (Mingo Valley Expressway, aka "Pearl Harbor Memorial Expressway"), US 75, Hwy 51 (Broken Arrow Expressway, The "B.A."), Creek Turnpike.

The streets and avenues are planned on a 1 mile by 1 mile grid system, with the main arterials running on each mile.  In the core of the city, named avenues run north/south and are named after US cities, generally in repeating alphabetical order (for example, Winston-Yale-Allegheny-Braden).  In the mid-town area the names are taken from colleges and college towns. North/South is divided by Admiral Blvd.  Name streets East of Main are cities east of the Mississippi River, vice versa for name streets west of Main.  In the parts of the city farther from downtown, north-south streets are numbered.  It is important to recognize that the specific format of the north-south numbered street names is '''North/South 145th East/West Avenue'''.

Numbered streets run East/West with Main Street and the Arkansas River as the dividing line.  Watch out for Place, Street, Avenue designation, e.g. 47th Place, 47th Street, or Florence Place, Florence Avenue.  It is important to recognize that the specific format of the east-west numbered street names is '''West/East 71st Street North/South'''.  In some parts of the city, ''numbered streets intersect,'' so the distinction is important.  Although rare, one east-west numbered street may even intersect with a street of the same number running north-south.

Downtown streets were originally platted parallel to the Frisco railroad tracks.  When Tulsa expanded beyond the bounds of its original plat, the expanded areas were platted in alignment with the points of the compass. Thus the "twisted" area down-town represents the original extent of Tulsa ca 1907.

=== By bus ===
Tulsa Transit [http://tulsatransit.org/] provides bus service for the Tulsa Metro area.  Cities served are Tulsa, [[Sand Springs]], [[Sapulpa]], [[Jenks]], and [[Broken Arrow]]. The central station is at 319 S. Denver (downtown). They do not run that often, especially to the outer towns like [[Broken Arrow]]. Unlike major cities in the Northeast, the city bus is not a major form of transportation in the city. It is usually a means of travel for those who are without their own motor vehicle.

===Bicycles===
Tulsa has an extensive interconnected paved bike trail system.  Rivertrail follows the Arkansas River from downtown Tulsa south to the suburbs.  The Katy Trail runs west to Sand Springs.  The Osage Trail is a rails-to-trails route that begins at the OSU-Tulsa campus and travels north 15 miles to Skiatook.  The Creek Trail connects Rivertrail and continues east through Broken Arrow to the NSU-Broken Arrow campus.  Riders accustomed to flat terrain may find Tulsa's rolling land to be a bit more challenging, particularly during the heat of summer.  If you are looking for a good workout, the Creek Turnpike Trail follows the land's original contours.  Rivertrail is probably be best choice for the rider seeking an easy route.

Four bike loan depots, located along Rivertrail, allow riders to borrow a bike for free for up to twenty-four hours. 

Tulsa has an active bicycling community.

==Contact==

*Tulsa County has more Wi-Fi spots than anywhere else in Oklahoma (as well as most of the Great Plains), making it a major tech hub in the region. If you need a Wi-Fi link, check into any number of restaurants and cafes and you'll be sure to find one.

* Central Library is across the street from Denver Station, the central city bus station. There's usually a few free Internet terminals you can use there or at any of the 24 other public libraries. [http://tulsalibrary.org/]

==Stay safe==

* Take precautions as you would in any other larger American city. Tulsa is a heavily segregated city, and racial tensions are high. That said, it is generally safe to go anywhere in the city during the day. In rougher parts of the city, don't go out alone at night.

* Beware of the following areas in the evening:
** The area north of Pine Street and west of the airport has a reputation for gang activity and very high racial tension. That said, Gilcrease Hills, Reservoir Hill, and Brady Heights are usually safe.
** Between 51st and 71st along Peoria Avenue, especially near Inhofe Plaza, is a notorious hotspot for drug-related crime.
** The area immediately east of downtown and north of 15th Street, especially along 11th street near Hillcrest hospital, have reputations for some gang activity and prostitution. That said, the situation is improving due to gentrification efforts.
** Caution should be exercised in the west Tulsa neighbourhoods of Carbondale and Oakhurst, as these areas have a reputation for drug use.

* Like any other city, if you take public transportation, be mindful of your belongings. Keep everything with you at all times, and don't allow anything out of your sight.

* Being in the middle of the country, Tulsa is a crossroads for homeless people. They are usually harmless, but if they become persistent or threatening, usually threatening to call the police will be enough to make them leave you alone.

* The tornado sirens are tested at noon on Wednesday, but they are not tested if it is rainy, stormy, or very windy. You might want to check the [[tornado safety]] page if you are visiting Tulsa.  Tornado season is normally in the spring and early summer, but they can occur anytime during the year.

* Oklahoma Weather is very harsh on road conditions and road repairs are needed on an almost yearly basis here. Please be prepared to slow down or stop for road workers as fines double for accidents in work zones as specified by Oklahoma State Law. 

* Swimming in the Arkansas River is inadvisable due to the large amounts of pollution and the currents created by the dams near downtown.

* Tulsa is home to two of the most dangerous intersections in America: 71st and Memorial, and 51st and Memorial. Drive defensively. Be mindful that some ramps on state highway 51 (Broken Arrow Expressway) are sometimes very short (the highway was built before modern standards in a very densely populated area), and there is very little time to get up to speed and merge.

==Respect==

* Religion is a very personal topic in Tulsa. Christian churches abound, and is the home of Oral Roberts University. This accounts for some people calling it "The Buckle of The Bible Belt". In common with many areas in the southern US, this stems largely from centuries-old Christian traditions mixed with southern culture.

* Homosexuality has mixed tolerance in the city and can be considered a very divisive issue. Acceptance is often along generational lines. There are more than a few areas, however, where LGBT people find a home, such as downtown and other gentrified corridors. 

* Tulsans are often very conservative, and the state as a whole is a well-known Republican stronghold. Tulsa itself has a larger share of left-leaning people than other parts of Oklahoma, but be mindful when discussing politics.
