'''Kathmandu''' (काठमाडौँ) [https://kathmandu.gov.np/] is the largest city and capital of [[Nepal]] and the namesake of the [[Kathmandu Valley]]. Once thought to be the fabled and inaccessible Shangri-La, Kathmandu is now a hub for independent travellers as well as a growing vacation spot catering to all budgets. As a result of considerable urban growth in recent decades, it is now part of one continuous urban area together with [[Patan]] to the south and [[Bhaktapur]] to the east. You will enjoy clear, blue sky and white mountains from any famous sites, of which it has many: a whopping seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites within few miles!

According to a census conducted in 2011, Kathmandu metropolis alone has 2.5 million inhabitants, and the agglomerate has a population of more than 3 million inhabitants. The metropolitan city area is 50.67 square kilometres (19.56 sq mi) and has a population density of 3000per km² and 17000 per km square in city.

The city stands at an elevation of approximately 1,400 metres (4,600 ft) in the bowl-shaped Kathmandu Valley of central Nepal. It is surrounded by four major mountains: Shivapuri, Phulchoki, Nagarjun, and Chandragiri. Kathmandu Valley is part of three districts (Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur), has the highest population density in the country, and is home to about a twelfth of Nepal's population.

Historically, the Kathmandu Valley and adjoining areas were known as Nepal Mandala. Until the 15th century, Bhaktapur was its capital when two other capitals, Kathmandu and Lalitpur, were established. During the Rana and Shah eras, British historians called the valley itself "Nepal Proper". Today, Kathmandu is not only the capital of the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, but also the headquarters of the Central Development Region of Nepal. The Central Region comprises three zones: Bagmati, Narayani, and Janakpur. Kathmandu is located in the Bagmati Zone.

Kathmandu is the gateway to tourism in Nepal. It is also the nerve center of the country's economy. It has the most advanced infrastructure of any urban area in Nepal, and its economy is focused on tourism, which accounted for 3.8% of Nepal's GDP in 1995–96. Tourism in Kathmandu declined thereafter during a period of political unrest, but since then has improved. In 2013, Kathmandu was ranked third among the top 10 travel destinations on the rise in the world by TripAdvisor,and ranked first in Asia.

The city has a rich history, spanning nearly 2000 years, as inferred from inscriptions found in the valley. Religious and cultural festivities form a major part of the lives of people residing in Kathmandu. Most of Kathmandu's people follow Hinduism and many others follow Buddhism. There are people of other religious beliefs as well, giving Kathmandu a cosmopolitan culture. Nepali is the most commonly spoken language in the city. English is understood by Kathmandu's educated residents.

Kathmandu's sister cities (Lalitpur Patan) and Bhaktapur are integral to Kathmandu's cultural heritage, tourism industry, and economy; therefore UNESCO's World Heritage Site lists all three cities' monuments and attractions together under one heading, "Kathmandu Valley-UNESCO World Heritage Site".

Kathmandu Valley is in the Warm Temperate Zone of Nepal (elevation ranging from 1,200–2,300 metres (3,900–7,500 ft)), where the climate is fairly temperate, atypical for the region. This zone is followed by the Cool Temperate Zone with elevation varying between 2,100–3,300 metres (6,900–10,800 ft). Portions of the city with lower elevations have a humid subtropical climate, while portions of the city with higher elevations generally have a subtropical highland climate. In the Kathmandu Valley the average summer temperature varies from 28–30 °C (82–86 °F). The average winter temperature is 10.1 °C (50.2 °F).

The city generally has a climate with warm days followed by cool nights and mornings. Unpredictable weather is expected given temperatures can drop to 3 °C (37 °F) during the winter. During a 2013 cold front, the winter temperatures of Kathmandu dropped to −4 °C (25 °F), and the coldest temperature was recorded in January 10, 2013 at −9.2 °C (15.4 °F). Rainfall is mostly monsoon-based (about 65% of the total concentrated during the monsoon months of June to August), and decreases substantially (100 to 200 cm (39 to 79 in)) from eastern Nepal to western Nepal. Rainfall has been recorded at about 1,400 millimetres (55.1 in) for the Kathmandu valley, and averages 1,407 millimetres (55.4 in) for the city of Kathmandu. On average humidity is 75%.

===By plane===
Kathmandu's [http://www.tiairport.com.np/ '''Tribhuvan International Airport'''] ({{IATA|KTM}}), is the largest and only international airport in Nepal, located 5.5km east of the popular tourist neighborhood of Thamel. 

====International Flights====
Whilst Kathamandu lacks direct flights to most of Europe, Africa, North and South America and Australasia, the airport is well connected and it is usually possible to reach Kathmandu with only one change of flight, in most cases using the same airline.
 
International airlines serving Kathmandu include: 
*Nepal Airlines - [[Bangkok]], [[Bangalore]], [[Delhi]], [[Doha]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Mumbai]].
*Biman Bangladesh - [[Dhaka]]
*Air India - [[Delhi]], [[Kolkata]], [[Varanasi]]
*IndiGo - [[Delhi]]
*Bhutan Airlines - [[Paro]], [[Delhi]].
*Druk Air - [[Paro]], [[Delhi]].
*Air Arabia - [[Sharjah]].
*Fly Dubai' - [[Dubai]].
*Etihad Airways - [[Abu Dhabi]].
*Qatar Airways''' - [[Doha]].
*Oman Air - [[Muscat]].
*Turkish Airlines - [[Istanbul]].

*China Southern Airlines - [[Guangzhou]].
*China Eastern Airlines -; [[Kunming]], [[Shanghai]].
*Sichuan Airlines - [[Chengdu]], [[Lhasa]].

====Domestic Flights====
Commercial domestic flights are available to/from [[Bhadrapur]], [[Bhairawa]], [[Bharatpur (Nepal)l]], [[Biratnagar]], [[Dhangarhi]], [[Janakpur]], [[Nepalganj]], [[Pokhara]], [[Simara]], and [[Tumling Tar]]. Domestic flights take about an hour and cost USD100-175. The primary domestic airlines are [http://www.air-viva.com air viva], [http://www.yetiairlines.com/ Yeti], [http://www.royalnepal-airlines.com/ Nepal Airlines], and  [http://www.buddhaair.com/ Buddha Air].  Domestic flights are almost always delayed and afternoon flights run the risk of cancellation as delays from the morning compound. Domestic flight schedule are available at [http://www.nepalairflight.com NepalAirflight]

Prices for domestic flights are two tier. Nepalese citizens pay significantly less than foreign visitors. A flight from Kathmandu to Nepalgunj, for example, is the equivalent of USD 40 for Nepalis but USD 150 for foreign nationals. While flights can be booked online it is often cheaper to book them in Nepal through an agent.

====Baggage Handlers & Concerns====
Your luggage is vulnerable entering and leaving this airport. Do not keep anything of value in checked bags, and if you lock the bag, the zipper may be forced open and broken. There is little to no security for your bags. You should also be aware that most luggage is treated quite poorly in Nepalese airports. It is recomended that all fragile and valuable items be kept in your carry on luggage.

Be aware that when you collect your luggage, an "airport baggage cart collector" may appear and assist you with a baggage trolley.  Unless you insist on handling your own baggage, your items will be loaded on the trolley and will be conveyed with you to the entrance of the terminal. You will then be expected to pay a tip to this person.  Arriving just beforehand in Nepal, you will often only have larger denomination foreign currency in your pocket, making the issue of a tip a bit of a problem. It's fine to pay the tip in foreign currency but make sure you have some small bills or coins on hand (even a dollar or two will be significant to Nepalis).

====Money Exchange at the Airport====
Try not to exchange money at the airport as there are service charges and lower rates offered than what you can get in Thamel or elsewhere in the city.

If you keep the exchange receipt, you could change back to your original currency at the rate on the receipt.

====Getting to and from the airport====
There are no trains in Kathmandu and renting a car without a driver is not possible.

* '''Pre-Arranged Hotel Transfers''' are available from most hotels and are included in most trekking/touring packages. Representatives will be standing outside the arrivals doors behind a barricade and will hold a sign identifying themselves. This form of transport is particularly helpful if you are a novice to Nepal, arriving late at night and unfamiliar with how things work in the country.

* '''Prepaid Taxis''' cost NPR 700-800 to Thamel. Don't give the receipt to the driver until you are at your destination and you are satisfied, as this serves as the driver's payment. If the driver asks for more money, don't give it. Aircon in a prepaid taxi is extra, but it is generally not needed; just open the window.  No need to tip in a prepaid taxi as the driver will get more than the regular taxi metered rate for the journey.
* '''Regular Taxis''' are an easy way to get to the city but be prepared to negotiate the price beforehand, heavily. The cheapest rate that you can get to Thamel is NPR400-500, or, if you go to the end of the parking lot and catch a taxi there (where the taxis do not have to pay the airport entrance fee), you may be able to get a rate of NPR200-300, which is close to the standard meter rate. Taxi drivers may try to extract some commission by showing you one or more hotels on the way. 

* '''Local buses''' pickup and drop-off at the airport gate, 0.5km from the terminal. The buses generally do not have fixed schedules and are often crowded and painful but cost only NPR10-20. Ask the cashier about where the bus stops.
To get from the airport to Katmandu, turn right when you get off of the terminal. Go to the roundabout. Then take the exit and walk for 2min until the gate. Go on your left on the main Street to the bus station. Ask the buses if they go to Ratna Park (10min walk from Thank) or other destinations.
To get from Katmandu to the airport buses start from the Purano Bus Park near Ratna park ( GPS 27.703577, 85.316711). You can place your bag on top  (and sit there if you wish) and as it's the first stop you get the seat too. The buses wait till full before they go and cost 15 rupees ( November 2015). Allow plenty of time, as the ride may take 1h.

===By bus===
For more information, see [[Nepal#Get in|Nepal 'Get in' section]].

There is frequent and cheap bus service between Kathmandu and nearly all parts of Nepal. However, due to poor roads and frequent delays the buses are some of the slowest and least comfortable in South Asia.

Buses arriving from the border with [[India]], [[Pokhara]], and Chitwan terminate in Kathmandu either at the Balaju Bus Station (north) or the Kalanki Station (south). From there, there are 'mini buses' which criss cross the main roads of the city for about NPR20. 

====From [[Pokhara]]====
Tourist buses (NPR800, 6-7h) and crowded local buses/microbuses (NPR400-600, 6-7h) travel the 200km journey between Kathmandu and Pokhara almost every 15 minutes starting at 07:30 through late afternoon. Night buses are available, but the ride is painful. [http://greenline.com.np/ Greenline] operates a convenient bus every morning between the popular tourist areas of Thamel in Kathmandu and Lakeside in Pokhara (USD20, lunch included). The road is winding and includes many switchbacks and offers wonderful views of hills and rural Nepalese lifestyle. The drivers will generally not drive too fast but some will calmly weave in and out of the stream of opposing traffic and slam on the brakes when a stop is required, making for a scary ride if you look out the front window.  During the rainy season, there may be problems with the roads and flying may make more sense.

====From [[India]]====
Buses run between Kathmandu and the Indian cities of  [[Patna]], [[Gorakhpur]], [[Varanasi]] (INR1,200), and [[Lucknow]].

====From [[Tibet]]====

Buses and minivans run between Kathmandu and the Nepalese-Sinese border of [[Rasuwa Fort]]. The 140km journey takes 8+ hours and costs NPR500. Buses depart until the early afternoon. Private jeeps (USD60 for up to 4 people) are a faster option, and can make this journey in 5+ hours.

==Get around==
[[Image:Kathmandu.png|thumb|320px|Map of central Kathmandu]]
If you fly in, be sure to pick up a free Katmandu Valley map at the airport. The first thing some visitors notice about Kathmandu is the general lack of street names except for major roads such as Tri Devi & Ring Road (loops around the city) & address numbers. In most cases directions are given relative to the nearest '''chowk''' or '''tole''' (an intersection or square, often with a market) or a noteworthy location or building (such as a temple or restaurant). In the tourist district of Thamel, the Kathmandu Guest House & Hot Breads bakery are two main landmarks. 

===By foot===

It is possible to get around Kathmandu by foot, but it is not always a pleasant walk (potholes, uncovered sewage drains, etc.), so you may want to consider public transportation for anything more than wandering around a specific area. Pollution is a significant problem and tends to be worse during the winter months (Dec-Feb). You can buy masks with integrated filters in local shops or supermarkets like Bhat Bhateini. Be away from packs of dogs at night - they can be dangerous; Do not approach!

===By rickshaw, taxi, or pick-up by motorbike===
Rickshaws can be found around the tourist area of Thamel and taxis are everywhere.  All taxis have meters which should be used - simply say 'no meter no pay' if the driver refuses to use the meter and move to the next taxi.  Before 9pm rates start at NPR14 and after 9pm they are 21NPR. If a driver uses his meter it is courteous to tip (up to one third is about the  norm).  Alternatively, negotiate a price before you get in a taxi or Rickshaw.  A negotiated price will typically be two to three times the metered rate unless you are a very good negotiator! Prices go up after dark (see above) and in less busy areas. Taxis are easy to find; they park near all major streets & have fare-meters. After 22:00 it can be very difficult to find taxis away from central tourist areas or major hotels. It should be possible to hire a taxi for 300rs one-way to Patan & 800-1,200 rs to Bakhtapur from Thamel or the airport. For longer trips & to hire a taxi by the day negotiate with the driver. Haggle hard; you will easily find another driver if you are not satisfied.  The meter is always your best bet if you are not confident enough to negotiate. However it should be avoided if the driver suggests using it, as it is probably fixed and will overcharge you. After 11PM, taxis can be harder to find outside Thamel.

Else if you have a motorcycle driving license you can simply rent a motorcycle in kathmandu] which will cost you 7USD up to 50USD per day depending on a motorcycle, which will give you the freedom to travel and less cost than hiring a car or taxi.

If you carry a smart phone with you, there are several apps (Pathao and Tootle) that work similar to Lyft/Uber, but to hire a motorbike driver to pick you up and drop you off. You can set the pick-up point to your current location and either enter a landmark or address to be dropped off at, or drag a pin on the map to where you want to go. You will see the calculated fare before you start your trip and don't need to negotiate.

===By bus===
There are also '''buses''' for longer trips [[Kathmandu Valley|within the valley]], ie Patan, Bakhtapur, Boudha, etc. that can be used for trips in  & around around town. See [[Kathmandu#Get out|below]] for tips on traveling outside of the valley.  Blue '''buses''' & green buses constantly drive in circles/loops around the city on "Ring Road" - for 20 to 35rps - depending on the distance.  Every  bus has a cashier/attendant who can tell you where it stops & alert you upon arrival. Riding the buses with the local people can be very pleasant & interesting but at the same time it is confusing as well as there are no proper signboards for navigating around. The buses are typically very old and rough. Local people are usually very friendly and helpful in case you are confused during the excursion. Having 5 and 10 rupee notes can be very helpful. From Thamel, it is about 1.5km walk to the Ring Road, and you can take the bus for many of the main attractions, saving money of a taxi/rickshaw.

*'''Boudha Stupa''' in [[Boudha]] (बौद्ध). One of the most sacred sites for Tibetan Buddhism. This huge stupa is one of the largest in the world. It is located to the northeast of Dwarikas' Hotel and just to the north of the airport area. This is another World Heritage Site. There is a 'festival' on every full moon night, a unique experience.

*'''British Cemetery''' - Fascinating, small historical cemetery located at the very end of the narrow lane that runs between the Indian and British Embassies very close to Thamel. Just keep on walking and you'll find it. Graves date back to the days of the Residency, and up to the present day.  A melancholy, but fascinating cultural contrast to Pashupatinath Temple.
*'''Freak Street''' - Historic street where western hippies seeking enlightenment would stay. Now just a few restaurants and hotels. 
*'''Garden of Dreams / Kaiser Mahal''' [http://www.gardenofdreams.org.np/] - Relax in this beautiful and peaceful walled garden close to Thamel and the former Royal Palace. Beautifully renovated in partnership with the Austrian government. Currently has two pavilions depicting two of the six annual seasons in the Hindu calendar. It has several expensive cafes and a bar. Nice toilets. NPR200.
*'''Narayanhiti Palace Museum''' - This is the former Royal Palace which was turned partly into a Museum and partly into the Foreign Ministry after the abolition of the monarchy in 2009. Now you can visit the splendid Halls of the main building of the palace. Giant fruit bats hanging from the tall trees and 20-foot-tall bamboo around the otherwise modern (and still well-secured) former palace are a sight, especially around sunset when the bats depart en masse. Foreigners: NPR500
*'''Pashupatinath''' - An important Hindu temple to Shiva in the form of Lord of Animals. See monkeys, cremation, sadhus, and meditation caves. Morning or sunset are great times to go. 1000 Rupess for foreigners, though you can sneak in through the park at the North side of the temple, as many locals do (beware of police though, who try to catch people doing exactly this). No entry inside the main temple for foreigners, though you can peer inside from the doorway. Also, there are stairs on the East side of the river leading to the Boudha Stupa (a short walk away).
*'''Swayambhu (स्वयम्भू) aka Monkey Temple''' - A site on a hill overlooking the city with a large stupa and other Buddhist and Hindu iconography. One of the most sacred Buddhist sites in the country. There are 350 steps to the top - the back route is less steep but the views on the way up are not as nice. Aside from the views over the city and the ancient carvings in every available space, it's crowded with monkeys mingling with the visitors. The base of the hill is a 30-minute walk from Thamel (make sure you have a map as there are several confusing intersections along the way), or take a taxi or rickshaw. As with the Boudha Stupa, are plenty of Buddhist and Tibetan-inspired trinkets for sale. There are also drinks for sale at the top, and at least one small restaurant selling momos. For those that have their own transport or have difficulty climbing stairs there is a parking lot at the back entrance that significantly reduces the number of stairs that need to be climbed to gain access to the main compound. This is one of seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the Kathmandu Valley. Foreigners: NPR750 for a multiple-entry pass.  
*'''Thamel Chowk''' - a tourist neighborhood with many restaurants and shops.

====Kathmandu Durbar Square====
[[Image:Kathmandu.jpg|thumb|right|Durbar Square, Kathmandu]]
This ancient square is crowded with palaces and temples, including the current incarnation of the '''Kasthamandap''' or "Wooden house" that gives the city its name. The square has been occupied since the construction of a palace around 1000AD. This site is the most popular UNESCO World Heritage Site in Nepal.

The Square is particularly fascinating in the very early morning as all the various merchants set up their wares and when many devotees make their offerings at the various shrines and temples. There will be a number of young men who will offer to be "guides." Be firm with saying "no" if you are not interested. The entrance fee for foreigners is NPR1000. If you plan to be in the area for more than one day, it's worth being directed to the Site Office where you can exchange your single-entry ticket with a multiple-entry pass allowing you to wander in and out as you wish. You will need your passport and one passport photo. The whole process takes only a few minutes. Your entry pass gives you access to all open parts of Durbar Square as well as the Hanuman Dhoka. If you don't feel like coughing up the slightly hefty entrance fee to enter an area of a city, it is very easy to sneak into Durbar Square via small side alleys from the west side. In Nepali, Durbar means "palace" and this is where the monarch was crowned and from where he ruled.

It is possible to climb the steps of many of the temples for a better look and to join others seated near the top watching the activity below. There are more than a dozen buildings and statues of note in this small area.  They include:
*'''Ashok Binayak'''
*'''Bhagwati Temple'''
*'''Indrapur Temple''' 
*'''Kal Bhairab'''
*'''Krishna Temple'''
*'''Kumari Palace'''- home of "the Kumari", or living goddess, a young girl. South side of Durbar Square, 
*'''Mahendreswar Temple'''
*'''Maju Deval'''
*'''Narayan Temple'''
*'''Nasal Chowk''' Statues, temples, and the Rana museum. Located in the Hanuman Dhoka former palace complex, the courtyard was used for royal coronations as recently as 2001.
*'''Saraswati Temple''' The Goddess of Knowledge and Learning
*'''Shiva Temple'''
*'''Shiva-Parvati Temple'''
*'''Sweta Bhairab''' Statue shown only during the '''Indra Jatra''' festival.
*'''Taleju Temple''' One of the oldest temples in the square, this three-roofed temple with its pyramid-shaped bases, is an example of the typical Newari architectural style. 
*'''Vishnu temple'''
Along with these temples there are a number of Viharas, the Buddhist monastries of Kathmandu. Baha (Nepal Bhasa:बहाः) is a Nepalese Buddhist monastry. It often includes open courtyard found along the narrow lane of Kathmandu. It is the most dominant type of courtyard in Newari Architecture.
Some baha in Kathmandu are:
*Bhagwan Baha Thabahi (Thamel Tole)
*Makhan baha
*Sabal Baha
*Tacchya Baha
*Te Bahal
*Mu Baha
*Musya Baha
*Nagbahal
*Kwa Baha
*Itum bahal

[[Image:Nepal_festival1.jpg|thumb|Festival just outside Kathmandu]]
Kathmandu and Dubar Square is the centre for many of Nepal's festivals. Note that many businesses are closed for all of these holidays—and often a few days before and after. Dasain in particular tend to shut down much of the city for October.

*'''Tihar, Festival of Lights (Also called Deepawali)''' A  five day festival which takes place each year on the fifteenth day of ''Kartika'', around the end of '''October'''/start of '''November''', celebrated by all Hindus with ritual house-cleaning, lanterns, candles, and fireworks. The Nepali version tends to be more picturesque and less explosive  than those celebrated in [[India]].

They also provide a water bottle refill service that is also cheaper than buying new bottles (Rs 10). You can also buy there some biodegradable soap and iodine for your trek.

==Buy==
Instead of negotiating for souvenirs in the tourist neighborhood of Thamel, consider traveling across the Thapathali Bridge towards Kupandole in Patan. There are several fixed-price, fair-trade handicraft shops along the road, For example, Sabah[http://sabahnp.org/], Dhukhuti[https://www.facebook.com/DhukutiACP/].
There are many ATM machines in Thamel, however, not all accept foreign cards. For those that do implement a charge of NPR500 per transaction, SBI bank charges even PR 700 (March 2016). Nabil Bank ATMs have the highest withdrawal limit of NPR35,000 per transaction. All shops will accept Nepali rupees and Indian Rupees and many will also accept US dollars.  Indian SBI cards can be used with Nepal SBI bank with a very small fee (~50 NPR) and no conversion fee.

If you are staying in Thamel, the Shop Right Supermarket, near Kathmandu Guest House, offers the biggest choice for basic necessities and snacks, including NPR30 for a 1L bottle of water. But in general, it's probably the most expensive supermarket in Thamel.

Most shops tend to charge more for tourists. Expect to pay more than MRP for most products.

===Books===
Kathmandu is a great place to stock up or trade in reading material. Used bookstores cover everything from backpacker favorites to classics, to local history and culture.

*'''Vajra Books[http://www.vajrabookshop.com]''', Jyatha, Thamel (very near to Chikusa Café). Huge selection of books on Buddhism, Nepal, and Tibet studies.

*'''Pilgrims''' [http://www.pilgrimsbooks.com] in Thamel (next to the Kathmandu Guest House) was the largest and most well-established English language bookshop in Kathmandu until it burned in May 2013. Visit their nearby outlet – Pilgrims Book House on JP Road, Thamel; opposite to Helena’s Restaurant.

*'''Tibet Book Store''', Thamel (on the road leading in from the palace). Good selection of books on Vajrayana and Tibet studies.

*'''Second Hand'''. The alleys of Thamel are full of second-hand bookshops. Check around for a good price, as they do vary immensely. Return read books for 50% buyback or store credit.

*'''Ekta Books'''. A huge collection of almost all types of books is found in Ekta Books, which is in Thapathali near Norvic Hospital.

*'''Mandala Book Point''', Kantipath, Tel: 4227711 [http://www.mandalabookpoint.com]. Probably the best for all types of references, academic texts, tourist books, and maps. Mandala also publishes books on sociology, anthropology, culture, politics, and the history of Nepal. It is also a center for most scholars visiting Nepal, and patrons are encouraged to take part in the lively and informative discussions that frequently occur within the shop every evening. The most reliable shop for The Economist and International Herald Tribune. Located on the east side of Kantipath just south of the Mountain Hotel and Nabil Bank building.

*'''Educational Books''', Kantipath, across the street from Mandala, has a very good selection and friendly staff.

*'''Quixote's Cove: the bookshop''', Jawalakhel, Tel: 553-6974 [http://www.qcbookshop.com]. Located next to New Orleans Cafe in Jawalakhel, this bookshop is housed in an old 1930s building and combines a great collection of fiction with a marvelously cozy environment.

==Eat==
[[Image:Nepal_thamel.jpg|thumb|One of Thamel's Many Rooftop Cafes]]
{{style|[[Listings|listings format]]}}
The most popular food in Kathmandu could be the momo, a dumpling which has its roots in the Tibetan mountains.  They are available fried or steamed and stuffed with buffalo, chicken, or veggies. Prices can vary depending on the location and what they are filled with, but expect to pay between NPR80-250 for a dozen. Kathmandu is also a good place to sample traditional Newari and Tibetan dishes.

A Nepali set meal will usually include rice, daal, vegetable/meat curry, a vegetable dish, pickle (''achar'') and curd. Expect to pay around NPR140-280 at a tourist place, much less at local places. Chiya, a milky spiced tea similar to the Indian chai, is ubiquitous and good for a break to calm one's nerves.

Note that most restaurants that cater to tourists will add a 10% service charge and then a 13% VAT charge (total of 24.5%) to the prices stated on the menu. These additional charges must be clearly stated on the menu.

===Thamel===
There are dozens of tourist restaurants clustered in the '''Thamel''' district serving everything from Middle Eastern to Mexican food. Indian and Nepali dishes are always the best tasting and the best priced. Don't hesitate to state your preference for spiciness. Visitors venturing into smaller places are often rewarded with better prices and friendlier staff.
* '''Vibe Restro''', Leknath Marg, just at the north edge of Thamel (27°43'05.4"N 85°18'37.8"E). Small place owned and operated by nice and friendly family. Best dal bhat I had during my 6 weeks in Nepal and one of the cheapest places in Thamel area.

===Freak Street===
A few good places to eat, such as the Ganesh restaurant halfway along the street next to a small shrine. Try the cakes at the tiny, bright blue "Snowman" cakeshop.

===Near the Airport===
If you're looking for a quick cheap snack of tasty curry or momo check out the small roadside stand across the ring road right at the airport. With your back towards the airport its just 200 m left of the Airport Hotel, at the junction of a small dirt road.

===Elsewhere===
*'''Angan''', on the corner behind the King's statue roundabout. A good place to have ice cream (NPR35), Indian traditional sweets or freshly prepared Masala Dhosa which is curry in a crisp savory crêpe, NPR65-75. Sweets in the front, fast food restaurant in the back. The bhel poori is spicy. This is the heart of the Nepalis' upmarket shopping district, where New Road and Dharma Path meet. Walk west from here on the pedestrian street to Freak Street, the outdoor craft market, the old 'Red Palace' and the many temples of Durbar square.

*'''Bakery Cafe''' There are several outlets of this chain restaurant all around Kathmandu and Patan. A great place to have momos, beer and sizzlers which is steak with butter sauce and noodles. Can be  considered "the McDonald's of Nepal" due to its popularity. Although it isn't fast food, you can find great food here that is prepared within 15 minutes. Most of the staff are deaf, so your money is going to a good cause.

*'''Bawarchi''' Superb Indian and Chinese food, specializing in kathi rolls which are a fried, flat bread wrap with spicy meat, paneer or veg filling. Great for lunchtime snacks or evening meals. Their three locations can be found opposite the Ambassador Hotel on Lazimpat; on the Maharajgunj, near the UNHCR and American Embassy; and in the Barryo Fiesta foodcourt next to Mike's Breakfast. One of the few expatriate-friendly restaurants with delivery.

*'''Chez Caroline''' The place to be seen in Kathmandu, set in Babar Mahal revisited, just off the main Thapathali junction, near the old parliament building. Excellent French food and salads. 700-900 for a main. Ask a taxi driver to find it.

*'''Mike's Breakfast''' is a brisk 15 minute walk from Thamel Taxi Stand, but confusing with one-way streets. Take a rickshaw or taxi the first time, & mark it on one of the free hotel KTM maps. The best pancakes in Nepal, and now other meals, too. Mostly outdoor tables under bamboo shelters + available indoor screened dining.

*'''New Natraj Tandoori''' Cheap, plentiful and delicious Indian food. Not to be confused with the Natraj tandoori a few doors down. Opposite the Shangri-La hotel on Lazimpat.

*'''Pizza Express''' While not quite on par with Roadhouse Cafe or Fire and Ice, Pizza Express makes a tasty product from their locations in Lazimpat (216-1212) and in Basantbur Plaza (423-2777). They are unique in that they are the only mainstream pizza shop with delivery in Kathmandu. The fast-food style decor and focus on delivery and take-out are reflected both in their prices and quick service.

*'''Roadhouse Cafe''' maintains locations outside of Thamel in Bhat Bhatteni, one block north of the Bhat Bateni supermarket, and Pulchowk.

*'''Wunjala Moskva''' Tucked away in Naxal district, delicious Newari food in a beautiful setting; performances on the courtyard of the restaurant, and unlimited shots of local booze.

*"Hot and bakes" There are some small and cosy places with this name. You can drink tasty coffee there, eat different cakes and bakes. Really democratic prices and friendly stuff.

==Drink==

===Coffee===
[[Image:coffee.JPG|thumb|the taste of Nepali coffee]]
Nepal is a coffee-producing country, though the people are famously tea drinkers. Most often coffee is of the instant type, although fresh coffee is available. When ordering, try ordering "strong coffee", as opposed to just "coffee", if you don't want instant coffee. Expect your cappuccino to be anywhere from very little froth in the large cup to something laced with whipped cream, and there is little difference between a latte and a cappuccino. Places to look for fresh, ground coffee are:
* <drink name="Bakery Cafe" alt="" address="Teendhara Marg, Kathmandu 44600" directions="" lat="" long="" phone="+977 14169247" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="http://www.thebakerycafe.com.np/" hours="" price="">It serves good coffee at some outlets.

Tiramisu is the best you can find in Thamel).</drink>

===Bars===
{{style|[[Listings|listings format]]}}
Beer and mixed drinks are available at almost every bar and restaurant. For a quick drink and cheap cultural experience, try the local 'Nepali wine' (''raksi'') or 'Nepali Beer' (''chang'') neither of which taste anything like their namesakes. Gorkha Beer, Everest Beer, Nepal Ice, San Miguel, Carlsberg, and Tuborg beer are the principal conventional beers served in Kathmandu. Local beers tend to be more reliable than the imports. 

*'''Celtic Manang''' Irish bar, run by Mary from Cork. Over some shops, not far from Kathmandu Guest House. Mighty crack on St Patrick's Day!

*'''Everest Irish Pub''' a newly opened Irish Pub where you can have Guinness, foods and music along with friendly and excellent ambience.

*'''Full Moon Club'''. Above Just Juice and Shakes. A mix of Nepalis and expats. Occasional live music

*'''House of Music''' is largely frequented by locals and expats for its focus on original live Nepali music - from rock to reggae, himalayan blues to jazz (rarely covers). Artists featured are up-and-coming and popular Nepali bands. Food (bar snacks/Asian fusion) and drinks served.

*'''H2O''' a cool hang-out place with live music. The bar serves a good selection of food and drinks with a complimentary popcorn! Amazing atmosphere and really friendly staff will make you come back every night!

*'''Irish Pub Lazimpat''', (''next to Shanker Hotel''). Irish dishes, a great variety of beer (also Guinness) and whisky (international and local), Irish Coffee (also Creamy Irish Coffee) cocktails, mocktails, energy cocktails, summer cocktails, shooters (try "Irish Flag"). During the cold season, you can also find "hot winter drinks". Friday nights live music, dart. Well trained, friendly staff. Run under German management.

*'''New Orleans Cafe'''. Opposite Kathmandu guest house, live music on many nights. Described by its manager as "the most happening place in Kathmandu". Make of that what you will!

*'''Pub Maya'''. Laid back sports bar version of Cocktail Bar. Free popcorn and 2-for-1 happy hour drinks.

*'''Tom and Jerry's Pub''' A busy, fun bar with pool tables, a wide selection of cocktails and beers as well as friendly staff. Very much a tourist hang out. However avoided by local expats after several incidents with aggressive rats.

*'''Sam's''' A cozy nook upstairs with years of wisdom or random song lyrics scrawled on the walls. The usual drinks and usual ex-pat crowd.

*'''Tongues and Tales'''. Chilled, smoke-friendly cocktail bar with comfortable seating and good music. Upstairs, (look for the sign at the doorway) halfway downhill on the road between Hot Breads corner and Steak House street. A good place to hear about parties.

==Sleep==
Virtually all tourist accommodations are located in Thamel, near the Kathmandu Guesthouse. Upscale hotels tend to be a few blocks away on Durbar Marg near the former Royal Palace. A few guest houses still remain on ''Freak Street'' below Durbar Square, they tend to be somewhat cheaper, and a bit less well cared for than Thamel, but the neighbourhood is quieter and there are fewer touts though there tend to be more pickpockets. 

Remember any tout on the street who takes you to a place, their commission will be included in the price.  Best to find a place on your own and cheaper.

Prices can range from NPR500-35,000 for a double room.

==Stay safe==
Canadian Consular Affairs [http://www.voyage.gc.ca/dest/report-en.asp?country=205000], the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office [https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice] provides travel advice. Currently, Nepal is safe to visit but caution must be taken. After the Maoists joined the government, Nepal has become relatively peaceful. However, visitors should avoid public demonstrations and may want to register with their consulate on arrival. Although tourists haven't been directly targeted by politically motivated violence, it is possible to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.  The frequent strikes that are still held are a major inconvenience for most tourists as all transportation stops, and shops and restaurants close.

If you're a clearly non-Nepali-looking traveler you will be approached by young guys who will say that they're trying to practice their English. They will give you a story about how they're studying to be artists, take you around the temples (against your will), and then will come out the sob story about how their house was destroyed in the earthquake, the dad's an alcoholic, they have to support their siblings, etc. They'll then take you to the "school" where they will try and guilt trip you into giving them money, saying it's for kids. It's a scam. If anyone approaches you saying "Hey my friend/brother" either ignore them or tell them you know the scam. They then leave you alone. 

Due to the lack of street lights, tourists should watch out for the double hazards of opportunistic crimes in the darkness, and tripping or twisting ankles when walking the uneven, unlit streets by night. Be alert to avoid packs of dogs at night.

Following the news and government warnings is important. Be sure to check on current road conditions before leaving Kathmandu. Long-haul bus trips through the Eastern Terai are to be avoided as there was a risk of Maoist activity in this area. The most common route is Kathmandu to the border crossing at Karkavitta. There have been numerous reports of Maoists stopping buses and setting them alight, although allowing passengers to disembark first. Check daily newspapers or '''NepalBandh''',  for advance warning of planned strikes (''bandh''), when it may be safe to stay away from the main roads in town.

While in Kathmandu, always keep an eye on your belongings. Violent crime is rare; pickpockets are not, especially in crowded places. If your hotel room door doesn't have a good lock or safe windows, store valuables on your person or in a hotel safety deposit box at all times. As with any large city, avoid walking alone in unlit areas.

A recent review of the region's electric grid found that inefficient management rather than under-capacity was the main cause of the power cuts. 24-hour electricity is generally available across most of the Kathmandu Valley. The power supply can still experience some intermittent hiccups now and then, but returning travelers will notice that the 8-12+ hour/day power cuts are now a thing of the past.

==Stay healthy==
*'''Water''' in Kathmandu borders on being lethal, and [[Tropical diseases|water borne diseases]] are rife. Do not, under any circumstances, drink directly from the faucet or take salads and ice unless you have absolute proof that the water used in their preparation has been filtered and boiled. Also, use boiled and filtered water for brushing your teeth and avoid swallowing water when taking a shower. Circumstances may differ in private houses or one of the better hotels in Kathmandu.         
*'''Food''' can be contaminated and some people suggest that you should eat only at larger restaurants, though larger restaurants are no guarantee against contamination. You may often avoid any stomach infections if you stick strictly to the old rule: Cook it, peel it, or leave it. That is, never eat something that has not been heated properly, except peeled fruit. However, you may use ''light brown'' iodine water to disinfect fruit and salad. Be careful of rice, incl. fried rice, that is not properly heated.
*'''Vaccinations''' for rabies, tetanus, typhoid, and hepatitis are recommended prior to arriving in Kathmandu, and can take several months to complete. Tropical diseases such as Japanese encephalitis should be vaccinated against if you plan to travel outside of the Kathmandu Valley, towards the lowlands in the Terai. You may wish to take a malarial prophylaxis. See [http://www.ciwec-clinic.com/articles/immunization_advice_for_nepal.php Immunization advice for Nepal]
*'''Animals''', such as bats and monkeys (including those at Swayambhunath), may be carriers of rabies and other diseases. Even if you've had the foresight to be vaccinated for rabies prior to traveling to Nepal, treatment following possible exposure is still necessary to prevent infection. If you are bitten, you should go to a clinic immediately for treatment. No cases of avian influenza have been documented in Nepal to date, but it has been confirmed in nearby countries. Birds live in extremely close proximity to humans, both in the market and the home.
*'''Clinics & Hospitals'''
** '''[http://www.neuro.org.np/ National Institute of Neurological and Allied Sciences]''', run by Dr. Upendra Devkota, also comes at par with some of the Western hospitals.  
** '''[http://www.dent-inn.com Dent Inn]''' offers international-standard service for dental problems at good prices.
** '''[http://nams.org.np/ Bir Hospital]''' is home to one of the few ENT departments in the country, but should otherwise be avoided.  It is a government hospital and is run down and chaotic at best.

==Contact==
Most cafes & coffee shops in tourist areas have free WiFi for customers.  Computer/internet rentals are almost stacked on top of each other in Thamel & near the stupa at [[Boudha]]. You can surf to you heart's content for about 15Rs to 20Rps an hour (10Rps in Putalisadak). Though not adequate for video conferencing the 128-256kbps NTC backbone often used by the cafes is more than adequate for VOIP calling. Please refrain from downloading anything large, as most connections are limited. ISD and STD telephone services are available in almost all internet cafes. Services such as Skype are available in most tourist areas.
