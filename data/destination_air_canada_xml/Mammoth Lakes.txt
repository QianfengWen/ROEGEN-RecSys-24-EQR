'''Mammoth Lakes''' [http://www.ci.mammoth-lakes.ca.us] is a resort city next to '''Mammoth Mountain''' which is a popular skiing destination.  Mammoth Lakes is in the [[Eastern Sierra]] region of the [[Sierra Nevada]] mountains in [[California]].

==Understand==
The Sierra Nevada mountains are a popular snow skiing destination. For Californians living in [[Los Angeles]], Mammoth Mountain is the easiest resort to get to from [[Los Angeles]].

The Town of Mammoth Lakes serves one main function: a place for these hordes of Los Angelenos to stay.  Condos, motels, hotels, and restaurants fill this small town to serve the flood of winter visitors. In summer, the flood stops and rents plunge, making Mammoth an affordable base to explore the region.  

At 8000 feet of elevation, the city stays naturally cool during the region's summer heat waves.  Nearby [[Bishop]] routinely heats to 105°F (40C) while Mammoth tops out around 84°F (29C).

==Get in==

===By plane===

* '''Mammoth Yosemite Airport''' ({{IATA|MMH}}) is just east of US-395 near Mammoth. 
* '''Alaska Airlines/Horizon Air''' provides year-round service from LAX in Los Angeles.
* '''United Airlines''' offers direct non-stop flights from San Francisco, CA (SFO), Orange County Airport (SNA), and San Diego (SAN) to Mammoth Lakes CA between December and April

===By car===
Nearby US 395 brings visitors from the south ([[Los Angeles]] and [[Bakersfield]]) and the north ([[Reno]]). 

From the [[San Francisco]] [[Bay Area (California)|Bay Area]], Highway 120 (Tioga Road) from [[Yosemite]] is the quick route, but is passable only in summer and early fall. Interstate 80 and US 50 provide cross-mountain access during the winter months, subject to icy conditions and closure due to blizzards.

===By bus===
The Eastern Sierra Transit Authority (ESTA) operates a bus to and from Lone Pine in California and the Reno Nevada Greyhound Bus Station that stops at the Mammoth Lakes McDonalds on Route 203, once north bound and once south bound each day (the bus also stops at the Reno/Tahoe Airport). The same Authority also operates a route to and from Mammoth Lakes and the Lancaster, California Greyhound Bus Station also once north bound and once south bound each day (the bus also stops near the Inyo Kern Airport).

The Yosemite Area Regional Transit System (YARTS) operates a bus to and from Mammoth Lakes and Yosemite Valley  from June through September (weekends only during June and September) once east bound and once west bound on days that it runs. This bus is popular with back country campers.

==Get around==
Between the city of Mammoth Lakes and the Mammoth Mountain resort, a bike will do fine in summer. Frequent trams run between the town and the slopes during the winter.  There are no outside racks for skis and snowboards on the trams. For everything else, you need a car.

==See==
* '''Hot Creek Geological Area''' (On a dirt road just east of the airport, which is just south along US395).  An area of hot springs and steam in a very small canyon.  Several pools are scalding hot and will result in death if you jump in.  Swimming is currently forbidden due to increased geothermal activity.
