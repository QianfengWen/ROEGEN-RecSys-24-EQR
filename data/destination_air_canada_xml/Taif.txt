'''Taif''' (pronounced "Taayef", also written Ta'if) is a city in western [[Saudi Arabia]]. It is in the Hejaz mountains near [[Mecca]] and served as 
a summer retreat for the royals and commoners from neighboring areas. The city is the center of an agricultural area known for its grapes, pomegranate, figs, roses, and honey.

==History==

In the 6th century, before the rise of Islam, the city of Tā'if was a religious center as it housed the idol of the goddess Allāt, who was then known as "the Lady of Tā'if." Its climate marked the city out from its dry and barren neighbors closer to the Red Sea. Wheat, vines, and fruit were grown around Tā'if and this is how the city earned its title "the Garden of the Hejaz".

In AD 630, with the rise of Islam, the Muslims attempted an unsuccessful Siege of Ta'if. The city was assaulted by catapults, but it repelled the attacks. However, the Battle of Tabouk in 631 left Tā'if completely isolated, so city members arrived in Mecca to negotiate the conversion of the city to Islam. The idol of Allāt was destroyed along with all of the other signs of the city's previously pagan existence. The city has since been under various Islamic caliphates: Rashidun, Umayyad, Abbasid, Fatimid, Ayyubid, Mamluk, and finally the Ottomans.

The city remained Ottoman from 1517 until 1802, when it was retaken by rebels in alliance with the House of Saud. These forces then proceeded to take Mecca and Medina. The loss was keenly felt by the Ottoman Empire, which viewed itself as the protector of the Holy Cities. The Ottoman sultan, Mahmud II, called upon his nominal viceroy in Egypt, Muhammad Ali, who launched an attack on the Hejaz and reconquered Ta'if in 1813.

With the fall of the Ottoman Empire, the city became part of the short-lived Hashemite Kingdom of Hejaz, until the House of Saud annexed it.

==Get in==

Domestic flights are available to [[Abha]], [[Dammam]], [[Jazan]], [[Jeddah]], [[Medina]], [[Nejran]], [[Riyadh]] and [[Tabuk]] on Saudi.
