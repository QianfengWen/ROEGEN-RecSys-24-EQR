'''Aguascalientes''' is in the [[Bajio]] region of [[Mexico]]. 

==Understand==
Aguascalientes is the capital and largest city of the central Mexican state of the same name. The city currently has a metro population of around 1,000,000. Aguascalientes is one of Mexico's fastest growing cities, as can be seen from its relatively small historic core and the variety of more modern neighborhoods that surround it.

===History===
The city of Aguascalientes was founded in 1575 as a rest stop between the major silver-producing center of Zacatecas and Mexico City. When the territory of the state of Aguascalientes was separated from Zacatecas, the city of Aguascalientes became its capital. Though its designation as a capital city contributed substantially to its growth, Aguascalientes remained a relatively minor city until the past few decades. Since then, it's grown into an industrial powerhouse thanks in large part to two of the world's largest Nissan manufacturing plants--with a third now on its way.

The historic center of Aguascalientes is small but attractive. Traditional neighborhoods include the Barrio del Encino, home to the Templo del Encino with its famed "Black Christ," the Barrio de Guadalupe, home to the baroque Templo de Guadalupe, and the Barrio de San Marcos, easily the city's most visited and home to the renowned annual San Marcos Fair. Calle Caranza runs through the historic center and is popular for its colonial buildings converted into museums, cultural centers, restaurants, and nightclubs. Additional popular destinations walkable from Plaza Patria (the city's central square) include the cafes, restaurants and shops of El Codo and the Templo de San Antonio, often considered among a short list of Mexico's most beautiful churches.

Modern Aguascalientes, however, stretches far beyond the city's historic core. There are three "ring" roads that circle the historic center. The smallest is Primer Anillo, the second is Segundo Anillo, and the third, Tercer Anillo, has just recently been completed. Primer and Segundo Anillos both run through entirely urban settings. Parts of Tercer Anillo are also totally developed, but some of the newer sections still run through farmland and undeveloped space. Primer and Segundo Anillos are generally very well maintained, as are the new sections of Tercer Anillo. However, in part because it's often used by 18-wheelers, the older parts of Tercer Anillo can be beat up pretty bad.

Just north of the Autonomous University of Aguascalientes runs the Boulevard Luis Donaldo Colosio, normally referred to simply as Colosio. If you're looking for the most contemporary, upscale dining and nightlife in Aguascalientes, this is it! Here you can find Mexican, French, Spanish, Italian, Brazilian, Argentinian, American, Japanese, Chinese, and Pan-Asian cuisine--and this list is probably just scratching the surface. Be aware, however, that if you're looking for traditional Mexican food, you can find equally good and more economical options elsewhere, with a few exceptions.

Especially as far as Mexico is concerned, Aguascalientes is an exceptionally safe city. The historic center and most neighborhoods of interest to foreigners are well policed, and the local force deals with few of the corruption problems that plague many parts of Mexico. Exercise caution as always and avoid rough neighborhoods and you should be completely fine while out and about, even at night.
 
=== Climate ===
The climate in Aguascalientes is warm and dry year-round. Rainfall season is from May until November, although rain is very seldom here. When it does rain it's fierce and brief in the late afternoon leaving the evenings cooled off and dry.

==Eat==

Unsurprisingly, Aguascalientes is home to a huge variety of fantastic dining options, very affordable for foreign visitors. This list is by no means comprehensive, but it does include some of the top places to eat in Aguascalientes.

*'''[https://www.facebook.com/Puerta-Grande-Restaurante-176851399162884 Puerta Grande Restaurante]''' - Located on the Avenida Universidad just north of Primer Anillo, this upscale Spanish restaurant helmed by a transplant chef from Madrid is a favorite spot for upscale lunches and dinners.
*'''[https://www.facebook.com/LePib-633817313400122 LePib]''' - This inconspicuous spot in a strip mall on Colosio is one of the few exceptions to the "don't bother with the local food on Colosio" rule. For delicious cochinita pibil, a regional specialty from the southern state of Yucatan, and incredibly fair prices, this is your place.
*'''[https://www.facebook.com/bestiariosushi Bestiario Sushi]''' - A somewhat "hip" spot on the less-traveled side of the historic downtown area, this is where you'll find some of the best sushi in Aguascalientes. It's got totally traditional Japanese options as well as Japanese-Mexican sushi fusion. There's hardly ever a wait and you can almost always find parking out front, a pleasant change of pace from many other restaurants in the center.
*'''[https://www.facebook.com/Moloko-Social-Club-171089609588693 Moloko]''' - For some of the best pizza in Aguascalientes in one of the city's hippest environments, check out Moloko. It's one of the center's most attractive restaurant/bars, but beware that it gets incredibly crowded on weekend nights. Reservations are accepted.
*'''La Mestiza''' - This traditional, relatively upscale breakfast spot in the Barrio del Encino neighborhood is an Aguascalientes institution. It's in a beautifully refurbished colonial building. On most days you can get in no problem, but on many holidays the line will be out the door!
*'''Los Reyes del Taco''' - This is a small "chain" with locations throughout Aguascalientes, including one on Colosio. If you're going to eat traditional taqueria-style on Colosio, this is the place! A no-frills environment with a play place for the kids, you can't go wrong with any of the tacos or tortas here.  
* '''Mesón del Taco''' - Located on Avenue Aguascalientes Pte. this restaurant sells traditional and authentic Mexican food including their famous Tacos.
*'''Los Mixes''' - Located on Colosio, this "hole in the wall" taco restaurant serves decent tacos, especially if you go at night when everything is being made fresh. As of February 22nd, 2016, Los Mixes has been closed for over a month.
*'''[https://www.facebook.com/Countrybreak/ Countrybreak]''' - If you're craving a traditional American hamburger while you visit Aguascalientes, do yourself a favor and skip Applebee's, McDonald's, etc. Countrybreak serves hamburgers to rival any back in the United States, and they also have more "Mexicanized" options incorporating guacamole, jalapeños, etc. Seriously, these are good burgers! There are two restaurants--one just off Colosio near the Starbucks and one a few blocks behind Torreplaza Bosques. 

*The best food to try while in Aguascalientes include the ''barbacoa de olla'', ''biznaga tamales'', candied guava, caramel sweets, and ''ladrillos''; which is a delicious flaky pastry.

There is a mercado near 5 de Mayo specialising in  delicious roast lamb served with tacos, or try Mercado Teran for cheap eats such as buritos.
