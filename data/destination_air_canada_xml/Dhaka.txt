{{pagebanner|Dhaka banner.jpg}}

'''Dhaka''' (or ''Dacca'') is the capital and largest city of [[Bangladesh]]. It is the cultural and economic hub of the country. Having a colossal historical background, the old part of the city, known as '''[[Old Dhaka]]''' or ''Old Town'', is home to a broad range of architectural heritage starting from the vestiges of the Mughal Empire to the British Colonial buildings. Being the centre of the independence movements of Bangladesh, Dhaka also hosts some significant national monuments and structures. There are a number of annual cultural events held in Dhaka like Pohela Falgun, Pohela Baishakh and Ekushe Book Fair which add a unique flavour to the city. 

The modernization and development of Dhaka during the last couple of decades and a corrupt governing and middle class has made the development of international five star chain hotels profitable and spurred the building of some of the largest shopping malls in the world. There are some cracking amusement parks and a surplus of cheap labour has meant that international restaurant chains are cheaper here than in the neighbouring countries.

Dhaka is a thriving, colourful and congested metropolis of 20 million people. Given the number of people that live there, and the density they live in, Dhaka is one of the most frenetic places on Earth. The streets and rivers are filled with colourful chaos. It also plays host to the highest number of rickshaws in any city in the world, totalling around 400,000; you certainly won't miss them. Experiencing the city for the first time can often seem overwhelming.

The existence of a settlement in the area that is now Dhaka dates from the 7th century. The area was ruled by the Buddhist kingdom of Kamarupa and the Pala Empire before passing to the control of the Hindu Sena dynasty in the 9th century. The Islamic Mughal Empire soon seized control of the city and turned it into a centre of trade and governance. In the years of their vigorous rule, the successive governors and princely viceroys who ruled the province adorned it with many noble monuments, mosques, tombs, fortifications and 'Katras', often surrounded with beautifully laid out gardens and pavilions. The city passed through another phase under the rule of the British, until it became the seat of the eastern division of Pakistan after Indian partitioning. The Liberation War of 1971 gave Bangladesh its independence and Dhaka was declared the country's capital.

Since then, Dhaka has been developing fast as a modern city and is the country's centre of industrial, commercial, cultural, educational and political activity. The gap between rich and poor is widening throughout the country, but it's at its most glaringly obvious here. Depending on where you start from, a thirty minute rickshaw ride can take you from impossibly crowded shanty towns near Old Dhaka to the glitzy high-class neighbourhoods of Gulshan and Banani where a meal costs more than most people earn in a week.

Motijheel is the main commercial area of the city. Dhaka's main waterfront, Sadarghat, is on the banks of the river Buriganga in Old Dhaka and is crowded with various ferries, yachts, paddle steamers, fisherman's boats and floating dhabas all bustling with douche

The '''weather''' is tropical - hot and very humid during the summer monsoon season (April-September) and drier and cooler in the winter (October-March). Visitors from colder countries might want to visit in the winter when temperatures are around 20C and humidity is low (around 60-70%).

'''Visa extensions''' are available at the Immigration and Passport Office on Agargaon Road in Central Dhaka. Most rickshaws and taxis will know where this is. 

===Language=== 
Most of the people will speak Bengali to communicate. Although some Urdu/Hindi speaking population resides in some parts of Old Dhaka, in Bihari Camp in Mirpur and in Geneva Camp in Mohammadpur. You can find English speaking people but do not expect the CNG drivers or ricksha-walas to speak English. If you don't get what they are saying just smile and repeatedly mention your destination, or ask a passer-by to help translating -they are always happy to do it.

==Get in==

===By boat===
Boat (launches) to Barisal departs from Sadarghat every evening 08:00-21:00. Double cabin without air-con is BDT1,600; with air-con it's BDT1,800. Arrives at 04:00 (''Sep 2014'')

===By air===
'''Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport''' (formerly known as Zia International Airport) ({{IATA|DAC}}) is the primary airport serving both the city and the country. There are international flights available from most continents. '''Biman Bangladesh Airlines'''[http://www.biman-airlines.com] is the flag carrier of Bangladesh, and is connected to approximately 18 international destinations, including [[London]]. Although, these services change frequently due to financial issues. Most flights to Dhaka depart from [[Istanbul]], [[Dubai]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Bangkok]] and [[Kolkata]]. There is also significant traffic from Middle Eastern cities including [[Muscat]], [[Jeddah]], [[Bahrain]], [[Doha]] and [[Kuwait]]. Additionally, there are two more international airports in the Sylhet, a north-east divisional city, and Chittagong, the south-east and second largest city of Bangladesh, respectively. The Sylhet International Airport is called Osmani International Airport [code: ZYL] and Chittagong International Aiprot is called Shah Amanat International Airport [code: CGP]. These two international airports are also well connected with many parts of the world with direct flight from and to many Asian and Middle Eastern countries including China, Malaysia, UAE etc when Sylhet airport has direct flight from London, where a huge number of Bangladeshi origin people are living particularly from Sylhet region.

There are frequent services from surrounding countries. Biman operates flights to most of these. Indian carrier '''Jet Air''' has direct flights from [[Kolkata]], [[Dehli]] and [[Mumbai]]. '''Pakistan International Airlines''' has flights from [[Karachi]]. Biman and United Airways offer flights from [[Kathmandu]], and Druk Air has flights from [[Paro]], [[Bhutan]]. '''Cathay Dragon''' operates flights from [[Hong Kong]]. From late 2013, Biman started direct flights to [[Yangon]], [[Myanmar]] twice a week from Dhaka.

Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport is modern and reasonably efficient. However, excessive numbers of mosquitoes seem to inhabit the baggage reclaim area, so be sure to wear long sleeves and cover your legs and feet. Immigration can take a notoriously long time during peak hours (45 minutes plus) as the system is manual and there are only 2 lines for foreign passport holders.

If you want to go from the airport to old dhaka by bus, go from the airport to the main road 4-500m and ask the people to help you to cach a bus to Gulisthan or ask the bus drivers (it's easy, a lot of buses go that direction). ( It takes 1-2h depending on traffic. 20Tk for the ticket, the entertainment is free :) ). 04.2017

===By rail===
[[Image:Map Bangladesh RoadRail.png|thumb|Map of Railway system in Bangladesh; [[Jamuna Bridge]] not shown.]]

[[File:Kamlan.jpg|thumb|Kamalapur Railway Station]]

Dhaka is connected to most major cities of Bangladesh by rail, often more than one service per day.

The '''Maitree Express''' [http://indiarailinfo.com/] provides direct nonstop service from [[Kolkata]], [[India]]. It is the first international rail service in Bangladesh. 

Initially the train was renowned for attracting few passengers, running below 50% occupancy. Since it was converted to a fully air-conditioned train, it has become very popular. It is sometimes hard to get a ticket now.

The train had also been criticized for requiring a long waits at the border crossings on both sides. This led to the authorities moving the border checks to the origin and destination station and cutting the running time by over 2 hours starting mid-2018. It is generally recognized as being a much safer, speedier and less stressful experience than going by bus.

Trains from Kolkata to Dhaka depart Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays, and the reverse departs Saturday, Sunday, Tuesdays and Wednesday. The journey to Dhaka takes 10 hours 50 minutes, and the train to Kolkata takes 11 hours 45 minutes. It carries air-condiftioned Chair Car and air-conditioned First Class Compartment accommodations only (4 coaches of each).

===By road===

===By bus===
Being the capital and geographical centre of Bangladesh, Dhaka is the natural hub for the country's bus companies. There are several bus stations around Dhaka, each of them serving a different region of the country. The stations are not for the faint of heart, being extremely crowded and noisy.

*'''Sayedabad bus station''' is for buses to and from the eastern half of the country, including [[Sylhet Division]] and [[Chittagong Division]]. Sayedabad is currently very chaotic due to the building of a flyover.  Roads have been dug up, and traffic is very slow. CNGs in the area all overcharge due to the lack of any order.

*'''Gabtali bus station''' is for buses to and from the western half of the country, including [[Jessore]], [[Rajshahi Division]] and [[Khulna Division]].

*'''Mohakhali bus station''' is for buses to and from areas north of Dhaka, including [[Tangail]] and [[Mymensingh]]. There are occasionally services to and from cities in the north-western portion of the country, such as Bagura.

'''Luxury buses''' serve locations dotted all over the country. These private buses are air-conditioned, spacey and usually have reclinable seats. Popular operators include [http://greenlineparibahan.com/ Green Line], [http://shyamoli.paribahan.com/ Shyamoli], [http://paribahan.com/paribahan/silkline_browsers/silkline_main.php?/ Silk Line] and [http://shohagh.com/group/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=19&Itemid=53 Shohagh].

They all have ticket offices around town, the most well-known being those at the Pantapath. Green Line serves many major cities, with approximate times and prices listed below:
*[[Chittagong]] (BDT800-1500, 5-6 hours)
*[[Cox's Bazar]] (BDT800-1800, 8-9 hours)
*[[Rajshahi]] (BDT500-1000, 4 hours)
*[[Sylhet]] (BDT480-1200, 5 hours)
*[[Khulna]] (BDT550-1200, 7 hours)
*[[Jessore]] (BDT550-1200, 5-6 hours)

From '''India''', there are a number of entry points for buses. The most common method is the air-conditioned buses from [[Kolkata]] to Dhaka, via the [[Haridaspur]]/[[Benapole]] border crossing. The private bus companies listed above also run cross-border services from India. Public buses run under the label of the state-owned West Bengal Surface Transport Service Corporation (WBSTSC) and the [http://brtc.gov.bd/ '''Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation'''] (BRTC). WBSTSC and BRTC both operate buses from Kolkata every Tu, Th and Sa at 05:30, 08:30, 12:30, while from Dhaka they leave M, W and F at 07:00 and 07:30. The normal journey time is around 12 hours, with a one-way fare of INR800 (non air-con) & INR1400(air-con) or BDT600-800 (roughly USD12-20). The journey just to the Indian border town of [[Haridaspur]] will take 2 and a half hours, with a fare of approximately INR86, or BDT116.

There are no travel options from Myanmar, as the border is closed.

===By car===
It is possible to cross from India via private vehicle. There are many border crossings, but the most popular is the one at [[Haridaspur]]/[[Benapole]], located on the highway between Dhaka and Kolkata. Visa formalities take a notoriously long time.

The border with Myanmar is closed and heavily militarised with land mines.

===By water===
Most ferries arrive at and leave from the port in '''Sadarghat''' of Old Dhaka. This area and the streets surrounding it are unbelievably hectic, so allow plenty of time and keep an eye on your valuables. If arriving at the port, fight your way to the left on the frontage road and then make your first right; this turns into Nawabpur Road and leads north to the hotels. Even if you aren't staying in this area, it's easier to walk several hundred meters north to catch an onward rickshaw or taxi; the ones near the port are at a constant standstill.

The '''Rocket Steamers''' (named P.S. 'Tern', 'Masud' and 'Ostrich') depart to [[Barisal]] and [[Khulna]] several times per week, leaving from Sadarghat around 6pm. To Barisal is Tk 480 and Tk 300 in first and second class respectively, while the ride to Khulna will run Tk 1010 for first class and Tk 610 for second. The Khulna trip takes 26-30 hours. Tickets should be booked at the [http://biwtc.gov.bd/notice.php/ BIWTC] office in Motijheel, just east of Dilkusha Circle I. It's open until 5PM Sunday to Wednesday, until 2PM on Thursdays and closed on Fridays.

[[Chandpur]] is a second major river station, located 3-4 hours from Dhaka and 5-6 hours from Barisal.

Numerous other boats are available for short and long distances. Head to Sadarghat or Badamtoli ghat (about 1 km further west) and ask around. Tickets cannot be pre-booked and bargaining is likely necessary.

==Get around==
[[Image:Dhaka.jpg|thumb|right|Old Dhaka]]
Well...Dhaka has wide range of transport systems from cycle-rickshaws to buses to water buses. A public transport system is existent which is on a reformation process. However, Dhaka suffers from choking traffic which causes extensive travel time.
[[Image:Rickshaws.jpg|thumb|Rickshaws, Old Dhaka]]

=== By cycle rickshaw ===
Cycle rickshaws or simply, rickshaws, are the most popular form of transport, and good for short distances, mainly on side streets. They make up the bulk of the city's horrendous traffic, and charge around Tk 30 to 50 for a 15 minutes ride in Banani, Baridhara or Gulshan - less in other parts of Dhaka. Negotiating a fare beforehand is essential as a foreigner. Rickshaws are not allowed to cross most of the main roads. If you're a woman, it's particularly inadvisable to ride around alone in rickshaws after dark; you're a slow-moving target, vulnerable to trouble from thugs and muggers.

=== By auto-rickshaw ===
Auto-rickshaws, locally known as 'CNGs' (named after compressed natural gas, their fuel source) are abundant and have meters, which drivers can sometimes be persuaded to use. They're the cheapest way to cover longer distances; an 8&nbsp;km ride from Old Dhaka to Gulshan should cost around Tk 150-250. The meters start at Tk 25 for the first 2 km and Tk 7 for each subsequent km, but you'll likely have to negotiate a fare instead. The city becomes very congested at times, so allow plenty of time for getting around.

Given the plethora of all forms of transport, if you're having trouble getting a decent fare with a driver walk a few feet to the next one. Not all are out to gouge you, so better to find the honest ones and give them your business. Occasionally a driver will demand more money on arrival; the best way to deal with this is to hand over the agreed or metered fare and walk away. Make certain from the start that the driver knows where you're headed, unless you can direct him yourself, as they often have limited local knowledge, but will always say that they know where somewhere is, and take you 'round the whole city searching whilst the meter ticks. Take a card with your hotel or hostel written on it so that you can actually get home. Having a card for the hotel with the address makes this a lot easier.

===By taxi===
Taxis are hard to hire from streets so you will need to book one. There are a few types taxis, some yellow and some black, some white, all with meters. Black taxis start the meter at Tk 25 but usually you have to negotiate about the fare. A ride between Old Dhaka and Gulshan in a black cab will probably cost you around Tk 250-350. Yellow taxis have slightly higher standards in terms of comfort but are more expensive and will probably cost you Tk 500. Black and white taxis are typically in notoriously poor condition and lack air conditioning. Yellow taxis are required to have air conditioning; the fleet consists mostly of Toyota Corollas, with some Mitsubishis and Hondas. But if you are a foreigner, a CNG is in many cases the better option because in a car, you are clearly visible as a foreign passenger which will in many cases attract many beggars and street vendors.

=== By bus ===
Buses run routes on the main roads, but are often horribly crowded and noisy, signed only in Bengali and aren't likely to be of much use to travelers. But there are some buses which only take passengers if seats are available (at least in theory, but compared to the other buses they are usually not very crowded) and you have to buy a ticket at one of the bus counters in advance. During the rush hour, it can be difficult to get a seat and maybe you will have to wait in line with the other passengers. But taking the bus is cheap and once you found out which bus you have to take and where you have to get off, it is possible without speaking any Bengali. But going by bus takes usually more time than going by CNG and buses are also frequently involved in collisions. Save yourself a headache and take a rickshaw or CNG, or for long distances, a comfortable, air-conditioned bus or train.
For more info on buses in Bangladesh, see the Get in section.

=== By car ===
Driving a car in the capital can be a nerve wrecking experience. Officially, cars drive on the left, although the reality can be different. Locals will often zoom down the wrong side of the road in an attempt to overcome the traffic. Traffic police monitor most intersections in the city, in an attempt to keep the traffic flowing. Many intersections have been upgraded with traffic signals, but these are often ignored by both drivers and traffic police, who will direct cars as they see fit.

There are some options for car rental, with Europcar [http://www.europcar.com/car-BANGLADESH.html] being the notable Western brand name. The Government's Virtual Bangladesh website [http://www.virtualbangladesh.com/rentacar.html] has more options. Many companies may also offer the option to rent-a-driver for a number of days; it is common for most middle to upper-class locals to have their own drivers.

If you plan to do a lot of sightseeing in one day, and don't want to deal with the CNGs, hiring a car and driver is by far the most pleasant way to get around.  Rates start at around Tk 2500 per day in an A/C car.

=== By bike ===
Many locals often use bicycles as a primary form of transport. They can be useful in their ability to squeeze through tight situations, where traffic may prevent a larger vehicle from moving at all. Some newer roads in the capital have dual bike/rickshaw lanes. Unfortunately, there are few formal opportunities to rent a bike and the roads are in such bad condition, but with heavy traffic, that the chance of a collision is high.

=== By train ===
The trains in Bangladesh only operate between major regional cities. There is no suburban or metro rail system in Dhaka, although there are plans to build an elevated inner-city line by 2019. Due to this lack, city can become gridlocked for a number of hours.

=== By foot ===
Sometimes, walking may actually be the fastest way to get from point A to B. Always ensure you walk on the footpath, or if one isn't available, as far to the side of the road as possible. The road is a dangerous place in Dhaka, and many pedestrians are often injured by passive drivers. Those who are squeamish to pollution or have asthma may need to wear a mask; the air pollution from passing trucks and buses, combined with the searing heat and humidity can be overwhelming at times.

[[Image:Bashundhara city.JPG|right|thumb|Bashundhara City]]
Dhaka has some of the largest shopping malls in the world with Basundhara City and Jamuna Future Park being the most prominent ones. There are numerous mid size malls in every neighborhood of the city. If you go shopping in the street bazaars and markets, ready to bargain then there are certainly bargains to be had among the bazars and markets of Dhaka. To get a feel for what things should cost in the local markets check prices in the western-style fixed price shops and then deduct 10%. If you prefer hassle free shopping then head to Bashundhara City, a huge shopping centre with more modern shops and other ameniteis you would expect to find in a mall.

*'''Banga (or Bango) Bazar''', is a block west of the Gulistan bus station on Kamruzzaman Sharani Street at the edge of Old Dhaka. For shopaholics this is probably a paradise but for others it can be a nightmare. There are thousands of small stalls intersected by narrow walkways which are often jammed with people. The quality varies widely but the prices can be cheap, cheap, cheap, after you bargain vigorously. Try US$1 for a T-shirt, US$3 for blue jeans and US$5 for jackets. However, this is not a market for the brand conscious.

*'''New Market''' on Mirpur Road in Dhanmondi, just west of Dhaka University. This is the largest market in the city and it has more class, more room and just as much choice. Prices may be a little higher because the stall rent is likely to be more expensive. As well as clothing, there is leather, linen, jewellery, household goods, CDs and DVDs and so on. It is normally closed on Tuesdays. 

*'''Bashundhara City''' on Pantha Path just west of the Pan Pacific Hotel. This multi-story complex is the closest replica of the malls found in Asia. It is the newest and most modern place to shop in the city with small shops spanning over a whopping 10 floors. 

* <buy name="Garment seconds" alt="" address="Banga Bazar and Pallwell Market" directions="BB: Gulistan area, just West of Motijheel); PM: Purana Paltan area (just beside Jonaki Cinema Hall" phone="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">Many items only have minor defects, but do not meet export requirements.</buy>

* <buy name="Pink Pearls" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="">Available in many handicraft stores, with some dedicated outlets in Gulshan. There you can also design your own jewellery, but stores demand usually 4 to 5 times higher prices from foreigners, so better to discuss about the price with a local first.</buy>

* <buy name="Aarong" address="" phone="" email="" fax="" hours="" price="" url="http://brac-aarong.com">A well known chain with several outlets around Dhaka and one in London. It is owned by BRAC (the largest development organisation in the world) and sells handicrafts and clothing at moderately high prices.</buy>

*<buy name="Jamuna Future Park" alt="" address="Near Bashundra, Just ask for Jamuna Future Park" directions="" phone="" url="" hours="regular shopping hours" price="Fairly normal, depending on the brand" lat="" long="">The newest and most modern of the shopping malls here with several 3D theaters, a good amount of brand stores, an extensive food court, a bowling alley, as well as a rather large outdoor amusement park. A must go for shopping and/or a day out. Relatively new so most floors are unoccupied and sparsely populated. An alternative to Bashundhara City but would advise going to the latter if shopping, but for more practical activities, this is recommended.</buy>

Here you will find some modern food corners, which attract numbers of young people who come here to chat.</buy>

Dhaka has an enormous variety of food catering to all budgets. Old Dhaka is overflowing with cheap Bangladeshi food where a meal can be had from Tk 50 ($0.70), while in the upscale areas such ad Gulshan and Banani you can find just about any type of cuisine you can imagine - Chinese, Indian, Thai, Vietnamese, Greek, Mexican and franchises such as Pizza Hut, KFC are abundant. Reservations are usually not required in most restaurants. A lot of the buffet-style restaurants in this neighbourhood have Taka: 250 to 400, fixed price menu. For vegetarians, and especially Hindus, beef-free restaurants can be a bit difficult to find, but there are few Indian restaurants where one can get vegetarian food in a beef-free environment.

Local sweets (misti/mishti) like ''rasogollah'' and ''golap jam/pantuya/ledikeni'' are excellent. To the uninitiated these are bite-sized soft milk curd balls dipped (drenched) in syrup, coming in white and red varieties. Shops throughout the town (and especially near Gulshan) sell imported condiments from the U.S., Dubai and Malaysia at a premium. Imported chocolate is especially expensive - and usually not in the best condition as it gets melted and re-solidified daily in the tropical heat. Fresh is better.

Be careful when buying food from street vendors as health and hygiene standards are not always top notch. Unlike Bangkok -- street food in Dhaka is only for locals. Foreigners should stick to larger, organized, and unfortunately a little expensive, food outlets.

===Old and Central Dhaka===
Restaurants are crammed throughout the narrow alleys and along the main streets, and you'll likely not to be too disappointed by them. A full meal will usually run less than the equivalent of one US dollar, although fish will push it closer to two.

* <eat name="Hotel Al-Razzaque" alt="" address="29/1 North South Rd (Nazira Bazaar)" directions="" phone="+880 2 956 1990" url="" hours="" price="Tk50-150" lat="" long="">On the ground floor of the hotel is a large and popular restaurant, busy anytime of the day with Bangladeshi families and businessmen. Food is pretty darn good, if unpredictable in its timing. Sometimes you'll have a choice of chicken and mutton curries, fish and vegetables, other times it's chicken biryani or the highway. Fish will double the price of your meal, at least. It's sandwiched between a clean and well-stocked juice bar and a clean and well-stocked sweet shop. Each plate cost 80 Taka.</eat> 
*'''Hajjee Beryani'''in Nazira Bazar, close to Bango Bazar, old Dhaka. Old Dhaka was famed for its lines of beryani restaurants. Some of the more famous outfits are still going and Hajjee Beryani is one of them. It revels in its eccentric reputation for opening only at certain times and only cooking a certain amount (well below demand)

==Drink==

===Alcohol===
There is a party network between the different ex-pat clubs (Dutch Club, Canadian Club, Nordic Club, International Club, American Club, etc.) and some Bangladeshi clubs (Heritage, Privilege, etc.).  These clubs usually require membership to enter, or befriend a member and have them sign you in. From there, you can purchase a book of tickets or a cash card and then use it to order your drinks.  

Although alcohol is most easily available at the international clubs and top hotels, there are quite a few local places to find a drink for the enterprising traveler. Local bars are to be found in most neighborhoods but can be difficult to locate due to a lack of advertising. Popular brands of beer (Heineken, Carlsberg, Tuborg, Foster's, etc) and major types of liquor are available at these places, and at a much lower price than at hotel bars. 

You can try:
*<drink name="H. Kabir & Co., Ltd." alt="The duty paid shop in Mohakhali" address="12 Abbas Garden, New Airport Road" directions="go towards the flyover as if you were going to Banani, but instead of going on to the flyover, you take the second left after it begins. You will see a small sign labeled "Abbas Garden." Turn left and tell your transport to wait while you purchase" phone="+880 2-988 1936-9" url=" hours=" Su-Th 09:30-16:30" price=" lat=" long="">This off-license is only permitted to sell alcohol to passport-bearing foreigners or their drivers who bring their passports in when they purchase.</drink>
*'''La Diplomat''' at Road 20, House number 7, near  Gulshan 1. Don't expect to be rubbing shoulders with any French ambassadors, however.   
*'''The Dip''', like most other Bengali bars, is a smoke-filled darkened room where many of its patrons would rather not be recognized too easily. Definitely an experience, nonetheless. Beers cost upwards of Tk 150 and "tots," which are single ounce servings of gin, vodka or whiskey, are available from Tk 70(local brands)-Tk 200. Female patrons may feel slightly uncomfortable.

===Budget===

It is important to be careful to plan accordingly when arriving in Dhaka, as unlike India and Nepal, there is very little tourist infrastructure, and it can be difficult to find a decent hotel simply on a whim. Some places will say 'Hotel' and only be a place to eat, while most of the really cheap hotels, especially in and around the Old City, are residents only, which means they will not rent rooms to foreigners.

==Stay safe==
Dhaka isn't terribly unsafe, but it is not a safe city either. As in any huge city you should keep aware of your surroundings and try not to walk around at night, especially females travelling alone. There's a very large number of people living on next to nothing in the city, and while the vast majority are friendly there's undoubtedly a few that would love to help you part with some of your seemingly abundant wealth.

As a foreigner, many beggars will surround you in Gulshan and Banani. Especially children who will try to sell stickers and, if you are not interested in their items, will ask for money or food and offer you to buy some expensive items in one of the supermarkets or small stores. But before giving something to them, consider that by giving money or buying expensive items, which they will probably resell, that in many cases these children are trained or forced to beg and have to give all the money or items to the person who organises them. So be aware of this and the fact that your gesture of goodwill will maybe support these structures and exploitation. Be careful when you see a group of Intersex people known as Hijras or subscription askers. Usually they are rare in Bangladesh, but they may be aggressive if you refuse to give them money.

There has been a recent rash of incidents in which some foreigners have been targeted for bag snatchings while riding rickshaws. Often these have occurred at night, after 23:00. If you must be out after this time please do your best to leave your valuables at your friends' places or hotel and you can pick them up in the morning. The simplest way to reduce your potential loss is to not leave with valuables in the first place if you anticipate the need to travel after 23:00. The safest mode for travel for a tourist is to hire a yellow cab. These can be rented for a trip as well as by the day. Be sure to write down the license plate number.

The greatest danger probably comes from speeding buses, rickshaws and lagunas (small passenger carriers) - keep well alert when walking along main roads especially around the Bakshi Bazar signal area.

Being the capital, it's the area most affected during ''hartals'', and you should do your best to keep a low profile during times of political unrest. Avoid ''any'' sort of large gatherings, even positive ones, as there's a good chance you'll become the centre of attention and you probably don't want that from a group of raucous chanters.

Pollution is, compared to other countries in the subcontinent, not very high because most vehicles are run by gas. But dust can be a problem, especially during winter when rain is rare. It's not uncommon to see people with face masks on, and at the very least you should carry a handkerchief with you to cover your mouth and nose during rickshaw rides.

Some places such as Mohammadpur are hot spots for drugs, narcotics, etc. Don't answer to the people along the streets.

==Contact==
'''Internet''' Wi-Fi is now widely available in all the mid-to-high range hotels, coffee shops and restaurants all over Dhaka and its suburbs. You won't see too many internet cafes in Dhaka because the use of Wi-Fi & 4G is widespread. Internet cafes hidden in the various shopping complexes - ask around. Tk 20-30 per hour, but be careful, anti-virus programms are not widely used. So think twice before tipping any sensitive data on a public computer or in a cyber cafe. You can also purchase a local SIM card and get 4G Internet on your device.  For example from Banglalink, Grameenphone , Robi, Airtel. Wimax is also available from providers like banglalion,qubee with good coverage. You can get both prepaid and postpaid connection. 


'''Post''' There are many Post Offices in every area. Working hours are 09:30 to 14:30. Some big Post offices also have evening shifts from 15:00 to 19:00. Bangladesh Post is pretty good. The cost of sending a letter is very reasonable. The main Post Office (Dhaka G.P.O) is situated at Paltan, near to Gulistan and is open from 09:00 to 19:30. You can send Registered and normal letters, Parcel, E.M.S(Express Mail Service) from there at a reasonable price. It's better to send a parcel via E.M.S because it goes faster.

=== Sonargaon ===
If you feel the need to escape and take a break from the chaos of Dhaka, Songargon, about 29 km. from Dhaka offers you the chance to do just that. The town has a few worthwhile sights that are separated from one another and whilst going from sight to sight, you have the opportunity experience rural life and take in the less chaotic surroundings.

Sonargaon is one of the oldest capitals of Bengal. It was the seat of Deva Dynasty until the 13th century. From then onward till the advent of the Mughals, Sonargaon was a subsidiary capital of the Sultanate of Bengal. The main places of interest in Sonargaon are the ruins of Panam Nagar, the local crafts museum or the Lok Shilpa Jadughar (charges an entrance fee), the tomb of Sultan Ghiyasuddin, the Goaldi Mosque, and the shrines of Panjpir and Shah Abdul Alia. The first two lie on one side of the Dhaka-Chittgong Highway and the rest lie on the other side. Once at Mograpara, a rickshaw may be hired for sightseeing. It is best to hire the same rickshaw for a fixed amount (BDT 200-250) to visit all the places in Sonargaon. Most rickshaw pullers know the more popular destinations like Panam Nagar, the Lok Shilpa Jadughar, etc. Some may not know of the tomb of Sultan Ghiyasuddin or the Goaldi Mosque and the shrines. Usually rickshaw drivers who are locals from the village know all of these places.

Frequent bus services to Sonargaon operate from Gulistan, Saidabad and other bus stands in Dhaka. Tickets may be bought on roadside counters. Mention your destination as Mograpara as you might end up at the Pan Pacific Sonargaon Hotel instead. The price of the ticket from Gulistan bus stand is Tk 35.

Hajiganj is another place of historical interest, situated about 10 kms from Mograpara bus stand. However, the above mentioned places usually take up most of the day and it is best to return to Dhaka before evening. Sonargaon and Hajiganj may be combined into a single day if one sets off very early from Dhaka.
