'''Minot''' [http://web.ci.minot.nd.us/] is a city in [[Ward County (North Dakota)| Ward County]], in north central [[North Dakota]] with about 40,888 people in 2010 Census.  Known as the '''Magic City''', it's a significant rail hub (for freight, anyway).  However, its location deep within [[North America]] and off the Interstate System generally means you don't see Minot if you don't plan on it.


==Understand==
[[image:Minotwide.jpg|thumb|300px|A view of Minot, looking South]]
The Souris River goes through the middle of town, carving a valley in the middle of flat prairie.  The town arose in 1880s as a stop along the Great Northern railway.  During Prohibition the city became a nexus for alcohol smuggling.  After World War II the city settled down into quiet suburbanation.  There's a US Air Force base north of town.  You can drive to [[Canada]] in just over an hour.

Minot is a rather unusual city, though possessing levels of services similar to much larger cities, it struggles between small-town and cosmopolitan attitudes.  Civic growth is not greatly helped by the climate.  T-shirts available at the airport have this motto: "Why not Minot? Freezin's the reason!" However, it should be noted that while North Dakota is typically associated with a cold climate, the weather actually has its extremes, and Minot reaches temperatures of 90s (sometimes even 100s) in the summer months.

The major routes through the city are US 2 (east-west), US 83 (north-south), and US 52 (northwest-southeast).  US 2 intersects with Interstate 29 in [[Grand Forks]], US 83 intersects with Interstate 94 in [[Bismarck]], and US 52 intersects with Interstate 94 in [[Jamestown (North Dakota)|Jamestown]].

==Stay safe==
There is little crime in Minot. Most residents do lock their doors, but in wintertime many people leave their cars running in parking lots as they run their errands.

Probably the most significant danger comes from city traffic.  Pedestrians should yield to oncoming traffic -- most people will not stop to let you by, even at crosswalks.  Also, drunk and exhibition driving is a risk late on weekends.  Stay alert on the roads at those times.

==Contact==
