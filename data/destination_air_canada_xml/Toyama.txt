'''Toyama City''' (富山市) [http://www.city.toyama.toyama.jp/] is the capital of [[Toyama (prefecture)|Toyama prefecture]], [[Japan]].


==Understand==

The chance to experience the ancient Edo streets of Kanazawa via the new Hokuriku Shinkansen will surely draw many to the long-neglected west coast of Japan. But those who travel this way on a clear day will no doubt feel spendor as they pass by the sight of the massive Japan Alps towering over a cityscape that thins out into the distance. A few may feel that irresistable draw of going further off the beaten path, wondering what secrets are hiding in those distant settlements and mountain peaks. For those craving such adventure, a stop in Toyama is a good place to get started while maybe enjoying another detour or two along the way.       

Known for its chemical and pharmacutical industries since the Meiji era and beyond, 99.5% of Toyama was obliterated in the firebombing raids of the second world war. Rather than fall into decay, however, these strong industries, combined with the promise brought by the opening of the shinkansen, have helped Toyama to rise above the ashes. Designed to be a "compact city", Toyama has seen large development in transportation, living, recreation and shopping facilities in recent years, perfectly suited for its population of half a million. You won't find all of the conveniences of some of the larger modern Japanese cities, but those who visit can enjoy some nearby comforts without having to travel very far. 

While the city proper offers a few interesting attractions within its center, many of Toyama's sightseeing and hiking opportunities are scattered throughout the several surrounding towns it administers, as well as in the dense mountains to the south. Thus, for many visitors, Toyama serves as a hub to reach these surrounding areas.

==Get in==

===By plane===

Toyama has its own airport, from which buses run to the city center (25 min, &yen;400). Toyama Kitokito Airport has international flights to Shanghai, Seoul, Vladivostok, and Dalian and local service to Tokyo, Sapporo, and Fukuoka. However, flight schedules change heavily with the season so it would be worth checking out in advance what is available for when you will be traveling. With the recent start of the Hokuriku Shinkansen and relative inaccessabilty except by car or bus, the burden is on Toyama airport to keep customers. When travelling to Toyama on a budget, be sure to check flight prices to see if you can't get a cheaper deal over the Shinkansen.

===By train===
<!-- Entry changed to reflect the opening of the Hokuriku Shinkansen-->

From [[Tokyo]] Station, Toyama can be reached in just over two hours by taking the ''Kagayaki'' service on the recently opened Hokuriku Shinkansen line. At approximately 310 km, a one-way trip regularly costs ￥12,730 for a reserved seat, ￥17,360 for ''Green Class'', or ￥25,580 for a "Gran Class" seat, though JR Rail Pass holders pay no extra costs for a basic reserved seat, though the use of Gran Class requires the payments of the Shinkansen express charge and Gran Class surcharge. The first train departs Tokyo Station at 6:16 a.m. and the last leaves at 9:04 p.m.. If you're a fan of scenic travel, be sure to stay awake through the last leg of the trip after the long strech of tunnels from Itoigawa Station. The view of the towering the Tateyama mountain range on a clear day is spectacular.

Frequent ''Thunderbird'' (サンダーバード) limited express trains run to Toyama from [[Osaka]] and [[Kyoto]] in Kansai, and will take you as far as Kanazawa, where you'll need to transfer to the Hokuriku Shinkansen. From there, ''Kagayaki'' trains are the most direct, whereas ''Hakutaka'' and ''Tsurugi'' trains will stop at ''ShinTakaoka Station'' along the way. The full trip will take at least three hours - not including transfer time - and costs ￥9430 one-way with reserved seats (free for JR Rail Pass holders). If you need to save a little money and time isn't an issue, an unreserved seat and a transfer to the ''IR Ishikawa Railway'' at Kanazawa will save you a marginal amount at ￥8350.

Toyama is also a morning stop on the ''Twilight Express'' (トワイライトエクスプレス) overnight train from [[Sapporo]], and ''Nihonkai'' (日本海) overnight train from [[Aomori]].

===By bus===

Seibu runs three daily buses (one of which is overnight) to Toyama from [[Tokyo/Ikebukuro|Ikebukuro]] and the Sunshine City Prince Hotel. It costs &yen;7340 one-way (&yen;13210 round-trip) and takes seven hours to make the journey.

Several companies have bus runs from Osaka and Kyoto to Toyama. West JR Bus has a morning run (5 1/2 hours) and an overnight run (8 hours) from JR Osaka station, while Hankyu has an evening run (5 hours) and an overnight run (7 3/4 hours) from Umeda. The one-way cost for these lines is roughly &yen;5200 from Osaka and &yen;4800 from Kyoto.

===By boat===

There are regular services roughly once per week to [[Vladivostok]], [[Russia]]. 
Contact EURAS [http://www.euras.co.jp/en/] to arrange your tickets.  Fares start from ¥25,200 ($235) one-way.

===Budget===

*'''LOTTERIA''' (ロッテリア) - Toyama Chiho Testsudo Station. One of Japan's original fast-food burger joints. The food is a tad pricey for the portion size, though not outside the norm for Japan. Located in the small Esta complex in front of the ticket gate of Toyama Chiho Testsudo Station.

*'''Airport Kitchen''' (エアポートキッチン)4-5-11, Sougawa, tel: 076-461-4726 12:00-11PM. Closed Mondays.

The most popular area for nightlife for foreigners is around Toyama station, and home to Toyama's only major nightclub, Club Mairo [http://mairo.com/mairo/] (Japanese Language), as well as My Pleasure Karaoke(歌んだ村） Also just south of the station is a building named 'Twenty One', which is home to many small, friendly bars, most of which offer karaoke and nomihodai. Some charge a cover, others do not.

Just around the corner from My Pleasure and down the street from the Lawsons convenience store you'll come across the Irish pub Pot Still which has a sign (an image of a traditional Irish distilling apparatus) remotely resembling a pile of crap. Grab a pint of Guiness and Bass to go with a plate of the best fish and chips in town. Pot Still has darts and pool and a very foreigner friendly environment.

For a more relaxed bar/club, try Beeline in an alley off the Chuodori end of Sogawa. This area is also home to a few bars and Izakaya. Just opposite and south of Daiwa, the quirky De Niro lies in an alley.

Right across from Beeline is a restaurant called Pepin.  Good food and service with and English menu.  Food is smaller portioned and presented but is still a casual relaxed dining atmosphere.  Generally, modern music plays low in the background and a small counter/bar for those dining alone or just like a drink.

==Get out==
<!--The ''yama'' is removed here because it is redundant-->
<!--That is incorrect, Tateyama is the name of the mountain despite the meaning of Yama. It is like saying Boston should be called Bos because ton refers to it being a town. The official name of the mountain is Mt. Tateyama according to the prefecture-->
<!--Changed title back to Mount Tate to link up with the entry of the same name. Use of Mount Tateyama in official tourism materials seems rare and inconsistent.-->
* '''[[Mount Tate]]''' (''Tateyama'') &mdash; One of Japan's best-known mountains and one of the highest peaks in the area can be climbed in a challenging day-trip.
