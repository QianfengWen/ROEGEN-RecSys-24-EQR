'''Harbin''' (哈尔滨; Hā'ěrbīn) (sometimes seen as Ha'rbin or Haerbin)[http://www.harbin.gov.cn/english/index.php] is the capital of [[Heilongjiang]] Province in [[Northeast China]]. Harbin hosts the [[Harbin Ice Festival]] each winter.

==Understand==
Harbin is China's northernmost major city, with a metropolitan population in excess of 10 million, and over 4 million in the city center alone.  Historically, the city has been influenced a lot by neighboring [[Russia]], in particular after the Russian Revolution of 
1917 when the White Russians escaped the newly formed Soviet Union. The influence remains clearly visible in the building styles and foods. 
[[Image:Ice_city.jpg|thumb|350px|Harbin International Snow and Ice Festival]]
The city was founded in 1897 as a camp for Russian engineers surveying the Trans-Siberian Railway. Labor demands brought in a collection of outcasts from across Russia, [[Poland]] and even from within Manchuria. The city eventually was captured by the Japanese during World War II and later returned to China in 1946. Once nothing more than a Russian-built outpost of the railway line, Harbin has expanded far beyond its original limits. 

===Recent History===
Northeastern China was originally built up as an industrial center using pre-existing Soviet and Japanese factories. By the 1980s these outdated and inefficient factories could not keep up. To further complicate matters, starting in the early 1990s, large portions of China's state-owned enterprise workers were laid off. Thus, like many other cities in the region, contemporary Harbin is struggling with an aging work force and unemployment. Private enterprise is mostly centered in the service sector, retail, and restaurants, with most large scale enterprises still state owned. However, the province has thousands of state-owned enterprises up for sale, and many have been purchased since the late 1990s. Numerous universities in Harbin also play a vital role in the economy in education and research and through their subsidiary companies.  

In 2005 there was a major pollution spill on the Songhua river.

Harbin is infamous for its very cold winters. It has a continental climate with winter temperatures as low as −38°C (−36°F) have been recorded, though in January daytime temperatures average −12°C (10°F). Bring more clothes than you will think you will need so that you can layer. Winter can become dreary if you are a long-term resident, as the entire city uses coal for heat; air quality rapidly decreases during these months.

Harbin can be a great place to visit in the summer, with daytime temperatures normally in the upper 20s°C. Compared with most places in China, the weather is cool and it seems to be perpetually breezy, and most of the city's streets are lined with trees. Because the city is so cold all winter, life almost explodes and people crowd the streets until late at night eating kabobs, playing poker, and drinking Harbin Beer (哈啤 ''Hapi''). It can prove a great escape from the heat that is common in most other parts of the country. A trip up to the border regions this time of year would be nice as well.

==Get in==

===By plane===
'''Harbin Airport''' ({{IATA|HRB}}) has services to more than a dozen domestic destinations.

International services are available to [[Khabarovsk]] and [[Vladivostok]], [[Russia]], [[Niigata]], [[Japan]], [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]] and [[Los Angeles]], [[USA]].  

The airport is located about a 45-minute drive outside of the city. If you are flying out of Harbin most ticket agencies can arrange transportation to be included in the cost of the ticket. Another option is to take a taxi, which costs around ¥100-120. Always negotiate this price before the ride, though. Drivers will make their meters read more for the ride otherwise or try to get you to pay for the highway ticket in addition. Ask the taxi driver for invoices and take down the car number if necessary. It is safe to take a taxi with official certification at the airport.

There is also a bus service [http://www.hljairport.com/jichang_english/bus.asp] to downtown Harbin and the rail station. Tickets cost ¥20.

The airport is small, but there is a small restaurant and snack bar selling local delicacies, Chinese and western food, and a nearby hotel if you happen to get stranded.

[http://www.westland-cpa.com/taxi.png Fake Black taxis (scam)] recently have been lining at Harbin Airport taxi stands, alongside the legitimate Yellow Taxis. These are not really taxi’s, but rather are cars rented out by a Shanghainese company.  They are distinguished by a generic roof sign “泰克斯” (Tàikè sī = Taxi) and non-working telephone numbers on the doors of the taxi.  Drivers typically display no personal or license identification, and passengers have little recourse if they fall into their scam.   Black Taxi drivers will take their passengers outside of the airport, and then stop the car in the countryside to demand an advance payment (200 to 1000 RMB) before proceeding.  There have been reports of drivers injuring tourists, so best to stay clear of these. 

===By train ===
[[Image:29402129 44598547a9 o.jpg|thumb|250px|Train Station ]]
Taking a train to Harbin is very easy and several are overnight trains. Different ways to travel include chair, "hard", "soft" or "deluxe" berths.  Hard berth compartments generally have six sleeping bunks which open onto the main passageway going through the car; soft berth usually has a four person compartment, softer mattresses, and a compartment door you can close.  

The main station is located at Tielu Jie, between Nangang and Daoli districts. When leaving the train, make sure to keep your ticket stub as you need it to exit the train station. 

When you get out of the train station there are literally dozens of taxis waiting.  Make sure to take a cab that is in the official waiting line and have them turn their meter on.  In some cases these drivers have been waiting all day here and want to get as much money as they can.  

There are several hotels right around the square in front of the station and most are fairly cheap.  There is also a KFC and a Russian restaurant (open 24 hours) called Breznev that has decent food.

There is also some smaller train stations in the city, like Harbin East and others.

Harbin West Station (or Harbinxi) provides with high speed trains to Beijing. Beware that your ticket may be from this station rather than the main station in town.  Harbin's metro system recently opened, but this does not connect with Harbin West station: - Harbin West station is not expected to be included on the metro network until line three is complete (expected in 2017).

===By car===
Harbin is connected to the rest of China via the China Highway 102 via Changchun. Harbin is also connected via road to [[Inner Mongolia]], [[Russia]], and [[Jilin]].

===By bus===
The main long-distance bus station (Changtu Keyun Zhan) is located across the square from main train station.

The majority of cities in Heilongjiang can be reached via bus. 
* '''Beijing''' - takes about 18 hours
* '''Mudanjiang''' - takes about 4 hours. Frequent departures.
* '''Qiqihar''' - takes about 5 hours
* '''Changchun''' - takes about 4 hours
* '''Jilin''' - takes about 6 hours
* '''Dalian''' - takes about 10 hrs
* '''Shenyang''' - takes about 8 hours
* '''Wudailanchi''' - takes about 6 hours
* '''Yanji''' - takes about 9 hrs


'''Traveling to Russia'''
* '''Vladivostok, Russia''' - takes about 12 hrs
One daily departure which leaves early in the morning. Buy tickets in the Russian travel agency on the second floor of the bus station. The price is basically the same as going through Mudanjiang/Suifenhe on your own.

Given that you have all your papers sorted the border crossing is straightforward. Guard(s) on the Chinese side speak fluent English and might be curious of non-Russian/Chinese passports. You are required to take all your items with you when crossing the border, do not leave bags on the bus.

Bus leaves Around 07:10. Can buy tickets the morning of, ¥500 (Sep 2012). Ask the person weighing baggage for a ticket.

==Get around==
[[Image:Harbin Taxi.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Taxis in Harbin]]

Taxis are inexpensive and convenient. However, always ask them to run the meter (请打表 ''qĭng dă biăo'') instead of attempting to negotiate a price in order avoid possible conflicts.

Taxi drivers in Harbin are known to be reckless&mdash;running red lights, driving into oncoming traffic, etc.&mdash;so buckle up! Most taxi drivers do not speak ''any'' English or read Pinyin, so unless you speak fluent Mandarin Chinese showing them the Chinese characters for your destination is often the only option that will work. Do not be surprised if the taxi stops to pick up other passengers during rush hour, and if you are picked up by a taxi with passengers, even if the meter reads Y13 when you get in, the taxi driver will still expect you to pay the full amount on the meter when you depart the taxi!

As noted earlier, avoid the [http://www.westland-cpa.com/taxi.png Fake Black taxis (scam)] as these are not really taxi’s, but rather are cars rented out by a Shanghainese company.  They are distinguished by a generic roof sign “泰克斯” (Tàikè sī = Taxi) and non-working telephone numbers on the doors of the taxi.  

If you plan to live in Harbin for a while, it's recommended that you figure out the basic bus routes around your home.  Note that during the winter months the buses stop running earlier. Hawkers on the street will sell a map of greater Harbin including bus routes for about ¥5. Buses cost ¥1.

Most of them are built in baroque or byzantine style with spires and cupolas and interesting shades of yellow, white, green, or red.  While St. Sophia is known as the main architectural attraction to the city, areas of the city such as Harbin's old quarter are made up of buildings that have been left untouched since the Russians left.  While most of these streets are fairly decrepit and in need of repair, at least the area has been free from the wrecking ball like many other historical districts in China. Only due to the fact that Harbin has yet to attract the world's investment.</see>

The 1.4-km long street is a veritable museum of European architectural styles, including Baroque and Byzantine facades, Jewish architectural wonders, a Russian restauraunt, French fashion houses (Fake Chinese Brands), American snack food outlets (McDonald's and KFC and a Chinese owned "American Bar"), and a Japanese restaurant. In winter, one can walk out onto the ice or take a dog sledge or horse sledge ride. It is the prettiest site in Harbin as far as the city itself is concerned, however, if you go mid-day during the weekend be prepared to push through the crowds.</see>

If you want to go by bus instead of taking a taxi, take the 88 line (facing the train station, walk into the small street on your left for 300 m before seeing the bus stop) to Shangye Daxue 商业大学. It should take about 30 minutes, and it is the third stop after the long stretch of highway crossing the river. Then, take the 54 bus towards the same direction, and you will see the entrance to the Tiger Park on your right after 5 minutes or so (Bus 54 didn't function in Dec 2013). 
Alternatively you can take the 88 line to the last stop, go straight and on the first crossroad go right for about 5 minutes. Another route is to taking Bus 29 at the north end of Zhaolin Da Jie city bus terminal for 2 RMB.

==Work==
For foreigners, pretty much the only employment is [[teaching English]], where depending on your qualifications and experience, you can make anywhere from ¥2,000 to ¥15,000 a month.  There are positions at both public and private schools.  If you are in the city and don't already have employment, check out the bulletin board at Hamama's Kofi House

==Learn== 	
[[Image:HIT.jpg|thumb|250px|Harbin's most well known university, Harbin Institute of Technology]]		

Harbin is the center for higher education in Northeast China, and has several leading universities, with the most famous being Harbin Institute of Technology. The universities make up a large portion of the cities economy and employ a large part of the population. Many of these schools were founded by the Russians and still retain the architectural charm of their predecessors. There are also several medical universities in the city that support the local hospitals. 	 

===Studying Chinese===
[[Image:Harbin_HIT_2.jpg|thumb|250px|HIT main street during the summer]]
Harbin is famous for its standard Mandarin pronunciation. It's a very good place to study Mandarin. As the saying goes, 'If you want to study Chinese language, come to China. If you want to study Mandarin, come to Beijing. If you want to study standard Mandarin, come to Harbin.' It can be a cheap alternative to Beijing for studying Mandarin, with tuition costing about half and housing one third of what it would be in Beijing or Shanghai. Most universities have lots of Korean and Russian students. There are a couple of cheap Western cafes and a small but lively foreign student social scene at the local expat hangouts on the weekends, such as Blues. Many schools in Harbin offer Chinese language programs:

*'''Harbin Institute of Technology''' (哈尔滨工业大学) [http://studyathit.hit.edu.cn/hypx.asp] About 400 foreign Mandarin Chinese students a semester. Good facilities, although the teaching methods employed in the non-CET courses are considered outdated by many of the foreign students and most of the professors are not actual full-time professors, but they have the high level teaching skills. Large Russian and Korean population. Home to the '''American CET Harbin program''' [http://www.cetacademicprograms.com] with 5-30 students a semester, which is probably the best program in Harbin but expensive &mdash; US$10,000 a semester &mdash; and the students can only speak Chinese while they are in Harbin.   

*'''Harbin University of Science and Technology''' (哈尔滨理工大学) [http://www1.hrbust.edu.cn/zuzhijigou/hustfao/fao/lhlx.html] Nice campus. 	 

*'''Harbin Normal University''' (哈尔滨师范大学) [http://www.hrbnu.edu.cn/gjjl/gjjlgk.htm] 

*'''Haerbin Engineering University''' (哈尔滨工程大学) [http://www.hrbeu.edu.cn/xxgk2/jigousz/wsc/lhlx.htm]

*'''Heilongjiang University''' (黑龙江大学) [http://www.hlju.edu.cn/international]Claims to be the biggest Chinese learning center in the province.  They speak very little English and the admissions office is very disorganized.  

*'''Northeast Agricultural University''' (东北农业大学) [http://gjxy.neau.edu.cn/wglxs.asp?typeid=37&BigClassid=60&newsid=513] dairy and food research center

*'''Northeast Forest University''' (东北林业大学) 

*'''Harbin University of Commerce'''(哈尔滨商业大学)

Also, the city offers the opportunity to study Mandarin Chinese one to one:  

*'''The Harbin Mandarin School''' [http://www.theharbinmandarinschool.com.cn/]Encourages a complete immersion in the study of Mandarin, thereby imparting a unique understanding of the need for fluency and nature of a subject while building skills in listening, speaking, reading and writing.

===Studying TESOL===

*'''Will-Excel TESOL Institute''' [http://www.WillExcelTESOL.com] 
Will-Excel TESOL offers a TESOL Diploma program which combines a 160 hour classroom TESOL course in Harbin with a 6-12 month paid teaching-term in Harbin or another city. With current visa changes in China it is recommended to do an accredited online TESOL course. Will Excel TESOL Institute is not accredited and is pretty useless these days as no on in China recognises it.

===Studying other subjects===
If your Chinese is good enough you can enroll in most of the schools in Harbin. Many Pakistani students study Medicine at the Heilongjiang Medical University. Tuition is cheap.

==Buy==
Imported Russian goods of all types and qualities are available from tourist shops around town. Look out for vodka, Russian dolls, and chocolate. The local Chinese appeared to have picked up some aspects of Russian cuisine, with western style bread and sausage available around town. Beyond this, the shopping is much like any other city in China.

*'''Zhongyang Dajie''' The main shopping district is along Zhongyang Dajie where there is a Wal-Mart near the flood control monument and another shopping district along Guogeli Jie where you can find clothing, food and more. Along this street are huge new shopping malls such as the Euro Plaza, Parksons, and Lane Crawford that carry international brands and are expensive. There are Nike stores, KFC and interesting Russian thrift stores.  The street is lined with beer gardens during the summer.

*'''Guogeli Dajie''' (果戈里大街). Harbin's second biggest shopping district after Zhongyang Dajie (bigger in size). The area around here is dotted with Russian buildings and HUGE shopping complexes. At night there are numerous night markets, a small scale Russian church where people dance, and a small and lively "bar lake."

*'''Indian Street''' (印度一条街). A commercial side street located right off Guogeli Dajie. If you're facing the East, it's past the giant castle and on your right. Used to be complete with Indian thrift stores, clothing, and food, but now offers only Russian items, including dolls, pocketknives and toys. But don't expect any Indian restaurants as there aren't any yet. 
===Foreigners in Harbin===

The foreigners living in Harbin come from Siberia, Korea, US, Australia and more generally from Europe.  In the past five years, the cities expatriate population has grown increasingly diverse. There are a number of English teachers hailing from various countries. However, the lack of foreign investment in the province as a whole means that often the resident expats are either students or teachers.  There are also a number of African and Middle Eastern students studying at the high-profile Harbin Institute of Technology.  

English is spoken less commonly in Harbin than in China's Southern cities.  Thankfully, Harbiners speak the standard Mandarin accent used by newscasters and actors, making it a favorite city for foreigner to study Mandarin.

===Money===
Most ATM's around the city work with international cards, such as the Bank of China and the China Merchants Bank. 

* <listing name="Western Union" address="Located in almost every China Post 中国邮政 ''zhongguo youzheng'' and Agricultural Bank 农业银行 ''nongye yinhang'', look for the yellow western union sign" phone="" email="" fax="" hours="" price="" url="">西联汇款 ''xilian huikuan'' in Chinese</listing>

===Unique Items===
[[Image:Underground.jpg|thumb|250px|Underground Mall taken]] 

*'''The Hongbo Shichang,''' at the intersection of Dong Dazhi Jie and Hongjun Jie, is an enormous underground shopping center -- if they don't have it, you don't need it.

*'''Harbin Sex Store/Museum''' on Guogeli Dajie sells all sorts of sex materials and toys. Kind of unexpected for conservative China. 

* '''Pirate DVDs''' A large DVD store occupies a corner in the basement of the Jiaohua Electronics Market (教化电子市场). All DVD's are around &yen;6 and arranged alphabetically. Opposite from the Harbin Institute of Technology's main gate (哈工大正门对面) and across the street from Buy Now Hui. Be sure and buy the DVDs sold in the main store, and not at the numerous small kiosks that take up the rest of the basement.

===Clothing===
* '''Sofia Jintaiyang Fashion City''' (金太阳索菲亚精品城) around the corner from St. Sophia Church (道里区地段街) is Haerbin's answer to Beijing's Xidan. Multi story fashion market lined with small stalls selling the hottest fashions from China at cheap prices.  

*'''Hongbo Century Square''' (红博世纪广场) not to be confused with the underground market, this is a huge mall in the basement of the Harbin exhibition center. There is also a fried chicken chain from Texas. There are daily fashion model shows.

*'''Chinese Military Surplus Clothing''' Looking for a comfy cold weather jacket like the Chinese wear? There are a number of stores around the city. One is towards the end of Xidazhi Jie near the Harbin Institute of Technology.  

*'''Western Brands''' The shopping malls at Hongbo and Zhongyang Dajie have everything from Gucci, Brooks Brothers, and Zegna to Timberland and Adidas.  Items are internationally priced.

===Everyday Needs===
*'''Walmart and Carrefour''' the Walmart is located at the end of Zhongyang Dajie by the river.  Its just like any other Walmart. There are several other Walmarts and Carrefours located in the city.

*'''Watsons''' right on Zhongyang Dajie this small convenient store has every health care product you can think of including western shampoo.

*'''Metro German Supermarket''' (麦德龙) near Maidelong Chaoshi (道里区埃德蒙顿路职工街1号). German owned walmart type supermarket with the city's biggest selection of western food, a huge selection of imported wine, alcohol and beer, cheese, pastas and ice cream. It's all there, including the steep prices! 

*'''Scholars Bookstore''' (学府书店) Harbin's largest bookstore is located near Heilongjiang University on Xuefu Lu (学府路). 

* '''Flower, Bird and Fish Market''' (花鸟鱼工艺品交易场) Miaopu Road (道里区苗圃街), huge assortment of fresh plants, birds and tropical fish.

[[Image:Harbin_food.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Typical Harbin dishes]]

If there is one thing special about Harbin, it has to be the food.  Taking influences from Russia, Mongolia, Korea and of course China, the food in Harbin is much "heartier" than you can find anywhere in China, and stews and other ''duncai'' are popular dishes.  Because the winters are long here you'll find less exotic ingredients and heavy use of vegetables like cabbage, potatoes, cucumber and corn.  Chinese BBQ or ''shaokao'' and Hot Pot is also equally popular in Harbin and is a must eat once you get into town. 

One thing you will notice is that Dongbei people love to eat, and its not just for the food, but for getting all their friends together at one table and drinking/eating the night away.  Thus this city is dominated by restaurants with large tables that seat groups of people. Besides small food stalls, only near the Universities and busy shopping areas will you find cozy little restaurants.  In Harbin, liveliness (''renao'') attracts customers and much as the food; some restaurants are so loud you may need earplugs!

==Drink==
Just because Harbin is below freezing a good amount of the year, doesn't mean it's devoid of a nightlife. In fact, Harbin is one of the more "rowdier" cities in China. Just don't expect Shanghai or even Beijing "quality" establishments. With a good amount of foreigners living in the city studying and working, the weekends are always bustling around 2-3 locations such as Blues, The Box, Pacers, or the small bars around the Universities. Dongbei people are ''reqing'' (热情）　or very lively and seem to drink with almost every meal! Often times at restaurants you'll see drunk men singing away and then lighting up their cigarettes to signal the night is coming to an end. And of course what would be better than to spend the wee hours of the night singing away to the tune of Titanic and Michael Jackson at one of the KTV's that can be found at almost every street corner!

In Harbin, people often start off the night at a cheap ''shaokao'' or Hotpot restaurant washed down with ¥1.5 bottles of Hapi. After a long dinner its usually to one of Harbin's clubs or bars to spend the rest of the night.  If you are not a fan of the drinking scene, Harbin may not be for you as there isn't much else to do.  That being said, there are dozens of small bars and a few cafes, so if you are not one for dancing and loud discos there are plenty of options.  

Some non-drinking activities include bowling, pool, or visiting a tea house.

===Clubs===
Many discos that cater mainly to Chinese have table minimums. That is, each table has a different minimum purchase to sit there and you must purchase at least that much as soon as you sit down. They won't trust that you will eventually purchase enough over the course of the evening. Some even have the price of the table on a tent card sitting on the table.  You can try and get around this sales tactic by saying you want to just have a look around (wo yao xian kan kan) and hope that they forget about you.

Everything that is Harbin, Russians, Mongolians, Turks, Canadians, Brazilians, Koreans. Frequent staging ground for fights between Koreans and Mongolians or Russians fighting with Russians. The staff has also been known to get involved in fights or start them. Friday nights 10:30PM and afterward get really crazy when about 80% of Harbin's foreign newcomers head out to Blue's to party. Also, at 11PM you can buy a bottle of Vodka for &yen;10, but it is devil water from Anhui has made many people go nuts and dance on the pole for hours. During the week it is full of Chinese.</drink>

===Bars===
Most bars in the city are clustered around the universities and tourist districts.  The Development Zone has some bars as well but they are more expensive.

[[Image:Bar Street.jpg|thumb|220px|Heida Bar Street]]
The campus of '''Harbin Institute of Technology''' (复华小区) is surrounded with a number of small and cozy bars.  HIT itself has a number of foreign teachers and hundreds of foreign students.  Some notable bars here are:

* <drink name="" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long=""></drink>

'''Sky Bar/Cafe:''' A new bar back on the scene after closing down a couple of years ago. A cosy little pub in an old Russian-style building. Widest range of imported beers in town. Amazing fish and chips, burgers and other pub food. Staff are fluent in English and good to sit around and chat too. Big screen TV for live sports....just ask them and they will put it on for you. They have Trivia every Thursday and Texas Hold'em on Tuesdays. The best place to hang and meet others in "The Bin."
南岗区砖街13号（曲线街砖街交口附近）。 

At the middle portion of '''Guogeli Dajie''' (果戈里大街) near Children s Park (儿童公园) there is a small man made lake that is surrounded by 10 or so small pubs and a fountain.  During the warmer months this small square is packed with people out for a night stroll and is really lively.  This also seems to be a place for the trendy teens and college age kids to hang out.  If you continue walking down Guogeli Dajie there are a few more small bars dotting the street. Great for people watching! For about &yen;100 you can order a "beer tower" (啤酒塔 pijiuta), which is a tall plastic tube with a spigot on the bottom.  At the other end of the lake there is a restaurant that resembles TGI Friday's, as besides the name being changed to DJ Friday's almost everything else has been copied.  What makes this place really stand out from the real TGI Fridays are the scantily clad Russian dancers. 

Near Heilongjiang University (黑龙江大学) right across from the main gate are several small bars and pubs to accommodate the huge Korean and Russian student population.

===Teahouses and cafes===
There are a number of very nice teahouses in the New Development Zone (开发区). Most will rent you a room and will charge by the hour, plus whatever tea you decide to drink. Some of the teahouses are located on Hengshan Lu (衡山路) such as 君如意茶楼， 雅泰茶楼.

As of January 2013 it is closed</drink>

As of late 2012 there were two Starbucks located on walking street.

===Live music===
There is a Jazz Bar on GuogeLi Dajie that often has a piano/sax duo playing, and guitar/vocalists can be found at some of the smaller bars around HIT and Hei Da.

==Sleep==

===Budget===
Almost every '''bath house''' in the city has a large room with 50-100 plush beds where you can spend up to 24 hours.  You can also lock your belongings in a locker and use their shower facilities, most of them have a all you can eat buffet as well.  Total around ¥50 which just can't be beat. Look for signs that say 洗浴 and make sure its fairly big as the smaller ones will not provide these types of services. When you come in pack light as to not look suspicious. ''This is not recommended for inexperienced travelers and it is highly unlikely any of the service staff will speak English.''

Other budget options include:

Other 5 star hotels have been established. The New Paris Hotel is a 5 star hotel that is quickly gaining popularity. It has very luxury facilities and a very impressive lobby.

Both on Zhongshan Road.

==Stay safe==
While it is unlikely that you will be a victim of a crime, as in any large city be vigilant about your personal property, exercise care if you find yourself on a lightly traveled street, and always be aware of your surroundings. 

*Be vigilant of your personal property and be aware of your surroundings.
*Be careful when crossing the street. Keep an eye on the locals and cross with them.
*Dress warmly and in layers during the winter months. 
*Avoid fish caught in the Songhua River as it was contaminated by benzyne in November 2005 – fish is available from the many lakes surrounding Harbin. 
*Avoid going into small bathhouses and small KTV alone, as you may end up being forced to pay for a bill you didn't order. If you choose to go, be mindful of what you are getting into and leave at the first sign of illegal activity. People interested in a "massage" with extras should avoid doing it in Harbin.

Free emergency telephone numbers: 
*Police: 110. 
*Fire alarm: 119. 
*Medical care: 120. 

Remember these three telephone numbers. They are valid on most of the Chinese mainland.

In winter, streets can get slippery and it's not uncommon to see parts of sidewalks covered in ice. So never hurry when you walk, and be very careful when using outdoors steps, such as on footbridges and when getting on and off buses.

==Contact==

===Internet===
Many many places with free wifi, you can always get connected. For example: Starbucks, Costa and local cafe, shopping mall, hotel, etc. 

The city is littered with Net bars (网吧 wangba) that are usually very cheap and do not require I.D at the door like the ones in Beijing.  The biggest Internet cafes are near the universities like Harbin Institute of Technology and Hei Da. Be forewarned that sometimes you may have to wait for a computer depending on what time of day it is (5PM-12PM are the worst, school is out) Also, these places are filled with a haze of smoke and Chinese screaming obscenties after they lost a game of Counter Strike or World of Warcraft.

All of the computers are in Chinese language, but still using windows so its relatively easy to use.  You cannot print at Net bars. If you are looking to print something try going to a print or copy station &mdash; look for the Chinese characters 复印 (fuyin) or 打印 (dayin).

===Phones===
If you are looking to refill the minutes on your China Mobile/Unicom/Telecom SIM card, you might have trouble, as very few locations in the city sell the refill cards.  In Harbin, you have to go to an actual store and pay the money to a teller to have your phone refilled and often times you can refill out of town numbers at China Mobile or China Unicom Branches.

===Shipping===
DHL and UPS both deliver to Harbin but through Chinese shipping companies.

==Cope==
Harbin is known for its cruel winter weather. Be sure to have adequate clothing and protect the extremities. Gloves, thick socks, scarves, and ear protections are a must.

If you are in Harbin for the long haul, try to get away to somewhere warm during the winter break such as [[Hainan]] or [[Thailand]].  Also, an excursion to [[Beijing]] is a must for anyone staying in Harbin for any considerable amount of time.
