'''Monterrey''' is the third largest city in [[Mexico]] and the capital of the state of [[Nuevo León]]. It is the commercial, industrial, educational, and transportation hub of northern Mexico, also third in economic importance after  [[Mexico City]] and [[Mexico State]]. Although it is historically an industrial and commercial city (in fact most foreign visitors come for business purposes), tourists will be surprised at the wealth of cultural and entertainment attractions that the city has to offer.

==Understand==
[[Image:Mty_macroplaza01.JPG|thumb|Monterrey is proud of its industrial heritage.]]

Monterrey traces its modern history to its founding in 1596, when Diego de Montemayor founded the city, together with 12 first families. The story is told by a mural on one of the modern grey concrete and black glass government office towers downtown, just off the Macroplaza. The mural seems odd in its juxtaposition of Spanish conquestadors set next to a modern city of skyscrapers and factories. It does capture the spirit of Monterrey though --- a city that isn't so much a product of its past as it is a product of its future. 

Monterrey is an aggressively modern city, unlike most destinations in Mexico. Although it does have some colonial era sights, and its Barrio Antiguo district preserves a sense of Monterrey as it was in its once "sleepy town" days, the city is very much a product of the industrial age of the late 19th and 20th centuries. 

Today, Monterrey has a culture that values education and business ethics. Often referred to as "an industrial giant", the label is more true in the imagination than it is in reality. Monterrey's big steel and iron works have been shut down for almost two decades, and even the concrete, glass, and brewing industries don't dominate the economy as they once did. Instead, people in Monterrey are today more likely to work in retail, in banking, in telecommunications, or in health care or education. 

The city enjoys one of Mexico's highest standards of living, and the population is more educated and cultured than average. 

Monterrey is also a large city. The central downtown has a population of about a million, but the metropolitan area that includes all of its adjacent suburban municipalities brings its total city population to just under 4 million --- similar in size to the San Francisco Bay Area in the U.S.

While it is true that visitors seeking the traditional flavor of colonial Mexico find little to love about Monterrey, the city has emerged as a leading cultural center: it likes cutting edge contemporary architecture (like the visually stunning Puente Atirantado or Puente Viaducto de la Unidad in San Pedro Garza Garcia, the new circular Tec business school in el Valle, or the physics-defying twin leaning bookends look of that shocking white concrete and black glass building that you see as you drive past the ITESM campus). It's also a youthful city that tends to prefer cutting edge rockeros like Plastilina Mosh or Kinky to the cowboy-hat wearing cumbia groups that built the city's music industry in the '70s and '80s. Monterrey is a city where international cuisine finds a welcoming reception, and where high-speed broadband internet connections are actually becoming more commonplace than in many U.S. communities. Monterrey is a progressive, modern city that likes to learn, likes to work, and likes to live for the weekend.

Monterrey is a large city with a wide variety of transportation options. Bus, plane, or personal car are the most practical ways to get to Monterrey.

===By plane=== 
Monterrey has two airports. All commercial flights use Monterrey International (MTY) -- the city's main airport. Private and cargo carriers use Del Norte Airport. 
[[Image:Mty_mune1.JPG|thumb|Monterrey's new MUNE museum opened September 2007.]]

It has several flights a day to all major Mexican destinations, including Mexico City, Guadalajara, Toluca, Cancun, Merida, Puerto Vallarta, Mazatlan, and Tijuana.  Several low cost airlines fly from Monterrey to different parts of the country, including Volaris and Viva Aerobus. Viva Aerobus operates out of Terminal C. The airport is located about 20 minutes from downtown in the suburban municipality of [[Apodaca]]. The usual taxi fare to go from the airport to the city and vice versa is about US$25. 
* '''Del Norte Airport''' ({{ICAO|MMAN}}), Tel: +52 (81) 80-30-90-90. Private planes flying to Monterrey can use the smaller Del Norte Airport.

===By bus=== 
Monterrey's Central de Autobuses is the hub of bus transportation in the city and is the largest bus station in northern Mexico. The station has bays for more than 100 buses to simultaneously load or unload. It is served by more than a dozen first-class bus lines and dozens more second-class bus lines. Trans-border buses go between Monterrey and cities throughout the United States while long distance buses go from Monterrey to other major Mexican bus hubs and to every notable city in northern Mexico.
[[Image:Mty_centrautobuses1.JPG|thumb|Monterrey's Central de Autobuses, Metrorrey subway line running overhead.]]

Bus lines operating between Monterrey and Texas and other southern U.S. state destinations include (among others): 
* Adame
* Americanos and Amigos [http://www.autobusesamericanos.com.mx/joomla/]
* El Conejo [http://www.autobuseselconejo.com/]
* El Expreso [http://www.elexpreso.net/]
* Autobuses Garcia
* Tornado [https://www.tornadobus.com/]
* Turimex Internacional [http://www.gruposenda.com]

First-class and executive-level bus lines operating between Monterrey and other Mexican cities include (among others): 
* Estrella Blanca (Turistar, Futura, Chihuahenses, more), [http://www.estrellablanca.com.mx/]
* ETN, [http://www.etn.com.mx/]
* Grupo Senda (Sendor, Tamaulipas, Coahuilenses, more), [http://www.gruposenda.com.mx/]
* Olimpia [http://www.olimpia.com.mx/]
* Omnibus de Mexico, [http://www.odm.com.mx/]
* Transportes del Norte

Some bus lines also have small company-specific bus stations on the outskirts of the city, for example, Grupo Senda has a stop near the Cintermex, which can be convenient for passengers arriving by way of the McAllen/Reynosa border crossing.

Greyhound Buses from Texas arrive in the Greyhound Terminal in the General Escobedo district. It's an easy walk from the terminal to the end of Metro Line 2 (Sendero Station). This metro station is above ground and easily visible - ride it to the other end General Zaragoza to arrive in Monterrey's Central/Barrio Antiguo area. 

''Location:'' Central de Autobuses is located in the heart of Monterrey on Av. Colon. You can get to the Central de Autobuses using the Metrorrey subway system ''(closest station is Cuauhtémoc)''. The main phone number for the bus station is (81) 8372-9324.

===By car===
Monterrey is about 200km south of the U.S./Mexico border. The most common border crossings, both in South Texas, used to get to Monterrey are Laredo/Nuevo Laredo and McAllen-Hidalgo/Reynosa. The travel time from either Reynosa or Nuevo Laredo is about two hours.  Many people from Monterrey drive to San Antonio and all points north through Puente Colombia outside of [[Nuevo Laredo]]. The customs and immigration lines are usually much shorter at the Colombia crossing, plus you can eliminate most of the traffic and congestion of Nuevo Laredo. Note: The Colombia border crossing checkpoint is closed from midnight to 8am daily.

To reach Monterrey from the United States, take Interstate 35 south. The highway ends at International Bridge 2 in Laredo. The Aduana office for handling vehicle import paperwork is on the river road in between Bridge 1 and Bridge 2. Mexican auto insurance can also be purchased there. From Nuevo Laredo, take Mexico Highway 85 south and it brings you right into Monterrey.

Guia Roji maps are the best in Mexico, but in an age of cell phone apps, you might be better served by driving with Google Maps than fumbling with the old-style paper maps. You can buy Guia Roji maps online, or they are sold in every Sanborns store in Mexico.

==Get around==
Taxis and walking are the best choices. Buses are common but hard to use. The subway is good, but has limited coverage.

===Taxis===
'''Taxis''' are the easiest way to get around Monterrey. Taxis are both affordable and plentiful. Taxis use meters in Monterrey, and to avoid overcharges, insist that the driver use the meter. The fare from downtown to the airport will be about 750 pesos.

===Rideshare===

Many people find rideshare apps to be a more convenient and economical way to travel around a city.  In Monterrey, service is available using '''Uber''', '''Cabify''', and '''Didi'''.  Rideshare services operate throughout the city, but are difficult (or impossible) to use at the Monterrey International Airport (MTY). I've tried twice to use Uber when arriving in MTY, once from the main terminal, and once from Terminal C. In both cases, I gave up trying to get the Uber app to send me a car and ended up going back inside the terminal and using a kiosk to pay for a regular airport taxi. Your mileage may vary (but probably won't).

===Bus===

The buses in Monterrey go through the city numbers 1-199 go in a certain part of the city. Numbers 200-300 go to most part of the city.And 300-502 are minibuses. Also there is a metrobus service in Guadalupe and San Bernabe area. There are three routes in San Bernabe and one in Guadalupe. Careful, many buses will not come to a full stop when letting passengers off. Download the Moovit app to plan your bus journey. Timetables are not realiable, but the routes generally are. 

===Subway===
[[Image:Metrorrey_Map.png|thumb|right|400px|Map of Monterrey subway system.]]
The '''Metrorrey subway system''' is clean, modern, and very inexpensive, though the coverage is not extensive. It can be used to go between downtown areas like Macroplaza or Barrio Antiguo and the Central de Autobuses bus station. It also stops near the Cerveceria Cuahtemoc and the Coliseo and is a good choice if you are staying in the suburban municipality of Guadalupe. The useful stops for a tourist include:
* ''Central'': main bus station, Coliseo
* ''Cuahtemoc'': transfer point, low-end shopping, brewery tours
* ''Padre Mier'': shopping near Morelos (Zona Rosa), Holiday Inn Centro
* ''Zaragoza'': Macroplaza, Barrio Antiguo, Howard Johnson, Fiesta Americana, Santa Rosa Suites
* ''Parque Fundidora'': Parque Fundidora, Cintermex, Arena Monterrey, Holiday Inn Fundidora
* ''Santa Ana'': Since the opening of line 3 the preferred stop to visit most of Parque Fundidora and Paseo Santa Lucia
* ''Universidad'': Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo León, Parque Niños Héroes, Estadio Universitario
* ''Exposicion'': Near the expo, Domo Care concert hall and the stadium of Rayados, which will be used for the FIFA World Cup 2026.

Most of the metro is above ground and easily visible, however the downtown/central stations such as Padre Mier and General Zaragoza are underground and quite hard to find as they're not signed. Get a map reference for where the station is located, then when you'er there look for perspex arches over stairs that go down from street level (usually positioned on a footpath/sidewalk on an intersection). That will be a station entrance. In 2021 line 3 came in operation, which is basically just and extension of line 2. Vehicles on line 2 will continue as line 3 from Zaragoza and passes Santa Ana (for Parque Fundidaora), Felix U Gomez (connection to line 1) and terminates at Hospital Metropolitano.

===Car===
[[Image:Mty_downtown1.JPG|thumb|Street near the Macroplaza in downtown Monterrey.]]
Renting a '''car''' is a possibility, though it can be expensive and navigating the streets can be a bit tricky. As with any major metro area, parking is always an issue, though parking is generally easier in Monterrey than in other cities of similar size. Many downtown hotels offer free parking and free valet parking for their guests. A large public lot under the Macroplaza usually has spaces available.

===Downtown Tourism Transportation===
In the downtown area, there is a '''tourist trolley''' that does regular circuits around the Macroplaza and Barrio Antiguo areas.

'''Riverboats''' on the Paseo Santa Lucia can be used to go between the Macroplaza area and Parque Fundidora. The boats leave from the waterway below the Museo de Historia Mexicana, near the Palacio del Gobierno. A one-way fare is 100 pesos (February 2022).

In nice weather a vendor sells drinks, fruit and snacks at the trailhead, which was once the entry ("Entrada Al Teleferico") for the long-defunct cable car.  Provisions are also usually available at the viewing platform ("Terraza Al Teleferico") at the approximate trail midpoint.  The trail ends at a (locked) vehicular gate accessing the telecommunications station, and is paved with a mix of natural rock, set stones and concrete, so hiking boots are not necessary; most people wear sneakers.

The shopping scene in Monterrey is excellent. You'll find many international labels and designer houses in the upper-end malls.  

===Folkart===
If you are looking for Mexican folkart there are two good places to look. For upscale artesanias, the best place in Monterrey (indeed, one of the best high-end shops in all Mexico) is Carapan (Hidalgo Oriente 305, Monterrey, MX 64000), located within steps of the Sheraton Ambassador hotel. On the popular end of the price (and quality) spectrum are the myriad shops along the Carreterra Nacional near the town of Santiago N.L.

Although Monterrey is not known for any specific types of popular folk art, their regional candies are widely sold throughout the city and make excellent gifts to bring back home. Look for any kind of "leche quemada", especially the deliciously carmelized "Glorias", crusted in chopped pecans.

===Upscale Malls===
Monterrey has several large, modern malls, with a cluster of them close together in San Pedro. These malls are the same as malls elsewhere in the world. Major malls in Monterrey include:
* '''Galerias Monterrey'''
* '''Plaza Fiesta San Agustin'''
* '''Galerías Valle Oriente'''
* '''Plaza Cumbres'''
* '''Plaza Fiesta Anahuac'''
* '''Paseo San Pedro'''
* '''Metropolitan Center'''
* '''Punto Valle'''[https://puntovalle.com/]

===Local Flavor===
Morelos, also known as the Zona Rosa, is a pedestrian friendly street downtown lined with busy shops, small malls, shopping arcades, and filled with street vendors and musicians. You won't find the mass-market name brand boutiques here, but it's more fun than being in the same kind of mall you can find in any major U.S. city. 

Local character is on display on the Carretera Nacional (Hwy. 85), heading south of the city towards Linares. A 1-mile stretch of highway near the town of Santiago is lined with small open-air shops, restaurants, and marketplaces. You can get great deals on rustic furniture, clothing, household goods, puppies, homemade food products, and just about anything else you can imagine. Parking can be difficult on weekends, but the selection is at its best and the atmosphere is the closest thing you'll find to the big outdoor markets boasted by cities in the rest of the latin world.

Monterrey is a paradise for spicy food lovers and anyone who loves the smoky flavor of fresh meats grilled over smoldering wood embers will be right at home in any restaurant serving authentic Northern Mexican cuisine. If you get tired of the local cuisine, Monterrey offers plenty of international cuisine such as:Argentinian, Brazilian, Japanese, Chinese and Italian. Also, because of it's close proximity to the United States, almost all American chain restaurants are available. 

===Northern Mexico Cuisine===
* '''cabrito''' - Whole kid goats are splayed over hot coals and slow roasted for hours. Usually served with hot tortillas, fresh sliced onions, and house salsa. 
* '''machacado''' - Breakfast in Monterrey often includes machacado con huevo, dried salted beef is shredded into a pan and lightly braised, then eggs are scrambled in --- serve with warm tortillas and salsa.
* '''atropellado''' - Dry meat with tomato, onion and peppers, really good!
* '''cafe de olla''' - Rustic-style coffee brewed with a touch of cinnamon. Delicious!
* '''arracherra''' - What's known as fajitas in some places is arracherra in Monterrey --- grilled marinated skirt steak topped with melted white cheese and served with hot tortillas and caramelized onions.
* '''leche quemada''' - Nuevo Leon is famous for its succulently sweet caramel candies made from scorched sweetened goat milk. The candies are available in several forms, including small balls dusted with fine granular sugar, rolls, and of course, Glorias --- the queen of leche quemada, with a healthy dollop of chopped pecans to enhance its already nutty sweet flavor
* '''discada''' - It gets its name because traditionally you make in a used plow disc that's been welded shut. Meat, pork, chicken, sausage, chilaca, onion, beer and bacon with some tortillas. 

===Restaurants===
Restaurant recommendations are in the individual district articles. Small, family-run neighborhood restaurants, taquerias, and fast food outlets are located in every neighborhood of the city. High-end restaurants and those catering to tourists are mostly in the [[Monterrey/Zona Rosa|Zona Rosa]] area downtown and in [[San Pedro Garza Garcia]].

Some restaurants serving authentic Northern Mexican food include:

* '''La Huasteca'''
* '''El Regio'''
* '''El Rey del Cabrito''' 
* '''Los Cabritos''' 
* '''La Nacional'''

Cheap eats with local character include:

* '''Dona Tota''' (gorditas --- several locations)
* '''Taqueria Las Monjitas''' (waitresses still wear habits)
* '''El Mercado Juarez''' (cheap cabrito)

[[Image:Mty_barrioantiguo0.JPG|thumb|By day, the Barrio Antiguo has stylish colonial charm, at night, it's a club-hopper's scene.]]
The clubbing scene in Monterrey is very hot. Monterrey experienced a period of gang violence several years ago, and some past hotspots closed their doors. The Covid pandemic further dampened the nightlife scene, but today, new venues are opening up and people are going out at night. Popular hotspots like the Barrio Antiguo are again relatively safe at night and the club scene in el Valle is expanding beyond the previous limits of Centrito.  Nightclubs range from the typical "dive bar" to the very expensive. Because Monterrey is home to the top colleges in Mexico, thousands of young people from all over Mexico party as early as Wednesday. You will surely find a club that suits your taste. There are 2 major clubbing areas to know about, downtown known as the '''Barrio Antiguo''' and the '''Centrito''', in San Pedro.

* '''Barrio Antiguo''' (Old Town) is probably your best option for any type of nightlife. A wide range of clubs feature different types of music. Good restaurants are located on several streets, though the largest number is along Calle Morelos. Keep an eye out for people handing out "No Cover" passes on the street, as well as flyers advertising events, cover fee, and special offers (example: 2x1 on bottles before 12 a.m., girls 50% off cover fee before 11 p.m.) at the different nightclubs. If you want a young crowd and a lot of techno music, try Karma Club (Padre Meir 866). If you want upscale with DJs playing pop, try Topaz Deluxe (Padre Meir 1248).

* The '''Centrito''' had seen a steady decline in its night scene, until world reknown clubs like Dubai and El Clásico opened in the city. You can find El Clásico in Playa del Carmen near Cancún. Now as you can imagine  Centrito is one of the best bets right now when it comes to clubbing.  If you choose you can still go to the top notch clubs in calzada de San pedro, they are called'''Havana''' which is located in Avenida San Pedro or the '''Privatt'''. 

* A night out is not complete until you finish eating "breakfast" at a local taqueria or hot dog stand. It is very common to find outdoor grills going full-tilt on city streets at 4am. '''Tacos del Julio''' and '''Tacos del Güero''' are two of the most sought-out establishments for this purpose.

* The traffic fine for being caught driving under the influence can reach up to US$2,500 or three days imprisonment. Police roadblocks on Saturday nights are common. It's not worth the risk.

===Beer===
Monterrey is a famous brewing city and is the home for popular brands like Dos Equis, Tecate, and Bohemia. You can stop by the beer garden in front of the Cerveceria Cuahtemoc brewery anytime during the day for a free glass of beer under the towering oak trees. 

If you like craft beers, you also have plenty of choice. Stop by any location of the Sierra Madre Brewing Company (eight locations throughout the city, each featuring fresh beer and brick-oven pizzas). 

Other craft breweries include:
* Cerveceria Obelisco 
* Cerveceria Fausto
* Cerveceria Principia (taproom in San Pedro)
* Cervezeria Rrëy (the taproom in San Pedro is named Del Barril)
* Cerveceria Finisima [https://www.cervezafinisima.com/]
* Cerveceria Bocanegra
* Cerveceria Albur [https://albur.mx/] (taproom in Guadalupe)

===Mineral Water===
Despite it's arid climate, generations of Mexicans have come to Monterrey for the water. Specifically, Topo Chico, the most recognized mineral water in Mexico. It springs from the mountain called Topo Chico in the northern part of Monterrey. The Topo Chico brand was purchased by Coca-Cola, but the familiar yellow labeled bottles are still recognized as a liquid symbol of Monterrey. [https://www.topochico.com/]

==Sleep==
Monterrey has hundreds of hotels in all price categories. Listings are in the various Districts. Hotels cluster in three areas:  

* '''Downtown''' (includes Macroplaza, Zona Rosa, Fundidora, Barrio Antiguo) El Centro is your best bet if you want a good value on a comfortable room close to museums and most tourist attractions. (See [[Monterrey/Zona Rosa|Zona Rosa]]  district for specific hotel recommendations.)

* '''San Pedro Garza Garcia''' is your best bet if you want new, upscale hotels close to major shopping malls and business centers. (See [[San Pedro Garza Garcia|San Pedro Garza Garcia]] district for specific hotel recommendations.)

* '''Airport''' hotels are good if you're visiting industrial sites in the San Nicolas area, or if you're just waiting between flights. (See [[Apodaca|Apodaca]] district for specific hotel recommendations.)

===Budget lodging===
Monterrey has a wide variety of options for the backpacker or extreme budget traveler. There are several very cheap hotels clustered within a few blocks of the bus station, though many feature dubious cleanliness. [[Hostels]] are a better option, and there are at least three hostels operating in Monterrey - these offer clean bunks for as cheap as US$10 per night. Several new budget hotels have opened in Monterrey since 2004: these new properties include a CityExpress on the [[Monterrey/South|southern]] side of the city, an Ibis in [[San Pedro Garza Garcia|San Pedro]], and another Ibis at the airport --- rooms can be had at all of these for under US$50 per night.

==Contact==
High-speed broadband internet is widely available and most hotels provide free wifi. Wifi is also widely available in restaurants and bars, but not in public places. Mexico City has far better public wifi availability than Monterrey. You will not find free, open wifi in public parks, nor even in the MTY airport.

Celular service is available everywhere in the city, though travelers will have mixed experiences with their
devices working with the networks in Monterrey. Phones on some carriers will just work as soon as you step off the plane, while others won't and may require jumping through some hoops to make the phone work locally. I had a phone with Consumer Cellular that got no cell service in Monterrey, so I was stuck doing Whatsapp calls over the hotel wifi. I now have a Verizon phone with a Mexico roaming plan ($15 extra) and it works everywhere in Monterrey. AT&T phones seem to have the best compatibility with Mexican cell networks and low (or no) extra fees. 

Newspapers in Monterrey include the following:
* El Norte 
* El Porvenir 
* Milenio 
* El Sol
* El Regio

==Stay safe==
The Monterrey area is an important location for cartels, causing it to experience occasional violence including gun battles, kidnappings and robberies as well as an extremely heavy army presence. Sometimes, there are armed robberies on the city's transit systems, so be careful when riding buses. Do not flash valuables or cash around. During the day, Monterrey is rather safe, just be very mindful at night. You can easily find yourself in an area with nobody on the street. Be especially careful if you plan on renting a car and traveling into the mountains and surrounding small towns. Santiago and Cola De Caballo, two popular day trips in the mountains to the south, have been experiencing some safety issues recently.
