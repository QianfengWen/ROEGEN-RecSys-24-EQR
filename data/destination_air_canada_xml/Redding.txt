'''Redding''' is in [[Shasta County]] in northern [[California]], in the [[United States]]. Located on interstate highway I-5, it is the largest city in California north of [[Sacramento]].  It is slightly south of [[Mount Shasta]] and [[Shasta Lake]].

==Understand==
Although Redding is located in California, It is quite socially and politically conservative,due to it's isolation away from major city centers and coasts, and is known to be religious. It is making an effort to be more progressive with social issues, however be aware that it's best to refrain from discussing politics, especially if your leanings are liberal to moderate, since it can turn into a heated discussion. People are very set in their ways with their views, and are not likely to change their opinions in one discussion. While out and about, it's common to hear discussions or remarks that may offend some people, or that they may disagree with. There are efforts underway for more acceptance of the LGBTQ community, however any outward displays or public displays of affection may be frowned upon.

==Get in==

===By road===
* '''Interstate 5''' is the main north-south road through Redding, going as far north as [[Blaine|Blaine, WA]] (near [[Bellingham_(Washington)|Bellingham]]) to Imperial Beach, CA (near [[San Diego]]).  It's a fast route, and goes through many towns & cities in the Pacific states, but its disadvantage is that it does not go along the actual coast much (except at the very north and south ends).  For that, you will need to switch between highways (via Hwy 299 to US101, see below).  Redding is accessed from Exit #675 (S Bonneyview Rd/Churn Creek Rd) through Exit #685 (CA-151 Shasta Dam Blvd).  Downtown is accessed from #678 ("CA-44 Eureka/Lassen National Pk")

* '''Highway 299''' is Redding's main link to the coast (namely [[Arcata]]), and its link to [[Modoc County]] in northeastern California.  It is, however, one of the less-traveled roads (because it is very narrow with very sharp curves much of the way) in the area.  As a consequence, it is also one of the more scenic roads as well.  Comes into town from the west as Eureka Way (west of Market). 

* '''Highway 44''' is the main road to [[Lassen Volcanic National Park]].  Redding is the western terminus of this road.  It is very scenic.  Unfortunately, there are fatal crashes literally almost every week, due to the combination of pedestrians and a lot of reckless and/or drunk drivers.  If you decide to walk or bike along this road, change your plans, as it is illegal.  However, that is a bit pointless.  They will usually not prosecute you, as you will either be dead or lying in the local hospital's ICU.  So don't do it.  In downtown it goes east as Tehama St between Market & Liberty.  

* '''Highway 273''' is also a busy road.  It is very short, stretching from Redding to [[Anderson_(California)|Anderson]].  Walking and bicycling are permitted, but use caution.  If you see a frontage road (and there are quite a few), even if it is a narrow dirt path, by all means take it.  Many people do this, so while you are driving, be aware of it.  The scenery along this road is not all that fascinating, so if that's what you're looking for, go along Highway 299 west of Redding (or if you need north to south, Highway 151 is nice).  Comes into town from the north as N Market St.  

* '''Highway 151''' is the most direct road to [[Shasta_Lake|Shasta Lake City]] and Shasta Dam from Redding.  It is in a rural, mostly forested setting, and is very scenic.  Although it is not too crowded, hikers and bicyclists going north on it are not recommended because it lies almost continuously along a steep grade.  However, it might be fun to ride a bike southward along it, as that is a steep downward slope.  Be careful, though.

There is one county road of note in Redding: County Road A16, known to locals as Placer Rd. (or Placer St. if you're in town).  It runs all the way from the intersection at Sequoia St. in Redding to another intersection at Highway 36 just west of Platina.  It is a major road in Redding, but goes through relatively small towns such as Igo and Ono.  In the rural areas, it is a very hard road to drive on, much like Highway 299.

===By train===
Redding is served by [[Rail travel in the United States|Amtrak Coast Starlight]] [http://www.amtrak.com/coast-starlight-train].  The times are a bit annoying &mdash; the southbound train arrives just after midnight, and the northbound just after 5AM. Alternatively Amtrak California offers a Thruway bus [http://www.amtrakcalifornia.com/index.cfm/routes/bus/amtrak-thruway-bus-route-3-stockton-sacramento-redding/] down to Sacramento & Stockton for connections with the San Joaquin train going to Bakersfield via Merced (and another Thruway bus from Bakersfield to Los Angeles or Las Vegas). The Thruway bus ticket is a part of the train ticket and can only be used as extension of an actual train journey.  Cannot be used just for the bus journey such as going from Redding to Chico.  The Amtrak train station and the Amtrak Thruway bus stop are at the RABA (Redding Area Bus Authority) downtown transit center on Yuba St & California St.  (See blow under 'By Bus')

===By bus===
The main bus station is at the downtown RABA (Redding Area Bus Authority) Transit Center on Yuba & California St, a hub for local RABA [http://www.rabaride.com] buses (around town) and for other long distance bus companies such as:

It costs $10 from Redding to Weaverville, another $10 from Weaverville to Willow Creek, and $4 from Willow Creek to Arcata.  Fares are paid in cash when you get on the bus; there are no advance reservations.  The buses for this route do not run on weekends, so plan accordingly.</listing>

===By plane===
Redding Municipal Airport [http://ci.redding.ca.us/transeng/airports/rma.htm], the main airport in Redding, is located at 6751 Woodrum Circle, on the very outskirts of town off of Airport Rd.  It is 2 miles from the Knighton Rd. exit off of I-5 (a bit south of the main Redding exit).  The airport currently has scheduled service to [[San Francisco]] (operated by United Express), and will soon add service to [[Arcata]] and [[Portland]] (operated by PenAir). Redding previously was served by Horizon Air.  The airport also features a Chinese restaurant on the second floor (Peter Chu's Skyroom). A recent expansion of the airport terminal has added post security seating, restrooms, and several other updated amenities.

Benton Airpark [http://ci.redding.ca.us/transeng/airports/benton.htm] is the main private airport in Redding.  It also has a restaurant on the second floor (above the hangar), but the food is generally pretty bad since the ownership changed.  The airport also has the helipads for the local California Highway Patrol office.  It is located at 2600 Gold St.

==Get around==

===By bus===

====RABA====
RABA (Redding Area Bus Authority) [http://www.ci.redding.ca.us/raba/rabahome.htm] is the city bus line in Redding.  It also has routes that go to Shasta College [http://www.shastacollege.edu/], [[Burney]], and Anderson.  The terminal is at the corner of Yuba and California St., and the base fare is $1.50 (and $0.75 for a zone change).

===Bicycling===
Drivers generally cooperate with bicyclists on major roads, but that rule changes dramatically with smaller roads, as they don't expect it there.  Be cautious at all times, stay in bike lanes when possible, and whatever you do, don't go on CA-44 nor on the Pit River Bridge across Shasta Lake.

==Do==
* The '''Sacramento River Trail''' is a loop trail that starts at the base of the Dieselhorst Bridge, then goes almost to Keswick Dam,  crosses a bridge, and goes back.  This trail is by far the most popular in Redding.
===Events===
*'''NorCal Tattoo Expo''' is a three day tattoo expo occurring in beginning of November. There're different tattoo artists and contents for best tattoo [https://norcaltattooexpo.com/home/].

==Buy==
Redding is a great place to do shopping.  Stores are spread out, and most specialize in certain things.  There are many plazas lying around, most of which have good shopping.  The Mt. Shasta Mall and the area around it are great places if you want large department stores, but if you want to check out local stores, go to the Market St. Promenade.  This has, over time, also been part of the old Highway 99, then a covered mall, then an abandoned place where vagrants gathered, and has been remodeled to be what it is now, an uncovered mall.

Widely regarded as having the best steaks in Redding.  It looks pretty shabby on the outside, but the food and service are nothing short of amazing.  Be sure to have plenty of the salad, it's also very good.  Scallops are wonderful as well, but the main attraction is the steak.





* '''Gironda's Restaurant''', 1100 Center St., ''+1 530'' 244-7663, Fax: ''+1 530'' 244-7670, [http://www.girondas.com].

A nice Italian place with good food.  The mushroom ravioli is recommended.

* '''Fuji Japanese Restaurant''', 1545 Placer St., ''+1 530'' 243-8366.

Not much special about this place, just good, cheap Japanese food.  Good for takeout.  The trains that go right near the building can get annoying, though.

==Stay Safe==
Redding is a reasonably safe city to go out in. However, as with any city, there are areas best avoided at night or altogether. These areas are usually the older, and more run down parts of town which are usually located near the downtown area/parkview area. There is a visible transient and criminal population that do spend a great deal of time at the Shasta County Library, as well as a few parks and other outdoor areas around town. Redding has been victim to a moderate amount of car theft, property crimes and break ins. No matter where in Redding you are, it's always a good idea to keep your vehicle locked up at all times, and to not keep valuables like purses, electronics, wallets, etc..visible in the vehicle, rather just carry them with you at all times. Car thieves and others have been known to also cruise hotel and shopping center parking lots for cars to break into. Bicycle theft is also an issue, so it's best to keep them locked up indoors if possible or invest in a strong and theft proof lock.

==Get out==
'''Shasta Lake Caverns''' A visit to Shasta County would not be complete without visit to the Shasta Lake Caverns,about 20 mins north of Redding. The 2-hour tour begins with a scenic boat ride on the lake and you will have to climb up a few steps in the cavern, so wear comfortable shoes. Check out their website for tour times, which runs 3 times daily during winter and more frequent during summer. Full price is ~24 for adults. You maybe able to find coupons online too. Arrive at least 10 mins before tour starts as you will have to go down a few freights of stairs to get on the boat.  20359 Shasta Caverns Road Lakehead, CA 96051; [http://lakeshastacaverns.com/]

'''Shasta Lake''' They have a free tour of the dam a few times a day.Go on the Cavern tour first if you have time constraints. You get to see the lake during the cavern tour anyways. However, if you are interested in how the dam was built, the tour might be worthwhile.

'''[[Whiskeytown National Recreation Area]]''' A major historic area.  At different times in its history, it used to be the site of gold, copper, and quartz mining.  Since the lake was created as part of the Central Valley Project, outdoor recreation and historic preservation took over.  It is a wonderful day trip from Redding.
