Founded in 1871, it has become the region's primary political, cultural, economic, and transportation center. At an elevation of 1100 ft (335 m), it is situated in the biologically unique Sonoran Desert.  Over time it has merged with the neighboring cities of [[Scottsdale (Arizona)|Scottsdale]], [[Tempe]], [[Glendale (Arizona)|Glendale]], [[Peoria (Arizona)|Peoria]], [[Mesa]], [[Chandler (Arizona)|Chandler]], and [[Gilbert]] to form the [[Greater Phoenix|Greater Phoenix Metropolitan Area]].  Currently exurbs such as [[Apache Junction]], [[Fountain Hills]], [[Queen Creek]], and [[Sun City (Arizona)|Sun City]] are becoming part of this metropolitan area as well. '''Phoenix is ''extremely'' hot in the summertime,'''  so be prepared for high temperature and UV rays

Why would anybody want to start a city in the middle of a desert? The answer is, surprisingly, agriculture. The Salt and Verde Rivers of central Arizona were exploited for large-scale agriculture by Native Americans as early as the 11th century. The area that now encompasses Phoenix was a center of the Hohokam culture, which built large canal systems and a network of towns and villages, whose remains may be viewed in the city to this day. White settlers discovered the remnants of the Hohokam culture in the 19th century. The city's name reflects its history as a city "reborn from the ashes" of the previous settlement.

European-American settlement of the area commenced in the 1860s, and in 1911 the completion of the first of several large reservoirs in the mountains north and east of Phoenix insured its success as a center for irrigation-based agriculture. Many tens of thousands of acres were planted in citrus and cotton and other crops, and for many years, intensive, year-round irrigated agriculture formed the basis of the economy.  Recent years are seeing a revival, and trendy hotels, bars, shops and restaurants are making it a place to be again.

Mild and sunny winter weather also ensured a thriving tourism industry, and encouraged many Easterners and Midwesterners to relocate to Phoenix. High-tech industry began to flourish after World War II, and since that time the growth of Phoenix has been explosive.  As a result, a population of just over 100,000 in 1950 has given way to a 2006 estimate of 1,512,986 (with the metro area estimated at 4,039,182)[http://www.census.gov/population/www/estimates/metro_general/2006/CBSA-EST2006-01.csv].

Phoenix has a hot desert climate, typical for the southern part of Arizona and the Sonoran Desert. The city is known worldwide for its very hot summers, scarce precipitation and abundant sunshine, being the sunniest city on the planet with over 85% of daylight hours being sunny every year. 

'''Winter''': Winters in Phoenix are relatively mild when compared to most of the United States with highs that often reach and surpass 70˚F (21˚C). However don’t be fooled; the fact that Phoenix is located in the middle of a desert valley means that there is a large diurnal temperature variation which results in cool to cold nights between 40-50˚F (5-10˚C). There are a few days with lows around the mid-30s (3˚C) and the peripheral portions of the greater Phoenix metropolitan area do see frost sometimes (areas closer to the downtown are affected by the urban heat island effect thus making temperatures below 32˚F (0˚C) a very rare occurrence). Snow is also an extremely rare phenomenon having happened only 8 times since 1898. 

'''Spring''': Spring is pleasantly warm during its earliest phases (March until early April) with highs around 75˚F (25˚C). However at the beginning of April the first 90+˚F (32+˚C) days occur with the first 100˚F (38˚C) reading usually seen in mid to late May which is virtually part of summer 

'''Summer''': Phoenix’s summers are notorious around the country for their extreme heat with the city having the hottest average high temperature in the US. Daytime highs almost always surpass 100˚F (38˚C) from late May to late September and can occasionally reach even 110˚F (43˚C). The all-time record high of the city is 122˚F (50˚C). While it’s commonly referred to by the residents as dry heat (meaning that because there is little to no humidity it’s tolerable unlike the muggy weather of other major southern cities like Houston or Miami), it can still be a shock to first-time visitors. Unfortunately, due to the city’s buildings, pavements and roads trapping the warmth and releasing it through the night, lows frequently remain above 80˚F (27˚C) (although it may feel like heaven after day of being baked in the sun). Learn more about how to protect yourself and loved ones from the heat in the “Stay Safe” section. Phoenix is also affected by the '''North American Monsoon''' in July and August which, when active, raises humidity levels and can cause heavy localized precipitation, flash floods, hail, destructive winds, and dust storms-which can rise to the level of a haboob in some years.

'''Autumn''': Autumn is a short transitional season. September is virtually considered a part of summer with temperatures still rising above 100˚F (38˚C) while October can still be hot with many 90+˚F (32+˚C) readings. Novembers bears many similarities to March with cool nights and warm, sunny days.

==Talk==
English is the dominant language in Phoenix. However, like much of the [[Southwest (United States of America)|Southwest]] with a large Hispanic population, Spanish is very widely spoken in Phoenix.  Spanish is a language often used for day-to-day discourse in many places, although English is the language of preference, especially when dealing with businesses and government. It is considered polite or welcomed if you speak Spanish in Hispanic places of business or parts of town where Spanish is spoken more often. However, if you're not sure it is best to simply start with English. Don't assume that someone speaks Spanish based on their appearance as Arizona is a diverse state with a complex history. Arizona is home to a diverse range of Native American tribes with members of all living in Phoenix, most of whom speak English fluently.

It is served mainly by '''Allegiant Air''' [http://www.allegiantair.com/aaIndex.php].  Currently, this is a smaller-sized airport, but is in the process of being redeveloped into a major regional airport.

*'''Phoenix Deer Valley Airport''' ({{IATA|DVT}}) +1 623 869-0975 [http://phoenix.gov/deervalleyairport/], located just 15 mi (24 km) north of downtown, is the busiest general aviation airport in the U.S.

==== Private Aviation ====
The The Phoenix Metropolitan Area is home to some of the busiest general aviation fields in the United States, and there are more than 20 airports located within 50 nautical miles of Phoenix, AZ. [https://deervalleyairport.com/ '''Deer Valley Airport'''] is the most popular choice for business jets; it's also the busiest private airport in Arizona, and one of the most important business jet hubs in the country. Air charter companies including [https://valleyjet.com/ '''Valley Jet'''] and [http://www.phoenixjetcharter.com '''Phoenix Jet Charter'''] can arrange private flights with access to charetr planes based at all airports in the Phoenix-area. Other popular airports for private aviation include:

* [https://www.scottsdaleaz.gov/airport '''Scottsdale Airport'''] ({{IATA|SCF}}; {{FAA LID|SDL}})  It is located 9 miles north of downtown Scottsdale, AZ (15000 N. Airport Dr. Scottsdale, Az 85260)It's one of the busiest single-runway airports in the United States, and Signature Flight Support and Ross Aviation operate the two private terminals.
*[https://www.glendaleaz.com/airport/ '''Glendale Municipal Airport'''] ({{FAA LID|GEU}}) is located just west of the AZ-101 Loop and south of W Northern Ave, around 7 miles west of Glendale’s central business district in Maricopa County, AZ.

There are no commercial services at this airport, which is categorized by the FAA as a general aviation facility.

===By train===
Due to a dispute among the Arizona Department of Transportation, the Union Pacific Railroad, and Amtrak, passenger train service to Phoenix has been discontinued. Amtrak passengers may disembark at Maricopa, Arizona (25 mi/40 km south of Phoenix) and arrange their own travel into the city. No regular shuttle service currently exists. (Alternative: they may disembark at [[Flagstaff]] instead and take a bus into Phoenix from there. The Maricopa-Phoenix route, which uses taxi services, takes about an hour but one likely has to wait for the taxi after calling; the Flagstaff-Phoenix route takes three hours.) (Another alternative: disembark in [[Tucson]] and take a Greyhound bus into Phoenix; the Greyhound station in Tucson is about 5-6 blocks west of the Amtrak depot.)

===By car===
Interstate 10 enters Phoenix from the south and west, and Interstate 17 comes in from the north. US Route 60 is also a major route into Phoenix from the east. Arizona State Route 87 comes in from the northeast from Payson.

===By bus===
Unfortunately, there is no central bus terminal nor are they located next to each other in the same area. Each company have their own stop(s) or station all over the city.  Major operators include: 

*'''Amtrak''' [http://www.amtrak.com/] sells tickets to and from [[Flagstaff]] and the town of Maricopa which is 60mi/100km south of Phoenix. They offer thruway bus service from the airport and Greyhound station in the Phoenix area ONLY to Flagstaff for connection to the Southwest Chief train [http://www.amtrak.com/southwest-chief-train].  Passengers must arrange their own transportation to the Maricopa station for the Sunset Limited.

{{infobox|Renting a car like a local|The new Car Rental Facility for the Phoenix Airport is just west of the airport itself. National polls have shown that Phoenix is the 4th highest city in terms of surcharges in the nation. Car rental companies are required to add 29% (that's twenty-nine percent!) to your bill to pay for this state of the art building. Take a cab or the light rail to a local office of a car rental company. Do not tell them you are flying in. That way you are a "local rental" and do not have to pay some of the surcharges that are automatic if you rent at the car rental building at the airport. The surcharges finance everything from the local jails to the new Cardinals Stadium. The cab will likely be $25, but the surcharges for a $499 weekly rental will take your bill upwards of $650 and more. That cab looks a little cheaper now, doesn't it?

Alternatively, if you're doing a tour of the Southwest, consider flying into Las Vegas and renting your car there &mdash; the taxes are much lower and doing a one-way drop off to Phoenix is generally not a problem. There are car rental companies like Enterprise, Hertz, Avis and car rental brokers like rentalcars.com, travelauto.com where the car can be hired online.|print=fullpage}}

Phoenix is a very car-centered city. With the notable exception of the Light Rail (useful if you are staying in the Tempe/downtown Phoenix corridor, with a stop at the airport) public transit is rubbish and unreliable but if you have no other recourse it is do-able. If you plan to stay or visit any of the cities on the periphery of the metro area, a rental car will likely be required.  However, if you plan to stick to the Tempe-Downtown Phoenix area, the Light Rail is a viable option, with an all-day adult pass costing $4.00. Trains run every 12 minutes during peak periods and every 15 or 20 minutes during non-peak periods and weekends. The last train of the day starts its last trip of the day around 11:00PM on most days(finishing its run around 12:00) and 2:00AM on Fridays and Saturdays (finishing its run around 3:00AM). As DUI laws in Arizona are the strictest in the nation, its a good idea to take advantage of "the West's latest running train" when frequenting the bars and clubs in Downtown Phoenix or on Mill Avenue for some weekend fun. Taxis are typically fairly easy to find in proximity to major Light-Rail stops and in popular areas, and will run you from $10-15 for a fairly local trip to well over $100 for a ride to a distant suburb.

The Light Rail is always a much cheaper option than a cab for traveling to central Phoenix or Tempe from the Airport (cabs charge a flat $15 to make the trip). Take the new Skytrain (free)from your terminal to the Sky Harbor stop. Note that the terminal 3 stop is not yet open so you will have to take a shuttle buss. A single ride pass is $2. 

As a tourist, the bus line you are most likely to find useful is the 72 which directly connects downtown Tempe and downtown Scottsdale. It runs frequently throughout the day and can be caught from the Tempe transit center (Tempe->Scottsdale) or anywhere on Scottsdale Road (Scottsdale->Tempe). 

Surface roads are usually easy to navigate. The area's roads are designed around a grid system, where most roads are numbered based on their distance from the city center. Addresses also conform to the numbering of the roads around them.  Nearly all streets run with the compass directions, and there's a major thoroughfare every mile in each direction.  the road running east & west as '''Washington St''' divides the addresses & streets from "North" & "South" while the road going north & south as '''Central Ave''' divides the addresses & streets from "East" & "West". The numbered streets running north and south are "Avenues" (such as N 7th Ave) west of Central Ave and "Streets" (such as N 7th St) are east of Central Ave.  This also applies to the extended metro area, though addresses in some of the other cities OUTSIDE the Phoenix city limits like Tempe, Avondale, Goodyear, Chandler, Gilbert and Mesa have their own grid system within their own city limits and not based on downtown Phoenix or each other.

There is an extensive network of freeways, most built since 1987. Note: Heavy construction on some segments and interchanges continues. Check construction schedules and closures in the local media.

Drinking and driving is very heavily enforced in Phoenix, especially in Scottsdale and Tempe. Harsh DUI laws & police traps ensure you will most likely be pulled over during peak bar hours 11PM-2:30AM.  Mandatory jail time and extremely heavy fines make drinking and driving a very unwise decision in Maricopa County.

* '''Valley Metro''' [http://www.valleymetro.org/]. Extensive metropolitan bus system, and light rail line. The light rail line runs from north-central Phoenix, along the Central Ave. corridor, through downtown, past the airport, and to Tempe and Mesa. One-ride or all day passes may be purchased at varying prices depending on service and location; but generally range from $0.85 to $7.25, with the highest being an all-day pass purchased on an Express Bus.

* '''Car rental''' is the most convenient form of transportation for visitors, with local companies offering better prices but national chains offering more convenience vis-a-vis return policies and times. At the airport the car rental companies have their own (shared) terminal at 1805 E Sky Harbor Circle [http://skyharbor.com/transportationparking/rentalcars.html].  From the airport terminals there are shuttle buses going there & back.  [http://www.sixt.com/car-rental/usa/phoenix/phoenix-sky-harbor-intairport Sixt Car Hire]

* '''Car Hire''' In America the term "car hire" refers to hiring a driver & the car, an expensive proposition.  For just the car you drive yourself it's referred to as "car rental".  See above.  Unlike most cities, in Phoenix you can get a sedan, SUV or even a limo to pick you up for about the same price as a cab.  People do this if they're staying put at a resort such as the Arizona Biltmore for their entire stay in the area and just need a ride there and back.  Not economical if requiring to move around. Ride-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft are also available in Phoenix.

===Professional Sports===
Unfortunately professional sports events are pricing themselves out of the pocket of the average traveler. There are still $10 seats at the Diamondbacks games, not available until 2 hours before the game. Definitely not the best seats, but worth visiting the downtown Phoenix ballpark- which was built at a cost of $357 million in time for the 1998 season. 

Spring Training Cactus League is a great way to see Major League Baseball in a relaxed atmosphere. 15 teams prepare for the regular season at 10 stadiums across the valley. Teams typically report for their first workouts around the second week of February; games happen daily typically late February through late March.

The Arizona Fall League hosts some of the best young minor league baseball players receiving additional experience after their regular season ends. Played at spring training stadiums in Mesa, Scottsdale, Salt River, Peoria, Glendale, and Surprise. Considering the advanced level of baseball talent on display, tickets are a bargain at $8 per person, or $85 for a season pass which gives a fan access to every game. Early October to mid November.

State Farm Stadium (home of the National Football League's Arizona Cardinals and the annual Fiesta Bowl college football game, among other events) is worth a visit. Originally designed to resemble a coiled snake, it looks more like a giant spaceship by the 
side of the Loop 101 freeway in Glendale. Built at the bargain price of $427 million in 2006.

==Buy==
Time-honored souvenirs from Phoenix are '''scorpion bolo ties''' and '''saguaro-cactus salt and pepper shakers'''.  Look for them at various gift shops in Terminal 3 and 4 of Sky Harbor International Airport. These gift shops are also known to stock the ever-popular Cactus Candy and a wide variety of hot sauces.

===Groceries and other basics===

The major supermarket chains in Phoenix are Fry's (which is owned by Kroger), Safeway, WinCo, Albertsons, and Bashas'. In addition the nation's largest discount store chain, Walmart, has several stores in Phoenix most of which are also open 24 hours and some WinCo and Fry's stores in Phoenix are also open 24 hours as well. In addition many specialty and organic supermarkets such as Whole Foods Market, Sprouts Farmers Market, and Trader Joe's can also be found throughout the area.

==Eat==

For cheap eats, look out for many 24-hour Mexican food places such as '''Filiberto's''', '''Raliberto's''' and other restaurants offer a burrito the size of your forearm. Due to recent inflation, prices at these restaurants have increased significantly to about the $9 range, however.

'''Mexican'''
Carolina's. 4 locations, Peoria, Mesa, N Phoenix (Cave Creek/Cactus), Central Phoenix (12th St/Mojave). Excellent mexican food, friendly service, good prices, well prepared.

==Drink==

Phoenix as a metropolitan area offers a considerable amount of nightlife, though with the fact that the city is so spread out it can be difficult and dangerous to attempt traversing the city on a big night out.  Generally, the nightlife is centered around the sub-cities of the metro area.  Within Phoenix itself bars tend to cluster within the Uptown, Downtown, and Roosevelt areas, while Scottsdale offers a lively bar and club scene and Tempe is popular with students given the proximity to the University.  and the city centers for Chandler and Glendale both offer some good options if you're in the suburbs.  Downtown Mesa lacks any appreciable nightlife given its strong ties to the Mormon church.

==Stay safe==
===Crime===
Despite being a nice vacation destination, Phoenix is a major American city and as such does contain a fair amount of violent crime. Some parts of the city (and even a few parts of some of the suburbs) should be avoided at night. Although the central city used to have a somewhat deserved reputation for dangerousness, extensive public and private investment in urban core in recent years has made the area among the safest places in the Valley: as a general rule, the area bounded by the Union Pacific railroad tracks just south of the Chase Field up to Camelback Road and Between Seventh Street and Seventh Avenue is both safe and walkable. South of the railroad tracks is South Phoenix which can be unsafe in some areas. 

Maryvale, a commercial/residential district on the west side of the city of Phoenix (extending north into Glendale as well), has a somewhat rough reputation. 

Most of the suburban areas are safe during day and night; however, parts of Mesa and Glendale can be dangerous at night. Some portions of Tempe, near the main campus of Arizona State University (ASU), have seen assaults in the recent past on a few university students. The ASU campus is equipped with several emergency call boxes.

The Sunnyslope area (north central city of Phoenix) has some homeless and other crime issues but a new police station was recently built at Peoria and 7th Ave which has dramatically reduced crime.

The town of Guadalupe (immediately west of Tempe and bounded by Interstate 10 on the west) is unsafe at night, but is an incredibly interesting Hispanic/Native American community to visit during the day. Be warned though that the speed limit suddenly falls from 40mph to 25mph as you enter the town.

In every portion of the Phoenix area, just use common sense and be aware of your surroundings. 

The carrying of concealed firearms is legal in the State of Arizona without a permit.

Phoenix also has one of the highest car theft rates in the country, with a car stolen every 7 minutes. Always lock your car and remove all valuables or hide them in the glove box or trunk.

===Traffic Safety===

Red light running is more common in Phoenix than any other city in the country. When the light turns green, always double check to be sure someone isn't entering the intersection from another direction.

Be aware of traffic and speed enforcement cameras at most major intersections.  Always anticipate someone attempting to beat the amber light before it turns red to avoid being issued a very expensive traffic ticket (usually in the amount of $300 or more). If you see sudden braking, make sure you're going the speed limit. Sometimes, camera vans are set up on the side of the road to snatch speeders, especially in the Northeastern parts of the Valley.

Speeding, tailgating and aggressive driving are common on the freeways.

While there have been recent, and initially successful, efforts to use technology to reduce incidents of wrong way driving on Arizona freeways, the rate of such incidents has been increasing in recent years.  Most wrong way crashes occur during the late night hours (midnight - 4am), happen on weekends, and are fueled by alcohol. Avoid driving in the left lane on freeways during the late night hours, as the (usually impaired) wrong way driver sees this as the right lane/slow lane.

===Valley Fever===

Coccidioidomycosis (Valley Fever) is endemic to the Valley, and is a dust-dwelling fungus that gets kicked up during dust storms. Most people either don't exhibit symptoms or have a respiratory illness resembling a bad cold, but rarely one can develop a disseminated infection involving the bones, meninges, joints, or connective tissues. This severe illness is more likely to occur in people of African, Asian, Filipino, Hispanic, and Native American descent, and is least likely to occur in European (white) peoples. Immunocompromised individuals (HIV/AIDS, etc) are at particular risk for a severe, disseminated infection. It is incredibly difficult to treat once it sets. If you become ill after your trip to the Valley let your doctor know you were in an area where cocci is endemic. It is better than nothing to stay inside during a dust storm if you are worried about cocci, or to wear a paper mask, but realistically you will inhale no small amount of dust no matter what you do. If you are traveling with your dog be advised dogs can also develop a severe cocci infection, as they tend to huff and roll about in the dirt; it is a common cause of morbidity and mortality among Valley dogs. Again, if your dog falls ill shortly after visiting the Valley, let their veterinarian know where you have been traveling.

===Heat Safety===

The Phoenix area is well known for its extremely hot temperatures during the summer months. Avoid any type of outdoor exertion during the hottest part of the day, which could start as early as 8am during the late spring through early fall. Fire department rescues are a common occurrence on valley hiking trails during the warmer months due to heat exhaustion and heat stroke, and if you need to be rescued you can plan on being featured on the evening news. A recent change in the law has made bringing pets on Phoenix hiking trails illegal when the outside temperature is over 100 degrees F (38 degrees C). Wear sunscreen if you're going to be outside more than a few minutes, drink plenty of water, and limit intake of caffeinated and alcoholic beverages. This includes carrying extra drinking water in your car in case of a breakdown or crash. Do not ever leave a child or pet inside a parked car, and if the pavement is too hot to walk barefoot, it's too hot for your pet's paws.

===Thunderstorms===

The presence of the North American monsoon brings with it the threat of thunderstorms, typically between July and September. Common hazards are frequent lightning, briefly flooded roadways, and dust storms reducing visibility to just a few feet. In the Phoenix area monsoon thunderstorms are most common during the late afternoon and evening hours, but can occasionally last overnight and into the next morning if the air mass is particularly moist and unstable. If you see a dust storm approaching pull as far off the roadway as you can (into a parking lot is best), turn off your lights, and keep your foot off the brake pedal. Then wait until the dust moves on and visibility improves. Keeping your lights off prevents anyone behind you from thinking you're moving forwards and possibly hitting you. If you come upon a flooded roadway, it is best to turn around and find another route. Trying to drive through may cause your vehicle's engine to ingest water and stall, or cause your car to float away. It takes as little as 18 inches of moving water to wash away a car/pickup truck. Again, if you need to be rescued, you will likely be featured on the evening news, and you may be required to pay for the cost of being rescued.

===Gay and Lesbian Travelers===

The area around Central and Camelback in Phoenix has many gay residents and gay-friendly businesses. 7th Ave and Camelback is the unofficial "gay district" and you can see many gay pride flags hanging from businesses. Phoenix and neighboring Scottsdale and Tempe tend to be quite progressive, but know that many suburbs of Phoenix are considered some of the most conservative areas in the country, so expect many looks and maybe insulting remarks in these areas.

==Get out==

* Small towns [[Cave Creek]] and [[Carefree]] lie just north of the city.
* Several large reservoirs provide water recreation within an hour of Phoenix. Lake Pleasant is 35 miles north of downtown Phoenix off State Route 74. Bartlett Lake is about 55 miles northeast off of Cave Creek Rd and Bartlett Dam Rd. Saguaro Lake (off Bush Highway), Canyon Lake, and Apache Lake (both off State Route 88/"The Apache Trail" - part dirt) are all located in the Superstition Mountains a few miles east of Mesa. The Salt River (which forms these three lakes) is a popular destination for float tubing during the summer. A bit farther up the Salt River is Lake Roosevelt, the largest reservoir entirely located within Arizona (off State Route 188).
* If you would like to see areas outside of the Phoenix metropolitan area, you might want to visit [[Tucson]], [[Las Vegas]], or [[San Diego]].  For cooler weather, head up to I-17 to [[Flagstaff]] or [[Sedona]].
* A good option for a day trip, or longer, out of Phoenix is a drive north to [[Sedona]].  If you have three days or more, head out to [[Phoenix to Las Vegas by car|Las Vegas via Monument Valley and the Grand Canyon]].
* Montezuma Castle National Monument (cliff dwelling), located near Camp Verde, Arizona is on I-17 between Phoenix and [[Flagstaff]] 
* Hiking near Phoenix is popular due to central Arizona's climate and large tracts of public land. Several designated National Forest and BLM wilderness areas are within easy driving distance and offer treks ranging from day hikes to multi-day backpacking trips. South Mountain Park, within the city limits, is a popular destination to experience the Sonoran Desert on foot.
* '''Camelback Mountain''' - very popular hike in central Phoenix. Great views from top. Two routes: 
** Echo Canyon (West entry - McDonald/Tatum). Arrive early on weekends for trailhead parking (50 cars), or walk 1/2 mi to satellite parking. Do not park on the street; you will be ticketed and possibly towed. 1.25 mile one way steep hike. 
** East entry (Invergorden/Jackrabbit). Park 1/2 mi from trailhead on 64th St. Slightly longer route (1.5 mile one way), skirts Phoenician (Keating resort), less developed.
* '''Piestewa Peak''' (Lincoln Dr/20th St) - Arrive early on weekends. Good parking close to trailhead. 1.25 mi hike (easier than Camelback Mtn). Great views (just 3 mi from Camelback Mtn). Park of Phoenix Preserve (48th St to 7th Ave), lots of good hiking and mountain biking. Dogs allowed on trail 300 from the parking lot. Previously known as Squaw Peak.
