'''Coimbatore''' [http://www.coimbatore.tn.nic.in/tourism.html] is a major industrial city in [[Tamil Nadu]], often likened to being the Manchester or Detroit of [[Southern India]]. It's famous for the manufacture of motor pump sets and varied engineering goods.

==Understand==

Coimbatore is known for its various industries, engineering goods, textile mills, educational institutions, health care facilities, dry-hot weather, friendly culture and hospitality. There is a significant minority of people from Northern and Western India in Coimbatore which gives it the "local Indian-cosmopolitan" outlook. The [[Tamil phrasebook | Tamil]] spoken here is called Kongu Tamil. Other languages spoken include English, [[Malayalam phrasebook | Malayalam]], [[Telugu  phrasebook | Telugu]] and [[Kannada]]. Very friendly & courteous people in South India. During Summer (Feb-May) it is very hot, the rest of the year has a manageable hot climate throughout the year. It's one of the upcoming Information Technology Hub with new initiatives from the State Govt. The locals claim they have the world's second tastiest water "Siruvani Water" after Nile, no official or scientific proof for this claim though.
Coimbatore is an orthodox city. It has developed in terms of wealth, however the general populace is still down to earth. People here don't have a flashy lifestyle, they are generally very content. Most of all the Coimbatoreans are known for the respect displayed in Tamil language towards everyone.
