[[Image:BingPan.png|thumb|Downtown Binghamton]]
Binghamton has many fantastic examples of Romanesque Revival Architecture in the city's center and is known as the Parlor City for this and for its collection of ornate mansions and nice homes. The Binghamton area is also the Carousel Capital of America, home to 6 of the remaining 150 antique carousels in the nation. Other historic attractions are the Roberson Museum, Kopernik Space Center, and the Ross Park Zoo. <br> Both Rod Serling and the regional sandwich known as the "spiedie" were born here. They are celebrated at the annual Rod Serling Video Fest and the Spiedie Fest and Balloon Rally, respectively. Despite Binghamton location as the urban core of the region, it has been named a Tree City by the National Arbor Day Foundation for many years, and has been ranked as the 9th best Green City by Better Homes and Gardens. The city has also achieved international recognition as a finalist for Philips Livable Cities Award for its Design Your Own Park program. 

The city is also home of The State University of New York at Binghamton (aka Binghamton University) [http://www.binghamton.edu], which acts as an athletic, academic, and cultural center for the city.

The City of Binghamton is divided into seven neighborhoods.

*City Center

This is the region's administrative, business, entertainment and transportation center. It is located at the confluence of the Susquehanna and Chenango Rivers south of the Norfolk Southern rail tracks and west of the Brandywine Highway. Generally, the city is characterized by commercial properties and several high-rise apartments towards the rivers with lower class single- and multifamily dwellings towards the highway. There are several areas of urban blight, most notably along the Brandywine industrial spine.   

Downtown Binghamton is notable for its architecture and is the site of the Court Street Historic District. This district contains many historic buildings (89 in total) from the turn of the previous century, of which the Press Building and the Security Mutual Building are the most notable. A number of buildings on the National Register by famed architect Isaac G Perry are located here as well, including the Perry Block, the Broome County Courthouse, and the Phelps Mansion. 

*Westside

Located across the Chenango River from Downtown. This area is largely residential and its character ranges from urban to suburban.  In general, the area between Seminary Avenue and the Susquehanna River is inhabited by middle to upper-class residents, while the area north of Seminary Avenue to the First Ward is inhabited by working-class residents and students from the neighboring colleges. There is a commercial corridor along Main St with mostly light commercial facilities and a couple of large plazas. Binghamton High School, location of the Helen Foley Theater, is located here, just across the Court St bridge from Downtown. Lourdes Hospital can also be found here.

Despite its residential character a number of historic and architecturally significant buildings can be found on the Westside. The Roberson Museum, the Gen. Edward F. Jones House, and the Abel Bennett Tract can be found here, to name but a few. 

*Southside

The Southside refers to the area of the city south of the Susquehanna River. It varies from upper-class homes in the western and southern portion to mostly middle class everywhere else. There is a small commercial center at the southern end of the S Washington St bridge including a variety of light commercial and restaurants and is also the site of Binghamton General Hospital. More light commercial and some light industrial can be found along parts of Conklin Ave, with more industry the further east one travels. 

The Southside is also home to the Ross Park Zoo and the Discovery Center. 

*Eastside

The Eastside lies east of the downtown area along the north bank of the Susquehanna River. It is mostly characterized by the Brandywine Industrial Spine, a region of heavy industry and urban blight that separates it from the rest of the city. Beyond this the neighborhood is largely working class, with various shops and restaurants concentrated on Robinson St. Rt 11, or Upper Court St as it is known once it passes under the Brandywine, is more commercial in nature, with several strip malls and home to most of the regions adult entertainment outlets. 

The original Dicks Sporting Goods store is still in operation here, it can be found on Upper Court St a little past the Salvation Army. The area is also home to the New York State Inebriate Asylum, the first mental health facility to treat alcoholism as a disease. It too was designed by Isaac Perry and is listed on both the State and National historic registers. 

*Northside

The Northside is located just north of downtown across the Norfolk Southern rail tracks. It is characterized by large sections of commercial activity just north of downtown and along Chenango St. The rest of the area is residential, mostly working class single family homes. 

*First Ward

The First Ward is largely a residential neighborhood. It occupies the area west of the Chenango River between the Norfolk Southern tracks I86/Rt 17. There are several notable Victorian style mansions along front street that have been transformed into mutli-family dwellings, but beyond that the First Ward is mostly known for Antique Row, located along Clinton St. Many portions of this street are blight, particularly toward Front St, but what is left has been turned into numerous antique shops. The Tri-Cities Opera can also be found on Clinton St.  

*Ely Park

Ely Park is the area west of the Chenango River and north of I86/Rt 17. It is generally residential and is primarily known for the municipal golf course and the government subsidized housing project of the same name located here.

===Greater Binghamton===

While the Binghamton Metropolitan Statistical area includes all Broome and Tioga Counties, the area referred to as Greater Binghamton is much less defined. Generally, it refers to the larger region of conurbation surrounding the city of Binghamton, from Kirkwood in the east to Endicott in the west and includes the following list of towns and villages. Most of these communities are considered to be small suburbs or bedroom communities with a couple of thousand residents, however, there is an exceptionally high level of integration between them, so much so that most outsiders will not realize they have crossed a municipal line. Many natives, even, will have trouble distinguishing where one community ends and another begins. Ultimately, these communities are only meaningful within the region itself, as the entire area is known as 'Binghamton' to the outside world. 

*Chenango Bridge

A small suburb of Binghamton, it is located the furthest north along the Chenango River. It is notable for the Rt 12A bridge across the river. 

*Conklin

Located just east of Binghamton along the Susquehanna River. Its industrial park is home to several major employers in the area including L-3 Communications, Universal Instruments, and Frito Lay. There is a small castle built as a residence by Alpheus Corby in 1900. It currently houses several of the town offices. 

*Endwell

A generally upscale residential suburb sandwiched between Endicott and Johnson City and across the Susquehanna from Vestal. It is home to Highland Park and its well known Fourth of July fireworks display, as well as several golf courses and the IBM Glen. Traditions at the Glen Spa and Resort can be found here. 

*Endicott
*Hillcrest

Located north of Binghamton on the east bank of the Chenango river; it is between Port Dickinson and Chenango Bridge. This is a small residential suburb. 

*Johnson City

Part of the 'Triple Cities' (although, again just a village), Johnson City is one of the major communities in the region. The village immediatly borders and is indistinguishable from Binghamton's west side. One of the regions main shopping centers, the Oakdale Mall can be found here, as can the Endicott-Johnson Industrial Spine, a 230 acre area of industrial ruins that is slowly being revitalized. There are many small shops along Main St in Johnson City's center. 

*Port Dickinson

Located north of Binghamton on the opposite side of the river from Hillcrest. Broome Community College can be found here, as can Otseningo Park: home of the Spedie Fest and Balloon Rally. Port Dickinson (Port Dick) is largely residential in the immediate vicinity of BCC, however, further north is the Upper Front Street commercial district. This is a smaller version of the 'Parkway' in Vestal and contains many shops, restaurants,  plazas, and strip malls. A few of the bigger chain stores can be found here such as Lowes and Regal Cinemas, one of the regions two multi-screen movie theaters. Port Dick is also home to Sam the Beer Man. 

*Vestal

Vestal occupies all of the southern bank of the Susquehanna River west of Binghamton. This is the regions commercial center, with many large plazas, strip malls, shopping centers, and most of the regions big box stores built along the Vestal Parkway. There is also a lot of heavier industry and a sewage treatment plant located along Old Vestal Rd. Upper-class residential areas are built along the hillsides and hilltops to the south. The western part of Vestal, known as 'Four Corners' is home to the Vestal schools (ranked among the highest in the Greater Binghamton region) and has more of a small town character, with small shops along Front St and middle class neighborhoods. The Parkway (NY-434) is one of the areas busiest roadways along with NY-201 which is a very urban, but quite short freeway which runs To/from the Binghamton University region of Vestal to Oakdale Mall north of the Susquehana River. The NY-201 and NY-17 (Southern Tier Expressway) interchange is the largest and arguably the busiest in the region.

*West Corners

Located just north of Endicott along Rt 26, this is generally considered the furthest westward extent of the Greater Binghamton region. There is a small shopping plaza surrounded by residential areas. West Corners is only notable for being home to the nationally recognized Phil's Chicken House.

Binghamton has a humid continental climate with 4 distinct seasons and is well known for its gloomy weather. On sunny days, it is common to hear locals remark on the absurdity of sunlight in Binghamton: "What is this crazy yellow orb and why does it hurt my eyes so?" This doesn't happen often though considering Binghamton averages 152 sunny days a years. Binghamton also has a reputation as one of the rainiest cities in America. Its not, it only gets about 36in a year, but it does average 161 days of precipitation so it can certainly seem like it. 

'''Spring''' weather in Binghamton is often very unsettled, especially early on. Snowstorms in late April, although uncommon, are not unheard of. Often times, snow is preceded or followed by warm weather... sometimes in the same day! Spring flooding is common and the rivers are often elevated through the entire season as first snow melts and then heavy rains come. Rainy days, are no more common than the rest of the year but are often heavier. However, once the unsettled weather of March and April is over, the weather is often fantastic with warm, pleasant days and the scent of myriad spring blooms filling the air. 
 
'''Summer''' is generally not too hot, with temperatures often in the low to mid 80's. However they tend to be very humid, often oppressively so, and are best described as 'swampy'. Humidity tends to be worse in August and in the afternoon when temperatures are highest. Frequently the humidity will stay elevated for days at a time with no break, and often gets worse at night, making sleep uncomfortable without air conditioning. Swarms of enormous mosquitoes patrol the city on these days and have been known to carry off cats and small dogs. 

'''Fall''' can be one of the most beautiful seasons in Binghamton and not just for the scenery. The humidity generally breaks in mid September and temperatures will usually remain pleasantly warm right up until it snows... usually on Halloween. 

'''Winter''' tends to be cold, snowy, and unpredictable. Some years are subject to repeated freeze/thaw cycles that leave the city covered in a thick layer of hard packed snow and ice. Other years, it starts snowing and never stops, with each new storm packing the snow underneath into a thick layer of hard packed snow and ice. See the trend here? The city is perfectly situated to take advantage of both lake-effect snows off the Great Lakes and Nor'Easters coming in off the Atlantic (a Nor'Easter is like a hurricane, only with snow instead of rain). However, the cities distance from the Lakes and the barrier formed by the Appalachian Mountains tends to limit these to only a foot or two at a time. The Public Works Dept does a passable job of keeping the highways clear, but in recent years has done a terrible job on city streets, with some streets not getting plowed at all until days after the storm has passed.

To the east, it skirts the [[Catskills|Catskill Mountains]] and I-86 ends at I-87 in the [[Hudson_Valley|Hudson Valley region]], but 17 turns south and eventually ends in New Jersey.

==Get around==

[[Image:BCTransitOverview.jpg|thumb|Combined map of the BC Transit bus routes in Greater Binghamton]]

Public transportation in Greater Binghamton and outlying areas is served by BC Transit, a service of the Broome County Department of Transportation [http://www.gobroomecounty.com/transit/]. Transit options are not limited to the local fixed-routes buses. BC Country provides transportation in outlying areas but must be arraigned in advance. BC Lift and OFA Mini-bus provide direct pickup for disabled and elderly residents who register with the Transportation Dept. 

Taxis are plentiful in the city but generally have to be called for a pickup. There are a few areas, such as State Street late at night, major shopping areas (e.g. Walmart), and the airport where they congregate uncalled, but this is the exception rather than the rule. Taxi companies do not require you to call ahead, except at certain peak times (such as late Friday and Saturday nights) they can usually have a car to you in 15 minutes or less.

Bicycle routes exist but are limited. There are several streets with designated bike lanes, and several more with markings to warn drivers of possible bicycle traffic. However, bicycle transportation is not common, an many drivers, while not hostile, seem unsure of how to handle bike traffic.   

Students at Binghamton University are also served by OCCT (Off-Campus College Transport) [http://www.occtransport.com/].

===Highways and Roads===

[[Image:I-81.png|22px]] Interstate 81
*I-81 is a north-south federal highway that passes through the central and southeastern part of Greater Binghamton. 

[[Image:I-88.png|25px]] Interstate 88 
*The Senator Warren M. Anderson Expressway/Susquehanna Expressway. It is a direct link from Binghamton to [[Albany_(New_York)|Albany]].

[[Image:Future_I-86.png|22px]] Interstate 86
*I-86 is an upgrade of the existing New York State Route 17. Known as the Southern Tier Expressway, the route will connect Interstate 90 with Interstate 87 (New York State Thruway). Construction generally takes place on small sections at a time with a great deal of the upgrade already completed. Major projects that remain are Kamikaze Curve (the I-81/I-86 interchange) and eastern stretch through the [[Catskills|Catskill Mountains]]. 

[[Image:US_11.png|22px]] U.S. Route 11
*US 11 is paralleled by I-81 for most of its route and Binghamton is no exception. US 11 is also a north-south route through the central and southeastern part of the city, however US 11 goes right through the city rather than around it. US 11 follows Court St through downtown, then turns north onto Front St after crossing the Court St bridge. 

[[Image:NY-7.png|22px]] New York State Route 7
*Parallels US 11 on the south bank of the Susquehanna River from the [[Pennsylvania|PA]] border until it turns north at the Tompkins St bridge. Conklin Ave runs concurrently with NY 7 for much of its length. It is known as the Brandywine Highway from the Tompkins St bridge until it intersects I-88. 

[[Image:NY-12.png|22px]] New York State Route 12
*Bears mentioning mostly because it begins in the Greater Binghamton region, it diverges from US 11 just north of Port Dickinson. Upper Front St continues along NY 12 for a mile or two north. NY 12A diverges from here to the community of Chenango Bridge. 

[[Image:NY-17.png|22px]] New York State Route 17
*FUTURE [[Image:I-86.png|22px]] Interstate 86
*NY 17 is an important route in the area, serving as the main east-west travel axis in the Greater Binghamton region. Traffic can be heavy during rush hours but generally moves along at speed without problems. 

[[Image:NY-17C.png|25px]] New York State Route 17C
*NY 17C is the old NY 17 route. It travels west to east into Greater Binghamton from Owego and is Main St for most of the communities it passes through. It terminates at Front St in Binghamton, but the road continues across the Court St bridge and becomes, oddly enough, Court St. 

[[Image:NY-26.png|22px]] New York State Route 26
*The major north-south route on the western end of the Greater Binghamton region. It starts at the [[Pennsylvania|PA]] border south of Vestal and travels north to Endicott, West Corners, and beyond. 

[[Image:NY-201.png|25px]] New York State Route 201
*Known as the 201 Flyover. It is a short, north-south highway that connects the major shopping districts on Harry L Drive (including the Oakdale Mall) and the Vestal Parkway with NY 17C and I-86/NY 17. This is one of the most heavily traveled bridges across the Susquehanna and traffic can easily grind to a halt on the southbound lane during rush hours due to poor design. Construction is currently underway to replace the NY 434 interchange and improve traffic flow. Traffic has not been affected much yet, but it may be wise to seek alternate routes.  

[[Image:NY-363.png|25px]] New York State Route 363 
* Known locally as North Shore Drive, it is a short, north-south limited-access highway that bypasses downtown Binghamton and links NY 434 to NY 7.

[[Image:NY-434.png|25px]] New York State Route 434
*Generally called the Vestal Parkway between the Binghamton city line and the NY 26 overpass, this road is heavily traveled and best avoided when at all possible. The section between Bunn Hill Rd and African Rd is almost all plazas and strip malls and is very congested at all times. 

====Important Local Roads====

*'''Chenango Street''' Main thoroughfare through Binghamton/Port Dick/Hillcrest on the east bank of the Chenango River.
*'''Clinton Street''' Main thoroughfare through the First Ward in Binghamton. Home to Antique Row.
*'''Conklin Ave''' Main thoroughfare through Binghamton/Conklin on the south bank of the Susquehanna River. 
*'''Court Street''' Main thoroughfare through Binghamton east of the Chenango River.
*'''Floral Ave''' Largely residential. It connects Main Street in Binghamton to the Traffic Circle. 
*'''Front Street''' Main thoroughfare through Binghamton/Port Dick on the west bank of the Chenango River.
*'''Hooper Road''' Main thoroughfare through Endwell. 
*'''Main Street''' Once was the major connecting road of the Triple Cities  (Binghamton, Endicott, and Johnson City) and served as the commercial heart of each. Many unique small shops can still be found in each of their respective shopping districts. 
*'''Old Vestal Road''' Once was the main east/west thoroughfare through Vestal. It now serves as an alternative to the Vestal Parkway, but can become congested with other people seeking to do the same. 
*'''Riverside Drive''' Main thoroughfare through Binghamton/Johnson City along the north bank of the Susquehanna River. Notable for the number of large, historic residences along its length.

====Other Locations====

[[Image:KamikazeCurve.png|thumb|Aerial photograph of the infamous Kamikaze Curve]]

*'''Traffic Circle''' In Johnson City, connects Floral Ave, Riverside Drive, and NY 201.
*'''Kamikaze Curve''' The I-81/I-86/NY 17 interchange. This dangerous interchange is a modification of the normal Direction-T form with the interchange built as a three-level crossover directly over the Chenango River. While highly disconcerting, this is not inherently dangerous (discounting the ice that forms on the bridge during winter). The danger mostly comes from the sharp curve I-86/NY 17 makes around Prospect Mountain immediately preceding/following the interchange. In all directions, there is very little warning about how sharp the curve is and, with I-81 intersecting on the curve, it can be difficult to merge. However, the eastbound lane on I-86/NY 17 compounds this by giving very little advanced notice of the interchange layout. To further complicate an already dangerous situation, the interchange itself is located at the bottom of the hill, around a very tight banked corner, so oncoming drivers (who are very likely driving too fast for the corner already)  cannot see the interchange until they have rounded the corner and it is right in front of them. This leads to many instances of vehicles suddenly barreling across multiple lanes of traffic to get in the correct lane. All of this is further complicated by the heavy 18-wheeler traffic on the road. Kamikaze Curve is a major portion of the I-86 Upgrade. The curve itself will be straightened out to highway standards, and traffic will be separated prior to entering the curve. Other upgrade will include replacement of the bridges and movement of the Front St exit currently located on the curve. Signage will also be improved to reduce driver confusion. Construction was slated to have begun by 2007, however, there have been many delays due to funding. Construction is currently expected to begin in 2012.

The city's history has been strongly influenced by German, Italian, and Polish immigrants; with many today coming from Eastern Europe, Latin America, and India.
