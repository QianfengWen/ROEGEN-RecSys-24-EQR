'''Gander''' [http://www.gandercanada.com] is a town located in [[Central Newfoundland]] in [[Canada]]'s [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] province, approximately 40 kilometers (25 mi) south of Gander Bay, 100 km (62 mi) south of Twillingate and 90 km (56 mi) east of Grand Falls-Windsor. Located on the northeastern shore of Gander Lake, it is the site of Gander International Airport, formerly an important refueling point for transatlantic aircraft, and, to this day, a preferred stopping point for transatlantic aircraft that need to land because of on-board medical or security emergencies. 

Most of the streets in Gander are named after famous aviators, including Amelia Earhart, Alcock and Brown, Charles Lindbergh, Eddie Rickenbacker, Marc Garneau and Chuck Yeager.

It has an international airport that was once a major refueling point for almost all trans-Atlantic flights.

It was also one major transit point for the WWII ferry command; the other was [[Goose Bay]], Labrador.

==Get in==

'''Gander International Airport''' (YQX) [http://www.ganderairport.com] is served by Air Canada and Sunwing Airlines, with daily flights from [[St. John's]] and [[Halifax (Nova Scotia)|Halifax]].  

Gander is also located on '''Trans-Canada Highway 1''', 330 km west of St. John's and 570 km east of [[Port Aux Basques]].

Gander is a short drive from the Gander International Airport (only 3.2 km). If you have rented a car at the airport, head northwest on Circular Road for approximately 0.9 km. Turn left onto Garrett Drive and continue for 0.7 km. Turn right onto James Blvd and continue for 0.8 km. James Blvd now becomes Airport Blvd (Cooper Blvd or Road 330 is what separates them), so continue straight on for another 0.8 km. You will see the Fraser Shopping Mall on your left hand side. Make a left turn on Elizabeth Drive which will bring you in the heart of Gander. 

Newfoundland and Labrador is served by both scheduled airlines and charter services, and can be reached via national and international connections. Our province is home to two international airports – located in St. John's and Gander – as well as domestic airports in Deer Lake, Stephenville, St. Anthony in Newfoundland, and Happy Valley-Goose Bay, Churchill Falls and Wabush in Labrador. These airports are destinations for many major airlines, including Air Canada, WestJet, Porter, and United, as well as the locally owned and operated Provincial Airlines.

==Get around==

There are a number of ways to get around Newfoundland and Labrador that promise scenic views and an adventure at every corner. You can travel by land, either by driving or taking a bus, or by sea, using our intra-provincial ferry system. Or travel by air, a great option if you have a lot to see in a short amount of time.

Newfoundland and Labrador is a vast place with lots of open country, so it’s important to remember if you want to travel around, you need to plan ahead – whether that means renting a car in advance, booking a ferry crossing or booking a short flight. For example, to drive across the island from St. John’s on the east coast to Corner Brook on the west takes approximately eight hours including a stop for lunch. 


'''Mobile App'''

The Newfoundland & Labrador Travel Guide app is a free, invaluable, on-the-ground resource for your iPhone or iPad. It’s a way to carry travel information in your pocket as you explore the province. With smart searches, GPS capabilities, interactive mapping, news updates, and immediate visitor information, you’ll feel at ease and ‘in the know’ at the same time. While tourism operator information is always accessible (even in remote areas), map functions, live weather, and social media updates require a Wi-Fi connection or cellular service. 

To download this free app, please visit http://www.newfoundlandlabrador.com/PlanYourTrip/GettingAround


'''By Land'''

There’s really no better way to get the lay of the land and soak up the scenery than to travel here and around by road. Whether you plan to rent a car (be sure to book in advance!) or RV for your stay, or bring your own, you’ll find some tools below to help plan your adventure. Again, remember, the province is large and driving across it requires planning, a realistic budget and time/schedule management. For more information consult the driving distances page.

All main highway routes in Newfoundland are paved, with a few short and well-maintained gravel side roads. Most coastal roads are paved with posted speed limits of 60-100 kph. In Labrador, Route 510 is paved from L’Anse au Clair to Red Bay and is gravel beyond that to Happy Valley-Goose Bay. Route 500 between Happy-Valley Goose Bay, Labrador City and Wabush is mainly gravel and connects to Quebec Route 389. The Trans-Canada Highway spans the island of Newfoundland from Port aux Basques to St. John’s.

All drivers must carry a valid Driver’s Licence, Vehicle Registration Certificate and Proof of Liability Insurance Coverage. Newfoundland and Labrador was the first Canadian province to prohibit the use of cellphones while driving. 



'''Charter Services'''

In addition to our international and domestic airports, there are airstrips in remote areas of the province that are served by small, operator-owned aircraft. Several charter aircraft also specialize in serving remote hunting and fishing lodges. 



'''Book ahead of time'''

Make sure to make as many of your travel and accommodation reservations well in advance as demand is high during the peak season and space tends to fill up quickly - particularly when it comes to car rentals. This foresight will help you avoid disappointment, stay on budget and will give you the freedom to travel how and when you like.

Museum exhibits cover wartime operations during WWII and the town's role in hosting many travelers whose flights landed in Gander on the day of the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks.  </see>



'''Silent Witnesses Memorial''' is located 4km East of Gander, on Trans-Canadian Highway #1. There is no admission fee.

Visit the Arrow Air Crash Site, where a monument was erected in memory of the 256 individuals who lost their lives on December 12, 1985.

A tranquil park dedicated to the memory of the 256 individuals who lost their lives on December 12, 1985 in the Arrow Air Crash. The Silent Witness Memorial sees an American soldier standing atop a massive rock holding the hands of a civilian boy and girl. Each child holds a olive branch indicative of the peacekeeping mission of the 101st Air-borne Division Screaming Eagles on the Sinai Peninsula. The trio look to the future as they are surrounded by the hills and trees of the crash site.

You will find rivers, ponds and lakes that are both novice and pro-friendly. Outfitters offer all types of adventures and a variety of fish, including everything from tent camps to deluxe lodges.

'''Terra Nova National Park'''

Located 88 kilometers southeast of Gander, is Canada’s most easterly national park, which comprises 400 square kilometers of natural beauty. Here you can kayak, canoe, or boat from sheltered bays to breathtaking coastlines, amongst whales, seabirds and icebergs. Dense forests, marshes and green meadows wait to be explored along 12 extensive and beautiful hiking trails. As you walk along the twisting paths, you might spy a moose, lynx, beaver, or rare bird flying freely among the forest and marshy bogs.

Tee off over the rapids of two salmon rivers and along the powerful shores of the Atlantic Ocean as you play a round of first-class golf. During the summer months, we’ll entertain you with live dramatic performances, amazing nature walks, and evening soirees at our outdoor theater.

In the winter, thick blankets of snow transform Terra Nova National Park into a paradise of white. Strap on your cross-country skis or snowshoes and make your way into the flawless wilderness. For the full effect, camp out for the night under the stars, or spend the day on an ice-fishing expedition.

When you arrive, visit the Visitor Centre just off Route 1 and plan your day or arrange for a guided interpretive tour. After your hiking expedition, head to the eatery for a mouth-watering Newfoundland and Labrador meal, or get a snack for a day of exploring.

'''Twillingate''' 

Located 112 kilometers north of Gander, Twillingate embodies everything so many Newfoundland and Labrador outports are famous for: stunningly-rugged coastline, historical, picturesque streets, and lush countryside roads. In the waters off the coast, look for whales, dolphins, harp seals, seabirds and – if the season is right – icebergs. Twillingate is located alongside Iceberg Alley, a vast corridor of ocean that runs from Greenland. One of the best places to view all these sights is at Long Point Lighthouse, which looks out over the distant reaches of Notre Dame Bay. 

Walk through winding laneways past colourful houses, standing proudly on the shore. Jump from rock to rock over rivers full of tiny fish. Take a boat expedition and witness whales breaching and playing just meters away from you. Twillingate offers a wide range of scenic walking trails and hiking tours.

Spend time at the Twillingate museum, located in the former Anglican Rectory, and see how the wealthy lived at the turn of the century. Absorb the town's long history. Learn the story of Georgina Stirling, the town's most famous resident, a world-renowned opera singer who toured Italy and the United States throughout the 1890's. Nicknamed "The Nightingale of the North", she was known professionally as Marie Toulinguet.

Be sure to head to our annual Fish, Fun and Folk Festival during the last weekend of July. Join in on the excitement of scavenger hunts, parades, bonfires, fireworks, concerts, and so much more.

Known for its seafood and traditional dishes, Newfoundland and Labrador offers an exciting variety of dining options ranging from international flavours to local delights. Try mouth-watering lobster, cod, halibut, salmon (try Atlantic salmon in gin and juniper berry sauce), trout, mussels, scallops, and shrimp.

Though the fishery originated in the eastern region of Newfoundland, you'll find fresh, delicious seafood in practically every corner of the province. Try some wild Atlantic salmon straight from the Exploits River in Central Newfoundland; a local favourite is of course the fish & chips; the most famous, Ches's Fish & Chips, started in the 1950s. 

A culinary journey through Newfoundland and Labrador would not be complete without a sampling of wild game. Find moose, caribou (try caribou medallions in partridgeberry sauce), bear, and rabbit (try braised rabbit pie) prepared in both traditional or innovative ways, and enjoy one of a kind dining experiences.

Feast on some of the most unique recipes on earth. Recipes you've never heard of with names you'll never forget: cod tongues, doughboys, salt fish and brewis, and toutons to name a few.
Try Jiggs' dinner, a staple of a traditional Newfoundland ‘scoff'. 

For dessert try figgy duff, a delicious 16th-century pudding that's still a favourite. What about bakeapple cheesecake?
