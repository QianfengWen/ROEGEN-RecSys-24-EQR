'''Kunming''' (昆明, ''Kūnmíng'') is the capital of [[Yunnan]] Province in [[People's Republic of China|China]].

[[Image:Kunming_Golden_Horse_Memorial_Archway.JPG|thumb|350px|Golden Horse memorial Archway on Jinbi Road]]
Known in China as the "City of Eternal Spring" (春城, ''Chūnchéng''), Kunming lies at an almost-tropical latitude but its 2000 m (6600 ft) altitude gives it a very temperate climate. It may snow in winter and locals says the recent winters have become colder and colder, so pack warm if visiting from December to February. Rainy days are also usually cold. The air is also quite clean compared to many Chinese cities, but the population of the prefecture is closing on 10 million and the city is expanding rapidly, with modern buildings and numerous highways emitting their fair share of air pollution. In addition to its own charms, Kunming also serves as a hub from which to explore [[Yunnan]] Province.

===Climate===
Kunming has one of the mildest climates in China and it is known as the "City of Eternal Spring". It has a subtropical highland climate with 979mm of rainfall (38.5 inches) annualy (around 3/4 of it occur in the summer). Despite being at the same latitude as [[Agra]] and [[Hawaii]] Kunming has cool winters, with the average January temperature being 8.9°C (48°F). At night it may get chilly, but the days are pleasantly warm. Sometimes the day-night temperature variation can be 15°C (25°F) so you should dress appropriately. Cold periods are very uncommon as the mercury rarely gets to 0°C (32°F). Flakes may sometimes reach the outer suburbs but major snowfalls are an extremely rare phenomenon, with the last one being in January 2016. The lowest recorded temperature is -7.8°C (18°F). Summer though is a very pleasant time for Kunming. In spite of the ocassional downpours caused by the east asian monsoon, the sun does come out for at least a few hours every day. In addition, the average July temperature is 20.3°C (68.5°F) and temperatures above 32°C (90°F) have never been recorded.

==Get in==
Some routes to or from Kunming are described in [[Overland Kunming to Hong Kong]]. Routes to the West are in [[Yunnan tourist trail]].

===By plane===
'''Kunming Changshui International Airport''' (KMG) has plenty of domestic connections within China and [[Hong Kong]], as well as international flights to [[Southeast Asia]]n cities like [[Bangkok]], [[Chiang Mai]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Phnom Penh]], [[Singapore]] , [[Kolkata]] , [[Yangon]]. You can book air tickets at the Air China Office (Wallton Bldg, 448 Baoshan St,+86 871 3159-171) or any number of travel agents in the King World Hotel a few blocks north of the train station on Beijing Lu. Tickets to Beijing are usually about ¥1600-2000, to Hong Kong about ¥1200-1500, and closer destinations are getting ever cheaper as China's domestic carriers jostle for market share.

Changshui International Airport is located about 25 km (15 mi) northeast of the downtown Kunming. A taxi there will take about 30–40 minutes, but congestion during rush hour can easily double the time. The Airport Express bus to Kunming Railway Station takes about as long and costs 25&nbsp;RMB. The cheaper bus 919 for 13 RMB rides to the city center making several stops en-route to Renmin West road City Bus station. There is also a Metro line (Line 6) now in service from 07:00–19:00 daily, connecting the airport to the City East Bus Station (which is some 30min additional busride from the city center/ South Railway station), which provides a large number of lines into downtown Kunming. (Two intermediate stops are planned but not yet opened as of October 2015.) A single ride takes about 20 minutes and costs 5&nbsp;RMB. The trains usually run every 20–30 minutes, but run every 5–10 minutes during peak congestion.

===By train===
Kunming Railway Station has recently been refurbished and has a ticket office on its lower level. The station provides service to the national rail network, with established routes to [[Chengdu]], [[Nanning]], [[Guilin]], [[Guangzhou]], [[Shanghai]], [[Xi'an]], and [[Beijing]]. There is bullet train service started to dali xiaguan  Town, about 2 and half hours) and [[Lijiang]]. As of 2014, there were at least 5-6 trains each day to and from Xiaguan/Dali and fewer from [[Lijiang]]. The railway line between Dali and Lijiang has completed its renovations; the line between Guangtong and Dali is still under repair.

High speed trains serve the massive Kunming South station, 28km from the city center. Subway line 1 takes you to downtown in an hour, stopping at Kunming railway station as well.

===By bus===
Kunming has moved its bus stations to the edge of the city in a bid to decrease traffic congestion. The bus stations next to the train station are NO LONGER long-distance bus stations.  

There are four bus stations for each of the cardinal directions (N,S,E,W).  The general rule of thumb is you should go to the bus station in the direction you want to travel: e.g., if you are headed to Dali or Lijiang, you will need to use the West Bus Station (西部客运站, ''Xibu Keyun Zhan'') and, if you are headed to Jinghong or Jianshui, you will need the South Bus Station. 

* South Bus Station (南部客运站 新螺蛳湾) (Attention: Not to be confused with "South Station", which refers to Kunming's railway station.)
::—Kunming Railway Station: Bus C1 (5&nbsp;RMB, ~30min)
::—[[Yuanyang]]
::- Easily reached by Metro from Government Sq 

* East Bus Station (东部客运站)
::—Kunming Railway Station: Bus 60 (2&nbsp;RMB, ~30min)
::—[[Shilin]] ("Stone Forest"; 50&nbsp;RMB, ~2hrs)

* North Bus Station (北部客运站)

* West Bus Station (西部客运站)
::—Kunming Railway Station: Bus C72 (5&nbsp;RMB, ~40min)
::—Xishan: Bus 6 (5&nbsp;RMB, ~20min)

The long-distance buses are generally excellent—cheap, reliable, and comfortable. However, overnight sleepers can be cold, bumpy, and dirty, so check out the bus before you buy the tickets. Non-smokers should be aware that people smoke on the bus in China, which can be a big problem if the weather is cold and all the windows are closed.

There are international departures to [[Laos]] from the South Bus Station and [[Vietnam]] from the East Bus Station, although these services are not always running. The bus to Laos goes all the way from Kunming to [[Vientaine]], costs approximately US$50, and lasts around 40 hours. (This is unconfirmed but there have been reports that improved roads have shortened the journey to around 28 hours.). There are also buses to [[Huai Xai]]. You can also buy cheaper tickets to stops along the route, like [[Luang Prabang]]. Laos buses depart between 6-7pm to reach the border the next morning (Dec 15). The buses are clean but make stops in unexplained places for short periods. The bus also stops along the way at dingy restaurants and even nastier gas station restrooms. Still, its a manageable journey if you need to go from Laos to Kunming or visa versa. The journey to [[Vietnam]] is less arduous. Buses to [[Hekou]], the Chinese border city, leave regularly. There were night buses which allowed you to leave Kunming at 8 PM and arrive at [[Hekou]] in time to cross the border as soon as it opened, but improved travel times (the ride only takes 7 hours now) may have changed the bus schedule. The bus station in Hekou is about 3 km from the border crossing but local buses go there. From there, you can take one of the many buses to [[Sapa]], the bus or train to [[Hanoi]], or journey elsewhere.

==Get around==
Kunming has very bad traffic conditions and not only at peak times. It's worth planning ahead if you have somewhere to get to. 

===By bicycles===
*''Bicycles'' can be rented at some hostels for about ¥20 a day. There are bike lanes along the edges of many major roads and traffic generally moves fairly slowly.  In addition, a scheme launched 2012 in the Dianchi (lakeside) area provides bicycle rental as a public service, similar to schemes in Paris and London. However, registration is a prerequisite and it is unclear how accessible the system is to foreigners, particularly short-stay tourists.

Bicycle Rental in Kunming

Kunming Ronghui Bicycle Riding Club (昆明荣辉自行车运动俱乐部): Started from 2010,Ronghui Bicycle Rental Club is one of the most professional cycling clubs in Kunming. They provide different brands of bicycle rental(60-100RMB/Day) and arrange Yunnan cycling tours to Kunming, Dali, Lijiang, Shangri-La, Tibet, Sichuan, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam.

===By City Buses===
*''City Buses'' are ¥1 for older models and ¥2 for those with A/C and heaters (around ¥5 for the longer routes to the city's outskirts). They operate from about 6&nbsp;AM until late evening 21:30–23:00. They stop regularly along their routes but not necessarily at every bus stop along the roads. (Don't be surprised at a bus driving right past a stop, as it is simply not on their route.) Routes are marked on some local maps which may be purchased from street vendors or at kiosks but these may be outdated. Bus.mapbar.com is a Chinese-only website which provides maps of most bus routes: e.g., [http://bus.mapbar.com/kunming/xianlu/10lu/ this map of Bus 10's route]. (The number can be changed in the URL if you're unable to navigate the page.) For C61–62, see [http://km.ganji.com/bus/station/530100010382_5.html km.ganji.com] (no map). Stops are usually 500&nbsp;m to 1&nbsp;km apart. Bus drivers are lead footed and often race each other, especially on the ring roads. They tend to stop suddenly too, so have a good handhold if you are standing. Most stops are beside the road but some are located in the ''middle'' and appear to have been designed to provide maximum inconvenience and danger for passengers. There have been reports of pick-pocketing on crowded buses, especially in the crowds around the Spring Festival migrations, when many people carry extra cash.<br><br>A bus card provides a 10% discount on fares but costs ¥20 upfront. It is available at bus stations and can be recharged there and at some China Post offices.

===By Taxi===
* ''Taxis'' start at ¥8. Sometimes, taxi drivers will ask for a flat fee but you should make sure the driver uses the meter to avoid being scammed. In the case of refusal, simply leave the taxi: either the drivers will change their minds or you can get a different cab. (Don't worry: there are loads of them, except around the shift change at 6:30&nbsp;PM when drivers are returning their cars to the company lots.) As usual, care should be taken when traveling at night or long distances. Larger taxis cost more than smaller taxis. Also be aware that taxis are zoned and cannot access all areas. Don't be surprised if a taxi driver cannot take you to your destination, as some companies are limited to the outer areas of the city to reduce competition and congestion.<br><br>A fuel tax of ¥2.5 has been added to fares and is explained on a small sign on the dashboards of all taxis. Thus for each ride you'll have to add ¥2.5 to the meter reading to calculate your real fare.

===By subway===
*Those who want to use the Metro stop at Kunming Railway Station should be aware that there is a 10+ minute walk between the two, including passage through a tunnel which is not wheelchair accessible.

* '''Kunming municipal pump house.''' As a result of droughts parching Yunnan, the reservoirs surrounding Kunming are of vital importance. The specter of Kunming's taps suddenly running dry is of great concern for residents. The two-room "History Museum of Kunming Water Supply" (昆明市自来水历史博物馆)is inside the Green Lake Park, and is housed in the building that once pumped 1,000 cubic meters of water daily from Green Lake's spring-fed Nine Dragon Pond (九龙池) and along a 9.5 kilometer network of municipal water pipes. The pump station was completed in 1917 and started operating in 1918. It continued to be used until 1957. The current museum still contains what appear to be the two original French-made electric water pumps, along with a small collection of old photos and other curios, such as tokens that could be used to buy water from any of the more than 50 public water taps that were part of the system. The museum is located inside the park's east gate, which is actually located in the southeast of the park. Visitors walking through the gate will see the museum about 100 meters directly ahead of them. Entry to the museum is free and it is open Wednesday through Sunday from 9:30am to 4:30pm.

Earth Forest, as a representative landscape in the county, comprises Xinhua, Bangguo, Wanbao and Tiger Leaping Beach, covering an area of 50 square kilometers. The Earth Forest came into being since geological movement and soil erosion one or two million years ago. Its shape looks like an immense forest and the main component is earth, so it is named Earth Forest. The Earth Forest, the Stone Forest in Kunming and the Colorful Sand Forest in Luliang are called “the Three Forests in Yunnan”.</see>

<see name="Yuantong Temple" alt="圆通寺; Yuántōngsì" Directions="At the foot of Yuantong Hill in the northern part of Kunming" price="&yen;6"></see>

With a history of more than 1200 years, Yuantong Temple is the grandest and most important Buddhist temple in Yunnan Province. King Yimouxun of the Nanzhao Kingdom built the temple in late eighth century.  The restorations from the Qing Dynasty onward has not changed the unique mixed architectural style of the Yuan and Ming Dynasties.

Unlike all other Buddhist temples, you enter Yuantong Temple from above and descend along a gently sloping garden path. A memorial archway with four Chinese characters is standing halfway.  The temple complex is built around Yuantong Hall, which is surrounded by a very large pond. A delicate stone bridge which has an elegant octagonal pavilion stands in the center and connects the hall and the temple entrance. The pavilion is connected to the rest of the complex by various bridges and walkways.

Sakyamuni, Amitabha and the Medicine Buddha, all Yuan Dynasty statues, are found in the main hall. The surrounding 500 Buddhist Arhats which are carved in the walls are noted for their perfect proportions and lively appearances. Also in this temple hall are two ten meter high pillars from the Ming Dynasty that are each engraved with a dragon trying to extend their bodies and claws into the air.  Outside, on each side of the main hall, there are stone staircases carved out of the mountainside and wind their way to the top of the hill. There are ancient inscriptions along the way and various stone artworks considered the most important historical relics in Kunming. From the top of the stairs, you are presented with a terrific panoramic view of the entire complex.  In 1982, Thai Buddhists sent a 3.5-meter-high copper statue of Sakyamuni, which is now placed in the Copper Buddha Hall combining Chinese and Thai styles.

Surrounding the temple pond are a series of halls where you will find old women praying, people sitting and chatting, ongoing classes in Buddhist scriptures, a magnificent calligraphy studio, an exhibit of temple photographs, a temple shop, a restaurant, and more.

Yuantong Temple is a real working temple. Buddhists from many different countries come here on pilgrimages to pay homage. There are special Buddhist services two times each month, and the Buddhist Association of Yunnan Province is also located here, making it a center of Buddhism in Yunnan.

Built in 1634. According to historical records, before the temple was erected, there had been a thatched shack where Shi Shiqiao, a scholar of the Ming Dynasty, buried himself in books. Shi Tai, grandson of Shi Shiqiao, donated the estate for the shack whereon the temple was built.

In the backyard there was an epiphyllum tree, which is called ''tanhua'' in Chinese, hence the name. The temple went through many renovations during the Qing Dynasty. It is well-known for its flowers and plants. It has been a scenic spot for more than three hundred years, and an epitome of Kunming, ''the Flower City of the Southern Frontier''.  The epiphyllum tree was planted in the side court of the depository of Buddhist Scriptures. There is a stone tablet on which four characters are carved ''The Epiphyllum Brings Luck''. After the erection of the temple, the original epiphyllum withered and died. The epiphyllum now standing taller than the eaves of the temple sprang from the root of the original one at the beginning of the Qing Dynasty, and is about three hundred years old. It bursts into flowers in mid-summer. The big loquat tree in the backyard is said to have been planted in the early Ming Dynasty.

In the South Garden there are flowers and rockeries with winding paths among the flowers and the zigzagging corridor surround the Lotus Pond, where you can watch fish.  The East Garden is shaded by tall cedars and cypresses and include seven smaller gardens and a Children's Playground.

In recent years, the old temple has resumed its original grandeur. It has become one of the most famous scenic spots in Kunming.

The top floor of the pavilion provides an all-embracing view of the vast Dianchi Lake and the peaks of the Western Mountains. A 180 character couplet is hanging down the pavilion, which is lauded as the ''number one couplet past and present''.  The Park is the most fascinating garden in urban Kunming.</see>

The museum is adjacent to, and indeed shares a compound with, a university science campus. The exhibits are arranged on five floors starting with dinosoars, fossils and skeletons on the ground floor and working up to a tropical rain forest replica on the uppermost floor. There are sections with preserved fish and amphibians, stuffed animals and preserved insects. The exhibits seem to concentrate on creatures that are, or were, to be found in Yunnan. Most exhibits are labelled in English and Chinese but the longer explanations and information boards are generally Chinese only. Overall it is a pleasant, clean, museum with the exhibits well presented and usually well lit. It is not really an interactive museum; there is plenty to point at and peer at but not much to do. There is a small table offering momentos for sale but otherwise no shop. Nor is there any onsite catering.</see>

The museum is in two sections: The first contains maps, documents, models, information boards and small artifacts. The information boards and artifact labels are generally in Chinese and English, but many of the copies of original documents and annotated drawings are in French and Chinese. The second section of the museum houses various locomotives and rolling stock. Non-commercial photography is permitted but, as both sections of the museum are poorly lit, a tripod might be useful. Railway enthusiasts can probably browse contentedly for an hour or two but small children and people with no interest in history or railways might find 15 minutes to be more than long enough.</see>

The action is sort of centered on the square around the ancient Varja Pagoda (金刚塔), where the parks and most of the temples can be found.

'''Local specialties''' include:
* '''Over-the-Bridge Rice Noodles''' (过桥米线; ''guoqiao mixian'') is a noted Yunnanese dish. It has a long history, to which a vivid love story has been attached. The famous dish is essentially chicken-flavored hot pot: a big bowl of chicken soup is prepared with a layer of oil on top to preserve its heat for cooking the three courses. The first includes raw pork, cooked chicken, pork liver, and sliced squid and carp; the second includes various vegetables; and the third is a course of rice noodles.

* '''Steam Pot Chicken''' (汽锅鸡; ''qiguo ji'') Steam Pot Chicken has been well-regarded since at least the early Qianlong Era of the Qing Dynasty, when it became popular among the lower classes. The pots from Jianshui County have traditionally been regarded as the best in Yunnan, with a hollow tube fixed in the center up to the height of the pot. The chicken, ginger, salt, and other ingredients are placed inside and then the pot is placed inside a second, larger one with boiling water, roasting the food gently and evenly.

* '''Goujie''' or '''Yiliang Roasted Duck'''—The roasted duck produced on Goujie Street in Yiliang is extraordinarily delicious, with crispy skin, tender meat, and a special slight aroma of pine needles.

* '''Xuanwei ham''' dates back to 1727 and won a prize at the Panama Fair in 1915. In 1923, Sun Yat-sen inscribed ''Yin He Shi De'' ("eat properly for a sound mind") for the ham while tasting it at a food competition in Guangzhou. It is exported to Southeast Asia and Europe. As a rule, Xuanwei ham is processed during the winter. Excellent pork legs are bled out completely, rubbed with salt until it reaches the proper depth, and then air or smoke dried. It is then tested when the surface of the pork turns green, usually by punching three needles into the ham to check the fragrance.

* '''Erkuai''' (饵块) is a chewy rice cake made from steamed rice, which is pounded, kneaded, and rolled into various shapes. The resulting cakes are used in a number of dishes: thinly-sliced ''erkuai'' stir-fried with spicy hot sauce and pork ('''chao erkuai'''), cut into square noodles served with gravy ('''lu er si'''), in soup, or rolled into pancakes wrapped around a ''youtiao'' (the Chinese fried dough stick) with a sweet or spicy sauce.

* '''Sweet Tonghai Peapowder Candy''' is a famous traditional snack. 

* '''Qujing Pickled Chives Flower''' was first produced in the Guanxu Year of the Qing Dynasty. Its main ingredients are chives flowers, salt, wine, chili, and brown sugar.

* '''Sweet Pickled Kaiyuan Chinese Onion'''—Kaiyuan is a place in south Yunnan famed for its delicious sweet pickled Chinese onions. Brine, salt, chili, brown sugar, and wine flavor it over the three months it spends sealed in a jar before serving.

* '''Smoked Stinky Tofu''' (烟熏臭豆腐 ''yanxun chou doufu'') is one of the popular snacks found in the night snack market in Kunming. The tofu is smoked over a charcoal fire.

* '''The Eight Treasures of Yunnan'''—Of all the well-known Yunnanese cakes, the Eight Treasures comes first. It is packed in eight small pieces. It consists of one hard-skin cake, a ham-stuffed moon part, two crispy white parts stuffed with purée, and two crispy parts stuffed with sesame, peanuts, mushroom, and pickled rutabaga.

* '''Wild mushrooms''' (菌子 ''junzi''), quite expensive, fresh wild mushrooms

* '''Old Lady Potatoes''' (老奶洋芋 ''laonai yangyu'') with peppers and fennel.

* '''Fried goat cheese''' (''rubing''), sometimes served with sugar or black pepper and salt.

* '''Kabobs'''—at night, Muslim street vendors set up charcoal grills where they barbeque potatoes, zucchinis, lamb, chicken, and beef on skewers—all sprinkled liberally with powdered chili unless you ask otherwise (不要辣, ''bù yào là''). Typically ¥2 each.

* Muslim vendors can be found hawking '''granola-bar type snacks''' in the older part of town north of the train station. A tough but tasty treat sold by the kilo, the vendor will chop a piece off a huge nut- and honey-filled cake and make bars or squares as you like.

Clean with a good, inexpensive restaurant. Since being recommended by ''Lonely Planet'' it seems to have lost some of its charm and it has picked up many of the traits of well-trodden hostels (unfriendly and unknowledgeable staff, poor wifi/internet, more expensive facilities,  etc). Several restaurants within a short walk..</sleep>


The City Cafe & Hostel was demolished a few years back.

Rooms with free internet. A free computer is also usually available in the lobby. The rooms come equipped with a satellite dish that covers channels from all over China (only one or two English channels). Because it is located in the city, do not be surprised to find no view from your window. Think Best Western.</sleep>

*<sleep name="Spring City Star Hotel" alt="" address="241 Baita Rd." directions="" phone="+86 871 6161666" url="" checkin="" checkout="" price=" Standard rooms with en suite bath are &yen;138 (December 2008)" lat="" long="">Formerly the ''Spring City Inn'' and, before that, the ''Yunnan Machinery Hotel''.

Lobby to the right of the New Era Hotel entrance" phone="+86 871 6353777" email="" fax="" url="" checkin="" checkout="" price="¥268 for double (May 2011)">Since the hotel lobby is located on the first floor, Fairyland has the advantage of receiving walk-ins first, but there are several other hotels in the same building that represent better value.  Be aware that staff will generally not help you find the other hotels; to see them, go directly to the 9th floor. Rooms have a slight odor and an odd yellow-and-orange color scheme. Flat screen TVs, but no computer provided. No english speaking staff. Very central location. </sleep>

* <sleep name="YSSJ Hotel" alt="" address="99 W. Dongfeng Rd. (东风西路99号; Dōngfēngxīlù)" directions="No vehicle access from W. Dongfeng Rd.

It's on the 9th floor in the same wing as the Fairyland Hotel and New Era Apartments.  Rooms are respectably clean with pleasant decor (dark wood & white).  Both doubles and singles have standing showers along with a kitchenette containing mini-fridge, sink, and cabinets.  There is a flat screen TV with a small sofa and sitting area.  Downsides are the room has a slight but tolerable odor, the bathroom (despite having an American-style toilet) is Asian-style where the entire floor gets wet if not fenced in with towels, and the front desk reception knows no English: come prepared with phrases to ask to see the room and to negotiate prices. Rooms have free internet with computer. Very central location.</sleep>

* <sleep name="New Era Apartments" alt="" address="99 W. Dongfeng Rd. (东风西路99号; Dōngfēngxīlù)" directions="No vehicle access from W. Dongfeng Rd.

A fridge and microwave might be provided in the room. The hotel does not occupy all the floors of the building, so the single (somewhat overworked) elevator does not stop at all floors but will often keep you waiting. Also the set of elevators in the main lobby of each floor do not stop at all, presumably because they are used by some other hotel in the same building. The rooms overlooking the square below can be noisy 9&nbsp;AM-10&nbsp;PM if some event is in progress in the square. Nearby are various eastern- and western-style restaurants and fast food joints, a very badly organized Carrefour supermarket, various retail outlets, and small stores.</sleep>

Half the rooms face in towards an atrium which is used for noisy events on the weekends. Outward-facing rooms are OK but have rock-hard Chinese mattresses. Helpful staff all keen to practice their English.</sleep>

==Stay safe==
Kunming is located in an earthquake zone and the last earthquake happened in 2009. In some seasons, torrential rains can cause flash floods.

There has been some terrorist activity, including bomb incidents in 2008 (one in Bus 54 and another inside Salvador's Coffee House) and an infamous knife attack at the train station in March 2014.

The buses are sometimes plagued by pickpockets, so keep an eye on your bags and pockets. There have also been reports of bag slashing in the downtown commercial area.

In 2010, travelers to Kunming reported barbershops, massage parlors, and other small shops involved in various cons.  One such involves an older woman entering the shop and demanding a larger amount than was quoted.  The woman together with the workers apply pressure and it can be especially intimidating to be surrounded by a shop filled with angry Chinese while your head is covered in soap (and it is dripping into your eyes), all your clothes and passport are locked in a closet (and they have the key), or together they are blocking the exit.  If you give in to the much larger demanded amount, the service will continue.  Disagreement can result in variations of the shop workers pushing you out barefoot with your hair half cut and full of soap or simply not allowing you to leave while one (or many) of the workers surround you attempting to reach your wallet.  To date, so many incidents have been reported to the Kunming PSB that they are considering setting up Yunnan's first-ever Tourist Police unit. Note that the barbershops near the main railway station seem to be decent enough.

==Get out==
*Visit the hot springs at [[Anning]] - 34 kms from Kunming.
*The Western Mountains (西山, ''Xi Shan'') provide a good view of the city and have a few ancient Taoist grottoes. Take Bus 5 west to the end of the route, then Bus 6 or a minibus. In total, the trip should take no more than an hour and a half. From the nearest Bus 6 stop, either take a minibus up to the main gate or walk about 3 hours. There is an entrance fee to the grottos (¥30).
*Travel further north-west to the old towns of [[Dali]] (4 hours) or [[Lijiang]] (8 hours), both very popular with foreign tourists. See [[Yunnan tourist trail]] for discussion.
*Fuxian Lake - one of cleanest and deepest lakes in China, albeit that's hard to believe when you see how locals wash their motorbikes on the beach. A great day trip. From South Bus Station, take Buses 156 or 170 (¥15-20) or a ¥40 taxi (~1 hr). From Chengjiang (澄江), you can walk 3-4&nbsp;km to the lake or take local transport or a taxi. The last bus back to Kunming leaves at 7&nbsp;PM. You also can camp on the beach, ideally not too close to the city. The lake is huge, clear, and beautiful! You can walk around it over a weekend or head to the south end of the lake, taking transport back to  Kunming from one of the villages there.
* [[Yuanyang]] rice terraces to the south.
