'''Ottawa''' [http://ottawa.ca] is the capital of [[Canada]].  The city is situated along the [[Ontario]] side of the Ottawa River, opposite [[Gatineau]], [[Quebec]]. The metropolitan population of Ottawa is 1.4 million as of 2018 and is currently the sixth largest in Canada, and the second largest in Ontario after Toronto.

Unique as a North American capital, the city is bilingual. English is the first language of a majority of the population, but French is the first language of a significant number. Staff in most stores and restaurants speak both well and, in general, bilingualism is common.

Ottawa is home to many of the world's cultures as thousands of immigrants from around the world now call Ottawa home.  The city is probably best known as the nation's capital but has become one of the fastest growing cities in North America owing to the booming high-tech business sector. 

==Understand==
Ottawa started as a humble lumber town, then called '''Bytown''', named after Colonel John By.  Colonel By oversaw the construction of the [[Rideau Canal]], now a '''UNESCO World Heritage site''', much of which was done by hand, between 1826 and 1832.  Lumber mills were built along the Ottawa River in the mid-nineteenth century and those brought employment and wealth to the growing population.  The centre of action then, as now, was the ByWard Market.  While it's still the centre of the city's nightlife, it has changed appreciably from the rough and tumble early days of brothels and taverns.

In 1857, Queen Victoria chose Ottawa as the capital of Canada.  The choice was controversial, partly because it sidestepped the rivalry between [[Toronto]] and [[Montreal]] (then, as now, Canada's largest cities), and partly because the new capital was still a tiny outpost in the middle of nothing much — an American newspaper famously commented that it was impregnable, as any invaders would get lost in the woods looking for it.

During the latter half of the nineteenth century, the telephone was demonstrated to the Canadian public for the first time and the city was electrified. The first electric streetcar service was started in 1891.  A menu from 1892 states that, "the first instance in the entire world of an entire meal being cooked by Electricity" was in Ottawa.

Today, the major economic sectors are the public service, travel and tourism and the high-tech industry.  Ottawa has proudly remained a green city and is situated at the confluence of three rivers (Ottawa, Rideau and Gatineau) as well as the Rideau canal. Many residents make regular use of Ottawa's parks and green spaces, bikeways and cross country ski trails.  Many national attractions are located in Ottawa:  Parliament Hill; the National Library and Archives; the National Gallery; as well as the Museums of History, Contemporary Photography, Nature, War and Science & Technology.

Ottawa has a four-season climate, and can be relatively humid, which means that it can feel surprisingly hot in the summer and bonechillingly cold in the winter. Precipitation is steady throughout the year. The city receives a lot of snow in the winters; more than Toronto but somewhat less than Montréal.
Spring (mid-April to the end of May) and Autumn (September and October) are short but quite comfortable.

===By plane===
The newly renovated and expanded '''Macdonald-Cartier International Airport''' [http://ottawa-airport.ca] ({{IATA|YOW}}) is Ottawa's main airport with regular arrivals and departures from most major Canadian and many American cities.  Services outside North America, however, are limited to a daily flight to [[London]] Heathrow and a daily flight to [[Frankfurt]] with Air Canada, plus seasonal service to London Gatwick. Air France, KLM, and Swiss International Airlines provide shuttle bus service between Ottawa and Montreal that facilitate connections with their flights operated from Trudeau International Airport. This trip takes about two hours. Via Rail also operates a shuttle bus from the Dorval train station to nearby Trudeau International Airport. This free shuttle service allows one to travel from Ottawa to Dorval (a suburb of Montreal) by rail, and then transfer directly to the airport on a dedicated on-demand bus. 

Macdonald-Cartier is easily reached by public transit or taxi and most of the major car rental agencies have a presence at the airport terminal in the parking garage.  A taxi to downtown hotels should cost between $20. and $30., while a taxi to nearby hotels should not cost more than $10.. YOW Airporter [http://yowshuttle.com/] operates a mini-bus shuttle to most downtown [http://www.monterey.ca/ Ottawa hotels] for $14 one-way and $24 return.

To reach downtown via public transit, take the #97 bus (the only bus at the airport) and get out at the Mackenzie King transitway stop (14 stops away) at the Rideau Centre shopping mall.  If you take this route before 6:00AM, you will likely follow the more meandering early morning route but will still get to Mackenzie King.  To get to the train station, take the #61, #62, or #95 eastbound bus. The bus fare is $3.65 (2021) which gives you 1.5 hours of unlimited bus travel or $7.50 for an all-day pass. Exact change is required, remember to ask the bus driver for a transfer even if you do not intend on transferring to another bus--OC Transpo security personnel may get on the bus at any given stop and ask passengers for proof of payment. You will be required to show your transfer or else you will be fined. It doesn't happen often, but when it does, it can be embarrassing and expensive. There is construction in the west ad east ends for the Confederation Line expansion. The Trillium Line expansion down to the airport and beyond was planned for 2022, but has been delayed to closer to 2023. In order to plan any transit travels, check their [www.octranspo.com website] as they update their website most regularly.

===By bus===
There is a Voyageur/Greyhound [http://greyhound.ca] terminal in Ottawa with regular service to [[Montreal]] (departure on the hour from 6 a.m. to midnight), [[Toronto]] and all other cities in North America.  The bus terminal is downtown on the corner of Catherine Street and Kent Street, between Bronson Avenue and Bank Street. Though the bus terminal is downtown, a 15-20 minute walk will get you to most hotels and downtown attractions.  Alternatively, a 5-10 minute local bus ride will do the same. (Buses 6 or 7, with its stop around the corner from the terminal on Bank Street, will each take you north into Centretown, towards the O-Train; or south towards the Glebe.)

Greyhound busses coming from Montreal also usually make an intermediary "University of Ottawa" stop (actually at Laurier Station near the corner of Laurier Avenue East and Waller Street) and stop before going to the Catherine Street terminal. This stop is closer walking distance to the Byward Market, the Rideau Canal, and Parliament Hill, and is a more central city transit hub. It may be necessary to request the stop with the driver.

A taxi to most downtown hotels should cost between $8 and $15, and buses are $3.65 one-way ($3.60 with PRESTO e-Purse) or $10.50 for an all-day pass (purchased on the bus).

===By train===
Passenger train service is run by '''VIA Rail''' [http://viarail.ca/] in Canada and the main train station in Ottawa, '''Ottawa Station''' ({{IATA|XDS}}) [http://viarail.ca/cgi-bin/genericXSLT?xml=OTTW.xml&xsl=en_station.xsl], is less than ten minutes from downtown by car, taxi or bus.  There are six trains daily leaving for Montreal and intermediate points, with five trains daily to Toronto and points in between.  Service is reduced on Saturday, Sundays and holidays.

Ottawa has two train stations, the Ottawa Station near downtown, and a secondary station, '''Fallowfield Station''' [http://viarail.ca/cgi-bin/genericXSLT?xml=FALL.xml&xsl=en_station.xsl], in the western suburb of Barrhaven, convenient for Nepean and Kanata points.  All trains to Toronto stop at Fallowfield; two of the six weekday trains to Montreal originate or terminate at Fallowfield.

Ottawa Station is on an LRT line, the Confederation Line of the O-Train, and it takes only 5-10 minutes to get you downtown, heading west, signs toward Tunney's Pasture.  
Fallowfield station is also on the ''#94''' and '''#95''' bus route but at the far south-west end of the city in the Barrhaven neighbourhood of the city, approx. 25 minutes drive from downtown. 

It is possible to get downtown from the main train station on foot, although it requires a bit of navigation.  This path should not be taken alone after dark and may be flooded after periods of intense rain or snow melting.  Have a street map with you so you can locate yourself once you have reached Strathcona Park.  The station to Strathcona Park takes about half an hour (2.5km).  Another half hour from the Park to downtown. A map is available online [http://stepwhere.com/maps/route/Pedestrain-route-from-Ottawa-train-station-to-downtown].

#On exiting the station, walk along the west (left-hand) arm of the vehicle loop and across the Transitway bridge.
#Before reaching Tremblay Road, take the bike path to your left going west.
#The path will take you along the bus lanes and will pass over Riverside Drive.
#You will merge with a path coming up from Riverside Drive; continue walking west, away from the street.
#Shortly after that, you will come to a fork; go right (north) and continue until you see a pedestrian bridge on your left.
#Take the pedestrian bridge over the Rideau River.
#Immediately after the pedestrian bridge, turn right towards the north.  
#Take the paved bike path, go under the highway bridge and keep following the Rideau River northward for about 1 km.
#Once you reach the end of of the path, you are in Strathcona Park.
#Use a street map or an on-line map service to find your way from Strathcona Park to your downtown destination; at the north end of the park is Laurier Avenue, a major east-west street; parallel to it and several blocks north is Rideau Street.

===By boat===
[[Image:Canal Rideau Boat.JPG|thumb|Sailing up the Rideau Canal]]

The city is also accessible via the [[Rideau Canal]], now recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage site [http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1221/], and which runs from the St. Lawrence River at [[Kingston (Ontario)|Kingston]] to the Ottawa River at Ottawa where it empties via a series of locks.  It is possible to dock at Dow's Lake Pavilion and at points along the Rideau Canal and Ottawa River near downtown.

===By car===
By car, Ottawa is about a 4.5 hour trip from Toronto via the 401 and 416 highways, or via highway 7.  Montreal is 2 hours away via highway 417.  The American border at Ogdensburg, NY is only 1 hour 15 minutes away to the south, and the border at I-81 is a little further west at an additional 15 minutes' drive.

==Get around==
===Public transit===
[[Image:OC Transpo rapid transit map.png|right]]
The city's public transit is run by '''OC Transpo''' [http://octranspo.com/] and includes the 2-line O-Train light metro system as well as bus Transitways and scores of street-running bus routes. O-Train Line 1 runs Monday to Thursday from approx 5am till 1am. Friday and Saturday service ends at 2am, Sunday at 11pm. Line 1 is currently being expanded east and west with next openings in 2024 and 25. Line 2, currently (2022) closed for upgrading and extension to south and southwest suburbs, is expected to reopen in 2023. The Ontario-wide Presto card is the main payment method. Ticket machines with video help are located at entrances to all train stations.

The transit fare for regular routes is $3.65 cash, $3.60 on Presto. Seniors price is $2.75 and children 8 to 12 pay $1.85 cash. Children under 8 ride free. Upon boarding, make sure that you are given a transfer, which allows you to ride any number of buses or trains until its expiry (in roughly 1.5 hours).  The transfer is also your proof of payment in case fare enforcers board the bus to check that passengers have paid.  A day pass good for train and bus can be purchased for $11.00. On Saturdays, Sundays and statutory holidays, families can share one #11.00 day pass. A family can be made up of as many as 6 people, with a maximum of two aged 13 or older.

The O-Train operates on a "Proof of Payment" (POP) system. Valid proof of payment is a bus transfer (see above), or an O-Train ticket purchased from the automated vending machines for $2.75.  Note that the vending machine does not accept bus tickets, nor are bus tickets acceptable proof of payment.  Children 11 and under can ride the O-Train for free. Articulated buses (the long ones) use this same POP system as well, where rear boarding is available to pass holders.

Although the downtown is very walkable, if you are within the downtown area (Pimisi O-Train station to uOttawa O-Train station), you can take any bus going east-west. If you are going to the ByWard Market from the O-Train, get off at Rideau Station, take the eastern exit and turn right upon exit, along William St. To go North-South, take the #4 (to Catherine Street, edge of Centretown), the #7 (edge of Old Ottawa South) or the #1 (all the way down Bank Street to Ottawa South).

===By taxi=== 
Taxis are easy to find downtown; elsewhere, phone for a cab. All taxis should have a meter and the base charge is $2.45.  A ride from downtown to the airport will be costly, running between $25 and C$35. Cabs will not take credit cards for fares below $10. Most cab drivers know Ottawa well, but have clear instructions if you're going anywhere in the suburbs as many developments in the outskirts are relatively new. Ottawa cabs aren't supposed to pick up customers off the street on the Quebec side; the converse applies to Quebec cabs in Ottawa. You may phone a Quebec cab if you are in Ottawa and vice versa.

===By car===
Parking at most attractions is convenient, though on-street parking in downtown areas is sometimes at a premium. If you are driving downtown on the weekend, parking is free in the garage at the World Exchange Plaza. There are entrances to the garage on both Metcalfe Street and Queen Street. On-street parking is also generally free during the weekends and is relatively easy to find. A map is useful if you are going to be driving around downtown as many of the streets are one-way and more than one visitor has complained about navigating the downtown core. 

Most major car rental companies have several offices in Ottawa with all of them represented downtown and at the airport.

===On foot===
Ottawa is a great city to explore on foot. With pedestrian-friendly streets and the density of attractions, a car is expensive and unnecessary for the most part. An excellent place to start any tour of Ottawa is the Capital Information Kiosk, located at 111 Albert Street in the World Exchange Plaza.  They have maps and brochures for most tourist attractions in Ottawa, many of which are within walking distance.  

Popular pedestrian areas, especially during spring and summer months, are the various streets in the ByWard Market. Sparks Street, running through downtown parallel to the Parliament Buildings, is a popular pedestrian area during the day and night, particularly in the spring and summer months.

Guided walking tours are available with '''Ottawa Walking Tours''' [http://ottawawalkingtours.com]and others such as '''Around About Ottawa''' [http://aroundaboutottawa.com]. There is so much to see and do in the Nation's Capital that a tour guide will maximize a visitor's time and experience in this beautiful city. All tours include some history as well as other tidbits of trivia not commonly known.  Especially popular is the '''Haunted Walk of Ottawa'''[http://hauntedwalk.com] that provides a variety of walking tours focusing on the city's darker and more offbeat past.

Remember, Ottawa is a city with a truly continental climate. In winter, exposed skin can freeze in minutes or less, so layer up on the clothing and protect yourself by wearing a hat (toque or hunters cap), gloves and boots. Despite being closer to the North Pole than the equator, 
summer temperature and humidity can be oppressively high, so bring water if you're doing any amount of walking or cycling. If you are on the public pathways near the canal or the river, there are drinking fountains to refill your bottles. Also, don't forget the mosquito repellent.

===By bicycle===
There are usually a few options for renting bicycles downtown [http://bikedump.com/], and of course you can always bring your own.  Ottawa is very accessible to cyclists.  Again, you may want to start immediately opposite Parliament Hill to pick up a map of the area or find a bicycle rental.  Cycling to the attractions around downtown Ottawa is a great way to get around, but don't ignore the Gatineau side of the river.  They have several attractions along the river including the Museum of History and if you want to really stretch your legs, Gatineau Park has many great cycling paths.

The city is criss-crossed by over 170km of bicycle paths, some of which are shared with motorists, and some are shared with pedestrians.  The city provides Interactive Pathways and Other Maps [http://canadascapital.ca/bins/ncc_web_content_page.asp?cid=16297-16299-9970&lang=1]. In addition, the city closes 50 km of roadways to cars every Sunday during the summer from Victoria Day to Labour Day allowing for cycling, in-line skating and walking on these roadways. The participating roads in Ottawa are Sir John A MacDonald Parkway (along the Ottawa River), Colonel By Drive (along the Rideau Canal), and Rockcliffe Parkway. The other participating roadways are in Gatineau Park: Gatineau Parkway, Champlain Parkway, and Fortune Lake Parkway.

OC Transpo has bicycle racks on the front of many buses. You can load your bike on the rack and then ride the bus for the normal passenger fare.  The O-Train will take bikes as well.

All museums in Ottawa have free admission on Canada Day, July 1, although they are generally very crowded then. The Canadian Museum of History (French: Musée Canadien de l'histoire) is Canada's national museum of human history and the most popular and most-visited museum in Canada. It is located in the Hull sector of Gatineau, Quebec, directly across the Ottawa River from Canada's Parliament Buildings in Ottawa, Ontario. The Museum's primary purpose is to collect, study, preserve, and present material objects that illuminate the human history of Canada and the cultural diversity of its people. For the visiting public, the Museum of History is most renowned for its permanent galleries, which explore Canada's 20,000 years of human history, and for its architecture and stunning riverside setting. The Museum also presents an ever-changing program of special exhibitions that expand on Canadian themes and explore other cultures and civilizations, past and present. The Museum of History is also a major research institution. Its professional staff includes leading experts in Canadian history, archaeology, ethnology, folk culture, and more. With roots stretching back to 1856, the Museum is one of North America's oldest cultural institutions. It is also home to the Canadian Children's Museum, the Canadian Postal Museum, and an IMAX Theatre with 3D capacity. Museum is managed by the Canadian Museum of Civilization Corporation, a federal Crown Corporation that is also responsible for the Canadian War Museum, the Children's and Postal Museums, and the Virtual Museum of New France. The Museum is accredited by the American Association of Museums (AAM) and is a member of the Canadian Museums Association. Some 400 members of the Public Service Alliance of Canada at the Museum were on strike from 21 September to 16 December 2009. The Museum of History hosts a number of events year-round. The National Capital Commission’s Winterlude 2011 was launched on February 3 at the Museum with concerts, DJs, fireworks, and live performances. The event was attended by an estimated 30,000 visitors to Museum grounds and 15,000 visitors inside the Museum. Canada Day celebrations included a citizenship ceremony, live entertainment and activities, workshops and an exclusive view of the fireworks, which brought more than 18,000 visitors to the Museum.</see>

* <see name="Parliament Hill" alt="" address="" directions="" lat="" long="" phone="" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">The primary attraction for most visitors is Parliament Hill [http://parliamenthill.gc.ca]. Parliament Hill is in the middle of downtown Ottawa, overlooking the Ottawa River. Not only is the building a fine example of the Gothic revival style, but it also makes an excellent starting point to visit all other points of interest in the area. Tours of the building are available daily with multiple tours (in both official languages) available at staggered times throughout the day. If you have a group of greater than 10 people, you must make a reservation in advance by calling the reservations office at +1 613 996-0896. The Centre Block tour is the most popular as it includes inside views of the House of Commons, the Senate, and the newly renovated Library of Parliament. Same-day tickets are free and available on a first-come-first-served basis from 9:00 AM.  Pick up your ticket as early as possible to have the best chance of securing a start time that works for you. Tours last from 20 to 60 minutes depending on the building activity. From July 2 to Labour Day (early September), tours of the East Block are also available; tour guides take you through the restored offices of some of the Fathers of Confederation (Sir John A. Macdonald, Sir George-Etienne Cartier, Governor General Lord Dufferin, and the original Privy Council Office) explaining the beginnings of the Dominion of Canada while historical characters let you in on the daily lives of Canada's past politicians. Tours last about an hour and free same-day tickets can be picked up at the Info-tent on the Hill by West Block. If there are no more tickets available, or you have to wait for your time, a fine self-guided walking tour around the grounds of Parliament Hill will keep you busy. Free booklets are available at the visitors' center. One of the nicer, unexpected views, looking from the bottom up, can be accessed at the back of the Parliament Buildings - that vantage point also provides a river view of the Canadian Museum of History, across the river in downtown Gatineau (a sector that was formerly the city of Hull). The walk down from the southwest corner of the Centre Block allows visitors to visit the Hill cats, a group of feral animals housed there by volunteers. Behind the Parliament Buildings at sunset is a sight to remember. You can walk by the Rideau Canal locks (at the east corner) and visit the Bytown Museum at the level of the canal. The locks divide Parliament Hill from the Fairmont Chateau Laurier, a former railway hotel. This hotel once housed the offices of CBC Radio in Ottawa as well as the studio of well-known portrait photographer Yousuf Karsh. Several framed Karsh photographs are hung in the hotel lounge. His (and his wife's) home suite is now available for guests and displays a small sampling of framed prints on the walls.

For more information, call 613-232-0344. [http://hauntedwalk.com]

If you enjoy the outdoors, especially if you are a cyclist, you should definitely visit [[Gatineau Park]] just across the river from Ottawa.  Bicycles can be rented during the summer months at the northeast corner of the Chateau Laurier. Ottawa and the surrounding area boasts over 170km of public paved trails on which you can [[running|run]], bike, walk or rollerblade. If you are looking for a place to start, head to the nearest waterway: paved trails line both sides of the Ottawa River, the Rideau Canal, and the Rideau River. The Trans Canada Trail [http://www.tctrail.ca] enters Ottawa through the outskirt communities of Carleton Place and Stittsville, then joins up with the Ottawa River at Brittania Bay (near Carling Avenue at Bayshore Drive). It follows the river 13 kilometers east to Parliament Hill, then crosses over to the Quebec side, extending into and beyond Gatineau Park.

In winter, go skating on the largest outdoor skating rink in the world, the Rideau canal.  Skates can be rented, and refreshments purchased, from vendors right on the ice.  This is also a great place to enjoy a "beaver tail" [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeaverTails] which is a local specialty - a bit like funnel cake, often enjoyed with lemon and sugar.  It is very similar to, fried dough.  The city's trail system serves as an excellent cross-country ski trail system, as do the nearly 200km of groomed ski trails in Gatineau Park.  Downhill skiing is available across the river in three near-by sites: Camp Fortune (180 m vertical), Edelweiss (200 m vertical) and Mont Cascades (165 m vertical).

In early spring (typically March), when the daytime temperatures are above freezing and night temperatures are below freezing, consider visiting a sugarbush for fresh maple syrup.  There are many to choose from in the region if you have a car to drive out of the city.

===Day trips to Québec===

Being located right on the provincial border, daytrips to neighboring Québec can be made easily.

*'''[[Gatineau]]''' - Right accross the Ottawa river. World-class '''Canadian Museum of History''' is worth a visit. The nightlife in the Old Hull neighborhood is often considered superior to Ottawa's, with a handful of loud clubs but also a decent offering of artistic cafés with good local live music.

*'''[[Wakefield]]''' - Picturesque artist town on the side of the Gatineau river. Rich with cultural offerings and beautiful natural surroundings (especially in autumn).

*'''Aventure Laflèche''' (819) 457-4033 [http://aventurelafleche.ca/] A superb destination for those interested in outdoor activities in the Gatineau Hills year round. A community-owned non-profit company that offers beautiful nature trails, tours of the historical Laflèche caves, and the province's largest aerial park for the adventurous (includes several ziplines). Calling ahead for reservations is highly recommended.

*'''Eco-Odyssée''' (819) 459-2551 [http://www.eco-odyssee.ca/] Another great option for nature lovers close to Wakefield. A water maze that's great for learning about the local marsh environments.

*'''Great Canadian Bungee''' [http://bungee.ca] is for the adventurous-inclined.


===Film theatres and cinemas===

Ottawa has many movie theatres to choose from, but there are also a few that specialize in "foreign" films, early releases, old returning films and specialty films. The '''Bytowne Cinema''' is on Rideau Street near King Edward and has a detailed online schedule [http://bytowne.ca/]. The '''Mayfair Theatre''' is found at 1074 Bank St. near Sunnyside [http://mayfairtheatre.ca/]. In addition, the '''Canadian Film Institute''' screens films at the National Library and Archives building on Wellington and is a favourite of the specialist film crowd  [https://www.cfi-icf.ca/festivals].

There is also '''Algonquin College''' [http://algonquincollege.com] and the francophone '''Cité Collégiale''' [http://lacitec.on.ca].

==Work==
The Federal Government is the region's largest employer with the high-tech sector firmly in second place.  Unless you are a Canadian resident, you will need a work visa to work in Ottawa, and some Federal Government jobs require Canadian citizenship.

[[Image:Market Byward.JPG|thumb|ByWard Market]]

*The '''ByWard Market''' [http://byward-market.com/] area of downtown Ottawa, located east of the Rideau Canal and the Chateau Laurier, is the area's most popular shopping district.  In summer, stalls selling fresh produce and flowers line the streets, but even in the middle of winter there are some hardy vendors braving the cold — and maple syrup bought here costs half the price of souvenir shops elsewhere in the city. In the evening, the market shuts down and the area's restaurants, pubs and bars take over as the primary attraction, alongside many street performers.

*'''Sparks Street''' [http://sparksstreetmall.com/home.htm] is a pleasant pedestrian street one block off Parliament Hill and a common tourist throughfare for seeing the sights.  Along this street you'll find the majority of the tourist shops selling postcards, magnets, and maple syrup.  The Astrolabe Gallery, located on this street, is a treasure trove of antique maps as well as vintage posters.  There are several outdoor cafes and restaurants to choose from also.

*'''Westboro Village''' [http://westborovillage.com/] In recent years a stretch along Richmond Road in the "near west" of Ottawa from Golden Avenue east to Tweedsmuir Avenue has become a popular tourism and shopping zone, and includes several outdoor stores (clothing and equipment), restaurants and coffee shops. Notable shops include the Mountain Equipment Coop [http://mec.ca/], Bushtukah [http://bushtukah.com/], Trailhead [http://www.trailhead.ca], Ten Thousand Villages, Starbucks, Bridgehead (fair trade coffee), Kitchenalia, a chocolatier and several others. (Richmond Road becomes the western part of Wellington St. from Island Park Drive and a second strip of shops and restaurants runs along Wellington from Island Park Drive to Holland.)

*<buy name="Bank Street Promenade" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" url="http://www.bankstreet.ca/index.html" hours="" price="" lat="" long="">Great mix of stores ranging from chain restaurants to specialty shops.  District extends from Wellington St to Gladstone Ave.</buy>

Larger '''shopping malls''' include the Rideau Centre [http://rideaucentre.net/] (downtown),  St. Laurent Shopping Centre [http://stlaurent-centre.com/] (East Central),  Place D'Orleans [http://placedorleans.com/] (East End), the Bayshore Shopping Centre [http://bayshore.shopping.ca/cambridge/jsp/index_flash.jsp?mallid=bay] and Carlingwood Mall [http://carlingwood.com/] (West End).

The last Saturday in May, Ottawa's Glebe neighbourhood hosts the annual '''Great Glebe Garage Sale'''. Hundreds of residents set-up tables in their garages or on their lawns and sell used goods ranging from household knick-knacks to electronics to clothing. Businesses in the area also hold sidewalk sales, and vendors sell artwork, baking, and refreshments. Driving and parking during the sale itself is unnecessary and nearly impossible. Arrive on foot or park and walk into the neighbourhood. For parking, and for the best deals (especially on larger items like furniture), arrive early. The event is bustling by 8 AM but continues well into the afternoon. Vendors are encouraged to donate a portion of their proceeds to the Ottawa Food Bank.

==Eat==
{{style|[[Listings|listings format]]}}
Ethnic foods from around the world are available at a wide variety of restaurants and street vendors throughout the city.  The ByWard Market area has a wide selection of different cuisines; the Chinatown area is along Somerset Ave. between Bronson Ave. and Preston St; Little Italy runs along the length of Preston Street, from Carling Avenue to Albert Street.

[[Image:Food Beavertail.JPG|thumb|Ottawa's claim to culinary fame: a classic beavertail with sugar and cinnamon]]
Also try the tasty '''BeaverTail''' [http://beavertails.ca/], a doughy, deep-fried pastry associated with Ottawa, although a number of places claim to have created it.  It's available in sweet and savory versions, topped with cinnamon, sugar, icing sugar, etc.  In the winter, many places will offer it on the canal.  During the summer, the only place downtown to offer it is in the Byward Market on George St.  There are a variety of toppings and the taste of the beaver tail arguably stands out more with the classic sugar & cinnamon. However, the locals' favourite is the ''Killaloe Sunrise'', a topping of cinnamon sugar and lemon juice.

'''Coffee Shops''' are found throughout the city, and include dozens of two specialty chains '''Second Cup''' and '''Starbucks''', in addition to the mainstream '''Tim Horton's''' (seemingly planted at every intersection). '''Bridgehead''' [http://bridgehead.ca], is a local fair trade coffee house and can be found at over a dozen locations. Try their small double shot lattes, which are significantly better than their competitors'. In the Byward Market, ''Planet Coffee'' offers coffee and store-baked treats. There are several coffee houses in Little Italy, on Preston Street. One of the most popular, '''Pasticceria Gelateria Italiana''' (200 Preston Street, 613-594-5303), also houses an award-winning pastry shop [http://ottawawedding.com/cakegalleria/]. Other local favourites with locations downtown include '''Equator Coffee Roasters''' [http://equator.ca] and '''Little Victories''' [http://lvcoffee.ca] which both roast their own beans locally, "Bar Robo" inside the city's first food hall Queen St Fare,and '''Ministry of Coffee''' [http://theministryofcoffee.com] which brings in beans from some of the best independent roasters across the country. All three have locations downtown on Elgin Street.

For the best non-Canadian eats, head down Somerset Street West near Bronson to the heart of Chinatown. Here you have a choice of places for Vietnamese, Thai, Cantonese, etc. Among the Vietnamese soup-houses, '''Pho Bo Ga''' and '''Pho Bo Ga La''', are well-rated. The '''Yangtze Restaurant''' and '''Chu Shing Restaurant''' (across the street from it) are large box Chinese restaurants popular with Ottawa's Chinese clientele.  The '''Jadeland Restaurant''' is a small popular Chinese restaurant set in a converted house and has been well reviewed for its tasty dishes and low prices.  Another good source for ethnic foods is the stretch on Rideau between King Edward and the bridge to Vanier. You can find Middle Eastern, African and Asian food there.  

===Budget===
Ottawa probably has more shawarma and falafel restaurants than any other place on Earth (outside of the Arab World, of course) and most of them will serve up a great shawarma for around $5.  Their busy times are typically weekdays at lunch-hour, and on weekends after the bars close.  The Market and Elgin St. both have many restaurants and pubs to choose from. The usual range of diners, bagel shops and fast food restaurants can be found in shopping areas throughout the city.

You will also find "chip wagons" or "chip trucks" parked in various locations around the city at lunch time. They serve hamburgers, hot dogs, sausages, pogos (deep fried, breaded hot dogs on a stick), chips (french fries) and poutine (french fries covered with cheddar cheese curd and gravy - very popular in Quebec and eastern Ontario). In the summer month, upscale food trucks make an appearance as well, following the craze in other North American cities.

*'''3 Brothers''', 160 Rideau (''Byward Market'') For a local fast-food chain, the food is surprisingly good, if you don't mind a limited menu: poutine or shawarma, take your pick.
*'''Ahora''', 307 Dalhousie (''Byward Market''). A good little Mexican canteen. It serves up mains, zippy margaritas, and drinks imported from Mexico.
* '''La Bottega Nicastro''', 64 George Street (''Byward Market''). A fantastic little Italian specialty market, La Bottega also features the best $5 sandwiches the city knows, featuring amazing bread (esp. the focaccia) usually baked on the premises. The sit-down lunch kitchen is also well worth a visit.
* '''Burgers n' Fries Forever''', 329 Bank Street (''Downtown'') and 278 Dalhousie Street (''Byward Market'') serves up handmade burgers and crispy fries.
* '''Co Cham''', 780 Somerset St West (''Chinatown''). Their inexpensive ''bánh mì'' (Vietnamese submarine sandwiches) are sure to please even the most thrifty eater. '''My Hang''' (just down the street at 788 Somerset St W) is another great choice for bánh mì. Both serve ''phở'' (noodle soup) as well.
* '''DiRienzo's Deli''', 111 Beech Street (''just west of Preston Street'').  This little deli tucked away in Little Italy, a secret known to many locals, is famous for the best and freshest deli sandwiches in the city for $6 (taxes included).  During the week the lineup can stretch outside the packed little store, but they are arguably the fastest sandwich makers anywhere so don't worry about a long wait.  There is also another newer location run by the family at Meadowlands Drive and Fisher Avenue.
* '''Elgin Street Diner''', 374 Elgin Street (''downtown''). A popular 24-hour diner. One of its specialties is the ESD (Elgin Street Diner) Poutine (though true Quebecers should probably abstain). Generally, poutine is French fries, served with cheese curds and gravy on top; they have several versions including the addition of caramelized onions and bacon, Montreal smoked meat, Philly steak, a four cheese blend or Chili.  The substitution of mashed potatoes fried with onions and seasoning (called their home fries), or onion rings instead of regular French fries is also an option. Expect the adventure to set you back $6-8 depending on toppings. The diner's hamburgers/cheeseburgers are significantly better than typical fast food fare, and breakfast is served 24/7 365 days a year with no exception.
* '''Habesha''', 574 Rideau St (''Charlotte and Rideau, east of the Byward Market''). Serves a variety of Ethiopian food, including platters for 2 or 3 people. Licensed.
* '''The Horn of Africa''', 364 Rideau Street (''Rideau and King Edward, east of the Byward Market''). Serves reasonably priced and tasty Ethiopian food. A platter for two sampling various vegetable and meat dishes will run you around $20. They are also licensed to serve liquor.
<!-- * '''India Curry House''', 114 Gloucester (''at O'Connor, near the business district''). -->
<!-- * '''Hot Peppers''', 209 Queen on Somerset (just off Kent). Be sure to try the coconut rice. -->
*'''Rangoon''', 114 Gloucester (''Centretown, near O'Connor''). Family-run Burmese restaurant, with lunch specials for around $10.  Try the mohinga, a fish noodle soup, or one the chicken or eggplant curry. Hard to beat for something a little bit different, delicious and cheap!   
* '''Rose's Cafe''', (in the Market and one on Gladstone). Indian.
* '''Shanghai''', 651 Somerset (''Chinatown''). A local favourite since 1971. Handed down through a local family since the beginning, it boasts drag-queen karaoke on Saturday nights, frequent vernissages for Ottawa's up-and-coming artists, and some of the best Asian cuisine in town.
* '''Zak's''' [http://zaksdiner.com/], 14 Byward Market Square (''Byward Market''). A 24-hour diner in the ByWard Market, has Ottawa's best milkshakes. They're really good, made with ice-cream, and for the $5.50 they cost you get a large glass full plus the shaker with what didn't fit in the glass. Other dishes are quite good, with a "more calories for your money" attitude (as illustrated by the massive amount of milkshake served), which is nicely honest about fast food; however it may seem a bit expensive as some of the burgers are in excess of $12. Late on week-end nights (2 - 3AM) it's packed as people go for their after-bar poutine.

===Mid-range===
Major restaurant areas can be found on Elgin Street, on Bank Street in Centretown, on Bank Street in the Glebe, in Westboro and in the Byward Market, with entrees ranging from $12-$25. Similar restaurants can be found in major suburban shopping areas too.

* '''Bite''', 108 Murray St (''Byward market''). Burgers, but good ones. Entrees $11-15.
* '''The Buzz''', 374 Bank Street (''downtown''). A favourite for those looking for a meal in a little bar with great ambience and attractive people. Great mixed drinks.
* '''da Sergio''' 338 Preston Street, is an owner operated authentic Italian Bistro with attention to detail in its appetizers, pasta, sauces and secondi. Calamari are fresh and melt-in-your-mouth, and the Carpaccio served simply with capers, olive oil and parmesan curls.  They have a large patio with shade making it a good spot for a sunny summer afternoon or evening.
* '''East India Company''' (''Somerset, between Metcalfe and Elgin'').
* '''El Camino''', 380 Elgin St (''Elgin'') Excellent Mexican fusion food. Take-out available (tacos only) or eat-in. Tacos $4–6, entrees $15–$20, prices pretty good considering the quantity.
* '''Johnny Farina's''', Elgin St, [http://johnnyfarina.com/]. 
* '''The French Baker''', 19 Murray St (''Byward Market''). Ottawa's best croissants. In the back is '''Benny's Bistro''' which offers a great constantly-evolving breakfast menu, but at prices higher than your typical greasy spoon.
* '''Mello's''', Murray Street. (''Byward Market'') Good diner, has gone somewhat upscale since its greasy spoon days (RIP Leila), but still boasts lots of local colour. Good for breakfast after a night of drinking. '''OTTAWA TRIVIA''': one former Mello's employee went on to achieve notoriety as a serial killer.
* '''Ola Cochina''', 62 Barrette St (''Beechwoord/Vanier North''). Delightful Mexican eatery situated in the small lower floor of a house. Great, filling breakfasts. Located behind the Beechwood Metro.
* '''Pressed cafe''', 750 Gladstone (''Centretown west''). Locally semi-famous waffle brunch.
* '''Pub Italia''', 434 1/2 Preston Street (''near Dow's Lake and the Experimental Farm''), [http://pubitalia.ca/].  An Irish/Italian pub with hundreds of bottled beers listed in its "Beer Bible". Noted for its intimate faux Medieval/Gothic décor. 
* '''The Highlander Pub''', The Highlander Pub in the Byward Market is a solid restaurant with good pub fare, and traditional Scottish food, such as haggis. It is a good place also after a long day of sightseeing and you need a drink, with any spirit, wine or beer you can think of. It has a warm, friendly environment, with plenty of patio room. An average tab for a full meal for 2 should be about $40 CND.
* '''Santé Restaurant''', 45 Rideau St, [http://santerestaurant.com/]. At the corner of Rideau and Sussex, across from the Rideau Centre, is cosmopolitan yet casual. It’s a delicate line to walk, but Santé Restaurant does it with panache - offering exotic Asian Fusion and Thai cuisine in a comfortably elegant setting.
* '''Shawarma Palace''', 464 Rideau St (''Sandy Hill''). Not the cheapest shawarma joint, but one of the best. Expect a lineup around dinnertime. The west end location, 2949 Carling Ave.                            is also very good. The portions are greater than your money value.
* '''Vineyards''', in the ByWard Market, [http://vineyards.ca/]. An excellent restaurant with the widest selection of world beers and wines in Ottawa.
* '''The Works''' 362 Richmond Road in Westboro, 580 Bank Street in the Glebe, 363 St. Laurent Boulevard in Manor Park, and various suburban locations, [http://worksburger.com/]. Hard to argue that these are not the best burgers around. The selection is top notch and toppings are bountiful. Also served are delicious onion rings, milk shakes and cold beer, all in a funky industrial decor. Expect to pay $12 for a burger with sides, and not to regret it.

===Splurge===
Ottawa has excellent options for fine dining if you feel like spending a bit extra. Budget C$150 for a three course dinner for two, including wine and gratuity.

* '''Atelier''', 540 Rochester St (''Preston/Little Italy''). For the foodie's foodie, this modern restaurant boasts a dozen-course menu of impeccable quality with no substitutions available and prices in the sell-your-kidney range. An experience you'll tell your kids about, if you can afford to have any.
* '''[http://beckta.com/main.php Beckta]''', 226 Nepean St (''Elgin''). Excellent modern restaurant with a variety of tastes centred around locally available foods. Extensive wine list.
* '''[http://restaurant18.com/ E18hteen]''', 18 York St (''Byward Market''). Upscale, modern restaurant and bar located in a renovated 19th century heritage building. It is THE place to see and be seen.
* '''Fauna''' 425 Bank St (''Centretown''). Relatively new foodie restaurant serving a variety of locally sourced small-plate dishes. Good food, but priced accordingly.
* '''Issac's 64 Hundred''' [http://issacs.ca/], 6400 Hazeldean Road (''West End/Stittsville''), is a fine dining restaurant with a Mediterranean flair.
* '''[http://merlotottawa.com Merlot]''', 100 Kent St (''Centretown'') Located in the Marriott Hotel, has received glowing reviews for its cuisine. Ottawa's only revolving restaurant.  
* '''[http://brookstreet.ca/dining/dining_perspectives_restaurants.htm Perspectives]''', 525 Legget Drive (''Kanata''). Fine dining featuring a fusion of Oriental flavours with top-quality regional ingredients.
* '''[http://lcbottawa.com/English/signatures/index.cfm Signatures]''', 453 Laurier Ave. East (''Sandy Hill''). Located at Le Cordon Bleu Culinary Institute, this French restaurant boasts a five-diamond rating from CAA/AAA and is considered among the very best in the city.

===Vegetarian and Vegan===

* '''The Green Door''' at 198 Main St offers a vegetarian and vegan buffet and is the oldest vegetarian restaurant in Ottawa. It offers private and communal tables. Meals are priced by weight, and average around $12 for a full plate.

* '''Govinda's Restaurant''' on Somerset East (just off the University of Ottawa) offers a simple vegan buffet for $5-$7. The best cheap eats in town. Operated by ISCKON (Hare Krishna movement).  Only open weekdays from 17:00 to 20:00

* '''So Good Restaurant''' on Somerset (1.5 blocks West of Bronson) has a separate vegetarian menu (dishes are also vegan unless stated) and there are many choices . Try anything "Wu Se" (peanut sauce). Dinners are about $10 (entree and rice).

The most popular bar areas are in the ByWard Market, along Wellington Avenue in Westboro and along both Elgin Street and Bank Street between Somerset and Gladstone in the Centretown area. There are pubs and bars scattered throughout the city as well.

You can also take a small trip over the Ottawa river to [[Gatineau]]. Bars on Ottawa side close at 2:00 AM, though the province of Québec has a last call of 3:00 AM, an exception is made in Gatineau where bars also close at 2:00 AM.

Note that smoking is not permitted in Ontario or Quebec restaurants and bars. A new bylaw, which came in force in 2012, also bans smoking on the patios of bars in Ottawa.

==Contact==
The area codes for Ottawa are '''613''' and the overlay code '''343'''. Ten-digit dialing (area code+local number) is required for all local calls.

==Stay safe==
Ottawa is a very safe place to live and visit, so if you use common sense it is at least as safe as any other city.  There are many tourists in the city, especially in summer months, and there are very few incidents of robbery or assault.

That said, buses and transit stations have had issues in recent years with violence and swarmings/robberies, even during daytime hours. OC Transpo has hired new constables and placed plainclothes security as well as cameras on select buses and trains to counter the problem. Use common sense, especially when riding at night, every transit station has multiple emergency call boxes.  After dark, take extra care in areas near downtown such as Lowertown, and also Hintonburg, Vanier, Bayshore, Ledbury, Heatherington, Caldwell and South Keys. These neighbourhoods are known to have gang presence, and drug problems. Ottawa is generally very safe, but like any other city it has bad apples.

Also, Ottawa has a notoriously bad homeless problem, especially around the Rideau Street area. Panhandlers are often quite polite and not at all aggressive.

Ottawa is the fourth coldest capital city by annual average temperature, but it has the second coldest January, only topped by Ulan Bator, Mongolia. Add to that nearly 3m (10') of snow per average winter and throw in an ice storm from time to time, winter can be a challenge but locals do a great job of handling it particularly with recreation. Summers are (normally) short, hot and humid. Dress for the weather!

==Get out==
Just across the river from Ottawa is [[Gatineau]], which has the stunning Canadian Museum of History and some mighty good restaurants too. There is a scenic national park of the same name just to the northwest, with high cliffs and deep, clear lakes. In this area lies:
* [[Wakefield]], 30-45 min by car north of Ottawa, a picturesque village on the Gatineau River in the Gatineau Hills. It is on the Quebec side of the river but is predominantly English-speaking.

To the south east of Ottawa is a large flat rural area consisting mostly of small commuter towns, agricultural villages, and the occasional woodland. This lowland is sprawled over eight counties and stretches all the way to Montreal and the United States border, hundreds of kilometres away. In this agricultural hinterland lies:
* [[Merrickville]], 45 min by car south of Ottawa, claims to be Canada's prettiest village.
* [[Perth (Ontario)|Perth]], 1 hour south, a very scenic town with mills, and heritage buildings. 
* [[Carp]], a tiny village 10 km north of Ottawa, houses the surreal Cold War "Central Emergency Government Headquarters" (Diefenbunker), now a museum.

To the west of Ottawa lies more rugged terrain. The Madawaska Highlands, which start about 90km to the northwest, is a sparsely inhabited wilderness area composed of miles upon miles of lakes and forests. In this area lies:
* [[Greater Madawaska]], the Calabogie Ski resort about 1 1/2 hour west of Ottawa.

To the north of Ottawa lies [[Renfrew County]], the heart of what is know colloquially as the Ottawa Valley. Though Ottawa lies geologically in the Ottawa Valley, as a colloquial term it is used to refer to the cultural region to the north of Ottawa.    

Beyond the Ottawa region lie other Canadian cities, such as:
* [[Montreal]], the largest city in Quebec, is 200km east. The largest French-speaking city outside of Europe.
* [[Toronto]], Canada's largest city, is about 500km to the southwest.
* [[Kingston (Ontario)|Kingston]], about 200km to the southwest, on the way to Toronto. An old city composed of limestone buildings and home to Queen's University, one of Canada's most prestigious universities.
