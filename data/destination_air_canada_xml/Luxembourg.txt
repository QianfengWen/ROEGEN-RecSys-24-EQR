The '''Grand Duchy of Luxembourg''' (Luxembourgish: ''Groussherzogtum Lëtzebuerg'', French:''Grand-Duché de Luxembourg'', German: ''Großherzogtum Luxemburg''), is a landlocked country in the [[Benelux]] bordered by [[Belgium]], [[France]] and [[Germany]] which lies at the crossroads of Germanic and Latin cultures. It is the only Grand Duchy in the world and is the second-smallest of the [[European Union]] member states.

With a successful steel, finance and high technology industry, a strategic location at the heart of Western Europe, more natural beauty than you might expect given its size, and as one of the three richest countries in the world, Luxembourg enjoys a very high standard of living - and has prices to match!

==Understand==

===History===
The city of Luxembourg proper was founded in 963, and its strategic position soon promised it a great fate. Luxembourg was at the crossroads of Western Europe and became heavily fortified, and you can still see the extensive city walls and towers which are the most distinctive aspect of the cityscape. Due to its key position, Luxembourg was raised up to a Duchy that included a much larger territory that stretched into present-day Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, and France. The powerful Habsburg family kept its hands on it until late Renaissance times.

After the Napoleonic wars, the Duchy of Luxembourg was granted to the Netherlands. It had a special status as a member of the German Confederation, and the citadel was armed with a Prussian garrison: Luxembourg was still a strategic lock that everybody aimed at controlling. It was granted the title "Grand Duchy" in 1815 but lost some territories that are today parts of France and Germany.

During the course of the 19th century, developments in warfare and the appearance of artillery made Luxembourg obsolete as a stronghold, and it became little more than a rural territory of no strategic interest. The Germans relinquished their rights over it and moved their garrison out, its western half was granted to Belgium in 1839, and the Netherlands granted it complete independence in 1867. Since then, Luxembourg has arisen from a poor country of fields and farms to a modern economy relying on financial services and high-tech industries.

Overrun by Germany in both world wars, Luxembourg was one of the major battlefields of the '''Battle of the Bulge''' in the winter of 1944-1945, a story well documented in the museum at [[Diekirch]]. The state ended its neutrality in 1948 when it entered into the [[Benelux]] Customs Union, and it joined NATO the following year. In 1957, Luxembourg became one of the six founding countries of the European Economic Community (later the European Union), and it joined the euro currency area in 1999.

===Climate===
Modified continental with mild winters, although January and February can get very cold and temperatures can fall to as low as -15°C. The summer can be very hot in Luxembourg, with temperatures in July and August reaching around 30+°C.

===Terrain===
Mostly gently rolling uplands with broad, shallow valleys; uplands to slightly mountainous in the north; steep slope down to Moselle flood plain in the south.

===Holidays===
*'''National holiday''' : National Day falls on the 23rd June. (Birthday of Grand Duchess Charlotte moved by 6 months to coincide with the warmer weather)

{{Schengen}}

Citizens of the above countries/territories - '''except''' for [[Antigua and Barbuda]], the [[Bahamas]], [[Barbados]], [[Mauritius]], [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]] and [[Seychelles]] - are permitted to work in Luxembourg without having to obtain any authorization during the period of the 90-day visa-free stay. However, this visa exemption does not necessarily extend to other Schengen countries.

For a non-EEA or non-Swiss national to stay in Luxembourg for more than 90 days, a temporary stay authorization (''autorisation de séjour temporaire'') must be obtained before arriving in Luxembourg. This is done by sending an application to the Immigration Directorate in Luxembourg or, in some cases, to the Luxembourg Embassy responsible for your place of residence; the application is free of charge. If the stay authorization is granted, no visa is required for citizens of visa-exempt countries, but they must enter Luxembourg and register with the local authorities within 90 days of the date on the letter; citizens of non-visa-exempt countries must obtain a visa within 90 days. Once in Luxembourg, a residence permit (''titre de séjour'') must then be applied for within three months of arrival. [http://www.guichet.public.lu/citoyens/fr/immigration/en/plus-3-mois/index.html]

In 2021 it will be possible to apply for the [https://www.etiasvisa.com/etias-countries/luxembourg-etias ETIAS for Luxembourg]. People out of EU who don't need a visa to get in Luxembourg could apply to this new authorization program. However, it's also recommended to check the conditions depending where you come from.

All foreigners must register with the local authorities within three business days of arrival in Luxembourg; EU nationals normally have eight days to do so. If staying in a hotel, this is normally done by the hotel.

===By plane===
[http://www.luxairport.lu/en/ '''Luxembourg-Findel International Airport'''] ({{IATA|LUX}}) is 6km outside Luxembourg-City. Easily accessible from the city center using the free and frequent bus services numbers 29 and 16. It is served by Luxair [http://www.luxair.lu], the national airline, which flies to many EU countries (including [[Milan]] and [[London]] Heathrow and City), Ryanair ([[Barcelona]], [[Lisbon]]), EasyJet ([[London]] Gatwick, [[Porto]]), Air France ([[Paris]]; actually a Luxair codeshare), KLM ([[Amsterdam]]), Swiss ([[Zurich]]), Lufthansa ([[Frankfurt]]; actually a Luxair codeshare), SAS ([[Copenhagen]]), British Airways ([[London]] Heathrow) and Turkish Airlines ([[Istanbul]]). Another airline to consider is CityJet (owned by Air France), often a cheaper option than Luxair. A completely new terminal opened in May 2008, and the airport site [http://www.lux-airport.lu/] has information about all flights.

Alternative airports, especially for low-cost carriers, include Ryanair hub [[Hahn]] (aka "Frankfurt-Hahn"), about two hours away by direct [http://www.flibco.com Flibco bus], Saarbrucken Airport (accessible by bus from Luxembourg train station) and [[Brussels]]-South Charleroi, served by Flibco bus.

===By train===
Luxembourg train station can be reached directly from [[Paris]] (2 hours), [[Metz]] (1 hour), [[Brussels]] (3 hours), [[Liège]] (2 hours 40 min) and [[Trier]] (43min). Both international and national timetables can be found on the website of the national railways' company CFL [http://www.cfl.lu/CFLInternet/Espaces/01EspaceVoyageurs].

The InterCity trains coming from [[Belgium]] ([[Brussels]] and [[Liège]]) are jointly organized by SNCB (Belgium railways) and CFL (Luxembourg railways). These are national and international at the same time. Therefore SNCB national fares (standard ticket, passes, subscriptions, ...) are valid until the last train station before the Luxembourg border. These stations on the Belgium side of the border are [[Arlon]] when coming from Brussels and Gouvy when coming from Liège. No reservations are needed on InterCity trains coming from Belgium.

===By car===
Motorways from [[Metz]] (A3), [[Brussels]] (A6), and [[Trier]] (A1) connect to the ring road around Luxembourg City, from which most other parts of the country can be reached. 

If you want to enjoy a nice view to the city, "Grund" and Kasematten, leave the motorway coming from the East ([[Germany]]) at exit "Cents". Enter Cents and drive down the hill. Don't let yourself be stopped by signs that the route is blocked via "Grund".

===By bus===
Aside from the airport buses listed above, sometimes there are commuter buses to [[Trier]] and [[Bitburg]]. The train is a far more preferable option for entering the country from nearby. From [[Saarbrücken]] there are direct bus connections [http://www.cfl.lu/cflinternet/espaces/02espaceevasion/0_general/news/luxemburgsaarbrckenexpress2012.htm]. This bus is rather expensive (€9 - €16 return) but it cheaper if bought in combination with a German or French rail ticket.

===By boat===
Luxembourg being a landlocked country, it's extremely hard to get in by boat. But if you really want to, there are boat links from the German side of the Moselle River to the Luxembourg side, but it is easier walking over the bridges.

==Get around==
[[Image:Train CFL.JPG|thumb|CFL regional train]]

Luxembourg is a compact country and it's possible to reach almost any place in the country from the capital in under an hour.  The central railway station has a handy '''Mobilitéit''' [http://www.mobiliteit.lu/] office that will help to plan your trip by bus and train.

In February 2020, Luxembourg became the first country in the world to make '''all public transport within the country (buses, trams, and trains) free to use'''. There are a few exceptions, including first-class travel on trains, certain night bus services, and cross-border travel, where you must still buy a ticket.

===By train===
The '''Chemins de Fer Luxembourgeois''' ('''CFL''') [http://www.cfl.lu/] train network is either comprehensive or spartan, depending on whether you want to go south or north. While the south is reasonably well covered, the north is limited to one main line (Ligne 10) which runs from Luxembourg City via Mersch, Ettelbrück, Wilwerwiltz, Clervaux, and Troisvierges. The line continues north into [[Belgium]] towards Liège. [[Diekirch]] has a branch line from Ettelbrück, and Wiltz has a branch line from Kautenbach. To the south, you can reach Bettembourg and Esch-sur-Alzette. There is also a line to the east which crosses into [[Germany]] over the Moselle River at Wasserbillig.

Trains in Luxembourg generally run very much on time and are modern and comfortable. As all standard-class travel within Luxembourg is free, this is a good mode of transport to use when possible.

From an aesthetic view, perhaps the best way to approach Luxembourg City is by train from the north via Ligne 10 as this is a beautifully scenic route past some of the most well-known Luxembourgish sights.

===By tram===
The Luxtram network is currently limited to Luxembourg City. There is only one line that runs from the Gare Centrale (Central Station) through the old city center (Hamilius) towards the Kirchberg business district. And the opposite direction from the Gare the line extends to Lycée Technique de Bonnevoie with construction ongoing to extend even further. It is the most convenient way to travel in Luxembourg City. The tram runs every 4 minutes in both directions during peak hours, while only every 15 minutes during off-peak hours.

===By bus===
Within the city, the comprehensive bus service is more than adequate for the average tourist. Buses numbered 1-31 serve the Ville de Luxembourg. Many buses pass the central point "Hamilius" or "Monterey" (convenient for the center of town) and the "Gare Centrale" (Central Station) or "Gare Rocade" (behind the Central Station) on their routes at some point. Any bus pointing stationward's from Hamilius will probably take you there (the 3 being a notable exception).

The bus service out of town is also extensive and reliable. Every village has a convenient bus service which runs at least once every hour. Buses numbered 100 upwards will take you out of the city. Useful routes to the north of the country include the 100 (Diekirch via Junglinster, every hour), the 120 (Junglinster, every 30 minutes), and the 290 (Mersch, frequent). However, Mersch and the south are more easily reached by train (see below). The 118 goes East to Wasserbillig and Trier from Hamilius and Bvd JFK in Kirchberg.

Town buses experienced reduced service on Saturdays (including those used mainly by shoppers), and many routes barely existed (if at all) on a Sunday. This doesn't matter, though, since most shops and attractions are closed on Sunday.

Almost all national buses run the same on Saturdays (which count as working days in this instance) as during the week, but the Sunday service is usually reduced or non-existent.

===By car===
Luxembourg's road infrastructure is well-developed if not always very well thought-out. Anywhere that happens to lie along the major motorways is easily accessible via these (including Grevenmacher in the east, Mamer to the west, and Bettembourg to the south). Esch-Alzette, the country's second city (more like a small town by international standards) has its own motorway link, the A4. In addition, a new motorway, the A7, was recently completed which goes to Ettelbrück in the center of Luxembourg. 

Current national speed limits are 50km/h in towns and villages, 90km/h on open country roads (110km/h on some places on N7 when it does not rain), and 130km/h on the motorway (110 in the rain). 70km/h also exists in some places. Speed limits are enforced by random police checks and cameras on certain segments of motorway and near the ends to motorways. Be aware that if you have a right-hand-drive car then you are very likely to be singled out for a customs check on the way in. Police are also very keen on stopping drivers from having the 'wrong' lights on in town, i.e. side lights instead of dipped headlights.

Driving in Luxembourg is nowhere as testing as in other European countries. The locals are polite, even when entering roundabouts. When entering the highways from the side roads into the slower traffic lane, the other drivers will allow you to join the traffic line, but traffic indicators are essential. As with other highways in Europe always keep in the slow traffic lane, keeping the fast lane for overtaking. Some drivers travel at high speeds and will flash their headlights to indicate that they are in a hurry, even if they are sitting on the speed limit. Most of the time trucks keep in the slow lane at their regulated speed for large vehicles. They can be a little annoying when overtaking other trucks. The truck drivers seem to keep a watch out for other vehicles. Cars towing caravans can be a bit of a menace at times but staying alert will ensure there are no problems. The closing speeds of vehicles need to be watched if overtaking, as some drivers travel well in excess of the speed limits. 

Normal day-to-day driving in Luxembourg is a delight but traffic does slow down in peak times.  

====Parking====
The parking policy fees and policies differ in each municipality. Some have paid parking, others require the use of the European standard parking disc and some have free parking. Many municipalities also prohibit parking the car on the public road for more than 24 hours (Luxembourg City) or 48 hours (national limit) without moving it, this is not strictly enforced only when a complaint is given or when it suddenly becomes prohibited to park there due to road works, road cleaning or residents moving.

Finding parking in Luxembourg city center on weekends can be difficult. Most spaces are quickly taken and some parking garages close early. Traffic wardens are also numerous and vigilant. The Luxembourg government recommends using the [https://transports.public.lu/fr/mobilite/multimodalite/park-and-ride-p-r.html Park and Ride (P+R)] parking which are located all over the country and in neighboring countries where one can switch easily to public transport or rent a bike. The [https://www.vdl.lu/fr/se-deplacer/en-voiture/parkings-et-pr/bouillon P+R Bouillon] and [https://www.vdl.lu/fr/se-deplacer/en-voiture/parkings-et-pr/luxembourg-sud-a P+R Luxemburg Sud (Howald)] are located near the motorway, free up to 24 hours and provide excellent connections with public transport.

===By bike===
The streets and landscape in Luxembourg make for good biking territory; Look for national biking paths ("PC" mark standing for "Piste Cyclable"). For bicycle repairs, neighboring Trier (with a considerable University student population) is usually a safer bet.

The city of Luxembourg offers a relatively inexpensive bike-sharing scheme, called Vel'oh: electric bikes with 30-40km range. These bikes can be found at specific stations all around the city and neighboring communes. Annual plans are an option, but for short-term, it costs 2€‎ for a day, or 5€‎ for 3 days.

==Talk==

Luxembourg is a multilingual nation. However, unlike most nations, language use is usually regulated by social situation rather than by local geography.

'''Luxembourgish''' ("Lëtzebuergesch") - a Germanic language that incorporates many French loan words - is the national language. It is spoken natively by just over half of the native population, and is the main language of television and radio broadcasts.

'''[[German phrasebook|German]]''' ("Hochdeutsch") enjoys official status in Luxembourg. It is taught in schools, is the language of the written press, court system, and church, and is almost universally understood by the local population.

That being said, everything else from road signs to menus, tannoy announcements, and information in stores, will appear in '''[[French phrasebook|French]]''', which is also the main language of the government. French, therefore, is clearly one of the most useful of the three official languages to know, particularly in the capital. This is also because many of the workers in the shops, bars, and restaurants in Luxembourg come from across the border in France and Belgium, driven by high rates of unemployment and the relatively high cost of living in Luxembourg itself. This essentially makes the capital, and the area to the south of the capital a predominately Francophone area for the visitor. This is less so northwards of the city, and in the areas close to the German border such as Diekirch or Echternach.

In total, foreign-born persons (including ''frontaliers'' and ''grenzgängers'' - guest-workers from Belgium/France and Germany) make up over 40% of the population of Luxembourg. The most common languages spoken by them, other than French and German, are [[Portuguese phrasebook|Portuguese]], [[Italian phrasebook|Italian]], and English.

Over 60% of the native population of Luxembourg are fluent in English, however, one should assume that the ''frontaliers'' do not speak any languages other than French and possibly German. Personnel such as bus drivers usually speak fluent English.

Apart from the more elderly inhabitants, virtually every Luxembourger understands and speaks fluent standard German and French, and many are also fluent in English. Unlike in Switzerland, where often "monolingual meets monolingual", Luxembourgers are true polyglots.

==See==
You may not expect it from one of the smallest countries in [[Europe]], but The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is a diverse land, full of beautiful nature and gorgeous historic monuments. Its turbulent history is filled with stories of emperors and counts as well as many battles and disputes. Today, the almost fairy-tale-like castles and fortresses are a faint but impressive reminder of those days, and amidst their lovely natural setting, they make some superb and picturesque sights.

Most of the country's population lives in rural areas and apart from the delightful historic [[Luxembourg (city)|City of Luxembourg]], the country's capital, settlements are mostly small. That said, the capital is a place not to be missed. It has a splendid location high on a cliff, overlooking the deep and narrow valleys of both the Alzette and Pétrusse rivers. Several parts of the old town are listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and the most interesting places include the '''Gothic Revival Cathedral of Notre Dame''', the town '''fortifications''' and of course the '''Grand Ducal Palace''', which is surrounded by charming cobblestoned lanes. However, there's far more to see, such as the '''Bock casemates, Neumünster Abbey''' and the '''Place d'Armes'''. There are several World War II memorial sites and a number of high-end museums, but just wandering through the old center, taking in the beautiful views from the '''Chemin de la Corniche''' and crossing bridges to the nearest plateaus is at least as great a way to discover the city.

The lively town of '''[[Echternach]]''' is the oldest city in Luxembourg. It boasts the country's most prominent religious structure, the '''basilica''' of the Abbey of Echternach where the country's patron saint Willibrord is buried. The annual Whit Tuesday celebrations in his honor involve lots of dancers in the town's old center and are a popular tourist attraction. Apart from its own sights, Echternach makes a great base to explore the beautiful '''[[Müllerthal]]''', better known as "Little Switzerland". Hike or bike through its dense forests with myriad streams and even some caves.

The romantic village of '''[[Vianden]]''' with its stunning medieval Beaufort castle is a tourists' favorite, and well worth a visit even despite the crowds in summer. The beautiful location of the fortress in the Our river valley, surrounded by tight forests and a lake with swans, gives it a typical fairy-tale castle look and feel. If you're done wandering the streets and exploring the Gothic churches and fortified towers of this charming town, visit the Victor Hugo house. Afterward, the pleasant cafés of the '''Grand Rue''' are a perfect place to kick back and enjoy. 

Head to '''[[Remich]]''' to start your own trip down the '''Route du Vin''' and discover the many fine wines that are produced here, in the '''Moselle Valley'''.

==Do==

==Buy==
===Currency===
{{Euro}}

If you know any coin collectors, take a few local coins as keepsakes, since Luxembourgish coins are among the rarest of the euros &mdash; even in Luxembourg, most of your change will be in other countries' coins!

Debit cards such as V PAY, Maestro, VISA Debit, and Debit MasterCard enjoy almost universal acceptance. Credit cards such as Visa and Mastercard are also widely accepted. Other card brands generally have a much lower acceptance rate.

===Prices===
Despite one of the lowest VAT rates in Europe (17%, with 3% for most restaurants and hotels), the general price level in Luxembourg is noticeably higher than in France and Germany, especially in central Luxembourg and particularly in any service-related fields.  Even cheap hotels tend to cost over &euro;100 a night and you won't get much change from &euro;20 after a modest dinner and a drink.  Basing yourself in [[Trier]] (or other cities across the border) and daytripping to Luxembourg might be a good bet.

On the upside, cigarettes, alcohol or petrol are comparatively cheap, making the small state a popular destination for long-haul drivers.

==Eat==
[[Image:JuddMatGaardebounen Beer.JPG|thumb|''Judd mat gaardebounen'', served with potatoes and washed down with a Diekirch beer]]

Traditional dishes are largely based on pork and potatoes and the influence of German and Central European cooking is undeniable.  The unofficial national dish is ''judd mat gaardebounen'', or smoked pork neck served with boiled broad beans. A must to try if you do get the opportunity are ''Gromperekichelchen'' (literally, Potato Biscuits) which are a type of fried shredded potato cake containing onions, shallots, and parsley. Typically found served at outdoor events such as markets or funfairs they are absolutely delicious and a particularly nice snack on a cold winter's day.

In most restaurants, however, the typical local food would be French cuisine coming in bigger portions. Italian food has been popular since the 1960s. Home cooking has been very influenced by the recipes of Ketty Thull, apparently the best-selling cooking and baking book in Luxembourg since WW II.

==Drink==

The drinking age in Luxembourg is '''16''', lower than in most of Europe.

The Luxembourg white wines from the Moselle Valley to the east of Luxembourg include Riesling, Pinot Gris, Pinot Blanc, Rivaner, and Elbling to name just a few, and are good. In autumn, many villages along the Moselle River organize wine-tasting village festivals.

Young people tend to drink local or imported beer. Luxembourg has a number of breweries, with '''Diekirch''', from [[Diekirch|the village of the same name]], Bofferding, Battin, and Mousel being the most popular. All are excellent lagers.

As an after-dinner digestive, Luxembourgers like to drink an ''eau-de-vie''. The most commonly available are ''Mirabelle'' and ''Quetsch''. Both are made from plums and are extremely strong! Sometimes these are taken in coffee which may be a little more palatable for some.

==Sleep==
Thanks to the heavy banking and EU presence, along with a wide range of congresses held in the city, hotels in central Luxembourg are generally expensive. For people on a budget, however, Luxembourg has an extensive network of campsites, especially Youth Hostels - there are currently nine of them around the country, including in [[Luxembourg (city)#Sleep|Luxembourg (city)]].

==Work==
Luxembourg is a major player in the financial service sector. Many thousands of people commute from neighboring Belgium, France (''Les frontaliers''), and Germany (''Die Grenzgänger'') on weekdays, considerably swelling the population of the capital city. The majority work in the numerous financial institutions based in and around the capital (particularly in the Kirchberg district) and are drawn across the borders by the excellent salaries on offer. Luxembourg City has a very international flavor as in addition to ''les frontaliers'', it attracts young professionals from all over the globe. In this area, business is done predominantly in English, French or German and it is necessary to be fluent in one of these as a minimum although many jobs will demand proficiency in at least two.

==Stay safe==
In many surveys, Luxembourg has been named the "safest country in the world"; if you follow the usual precautions, you should be fine. The area around the city center station, particularly on the rue de Strasbourg, is a little dubious; you may encounter people panhandling. There are also some dubious nightclubs in this area that visitors should stay clear of.

===Drugs===
Luxembourg legalized recreational cannabis in 2023, but only to grow and consume in private areas. It is still illegal to buy and sell cannabis. Public possession and consumption also remain illegal, however possession of up to 3g is decriminalized. You may be subject to a civil fine of between €25 and €500 if caught, however.

==Stay healthy==
The food and tap water supply in Luxembourg is perfectly fine and the country's healthcare system is first-class. The climate is average even though the summers can get hot. However, these temperatures rarely rise much above 30°C.

==Respect==
It is important to show respect for the local language and make some effort to say a word or two of it even if just the standard greeting ''"Moien".'' Avoid calling Luxembourgish a dialect of German or assert that the country itself is merely an extension of France or Germany. Keep in mind that Luxembourgers are very proud of their heritage and that Luxembourgish is no longer the most common native language in the country, as your first impression when arriving in the capital may suggest. Nevertheless, locals, especially those in the small towns and villages, are very friendly; saying "Hello" in whatever language will make you be greeted with a smile.
