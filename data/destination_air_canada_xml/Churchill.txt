A small town of just under 1,000 residents, is located on the western shore of Hudson Bay. Some of the town's most famous inhabitants are polar bears, this of course leading to its famous nickname, Polar Bear Capital of the World. Humans first arrived in Churchill around 1000 A.D. (the Thule Peoples) with the first Europeans arriving around the 1600s with promises of the fur trade. Churchill has now evolved from an industrial fur trading centre to a ecotourism driven community.

==Get in==

There are two major ways to get into Churchill: airplane and train.  

=== By plane ===

There are two airlines that fly into Churchill with varying schedules, Calm Air and Kivalliq Air.  Both Calm Air and Kivalliq Air fly into Churchill from Winnipeg, among other cities in the region.

=== By train ===

Taking the train to Churchill is much more affordable than flying, but takes much longer.  VIA Rail serves Churchill with its Hudson Bay line that begins in Winnipeg.  From Winnipeg the train takes about 36 hours.  You have the option of staying in one of several different sleeper cars, or riding in economy class (depending on how much you want to pay) and trying to find two empty seats to fall asleep on.  A viable solution for those who would like to get to Churchill relatively quickly, while not spending a relative fortune is flying from Winnipeg to Thompson, Manitoba, and then taking the train from there.  Be warned that the airport in Thompson is not within walking distance of the train station, but there are plenty of taxi drivers waiting to give Churchill bound travelers a ride to the airport.

The railroad was out of operation from 2017-18 due to flooding but service was fully restored in December 2018 and trains now run as per the normal schedule.

=== By car ===

There is no road to Churchill; however, you can drive to Thompson and pay to park your car there, and continue by train or airplane. You can also travel to nearby Gillam, Manitoba and also travel by train.

==Get around==
It's quite easy to walk within the city limits on one's own.  It's also possible to rent a car in Churchill, and there are several taxi drivers who tend to hang out around the airport and train station.

==See==

Polar Bears in their natural habitat.

Beluga Whales during the summer months in the Hudson Bay and Churchill River.  There are a couple of tour operators who take small groups out in boats for a couple of hours to watch the whales.  You can even rent a wetsuit and swim with the whales if the weather permits.  The summer is also a fabulous time to go bird watching in Churchill.

Late November through late March is the perfect time to watch the Northern Lights.  November is also one of the best times to see the world-famous Churchill polar bears.

{{warningbox|Don't go wandering outside of Churchill on your own.  Polar bears are extremely dangerous, especially during the summer months when food is scarce.  Talk to locals for advice before going outside of the town.Always keep a safe distance between you and them.}}
