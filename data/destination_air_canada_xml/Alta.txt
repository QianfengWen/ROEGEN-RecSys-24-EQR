* '''Prehistoric rock carvings - UNESCO World Heritage Site''' [http://www.alta.museum.no/index.asp]. Rock art is found in five separate areas in Alta, the largest being at Hjemmeluft/Jiepmaluokta, where Alta Museum is situated. This is the only area available to the public. In the summer season, groups are offered guided tours to the rock carvings. In the winter, the rock carvings are covered with snow, and not available to the public. The rock carvings in Alta were made by hunters and fishers in the Late Stone Age/Early Metal Age, between 6200 and 2000 years ago.

==Do==

The tourist information seems to move around on a daily basis, so the first thing you might do is wind up traveling all over Alta looking for it.  As of 27/06/2014, the information center is in the library (Bibliotek), in the city center in the same building as the cinema (Alta Kino).  (You may notice other information signs as you travel through Alta, but almost all of them point to centers that have closed.)
