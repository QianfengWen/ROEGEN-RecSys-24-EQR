===History===
Founded in 1549, Salvador was the capital in the heyday of the slave trade. The legacy remains today in its large Afro-Brazilian population, and the resulting culture in many ways outshines the rest of Brazil; in music, many of the greatest names from the mid-20th century to the present hail from Salvador, such as Dorival Caymmi, Gilberto Gil, and Caetano Veloso. In literature, the late Jorge Amado was also from the region. It's a vibrant, exciting city, and its people are quite friendly.

===Orientation===
Salvador is on a peninsula on the northeast coast of Brazil which shields the large ''Baía de Todos os Santos'' ("All Saints Bay") from the Atlantic Ocean. The city is the third largest in Brazil, sprawling for dozens of kilometers inland from the coast. Most visitors head for the coastal neighborhoods that cluster around where the bay meets the ocean.Salvador, Brazil has a tropical climate including rainforests and lush vegetation. 

A 100m cliff runs along the entire bayshore, dividing the city into '''Cidade Alta''', up on the cliff, and the '''Cidade Baixa''' down by the bay. The former features '''Pelourinho''', the old city center that packs historical sites, colonial architecture, museums, restaurants, bars, hostels, artisanal shops, and music/dance/capoeira academies into a convenient, albeit tourist-swarmed, set of winding cobblestone streets. The latter features a commercial center with lots of bus traffic coming in from all over Salvador.

Outside of this area, there are many beach districts that stretch from the tip of the peninsula northeast along the Atlantic coast. The '''Barra''' neighborhood at the tip of the peninsula is the main alternative jumping-off point to Pelourinho, and a little further to the northeast are the hip neighborhoods of '''Rio Vermelho''' and '''Amaralina''', which feature a nightlife less geared to the foreign tourism industry. A decent bus ride beyond these is the neighborhood of '''Itapuã''', which has an energetic beach side nightlife and relatively few foreign visitors. Northward from there are kilometers and kilometers of gorgeous beaches, all accessible by bus.

The bayshore coast north beyond Pelourinho features a more tranquil atmosphere and a locally patronized, though less scenic, beach life. The interior of Salvador is where the "new city" has developed, full of residential neighborhoods, shopping megaplexes, and knotted highways, all of which can be quite alienating without actually having a friend to show you around.

Local residents enjoy sharing their exotic dancing and music skills with tourists. Residents are also considered some of the friendliest people on the planet.Tourist are welcomed with open and friendly arms by the majority of local residents.

===People===
People of Salvador, as other people from the state of [[Bahia]], have a reputation of being relaxed, easygoing, and fun-loving, even by Brazillian standards. On the bad side, this is also interpreted as lazyness and disgust of working; in a way, people of Salvador have reputation opposite to people from [[São Paulo]]. It's questionable whether this reputation is true, as the behavior of pedestrians and drivers in traffic seems to contradict this. Regardless, few ''soteropolitanos'' seem to bother with this reputation, even the bad part of it, and some even make fun of their own supposed lazyness. Also, most people in Brazil agree that ''soteropolitanos'' are generally friendly and warm people.

==Get in== 

===By plane===
The [http://www.aeroportosalvador.net/en/salvador-international-airport-ssa Salvador's Deputado Luis Eduardo Magalhães International Airport] (IATA: SSA, ICAO: SBSV) is one of Brazil's main airports.  All of the biggest Brazilian airlines have flights to the Bahian capital city. The city also receives flights from the main hubs of Europe, South America and the United States.

Scheduled Airlines:

* LATAM (Domestic flights).
* Gol (Domestic flights and ''Buenos Aires'').
* Avianca (Domestic flights).
* Azul Linhas Aéreas (Domestic and regional flights).
* Passaredo (Regional flights).
* TAP ([[Lisbon]]).
* American Airlines ([[Miami]]).
* Condor ([[Frankfurt]]).
* Aerolineas Argentinas ([[Buenos Aires]]).
* Air Europa([[Madrid]]).

The airport is 28km from the city center (via the Paralela expressway) or 32km (via the seaside). Two kinds of taxis are available in the airport, the '''executive taxis''' (Coometas and Comtas), and the '''normal taxis''' (careful, they have bad reputation, taking travelers around and around to keep the meter running and most of them only speak Portuguese). Executive taxis are pre-paid, they have a table of prices rather than a meters. The other taxi option would be the '''normal taxis''' which are metered. The third option definitly is UBER, drivers have good reputation and are willing to do the best to please you at very reasonable prices. A fourth option would be the executive air-conditioned '''minibuses''' which depart every 20 minutes to the Praça da Sé, in downtown near ''Pelourinho'' via the seaside, stopping at famous beaches like Ondina, Pituba, Amaralina and Itapuã, and Barra as well as stopping by Shopping Barra--an American-style shopping mall located not too far from the Farol da Barra. The fare for these buses is R$5 - Busline 1001 in August 2023. You pay in cash at the bus. The journey from the airport to Barra takes around 1 hour depending on the traffic. 

Another option is the '''urban buses''' that go to many parts of the city (and have a known reputation for their lack of security as many assaults happen) but not an option if you have traditional luggage, for the tourist the options are Lapa, Campo Grande and São Joaquim buses, the best thing is ask the driver before taking an urban bus, the fare is R$3,80 (3.80 reals). Linha Verde executive buses go to ''Praia do Forte'' and depart often from the airport.

There is also a luxury bus called "First Class", leaving from the airport (turn right out the airport and walk to the final stand) that takes you to Praça da Sé at a cost of R28 pp, dropping off people on the way.

If you want to take the minibus or urban bus, they pick up behind the parking lot that is directly across from the arrivals exit. You will need to walk through the parking lot building at ground level till the end, then turn right to exit it. Be aware that there are no signs directing you to the place where the buses stop, you just have to find it yourself.

===By bus===
Salvador's long-distance bus station is in the middle of the new city, 14km from downtown. Salvador is accessible via scheduled buses from all around the country and from Paraguay. Inside the bus stations there are taxis (local taxis and executive taxis) and local buses which can all take you to many places in Salvador and the metropolitan area. Executive buses in the Iguatemi Station can be accessed from the Iguatemi Mall by way of a busy walkway. Bus travel in and out of Salvador can take a lot more time than expected.  Count on an average speed of 50-60 km/h when planning your itinerary.

===By boat===
Salvador is a common stop on international cruise routes and was once visited by the '''Queen Elizabeth 2''' during her sailing career. Note that the docks area can be dangerous. This area is linked to the Pelourinho historic centre by the ''Elevador Lacerda'', and to the city by urban buses and executive buses to '''Iguatemi'''.

==Get around==
===By foot===
There are a number of transportation options available in Salvador, including taxis, buses and car rentals. the bus fares are quite affordable, although the taxi fares can be quite expensive if one is traveling a long distance. [[Image:Salvador-elevator.jpg|thumb|The Lacerda Elevator]]
The old city center can be easily explored on foot. To get between the upper and lower sections, take the '''Elevador Lacerda''' or the cable car, remember to take small change as the fare is just R$0.15. The streets between the two are considered dangerous even during the day.

===By bus===

City buses, as in other Brazilian cities, are constant, confusing and dangerous. (over 100 busses per month assaulted in 2017). Fares are normally R$3.60, as of March 2017, (even for buses into the neighboring city of Lauro de Freitas). There is also the option of the air-conditioned executive buses. Know your landmarks and neighborhood names.
Way safer than busses is the Metro, though less possibilities to move around it proves a quick and efficient way to travel in Salvador. Soon there will be a direct link with the City-center and the International Airport.

The best way to plan your route is by using Google Maps

Any large ''shopping area'' will have a complimentary frequented bus stop, and the major intercity terminal, Lapa, is next to Shopping Lapa. 

Other major bus terminals include: Estação Iguatemi (between the Rodoviaria and Shopping Iguatemi), and Estação Mussurunga (located on the Paralela with buses usually connecting to Praia do Flamengo interior neighborhoods in Salvador).

If you are trying to make your way out of Pelourinho, you can either take the Elevador Lacerda down to the Comercio and find buses for just about every route, or walk to the Praca da Sé bus stop just south of the elevator, which has a much smaller selection of buses passing through, and many options of executive buses.

Buses are safe to ride at night, as long as you are on a frequented (i.e. coastal) route and dress/act inconspicuously. Service stops at midnight and begins again around 4:30-5AM. There are a limited number of lines that provide night service from midnight-4AM.

You can find more about about the Salvador bus routes and time tables one the website for the Superintendência de Transporte Público [http://www.transalvador.salvador.ba.gov.br/index.php] (in Portuguese only).

===By metro===

Salvador's [http://www.ccrmetrobahia.com.br metro system] opperates from ''Lapa'' (in city center) to ''Bom Juá''. ''Campo da Pólvora'' Station is 700 meters from Historic Center and ''Acesso Norte'' Station is near [http://wwww.belavistashopping.com.br Bela Vista Shopping Mall].

The Line 2 is linking the international airport with "acesso Norte". It is running since 05.2018

===By train===

[http://www.ctb.ba.gov.br Suburban rail service] links ''Calçada'' in Lower City and the suburban neighborhood ''Paripe''. 

===By taxi===

Salvador cab drivers must be competing with those in Rio for spots on Formula 1 racing teams. They will certainly get you where you're going quicker than the bus! However, as buses stop running after midnight, do be prepared to [[haggle]] quite a bit with taxistas who refuse to use the meter, especially if you've decided to explore far from your bed - as a general rule very few taxistas will use the meter, so haggling is common on most journies. Executive taxis (COMTAS white and blue) don't have meters, and the prices are on a table, it's more expensive than city taxis (white with red and blue stripes), but they are much more comfortable, they are in stops in the main shopping malls, the airport, bus station, ferry-boat station and big hotels.  Most of the executive taxis don't have a very good online presence and often English speaking staff are hard to come by.  
Your best option in Salvador is to use '''Uber''', friendly drivers (working hard for their Uber reputation) at half the price of traditional taxis (which are known for their lack of any ethics).

===By car===

Renting a basic car with air conditioning (100+ kilometers or KM free) costs R$ 110-140 per day, plus fuel. It's not hard to find your way accross Salvador avenues, but although people from Bahia have a reputation of being relaxed and easygoing, traffic is agressive (somewhat like [[Rio de Janeiro]]), and you will frequently see drivers attempting dangerous overtakes on you. Pedestrians are also careless and unexpectely run to cross roads and streets. If you are not used to this type of traffic, consider asking for a private driver, which is possible on many car renting agencies. Renting a car may be a good idea if you plan to visit the beaches from the northern part of Bahia, with more time flexibility than allowed by travel agencies.

===By bicycle===

The Bicycle sharing system program [http://www.bikesalvador.com/ Bike Salvador] offers many bike stations through the city. Cycling is not really a good option to get around in Salvador excpet the cycleways and pedestrian zones like in ''Barra'' and ''Ribeira'' areas. 

At sundays and holidays the [http://www.salvadorvaidebike.salvador.ba.gov.br Salvador Vai de Bike] project offers leisure cycleways like the one in downtown between ''Campo Grande'' Square and Historic Center and in the City Park (''Parque da Cidade'') area.

===Architecture===
[[Image:Salvador - Bahia - Brazil.jpg|thumb|Salvador]]
*At the center of the ''Cidade Alta'' there are the 2 large squares '''''Praça da Sé''''' and the '''Terreiro de Jesus''' which are connected at the corner by the cathedral. The latter is probably the most lively part of town, with food carts and stalls through the day and revelers in the evening hours. The slick, L-shaped Praça da Sé has cool fountains and the fenced-off ruins of the foundations of its namesake church. At the far end of the plaza, the 1874 funicular railway Plano Inclinado Gonçalves used to send 30-passenger cars between Cidade Alta and Cidade Baixa on terrifyingly steep tracks – it's been out of service since 2011, though plans to restore the train are in the works.  A colourful intersection of vendors, tourists, capoeiristas and colourful locals, the Terreiro de Jesus is a historic site of religious celebrations, and is ringed by four churches, as well as the  XIX century Faculdade de Medicina Building . The plaza feeds into the Cruzeiro de São Francisco , named for the cross in the square’s center.

*'''Largo do Pelourinho''' &mdash; A fairly small triangular plaza, is among the oldest parts of town. You can guess from its name meaning "plaza of the pillory" what went on around there.
*'''Mercado Modelo''' &mdash; The city's main market located in the lower town is and a good place for crafts and other souvenirs. In the adjacent square you can often see young men performing ''capoeira'', the famous martial arts dance which originates from the area.
*'''Solar do Unhão''' &mdash; The best place in Salvador to watch the sunset. It is an old style house located at the ''Baía de Todos os Santos''. Inside there is a small museum ('''Museu de Arte Moderna''') with local art pieces. Sometimes on Saturday evening there is a jazz concert.

The Jesuits installed the 1st manual rope-and-pulley elevator around 1610 to transport goods and passengers from the port to the settlement. In 1868 an iron structure with clanking steam elevators was inaugurated, replaced by an electric system in 1928.
Facing the elevator are the impressive arches of the Câmara Municipal, the XVII century city hall, which occasionally puts on cultural exhibitions.

The current church was built between 1708-1723, but the interior was decorated by several artists during a great part of the XVIII century. Most decoration of the church and convent were finished by 1755. All surfaces inside - walls, pillars, vaults and ceilings - are covered by golden sculptered gilt woodwork and paintings. The decoration of the church is considered one of the most complete and imposing in Portuguese-Brazilian [[Baroque]] gilt woodwork art (talha dourada), being a perfect example of the "golden church" (igreja dourada).</see>
*'''Igreja do Nosso Senhor do Bonfim''' &mdash; A small church located in a neighborhood to the north, is one of the most popular pilgrimage sites in all of Brazil. The colorful votive ribbons or ''fitas'' of Bonfim are an easily recognizable item throughout Brazil and even beyond. Children outside the church will (for a small fee) tie them around your wrist and tell you to make a wish for each one. If the ribbon wears off naturally, the wish will come true; if you cut it off before then, it won't. You can get to Bonfim by city bus in about 15 minutes.

It wasn’t seen until a workman installing wiring in the 1930s serendipitously discovered the beautiful, baroque sandstone facade (the only one of its kind in Brazil). The church was designed by Gabriel Ribeiro. The ceiling is decorated with paintings by Franco Velasco in 1831.</see>

For alternative crowd there is a free walking tour running in the city starting from Cinema Glauber Rocha on Castro Alves square 

If you don´t want to go by bus you can contact a guide for a private individual tour. The private guides all speak excellent English and provide a lot of insider knowledge.


===Carnival===
[[File:Salvador Carnival.jpg|thumb|350px|Salvador's Street Carnival, the biggest in the world]]
One of the main attractions in Salvador is the carnaval. Salvador's giant '''Carnival''', the biggest of the world, according to the Guiness book of records, lasts for one week and is extremely popular with Brazilians and tourists alike. In 2017, the event happens on February 22nd - March 1st and consists of parades,live entertainment, music, dancers and vendors. The main parades follow three circuits: one in the historic center Pelourinho (with mainly traditional groups in costumes), one on Campo Grande, where most bands play samba, and in recent years the most popular one in Barra / Ondina, where modern Brazilian Axé music mixes with percussion and all kinds of rhythms and styles, and the bands parade between "Camarote" boxes on one side and the beach on the other. Options to participate are either by watching from the camarote boxes, or purchasing an "abadá" shirt to join a group that accompanies one of the bands throughout the parade.
One can expect to have a lot of fun if they vacation in Salvador, Brazil during Carnival.

===Go to the beach===
Visiting a Salvador beach is a highlight for many tourists. One of the main central Salvador beaches is Porto de Barra. It was originally the site of the first settlement of european newcomers to Bahia. It can get very crowded on weekends. The northeast region of Salvador concentrates most beaches with good water quality. Flamengo and Stella Maris are the most popular beaches among tourists and upper class locals. They have excellent tourist infrastructure and rough waters excellent for surfing. Jaguaribe, Piatã and Itapoã, with calmer waters, are mostly frequented by locals and can become quite crowded at weekends. They are a good option with you want to mix with the local population, but don't bring anything besides your clothes, sunglasses, sunscreen, and some cash, as muggings are quite common.

The other beaches of Salvador aren't suited for bathing, but still can be good for walking, cycling, or taking pictures. Farol da Barra has a beautiful view (specially during the sunset), but it's difficult to walk due to the rocks. "Farol" means lighthouse, and this beach is known for its lighthouse as well as being popular with surfers. A much safer choice is nearby Plakaford. Here the calm waters and soft sandy beaches are welcoming for families and children. In the city south, there is an array of beautiful beaches that include Tinhare and Boipeba.

==Buy==
[[Image:Mercado Modelo - Salvador.jpg|thumb|250px|Mercado Modelo]]
Salvador shopping is the bargain hunters paradise. There is nothing that you cannot find in a mall. If you plan to buy popular art, crafts and clothing, check the small stores at the Old Town or head to the Mercado Modelo (Model Market). 
Locals like to shop at American-style shopping malls.

* '''Shopping da Bahia (formerly Shopping Iguatemi)''' 
* '''Salvador Shopping '''
* '''Shopping Barra'''
* '''Shopping Itaigara'''
* '''Shopping Center Lapa'''
* '''Shopping Piedade'''
* '''Bahia Outlet Center'''
* '''Salvador Norte Shopping'''
* '''Shopping Bela Vista'''

The first thing that anyone wanting to shop in Salvador should know is that it is essential to barter. very few vendors will stick to their given price. If pushed they will always go lower. If you are looking for souvenirs you may want to check out Litoral Norte located at Rua Gregorio de Matos 30. They sell tshirts and other items. Most will cost you no more than $5. 
If you want local art you should visit Pelourhino. There are many galleries that double as stores. Galeria 13 at Rua Santa Isabel 13 displays work by local artists.

==Eat==
Bahian restaurants are considered to be among the best in Brazil. The majority of Bahia restaurants offer South American cuisine but there a few that offer other specialties. For example, the Maria Mato Mouro located at Rua 3A Ordem de Sao Francisco, Pelourinho serves a wide range of seafood dishes from all over the world although most are from South America. One of the most popular dishes is the grilled bahia fish badejo. This restaurant is open daily from noon until 1am and offers main courses from $15 to $25. The Terreiro de Jesus is a great place to sample the local cuisine from street stalls, served by Afro-Brazilian ''baianas'' in their traditional white dresses. A must try dish is the Abara. This is a wrap with bean paste, dende oil and onions all cooked in a banana leaf with spices for flavour. if you prefer western food then you will find many fast-food places like Burger King, McDonald's, Subway or Pizza Hut. You also will find casual dinner chains like Outback Steakhouse.

Be sure to try '''acarajé''', small fritters made from black-eyed peas and onions fried in palm oil slathered with spicy '''vatapá''' (shrimp paste).These are sold by Baianas on the street. 

Here are a list of restuarants to try:

===Budget===
*'''Acarajé da Cira''', Largo de Itapuã, 3249-4170. Fresh acarajé daily from 10AM-11PM. There is also another location on the Largo da Mariquita in Rio Vermelho.

*'''Acarajé da Dica''', Rua J, Castro Rabelo, Pelourinho. Open T-Sa 3PM-11PM, Su 10AM-1AM.

* '''Health Valley Brasil''',  Rua Direita da Piedade (''in the city center''). Vegetarian restaurant run by Chinese (as is the case for more and more restaurants in Salvador now). Serving typical dishes based around ginger. Very popular with the local alternative crowd. Buffet including fruit juice and desert costs R$15.

*'''Quiosque de Amaralina''', Ave Otávio Mangabeira, Amaralina. Serving acarajé near the beach from 4PM to midnight.

===Mid-range===
* '''Bistrô PortoSol''', (''on a cross-street near Porto da Barra''). Small, cozy Austrian-Hungarian restaurant run by an Austrian and his wife. Simple accommodations decorated with posters of classic Hollywood movies. Quite delicious.

* '''Companhia da Pizza''', Rio Vermelho (''on a cross-street near the Pestana Bahia and Blue Tree Towers hotels''). One of the city's most popular pizza restaurants.

* '''La Figa''', Rua das Laranjeiras 17, Pelourinho (''near Terreiro de Jesus''). Italian restaurant with fresh pastas around R$35 for two people, appetizers around R$10, and deserts. The new owner changed the name in June 2007 (It was previously known as ''La Lupa''), but the high quality, good service and good atmosphere remain the same.

==Stay safe==

Salvador is notorious for street crime, and for a tourist who wanders carelessly in the streets, the likelihood of being mugged or an armed robbery is considerably higher than in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Salvador recognizes the importance of tourism to the city economy, so most important tourist sites such as Pelourinho and Mercado Modelo, as well as main popular festivals like the Carnival, are usually heavily guarded. 

If you are moving on foot, by bicycle, or by bus, it's best to go out during the day. Avoid bringing anything valuable, just enough to enjoy your day. The Flamengo and Stella Maris beaches are among the safest places to go during the day, and they are the best option if you just want to enjoy a good beach without much local culture. In other places, try to stay in areas guarded by police. 

As a general rule, be suspicious if people approach you directly in a friendly way as they may want money or to sell you something. 

At night, it's better to take a cab to go out. Stay at reasonably crowded places. If you don't see other tourists where you are, you should take extra caution.

* Some areas, which are heavily frequented by foreigners, can become dangerous, especially at night, i.e. the Barra harbour area. Avoid going to the beach at night!

* The long sloping road leading from the old town to the harbor should be avoided even during the day. '''ALWAYS''' take the elevator.

* If you are staying in the touristic Barra area, beware of the favela near Shopping Barra, especially at night. The area just to the east toward the beach can be dangerous as well.

* Beware of vehicular traffic. Crossing the streets is always dangerous even when using a pedestrian crosswalk with the traffic light red for cars. As one member of Supergrass band once said: "In Brazil green means go, and red means go faster!" Start the crossing ''ONLY'' when vehicles have already stopped.

* Never agree to share a taxi with other random people, especially if they approach you. Most likely it's just a trap to rob you!

* Watch out for children in Pelourinho, especially on Tuesdays at the Geronimo Concert at the old church - they are reaching out for any low pockets in cargo pants!

When shopping always check the price first. Ask for a Coupon Fiscal it ensures that the company or individual you are purchasing from pays the proper tax.
Be particularly aware of Banca and Kiosks on the street as they may charge you more for being an estrangeiro (foreigner).

==Stay healthy==

As elsewhere in Brazil, some beaches in Salvador are not suitable for bathing, and conditions can change frequently. On the day of your visit, check the latest weekly [http://www.inema.ba.gov.br/servicos/monitoramento/qualidade-das-praias/ bathing bulletin] (in Portuguese, ''boletim de balneabilidade'') of the state's Environment Department (INEMA).

==Get out==
For a nice day trip, catch the ferry to the laid-back island of [[Itaparica]].
Salvador is also the gateway to many other nearby attractions such as:
*[[Praia do Forte]]. Beach town with the "Project Tamar" turtle sanctuary.
*[[Arembepe]]. Tiny beach town along the Costa dos Coqueiros ([[Coconut Coast]]) with quiet beaches perfect for surfing.
*[[Imbassai]]. Just a few kilometers further North from Praia do Forte, this relaxed village's beach lies between the sea and a river that runs parallel to the ocean for a few hundred meters. Unique panorama.  
*[[Boipeba]]. A beautiful and very pleasant island.
*[[Morro de Sao Paulo]]. Very frequented island by tourists and locals, plenty of restaurants, hostels and bars. It has four beaches with translucent water.
*[[Massarandupió]]. Just 90 km from Salvador, it's a true paradise, a semi-desert beach, with a small river. Walking by the beach you can reach a nudist beach area. A few small pousadas and restaurants. Great camping on a grassy flat area behind the dunes.
