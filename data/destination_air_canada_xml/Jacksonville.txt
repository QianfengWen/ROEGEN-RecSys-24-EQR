'''Jacksonville'''[http://www.jaxcvb.com] is situated on the Atlantic coast of northeast Florida.  It is the most populous city in the state of Florida measured by the number of residents. But Jacksonville covers an enormous area, and is in fact the largest city in area in the continental United States. The city has a large area, but also has a low density rate. The metropolitan area extends beyond Duval County into Nassau, St. Johns, Baker and Clay counties and has a population of more than 1.25 million people. The city's metropolitan population is not the largest in Florida, it is exceeded by the Miami-Fort Lauderdale area, Tampa, and Orlando metro areas.

==Understand==
Jacksonville is widely known as a hard-working, blue-collar city.  While a substantial portion of Jacksonville's economy is supported by both of its large U.S. Navy bases (Naval Air Station Jacksonville and Naval Station Mayport), it is also a hotbed for the banking, logistics, insurance, and healthcare sectors. The downtown skyline, notable for its bridges of various styles and colors, spans along the St. Johns River with a pedestrian river walk located on each bank. Although the bulk of Jacksonville's population is suburban in nature and spread throughout Duval County, renewed development efforts are currently underway in the urban core along with preservation efforts in its historic districts.
Jacksonville is nicknamed JAX, or 'The Bold City'

===By plane===

*'''Jacksonville International Airport''' ({{IATA|JAX}}) [http://www.jia.aero]. Jacksonville International Airport is the First Coast's commercial airport, with scheduled service offered by American Airlines, Air Canada, Allegiant Air, Delta Airlines, Frontier Airlines, jetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines, and United Airlines. The airport is located approximately 15 miles north of downtown.

*You can fly into Jacksonville International Airport direct from 24 cities: [[Atlanta]], [[Baltimore]], [[Boston]], [[Charlotte]], [[Chicago]], [[Cincinnati]], [[Dallas]]/[[Fort Worth]], [[Detroit]], [[Fort Lauderdale]], [[Houston]], [[Las Vegas]], [[Memphis]], [[Miami]], [[Minneapolis]], [[Nashville]], [[New York City]], [[Newark]], [[Norfolk]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Richmond]], [[Tampa]], [[Toronto]], and [[Washington]].

The airport has one terminal building, with ticketing on the upper "Departures" level and baggage claim and ground transportation on the lower "Arrivals" level.  There are two areas for ground transportation, at the center front for taxis and area hotel shuttles, and at the north end (outside of Baggage Carousel 1) for Pre-Arranged Ground Transportation, including limousines, intercity buses/shuttles, and local JTA city buses.  Airline gates radiate from three concourses, A, B, and C which all funnel through one central security screening area. Generally arriving one hour before a flight's scheduled departure is plenty of time, but during major holidays, such as Thanksgiving, allow one and a half to two hours.

'''Public transit''' from JAX to Downtown Jacksonville is provided by JTA Route CT-3[http://www.jtafla.com//Schedules/showPage.aspx?Sel=155], every hour, picking up at Pre-Arranged Ground Transportation (north end of the terminal outside Baggage Carousel 1, lower level). $1.

==Get around==

Unless you want to spend a lot of time waiting for buses, a car is a must to fully experience Jacksonville; due to Jacksonville's size and low density, most destinations are not within walking distance of each other.  Mass transit is limited to the city bus system, and an elevated rail system in the downtown district that links both banks of the river with a crossing on the Acosta Bridge.  The bus system is minimally adequate; no bus runs past midnight, and many bus routes stop running at around 8 or 9PM.  All buses are linked via GPS to a central control system and stops are well-marked throughout the entire city.  
===Bus===
*'''Jacksonville Transportation Authority''', Phone: (904) 630-3100, [http://www.jtafla.com]. The bus system is fairly extensive in scope, but you must plan ahead as the frequency of stops is between 30 minutes to an hour.  Buses are air-conditioned and reasonably comfortable, but JTA buses struggle with on-time performance.
===Taxi===
Taxi services are available, but expensive due to the sprawl of the city.
===Car===
*Car rentals are the most convenient for of transportation for visitors, with local companies offering better prices but national chains offering more convenience vis-a-vis return policies and times.

The new downtown Main Library opened in 2005 and is the largest Main Library in the state of Florida.  The postmodern structure was designed by noted architect Robert A.M. Stern and features a Grand Reading Room and a quiet Courtyard for outdoor reading.  [http://jpl.coj.net/u_eng_ifiles/hours.html#main]

* '''[[Amelia Island]]''' - A beautiful island about an hour north of Jacksonville along FL-A1A, it is home to upscale houses, and the Amelia Island Plantation.  In the 17th and 18th centuries, Amelia Island was used as a pirate base for raids on Spanish shipping. Known as the Isle of Eight Flags, it is the only location in the United States to have been under the allegiance of eight different nations.

* '''[[St. Augustine]]''' - Founded by Spanish colonists in 1565, St. Augustine lays claim to being the oldest permanent settlement in the United States.  It is about a 45 minute drive south of Jacksonville by I-95, or about an hour taking the more scenic route down FL-A1A.  It boasts many fine restaurants and tourist attractions, as well as a unique blend of old world architectural styles inherited from its Spanish and British masters.  The fort, the old city, the Flagler Museum, St. George's Street, the St. Augustine Lighthouse, and the Bridge of Lions are all recommended.

* '''Olustee Battlefield''' [http://www.floridastateparks.org/olustee/default.cfm] - About an hour's drive west along I-10 in [[Olustee]] is the Olustee Battlefield, site of the only Civil War engagement in Florida.  The battle is reenacted each February, and is a popular site for Civil War buffs.
