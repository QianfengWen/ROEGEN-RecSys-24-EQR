'''Aarhus''', (pronounced: Oar-Hoos, previously Århus) is the main city on the [[Jutland]] peninsula in [[Denmark]]. With a population of just over 300,000 people (1,200,000 East Jutland metropolitan area) it also holds the title of Denmark's second largest city.

==Understand==
[[Image:AarhusCityHall.jpg|thumb|City Hall]]
Aarhus offers an elegant mix of cosmopolitan city and quaint small town charm, with wonderful pubs, restaurants and romantic places.  The average age of its inhabitants is among the lowest in Europe. This is mainly because of the large student population.

Some interesting facts:
* There are many plans for highrise buildings in Aarhus, including the future tallest building in Denmark (Lighthouse -142 meters [466 feet]). 
* Aarhus is part of the East Jutland Metropolitan area, which has the fastest growing population in Denmark, by far.
* Aarhus has a big, well known cultural festival week, called "Aarhus Festuge" (Aarhus Festival Week) [http://www.aarhusfestuge.dk/aarhusfestuge/festuge.nsf/links/English].
* Aarhus has for many years been known as a breeding ground for Danish musicians and bands, primarily in main stream pop and rock music.
* Aarhus is known as ''The City of Smiles'' (da. ''Smilets By''). It probably just started as a slogan to improve the city's image, but it has nevertheless caught on, and has for many years been a common nickname for the city.
* Aarhus is also known as ''The City of Cafés'' - visit the city and you will soon know why.

* '''Tourist Information Office''' (across from the railway station) pick up the leaflet "Aarhus - five historical walks". The walks are all really short and you could do them all easily in a day as they are all in the city center.

==Talk==
The Danes are reserved towards strangers, but friendly towards tourists, and will normally be happy to give you directions and advice in fluent English.

==Get in==

===By train===

Trains run 1-2 times an hour from Copenhagen (København) to Aarhus and takes about three hours. Standard adult fare is DKK 419 (2021), an addition DKK 30 to reserve a seat. Discounts are available for persons 25 years old or younger or older than 65 years. Discounted tickets - ''Orange Tickets'' - are available on all deaprtures, but may sell out. If possible buy them some weeks in advance, but quite often you can get a discount if buying this restricted ticket also on the same day as the travel. ''Orange Tickets'' are not for sale at the counter, only online - and you can show them on your smartphone. Details on '''DSB''''s homepage [http://www.dsb.dk/].

It is also possible to catch a train to any other part of the Jutland peninsula.

You can easily plan a travel by train and bus using the '''www.journeyplanner.dk''' [https://journeyplanner.dk/] - just key in the address of departure and destination. It will show you both standard tickets, but will also check for discounted tickets, and even offer you split-tickets is this is an option. It provides link to where you can buy the tickets online.   

Trains from [[Hamburg]] arrive several times a day, but they are expensive (around 75 € one way). Nevertheless, if you book about two months before travelling, you can buy one of the few tickets for 29/39€ (called "Europa-Sparpreis"). You can also get a discount closer than two months to departure - but as always in Europe on cross-border trains you have to search for them on the national carrier of both countries, e.g. Germany and Denmark in order to get the best price for a given departure.  For more information check out the website of the German national railway company '''DB''': [http://www.bahn.de]

Tickets used in trains are also usable in buses, and if you are travelling from Copenhagen, you can use your ticket for the rest of the day to get around Aarhus at no extra expense. This only works for national Danish standard ticket, not discounted tickets or tickets issued by Deutsche Bahn.

===By bus===
Two private operated busses run between Copenhagen and Aarhus.

'''Flixbus''' [http://www.flixbus.dk/] operates busses who follow the same route as the train. Journey time is 3 hours and 50 minutes.

'''Kombardo Expressen''' [http://www.kombardoexpressen.dk/] operates busses who will use the ferries between Aarhus and Zealand. You get a busticket and a crossing on a ferry for the same price. Journey time is 3 hours and 25 minutes. They also operated some busses who take the same route (over the bridge at The Greater Belt) as Flixbus.
Note, tickets are not sold onboard - you need to buy them online in advance e.g. on your smartphone.

===By boat===
'''Mols Linien''' [http://www.mols-linien.dk/] operates ferries to [[Odden]]

===By plane===
'''Aarhus Airport, Tirstrup''' [http://www.aar.dk/default.asp?id=87] is approx. 45 minutes bus-ride away. Airport buses [http://www.aar.dk/default.asp?id=83] arrive and leave from Banegårdspladsen in front of the railway station, a one-way ticket costs 115 DKK. Tickets are sold on the bus. Accepted currencies are; Danish Crowns, US Dollars, Pounds and Euro. Major Credit Cards are also accepted. 

Aarhus airport is serviced mostly by SAS with flights from Copenhagen; flights from London are serviced also by the low-cost flight provider Ryanair, which has been known to provide fares as low as 1p per(one-way)trip. 

'''Billund Airport''' [http://www.billund-airport.com/], with many flight connections, is approx. 90 minutes bus-ride away. Airport buses arrive and leave from Aarhus bus station and railway station, a one-way ticket costs 155 DKK. Tickets are sold on the bus. Accepted currencies are; Danish Crowns and Euro. Credit Cards are accepted. Alternatively, since direct buses to Aarhus are infrequent and sometimes slow, it is possible to get a bus to Vejle and a train from there to Aarhus.

==Get around==
The entire city is clean and well organized, making '''walking''' an excellent and enjoyable way to get around. 

'''Rent a bike''' at Cycling Aarhus (They also provide guided bike tours)  [http://www.cycling-aarhus.dk/] or in Bikes4Rent [http://www.bikes4rent.dk/] or better yet, '''borrow a free City Bike''', available around in the city. You need to insert a DKK 20 coin, which you get back when leaving the bike in another "bike station" (not available during winter months). The free City Bikes has been discontinued from winter 2019 - now only option is private operator '''Donkey Republic''' [https://www.donkey.bike/da/] who offer orange city bikes for rental via an app.

'''Bus tickets''' for travel within the city limits (Aarhus Kommune limits) are 22 DKK, 11 DKK (2021) if you are under 16 years of age [http://www.midttrafik.dk/priser+og+billetter/priser/Aarhus+kommune]. Tickets are also available in 10-trip tickets, that vary in price depending on how far you want to go (180 DKK - 360 DKK), cheaper cards are also available for under 16 year olds). A special Tourist Ticket is available for 24, 48 or 72 hours - more information on '''Midttrafik''' [https://www.midttrafik.dk/english/tickets/tourist-ticket-aarhus-24-48-or-72-hours/]. Finally there are tickets that allow you to ride all you want for 30 days, again prices vary depending on how far you want to go.

You can also buy a cheap '''Aarhus Pass''' [http://www.visitaarhus.com/international/en-gb/menu/turist/om-aarhus/sightseeing/aarhuspas/produktside.htm?id=16515&] which covers all bus transport and all the museums.

Aarhus Universitet), with around 35.000 students, also including the '''Aarhus School of Business''' [http://www.asb.dk/]. This means that the city is crowded with students.

* Learn Danish in the Universitys Danish Courses [http://www.au.dk/en/is/learndanish] or in the LærDansk [http://www.laerdansk.dk/en/].

==Work==

==Buy==

[[Image:AArhusStroget.jpg|thumb|Strøget]]
* There is a pedestrian shopping street (Strøget), highlighted by upscale Scandinavian clothing shops and Salling and Magasin department stores.

* '''Bruun's Galleri''' [http://www.bruunsgalleri.dk/] Located next to the railway station. The biggest city mall in Denmark with 95 shops and a cinema. (there are plans of expanding Bruun's Galleri over the traintracks running next to it).

* '''Storcenter Nord''' [http://www.storcenternord.dk/] Located in the nothern part of the central city. Another mall with around 55 shops.

* '''City Vest''' [http://www.cityvest.dk/] Located in the western part of the city. A mall with around 65 shops.

* '''Bazar Vest''' [http://www.bazarvest.dk/] Located in the western part of the city.. 10 minutes walk from City Vest. Mostly foreign nationalities have small shops where you can buy all kinds of exotic items and food. (closed on mondays)

As a tourist, you may be looking for Aarhus Souvenirs, but they can be hard to find. The department stores do not have specific souvenir sections, and there is no real city tourist office with souvenirs (there is some information at DOKK1, but no shop where you can buy souvenirs to bring home). The main attractions tend to have attraction specific souvenirs, but to find Aarhus Souvenirs, your best bet is to go to a bookshop, ""Svend A. Larsen"" [http://www.sval.dk]] at Sønder Allé 4 close to the town hall. Online you can also go to ""Urban Code"" [http://urbancode.dk], who specializes in Aarhus Souvenirs. 

* '''"The Latin Quarter"'''  - so called by the locals - is the shopping district north of ''Store Torv'' between ''Guldsmedgade'' and ''Mejlgade''. Here you will find the small 'independent' shops and some of the city's oldest cafés. If you're in the city in the beginning of May, your trip may coincide with ''Mejlgade for Mangfoldighed'', a 1-day street party in Mejlgade.

==Eat==

There are hundreds of restaurants in Aarhus, reaching from cheap kebab joints, to high-class dining. Aarhus is generally known as one of the best places to eat in Denmark, probably due to the strong competition. However, the best places are not necessarily located on the most prominent addresses, so a bit of browsing is recommended. You could also try '''Åen''' - walk down "the river" in the city center, there are lots of restaurants and cafes with high standard.

The locals regularly frequent the many cafés when going out for a meal. Besides being the best option for breakfast, brunch and lunch, most cafés serve excellent home made burgers, salads, sandwiches, soups and snacks at reasonable prices. By the main bus station, there is also an extensive indoor street food market with lots of tasty world food options.

Aarhus's large student population fuels a lively nightlife. There is a robust nightlife for those who are looking for a night on the town. Aarhus can deliver everything from big mainstream clubs to small alternative hangouts playing niche music. 

Prices for food and drink are higher than in other parts of Europe, especially near the river (Å in Danish). The favorite local beers are Tuborg, Carlsberg and Ceres (which is no longer brewed locally).

==Get out==
* Aarhus is surrounded by beautiful beech forests; take a walk in Marselisborgskoven or in the deer park. 

* As a coastal city, there are many beaches to walk - just remember warm clothes October through early April. There are history trails from Moesgaard Museum right down to the water, with reconstructed stone age, iron age and viking houses and tombs, rune stones etc.

* The local soccer team AGF, plays their home games at '''Ceres Park''' [http://www.atletion.com/], which can hold around 21.000 in attendance. If you're a soccer fan, don't miss a home game (Played on Saturdays or Sundays) as the atmosphere is amazing during game night!

* '''Djurs Sommerland''' [http://djurssommerland.dk/], amusement park has Denmark's largest rollercoaster. Can be reached with buses 121, 122 and 123 in 1h15m. Discount if buying your entrance ticket in the bus (you only pay DKK 20,- extra for the bustrip there and back).

* '''[[Ebeltoft]]''' is a quaint little town about an hour bus ride away. You can catch bus 123 with a day ticket costing DKK 125 (note that you can use this to also get out to the airport if arriving/leaving the same day). It has one main cobblestone street lined with shops and cafes and you can visit the glass museum (it has a mirror room that you can walk in!) or the world's longest wooden ship. The actual bus ride there takes you through some lovely green hilly countryside too. Just make sure you get off at the station called Ebeltoft C rather than waiting till the end of the line which is the Ebeltoft bus station... unless you enjoy a bit of a walk which one could say is a nice way to view the residential streets one wouldn't normally have done!
