'''Cork''' (Irish: ''Corcaigh'') is situated on the banks of the River Lee in the south of the country. With a city population of 210,000 in 2019 (399,216 including metropolitian area)[http://www.cso.ie/census/documents/census2006_Volume%201%20-%20Table%205.pdf] it is the second largest city in the [[Ireland|Republic of Ireland]], and the third largest on the island of Ireland once Belfast in the North is included.

===Orientation===
Cork is the anglicised version of the Irish word '''Corcaigh''', which means ''marsh''. The city centre was originally built on marshland and boats were able to navigate into the channels which separated the many islands. Many of the wider streets, such as St Patrick's Street, the South Mall and the Grand Parade, are actually built on former river channels. St Patrick's Street is Cork's commercial hub, and is known colloquially as either "Patrick Street" or "Pana".

The centre of the city forms an arrow-shaped island between the North and South channels of the '''River Lee'''. There are upwards of thirty bridges over the two channels. This, combined with the one-way traffic system, can make the centre a little bit confusing for first-time visitors. The River Lee flows from West to East, and outside of the centre, hills rise steeply to the Northside, while the Southside is that bit flatter but still hilly in parts. St. Anne's Church watches over '''Shandon''', just to the North of the river. The '''University''' is about 2km to the west of the centre.

The '''Train Station''' is about 1km to the east of the centre. '''Shops''' are generally concentrated around St. Patrick's Street, Oliver Plunkett Street, Paul Street and North Main Street. '''Bars''' and '''Restaurants''' can be found everywhere, but especially around MacCurtain Street, Washington Street and Oliver Plunkett Street. '''Financial''' businesses are centred on the area around the South Mall and the '''Administrative''' heart of the city is on Anglesea Street.

===History===
The patron Saint of Cork, '''Saint Finbar''' (c.550-c.620) founded a monastery on the south bank of the River Lee approximately 1,400 years ago. A settlement grew up around this monastery and was added to (and ransacked by) '''Viking''' invaders during the ninth and tenth centuries. The town grew and the English Norman King Henry II, who had been requested by Pope Adrian IV (the only English Pope) to collect papal dues not paid, gave Cork ''city status'' in '''1185'''. 

Cork slowly grew during the late middle ages, developing into a crowded, walled city, centered around North and South Main Streets. The city enjoyed a ''golden age'' of sorts during the seventeenth century providing '''butter''' to ships which plied the North Atlantic. During this period the city expanded and many Italianate residences were built on the hills to the North in Sunday's Well and Montenotte.
 
After a sluggish start following independence, the city grew substantially during the latter half of the twentieth century. Currently, as a result of the '''Celtic Tiger''' phenomenon, development is having a profound effect on all aspects of the city, including its appearance, mostly for the better. From a small merchant town, Cork has grown into a cosmopolitan and vibrant city that, within the Republic of Ireland, is second only to Dublin in size and importance.  

'''Statio Bene Fide Carinis'''' – "A safe Harbour for ships" is the motto of the city that is found on the coat of arms.

In recent years Cork has developed a slightly separatist mentality [http://www.peoplesrepublicofcork.com/] when compared to other parts of Ireland. This is most evident in colloquial speech (Cork Slang) [http://www.corkslang.com/] and references to Ireland's capital, Dublin. This is, however, mostly tongue-in-cheek humour.

==Get in==
===By boat===
Car ferry services depart from Ringaskiddy (15km SE of the city) to [[Roscoff]]. Ferries sail to/from Ringaskiddy through Cork Harbour (the second largest natural harbour in the world; Sydney harbour being the largest) and past [[Cobh]] - the last port of call for the Titanic.
From April to October there is a weekly ferry service to Roscoff in [[France]] with Brittany Ferries [http://www.brittanyferries.ie].  The Cork-Swansea ferry service was suspended in 2007 for lack of a suitable vessel.  The Cork-Swansea ferry service was reinstated in March, 2010 by a new operator: Fastnet Line [http://www.fastnetline.com/] and closed again in 2012 [http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/corkswansea-ferry-service-closes-with-the-loss-of-78-jobs-3008840.html].

===By plane===
[[Image:2565300987 7b25588007 b.jpg|thumb|Aer Lingus]] 
Cork Airport [http://www.corkairport.com] ({{IATA|ORK}}) is the country's second busiest airport after Dublin Airport, and 4th busiest on the island of Ireland. The airport is located 8km south of the city centre, connected by the N27 Kinsale Road. The destinations focus on Britain and the rest of Europe. There are currently no flights available to/from Dublin.

Among the main scheduled passenger operators out of Cork Airport [http://www.corkairport.com/flight_info/airlines.html] Aer Lingus [http://www.aerlingus.com], Jet2 [http://www.jet2.com], Ryanair [http://www.ryanair.com], and Wizz Air [http://wizzair.com]. 
Destinations include [http://www.corkairport.com/flight_info/index.html]:

* [[Alicante]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Barcelona]], [[Birmingham_(England)|Birmingham]], [[Bristol]], [[Cardiff]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Geneva]], [[Glasgow]] (International), [[Krakow]], [[La Rochelle]], [[Liverpool]], [[London]] (Gatwick, Heathrow & Stansted), [[Malaga]], [[Manchester]], [[Munich]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[Nice]], [[Paris]], [[Rennes]], [[Rome]], [[Vilnius]], [[Warsaw]] and [[Wroclaw]].

Bus Éireann [http://www.buseireann.ie/] route 226 [http://www.buseireann.ie/pdf/1221566303-226.pdf] links the airport with the city centre. Route 249 [http://www.buseireann.ie/pdf/1213892284-249.pdf] stops at the airport on its route between Cork and [[Kinsale]]. 

Shannon Airport [http://www.shannonairport.com] ({{IATA|SNN}}) may be useful for some travellers. There are direct flights to Shannon from the [[United States of America|United States]] and a smaller selection of European cities. Shannon is connected to Cork in 2 hours 25 minutes by Bus Éireann [http://www.buseireann.ie] and CityLink [http://www.citylink.ie] bus services.

===By train===
[[Image:2854605330 49f89db199 b.jpg|thumb|Kent Station, Cork]] 
The train service in Ireland is operated by Irish Rail [http://www.irishrail.ie] (Irish: ''Iarnród Éireann'') which provides rail services from Cork to Dublin (16 trains per day), Cobh (22), Midleton (20), Tralee (3 direct, 6 with one change) and Mallow. All other towns and cities are accessible through connecting trains.

Cork's main station is Kent Station, located on the Lower Glanmire Road, a 10-minute walk east of St Patrick's Street.

Trains in Ireland can be expensive by comparison with other modes of transport. For example, a single (one-way) adult ticket from Dublin to Cork can cost as low as €10 if booked online, but be aware that adult single tickets bought at the station cost €60 [http://www.irishrail.ie/your_ticket/fares_enquiries.asp], almost the same price as a return journey which costs €77 if purchased at the station. In 2012, an initiative was launched which guarantees one-way tickets for €19.99 if booked online at least three days in advance. By booking online on the Dublin train you will be automatically allocated a reserved seat; you can also select which seat you would like manually. The train journey from Dublin Heuston to Cork takes, 2hrs 50mins. 

The Irish Rail network is undergoing a significant upgrading in terms of both infrastructure and rolling stock.

Four routes operate from Kent Station, Cork:

1. Intercity route to [[Dublin | Dublin Heuston]], serving: Mallow, Charleville, Limerick Junction, Thurles, Templemore, Ballybrophy, Portlaoise, Portarlington, Kildare, Dublin Heuston. A train will, on average, only stop at 3-4 of these stations between Cork and Dublin.

2. Intercity route to [[Tralee]], serving: Mallow, Banteer, Millstreet, Rathmore, [[Killarney]], Farranfore, Tralee

3. Commuter route to [[Cobh]] and Midleton, serving: Little Island, Glounthaune, Fota, Carrigaloe, Rushbrooke, Cobh; with a recently opened spur line serving Carrigtwohill and Midleton.

4. Commuter route to [[Mallow]], serving: Mallow.

===By bus===
The main nationwide bus carrier in Ireland is Bus Éireann [http://www.buseireann.ie] who runs a stopping service from Dublin to Cork every two hours, on even hours from 8:00am until 6:00pm. Similar express direct bus services exist to [[Waterford]], [[Killarney]], and [[Limerick]], Shannon Airport and [[Galway]], all of which are hourly.

GoBus [http://www.gobus.ie] run direct non-stop services to and from [[Dublin]] City Centre and Dublin Airport, the journey takes around 3 hours by Motorway and can be much cheaper than traveling by train. 

Aircoach [http://www.aircoach.ie] also run services to and from [[Dublin]] city centre every hour from 5:00am until 7:00pm, and every two hours from 1:00am to 3:00am. A passenger can then catch a connecting bus to go on to Dublin Airport.

City Link [http://www.citylink.ie] operate services on the [[Limerick]]-Shannon Airport-[[Galway]] route.

Many private bus companies also operate bus tours around Ireland from Cork. [http://www.jjkavanagh.ie Kavanaghs] has a bus service to Limerick and Waterford and [https://www.discoveringireland.com/ Discovering Ireland] also offers tours around Ireland.

===By car===
The main inter-city road network in Ireland has received a lot of investment in recent years. The M7 and M8 which connect Cork to Dublin is now entirely motorway with 2 lanes in each direction. Approximate journey time is 2 hours 30 minutes in good conditions.

The N20 to Limerick is mostly single carriageway with one lane in each direction; there are short sections of dual-carriageway (2 lanes in each direction) around Cork and Limerick. Approximate journey time is 1 hour 45 minutes.

The main arteries into Cork are mostly wide and in good condition, but the city centre streets and parts of the suburbs can be very narrow and steep; drivers who are unfamiliar with this style of close-knit street layout may find these conditions extremely challenging.

===Car rental===
Car rental services in Cork mainly operate out of Cork Airport, however Europcar and Hertz both have locations in Cork City Centre. The close proximity of the airport to the city means that this is not as inconvenient as it might appear, particularly when the excellent bus and taxi services are included.

==Get around==

[[Image:Cork1.jpg|thumb|Cork City's main thoroughfare, St. Patrick's Street]]

===Walk===
Cork has a small city centre and is entirely walkable. A visitor will most likely be staying, eating, drinking and touring in the city centre and will unlikely need to use public transport. 

===Cycle===
Despite Cork's hills there is an active cycling community in Cork as well as good infrastructure (can be patchy in places). Bicycle parking stands can be found across the city centre.

There is a bike share scheme run by Transport for Ireland (TFI). Visitors can opt for an annual pass or 3-day pass. Full details on [https://www.bikeshare.ie/cork.html].

===Bus===
There are bus services to the residential suburbs. Most buses leave from St. Patrick's Street or nearby streets such as South Mall, Grand Parade and Merchant's Quay. A guided bus tour departs from the junction of Grand Parade and South Mall at regular intervals and provides an interesting tour of the main highlights of Cork for those who do not have a lot of time on their hands.

===Taxi===
There are numerous Taxi ranks located throughout cork city, fares are calculated on a meter and all taxis are the same price. Fares are also negotiable for longer out of town trips. Most drivers also offer fixed priced guided tours. (See taxi regulator: [http://www.taxiregulator.ie])

Taxis appear as normal cars except with a circular green and blue 'TAXI' sticker on each front door and a yellow bar above it with their license number and 'TAXI' or the Irish equivalent 'TACSAÍ' written on it. If the light is on, the taxi is available for hire, but some taxi drivers forget to turn on and off their light, so check to see if anyone's in the cab.

===Carpool===
For travelling a little further outside the city, Cork has a good carpooling community. The Carma[http://www.carmacarpooling.com/Ireland/Cork/] app lists significant number of drivers around the city. In particular there a lot of commuters travelling between '''[[Kinsale]]''' and Cork morning and evening using Carma.

==Stay safe==

Cork is a safer city than Dublin.  During the night caution should be taken, as in any situation involving large numbers of people and alcohol. However, as in any city the vast majority of people are out simply to enjoy themselves. 

Sensible and vigilant behaviour when out late at night should mean that any trouble is avoided. If your safety feels compromised, approach any of the many police or doormen in the city centre, who will be happy to provide assistance. There is virtually no guncrime in Cork, even the general police don't carry guns, so there is no need to worry about firearm violence.
