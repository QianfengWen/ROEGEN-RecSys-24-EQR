{{pagebanner|Spokane Banner.jpg}}

'''Spokane''' [http://www.visitspokane.com/] is a city in eastern [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. It is the second largest city in Washington State in the [[Pacific Northwest]] region and the largest in the Inland Northwest and Eastern Washington.

The city and its history is defined by the Spokane River, which flows directly through the city, cascading over a series of waterfalls in the heart of downtown. For thousands of years before the arrival of European fur-traders and explorers in the area in the early 1800s, the river had been a gathering place and an abundant source of salmon for the Spokane and other tribal peoples. As the city developed and homesteaders settled the area, the Spokane River became polluted, cover by bridges and railroad yards. In 1974, the river and much of downtown was reclaimed during Expo 74, the world's first environmentally-themed World's Fair. 

Shaped by its geography, Spokane's urban area is highly varied, due in large part to its location in a valley at the junction of the semi-arid scablands of the Columbia Plateau to the west, the rolling and fertile farmland of the Palouse to the south, and the Selkirk and Rocky Mountains to the north and east.

== Understand ==
===Pronunciation===
The city is pronounced as "spo-CAN," but often mispronounced as "spo-CANE."

===Basics===

Spokane is the economic hub of an area that serves roughly 1.5 million people. The largest city between Seattle and Minneapolis, its immediate metropolitan area, which includes neighboring Kootenai County, Idaho, is home to roughly 680,000 people. The city itself is home to just over 200,000. Politically, Spokane is as conservative as most cities its size across the west with Spokane and surrounding counties skewing Republican. Despite immigration from other areas of the country and world, Spokane has a fairly small racial minority population of around 15%.

Spokane is the county seat of Spokane County.[http://www.spokanecounty.org/]

==Get in==

=== By plane ===

'''Spokane International Airport''' ({{IATA|GEG}}) for Geiger Field [http://www.spokaneairports.net] is located 8 mi (12.8 km) west of downtown off of I-90 from Exit #277B (along US Hwy 2) towards Airway Heights. While the airport offers no international scheduled flights, despite its name, it retains a U.S. Customs and Border Protection office for charter and general aviation flights. Fortunately, Seattle/Tacoma International Airport offers flights to most major international destinations and is only a short 45-minute flight from Spokane. As a result, the inland Northwest is easily accessible worldwide with just one plane change. Most major airlines serving Spokane are: 

* '''Alaska Airlines/Horizon''' (Concourse C, Gates C21-26 & C30-32)[http://www.alaskaair.com/]: ([[Portland#By plane|Portland]], [[Seattle#By plane|Seattle-Tacoma]], [[Boise#By plane|Boise]], [[Anchorage#By plane|Anchorage]])
* '''Delta/Delta Connection''' (Concourse B, Gates B4 - B8 even numbered) [http://www.delta.com]:  (Minneapolis/St Paul, Salt Lake City, Seattle, Los Angeles, Atlanta)
* '''Southwest''' (Concourse A, Gates A11-13)[http://www.southwest.com] (Boise, Denver, Las Vegas, Oakland, Phoenix, Chicago-Midway)
* '''United Airlines/United Express''' (Concourse B) [http://www.united.com]:  (Denver, Chicago-O'Hare) 
* '''American''' (Concourse C) [http://www.usairways.com]:  (Phoenix)

To travel from the airport to downtown:
* A taxi from the airport will cost around $25+ 15% tip. 
* The '''STA #60''' bus [https://www.spokanetransit.com/routes-schedules/route/60-airport-brownes-addition], costs $1.50 one way (or $3.50 for day pass if requiring to transfer buses) and takes 25 minutes to travel from the airport to downtown (at the 'Plaza' @ W Sprague & Wall St). The stops are outside the police office & conference center at Concourse C and the arrivals concourse past Concourse A at the opposite end of the main terminal building .

=== By train ===

Spokane is located on '''Amtrak's''' [http://www.amtrak.com/empire-builder-train] [[Empire Builder]] route, which operates between Seattle/Portland and Chicago. Spokane is located at the point where westbound trains are split in half, one half going to Seattle through the Cascades and the other half to Portland OR-Vancouver WA along the Columbia River Gorge, and where eastbound trains from those cities are joined together to continue eastward. The Empire Builder connects with Amtrak's '''[http://www.amtrak.com/coast-starlight-train  Coast Starlight]''' & '''[http://www.amtrakcascades.com  Cascades]''' in [[Seattle#By train|Seattle]] and [[Portland#By train|Portland]] and additional trains in [http://www.amtrak.com/midwest-train-routes  Chicago]. The Amtrak intermodal station, which is shared with Greyhound buses, is located downtown, close to major hotels and attractions at 221 W 1st Ave.

=== By bus ===

The bus station for long distance buses is at the same location as the train station (in an intermodal station) at 221 W 1st Ave.  Some of the bus companies also have additional stop at the airport and/or in different parts of town:

==Get around==

===By Bus===

'''Spokane Transit (STA)''' offers reliable, easy-to-use local bus service from Cheney to Liberty Lake and Deer Park to the southern boundary of the City of Spokane. Most routes run through downtown Spokane and the STA Plaza. Bus route maps can be found online, on Spokane Transit buses, and at the STA Plaza. Most drivers are very friendly and helpful, so ask any questions you may have. STA operates using two-hour and all-day passes.[http://www.spokanetransit.com]

===By Car===
Car rentals are available near Spokane International Airport. All of the major companies are located there. Returning cars at the airport can be a little confusing. The main entrance to the rental return is an entire mile before the airport terminal (left at Flint Rd.) You can also drop off passengers and turn right at Flint Rd. just past the terminal. Note there are no directional signs for rental cars between these two places. 

'''Interstate 90''' is an excellent way to cross town East-West.  Spokane is accessed from exits #276 ("Geiger Blvd/S Grove Rd") through #285 ("Sprague Ave") along I-90. To get to downtown from I-90 eastbound, exit off at 280 and follow signs to Walnut St and go north on Walnut or continue along parallel road (4th Ave) to Lincoln.  If coming off the westbound lanes exit at #280A and follow signs to Lincoln St and go north on Lincoln into downtown. A north-south freeway is under construction, and won't be finished for many years. Allow more time if you have to go very far in this direction, as there's no express route yet. 

Check with '''Washington State Department of Transportation''' (WSDOT) for current driving conditions. [http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/traffic/spokane]

Locally the road running east & west as '''Sprague Ave''' (through downtown & all the way through [[Spokane Valley]]) & '''W Riverside'''(west of downtown, west of Walnut St) divides the addresses & streets from "North" & "South" while '''Division St (US Hwy 2 and 395 going north from I-90)'''  (going north & south)  divides the addresses & streets from "West" & "East".

===By Bike===
Within the past five years, Spokane has rapidly developed its bicycling infrastructure, adding both protected and unprotected bike lanes, traffic-separated bike trails and paths, and bike parking areas downtown and in major commercial districts. As a result, biking is a convenient and desirable way to commute. Within the six-month period from April to October when the weather is most reliably bicyclist-friendly, it is not uncommon to see throngs of bicycle commuters traveling downtown or to the various districts, like South Perry and Garland. Many employers now offer showers and changing facilities to their employees to encourage cycling. A decent map of area bike lanes and trails can be found at [https://srtc.maps.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=a9c8901a015b4aea8c5e23a927a7fc41].

All Spokane Transit buses feature bike racks with space for two bikes, adding to possible destinations.

'''The Centennial Trail''' runs along the Spokane River from downtown Coeur d'Alene on through the Spokane Valley and downtown Spokane ending in Riverside State Park. The nationally-recognized trail is a favorite among bicyclists, runners, and skaters. Be on the lookout for the particularly dramatic section near Mile 23. Here trail users exit the up-and-coming Kendall Yards neighborhood to downtown (when traveling eastbound) and cross under the century-old Monroe Street Bridge, exposing world-class views of the Spokane Falls. Be sure to take enough time to enjoy this true gem that makes Spokane one of the most beautiful downtown urban areas in the United States. And don't forget a camera.

==See==

*'''Riverfront Park''', centrally located in the heart of downtown on both banks of the Spokane River, was the host of the 1974 World's Fair. Many of the pavilions still exist, including the architecturally-significant U.S. Pavilion. Canada Island, the Rotary Fountain, the Spokane Falls SkyRide, and the Looff Carousel deserve particular mentions, although the site is great even just for a relaxing weekday picnic. The park itself is beautifully maintained, if a bit dated. Fortunately, the passage of a bond by local voters in 2014 means that $65 million will be pumped into Riverfront Park renovations over the next four years. Be sure to check [http://riverfrontparknow.com|online] for updates, as some attractions will be closed at various points in order to facilitate construction.

*'''Manito Park,''' located on the South Hill between 17th Ave and 25nd Ave, west of Grand Blvd and east of Bernard Street. Its steep hills make it a popular wintertime sledding spot. Home to a zoo until 1933, Manito is now a year-round home to a friendly flock of geese and ducks. Manito Park, thanks in part to its size, is home to numerous attractions. Traditional park amenities like playgrounds and grass fields mix with swaths of unmanicured native plants and beautifully maintained gardens such as the Victorian inspired Duncan Garden or the Japanese garden which was a gift from Spokane's sister city, Nishinomiya, Japan. 
*'''Monroe Street Bridge.''' Recently renovated over the course of a two-year construction period, this bridge was built in 1911 and is the largest arch bridge in the United States of America.

*'''Baby Bar''': [https://www.facebook.com/pages/Baby-Bar-Spokane] 827 W 1st Ave, ''+1 509'' 847-1234.

Guinness and Harp on tap.  Live Irish music on Tuesday nights.

*'''Gilded Unicorn''': [http://www.gildedunicorn.com/] 110 S. Monroe, ''+1 509 309-3698.'' Located in the cellar of the historic Montvale Hotel in Spokane's downtown Arts District. The atmosphere is one-of-a-kind and the "happiest hour" (until 6pm and again from 10pm to close) is possibly the best in the city, with small plates and cocktails for $3-5. If you've got a bigger appetite, it also serves full-size plates of modern American cuisine.

===Nightlife===
*'''Globe Bar & Kitchen''': [http://www.globespokane.com/] 204 N Division St, ''(509) 443-4014''. Lively bar with ornate decor including chandeliers, huge TVs, pub food & weekend live music.

===Coffee===
There's no need to turn to alcohol for a great beverage. Beyond its reputation as a brewery destination, Spokane has seen an explosion in its local craft coffee scene. Don't bother with Starbucks, although the international coffee powerhouse is based in Washington. Stick to the local coffeeshops and roasters. These locations offer better coffee, excellent service, and often superb pastries in a killer atmosphere.

*'''Revel 77''': [http://www.revel77coffee.com] 3223 E 57th Ave., ''(509) 280-0518''. Revel 77 is a coffeehouse on the South Hill featuring quiet spots for reading your favorite book, a community table where you and your friends can gather for conversation, and excellent pourover drip coffee exquisitely brewed just for you.
*'''Indaba Coffee''': [http://www.indabacoffee.com] 1425 W Broadway Ave., ''(509) 443-3566''. There's another Indaba location in downtown Spokane, but the original location on West Broadway in West Central truly encapsulates the neighborhood coffeehouse experience. The roaster and coffeeshop also hosts community events, provides job training for at-risk youth, and donates a meal for each bag of coffee sold.
*'''Coeur Coffeehouse''': [http://www.coeurcoffeehouse.com] 701 N. Monroe St., ''(509) 703-7794''. This might just be the most hip coffeeshop in Spokane. Roasting Stumptown, Intelligentsia, and numerous other artisanal and in some cases local roasters, this is the perfect place to grab a pastry and an espresso and get work done in the bright, airy remodeled space.
*'''Roast House''': [https://roasthousecoffee.com/] 423 East Cleveland Ave., ''(509) 995-6500''. Its warehouse is only open for limited hours, but Roast House is perhaps Spokane's most prolific craft roaster. Their warehouse does frequent tastings, but beyond that, their beans can be purchased all over the region.
*'''Atticus''': [https://www.facebook.com/AtticusCoffee/] 222 N Howard St., ''(509) 747-0336''. Atticus features a lively, loud, urban atmosphere, excellent craft coffee and great pastries. They also feature an extensive Pacific Northwest gift selection.

==Stay safe==

People in Spokane are generally quite kind and hospitable. The city is quite safe, and violent crime is rare. That said, Spokane has had ongoing challenges with property crime and vehicle theft. As such, if parking a vehicle, be sure to lock the doors and ensure that all valuables are in the trunk.  The city has had a problem with homeless drug addicts(especially the ones who are meth addicts), and passed a law that requires the homeless to only stay in the downtown area, so you probably don't have to deal with them so much in the rest of Spokane due to strict punishments if this law is viloated, but if you are downtown expect to see a heavy population of them everywhere.  Also, use caution when walking through Riverfront Park or on the Centennial Trail at night.

==Contact==

Spokane is one of a few cities nationwide that has '''Wi-Fi''' access just about everywhere Downtown. The entire Downtown area is a '''Wi-Fi hotspot''' or an area where wireless Internet is provided free of charge (2 hours per day) if your computer is equipped for Wi-Fi. Unfortunately, there's no free Wi-Fi at the airport yet, though the Boingo network (daily fee after 20 mins.) is available.

==Get out==
Although the destinations of [[Seattle]], [[Portland]], [[Glacier National Park]], [[Mount Rainier]], and [[Mt. St. Helens]] are popular with locals, these generally are not day trips. That said, Spokane has the closest international airport to a number of locations in the Inland Northwest and B.C. Interior, so it can be a good base for exploration further afield.

* The Inland Northwest features some of the best access to great skiing on the continent. A quick 45-minute drive north from downtown leads to '''Mt. Spokane Ski & Snowboard Park''', a five-chairlift day ski area within the larger '''Mt. Spokane State Park''' [http://www.mtspokane.com/]. Drive further afield and you can easily reach 49 Degrees North to the north or '''Silver Mountain''' [http://silvermt.com/], '''Lookout Pass''' [http://skilookout.com], or '''Schweitzer''' [http://schweitzer.com] in the northern Idaho Panhandle. Schweitzer, located in [[Sandpoint]], Idaho, features 2,900 acres and eight chairlifts, including two high-speed quads and Idaho's only high-speed six-pack.
* Also, 40 minutes east of downtown is the lakefront tourist town of '''[[Coeur d'Alene]], [[Idaho]]'''. It's also known for its quaint downtown.
* '''[[Grand Coulee|Grand Coulee Dam]]''' [http://www.grandcouleedam.org] About 88 miles from Spokane, the largest electric power-producing facility in the U.S., and one of the largest concrete structures in the world. A laser light show is sometimes held after dark on summer nights (check schedule).
* '''[[Walla Walla]]''' Originally known for its funny name and famous sweet onions, traditional crops have been replaced by the vineyards of over 100 area wineries. Due to the distance (157 mi/256 km) and large number (for its size) of hotels and Bed and Breakfasts, many visitors stay overnight. If too pricey, [[Pendleton]], [[Oregon]] is much cheaper.
