{{pagebanner|Doha Banner.jpg}}  

'''Doha''' is the capital of [[Qatar]]. It is a modern and rapidly developing city and, considering the money being poured into construction, Doha looks set to become one of the premier cities in the Gulf within a few years.

==Understand==
===Climate===
Doha has a hot desert climate like the rest of [[Qatar]]. The best time to visit the city is from December to March when the weather isn't too hot during the day. Temperatures at this time of year usually roam around 25°C (75°F) during the day and between 10-15°C (50-60°F) during the night. The mercury can drop below 10°C (50°F) sometimes but any recording below 5°C (42°F) is extremely rare. The record low is 3.8°C (38.8°F). 75 millimetres of rain fall in Doha on average annually and 95% of it is concentrated in months. Summers are long, very hot and typically last from April to November. Temperatures during the day hover around 30°C (86°F) in April and November and around 35°C (95°F) in October. The hottest part of the summer is from May to September when the average high ranges from 38°C (100°F) to 42°C (107°F) and the heat can become really uncomfortable coupled with the humidity from the Persian Gulf. Most of the city's residents stay inside from 11am-7pm and it's recommended that you either use public transport or take a taxi to where you want to go. Above 45°C (113°F) aren't uncommon and Doha is one of a few cities in the world where the record high is 50°C (123°F). Unfortunately the city does remain hot even during the night as the average low is 30°C (86°F) in July and August.

==Get in==

Citizens of many nationalities can receive a free visa on arrival at Doha Airport (for EU citizens it is valid for 90 days). It has form of a barcode sticked into your passport; no arrival card is to be filled-in, the immigration officer will just ask for hotel where you stay but you can say that you have just a stopover without any hotel stay. 

===By plane===
[http://www.dohaairport.com/ '''Doha International Airport'''] ({{IATA|DOH}}) ({{ICAO|OTDB}}) is becoming increasingly important in the Persian Gulf Region. Local carrier [http://www.qatarairways.com Qatar Airways] is building a worldwide network from there and already connects the city with destinations in [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Australia]], [[Europe]], [[India|Indian Sub-continent]], [[North America]] and [[South America]]. In 2013 it joined the [http://www.oneworld.com/ oneworld] airline alliance.
[[Image:DohaWestBay.JPG|thumb|Modern buildings in Doha along the Corniche]]
If you're already in or around the Persian Gulf region, the cheapest way to fly to Doha is with [http://www.omanair.com/en/ Oman Air] or with [https://www.kuwaitairways.com/en/Pages/default.aspx  Kuwait Airways], but you will almost certainly have to break your journey in [[Kuwait City]] or [[Muscat]], the airlines' hub in the [[Oman]] and [[Kuwait]].

For those with longer layovers in Doha and desire to get out of the airport, you may be eligible for a free city tour. Refer to the "See" section below for more information.

Getting to the airport is very easy from December 2019 when metro to the airport was opened. Ticket (2 QAR = about 0.5 EUR) can be purchased in vending machines at entrance to any metro station, payment by contactless card is possible. Operation hours are approx. 6:00 - 22:30 (except Friday morning). It goes every 5 minutes and you will get to downtown in about 20 min. 

===By car===

There were plans to build bridges linking Qatar with both [[Bahrain|Bahrain]] and the [[United Arab Emirates|United Arab Emirates]] in the future but as both countries have cut diplomatic ties with Qatar this has been suspended indefinitely.

==Get around==

Note that most hotels and other places do not use street numbers or even street names in their addresses. E.g. the W-hotel Doha states its address as: Westbay, Doha, Qatar. Therefore it is often difficult to find a place, and people navigate by using landmarks, such as 'opposite City Center mall' or 'by Sports roundabout'. Google maps is quite useful, although it needs more updating, and street view is not available in Qatar (as of June 2017). The Ministry of Municipality & Urban Planning has been installing street number plates since 2012. There is also a website called Qatar Geoportal, which is accurate but much slower than Google maps. 

===Bus===

In late 2005, a public bus service, with two different routes, was introduced as the city's first mode of public transport. By March 2006, there were six routes running and nowadays there is a wide network of bus routes covering the whole city as well as other cities. The main bus station is a large open lot adjacent to the Gold Souq.
Buses are air conditioned as well as some bus stands.

===Taxi===

The only other way to get around without your own vehicle is by taxi. The air-conditioned green taxis are operated by the Mowasalat transport company known as "Karwa" taxis. The other kind of taxis are "limousine" taxis, which are unmarked - and thus almost impossible to stop - and may well be your only choice when staying at an international hotel. They are more expensive (can cost twice as much as the Karwas), and may not feature a meter. If you feel secure about the price, you may negotiate it up front. Otherwise, insist on a meter.

The starting meter fare is 4 reals. Minimum fare for each trip is 10 reals. There have been reports of taxi drivers using rigged mechanical meters that run at 4-5 times the speed of the normal meter (Feb 2016).You should pay attention to the meter readings and request the driver to stop the car if you notice anything unusual. In theory, you shouldn't pay the driver and you are encouraged to report the incident to the company's complaints department via your hotel.

The demand for taxis exceeds the supply and waiting times can vary greatly. Trying to obtain one during morning business hours requires about 24 hours notice. In other circumstances it may take 90 minutes or more to get an on-call taxi, and stopping one may be impossible in many places. The only places where you are guaranteed to find a taxi (normal or limousine) are at major malls, the airport and international hotels. As of May 2019 there seem to be plenty of taxis available, beeping to get your attention.

Occasionally, a local driver will offer to give you a ride if he or she sees you on the side of the road. It is customary to offer some money at the end, though sometimes they will refuse to take it. You can tell when someone is offering if they slow down and flash their headlights at you; beckon them over with a wave in response.

Uber taxi service is available in Doha since December 2013. This smart-phone based taxi service seems to work well: they arrive at your location typically within 15 minutes. As well as other services like [https://www.mydriver.com/en/airport-transfer/doha myDriver] You receive a photo of the driver with his name and telephone number, which is a good security feature.

===Car Hire===

Tourists can hire a car at one of the several car-rental agencies located at the Doha International Airport. It is recommended that you have a vehicle reserved before touching down at the airport, otherwise tourists may not be able to obtain the best price and/or encounter waits while cars are brought into the temporary parking area from outside lots. Some rental agencies will require that you have an international drivers' licence.

==See==

For those with longer layovers in Doha airport, Qatar Airways and Qatar Tourism Authority offer free [http://www.qatarairways.com/global/en/offers/doha-city-tour.page?cid=AFALL101730 Doha City Tour] four times a day, each lasting about two hours forty five minutes with free visa, bus transportation, English speaking guide and visits to The Pearl, Katara Cultural Village, Museum of Islamic Art, and Souq Wasif. Tours depart at 8am, 11am, 4pm and 8pm (as of September 2016) but assembly time is one hour prior to the start time and the check in closes another fifteen minutes prior to the assembly time so budget at least four full hours. The bus sits 33 people and tours are offered on first come, first served basis with no advanced sign up is possible. Tour desk is located near WHSmith shop in the main shopping/duty free area of the airport, at the beginning of B concourse. 

Note that technically you are only eligible for this tour if your ticket is issued by Qatar Airways - in other words, if you paid for your ticket (or redeemed frequent flier miles) through any other airline, you will not be able to take this tour even if all your flights are actually flown by Qatar Airways. What matters is the first three digits of your 13 digit eTicket number - those issued by Qatar Airways will start with 157. However, the enforcement of this is not consistent - if you get turned away, try coming back later/when the tour desk is not as busy/different representative is working - you might just get lucky.

Also note that the this tour is fast paced with only one ~30 minute stop at the Souk and just quick 5-10 minute stops in other places to take pictures (ie no admission to the museum, etc).

Since August 2017, nationals of 80 countries can also enter Qatar visa free! ([https://www.qatarairways.com/en/visa-free-arrival.html details & available countries]). 

If visa free entry is not available, you can also take [https://www.qatarairways.com/en/qatar-transit-visa.html free Transit Visa] now for exploring Doha. This transit visa is available free of cost to the passengers of Qatar Airways, if the transit time or stop over time in Doha is between 5 to 96 hours. However applying for this visa online is shambolically organized: the site requires you to upload passport scans, and does not allow nationals of the US, Britain, Australia and other Western countries to apply. (These options are not in the 'Nationality' dropdown box.) The visa wait time is 7 days.

===Museums===
Considering Doha is attempting to become something of a regional cultural hub, the current state of its [http://www.qma.org.qa/en/ museums] is somewhat shambolic. Many museums are closed for seemingly never-ending refurbishment, the opening hours not particularly tourist friendly (eg closed on weekends), websites lack basic information such as opening times and location, and many museums require you to phone in advance for a special appointment (which can make the solo visitor feel somewhat uncomfortable as the curator opens up just for 1 person).  All of this means that there is only really one proper museum (the Museum of Islamic Art) which you can visit without having to phone in advance.

*[http://www.mia.org.qa Museum of Islamic Art] - An iconic feature of the Doha skyline, the Museum of Islamic Art represents the full scope of Islamic art from three continents over 1,400 years. The Museum was designed by noted architect I.M. Pei, who was inspired by elements of classic Islamic architecture. There are regular special exhibitions, events, lectures and activities. The Museum is also home to IDAM, an Alain Ducasse restaurant. Connected to the Museum is MIA Park where you can participate in activities, rent bicycles and paddleboats, or just gaze at the Doha skyline. Opens Su-Th 10:30, F/Sa 12:00. Closed Tuesdays

Sheikh Faisal expresses his appreciation for both his own faith and culture, as well as his personal interests and passions through this museum. The fact that he chooses to share this with anybody that is interested is in itself quite unique. Features more than 3,000 unique pieces, including ancient Islamic manuscripts, major archaeological findings, metal objects, textiles, carpets, embroidery and antique furniture. There is also a comprehensive and fascinating collection of historic cars, including a 19th century steam vehicle.  Open Mon-Thu & Sat 9am-6pm.  Arrangements made in advance, contact Mr Waleed Al Dolaimi on 5569 1406. It is located 30km west of Doha on the Dukhan highway.

The myth of Ghilan and Mae (which is believed to be from Al Khor, and features the region’s first female pirate) is displayed in the hall, together with displays of marine life and artifacts. +974 44721866 [http://www.qma.com.qa/en/cultural-a-heritage/forts-a-towers/towers/102-al-khor-museum]. Free. Opening hours a mystery, best to phone in advance.

''' Al Wakrah Museum ''' - lies in the town of Al Wakrah, about 17 km south of the capital and displays marine life and natural history materials [http://www.explore-qatar.com/culture_and_heritage/museums/Al-Wakra-Museum]

'''Museum of Orientalists''' [http://www.timeoutdoha.com/art/features/11369-secret-gem] [http://www.qm.org.qa/en/project/orientalist-museum] - The Orientalist Collection of the State of Qatar is one of the most significant collections ever assembled in the world. The approximate 700 hundred paintings, water colours, drawings and prints, acquired over the last twenty years, trace Orientalism back to the early 18th century. Off Al Muthaf Street, Mirqab.

''' Weaponry Museum''' - The museum houses a spectacular display of weapons and artifacts dating back to the 16th century. The collection has magnificent ceremonial swords that belonged to members of the Gulf’s ruling families: an 18th century gold-encased dagger owned by Sheikh Ali Bin Abdullah Al Thani; a sword belonging to King Faisal Bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia; and a khanjar (traditional curved dagger) carried by the famed Lawrence of Arabia. The beauty and rarity of this collection bears witness to craftsmanship that has been lost for generations. The Museum is in the Al Luqta area of Doha and is open mornings, Sunday to Thursday, by appointment only, after obtaining a letter of authorization from the Museums Authority. Call Mr Yousef Mahmoud on 4486 7473.

'''Photography museum''' - (Not open as of May 2012). The Photographic Museum was designed by Santiago Calatrava, one of the most famous architects in the world. This unique museum will become a landmark within the urban setting and contribute to the urban development of the area situated in the centre of Doha City. The Government collection of photography - composed of some 15,000 items including historic cameras and accessories, and prominent photographs, 1960s albums and historic documents - will be exhibited, along some temporary exhibitions.

===Cultural Heritage===
[[File:Souq Waqif, Doha, Catar, 2013-08-05, DD 82.JPG|thumb|Souq Waqif]]
'''Al Koot Fort''' - Built in 1880, during the Ottoman period, this big white fort is located in what is now the parking lot of Souq Waqif. At the time it was built, however, the fort was located on the outskirts of the city. Though the fort was formerly used as an ethnographic museum, the building currently houses a museum where one can see local handicrafts, including oil paintings, glasswork and ceramics.  It is a popular place to take photos.

'''Clock Tower''' - located next to the Grand Mosque, this old clock tower features Eastern Arabic numerals on its face. The tower is also located on a hill, and as such offers some wonderful views of the Corniche.

'''Doha Heritage Village''' - located along the Corniche in Al Rumeilia Park, is a skanzen based on a traditional Qatari village. Visitors can expect to see weaving, pearl trading, and a dhow (traditional boat). Also holds occasional festivals and activities.

'''Souq Waqif''' - Another place that is very worth going is Souq Waqif, the renovated Arabic market quarter. You can easily wander around the maze-like corridors for hours. The Souq is organized more or less by what is sold. There is a section of spice shops, another of textiles, and even a quarter where they sell falcons. Also look for places to buy souvenirs, sit down to smoke a Sheesha, or enjoy food at one of the restaurants bordering it. However, it can come across as rather staged; the 'perfectness' of the place results in the atmosphere being somewhat fake.

''' Al Zubara Fort ''' -  Situated just 100 km north of Doha lies the town of Al Zubarah, an important archaeological site famous for its old fort. This fort-turned-museum was constructed in 1938 during the reign of Sheikh Abdullah Bin Jassim Al-Thani and was erected on the ruins of a neighbouring fort. The fort itself is squre-shaped with circular towers in three of its corners and a rectangular tower in the fourth. With high, thick walls, this fort also served as a coast-guard station and, until the mid-1980’s, was used by the military. Can be accessed by No.100 bus from Al Ghanim bus station, approx 2 hours of journey. Be ware, only 3 buses per day.

'''Heritage library''' - Over 51,000 books in Arabic and other languages on Qatar and the Middle East, together with 600 antique maps, 2,000 manuscripts and 6,000 original photographs, will form The Arabian and Islamic Heritage Library in Qatar, another initiative of HH Sheikha Mozah Bint Nasser Al Missned through Qatar Foundation. It will be one of the biggest research centres in the Middle East, and is based on a collection started by Sheikh Hassan Bin Mohamed Al Thani in 1979.

'''Virginia Commonwealth University Qatar’s gallery''' - The gallery at the VCU-Q campus in Education City regularly hosts visiting exhibitions as well as the work of faculty members and students. On those occasions, the gallery is open to the general public. Located in the heart of a city and region with an extraordinarily vibrant and diverse cultural heritage, VCUQatar plays a central role in the modern cultural life of Qataris and Middle Easterners.  Whether in the studio, the library, the computer laboratory, or the lecture halls, students can expand their cultural perspectives as well as acquire expertise for the workplace within an energetic and compassionate learning environment.
 
It has grown steadily since then through planned acquisition and purchase.
 
The collection will include Arab manuscripts, a foreign language section dating back to the 15th century, and 20th century books about art and politics. The library is scheduled to open by 2010 in a new, specially designed building.

===Other Attractions===
[[Image:corniche_orry.jpg|thumb|Orry stands tall on Doha's Corniche]]
'''Corniche''' - The visual highlight of Doha is Al-Corniche, a long seaside promenade that curves around Doha Bay and affords pretty views of Palm Tree Island and the city's skyscrapers. In the afternoons you will see plenty of locals strolling along the Corniche, often trying to get out of the way of the odd crazy Western ex-pat on rollerblades. It's also a good place for jogging. Cycling is prohibited. If you're looking to have the scenery all to yourself, go on a Friday morning.  

There are several parks close to the Corniche which are ideal for families, as well as several statues. Of note is a giant statue of '''Orry''', the Oryx who was the mascot for the 15th Asian Games, which took place in Doha from December 1-15, 2006. On the south end of the Corniche is a large '''Oyster and Pearl''' statue and near the Museum of Islamic Art is the '''Water Pots''' fountain.

'''The Pearl Qatar''' - This high-end, luxury neighbourbood is located on a man-made island off the coast on the northern side of Doha. It is good for walking around the Porto Arabia marina, seeing cruise boats, the Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, Maserati and Ferrari car showrooms, having a meal (no alcohol available (2014)) and looking at the designer clothes shops. You can take the water taxi across the Porto Arabia marina. There is a fascinating 'Venice-like community' area called Qanat Quartier, which has an extensive canal system, pedestrian-friendly squares and plazas and beachfront townhouses. There is also a replica of Venice's Rialto Bridge. It is a bit strange as there is almost no one there (2014), and it looks very new, so it feels like being on a film set.

'''Doha Zoo''' - located near the Sports City complex, the Doha Zoo features a variety of animals, including the Oryx, Qatar's national animal. Doha Zoo is closed for a complete renovation - expected to re-open sometime in 2017.

'''Rumeila Park''' - A landscaped park on Doha Corniche with an outdoor theatre, art gallery, water features, children’s play area and skateboard/rollerblading half-pipe. There are several shops, a cafeteria and public toilets in the park which used to be known as Al Bidda Park. Midway along the corniche, the unfenced Rumeilah (Al-Bidda) Park has some fun attractions for children, including a Ferris wheel, boats and the only train in Arabia since Lawrence (albeit a miniature one).
2012 - The park is somewhat run down now, all the shops have closed and the ferris wheel, train & boats no longer there

'''Jungle Zone''' -  offers 3500 sq m of animal-themed children's attractions. Qatar's most popular indoor theme park located at Hyatt Plaza, near Khalifa Stadium in the booming city of Doha, offers fun and excitement for kids and family-alike to enjoy.

''' Al Shahaneya ''' - Located 57 km away from Doha on the road to Dukhan. Al Shahaneya is private nature conservative farm that features various animals from the Local Environment. it can be great destination for a family day to relax under the treas and enjoy wildlife with a barbecue Arabic meal. 

''' Katara Cultural Village ''' - Located in West Bay Area. a huge Cultural City which host a roman style public auditorium, Museums, Galleries, Libraries and many more cultural attraction. Several restaurants offer Egyptian, Indian, Turkish and seafood cuisine.

==Do==
Doha has a reputation for not being the most exciting place on earth, however, there are a variety of activities, areas and events to take part in. It's up to you to find out what's going on or organize your own events. Plenty of people will be keen to join in.

Dhow boat ride: set sail from the Corniche. You can usually negotiate the rate for a trip around the bay. You can also rent an entire dhow boat for the afternoon and evening for a private party. This is great fun. The boat will sail out to close to the Al Safliya island. You can jump off the boat and swim to the island. On weekends in suitable weather, the water can be busy with party dhow boats, cruise boats and jet skis. With all the noise and action, there is an exciting atmosphere. You can also watch the dramatic sunset over the high rise buildings in West Bay.

===Doha Debates===
The Qatari government has worked hard to make Doha an educational centre in the Middle East. One of the benefits of this is the Doha Debates [http://www.dohadebates.com/], where top political and academic minds in the Arab world come together to discuss difficult issues in the Arab World. Past debates have discussed whether Palestinians risk becoming their own worst enemy, whether the Sunni-Shia conflict damages Islam's reputation as a religion of peace, or if Muslims are failing to combat extremism.

The debates are always very thought-provoking and a good window to understanding the current state of the Arab world. Tickets are extremely limited but can be obtained from the website above.

UPDATE: The debates have been suspended, it has not been announced if/when they will resume in the future.

[[Image:doha_sheesha_cafe.jpg|thumb|The Ras-Naswa sheesha cafe on the Corniche]]
===Sheesha===
A typical Middle Eastern activity in the afternoons is to find a sheesha cafe and smoke some fruit-flavoured tobacco. One of the best places in Doha is Ras-Naswa at the non-Sheraton end of the Corniche. Located in a picturesque old-style building reminiscient, in colour and texture if not grandeur, of the red Mughal structures in India, Ras-Naswa has a nice outdoor garden and serves decent Middle Eastern food.

==Buy==
You can buy pretty much anything you want in Doha, apart from pork products and alcohol (except with a licence or in the major hotels). Shopping is a major leisure pursuit of many Qataris and expats, and you can expect cheaper prices than [[Dubai]]. As with most of the Middle East, be prepared to bargain.

[[Image:Villaggio.JPG|thumb|Canal inside in the Villaggio Mall]]

===Malls===
Typically, most malls in Doha are open from 10am to 10pm Saturday to Thursday. Most will be closed on Friday mornings but will open up during the evening, when they'll be the most crowded. Also, be aware that some malls schedule "Family Days", where single men will be turned away at the door. In practice, however, most Westerners will be allowed in, but brown-skinned persons (particularly South Asians in their native dressing) will be turned away.

'''City Centre-Doha''' opened in April 2001 and is the largest shopping centre in Qatar. Located in West Bay, the modern part of the city on the Northern end of the Corniche, it offers a large and diverse shopping experience, including several jewellery and perfume stores. For entertainment there is a large multiplex cinema, a bowling alley, a children's arcade, as well as an indoor ice skating rink. There are several eating options including two food courts as well as several sit-down restaurants. By western standards, this mall is quite dated for its age, but remains popular due to its large size and ideal location. Finally, the mall is home to a large Carrefour supermarket. 

'''Villaggio''' is one of Doha's newest malls, located near the Aspire Centre. The mall is designed to look like Venice in terms of architecture. The mall is home to many western stores, as well as a large Carrefour. The food court is home to several Western-style fast food restaurants, as well as several sit-down options. For entertainment, there is currently a long canal offering gondola rides for 15 QR and an ice-skating rink for 30 QR. A cinema is in the works for the future. (Update: this 3D Cinema opened in mid 2010.)

'''Hyatt Plaza''' is located near Sports City and the newer Villaggio in the Western suburbs. This shopping mall is comparatively smaller than others, but as a plus it is always less crowded. There is a good sized food court and a large children's playland called "Jungle Zone." 

'''Landmark Shopping Mall''' [http://landmarkdoha.com/enLang/index.php] focuses mostly on clothing, jewellery, and cosmetics. There is also a Carrefour market for groceries. It is located in the northern suburbs.

'''The Mall''' was opened in October 1997 and is Qatar's first shopping mall. Tourists are better off going to any of the aforementioned locations if they wish to purchase store goods. 

[[Image:Souqs.JPG|thumb|Souq Waqif]]

===Souqs===
The best shopping experiences, however, are to be had in the various souqs (markets). Not far from the Corniche near an HSBC branch and a landmark spiral tower is the '''Souq Waqif''' (also referred to as the Iranian Souq or Old Souq), a good place to pick up souvenirs and to see falcons for sale with a pleasant ambience. Souq Waqif is full of nice-looking traditional architecture and has many different kinds of stores. Definitely worth a visit. There are also a number of restaurants and sheesha bars on the main street too.

Another souq worth visiting is the '''Omani Souq''' on Haloul St, parallel to Salwa Road. There you can buy things like spices, incense and woven baskets. Next door is a vegetable market.

The '''Gold Souq''', near HSBC by the bus station, is the place to buy gold and jewellery.

==Eat==
{{infobox|Drinks|Because of the restricted availability of alcohol in Qatar, you cannot drink alcohol at restaurants except those that are part of international hotels}}
[[Image:dohapearl.jpg|thumb|Doha Pearl fountain with Al-Bandar restaurant complex in the background]]

Given the population diversity in Doha, there is a large variety of different types of cuisine, including Indian, Thai, Chinese, Italian, Korean and, of course, typical Middle Eastern food.

===American Food===

Among the American fast food chains in Doha are McDonald's, KFC, Hardee's, Arby's, Burger King and Dairy Queen. Pizza places include Pizza Hut, Papa John's, Little Caesar's and Pizza Inn. Many of these are located in the major shopping centres or at the intersection of C-Ring and Salwa Road. Though known by the locals as Ramada Junction, (due to the Ramada being there), most Westerners jokingly refer to it as "Cholesterol Corner" due to the high number of fast food and other restaurants within a block or less of it. Johnny Rockets and California Tortilla are also present.

There are also more upscale American chains, including TGI Fridays (in the Landmark and Villaggio shopping malls), Applebee's, Chili's, Fuddruckers, Bennigan's and Ponderosa Steakhouse. Recently, "Roger's Diner" and "Red Lobster" were opened too. They are located right opposite to each other on C-Ring Road, near the BMW, Audi and Mini Showrooms.

Finally, Starbucks are '''very''' common in the malls around Doha.  Most restaurants (even the fast food restaurants such as McDonald's) offer delivery in and around town.

===Indian===
Doha is home to a large Indian population. As such, the city centre is full of small Indian restaurants.

There are many other excellent Indian restaurants in Doha. Recently opened is "The Garden Village Restaurant Doha" recommended for its good ambience and nice Indian Village model interior. This is located opposite Yaarmuk Petrol Station & Nissan showroom (ahead of Al Ahli Hospital while going from Ramada signal).

===Middle Eastern Food===
'''Turkey Central''' on Al-Mirghab St. offers good, cheap Middle Eastern fare. The portions are large (try the Mixed Grill or Shish Tawooq) and the appetizers are excellent, particularly the chili labneh. To get there, turn right off C Ring Road just after TGIFriday's if you're heading away from City Centre. Across the street from Turkey Central and a little further east toward TGIFriday's is a good small Thai restaurant, Thai Snack. For Persian food, try Shebestan on al-Sadd Street just east of C Ring Road. Many good restaraunts in the Souq Waqif, or old Souq, are also worth trying. Perhaps the best include Tagine (Moroccan food) and Le Gourmet, particularly good for sheesha and a cup of tea. These are not as inexpensive as Turkey Central but have good atmosphere.

===Seafood===
'''Best Fish''' a little further down Al-Mirghab St. sells good local fish dishes at reasonable prices, and has just been redecorated inside. The Grilled Hammour with garlic butter is recommended. For the best fish in town at upscale prices, try the Fish Market at the Movenpick Hotel.

==Drink==
Alcohol is only available in bars attached to international hotels such as the Ramada, W Hotel, Grand Hyatt, the Ritz-Carlton, etc. Bars are now required that patrons show identification at the door, so tourists will need to keep their passport on them when visiting these establishments. Crystal Lounge and Waham at the W Hotel and Skyview Bar and La Cigale are some of the places favoured by local expats. There is an excellent Irish pub with frequent live music in the basement of the Sheraton on the Corniche near City Centre Mall. 

To purchase alcohol outside these bars, you must have a Residence Permit and apply for a alcohol licence. When you have that, you can purchase a certain amount of alcohol each month (equalling 10% of your salary) from one bottle shop on the outskirts of town know as Qatar Distribution Company (QDC).

It is forbidden to bring alcohol into the country and customs at Hamad International Airport will confiscate any bottles of alcohol they find - all bags are X-rayed and a receipt is issued for you to reclaim your goods when you leave the country.

Soft drinks and other non-alcoholic beverages are readily available.

Some of its amenities are Wi-Fi connectivity, health club, business centre, and laundry service.</sleep>

* '''Al Muntazah Plaza Hotel''' [http://www.sigmahotels.com/index.php?option=com_hotels&task=viewhotel&id=4114]. Fully furnished 2/3 bedrooms apartments as well as standard hotel rooms, situated on the prestigious Al-Muntazah Road convenient for the corniche, city centre, airport, supermarkets and the shopping centres.

* '''Shezan Hotel'''. In the centre. Quite small with 60 rooms and a restaurant serving a range of Pakistani and international delicacies.

* '''InterContinental''' [http://www.ichotelsgroup.com/h/d/ic/1/en/hotel/dohha]. Five minutes up the coast from the town centre and directly across the road from the seemingly never open Alladin's Kingdom amusement park. The pool and beach complex at are large, quiet and relaxing. The restaurants are nothing special, but the rooms are great and the nightlife decent.

* '''Movenpick Hotel Doha''' [http://www.moevenpick-doha.com], tel: +974 429 1111. Four star hotel on The Corniche with an all day dining restaurant and Piano Bar. 

* '''Marriott''' [http://www.marriott-doha.com/]. In a slightly out of the way location, but since nowhere in Doha is really walkable, that's not a huge strike against it. It has two towers of excellent four-star rooms and a selection of restaurants few hotels can match: the Mexican is acceptable, the pan-Asian quite good, the buffet nothing special, and the Indian really great. Alcohol is available in the restaurants, but there is no cocktail lounge or bar. There is a disco attached to the hotel that has a door policy to match Studio 54 at its 1970s peak (again though, showing up in a Maserati will get you whisked inside).

* '''Mercure Doha''' [http://www.mercuredoha.com]. A four-star hotel belonging to the Accor group. Located pretty much in the town centre, it has a sauna, a swimming pool and various restaurants. Shuttle buses go regularly from and to the airport. Its location means you can actually walk around and see things just outside the door (unlike most Doha hotels, which are someone isolated), but it is also a little less tranquil.

*'''Ramada''' [http://www.ramada.com/hotel/15334]. A comfortable four-star hotel with a few pleasant surprises. The Indian restaurant is one of the best in town (and, because it's in a hotel, it serves alcohol). The pub-turn-disco on the hotel's ground floor is a large club that on weekends comes alive under the guidance of a Filipino cover band and hundreds of Asian workers letting lose after a hard 6-day work week. The Library Bar, on the hotels top floor, has a small, slightly worn clubby field populated by large-bellied ex-pats. But the beer is cold and the mural around the walls is something to behold. 

* '''Merweb Hotel''', Al-Sadd Road. Newish, pleasant three-star hotel.

* '''Mövenpick Tower & Suites''' [http://www.moevenpick-doha-tower.com], West Bay. New landmark in Doha, 26 storey tower at the entrance to West Bay, 15 minutes drive from the airport. 350 rooms and suites. Facilities include conference rooms and restaurants.

==Get out==
===Desert Safari===
If you want to get out of the city, the desert awaits. Whereas you could take your rental car out to the sand dunes, unless you are familiar with the route or GPS, you run the risk of damaging your rental car and getting lost. The alternative is to go through one of Qatar's many tour companies, which can arrange a trip. This will cost you several hundred Qatari riyals, and may require a minimum of four persons to join in the fun. At international hotels, the receptionists will advise you, and hire a driver for you. Otherwise, there are several tour companies that can arrange a trip by phone or via their website:

* Al Mazaya Tourism
* Arabian Adventures [http://www.arabianadventureqatar.net/]
* Black Pearl [http://blackpearltourism.weebly.com/index.html]
* City Discovery [http://www.city-discovery.com/doha/SUB31I-Safari-Tours]
* Doha Sooq [http://doha.dbanksouq.com/dohasooq/en/Shopping/tabid/62/CategoryID/96/List/1/catpageindex/4/Level/a/ProductID/75/Default.aspx]

* Gulf Adventures [http://www.gulf-adventures.com]

* Qatar International Tours [http://www.inboundtoursqatar.com/]
* Qatar Travel Tours [http://qatar.travel-culture.com/tours/]
* Desert Safari Doha [https://www.desertsafaridoha.com]

Beyond sand dune trips, several of these will always arrange for overnight desert camping, excursions to historical sites, and city tours.

===Inland Sea===
Located in the far south-eastern quarter of the country right down on the Saudi Arabian border is the Inland Sea known as Khor Al Daid in Arabic. The inland sea is an enormous inlet from the Persian Gulf surrounded by massive soft sand dunes that can only be reached by a hair-raising drive across the sand in a 4-wheel drive vehicle.

===Singing Sand Dunes===
In the desert 40 km southwest of Doha are the so-called Singing Sand Dunes. This is one of the few places on Earth that has "singing" sand. When the humidity is low and the wind blows along the sand an eerie hum sound can be heard. This sound can be amplified by running across the sand, or by sledding down it. Since the dunes are located a bit off road, you may want a GPS to arrive. The coordinates are N25° 02.446' E51° 24.540'.

===Other cities===
Doha is by far the biggest city in Qatar, with more than 80% of residents residing in the city or surrounding suburbs. The country's other cities are quite small. Still, for those who want to see more of the country, they can be quite rewarding.[http://www.regus.qa/locations/business-centre/doha-airport]
