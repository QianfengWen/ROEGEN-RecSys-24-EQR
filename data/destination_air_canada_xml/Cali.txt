===By bus===

From the ''Terminal de transportes'' you can choose between many different regional, national and domestic destinations. Expreso Bolivariano leaves Terminal de Transportes, Bogotá, regularly throughout the day and night with journeys taking between 10 and 12 hours to reach Cali. Tickets are priced between $55.000 and $70.000 pesos depending on luxury, availability and time of departure (as of August 2015).

The trip from the airport to the terminal lasts around 20-30 minutes and you can do it either by taxi (45,000 COP) or mini-van (6,500 COP - May 2017). Walking out the terminal via the tunnel towards the west and along Avenida 3N connects you to the closest MIO Bus Stop (Avenida de Las Américas - GPS: 3.463587,-76.525299) with a Ticket Office, from here you can connect to just about anywhere in the city. The maps in the MIO station list which bus numbers stop at which stations, so simply work your trip backwards connecting bus numbers.

Recommendation: Travel only by certified transport companies, like Expreso Palmira, Bolivariano or Expreso Brasilia. These companies bring you safety and comfort for you and your luggage. You may bargain with other companies, but the trip may be very uncomfortable.

==Get around==

===By taxi===

Taxis are a fast and affordable way to get around the city. Only use official cars and its strongly recommended to call for one if possible (you may call the local numbers 444 44 44 (this service also has android app : search "taxis libres cali" in Androoid Market), 555 55 55, or 660 60 60 and ask for one, your name and destination will be registered in the head office). Make sure the driver starts the meter running. The meters count units, not in the local currency. The minimum fare during daytime is 4,200 COP, after 20:00, on sundays and  holidays it's 5,300 COP. Every unit is 84 COP and is marked every 80 meters or 50 seconds of waiting.  Do not leave your luggage inside the taxi while you are not around as sometimes drivers drive off as soon as you are out the taxi with your luggage still in the trunk. '''In any case, many of the taxi drivers are nice and gentle people and have some good stories to tell''', which makes for a far more rewarding experience if you speak or understand Spanish at a reasonable level.  Be sure to pay what they ask because they will call the cops and not let you out until receiving the full fare.
[http://www.paginasamarillas.com.co/busqueda/taxis-cali Taxis in Cali],[http://www.dottransfers.com/colombia/cali/ Private Car Service]. Other Taxi apps such as InDrive (Uber like) are currently operating in the city and take the negociating out of the picture.

===By bus===

* '''MIO - Masivo Integrado de Occidente''': Inaugurated in March 2009, this transport system consists of large blue buses running in exclusive lanes with enclosed stations and offers the best option for local transit.  All buses are air-conditioned, clean and safe. It is a card based system, but cards can be used once and dropped into the gate. Otherwise you can get a reusable card at the bus stations and other locations. A one way trip costs 2,000 COP (10/2018) and 1,500 COP if using reusable card. The best way would be to pay someone 2,000 COP so he swipes his card to let you in, then stop at a station and buy the MIO card. Reusable Card costs 3,500 COP. It seems you can swipe the same card several times, so you only need one card for your group. Stick to regular urbano buses where you ask the driver if he's going to your destination. The system continues construction of new lanes with the eventual goal of comprehensive coverage of the metropolitan area. Since not all MIO Bus stops have enclosed stations with ticket counters, if you arrive by Bus in Cali (terminal de transportes), it's best to go to MIO La Américas and get a reusable card straight ahead. [http://www.metrocali.gov.co/mio_index.htm]

* There are 23 urban transport companies to travel around the city. You may ask someone for a route as the local people are very eager to help. A regular trip costs 2,000 COP (10/2018).

[[Image:Ermita cali.jpg|thumb|250px|La Ermita church, downtown]]
[[Image:La Merced.JPG|thumb|250px|La Merced church, downtown]]
* '''Historic churches''', there are many historic Catholic churches that represent different Spanish Colonial architecture of a time gone past.  The city is over 450 years old, so architecture is one of the best things to see. 

* '''Museo del Oro del Banco de la República''', Calle 7 No. 4-69. A Museum containing archaeological exhibits of pottery and gold of pre-Columbian cultures which existed in the region. There is also a small art exhibition. The entrance is free and it's open Monday till Saturday.
 
* '''Museo Arqueologico La Merced''', located in the downtown, is a Colonial-type church, with an archaeological museum displaying pre-Hispanic exhibits and religious art from ancient cultures which inhabited the region in pre-Colombian times.

* '''Cristo Rey''', a statue located in the top of a hill, similar to Cristo de Corcovado in Rio de Janeiro, Brasil offers a great city view.  Climbing the mountain is great exercise.  Make sure you're not alone as its not a really safe place.

*'''Cerro de las Tres Cruces''', a hill embellished with three big crosses from which the whole city is visible makes an excellent morning hike, however, do so only on Sundays as there is generally a lot of military presence these days due to high number of hikers. 

*'''Iglesia de San Antonio''', colonial-type church at the top of a hill. Another great view of the downtown area. Be careful as this area can be risky after sunset.

*'''Barrio de San Antonio''', the Iglesia de San Antonio is located at the heart of this area. This place is popular because of its colonial architecture and it is located on top of a hill meaning that it is cooler up there and enables a view of the city of Cali from the top. On Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights  many people come to the area to watch performers, story tellers, people selling handicrafts and just chilling out with friends. It is a great place to stay and is filled with restaurants, hotels and hostels for travelers. Many Europeans and North Americans who teach at the bilingual schools and English institutions in Cali choose to live in this area. 

* '''Estatua de Belalcazar''', like its southern neighbour [[Popayan]], Cali was founded by the Spanish conquistador Sebastian de Belalcazar. There is a statue in Belalcazar's honor in a nice residential area of Cali, where you can look out over the whole city. It's ''much'' safer than Cristo Rey.

*'''Statue: El gato del rio''' is a famous statue of a giant cat that, along with the statue of Belalcazar, the Three Crosses, and Jesus, has become a symbol for the city.  It is situated across the Cali River from the barrio of El Peñon.

*'''Zoologico de Cali''', this is an excellent zoo with many animals from around the world. The premises are very well kept and, surprisingly, it is in an upscale side of town. The animals generally have lots of space for themselves.  Do not miss the Bengal tigers, the butterflies and the birds. Lonely Planet has called this South America´s best zoo.

*'''La Ermita''', a Gothic-style church located in the downtown area. It was built in 1678 and then renovated in 1930. 

*'''La Tertulia''' A museum of modern art with international exhibits and a movie theater that shows many award-winning, artistic, house films among other foreign language works.

* '''Culture''' Cali has many cultural offerings, like the ''Teatro Municipal Enrique Buenaventura'', ''Centro Cultural Comfandi'' or the ''Teatro Jorge Isaacs''.

==Do==

* '''Soccer Matches''': In the ''Estadio Olimpico Pascual Guerrero'' is the Host place of the local teams of the city, Deportivo Cali [http://www.deporcali.com/] and America de Cali [http://www.america.com.co/]. regularly each Sunday one of them plays a Match for the National Championship. Between the months of May-June and November-December they are in playoffs, so the matches are more exciting. It is recommended that tourists sit on the west side section, "Occidental", of the stadium. Under no circumstances should a tourist sit at the south side of the stadium as this is where the popular barras for both teams are located.

* '''Mountain Biking''': Excellent tracks there, get information at BTT de Colombia Bike store (yellow pages ask for Julio).

* '''Wind or Kite surfing''': The best place in South America with winds blowing virtually 365 days a year. Find information at [http://velasyvientos.net/].

* '''Salsa Dancing''': Cali is one of the most famous and popular places for salsa in the world. You can find people dancing in the streets and every single night find a club open for salsa dancing. While salsa can be heard pretty much anywhere and at any time of the day the most popular clubs are to be found in the Menga district (North of Cali) and Juanchito (East).
 
*'''La Loma De a Cruz''' This is a very beautiful and tourist place in Cali located in a small village called Los Libertadores.  The small village is seen through the entire city because is had a huge bright cross standing on the peek of a mountain.  There are many things to do here from attending church buying hand made jewelry from locals.  There also many small music festivals with tons of dancing. There also many mini food shops so you could pick at food while you walk around.

*'''El Parque De La Canya''' is the biggest waterpark located in Colombia, with also the biggest water ride in South America.  The water park is located in Barrio El Tronkal near the military base in Cali.  Tickets are very cheap, there approximately $22 dollars per person.  They have rides for adults as well, after 11 p.m the park turns into a club for adults only. Great amusement Park, must see.

* '''Salsa Learning''': There's a lot of salsa schools in Cali. You could do 2-3 group classes and do just fine in salsa clubs, as most caleños and tourists just dance whatever when they hear salsa music. For the serious student, a few notes: 1) Most people in Cali don't dance anything remotely close to the crazy steps you see on youtube videos. They just dance simple steps. 2) The most danced styles in the world are Cuban. To get the most out of salsa caleña, focus on the leading and following techniques as those can be transferred to other styles of salsa, instead of having a vast array of combos and steps. 3)Group classes will be useless to you. If you want to get good in salsa caleña in the short while you'll stay in Cali, private classes are the way to go. 4) Pick your school carefully. Some schools seem to focus on the mindless repetition of crazy steps, which frankly, you won't use that much on the dance floor.

* '''La 66''' - Is one of the most visited streets in Cali, it is also located in the South of Cali.  La 66 is a street full of clubs, bars, and restaurants that are open 24/7.  Music and partying never stops in this street. Great place  to attend when you have no plans.  Great places for young adults and older folks. Great food in every corner.

==Stay safe==

2016: Drive by robberies are frequent. A group of two or three motorcycles will pick a random passer by and surround her, pointing a gun at her and quickly emptying her pockets. The whole thing takes less than a minute. Apart from taking a taxi everywhere, there's not much you can do about it, because they operate on daytime and even on "safe" neighbourhoods too. Apart from common sense(which will minimize but *NOT* eliminate the risk of being robbed), empty your wallet of any unnecessary debit/credit cards, carry a photocopy of your passport instead of the original(If you have an ID card that can be easily replaced, it's even better), don't carry a lot of money. If you have an expensive phone, you might want to carry a cheap phone while in Cali. You could wear pants with hidden pockets, because the objective of this crime is to make a quick getaway, not to take a lot of stuff. That said, realize most tourists in Cali don't get robbed.

Don't hail taxis off the street. Instead, use uber or easy taxi or any service which registers where you take the taxi from, who the driver is, which cars, etc. You can also call a taxi at 032-4444444 (there are other numbers too I think). They'll give you the taxi number and a password you'll have to mention to the taxi driver. If you need to take a taxi off the street, call an acquaintance and tell them which taxi you're taking and how long you'll take to get there, as well as telling them that you'll call when you get to your destination.

If for any reason you need to go to a police station, realize most police stations are in somewhat sketchy neighbourhoods. Take the taxi there. 

In 2011 there have been a number of murders and car bombs related to the ongoing mafia war between drug cartels in the city. Shopping centers all over the city have been scenes of shoot outs between rivaling mafia factions. It is advised to avoid shopping centers with poor security, although some of the biggest and most well guarded malls in Cali have been scenes of murders too.[http://www.semana.com/nacion/chicago-criolla/157505-3.aspx]

Besides these isolated cases, this year the city started to experience a strengthening in its security compared to previous years; as a result, in 2008 the homicide rate in Cali was 66 per 100,000 inhabitants, in 2010 the rate was 80 per 100,000 inhabitants, and in 2011 this rate was reduced to 77 per 100,000 inhabitants. In 2011 the number of stolen cars dropped 21% with 323 fewer cases, burglaries were also reduced 17%, with 152 fewer cases. 

The city has increased its security by installing around 254 cameras. This system allows coverage of 30% of all the city, and its estimated that for 2013 the number of cameras is going to increase to 500. [http://www.eltiempo.com/colombia/cali/ARTICULO-WEB-NEW_NOTA_INTERIOR-11795494.html]

As of 2011 the guerrilla movement FARC-EP has urban militias in the city and surroundings. Extreme caution is advised due to the risk of explosions, gunfire and kidnappings.[http://colombiareports.com/colombia-news/news/13149-farc-return-to-classic-guerrilla-tactics.html][http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/judicial/articulo-237365-farc-multiplican-sus-ataques-y-retoman-guerra-de-guerrillas] U.S. citizens have been targets of kidnappings.[http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/tw/tw_941.html] 

In November 2010 the U.S. State Department issued a travel warning regarding Cali, warning of a surge in crime, general insecurity and kidnappings.[http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/tw/tw_941.html]

Cali is considered more dangerous than most other major cities in Colombia;[http://www.semana.com/noticias-nacion/policia-redistribuye-ante-aumento-criminalidad-ciudades/134418.aspx] therefore, keep your eyes open at day and night. Try to take a taxi at night.  

Avoid backstreet in the downtown (El Centro) and Sucre neighborhoods.  This area is especially dangerous.  Walking alone at night at Avenida Sexta can be unsafe.

As in most other cities, it is unwise to walk with jewelry or let people around you know you have cash on you. Most places around hotels are safe.

Try not to talk on cellphones while walking through streets; that might lure in robbers. Also do not use MP3 players or other valuables in public.

[[Image:FVL Clinica Cali.JPG|right|thumb|300px|Fundación Clínica Valle del Lili. Interior gardens]]

There is a great high tech hospital in town: '''Fundación Valle del Lili''' with many bilingual doctors. [http://www.valledellili.org]

==Get out==

* '[[Pance]]  (Is a town 25 minutes from the city) is a nice place to stay for about 20 dollars a night; also one of the best places for hiking, trekking and birdwatching in South America.  

* [[Calima Lake]]  (A 1.5 hour drive from the city) is a nice place to stay for about 30 dollars a night; also one of the best places for windsurfing in South America.  The town of Jamundi, about a half hour south of the city also has nice weekend homes for rent and some decent mountain hikes for those up for some time in the country.

* '''Buga''' A small city an hour north of Cali. Catholic pilgrims from all over Colombia and the world go to visit the Basilica which was the site of a miracle in 1500s. The city also has its own microbrewry and you can do some impressive hikes in to the Cauca Valley directly from there.

* The little hamlet of [[San Cipriano]] is a good day trip. Most people visit this place only for the ride to it, but it is also possible to stay overnight. Enjoy a swim in the various river beaches, or enjoy a tube ride down the river.

* [[Lake Calima]] ([http://www.calimadarien.com/eng_index.htm see Lake Calima's Tourist Guide]), 1,5 hour drive from Cali, is, due to it's year round wind, one of the best wind- & kite surf spots in Southern America. There are at least 3 windsurf schools around the lake. One of them is Pescao Windsurfing [http://www.pescaowindsurfing.com], run by windsurfing instructor Luis Fernando. They have excellent wind- and kite surfing gear for rent (prices: windsurf COP 55.000 - 70.000 for 2 hours; kite surf COP 60.000 per hour, COP 120.000 per day) and offer courses too (prices: windsurf COP 100.000 for 2 hours; kite surf COP 100.000 per hour). Overnight stay at the school costs COP 20.000 per night. To get to Pescao, take a bus from Buga or Cali to Darién, and ask the busdriver to drop you off at the school.

* City of Buga 1 hour drive. Visit "La Basilica", a major pilgrimage site in Colombia (Ask for Dulces del Valle best place for traditional Dulces).  Also, Buga is more tranquil and cleaner than Cali.  

* Parque del Cafe [http://www.parquenacionaldelcafe.com/].  Approx 3 hr drive from Cali ( approx 2 hrs from Buga, listed above).  This is an amusement park, and the Colombian Coffee Museum, complete with the history of Colombian coffee and Juan Valdez.  See the theatrical show there that explains the local culture celebrating coffee.  

* City of Jamundi half hour drive (ask for Cholados that Jamundi is famous for-a delicious mix of shaved ice and exotic fruit with rasberry and sweet condensed milk sauces and a wafer cookie. Often sold from vendors that have stands that display fruit and shaved ice.  There is a traffic circle roundabout near the city entrance with many Cholado stands)

* [[Popayan]] is about three hours away, and a nice place to stay for a couple of days. There are numerous bus companies available. The most reliable bus operators are '''Velotax''' (4am-10pm, every 30mins), '''Tax Belalcazar''' (5am-8pm, every 30mins) and '''Expreso Bolivariano''', these companies generally only stop a couple of times on route. Avoid Expreso Puerto Tejada and Expesos Palmira as they stop often and take much longer.

* [[Isla Gorgona]] is a remote Island in the pacific. The whole island is a national park, specially known for scuba diving expeditions because of the great diversity in fauna. There is a brand new fancy ECO hotel opened in 2009 [http://www.concesionesparquesnaturales.com/site/Ingles/Gorgona/Gorgona.html]. Reachable from Cali: Either via Buenaventura (2.5 hrs to the west by car) or regional flights available from Cali to Guapi. From any of these towns you need to take a boat to the island.

* Watch '''humpback whales''': around 1,200 humpback whales are expected to arrive every June - July in the Pacific ocean waters of [[Isla Gorgona]], Sanquianga and Utria National Parks. With the whales come dozens of tourists every year to watch them mating. The whales spend the summer months feeding in polar waters and head to tropical waters in winter for mating and calving, sometimes traveling up to 17,000 kilometers. They are black, grey and white, can grow up to 18 meters long and weigh up to 40 tons. [http://colombiareports.com/travel-in-colombia/105-news/4382-whales-arrive-off-colombias-pacific-coast.html]
