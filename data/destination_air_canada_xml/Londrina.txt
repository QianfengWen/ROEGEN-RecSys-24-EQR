'''Londrina''' is a large city in [[Paraná]], southern [[Brazil]]. It is a wealthy center of a coffee-producing region. It could be a stopover to or from [[Foz do Iguaçu]].

==Get in==
* Airport with daily flights to [[Curitiba]], [[Sao Paulo]], [[Campinas]], and others.
* Good long distance bus connections.

==Get around==
'''City buses''' can be a challenge. They are more frequent during office hours, specially close to the University hours, so it's very likely that they will be crowded with students. Any other time, you'll probably wait very long for your bus, as sometimes they can take longer than an hour to come. Transporte Coletivo Grande Londrina (TCGL)'s website (http://www.tcgrandelondrina.com.br/) has bus lines and time tables, though it's not easy to find your way around it, either.

'''Taxis''' are frequent and to be found everywhere. However, Londrina's traffic sometimes won't help you, and you'll find red light after red light. Be prepared to pay R$ 15 to R$ 20 for short distances.
