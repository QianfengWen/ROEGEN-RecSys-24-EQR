'''Laramie''' [http://www.laramie.org/] is a city in [[Southeast Wyoming]]. It is home to the '''University of Wyoming''' [http://www.uwyo.edu/].  

==Understand==
Laramie is located at very high altitude (7,200+ ft) and due to this has considerably milder summers and more fierce winters than other US cities of comparable latitude in the upper Midwest.  This also means that the climate around Laramie is very dry most of the year so travelers here should take care to drink lots of fluid and not over exert themselves immediately upon arrival to mitigate potential altitude sickness risks.

==Get in==
===By Car===
The primary access to Laramie is along US Interstate 80, the main east west corridor in the state.  Because of the altitude and northern location, it is important to be aware of road conditions and road closures along all roads but especially I-80 as its closure can strand you.  Road conditions are available on the internet at several sources including this one: [http://www.wyoroad.info/highway/webcameras/webcameras.html]

In the summer months the town is also easily accessible on a smaller road (US 287) that comes up from Fort Collins, Colorado.
