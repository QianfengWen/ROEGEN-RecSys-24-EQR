==About==

'''Tampico''' is a city and important port in the mexican state of [[Tamaulipas]], located on the southernmost part of it, precisely in the [[Huasteca]] region. With a population of over 950,000 inhabitants in its metropolitan region, Greater Tampico is the most important metro region in the state and one of the most important economic and cultural hubs in the Gulf of Mexico.

Possessing a tropical climate and being surrounded by several rivers, lagoons, wetlands and the Gulf of Mexico, Tampico has a very varied wildlife coexisting with the growing city.

==Get in==
Tampico is served by '''General Francisco Javier Mina International Airport (TAM)''' [http://www.oma.aero/en/]. There is one flight per day to/from [[Houston]] via United Airlines, and several others via [[Monterrey]], [[Guadalajara]], [[Queretaro]], [[Veracruz]] or [[Mexico City]].

Terminal Central de Autobuses de Tampico is the main bus terminal for the city and has several bus lines serving it.

Alternately, Tampico is located a six-hour drive or bus ride from the Mexican border with either [[McAllen]] or [[Brownsville]], [[Texas]], as well as a two to four-hour drive or bus ride to the most iconic places of the Huasteca Potosina.

==Get around==
Driving is the easiest way to travel around Tampico. Speed limits and red lights are enforced - other laws tend to be rather lax.

Taxis are relatively safe to take in and around Tampico at any time of day or night, but as always, use caution when traveling alone. Alternatively, you can take an uber, which will get you anywhere except the beach for less than three dollars. 

City buses and shared cars on a set route are very frequent, but it may be hard to get hand on their routes. Ask locals for advice. Both the buses and shared cars cost 9 pesos (March 2022). Cars to the beach pass every one or two minutes. Look out for a car that has written La Playa on it. It takes about 20 minutes to Playa Miramar, passing through the centre of Ciudad Madero.
