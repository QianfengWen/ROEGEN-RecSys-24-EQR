'''Kristiansund''' [http://www.visitkristiansund.com] is a city and municipality on the mid-western coast of [[Norway]], located in [[Møre og Romsdal]] county. It is arguably the city with the most special and interesting architecture of Norway, which originates from the aftermath of World War Two, when nearly 80% of the city was demolished by bombs. Situated on five islands slightly off the shore of main-land Norway. The natural harbour formed by the islands is considered to be very unique and particularly beautiful, protecting the city centre from winds and weather outside in the Atlantic Ocean. 

==Understand==
===Name and history===
It is believed that some of the very first Norwegians settled in what is now Kristiansund as the area was ice-free in the wake of the last ice age. Kristiansund gained some importance in the 17th century as a customs station for freight on its way to Trondheim. This resulted in a small settlement named ''Lille-Fosen'' in which now is Kristiansund. By the end of the 17th century, Dutch sailors brought the knowledge of clipfish production to the area which resulted in Kristiansund being Norway's largest exporter of clipfish for a number of years, mostly serving markets in the Mediterranean region. This sparked economic growth to the settlement which was awarded town status in 1742 and named ''Christianssund'' ("Christian's strait") after the Dano-Norwegian king Christian VI. The town's name was later modified to Kristiansund to reflect Norwegian language standards rather than Danish. 

===Geography===
[[Image:Kristiansund Map.jpg|thumb|print=lead|upright=1.7|Kristiansund's islands.]]
Kristiansund is built on four main islands (known as "lands" by the locals), namely ''Nordlandet'', ''Innlandet'', ''Kirkelandet''/''Gomalandet'' and ''Frei'' that are connected by a series of bridges. The city center is located at Kirkelandet and the surrounding islands form a natural harbor protecting it from the harsh whether conditions of the Norwegian Sea. Additionally, Kristiansund encompasses a number of smaller islets, most notably Grip; a deserted fishing village now popular as a summer tourist destination due to its location out in the open sea and distinctive architecture.

Kristiansund is very densely populated; especially on the islands of Nordlandet, Innlandet and Kirkelandet/Gomalandet. The relatively small size of these islands and the constricted harbor has resulted in Kristiansund having what is arguably Norway's most urban small city center.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen Climate Classification, Kristiansund has a maritime, temperate climate with cool to warm summers and relatively mild winters. The sheltered harbor and the city's maritime location moderate the year-round temperatures. The summers are therefore on average cooler than farther inland and the winters are much milder – snow on the ground rarely lasts more than a couple of days at a time in winter. The weather is however very varied and unpredictable and Kristiansund often experiences "four seasons in one day" throughout the year.  

==Get in==
===By plane===
'''Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget''' [http://www.avinor.no/lufthavn/kristiansund] ({{IATA|KSU}}) ({{ICAO|ENKB}}) is located 6 km east of the city centre. It is served by daily flights to and from Oslo (Scandinavian Airlines [http://www.flysas.com]), Bergen, Stavanger, Trondheim, Florø and Kristiansand (Widerøe [http://www.wideroe.no]). Taxi to and from the city center is approximately NOK 150–200 and the airport is served by city buses every half hour. Avis, Europcar, Hertz and Sixt have rental car locations at the airport.

===By car===
'''European Route E39''' conects Kristiansund with mainland Norway through the KRIFAST bridge and tunnel system. '''Route 70''' leads all the way into the city centre. Atlanterhavstunnelen (''The Atlantic Ocean Tunnel'') is an underwater tunnel on '''Route 64''' linking the city of Kristiansund with the island of [[Averøy]], and the popular tourist attraction of Atlanterhavsveien.

===By bus===
TimEkspressen [http://www.nettbuss.no/ekspressbuss/timekspressen] has departures for [[Molde]] and [[Ålesund]] every hour. Nettbuss Møre [http://www.nettbuss.no/rutetilbud/lokalbuss/more-og-romsdal] has schedules to [[Oppdal]] and [[Trondheim]] numerous times a day.

===By boat===
Kristiansund is port of call for [[Hurtigruten]], between [[Molde]] (4 hours) and [[Trondheim]] (6,5 hours) on the coastal cruise from [[Bergen]] to [[Kirkenes]]. There is also a three times a day catamaran passenger boat-service [http://kystekspressen.no/] to [[Trondheim]] (3.5 hours), with a few stops along the coast.

==Get around==
The city center of Kristiansund is easily navigable by foot and bridges to the surrounding islands all have sidewalks separated from the car traffic. 
 
Fram [http://www.frammr.no/] maintains a system of city buses fanning out from Kristiansund trafikkterminal (the main bus terminal) to different parts and suburbs of the city. Prices vary depending on a zone system [http://www.frammr.no/Billettar/sonekart], and a regular one-way fare is in the range of NOK 33–63. Discounts are available for children, students and seniors.

The four main islands are also connected by Sundbåten [http://www.sundbaten.no/]; a small passenger ferry that zips across the harbor. Established in 1876, it claims to be the world's oldest motorized regular public transport system in continuous service. Single tickets are NOK 35, day passes NOK 90. Discounts are available for children. Summer cruises and charter services are offered during the summer.

During the summer months there is a regular boat service to the island of Grip by Visit Kristiansund [http://www.visitkristiansund.com/en/].

==Drink==
There is a broad array of bars and nightclubs available in Kristiansund. Opening hours vary depending on day and venue but on weekends (Friday and Saturday) most bars and nightclubs close at 2:30 AM. Nightclubs tend to open relatively late (10–11 PM) while bars run on longer hours (some open early afternoon).

Norway maintains two legal drinking ages (18 for alcoholic beverages up to 19.9% ABV and 20 for 20% ABV and higher). Bars and nightclubs therefore tend to require guests to be at least 20 years of age to enter, thus avoiding checking the age of every individual when purchasing drinks. Some venues allow those between 18 and 20 to enter certain times of the day or certain days of the week (during which time IDs are checked upon purchase). Others have secluded areas where alcoholic beverages stronger than 19.9% ABV aren't served. Be prepared to document your age at the doormen before being allowed to enter any bar or nightclub. Regulations relating to the consumption of alcoholic beverages are very strict throughout Norway and strongly enforced. A valid proof of age should be government issued, like a drivers license, national ID card, debit/credit card with photo and date of birth imprinted, passport or equivalent. 

'''It is strongly discouraged''' to attempt gaining entry to bars and nightclubs using a fake ID. If caught, using someone else's ID will most likely result in a hefty fine. Those caught modifying one's own ID in order to appear old enough to enter run the risk of being charged with forging a government issued document; a serious crime under Norwegian law.

==Get out==
*'''[[Aure]]''' is a typical coastal municipality of Møre og Romsdal with many beautiful small islands. Most people live near the shore. Aure merged with Tustna in 2006 and the new municipality is called Aure. Population 3.600.

Aure’s coastline is almost 300 kilometres long. Unique possibilities for angling from the shore and from the many bridges and sounds. Fishing from boats for herring, mackerel, saithe, cod and pollock. Great hunting for red deer in the large forest and mountain areas. Excellent fishing for freshwater trout and sea trout. The scenery on Tustna is dominated by the coastal mountains. These over 900-metre-tall mountains, which rise straight up from the shore, form a chain in a north-south direction. Great walking, with several paths ascending to the summits, which offer fantastic views of the ocean and the fjords. 
* '''Grip''' is an archipelago located southwest of Kristiansund, and was until 1964 the smallest municipality of Norway. Today it is a deserted fishing village, but is a popular tourist attraction for the special architecture and unique location. Norway's smallest stave church, which was constructed in the end of the 15th century is also located at Grip. In the summer season there is a scheduled boat service from right next to the bus terminal of Kristiansund.
