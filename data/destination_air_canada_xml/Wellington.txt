[http://www.wcc.govt.nz '''Wellington'''] ('''Te Whanganui a Tara''' in [[Maori phrasebook|Māori]]) is the capital and second largest city of [[New Zealand]].  It is located at the south-western tip of the North Island, between Cook Strait and the Rimutaka Range.  The '''Windy City''' is built on the foreshore of Wellington Harbour and ringed by mountains, providing the scenic home of many of New Zealand's national arts and cultural attractions.

==Understand==
Wellington offers a blend of culture, heritage, fine food, and lively arts and entertainment. Surrounded by hills and a rugged coastline, the city boasts a stunning harbour. Wellington’s charm is that it serves up a vibrant inner city experience with a slice of New Zealand scenery. And because of its compact nature, you can sample it all: boutiques, art galleries, trendy cafés and restaurants. Right on its doorstep is a network of walking and biking trails with beautiful wineries and vineyards just a few hours away. Wellington has an array of theatre, music, dance, fine arts and galleries and museums, and is home to one of the nation’s key attractions, the Museum of New Zealand ''Te Papa Tongarewa''. 

Wellington is known for its film tourism. It is the heart of New Zealand's film industry and main filming and production centres for films such as the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies, Avatar, Tin Tin and District 9.

The city promotes itself as "Absolutely Positively Wellington". Its motto "''Suprema a situ''" claims site supremacy, with some justification. 

Because it is the capital city, Parliament and the head offices of many Government departments and large businesses occupy central Wellington. This is especially true in the areas closest to Parliament Buildings - the northern end of The Terrace and Lambton Quay areas and the Thorndon commercial area.

===Geology===
[[File:Wellington.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|Wellington from Mount Victoria]]
Much of the central city is built on reclaimed land that was raised up after a major earthquake in 1855. More land has been reclaimed since then. The shoreline as it was in 1840 is marked by plaques in the footpaths on Lambton Quay (hence the street name). There are several Quays which are now nowhere near the harbour. The harbour's former name was 'Port Nicholson' and the smaller bay surrounded by the city is called 'Wellington' or 'Lambton Harbour'.

''Earthquakes'' have played a major part in forming the whole Wellington region, the exposed face of the Wellington fault being prominent as the line of hills adjacent to the harbour between Thorndon and Petone. There are several major earthquake faults in the region, some of which slip a metre or more in one jump every few centuries. Building regulations have meant that many older city buildings have been either demolished or strengthened, or require such work to be undertaken. Small and moderate earthquakes occasionally rock Wellington; so if the earth seems to move for you, it may not be just your imagination. Take shelter from potentially falling objects wherever you are - beneath door frames or heavy tables.

There are some places in Wellington where damage from the 1855 earthquake is still visible. The most accessible is a large landslip on SH2 between Ngauranga and Korokoro (just north of Rocky Point where the BP petrol station is located) where the dramatic change in terrain is visible. Bush has overgrown the slip but it is still visible. However, most people are oblivious to the location of this landslip as they drive by on the highway.

===Climate===
Wellington is known as the ''Windy City''.  The prevailing wind is from the northwest but the strongest winds are southerly. The wind speed and direction can be seen by the flag being flown from ''the Beehive''. A large flag is flown only on calm days, a small flag is flown when windy days are expected.

The temperature in Wellington rarely drops below 0°C (32°F), even on a cold winter's night, while daytime winter temperatures are rarely lower than 8°C (46°F). During summer, the daytime maximum temperature rarely gets above 25°C (77°F). Away from the seaside, in inland valleys, frosts of up to -10°C (14°F) have been recorded and snow settles on the nearby ranges in winter.

===Geography===
Wellington sits at the southern tip of the North Island.  The city core lies along the western shore of highly-protected Wellington Harbour, with the city's suburbs spreading out in all directions.  The city's primary urban core consists of the CBD and the adjoining 'city suburb' of Te Aro, to the south and east. A fairly dense zone continues south from Te Aro into the adjoining suburbs of Mt. Cook and Newtown, as well as Kilbirnie on the other side of the parklands of Mt. Victoria. East from Te Aro, north-south ridges form Mt Victoria and, further east yet, the Miramar Peninsula, which forms the western side of the mouth to Wellington Harbour.  These hills&mdash;and the isthmus between&mdash;are home to a number of suburban areas as well as parkland and beaches.

Several kilometres south of central Wellington is the rugged and stunning ''South Coast'' of the North Island, consisting of a string of small (and some large) bays, many with rocky beaches and interesting tide pools. To the west, the suburbs between Karori and Johnsonville spread into the hillsides, with various parks and hiking trails, and then give way to open rural areas such as Makara. To the north are the cities of Lower Hutt, Upper Hutt and Porirua, predominantly dormitory suburbs of Wellington, but geographically separate.  

The harbour is the jewel of the city, on a bright calm day it is stunning from any vantage point.  The harbour is almost a perfect circle with the city on the south western edge, Petone on the northern side and Eastbourne, a small seaside village, on the south eastern side and accessible by ferry from the city centre.

==Get in==

===By plane===
'''Wellington International Airport''' [http://www.wellington-airport.co.nz/] is in Rongotai, about 5 km (3 mi) from the central city.  It sits on an isthmus between the Miramar peninsula and Mount Victoria.  The southerly approach is over Cook Strait, while the northerly approach is over the harbor.

Wellington airport is a major transit point for domestic travellers. There are frequent flights to [[Auckland]], [[Christchurch]], [[Palmerston North]], [[Rotorua]], [[Hamilton (New Zealand)|Hamilton]], [[Nelson (New Zealand)|Nelson]], [[Blenheim (New Zealand)|Blenheim]] and many other destinations.  International flights from [[Australia]] ([[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]], [[Gold Coast]]) arrive about twice daily: the evening flights arrive after midnight when most facilities are closed. There are also flights from Wellington to Fiji. 

'''Airlines flying to Wellington'''

'''Air Chathams''' - Connecting Chatham Islands to the mainland

'''Air New Zealand''' - Extensive domestic network using Wellington as one of its hubs for domestic travel. Offers numerous services to small towns across the country as well as an abundance of flights to large cities such as Auckland and Christchurch. A small number of daily international flights to Melbourne, Sydney and Nadi too

'''Fiji Airways''' - Connecting Wellington and Nadi a few times a week

'''Golden Bay Air''' - Services to Takaka

'''Jetstar''' - Numerous daily services to various domestic NZ destinations as well the Gold Coast (near Brisbane)

'''Qantas''' - Daily services to Melbourne and Sydney

'''Sounds Air''' - Offering regional flights across the upper South Island as well as to Taupo

'''Virgin Australia''' - Daily services to Brisbane

Landing at Wellington Airport in a strong cross-wind can be an adventure, and most pilots adopt a powered approach for approach, followed by a full reverse thrust and hard braked landing due to the shortness of the runway. This tends to create a roller-coaster ride, so make sure your seatbelt is securely fastened, as is required anyway.
 
Shuttle van services, taxis and covered carparking are directly outside the terminal.
When you get to the airport, call the Metlink hotline at 0800 801700.  They answer very quickly and a friendly person will tell you what bus to take and even what special pass to buy if you say where you are going.

===By road===
There are only two major roads into the Wellington metropolitan: State Highways 1 & 2.  


'''State Highway 1 (North-west bound from CBD)''' 
connects the CBD to the suburbs and other cities within the metropolitan such as '''Johnsonville, Tawa, Porirua, Paremata, Paraparaumu, Waikanae''' and '''Otaki''' '''State Highway 1''' continues north connecting Wellington to the cities of '''Palmerston North, Taupo, Hamilton''' and '''Auckland''' with connections on route to other state highways.

'''State Highway 2 (North-east bound from CBD)''' 
connects the CBD with the suburbs and other cities in the metropolitan such as '''Lower Hutt''' and '''Upper Hutt''' then over the Rimutaka Ranges to the Wairarapa (part of the Greater Wellington region).  

Both highways are initially a motorway, but after approx 20 km (12 mi) turn into single lane highway as they negotiate difficult terrain. While local authorities are working on improvements, serious and fatal crashes are not uncommon on these roads: remember to keep left, maintain a reasonable speed, and use the passing lanes to overtake slower traffic.

Drivers using the Rimutaka Hill road must be alert to extreme wind and weather, especially in winter.  The road can close several times a year due to snowfall near the summit.  The descent down the Wairarapa side needs special care as there are many sharp corners and the road is quite narrow in places.  

Hitchhiking from central Wellington is difficult as most traffic stays within the metropolitan area, and it is illegal to hitchhike on the motorway until the Hutt Valley (about 15 km/9 mi northeast of Wellington) or Paremata (about 20 km/12 mi north). If intending to hitchhike, you are best to catch a train to Waikanae or Upper Hutt and walk to the main highways to catch a lift from there.  Using a sign will help in matching a willing driver and destination.

Be aware that a few hitchhikers, including tourists, have been attacked or murdered in New Zealand. While usually no problems occur, always be aware, and try to travel in pairs to reduce your risk.

===By train===
There is a train service between Wellington and Auckland. There are daily commuter services from [[Palmerston North]] and [[Masterton]] and a generally half-hourly suburban commuter service to Johnsonville, the [[Hutt Valley]], [[Porirua]], and [[Waikanae]] on the [[Kapiti Coast]].

===By bus===
InterCity [http://intercity.co.nz] operates bus services to Wellington from across the North Island. Daily services operate between Auckland, [[New Plymouth]], [[Napier]], [[Hastings (New Zealand)|Hastings]] and Palmerston North, as well as overnight services between Auckland and Wellington. All InterCity Wellington bus services depart and arrive at Platform 9 at the Wellington Railway Station.

===By sea===
There are regular ferries between Wellington and [[Picton (New Zealand)|Picton]], connecting with buses and the train to Christchurch. The '''Bluebridge Ferry Terminal''' is located adjacent to the Wellington Railway Station (next to the BNZ Harbour Quays building).  The '''Interislander ferry terminal''' is located about 2 km (1 mi) northeast of the railway station, and a $2 shuttle bus runs between the Interislander Ferry Terminal and the railway station (bus terminal next to Platform 9).

Cruise ships from overseas often call on Wellington[http://www.wellingtonnz.com/discover/travel/visit-by-cruise-ship/].  If you are arriving on a large cruise ship, you will dock at '''Aotea Quay''', located beside Sky Stadium in between the Interislander Ferry Terminal and the railway station. At the Wellington Cruise Terminal[http://www.centreport.co.nz/cruise-information], you may chat with Wellington City Ambassadors and pick up maps and brochures for your visit to the capital. Computers, phones, a post box and metered taxis are all available at the terminal.  From there, you might take a shuttle if offered by your ship, or catch a shuttle operated by the city, which costs around $5.  Due to this port being busy and industrial, it is recommended that you taxi or shuttle into the city rather than walk.  If you do choose to walk, just follow the yellow lines outside the terminal; a walk to the railway station is about 10 minutes, along an industrial area, and to the city centre 20 minutes.  Smaller cruise ships dock conveniently at '''Queens Wharf''', which is right in the middle of the beautiful downtown waterfront.

==Get around==
It is easy to get around the central city on foot, as is very compact and pedestrian-friendly. In addition, New Zealand's best public transit network with buses, commuter trains, and suburban ferries is available to take you farther afield.

* <listing name="Metlink" alt="Greater Wellington Regional Council - Transport" directions="" address="" phone="0800 801 700" email="" fax="" url="http://www.metlink.org.nz/" hours="" price="">Provides full information about routes and fares about Wellington's public transport. Metlink also provides a text bus service - Text the bus-stop number to ''bus'' (287) from any NZ mobile phone to receive the times the next bus is timetabled to arrive. </listing>.

===By foot===
The core of Wellington is notably compact and vibrant, and is well-suited to exploration by walking.  As dictated by geography, the core of the city is quite linear, with the classic commercial backbone known as the '''Golden Mile''' making for a diverting and pleasant walking route.  This route runs from the Railway Station down '''Lambton Quay''' to its southern end at '''Willis Street'''.  It then runs down lower Willis Street to '''Manners Street''' and the pedestrianized '''Manners Mall''', and continues straight onto '''Courtenay Place'''.  On the Manners Mall section, the route crosses Wellington's bohemian heartland of '''Cuba Street''', which heads south into the core of '''Te Aro'''.  While these streets mark the traditional core of the commercial city, the surrounding blocks also have plenty to be seen.

Another enjoyable and popular place to amble in the city core is the '''Waterfront''', from the revitalized '''Kumutoto''' area in the north, past '''Queen's Wharf''' to '''Frank Kitts Park''', and then through the '''Lagoon''' and '''City-to-Sea Bridge''' areas and on to the '''Te Papa''' museum and '''Waitangi Park'''.  From here the waterfront curves northeastward along lovely '''Oriental Bay''' with its beach and promenade.

===By bus===
Wellington city itself has an extensive network of buses.

==== Network overview ====
Excellent and free network maps and route timetables and maps are available from locations throughout town, including the main visitor centre in Civic Square, the Central Library, and many convenience stores. You can also access the timetables and maps online [http://www.metlink.org.nz/]. While these maps can be quite useful if you desire to travel into the suburbs, they aren't generally necessary if you simply want to travel across the central city.  Being a rather linear city, the heart of Wellington is heavily served by the central bus corridor between the Railway Station and Courtenay Place.  Nearly all lines run along this section, so you rarely have to wait more than a few minutes to catch a ride.  The route is approximately as follows:

===== Southbound =====
* Out of the Railway Station bus terminal onto '''Lambton Quay'''.
* Lambton Quay to '''Willis Street'''.
* Willis Street to '''Mercer Street''', where the route zig-zags by '''Civic Square''' and onto '''Cuba Street'''.
* Cuba Street to '''Manners Street''', continuing straight to '''Courtenay Place'''.

===== Northbound =====
* From '''Courtenay Place''' straight onto '''Dixon Street'''
* From Dixon Street zig-zags to '''Manners Street'''
* Manners Street to '''Willis Street'''
* Willis Street to '''Lambton Quay''' to the Railway Station.

====Fares====
You can always call the friendly hotline at 0800 801700 and they will tell you what buses to take and how much it will cost.
Bus fares use a zone structure.  While the metropolitan area includes many zones, nearly the entire city of Wellington (extending to the water's edge in the south, east, and west, and as far north as Johnsonville) exists within three zones. In addition, the core of the network between the Railway Station and Courtenay Place serves as a special fare zone.  

If you plan to use the bus extensively, you can also buy an all-day central bus pass which allows unlimited trips after 9AM on weekdays within zones 1 through 3. Check Metlink's website for current pricing.

In addition, electronic ''Snapper'' fare cards are available from most supermarkets and convenience stores, which provide approximately 25% discount off adult fares on Metlink buses. These cards can be topped up electronically using a compatible Android or iOS device with the Snapper app, or at various agencies for a small fee. However, you need to remember to tag not only when you board the bus but also as you leave the bus, or you will be charged for the whole route.

===By cable car===
[[image:WellingtonPanorama.jpg|frame|Panorama of Wellington]]
The Kelburn cable car is a Wellington icon. It provides a regular service between Lambton Quay and Kelburn. The Wellington city terminal is at the end of '''Cable Car Lane''', just off Lambton Quay, near the intersection with Grey Street. The Kelburn terminal is at the end of Upland Road by an entrance to the Botanic Gardens. One way fares on the cable car range from $3 for children and $6 for adults. The cable car operates every 10 minutes and usually between 7am and 9pm, 7 days a week (though times may vary during weekends and public holidays). The Cable Car also makes stops at Clifton Terrace, Talvera Terrace and Salamanca Road (Victoria University)

===By boat===
The Eastbourne ferry service, which provides regular services between '''Queens Wharf''' and '''Days Bay''' in Eastbourne, also stops at '''Somes Island''' most trips. There are also limited ferry services to Seatoun and Petone during both weekdays and weekends

===By train===
The train is the best form of public transport between the central city and '''Johnsonville''', as well as the Hutt Valley, Porirua or the Kapiti Coast - although you do have to walk from Melling or Western Hutt, or catch a bus from Petone or Waterloo (''Hutt Central'') stations to central Lower Hutt's CBD. 

At Wellington station the destination and departure time of the next train departing from each platform is displayed on the message board at the entry to each platform. Two announcements are made a few minutes before each train is due to depart. Tickets can be bought at the Wellington station ticket office or suburban ticket agents. Since most smaller stations do not have ticket offices, you can also buy single journey tickets, and day passes, with cash, from the conductor on the train, after you board and often once the train is moving. Monthly passes do need to be purchased from a station ticket office or suburban ticket agents in advance.

The easiest way to travel between the Hutt Valley and Porirua is by train via Wellington (it is no cheaper to change at Kaiwharawhara, not all services will stop there and the timetables mean there is generally no time-saving). Trains run every half hour on the Hutt Valley and Porirua lines, and more frequently during peak hour. Services generally run every half hour on saturdays and sundays.

A ''Day Rover'' pass allows unlimited trips on any of the four commuter lines on the same day (from first off-peak service departing after 9AM weekdays and all day Saturday and Sunday). This can often work out cheaper than buying separate tickets if you need to make two or more journeys. A ''3 Day Weekend Rover'' pass is available for train travel from 4:30AM Friday to midnight Sunday. If you have a group of people, a ''Group Rover'' pass allows up to 4 people to travel together on the same conditions as a ''Day Rover''.

===By taxi===
As in all New Zealand cities, taxi rates vary according to the company. There is a "flagfall" charge, then a per kilometer charge once the cab starts moving. Extra fees apply for things like airport pickup, phone booking, electronic payment etc. Major taxi companies in Wellington include (alphabetically) Combined, Corporate, Green and Kiwi. There are many alternate taxi companies and taxis are usually in plentiful supply.

Check the door of the taxi before you get in for the current approved fare rates. Wellington taxi charges are high on international comparisons.

===By car===
As noted above, driving in the core of Wellington is generally not necessary or as convenient as walking.  However, it is not particularly difficult once you learn the one-way system, nor is traffic a big worry outside of normal rush-hour periods.

Street and garage/surface lot '''parking''' is not particularly difficult for a city of Wellington's density, but as with any city you may have to search a bit for a street spot.  Street parking is generally metered in the centre at a rate of $4.5/hour for weekdays, and $2.5/hour on weekends (between 8am and 6pm Mon - Thu and 8am - 8pm Fri), often with a one or two hour time limit.  Multi Storey car parks tend to be similarly priced, but you can generally stay for longer periods.

Street parking can be paid from a mobile phone with the PayMyPark app.

In the suburbs immediately surrounding the city, '''coupon parking''' zones exist in conjunction with Resident Only parking.  In the Coupon Zones, two hours of parking are free.  Beyond that you must display a coupon to allow you to park for the entire day.  These are available at convenience stores for $7.50 each.  Enforcement of the Coupon Zones is from 8AM to 6PM. Resident Zones are generally reserved for Residents (displaying a current permit) at all times, and you may be served with a ticket for parking there without a permit.

==See==
*'''Te Papa''', [http://www.tepapa.govt.nz/]. The national museum.  Particularly good if you have children to entertain on a rainy day. Free (except for the occasional special presentation). 
*'''Museum of Wellington City & Sea''', Queens Wharf, [http://www.museumofwellington.co.nz/]. Daily, 10AM-5PM, closed 25 Dec. A well-presented museum of the history of Wellington, including its maritime history. Free.
* '''City Gallery''', Civic Square. Lacks a permanent collection but runs a consistently avant-garde set of exhibits. It also has the excellent cafe '''Nikau''' attached to it.
*'''The Wellington Cable Car''', from Lambton Quay (next to the McDonald's), 04 472 2199, [http://www.wellingtonnz.com/cablecar/]. Daily until 10PM. The easiest way to get a nice view of the city and harbor, the Cable Car runs on rails from Lambton Quay to the Botanic Garden in Kelburn every ten minutes. $6 one way, $11.00 return (Concession prices are available for children, students and senior citizens over 65)
*'''Frank Kitts Park'''. A great place to wander around, with walls to climb, inline skates, and jet ski rental.
*'''Futuna Chapel'''. Important architecture modernist masterpiece located in suburb of Karori. Visit by arrangement [http://www.futunatrust.org.nz]
*'''Lookout points''' - Wellington City is surrounded by hills, so there are a number of good vantage points:
**'''Mount Victoria'''. (196 metres) The best lookout in Wellington. The full 360-degree view is a great place to see the the airport, the harbour, the CBD and the Town Belt with just a turn of the head. It takes about an hour to walk up from Courtenay Place. Many tourist buses go there but also a lot of the locals, especially at night to 'watch the view'.
**'''Mount Kaukau'''. (445 metres) Another great lookout point, not as close to the city as Mt Victoria [http://www.ivebeenthere.co.uk/tips/15405].
**'''Wrights Hill'''. More views, and WWII underground tunnels which are open to the public on public holidays for a small fee.
**'''Brooklyn Wind Turbine'''. Another great place to go to get an excellent view of the city, the harbour, and Cook Strait, plus experience the wind! Access is signposted from Brooklyn shops: head up Todman Street.
**'''Massey Memorial''' An interesting place to go if you want to see a large memorial in the middle of nowhere, with a good view of the surrounding harbour.
*'''Karori Cemetery''' is an interesting picnic spot.
*'''Elmscourt''' an historic art deco apartment block on the corner of The Terrace and Abel Smith Street.
*'''Oriental Parade'''. A new beach. However if you are not from somewhere really cold it is unlikely that it will be hot enough for you to be in desperate need for a swim. There is a spa pool (jacuzzi) in Freyberg Swimming pool (on Oriental Parade) which is inexpensive if you enjoy "people soup".
*'''Zealandia (Karori Wildlife Sanctuary)''', end of Waiapu Rd, (''first left after the Karori Tunnel''), [http://www.visitzealandia.com/]. Daily 10AM-5PM (last entry 4PM), closed 25 Dec. A predator-proof fence encloses an old water catchment area, forming a ''mainland island'' that provides a natural haven for endangered native birds, tuatara, wētā, and other indigenous flora and fauna, safe from introduced predators. By far the most convenient place in the country to see rare New Zealand wildlife. Adults $24, children $10, under 5's free, more for guided tours.
*'''Plimmer's Ark'''. Under and in the ''Old Bank Arcade'' on the corner of Lambton Quay and Customhouse Quay - near Plimmer's Steps.  A hundred years ago a Bank was built on top of a wrecked ship that had been used as a market.  When they renovated the building they discovered the ship's timbers and preserved the remains in the building! Just take the escalator down through the bank vault doors.
*'''Parliament Buildings''', the '''Beehive''' (or ''Executive Wing''), and the '''Parliamentary Library'''. The '''grounds''' of Parliament are open to the public. At the foot of Molesworth and Bowen Streets, where they meet Lambton Quay. 
*'''National Library of New Zealand''', corner of Aitken and Molesworth Streets (''across the road from the Cathedral and Parliament''), [http://www.natlib.govt.nz/]. The library regularly holds exhibitions. 
*'''Turnbull House''' (''closed due to earthquake risk''), Bowen Street (''just across the road from Parliament Buildings''). This imposing brick mansion now seems small and out of place amongst the surrounding high-rises.
*[[Image:Govt_buildings_wellington.jpg|thumb|The Old Government Buildings, with the cenotaph in the foreground and NZ Post headquarters behind.]]'''Old Government Buildings''' opposite Parliament at 15 Lambton Quay. This is the largest wooden building in the southern hemisphere and the second-largest in the world. It is now the home of Victoria University Law School.
*'''Old St Paul's''', (''one block east of Parliament''). This was the Anglican center for decades. Superseded by the new cathedral north of Parliament, this one is popular for weddings and funerals.
*'''Statues''' and '''sculptures''' appear in some intriguing places around town.  Famous prime ministers, memorials, and works of art have all been erected in the streets of Wellington, including:
**Memorial statues to two prime ministers in the grounds of Parliament as well as a bicentennial memorial to Captain Cook's 1769 discovery of New Zealand.
**The '''Cenotaph''' on the corner of Lambton Quay and Bowen Street, just outside the Parliament Grounds, is where a Dawn Memorial Service is held every ANZAC Day (25 Apr).
**Behind Parliament, on the corner of Museum and Bowen Streets, is a small park with 3 sculptures in block. 
**On the corner of Lambton Quay and Stout Street, the '''fallen column''' has not come off the nearby building but is a ''work of art''.
**On Lambton Quay, opposite Cable Car Lane, the two '''stainless steel monoliths''' with pimples are actually a poem in braille!
**Where Lambton Quay meets Featherston Street there is a '''wind mobile'''. 
**The '''Bucket Fountain''' [http://www.bucketfountain.co.nz/] in Cuba Mall - a real splash, for many years. 
**The Wellington City Council website provides a guide to its public art: Wellington City Council Public Art Guide [http://wellington.govt.nz/services/arts/publicart/gallery.php?type=sculpture&page=1].

*'''Wellington Central Library''' (''closed due to earthquake risk''), (''in the city square, next to the information centre''), [http://www.wcl.govt.nz/]. It's huge with great places to sit and read or if you bring your laptop to connect home via one of the city's paid-for wi-fi networks. Entry is free.
*'''Matiu/Somes Island''' Out in the middle of the harbour, this island has its share of history.  It was once a quarantine station for immigrants, and later (and more extensively) for animals.  It was also an internment camp for "dangerous" individuals during both World Wars. The ferry leaves from Queen's Wharf and Day's Bay (on opposite sides of the harbour). Only at certain times will the ferry stop at the island and only upon request. The best choice is to leave Queen's Wharf at noon and return at 2:30PM or 3:25PM. $18.50.

==Do==
*The '''Botanic Garden''' is a nice place to go for a picnic, or just an afternoon walk. You can take the Cable Car from Lambton Quay for a quick 5-minute trip to the top; but it is not designed to be exciting, despite being photogenic. If you're keen on walking up, take the lifts in the The James Cook Arcade (or one of several others along Lambton Quay) up to The Terrace, head south uphill until you reach Salamanca Rd. Head uphill up Salamanca Rd until you reach Victoria University. A set of stairs on the opposite side of the road to the Hunter Lawn goes uphill right to the top of the Gardens. If you already shelled out for a Daytripper ticket, just catch the Mairangi bus, get off at the stop after the University, and walk back along Upland Rd until you reach the Cable Car Museum. At the top of the Gardens, there are several attractions:
**The '''Cable Car Museum''' has two of the old cars in semi-restored and fully-restored condition and some of the original Cable Car machinery from the system that was replaced in 1978. 
**The '''Lookout''' has a great view day or night, and the large map next to the round tree usually has a few pamphlets with maps of the Gardens. 
**The '''Carter Observatory''' is a stones throw from here. This is the perfect place to explore the Garden from, or wander back to the city.
*'''Bolton Street Memorial Park''' [http://www.boltoncemetery.org.nz/]. Watch out for the friendly black cat who haunts this hillside cemetery.  If you're returning from the Botanic Gardens by foot, this is great place to meander through and check out the epitaphs of early pioneers and historical figures.  
* '''Mt Victoria Lookout'''. A visit to Wellington is not complete without checking out Wellingtons most popular lookout, offering stunning views across the city and harbour.
*'''Red Rocks/ Seal Colony'''. This is an interesting walk named for its distinctive red rocks (probably Jasper). Take the number 1 bus to the end (Island Bay).  Walk across the park towards the ocean and hang a right.  There is another bus, number 4, that goes to the end of the road but only at certain times.  Travel west (right side, if facing the water) until you run out of road. Here you will find a disused quarry and a visitors center (open daily from 10am - 6pm, later in summer). The walk along this beach is pleasant but rocky and often very windy, so dress accordingly. The road is shared (except Sundays) with 4WDs and other motor traffic. If one walks for about 1 hour you will come across a distinctive pass though the rock face. Just on the other side of this is a seal colony (in May-October)that is worth the walk. Please bear in mind that these are wild animals and so require a certain level of respect, so keep your distance and do not get between them and the sea, especially if you value your health! Continuing on from here, you will eventually arrive at Makara (but this is a long distance, and the seal colony is a recommended turn-around point).

==Drink==
Wellington has a bustling nightlife, concentrated along '''Courtenay Place''', one of the major streets running from the CBD. It runs through Te Aro and ends in Mt Victoria. The nightlife causes this street to have the highest population density in all of New Zealand on Friday and Saturday nights. In most establishments, drinks are ok (~$NZD10-12), and entrance charges are either nonexistent or minimal. In some of the better clubs reasonable dress standards apply, however in many places tidy casual is acceptable. '''Cuba Mall''' also features some cool and more alternative bars. Away from Courtenay Place in the CBD district (Lambton Quay) there are many after work bars frequented by office workers, however this area becomes deserted in the later hours, and thus these establishments usually do not provide all night partying.

====Craft beer bars====

Wellington has experienced a surge in the production and popularity of locally-made craft beer since the mid-90s. As a response to this, one can now expect to find at least a few local beers in any good restaurant, and on tap in bars. While many bars are still in the process of shaking off their supply contracts with the major players (Lion, owned by Asahi) and DB Breweries (owned by Heineken International), there has been an enthusiastic response to small bars specialising in the provision of quality beer, in a similar way to San Francisco, San Diego and Portland.

===Shared House (longer stays)===
A better way to get to know more locals and experience some NZ culture (if that's what you are looking for) is a shared house (a "Flat" in NZ English). These are an option for stays of a month in the Summer while students are away – usually Flats are for the year or at least several months). Look for TradeMe listings [http://www.trademe.co.nz/flatmates-wanted/wellington], or on the Vic Deals local facebook group, as many flats are advertised there for summer sublets. 

Flats are much cheaper and usually well furnished already by the other tenants in the communal rooms. You may need to provide your own bed (you could buy a cheap one second hand for the summer), or they might be able lend you one. All flatmates share the rent, bills and chores, and occasionally food, meals and even washing too. Some flats come fully furnished, but this is not the norm.

==Stay safe==
Wellington is reasonably safe at night, but common sense should prevail, especially on Friday and Saturday nights, as in any other city.   

Occasionally, tourists relax security in New Zealand thinking that it is a crime-free paradise. While violent crime against tourists is very rare (and is usually followed up by public outrage against the offenders), opportunistic petty crime can still occur. Taking simple steps like locking valuables away and keeping to well-lit areas at night usually prevent problems. Muggings are uncommon, however it is best to walk in groups- particularly in the early hours of the morning- particularly in the darker suburban streets surrounding the CBD- for instance The Terrace, Willis Street, Cambridge Tce and the Waterfront.  

Vehicle break-ins are common, especially in shopping malls and 'park and ride' type car parks. Thieves generally target older vehicles with less complicated locks. Removing all valuables and leaving the glove box open (to show that no valuables are hidden) will usually act as a deterrent.  Police will normally give you a copy of their report for insurance purposes, but it is very unusual for the thieves to be apprehended or any stolen property to be recovered and returned to its owner.

The only other small worry is some areas of the city centre during the very late hours of night/early hours of morning, particularly Cuba Street, although a very interesting and great street for shopping during the day, it is also a local hangout for buskers, punks, homeless and other weirdos. Although you're more likely to be approached for change, offers of tinnies (small amounts of cannabis) and drunken conversation violence is fairly uncommon on Cuba Mall and there are numerous bouncers. There are regularly fights on Courtney Place on busy nights, typically as the bars stop serving between 3-5am.

The biggest risk while drinking in town is from groups of people who either can't afford to go to bars, are underage or are too drunk to get in anywhere who drink in parks, alleys and on the street itself. Despite the liquor ban, there are many liquor stores open until late in the CBD. Show common sense and try not to engage with drunks who are looking for a fight. 

Despite this the bouncers are numerous and highly professional as well as typically cooperating with one another and the police to control not just the bar space but also the street. There are also numerous police foot patrols through Courtney Place and Cuba Street. 

As long as you show a little common sense and don't drink more than you can handle Wellington has a vibrant nightlife that can be enjoyed as late as 5-6 am. If you meet the right locals you may even get taken to one of the unregistered venues that regularly party until 10 am the next day!

==Get Out==
The '''[[Greater Wellington]] region''' is far bigger than just '''Wellington City'''.  The old '''Wellington Province''' used to cover much of the southern half of the North Island, including the [[Horowhenua]], [[Manawatu]], and [[Wanganui]] regions.  

There are three other cities that are so close to Wellington that they effectively form a single large urban area; in population order they are:
*[[Hutt City|Lower Hutt]] (sometimes erroneously called "Hutt City", after its local council's self-chosen name)
*[[Porirua]]
*[[Upper Hutt]]

The nearby [[Hutt Valley]] and Porirua have a number of interesting sights and beaches. Plimmerton, for example, has seen future world windsurfing champions training, and Edmund Hillary practised rock-climbing at Titahi Bay before conquering Everest.

The suburbs of Eastbourne and Days Bay are on the eastern side of Wellington Harbour. They can be reached by car, bus or ferry. There are a number of enjoyable hill walks in both Days Bay [http://www.gw.govt.nz/eastharbour/] and Eastbourne [http://www.eastbourne.gen.nz]. The East By West ferry service [http://www.eastbywest.co.nz/] departs from Queens Wharf (Wellington) and travels to Days Bay Wharf, some services will stop on request at Somes Island (in the middle of the harbour), see route map [http://www.eastbywest.co.nz/pages.php?ID=3]. On weekends and public holidays the ferry also operates a harbour tour service which stops at Petone Wharf and Seatoun. 

Further afield, the south Wairarapa has become one of New Zealand's wine growing regions. Tranzit run a train/bus wine tasting tour[http://www.tranzit.co.nz/Day-Packages/Gourmet-Wine-Escape.asp] that leaves from Wellington Railway station each morning and visits four vineyards in the Wairarapa town of Martinborough, $115.

The Kapiti Coast is often called ''"The Nature Coast"'' and is a beautiful mix of beaches and lush native scenery. Spend the day at the beaches, near a river, or taking a walk through one of the many beautiful trails surrounding the hills and valleys bordering the coastline.

Take a 200 minute trip on one of the ferries to [[Picton (New Zealand)|Picton]].
