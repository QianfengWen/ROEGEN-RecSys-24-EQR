'''Chihuahua''' is large and prosperous capital in the centre of the state of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] in [[Northern Mexico]]. It has a population of about 925,970 and the predominant activity is light industry.

==Understand==
Chihuahua is famous for its Norteño food (similar to Tex-Mex), a delicious and healthy cuisine that makes liberal use of beef, cheese, and chiles.

The colonial center is beautiful and pedestrian-friendly. The outer areas of the city are affluent by Latin American standards but uninteresting for the average tourist. The central area has museums dedicated to Pancho Villa (a major folk hero in the north), another museum about the national mint, government palaces, and historic churches as well as luxurious mansions and villas.

There are also good dining spots and cantinas for males and it's very rare that a female is not welcome. The city's natives are friendly and helpful, unlike Mexico's more southern cities.

===Climate=== 
In the north and in the hills, it can be cold here during the winter. It even snows once or twice a year. During the summer temperatures can reach 40°C. Due to very clear skies, the sun can harm the skin a lot, sunscreen and headgear are recommended. Wear light, fresh, and comfortable clothes. Autumn is a particularly pleasant time of the year to visit the area.

==Get in==

===By car===
Being 4h south of Juarez/El Paso by expressway, the city is an easy drive to reach; there is no major city on the way, but there are roadside diners.

===By plane===
'''General Roberto Fierro Villalobos International Airport (CUU)''' is 18km from the city; a taxi is about $7.00 USD. In addition having nonstop flights to cities throughout Mexico, there are also a few nonstop flights to Dallas/Ft. Worth, Denver, Houston, and Phoenix.

===By bus===
Chihuahua's bus terminal (el terminal de bus sur) is conveniently located on Juan Pablo II boulevard in the south-eastern part of town, right across from the baseball stadium (deportivo sur). To access the Chihuahua Vive bus, which bisects the city from North to South, turn right after exiting the bus station onto the boulevard. A card is required to get through the turnstiles and any journey costs M$2.50 but a local was happy to scan us in. There are buses to all major cities in Mexico. Service is provided by the Omnibus de Mexico, The Chihuahuense, Estrella blanca, just to name a few. No English-speaking clerks detected at the ticket counters, so basic knowledge of Spanish will come in handy. There are also several bus lines such as [http://www.autobusesamericanos.com.mx/ Autobuses Americanos] and  [http://www.turimex.com/en/ Turimex Internacional] that run buses from Chihuahua to the U.S.

===By train===
Chihuahua is the start of the famous Copper Canyon railway linking Chihuahua with Los Mochis, called "el Chepe" [http://www.chepe.com.mx/] As of 03/11/2014, one-way tickets cost MXN1562 (around USD120) in second class and twice as much in first class, although the difference between the two classes of service is practically imperceptible, it's the same train with differently colored cars, providing same dining options and, obviously, same travel time from Chihuahua to Los Mochis. If you don't wish to find yourself stuck in a half-empty carriage with a couple of other ripped-off tourists, opt for the second class and spend your hard-earned cash on things to do at your destination place.

==Stay safe==
Northern Mexico, especially the state of Chihuahua, has experienced a sharp increase in violent drug-related crime since 2007. Chihuahua is much safer than [[Ciudad Juárez]] but still has had its share of cartel killings in the last two years. Most killings have specifically targeted drug dealers and their families, and tourists have rarely been affected by violent crime. Avoid bars and nightclubs that cater to a criminal element (not present in downtown Chihuahua). Military checkpoints may be set up in the city and the roads around the city. Always stop at these checkpoints.
