'''Baton Rouge''' [http://www.visitbatonrouge.com] is the capital of [[Louisiana]], [[USA]].  Located on the east bank of the mighty Mississippi River, Baton Rouge is Louisiana's second largest city, home of Louisiana State University (LSU), major port facilities, and a variety of attractions.

==Understand ==
[[Image:BatonRougeStateCapitol.jpg|thumb|right|State Capitol Building]]
The city name was coined over 300 years ago when on 17 March 1699, Pierre Le Moyne, Sieur d'Iberville, led an expedition along the Mississippi River. The early French explorers found a pole stained with the blood of fish and animals that served as the dividing line between the Bayougoula and Houmas Indians. It is from this "red stick" that Iberville christened the city "le Baton Rouge", French for "red stick".  

The small town was selected as the new capital of the state of Louisiana in 1817, and it's been growing ever since. The capital was returned to [[New Orleans]] for a while during and after the troubles of the American Civil War, but it was moved back in 1882.  

=== Climate ===
Baton Rouge has a semi-tropical climate, perfect for outdoor activities.

The weather is consistently warm from May-Sep. Be warned that, like the rest of the Southern United States during the summer, it can become down-right miserable, with sustained temperatures in the 90s (°F) with 100% humidity. Proper medical precautions should be taken if planning on partaking in outdoor activities, such as ample amounts of sunscreen and hydration. Also, there are many days throughout July that are classified as "ozone days," which are days on which the level of ground-level ozone is severe, causing health problems in sensitive individuals. This should be taken into consideration before planning outdoor activities throughout the summer months.

Winter is usually mild and short-lived. Spring is glorious with cool nights and warm, sunny days. A light jacket is all that is needed. Fall is mild and only a light sweater is needed in the evenings. 

Precipitation is reasonably well-distributed and ample throughout the year with an average annual precipitation of 55 in (140 cm) 
Average summer temperature: 81.3°F (27°C)
Average winter temperature: 52.5°F (11°C)
Average annual temperature: 67.5°F (20°C)

Baton Rouge, like many cities in the Gulf States, has what is known as 5 seasons.  The 5th season, being hurricane season.  The time of year between June 1 and November 30 when hurricane are most likely to form.

== Get in ==
===By plane===
'''Baton Rouge Metropolitan Airport''' ({{IATA|BTR}}) [http://www.flybtr.com/], located in north Baton Rouge, near Southern University. American Airlines, United Airlines, and Delta Airlines offer non-stop service to their respective hubs in the Southern United States.

That being said many travelers heading to and from Baton Rouge prefer using '''Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport''' ({{IATA|]MSY}}) [http://www.flymsy.com/] since it only located an hour away and is served by more airlines including various low cost carriers such as Southwest, JetBlue, Spirit and international carriers such as Air Canada and Copa Airlines.

The #103 Airport Express offers service to Downtown from approximately 5:20AM-6PM 7 days a week, with buses operating approximately every 40 minutes. [https://www.brcats.com/page/103-airport-express-to-downtown]
 
For Flight Booking to Baton Rouge, February is considered the cheapest and June is the most expensive month based on the average price per person per month.

===By train===

While there is no train station in Baton Rouge, connecting bus service can be booked with a train connecting in [[New Orleans]] or [[Hammond (Louisiana)|Hammond]].
[http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=am/am2Station/Station_Page&code=BTR].

===By car===
From [[New Orleans]], Baton Rouge is an 80-mi (129 km) northwest drive on I-10, which goes through the heart of downtown. The distance between the two Louisiana cities is an easy 90-min drive if you avoid weekday rush hours; if you catch the traffic of commuter rush hours at either end it can take a lot longer.

If you're driving in from anywhere east of Louisiana, come into Baton Rouge via I-12, which will take you north of Lake Pontchartrain and bypasses New Orleans. From the west, I-10 connects [[Lafayette (Louisiana)|Lafayette]], [[Houston]], and [[Los Angeles]] with Baton Rouge.  From the east, I-10 connects Baton Rouge with [[Mobile]], [[Pensacola]], and [[Jacksonville]].  If you're coming from [[Chicago]], [[St. Louis]], or [[Memphis]] follow I-55 South and merge onto I-12 West and continue driving for roughly 45 mi (72 km).
