'''Zhanjiang''' (湛江; ''Zhàn​jiāng''​) is a city on the western coast of [[Guangdong]] Province in [[China]].

==Understand==
Zhanjiang was a small fishing and trading port up till it came under French occupation at the end of the 19th century. The area leased by France from China’s Qing government was known in French as ‘Territoire de Kouang-Tchéou-Wan’ (meaning: Territory of Canton Bay). It had a total area of around 325 square miles, or 842 square km, on the eastern coast of Leizhou Peninsula and included two bays and the two large islands Dong Hai Island and Nao Zhou Island. The territory’s main town was Fort Bayard and from around 1899 up to the outbreak of WW2, the French had visions of developing this, and adjacent towns within their territory, into a trading port to rival Hong Kong. However, it came under Japanese occupation in World War II, and it was returned to China by France in 1946. Some grandiose old French colonial buildings survive in various states of repair in the older parts of Xiashan and Chikan districts. During the period of French administration, XiaShan served as the political and administrative centre and the more heavily populated Chikan district served as the main centre for commerce. 

Today though, Zhanjiang is a major port city with a superb, deep water habour facilitating its rapid economic development into a modern, harbourside city. Many people in Zhanjiang speak Mandarin (普通话 Pǔtōnghuà) with a fairly strong accent. The native languages for true locals are Cantonese (广东话 Guǎngdōnghuà) and/or Leizhouhua (雷州话 Léizhōuhuà), a distinct dialect of Hokkien. Foreign visitors need to be aware that there is not much English spoken in Zhanjiang.

It is said that Zhanjiang has “a humid subtropical climate, with mild winters and hot, wet summers”. But, for much of the year it just feels outright tropical with high temperatures and soaring humidity.

==Get in==
Zhanjiang is at the base of the Leizhou peninsula that points toward the island province [[Hainan]]. Travellers often pass through Zhanjiang en route to Hainan. Some travellers pass through Zhanjiang en route to Hainan, but increasingly those coming to Zhanjiang do so simply to enjoy its harbourside ambiance, local culture and superb seafood. There are standard trains and buses to and from nearby mainland cities, with long-distance trains connecting Zhanjiang direct to Beijing (36 hours), Shanghai (24 hours), Kunming (24 hours) and a number of other distant cities. 

Fast trains now also connect Zhanjiang (from Zhanjiang West Station) direct to Guangzhou (around 3 hours) and Shenzhen (around 4 hours). 

Ferries travel to Haikou, capital of Hainan, from Hai’an at the southern most part of the Leizhou peninsula; the port for the Ferry service is a bit over an hour’s bus ride away from Zhanjiang’s Haitian bus-station. 

There are two train stations and a small but busy airport with direct flights to Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Chongqing, Shanghai, Beijing, Hangzhou and many other mainland cities, as well as daily direct flights to Hong Kong and several services each week to Bangkok and Phnom Penh. Buses also run daily to most nearby cities, with the main bus stations being Zhanjiang South Bus Station, located about 100 m south of Zhanjiang Railway Station (South Station), and Haitian Bus Station located to the north of town on Renmin Dadao Bei (North Peoples Avenue).

==Get around==
Zhanjiang is almost like two cities combined: the northern half, composed of Chikan district (赤坎区 Chìkǎn qū), Jin Sha Wan (金沙湾 Jīn Shā Wān)and Mazhang District (麻章区 Mázhāng qū) and the southern Xiashan District (霞山区 Xiáshān qū) are separated by a less developed corridor. 

The main bus routes (2, 11, 12, 22) travel from the northern districts to Xiashan and back. Smaller buses and other routes can allow you to explore more areas of the individual districts. 

Taxis in Zhanjiang are fairly cheap, starting at ¥7. Afterwards the fare increases by ¥2 per kilometer.

This municipal museum might not be cavernous, or crammed with an infinite array of archaeological wonders, but it's still very absorbing. Located in Chakan, its major exhibits document the way that Zhanjiang's people resisted attacks from French naval forces in the 19th century. Foreign visitors may not know much about this episode, but the locals remember it, and you'll soon learn everything you need to know. Along with that, there's an excellent show of ancient copper drums, and some delicate porcelain creations - enough for an afternoon of diversion and education, for sure. Be sure to take time to appreciate the building’s exterior design – it’s a superb piece of grand Soviet style architecture. Also, be sure to see the many historical stone dogs in the grass to the side (away from the entrance) of the museum that are a must see. </see>

==Buy==
As a major stop for many bikers heading to the islands, Zhanjiang has a fair range of bicycle shops to shop on components and parts. Most shops are located along Minzhi Road (民治路) and certain brands such as Dahon, Giant, Merida also have their branches there, and various bike shops are scattered around Chikan. 

Like all big Chinese cities, Zhanjiang has many big supermarkets by well-known brands including Wal-Mart, Chain-Mart, Lotus and RT-Mart. The best ones, for those seeking a range of imported foodstuffs as well as spirits, imported wines and an increasingly diverse range of local and imported beers, are the Wal-marts.

==Eat==
Local specialties include fresh seafood, oysters (locals love them barbecued), longyan, lychees (litchi), jackfruit, pineapple, sugarcane and sweet potato.  

There are too many great restaurants in Zhanjiang to list here. But if you are visiting, we recommend enjoying some fresh local seafood, barbecued oysters (which are a really popular evening snack) and local fruits in season. A great place to enjoy a range of fresh seafood is at Dong Feng Seafood Market. Many restaurants around town serve great local oysters, including some specialising in these morsels. But people wanting to enjoy some good barbecue with the locals, including superb barbecued Zhanjiang oysters, should head to the cluster of Da Pai Dong’s in Bai Xin Cun (100 names village – 百姓村 bǎixìng cūn) or on the corner of Renmin Dadao Bei and Hai Bin DaDao Bei.

==Drink==
Over recent years, some great coffee shops and numerous milk-tea and bubble milk-tea shops have sprung up around Zhanjiang. As well as the famous American chain coffee shop, there are plenty of good, local coffee shops with great atmosphere, some of which serve up really coffee and/or try to cater to real coffee aficionados. May of these are to be found in older streets and laneways in Chikan and Xiashan, away from the fancy shopping malls, where the rents are much cheaper the local atmosphere far more alluring. 

Many of the western-style restaurants, such as the West Coast Coffeehouse (西海安 xīhǎi ān) at the northern end of Haibin Park in XiaShan, with a second outlet at the norther part of Jin Sha Wan, and another inside Wanda Plaza, sell a great range of western style meals along with a variety of mocktails and wine by the bottle. 

Also, Wal-Mart (all 3 locations) has the best selection of spirits, imported wines and a diverse range of local and imported beers if you would like to make your own drinks.

Its located on ground floor (podium level) of Rivan Plaza, fronting Ti Yu Bei Lu. </drink>
