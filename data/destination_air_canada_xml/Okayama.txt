Okayama is a major transit hub for western Japan. However, with its white peaches, a brooding black castle, and the famous Kōrakuen Garden, there are plenty of reasons to leave the train station and explore.

With a population of over 700,000 people, Okayama ranks among Japan's most populated cities and is a major economic center in the Chugoku Region.

===Legend of Momotarō===

According to the Japanese fairytale of Momotarō, an old, childless couple found a peach floating down the river, and inside they found a baby boy. They duly adopted him and named him '''Momotarō''' (桃太郎), or (quite literally) "Peach Boy". As he grew, he began to feel greatly indebted to the couple that raised him, and when he was finally grown, he announced that he would be going on a journey to Onigashima (Demon Island) to fight the demons that had been causing trouble in the nearby villages. The old woman prepared ''kibi-dango'' (see [[#Eat|Eat]]) for him to take on his journey and bid him farewell.

On his way to the island, he befriended a dog, a monkey, and a pheasant by giving them each a piece of the ''kibi-dango''. With their help, he defeated the demons; Momotarō took the demons' treasures back home and gave them to the old couple to thank them for all the things they'd done for him throughout the years. The couple rejoiced that he was back safely, and they all lived happily ever after.

Residents claim that Okayama was the original setting of the fairytale, and that it was based on the legend of Prince Kibitsuhiko's battle against the ogre Ura, who is said to have lived in Kino-jo (Demon's Castle) in the area around [[Soja]]. Today, Okayama is a busy city of some 700,000 people, and its main street is named ''Momotarō-Odōri'' in the Peach Boy's honor; you'll find statues from the tale along the way. Although the Culture Zone can easily fill a full day, try to set aside time for cycling the Kibi Plain - it's another fun way to explore the history of this intriguing area.

===History===
Although Okayama's documented history tends to get overshadowed by its folklore history, the area has been one of the most important in Japan for centuries. In ancient times, Okayama was part of the '''Kibi Kingdom''' (吉備国 ''kibi no kuni''). Situated between Yamato (present-day [[Nara]]) to the east and [[Korea]] and other Japanese tribes to the west, the Kibi Kingdom exercised a great amount of control over trade between the regions. At its peak, the Kibi Kingdom was said to have been equal in power to the Yamato tribes. The large kofun (burial mounds) that still exist in the Kibi Plains are a testament to the power of the Kibi.

In 645 AD, the Kibi Kingdom was dissolved into four separate provinces: Bingo, Bitchu, Bizen, and Mimasaka. Most of modern Okayama City fell within the Bizen Province. Development of the area into a large, unified city is accredited to Ukita Naoie who built up the domain as a castle town with Okayama as its capital in 1573. That same year, he commissioned Okayama Castle to be constructed, although it was not completed until 1597. The Ukita continued to rule until they found themselves on the losing side in the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. Hideaki Kobayakawa, who betrayed Ukita Hideie at Sekigahara, was given control of Okayama but he died after only 2 years as its leader, so the territory was awarded to Ikeda Tadetsugu, one of Tokugawa Ieyasu's grandsons. The Ikeda were powerful rulers that continued to foster growth and cultural development in the city, including the construction of Korakuen Garden from 1686 to 1700. The influence of the Ikeda extended well beyond the borders of their domain as they ruled until the the start of the Meiji Period in 1871, when the provinces were reorganized into prefectures. In 1945, the city was bombed as a result of World War II. Most of the city center, including Okayama Castle, was destroyed. The castle was rebuilt from concrete in 1966. Most of the city center was also rebuilt.

Although it had always been an important hub in Western [[Honshu]], Okayama experienced renewed importance with the extension of the Shinkansen train from [[Osaka]]. Construction of the line began in 1965, a year after the line connecting [[Tokyo]] to [[Osaka]] opened and it began operation in 1972.

===Talk===
The '''Okayama dialect''' (岡山弁) is quite different from standard Japanese, with several vocabulary and sound-related distinctions. Sound changes include word-final ''-i'' of adjectives changing to a drawn-out ''-ee'' (e.g., ''sugoi'' ("amazing") to ''sugee'') and standard ''da'' copula becoming ''ja'', with Okayama-specific vocabulary including ''deeree'' or ''bokkee'' (standard Japanese: ''totemo'', meaning "very") and ''oidensee'' (standard Japanese: ''irasshaimase'', "welcome"). Though Okayama dialect is used by men and women, it is thought (even by some locals) to sound somewhat "rough", and even unladylike when used by younger women.

Spoken English ability is generally poor, but some residents may surprise you with their fluency. Locals understand standard Japanese, but depending on the dialectical "severity" of the speaker, you may not understand their response. Of course, any use of the local dialect on your part will likely result in both surprise and good-natured amusement. Despite the lack of English-speakers, Okayama residents tend to be extremely friendly and willing to offer help.

[[Image:Okayama.png|thumb|right|500px|Map of Okayama - city center]]
Fares for public transport can either be paid in cash or by using a [http://www.okayama-kido.co.jp/hareca/index.html Hareca Card]. Board trams and buses at the rear, take a boarding ticket, and pay your fare at the front when you disembark. The driver will not give change, but there is a machine on the tram that will change coins.

===By tram===
Two convenient tram lines run from the east side of JR Okayama Station. The Higashiyama line runs along Momotaro-Odori to Okayama Symphony Hall (stopping at "Shiroshita" tram stop, which is the closest stop to Okayama Castle), and then turns south towards the prefectural government office before winding towards the terminus. The other line turns to the right about half-way along Momotaro-Odori, passes the central post office, and terminates at the Seikibashi intersection.

===By bus===
Buses run throughout the city. However, different companies operate similar routes that depart at different times from different bus-stops. The staff at bus information centers are very helpful, but might not give information on rival companies running similar routes unless asked.

===By bicycle===
Bicycling is a popular activity for visitors to Okayama. For those who want to bike from Okayama Station, there is a Rentacycle Bike Rental (¥300/day) in the station. Upon exiting Okayama Station (Higashi-guchi Exit), turn to the right and walk straight along the station building. You'll pass the Hotel Granvia (left side) and the Renta-Car. It's about a 3 minute walk from the station exit.

'''[http://momochari.jp/ Momochari]''' operates a bicycle sharing network within downtown Okayama. The name is a play on words. In Japanese, ''mama-chari'' is what they call women's bikes (typically bikes with baskets). ''Momo'' is the Japanese word for 'peach', a reference to the city's famous white peaches and Momotaro, the Peach Boy. To rent a Momo-chari bicycle, you must first purchase a membership card from any of the machines at a Momo-chari bicycle station. They can be paid for with ICOCA/SUICA cards. The bikes cost ¥100 for the first hour and an additional ¥100 every 30 minutes thereafter. The maximium cost for a 24 hour period is ¥1,000. If you keep the bike beyond 24 hours, it costs an additional ¥1,000 per day.

'''Statues of Momotaro''' are a popular Okayama photo-op. Arriving by train, you'll see your first at the east exit of JR Okayama Station, but there are Momotaro motifs all over the city &mdash; there is a Momotaro mailbox at the east exit of the station, and even manholes often feature the Peach Boy. You will also find individual statues of his travel companions the dog, monkey, and pheasant aligning both sides of Momotaro-odori. At the end of the island where Korakuen is located, look for the '''Riverside Peachbaby''', a statue of Momotaro holding a peach to the heavens.

===Culture Zone===
Many of central Okayama's main sights are clustered on the eastern side of the Central Business District in the area known as the Culture Zone. From JR Okayama station, take the tram three stops east to Shiroshita on the Higashiyama Line. All of the sites are within short walking distance.

English-speaking guides are available for free tours of the castle and garden. The guides are volunteers, so it's best to call ahead (086-224-1166) to ensure that they will be available.

Construction started in 1687 and took 13 years. Today Korakuen largely keeps its form from the Edo era, with waterfalls, tiny shrines, teahouses, miniature maple forests, a lotus pond, and even a greenhouse filled with orchids and cacti. The rare red-crested white cranes are another notable feature and released for flying exhibitions on special occasions throughout the year. The large wooden building in the park was used to host visiting members of the imperial family. There are two entrances to the garden: across from the Okayama Prefectural Museum, and across the Moon-Viewing Bridge (月見橋 ''Tsukimi-kyo'').

With the exception of one external turret, the current version dates from 1966, but the outside is much more accurate than most Japanese castle replicas, as the original blueprints were used to rebuild it.

===Kibiji District===

The Kibiji District (吉備路), in the northeastern part of the city, from Okayama to [[Soja]], was once the center of the Kingdom of Kibi (吉備国 ''kibi no kuni''), whose power was said to equal to that of the Yamato. Strategically located between the Yamato and civilizations on the Korean peninsula, the Kibi Kingdom was highly influential. Its leaders continued to influence the Yamato government even after the Kibi Kingdom fell. Many of the historical and cultural sites are associated with the legend of Prince Kibitsuhiko-no-mikoto (see [[Okayama#Understand|Understand]]). 

The Kibiji District is best visited by bike. The information office at JR Okayama Station can provide a map of the Kibiji Zone, including a cycling route.

The [https://taiken.co/single/kibiji-cycling-trail Kibiji Cycling Trail], a 17 km trail extending from Okayama to [[Soja]], is a scenic cycling path, voted as one of the top 100 cycling paths in [[Japan]]. There is no need to bring your own bike, because you can rent your bike upon arrival. Bike rentals are available adjacent to the JR station at Bizen Ichinomiya (upon exiting the station, the rental area is directly to the right). To reach Bizen-Ichinomiya from Okayama Station transfer to the 'Local lines' section. Two lines run on this track, so ask an attendant which train to take to Bizen-Ichinomiya if you are not sure. The ride should only take about 10 minutes. They will provide you with a map, although the entire trail is quite well-marked. Signs along the path have "Kibiji District" written on them in English and Japanese. You can return the bicycle at Soja station. The rental cost is ¥1,000 per bicycle per day. The sites along the trail are free, so expenses are quite nominal, making the cycling trail a '''highly affordable''' way to see a wide variety of cultural sites. The official estimated time to cycle the trail is 2 hours; however, if you take the time to thoroughly explore the sites, you can easily make it a half-day excursion, perhaps combining it with a visit to some of the other sites in the area.

Although it is a cycling course, it is possible to use the trail for hiking. All sites can be reached by using the train and then walking (or taking a bus, for certain locations). In order to see all the sites before evening, you should arrive at Bizen Ichinomiya Station no later than 10AM. (It is unlikely that you will be able to see any of the other sites in the area, since it will take most of the day to walk the trail.) Hiking the trail is ambitious, as you will also be walking around the grounds of each of the sites along the way, so make sure to wear appropriate footwear and bring food, because you won't reach the restaurants (which are mainly located in the [[Soja]] portion) until late in the day.

If you begin your travels from Bizen Ichinomiya Station, the following sites are listed in the order in which you will see them.

Finally, the prince shot two arrows at the same time, hitting the demon directly in the eye (but not yet killing him - read on).</see>

However, Koikui is much more interesting than it appears. After the demon was shot by the prince's arrows, he transformed into a carp and swam away. The prince turned into a cormorant and followed him. Koikui Shrine is located on the site where the prince is believed to have caught and killed the demon.</see>

The tomb on the Okayama side of the trail (造山古墳) is the most interesting. This burial mound, believed to have been completed in the fifth century, was the largest in the nation at the time it was built. Because the tomb within the mound has never been excavated, it is not certain who is actually buried here; however, it is believed to be one of the former rulers of the Kibi Kingdom, as tombs of this size were reserved only for those in the highest positions. Although the best view of Japanese burial mounds is always from above (to see the key-hole shape), at this mound, visitors are actually permitted to walk on top of it. Atop the mound there is a shrine.</see>

Free [[Meditation in Japan|meditation sessions]] from 8-9AM most Sundays are usually followed by a simple tea ceremony. The garden behind the temple is famous for having one of the largest cherry blossom trees in Okayama and a lake which beautifully reflects the tree and the surrounding countryside. This garden was designed by the same architect who built Korakuen.

Although the mountain is near the center of the city, the area around it maintains a rural atmosphere. It can be very pleasant to hike over around this hill and visit the various small temples and shrines. If Zen meditation at Sogenji gives you a backache, you can relieve your aches and pains at a ''ganban onsen'' (rock hot spring.) This style of hot spring does not have a large bathing area but instead has gravel and hard rock beds where steam passes up from under you or down from above like a sauna.</see>

The priest Yasutaka founded this temple. It is said that while meditating in Hasedera Temple, an oracle came to him instructing him to repair the Kannon Hall in Bizen Kanaoka. He immediately departed for the West. On his way, he met a dragon deity carrying a rhinoceros horn who told him to build the temple and then vanished. The priest did as he was told and called it Saidaiji (犀戴寺) "rhino temple", but the characters were later changed by retired Emperor Gotoba to its current spelling (西大寺) after prayer-writing revealed to him the new name.</see>

During the coldest month of the year, men wearing only ''fundoshi'' (traditional Japanese loincloths) fight to obtain one of two lucky sticks thrown by the temple priests. The men who catch the sticks will have an entire year of good fortune and also receive a cash reward from the festival's sponsors. All the lights in the temple are temporarily blacked out and other "less-lucky" sticks are also thrown down into the crowd of participants to create even more confusion. Spectators too jostle for viewing spots, but you can choose to pay to watch from the temporary spectator grandstand. The festival originated in the 16th century when people would request special talismans thrown out by priests. As word spread that the talismans were bringing those who possessed them good luck, more and more people came to get them, fights broke out and the talismans were damaged. Later this all evolved into a midnight festival with only male participants dressed in loincloths. Today, the fesival continues to evolve, with the "midnight" highlight of the festival recently moved forward 2 hours to finish at 10PM.</do>

'''Kibi dango''' (吉備団子) are sweet millet-flour dumplings. According to the legend, Momotaro gave his companions ''kibi dango'', and they helped him defeat the demons. Whether or not you'll like ''kibi dango'' enough to run off and fight demons will vary by personal taste, but they certainly are a tasty treat. The name is a bit of a pun too, as ''kibi'' means both "millet" and the ancient kingdom of Kibi, which covered a large area of present-day Okayama prefecture.

Not surprisingly, going along with the "peach boy" theme, one of the famous fruits grown in and around Okayama is the '''white peach''' (白桃 ''shiromomo''). Okayama is also well known for '''grapes''' (葡萄 ''budō''), particularly '''muscat''', which have been grown here since 1886 and command 95% of the Japanese market. Known as the "Queen of Fruits", they're priced to match at ¥2000 to ¥10,000 a bunch, while pione grapes can go for as little as ¥1000. The best season to eat muscats is the beginning of October, but the best choice for a souvenir are the grape sherbets, jellies, and wines, which keep for longer and are easier to get through customs.

'''Mamakari''' (ままかり), a herring-like fish, is another specialty that can be enjoyed throughout [[Okayama Prefecture|Okayama]], as they are fished from the [[Seto Inland Sea]]. Another local delicacy is ''sawara'' (鰆), a white-fleshed fish translated into English alternatively as "trout" or "horse mackerel". A popular takeaway option is '''matsuri-zushi''' (祭り寿司), the local version of ''chirashi-zushi'' (sushi rice dressed with vinegar and topped with egg and seafood), sold in a peach-shaped box at Okayama station kiosks and some restaurants as well.
