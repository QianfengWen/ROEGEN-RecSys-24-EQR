It services scheduled domestic operations, charter flights, and General Aviation. Road access is from either Airport Drive or McGregor Street.

The airport provides the normal NZ Aviation Security Service and has a Air New Zealand Koru Lounge in the terminal.

===By train===

* "The Capital Connection", a daily commuter service to [[Wellington]] 

* '''The Overlander''', Provides a daily service. See the article on [[Train travel in New Zealand|train travel in New Zealand]] for more detail.

===By car===

Palmerston North is 7 hr by car from [[Auckland]] and 2 hr from the capital [[Wellington]] on State Highway 1 (SH1).

==Get around== 

Palmerston North is built around '''The Square'''. Railway lines used to run through the Square, to the station, goods and shunting yards on Main Street West. This proved to be extremely impractical so the station was moved in 1964-66 and the site was subsequently turned into a park, known as the Railway Land. This explains why the roads radiating outwards from the Square are so wide because they used to accommodate the railway tracks. Most places are easily accessible by foot.

===Bicycle===

One of the advantages of Palmerston North is that it is compact, flat and easy to cycle around. The main educational institutions have cycle-lanes from the city centre. The main route to Massey University along Fitzherbert Avenue is packed with cyclists every morning.
