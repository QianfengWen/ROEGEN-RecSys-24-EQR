{{pagebanner|Gaborone Banner.jpg}}

'''Gaborone''' is the capital of [[Botswana]] and located in the south of the country, near the border to [[South Africa]].

==Understand==
Planned to be the country's capital following independence in 1966, Gaborone is now a sprawling city of around 250,000 people and measures close to 15km from east to west. Generally it is a clean, safe and functioning city. 

There is a definite city centre based around the train station and the government enclave of Khama Crescent. However, numerous shopping malls are dotted all over the city diluting the prominence of the centre.

Gaborone's nomenclature confuses most new arrivals. Different parts of town are called Blocks, Extensions, Phases etc. and there can be multiple names for the same place. Below is a rough guide:

*   The '''Extensions''' - to the east of the railway line radiating out from the Government Enclave. Extensions 9 and 11 are probably the wealthiest parts of Gaborone. Extension 15, out near Riverwalk Mall is known as 'the Village'
*   '''Gabs West''' - the inner blocks to the west of the railway line, inside the Western Bypass. Gabs West is sub-divided into '''Phases''' 1, 2, 4 and industrial.
*   The '''Blocks''' - to the west of the railway line, outside the Western Bypass. The blocks number 5 - 10 running south to north (although Block 9 is an outlier being the southern most of the blocks, and there is a Block 3 directly north of the downtown area). Some maps (inc Google Maps) label the Blocks as high numbered Extensions (eg Block 8 is made up of Extensions 35 & 36) but everyone will refer to an area by its Block number.
*   The '''Central Business District''' refers to a patch of undeveloped land slap in the centre of the city that only started being developed into overly modern hotels and offices (inc the new Lansmore hotel) in 2012.
*   '''Phakalane''' a new-build suburb 12km north of the centre of Gaborone - based around a golf estate - on the east side of the A1 Francistown road. South-west of Phakalane is the still to be developed '''Glen Valley'''
*   '''Gaborone North''' - a developing suburb out towards the airport to the west of Phakalane.
*   '''Broadhurst''' is an older suburb to the northeast of the centre. On the southern edge of Broadhurst are '''Partial''' and '''Maru-a-Pula'''
*   '''Tlokweng''' a richer and traditional suburb to the east of the Notwane river, home to several nice guesthouses.

[http://wikimapia.org/?search=gaborone#lat=-24.6432015&lon=25.9182515&z=13&l=0&m=b Wikimapia] is the best online resource using the standard nomenclature. Knight Frank, a real estate agent with an office near the Shell Garage on the Main Mall, has a useful map of the city.

===Climate===
Gaborone features a semi-arid climate with hot characteristics. Summers have an average daily temperature of 25.7°C (78.3°F) with highs and lows at 32°C (90°F) and 20°C (67°F). Due to its altitude, at 1000m (3340ft), the heat isn't as intense as you would expect and temperatures haven't actually got above 40°C (104°F) in the city's recorded history. Winter starts in May and lasts until August and, again due to its altitude, can become pretty chilly. Temperatures in July (the coldest month) range from 4°C (40°F) to 23°C (73°F), therefore having large temperature variations. There is an average of 1 day per year, when temperatures reach 0°C (32°F) and the lowest recorded temperature is -2°C (28°F). Most rainfall falls December to March and the winter period is almost completely dry. Overall, there is no real best time of the year to visit the city, but most tourists visit in June, July and August.

==Get in==
Customs is a mere formality and is quite efficiently organised. Make sure you have an address that you can state you will be staying at. 

===By plane===
*''' Air Botswana''', in the Main Mall, Phone: 395 1921, [http://www.airbotswana.co.bw]. The national carrier recently scaled back services due to low demand, and now no longer operates to Lusaka and Harare (as of December 2016).  The standard routes are to [[Johannesburg]] OR Tambo (daily) and [[Cape Town]], as well as domestic flights to [[Francistown]], [[Kasane]] and [[Maun]]. Every couple of years they will expand their services, then scale back as the new routes prove unpopular.  Air Botswana are reliable and offer good service. Note that their website does not detail all their routes, phone for the latest information. Typical fares from Gabs are in USD200-400 range. 
*'''SA Airlink''' [http://www.flyairlink.com/flights-to-gaborone/gaborone.php] also fly Johannesburg to Gaborone as of 2014. Whilst this airline has 'links' with South African Airways and SA Express they are separate entities and tickets are not transferable.
*'''Air Namibia''' [http://www.airnamibia.com.na/] flies a new route (from 2016) from [[Windhoek]] to [[Durban]] via Gaborone on Mon,  Wed,  Fri,  Sun.  
*'''Kenya Airways'''  Prime Plaza building, New CBD. +267 391 7000 [http://www.kenya-airways.com/] has suspended direct flights to Gaborone.
*'''Ethiopian Airlines''' [http://www.ethiopiansairline.com/destinations/gaborone.html] are taking up the mantle and trying to make a go of direct flights to/ from [[Addis Ababa]] on Sundays, Tuesdays and Fridays providing a useful alternative to Johannesburg for connections to the rest of the world.

===By bus===
* '''Flight Connect''' [http://www.scribd.com/doc/203651766/Flight-Connect] +267 3105 896. Daily coach service between OR Tambo airport (Johannesburg) and Gaborone. Modern coach with free Wi-Fi. BWP350 one way. Approx 5-6 hours.

* '''Intercape''' Daily bus that connects [[Pretoria]], [[South Africa]] with Gaborone. Tickets can be booked online at [http://www.intercape.co.za] or purchased at one of their offices. The bus departs from Pretoria Station on Paul Kruger & Scheiding Street at 13:15 and arrives at the Kudu Shell Service Station in Gaborone at 21:10 (an 8h bus ride).  This bus makes a brief stop at the [[Johannesburg]] bus station to pick up passengers.  From ZAR270 (saver) to ZAR350 (fully flexible).  The bus is pretty nice: tourist class, reclining seats, and a working bathroom. However, be prepared for the “Christian materials on-board.” Basically, all the movies that are played on the Intercape bus have overtly religious messages in them.  

The border crossing between South Africa and Botswana is pretty straight forward. Passengers get off the bus (without luggage, just their documentation) at the South African immigration check point to get their exit stamps, then they walk over to the Botswana side to get their entrance visa stamps. Be careful, buses sometimes do leave passengers stranded in the border without telling them.

AT&T Monnakgotla connects Gaborone with [[Windhoek]] and [[Johannesburg]].

===By car===
Many drive in from Gauteng. If coming from [[Johannesburg]] the quickest and simplest route is via Magaliesburg and Swartruggens. There is a ZAR75 toll going this route. Most drivers turn north at Zeerust and enter via the Tlokweng gate - going via the Pioneer Gate and Lobatse is slower, and there are more cows on the road. If arriving at night the Tlokweng gate is definitely recommended as there are fewer cows on this route (there should be none on the South African side). Be aware that the Tlokweng border gets very busy at 18:00-22:00 on Sundays, with waits of an hour or more possible.

==Get around==
* Travellers not used to left side of the road driving should exercise caution while driving and crossing the street, as most of Southern Africa (Gaborone, Botswana included) drives on the left.

===By (shared) taxi===
Public taxis are generally small white cars and can be identified by their blue license plates. These cars travel designated routes, generally going to areas/neighbourhoods that combi routes do not. The fare for a taxi is BWP5.00. Since taxis can only hold a maximum of 4 passengers they also tend to be quicker than a combi in completing their route. You  can catch a taxi at many combi stops and ask them to drop you off anywhere along the route. For route information simply ask the driver of the taxi. If you need to go to a particular destination not on the taxi route then ask for a "special", see cab section below.

===By cab===
A cab is a private taxi or a "special" which takes you directly from your origin to destination. This may be a public taxi with a blue licence plate or a privately run cab. Generally you must request a cab by phone. There are several cab companies in Gabs and many display contact information on the cab itself. You can also hail public taxis on the road and request a special. To give directions, its usually better to give Plot numbers or easily identified places rather than street names (which aren't commonly used). If a driver gives you a good rate, ask him for his cell phone number and remind him of the place where you are staying. Using one driver the whole time you are in Gaborone can end up saving you money. Don't worry if you hail a cab with someone inside. Offer to split the fare for the destination and save each other some cash. Don't be afraid to try and discuss lower fares. Most trips should be BWP20-30 (eg. Main Mall to Game City is around BWP30). 

* '''AB Cab''', tel. 390 2147.
*[http://www.homerra.co.bw/ '''Home Rra'''] -  a service that aims to reduce drink-driving by safely taking you home, when you want, and in your own car. + 267 390 6415.

===By combi===
Combis are white vans that are like mini-buses. Combis cost BWP5.00. There are different lines which are painted on the front of the combi, so just ask the driver if that line passes where you need to go. If you know the direction you need to go, start walking there - combis will honk at you as they are passing to let you know they're behind you. Map is available at [https://rutemap.com/]

===By bus===
You can get to most big cities by bus. However, do arrive at the bus station early, as the buses can fill up very quickly, and sometimes just leave as soon as they are full. Bring water, as the buses are often not air conditioned, and if you do not manage to get a seat, it is likely you will have to stand until at least halfway to your destination, particularly on week-ends.

===By car===
Gaborone is the car capital of Botswana. Traffic levels are manageable, however during rush hours (07:00-08:00, 16:30-18:00) traffic can come to a standstill, in particular on the bridges crossing the railway line.  Driving standards are OK, however there are many traffic lights (robots) which stay red for a ''long'' time, hence many drivers run red lights - perhaps 6 or more cars will run a red before traffic comes to a stop.  Some Stop signs are also optional, which means that further caution is needed.

===By train===
There is a [https://brexpress.botrail.bw/botswanarailwaysonline/passengerbooking/bookandpay.aspx daily night train] from Gaborone to Francistown, and onward to Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, leaving Gabs at 21.35 and arriving in Francistown at 6.10.

It's surrounded by hills with Manyelanong on the East and Baratani hill on the West. Manyelanong is one of the only two sites where you have the opportunity to see Cape vultures. Because of its height, difficulty to navigate and cliffs, it provides a perfect breeding ground for vultures. Hence the Mannyelanong Game reserve, established solely for the purpose of protecting these endangered vultures. Baratani hill is popularly known for one of the most outstanding stories of  young lovers who were in a forbidden relationship. They decided to elope and hid in a nearby hill but never came back. Residents ever since then have never climbed this hill for fear of not returning.<br />The village has many stories about its people, one outstanding story is of the brave woman "Bosetlha" who killed a 3m Python which had wrapped itself around her body. Though she is now old but still active, Nkuku Bosetlha confirms she got attacked by the snake on her way coming from the lands, the snake wrapped itself around her body. After unsuccessful shouts for help, she desperately fought for her life by tightly opening the python's mouth wider for approximately 30minutes until good samaritans passed by and cut the snakes head with a knife.</do>

===Hills & Viewpoints===
* '''Kgale Hill''' - [http://goo.gl/WZKbbL] Do not forget to make the pleasant climb up Kgale Hill, one of Botswana's largest hills (at about 100m). It provides a magnificent view over the city and surrounding areas. Be careful of the baboons, though, and do not stray off the path. There are no guides, and there is no entrance fee to worry about. DO GO - BUT ONLY when there are other cars in the parking lot. The best time is M-F 16:00-18:00. The middle of a weekend day is not a good time.

===Game Reserves===
* '''Mokolodi''', [http://www.mokolodi.com/]. The highlight of many people's stay in Gaborone is a two-hour game drive where you might see baboons, giraffe, wart hogs, zebra, elephant, hippo, etc. The guides are always very nice. The wonderful restaurant at Mokolodi is worth a visit even without a game drive.

* '''Gaborone Game Reserve''', [http://www.botswana-tourism.gov.bw/attractions/gaborone_g.html]. One of the smaller game reserves, if you have a car you can just drive yourself around. Mostly birds, but some monkeys, wart hogs and ostrich. Recently zebras, wild boars, kudus have been added. It has got picnic spots, but be careful of monkeys and ostriches.

==Buy==
Gaborone abounds with shopping malls, and pretty much ''every'' South African chain store has at least one branch somewhere in the city. Unfortunately this crowds out local independent shops. This, coupled with seemingly rampant [http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=31&sid2=1&aid=194&dir=2012/May/Friday11 collusion and price fixing] among retailers makes Gabs a disappointing and quite expensive place to shop, despite the 12% VAT rate undercutting the 14% in South Africa.

That said there are a smattering of arts villages and local workshops that buck the trend, and a visit can make a pleasant diversion for an afternoon.

==Eat==
Gaborone offers the best eating this side of Johannesburg, and there are some excellent restaurants in the city, with steaks and south Asian cuisine being particular highlights. However Gaborone does suffer a little from South African culinary hegemony and if you want to avoid bland South African chain restaurants some forward planning is required. Certainly there are some interesting nooks and crannies to interest your taste buds.

The restaurants below are organised by compass point from the city centre. 

* '''White box food''' Quick and simple lunch of starch (rice, pap, sorghum or samp), vegetables (usually squash, beetroot, chakalaka or spinach) and meat. Sold on the streets near most offices, including in the Main Mall, International Finance Park and elsewhere. Between P10 and P20. Usually tasty and filling.

Pleasant garden centre cum cafe cum wedding reception venue set in the fields between Gaborone and Phakalane. Lots of green space, good food, in particular the bream.

''Phakalane'' (10km north of Gaborone)

*<eat name="Drotsky's" alt="" address="" directions="in Phakalane Golf Estate" phone="+ 267 360 4000 " url="http://golfestate.phakalane.com/dining/" hours="lunch & dinner" price="mains P80-P150" lat="" long="">Describing itself as a 'fine dining' restaurant Drotsky's serves up some interesting dishes (biltong pâté, pork baked in almonds, etc.) cooked by a professionally trained chef.  However the menu (together with the wine list) is somewhat aspirational and you may find some dishes not available. Somewhere worth trying if looking for something a cut above the usual steak & chips. </eat>

Desserts are good also (inc. the lovely malva pudding). Atmosphere is pretty nice for a hotel restaurant. </eat>
*<eat name="Bai Sheng" alt="" address="In the Grand Palm hotel" directions="" phone="" url="https://www.facebook.com/baishenggaborone" hours="Lunch & dinner" price="Mains P70-P120" lat="" long="">Opened in 2013 Bai Sheng is one of Gaborone's more sanitised western-flavoured Chinese restaurants. The décor and setting are the highlight - with a tasteful contemporary east Asian theme coupled with a nice outdoor eating area overlooking the kitchen. Food is tasty but unadventurous (although octopus is on the menu). The service is so-so and they will encourage you to over-order (large portion sizes mean you only need 2 mains per 3 people). Avoid the private dining rooms - which they will try and get you to use if you are a large group - the garden is infinitely more pleasant.</eat>

''Westgate Mall''
* '''Chutney's''' – ''(Located in the Westgate Mall on the Western Bypass)''. Good south Indian food, including dosas and lots of Kerela type dishes - however the fish ain't that great. Not much for ambiance but great food. Mains around P45 (veg) to P80.

''Airport Junction''

*<eat name="Cappuccinos" alt="" address="Airport Junction mall" directions="" phone="(+267) 3909947" url="http://www.cappuccinos.co.za/" hours="until 10pm" price="" lat="" long="">Newly opened (2012) branch of the South Africa Italian chain. Menu covers the standard pastas & grills, together with wood-fired pizzas (inc. calzones, which they call stromboli). Food and service are distinctly average. Has a kiddies playground / jungle-gym, which can be annoyingly noisy / a blessing from heaven depending on whether you have kids with you. Pizzas and pastas around P65, grills etc around P100. Cocktails around P50.</eat>
*<eat name="Oceans Basket" alt="" address="Airport Junction mall" directions="" phone="+267 3909932" url="https://www.facebook.com/oceanbasket.bw" hours="Lunch & dinner." price="" lat="" long="">Would normally be considered to fall under the 'bland South African chain' category.  However the Gaborone branch is worth mentioning as good seafood and sushi can be hard-to-find. The tuna is particularly good. Service can be patchy. The prices however are very reasonable, although the portion sizes are small.</eat>

An interesting menu of grills, pastas, great sushi and others - and the kitchen does a good job of all of them, although waiting time can be on the long side. The funky modern décor and good service (although not always guaranteed) make this place one of the city's best eateries. Prices a bit higher than average, mains around P120.</eat>

*<eat name="Europa" alt="" address="Airport Junction mall" directions="" phone="" url="http://www.antimo.co.za/content/locale/en-za/book_europa/Europa-Menu.pdf" hours="breakfast, lunch and dinner" price="Mains P60-P120" lat="" long="">Acceptable cafe/ restaurant newly opened (2012) in Airport Junction. Dishes cover the usual euro/South African mix of pasta, salads and grills. A wood fired pizza oven ensures the best pizzas in town. Staff are still learning so a good idea to point to the thing you want on the menu. Cappuccinos next door has an almost identical menu but is perhaps a tad more upmarket.</eat>

*<eat name="Eastern Crescent" alt="" address="In Sebele mall" directions="next to Toyokey" phone="+267 3951712" url="" hours="lunch & dinner" price="Mains P70" lat="" long="">Perhaps the most upmarket of Gaborone's independent Chinese eateries. Interesting menu, good food, and good service.</eat>

Extensive, if slightly aspirational menu (they never have the lobster curry...) with lots of vegetarian dishes.  Modern decor, and even a small outdoor terrace, which, in typical shopping mall style, overlooks the car park.  Good value with large portions, they even have 350g fillet steak with asain vegetables for P80. </eat>
*<eat name="Mom and Tots" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="">Located in Sebele Mall on the way to Phakalane. Excellent place for parents, with staff who play with your children while you eat. The food is great too! </eat>

Nominally Portuguese menu including a good selection of seafood, and Mozambican beer. The outdoor patio area has a very nice ambiance -check for jazz events.Open for lunch Mon-Fri,dinner Mon-Sat, closed Sundays.  Food is generally of good quality- especially the prawns. Very friendly owners and service.Prices are in expat territory, but worth giving a try.
* '''Sanitas''' – ''(located about 2 KM southeast of Fairgrounds Mall.  Turn beside Naledi Motors (beside mall) and follow signs)''  A hidden gem.  Actually a garden center but with a large cafe for breakfast/lunch/brunch 6 days/week (Closed Monday).  Has a children's playground also.  
*<eat name="News Café" alt="" address="Village district" directions="At the Mondior Summit Hotel" phone="" url="" hours="6:30-22:30" price="" lat="" long="">Conveniently located for those staying at the Mondior Summit, News Café is popular even with outside guests. The menu centres on "European style" dishes, but with some interesting twists. The place really shines in the cocktail department, though. On Friday and Saturday nights, the music is often cranked up loud even though there is no dance floor, so sit outside if you want to make conversation.  Staff are young and sometimes inexperienced, but most of the time the service is quite good.  Prices are somewhat above the regular fare in Gaborone, but then so is the quality. They have Happy Hour from 5pm-6pm. Buy 1 get 1 free on all cocktails.</eat>

''Africa Mall''

*<eat name="Gold Coin" alt="" address="" directions="in Africa Mall" phone="" url="" hours="lunch & dinner" price="P30 for a simple noodle dish. P70 for a green curry & rice" lat="" long="">The only Thai restaurant in the country? Well almost. The mandarin on the sign lets slip that this is a chinese resto with a smattering of Thai dishes on the menu and Bangkok posters on the wall. Still if you are craving coconut milk with your curry its the only option in town.</eat>

*<eat name="Cafe Tempo" alt="" address="Africa Mall" directions="" phone="" url="" hours="open all day" price="" lat="" long="">Simple joint serving up local favourites (chicken with pap, beef with rice etc.) for about P25 a plate.</eat>

Note: food can take up to one hour, especially if with a large group. Mains around BWP60-75, but the extras are pricey. However it is open late (kitchen closes at 22:00).

* '''Abyssinia Ethiopian Cafe''' +267 318 7992] - Botswana's only Ethiopian cuisine serving up pretty good injera with all the trimmings for P99 and delicious goat stew for BWP80, together with some Botswana food, and beef lasagna.

This place is also used as a wedding venue, and has a little kiddies playground and garden. The rump steak and chips for P45 is probably the best value in town.

'''Chain restaurants with multiple outlets'''

Located in the African Mall, Game City Mall, BBS Mall, Riverwalk Mall, and the Main Mall, at the east end adjacent to Orange. For a better taste than the commercial Nandos why not try Barcelos which is just across from Nandos in African mall. You won't be disappointed.
* '''Barcelos''' [http://barcelos.co.bw/] - A rival to Nando's in the battle of the chicken. Particularly nice outlet in Sebele Mall.

===Groceries===
In general, prices for western goods are at EU prices; local goods (corn meal) are inexpensive at grocery stores.
*'''Woolworths Food''' is in several of the main malls and has much higher quality produce and more European food selections.  If you want exotic fruits or vegetables or good cheese, definitely the store to go to.
*'''SquareMart''' in the CBD is a good supermarket - just below Woolworths in quality, has a particularly good bakery.  
*'''SuperSpar''' and '''Pick'n'Pay''' are solid mid-range supermarket options. Depending on the branch, Spar is usually has the better quality and better service.
*'''Choppies''' and '''OK Foods''' are more down-market - perhaps a little cheaper for some items. Service tends to be atrocious. Are located in all areas of Gaborone. 
*'''Choppies Westgate Mall''' deserves special mention - described as the 'Woolworths for the Indian Community' the Westgate mall branch stocks a huge variety of south Asian produce, including imported Indian rice, spices, lentils etc. A good place to stock your kitchen.
*For a budget, buy a pie at Pie Time and then a drink at SPAR! (BWP13 for a full meal).
* In all super market malls, there is a grocery store.

==Drink==
The Batswana like to drink. Indeed, after raising cattle, drinking could be considered the national pastime. Sadly excessive drinking and the problems this causes are not uncommon. The government has responded with public education campaigns, and slapped an alcohol levy on drink sales.

For the tourist there are not many options for a bar or pub style drink. Most drinking is done in male-dominated shebeen type places, which whilst interesting are not particularly pleasant places to spend much time. If you are looking for a sundowner picking a hotel or restaurant with outdoor seating is probably your best bet.   

*<drink name="Absolut Bar" alt="" address="Lansmore Hotel, CBD" directions="" phone="" url="http://www.scribd.com/doc/175323600/absolut-bar-menu-Oct-2013" hours="12 noon to late. Closes 7pm Sundays" price="up to P100 entry on Fridays & Saturdays" lat="" long="">Over a year after opening the hotel, the roof-top bar has finally opened (Sept 2013), offering drinkers a superb sundowner location to end the day. A steep P100 is charged to non-hotel residents at weekends, presumably an attempt to keep the rif-raf out. </drink>
* '''Bull and Bush''' - An English-style pub and a common ex-pat hangout with big-screen TVs and pool tables. Also features dancing on the weekends.  The food is good, especially the pizza and ribs. The last Wednesday of the month is quiz night (or quizzo) where teams compete on trivia for prizes. Monday night is Rib night and gets very busy.
* '''O'Hagans Irish Pub''', A South African chain located in Game City Mall. Standard, unimpressive pub food. Good mix of ex-pats and Batswana. Good choice to watch big screen sports.
* '''Club Satchmo''' Ntimbale Rd, G-West Phase 2 [http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=7&aid=816&dir=2010/March/Thursday11] - Jazz club with decent drinks and great music.

Sky Lounge offers great views and comfortable surroundings in which to sip your drink. Recently (2014) abandoned its 'members only' policy so you can now just turn up, although entrance is charged on Friday and Saturday nights. You can also order food from Liban downstairs and hence enjoy your hummus whilst soaking up the view.</drink>
===Clubs===
Covers range from 20 to 100 Pula. Many have dress codes. And like most places, the popular nights at each place vary. Check with local Batswana for more information.

* '''Trekkers''' [http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=7&aid=1890&dir=2012/July/Wednesday25] Impressive and fairly upmarket nightclub in Mogoditshane on the Molepolole road just past the army camp. 
* '''Bull and Bush''' See above. 
* '''Boulevard''' (Phakalane) Busy club that plays top-40 hits and has a nice outdoor patio. 
* '''Cigar Lounge''' (Phakalane Golf Resort) A cigar lounge that turns into a busy club on weekends. 
* "Notwane Club" - near the National Stadium, used mainly to host private or special dj events

==Sleep==

Gaborone compares to South Africa in terms of accommodation choice and costs. There are a handful of large chain hotels costing P800+ offering conference facilities, curio shops, evening restaurants, gyms and bars - and dozens of smaller guesthouses, lodges and bed & breakfasts varying in quality, cleanliness and price. However it is difficult to go much below P400 per night for a room. For those staying for months rather than days there are a handful of relativity expensive serviced apartments, although these are often full. Finally if you have your own car and want to keep away from the city there are some good options out in the bush 15km to the south of Gabs that cost about the same as a guesthouse in town.

*<sleep name="Masa Square Hotel" alt="" address="" directions="In the CBD" phone="+267 315 9954" url="http://web.masasquarehotel-gaborone.com" checkin="" checkout="" price="" lat="" long="">Gaborone's flashy new business hotel, opened in June 2012 and is already something of a landmark. Architecture is akin to what you find in the financial districts of European capitals. The highlight is the rooftop pool. Rack rates from US$250 (P1,750), but specials are available during quiet periods (eg P800 for bed & breakfast). </sleep>
*<sleep name="Avani Gaborone (ex-Gaborone Sun)" alt="" address="" directions="next to the golf course east of the city centre" phone="+267 361 6000" url="http://www.avanihotels.com/gaborone/" checkin="" checkout="" price="From P900 per room per night" lat="" long="">Once the premier hotel in the city, the Gabs Sun is now getting a little old and flabby, with the better staff having been poached by the Monidor and Grand Palm hotels, and hence service can be a bit grumpy and slapdash. Nevertheless it has a lovely pool and bar area (happy hour 6-7pm), and some of the rooms (in particular rooms 203 – 231 odd numbers) are nice, catching the morning sun glinting off the pool. Facilities comprise ubiquitous casino (read: slot machines), squash courts, small gym, conference facilities, buffet breakfast, pay-as-you-go internet etc. At P900+ a night its poor value, but with most guests being Government / businesspeople it can get away with these rates.</sleep>

Bordering 5 star status, this hotel is a modern oasis with a casino to the left and a gigantic and impressive conference centre (The GICC) to the right, marked by an eagle figure flying over a fountain. Out back the hotel has a large swimming pool and a moderately sized lakes that birds frequent. There is also a pool bar that serves food, a childrens playground and further afield their is a boma that does barbecue (braai) events and parties. There is also a tennis court and plenty of lush green grass. Inside there is a squash court and a leisure centre.  The Grand Palm is very much a resort hotel and is not a good choice if you don't have  your own transport. Check for specials.</sleep>

==Contact==

There are internet cafes all over the city, in practically every shopping centre.  Prices range from P10-P20 per hour.  Many cafes have memberships of 5-20 hours which provide cheaper rates.  Network speeds are moderate to good.  Many cafes also offer photocopying services.

==Stay Safe==
People in Botswana are very friendly and the crime rate is relatively low. However the recent contrast between rich and poor has seen crime on the rise. Always be aware of your surroundings. When going out at night to a restaurant take a taxi called from your hotel. Take the mobile number of your driver and call him when you want to go home. Do not walk around at night away from places with lots of people. At night, do not walk back 5 blocks to your hotel from a pub. Do walk around during the day. Basic common sense will keep you safe from criminals. You should have a safe and pleasant trip as hundreds of thousands of other people have each year. If you're staying at a hotel it is safe, but beware of some residential areas affected with burglars.

Stay alert when driving in cars for smash and grabs when using mobile devices near traffic lights (talking on the phone without a handsfree kit is illegal anyways). 
Beware when walking at evenings/night in street corners as muggings occur, displays of wealth and property make you a target, particularly tempting objects such as mobile phones, laptops.
Crowded public areas are a heaven for pick pockets. Be cautious especially if you are a women with a handbag.Areas often affected with such crimes are near Old Naledi, Mogoditsane, Broadhurst, Phase I and II.
Police are honest and helpful but sometimes can be late to respond.

When driving to rural areas be extra careful as cows and wildlife often walk in the middle of the road. Be prepared to stop for a herd of goats. Do not drive at night unless you know what you are doing. Drunk driving on weekends and holidays is common and dangerous. Drivers do not look out for or give way to pedestrians. Be very cautious when crossing any street day or night. Do not immediate ly get out of your car if bumped/hit from behind - drive to a public place (service station/restaurant) to inspect for damage. Do enjoy the beauty!
