{{pagebanner|Kiruna Banner.jpg}}

'''Kiruna''' (pronounced ''key-rune-ah'') in [[Norrbotten]] county, [[Norrland]], is the northernmost and one of the most unusual towns in [[Sweden]].  With its 18,000 inhabitants, it is the largest town in Swedish [[Lapland (Sweden)|Lapland]].

==Understand==
Kiruna houses the largest underground mine (iron ore) in the world, and is also known for the satellite/space projects, the Sami culture, the long winters, its modern town planning, its beautiful church and town hall, the Icehotel, and the easy access to the wilderness and adventure of northern Lapland, including Sweden's highest mountain, Kebnekaise. 

At N67°49<nowiki>'48''</nowiki> latitude, Kiruna is located about 145 km north of the Arctic Circle, making it possible to experience the midnight sun and polar night there. This means that the sun will shine 24 hours a day between roughly the last week of May until the middle of July. The opposite happens in the winter -- from the first week of December until the second week of January, Kiruna has zero hours of sunlight per day. However, this doesn't mean that it's completely dark; when the night is the longest, there is daylight/twilight for around one hour during midday.

The Kiruna Municipality includes several small villages and settlements scattered around a rather large wilderness area approximately the size of [[Slovenia]]. The biggest and most visited include: Jukkasjärvi, Abisko, Karesuando and Vittangi.

==Get in==

===By Plane===
SAS [http://www.sas.se] has direct flights to Kiruna (also via [[Umeå]]) from [[Stockholm]]'s Arlanda airport. Students and youths (under the age of 26) in particular can find cheap tickets with SAS.
Barents AirLink (Nordkalottflyg) [http://www.barentsairlink.se] has flights from Luleå.

The small airport is located a few kilometers outside the city centre.  There is an airport bus waiting for every flight from Stockholm-Arlanda.  In the evening or on weekends a taxi (should be pre-ordered, otherwise very long waiting time) or pre-ordered coach is pretty much the only way to get anywhere (or hitchhiking), but that can be very expensive. Another option is to walk 1.2 km from the airport until you reach the E10 highway or to Tuolluvaaravägen, and take a local bus from that stop. It runs many times during weekdays, a few times in the weekends [http://www.ltnbd.se/tidtabeller/31/0/].

===By Train===
SJ [http://www.sj.se] operates two daily night trains, from [[Göteborg]] and [[Stockholm]] continuing north along the eastern parts of Sweden passing cities like [[Uppsala]], [[Gävle]] and [[Boden]] where sometimes a change of trains are required to get to Kiruna (otherwise you'll end up in [[Luleå]]). The travel time from Stockholm is about 17 hours. Some trains continue to [[Narvik]].

Two types of sleeping cars are available: ''liggvagn'' with six seats/beds in each compartment, and the slightly more expensive ''sovvagn'' with 2-3 (softer) beds. Cheapskates might try out ''sittvagn'', but 17 hours in a seat is not a pleasant experience. An onboard restaurant serves dinner and breakfast; it also doubles as a bar during the evening. Prices, However, are high. Bringing your own food is allowed, but consuming alcohol is not (although the enforcement is quite lax).

Since 2013, the train station in Kiruna has moved 2km away from the city centre. Walking is possible, but not recommended. There is a free shuttlebus for every departure and arrival, and the bus starts at Kiruna bus station in the city centre.

===By Bus===
It is possible to take long distance buses between cities in Norrbotten County, such as [[Luleå]], [[Gällivare]], [[Jokkmokk]], [[Haparanda]], etc. [http://www.ltnbd.se]

===By Car===
It is by all means possible to rent a car and drive to Kiruna, but keep in mind that it is very far away from all other major cities, the roads are quite narrow, and a little bit too often not in a good shape. Speed limits are low and speeding tickets high. This is not totally without reason, due to weather conditions and the frequency of wildlife such as hares, reindeer and moose on the road, which can make the trip a little bit more interesting than bargained for.

The hazards of driving a car in the north during the winter, when a car breakdown in the middle of nowhere actually can be life-threatening due to the cold, should not be underestimated. The cellphone coverage can be quite sparse so warm blankets, extra clothes etc. should always be stored in the car during winter for emergencies.
The road distances from Kiruna are: [[Gällivare]](closest city) 115km, [[Luleå]] 344Km, [[Umeå]] 600Km, [[Stockholm]] 1240Km

In 2017, the Icehotel for the first time opened in the summer in a permanently kept cold building structure.
You can stay overnight in the cold Icehotel rooms or in nearby warm cottages.

==Nightlife==
Okay, lets face it, the night-life in Kiruna is hardly award-winning in any way. This is a rather small city and does not offer great variety. The crowds going out are most often the same people from time to time, and the chances are quite high that most locals going out already know each other, if not as friends then at least by name and/or rumor. This is both a blessing and a curse, depending on circumstances. People tend to drink quite heavily and most would never talk to strangers, but some would love to -- don't give up!
However, this does not mean that going out in Kiruna is not fun. Sure after a few times it starts to feel a bit repetitive (which might not always be bad), but going out a night or two can often be quite fun; just don't expect too much, take it as it is, ignore things that bother you and enjoy the night!

The most popular place is currently the nightclub at Hotel Ferrum, mostly at room 208, which usually has an age restriction of 18.
Royal (formerly known as Arran) is for the younger crowd and thus often a little bit noisier. From time to time they have 30++ nights also. The two central bars, Landströms and Bishops Arms, can offer less crowds and a good enough environment for a beer or two after a long day.
Friday and Saturday are the main days for going out, but Wednesdays ("little Saturday") can sometimes get lively as well.

==Get out==
In the mountainous areas to the west of Kiruna are several national parks, e.g. [[Abisko]]. The railway to the port town of [[Narvik]] in [[Norway]] offers excellent views year-round.

* '''[[Space]]''' &ndash; Virgin Galactic has plans to build a Spaceport here, offering sub-orbital flights.
* '''[[Nikkaluokta]]''' &ndash; Nice drive down to Nikkaluokta. Along the way, you may see some moose. When you reach the very end of the road there is a little cafe that serves lunch and some nice sandwiches like smoked salmon or reindeer.
