'''Managua''' is the capital of  [[Nicaragua]].

==Understand==

Managua is the capital city of Nicaragua. It is also the largest city in Nicaragua. The city has a population of roughly 1,800,000, composed predominantly of mestizos and whites; making it the second most populous city in Central America after Guatemala City.

Managua's location between the rival cities of León and Granada made it a logical and ideal compromise site in determining the nation's capital. Managua's economy is based mainly on trade. The city is Nicaragua's chief trading center for coffee, cotton, and other crops. It is also an important industrial center. Its chief products for trade include beer, coffee, matches, textiles, and shoes.

The city has been witness to the rise and fall of political powers throughout Nicaragua's history and suffered devastating earthquakes in 1931 and 1972. Managua is the economic, political, cultural, commercial and industrial center of Nicaragua. Since the 1972 earthquake, residential and business areas have been built on the outskirts of Managua. 
Residents of the city and of the department of Managua are called ''Managuas'

The neighborhood Jorge Dimitrov (near TicaBus), while relatively quiet, is known as being less safe than other areas of the city. It is advised to not wander the streets after dark and avoid being a target (no flashy jewelry). That being said, there are some great budget hotels in the area and is very convenient for travelers coming in from TicaBus.   

===Budget===

Nicaragua is one of Latin America's economically friendly destinations. Its hotel, food and transportation costs are a fraction of its neighbors. Eating at local restaurants is extremely inexpensive, and for $30, a meal for four can be served at these locations. Fast food locations are relatively similar to those in North America and Europe in terms of price. High-end restaurants are also affordable for people with 'Western' salaries. Foreign cuisine, like French and Italian specialties, are served at high-end locations for a lower price than found in North American and Western European cities. Transportation is relatively inexpensive with bus trips for less than US$ 0.50 and low-cost taxi services if you are able to deal with the drivers. Hotels, as anywhere, vary from cheap hostels to full service five stars that can run into the thousands of cordobas.

===By bus===
There are direct bus routes from all major cities stopping at various points.

Buses from Rivas, [[Masaya]], [[Granada (Nicaragua)|Granada]], [[San Marcos(Nicaragua)|San Marcos]] and some from [[Jinotepe]] come in through the southeastern Carretera Masaya entrance and pass by the Centroamerica rotonda before going to either ''Mercado Huembes'' or UCA.

Buses from Jinotepe also come in through carretera Sur stopping by 7 Sur, a hub to go to via Carretera Nueva and Vieja Leon and C. Sur.

To go to the mountains in the north or the caribbean coast, buses leave from ''Mercado El Mayoreo''.

Driving directions in Managua are not typical. In fact, they are often regarded as unique and confusing. The major earthquakes have left the city without a consistent and clear street address system. Although the government has made attempts to address this problem, directions are given relative to landmarks and distances. For example, most addresses are given based on landmarks and with the directions al lago - North, towards the lake, arriba/abajo (east/west) and al sur (to the South).  For example, to instruct a taxi driver to drop you off at Casa Ben Linder [http://casabenlinder.org/], the directions are "en barrio Moseñor Lezcano, de donde fue el Banco Popular, 2 cuadras al lago, 2 cuadras arriba", which means, "in the Monseñor Lezcano neighborhood, from where People's Bank used to be, 2 blocks towards the lake and 2 blocks East."

===By bus===

Please note that although the local bus network is extensive and organised, a recent smart card ticketing system has been introduced, making it impossible for visitors to get about. Getting the card is not simple, and bus drivers refuse to take cash. Either look for a bus that accepts cash and card, slightly difficult, or persuade some stranger to accept you on their card. The system has rightly caused lots of controversy in the city. Do note that buses that leave to other cities or towns don't use this card system, pay with currency.

EDIT June 2019: this is not true. Buses take cash and tickets are 2.5 cordobas. The 102 takes you all the way from the Mercado Mayoreo to the Statue of Montoya via the Mercado Oriental.

* There is an [http://rutas.mapanica.net/ online map of Managua's public transportation] and [http://rutas.mapanica.net/mapa schematic (paper) map].

*110 goes from mercado Israel Lewites (buses to León) to mercado Roberto Huembes (buses to Granada), passing on the way by the UCA, where microbuses leave for both Granada and León, as well as Masaya and other cities.

*Buses to Granada, Leon, Jinotepe, Masaya, and Chinandega are also available at UCA (Universidad Centroamericana). Several city buses connect through UCA as well (102, 103, 105, 110, 111, 114, 119, 168).

* A regular trip within Managua costs 2.5 Córdobas. Most buses can only be boarded with a "TUC" card, you can get from [https://mpeso.net/ MPeso]. In bigger bus stops people will pass their card for C$5 for you. And every hour there should be at least one "Mixto" bus, that allows cash payment. You may ask also always someone as the local people are very eager to help.

There are two things that make Managua special when compared to other Latin American cities. One is the fact that the former center was completely destroyed by the 1972 earthquake and only recently rebuilt. It used to be a barren wasteland for years. Now there are squares, parks and new government buildings. The main boulevards are lined with colorful artificial trees, illuminated at night as if to express a festive mood. The other factor is the presence and symbols of a (once) revolutionary government that along with its people proved strong enough to resist USA dominance and intervention. Nicaraguans are proud of their history and feel connected with other Latin American countries with a similar background like Cuba, Venezuela, Grenada, Bolivia and Chile under Allende. For this reason there is a big Chavez square with an image of the former leader, a puerto Salvador Allende etc.

It's where everyone who was anyone stayed in Nicaragua until the early 1990's.  The EEBI (the elite force of the Guardia Nacional during Somoza's time) and the military academy were a short walk away. It's as if the U.S. advisers and politicos had a dorm right next to the Somoza government.  Howard Hughes stayed here when he was in Nicaragua in the 1970's.  It is said that he rented three floors for weeks and demanded that the staff not rotate.  He met with Somoza about some business, but nothing came of it.  Rooms go for $90-120 a night.

==Stay safe==
*Though Nicaragua has been historically ranked as the safest country by INTERPOL, Managua is another story, and crime is highly opportunistic in nature.  '''Targets are often tourists or outsiders''', unlike drug trafficker and user related crime elsewhere in Latin America.  

*It is also advised that tourists refrain from using foreign currency in local transactions. It is best to have the local currency instead of having to convert with individuals on streets or non-tourist areas. Banks in Nicaragua require identification for any currency conversion transactions, it is best to utilize ATM machines that dispense the local currency. When using ATM machines, utilize precautions and be aware of your surroundings. Make sure you are in a well frequented area and ensure yourself that the ATM has not been altered in any way or form. Some thieves alter ATM machines with chips that can steal credit card numbers and personal information. This type of crime is rare, but it should be noted that an increase in foreign tourism has stimulated the increase of this crime. Tourists are also advised to make sure that they stay on top of their credit card or debit card transactions via online banking. Any suspicious transactions should be reported immediately. 

*Traveling around Managua is relatively simple, but as in any major city, tourists are advised to exercise basic caution. When traveling to the ''Mercado Oriental,'' tourists are advised to go in groups and avoid the use of chains, necklaces and other valuables. Although Police Officers are available in and around the market, the market tends to be very full and thus it can be hard to find any person who steals your valuables. Tourists are also advised to be cautions around the outskirts of downtown, the area between MetroCentro and the BAC building. Several muggings have occured around this area. The area around the tica bus station has been deemed unsafe for tourists by the Nicaraguan police due to the high volumes of people moving around.  If you must go, take a taxi to and from there.

*When traveling around the city of Managua or around Nicaragua, there are several transporation alternatives. Popular options include buses and taxis, both of which have different rider standards and different precautions.

*Buses in Nicaragua tend to be old school buses that transport people and goods to market. These are colloquially called ''Chicken Buses.'' Much like the Argentine collectivo, it uses the honor system on travelers and charges based on the distance one travels. It is relatively the most inexpensive option, allowing tourists to travel to major tourist attractions and other destinations. However, these buses can be extremely crowded and tight in terms of space. An overhead rack tends to be provided for the storage of bags and other items, but tourists are recommended to keep their bags at hand, in their sight, at all times. If you are carrying something valuable and fear the potential loss of theft of it, you are advised to put a lock on your bag. Tourists are also advised to not carry large sums of money in their pockets. On crowded buses (especially during rush hour), thieves can rob you without you noticing. In addition, do not wear any expensive jewelry on the bus. It can be taken from you without your notice due to the high volumes of passengers that board buses. Buses in local urban and interurban routes are not air conditioned, and thus, tourists should ensure that their window is open (provided they are seated).

*There are also ''Express Buses'' in the form of mini-vans. These buses provide express inter-city transport at a higher price compared to the standard local ''Chicken Bus.'' This form of transport is also cost-friendly, but extremely tight in terms of space. Tourists cannot carry any heavy cargo. Small purses and bookbags are fine, but tourists are advised to exercise the same caution as they would on a ''Chicken Bus.''

*There are two forms of Taxis in Managua: Collectivos and Privados (Collectives and Privates).

*Collective taxis work similar to buses: they pick up passengers on the route that you travel on. Usually this means that 3-4 passengers ride in a car with a common or similar destination. This is the fastest transport available in Managua, the cost is also friendly given that the fare is split evenly among the riders. However, collective taxis are also risky given the fact that organized crime has flourished in this transportation sector because of fixed passengers. In other words, drivers already know who they pick up and thus mug the one extra passenger. This crime, however, is not common, but it is the one with the highest chance of being mugged.

*Private taxis are the most popular option among tourists. The taxi is yours and picks up no one along the way. The fastest service in Managua also is the most expensive. These taxis have the most space and the most personal protection. If you have cargo, ensure that you hail a taxi that has a trunk. Not all cars are equipped with one. 

*When riding taxis, tourists are strongly recommended to close their windows. Leaving windows open allows one to be robbed while in the car and exposes one to beggars and other service givers. Most tourists consider this a nuisance, and so do locals. Air conditioners do not always work on street-hailed cars. In any case, radio-dispached cars are readily available (particularly from resorts and hotels) and offer the same amenities luxury car services offer at roughly the same price as their North American counterparts.

The bus station in town is walking distance to almost everything.

Bring a camera.

*'''Ometepe''' - In the middle of epic Lake Nicaragua (19th largest in the world) and a short taxi, then ferry ride from Granada you have Ometepe, an island of two jungle covered tropical oasis home to great eco tourism, virgin jungle and great hikes to waterfalls and the summit of either the (active) volcano Conception (ten hours round trip) or the (inactive) Maderas (eight hours round trip). You are required by law to hire a guide for these hikes. There is an incredible and rather secret swim spot called Ojos del Agua, which is a great pool with a rope swing in a wonderful spot and for a very good price.  Also popular are shore side horseback riding along the roads until you reach one of several crystal clear water lagoons up on the mountainside over 300 meters across. Other activities on the island include bike rentals to explore, and kayak/paddle boat rentals.  

*'''Masaya Volcano National Park''' - Excellent park featuring a smoking, active volcano, a visitors center with historical and geological displays. Watch the crater fumes rise to the sky. Climb the steps to the Bobadilla Cross. The steps to the cross are closed due to instability in the ground that supports them.  See the flocks of bright green parrots who live in the volcano's walls. Guided walks to a bat-filled cave are available in the evenings. 

*'''Caribbean Coast''' - Daily flights are available to Nicaragua's Atlantic coastline, where tropical reefs and small offshore islands offer a very different view of the country.

The market and beach front offer extensive dining opportunties at $5 a big dinner. There is something for every pocket. While in San Juan del Sur try to visit nearby practically unpopulated beaches of majagual and marsella, among others.

Rooms average of $75 all inclusive (buffet, soft and alcoholic drinks). 

*'''Volcano Cerro Negro''' - A fine black sand active volcano piercing the clouds, several companies take you up to the top slopes where you go down on a sled. It's dependent on the rider but speeds of 30 mph have been achieved! Be prepared though, this is not the safest of adventures and certainly not a good idea for kids! The black volcanic sand is hot and sharp and injuries, while usually rather minor, are quite common.  For the adrenaline seekers, it is still a worthy and once in a lifetime opportunity!
