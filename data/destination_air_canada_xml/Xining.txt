'''Xining''' (西宁; ''Xīníng''; Tibetan: ''Sulang'') is the capital of [[Qinghai]] Province and the capital of Xining City District, a prefecture of Qinghai.

==Understand==
[[Image:Xining at night.JPG|thumb|Xining at night]]
The large city of Xining acts as one of the major gateways to the Tibetan Plateau. It is an ancient highland city on the Yellow River which offers many scenic spots and historical sites. Although the city itself has a strong Islamic flavor, as it is home to many Hui people, you will start getting a more Tibetan feel as you move away from the city.

==Get in==

===By plane===
'''Xining Airport (IATA: XNN)''', located 15km south, southeast of the city, has flights to [[Beijing]], [[Chengdu]], [[Chongqing]], [[Golmud]], [[Guangzhou]], [[Lhasa]], [[Shanghai]], [[Shenyang]], [[Urumqi]], and [[Xian]]. Shenzhen Airlines fly into Xining from Hong Kong.

The '''airport bus''' makes a run from somewhere in town 2 hours before the flight departs and heads back to the city centre whenever a flight lands. The bus stand is directly in front of the exit door. The 30min ride to/from the airport ¥21. For taxi, it costs ¥100 to/from the airport.

===By train===
Many useful train tickets are completely bought up days before travel - buy well in advance (train tickets are available 60 days in advance online or 58 days in advance in person), or find black market connections and be prepared for a premium that may be well in excess of the ticket price. (eg 1,500 yuan for a 500 yuan Lhasa ticket)

* [[Lhasa]] - takes about 21 hours, 495 RMB for a bed

High-speed rail services from Xining to Lanzhou, northern Gansu, and Xinjiang opened December 2014. These trains are much faster than normal trains, but are also more expensive.

* [[Yushu]] - takes about 14-18 hours.only 10hours by mini van 240yuan Yushu-Xining. 200 (229 in Oct 2019) yuan Xining-Yushu (the price difference comes from that on the way back to Yushu.drivers are able to bypass Yushu toll gate)

There are also buses for [[Golmud]], [[Lhasa]] and [[Yinchuan]] at the western end of the square in front of the train station.

==Get around==

===By bus===
There are plenty of buses that get you around town. The most useful is bus #1 that runs through the centre of town along Dajie to the train/bus station. All fares are ¥1 (¥2-4 as of Oct 2019) regardless of distance. Please note that most of the bus services end around 9pm, and maybe even earlier during the winter season.

There is a medium-distance bus station located on the North-West corner of KangLe intersection on the east side of the city. From here you can get buses to smaller areas such as DaTong (¥6) and HuZhu (¥12) and HuZhe BeiShan forest Park.

===By taxi===
Taxis run on the meter (¥8 flagfall) but some drivers are open to negotiation, especially late at night.

===Budget===
There are dozens of small guesthouses near the train and long distance bus station. Look for the characters "招待所," which in this part of town are on every other building. Most places seem aimable to taking foreigners, and prices range from ¥10 in a grimy four-room bunk (expect the other occupants to smoke in the room all night long) to ¥100 for a deluxe double.  More guesthouses can be found around the town's West Gate, or Ximen.

==Get out==
Be aware that pickpockets operate outside the train station near the buses where the police do not go. 

* Ta'er Si (Kunbum) Monastery (塔爾寺) - one of the most important Tibetan Buddhist sites in China, in the village of [[Huangzhong]].
* [[Tongren]] - 
* Tu Minority Village - located at Weiyuanzhen Old Village, 32 km from Xining
* [[Qinghaihu National Park]] (青海湖 - also called Lake Koko Nor) - this 5,694 km lake is the largest lake in China. Buses leave all day from Bayi Passenger Transport Station ( 八一客运站). Ticket price is RMB 35 and RMB 45 for the return bus ride. The trip takes about 1,5 hour. 
* [[HuZhu BeiShan National Forest Park]]
* [[Guide]] (贵德） - Take a bus to this charming, predominantly tibetan village, beyond the southern mountains. 
Trips from Xining travel agencies offer apparently cheap 60 yuan day trips to Qinghaihu National Park.  This price does not include entry to 丹噶尔 old town (50 yuan), 赞普林卡 (40 yuan), 日月山（40 yuan) or the wharf at Qinghaihu (100 yuan) [the 'park' itself].  The last of these seems the most overpriced for what it is - but you are expected to pay.  There may be a couple of forced shopping stops, including a minimum 30-minute wait at a jade/crystal sales outlet.
