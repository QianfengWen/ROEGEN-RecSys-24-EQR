'''Tauranga''' [http://www.tauranga.co.nz], population approx. 160,000 is the major city of the western [[Bay of Plenty]] on the east coast of the North Island of [[New Zealand]]. It is the fifth largest city in the country, and is 105 km east of [[Hamilton (New Zealand)|Hamilton]] and 85 km north of [[Rotorua]], and about 20 km north of [[Te Puke]].

==Understand==
Tauranga is located at the head of a large harbour which extends along the western Bay of Plenty, and is protected by Matakana Island. The town and headland of Mount Maunganui stand at the entrance to the harbour, five kilometres north of Tauranga. "The Mount", as it is known, is often regarded as a satellite town of Tauranga, although it is technically a suburb. Its is one of the major resort cities in New Zealand, famous for its beautiful beaches. 

The name Tauranga comes from Maori, it roughly translates to "a sheltered anchorage".

Due to its sheltered position on the east coast, Tauranga enjoys a warm, dry climate. This has made it a popular location to retire to. During the summer months the population swells as the holidaymakers descend on the city.

Much of the countryside surrounding Tauranga is horticultural land, used to grow a wide range of fresh produce for both domestic consumption and export. The area is particularly well known for growing tangelos (a grapefruit / tangerine cross) and kiwifruit. The Port of Tauranga also experiences brisk but seasonal shipping traffic and is a regular stop off for both container ships and luxury cruise liners.

[[File:Cruise Ship In Port Of Tauranga.jpg|thumb|250 px|Cruise Ship In Port Of Tauranga]]
Centrally located in the Bay of Plenty and home to a deep water harbor, the '''Port of Tauranga''' is a popular cruise hub with over 85 ships per year. The cruise port itself is actually located in the township of Mt. Maunganui, a laid back beach town which is 7km from the streets of downtown Tauranga. 

From the cruise ship dock at '''Salisbury Wharf''', it’s only a five-minute walk into Mt. Maunganui. Many cruise lines also provide shuttles to the town’s i-SITE visitor center, and all of the attractions in Mt. Maunganui are within a ten-minute radius of the cruise port. 

In order to reach the city of Tauranga, you can ride the public BayBus Routes 1 or 2 with direct service from Mount Maunganui to Tauranga CBD. Leaving relatively frequently from the Port's i-SITE visitor centre on Salisbury Ave, the bus costs $3 one-way, and it takes 20 minutes to get to the middle of the Tauranga CBD. You should get off at the Tauranga CBD i-SITE visitor centre and, from there, all of Tauranga's top attractions, shopping and dining options are within a 15-minute walk.  Alternatively, you can take a taxi (~$20) for the ten minutes ride to Tauranga. Or, if you would prefer to hop back on a boat, there is a ferry service between Salisbury Wharf and the Tauranga waterfront which is run by Tauranga Water Transport. 

The Tauranga cruise port is also convenient for day trips to Rotorua, where steaming geysers and geothermal wonders create a fascinating, otherworldly landscape.  To reach Rotorua, many cruise lines offer shore excursions which provide transport for the one-hour journey.

==Get around==
The first place a visitor should go to is the '''Tauranga i-SITE Visitor Information Centre'''[http://www.bayofplentynz.com/], 95 Willow St in the heart of the Tauranga CBD for local tourist information, maps, bookings, and tickets.  From there, most of Tauranga's top attractions, shopping and dining options are within a 15-minute walk.  The free ''Tauranga City Walkways'' pamphlet (from the i-SITE) details walks around Tauranga and Mt Maunganui.

These cost $10 and are available from the bus driver, or the central Tauranga i-Site, and save you 20% on single-ride fares.
