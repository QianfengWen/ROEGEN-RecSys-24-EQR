'''Bloemfontein''' (''Fountain of flowers''), [http://www.bloemfontein.co.za/], is the judicial capital of [[South Africa]]. It is also the capital of the [[Free State|Free State Province]]. 

==Understand==
Bloemfontein was founded in 1846 and now has a population of around half a million people.

J. R. R. Tolkien, author of '''The Lord of the Rings''' was born in Bloemfontein in 1892.

In 1923, the African National Congress (ANC) political party was founded in Bloemfontein.

Today, Bloemfontein is a compact city surrounded by sprawling suburbs.

Happily, the city centre is safe to walk around during the day, but many of the city's activities are focused on the Waterfront and Mimosa malls and on the large sporting complex. Second Avenue, north of the Waterfront mall, has the majority of the city's bars and restaurants.

==Get in==

===By plane===
Bloemfontein Airport [http://www.airports.co.za] is just outside the city and a number of flights to major South African cities take off from here, operated by South African Airways [http://www.flysaa.com] and SA Airlink [http://flyairlink.com]. and Mango airlines [http://flymango.co.za/] fly to [[Cape Town]]

See [[Air travel in South Africa]] for more information.

===By train===
Bloemfontein is a major rail junction in the middle of [[South Africa]], but many of the trains are not running anymore. From here, Spoornet [http://www.transnetfreightrail-tfr.net/Pages/default.aspx]  operates regular trains to all points of the country : '''south''' to  [[Port Elizabeth]], [[East London]] and [[Mthatha]], '''west''', '''north''' to [[Johannesburg]].

The train station is in the city centre, on the corner of Maitland and Harvey streets.

The '''N1''', '''N6''' and '''N8''' national highways meet in Bloemfontein, making it easily reachable from any part of the country.

==Do==
* Go to the '''Waterfront'''
* Play a round of '''golf'''
* Visit one of the numerous '''game reserves''' in the area and go sightseeing / hunting
* Take a walk through the tree-lined '''President Brand Street''' and visit the various '''museums'''
* Take a drive through the '''northern suburbs''' and see the lush gardens
* Visit the '''City Zoo''' just behind the Waterfront shopping mall.  This zoo is home to a stuffed [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liger Liger] a cross between a lion and a tiger, that was bred at the zoo in the 1930s. This specimen holds the world record for being the largest ever living cat. And at 798kgs you can see why!

it apart are the lions in the small enclosure in the middle of the park – although the enclosure is big enough to mean that you are not
guaranteed to see the cats. The rest of the reserve is pleasant with open plains, wooded areas and a dam – there are no dangerous animals in the main park so walking is allowed. There is a one-day hiking trail which follow the Modder River, easy enough for families with young children.

==Work==


==Buy==
The ongoing expansion of the Waterfront mall means that Bloemfontein now has two branches of each of the standard South African chain stores (the other branches being in the Mimosa Mall 2 km up the road).  There is a craft market near the Waterfront mall on the first Saturday of the month. Many shops close Saturday afternoons and all day Sunday.

==Eat==
People eat ''early'' in Bloemfontein - even by South African standards, if you arrive at a restaurant after 7.30pm, especially on a weeknight, you may get some funny looks from the staff, and rushed service as they try to get you out the door so they can lock up and go home.

==Stay safe==
Bloemfontein is much safer than most other cities. You can walk around downtown during the day time (although it will be eerily quiet after the shops close). The Waterfront and other shopping malls are safe and patrolled with 24 hour security, and 2nd Street (the main restaurant strip) is fine day and night. The dodgy areas to avoid if possible are near the train station and anywhere east of the railway lines (where the traditional townships are located).

If you find yourself arriving at the train station early in the morning, a meter taxi can take you to either the KFC or the McDonald's on Nelson Mandela Ave for R50. They are in a safe area, have free wifi, are open 24-hours, and don't have a problem with travelers "camping out" until sunrise. 

AUGUST 2022: The above information is no longer accurate, Post covid these fast food restaurants are no longer 24 hours.

==Cope==


==Get out==
* Visit the beautiful [[Karoo]] town of [[Graaff-Reinet]] and the [[Mountain Zebra National Park]] in the south.
* Heading east you will reach [[Thaba 'Nchu]], 60 km outside Bloemfontein, which has a luxury hotel and casino complex as well as Maria Moroka Nature Reserve. 130km from Bloemfontein is the pleasant town of [[Ladybrand]] close to [[Lesotho]] and its capital city of [[Maseru]].
* The '''N6''' will take you to [[East London]] and the '''N1''' will take you to [[Gauteng]] (which is a toll road) or [[Cape Town]]
