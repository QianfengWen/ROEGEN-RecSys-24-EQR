'''Puerto Plata''' or '''San Felipe de Puerto Plata''' is a city in the [[Dominican Republic]]. It is the capital of the province of Puerto Plata.

==Understand==
Known for its pretty sandy beaches, Puerto Plata is a popular resort destination as well as a great place to meet Dominican people and shop in local commerce. Moreover, Puerto Plata is the place where the Austrian singer Falco died in a car accident in 1998.

===By car===
Cars are more expensive to rent and very likely to be damaged, as the Dominican mentality is "no big deal", count on no one having insurance.

If you are renting your own vehicle keep in mind what type of fuel it uses. Natural gas (propane) is popular and natural gas stations seem to outnumber petrol stations. Obviously, the two are incompatible, don't strand yourself thinking that you can go to any station and get the fuel that you need!

===By boat=== 
* <listing name="Amber Cove" alt="" directions="" lat="" long="" address="Maimón, 57000" phone="+1 8297350272" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="https://www.ambercove.com/" hours="" price="">It is the Dominican Republic’s Newest Cruise Port for large ships. It is situated on the Bay of Maimon, a short distance to the northwest of Puerto Plata. you’ll find a transportation hub just a 5 minutes walk from the pier. The cruise terminal is named after the amber stone that is mined in this area. Port was established in 2015 by Carnival Corporation. The only way to visit this port is to be on a cruise. Cruise ships that visit this port are Carnival Cruise Line, Princess Cruises, and [[Holland America]] Line.</listing>

==Get around==
There are several options for local transportation between the city proper and the surrounding hotels and resorts.

'''Buses''' are slower, but the cheapest, and, once you understand the routes, the easiest way to get around.

'''Taxis''' is the most expensive option and not really more secure than other choices. You will probably prefer to book a '''Private Transfers''' with a reliable company.

'''Guagua''' are simple minivan for normally 7-8 persons that can be easily packed to 22 persons and 2 roosters! Guagua is the main common transportation system but is not really organized; you can stop practically anywhere along the main streets and wait for one to stop and climb up, the fare is normally cheap, but you'll probably have to negotiate with the driver or the door operator. Guagas can often be identified by "Se venda" stickers on the windows and a large rearview mirror pasted to the back door. Guaguas follow static routes which can be identified from a large letter on the windscreen. From the west (e.g. Cofresí) your best choice is ''F'' which stops both ways on the corner of Calle Camino Real and an unnamed street [http://osm.org/go/YfKOnFugh-?m=] just a few blocks southwest from Parque Central. A Propina is likely waiting when you get off and starts hassling around. Both C and F run from Cofresí to past Playa Dorada; C runs a direct line and F zigzags through the city.

'''Propinas'''. Much has been written about Propinas in the surrounding areas of Puerto Plata (to get a better idea of who these people are see '''[[Sosua]]'''. The same general rules must apply here.  The difference is that some of the ones here will take the "con man" approach.  One typical example is that you will be approached by a friendly individual who will pretend to be an employee at your resort, based on looking at the wristband you wear, given to you at the hotel.  They can be very knowledgeable about your resort when asking them any questions, so it is easy to see how they may win your confidence. Try covering your hotel wristband with a watch or an athletic wristband.

At first, they will say how he/she does not need any of your money and that they will protect you from aggressive vendors. They will show you around various landmarks (mostly upon request) and they will help you bargain at local shops (sometimes at very good deals). Sometime after when they feel the dust has already settled in, they will begin to pluck at the heartstrings (talking about how his/her parents need medication, or how his/her baby needs milk, etc.) so you may feel obligated to give them some money when they do ask for it. Even if you offer to buy the items yourself at the store you are already in, they will insist on taking the money instead.  Soon afterward, they will direct you to the bus station which will lead you back to the resort, and most of the time you will never see this individual again!

The general rule of thumb: if you do not recognize the individual at all it is best to ignore them (perhaps by pretending to not understand them at all by replying in gibberish). However, if you do not speak Spanish and if you are lost, Propinas may be your only hope in directing you on how to get back, even if their company is at a staggering cost.  If you do recognize an employee outside of your hotel, make sure YOU are the one who approaches that person first. And if you know exactly where you are going, just simply ignore them.  Or if you are well-versed in Spanish but a little lost, it is better to ask around from someone else who seems less shady as there can be helpful individuals not looking to dig into your wallet. Don't be played for a fool.

'''Motoconcho''' or motorcycle taxis can be recognized by their yellow vests. They are a cheaper alternative to taxis if you are comfortable with being a passenger on 2-wheels. They often congregate around "destination" areas like airports, and markets.

'''Motorcycle/Scooter'''. Rentals of two-wheeled vehicles are possible. Be sure that you have experience with a motorcycle or scooter, the road surfaces are poorly maintained and the driving style is very hectic. Drivers very rarely observe stop signs, even red lights are "optional". A license is not necessary to operate a motorcycle or scooter and as such, the skill levels vary widely. Trucks and other large vehicles often overtake unsafely in corners and low visibility stretches of road, so you may be forced into a ditch! License plates are applied to scooters but not motorcycles. It is very common for overtaking vehicles to announce their presence to a scooter or motorcycle by honking, try not to be startled by this! Helmets are seldom used (some motorcoaches wear them), but you may have difficulty getting a rental helmet, and it most certainly will not fit properly. Inspect your scooter or motorcycle before renting. Also, most bikes are small displacement compared to other parts of the world. Most are under 200cc and are 2-stroke.

Rent there a lounge chair if you really want to appreciate it. If you don't, the Dominican people will ask you all day long if you want to rent a chair from them.
