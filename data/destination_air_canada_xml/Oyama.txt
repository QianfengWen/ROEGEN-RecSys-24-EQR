'''Oyama''' (小山, [http://www.city.oyama.tochigi.jp/cgi-bin/odb-get.exe?WIT_template=AC020000&WIT_oid=icityv2::Contents::5214]) is the second most populous city in southern [[Tochigi prefecture]], [[Japan]].

==Get in==
Oyama is above all a major train junction, and most visitors won't stop much longer than it takes to change trains. However, one of the minor thrills of Oyama is to stand on the Shinkansen platform and watch the through-trains barrel past at full throttle and full volume on the middle tracks away from either platform. 

===By train===
Oyama is on the Tōhoku Shinkansen between [[Tokyo]] and [[Aomori]], and is served by the ''Nasuno'' and ''Yamabiko'' all-stations services. There is one train per hour from Tokyo to Oyama, with more frequent trains for the peak-direction rush (42 minutes, &yen;3440 for an unreserved seat).

Oyama also lies at the intersection of the JR Tohoku Line, which runs north-south between Utsunomiya and Ueno; the JR Mito Line, which runs east to the historic city of [[Mito]]; and the JR Ryōmō Line, which runs west to [[Takasaki]], where the Jōetsu Shinkansen (toward [[Niigata]]) splits off from the Nagano Shinkansen. 

Local trains from Ueno to Oyama on the Tohoku Line, the section of which is also referred to as the Utsunomiya Line, take 75 minutes at a cost of &yen;1280. Some rapid services during rush hours cut this time down to as little as 60 minutes.

There is no cost to use JR train services with the Japan Rail Pass.

===By car===
Oyama also lies at the intersection of two major national highways: National Route 50, which runs east-west between Mito and Takasaki, and National Route 4, which runs north-south between Tokyo and [[Aomori]].

==Get around==

O Bus (Oyama Community Bus) services about 13 different lines from Oyama station to surrounding areas. Adult fare is 200 yen. Most lines have about one bus per hour. [http://translate.google.co.jp/translate?hl=ja&sl=ja&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.city.oyama.tochigi.jp%2F O Bus information]

==Do==

==Buy==
Oyama station is a decent place to do some quick shopping while waiting for train connections to smaller cities or towns. There are two fairly big, midrange department stores, Val and Roble.

The local post office (36.309232, 139.814939) ATM allows you to withdraw cash by credit and debit cards issued outside of Japan, including Visa, Plus, Mastercard, Maestro, Cirrus, American Express and JCB cards and provide an English user menu.

==Eat==
If you want to grab a quick meal between trains, try the ground floor food court below the Val department store at the West Exit. The ramen shop doesn't stint on the pepper or garlic, and the soba shop provides fresh wasabi that you grate yourself (and little bags to take away the leftover stubs). For those with a little more time to kill, here are a few options outside the station.
