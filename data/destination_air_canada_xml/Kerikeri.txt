Often described as the ''Cradle of the Nation'', it is the site of the first permanent mission station in the country, and has some of the most historic buildings extant in New Zealand today.

Located in the ''Winterless North'', Kerikeri is a rapidly-expanding centre of sub-tropical and allied horticulture, and retirement homes. It lies at the very western extremity of the Kerikeri Inlet, where fresh water of the Kerikeri River tumbles into the salty Pacific Ocean.

For a time, Kerikeri had the town slogan ''It's So Nice They Named It Twice'' which was written in the Visitors' Book at the youth hostel by an anonymous backpacker in the early 1980s. With lush vegetation, modern appearance and a progressive community, Kerikeri was judged ''Top Small Town of New Zealand'' in 2001.

==Get in==

===By air===

Regular daily flights from [[Auckland]] by Air New Zealand. The Kerikeri airport ({{IATA|KKE}}) is a few kilometres west of the town, located at 35°26'28" South, 173°91'2" East.

===By car===

Kerikeri is a pleasant three-hour drive north of Auckland, via State Highway 1 and the last 12 km on State Highway 10.

===By bus===

The Northliner Express [ttps://www.busbud.com/en/bus-company/northliner-service] coach travels daily between Auckland and Kerikeri via Whangarei and Paihia.

==Get around==

Kerikeri is an ideal central base for day trips to tourist areas such as Waitangi, [[Paihia]] or Russell or a visit to see the mighty kauri trees in the Puketi Forest. Tourist buses call in daily to Kerikeri to uplift day-trippers for the guided tours to Ninety Mile Beach and Cape Reinga. Paihia offers several boating opportunities, including the popular four-hour cruise which takes people up close to the dolphins.

*'''Gardens'''. Wharepuke Subtropical Garden is Northlands [http://www.subtropicalgarden.co.nz/] "Garden of Regional Significance". Located 1km from Kerikeri it showcases unusual plants from around the world. Guided or self guided tours are offered over the 5 acres of established garden.

* '''Mission House''', a much visited building, this is the oldest wooden structure in New Zealand. It was built 1822 for the Rev John Butler, NZ's first clergyman. Originally called the Mission House, it was then Kemp House for more than 100 years, but has now reverted to its original name.

* '''The Stone Store''', a former storehouse, is the oldest stone building in New Zealand, construction having begun in 1832. The building has been restored to its original state and is one of the most photographed buildings in the country.

* '''St James''', a picturesque wooden church on the hill above the Stone Store, began life in 1829 as a 38 ft by 18 ft lath and plaster structure complete with a town clock.

* '''Rewa's Village''', opposite the Stone Store, is a faithful replica kainga (fishing village) which existed when Europeans arrived in New Zealand. Rewa's Village has all the features of a true kainga, including a marae area, chief's whare (house), kauta (cooking shelter), whata (bench where food was placed), tall whata, weapons store, pataka (raised food store), enclosure for the tohunga (a wise person who advised the community on just about everything), rahui (a post marking tapu or out of bounds limits), whare made of bark, waka tiwai (fishing canoe), bird snare, hangi pit (ground oven), genuine historic canoes, family enclosure, rua (storage area ) for kumara (sweet potato) and a paepae haumati (the basic toilet system which was flushed twice daily by the tide) .

* '''Kororipo Pa''' stands at the head of the Kerikeri Inlet which was known as Te Waha o te Riri (''the inlet of war'') not long after the missionaries arrived. It was once once Hongi Hika’s fortressed pa, and fishing village.

* '''Steam Driven Sawmill''', not quite perpetual motion, but this mill provides its own fuel and is a great favourite with tourists and steam engine buffs alike. The whole mill is powered by a large steam plant which is fired by waste wood from the trees being milled.

==Do==

* '''Beaches'''. Although the water at the Stone Store basin is part of the Bay of Islands where overseas yachties tie up regularly, especially in the hurricane season, Kerikeri township does not have a beach. But not too far away there are wonderful swimming beaches, at Matauri Bay which boasts impressive views of the Cavalli Islands, Te Ngaere and Tapuaetahi. 

* '''Fishing'''. The Bay Of Islands has been renowned for its big-game fishing since American author Zane Gray put it on the map in the 1930s. But there are smaller fish in the bay as well, and charter operators are busy all year round. 

* '''Golf'''. 1 km from the town centre, the Kerikeri Golf Club has one of the best all-weather championship courses in New Zealand. Out towards Matauri Bay is sited the Kauri Cliffs Golf Course which has been included in the world’s top 10 courses by several golfing magazines.

* '''Flying'''. Kerikeri Airport has a very active Bay Of Islands Aero Club and flying schools. Joyrides and charter flights are available, and if you feel like doing something extraordinary, there's always tandem parachute jumping 

* '''Sailing'''. The Kerikeri Cruising Club at Doves Bay is very active due to the unsurpassed boating waters on Kerikeri's doorstep, up with the very best in the world. The club has modern facilities, including a large marina.

* '''Swimming'''. As well as the marvellous nearby beaches, and various places to swim in the Kerikeri River like the Fairy Pools, Kerikeri has a modern swimming pool with diving facilities. Sited at the Kerikeri High School, it is a community pool. 

* '''Walks'''. There are lovely walks at Kerikeri and several others in the district. The 4 km stroll from the Stone Store to Rainbow Falls can be undertaken by most people. It meanders through very photogenic scenery and regenerating native bush. A short track leads from the Stone Store to Kororipo Pa. Another fine walk is from opposite St James Church to the Fairy Pools past Wharepoke Falls on the south bank of the Kerikeri River. The Fairy Pools can also be reached via a track from the Youth Hostel.
:* '''Fairy pools''', These delightful pools were given to the nation by Caroline Little who was captivated by them in 1928 on her first visit from China.
:* '''Rainbow Falls''',  on the Kerikeri River, so called because the Maori name for them, Waianiwaniwa, means Waters of the Rainbow. You can drive almost to the falls.
:* '''Dawn Chorus'''. A rewarding experience.  Just before dawn, at Manginangina in the Puketi Forest, thousands of native birds join voices to welcome the day, and there are very friendly birds which come regularly for breakfast.
