'''Invercargill''' is the most southerly (and westerly) city in [[New Zealand]]. It is the service city for the farms of the Southland plains at [[South (New Zealand)|the southern end]] of the [[South Island]]. Built in the late 19th and early 20th century, its wide streets and century old buildings give the visitor a unique feeling of stepping back in time to when business was conducted in a more sedate and considered manner and the streets were paved with Otago gold. The wide streets also makes it easy to navigate around the lively bars, bustling restaurants and wide range of shops. But that is not all, along with the cultural attractions, Invercargill has some seriously breathtaking places are just a few minutes away. 

==Understand==
Invercargill is named after William Cargill, a prominent pioneer Otago settler. The city itself is located on the Waihopai River. But its wide streets bear the names of the rivers of Scotland and the Northern England.

The inhabitants of Southland, with their Scots ancestry, are the nearest New Zealand gets to having different (English) dialects. Many talk with a Southland  ''burr''.  The ''r''s are rolled in a distinctive manner.

A flight from Christchurch takes about an hour in a turboprop aircraft. On a clear day the flight is spectacular, with the Southern Alps to the west of the flight path. If flying south to Invercargill request a window seat on the right or starboard side of the aircraft (request port or left if flying out to Christchurch.)  [[Mount Cook]], which is visible about half way through the flight, is merely the biggest of the many massive peaks of the [[Southern Alps]]. A direct flight from Wellington takes around 2 and a half hours.
