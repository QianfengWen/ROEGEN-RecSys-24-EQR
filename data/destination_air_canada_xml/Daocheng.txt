'''Daocheng''' (稻城; ''Dàochéng'') is a city in [[Ganzi (prefecture)|Ganzi]], [[Sichuan|Sichuan province]]

==Understand==
Daocheng is located at an altitude of 3750m. While there may not appear to be much to do in this town those who do decide to stop over and spend a day here will find this town/village much more charming than it initially appears. It offers a good stepping stone for those coming from [[Yunnan]] with altitude concerns as the towns either side of it ([[Xiangcheng]] and [[Litang]]) sit at altitudes of 3200m and 4000m. If you take the time to head out of the town you will find the surrounding countryside and mountainous backdrop quite charming.

Daocheng is a sensible acclimatizing base for a trip onward to Yading and the Yading Nature Reserve (which has trail altitudes of 4000m+). As of June 2016, the town's overly developed center is a ghost town both to domestic and international visitors--ask to see the kitchen in the restaurants, as ingredients may not be fresh. There are monasteries out in the countryside, but the hot springs, supposed to be only 4km or so from the center, are currently inaccessible due to (de)construction of the only road.

==See==
You can easily spend a few days just wandering around Daocheng - especially if you go climbing the hill around the city, the arid landscapes are truly stunning. It's a worthy stop on your way, don't treat it just as a sleepover to Kangding/Shangri-La/ However, carry a stick or some stones in your pockets, as wild and freely roaming dogs are a bit of a danger, especially if you leave the villages and stay on your own.

As of June 2016, the town is still under heavy construction--dust and concrete and large trucks with massive horns are the norm. Development is everywhere, but the town is eerily empty of guests.

==Sleep==

There are a large number of budget guesthouses across the road from the bus station. There are also several guesthoues a short distance out from town which several touts crowding around the bus station will happily take you to. However, be aware that when coming in winter, the majority of guesthouses are dead-locked, and even if there is anything open, it will not have running water nor hot water (as the water pipes are frozen during winter). Moreoverm there is no heating as in the whole area. In such situation, it is a must to ask for an electric blanket in the sleeping places (but again, be aware that electricity fails very often). On top of all that, the bus station hotel is definitely not a bargain offer either.

As of Sept '12, there is a large number of Hostels around. 25 RMB for a dorm seems to be the standard price, some will offer a bed for as little as 20 RMB. You will be approached at the bus stop right away, choose your favorite one and enjoy the free lift.
*<sleep name="Drolma's Guesthouse" alt="" address="50 Dexi Street" directions="When you come out of the bus station, turn left and walk about 50m and take the first left turn. Drolma's is 100m on the right." phone="+8613684491026, +8608365728085" url="zhuomarenjia@163.com" checkin="" checkout="" price="" lat="" long="">This is a very centrally located hostel run by a young and friendly guy.

Walk a further 100 meters along Dexi Street and you will a second Hostelling international hostel called Yaocheng Hostelling International Hostel. To find the 3rd hosteling international hostel, exit the bus station and turn right. Walk until the end of the road, You will see the hostel on the left. It is called MaMa International Youth Hostel.

All of them are good. Staff speak good English in all of them.  MaMa International Youth Hostel offers Yak meat stew in the evenings for 25 yuan depending on demand.

Be wary of guesthouses staffed solely by Chinese students doing a month of volunteering. They know very little about the area, may mislead you inadvertently, and are not very welcoming of guests, ensconced in their cliques of fellow college students.

==Get out==
If you arrive by bus you will undoubtedly be accosted by the local minibus drivers offering service to Litang or Xiangcheng. Even if you've made a late afternoon arrival, it is perfectly reasonable to skip Daocheng and take a minibus on to either of these destinations. In this part of Sichuan, minibuses are often the same price as public buses. Service to Litang cost 50¥ at time of writing (26 July 2009).
