'''Shenzhen''' (深圳; ''Shēnzhèn'') is a city in [[Guangdong|Guangdong Province]] in [[People's Republic of China|China]]. As recently as 1980 Shenzhen was a market town of 30,000 people. That year Shenzhen was designated as the first of China's five Special Economic Zones due to its location immediately adjacent to capitalist [[Hong Kong]]. Shenzhen then became the fastest growing city in history to today become an amazing, thriving, well planned metropolis of 20 million people.

Shenzhen is on the list of [[UNESCO Creative Cities]] and ranked second on the list of ‘Top 10 cities to visit in 2019' by Lonely Planet. Shenzhen’s tourism hospitality facilities welcomed over 64 million overnight visitors in 2018 of which 12.2 million were from outside mainland China. Tourists were originally attracted by Shenzhen's theme parks but as the city has developed and prospered they are increasingly drawn by Shenzhen's stunning architecture, numerous beautiful parks and mountains, highly active cultural arts scene, and breadth of restaurants, bars and shopping. In 2006, the Dapeng Peninsula (the location of Shenzhen's best beaches), was nominated by the China National Geographic Magazine as one of China's most beautiful coastlines. Many are drawn by Shenzhen's status as a world leading futuristic tech city. Fascinating historical sites of national significance dating as far back as the 12th century are scattered throughout Shenzhen, e.g. impressive forts and temples and sites related to Hakka culture or Hong Kong's annexation after the Opium Wars.

Being such a new city, people in Shenzhen have the advantage of planned street grids, modern construction at all but its historical buildings and world leading eco-friendly public transport among its infrastructure. Also considering the often flat terrain such as in Shenzhen's very sizeable downtown area, Shenzhen is among the most disabled friendly cities in China.

===History===
The earliest known recorded mention of the name Shenzhen could date from 1410, during the Ming Dynasty. Local people called the drains in paddy fields “zhen” (圳). Shenzhen (深圳) literally means “deep drains” as the area was once crisscrossed with rivers and streams, with deep drains within the paddy fields. The character 圳 is limited in distribution to an area of South China with its most northerly examples in Zhejiang Province which suggests an association with southwards migration during the Southern Song Dynasty (12th and 13th centuries).

Contrary to a common misconception of Shenzhen being a fishing village prior to becoming a city, Shenzhen was a regional market town that had been the county town of Bao'an since 1953. Shenzhen train station was the last stop on the Mainland Chinese section of the railway from Guangzhou to Kowloon in Hong Kong. In November 1979, Bao'an County (宝安县) was promoted to prefecture level, directly governed by Guangdong province. It was renamed Shenzhen, after Shenzhen town. The county administrative centre county stood approximately around the present location of Dongmen. 

Shenzhen was chosen as the first of five Special Economic Zones (SEZ) in May 1980. Initially, the SEZ comprised an area of only 327.5 km2 (126.4 sq mi) of southern Shenzhen, covering the current Luohu, Futian, Nanshan and Yantian districts. The SEZ was created to be an experimental ground for the practice of market capitalism within a community guided by the ideals of "socialism with Chinese characteristics". In 1982 Bao'an County was re-established, though this time as a part of Shenzhen. The county was converted to become Bao'an District, which was out of the Special Economic Zone. Shenzhen was promoted to a Sub-provincial City in March 1983 and was given the right of provincial-level economic administration in November 1988. With a population of 30,000 in 1980, economic development has meant that by 2008 the city has had 12 million inhabitants.

Shenzhen became one of the Pearl River Delta region's largest cities. The Pearl River Delta, which itself is an economic hub of China, as well as the largest manufacturing base in the world. By 2001, as a result of Shenzhen's increasing economic prospects, increasing numbers of migrants from Mainland China chose to go to Shenzhen and stay there instead of trying to illegally cross the border into Hong Kong. There were 9,000 captured border-crossers in 2000, while the same figure was 16,000 in 1991. On 1 July 2010, the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone was expanded to include all districts, a five-fold increase over its pre-expansion size.

===Geography===
Shenzhen is one of 9 prefectures and 2 Special Administrative Regions within the 120 million people [[Pearl River Delta]] megalopolis. Shenzhen borders Hong Kong to the south, Huizhou to the north and northeast, Dongguan to the north and northwest, Lingdingyang and the Pearl River to the west and Mirs Bay to the east. Shenzhen is roughly 100 kilometres (62 mi) southeast of the provincial capital, Guangzhou.

Shenzhen is flat downtown and in other areas but still has hills and mountains. e.g. Wutong Mountain in Shenzhen is the 2nd highest mountain in the Pearl River Delta. Over 160 rivers or channels flow through the Shenzhen area. The West flowing Shenzhen River forms most of the physical border between mainland China and Hong Kong SAR. Notable other rivers within Shenzhen include Maozhou River and Longgang River.

Shenzhen is surrounded by many islands. Most such islands fall under neighbouring territories such as Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Huiyang District, Huizhou. Several islands are under Shenzhen's jurisdiction, such as Nei Lingding Island, Dachan Island (Tai Shan Island), Xiaochan Island, Mazhou, Laishizhou, Zhouzai and Zhouzaitou.

[[Image:Shenzhen_skyline_viewed_across_Hong_Kong_wetlands.jpg|thumb|Sunset over Futian District CBD viewing NorthWest from across Hong Kong's wetlands. The tallest building in this skyline photo is the Ping An Building.]]

The city is elongated measuring 81.4 kilometers from East to West while the shortest section from north to south is 10.8 kilometers. Shenzhen's often flat terrain includes the downtown Luohu and Futian districts. Being such a new city, Shenzhen benefits from planned street grids. The urban planning quality contributes to excellent local transport infrastructure (See [[Shenzhen#Get around|"Get around" section below]]). This includes its friendliness to wheelchairs (see Wheelchair Access sections below).

Shenzhen is subdivided into 9 districts and 1 "New District" in the 2016 government plan. The 9 districts are:

* Bao'an District (宝安区 Bǎo'ān Qū)
* Futian District (福田区 Fútián Qū)
* Guangming District (光明区 Guāngmíng Qū)
* Longgang District (龙岗区 Lónggǎng Qū)
* Longhua District (龙华区 Lónghuá Qū)
* Luohu District (罗湖区 Luóhú Qū)
* Nanshan District (南山区 Nánshān Qū)
* Pingshan District (坪山区 Píngshān Qū)
* Yantian District (盐田区 Yántián Qū)

Dapeng New District despite being a peninsula at the East of Shenzhen comes under the jurisdiction of Longgang District in central Shenzhen to which Dapeng is separated by Pingshan District. A New District is a management area and an not administrative division registered under the Ministry of Civil Affairs.

Shennan Road (Chinese: 深南路; pinyin: Shēnnán Lù) is Shenzhen's principal street. It runs east-west 25.6 km (15.9 mi) in length through Shenzhen's very sizeable downtown area and beyond. Shennan Road spans Luohu, Futian and Nanshan Districts and is divided into three sections:

* Shennan East Road (深南东路) from Yanhe Road to Hongling Road
* Shennan Middle Road (深南中路) from Hongling Road to Huanggang Road
* Shennan Boulevard (Chinese: 深南大道; pinyin: Shēnnán Dàdào; Jyutping: Sam1 naam4 Daai6 dou6) from Huanggang Road to Nantou Checkpoint

Prior to the designation of Shenzhen as a city in 1979, the road was but a 2.1 km gravel path linking Shenzhen and Shangbu planning area. The road is named after the two former settlements (both later integrated within the city of Shenzhen) it links on each end:

* Shenzhen Town (深圳镇) in Luohu
* Nantou (南头镇) in Nanshan

Shennan Road's length and downtown location make it an obvious orientation point for many people. See also "Do" section on "Urban Walking'.

}}
Although Shenzhen is situated about a degree south of the Tropic of Cancer, due to the Siberian anticyclone it has a warm, monsoon-influenced, humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cwa).

* Winters are mild and relatively dry, due in part to South China Sea influence, and frost is very rare; it begins dry but becomes progressively more humid and overcast. However, fog is most frequent in winter and spring, with 106 days per year reporting some fog.

* Early spring is the cloudiest time of year, and rainfall begins to dramatically increase in April; the rainy season lasts until late September to early October.

* The monsoon reaches its peak intensity in the summer months, when the city also experiences very humid, and hot, but moderated, conditions; there are only 2.4 days of 35 °C (95 °F)+ temperatures. The region is prone to torrential rain as well, with 9.7 days that have 50 mm (1.97 in) or more of rain, and 2.2 days of at least 100 mm (3.94 in). The annual precipitation averages at around 1,970 mm (78 in), some of which is delivered in typhoons that strike from the east during summer and early autumn. Extreme temperatures have ranged from 0.2 °C (32 °F) on 11 February 1957 to 38.7 °C (102 °F) on 10 July 1980. Incredibly high Summer humidity combined with soaring temperatures make Summer for many a season to avoid. 

* The latter portion of autumn is dry. From a climate perspective, the best time to visit Shenzhen is October to December when the weather is pleasantly cool.

===Population===
Shenzhen population is hotly discussed. Depending on where you wish to draw the boundary the population figures for Shenzhen are:

* City of Shenzhen: 12.1 million as at 2019
* Shenzhen urban area: 13.1 million as at 2019
* Shenzhen metropolitan area: 23.3 million as at 2010 (according to the OECD)

However, local authorities estimate that the population of the city of Shenzhen is about 20 million, due to huge numbers of floating migrants un-required to register if staying less than 6 months.

===Economy===
Shenzhen's Municipal Bureau of Statistics describes Shenzhen's economy to be upheld by its four-pillar industries:

#high-tech
#finance
#logistics
#culture

From being a quiet market town in 1980, the effect of Shenzhen being China's 1st Special Economic Zone has been astounding. Shenzhen ranks:

* 14th in the 2019 Global Financial Centres Index
* 8th highest stock exchange market capitalisation globally as at 30 November 2018 with the Shenzhen Stock Exchange's (SZSE) market capitalisation value at US$2.5 trillion
* 3rd busiest container port on earth in 2017 after Shanghai and Singapore. Nearby Hong Kong and Guangzhou placed fifth and seventh respectively
* 1st in the 2017 list of Chinese cities by GDP per capita with 183,544 RMB
* 3rd in the economic output of Chinese cities in 2018 behind only Shanghai and Beijing with nominal GDP of 2.42 trillion RMB (HK$2.87 trillion) up 7.6% year on year surpassing neighbouring Hong Kong's GDP of HK$2.85 trillion and Guangzhou's GDP of 1.98 trillion RMB
* 1st in the report by Evergrande Research Institute in August 2019 on Chinese cities with the most potential

Some observers point out that, given the preponderance of privately held companies in Shenzhen and the widespread avoidance of tax, it is highly likely that the GDP figure is severely understated. A walk around Shenzhen's leafy Western suburbs will quickly allay any doubts as to the wealth in the city.

Shenzhen is a leading global technology hub, dubbed by media as the next Silicon Valley. Shenzhen is an extremely fertile ground for startups, be it by Chinese or foreign entrepreneurs. UNESCO approved Shenzhen's entrance into the Creative Cities Network in December 2008, awarding the title of "United Nations Design Capital".

==Get in==

===Visa===
In most cases, a visa should be obtained from a Chinese embassy or consulate before arriving anywhere in China. There are certain exceptions including visa free transit visits to China. See the [[China#Visas|China]] page for more information.

[[File:Shenzhen visa.jpg|thumb|Visa rules]]
Many nationalities arriving at Shenzhen can obtain a single-entry, five-day tourism visa on arrival (VOA).Shenzhen VOA offices are only at the following entry points and open at the hours listed:

# Fuyong:	        10:00 - last carrier arrival  (0755)23459289
# Huanggang:	        00:00 - 24:00  (0755)83391060
# Luohu:     	07:00 - 23:30  (0755)82324022
# Shekou:	        09:00 - 13:00 & 14:30 - 17:00  (0755)26691202
# Shenzhen Airport:	10:00 - last flight arrival (0755)82327700

See the relevant sections below for more info on each of those entry points. This visa is strictly only valid in Shenzhen. The Shenzhen VOA can neither be extended nor converted meaning holders must leave China before visa expiry. Payment is by RMB or credit card (Union Pay, Visa and MasterCard). Some credit cards do not process, try to have RMB or back up credit card. For most nationalities the Shenzhen VOA fee is the same as a regular visa fee (168 RMB). This though various for countries with a reciprocal visa fee (e.g. the fee is 304 RMB for UK passport holders). National eligibility for Shenzhen VOA changes so the following should be taken only as a rough guide to be checked elsewhere:

# Most European and developed countries are eligible for the five-day VOA, including US, UK, Canada, French, Australia, Germany, Korea, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland
# Indonesian and Filipino passport holders can get it only if they have been granted a Chinese visa previously
# Citizens from the following countries are ineligible: Afghanistan, Algeria, Bahrain, Cameroon, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Syria, Turkey, Uganda, and Yemen

Citizens of countries not mentioned should contact the relevant Chinese embassy or port to ask if they can apply for the Shenzhen visa on arrival.

[[File:Shenzhen visa fees.jpg|thumb|Visa fees]] 

Besides Shenzhen VOA, you may also apply for a full China visa (single and double entry only) at Luohu checkpoint. This visa can be obtained only between the hours of 09.30-16.30. It is better to apply for a ten year multiple entry visa at any consulate in the US for approximately $140 (ten year visa recently introduced for US citizens).  For US passport holders, visa length will depend on the previous visas that have been issued.  The first visa will be double entry, the second will be six month multiple entries, and so forth.  US citizens who were originally Chinese citizens or are married or children of Chinese citizens are eligible for two year multiple entry visas.  If you have an old Chinese visa in another passport, it will be helpful to include the old passport in the visa application.

Getting a tourist visa in Hong Kong takes from 1 to 3 days and costs HK$150-1,100. A list of costs [http://www.fmcoprc.gov.hk/eng/zgqz/blsjfy/] is available. [[Macau]]'s visa office is less crowded and the hotels are a bit cheaper, but it takes just as long. In general, only single and double entry visas are granted to visitors without HKID cards, although foreigners with previous entries into the mainland and Hong Kong student or work visa holders have been known to be approved for multiple entries.

===By air===
[[Image:Shenzhen Bao'an Airport.jpg|thumb|Shenzhen Bao'an Airport.]]
Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport [http://eng.szairport.com/] is 32 km (20 mi) northwest of the city centre. In the 1st half of 2019 the airport served just over 25 million passengers making it the 26th busiest airport in the world by passenger numbers. The airport apron has parking spaces for 53 aeroplanes. While most flights are domestic, the airport website lists over 50 international destinations. There is also a helicopter shuttle to/from [[Macau]]'s Terminal Marítimo for over 4000 RMB per person for the 15 minute 1 way trip.

From the airport arrivals hall, follow signs to the Ground Transportation Centre. Shenzhen airport is accessible to 2 metro lines:

* A) Metro line 11 runs from Airport metro station Southwest to Futian station in downtown Shenzhen. As an express line this takes only 25 minutes (price ¥7). Futian is on China's high speed rail (HSR) network with HSR trains to Hong Kong and the HSR hubs at Shenzhen North and Guangzhou South (see [[Shenzhen#By train|"By train" section below]]). Airport North metro station is operational but inaccessible to the airport until Terminal 4 becomes operational (scheduled to be in 2020)

* B) Metro line 1 is accessible to Shenzhen Airport via shuttle bus M416 to Hourui metro station. Line 1 runs all the way to Luohu station adjacent to Luohu border checkpoint. Hourui is the optimal station on metro line 1 for Shenzhen airport since the closure of 3 older airport terminals in November 2013. Since then Airport East metro station ironically no longer has airport access. Hourui to Luohu takes 65 mins  (price ¥8)

There are many bus routes between the airport and the urban area, most of them via expressways and only cost ￥10 yuan. Cross border buses operate to/from many destinations in Hong Kong mostly via Shenzhen Bay checkpoint. 
Local taxis and often some taxis from Dongguan, pick up passengers from 3 designated waiting areas. Taxis to downtown Futian are approximately ¥100 and to Luohu approximately ¥150 including tolls.

====Transportation between Hong Kong International Airport and Shenzhen====
Please note with respect to your flight arrival time that Huanggang is the only 24 hour border crossing in Shenzhen. Other Shenzhen land border checkpoints close in some places at 10 pm with all except Huanggang closed from midnight til at least 6.30 am. 

There are bus, train, ferry and MPV options for travelling between Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) and Shenzhen. Each has its own merits dependent on the intended start/end point in Shenzhen. All train and franchised bus choices require making at least one connection somewhere en route.

Travel involving high speed rail (HSR) is the premier transport mode between HKIA and central or especially Northern Shenzhen. HSR travel time is helped in that HSR trains do not stop at the geographic land border.

HKIA franchised bus travel to the geographic land border checkpoint crossings has numerous benefits compared to equivalent travel using trains from HKIA all the way across Hong Kong to geographic land border checkpoint crossings. Compared to the equivalent train journey these journeys by bus are:

# around 1/2 price
# less circuitous and with less interchanges thus being 30-45 mins quicker and with only 1 rather than 4 connections to carry luggage between
# equipped with free open wifi on airport buses (locations with free open wifi in Hong Kong include the airport, airport buses, railway stations but not on trains. Nor is free open wifi on all of Hong Kong's bus fleet so if you need wifi after landing at Hong Kong airport, use it where it is available)
# very rarely fully occupied offering higher likelihood of seated travel
# better for viewing scenery than trains that travel through extensive tunnels. All the more so from the bus upper deck

Hong Kong airport and airline staff (e.g. cabin crew of Hong Kong based airlines) are educated on HKIA public transport by their experience of being its most frequent and regular users. Such people provide real-time, visible, operational endorsement of these buses 365 days a year with their journeys to and from their workplace.

'''Bus from HKIA''':
[[Image:A43P_and_NA43_airport_bus_stop_sign_at_San_Tin_PTI_in_Hong_Kong.jpg|thumb|Hong Kong Airport bus A43P and its NA43 night service to Sheung Shui & Fanling makes an additional stop at San Tin PTI that airport bus A43 does not. San Tin PTI and Sheung Shui both offer public transport connections to & from Shenzhen.]]

HKIA bus station is clearly signposted coming from HKIA Arrivals Hall and adjacent to the Airport Express rail station.

* 1) Franchised bus A43 [http://www.lwb.hk/chi/pdf/A43.pdf] runs to/from the bus station directly opposite Sheung Shui rail station on Hong Kong's East Rail Line. Sheung Shui then has plentiful connection options to border crossings:

* A) 1 stop by train to Lo Wu/Luohu (in Luohu district) that closes daily at midnight
* B) by bus to Man Kam To/Wenjindu (in Luohu district) that closes daily at 10 pm
* C) by bus to Sha Tau Kok/Shatoujiao (in Yantian district) that closes daily at 10 pm

Sheung Shui also offers a rail connection to Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Checkpoint. However if targeting bus travel from HKIA to Lok Ma Chau, bus A43P below is more direct. Bus A43 between HKIA and Sheung Shui costs 30.90 HKD as at September 2019 and takes 37 mins.

* 2) Compared to service A43, franchised services A43P and NA43 (check the schedule [http://www.lwb.hk/chi/pdf/A43_A43P_20160615.pdf]) stop between HKIA and Sheung Shui at San Tin Passenger Transport Interchange (PTI). HKIA bus A43P takes 32 mins to San Tin PTI and 44 mins to Sheung Shui. San Tin PTI has frequent, regular buses to 2 different nearby border checkpoints:

* A) Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang (in Futian district) open 24 x 365
* B) Lok Ma Chau Spur Line/Futian (in Futian District) closing daily at 10.30 pm

[[Image:Cross boundary shuttle buses visible and green minibus stands at San Tin Public Transport Interchange.jpg|thumb|A distinctively yellow cross boundary shuttle bus to the 24 hour Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang checkpoint is visible in this picture of San Tin PTI. These shuttle buses run every 15 minutes at off-peak schedule.]]

3) If travelling to Western Shenzhen, Shenzhen Bay border crossing is the most direct land border crossing from HKIA. As an approximate guide (check online in advance for quirks in the schedule around your likely time of use), the 2 most efficient franchised bus permutations to get to Shenzhen Bay checkpoint from Hong Kong Airport are:

* A) Bus A33X from Hong Kong Airport connects at Goodview Garden light rail stop in Tuen Mun with bus B3 that runs to Shenzhen Bay border crossing. The 1st A33X each day with a connecting service for Shenzhen Bay border crossing departs Hong Kong Airport 05.45 am as a once per hour service (becoming a twice per hour connecting service from 07.45 am onwards). The last A33X each day from Hong Kong Airport with a connecting service for Shenzhen Bay border crossing departs HK Airport at 10.15 pm.
* B) Bus A37 from Hong Kong Airport connects at Fortune Kingswood shopping mall in Tin Shui Wai with bus B2P that runs to Shenzhen Bay border crossing. Bus A37 with a connecting service for Shenzhen Bay border crossing departs Hong Kong Airport every 30 mins each day from 09.00 am to 09.30 pm.

TILChinalink [https://www.tilchinalink.com] advertise regular unfranchised buses from HKIA to/from Shenzhen Bay checkpoint and 4 locations in Western Shenzhen. The hefty 150 HKD price tag for such a short bus journey between HKIA to Shenzhen Bay checkpoint is disproportionate to prices they advertise between Shenzhen and other locations in Hong Kong. It thus seems likely that their service from HKIA is an MPV (see below).

Other journeys are possible between Hong Kong Airport and Shenzhen Bay checkpoint. Although they either take longer and / or require more connections than the journeys suggested above, these other journeys can be useful before 08.45 am and after 9.45 pm. If needed, check online in advance and with free open airport wifi on arrival.

'''Train from HKIA''':

If taking the  train from HKIA all the way to the border, take the Airport Express train from Hong Kong International Airport and then either:

* 1) Disembark at Kowloon Station and walk from there to the adjacent West Kowloon High Speed Rail station. High Speed Rail (HSR) runs Northbound from West Kowloon cross-border to Futian, Shenzhen North, Guangmingcheng and Shenzhen Pingshan stations all in Shenzhen before progressing onward. HSR from West Kowloon is the premier transport mode to central or especially Northern Shenzhen. See [[Shenzhen#High Speed Rail (HSR) from Hong Kong|"High Speed Rail (HSR) from Hong Kong"]] section below for more info.

* 2) A) Change at Tsing Yi on to the Tung Chung MTR line to Lai King; B) then change to the Tsuen Wan MTR line to Prince Edward; C) then change to the Kwun Tong MTR line to Kowloon Tong; D) then change to the East Rail MTR line to Lo Wu or Lok Ma Chau. This costs 70 HKD and takes 85/90 minutes to Lo Wu/Lok Ma Chau (see [[Shenzhen#Hong Kong Land Border Crossings|"Hong Kong Land Border Crossings"]] section below). If a particular journey from HKIA to mainland China means Lo Wu or Lok Ma Chau Spur Line is the optimal border crossing, travel from HKIA across Hong Kong's MTR network to the border is more expensive (approx double the cost), time consuming (30-45 mins longer), convoluted and troublesome compared to A43/A43P/NA43 bus options described above to those border crossings. There are though people who make the lengthier/costlier airport journey by MTR through lack of knowledge of bus options or (somewhat ironically considering the gigantic emissions footprint that goes with air travel), through environmental preference of electric train over petroleum fuelled bus. The choice is yours.

'''Ferry from HKIA''':
[[Image:Shekou Cruise Center.jpg|thumb|Shekou ferry terminal.]]
Ferries from Hong Kong Airport "Skypier" operate direct to/from 6 destinations in mainland China including 2 in Western Shenzhen:

* A) Fuyong Port at Shenzhen Airport
* B) Shekou Port

This option avoids going through Hong Kong passport control and customs. Ask at the ferry ticket booth at the airport for them to transfer your luggage. Then take the free airport driverless train to the Skypier and then straight to mainland China. Shenzhen metro access is available at both Shenzhen Airport and Shekou Port. People exiting China this way receive HKD 120 departure tax at HKIA. 

'''MPVs''':

A number of private companies operate MPVs between HKIA and destinations in Shenzhen and Shenzhen Airport. These MPVs disingenuously/misleadingly/comically/insultingly (take your pick of any of those) advertised as 'luxury limousine' would be more accurately described to the uninitiated as 7 seat minivans. While they are comfortable enough, they are neither limousines nor luxurious. MPVs are the most expensive (and polluting) shared public transportation from HKIA to the land border. The are basically glorified minibuses with the only genuinely competitive benefit they offer for travel between HKIA and Shenzhen being that they operate direct to/from locations they serve without interchange en route.

* MPVs between HKIA and Shenzhen's Huanggang Checkpoint in Futian District cost HK$150 per person (this price may be out of date). This fee includes ferrying you onwards to some destinations within Shenzhen (e.g. hotels) after you have cleared the China immigration at the border. It is worth clarifying on arrival at HKIA information desk. On the trip from Huanggang Checkpoint to HKIA, directions to the MPV vans to HKIA are clearly signposted at Huanggang Checkpoint after passport control and customs.

* Other services involve border crossing at Shenzhen Bay Checkpoint. Passengers are often not required to leave the vehicle at the border post, with the driver handling all the passports and details. Costs can be from HK$200 upwards per person. All in all it takes about 2 hours.

The service from Shenzhen to HKIA can be booked at your hotel. The price is usually CNY200.

[[Image:CRH380As_at_Shenzhenbei_on_18_Feb_2019_cropped.jpg|thumb|Guangzhou–Shenzhen–Hong Kong Express Rail Link (XRL) trains such as on the left in this picture at Shenzhen North are identifiable by the MTR Corporation logo. The rest of China's HSR network trains are operated by state owned CRH.]]
HSR trains in China whoosh along at speeds up to 350 km/h on their fastest sections making it second only to the Shanghai Airport Maglev as the quickest passenger train services on earth. HSR runs Northbound from West Kowloon station in Hong Kong to 4 stations in Shenzhen. Trains depart from West Kowloon from 7 am with the last departure from there gone before 11 pm. As at September 2019, approx journey times and one way adult ticket costs from West Kowloon station are:

* Futian:            14 mins, HKD76, 36 direct trains per weekday plus additional trains at weekends
* Shenzhen North:    18 mins, HKD84, 66 direct trains per day
* Guangmingcheng:    31 mins, HKD106, 3 direct trains per day (8 additional trains Northbound from Shenzhen North stop here. Trains depart Shenzhen North between 8 am and 7 pm)
* Shenzhen Pingshan: 60 mins, HKD97,  3 direct trains per day (18 additional trains Eastbound from Shenzhen North stop here. Trains depart Shenzhen North between 8 am and 6 pm)

HSR is the premier transport mode to/from central or especially Northern Shenzhen. HSR from West Kowloon is an even better choice if using HSR to travel further into mainland China via the HSR hub at Shenzhen North. West Kowloon station has free open wifi like all rail stations in Hong Kong. HSR trains do not stop at the geographic land border (passport and customs requirements are actioned at West Kowloon station). See the MTR high speed rail website[https://www.highspeed.mtr.com.hk/en/main/index.html] for the latest schedule and pricing info.

====Hong Kong land border checkpoint crossings====
As at July 2020, the Hong Kong Immigration Dept website[https://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/contactus/control_points.html] lists 6 land border checkpoint crossings operational between Hong Kong and Shenzhen. A 7th is scheduled to open on 2020 August 26. 4 of these are among the world's 7 busiest land border crossings in 2017. All open 7 days per week but with varying opening hours. See list below for details on each of those pairs of control points.

Until metro line 8 opens in August 2020, Shatoujiao checkpoint is Shenzhen's only operational land border checkpoint without Shenzhen metro access. As per the [[Shenzhen#By metro|"By metro"]] section below, the ease of use of the bargain priced Shenzhen metro is invaluable to those who do not speak Chinese. The Shenzhen metro accessible border crossings include the 2 accessible via urban rail in Hong Kong. Hong Kong East Rail Line trains connecting Hung Hom with Lo Wu or Lok Ma Chau Spur Line checkpoints depart every few minutes during service hours (see paragraphs below for specifics on each). Some short trips operate from Hung Hom, so check the destination screen before boarding. For more details, see the MTR web site [http://www.mtr.com.hk].

MTR East Rail Line trains are usually crowded and around rush hours (8-9 am and 5-7 pm) are overcrowded. The line is also heavily used by traders moving goods between Shenzhen and Hong Kong for re-sale. Spare seats are especially difficult to find on the section between Kowloon Tong and Sheung Shui. The front carriage is usually last to fill in both directions and the best bet for obtaining a seat without paying for a 1st class ticket. Hong Kong's MTR East Rail Line connects with the other MTR lines in Hong Kong. For travellers from Hong Kong Island, it is suggested to consider transferring from a Cross Harbour Tunnel bus to Hung Hom Station. Hung Hom Station exit A is the 1st bus stop North of the Cross Harbour Tunnel. Cross Harbour Tunnel buses on Hong Kong Island begin with number 1 (101, 102, 103, 104  etc). Boarding the East Rail Line at Hung Hom station has a massively higher likelihood of obtaining a seat compared to those who transfer from the green MTR Kwun Tong Line at Kowloon Tong station.

The pairs of land border checkpoints are (listed by order of location, East to West):

* 1) Sha Tau Kok/Shatoujiao (in Yantian district). Open 07.00 - 22.00 as a road vehicular border gateway between Hong Kong and places in Eastern Guangdong Province (e.g. Huizhou and Chaoshan). The crossing bridges the opposite sides of the East flowing Sha Tau Kok river (although at this stage of its flow it is more like a stream). This is the only land crossing between Hong Kong and Shenzhen that does not cross the (West flowing) Shenzhen River / Shenzhen Bay. Sha Tau Kok Express buses depart from the bus stations opposite Fanling and Sheung Shui rail stations running to Shatoujiao Checkpoint in Shenzhen via Sha Tao Kok Checkpoint in Hong Kong. Fanling is the nearer of the 2 to Sha Tau Kok. Shatoujiao checkpoint will be given metro access when metro line 8 opens in June 2020.

* 2) Heung Yuen Wai/Liantang (in Luohu District). Opening 26 August 2020.[https://transitjam.com/2020/08/21/7th-boundary-crossing-aims-to-deliver-greater-bay-one-hour-living-circle/] A plan feature is a joint arrivals hall built across the Shenzhen River. Liantang Checkpoint station, on the new Shenzhen metro line 2 extension, is integrated with the border point. The Hong Kong side has bus connections but no trains.

* 3) Man Kam To/Wenjindu (in Luohu district). Open 07.00 - 22.00 to road vehicles across the West flowing Shenzhen River that forms the border. Man Kam To Express buses depart from the bus station opposite Sheung Shui rail station running to Wenjindu Checkpoint in Shenzhen via Man Kam To Checkpoint in Hong Kong. Wenjindu Checkpoint is accessible from Wenjin station on purple line 9 on the Shenzhen metro.

[[Image:Public transport signs on arriving at Luohu from Hong Kong.jpg|thumb|Luohu checkpoint in Shenzhen is 1/2 of the world's 3rd busiest land border crossing. Most arrivers from Hong Kong descend from the checkpoint straight into Luohu metro station entrance A. Shenzhen Railway Station is also nearby.]]
* 4) Lo Wu/Luohu (in Luohu district). Open 6:30 am - midnight. This is the world's 3rd busiest land border crossing with 81 million people crossings in 2017. It is one of the 2 MTR accessed border crossings. Lo Wu is the last stop on this one of the two sections of the MTR East Rail Line. Travellers then cross the border by footbridge. East Rail runs from downtown Kowloon in Hong Kong at Hung Hom Station. The last train to Lo Wu departs Hung Hom a few minutes after 11 pm. The journey from Hung Hom to Lo Wu takes 45 minutes. Subsequent trains from Hung Hom terminate at Sheung Shui. Lo Wu is in Hong Kong's Border Restricted Area with MTR East Rail the only means of public access. A one way ticket costs HKD40 (you can save about HKD4 if you get off and exit the gates at Sheung Shui and get back on again from Sheung Shui to Lo Wu.)  First class is charged double. Lo Wu Station is only open for subsequent travel to Shenzhen or beyond, and a valid travel document is required to travel there. It is often very crowded especially at rush hour, weekends and holidays. Luohu in Shenzhen is accessible to the public by urban rail (metro green line 1) and road.

* 5) Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang (in Futian district). Open 24 x 365 (the only 24 hour border crossing between Hong Kong and Shenzhen). This is the world's 7th busiest land border crossing with over 37 million people crossings in 2017. This crossing is accessible only to road vehicles. Huanggang Checkpoint metro station is on Shenzhen metro blue line 7. Huanggang Checkpoint metro station exit D is approximately a 5 min walk by footbridge over a Shenzhen urban bus station from where the actual border checkpoint is located.

[[Image:20190917 San Tin PTI road sign (2) cropped.jpg|thumb|On leaving San Tin PTI the cross border shuttle buses head for Huanggang in Shenzhen via Lok Ma Chau checkpoint.]]

Lok Ma Chau Checkpoint in the closed border area is served by the nearby open access Lok Ma Chau San Tin Public Transport Interchange (PTI). San Tin PTI is home to  San Tin Cross Border Shuttle Bus Terminus. Yellow coloured shuttle buses run from San Tin PTI via Lok Ma Chau Checkpoint and then across the Shenzhen River to Huanggang Checkpoint. These shuttle buses run 24 x 365, every 5 - 15 mins depending on time of day. The shuttle bus ticket cost is 10 hkd. Passengers using the shuttle buses should:

* A) Enter the Terminal and buy the shuttle bus ticket. Cash or Octopus card are accepted for payment. San Tin PTI has no Octopus card top up facility
* B) Board the shuttle bus outside the terminal exit
* C) Retain your ticket for use later in the journey
* D) Disembark from the shuttle bus on arrival at Lok Ma Chau Checkpoint
* E) Proceed through Lok Ma Chau Checkpoint passport control and customs
* F) On exiting customs, proceed to the end of the row of bus stops to where the yellow shuttle buses can be re-found
* G) Deposit your ticket into the transparent ticket box that is in the custodianship of a ticket inspector at the shuttle bus stop
* H) Re-board the shuttle bus to complete the journey over to Huanggang Checkpoint

In addition to the yellow shuttle bus connecting San Tin PTI with Lok Ma Chau Checkpoint and Huanggang Checkpoint, other bus services use San Tin PTI:

Buses:

* 76K between Ching Ho Estate / Sheung Shui and Long Ping
* 276B between Choi Yuen / Sheung Shui and Tin Shui Wai
* A43P and night service NA43 Airport Express buses between HKIA and Sheung Shui and Fanling. Note that Airport Express buses A43P and NA43 stop at San Tin PTI; Service A43 (i.e. without the 'N' or 'P'), does not stop at San Tin PTI
* B1 between Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point and Tin Shui Wai / Yuen Long
* N73 night bus between San Tin PTI and Sha Tin Central
* Shuttle bus between San Tin PTI and The Boxes shopping mall 250 metres away on the other side of San Sham Road

New Territories green minibuses:

* 75 between Yuen Long and Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point
* 78 between Pat Heung Road near Tai Lam Bus Interchange and San Tin PTI
* 79S is a night service between Tin Shui Wai, Yuen Long and Lok Ma Chau Control Point
* 616S is a night service between Mong Kok and Lok Ma Chau Control Point

Red minibuses (operating from the road in front of the interchange):

* 17 between Sheung Shui and Yuen Long
* Un-numbered red minibus from Kwun Tong via Sha Tin and Sheung Shui displaying a destination of Lok Ma Chau and terminating at San Tin PTI. Due to infrequency of this service, people considering this service are keenly recommended to check the schedule in advance[http://www.16seats.net/eng/rmb/r_kn77.html]
[[Image:Wan_Chai_bus_at_Lok_Ma_Chau_checkpoint.jpg|thumb|right|The bus from Wan Chai operated by All China Express having dropped off passengers at Lok Ma Chau Checkpoint.]] 

The dedicated Hong Transport Department web page has details of public transport utilising Lok Ma Chau Checkpoint [https://www.td.gov.hk/en/transport_in_hong_kong/land_based_cross_boundary_transport/access_to_lok_ma_chau_control_point/index.html]. That includes short-haul cross border buses operated by All China Express to Huanggang checkpoint completely bypassing San Tin PTI. These short-haul cross border buses disembark and re-embark passengers en route at Lok Ma Chau Checkpoint similar to that described above for shuttle bus passengers at Lok Ma Chau Checkpoint. Ticket prices vary by journey length with the most expensive being 52 HKD from Wan Chai as at August 2019 with a 5 HKD surcharge for night services. Prices are reasonable if looking for a direct service between the locations served and Huanggang checkpoint. Check the weblink provided for each route for details of stops en route:

* A) Kam Tin (Kam Sheung Road Station Public Transport Interchange, daily from 6.30 a.m. to 8.00 p.m.)[https://www.td.gov.hk/en/transport_in_hong_kong/land_based_cross_boundary_transport/access_to_lok_ma_chau_control_point/kam_tin_route/index.html]

[[Image:Shenzhen Huanggang border crossing direction to HK.jpg|thumb|right|Sign at Huanggang border crossing in Shenzhen pointing to buses to Hong Kong]]
For the opposite direction in these journeys, after passport control and customs at Huangang, passengers buy a ticket from the ticket office for one of the routes listed at the ticket booths. Buses then take passengers over the river to Lok Ma Chau Checkpoint where passengers disembark for Hong Kong passport control and customs. Passengers then re-board buses near the customs exit point.

[[Image:Huanggang border checkpoint bus ticket office.jpg|thumb|Shenzhen Huanggang border checkpoint ticket office for buses to Hong Kong]]

Note that in Hong Kong, Lok Ma Chau Checkpoint and Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Checkpoint are completely separate border crossings 2 km apart by road. While San Tin PTI has services to both checkpoints, no bus runs directly between the two checkpoints. In Shenzhen even though the respective Huanggang (皇岗口岸) and Futian checkpoints (福田口岸) are only a few hundred metres apart, there are large buildings between the Huanggang and Futian checkpoints making it impractical to walk between the two.

* 6) Lok Ma Chau Spur Line/Futian (in Futian District). 6:30 am to 10:30 pm. This is the world's 5th busiest land border crossing with with over 59 million people crossings in 2017. For travellers to Futian District and other destinations in Central and Western Shenzhen, the most convenient Hong Kong MTR route is to Lok Ma Chau station. Lok Ma Chau is the last stop on this one of the two sections of the MTR East Rail Line. Travellers then cross the border by footbridge. Lok Ma Chau connects directly across the border to Shenzhen Metro red line 4 Futian Checkpoint station. The MTR East Rail train follows the same route from Hung Hom as the Lo Wu service but turns off after the penultimate station at Sheung Shui. The last train to Lok Ma Chau departs Hung Hom a few minutes after 9:30 pm. Futian Checkpoint station is on the red metro line 4 and is also accessible by bus / road. Futian Checkpoint metro station should not be confused with Futian station elsewhere in Shenzhen (See [[Shenzhen#By train|"By Train"]] section below for info on the separate Futian station accessed from Hong Kong by high speed rail). Futian's paired control point at Lok Ma Chau Spur Line is accessible via Lok Ma Chau railway station.

The checkpoint has 2 road public transport services both to/from the West (MTR trains to the checkpoint run to/from the East). Those road services are:

* Bus B1
* Green minibus 75

Both run to/from Yuen Long town centre from where other destinations in Western New Territories can be reached by road and rail. Among public transport destinations from Yuen Long is also bus 968 to Hong Kong Island via the Western Harbour Tunnel.

Bus B1 and green minibus 75 operate via San Tin PTI. San Tin PTI offers many more connections than Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Checkpoint. However other than the 2 afore mentioned road public transport services to/from Yuen Long and beyond, most destinations from Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Checkpoint are quickest reached using the MTR from the checkpoint. The likeliest exception to that is using the Hong Kong airport bus A43P to/from San Tin PTI. Details of public transport to / from Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point are on the dedicated Hong Transport Department web page [https://www.td.gov.hk/en/transport_in_hong_kong/access_to_lok_ma_chau_spur_line_control_point/index.html].

[[Image:Shenzhen Bay Bridge 2.jpg|thumb|The Shenzhen Bay Bridge forms part of the Shenzhen Bay Port.]]
* 7) Shenzhen Bay (in Nanshan district) is the world's 6th busiest land border crossing with over 45 million people crossings in 2017. It is located at the end of a long bridge across Shenzhen Bay connecting Ngau Hom Shek in Hong Kong with Dongjiaotou in Shenzhen. Hong Kong passport control and customs are located in a terminal shared with mainland China border authorities on the Shenzhen side of the bridge. A distinctive landmark visible from the checkpoint is the nearby bullet shaped China Resources Building supertall skyscraper (see Architecture section of this web page). Hong Kong Transport Department's website [https://www.td.gov.hk/en/transport_in_hong_kong/access_to_shenzhen_bay_port/index.html] lists bus and minibus services from Hong Kong to Shenzhen Bay checkpoint as:

* Buses B2/B2P from Yuen Long Station Public Transport Interchange / Tin Tsz Estate Bus Terminus
* Buses B3/B3A/B3X from Tuen Mun Pier Head / Ming Kum LRT Station / Tuen Mun Town Centre
* Green minibus 618 from Tin Shui Wai (Tin Yan Estate)

TILChinalink [https://www.tilchinalink.com/] run unfranchised, cross border buses between Hong Kong and Shenzhen Bay checkpoint and 4 further destinations in Western Shenzhen. As an example price, Wan Chai to Shenzhen Bay checkpoint is 55 HKD. These buses are useful for the direct services offered to/from approx 30 locations in Hong Kong. Anyone interested should check the website directly.

====By train====
Shenzhen is served by several mainline intercity railway stations of which 5 serve HSR. While Shenzhen North is the HSR hub in Shenzhen, Shenzhen North does not serve the HSR trains that operate to/from Shenzhen Station.

[[Image:CRH380A-0251@FTI_(20180927161411).jpg|right|thumb|HSR train at Futian station.]]
* <see name="Futian Station" alt="Futian Zhan" address="" directions="Shenzhen Metro lines 2, 3, 11." phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="" email="" fax=""> Futian station (Chinese: 福田站; pinyin: Fútián Zhàn; Jyutping: Fuk1 Tin4 Zaam6) is a downtown interchange between Shenzhen Metro lines 2, 3 and 11 and the Guangzhou–Shenzhen–Hong Kong HSR link (simplified Chinese: 广深港高速铁路; traditional Chinese: 廣深港高速鐵路). The station opened on 28 June 2011 serving the Shenzhen Metro. Since 30 December 2015 it has been the first underground HSR station on a long-distance line in China. It opened as the 2nd largest underground mainline rail station on earth with floor area the size of 21 football pitches (2nd only to New York’s Grand Central Terminal).

Futian station should not be confused with Futian Checkpoint metro station elsewhere in Shenzhen. Futian is a Southern district of Shenzhen with Futian station in the central business district. Futian is the first HSR station in mainland China after the HSR leaves Hong Kong. 

The first level underground is a concourse with passport control, customs and passenger lounges. The second and third underground levels serve Shenzhen Metro trains. At the fourth level underground is the HSR.</see>

Originally at Dongmen in Luohu at what was then the market town of Shenzhen/Shum Chun, Shenzhen station was relocated in 1950. This station was in turn demolished in 1983 and successively rebuilt and re-modelled multiple times to its current scale.</see>

Shenzhen station has a North-South alignment located immediately North of the East-West running Hong Kong border. Shenzhen station is the Guangshen Railway (previously known as Chinese section of the Kowloon–Canton Railway or KCR) Southern terminus. The Guangshen Railway meets what was known as the British section of the KCR at nearby Lo Wu station in Hong Kong (the British section of the KCR is now known as the Hong Kong East Rail Line). KCR trains between Hung Hom downtown in Hong Kong's Kowloon and Guangzhou East run through Lo Wu and Shenzhen station but do not stop at either nor any other stations in Shenzhen. The only scheduled stop en route for passengers on the KCR is at Dongguan Changping station.

Six platform Shenzhen station serves mostly Guangdong provincial trains and a handful of long-distance sleeper trains from other major cities. A HSR shuttle service runs every 10-15 minutes from/to Guangzhou East Station (with alternate services from/to Guangzhou station. Both Guangzhou East and Guangzhou station have many more long-distance connections). HSR from Shenzhen to Guangzhou East and Guangzhou station does not journey through the Shenzhen North HSR hub (See Shenzhen North below). Guangzhou East is approx 1 hour away and costs 80 RMB one way. Shenzhen station is accessible to Luohu metro station and adjacent to Luohu border checkpoint.

Shenzhen East station interchanges the Guangshen Railway with Buji metro station accessing Shenzhen Metro lines 3 and 5. Shenzhen East exclusively serves non-HSR trains. Trains at Shenzhen East are middle and long-distance from e.g. Sichuan, Human, Hubei, Jiangxi and Anhui provinces. Long-distance trains from Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Guilin and Fuzhou relocated to Shenzhen East from Shenzhen station.</see>

Shenzhen East station opened in 1911 as a freight and Level 3 passenger station (三等站) on the Kowloon–Canton Railway. Initial renovation works commenced in 2004. The station building was demolished in April 2008, and work began on the construction of a new building completed by the end of October 2012. In September 2012, it was announced that the refurbished station would be named "Shenzhen East Station". The Shenzhen East name was originally assigned to a proposed station on the Xiamen–Shenzhen Railway, currently named Shenzhen Pingshan Station (see Shenzhen Pingshan below).

[[Image:Platforms_of_Shenzhenbei_Railway_Station_on_18_Feb_2019.jpg|thumb|Shenzhen North]]

It is the hub of 3 sets of HSR tracks:</see>

* A) From the Northwest at Guangzhou South (the enormous Guangzhou South's 28 platforms make it China's equal 5th largest rail hub as at December 2017)
* B) From the Northeast at Chaoshan
* C) From the South at West Kowloon in Hong Kong

Note Shenzhen North does not serve the Guangzhou and Guangzhou East HSR shuttle trains to Shenzhen station (See Shenzhen Station above). The HSR network configuration makes journeying between Shenzhen station and Shenzhen North impractical by HSR. Alternatives such as changing metro lines at Conference and Exhibition Centre station are recommended should anyone wish to travel between Shenzhen North and Shenzhen station.

Shenzhen North's is in the Northern Bao'an. Shenzhen North's excellent Shenzhen Metro access via red line 4 and purple line 5 with be increased when line 6 opens in June 2020. Shenzhen North station is not to be confused with an older freight station of the same name in Luohu district as still marked on some maps.

HSR trains from/to the East of Shenzhen North run via Pingshan from/to Chaoshan and beyond. Shenzhen Pingshan opened to the public on 28 December 2013.</see>

Shenzhen Pingshan was originally designated as Shenzhen East railway station in initial government announcements (See Shenzhen East above). However this former name has now been used to rename the former Buji railway station as of December 2012. In February 2013, the name of Shenzhen Xincheng Station was adopted by the local railway bureau, however this was dismissed by national railway authorities in October 2013. This was due to existence of another Xincheng Station on the Chinese rail network. In order to avoid any repetition of names and to reflect localities better, it was deemed that the new station would be named Shenzhen Pingshan railway station, after the district of Shenzhen that it is located in.

====By bus====
[[Image:SZ_深圳_Shenzhen_僑社汽車客運站_Qiaoshe_Bus_Terminal_01_carpark_April-2012.JPG|thumb|Qiaoshe Bus Terminal in 2012.]]
Shenzhen has several long-distance bus stations. Luohu Bus Station is adjacent to Luoho border checkpoint and Shenzhen Railways Station. Luoho has regular buses to Dongguan, Guangzhou (Tianhe, Liuhua and Guangyuan stations), Zhuhai, Foshan, Zhongshan, Shantou and many other cities in Guangdong. Luohu bus station has no ticket office - instead bus station employees will ask where you are going and direct you to the bus to buy your ticket from the conductor on board. NOTE if you are going to Guangzhou it's important to check which bus station you will arrive at (qu na ge zhan? - lit. Go to which station?). If you arrive at Guangzhou's Tianhe or Liuhua bus stations, both have metro connections. Many buses travel from/to Guangyuan bus station in Guangzhou's Baiyun district requiring a lengthy bus connection from/to Guangzhou city centre.

===By sea===
====Shekou Harbour Ferry Terminal====
[[Image:2_ferries_at_Shekou_Cruise_Centre.jpg|thumb|Shekou ferry terminal.]]
The current ferry terminal in Shekou in Southwest Shenzhen opened in November 2016. It serves ferries from/to across the Pearl River Delta:

* A) Hong Kong International Airport (see "By Air" section above for more info): 14 services per day of 30 mins duration
* B) Hong Kong Sheung Wan (aka Hong Kong Macau Ferry Terminal): 8-9 services per day of 1 hr duration
* C) Macau Maritime Ferry Terminal: 12-13 services per day of 1 hr duration
* D) Macau Taipa Ferry Terminal: 8-9 services per day of 1 hr duration
* E) Zhuhai Jiuzhou Port: 25 services per day of 1 hr duration
* F) Zhuhai Wailingding Island Ferry Terminal: 1 service per day of 70 mins duration

This is China's first purpose built cruise ship terminal. It is located 1.5 km Southwest of the previous Shekou Ferry Terminal. There are free shuttle buses from the old terminal where the Shenzhen Port Metro Station is  located. The large, spacious new terminal surpasses the old site's cramped, lack of facilities.

The cruise terminal is set to become the home port for several cruise ships targeting the Chinese market. Initially Virgo Cruises and Silver Shadow Cruises will operate from the port.

====Shenzhen Airport Fuyong Port Ferry Terminal====
[[Image:Fuyong_ferry_pier_passengers_disembarking.jpg|thumb|Passengers disembarking at Fuyong ferry pier.]]
Fuyong Port in Western Shenzhen is approx 6 km from Shenzhen Baoan International Airport terminal. Fuyong relocated to its present location in 2010. There is a free shuttle bus from the ferry port arriving at the airport at:

* Terminal A Arrivals, gate 3
* Terminal B Arrivals, gate 6

Fuyong serves ferries to/from:

* A) Hong Kong International Airport: 4 services per day of 40 mins duration
* B) Macau Maritime Terminal: 6 services per day
* C) Macau Taipa Terminal: 1 service per day

==Get around==
Shenzhen being such a new city has the advantage of a planned street grid. Urban planning quality reflects in excellent transport infrastructure. The often flat terrain is advantageous for bicycles and electric vehicles.

'''Shenzhen Tong (深圳通)''' facilitates further convenience of public transport in Shenzhen. This stored value card is similar to an Octopus card in Hong Kong, Oyster card in London etc. Touch the card on the turnstile reader on entering and exiting the station. The card can be bought from a separate stand at metro stations, as well as from special machines. At Luohu station, the stand is located at Exit A. The stand displays the Shenzhen Tong cards and they cost 50 yuan. It can also be used for convenience store purchases.

===Wheelchair, disabled and priority friendliness===

A review of Shenzhen in January 2019 reported, "Shenzhen wheelchair access travel is superior to most other Chinese cities, largely as a result of the recent construction of so much of the city." All Shenzhen's metro lines are wheelchair accessible. Physically disabled passengers are among those to whom the Shenzhen metro is free. Wheelchair friendliness is another beneficiary of Shenzhen's often flat terrain.

Shenzhen's first 25 buses specially disabled friendly buses went into operation in 2006 on route No. 59 (and the corresponding N6 night service), running between Bu Xin bus terminal in Luohu District and Window of the World in Nanshan. Shenzhen's new-energy buses often include wheelchair friendly facilities such as:

* lower floors
* wheelchair ramp
* wheelchair parking space
* cushioning behind the wheelchair space
* wheelchair safety belt
* bells to signal need for assistance

The excellent, ever expanding Shenzhen Metro (深圳地铁) is the most convenient and easy to understand method of transport around the Shenzhen city area. Reliable, regular, clean, efficient, inexpensive and safe. Since Shenzhen hosted the 2011 Universiade Games, signs, exit guides and announcements at metro stations as well as on trains are also in English. Hence it is very easy to get around the metro without Chinese skills. [http://www.szmc.net/page/eng/index.html See the excellent Shenzhen Metro English language website]

The Shenzhen Metro opened in December 2004 as the second rapid transit system in Guangdong province and 7th in mainland China at that time (8th in the People's Republic of China [PRC] since Hong Kong has the 2nd oldest metro system in the PRC after Beijing). The initial line numbering system was subsequently replaced by line names and then subsequently reverted back to line numbers again. On 12 July 2019 it set a new record for its peak daily ridership at 6.63 million. By annual ridership it is 4th busiest anywhere in China and 7th busiest on earth. The extensions opened in 2020 August put the Shenzhen metro at that date at:

* 4th longest in China (including Hong Kong by now dwarfed at less than 1/2 the length of the Shenzhen metro) and 6th longest of any metro system on earth with 382.1 km (237.4 mi) of trackage operating on 10 lines (note there are three separate metro systems in New York City)
* 5th most metro stations in the PRC and 7th most of any metro system on earth with 252 stations

The system is being extended at a jaw droppingly ambitious rate encapsulating so much about Shenzhen's breathtaking expansion, development and 'can do' attitude. Extensions currently at the planning or construction stage are progressing rapidly with schedules to go into operation regularly in the years ahead. By 2030 the network is projected to be longest on earth with 8 express and 24 non-express lines operating 1142 kilometres (709 miles) of trackage.

The 1st trains start at different times on each line between 6.00 and 6.30 am. Trains then arrive every few minutes. Like so many places, during rush hour the metro gets packed. The last journeys on lines commence from starting points around 23.00 and complete around midnight at their terminii. On special occasions the metro is extended later by a further hour. There is a relatively high standard of public courtesy on the Shenzhen Metro. Some customs are unusual to foreigners. For example people will often give their seats up to young children.

If not using Shenzhen Tong (see above for more info), buy metro tokens at station concourse token vending machines. Token machines only accept notes of 5 and 10 yuan. Machines often reject old or worn notes. Line 11 as an express line includes business class carriages. Ticket machines dispense a round plastic token (yellow for business class, green for non-business class). Touch the token on the reader on the entry turnstile and deposit it in the slot on the exit turnstile. Fares are distance based (¥2-14).

* Children under the height of 120 cm or aged below 6 ride for free when accompanied by an adult
* The metro also offers free rides to citizens aged over 65, the physically disabled and military personnel
* Tickets are half priced for children between 120 cm and 150 cm, or aged between 6 and 14 years, or middle school students.

Chegongmiao station (simplified Chinese: 车公庙站; traditional Chinese: 車公廟站; pinyin: Chēgōngmiào Zhàn; Jyutping: Ce1 Gung1 Miu2 Zaam6; literally: 'Che Kung Temple station'), downtown in Futian District is the Shenzhen Metro passenger nucleus. It is the 2nd metro four-line interchange hub in China after Century Avenue station in the Shanghai Metro. Chegongmiao is on metro lines 1, 7, 9 and 11. Passageways within the station prone to peak time overcrowding have coloured arrows on overhead lighting to assist navigation. Chegongmiao station is located underneath Shennan Road, at the west of Xiangmihu Road. It is near China Merchants Bank Tower and Donghai Pacific Mall.

===By bus===
[[File:SBG_59_ZK6120HG_cropped.jpg|thumb|Route 59 was the first Shenzhen bus route to have wheelchair friendly buses.]]
[[Image:HK_SZ_Shenzhen_%E5%AF%B6%E5%AE%89%E5%8D%80_BaoAn_%E8%A5%BF%E7%92%B0%E8%B7%AF_Xihuan_Road_%E6%96%87%E5%8D%9A%E5%AE%AE_Wenbo_Palace_chinese_gate_sign_n_bus_385_April_2017_IX1_cropped.jpg|thumb|Bus 385 at the gate of Wenbo Palace, Xihuan Road, Baoan.]]
In a world leading step against global climate extreming, all 16,000 Shenzhen buses are electric. This makes standing at a Shenzhen bus stop a very different experience to inhaling the choking pollution at a bus stop in nearby Hong Kong.

There are three kinds of city buses: orange short route buses, green longer route buses, and express buses.
The orange buses usually cost ¥1 and have no conductor.
The green buses cost ¥2+. Some have no conductor and a flat fee, on the fare machine. Some have a conductor who will calculate your fare for you.
The express buses are express like the E19 from Xili to Shenzhenwan Border. The E19 is ¥9 and generally the express buses cost more.
Buses are comfortable and almost always air-conditioned. Bus stops are signed in Romanised Chinese. The next bus stop is always announced although it may not be particularly comprehensible. Buses usually stop at all stops so counting stops is a viable alternative for finding out where you are. All announcements are made in Mandarin and English. You can pay with your Shenzhen Tong card (see Metro Section).

Mini-buses have been phased out within the Special Economic Zone but are still operating outside of it. Most bus lines operate every couple of minutes.

Free shuttles run from the basement of Luohu's immigration building to and from various attractions such as spas in the area.

===By bike===
Cycling is not as popular as in Beijing for example but Shenzhen is nearly as cycle-friendly as neighbouring Guangzhou, and much more cycle-friendly than most of neighboring Hong Kong, Macau, and Humen. Downtown is relatively flat and traffic is not as heavy as in other cities (thanks to a good road infrastructure, although bicycle lanes can be sporadic which means bicycles have to run in the vehicle lanes or sidewalks). 

There is a new bike path that runs along a new park the length of the Shenzhen Bay, opened up for the Universiade in July 2011. From there you can go up along the Shahe (Sand River canal) most of the way to the Guangzhou Greenway without crossing any vehicular traffic.  Unfortunately the Guangzhou greenway is not well marked, so it can be difficult to find your way from Shenzhen to neighbouring cities such as Guangzhou. Another small canal also runs north from the southwest of Shenzhen Bay Port, connecting to the bayfront park bike path.

The  Bike rental card is a bit of a hassle to get. By Shekou Wal-mart on XingGong Road, go to the nearby hotel's 4th floor to the bike rental office. Bring your passport, a copy of your passport and 215RMB (115RMB deposit, and 100RMB credit). Ask for option 3. You will need to fill out a form with basic information such as your passport number, date of birth, address, telephone number etc. You will get a receipt to keep if you want to cancel the bike service. After you have filled out the form and paid the deposit the receptionist will give you a demonstration of how to use your new card.

Note that electric-bicycles and motorcycles are banned within the SEZ area. 

Because of Hong Kong's obsolete Frontier Zone policy, you cannot bike between Hong Kong and Shenzhen at the Hong Gang port because the road is closed except to public busses and taxis. You can, however take your 20" folding bike across to take the green public light bus #75 or Kowloon Motor Bus #B1  between there and Hong Kong's Yuen Long (the minibus charges you a HK$7 surcharge but the B1 bus does not, although your bike must be folded and/or packed before boarding).  Hong Kong's MTR is unusually expensive at border terminals, but bikes are allowed on the trains (staff may ask you to take the front wheel off). 20" folding Bikes are also allowed on Shenzhen Metro trains.

===By taxi===
[[File:SZ_深圳灣口岸_Shenzhen_Bay_Port_南山_Nanshan_bus_Stop_square_January_2019_SSG_08_blue_taxis.jpg|thumb|In Shenzhen electric taxis are blue in colour as per these taxis at Shenzhen Bay Port in January 2019.]]
As of January 2019 electrification of Shenzhen's 21,689 taxi fleet has reached 99%.[https://phys.org/news/2019-01-gas-china-shenzhen-electric-taxis.html]. Two kinds of taxis are able to operate in all areas of Shenzhen, distinguished by their color:

* Blue taxis are electric vehicles and fuel surcharge does not apply on them
* Red taxis and Green taxis are petroleum fuel taxis

Unlike neighbouring Hong Kong it is rare to find any drivers who speak English. Hence be sure to have the names and addresses of your destinations written in Chinese to show your taxi driver if you do not speak Mandarin.

Taxi meters start at ¥10.00 for the first 2 km, then ¥0.60 for each 250 meters. Late night costs slightly higher. There is a ¥2.00 fuel surcharge added to all fares. Tipping is not expected at all. Round up to the next Yuan.

Avoid like plague unlicensed taxis including those proliferating places like border crossings and transport hubs. Before entering any taxi cab, ensure it has a taxi license prominently displayed in the plastic holder provided for this purpose on the right hand dashboard of every cab. Unlicensed taxis are illegal and all too often have unscrupulous drivers. Taking an unlicensed taxi makes it likely you will bring trouble upon yourself of potentially infinite magnitude and variety. Anyone who ignores this paragraph and decides to do business with unlicensed taxi drivers, you have been warned.

Taxis are well regulated and managed in Shenzhen. It is very rare to have a licensed driver give passengers problems or take the long way to a destination. Driving standards of licensed taxis are usually competent. However if you are unfortunate enough to feel in danger, don't be afraid to get out and get the next cab. If you have a major problem, threaten to complain (use the word "tousu" (toe-soo) meaning "complaint"). Penalties are believed to be a 200 RMB penalty per complaint - 5 complaints and their license will be revoked!). On the receipt you should get when the driver prints out the ticket is a phone number and his taxi license. Use this if you want to file any type of complaint.

If you ask for a driver from a hotel it is likely they will get a private driver. Negotiate the price before you depart.

The large-scale construction work carried out in Shenzhen since 1980 almost completely destroyed some historical architecture prevalent in the city before its special economic zone status. Some historical buildings in the city are either reconstructions or new models. Despite this, there are still a good number of historical buildings in Shenzhen (see Historical Sites and Religious Structures sections below).

There is a significant number of supertall skyscrapers (over 300 m / 984 ft) either proposed, approved, under construction or completed in Shenzhen. Shenzhen is the skyscraper capital of China's many cities of skyscrapers. At September 2018 Shenzhen had 14 skyscrapers at least 300 metres tall  meriting supertall status. 7 others are under construction with tens of others proposed. 14 completed is second globally to Dubai's 25. The tallest building in Shenzhen is the 599 metre, 115 floor Ping An Finance Centre, which is also the second tallest in China and the fourth tallest building in the world. More skyscrapers were completed in Shenzhen in the year 2016 than in all the USA and Australia combined, such is the rate of skyline transformation.

Many designs have had to be reduced in height due to risks for airlines. Of the three districts with supertall skyscrapers, airline risk especially curtails height designs in Nanshan District close to Shenzhen airport. Nanshan is especially targeted for future skyscraper development. Five of Shenzhen's skyscrapers are among the 40 tallest on earth as at March 2019:

* Ping An International Finance Centre (also known as the Ping An IFC) (Chinese: 平安国际金融中心) at 5033 Yitian Road, Futian District, is a 115-storey supertall skyscraper. 599 metres tall makes it 1 metre short of megatall categorisation. The original design was 660 metres tall including a spire that was removed due to airline risk. The building was commissioned by Ping An Insurance and designed by the American architectural firm Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates. It was completed in 2017, becoming the tallest building in Shenzhen, the 2nd tallest building in China and the 4th tallest building in the world. It also shares the record (with the Shanghai Tower) of having the highest observation deck in a building at 562 m. Nearest Metro - Shopping Park

* The KK100 (Chinese: 京基100), formerly known as Kingkey 100 and Kingkey Finance Tower, is a supertall skyscraper at 5016 Shennan East Road, Luohu District. The mixed-use building rises 441.8 metres (1,449 ft) and contains 100 floors for office space and a hotel. It is currently the second tallest building in Shenzhen as well as being the 22nd tallest building in the world. It is the tallest building ever designed by a British architect. There is a building front water fountain and an observation deck near the top. In December 2011, the Emporis Skyscraper Award awarded the building a fourth place. The building has a height-width ratio of 9.5:1, thus becoming one of China's slimmest buildings. Despite not being tallest, the KK100 apex like appearance when viewed from East or West with the adjacent and also distinctive view of Di Wang Tower, these two buildings together make for many people the defining view of Shenzhen's skyline. Nearest Metro: Grand Theatre.

* China Resources Headquarters (Chinese:华润总部大厦), colloquially known as the Spring Bamboo (Chinese:春笋), is a 392-metre (1,286.1 ft) supertall skyscraper at 2666 Keyuan South Road, Houhai, Nanshan District. A design of 500 metres was reduced due to airline risk. The building topped out on July 1, 2016 and surpassed Shun Hing Square as the 3rd tallest building in Shenzhen upon its completion in 2018. It is 33rd tallest on earth.

* Shum Yip Upperhills Tower 1 is a supertall skyscraper 388 metres (1,273.0 ft) tall at Huanggang Road in Futian District. It is 36th tallest on earth. The tower has a novel structural system called a "Ladder System" where the perimeter mega columns are connected to the central reinforced concrete core at every story as opposed to the typical configuration where they are only connected via outriggers at mechanical floors.

* Shun Hing Square (Chinese: 信兴广场), also known as "Di Wang Tower" (Chinese: 地王大厦) is a 384-metre-tall (1,260 ft) skyscraper. It is 36th tallest on earth. It's twin antennae design paired with the KK100 apex shape combine for the defining outline of Luohu's skyline and for all of Shenzhen for many people. Nearest Metro: Grand Theatre.

===Galleries and museums===

There are thousands of exhibits which mainly contain historical relics and folk heritage of modern times. Many rare photos also attract visitors' eyes. These photos remind people the history of Chung Ying Street and help people get a better understanding this street's importance. Exhibits are distributed across four exhibition halls. The first hall introduces the history of Chung Ying Street and some folk customs. The second hall mainly tells '3.18 Boundary'; it was on March 18, 1898 that the China-Britain Boundary was settled. The third hall introduces many heroic deeds from 1937 to 1945. The fourth hall is about the bright future and accomplishments of reform and opening policies. Atop the museum is a viewing platform where visitors can see Hong Kong's New Territories natural scenery. See detailed text on Ching Ying Street in section on Historical Sites below.</see>

龙岗区布吉街道大芬社区" directions="Dafen (大芬) Stn, Longgang Line" phone="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">In 1988, a Hong Kong businessman called Wong Kong, who had a business specialising in reproduction art, decided that there was no future in Hong Kong and set up in Dafen, even though it was not in the SEZ. Soon he was joined by artists from all over China, some classically trained but many just talented amateurs fresh from the paddy fields. And so Dafen was born. It is set in an old Hakka village and consists of street after street of shops selling oil paintings, watercolors, and embroidered paintings. Examine things carefully, as some artwork is machine printed, rather than hand made. Much of it is rubbish but some of China's best artists also have studios in Dafen. For a few hundred Yuan you can commission an artist to copy your favorite piece of art, your wedding photo, or photos of your family. Insist on "A" quality - it costs a little more but it's worth it. You can also get incredibly rapid framing while you wait and inexpensive art supplies. There is a handsome modern gallery exhibiting works by Dafen local painters. Consider the Qi Xing teahouse, built round several 300 year old Hakka houses with beautiful courtyards.</see>

The Ling Nan (Ling Nan is the Tang Dynasty name for Guangdong and Guangxi provinces) originated in the early 20th century inspired by Japanes westernising schools. Guan Shanyue studied under the school masters and produced some very competent art in that style. He had revolutionary associations and, after the communist takeover, became an arts bureaucrat until he was attacked during the Cultural Revolution. He donated his paintings to the Shenzhen City Government in 1993 and the gallery opened in 1997. It contains exhibits of Guan's work and hosts regular special exhibitions</see>

He Xiangning then became an important leader of the leftist wing of the KMT and after 1949 stayed on in Beijing. Her son, Liao Chengzhi was a leading Communist and head of the organisation that originally controlled the area where the He Xiangning Art Gallery is located, Overseas Chinese Town (OCT) in Eastern Shenzhen.

===Gardens and parks===
Shenzhen is famous in China as being one of its greenest cities with dozens of parks. Only nearby [[Dongguan]] has a greater percentage of its area given over to parks and gardens.

*'''CITIC Minsk aircraft carrier'''(中信明思克航母)  The park by the sea and on land Minsk aircraft carrier Minsk CITIC Plaza is composed of two parts.

*<see name="Fairy Lake Botanical Gardens" alt="仙湖植物公园; Xiān​ Hú​ Zhí​wù​ Gōng​yuán​" address="Lian Shi Rd, Lian Tang Rd, Luohu District 罗湖区莲塘村莲十路" directions="Bus 218, 220 to the garden gate (for bus 218 get off at Foreign Language School stop and walk up Xian Hu Rd to the main gate).

This park sprawls over miles of foothills, valleys, rivers and lakes before climbing half way up Wutong Mountain (see info on Wutong Mountain below). The main attraction is the Hong Fa Buddhist Temple (see entry above) but there are beautiful and peaceful lakes surrounded by teahouses and pavilions which could inspire great poetry. Don't miss the azalea garden, the pertified forest, the paleontology museum or the medicinal plants garden. From the main gates to the various attractions within, there is a bus (¥3 each way) that will drop you near the temple (400 m away).  Purchase the bus tickets before joining the queue. If you choose to walk instead of bus, be prepared for a 30 min gentle inclined walk on awkwardly crowded pavements, next to jammed country roads.  It's also worth noting that on public holidays, weekends and great weather the parks and the temple will be flooded with the locals, becoming more of a family and fun affair, rather than a place of relaxation. Be careful of the burning incense sticks at the temple!</see>

*<see name="Lianhuashan Park" alt="Lotus Mountain Park; 蓮花山公園; Liánhuāshāngōngyuán" address="Hongli Rd W, Futian Central" directions="Shaoniangong Stn on Line 3 & 4 or Lianhua North station on Line 4 phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat=" 22.33.5.22N" long="114.3.1.78E">This is Shenzhen's most central park. Set at the northern end of the Futian central access it is 150 ha of urban bushland. The gardens themselves are extremely beautiful and meticulously cared for. But to really enjoy the mountain, you need to be there with Shenzhen's middle classes early in the morning or on Sundays when large family groups gather to have fun. At the mountaintop, reachable via a 20 minute, not-too-challenging walk, is a large bronze statue of Deng Xiaoping striding out over the city. Large aerobics groups operate to loud music, people play badminton, a man walks down the path inscribing Tang Dynasty poetry in ever evaporating water with an enormous brush. Further down the mountain, ballroom dancers do the tango, a group of belly dancers wiggle and large men lay into each other with bamboo staves and swords. A famous and totally spontaneous group of singers of revolutionary opera sings by the lotus lake every Sunday morning, a must-see if you are even remotely in the vicinity. They are just past the laughter therapy group and the marriage market. And in Autumn, do not forget your kite.</see>

The park spans part of Luohu, Yantian and Longgang districts. This has been a recognised beauty spot since at least the Ming Dynasty when it was included in the Eight Great Views of Xin'an County and was celebrated in poetry. There are three main ridgeline peaks; Lesser Wutong (小梧桐), 692 meters high easily identified by Shenzhen TV Company transmission tower; Bean Curd Head (豆腐头), 706 meters; and Great Wutong (大梧桐), at 943.7 meters is highest. There is a pool on the top of Greater Wutong called Wuling Heavenly Pond (梧岭天池). Starting point choices are east side of Shatoujiao/Yantian, the south side of Xianhu/Liantang, the west of Wutongshan Village, the north side of Longgang, and the north and south entrances. The difficulty level and the scenery along each route vary. The starting point for many is Wutong Village accessed by bus 211 from Luohu. Wutong Village itself is a popular visitor attraction with many cafes, restaurants, spas and craft shops. Many eateries are all-vegetarian. Greater Wutong Mountain from Wutong Village is an 11.4 kilometre moderately trafficked loop trail rated as a difficult hike. It gets busy on public holidays. The broad road is a gentle climb but the Hao Han Slope is notoriously difficult. The walk from Wutong Village to Greater Wutong summit takes around 5 hours in total for the return walk. On a clear day, the views from the summit over Mirs Bay and the mountains of Hong Kong's New Territories are indescribably beautiful. Night views over the city set against the sweep of Shenzhen Bay are also to die for.</see>

People, even long time Shenzhen residents, will confidently tell you that "Shenzhen has no history". However there are a number of important sites, some of great national significance, dating back to the twelfth century. Shenzhen, it seems, was critically involved in a number of historical events, especially the Southern Song Dynasty collapse and final stand (13th century), the Ming Dynasty last stand (17th century) and the Opium War (19th century).

*<see name="Chiwan Left Fort" alt="赤湾左炮台" address="Chiwan First Rd, Chiwan, Nanshan 南山区赤湾一路" directions="" phone="" url="" hours="8am - 5.30pm" price="" lat="" long="">Chiwan was one a prime defensive spots on the Pearl River. The Chiwan Fort was divided into two parts, the Left Fort and the Right Fort. Originally they had twelve gun positions but now only the Left Fort is in any reasonable degree of repair. Perched on Ying Zui Mountain, at over 500 feet above the Pearl River, they commanded a full field of fire. Their failure to make any impression on British ships as they entered the Pearl was one of the Opium War's first great disasters. There is also a statue of Lin Zexu, the Viceroy of the Two Guangs, whose decision to try to destroy the opium trade was a causative factors leading to the Opium War</see>

[[Image:Chung_Ying_Street.JPG|thumb|Chung Ying Street sign]]
*<see name="Chung Ying Street" alt="中英街; Zhōngyīng Jiē" address="Chung Ying Street, Shatoujiao" directions="Take bus 68, B924, or B961 to Zhongyingjie (Chung Ying Street)." phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="">
Note See the Hong Kong Govt website re obtaining a permit that is difficult to obtain[https://www.police.gov.hk/ppp_en/11_useful_info/licences/cap_access.html]. Mainland Chinese residents can obtain access from the Shenzhen side by purchasing an organised tour ticket from the tour operator there. No other form of access is permitted. Chung Ying Street (Chinese: 中英街) is a street on the border between Hong Kong and Shenzhen, within the border town of Sha Tau Kok (Hong Kong) and Shatoujiao (Shenzhen). One street side belongs to Hong Kong and the other belongs to Mainland China. In Cantonese, Chung means China and Ying means England or the United Kingdom.

The street was a river in 1899 of which the British used the high water mark as the border after the Second Convention of Peking, a treaty that China under the Qing dynasty forced the lease of New Territories to Britain in 1899. The river was shallow at the section of Sha Tau Kok eventually drying out pre World War II. The residents on both dried river sides then erected shops to trade. The dried river then renamed Chung Hing Street (traditional Chinese: 中興街; simplified Chinese: 中兴街), and later renamed to Chung Ying Street. The town of Sha Tau Kok subsequently flourished. Because of its location, Sha Tau Kok was also a place through which robbers fled from Hong Kong to China and illegal immigrants came the other way, and one where smuggling syndicates thrived. The British colonial government decided to close the border and the town fell within the Frontier Closed Area.

Being the only area in Hong Kong people from Mainland China could access, Sha Tau Kok was flooded by Chinese tourists, who came to buy goods such as soaps, bolts of fabric and electronic appliances. This turned Chung Ying Street into a bustling shopping area. In the 1980s and 1990s the area received nearly 100,000 tourists a day. Sensing a business opportunity, gold shops and jewellery stores sprang up in Sha Tau Kok. Shops sold out of goods and before they could even restock the shelves, customers would grab goods directly from the delivery trucks. With the easing of restrictions in recent years on individuals from China visiting other parts of Hong Kong, numbers of visiting shoppers from mainland China have declined.

Chung Ying Street is now popular with tourists visiting with 4 principle attractions:

(1) The Ancient Well: Located at the back-street of Chung Ying Street, the ancient well has a history of three hundred years. It is the drinking water source in this area. As an old Chinese saying goes 'One must not forget where the water comes from when drinking it', the friendship of local people on both sides of the street is connected tightly by this well.

(2) Banyan Tree: This one hundred years aged banyan tree is next to the fourth boundary monument. Many artists and writers are likely to use this tree as the material source of creation because the tree root is in Shenzhen and the branches in Hong Kong. The amazing structure embodies the principle that mainland China is always the strongest support of Hong Kong.

(3) Boundary Monuments: There are eight boundary monuments in Chung Ying Street. No.3 to No.7 monuments were destroyed in the war and then re-erected in 1948. No.1 and No.2 monuments have been preserved since being erected in 1905. No. 8 had already sunk in the riverbed. These monuments witnessed a flourishing period of this street.

(4) Zhong-Ying Street Historical Museum: See Museums section above.</see>

This came about after the 17th century Kangxi Emperor depopulated the coastline to a depth of 30km as part of his campaign against Ming loyalists in Taiwan. When the coast was repopulated, the Hakka, descendants of 13th century immigrants from north China, were quicker. Relations between the Hakka and the Cantonese were often strained. During the 19th century, half a million people lost their lives in civil strife between the Hakka and the Cantonese. Accordingly, most Hakka settlements of any size were heavily fortified. The most common form of fortification in south China is the rectangular "wei" or "wai" and the biggest of them anywhere is the Crane Lake Wei in Longgang. It doubles as a museum of Hakka culture.</see>

Founded in 1394, it shared with various other forts the duties of guarding the entrances to the Pearl River and was prominent in the river defence during the Opium War. It is extremely well preserved and currently undergoing restoration as a museum.  You need to take bus M362, which starts at Futian Bus Interchange (Nearest subway is Zhu Zi Lin - Line 1.  As the bus will pass Luohu area, maybe worth asking at the hotel if they know the nearest M362 stop.  When on the bus, ask for Dapeng when paying.  Should be ¥10.  The journey will be to the last stop and will take around 1.5 hours You'll pass by Yantian port and some crappy theme parks.  Once at Dapeng Bus Station (its very small), wait for bus 928 which will take you there at 1RMB, but keep an eye open for the stop.  Alternatively, you can ask one of the motorcycles with the umbrella to take you there at ¥10.  To get back, take bus 928 or B756, back the way you came. Once back at Dapeng Station, take bus E11 and ask for Shenzhen.  It will stop at many stations in the city, so you will need to try to guess the best place to stop</see>

There is little doubt that he died in this general area after fleeing from the Mongols who had taken the dynastic capital Hangzhou. Modern knowledge of the tomb dates back to the latter 19th century when the Zhao (Cantonese Chiu) Clan of Hong Kong (Zhao was the Song Imperial surname) researched the tomb and declared it to be in Chiwan near the great Tin Hau Temple. Certainly there are folk tales of the Emperor's demise current in the Chiwan area and very large numbers of people claiming Imperial descent in the district. But the claims remain debatable. The tomb was restored in the early 20th century and subsequently fell into disrepair. It was rediscovered by a military cook during the Cultural Revolution but left alone. The Shenzhen City Government further restored it in the 1980s. It is in the form of a normal Chinese upper class tomb and the focus of much popular devotion.</see>

===Spas and massage===
Shenzhen is a popular place for Hong Kong people to go to get a massage. Prices are low compared with Hong Kong, though generally higher than elsewhere in China. (洗脚 xǐ jiǎo) (which actually often consists of massaging your shoulders, back, arms, legs, and feet!) costs ¥25-50 for 60-80 minutes depending on the location, time of day, and establishment quality. A full-body massage (按摩 àn mó or 松骨 sōng gǔ) costs ¥50-150 for 90-120 minutes.

In recent years many large spa and massage complexes have appeared in Shenzhen. For an entrance fee of around ¥100 (waived if you purchase around ¥160 of spa and massage services) you get 24 hours of access to a spa pool, saunas, showers, baths, and other amenities depending on the facility such as a gym or pool. Paid services often include Internet access, billiards, and rentable "multi-purpose rooms" with KTV/karaoke and games. Complimentary items include drinks (sometimes restricted to juice) and fruit; food can be bought for ¥20–50 a plate. For around ¥50 for 45 minutes (not including a ¥10–30 tip and often a 10% service charge) you can have head, foot, leg, shoulder, back, or hand massage while lying in one of the many reclining chair-couches — two types at once if you wish — and watch personal TV, read a book, or relax. For around ¥150 you can have 90 minutes of full-body Chinese, Thai, or Hong Kong-style massage in a private room or with your friends. Chinese Medical Massage and aromatherapy oil massages are usually available at a premium. Masseuses and masseurs hail from various regions around China and are listed with pictures and statistics in catalogues and can be selected by number; very few speak any English.

Spa complexes can be found around the border crossings with Hong Kong, so as to cater to the relatively rich Hong Kong population looking to unwind. In the basement of the Luohu customs and immigration building (not the LCC mall) free shuttles are available to various spas. Some have themed waiting areas with price lists and facilities pictures. Some spas have representatives standing around to give out discount tickets (often ¥20) as an enticement.

Massages can be rather painful, especially on the feet! If you can endure it, you'll notice the lasting benefits. But if it is too much, you can say "Teng! Teng!" (pronounced like "tongue") to express your pain and make them ease up. 

Caution: In most hotels, prostitution is widespread. In some seedier areas, "massage" may actually mean sex. Use your best judgment.  See also [[China#Massage|the China article for information on massage]].

===Urban walking===
Shennan Road's simplicity of route, consistently flat terrain and variety of nearby places of interest makes it great for urban walking enthusiasts. Covering its entire length in under 6 hours is very achievable. Such are the variety and number of nearby places of interest along it's route combined with frequency of opportunities for rest and / or refreshment, its easy to spend a full day out walking its length by those who wish to do so. Shennan Road has abundant metro stations as entry/exit points along its route for sightseers only walking part of its length.

==Buy==
Major credit cards (i.e. Visa, Masters, HSBC) are accepted throughout Shenzhen. But note that in many establishments only local Chinese and not International Visa etc cards are recognised. Ask first if they accept international cards. JCB and American Express have limited coverage. Cirrus, Plus & Maestro facilities allow owners to withdraw money from banks (but not all bank ATMs. Bank of China ATMs at all Metro stations accept foreign cards). Remember to activate your card for the pin usage. MixC has ATMs for some international credit cards, where cash can be withdrawn in those ATMs against your credit limit.

Bank of China, China Merchants Bank, and many but not all Chinese banks accept foreign cards. You may check with your bank to see if they have a local branch here. Most ATMs are open for 24 hours. Some are only opened if you swipe the card at the security doors.

At places in Luo Hu, cash is highly recommended. Some places charge an extra 10% for credit card purchases. The shop assistants will bring you to shops that have credit card processing machines. At shopping centers, remember to check with the cashiers to see if they accept credit cards before making purchases. There are few shopping centers that accept credit card with passport verification, though you may lose your discount on the purchase.

To avoid fraud please only buy storage (memory cards, USB sticks, SSD hard drives etc) from the reputable brand stores. Many street vendors in Shenzhen sell fake storage at seemingly low price - you can buy as 64Gb microSD card for $5, but once you copy 64Gb data into it, you'll find that all of it is corrupted, that its real capacity is much less (typically around 8Gb), and it just pretends to have much higher storage. At the very least, if you purchase such a card, before using it fill it up completely with meaningful data (such as pictures), and then see if any get corrupted.

Be careful when getting change from large notes as people may try to give you Hong Kong dollars instead of yuan. The Hong Kong dollar is worth less than yuan. 100-yuan note counterfeiting is also a big problem, so familiarise yourself with Chinese currency security features. Also, expect that most stores will check your notes carefully for counterfeiting, and if you are in a big hurry, have a lot of smaller notes.

Huaqiang Road North metro is part way along." phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="" email="" fax="">This kilometre long pedestrian street is the place for anything electronic. This is the global electronics industry's absolute epicentre and you can buy anything electronic here. There are dozens of buildings each with many floors of small stalls selling electronics items. It's possible to spend days walking around here going through every floor on every building looking at electronics products. Most buildings are set up so that there are two floors with wholesale components and the rest is dedicated to consumer goods.  Accessories like keyboards are mice usually on the top floors, and there a many recycling, cell phone, and electronics repair centres. This area is especially interesting if you are a tech geek since its is also a manufacturing centre, wholesale distribution area, and recycling center so you can see cell phones get made from parts.

Some buildings stock a particular type of item. e.g. One devotes itself to stealth and security. Local smart phones, Android tablets, LED's, and cables each have an entire building devoted entirely to them. If haggling isn't your thing, you can also get consumer electronics at Suning. Gome, Sundan and branded cell phone stores at the street's northern end. Most smaller stores close from around 6 p.m; brand name shops open until 9 p.m. Dozens of small eateries around Huaqiang Bei include a (very) budget priced, Buddhist all-vegan eatery called Pure and Happy round the corner from Huaxin metro exit B and an inexpensive, long opening hours Indian place called Namaste near Huaqiang North metro exit C.

Generally speaking the prices for global brands are the same as in other places. There are deals to be found in local non-branded smart phones and tablets which are often 50% the price of global brands. Accessories are extremely cheap, and you can buy thinks like cables, LED's, and flash cards in bulk. Chain stores offer upfront/no-haggle prices and international warranties. The small stalls do not list prices so you should use the web to look up prices for goods before you buy. Most merchants wholesale if you seek to bulk buy. Also, there are products unavailable anywhere else (like a computer keyboard made of bamboo or a cell phone shaped like a racing car).

Shenzhen being a migrant city, all of China's regional cuisines are represented here. Restaurants range from hole-in-the-wall establishments for homesick working class arrivals to opulent food palaces for businessmen and politicians entertaining clients. If you are a foreigner, spending ¥100 on a fantastic meal is no problem (though, you can spend ¥35 or less on a fantastic meal in Shenzhen). Treat yourself, and enjoy the wonderful food and variety of Shenzhen! There are a lot of bars and restaurants in Shekou which is the main residential zone for Shenzhen's sizable Western expatriate community. There are plenty of eateries in the Hua Qiang Bei area.

Overseas Chinese Town (OCT) is famous for its numerous dining options, including some of Shenzhen's Korean restaurants. All are within easy walking distance from Hua Qiao Cheng (OCT) Metro Station, behind the recently opened InterContinental Shenzhen Hotel.

Shenzhen has abundant vegetarian eateries. Many of these are all-vegan in what they offer and most are at least vegan-friendly.[https://www.happycow.net/asia/china/shenzhen/]

As well as casual restaurants and fine dining, Shenzhen has its '''"Eat Streets"'''. Eat Streets are agglomerations of cheap, in-elaborate restaurants serving food from all over China usually high in sugar, salt and saturated fat. Different Eat Streets often specialise in food from different parts of China. Some of the best known are included below.
[[Image:Miao Ji Xiang Buddhist vegan buffet in Shaibu, Shenzhen.jpg|thumb|The least expensive, best value eateries in Shenzhen are often self-serve, all-you-can-eat buffets in Buddhist run restaurants.]]
The most inexpensive options for vegetarians are the lower priced, sometimes huge, healthy, all-you-can-eat vegetarian buffet restaurants in Shenzhen run by Buddhists. Some of these serve only vegan produce charging less than 20 rmb per person.

==Drink==
'''Tap Water''' is  safe to drink in the Meilin district and several nearby districts, but probably not in the area where you are staying. Use the free bottled water or distilled water provided by your hotel or buy some. It's easily available in all convenience stores. However, if you are buying water for 5 RMB a bottle, you are getting majorly ripped off. 

If you want to '''drink beer''', Tsing Tao is brewed across China and available internationally. Shenzhen's own Kingway Beer (金威啤酒) is brewed in two locations in Shenzhen and available for ¥3.50 per can or ¥3.80 for a large bottle.

==Sleep==
Some listings on airbnb state, "No foreigners". This isn't racism at play by the host; it is the host observing the law. If a non-Chinese national stays as an airbnb guest, both the guest and the host are breaking the law and liable to prosecution.

Note: At Spring Festival (late-Jan to Feb), prices usually double or substantially increase. Unlike other cities, however, the explosive development of hotels in Shenzhen means rooms, while more expensive, will generally still be available even at the busiest times, and hotels are much, much cheaper than HK or Macau.  

Unlike other places, the rates offered by the online websites are usually higher (and in some cases much higher) than the rates you can get if you directly show up at the counter, but you should balance that with the convenience of having a booked room when you arrive.  There is heavy competition between hotels and you will see hotels next to each other advertise specials.

===Wheelchair friendliness===
Handiscoverworld says of Shenzhen, "You can find great hotels and apartments in Shenzhen that offer accommodations to those with a disability. Many hotels of one star and up provide wheelchair service to their customers. Call ahead to ensure that the accommodation of your choice can meet your specific requirements. You will enjoy a large selection of holiday rentals in Shenzhen that fit every budget, whether you are travelling alone or with a large group."[https://blog.handiscover.com/content/destinations/china/accessible-holiday-rentals-shenzhen-disabled-holidays/]

==Colleges and universities==

*'''Shenzhen Polytechnic'''(深圳职业技术学院  Shēn-zhèn-Zhí-yè-Jì-shù),is an educational institute in Shenzhen, China, founded in 1993. Shenzhen Polytechnic is located in Xili in Nanshan District. It has four campuses (East, West, North and OCT). According to its site, it has 21,000 full-time and 6,000 part-time students enrolled.

*'''Shenzhen University'''(深圳大学),is situated on the coastline of Shenzhen Bay in South China. The total campus area is 1.44 square kilometres. It has its own lake which is named Wenshan Lake (文山湖), spreads across rolling hills covered with trees, an abundance of green space and sculptures.

==Cope==
===Communication===
* Get a card from your hotel with the name and address in Chinese characters (if you are lost and no one understands your Mandarin or Cantonese) 

* Get your hotel staff to write down the destination names for you on paper. You may also learn some phrases from the [[Chinese phrasebook|Chinese phrasebook]]. Keep in mind that although English is more widely understood than in most other places in China, outside of establishments which specifically cater to Westerners, few people know English.

* As a migrant city Mandarin has become the lingua franca of daily communication and is more widely spoken than the [[Chinese phrasebook|Cantonese]] common elsewhere in the region. Taxi drivers are much more likely to speak Mandarin than Cantonese. 

* Shenzhen is a linguistic melting pot. In addition to various accents in Mandarin or Cantonese, the other Guangdong languages &mdash; Teochew, and Hakka &mdash; are fairly common, and you may hear languages from other parts of China.

==Stay safe==
===Crime===
Despite sensationalised dramatisations from Hong Kongers, Shenzhen is relatively safe by Western standards. Violent crime is far lower in Shenzhen than in your typical Western city. Those being sensible in Shenzhen are extremely unlikely to have crime related issues. See the tips below.

Visitors from outside mainland China are seen as prospectively lucrative meaning vigilance is especially encouraged in areas such as near immigration checkpoints and near transport hubs. In the central part of Luohu District, especially in areas near the border checkpoint across from Lo Wu (e.g. Luohu Commercial City Shopping Centre, Shenzhen Railway Station, Shenzhen Bus Terminal), pick-pocketing, prostitution, drug trafficking, fraud, and the sale of counterfeit bills are common. Avoiding engagement when approached by someone touting is simple:

* avoid eye contact
* calmly and very gently shake your head
* walk past them

Being scammed is not so common as in Beijing or Shanghai but be alert for people touting for business (massage, watches, shoes, etc.) around Luohu as they sell below-standard fakes at inflated prices. Luohu is a major centre for trade in counterfeit goods abundant in its bars, karaoke salons and nightclubs. Patrons of these establishments from Shenzhen and neighbouring Hong Kong may include triad and other criminal elements.

Avoid like plague unlicensed taxis including those proliferating places like border crossings and transport hubs. Before entering any taxi cab, ensure it has a taxi license prominently displayed in the plastic holder provided for this purpose on the right hand dashboard of every cab. Unlicensed taxis are illegal and all too often have unscrupulous drivers. Taking an unlicensed taxi makes it likely you will bring trouble upon yourself of potentially infinite magnitude and variety. Anyone who ignores this paragraph and decides to do business with unlicensed taxi drivers, you have been warned. See [[Shenzhen#By taxi|By taxi]] above for more info.

Stay alert for scams at bus stations. For example, if you travel between Hong Kong Airport and Shenzhen Airport, you may need to transfer between vehicles when crossing the border between Hong Kong and Shenzhen. Your bus or MPV company may supply you a sticker to attach to your shirt. Once you border cross to Shenzhen, a scammer may spot your sticker, claim to work for the bus or MPV company you are using, and demand you pay an additional fee to complete your journey. If asked for money like this, calmly shake your head and walk away. Use the actual counter of the bus or MPV company you are using if you need directions or other info. The bus / MPV companies are aware of this scam but have no incentive to correct it. Nor do local authorities care. A point though; 'touts' in Luohu bus station may not necessarily be touts. There is no ticketing office so they are simply there to direct you to your bus and won't request payment. Buy your ticket on the bus if you haven't purchased it in advance either online or from an appropriate office.

Watch your bag, electronic devices and pockets against theft / pick pocketing.

Beggars are usually confined to places such as border crossings, underpasses, Shekou and Christian churches. They are not aggressive and are mostly harmless. Ordinary Chinese rarely give money so begging is concentrated in places where punters are either ignorant or have just heard a sermon. Some beggars are controlled by criminal gangs and your donation will be funding organised crime. As such, giving food may be more beneficial to a beggar. Particularly avoid giving money to child beggars. Several high profile court cases in recent years have involved gangs who buy children from impoverished peasant families, mutilate them, and use them in a begging racket.

Prostitution may appear widespread and tolerated, particularly in parts of Luohu and Shekou. It is though illegal and anyone arrested by police can face dire consequences. A high profile 2003 case across the Pearl River in Zhuhai involving a group of Osaka businessmen resulted in 14 prison sentences including life sentences for the 2 main Chinese organisers and a request by Chinese authorities to counterparts in Japan for help to detain 3 people from Osaka (search online for this yourself if you don't believe it, it's all over the media and easy to find). Prostitution is largely run by organised crime gangs with many exploited prostitutes trafficked into forced work. Possession of condoms is used by police in China to incriminate prostitutes. This unsurprisingly discourages prostitutes from carrying condoms. Prostitution is the primary vector for increasing spread of HIV/AIDS in China.

Government corruption has made the press. Shenzhen's former mayor Xu Zongheng was sentence to death (suspended for 2 years) for accepting bribes in June 2009. Li Yugo, the former head of Shenzhen's largest state-owned construction corporation in the city, and Zhao Yutsun, a Shenzhen customs officer, were convicted for similar reasons.

===Roads===
Shenzhen [[Driving in China|driving]] can be sensationalised as aggressive but is little if any worse than Western countries. Like anywhere it is sensible to remain alert; complacency is the enemy of safety. For pedestrians most major roads can be crossed by over or underpasses.

Electric bicycles are popular in Shenzhen. They are a public menace such as by riders who use them on pavements. Be alert.

==Get out==
*[[Guangzhou]] is a short journey by train or road.
*[[Hong Kong]] touches Shenzhen and is easily accessible by foot, auto, subway or ferry.
*[[Zhuhai]] and [[Macau]] can be reached by hovercraft ferry from Shekou.
* [[Dongguan]], a little-known city of 11 million people is just twenty minutes north. Check the space age city centre and the Ming Dynasty gates. Visit the Opium War Museum and the great suspension bridge over the Pearl River at Humen
* [[Huizhou]] is 40 minutes by freeway bus to the northeast. Visit the East Lake designed by 12th-century poet/administrator Su Dongpo.
* [[Xichong]] is a beach village about 70 kilometers to the east of Shenzhen. It is one Shenzhen's nicer and less developed beaches with relatively few tourists.
