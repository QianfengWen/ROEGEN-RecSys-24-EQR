'''Asahikawa''' ({{lang|ja|旭川}}) [http://www.city.asahikawa.hokkaido.jp/] is the second-largest city on the northern island of [[Hokkaido]], [[Japan]]. It is located at the confluence of four rivers and is surrounded by hills. It is located near the centre of Hokkaido, and it is a good base to visit the nearby Taisetsu-zan mountain range and the picturesque Biei-Furano area. The place has few foreigner visitors, though Asahiyama Zoo attracts scores of Japanese tourists.

==Get in==
===By plane===
'''Asahikawa Airport''' ('''AKJ''') serves flights to [[Tokyo]], [[Narita]], [[Osaka]] and [[Nagoya]]. There are also seasonal flights to [[Seoul]] and [[Taipei]]. The airport is a 30-minute bus ride from downtown Asahikawa.

===By train===
Asahikawa is the terminus of the JR Hakodate Main Line to [[Sapporo]], [[Otaru]] and [[Hakodate]].  The station hosts a tourist information centre. Underwent major renovations in 2011.

The ''Super Kamui'' limited express service departs from Sapporo to Asahikawa every 30 minutes. The journey takes 80 minutes and costs &yen;4480. This is the best way to travel between these two cities by train, as local train service is sparse and can take anywhere from three to five hours of traveling time. As the local train fare is &yen;2420, you might want to take the bus unless you are on a [[Seishun 18 Ticket]].

Hourly rapid trains from Sapporo's New Chitose Airport continue as Super Kamui trains to Asahikawa, with no transfer necessary in Sapporo; the journey takes two hours.

Many of JR's Hokkaido lines branch out from Asahikawa: the Soya Line connects to [[Wakkanai]], while the Sekihoku Line connects to [[Abashiri]] and the Furano Line goes to skiing hotspot [[Furano]].

===By bus===
Chuo Bus Service offers frequent (every 20 minutes or so) bus service from the Sapporo JR Station for ¥2000 (¥3750 round trip).  It takes just under 2 hours.

There are some bus services to [[Daisetsuzan National Park]].

=== On foot ===
Most of the sites are easily accessible by foot from the main train station, though others like the zoo, Otokoyama brewery, and the ski resorts need a bus or taxi.

=== By bicycle ===
Most of the town is in flat land and cycling is easy in summer. Cycling is allowed in the pedestrian lane of all streets, and some streets have special bicycle lanes. There are also dedicated lanes along the embankments of most of the rivers (and there are many). Some hotels offer free bicycle rental. Note that the region is covered in thick snow in winter.

==Do==
Asahikawa is the '''coldest city in Japan''', holding Japan's temperature record of -41&deg;C (in 1902).  It's not ''that'' bad most of the time though, and the good side to cold and snow is that there's some great '''skiing''' nearby.  Kamui Ski Links is a local favorite just west of town, and [[Biei]] and [[Furano]] are each about one hour away. Back-country options include [[Asahidake]] and [[Kurodake]].

If you come in summer you will enjoy fine weather with maximum temperatures sometimes exceeding 30 Celsius degrees. Take advantage of the fine '''cycling''' paths following the river banks.

*<do name="Cycling path to Kamuikotan" alt="" address="" directions="Starts from the Asahibashi bridge" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="">This unpaved cycle trail follows an old rail line and tunnels downstream along the right hand side of the Ishikarigawa river as it cuts through the hills. Near the end of the path is the historical (tiny) train station Kamuikotan. About 20 km one way.</do>

*<do name="Cycling path to Higashikagura" alt="" address="" directions="Starts from the cycling bridge upstream of the Twin Harp bridge" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="43.7277" long="142.407617">This is a paved cycle trail upstream along the right hand side of the Chuubetsu river. The path has no major slopes except the last few hundred metres and it is set between the river bank and endless rice fields, heading towards the imposing Taisetsu-san mountain. The path ends in a wooden hill with a pond and a camping site. About 15 km one way.</do>

==Buy==
Asahikawa's main shopping area is just next to the train station, in what is called the '''Kaimono Koen''' ("shopping park"). When it was built in 1972 it became the first pedestrian-only outdoor shopping mall in Japan. The street is lined with department stores, shops, cafes, and restaurants.  A more remote area is the '''Arashiyama pottery village'''. Located on a hill overlooking Asahikawa to the north, this neighbourhood has several crafts workshops including pottery, glass craft, wood work, and textile. Some of these offer courses and many of them have a display area where visitors can see and buy their products.

==Eat==
Asahikawa is known as one of Japan's gourmet towns, and despite its small size, contains many restaurants of nearly every description.  Many restaurants are clustered in the Kaimono Koen (Shopping District Park) area, in front of the JR station.  This makes touring a number of restaurants on foot a viable option for a day trip.  Asahikawa's '''ramen''' noodles are nationally famous, with ''shoyu'' (soy sauce) being the flavor of choice.  There are also a large number of ethnic restaurants.  Hokkaido is generally known for having good dairy products, and Asahikawa is no exception.

==Drink==
Asahikawa is famous for its sake, especially '''Otokoyama''' (男山, lit. "man mountain"), which is probably Hokkaido's best-known label.  Other local sakes include ''Takasago'' (高砂) and ''Taisetsu no Kura'' (大雪の蔵).  Beer fans will wish to look for the local ''Taisetsu'' microbrew.

*<drink name="Taisetsu-ji Brewery" alt="" address="11-1604-1 Miyashitadori" directions="Near the train station, past the Kitasaito Hospital" phone="+81 0166 25-040" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="">Set in an old brick warehouse near the railway station, this beer pub offers its own brewed beer in a western setting.

==Get out==
Being in the center of Hokkaido, Asahikawa is a good base to explore other parts of the island.

* [[Furano]] is a village set in a picturesque landscape that is often used in Japanese dramas and advertisements about quiet, rural life in Japan. A popular way to travel between Asahikawa and Furano in summer is the Norokko-go, an old style locomotive that runs purposedly at a very slow speed.

* [[Sounkyo Gorge]] and [[Asahidake]] at the [[Daisetsuzan National Park]], with very popular onsens (hot-spring resorts) and fine mountain hiking.
