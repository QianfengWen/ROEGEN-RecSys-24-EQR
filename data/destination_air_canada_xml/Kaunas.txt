Kaunas is the second-largest city in Lithuania. For a time, it acted as a temporary capital, benefiting from investment and status.

Between the 4th and 5th century BC at the confluence of the two largest Lithuanian rivers, the settlement was established. In the 14th century, a castle was built here. It is considered to be one of the oldest stone castles in Lithuania.

Kaunas was first mentioned in written Teutonic Knights sources in 1361 when Knights captured the town and destroyed the Kaunas Castle in 1362. Castle was rebuilt at the beginning of the 15th century.

In 1408 Vytautas the Great granted the rights of the Magdeburg to Kaunas. While being located at the intersection of the trade routes and a river port Kaunas it has become one of the major trade centers in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and joined the Hanseatic League in 1441. By the 15th century, Kaunas was one of the best-formed towns in the whole country. 

The people of Kaunas are used to any weather and life goes on with great efficiency. Museums have cloakrooms, everywhere is well heated and draft-proofed, supermarkets have lockers to leave your coats, hats, scarves, gloves, sleds, and so on, and nobody minds you sipping vodka from a 200&nbsp;ml bottle to keep your insides warm. You will notice that some couples had attached padlocks to the bridge with their names scratched or painted on - a custom one may have observed elsewhere in Eastern Europe. The gist is pretty clear and the bridge to the park is an ideal location to continue. Go for the ones with the longest hasp (loop) as the bars of the bridge are really thick. Failing that attach yours to one that is already there! Take note, that [[Lithuanian phrasebook]] is very useful while in Kaunas or other sites of Lithuania. 

===Climate===
The best time to visit Kaunas is from early May to late August. July has the highest mean temperature, 16.0 °C (63.0 °F). Most of Kaunas‘s annual events are held during spring and summer time. The rainy season often starts July, yet at the same time rains are short in time. Winter can be sometimes stinging cold, with short daylight hours.

'''Kaunas international airport'''[https://www.kaunas-airport.lt/en/], ({{IATA|KUN}}, {{ICAO|EYKA}}) can accommodate planes of practically all types, though recently it is served exclusively by the largest [[Discount airlines in Europe|low cost airline]] in [[Europe]] '''Ryanair'''[https://www.ryanair.com/gb/en]. The airport is located 14km /8&nbsp;miles (~25-30min drive) from the Kaunas downtown and directly linked to the '''A6/E262''' (Kaunas-[[Daugavpils]]) highway, which borders the airport's northern boundaries and meets up with '''A1/E85''' motorway at the '''Murava''' junction about 7km south from the airport. 
 
Kaunas airport has been chosen as first '''Ryanair''' base in [[Central Europe]] in May 2010. Today it connects Kaunas with [[Rimini]], [[Birmingham]], [[Bristol]], [[Brussels]]-South Charleroi, [[Dublin]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Frankfurt]]-Hahn, [[Leeds]]-Bradford, [[Liverpool]], [[London]]-Gatwick, Luton and Stansted, [[Madrid]], [[Milan]], [[Oslo]]-Rygge, [[Stockholm]]-Skavsta, [[Tampere]], and [[Helsinki]].

In summer season there are flights to the Greek islands [[Kos]] and [[Rhodes]], [[Alicante]] and [[Mallorca]] in Spain, as well as [[Pafos]] in [[Cyprus]], and [[Malta]].

A new modern terminal for passengers was opened in March 2008, the airport itself has been substantially renewed, and the works were completed in Nov&nbsp;2010. There are some vendors in the terminal building, including a restaurant, bars, and duty-free shops, as well as car rentals. Travel agency, currency exchange, and ATM services are also available.

Kaunas usually is a safe place but everyone should take some precautions against pickpockets and baggage theft, especially in public transport and at stations.

Opposite the central train station, there is a "Station‘ market“ - a rough area, especially in the evenings. The baggage lockers in Kaunas railway station are a cheap and secure place to store bags and other items.
