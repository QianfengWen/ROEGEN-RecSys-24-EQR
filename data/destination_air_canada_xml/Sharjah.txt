'''Sharjah'''[http://www.sharjahtourism.ae] (الشارقة) is the capital of [[Sharjah (emirate)|Sharjah]] emirate and is the third largest city in the [[United Arab Emirates]].

==Understand==
Sharjah is the fourth largest of the seven emirates that make up the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and is the only one to have land on both the Persian Gulf Coast and the Gulf of Oman. Sharjah is also next to [[Dubai]] and is effectively its suburb, with commuter traffic creating rush hour traffic jams.  Expatriates generally live in Sharjah and work in Dubai because cost of living is cheaper in Sharjah, but better jobs are in Dubai. 

However, the emirate is considerably larger than Dubai with coastline on both West and East coast of the peninsula, with exclaves of Kalba, Khor Fakkan, and Dibba Al Hisn. The road to the east coast goes through rugged Al Hajar mountains. Public buildings in the Emirate were all designed by the present Shaikh (a qualified architect), a nice visual change from the usual fare of skyscrapers in other Emirates. 

The Sharjah Commerce and Tourism website[http://www.sharjah-welcome.com/en/home] has sections on business, heritage, leisure, education, and coast.

==Get in==
See the [[Sharjah (emirate)#Get in|Get in]] section of the Sharjah Emirate page for details on international and inter-emirate travel connections.

==Get around==
Public buses are by Sharjah Transport,[http://www.stc.gov.ae/en] There are seven local and three express routes. Dubai's RTA also offers express commuter bus service. Licensed taxi companies are Sharjah, Emirates, Citi, Union, and Advantage. Taxi plates are reflective green, helps  spot them at night. Flag fall is Dhs. 3, then Dhs. 1 every 650 m. There is a surcharge of Dhs. 20 to go into Dubai.

*'''Heritage Area''' - Good overview available here including a few restoration of old houses. The Heritage is situated near the Corniche between Burj Avenue & Al-Maraija Road. Many historic buildings have been reconstructed with traditional materials. The most interesting sites are  ''Al Hisn Fort'', Literature Square with ''House of Poetry'', ''Sharjah Museum of Islamic Civilization'', ''Sharjah Heritage Museum'' and ''Souq al-Arsa''. Most sites in the Heritage Area have opening times set aside solely for women. Visitors of both genders should make certain of these on arrival in the city.

==Stay safe==
Sharjah is one of the safest cities in the world.

If you pay with an overseas credit card, most merchants will attempt to apply ''dynamic currency conversion'', charging several percent more than the issuer conversion would have cost. Unlike in some countries, the UAE merchants will ''not'' inform you of the choice and will choose to accept the conversion without asking. It is usually possible to intervene and ask "No" to be answered.
