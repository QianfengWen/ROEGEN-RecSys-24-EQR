'''Killeen''' is a city in the [[German Hill Country]] of [[Texas]].

==Get in==
Killeen has its own airport, the Killeen-Ft. Hood Regional Airport, which offers service to Dallas, Houston, and Atlanta.  However, rates at Killeen's airport are often higher than rates at Austin's Bergstrom International Airport, which is only an hour and a half to the south of Killeen.  Check both rates before booking a flight.

==Get around==
In recent years, Killeen has become increasingly easy to get around without a car, thanks to the municipal bus service provided by "The HOP."  HOP stops are located throughout the city, some of which are only a few blocks apart.  To find out the HOP schedule from a particular stop, call (254) 616-6800. The buses usually stop running before it gets dark.  With a car, Killeen can be difficult to navigate, due to the irregular street pattern that exists outside of downtown.  A map of the city (which can be purchased at Wal-Mart or at local convenience stores) can be very helpful.

==See==
*<see name="Fort Hood" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="">Unfortunately, Killeen is somewhat lacking in tourist attractions.  However, there are a few things to see and do around town, if for some reason you should find yourself here visiting family or for whatever other reason. Fort Hood, the largest military base in the world, borders the northern and western edges of town. If you can get on base (you must be with or related to military personnel or civil service worker), there is a good Cavalry Museum to see, and you can drive down Battalion Avenue, which is lined with barracks and Army buildings, to get a glimpse of life on a military reservation.  Since most of Killeen dates from the 1940s or later, there are not many historic buildings. There is, however, a nice little chapel dating from 1882 (Bethel Primitive Baptist Church), that offers scheduled tours, and there are a number of turn-of-the-century buildings and small shops lining North 2nd Street in the downtown area. If you are an Elvis fan you can check out the house he lived in while he was stationed at Fort Hood.</see>

==Buy==
With not much else to do, Killeen does offer plenty of shopping. The Killeen Mall has over 100 stores but has become somewhat run-down in recent years. The Market Heights shopping area, in Harker Heights (a suburb bordering Killeen on the east), is the area's newest and most upscale shopping venue, boasting a Barnes & Noble Bookstore, Target, a large Cineplex movie theater, high-end spirits shop, a few clothing stores, and a number of restaurants.  Killeen is dotted with strip malls, few of which have anything good.

==Stay safe==
There have been a couple of well-known mass murders in Killeen - at a Luby's restaurant in 1991 and at Fort Hood in 2009.  Despite these, Killeen is a relatively safe city.
