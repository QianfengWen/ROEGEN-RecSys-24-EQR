'''Reykjavík''' [http://www.visitreykjavik.is/] is the capital and largest city of [[Iceland]] with over 130,000 inhabitants and with an urban area population of around 240,000, it is the home of the vast majority of Iceland's inhabitants. It is the centre of culture and life of the Icelandic people as well as a focal point of tourism in Iceland. The city itself is spread out, with sprawling suburbs. The city centre, however, is a very small area characterized by eclectic and colourful houses, with good shopping, dining, and drinking.

===History===
When it started to develop as a town in the 18th century, Reykjavík had already been inhabited for almost a thousand years. Legend has it that the first permanent settler in Iceland was a Norwegian named Ingólfur Arnarson. He is said to have thrown his seat pillars into the sea en route to Iceland, and decided to settle wherever the pillars were found. The pillars washed up in Reykjavík, and so that was where he set up his farm.

Although the story of Ingólfur Arnarson is not widely believed to be true by modern historians, it's clear that Reykjavík was one of the very first settlements in Iceland. Archaeological remains confirm that people were living there around the year 871, and for the first few centuries of Icelandic settlement Reykjavík was a large manor farm. Its fortunes steadily waned as other centres of power increased in importance. By the 18th century, the farm of Reykjavík was owned by the king of Denmark (under whose domain Iceland fell at the time). In 1752, the estate was donated to a firm, Innréttingarnar, led by Icelandic politician Skúli Magnússon. Innréttingarnar were meant to become an important industrial exporter and a source of development in Iceland, and their main base was in what is now the heart of Reykjavík. Although the company didn't achieve all its high ideals, it did lay the foundations of Reykjavík as it is today. In 1786, Reykjavík got a trading charter and it soon started to grow in importance.

The year 1801 is when Reykjavík went from being the largest town in the country to its capital. That year a new supreme court, Landsyfirréttur, was set up in the city after the abolition of Alþingi (which no longer had any legislative functions). The same year the office of the Bishop of Iceland was founded in Reykjavík, merging the bishoprics of Hólar and Skálholt. In 1845, Alþingi was re-founded as an advisory council to the king on the affairs of Iceland, located in Reykjavík and in 1874 it regained legislative powers. As the sovereignty of the country grew, so too did Reykjavík, which by the beginning of the 20th century had been transformed from a small trading and fishing village to a fully fledged capital.

The Second World War was a boom era in Reykjavík. The city wasn't directly affected by the many horrors of the war, but the occupation of Iceland by first the UK and later the US provided increased employment opportunities and inflows of cash that enabled the rapid expansion and modernisation of the Icelandic fishing fleet. Reykjavík was a leader in this development and it grew very rapidly in the years following the war. New suburbs were built and the city started to reach across municipal limits, subsuming various surrounding communities. The city continued expanding until the financial collapse of 2008. 

Due to its young age, and in particular its rapid expansion in the late 20th century, Reykjavík is very different from the other Nordic capitals. It lacks their grand buildings and the picturesque old quarters. Instead it has come to resemble cities on Canada's east coast with their sprawling suburbs and big motorways, as was recommended by the urban planners of the post-World War 2 era. Nevertheless Reykjavík has a charm of its own, quite unique, shaped by the dualistic nature of this place which still doesn't seem to have made up its mind on whether it's a small town or a big city.

The weather in Reykjavík is notoriously unpredictable. One minute the sun may be shining on a nice summers day, the next it may change into a windy, rainy autumn. Temperatures in Reykjavík are quite bland: They don't go very high in the summer, nor do they go much below zero during winter. It follows that the differences between seasons are relatively small compared to what people experience on either side of the Atlantic. 

January is the coldest month and usually has some snow, while there is frequently no snow on the ground during Christmas in December. Summer is without a doubt the favorite season of most Reykjavík inhabitants. Many of them seem to imagine their city is slightly warmer than it really is and it takes little to get them to start wearing shorts and t-shirts, or to go sunbathing in parks. Don't think too much about how silly it may seem, just join them in enjoying the season!

Wind is the main problem with the Reykjavík weather. The city is quite open to the seas, and the winds can be strong and chilling to the bone. Windy spots generally feel significantly colder than those with more shelter.

===Literature===
*''The Fish Can Sing'' (Halldór Laxness, 1957). A story of a young boy growing up on a farm on the outskirts of Reykjavík in the early 20th century, during a period of rapid change in Iceland. Like many of the stories by Nobel laureate Halldór Laxness, The Fish Can Sing (''Brekkukotsannáll'', "The Annal of Brekkukot", in Icelandic) is partly based on real people and places, although names have been changed.
*''101 Reykjavik'' (Hallgrímur Helgason, 1996). The quintessential book about downtown Reykjavík, capturing its spirit in a way no other book has. The main character never leaves postcode 101 if he doesn't need to, and spends his time either in bars and clubs or at home doing nothing. He has since become seen by many (who don't live in central Reykjavík themselves) as the model for the "101-type".
*''Jar City'' (Arnaldur Indriðason, 2000). A crime novel about the detective Erlendur, with the Reykjavík criminal police department. Portrays the grittier sides of the city, although perhaps slightly exaggerated for the sake of writing a good story. The book has also been translated as ''Tainted Blood'', but the original Icelandic title (''Mýrin'', "the swamp") refers to the Norðurmýri neighbourhood, by the city centre. Arnaldur has written 10 further books about the detective, most of them happening in or around Reykjavík.

==Get in==

===By plane===

Two airports serve the Reykjavík area, one for international flights and another for domestic flights. They are 50 km away from each other.

[[File:Reykjavik international airport.jpg|thumb|Reykjavik international airport]]
'''Keflavík International Airport''' (Icelandic: Keflavíkurflugvöllur, IATA: KEF, ICAO: BIKF) [http://www.kefairport.is/english/]
International Airport is Iceland's main international airport, and is located 50 km southwest of Reykjavík, in the town of [[Keflavík]]. Note that WOW Air is now out of business as of 20 March 2019.  Some of the international airlines flying to Keflavík include:

To travel between the airport and Reykjavik city center:
* '''Flybus''' [https://www.re.is/flybus/] offers regular service to either the BSI bus terminal, just south of the city center (45 minutes, 2,950 ISK one-way or 5,500 ISK round trip) or directly to Reykjavik hotels with advance notice to the driver (3,950 ISK one-way or 6,950 ISK round-trip). Buses leave the airport as early as 3:30 AM. Tickets can be bought either at the airport or online.  Viator or other vendors may be cheaper.
* '''Gray Line Airport Express''' [http://www.airportexpress.is/] offers regular service (45 minutes, 2,400 ISK one-way or 4,800 ISK round trip) directly to Reykjavik hotels with advance notice to the driver (at no cost). Tickets can be bought either at the airport or online. Note that if you purchase return tickets, the "Pick Up Time" on your ticket is the departure time for the coach between the Gray Line Terminal and the Airport, not your accommodation or the City Centre Sales Office.
* '''Bus nr. 55''' [http://www.bus.is/] is the public city bus that operates between the airport and the city (''1 hour 15 minutes'', 1,760 ISK one-way). Tickets can be bought on the bus. Check the time schedule as this bus line is mostly used by people who work at the airport and convenient for their working time. Bus 55 operates on weekends, but does not go into Reykjavik. The bus runs every hour. Bus 55 is synchronized with Bus 1 timetable; the latter takes you to the city. If you do not want / cannot exchange money (on weekends banks are closed and hotels cannot exchange money); you can buy tickets with credit card when boarding bus 55 at the airport (bus stop is in the middle of a parking lot, close to rental car bus stop).  Buy 4 segments and you can use them on Bus 1 as well.  On the way back, go to 10-11 store (there is one close to Hlemmur bus terminal) and buy a segment for Bus 1 with a credit card and then you can buy the rest on bus 55 with a credit card again. 
* '''Taxis''' cost 20,000 ISK for 1-4 passengers and 26,000 ISK for 5-8 passengers.

'''Reykjavík Airport''' (Icelandic: Reykjavíkurflugvöllur, IATA: RKV, ICAO: BIRK)

:*'''[http://www.airiceland.is Air Iceland]''' - operates domestic flights to [[Akureyri]], [[Egilstaðir]] and [[Ísafjörður]], international flights to the [[Faroe Islands]] and several airports in [[Greenland]]. Leaves from a terminal on the west side of the airport.

:*'''[http://www.eagleair.is Eagle Air]''' - operates domestic flights to [[Bíldudalur]], [[Gjögur]], [[Sauðárkrókur]], [[Höfn]] and [[Vestmannaeyjar]]. Leaves from a terminal on the east side of the airport.

===By bus===

'''Sterna''' [http://www.sterna.is] and '''Reykjavík Excursions''' [http://www.re.is] operate regular bus service from [[West Iceland]], [[South Iceland]] and [[Akureyri]]. If you find yourself in other parts of the country, it will be difficult to find a direct bus route to Reykjavík. The best option, if relying on buses, is to first get into the aforementioned regions and catch a bus to Reykjavík from there. This will probably require an overnight stay.

===By car===

Three main roads serve as entry points into Reykjavík: 
* Reykjanesbraut (Road 40), enters the city from the west linking it to [[Southwest Iceland]] and Keflavík International Airport; 
* The Ring Road (Road 1), enters the city from both east and north. 

If you're driving into town from [[South|South Iceland]] or [[West Iceland]], beware of some quite heavy traffic jams on Sundays when people are going back home after a weekend away. This mainly applies during the summer, and becomes even worse on Mondays after three-day weekends, not to mention if the weather has been good.

====Renting A Car====
There are rental car services all over Iceland, and many in Reykjavík. The cheapest car at the cheapest dealer you may find would average out to about 5500 ISK each day. If you intend to just stay in Reykjavík, renting a car is not necessary as the bus system is great and it is easy to walk around. If you plan to leave Reykjavík and go to the countryside, then renting a car is the best way to experience Iceland.  It is much cheaper to rent a car from the facility next to the BSI Bus Station (Hertz, Europcar and several local agencies have a presence here) than from Keflavik Airport.

===By boat===

Several cruise liners stop in Reykjavík each summer, mostly arriving in Sundahöfn which is 3 kilometers east from the city centre. Cruise Iceland is a website run by several companies that service cruise liners in the country and has a list of companies that sail to Iceland: [http://www.cruiseiceland.com/cruise-lines/cruise-lines/cruise-lines.html].

Reykjavík itself is not served by any ferries, but if you have an abundance of time it is possible to take the Smyril Line (a cruise company based out of the Faroe Islands) from [[Hirtshals]] or [[Esbjerg]] to [[Seyðisfjörður]] (a small town on the east of Iceland), via [[Tórshavn]]. This service is on the expensive side, and puts you on the other side of the country. However, it offers the possibility of bringing a car, which can be one of the best ways to travel around Iceland. If you take the ferry and drive from Seyðisfjörður to Reykjavík, you should plan to spend the night somewhere along the way.

Of course, if you have a boat capable of crossing the Atlantic it is possible to sail to Reykjavík. Check with the port authority, the United Ports of Faxaflói [http://faxafloahafnir.is/faxafloahafnir/en/], to find out about harbour options.

==Get around==

===On foot===

[[Image:Reykjavik 7.JPG|thumb|300px|Looking over a residential area towards Hallgrímskirkja. In the distance on the left is Akrafjall.]]
[[File:Reykjavik Street (general view).jpg|thumb|Reykjavik Street]]

Walking in Reykjavík is highly recommended, as many attractions are within walking distance from the hotel area. The city is very beautiful, and the sidewalk and pathway system is first-rate. Reykjavík drivers are in general very friendly, and will sometimes stop for you even when there is no crossing facility.

Unknown to many tourists a very long and scenic pathway for walking and cycling circles almost the whole city.  A good starting point is anywhere where the city touches the sea.  The path leads by an outdoor swimming pool, a sandy beach, a golf course, and a salmon river.

===By bus===

Reykjavík has a public bus system that is clean and reliable, called '''Strætó''' [http://www.straeto.is/english]. The price of a single fare for adults within the capital area is 550 ISK (2023). The price for kids aged 12-17 is 275 ISK. 0-11 years old ride for free. When paying with cash, please note that drivers cannot give any change (May 2017). Travelers that are going to spend couple of days in the capital, can also get one or three day passes. These passes can be used without limit in the capital area through the date which is stated on the pass. The prices for the passes are: One day pass: 2,200 ISK (2023) and Three-day pass: 5,000 ISK (2023). If you need to switch buses to get to your final destination, '''ask the driver for a transfer ticket''' (''skiptimiði''), which is valid for the next 75 minutes on any bus. The exchange ticket is only necessary when customers pay for fares via cash or bus tickets. If you are using a 1 or 3 day pass you can just show your pass. There is an app, ''Strætó'' on Google Play/App store.

If you're staying outside the city centre it may be best best to get a '''Reykjavík City Card''', which allows unlimited access to the buses, along with free access to several museums, some discounts and free internet at the hostel. The 'City' cards are available at the Tourist Information Center inside City Hall, and also at some hotels.  A one-day card costs 3500 kr., two days costs 4700 kr., and three days costs 5500 ISK (April 2016). Other possibilities include buying 11 tickets for 3,000 kr., a 1-day pass at 800 kr. or a 3-day pass at 2,000 kr. If you're staying for longer you can buy a long-term pass: A green pass lasts a month and costs 11,750 ISK. (Oct 2017), a red pass is for three months and costs 25,700 ISK (Oct 2017) and a blue pass lasts 9 months and costs 61,000 ISK (Oct 2017).

Strætó drives to various places around Iceland. Buses that travel outside the capital usually have a blue and yellow color. These buses accept cards, cash (they can give change) and bus tickets. Passengers pay for the fares on board of the bus. The prices between location varies on how many districts the passenger travels through. The capital area is one district and every trip within the capital area costs a single fare. 440 ISK or 1 bus ticket.  So, when traveling outside the capital, passengers pay for each district they travel through. For example: A trip from Reykjavík to Akureyri is through 22 districts. Therefore, the price to Akureyri is 9,680 ISK (which is 440 x 22) or 22 bus tickets. The trip between Reykjavík and Keflavík International Airport is through four districts and the price is 1.760 ISK or 4 bus tickets.

'''Hlemmur''' and '''Lækjartorg''' are the main bus interchanges in central Reykjavík, with buses that can take you to any part of the city. The Strætó system has buses going all the way east to [[Selfoss]] and north to [[Akranes]], the former leaving from Mjódd and the latter from  Háholt. Both of these stations can be reached from Hlemmur.

Note that while most areas of Reykjavík and the neighboring towns are accessible by bus, the last buses leave around 11pm and the city has no night buses.

===By car===

Driving in Reykjavík is the preferred method for most residents there. As a tourist though, you should be able to manage without a car if you're only staying in the city.  Driving is recommended though for travel outside of Reykjavík and its suburbs. Note that many streets in central Reykjavík are one-way only and some of them are closed to cars in good weather.

Compared to most other modern European cities, Reykjavík actually manages to have a reasonable number of parking spaces, especially for a city that boasts the most cars per capita in the world. If you're in the centre and can't find a place to park, there are big parking lots by the harbour and in front of Kolaportið (the flea market). Parking spaces in the city centre generally have parking meters charging between 80 and 340 kr. per hour. The city recently introduced a new type of meters and you can now pay by card if you don't have coins on you. In the city center parking is arranged into 4 parking zones which are all clearly identified on blue signs P1, P2, P3, P4. Parking must be paid 0900-1800 Monday to Saturday. Central meters should be in every block or at least corner. The machine can be set for various languages. It is important to note that you must enter the license plate number of your car into the machine. Coins or credit cards accepted. The price per hour is ISK340 in P1, ISK170 in P2, and lower for the other zones (2018). You can also pay for a whole day, which is sometimes cheaper than the hours you want... handy if you are staying downtown with the car parked. You can also come and go on the same parking payment since your license plate number has been entered on the receipt, as long as you repark in the same zone you paid for. The fine for not paying is ISK2400 if paid within 7 days. It can be difficult to find street parking in evenings when residents are using it.

===By taxi===

The main taxi companies in Reykjavík are City Taxi (+354 422 2222), Hreyfill-Bæjarleiðir (+354 588 5522) and BSR (+354 561 0000).  All taxis are metered and most are very clean and comfortable, but be warned that travelling by taxi is one of the most expensive ways of getting around Reykjavík. There is a start fee of 600-700 kr. and a fee of 200-400 kr. per kilometer. Taking a taxi is, however, the best way to get home after a night on the town. Paying by card is not a problem, nor is splitting the bill. You can either order a taxi by phone or find one at a taxi rank, of which there are several in the city. In central Reykjavík there is one rank by Lækjargata and another by Hallgrímskirkja or in front of Harpa Concert Hall on the waterfront.

===By bicycle===

It is easy to get around Reykjavík by bicycle, if you can deal with sometimes strong headwinds and a few hills. There are not many dedicated bicycle paths and so most cycling is done on the street or on the sidewalk (both are legal). When cycling on the street you must obey the same traffic rules as cars. When cycling on the sidewalk it's important to be considerate of people who are walking there, they have the right of way. 

Where there are specially marked paths for cyclists these are frequently shared with pedestrians, with a painted white line indicating the division between the two forms of transport. In these cases the narrower section is the bicycle path. Dedicated bicycle paths are a new phenomenon in Reykjavík but their number is increasing every year. These mostly link the city centre with the suburbs.

Bicycles can be rented at the following locations:

Reykjavík's old town is small and easy to walk around. The houses have some very distinct features, most notably their brightly colored corrugated metal siding. Plan to spend at least a couple hours just wandering around, taking in the city. And for further feasts of the eyes, there are several museums and art galleries in the city, most of them within easy reach of the downtown area.

=== Parks and open areas ===

It used to be inhabited, and in the early 20th century it had a small fishing village. Nobody lives there anymore apart from the birds, but it's a popular way to get away from the city without actually leaving it. During the summer, a café is operated in one of the houses on the island. The building was built for Skúli Magnússon, an 18th century politician often called "the founder of Reykjavík" and designed by the same man as the royal palace in Copenhagen - although it is not quite of the same scale. Among its more modern architecture, Viðey is home to the Imagine Peace Tower by Yoko Ono (see below). To get to Viðey you can take a ferry (hourly) from Sundahöfn, some distance from central Reykjavík (on bus route 5), or from the old harbour in the summer (once daily).

[[Image:Hólavallagarður.jpg|thumb||Hólavallagarður Cemetery]]
*<see name="Hólavallagarður cemetery" address="" directions="on the western edge of Tjörnin pond" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="">The name means "garden on a hill." Overlooking Tjörnin pond, it is one of the largest and oldest cemeteries in Iceland. It offers a rare opportunity to experience an old birch and rowan forest in Iceland. The maze of graves nestles in with moss, lichens, and more than 100 other species of trees and plants. Art historian Björn Th. Björnsson has described it as "the largest and oldest museum in Reykjavik", a place where "a living exhibition and history opens itself to anyone who can read the hand of the sculptor and discern from symbols and types of font the thoughts and deeds of the dead." Many renowned 19th and 20th century Icelanders are buried here. The grave of Jón Sigurðsson, the most important leader of Iceland's independence movement, is found here. Its lack of ostentation speaks volumes about Iceland's egalitarian ideals.</see>

The suburbs of Árbær and Breiðholt encircle the valley.

=== Buildings ===

Reykjavík has a very eclectic building style, which is mainly the result of bad (or no) planning. Many of the oldest houses still standing are wooden buildings covered in brightly coloured corrugated iron. Don't be surprised to see that the next buildings down the street are an ultra-modernistic functionalist cube followed by early 20th century neoclassical concrete. Some of the most interesting buildings you'll see in Reykjavík are those you find wandering about. Some deserve a special mention, however.

* <see name="Alþingi" alt="" address="Kirkjustræti" directions="by Austurvöllur" phone="" url="http://www.althingi.is/vefur/upplens.html" hours="" price="" lat="" long="" email="" fax="">On the southern edge of Austurvöllur is a small building of hewn stone, but don't let its size fool you. This is the building of the Icelandic parliament, known as Alþingi. The institution has in fact long since outgrown the building which was built in 1881 for a nation of a little over 60,000. Today the upper floors of most houses on the north and west sides of the park also house parliamentary offices. The Alþingi building today houses only the debating chamber of the unicameral institution and the party meeting rooms. When Alþingi is in session it is possible to go up to the viewing platforms and follow the debates, otherwise it is necessary to be part of a group to see the building from the inside.</see>

== Do ==

There is a lot to do in Reykjavík, despite being a small city. There is a vibrant music scene with concerts most evenings in the centre of the city. For theatre enthusiasts the city boasts two main theatres staging around 10 plays a year each, both domestic and foreign, as well as a number of smaller theatre groups specialising in different kinds of modern theatre.

There are a number of opportunities to experience at least a bit of Icelandic nature without leaving the city itself, and outdoors activities in the immediate vicinity of the city are easy to find. And no visit to Reykjavík would be complete without going to at least one of the geothermal pools.

For more information about tours and attractions, it may be a good idea to pay a visit to the Tourist Information Centre [http://visitreykjavik.is/] located inside Reykjavík City Hall
=== Music and theatre ===

Reykjavík has a remarkably active cultural scene for a city of its size. There are a number of art galleries, theaters and concert venues. Some of these are listed below, but many of the places mentioned in the “drink” section below also frequently host concerts. There are no dedicated literary locations listed here, but for book readings it may be best to visit book stores and libraries and ask the staff what's coming up.

*<do name="Nordic House" alt="Norræna húsið" address="Sturlugata 5" directions="in Vatnsmýri, south of Tjörnin" phone="+354 551 7030" url="http://www.nordichouse.is" hours="exhibition space open Tue-Sun 12-17, irregular opening hours for other events but the building is generally open during office hours" price="" lat="" long="" email="nh@nordice.is" fax="">A cultural centre located in Vatnsmýri, just south of the city centre.

Delayed by the economic collapse, this building was under construction for several years before finally opening in May 2011. This marked the end of a long wait for the symphony orchestra, who had been using a cinema as their main venue the last 50 years. Today the symphony plays a concert every Thursday evening from September through June (although often at other times as well), but the building is rarely empty at other times with Iceland's lively music scene having embraced this new location.</do>

*<do name="National Theatre of Iceland" alt="Þjóðleikhúsið" address="Hverfisgata 19" directions="" phone="+354 551 1200 for tickets" url="http://leikhusid.is/leikhusid/english" hours="" price="" lat="" long="" email="" fax="">A theatre in the centre of Reykjavík, in many ways the focal point of Icelandic theatre.

=== Festivals ===

At least three times a year, Reykjavík comes out to celebrate. 

*<do name="Culture Night" alt="Menningarnótt" address="" directions="" phone="" url="http://www.menningarnott.is" hours="Third saturday of August" price="" lat="" long="" email="" fax="">This is the biggest date in the cultural calendar of Reykjavík. What started out in 1996 as only an evening celebration today starts already in the morning with the Reykjavík Marathon. The day progresses with ever more cultural activities, most of them free, in central Reykjavík and culminates in several huge concerts and a fireworks show by the harbour. Attendance is usually around 100,000 or half of the population of the city.</do>

*<do name="Gay Pride" alt="Hinsegin dagar" address="" directions="" phone="" url="http://www.gaypride.is/Index/English/" hours="Early August" price="" lat="" long="" email="" fax="">Icelanders are proud of their LGBT community, and every August they show it with one of the biggest annual festivals in Reykjavík. Typically a parade will wind its way through the city with floats of varying degrees of outrageousness. It then ends at Arnarhóll with a large outdoors concert. Gay bars and bars that normally don't self-identify as gay alike tend to be very full this evening. In the preceding days there are various events celebrating LGBT culture.</do>

*<do name="National Day" alt="17. júní" address="" directions="" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="" email="" fax="">It may come as a surprise, but the National Day celebrations on June 17th every year are probably the smallest of the three festivals mentioned here. Nonetheless, it is a public holiday day of festivities in the city where people (especially families with children) celebrate the date Iceland was declared a republic in 1944. The date itself was selected because it is the birthday of the Icelandic independence hero Jón Sigurðsson.</do>

The city also annually hosts a music festival and an international film festival, both take place over several days in the city centre.

*<do name="Iceland Airwaves" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" url="http://www.icelandairwaves.is/" hours="First weekend in November" price="" lat="" long="" email="" fax="">A music festival held in pubs, bars and clubs in downtown Reykjavík, as well as several larger venues. Airwaves prides itself of frequently having artists on the line-up that are just about to make it and become world famous, before you've ever heard of them. They usually have a wide selection of both Icelandic and international acts, but keep the "big names" to a minimum. Book early, in 2011 the tickets sold up 5 weeks in advance.</do>

*<do name="Reykjavík International Film Festival" alt="RIFF" address="" directions="" phone="" url="http://en.riff.is/" hours="Late September" price="" lat="" long="" email="" fax="">Several days of excellent cinema. Screenings of most Icelandic productions of the last year, short and feature length as well as documentaries, and the best of what's happening around the world.

The city also annually hosts an arts festival that takes place over several days in the city centre.

=== Get in touch with nature ===

If you want to experience some of Iceland's nature but don't have time to leave the capital for too long, don't worry, you have several options to get a good feel for nature and the countryside without actually leaving the city.

*<do name="Whale watching" alt="" address="" directions="most ships sail from Ægisgarður in the old harbour" phone="" url="" hours="" price="Around 7000-8000 kr., often half price for children" lat="" long="" email="" fax="">With the exception of [[Húsavík]] in the north, Reykjavík is actually one of the very best places to go whale watching in Iceland. Whales frequently come into Faxaflói, the large bay which Reykjavík sits by and on a typical trip of around 3 hours you can almost be guaranteed to see at least some minke whales and possibly even a humpback. The companies offering whale watching mostly occupy a small area in the old harbour called Ægisgarður, close to the whaling ships. All sail out to the same bay but since conditions there change make sure you are on a good ship.</do>

*<do name="Horse riding" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="" email="" fax="">One of the most popular tourist activities in Iceland due to the special nature of the Icelandic Horse. Although by definition more of a rural activity, there are several companies offering riding tours on the outskirts of Reykjavík, this can be a good option for those not planning on travelling far from the city.</do>

*<do name="Hiking" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="" email="" fax="">The immediate vicinity of Reykjavík offers some good hiking opportunities. By far the most popular among these is Esjan, the mountain that dominates the view to the north from much of the capital and is accessible by bus nr. 57 (routes change, so ask beforehand). It's a relatively easy hike although there is a steep patch early on and at the tops there are some cliffs to climb. You can estimate 4-5 hours to get to the top and back again, although experienced walkers will be quicker. To get there, you need to take bus 57. Sometimes it leaves from the long-distance bus station in Reykjavik (BSÍ), other times from a station called Mjódd (accessible by bus 3, 11, 12, etc from downtown) or you can take it from Mósfellsbær (station is called Háholt - you get to Mósfellsbær on bus 15 from Reykjavik). Ask the driver where to get off for climbing Esja. To get back from Esja to Reykjavik, try asking for a ride at the parking lot, or take the bus back. 57 does not pass very often so make sure you take note of the timetable. 
Another popular place to experience nature is Heiðmörk [http://www.heidmork.is/], a green belt to the southeast of the capital. Heiðmörk mostly flat and there are many paths criss-crossing the area, but getting there may be difficult without a car.</do>

*<do name="Reykjavík Park and Zoo" alt="Fjölskyldu- og húsdýragarðurinn" address="Múlavegur 2, 104 Reykjavík" directions="in Laugardalur" phone="+354 4115900" url="www.mu.is" hours="10:00-17:00" price="Admission: Adults (12 years +): 920 ISK, Children (Under 4 years): Free, Children (4 - 12): 700 ISK" lat="" long="" email="postur@husdyragardur.is" fax="">This small zoo, in the middle of Reykjavík, is a place where city children can come and get in touch with some of the farming heritage of the country, with most species of domestic animals found in Iceland represented. They also have some non-domestic animals including reindeer and seals. During the summer the family section of the park also has some small amusement rides such as a carousel, train, drop tower, to name a few. Tickets for the rides are sold separately with one ticket costing 350 ISK (1-3 tickets per ride) and a daypass for all the rides at 2.370 ISK. The park also has a large playground that is open year round. </do>

*<do name="See the northern lights" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" url="http://www.northernlightsiceland.com/" hours="" price="" lat="" long="" email="" fax="">Reykjavik and surrounding area is great for seeing the northern lights. The lights show up in the winter time and are most likely to be seen in Sept-Oct and Feb-March. After 8pm to maybe 2-3am in the morning is the time period they most likely show up but it all depends on things like clouds, how dark, if there is solar storm hitting earth etc.</do>

===Geothermal Swimming Pools===
[[Image:Laugardalslaug.JPG|thumb|250px|Laugardalslaug geothermal pool]]

Outdoor geothermal swimming pools are an important part of Icelandic culture and a visit to them is a great way to relax with Icelanders. In fact it is not stretching the truth too far to suggest that because drinking is so expensive the hot-pots at these pools serve the same role that pubs and bars do in the rest of Europe.

A beach of golden sand has been created and a “pool” has been enclosed nearby, where the water temperature is about 20ºC. There are several hot-pots. Refreshments and various services are available at the beach.
Swimming in the Atlantic ocean is also possible during winter, and some would say more fun. The ocean is -2 up to 3 ºC, which makes for an interesting experience. The hot tub, steam bath and other facilities are operated during winter.</see>

It is possible to rent swimsuits and towels at all the pools. As Icelandic pools have very minimal amounts of chemicals in them it is very important to shower thoroughly naked beforehand, and pay attention to the notices and posters that highlight hygiene issues.

==Learn==

Being the main population centre of the country, Reykjavík is also the location of most of Iceland's education institutions. Close to the city centre is the '''University of Iceland''' [http://www.hi.is/en], which offers courses in Icelandic as a second language. Most degree programmes are in Icelandic, but there are some specialised postgraduate degrees available relating to sustainable development and to medieval manuscripts taught in English.

'''Reykjavík University''' [http://en.ru.is], originally founded as a business school under the auspices of the Icelandic Chamber of Commerce, has evolved into an institution offering a wide range of degrees in the fields of business, law, computer science and engineering, with a higher number of English-language programmes than the University of Iceland.

At pre-higher education levels, '''Menntaskólinn við Hamrahlíð''' (Hamrahlíð College) offers an IB programme in English [http://www.mh.is/ib]. Several smaller schools offer Icelandic language courses for foreigners, including '''Mímir''' [http://mimir.is/index.php?lang=en] and '''IceSchool''' [http://www.icetrans.is].

==Work==

There's not much in way of employment opportunities for foreigners in Reykjavík at the moment. Since the economic collapse of  2008, unemployment has risen to around 8% and unless you have special skills you're likely to be at a disadvantage as a foreigner in a job hunt. Additionally, it's extremely difficult for non-EEA citizens to get a visa unless they already have a job. If you are an EEA citizen, however, you can head over to Eures [http://www.eures.is/english], a database of jobs advertised in the entire EEA. In Iceland it's run by the Directorate of Labour (Vinnumálastofnun) [http://english.vinnumalastofnun.is] who may also be able to offer you further advice. If you're from one of the other [[Nordic countries]] and are aged between 18 and 28, you may be able to take use of the Nordjobb summer job program [http://www.nordjobb.net], funded by the Nordic Council of Ministers.

==Buy==

'''Laugavegur''' is the main shopping street of Reykjavík and has many funky boutiques, with both Icelandic and international designs. '''Skólavörðustígur''', running from Laugavegur up to Hallgrimskirkja, has a range of souvenir and craft shops where you can find a perfect gift for the family. Record shops and bookstores are also located on these streets, where you can find Icelandic music and literature as well as a wide range of foreign music and books in English.

Reykjavík has one flea market, '''Kolaportið''', located in a warehouse by the harbour and open 11am-5pm Saturdays and Sundays. In addition to stalls selling clothes, antique furniture, old books, and other typical fleamarket wares, there is a food section where you can buy many Icelandic specialities as well as cheap and fresh fish and potatoes.

If you yearn for international chains such as Zara and Debenhams, then head to one of 2 malls in the capital area; '''Kringlan''' in Reykjavík and the newer '''Smáralind''' in neighboring [[Kópavogur]]. But keep in mind that everything in Iceland probably costs more than it does back home. Items can be as much as 3-4 times the price in neighboring countries, mainly because of taxes (24.5% sales tax on products, 7% on books), import duties and so on, though there are exceptions to this rule.

Sales tax is always included in the sticker price. All foreign visitors are entitled to claim back the tax if they spend 4,000 krona or more in one shop in one day. Iceland is not a member of the European Union, so visitors from all European countries are entitled to sales tax refunding. Icelanders living abroad are also entitled to sales tax refunding.

ATMs are found throughout the city, and they should accept any foreign cards. Currency exchange is mainly done at banks, there are very few special currency exchange shops. Icelanders themselves make very little use of cash, paying for even the smallest of things with their cards. Foreign cards will generally be accepted in stores and restaurants, although there may be problems with American Express in some places. A chip-and-PIN system is being introduced, so make sure you remember your PIN.

Please note that tipping isn't required in Iceland; it's not expected for any service, not for restaurants or for hotels, or any other place. Some cafes and restaurants have tipping jars, but paying extra remains entirely optional.

Sticking to your travel budget while in Reykjavík requires planning. [http://trip-to-iceland.com/travel-budget-reykjavik/]

===Budget===

Food in Iceland can be expensive. In order not to break the bank, you'll need to be smart when eating. On the budget side, you're mostly looking at international-type fast food options common to what you'd find in Europe and America.

'''10-11''' is a chain of convenience stores (open 24/7) with plenty of ready-to-eat items such as sandwiches, wraps, and surprisingly enough, tacos. 10-11 is always open but also more expensive than supermarkets, that's why you see most Icelanders shop for food at '''Bónus''' (open 10-18), a low-cost supermarket chain. Even better, you can find a fish shop which will sell you some ridiculously fresh and absolutely delicious fish, at a very reasonable price, and cook it yourself with some potatoes and vegetables. It'll be really nice. The fish shop could be in '''Kolaportið''', a downtown market which only opens on weekends, or alternatively you could look up one of the many fish shops (''fiskbúð'') all around town.

Try one of the Hot-Dog places that are found everywhere. This German import has become thoroughly Iceland-ized. A dog should set you back 380 kr. Ask for "Eina með öllu", a hot dog with everything on it. Deeeeelicious.

'''Fast food''' – Apart from the usual suspects such as KFC and Subway (McDonald's was recently rebranded Metró by the local franchise holder, but the menu remains the same) and the hot dog stands mentioned above, Reykjavík has a number of home grown fast food restaurants. In the city centre many are open 24/7 in weekends, serving the partying crowd. Names include '''Nonnabiti''' and '''Hlöllabátar''' (subs and sandwiches), '''Kebabhúsið''' and '''Ali Baba''' (kebabs), '''Serrano''' (burritos) and <eat name="The Deli" alt="" address="Bankastræti 14" directions="" phone="" url="http://www.deli.is/" hours="10-20/night time on weekends" price="" lat="" long="" email="" fax="">The Deli is a gourmet trattoria, featuring regional Mediterranean cuisine as well as peciality pizzas and daily hot specials.</eat> 
You should be able to fill your stomach at each of these for 1000 kr. or less.

'''Thai restaurants''' – Thais form, along with Poles, the largest immigrant community in Reykjavík and as a result there are a lot of good and cheap Thai restaurants around the capital, often run by Thai families. You will usually get large portions without paying much more than 1000-1500 kr.. Options in central Reykjavík include '''Krua Thai''' (Tryggvagata 14), '''Núðluhúsið''' (Laugavegur 59, 2nd floor), '''Thai Grill''' (Hagamelur 67) and '''Thai matstofan''', (Suðurlandsbraut 52) 

There are tons of cafes everywhere in the city that are relatively inexpensive and a great place to sit, relax, and warm up. You can also check your e-mails if you bring your computer, as there is free Wi-Fi in most of them. '''Kaffitar''' and '''Te & Kaffi''' are comparatively large chains and serve great barrista style coffee, that might however be on the expensive side.

[[Image:Reykjavik - Port Whaling Ships.jpg|thumb|300px|The whaling ships in Reykjavík harbour.]]

There are many fantastic fish restaurants in Reykjavik. The more expensive ones are down by the harbour or in the centre, if you're not so rich try heading towards the old town. Though generally not listed here, most bars serve some food, often better than what you would expect from the look of the place but generally with relatively uninspired menus: Expect to see a few burgers, a pasta dish or two, some salads and maybe a burrito. 

Plan on at least 2,000 ISK for any meal not in a budget/fast-food restaurant. Seriously.

===Splurge===

==Drink==

Drinking is very expensive - expect to pay between 600 and 1200 ISK for a draft pint at a bar. Bottled beers and mixed drinks are more expensive, sometimes outlandishly so. Despite the cost, going out in Reykjavik is a fun experience.  Since alcohol is expensive at Reykjavík bars and clubs, Icelanders usually buy their alcohol at the government owned liquor stores (Vínbúðin, called Ríkið by locals) and stay at home drinking until about midnight (or later), then they will wander to the bars.  Do not expect bars and clubs to become crowded during weekends until about 01:00 (at least). Cover charges are very rare in Reykjavík, unless there is live music or some other sort of event going on. Note that although the legal age for entering clubs is 18, the legal drinking age is 20 and many places set higher entry age limits themselves.

Bars are open to 01:00 (some to 02:00) on weeknights, but most will stay open until 05:00 on Friday and Saturday. The clubs and bars themselves are mostly found in a very small area around Laugarvegur in the city centre, it's easy to just walk around and follow the crowds. You're sure to find somewhere to go, but if you're not sure, groups of drunken Icelanders will usually be eager to help a tourist out! During weekends, live music is easy to find in some of Reykjavík's bars.  During the day, be sure to pick up a the free English-language magazine The Reykjavík Grapevine [http://grapevine.is/] for information on live music events for that evening. It is easy to find in shops, restaurants and bars around the city.

===Bars===
The distinction between bars and clubs is not very clear in Iceland, with most clubs being more like bars until a little before midnight. However, the following venues can be said to be purely bars - places to go and drink with your friends, rather than to dance or listen to music.

* <drink name="Bjarni Fel" alt="" address="Austurstræti 20" directions="" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="" popular="popular" sports="sports" email="" fax="">A sports bar, named for a famous Icelandic footballer and later sports commentator.</drink>

===Clubs===
Reykjavík has a large number of clubs and when one closes, another is usually very quick to take its place. There would be no point in trying to list them all, the following are only a small taste. Most of them are quite small - don't expect the big dance halls of many European capitals - but that's part of the fun, the intimate spirit of the Reykjavík nightlife.

Be warned that there is very little in the way of affordable lodging in Iceland, particularly if you are travelling with a family. The cheapest option in Reykjavík, by far, is to stay at the city's only campsite. If that's not for you, there are several hostels with affordable dorms located in and around the city centre. Fortunately for the traveller on a budget, this seems to be the fastest growing type of accommodation in Reykjavík. Most of these hostels also offer single or double bedrooms, and a few small guesthouses have rooms at similar prices.

==Contact==

Reykjavík has good mobile phone coverage (including 3G) and various providers, the largest being Síminn [http://www.siminn.co.uk] and Vodafone [http://www.vodafone.is/en]. Most foreign SIM cards should work without problems, but it may be best to check with your mobile phone provider at home before leaving. Payphones are almost nonexistant in Reykjavík. 

Wi-fi is free at most cafés in Reykjavík and even at many bars. If there's a password required just ask the staff. Partly because of this, internet cafés have almost ceased to exist, but one such still in operation is GroundZero [http://www.gzero.is], Frakkastígur 8. Be aware that the clientèle is mostly gamers. 1 hour costs 600 kr.

Though Icelandic is the official language, English is spoken quite fluently by almost everyone you will meet and you should have no problems when it comes to communication.

Do not be surprised to have working cell phones, GPS and data in very rural areas of Iceland, even on F roads. Its unusual to have low signal. Depends on your carrier, of course.

==Stay safe==

Iceland holds the European record for number of people with chlamydia (STD), use a condom!

Iceland is considered one of the safest countries in the world. Just be sure to avoid the fights that break out amongst the most intoxicated partiers in bars and most often on the street on weekends. However most people are incredibly friendly and police are also friendly and very helpful.

Recently, however, petty thefts in Reykjavík have occasionally occurred. Rape occurs twice as often as in other Nordic countries, Still, even with these issues, Reykjavík is much safer than most other western cities, and certainly safer than the larger capitals of other countries.

==Cope==
Even though Reykjavík doesn´t have a large population, traffic during rush hour (16:00-18:30) can be a nightmare. This is due to the exploding car population, along with a narrow street system. If you are planning on going somewhere by car or bus, try to do it after around 16:00-18:30 as this is when most of motorists arrive home from work. The same goes for the mornings (07:45-09:00).

Keep in mind that during the summer, the sun does not fully set, resulting in "dusk" between the hours of roughly Midnight and 3:00 AM.  While a novelty at first, the lack of night can quickly disrupt your sleeping habits and result in general fatigue.  If visiting in the summer, be sure to bring a sleeping mask, even if the window shades largely keep the light out.

If you can bear to be asked by almost every Icelander you meet "How do you like Iceland?" you're all set for the trip.

===Press===

Reykjavík has one English language magazine, The Reykjavík Grapevine [http://www.grapevine.is], published bi-weekly in the summer and monthly in the winter. Although it started out as a publication mainly aimed at tourists (with events listings etc.) it has become respected in Iceland for at times very good research journalism and coverage of current events. Available for free at various locations around the city.

Some foreign newspapers are available at newsagents, but for same-day papers you can go to the Eymundsson bookstore at Austurstræti 18 and have them printed.

===Religion===

Lutheran churches are easily found throughout Reykjavík and most of them hold mass at 11am every Sunday. There is a Catholic cathedral in central Reykjavík by Túngata, usually called Landakot church but formally known as the Cathedral of Christ the King. A Catholic mass is held there every day in Icelandic, as well as a mass in English 6pm on Sundays and in Polish 1:15pm the second and fourth Sunday of each month. The Russian Orthodox congregation has a house at Sólvallagata 10, holding mass 6pm on Saturdays and 10:30am Sundays. There is no mosque in Reykjavík, but the Association of Muslims in Iceland holds Friday prayers at Ármúli 3, 3rd floor.
