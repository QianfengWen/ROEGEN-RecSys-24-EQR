==Understand==
[[Image:East_London_Statue.jpg|thumb|150px|A statue in East London]]
East London is situated on the east coast of South Africa, boasting the only deep water river harbour. Buffalo City Local Municipality incorporates East London, Bhisho and King William's Town, as well as the large townships of Mdantsane and Zwelitsha. and smaller surrounding towns too. Though the renaming is official most people still refer it still as East London. The East London Airport code is still ELS which references to the old naming. However the airport too will undergo a name change in the near future.

In 1938 the then curator of the town museum found an unusual fish in the catch of a local fishing vessel. The fish turned out to be a prehistoric Coelacanth[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coelacanth], long thought to be extinct.

East London can easily be reached by car. The N2 highway connects East London to [[Port Elizabeth]] and [[Durban]] ; the N6 goes to [[Bloemfontein]].

==Get around==
Unfortunately East London lacks a public transport system, so getting around is difficult if you don't have a car. There are many Car Rental Companies available, 3 of which have branches at the airport.But the Goverment promised a BRT system transportation at the cost of 2billion.

Taxis are the best way of getting around East London and the suburbs of the city. They can be pre-booked and are quite cost- effective. A journey from the seafront (Sugarshack hostel) to the Hemingways Mall should only cost around 70 Rand each way(2011 prices). 

To get from the Airport to any address in East London, the "Little Red Bus" offers a safe, reliable and good value link. They can be pre-booked by phone or email and will wait at the airport with your name on a sign. There may be other people sharing the bus with you, but the fee is per passenger. The bus will leave when all of the booked passengers have been picked up, so there is no worry about over filling the bus. The return journey to the airport or any other journeys in and around East London can be arranged as well.
