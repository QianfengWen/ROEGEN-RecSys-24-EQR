'''Trieste''' [https://www.discover-trieste.it/Home] (''Trst'' in Slovenian and Croatian, ''Triest'' in German) is the capital of the autonomous region of [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]], in [[Northeast Italy|North-East]] [[Italy]]. Once a very influential and powerful centre of politics, literature, music, art and culture under Austrian-Hungarian dominion, its importance fell into decline towards the end of the 20th century, and today, Trieste is often forgotten as tourists head off to the big Italian cities like [[Rome]] and [[Milan]] or the nearby [[Venice]]. It is, however, a very charming underestimated city, with a quiet and lovely almost Eastern European atmosphere, several pubs and cafes, some stunning architecture and a beautiful sea view. It was also, for a while, the residence of famous Irish writer James Joyce.

==Understand==
[[Image:Trieste from san giusto.jpg|thumb|350px|The sea in Trieste.]]
Trieste has 201,261 inhabitants and it is situated on the crossroads of several commercial and cultural flows: German middle Europe to the north, Slavic nations and the Balkans to the east, Italy and then Latin countries to the west and the Mediterranean Sea to the south.

Its artistic and cultural heritage is linked to its singular "border town" location. You can find some old Roman architecture (a small theater near the sea, a nice arch into old city and an interesting Roman museum), [[Austria|Austrian]] empire architecture across the city centre (similar to stuff you can find in [[Vienna]]) and a nice atmosphere of ''metissage'' of Mediterranean styles, as Trieste was a very important port during the 18th century.

Trieste has always been a very cosmopolitan city. This can be seen in the cultural diversity and even in religion: there is a Greek Orthodox church, a Serbian Orthodox church, a Lutheran church, and a synagogue. 

There is a tourist office at the edge of Piazza Unità d'Italia, in the Lloyd Triestino building. Information is available in Italian, German, and English, as are tourist maps and brochures of information about attractions in and around the city.

===History===

===Read===

'''Trieste and the Meaning of Nowhere''' by Jan Morris is a lovely, melancholy book about Trieste. The author arrived in Trieste with British forces at the end of WWII and subsequently spent several years living in the city. It's more lively now than she describes (it was written in the 1990s), but it's a lyrical introduction to the city's history and its places.

==Talk==

The region of Friuli Venezia Giulia is officially quadrilingual (Italian, Slovene, Friulian or Eastern Ladin and German).  Signs are often only italian in Trieste, as the city itself is generally Italian speaking and the local dialect (a form of the Venetian language) is called Triestine.  Surrounding villages and towns are often inhabited by mostly Slovene speakers.  Residents, and those working in the city, can easily find courses to learn Italian or Slovene or German or English and many other languages.

==Get in==

===By Air===

National flights via [[Milan]], [[Rome]] and [[Genoa]]. International flights via [[Milan]] and [[Rome]] (Alitalia [http://www.alitalia.com/]); direct flights from [[Munich]] (Air Dolomiti - Lufthansa [http://www.airdolomiti.it/]); direct flights from [[London]] and [[Birmingham]] and several other European cities (Ryanair [http://www.ryanair.com/]); direct flights from [[Belgrade]] (Jat [http://www.jat.com/])

The '''Trieste-Friuli Venezia Giulia Airport''' (TRS) [https://triesteairport.it/en//] (formerly '''International Airport of Ronchi dei Legionari''') is 33km north of the city centre.  The 'Polo Intermodale' opened on 19 March 2018 providing direct train services between the Trieste Airport and Trieste Centrale stations with journey times varying between 29 and 33 minutes. All trains also stop at Monfalcone. Services are frequent and include Regionale Veloce and Frecciarossa trains. A bus service (number 51) runs to the airport from Trieste's bus station (next to the railway station).  Weekdays buses leave at 5 minutes and 35 minutes past the hour however on Sundays the service is every 1 to 2 hours.  The bus takes about 55 minutes, a taxi (around 50 euro) takes 30-35 minutes.  Tickets can be bought from a machine in the airport terminal. You can also take a train from Trieste station to Monfalcone (approximately 25 minutes) and take a short bus / taxi ride to the airport.

The airport is just off the A4 [[Trieste]]-[[Venice]] motorway (''[[Fogliano Redipuglia|Redipuglia]] exit''). Long and short-stay car parks are available.

The public transport company APT operates bus and coach services linking the airport with:
*[[Gorizia]]: Coach 1 and other services in connection with Coach 51 
*[[Monfalcone]]: Bus 10 
*[[Udine]]: Coach 51 (also non-stop via the motorway) 
*[[Trieste]]: Coach 51 

Tickets can be purchased at city bus/coach stations or at the airport: in the Arrivals Hall, with an automatic machine for selfticketing and at the Post Office.

Taxis are available outside the Arrivals hall from 08.00 to 24.00.

If you are flying to Italy from the US, a trip to Trieste may be cheaper if you fly into '''Venice Marco Polo''' airport and taking the train [http://www.veniceairport.it/en/transport/bus.html].

Another cost-effective way of reaching Trieste by air is to fly into '''Ljubljana Airport''' [http://www.lju-airport.si/en/Main], the airport servicing the capital of Slovenia. From there, it is about one hour by car to Trieste.

===By Bus===
There is a daily bus from Maribor (12:50) that runs through Ljubljana and on to Trieste. €31 at station, €19-26 online. You can store baggage at the Trieste bus station for €3/bag, which is cheaper than the train station next door (€5/bag).

===By Car===

A4 [[Venice]]-Trieste, toll-gate Monfalcone-Lisert, exit point "Sistiana" (SS 14 "Costiera" ). The town is 24 km from the motorway. 

SS 202 Triestina: Motorway A4, toll-gate Lisert, Carso Plateau, Opicina, Padriciano, Trieste 

SS 15 Via Flavia: [[Koper]] ([[Slovenia]]) - Rabuiese border 

SS 58, Carniola highway: [[Ljubljana]] ([[Slovenia]]) - Fernetti border - Opicina, where the highway joins to SS 202, Trieste

===By Train===

Lots of trains from [[Venice]] and [[Udine]], Eurostar from [[Milan]] and [[Rome]] and Cisalpino from Basel at the Central Railway Station.
There are no rail links with Slovenia: once at Sežana's train station you can catch a bus to Trieste, the last leaving at 14:00, only on working days. If you are coming from Jesenice, you can get off at Nova Gorica, catch the bus no.1 to Gorizia station and then a train to Trieste. 
 
If you arrive by train, the last 15 minutes of travel you have a beautiful sight, because the railway goes along the sea and if the weather is good it should be very striking.

Update April 2016 - there is a rail link between Sežana (Slovenia), which has rail connections with Ljubliana, and Villa Opicina, which is the first stop in Italy, travel time is 10 minutes and costs euro 1.  Trains leave at 6:23, 10:01, 12:31, 16:25, 20:45 and 21:41.[http://mestosezana.eu/voznired_vlak.html *] Taxi is euro 10, so catch that train. There are also about 4-5 buses a day from Ljubliana to Trieste, but none past about 5 PM.  At Sezana there is Tabor hotel right at the train station -- it is OK for just one night stay.  An astonishing number of supermarkets within 400 meters of that hotel.

Update '''March 2018''': Rail services link Ljubljana to Villa Opicina, terminus of the service and first station in Italy. Services run weekdays, Saturdays and Sundays. Adult price is 9.70€ (as of March 2018).

<!--Putting the section about the tram to comment as it is currently closed-- When you arrive to Villa Opicina, reaching Trieste may be done by tramway. Disembark to the left and walk forward for about 300 meters; then there are curvy, short streets; your destination is tramway stop which is about 45 degrees off the railway direction and about 1 km out -- aim roughly for that intersection point. Tramway is euro 1.35. Travel time is about 20 minutes; tramway changes to funicular at a steepest point.-->
A tramway links Villa Opicina to Trieste but it is currently closed (March 2018). Reopening is scheduled for October 2018. You can reach Trieste by bus, services 12 and 44. Bus stops are a short walk from the station, walk out of the station building and go up the street to the right.

When you arrive at Trieste, to go to Trieste Centrale, need to backtrack about 30 meters and go to the left -- the train station is roughly 500 meters away, watch how buses go. At the station Left luggage is euro 5 for 6 hours (it is there hidden close to tracks, at very sharp left, opens at 8 AM); it is a pleasant station to wait for a train; walking along the sea / port line is nice if yo uhave 2 hours to kill; good part of Trieste is quite hilly. When standing in front of the train station, facing the square, to the left is a supermarket -- better than options at the station.

===By Boat===

'''Minoan Lines''' [http://www.minoantrieste.it/English.htm] has ferries sailing to and from Trieste from the ports of [[Ancona]] and [[Ravenna]] in Italy and [[Igoumenitsa]] and [[Patras]] in Greece. The Trieste ticket office for Minoan Lines is in the Greek Consulate at Via G. Rossini 6, on the first floor, next to the Grand Canal in Piazza Sant'Antonio Nuovo. The ferry dock is on Via della Rampa near Molo 7 in the industrial port at the south of the city's waterfront. Ferries take walk on passengers, motor vehicles, bicycles, and campers/caravans. If you are on foot, take the taxi to the docks, as the area going in can be hazardous due to freight trains and heavy commercial traffic.

==Get around==
===By foot===
Like most of Europe, a stroll through the town to admire its ancient architecture is a very popular activity. You get to travel at your own pace and even get some coffee along the way. Trieste is not particularly big, many of its attractions are in the cit centre, and if you do not have luggage with you there is no need to take a bus. 

===By bus===

Trieste has a network of buses running on a strict schedule. This can often be checked on the web [http://www.triestetrasporti.it]. Routes are very frequent through the day but rarer after 9pm in the evening, on Sundays and holidays. Strikes occasionally affect buses but Trieste is a small city and most places of interest can easily be reached on foot.  Tickets can be bought from tobacconists and from machines which are found at some of the busier bus stops. They cost €1.25 each.

'''HopTour''' can also be a nice way to visit the city. Tickets 11€, book online.

===By bicycle===
Bicycle rentals are available in some places around the city. '''Knulp''' [http://knulp.org/], a popular bar/bookshop/arts venue at Via Madonna del Mare 7/a, has bicycle rentals for reasonable rates, as well as wireless internet access.

===By scooter===
The hills in Trieste can be hard to climb, you may want to rent a scooter to discover the city.

The city developed greatly during the 1st and 2nd century AD. The Roman Theatre lies at the foot of the San Giusto hill, and faces the sea. The construction partially exploits the gentle slope of the hill, and most of the construction work is in stone. The topmost portion of the amphitheatre steps and the stage were presumably made of wood. The statues that adorned the theatre (which was brought to light in the '30s) are now preserved at the Town Museum. Three inscriptions from the Trajan period mention a certain Q. Petronius Modestus, a person who was closely connected with the development of the theatre, which was erected during the second half of the 1st century.</see>

==Eat==

The cuisine of Trieste reflects the living traditions of the many populations that have passed through the city over the centuries.  In the city's restaurants, called "buffets", you can find delicious examples of the local Austrian and Slavic tradition.

*'''Caldaia''' Traditional dish of boiled pork.  
*'''Jota''' a soup prepared with pork, potatoes, sauerkraut, and finely-ground beans
*'''Gnocchi''' in the style of Austrian dumplings, made with everything from ham to stuffed with plums.
*'''Brodetto''' Fish soup 
*'''Risotto''' Creamy rice dish
*'''Sardoni in savor''' flavored pilchards 
*'''Salads''' common favorites here include chicory and rocket
*'''Bruscandoli''' - also very common in the region of [[Veneto]], Bruscandoli are the sprouts of wild hops and look very much like wild asparagus. They are used in several traditional recipes.

*Farmers of the plateau who had been allowed by an imperial decree to sell their own products during a period of 8 days, organized the so-called '''osmizze''', where it is possible to taste local wines and products, such as Monrupino's tabor cheese and honey from San Dorligo.
*The '''pastry shops''' in Trieste offer delicious local varieties of the most famous Austrian cakes: Sacher torte, krapfen, strucolo cotto and strucolo de pomi (local varieties of strudel), chiffeletti (cookies made with flour, eggs and potatoes and fried in oil)
*During '''Easter''' you can taste the pinza, a sweet leavened bread that many women still prepare at home and take to the bakery to be cooked. Richer variants of this are the titola, decorated with a hard-boiled egg, putizza and presnitz. Fritole, pancakes stuffed and fried in oil and fave, small round cookies made with almonds and aromas are typical during Carnival.

Buffets are restaurants that serve pork everything. Lunch is usually sandwiches, with pork of varying types, mustard, and some grated horseradish (kren). Sometimes there are sides like breaded and fried zucchini or eggplant. Dinners are huge platters of pork with kraut, mustard, and bread.

Trieste has a strong passion for coffee: its inhabitants' consumption per person is twice the national average. Unlike in the rest of Italy, nobody will order just "a coffee", but:
"un nero” (an espresso),
"un capo" (an espresso with hot milk in a cup), 
"un capo in b" (an espresso with hot milk in a glass)
"caffè latte" (in Trieste it is used as a synonim for "capuccino"), "gocciato" or "goccia" (literally "drop", an espresso with a just a tiny quantity of milk). It is not customary in Trieste to drink coffee with liquor.

==Stay Safe==
Trieste has a reputation of being one of Italy's safest cities possibly due to it being a border city (and therefore formerly full of border police and other security services).  There are very few problems with regards to walking the streets at night, taking taxis or pick pocketing.  Obviously normal precautions should be taken and like elsewhere in Italy be careful of drivers who tend to think that they own the road.

===Bora===
The Bora is one of Trieste's symbols. It is a strong and chill wind that blows intermittently from north - northeast from the mountains and it can occasionally be very very powerful (easily around 100 kms/h, but it can get up to 180 kms/h).

==Stay Healthy==

There are two major hospitals in Trieste:

'''Cattinara Hospital''' [http://www.aots.sanita.fvg.it/aots/portale/dettaglioCattinara.asp?ID=1&view=presenta&lang=2], 
Strada di Fiume 447, has cultural mediators available if you are hospitalized or in Emergency. Cultural mediators will speak your language and make communicating with doctors and staff much easier. The regular hours for cultural mediators at Cattinara are Mondays and Thursdays, 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. It is accessible by bus routes n° 22 (Stazione Centrale - Cattinara); no. 25 ( Piazza Borsa - Cattinara); no. 26/  (Largo Osoppo - Cattinara on Sundays only); no.39/ (Aurisina - Cattinara); no. A  (only after 9 p.m.); no. 48 (Largo Barriera); no. 49/ (Muggia - Cattinara)

'''Maggiore Hospital''' [http://www.aots.sanita.fvg.it/aots/portale/dettaglioMaggiore.asp?ID=2&view=presenta&lang=2], Piazza dell'Ospedale 2, is located in the city center. It is accessible by bus routes no. 5 (Piazza Perugino - Roiano); no.11 (Ferdinandeo - Piazza della Borsa); no. 22 (Cattinara - Stazione Centrale); no. 23 (Grandi Motori-Stazione centrale); no. 26 (Chiadino -Largo Osoppo); no.37 (Raute - Largo Barriera); no. 40 (San Dorligo - Stazione Centrale).

If you require a cultural mediator when you are not hospitalized or in Emergency, at both Cattinara and Maggiore you can go to the Ufficio Relazioni con il Pubblico, the Public Relations offices, where they are available upon request.

Only a few Farmacias are open on Sundays, usually for short hours in the morning, but '''Farmacia al Castoro''' at Via Di Cavana 11, Tel: 040 302303, is open continuous hours from 8:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.

If you're traveling with a pet and you need an English-speaking veterinarian, '''Cecilia Luciani''' [http://www.studioveterinariocecilialuciani.it/] at Via Madonna del Mare 8, Tel: 040 314601 has office hours Monday 9 - 10 a.m. / 4:30 - 7 p.m., Tuesday 10:30 a.m. - 12 / 2:30 - 6 p.m., Wednesday 10:30 a.m. - 12 / 4:30 - 7 p.m. Thursday 10:30 a.m. - 12 / 2:30 - 6 p.m., Friday 9 - 10 a.m. / 4:30 - 7 p.m.,  Saturday 9 - 11 a.m. She can be contacted for emergencies at Cell: 39 347 1417002 Other veterinarians in her office also speak Italian, Slovenian, Croatian, and Greek.

==Work==

Speakers of Italian or Slovene or German should find work easily in Trieste.  The city has a large number of science parks which employ scientists from all over the world and communication at these centres is usually in English.  There are also a small number of English language schools which employ native speakers.

==Get out== 
Across the countryside, you can find a local tradition that must be mentioned, "osmica". Osmicas are wineries predominantly located on the Karst Plateau,  small beautiful farms where you will find different kinds of homemade salami, cheese and ham, and characteristic red wine. Opened for only certain months of the year, they owe their Slovenian name to the word "osem" (meaning "eight" in Slovenian", as under the Austro-Hungarian Empire the farmers were allowed to open them for eight days per year). And maybe along the Riviera (Muggia, Sistiana, Duino), you can find some nice places to sleep, too.

The pretty island of [[Grado]] just to the west makes a good half-day boat trip (ticket return 6 €) [http://www.aptgorizia.it].

[[Venice]] and [[Ljubljana]] are also major nearby destinations.

'''Grotta Gigante''' [https://www.grottagigante.it] - The Giant cave claims to be the biggest tourist cave in the world (since 1997 in the Guinness book of records). 15 km by city bus #42 or the '''tram of Opicina''' then 1 hour walking along the path #26. The enormous hall is 107 meters high, 280 meters long, and 65 meters large. The multi-lingual guided tour takes about 45 minutes. You can also visit the '''Museum of Speleology''' near the cave beside the various speleological, geological, and paleontological finds it also includes some valuable archeological pieces and a poster collection of the cave. Two wide parking lots are available on the outside.  Another cave and World Heritage Site, [[Skocjan Caves]] in Slovenia is located just a few minutes from Bassovica, one of the suburbs above Trieste. 

'''Postojna Cave''' [https://www.postojnska-jama.eu/en/postojna-cave/] (in Italian ''Grotte di Postumia'') is another very famous cave in [[Postojna]], Slovenia, around 50kms from Trieste.

'''Redipuglia War Memorial''' (''Sacrario militare di Redipuglia'' in Italian) [https://www.turismofvg.it/en/109240/memorial-of-redipuglia] - near the village of Fogliano Redipuglia and the airport. This World War I memorial is the largest in Italy and one of the largest in the world. The remains of 100,187 Italian soldiers killed between 1915 and 1917 are housed here.

The Slovenian coastal cities of [[Koper]] and [[Piran]] are about 30 minutes away (1 hour by bus) and make a great day trip. Buses depart from the bus station (EURO 5.30 one way). The twin cities of [[Gorizia]] (in Italy) and [[Nova Gorica]] (in Slovenia) are around 45 minutes by train from Trieste.  From Nova Gorica it's easy to take a connecting train to Lake [[Bled]] or other parts of the Slovenian Alps.

During the summer months there are daily ferries to Piran (Slovenia) and [[Porec]], [[Rovinj]], and [[Pula]] in Croatia costing around 40 euros for a return ticket.  The Croatian cities in Istria are all accessible from Trieste by car in a little over an hour.  Trips to Austria (2 hours by car, 3 hours by train) are possible from Trieste via either [[Udine]] or [[Nova Gorica]]

Local routes include [[Udine]], [[Grado]], [[San Candido|San Candido/Innichen]][http://www.aptgorizia.it]

At the Trieste Coach Station, bus and coach connections to several European countries, including [[Slovenia]] ([[Izola]] - Isola, [[Koper]] - Capodistria, [[Ljubljana]], [[Piran]] - Pirano, [[Portorož]] - Portorose, [[Postojna]] - Postumia, [[Sežana]] - Sesana), [[Croatia]] ([[Dubrovnik]], [[Poreč]] - Parenzo, [[Pula]] - Pola, [[Opatija]] - Abbazia, [[Rijeka]] - Fiume, [[Rovinj]] - Rovigno, [[Split]] - Spalato, [[Zadar]] - Zara) and [[Serbia]] ([[Belgrade]] - Belgrado) are available. Trieste's coach station is also linked with [[Budapest]] three times per week, every Tuesday, Friday, and Sunday, the bus leaving Trieste at 2:30. A single ticket costs 50 €. Trieste is also linked once per day with [[Bucarest]] and with [[Sofia]]. See the station's [https://www.autostazionetrieste.it/en-us/home?lan=en website] for more information including buses to/from Slovenia and Croatia.
