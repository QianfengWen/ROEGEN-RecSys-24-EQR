{{pagebanner|Dunedin Banner.jpg}}
[http://www.dunedinnz.com '''Dunedin'''] is the second-largest city and one of the main ports on the [[South Island (New Zealand)|South Island]] of [[New Zealand]], located in the Otago region.  It is known as the [[Edinburgh]] of the South and is proud of its [[Scotland|Scots]] heritage. This university town is named from the old Gaelic for ''Edinburgh'' and is noted for its unique Victorian railway, said to be the second most photographed building in the southern hemisphere.

==Understand==
Dunedin has as its heart a statue of the poet Robbie Burns, and many of its streets carry the same name as streets in Edinburgh. It was built in a time before the car was king, when trams and railways moved people around efficiently. It is built in a natural harbor on a relatively small area of flat land surrounded by steep hillsides. Some of its streets are steep: Baldwin Street(slope angle of 19°) is claimed as the steepest street in the world by the Guinness Book of World Records. It has a relatively mild summer, while in winter the hill suburbs will get cold enough for snow several days a year and the entire city will close down once or twice a year due to snow settling. The real issue during winter is black ice on the steep streets surrounding the city.

Dunedin's University of Otago, established in 1869, is the oldest university in New Zealand. It is the South Island's second largest employer, and by far the biggest contributor to the Dunedin economy. Dunedin is a University Town rather than just a town with a university. The students make up over a tenth of the population. A consequence of this is that the city is significantly quieter during the university summer holiday period (approx. November to February), and that accommodation may be harder to find or more expensive during university graduations, etc.

Dunedinites (the Dunedin people) are generally friendly, seemingly more friendly than in the bigger cities of NZ (and the bigger cities anywhere else in the world).

==Get in==

===By plane===
*[http://www.dnairport.co.nz/ '''Dunedin Airport'''], {{IATA|DUD}}.
*[http://www.airnewzealand.co.nz/ '''Air New Zealand'''], 0800 737 000.  Flies from [[Auckland]], [[Wellington]] and [[Christchurch]].
* '''Jetstar''', [http://www.jetstar.com/nz/en/home/].  Flies from Auckland.

The airport is 30km (19&nbsp;mi) out of town on the nearest piece of flat land that was big enough for the runway. Taxis and shuttle buses operate from just outside the terminal and are usually there when flights arrive. All the major rental car operators serve the airport.

===By train===
The railway station is close to the centre of town. Unfortunately there is no longer a regular long distance passenger train service, but some people arrive in the city by the local scenic trains. These are operated by the Taieri Gorge Railway, which runs out as far as Middlemarch. A connecting bus service to [[Queenstown]] can be arranged.

===By bus===
There are several daily services from Christchurch, Invercargill, Wanaka and Queenstown. The major operators are InterCity [http://www.intercity.co.nz/], Atomic Shuttles, Wanaka-Connection and Knightrider. (which offers an overnight service from Christchurch to Invercargill via Dunedin). The trip from (or to) Christchurch takes about 6.5 hours.

===By car===
State Highway 1 passes through Dunedin. Allow 4 hours 30 minutes travel from Christchurch and 2h30 from [[Invercargill]]. Be sure to get a good detailed map as soon as you can. Most hostels have very detailed maps for the CBD with reasonable detail for the outlying areas. Dunedin's urban roads can be very confusing with lots of one way streets, circles, and tight and winding hill routes.

===By boat===
Port Chalmers, a small port town, is a deep water cargo and cruise port for Dunedin.  Port Chalmers is 8 miles northeast of Dunedin and shares the same long, narrow harbor, Otago Harbor. Only smaller ships can proceed past Port Chalmers to the wharves in the Dunedin city centre. The main streets of Port Chalmers and Dunedin are both called George St. The Port Chalmers one is numbered in the 5000s to avoid confusion, and all shops, cafes and services can be found along or near this street. 

Cruise ship transfers to and from Dunedin.

*Cruise ship shuttle bus: These travel direct (20 minutes) and drop off and pick up in the Octagon in the centre of Dunedin for a fee ~$15. They may depart from the ship gangway or up to five minutes walk away, depending on the day's arrangements.
*For about five minutes further walk from ship side to the public bus stop in George St, these hourly buses take 30 minutes to get to the Dunedin city terminus is at Countdown supermarket on Cumberland St.
*Taxis depart ship-side and for the return to Port they are easily found on the side streets of most corners of George St, Dunedin's main shopping street.

==Get around==
===By train===
[[File:Flemish Renaissance-style. Dunedin fourth Railway Station.jpg|thumb|300px|Flemish Renaissance-style. Dunedin fourth Railway Station]]
There are no suburban trains. 
The Taeri Gorge Railway [https://newzealandrail.com/train-services/taieri-gorge] tel +64 3 477-4449 is a scenic tourist trip, ending at a small village called Middlemarch. Take your camera and lots of memory. The same company runs trips on the old Christchurch line as far as Palmerston, about 2 hours away. These go about twice a week in the summer.

===By bus===
The Dunedin Bus Service is fairly average but cheap and does get you around.  The main line service,  St Clair-Normanby, runs every 15 minutes and is handy to about a dozen of the City's attractions. Most other routes are every 30-40 minutes. Some of the buses are not too attractive looking, but they are being added to by cast-off wheelchair friendly buses from other cities. The blue/gold colored buses operated by Citibus and the beige/dark red buses operated by Passenger Transport share all the town routes. Most drivers from either company will tell you where to find the right bus if you ask nicely, or you can ask the Otago Regional Council [https://www.orc.govt.nz/public-transport/dunedin-buses] or call 0800 474 082 free from a cell phone, but only during office hours.
The Peninsula bus route from the Museum is a good way to see the Peninsula, unless you're terrified by oncoming traffic: in places the full sized buses are ''wider'' than the lanes they travel in. The traffic is generally used to this and travels very cautiously. All Buses on the Peninsula service are Wheelchair Friendly.

===By bicycle===
There is a recycling centre down by the north-east end of the docks (in Wickliffe Street) which generally has one or two reasonable-condition bicycles lying about for $10 apiece. Carefully add air (there's a service station due west back over the bridge) and oil and you're set to go. You will also need a skid-lid/stack-hat/helmet, which are generally unavailable second-hand for liability reasons, but can be had new for $20 from the KMart in Meridian, between George Street and Filleul Street. There is another recycling shop called "The Recover Store" at the Dunedin Landfill on Brighton Road, Green Island.

Dunedin's hills are extremely steep but the town centre is reasonably flat There is an excellent flat ride out along the western shore of the Otago Peninsula to Harington Point, although it's a narrow road shared by lots of tour buses. A cycle track runs along of the industrial eastern shore of the harbour, about half way to Port Chalmers (busy highway the rest of the way).

If you like a bit of a hill-climb, ride out along North Road to the Organ Pipes, a collection of rapidly-cooled rocks which have self-formed into organ-pipe-like structures. The walk along a bush track up to the Pipes themselves is very scenic and well attended by small, harmless wildlife. The ride up along the ridge of the Peninsula to Lanarch Castle is also good high-energy exercise.

If you like pushing a bike up a hill because it's too steep, dive off North Road onto Norwood Street, or cross to the east side of the Peninsula, or head straight up the hill behind The Octagon past the Beverly-Begg Observatory to suburbs with a view like Roslyn.

==Eat==
For the desperate, '''McDonalds''' is at 232 George Street, where an internet cafe is attached. For the even more desperate, you can try the Dunedin favorite, a ''cheese roll'' - a mixture of grated cheese, onion and soup on bread toasted.

George Street has many restaurants, starting about two blocks north of The Octagon (in the centre of Dunedin). There are also a few interesting places on Albany Street, which runs across the south of the University Of Otago.

The Friday bakery in Roslyn village is recommended. 

If you're looking for brunch type foods on Saturday the farmers market at the Railway Station has delicious delicacies such as crepes (including gluten free), the popular "bacon buttie", Whitebait fritters, and baking as well as fresh fruit and vegetables.

===Budget===
Being NZ, if you want Fish and Chips, you go to a true fish and chip shop for them, and being a student town, you can find some very cheap take-away food near the university campus.

The '''Good Oil''' down George Street (the main street) has premium ALLPRESS espresso coffee, fantastic edibles from the cabinet made fresh daily, and a full al a carte brunch menu available, also on Fridays from 6PM they host some of Dunedin's top acoustic musical talent with Central Otago wines and locally brewed ales available.
 
Kiwis make good ice cream, and many places (including little delis and general stores at places like MacAndrew Bay) sell cones for fairly reasonable prices at the '''Rob Roy''' on the corner of George and Albany str.

For the freshest local organic produce, including fruit, vegetables, eggs, bread, cheese, check out the '''Farmer's Market'''.  It's on Saturday mornings, 8AM til around 12:30PM, next to the railway station.

==Stay safe==
The city is quite safe. There tends to be a 'party atmosphere' on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights and a lot of people enjoying the night life get drunk or boisterous in the centre city and Dunedin North area - generally students having fun and unwinding after a week of lectures and studies. The police station is in Great King Street, next to Countdown, the supermarket. If you do not act aggressively to someone who is a 'wee bit sloshed' you should do OK. Tourists are viewed with curiosity and people are helpful and kind.
