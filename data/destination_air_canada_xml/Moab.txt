==Understand==

Moab is a unique Western community situated in the red rock country of Southeastern Utah on the Colorado River. [[Arches National Park]] is only six miles from downtown and [[Canyonlands National Park]] is 32 miles from Moab. The city is surrounded by public lands which are used not only for grazing, drilling, and forestry but for recreation such as mountain biking, hiking, rafting, rock climbing, highlining, B.A.S.E. jumping, skydiving, disc golf and cross-country skiing. Because the area is rich in these recreational opportunities, Moab has become the hub of tourist activity and services.

==Get in==
===By car===
If you are approaching Moab while driving west along I-70, use Utah Route 128 for the beautiful scenery.  About 10 minutes past the Colorado-Utah border is exit 214 on I-70, it is marked as "Cisco".  The landscape at this point is extremely dry, slightly hilly.  The road is narrow (no shoulder), and somewhat curvy, and it's about 80 km to Moab.  About half-way, the road narrows, meets and then crosses the Colorado River, and the remainder of the trip is spent with the river on your right side and spectacular canyon walls surrounding you.  This piece of pavement is one of the best drives in North America.  Optimal times to take it are the morning (~9AM) or afternoon (after 3PM) for the light -- do not drive it at night (you can't see anything and it is more dangerous -- use US 191 instead).  Watch for traffic, particularly bicycles as you approach Moab.  The urge to rubber-neck is extreme, and needs to be resisted:  be a passenger if you can.  Eventually, UT 128 ends at US 191, a few minutes north of Moab.
===By plane===
Moab's '''Canyonland Field Airport''' [http://www.moab-utah.com/moabairport/] has commuter service to Denver. Bookings from beyond Denver can be ticketed with United and Frontier Airlines to reach Moab. Moab's airport code is CNY. Ground transportation between Moab and the airport should be reserved in advance.
===By train===
The AMTRAK train has a whistle stop in Green River, Utah (GRI). Combine the train with your flights into Salt Lake City (UT), Denver or Grand Junction (CO) then reserve a taxi or shuttle service to travel 52 miles to the town of Moab.
===By bus===
[https://webstore.saltlakeexpress.com/ Salt Lake Express] offers two round-trips a day on its Blanding-Salt Lake City route (which serves both the airport and Downtown Salt Lake City), which passes through Moab.

==Get around==
Moab's Main Street is part of US Route 191. Traveling north on Main will get you to [[Arches National Park]], Canyonland Field Airport, and Interstate 70. To get to [[Dead Horse Point State Park]] and [[Canyonlands National Park]], by backcountry dirt road use Utah State Route 279, which intersects US-191 near the entrance to Arches National Park. To access Canyonlands and Dead Horse Point by pavement continue farther north on Hwy 191 to Utah State Route 313.

*'''Lazy Lizard Hostel''', 1213 S Hwy 191, ''+1 435'' 259-6057, Email: reservations@lazylizardhostel.com, [http://www.lazylizardhostel.com/]. Probably the cheapest accommodation in Moab and its only youth hostel, a word of caution is warranted. While you will find necessary accommodations (a bed, sheets, walls and a roof), some of these accommodations can be a surprising state. Some walls may not seal properly and you may find weeds growing between the shower tiles in the bathroom. Seasoned ''hostelers'' accustomed to [[Hostelling International|HI]] standards may find a stay at the lazy lizard hostel to be closer to camping. Still, at 26$ for a 2 person private room, much can't be hoped for.

==Stay safe==
In summer time, Moab can get very hot.  Drink extra fluids as needed.  If you plan to go off-roading or camping out on the trails, take at least one gallon of water per person per day.
