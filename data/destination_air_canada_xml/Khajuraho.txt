'''Khajuraho'''[https://www.mptourism.com/destination-khajuraho.php] is a small town located in the Bundelkhand region (Chhatarpur District) of [[Madhya Pradesh]] and is famous for groups of Hindu and Jain temples. These temples are a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] for their beautiful and erotic rock carvings.

Khajuraho has the Vindhya range of mountains as its beautiful backdrop. This makes Khajuraho a more fascinating destination to visit.

===Understand===
[[Image:Temple Khajuraho.JPG|thumb|350px|right|Khajuraho]]
Khajuraho's art is a manifestation of the essence of the philosophy of Indian aesthetics. The erotic sculptures of Khajuraho depicting Kama Sutra are unique in the world. 
These sculptures representing the Indo-Aryan architecture, congeal in stone a lyrical paean to love and passion and reflect the Chandela dynasty's passion and immense appreciation for the forbidden art, paradoxically, in the land of Kama Sutra. They cannot be passed off as just erotic sculptures; the temples have some of the most revered Gods of Hinduism. 

====History====
The temples of Khajuraho were built between 950 to 1050 A.D. during the Chandela dynasty of Central India (These rulers claimed descent from the moon, hence the name Chand-ela). After the decline of the Chandela dynasty in 13th century, the temples were left under the cover of dense date palm trees for many years, which gave the city of Khajuraho its name, Khajur in Hindi means a date. In the ancient times it was known as ''Vatsa''. 

In 1838, a British army engineer, Captain T.S. Burt rediscovered them. By that time only 22 of the original 85 temples had survived.

====Climate====
Khajuraho's climate is quite extreme, with wide variation in day and night temperatures along with minimal rainfall. Summers are hot at 45°C and winters pleasant at 27°C. Rainfall of
114 cms annually. As summer is too hot, winter is a good time to visit. A good time to visit is March, when the annual Dance Festival takes place. So the best time to visit Khajuraho is from '''September to March'''.

==Talk==
Hindi is spoken widely, English should not be a problem for the tourists. Dutch, French are also spoken by the guides and at the restaurants/hotels.

==Get in==
===By plane===
Khajuraho Airport ({{IATA|HJR}}) Tel:''+91 7686'' 740-415 is located 5 km from the city, and is served by Air India (fomerly Indian Airlines) [http://www.airindia.com/] offering flights from [[Delhi]], [[Agra]], [[Varanasi]] and [[Mumbai]]. If one is not prepared for a 5-6 hours bumpy ride from Jhansi to Khajuraho, then the plane is the best mode. Road connectivity can also be preferred if there is no time constraint.

===By train===



A train station was finally opened in Khajuraho in 2008, linking it to [[Jhansi]] (Uttar Pradesh) (175km) on the [[Delhi]]-[[Chennai]]/[[Bangalore]]/ [[Trivandrum]] mainline.  NOTE: You can not buy train tickets at the Khajuraho train station!.

There are direct trains from New Delhi Station (Hazarat Nizamuddin Railway Station),Agra and Varanasi. Train departs from Delhi daily at 20:10 and reaches 06:35 next morning at Khajuraho Railway Station. 

UP SAMPARK KRANTI Express (Train number 12448) runs daily from Delhi Hazrat Nizamuddin to Khajuraho. Dep time is 20.10 from Delhi Hazrat Nizamuddin station , ARR. time 06.35 in Khajuraho.  If you have to go back towards New Delhi from Khajuraho then try to book this train's tickets as its very convenient to go from Khajuraho by train than by bus. It departs from Khajuraho (train no 22447) at 18.20  and reaches Delhi at 05.25 in the morning. 

Khajuraho is now well connected with major parts of Rajasthan by Rail since the extension of Udaipur-Gwalior Express till Khajuraho (Train No. 19665-19666), which now connects the  two travel destinations via Jhansi and Agra. This train runs daily.

The other options to reach Khajuraho is through Jhansi. It takes around 6 hours to reach [[Jhansi]] from [[Delhi]] by train, and another 3-4 hours (plus connecting time) to go to Khajuraho.  Get the Dakshin Express from Delhi (23:00 hrs) and reach Jhansi by 05:00 hrs, connecting to the Jhansi-Khajuraho Link Passenger(Train No:51821) which now runs along with Jhansi-Prayagraj Passenger(Train No:51821) starts from Jhansi at 7:10AM and reaches Khajuraho at 12:05PM. Another option is the Bhopal Shatabdi train from delhi (6.00hrs) to Jhansi. Train from Khajuraho to Jhansi departs from Khajuraho at 12:25PM and will reach Jansi by 5.30PM. Both the trains have stoppage at Orchha.  The other train from Orchha is the Udz Kurj Express (19666) departing Jhansi at 15:30 and arriving into Khajuraho at 19:50

An alternative station is [[Satna]] (Madhya Pradesh) (117km) on the [[Prayagraj]]-[[Mumbai]] main line.
Another  option is Mahoba station  on the Varanasi- Jhansi Route. Alight at Mahoba and catch the 11:00AM Passenger(Train No:229A) to Khajuraho.

The city centre or Western Temples group is about 9 kms away from the railway station , infact the airport is closer. There is no bus service from the railway station to the town at present and you will have to travel in an Auto rickshaw, you can join a group of passengers for Rs 10  or hire one for yourself which will cost between 100 - 150 Rupees one way. Or you can walk. Turn left out the train station and left onto the main road. It will take around 2 hrs and you can pick one of those 10-20 Rupee shared auto's if you want.

===By taxi/bus===
[[Satna]] and [[Jhansi]] both are connected to Khajuraho by regular bus service. Roads from Jhansi as well as Satna are now in good condition,few patches in between are bad (feb,2016). But the buses takes more time to cover the distance because of there frequent stops to pickup people. Buses from Satna and Jhansi are luxury type and are in good condition. One thing to note that the buses are crowded during journey and do not board bus if you don't get a seat, wait for the next bus.Before journey the seats are given by the bus attendant. There is no direct bus from Jhansi to Khajuraho. One has to get down at Chhatarpur and change the bus either for Jhansi or khajuraho. By bus Khajuraho to Chhatarpur takes around 1hr and 30 min(fare 50rs as on 27/2/2016) and from Chhatarpur to Jhansi takes around 4 hr 15min(fare 140rs as on 27/2/2016). It takes around 3 hours and 30 min to reach [[Khajuraho]] from Satna by bus(fare 120rs as of 27/2/2016) and nearly one hour lesser by private car. There are daily bus services with [[Satna]], [[Jhansi]], [[Harpalpur]], [[Chhatarpur]], [[Mahoba]], [[Sagar]],[[Jabalpur]], [[Bhopal]], [[Indore]], [[Gwalior]], [[Panna]], [[Agra]], [[Prayagraj]] and [[Varanasi]].

From Jhansi railway station catch a rickshaw to Jhansi bus station which is 5Kms away. 
It is very difficult to get a bus to Khajuraho from Jhansi after 5PM. So try to reach Jhansi by afternoon if you want to catch a bus to Khajuraho from Jhansi.
Khajuraho to Bandhavgarh (225km, 5hrs), Satna (117km, 3:30hrs), Harpalpur (94km), Jhansi (172km, 5hrs)and Mahoba (61km). Khajuraho is located 600km (11hrs journey) south-east of Delhi. There are bus services from Agra (12 hrs), Gwalior (9hrs) and Jhansi.

==Get around==
A good way to get around and see the temples as well the village life in Kharujaho is by bicycle, which you can easily rent in the bike shops near the main temple complex, or bicycle rickshaw. They charge Rs.20 per day.

Beware of the fake school teachers, principals and students who are too much interested in your dollars as donation, which hardly goes to the school itself.

There are many car rental companies available.
The Auto rickshaws provide a comfortable enough ride around the small town. Also they offer a lot cheaper deal with a friendly guide in the rickshaw drivers (auto charges for sight seeing of Khajuraho approx 250-300rs).

==See==

==Stay safe==
* ''''''Beware: SCAM!''' Safari Restaurant & Sharukh Internet Cafe'''. Beware of this restaurant and attached internet cafe. Travelers who have tried to book train tickets through here have been given fake tickets or threatened into paying huge amounts of commission on top of the normal ticket prices. The brothers running this business can quickly turn rude and aggressive, especially towards women. 
* A number of local people will try to befriend you, then ask for a bill from your country, saying that they want to add it to their collection. They will then show you some (worthless) Romanian notes that they have already. They are not interested in your coins. It is highly likely that they take these notes to the moneychangers and exchange them for rupees later, as they only seem interested in sterling, dollars and euros, which are valuable to them.
