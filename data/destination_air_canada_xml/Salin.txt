Wetthe Lake is 1,000 acres (400 ha) wide. Wetthe lake is located in the western part of the Salin. This lake was built by King NarapatiSithu with intention of improving agriculture since this area was affected by drought. Now this lake is 824 years old. In the middle of this lake there is a pagoda, named Shwe Mohke Htaw, was built by King Thiridahmar Thawka. This Lake is full with Lotus. You can hire boats from local and row in the lake. I recommend to do this as you can feel the nature and also watch the sunset with your love one is kind of romantics. Not only for lover but also for family can do this activity together. The most interesting fact in here is, local people rarely use plastics instead they use the leaf of Lotus, as the lake is full of these plants. They also make clothes from Lotus Fabric.
