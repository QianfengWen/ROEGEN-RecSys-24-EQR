'''Roatán''' is one of the [[Honduras]] [[Bay Islands]] in the Caribbean Sea.  

==Understand==

The island of Roatan is located 60 km (30 miles) off the north coast of Honduras atop the worlds second largest coral reef. The reef attracts many fish, and is world known for scuba diving. 
Roatan is the largest of the Bay Islands at about 77 kilometres (48 mi) long, and less than 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) at its widest. The island has a number of beaches, all of which are public. Originally an English colony, and later ceded to Honduras, Roatan has a mixture of english and spanish speaking natives. 
With two cruise ship ports, Roatan has become a cruise destination, and roads and beaches can be busy when ships are in port. Prices for services may be higher when a ship is in. 
In recent years the island has experienced a lot of development and has a number of resorts along with more rustic accommodation as well. The western side of the island is the most populated and where most tourists stay, and the eastern side is more remote and isolated.
Roatan has a warm climate with daytime temperatures between 25 - 30 deg C (80 - 90 deg F) year round.

==Villages==
<!-- Listed in geographical order from West to East -->


[[Image:French_Harbor.jpg|thumb|French Harbor, Roatan]]

* '''West Bay''' - is the furthest-west area of the island, has some good restaurants and places to stay, and several large resorts have been built on the beach.  It's arguably the best stretch of beach in the western portion of the island - powder-white sand that is very well maintained.  The reef is a short swim away for excellent snorkeling, especially near the west-most tip, also known as Tabyana Beach.  West Bay is also home to some of the best sunsets.  It is recommended to spend beach time in the West Bay and bar time in the West End.    

* '''West End''' - has some good restaurants and places to stay, and it is definitely the most fun town on the island.  There are bars, restaurants, live music, right on the Caribbean.  The are also a multitude of dive shops, if you are interested in learning to dive, or would like to do some fun dives as a certified diver.

* '''[[Sandy Bay]]'''- a mostly residential area, Sandy Bay also has a few resorts, such as Anthony's Key Resort, where you can swim with dolphins, as well as a hostel, Roatan Backpackers' Hostel.  There are also a few restaurants such as The Blue Parrot, The Beach Grill at Blue Bahia, and Tranquil Seas.  Octopus Divers is in Sandy Bay, if you're staying in the area and would like to do diving. The Carambola Gardens is located in Sandy Bay as well.  If you are interested in doing volunteer work on the island, there are several non-profits in Sandy Bay, such as Clinica Esperanza, Care4Communities, and the SandCastle Library.  The Sandy Bay beach gives easy access to beautiful snorkeling, which is about a 200 meter swim from shore.

* '''[[Coxen Hole]]''' - is where the airport is located, and most of life's necessities can be found here, including stores, restaurants, and banks. 

* '''French Harbor''' - has some good restaurants and resorts and most tourists do not venture further east than French Harbor, which is at  roughly the mid point of the island.  Past this point are a few newer beach resorts, resort communities, and some private towns with beaches and resorts. Many of the resorts, restaurants and bars on this part of the island were in the past a secret of locals and expats but with the west end becoming more crowded the secret is out and more tourist are finding their way to the east end of the island.  One point of interest would be Jonesville and the infamous Hole in the Wall restaurant reached by taking a small water taxi from Jonesville to reach it. Another is Camp Bay Beach Adventure Lodge and the Tasty Tarpon Restaurant located on Camp Bay Beach the largest of all the beaches of the Bay Islands and can be accessed by car or boat.  

* '''Punta Gorda''' - Fishing community of the Garifuna.

* '''Oak Ridge''' Fishing community with few roads, and buildings on stilts over the water.  

* '''Camp Bay''' - is a further on from Oak Ridge about 4.5 miles and home to the largest natural beach on all the Bay Islands - Camp Bay Beach, which you can gain free access to at a couple different locations and has a small beachfront resort and restaurant: Camp Bay Beach Adventure Lodge. Camp Bay is about the furthest you can go in a car.  Past Camp Bay are the mangroves which are quite beautiful when navigated by boat and kayak.  There are many tours through the mangroves which can be chartered from various points on the island.

* '''Port Royal''' Small community, originally founded by English pirates

===By ferry===
The island is visited by a number of cruise lines, such as Carnival, Princess, Royal Caribbean, and Norwegian Cruise Lines. There are two cruise ship ports, Port of Roatan in Coxen Hole (non-Carnival ships), and Mahogany Bay outside of French Harbor, owned by Carnival. Non-Carnival cruises port in Coxen Hole, the dock is right in the city.

The Galaxy Wave is a modern catamaran ferry that travels to/from the Muelle de Cabotaje port in [[La Ceiba]], east of the city center on the Honduras Mainland; Galaxy Wave is currently (June '15) the only ferry option to Roatan. The ferry is fast, clean, comfortable, and reliable. It departs from La Ceiba twice daily, once in the morning at 09:30 and once in the afternoon at 16:30. Departure times from Dixon Cove, Roatan at 07:00 and 14:00. The journey lasts about 70 minutes. 

The former catamaran service by Captain Vern that provided direct ferry service between West End, Roatan and Utila is no longer operating.

The Utila Dream now provides ferry services between Roatan to Utila once a day at 10:45am on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays.

Afternoon boats can be rougher due to stronger winds. Make sure to take some travel sickness pills if you are unsure how you will react. The trip from La Ceiba to Roatan can be rougher than the return trip, some locals fly from the mainland to Roatan but will take the ferry from the island to the mainland.

==Get around==
Roatán has a system of paved roads connecting the most important communities of the Island. From the Western End of the Island, at the community of West Bay, the road leads through West End, Sandy Bay, Coxen Hole, Brick Bay, Mount Pleasant, French Harbour and Oakridge - Punta Gorda after which it becomes a dirt road and continues east for a distance, to the area of Paya Bay, Camp Bay, Port Royal, and other eastern communities.

===By bus===
Buses run every 15 min between Coxen Hole and West End during the day.  They depart from opposite the market in Coxan Hole. Buses run every hour to Oak Ridge, stopping at the new ferry terminal and passing through French Harbour, Polly Tilly Bight, and Punta Gorda on the way.  These buses leave from opposite the HB Warren supermarket in Coxen Hole.

===By taxi===
There are hundreds of taxis and they can be bargained with. But ask the price in advance and if it seems high, ask another. Even if you agree on the price make sure you have the exact amount of the fare as some corrupt taxi drivers do not give back your change. Many taxies are "colectivo" or shared and will be stopping along the way. Prices from the airport are fixed during the day and negotiable at night. A cab from the airport to West Bay is US$25. Tipping is not expected by drivers. If you are looking for contact details for a reputable taxi driver during your stay, the [http://roataxi.com roatan taxi directory] is a community contributed list of drivers with ratings from other travelers. Taking a taxi with a reliable driver is highly recommended. 

====Water Taxi====
There are water taxis during daylight that link West Bay and West End for US$3 per person 1 way. Wait on the end of a dock, and flag them down.

===Scooters===
Renting scooters is an efficient way to see different areas of the island. The rental agencies will happily provide you with detailed maps and explanations on how to best see the island. Scooter rentals can be found on the main road in West End and West Bay. The daily rent is between USD25-35. As a guarantee against accidents agencies will want to swipe your credit card. Be careful as the roads have no shoulder and local drivers stop in the middle of the road, and may pass on curves. Expect poor road quality with potholes. Speed bumpers are also abound.

===Rental Car===

Multiple rental places like avis (west bay), econo (Airport) and Roatan Sales and rentals (west end) are available in the island, prices may vary from 40USD to 75USD (Daily and depending of the type of the car) take into consideration that most places ask for a security deposit (Econo charges 1200USD). The island can be explore in one day in a 2 hour drive. Some places offers a driver too.

==Talk==
English, Spanish, Garifuna.

English is widely spoken, especially in the West End and West Bay communities and is the native language of many Roatanians of English and African descent (except for the Garifuna). Spanish is spoken natively by most residents and is the second language of many of the native English speakers. Spanish is the official language of Honduras and as such is the primary language of the school system. Garifuna is spoken by the Garifuna people who are descendants of the Kalipuna peoples of St. Vincent.  There is also 'Island Talk' spoken by the native Caribbean people.

Many individuals living on Roatan are bilingual (English/Spanish).

* '''East end''', if you are up for an adventure, visit the east end of the island past Oak Ridge to Camp Bay Beach the largest of all the Bay Island beaches.  The road changes from pavement to dirt/gravel mix and continues on to Punta Blanca and Camp Bay.  A 4x4 vehicle is not required for the journey and you'll see many driving compact cars and scooters.  This end of the island is home to many locals and some expats as well as a few resorts, one that needs to be mentioned is Camp Bay Beach Beach Adventure Lodge wich is the only resort on Camp Bay Beach. It is also the home of the Tasty Tarpon restaurant and a place to gain free access to the beach with free parking and a depot for your east end adventure from snorkeling/ diving to fly fishing and Mangrove Forest boat or kayak tours.  There are a few other interesting stops along the way such as Marble Hill Farms where wonderful local jams &amp; jellies are made.  Asylum bar &amp; grill is on a palapa literally over the calm waters in Camp Bay which can sometimes feel like the restaurant at the end of the universe after the long journey of getting there.  Luckily these places always have beer on ice and grilled food which makes the trip worth it.  If you're looking to get off the beaten path and out of the tourist ridden West End, this is it.

Santa Helena located in Roatans municipal of Santos Guardiola, is a small secluded island 12 miles further east of Roatan. This off 'the beaten path' beautiful tropical paradise is a one mile by two mile island that is sparsely populated with indigenous people that still live life as it was in the 'Old Caribbean', unspoiled and uncommercialized from tourist related development, without electricity or government subsidised infrastructure. St. Helene is the epitome of a 'sleepy little fishing village'. Access to Helene is by private boat or passenger ferry service from Oak Ridge.

* '''Pigeon Cayes''', Two small deserted islands.

* '''Punta Gorda''', renting a scooter and driving to Punta Gorda takes about 1 hr each way, and goes through some beautiful countryside.

The local currency is the Lempira, but US dollars are accepted in almost all shops and restaurants, however, your change is mostly given in Honduran Lempiras, and the exchange rate varies from in each shop.
 
Local handicrafts abound and can be had for very little money. Look for Central American arts and crafts, brightly-painted pottery, wood carvings, costume jewelry, tee-shirts, cigars and clothing.  Remember that the asking price should only be considered a jumping-off point for some downward haggling.  It's expected and if you have the stomach for it, you'll likely end up with a final price somewhere around 40-50% lower.

West End has many gift shops. There are many tourist shops where you can buy t-shirts, hats, swim-ware, etc.

<!-- List alphabetically. -->

Roatan boasts a wide array of experiences for night life depending on your taste.  Since the arrival of cruise ships, prices have risen somewhat and restaurants and bars cater to cruise passengers as well as North American and European tourists.  These types of establishments are relatively easy to find as they are mostly located in and around the West End.  Prices here are generally higher than in most other places on the island.  

The best part about drinking in the west end is the pub crawl that occurs almost every night.  Its virtually mandatory to start at Sundowners and enjoy drinks whilst watching the sun go down over the beautiful bay in front.  When Sundowners shuts at 10PM the whole bar shifts about 50 m down the street to kick on at the Purple Turtle where you can enjoy live music out the back.  The Purple Turtle closes at midnight and from here most people continue on to the Nova Bar or the Twisted Toucan's will be the joint to party at and where you will meet most of the locals in the region this being a favorite haunt.  Most people go home from here but if you really are feeling like an adventure grab a group of friends and head down the beach to FuBar.

==Stay safe==

Remember, although Roatan is away from the security problems Central America and mainland Honduras have, you should take precautions. Use common sense in the busier areas of the island. In Coxen Hole and French Harbour be extra careful specially at night and try not to travel late by yourself but rather with hotel transportation or a local from the island in who you can trust. Keep exact change (some restaraunts and taxi drivers may "Not have" enough change).

During hurricane season and strong storms is NOT recommended to travel by boat or swim. The naval forces in Honduras will alert the island about these seasons and you should take the necessary precautions.

During storms jellyfish may be wash closer to the beach, beware because the sting hurts. Remember that you are in a tropical zone, so mosquitoes can be a problem specially because they can transmit Dengue, Zika and chikungunya. It is recommended that you drink bottled water. The island municipality is a really clean place so you probably will not find any health issue but any symptom you may feel contact the emergency number in your hotel or contact the next emergency numbers:

'''Public Hospitals''': 911
'''Cemesa Hospital Roatan''': +504 9446-0097
'''ICU Roatan''': +504 2449-2925

==Get out==
* '''[[Bay Islands]]''' are in the Caribbean Sea, venture forth from Roatan and visit the 2 other larger islands in the group

* '''[[La Ceiba]]'''
