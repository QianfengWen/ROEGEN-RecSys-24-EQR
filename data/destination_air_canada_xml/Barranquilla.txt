'''[[Barranquilla]]''' is a city on the Caribbean Coast of [[Colombia]].

==Understand==

Barranquilla is a cosmopolitan and primarily industrial city, often visited by businessmen of all nationalities. However the main attraction for tourism is its carnival "Carnaval de Barranquilla," that takes place during the four days before Ash Wednesday. In November of 2003, UNESCO proclaimed it as one of 28 different "masterpieces of the oral and intangible heritage of humanity".
 
Barranquilla is also called by its residents and Colombians in general "Curramba" (from a language game, in synthesis, Curramba is a reference to "party") and the Golden Gate to Colombia (Puerta de Oro de Colombia), this due to its location on the delta of the Magdalena river, making it the most important commercial sailing port to the Atlantic Ocean for the nation.

Residents are known as "Barranquilleros" and are often characterized by their outgoing and friendly attitude and relaxed behavior.

==Get in==

===By plane===

Visitors arrive to the city traditionally by plane at Ernesto Cortissoz International Airport (BAQ). It's on the far south side. The fare is usually USD 8-12 to get to the city center by taxi, there are buses for aprox 2,200 COP. If you want to get a bus straight to Santa Marta, take the green bus for "Calle 30" and ask the driver to drop you near the Brasilia bus station on Calle 19. You will have to walk about 15 minutes from where he drops you off, but you have avoided paying for a taxi!

As of 2019 the airport is undergoing major renovations. The first flight to Bogotá leaves very early (Before 4 AM).

International direct flights are available to [[Quito]], [[Miami]] and [[Panama City]].
Domestic non-stop flights arrive from [[Bogotá]], [[Medellín]], [[Cali]], [[Bucaramanga]], [[Montería]], [[San Andrés]], [[Valledupar]] and [[Uribia]].

Airlines serving this airport are: American Airlines [https://www.aa.com], Avianca [http://www.avianca.com], COPA [http://copaair.com], Latam [https://www.latam.com] (formerly LAN), Wingo [https://www.wingo.com/es] and EasyFly [http://www.easyfly.com.co].

VivaAir VivaAir [https://www.vivaair.com/en-co] returns to Barranquilla on late June 2019 with 2 non-stop flights to Bogotá and a daily flight to Medellín. 

Airport car rental services can be arranged from abroad with: Localiza, Alkilautos, Hertz, National Car Rental and Avis.

===By bus===

Buses run by the terminal as well and will get you into the city for $0.55 or less, with the drawback of a significantly less comfortable ride experience.

Barranquilla can also be a connection to other cities of the northern coast of the country, provided the traveler doesn't have a flight connection to anywhere else in Colombia already. Long-distance bus fares (in US dollars) to some cities are :

* [[Cartagena (Colombia)|Cartagena]] - $12 (some as low as 12.000 COP)
* [[Maicao]] - $13
* [[Santa Marta]] $13
* [[Medellín]] $20
* [[Maracaibo]] - $26
* [[Caracas]] - $44

Since the bus station is quite far away from the city center, and since buses departing from there are generally slow and stop at every village, it might be a good option to travel with bus companies operating direct links to Cartagena, Bogotá or Santa Marta from around the city center. One of these is Berlinastur [http://www.berlinasdelfonce.com/ingles/html/berlinastur.html], departure to Cartagena or Santa Marta every hour, 16COP, terminal at calle 96 with carrera 46. The Transmetro's Alimentador A-71 or A-94 runs from the Terminal (Portal de Soledad) to the city (Parque Cultural), and also many "unofficial" colectivos, ask people in the street. 

Cochetur runs air conditioned van services for travel among Cartagena, Baranquilla, and Santa Marta. Price per person is around 25,000 pesos and trip time to either of the other cities is around 2 hours.

Riders are recommended to check prices and ask to see the various buses with different lines to compare the quality of the ride before buying a ticket. Not all buses are air conditioned and be ready for buses to take on locals selling snacks, drinks, and trinkets.

==Get around==

Moving around in Barranquilla depends largely on the traveler's budget, language barriers and spirit of adventure. 

===By rental car===

'''Renting a car''' is an option for visitors with a more comfortable budget, the daily fare for an economy vehicle being around 150,000 pesos a day (43 USD), and with gasoline prices of about 8,000 pesos (2.30 USD) per gallon. However, driving in Barranquilla can be obviously tricky if you don't know your way around or the changes in traffic during rush hour. Rent a car services can be dealt with from abroad or upon arrival to the hotel, may that be the case.

===By taxi===

Taking a '''taxi''' is among the most convenient options for a newcomer. As of 2018, the minimum fare is now 6,000 pesos (1.72 USD). They may be a bit more expensive at nighttime, Sundays, on national holidays or during rush hour. Taxis in Barranquilla do not have a meter: the fare is decided by the driver on the basis of distance, travel time and daytime vs. nighttime.

Ride sharing services have become very popular in recent years, although Uber is hardly used in Barranquilla. '''InDriver''' is the preferred application and differs from Uber in that riders must offer prices and wait for nearby taxi drivers to accept or counter-offer the fare with a higher price. A good tip is to offer COP 5,000 for close destinations, and never more than 18,000 unless you are heading out of town or if it is far and late at night. Please note that all ride sharing services are still illegal in Colombia, and InDriver drivers who use private vehicles as opposed to yellow taxis will ask the rider to sit in the front seat so police do not catch them offering rides for money. A safe assumption is to always sit in the front seat if the vehicle is not a standard taxi car.

===By bus===

For those with more spirit for adventure, '''buses''' are another option. In this case, talking to the driver may not be necessary, but knowing someone in town is definitely of great help when choosing the right route. Additionally, an excellent smartphone app calle Q'Ruta exists that allows users to plan routes throughout the city, and provides photos of the buses and timetables. Standard bus fares are 2,200 COP (0.63 USD) and 2,300 COP for Sundays and holidays. To get off the bus, you fill find a button on either the railing next to the door or above the door to press to let the driver know you want to get off. Be warned that the buses do not wait until you are seated before they move, and often start back up before both your feet are on the ground when getting off. They also start and stop abruptly, so hang on. 

Barranquilla also has a Transmilenio of its own, the '''Transmetro'''. You need to buy a transport card. A trip to anywhere costs COP 2,300 (January 2019) for ordinary days, and COP 2,400 for Sundays and holidays. It runs across the city and to bus terminal at Soledad.

===By mototaxi===

'''Mototaxis''' are an illegal way of transportation that has grown in popularity over the past 3 years. These consist of motorcycles charging significantly less money than a regular cab to take you virtually anywhere, but this mean of transportation is riddled with risks for personal safety, as these drivers have the tendency to be reckless.

===By motocarro===

In some neighborhoods on the outskirts of the city, '''motocarros''' are a popular and inexpensive transportation. Note that these three-wheeled vehicles are usually not allowed to circulate on major roads, so check with the driver before getting in.

Barranquilla is a large, complex city. Daytime activities are mainly of shopping and eating, but nightlife is active all year round, with bars and nightclubs open from Thursdays to Sundays in most cases. Some of the main party spots in town are La Troja, Trucupey Latin Disco,Discolo, Kapitol and Frogg Leggs if you plan to dance. 

For a more relaxed environment some options are Luna Negra, Beba Genobeba, Old Times (an 80's retro bar) and some spots known as "estancos": These are basically liquor stores with or without tables, where music is played on weekends. Commonly people gather in these places to drink listening to music from the place itself or from their own car audio systems (in Barranquilla sound restrictions are quite lenient). 
As well there are magnificent restaurants in the area known as "Washington" such as Naia, Mix where the tourist can experience an elegant, chic night.

Some places are known as "puntos frios" or "mundo de la cerveza" (world of beer), in which you should be able to get beer pretty much any day. There are also small tiendas (convenience stores all over the city).

If you are lucky enough to go during Carnival you will find yourself in a place in which everybody is up to party for entire days with no rest.

===Local drinks===
The predominant local beer is '''Águila''', which is, in fact, popular nationwide and is also the cheapest one.  However, '''Club Colombia''' is a Colombian beer with great flavor and quality, and just a little more expensive. Club Colombia is sold in three varieties: gold, red, and black, all with subtle flavor differences. Local craft beers can also be found, the most popular being '''Fulana'''. International beer is available widely, with Heineken being the preferred brand. 

The spirit of preference by locals is rum, in a variety of national and international brands. Another popular drink, '''aguardiente''' (an anise-flavored liqueur derived from sugar cane), is worth a try. Aguardiente literally means "burning water", and it honors its name. Scotch is a common drink as well, although it is a little more expensive and hence is consumed by the elite. The preferred brand is Old Parr.

Almost any type of liquor is available: whiskey, vodka and tequila some of the most prevalent.
