{{pagebanner|Izmir banner.jpg}}


'''Izmir''' is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 4 million, the second biggest port after [[Istanbul]], and a very good transport hub. The fact that almost half of its population of 4 million are under the age of 30, makes İzmir a city full of life. The city hosts tens of thousands of university students, educates scientists, artists, business leaders and academics. It is a rapidly growing city on the [[Central Aegean]] coast of [[Turkey]].

Once the ancient city of '''Smyrna''', İzmir is now a modern, developed, and busy commercial center, set around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains. The broad boulevards, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centers are dotted with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey. 

İzmir owes its position as an economically and socially dynamic city to its location, climate and the fact that it has been a home to many different cultures and religions. Persians, Ancient Greeks, Assyrians, Romans, Byzantines and Ottomans are just a few of the dozens of different civilizations that the city has hosted throughout its long history.

===History===

The history of Izmir stretches back to around 3000 BC when the Trojans founded the city Yeşilova Mound in Bornova then continued at Smyrna-Tepekule Ruins and then Kadifekalein the northern suburb of Bayrakli. This was the birthplace of Homer, who was thought to have lived here around the 8th century BC. The Aeolians, the first Greek settlers, were eventually taken over by their Greek rivals the Ionians. The Ionians were followed by the Lydians who destroyed the city around 600BC before a brief recovery following Alexander the Great’s arrival in 334 BC. 

After his death, Alexander’s generals followed his wishes and re-established Smyrna on Mount Pagos in Kadifekale, and the city then prospered under the Romans. It was destroyed by an earthquake in 178 AD but later reconstructed and became a major commercial port during the Byzantine Empire. After the Byzantines, the city had a turbulent time under the Arabs, Seljuks, Crusaders and Mongols, until Mehmet I incorporated it into the Ottoman Empire in 1415. Under Suleyman the Magnificent, Smyrna became a thriving and sophisticated city and a huge trading center, despite its frequent earthquakes. It was a cosmopolitan city , with a Greek Orthodox majority along with Armenians, Jews and Muslims. Numerous languages could be heard in the streets, spoken by locals and visiting traders. 

Following World War I and the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, and on the basis of the majority Greek population in the area, Greece was granted a mandate over Izmir from the Allies. Athens took control over the whole of the Aegean region. 

Rising tensions led the outbreak of war as the Greeks purshed further into the heart of Anatolia in an attempt to unite the Greek communities of Asia Minor. Led by Kemal Ataturk the Turkish army launched a counter-attack and seized the city. Ataturk formally took Izmir on 9 September 1922 (now celebrated as the day of the city's liberation). Soon thereafter (beginning 13 September) 70% of the city burned to the ground. The 'Great Fire' ended multinational authority of the city and the Greek and Armenian populations were expelled.

===Climate===
Due to its geographical location, similar climatic features are observed in almost every part of the province. Since the average number of sunny days reaches up to almost 300 a year, the solar potential is very high in İzmir.

Dry and sunny '''summers''' in Izmir are so infernally hot and sticky that, unless there is an air-conditioning in your room, you will most likely have trouble falling asleep at least on your first night, no matter whether the windows are wide open or not. However, a mild breeze coming in ashore from the sea (locally called ''meltem'') may refreshen the evenings, at least in locations close to the waterfront. Temperature can drop down to freezing point (0&deg;C/32&deg;F) in mostly windy and rainy '''winters''', however snowfall is some sort of curiousness in these latitudes, which happens once or at most twice a decade, if at all.

==Get in==
 
===By train===

Izmir has two railway stations: '''Basmane''' in the city center serves regional trains and the Metro, and '''Alsancak''' in the north serves intercity trains and the IZBAN. 

The main intercity services include: [[Ankara]] (''Mavi Tren'' is the fastest at 14 hours), [[Denizli]] (3 express trains daily, 5-6 hours) and [[Isparta]] (9 hours). Trains for [[Istanbul]] connect with a ferry at [[Bandirma]].

* <listing name="Alsancak Station" alt="" directions="" address="" phone="+90 232 458-31-31" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price=""></listing>

Basmane station is linked by metro (which has a seperate station than the train one) to Konak in the west and to Bornova in the east.

===By boat===

The weekend ferry from Izmir to Istanbul has been suspended (2009), one or two weekly ferries between Izmir and [[Venice]] (67 hours). All ferries dock at the Alsancak Ferry Terminal, 2km north of the city center.

* <listing name="Alsancak Yeni Liman (terminal)" alt="" directions="" address="" phone="+90 232 464-88-64 / 89" email="" fax="+90 232 464-78-34" url="" hours="" price=""></listing>

Cruise ships call on the port of Izmir all year round at Alsancak[http://www.whatsinport.com/Izmir.htm].  The center of town, Konak, is about 2 km south of Alsancak.  When you exit the pier area, turn right at the waterfront and follow the Kordon to Konak, about a 25 minute stroll.

There're also ferries from Piraeus, Greece, mostly freighter ones.

===By plane===

Adnan Menderes Airport ({{IATA|ADB}}, {{ICAO|LTBJ}}), 16 km south of the city center, has several daily flights to [[Istanbul]], [[Ankara]], and [[Antalya]]. There are also regular flights from many [[Europe]]an cities.

Turkish Airlines, AnadoluJet (is local brand in-country), Pegasus Airlines, Sun Express are local flight companies are operating the regular flights for Izmir. 

* <listing name="Adnan Menderes Airport" alt="Adnan Menderes Havaalanı" directions="" address="" phone="+90 232 274-21-87" email="" fax="+90 232 274-20-71" url="" hours="" price=""></listing>

From the airport, you have three public transport options in the city:

*'''Airport shuttles''' (''HAVAŞ'') meet incoming flights and go to and from the city center for 20 TL (be sure to get off the bus in the center of town, as the bus continues north to Tersane). Airport car rental services [http://www.adnanmenderesairport.com/en-EN/passenger-guide/to-from-the-airport/page/transportation-rent-a-car]for more information about Havas [http://www.havas.net/en/OurServices/BusServicesAndCarParkingFacilities/ServicePoints/Pages/Izmir.aspx] during COVID-19 period, departure time of the bus can change the schedule. 

*'''Public buses''' run by ''ESHOT'', transportation department of city council, are cheaper than ''Havaş'', at 5.72 TL/passenger (as of July 2020).
*Re-opened in August 2010, renovated and upgraded '''Fast Train Line'''(''İzban'', [http://www.izban.com.tr/]) connects the airport with Alsancak Station in the city center, north of Konak Square with intervals of about 15 minutes between 6 AM and 11:30 PM. It's possible to transfer to the metro in Halkapınar station (which is, indeed, the last station for some of the services) for trips further into the city center, e.g. Konak Square.

Tickets can be bought at manned booths ("gise"). There is a local transport card for residents but you can also prefer "3-5 Bilet" [http://www.eshot.gov.tr/Content.aspx?MID=126&Menuadi=3-5%20Bilet&SayfaTip=1&Sayfa=4]  (3-5 Tickets) for short term stays. The price depends on how many trips you will make. It costs 6,5 TL and 15,2 TL for 2 and 5 trips respectively. (October 2013) Please note that you cannot buy one way 3-5 Bilet as the minimum fare covers two trips. You can buy a local transport card for 6 TL. When you load money to this card, you can use every bus, train, and ferry for 2 TL for 90 minutes. Like this; you can use the train to get to Halkapınar (app. 30 minutes) and then you can use the metro line for free to go to Konak (app. 15 minutes) and then you can use the ferry for free to go to Karşıyaka (app. 20 minutes) and then you can use the train again for free back to go to the airport.

===By bus===

The bus station, or ''otogar'', is 6km north east of town although there are plenty of ''dolmuş'' that make the journey there from the centre. The bus station is huge and has an internet cafe, plenty of facilities for food and drink and a large number of agencies selling tickets for coaches which, if departing imminently, they will be shouting out the destinations of. It also has pay toilets.

Buses to [[Istanbul]] take 9 hours (including a brief trip on a ferry) and travellers are provided with water, hot drinks, snacks and regular stops for toilets and food all for free on the better services for fares around 100TL per person one way.

==Get around==

There is a restaurant located on the top of the elevator with a bird-eye view of Izmir.

* Fish, grilled sea bass and mezes. Usually, the fish is fresh and plenty in all seasons. '''Kordon Ümitköy Balıkçısı''' offers a great deal of fish in Alsancak. 
* ''Kumru'', a warm sandwich, made with a special bread with sesame seeds, Turkish sausage, grilled cheese, and tomatoes, also a vegetarian version is available without the sausage and with the addition of green pepper. This is something not to be missed while in Izmir because it's almost impossible to find it anywhere else in the country. It's sold at numerous stalls in the streets. Best to be eaten earlier in the day to have it warm as they find their way out of bakeries in the morning. Two of them are more than enough to appease your hunger and 1.25 TL is the standard price per each throughout the city. 
* Melons, because Izmir has a warm climate so melons are always local and fresh.
*Çi Börek, is one of the pastries that has been consumed fondly in Izmir for about 150 years. Also known as Crimean Pastry or Tatar Pastry, Çi Börek is a popular option for breakfast with curd cheese or minced meat. There are businesses specifically making çi börek in Eşrefpaşa and Bostanlı.

* ''Boyoz'', another local pastry but much oilier than ''kumru'', to eat with a boiled egg and a cup of tea in breakfast. It is a gift of Jews to Izmir and comes from the Sephardic cuisine. You can find different variations of boyoz, such as boyoz with artichoke, spinach, cheese, and tahini, in bakeries in Alsancak and places selling filled pastries in Mezarlıkbaşı.
*''Gümüş Tabak'', a cafe-restaurant in ''Kızlarağası Hanı'', ''Kemeraltı'', offers you the traditional Turkish delicacies, from ''Köfte'' to ''Kokoreç'' with very affordable prices. You should also try the traditional Turkish coffee that is prepared in a special way, boiled in the cup, ''fincan''.
* ''Gevrek'' or as known throughout the rest of Turkey as ''simit'', a seeded bread ring. Although it looks similar to the other bagels popular in other cities, gevrek is a pastry unique to Izmir. The "secret" of gevrek is that it is sunk in molasses before baking. This method is a tradition coming from the Caucasian Turks. Crispy, fragrant and hot gevreks with plenty of sesame makes a great breakfast when they are served with a slice of goat cheese, fresh tomatoes, green pepper and a glass of well-brewed tea. You can find gevreks every hour of the day in special glass-fronted cabinets that you can find almost anywhere as well as the bakeries in Alsancak

==Stay safe==
Izmir is a relatively safe city for its size, however, it does have its "dodgy" areas. The city center as well as populated suburbs are generally safe during the day. Use common sense if walking at night, avoid dark and narrow alleyways (found mainly in Alsancak and Konak). Avoid the streets around the main port as well as the streets around the railway junction (Hilal, Halkapinar). Be wary in Basmane, though it is fine to stay in hostels in this neighborhood (the Syrian food will keep you coming back). It is important to also be cautious in Kadifekale, which is where one of the city's main landmarks is located. It is not advisable to travel on foot in the neighborhoods on the south side of the train tracks near the city center at night. 

Use common sense and you will be relatively safe. If you find yourself in any situation don't be afraid to call the police (155). Izmir Police Department has a "tourism police" section where travelers can report passport loss and theft or any other criminal activity they may have become victims of. The staff is multilingual and will speak English, German, French, and Arabic.
