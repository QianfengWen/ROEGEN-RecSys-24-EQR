'''Shannon''' [http://www.shannon.ie] is a town in [[County Clare]], [[Ireland]].

==Get in==

Shannon is situated in the heart of Ireland's beautiful [[Shannon Region]].

===By plane===

The town of Shannon is well served by Shannon Airport [http://www.shannonairport.com/index.html] which is the second biggest airport in the Republic of Ireland after [[Dublin]] airport. Shannon Airport is well connected with the UK, Europe and the United States and is one of the very few international airports with US border preclearance. 

In terms of scheduled passenger airlines, Aer Lingus, Belavia, Centralwings, United Airlines [http://www.united.com], Delta Air Lines [http://www.delta.com], Ryanair and US Airways are the main carriers with Ryanair [http://www.ryanair.com] accounting for up to 60% of the total aircraft movements at Shannon Airport.

Recently there has been much controversy after Aer Lingus [http://www.aerlingus.com] moved their London Heathrow (LHR) slots from Shannon Airport (SNN) to Belfast International [http://www.belfastairport.com] (BFS)

===By bus===

The town of Shannon is mainly served by Bus Eireann [http://www.buseireann.ie]. A single adult fare from Dublin to Shannon with Bus Eireann costs €14.90 with return tickets available from €20.50 depending on the day of the week. 

Shannon Airport is well served by Bus Eireann with a total of 136 buses serving the airport on a daily basis. From Shannon Airport, and with changes in either Cork, Ennis, Galway or Limerick, most locations within Ireland are accessible.

Among the other major bus operators to Shannon Airport are JJ Kavanagh & Sons [http://www.jjkavanagh.ie] which connects Shannon Airport to Limerick and Dublin.

===By train===

While the town of Shannon is not served by a train station, it is possible to travel to Limerick by train, and then either connect to Shannon by bus or taxi. Limerick is directly connected to Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Rosslare by Irish Rail [http://www.irishrail.ie]

===By car===

The town of Shannon is relatively well connected with the rest of Ireland due to its close proximity to the city of [[Limerick]] which is within 20 kilometers of Shannon. Recently, major upgrades along the N7 (Dublin - Limerick), the N18 (Galway - Limerick) and the N20 (Cork - Limerick) have improved the accessibility of Shannon immensely.

===Car rental===
Car rental companies in Shannon all have locations at Shannon Airport.  Go to the Airport's website for current listings: [http://www.shannonairport.com].  Look for information under the "To & From the Airport" section.
