==Understand ==

===History===

The founder of the princely state of Jamnagar was the Great Jam Rawal, who descended on the northern coast of  Kathiawar in 1535 A.D

Jam Rawals father Jam Lakhaji ruled in Terabanu in Kutch. Then Jamnagae was known as Halar, read more on Halar at [http://www.halar.org]

According to bardic chronicles, Jam Lakhaji had two cousins Tamachi Deda and Hamirji Jadeja, they envied his reputation for valor.  Their envy was heightened by the fame of Jam Lakhaji at the siege of Pawagadh. So largely did he contribute to its capture by Bahadurshah, the Emperor of Gujarat, that he was bestowed 12 villages by him. As Jam Lakaji was going to take possession of his new fef, he was treacherously killed by his cousins Tamachi Deda and Hamirji Jadeja. Jam Lakhajis son Jam Rawal escaped and on growing up, took vengeance of his fathers murder in the same manner by killing Hamirji Jadeja.

Hamirjis two sons Khengarji and Sahibji fled to Delhi and after twelve months of waiting to meet the Great Moghul Emperor Humayun, they got the chance to join the crowd goingalong with the Emperor for lion hunting.

During the lion hunt, they got the chance to kill the lion just when it was going to attack the Emperor.  As a reward, an army of 1,00,000 was sent with them to regain back their kingdom.

When Jam Rawal heard of the two princes coming back to the Kutch with the imperial army, he started getting ready for the battle. On one night, Goddess Ashapura came in his dream and told him that as he had broken the oath taken on her name about not killing Hamirji, even though, he was the person responsible for the death of his father. She should have punished him, but as he had at all other times honored her. So he should no longer dwell in Kutch but cross the sea and take Kathiawar as a dwelling place.

Upon awakening he called his counselors and discussed the dream, they agreed that he must leave Kutch and found for himself a Kingdom across the Gulf. So Jam Rawal along with his soldiers and many traders marched out. On the way he killed and conquered the territory of King Tamachi the other conspirator in the killing of his father, and he also conquered the town of Dhrol and its dependencies and gave them to his brother Hardholji, who was later killed in battle during that period, and the  State of Dhrol was given to his eldest son, Jasoji.

Thus Jam Rawal made himself master of a great territory and the need for a capital arose.

The story goes like this, that once on a hunting trip on the land of present day Jamnagar, a hare was found to be brave enough to turn on the hunting dogs and putting them to flight. Deeply impressed by this, Jam Rawal thought that if this land can breed such hares, if his capital was built on this land, the men born here would be superior than other men.

He counsulted his astrologers and wise men, and the day chosen for laying the foundation stone was the 7th day of the bright half of the month of srawan, VS 1956. (August 1540 AD) on the banks of two rivers Rangmati and Nagmati and named it Nawanagar meaning new town. 

Nawanagar eventually came to be known as Jamnagar meaning the town of the Jams.

I have been visiting Jamnagar for the past 16 years. I've found cycling around Jamnagar a wonderful experience. Almost all areas of Jamnagar can be reached on a bicycle. Wearing a facemask helps - especially if you want to avoid dust/vehicle pollution. This is next best of course to a scooter/mobike.

== See ==
'''Balahanuman Temple''' is where Ramdhun ''Sri Ram Jay Ram Jay Jay Ram'' is 
being chanted non-stop since the last 45 years. And it 
is a world record registered with The Guinness Book of World Records.

This temple faces the Lakhota Lake (man made) which is a nice place to spend ones time. There is an open fountain show which then also narrates the history of Jamnagar. There are many food stalls and a walking and cycling path with music going on. One can take a breeze after a hectic day by just sitting on one of the benches listening to music and watching the lake shimmering in the moonlight.

Jain Temples located at "Chandi Bazaar" area in Jamnagar are worth visiting. They are historic temples built around 1564-1622.

English is understood in a few of the bigger shops.



==Stay safe==
The people of Saurashtra, in general and Jamnagar in particular, are very friendly and helpful. A case in point is when the riots took place in 2002, Jamnagar was totally unaffected though the rioting had spread up to Rajkot.
During the festival months one can find women and young girls walking around even late at night. 
The composition of the population of Jamnagar has been changing over the years. This is because of the large amount of people employed by Reliance  and ESSAR Petrochemical Refineries since mid 90s.There has been a steady influx of Indians from all over which is soon going to give Jamnagar a cosmopolitan look.

== Get out ==
The places of interest around Jamnagar are Ranjit Sagar Dam (15 kms), Vijerky Dam(20 kms), Balachadi beach(25 kms), Rozi Port, Marine Park Pirotan Island and the Reliance Mega Mart at Moti Khavdi (35kms).
