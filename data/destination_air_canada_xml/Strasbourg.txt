'''Strasbourg''' (German: ''Straßburg'', Alsatian: ''Strossburi'') [http://www.ot-strasbourg.fr/htm_uk/accueil.htm] is the capital of [[Alsace]] region of [[France]] and is most widely known for hosting a number of important European institutions. It is also famous for its beautiful historical centre - the Grande Île - which was the first city centre to be classified entirely as a [[World Heritage Site]] by UNESCO.

===History===
Strasbourg is located on the west bank of river Rhine, and has occupied a strategic position in the Upper Rhine Valley since prehistory. It was already settled from 1300 BC onwards, and developed into a Celtic market town named ''Argentorate''. The Romans conquered the area around 12 BC, and renamed it to ''Argentoratum'', and it developed into an important military base or ''castra'', stationing the 8th Legion from 90 AD onwards. 

After the fall of the Roman Empire, Alsace was occupied by the Alemanni, a Germanic tribe, who eventually were absorbed into the Frankish empire. Somewhere in the Early Middle Ages, the town must have changed its name to ''Stratisburgum''. After the split of the Frankish Empire in the 9th century, Alsace became part of the Holy Roman Empire, and it stayed within the German empire until the 17th century, even when Strasbourg obtained the status of Free City in 1262.

Strasbourg was the site of one of the worst pogroms of the Middle Ages in 1349, when over a thousand Jews were publicly burned to death, and Jews were discriminated against and prosecuted until well into the 18th century.

Strasbourg was one of the first German cities to embrace the protestant, Lutheran faith in the early 16th century. Because of this, it became a centre of humanistic learning and book printing; the first newspaper in Europe was printed in Strasbourg. In 1681, the city was annexed by the French king Louis XIV, who profited from the chaos following the 30 Years' War in Germany. However, unlike in the rest of France, the protestant faith was not outlawed. Strasbourg's status as a free city ended with the French Revolution.

After the French-German war of 1870, the Germans annexed the city and applied a policy of Germanisation, leading to the exile of those preferring to stay French. After the German defeat in World War I, the city returned to France, and now it was the turn of the French to try to eradicate the traces of German occupation. During the Second World War, the Nazis considered the Alsatians as fellow-Germans, and many were forced to fight in the German army - a situation that led them to be falsely accused of collaboration after the war.

Today, Strasbourg is the ninth largest city of France with nearly half a million inhabitants in a metropolitan area spanning across the river into the German city of [[Kehl]], on the eastern bank of the Rhine. The city itself is the seat of the Council of Europe, the European Court of Human Rights, the European Ombudsman, the Eurocorps, the European Audiovisual Observatory and, most famously, the European Parliament[http://www.europarl.eu.int/home/default_en.html], which also holds sessions in [[Brussels]].

==Talk==
The official language used throughout Strasbourg is French. The indigenous language of Alsace however is called Alsatian, a southern German dialect influenced over time by French. It is closely related to the Alemannic German dialects spoken in the adjacent border regions of Germany and Switzerland. It is still spoken by a considerable number of people in the region, especially in the rural-countryside, although like all minority languages in France, it is struggling for survival. You will see bilingual street signs in the city centre using both French and Alsatian German place names. Native speakers of Alsatian will usually be able to speak standard German as well.

==Get in==

===By plane===

* Strasbourg has its own airport ('''Strasbourg International Airport''' (SXB) [http://www.strasbourg.aeroport.fr/]), but this is rather small and ticket prices are usually quite high. It is located south-west of the city at Entzheim, with domestic as well as international flights, mostly operated by Air France. There are several flights a day to and from Paris. A frequent (every 15 minutes during the day) train connects the airport to town center (travel time 9 min) but it's a longish walk to the SNCF train station. You can buy tickets including connecting tram transport in town from the machines at the airport (€4.50, valid for 90 min). If you only need to get to the central station and can pay by card, buy your ticket on the platform (€2.80, instructions in French only). Taxis from the airport are expensive for what is a comparatively short distance - bank on paying at least €30 to the Gare Central if you speak good French. 

* Easyjet and other international carriers operate frequent flights to '''Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg Airport''' (EAP) [http://www.euroairport.com], near the Swiss border. From the airport you can take the shuttle bus to the train station of '''Saint-Louis''' (€2.50, travel time approx. 10 min), and take the local train to Strasbourg from there (€23.10, travel time approx. 1h20). Alternatively, '''Flixbus''' [https://www.flixbus.com/] offers a direct connection (€19.90, travel time approx. 1h50m), but this has to be booked in advance.

* Ryanair and other low-cost carriers fly on '''Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden Airport''' (FKB) [http://www.badenairpark.de/], some 60km away in Germany.  The best way to get to Strasbourg is to take '''bus 285''' to  the railway station of '''[[Baden-Baden]]''' (€3.40, travel time approx. 25 min [http://en.kvv.de/]). From there, you can take a local train to Strasbourg, changing at '''Appenweier''' (€13.40, travel time approx. 1h05 [https://www.bahn.com/en/view/index.shtml]).

* '''Frankfurt International Airport''' (FRA) [http://www.frankfurt-airport.de/] is the nearest inter-continental airport. Lufthansa [http://www.lufthansa.com/] operates a shuttle bus between Strasbourg and [[Frankfurt]]. Tickets can only be bought online at Lufthansa like any normal flight reservation: use FRA (Frankfurt Airport) and XER (Strasbourg Bus Station) as departure / arrival destination (€49, travel time approx. 2h30m). Alternatively, you can take the high-speed train connection, changing at Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof (€62, travel time approx. 2h [https://www.bahn.com/en/view/index.shtml]). By far the cheapest option however is '''Flixbus''' (€11, travel time approx. 3h10 [https://www.flixbus.com/]).

===By car=== 
Strasbourg has motorways connecting it to the west (A4), south (A35) and east (A5). Be aware that in France, parts of the motorways are toll roads (''péage''). Approximate travel times to Strasbourg:

* [[Basel]] (Switzerland) 1h30
* [[Stuttgart]] (Germany) 1h45
* [[Luxembourg]] 2h15
* [[Frankfurt]] (Germany) 2h20
* [[Brussels]] (Belgium) 4h10
* [[Paris]] 4h30
* [[Lyon]] 4h30

The city centre is partly pedestrianised, but driving in town is not very complicated. Large car parks can be found on the edge of the old town. See the website of [http://www.parcus.com/en/ '''Parcus'''] for more infomation.

===By train===
[[Image:Garedestrasbourg.jpg|thumb|Strasbourg railway station, with its glass sky dome]]

Strasbourg has high-speed ('''TGV''') train connections to Paris and other major towns in France and adjacent countries. TGV trains are best booked well in advance to get the best prices, as these tend to rise closer to the travel date. Local trains are operated by '''TER Alsace''', and connect to smaller towns around Strasbourg. Travel schedules can be consulted on the website of '''SNCF''' [http://www.sncf.com/en]. '''Deutsche Bahn''' also operates high-speed ('''ICE''') and regional train connections to and from Germany [https://www.bahn.com/en/view/index.shtml]. It can pay off to compare prices between the French and German providers on the same route.

The following cities have direct TGV and/or ICE connections to Strasbourg. These are not all very frequent, though, so make sure to plan your journey well.

* [[Paris]] 1h45
* [[Dijon]] 2h10
* [[Lyon]] 3h50
* [[Metz]] 1h50
* [[Nancy]] 1h30
* [[Marseille]] 6h20
* [[Besançon]] 2h00
* [[Mulhouse]] 50m
* [[Lille]] 3h00
* [[Frankfurt]] (Germany) 2h00
* [[Stuttgart]] (Germany) 1h20
* [[Luxembourg]] 1h30
* [[Brussels]] (Belgium) 3h45
* [[Bordeaux]] 6h20

The following stations are not served directly by TGV/ICE, but can be reached quite easily as well:
* [[Basel]]/Bâle (Switzerland) 1h20
* [[Zürich]] (Switzerland) 2h20
* [[Saarbrücken]] (Germany) 1h30

The railway station is located on the west-side of the town center, where you will also find the main tram station and other public transport connections. It is impressively renovated with a glass cocoon frontage, which, unfortunately, hides the beautiful neo-classicist building inside from view during the day. At night, however, it is a pretty sight when illuminated.

The square in front of the railway station is, unfortunately, not the safest place in Strasbourg, so you are advised to take good care of your belongings.

===By bus===

* [https://www.flixbus.com/ '''Flixbus'''] connects Strasbourg to Germany, with routes to [[Mannheim]], [[Heidelberg]], [[Karlsruhe]], [[Zürich]], [[Constance]], [[Freiburg]], [[Munich]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Cologne]], [[Düsseldorf]], [[Dortmund]], [[Essen]], [[Augsburg]], [[Münster]] and [[Landau]]
* [http://fr.ouibus.com/ '''Ouibus'''] is the major long-distance bus operator in France, and runs routes to [[Brussels]], [[Lille]], [[London]], [[Metz]], [[Reims]], [[Nancy]], [[Paris]], [[Mulhouse]], [[Montbéliard]], [[Besançon]], [[Lyon]], [[Marseille]] and various other towns in the west of France.
* [http://www.eurolines.fr/ '''Eurolines'''] provides bus services to [[Chalon-sur-Saône]], [[Chambéry]], [[Grenoble]], [[Nancy]], [[Paris]] and [[Reims]]. 

Services call at the bus stop next to the '''Étoile-Bourse''' tram stop.

==Get around==
The historic town centre is small enough to be easily explored on foot, but for longer distances you can use the excellent tram and bus network. Biking is also a good option, with no hills to climb and biking lanes in many locations.

===Bike rental===
Like many other French cities, Strasbourg has its own bike sharing program called '''Vélhop'''. However, since automatic rental only works through bank card payment, for tourists it is usually easier to rent them at a ''Boutique Vélhop'' (€6 per day with a €150 deposit; for locations and opening hours see http://www.velhop.strasbourg.eu/en/sag_intro_boutiques.html). 

Another option for bike rental is One City Bike http://www.onecity-tours.com/one-city-bike/ by One City Tours located at 5, Petite Rue du Vieux Marché aux Vins. There tourists can rent a bike for as few as 4 hours for 15£, for an entire day for 20£, and 30£ for an entire weekend. 

Bikes can be taken on trams except during peak hours.

===Public transport===

Buses and trams in Strasbourg are operated by the ''Compagnie des Transports Strasbourgeois'' ('''CTS'''). A few dozen numbered bus lines and six tram lines (named A to F) serve the city. A single ticketing system covers both bus and tram. Tickets are sold in ''tabacs'' (newsagents), tourist offices, CTS boutiques or from vending machines at tram stops. Tickets should be validated before use, either in the machines on the tram station platforms or in the machine at the bus entrance.

The following tickets can be bought for buses and trams throughout the metropolitan area (including the German town of Kehl) [http://www.cts-strasbourg.eu/fr/Agence-en-ligne/tarifs/Tickets/]:

* ''Aller Simple'' (single ticket) €1.70
* 10 x ''Aller Simple'' €14.00
* ''Aller-Retour'' (return ticket) €3.30
* 24 hr €4.30
* 24 hr Trio (for up to three people) €6.80
* Europass (24 hr including TER trains) €9.30 (1 adult and two children) or €14.00 (two adults and two children)

Strasbourg is a popular tourist destination primarily thanks to its beautifully preserved and pedestrian-friendly city centre, which can easily be explored on foot or by bicycle. Some areas however, especially around the cathedral, attract large tour groups, especially in Summer and during the Christmas holidays. They are better explored outside peak hours, in the evening or early morning.

Viewing platform: adults €4.60, ages under 18 and students €2.30. Astronomical clock €2, ages under 6 free"> The cathedral is undoubtedly Strasbourg's finest architectural highlight, and one of the more impressive Gothic churches in Europe. It was built between 1176 and 1439 and has a 142 metre tower, the highest cathedral tower in France. Visitors can walk up to the '''viewing platform''' (320 steps, 66m) for a spectacular view of the city. The chiming of the '''astronomical clock''' is a very short event and can be a bit underwhelming, unless you keep in mind that it is truly an amazing feat for a nearly 300 year old clock. When standing in front of the clock, be sure to look up and to your left to see the statue of the clock's architect looking at his masterpiece.</see>

===Museums===
Every first Sunday of the month, entrance to all museums is free of charge. You can buy a 1-day (€12) or 3-day pass (€18) which will give you access to all city museums. Reduced fees apply to ages under 25 and over 60, or for groups of more than 25 people. 

If you also plan to visit museums around Strasbourg, a [http://www.pass-alsace.com '''Pass'Alsace'''] may be worth the investment (€40 for 3 days of unlimited use within a two-week period).

[[Image:Petitfrance.JPG|thumb|Petite France]]

Petite France is the name given to the small area between the rivers, just south of the Grande Île. It is home to some of Strasbourg's prettiest and most photogenic streets and buildings, with half-timbered townhouses (''maisons à colombage'') leaning out over the narrow cobbled streets. Petite France resembles [[Colmar]] (a city an hour south), with picturesque canals and half-timber houses.

===Tours===
The tourist office sells a variety of self-guided walking tours through the town (Middle Ages, Renaissance, Modern and Contemporary) for €1 each, and also arranges bike tours through the Faubourgs (the suburbs of Neudorf and Neuhof). Maps, brochures and last minute accommodation are also available.

Water-bus tours are available near the Palais des Rohans (south of the cathedral). Those tours (about 45 min.) run around the town center and the European district.

'''Segway:''' You can also visit Strasbourg on a Segway. 2 companies:

* '''Onecity-Tours''' ( http://www.onecity-tours.com/ +33 9 84 46 39 24). The tours (30min to 2h) start at the agency located 5 petite rue du vieux marché aux vins, which is opened every day and bank holidays from 10AM and 6PM (earlier and later tours are also available at request).

===Events===
[[File:Christmas Fair in Strasbourg (6710495683).jpg|thumb|Christmas Fair in Strasbourg]]
[[Image:oldtown_strasbourg.jpg|thumb|Strasbourg old town facades]]
* '''[[Strasbourg's Christmas Market| Christmas markets]]''' can be found in many places, but the most important and beautiful are place Broglie and place de la Cathédrale, although they are crowded. They are the best places to drink hot wine (''vin chaud'') and to eat Christmas cookies (''Brädeles'').

* The city offers many cultural events as well. There are dozens of museums, concerts- both free and not-so-free, operas, ballet, and more. The city is vibrant with a huge political scene and a very large University. It is a wonderful city to be a student. The cafes and brasseries are welcoming and the locals are very friendly. They are receptive to all languages, but ''always'' try to use French when you can. 

* The Conservatory, Opera, Ballet, and Orchestra put on festivals at many different times of the year. In the Summers, there are nearly always markets where you can buy local food, used books, local art, and flea market type items. The Summer Markets are almost as wonderful as the Christmas Markets, just not as well decorated. There is almost always an act (or a protest) going on in front of la Cathedrale or in Place Kleber.  

Even when there are no special events on in Strasbourg, a rare occurrence, walking around the old town is a very nice way to pass a day. Make a point to go into the churches and take a look at the historic art and organs. Sometimes you can hear an organ or choir rehearsal happening and the doors are usually unlocked. And there are lots of good cafes to stop and rest in as you make your tour.

==Buy==
From time to time, the city organizes a general market in vast parts of the center, where many street vendors offer various products and the shops join in with special discounts. Then, the city center on the island is partly closed for parking or driving and the trams don't go on the rue des Francs Bourgeois. The 29th July 2006 and the 24th July 2010 (both on Saturday) were such a day, information about regular market dates is hard to find on the net. If you manage to track down the date of this market, write it here and don't miss it.

There is a marché aux Puces (flea market, antique sellers) on rue de Vieil-Hôpital on Wednesday and Saturdays. The [http://www.placedeshalles.com/ Place des Halles], 24, place des Halles, is a shopping center with over 100 shops and restaurants north of the city center, but within walking distance. Open Mon-Fri 09:00 to 20:00, and Saturdays until 20:00.

A new shopping centre, Rivetoile, opened at the end of 2008 at Place d'etoile, in between the Etoile Polygone and Etoile Bourse tram stops. This new development has shops similar to Place des Halles as well as higher budget shops and a selection of cafes.

Try Galeries Lafayettes at rue du 22 Novembre and Printemps at 1-5 rue de la Haute Montée. Rue Hellebardes and Gutenberg offer designer clothes and men's clothes. [http://www.bruno-saint-hilaire.com/ Bruno Saint Hilaire] has designer clothes for men and a shop in 8, rue Gutenberg. There is a low-budget, secondhand clothing shop in 6, rue de la Lanterne, and various gadget shops can be found in rue des Juifs.

For cheap groceries, including local wines and beers, try one of the three outlets of NORMA, a German discount chain whose three outlets are conveniently located at the corner of rue St Michel and rue Ste Marguerite near the central train station; at 79, Grand'Rue near the center of Grand Île; and at 27, rue des Frères near the Cathedral. Open Mon-Fri 10 am to 8 pm, Sat 9:30 am to 7 pm. An even better option is the COOPAlsace and PointCOOP located around the city. They sell very local wines at great prices.

==Eat==
{{style}}
Alsatian specialties are numerous and can be eaten in many traditional restaurants, in the city or in the neighborhood. Particularly you shouldn't visit Alsace without having the '''sauerkraut''' (''choucroute'' in French). Choucroute seems to have a standard price throughout Alsace of 14 Euros. Don't be too dismayed by this seemingly high price as what is brought to you is heaping plate of Sauerkraut (big enough for 2 people) as well as sausages and other meats. This is usually translated as "garnished sauerkraut" on English menus, when in doubt ask your server.  Other specialties include the Alsatian pork-butcher's meat, '''Flammeküche''' or ''flams'' (''tartes flambées'' in French) which is a sort of wafer thin pizza made with onion-cream sauce, '''Baeckeoffe''', beef and pork stew cooked, with potatoes and carrots, usually served for two or more persons and '''Fleischnackas''',  mixed beef meat presented like spirals and served with salads.

==Drink==
*Beer: Alsace is the first beer-producing region of France and Strasbourg has many breweries. Best known are ''Kronenbourg'' and ''Fischer''. The only large independent brewery left in Alsace is Meteor producing pils, lager and specials on christmas and spring.
*Medium and small independent breweries include: Licorne (medium sized), Perle, Uberach, Matten, La Mercière, Bendorf (brewed in Strasbourg).
*The bar "La lanterne" produces its own beer. 
*Alsatian white wine: usually drunk with Alsatian food, but also with fish. The main varieties are Gewürtztraminer (meaning spicy, usually sweet sometimes sugary, usually drunk as an apetizer or with dessert or foie gras), Riesling (very dry, considered the best/more complex), Pinot blanc (half dry), Pinot Gris (sweet), Sylvaner (dry and cheap) and Edelzwicker (half dry, actually a mix of the others, cheap and popular). They have a particularly floral flavour and are well worth investigating.

==Sleep==

There are many hotels around the station, especially in the ''place de la Gare'' and in the ''rue du Maire Kuss'', but this area does not offer consistent quality for accommodations. Most international hotel chains are represented with the usual 2 or 3 star hotels, many of which host the large tour groups who come on weekend breaks. If your budget allows, try staying on the Grande Île (city centre). Most of Strasbourg's hotels are fully booked during the Christmas Market period (December) and when the EU parliament is in session for a few days every month, usually for the period around the tenth. Book ahead if in doubt, as last minute accommodation can be difficult to find during these periods.

Of course the standard precautions apply: watch out for pickpockets near the Cathedral (and inside, according to the signs) during the high tourist season. But in general the city of Strasbourg is not known for violence.
