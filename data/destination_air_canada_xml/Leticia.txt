{{pagebanner|Leticia Banner.jpg}}

'''Leticia''' is a city in the [[Amazonas_(Colombia)|Amazonas]] department of [[Colombia]]. It is part of a contiguous settlement that includes [[Tabatinga]] in [[Brazil]]. On a nearby island in the river is [[Santa Rosa_(Peru)|Santa Rosa]], which is part of [[Peru]].

==Understand==
Leticia is a small town of approximately 37,000 inhabitants situated on the north bank of the Amazon River. It is the capital of the state of Amazonas, Colombia’s southernmost town (4.09° south 69.57° west) as well as its only major port on the river. It has an elevation much lower than the population centers of Colombia at 96 meters above the sea level and is hot and tropical with average temperature of 27 centigrade (80.6°F).

Leticia is a fairly well developed town and offers the full range of services for the business or recreational traveller.  It is well connected by air to Bogota, and by water to Peru and Brazil.  Tour agencies offer extensive options for exploring the nearby rivers, rainforest and indigenous communities.

==Get in==
===Immigration===
Movement between all three countries' border towns is not heavily policed and generally a person on foot or using public transit will not have to pass through any immigration procedures; but of course, make sure you're stamped into the correct country if leaving the border area.  If you happen to be traveling in a private vehicle you will probably need to stop at least on the Colombian side of the land border to have your papers checked.  Police on both sides of the border are present and have the right to check you, even if they usually do not so carry your passport for all trips across any border.  Your visa stamp will be checked by authorities on all forms of transport out of the region. 

Joint Colombian and Peruvian immigration is located on a pontoon boat permanently moored in the river, and connected to the center of the main dock in downtown Leticia.  For all journeys between Peru and Colombia, this is the only spot you will visit for all immigration procedures.  It is no longer necessary to travel across the river to Santa Rosa to get your Peruvian stamp.  If you are arriving by boat, walk over to the pontoon to get your Peru exit stamp and Colombian entry stamp.  If you are departing Colombia for Peru, go to the pontoon before you board the boat.  Both countries work in the same office, side by side.

Attention, Scam: boats from Iquitos arrive to the island in the middle, and boat drivers first bring you to the Peruvian immigration in Santa Rosa (5 soles pp) where you get the advice to take a tuk tuk for 800 m! And only then they take you to Colombian immigration on the pontoon (5 soles again), where you see a Peruvian immigration official sitting right next to him, but it's too late, you already paid the double boat fee to the captain. The captain will deny that there is a Peruvian immigration office on the shared pontoon (June 2019).

If you are departing upstream by boat, your visa stamp will be checked by Peruvian Immigration and police at each port, from initial boarding, all the way to Iquitos.  If you have somehow fallen through the cracks, it is possible to have Peruvian Immigration at Caballococha stamp you in.    

There is a usually unstaffed Brazillian immigration post at the border, which you will probably bypass.  Brazilian immigration offices are located some way down Tabatinga's main avenue, Avenida da Amizade. The Peruvian immigration office in [[Santa Rosa (Peru)|Santa Rosa]] is fairly central and easy to find, in the center of the tiny business district.  All locals will know where it is.

The Leticia airport is undergoing a major renovation and relocation during 2019, during this time you may not find immigration authorities available there so take care of your visa stamps in downtown Leticia.

===By plane===
You can only get into this spectacular, tropical and adventurous town from Colombia by plane or boat. The only place connected to Leticia by a commercial airline is [[Bogota]] and [[Medellin]], there are daily flights with companies LATAM and Avianca. The flight lasts two hours.

[[Tabatinga]] has a daily flight to [[Manaus]] with Azul Lineas Aereas.

On arrival to Leticia, nonresidents may be requested to show ID.  In addition, nonresidents are theoretically required to pay an entrance fee of 35000 pesos (Impuesto al turismo). The fee paper is colorful and it may seem that the representative is trying to sell you something if you don't understand Spanish.

===By boat===
For Santa Rosa, Peru water taxis travel back and forth on demand.  Rates seem to be set at about 3000 pesos for locals and 5000 for everyone else.  You can get these from the floating covered dock in the center of the Leticia waterfront, or at the main dock in Santa Rosa.  If the water is high you might get one right off the north side of main street in the center of the village.  These same boats can be chartered for other places, prices negotiated with the driver.   

For Caballococha Peru, boats arrive and depart from the main harbor in the center of Leticia at least twice per day and several agents on the waterfront can sell you tickets.  Upstream takes about 4 hours and downstream about 2.  

For Iquitos Peru, there are two main boat companies offering fast boats.    

The smaller and somewhat older Golfinho boat arrives and departs from the shore of the island of Santa Rosa on Monday, Thursday and Saturday.  Scheduled departure time is 0300 but it will leave once all ticketed passengers have boarded, which could be as much as an hour early.  You have two options for getting to the departure point; either stay the night in Leticia and pay around 10,000 pesos for a boat in the middle of the night, or else pay 5000 pesos for a water taxi the night before and then spend that night in the village of Santa Rosa.  There are a few basic hostels and one basic hotel.  Then, at around 0130 you can walk or take a mototaxi to the departure point.  This boat has 2-2 seating configuration and has a basic toilet on board.  Seat pitch is somewhat like airline economy plus, many of the seats are broken, and there is no common area to stand or walk in.  It is somewhat comfortable, about like a long bus ride.  Upstream, you stop at about a dozen small villages and the journey takes 17-19 hours depending on time spent on loading passengers and cargo.  The boat will probably stop to refuel once.  Two light meals are served.  Tickets are sold at the Golfinhos office on the Street of the Shoes in Tabatanga, which accepts soles or reals in payment and can usually conduct business in Spanish, Portugese and English.  You can also buy tickets from agents in Santa Rosa.     

The larger Transtur boat is similar although newer and travellers report a significantly shorter travel time of around 14 hours.  Departures are Monday, Thursday and Saturday at 0500.  This boat does not seem to make as many intermediate stops, although it does stop in Caballococha.  To get to the departure point you must take a boat from either Santa Rosa or Leticia, since it departs from a floating pontoon that you can not walk to from Santa Rosa.  You can buy tickets at the office on the Street of the Shoes in Tabatana, or at agents in Santa Rosa.   

It is possible to take one of the midday boats upstream to Caballococha and spend a night at one of the basic hotels there, and then continue upstream the next day on either of the fast boats.  This avoids the middle of the night departure.  If you want to do this book the fast boat segment at the boat ticket offices in Tabatanga.

Boats downstream from [[Manaus]], arrive in [[Tabatinga]]. There are two types of boat, one slow, one fast. The time taken varies slightly depending on the season and water level in the river, but expect 5-7days for the slow boat and 1.5-2days for the fast boat. The price of the fast boat is comparable to flying. Don't expect to see much wildlife when travelling by boat, the Amazon is really, really wide. Pink river dolphins sometimes swim alongside the boats, however.

If coming from Manaus, it is quite simple to catch the boat to Tabatinga. The slow boat departs twice a week, inquire at the pier. Bargain and don't accept the first price offered.

For the fast boat, go to the 'Terminal Ajato' at the wharf in Manaus and book directly with them. You can find this by going to the market near the wharf, then walk east until the road curves around. The booking office is on a modern floating pontoon. There will be hawkers outside, but just go on the pontoon and book direct with the Terminal Ajato office there. Make sure to bring your passport. For information on departure times you can view their website here: http://terminalajato.com.br/. As of May 2015 the cost of the fast boat is 550 reals - or more than the cost of a flight booked a week in advance and just slightly cheaper than a last-minute flight. The journey takes about 36 hours and includes food. From Tabatinga's pier it is a short taxi ride or long walk to Leticia.

==Get around==
Most of the area is walkable.  The airport is about a 30 minute walk from the center, and the center of Tabatanga is an hour or so.  

Mototaxis abound. It should be about 1000 COP from the center to the border with Brazil, more if you're going to the port. There are also motocarros, covered tricycle-type vehicles in which you're more protected from the elements. You can rent a moto or a bicycle in various points around town.

==Do==
Because of its privileged position as a triple frontier and being very close to a tributary river Yavarí, Leticia can serve as the perfect base for eco-tourism activities as well as for the studies of wildlife and flora in the Amazon region. It can also be the perfect starting point for visiting indigenous tribes such as the Tikunas, Yaguas, Huitotos and Boras in the Amazonas [http://www.amazon-indians.org] [http://www.matses.org]. On the Yavarí river you can find the Yaguas and Mayorunas.

Close to Leticia you can also find [[Amacayacu National Park]] which is on Colombian territory. On the Yavarí River there is also a natural Reserve. The ribera peruana is also a zone with virgin tropical forest. Amongst others in the ribera peruana, the Cayaru river can be found.

Leticia also greets 2 or 3 tourist cruises in the season between March and April such as the MV World Explorer, MV Bremen, MV Le Levant. Celebrity guests also include the famous Mr. Bill Gates.

Cautious travellers MIGHT want to have a yellow fever certificate ready, showing vaccination at least 10 days earlier.  While the vaccination IS (technically) required, the check is very infrequently performed.

==Buy== 

Colombian, Brazilian and Peruvian money are all freely traded in all three towns. If getting the best rate matters, check out the rates at the money changers. In May 2016, for example, you could get a very good rate when exchanging Colombian pesos to Brazilian reals - much better than the xe.com official rate. There are frequently problems with the ATMs in Tabatinga, so withdrawing pesos and converting them to Reals may be your only option. There is no ATM in Santa Rosa, so if you want soles you will need to convert another currency.

*<buy name="Joyeria Roma" alt="" address="Carrera 8, 7-61" directions="almost directly across from 'Tierras Amazonica' restaurant" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="">Carrera 8 could be said to be the "main drag" of Leticia, for it is here where one will find the greatest and widest variety of shops and services of all sorts.  Of all of these, however, this jewelry store stands out from all the rest, as it offers some really unique and beautiful jewelry (by ANY standard), at exceptional prices.  The owner/designer, Libardo Sanchez (who also speaks English), is a second-generation jeweler from a family of some repute, and it clearly shows in the quality of merchandise he has to offer in his store (it must also be said that he is also happy to fix or repair anything you have that might have gotten broken in your travels).  Come in and be delighted!</buy>

==Eat==
Leticia is a melting pot for food, even though they commonly eat the same things each week. The delicacies of each region Colombia are made here. For example, many people make sancocho, a hearty soup, in different regions of Colombia. Each family will have its own variation. Common staples are meats baked together with potatoes, and sometimes vegetables, usually cooked over a stovetop in a pan. A usual Sunday meal might consist of grilled meats, cooked in makeshift charcoal grillers, served with rice and plantains.
*<eat name="Tierras Amazónicas" alt="" address="Carrera 8, 7-50" directions="" phone="" url="" hours="" price="moderate" lat="" long="">Nice setting, good food. Lots of fish and seafood options, including cazuela (a kind of soup/stew).</eat>

Highly recommended.</eat>


==Drink==
*'''Calle 11 & Carrera 6'''. Leticia's own "Nightclub Alley", the corners of Calle 11 & Carrera 6 are home to a number of bars and nightclubs busy every day of the week.  Far enough away from the downtown core that tourists are unaware of its existence, people wanting to party with the locals should not hesitate to come and bar-hop here as this is, unquestionably, where Leticianos come to drink, dance, and party.  Also a great place to get good, cheap, street-food.
*'''Mossh'''. In parque Santander, plays merengues, bachatas, brasilian pop, electronica, etc. Beer 4,000-6,000 COP (NOTE- this  is 2 to  3 times more than what you'll pay pretty much anywhere else in the city). Whisky 15,000.
*'''Colors'''. Near the library and close to Mossh. The setup is good for groups.
*'''La Tribu'''. Great friendly place owned by an uruguayan. Beers are 2,700 COP and there's pizzas too. Close to Parque Orellana (Anaconda Hotel)
*'''Blu'''. Another great club for merengue, bachata, mexican pop, rock. Beer 3,000 COP. Perfect to bounce from La Tribu once you meet someone. May charge cover on certain nights.

==Internet==

The internet in Leticia comes from satellites and is painfully slow. Many hostels do not have working internet at all. 3G - even 2G - mobile phone service is almost non-existent as of May 2016. There is an internet café in an orange-coloured Papeleria on Avenida Internacional that will also allow you to connect your own device to their wifi for 2,000 COP/hour, the speed here seems to be the best in town (Skype calling just about possible).

==Get out== 

===By plane===
There are two daily flights to [[Bogota]], one on LAN, one on Avianca. You can connect to many other destinations in Colombia for only slightly more than the cost of a Leticia-Bogota flight. If you want to fly to Manaus, you need to cross the border and use Tabatinga's airport. Promo fares can be had for less than R$500, or cheaper than the fast boat. One flight daily, leaving 7pm on Azul.

===By boat===

'''To [[Puerto Narino]]'''
* Fast boats leave three times daily from Leticia's port - 8am, 10am and 2pm. 29,000 COP, 1.5-2hours. Other stops along the way in some of the smaller villages, e.g. La Libertad, Santa Sofia, [[Macedonia]].

'''To Benjamin Constant'''
There is a fast boat to [[Benjamin Constant]] that leaves around every half hour, or whenever it's full, from the port in Tabatinga - it costs 20,000 COP. 

'''To Iquitos'''
* Slow and fast boats leave from Santa Rosa to Iquitos 6days a week (they take different days off, so there are actually boats leaving every day). The fast boat (el rapido) leaves around 3 in the morning and the slow boat (la lancha) at 6 or 8 in the evening. Slow boat price is S/.80, although you can try to bargain this down slightly. Don't forget to stamp out of Brazil or Colombia before asking for your Peruvian entry stamp.

'''To Manaus'''
* Go to the ports in [[Tabatinga]] for travel towards [[Manaus]] and [[Belém]]. Slow boats from Tabatinga to Manaus leave only Wednesday and Saturday, and from a different port south of the busier main port. It takes between 3-4days, depending on the season and water level - if the water is higher, the boat can take a few extra shortcuts. There are cabins, some even with a/c, but most people sleep in hammocks (bring your own). The price is negotiable, the ticket seller will probably ask for the ''gringo price'' of R$200 to start, but DO NOT agree to pay this. Brazilians will pay R$150 for the trip from Tabatinga-Manaus, you should aim to pay the same - it IS possible for foreigners to get this price. It is easier to get a better price if you buy the day before, but even a couple of hours before the boat leaves it can be had for R$180 or less. DO NOT pay more than R$180 under any circumstances, be firm and hold your ground. The ticket office is the building on the left hand side after you walk through the arch, before you come to the boat (prices are from May 2016).

* NOTE: If stamped into Colombia, make sure to get your Colombian exit stamp at the DAS office in the airport, or if you are coming from Peru make sure you get your Peruvian exit stamp at the office in Santa Rosa, the Brazilian policia federal will not stamp you into Brazil until you have stamped out of your previous country. You will not be allowed to even buy a boat ticket without a Brazilian entry stamp. Note that if you are only passing through Leticia (coming from Peru) or staying for just a few days, it is not necessary to stamp into Colombia at all.

Some notes on the slow boat from Tabatinga to Manaus:
* '''Alcohol is forbidden on board'''. If you are bringing it, keep it in unmarked containers, or premix it and don't be obvious when consuming it.
* Your luggage will probably be sniffed by dogs before boarding the boat, and after a few hours the Brazilian ''policia federal'' may stop the boat and perform a very thorough check on your luggage - completely emptying your backpack. There may be several other less thorough checks, maybe just of your passport, but possibly also your luggage. Hide any contraband (including alcohol) accordingly.
* There is free coffee and hot water on board (mornings and evenings), and also free drinking water (24/7). Unlike the boats in Peru, you don't need to bring your own bowl and cutlery for the meals (included in your fare), although if you do bring them you can get your food "to go" and eat it when you want and outside of the dining room.
* The shop sells snacks, soft drinks etc. and also some cooked food, but absolutely no alcohol.
* There are televisions on board, you should be able to watch any football games that take place during your trip, and also the finest Brazilian soap operas! The signal is analogue and comes from an aerial that needs to be constantly adjusted.
* A good place for your hammock is on the upper deck closer to the end without the toilets, and further away from the engines - but not too close to the TV.
* There are lots of plugs for recharging your electronics onboard, most are dual European/US type, some are only the round European type.
* The food is okay (except breakfast), unless you are a vegetarian. Meals are served very early, especially breakfast, be careful not to miss them. Some of the stops the boat makes you may be able to quickly disembark and get some food from a stall at the dock. Unlike in Peru, there are not many food sellers who will come onto the boat, though there may be a couple at some of the stops.
* If you land in Leticia on the LAN flight from Bogota on a Saturday or Wednesday and want to head straight to Manaus rather than waiting around for a few days, you need to be very quick and to get a bit lucky. Get your Colombian exit stamp in the airport, then take a taxi straight to the ''policia federal'' office in Tabatinga for your Brazilian entry stamp. You will almost certainly be too late to catch the boat before it leaves Tabatinga (scheduled 12pm, it may be slightly late), instead go to the other port where the rapidos leave to Benjamin Constant. The slow boat takes 1 hour to reach here and docks for an hour at the port, so if you are lucky you can catch up to it. The slow boat's next stop is not until Sao Paolo de Olivenca, there are also rapidos that go here, although they are more infrequent and expensive.
* There are also stops in Amaturá, San Antonia do Ica, Tonantins, Jutai, Fonte Boa and Alvaraes.
* Overall, the boats are much more spacious, cleaner and comfortable than Peruvian boats, but hardly luxurious. The showers use clean water rather than river water. Less cargo is transported, although the boat still stops for an hour or more at some of the towns along the way. You may also find them less "fun", since people tend to go to bed very early (probably due to the lack of alcohol).
