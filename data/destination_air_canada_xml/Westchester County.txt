{{pagebanner|Westchester County Banner.jpg}}

'''Westchester County''' [http://westchestergov.com] is a county of [[New York (state)]] in the [[Metro New York|New York metro area]]. It lies to the immediate north of the [[New York City]] borough of the [[Bronx]]. A number of its villages and towns serve as bedroom communities for commuters to New York City, but Westchester itself is also open for business. Pepsico, IBM, MasterCard, Reader's Digest and other prominent corporations have their headquarters here. But it's not all work and no play. There's plenty to see and do in the county. Westchester County Office of Tourism [http://www.westchestertourism.com] is the official provider of visitor information.

==Understand==

Home to Fortune 500 companies, ritzy exclusive bedroom communities where [[New York City]]'s white collar executives take respite from the city's bedlam each evening, miles of beautiful parks and beaches, quaint colonial era-villages and hamlets, and urban cities that feel like a direct extension of the Bronx due south, Westchester is a highly diverse and interesting destination criminally overlooked by visitors to the region. Ride a nearly century-old rollercoaster at Playground Park ([[Rye]]), take a hike in the county's many scenic nature parks, walk along one of the beaches abutting Long Island Sound, or dive into the county's rich culinary options; whatever you seek, Westchester can deliver.

==Get in==
===By car===
For drivers unfamiliar with the region it is important to understand before hitting the road the difference between the "parkway" and "interstate"-designated highways of [[Metro New York]]. "Parkways" are limited-access highways that are distinguished from regular highway-type roads by their landscaped tree-lined medians, low-clearance stone overpasses, and off-limits commercial vehicle law. The latter feature, largely a result of the prominent narrow-arched overpass bridges on the older parkways, explicitly bans commercial and truck traffic from utilizing the parkway system and is zealously enforced by county police highway patrols. DO NOT attempt to drive any commercial vehicle or semi-truck onto any of the blatantly-marked parkway entrance ramps; a hefty fine or, worse still, a thousand angry drivers stuck behind your decapitated vehicle might result otherwise. 

From Connecticut and New England: I-95 ("The Connecticut Turnpike") and the Merritt Parkway enter southeastern Westchester from [[Fairfield County]] and provide connections with most of the region's principal road arteries.

From Upstate and upper Hudson Valley: I-684, the Taconic State Parkway, the Saw Mill River Parkway, and I-87 (The NY State Thruway) penetrate the county via the north on their spiraling southward trek toward the [[NYC]] line. 

From New Jersey: The George Washington Bridge and I-95 can be used to reach Westchester from the Garden State and points westward, but be HIGHLY forewarned that this artery (esp. the Cross-Bronx Expressway) is infamous for sudden grid-lock congestion at any time of the day. A more safe alternative would be taking the northbound Garden State Parkway or Palisades Parkway to Nanuet/Nyack and then hitting eastbound I-287 for the Governor Mario M. Cuomo (former Tappan Zee) Bridge.

===By air===
* '''Westchester County Airport''', [http://airport.westchestergov.com].  The biggest airport of the lower Hudson Valley, other than the New York City/New Jersey airports. Tickets can be pricey, but it's oh-so-convenient to arrive smack in the middle of your destination and bypass the traffic around the three major international airports. Rental cars are available.
* '''Newark Liberty International Airport''', [[Newark (New Jersey)|Newark]], [[New Jersey]], [http://www.panynj.gov/CommutingTravel/airports/html/newarkliberty.html], '''John F. Kennedy International Airport''' [http://www.panynj.gov/aviation/jfkframe.HTM], and '''LaGuardia Airport''' [http://www.panynj.gov/CommutingTravel/airports/html/laguardia.html]: The three major international airports in the New York City area offer service to just about anywhere. Westchester-based taxi and livery cars offer regular service to and from the three internationals from most areas of the county. New York City yellow cabs will take to you Westchester in a pinch, but the fares can be exorbitant. If staying in Westchester, ask if your hotel offers shuttle service.

===By train===
* '''Amtrak''', [http://www.amtrak.com]. Some trains make stops at [[Yonkers]] and [[Croton-on-Hudson]] and in [[New Rochelle]]. However, if you are coming from New York City, keep in mind that Amtrak trains from there are much more expensive than Metro-North to these stops.
* '''Metro-North Railroad''', [http://www.mta.info/mnr/html/mnrmap.htm]. Three branches of Metro-North Commuter Railroad serve the county, all from Grand Central Terminal. The Hudson Line travels the far west flank of the county along the bank of the river (on trains departing from Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan, get a seat on the left side of the train: opposite Yonkers and Hastings-on-Hudson you will be treated to great views of the sheer cliffs of the Palisades). The Harlem line drives up the middle, and the New Haven line follows the shore of Long Island Sound.
* '''New York City Subway''', [http://www.mta.nyc.ny.us/nyct/subway/index.html]. You can take it to the southern edge of Westchester County and bus up further.

==Get around==
It's possible to plan around public transportation (county bus system, [http://transportation.westchestergov.com/timetables-and-maps] commuter rail), but to make the most of your visit a car is necessary.
===Public Transport===
* '''Metro-North Railroad's''' [https://new.mta.info/agency/metro-north-railroad] Harlem, New Haven, and Hudson lines can be used for intra-county travel, but service is infrequent outside of the peak hours (especially north of Croton-Harmon and North White Plains). 

* '''Bee-Line Bus System''' [https://transportation.westchestergov.com/bee-line/] has fairly comprehensive coverage of Southern Westchester's urban centers/business parks and interconnects with the New York City Subway in the Bronx, though the more rural northern half of the county is not well-served by bus routes.
===By Car===
Limited-access parkways like the Hutchison River, Sprain-Brook, Taconic, and Cross-County are useful road arteries for traversing the region, though beware only passenger cars are allowed on them (no commercial vehicles or semi-trucks!) and they are notorious for gridlock during rush hour or after an auto accident. 

I-684, The New England Thruway (I-95), I-87, and the Cross-Westchester Expwy (I-287) are wide open to registered vehicles of most classes and types unlike the parkways, but as a result often experience unpredictable heavy traffic (particularly I-95 and I-287).

Free concerts and fireworks in season; first come, first served in the picnic and barbecue area.

Fans of Washington Irving's ''Legend of Sleepy Hollow'' can follow the route of Ichabod Crane from the center of [[Tarrytown]] north into [[Sleepy Hollow]]. But don't expect to find the "Western Woods" or anything else from the 1999 movie ''Sleepy Hollow''. Tim Burton's production is only loosely based on Irving's story, and was filmed largely in [[Hertfordshire]], [[England]].

* Explore the county from the perch of a '''bicycle''' seat. [[Moab]] it isn't, but if you've got a mountain bike you've got your pick of three county parks that sport mountain bike trails. For flatlanders, the Old Croton Aqueduct is a mostly level dirt trail, and the paved North and South County Trailways follow the relatively gentle grades of the old Putnam Line railway. There is presently a gap between the North and South County Trailways in Elmsford that requires a connection via local streets.

* '''South County Trailway,''' ''+1 914'' 864-7275, [http://www.westchestergov.com/parks/Trailways.htm]. Multi-use paved trail runs from Eastview in the town of [[Greenburgh]] to just over the [[Yonkers]] border. Enjoy a rest stop at one of the benches around Woodland Lake.

==Get out==

One of the prime perks of Westchester County (and a reason for the exorbitant cost of living there) is its close proximity to many of the nation's largest cities. [[New York]] is a stone’s throw away to the south and easily accessible by bus, train, and car from the county. The "City of Brotherly Love" ([[Philadelphia]]) is a three hour or less drive down I-95 while [[Washington DC]] and [[Boston]] are a bit further away by train or car.

If you want to temporarily escape the hustle/bustle of city life by getting your tan on the beaches of the [[Jersey Shore]] and Hamptons are also doable road-trips from the area, though the more-nature oriented might feel inclined to take a short drive/train trip up north to bask in the natural beauty of the [[Hudson Valley]]
