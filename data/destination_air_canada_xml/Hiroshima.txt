'''[http://www.hcvb.city.hiroshima.jp/e_navigator/ Hiroshima]''' (広島) is an industrial city of wide boulevards and criss-crossing rivers on the coast of the [[Seto Inland Sea]].

Although internationally famous for the horrific split second on August 6, 1945, when it became the site of the world's first atomic bomb attack, Hiroshima is now a modern, cosmopolitan city with excellent cuisine and a bustling nightlife.

Those expecting to step off the Shinkansen into a pile of smoldering rubble will be in for a surprise, as Hiroshima has all the ferroconcrete and blinking neon of any other modern Japanese city. Teenagers stream in and out of the station, where McDonald's and the latest ''keitai'' (mobile phones) await; hapless salarymen rush down Aioi-dori to their next meeting, casting a bloodshot eye toward the seedy bars of Nagarekawa as they pass. At first glance, it can be hard to imagine that anything out of the ordinary ever happened here.

Today, Hiroshima has a population of more than 1.1 million. Automobiles are a major local industry, with Mazda's corporate headquarters nearby. There are three excellent art museums in the city center, some of Japan's most fanatical sports fans, and a wide range of culinary delights - most notably the city's towering contribution to bar cuisine, Hiroshima-style ''okonomiyaki''.

Although many visitors, especially Americans, may feel apprehensive about visiting Hiroshima, it is a friendly, welcoming city, with as much interest in Western culture as anywhere else in Japan. Tourists are welcomed, and exhibits related to the atomic bomb are not concerned with blame or accusations. Bear in mind, though, that many ''hibakusha'' still live in the city, and even most of the young people in Hiroshima have family members who lived through the blast. As such, the average Hiroshima resident isn't likely to relish talking about it, although you needn't shy away from the topic if one of the chatty fellows around the Peace Park brings it up.

===History===
Hiroshima was founded in 1589 on the delta formed by the Ota River, flowing out to the Seto Inland Sea. The warlord Mori Terumoto built a castle there, only to lose it eleven years later to Tokugawa Ieyasu after the Battle of Sekigahara, which marked the beginning of the Tokugawa shogunate. Control of the area was given to the Asano clan of samurai, who ruled without much incident for the next two and a half centuries. Their descendants embraced the rapid modernization of the Meiji period, and Hiroshima became the seat of government for the region, a major industrial center, and a busy port.

====World War II====
By World War II, Hiroshima was one of the larger cities in Japan, and a natural communications and supply center for the military. Forced laborers from Korea and China were shipped in by the tens of thousands, and local schoolchildren also spent part of their days working in munitions factories. Residents of the city must have felt curiously blessed for the first few years of the war, as Hiroshima had been left largely untouched by American bombing campaigns; that was, however, intended to ensure a more accurate measurement of the atomic bomb's effect on the candidate cities, which had been narrowed down to Hiroshima, [[Kitakyushu|Kokura]], [[Kyoto]], [[Nagasaki]], and [[Niigata]].

[[Image:AtomicEffects-p42a.jpg|thumb|right|300px|print=inline|2000 feet from ground zero, 1945]]
On 6 August 1945 at 8:15AM the American B-29 bomber ''Enola Gay'' dropped an atomic bomb dubbed "Little Boy" on Hiroshima. It is estimated that at least 70,000 people were killed in the explosion and its immediate aftermath. Most of the city was built of wood, and fires raged out of control across nearly five square miles, leaving behind a charred plain with a few scattered concrete structures. Corpses lay piled in rivers; medical treatment was virtually non-existent, as most of the city's medical facilities had been located near the hypocenter, and the few doctors left standing had no idea what hit them. That evening, radioactive materials in the atmosphere caused a poisonous "black rain" to fall.

In the days ahead, many survivors began to come down with strange illnesses, such as skin lesions, hair loss, and fatigue. Between 70,000 and 140,000 people would eventually die from radiation-related diseases. Known as ''hibakusha'', the survivors were also subject to severe discrimination from other Japanese, but have since been at the forefront of Japan's post-war pacifism and its campaign against the use of nuclear weapons.

Recovery was slow, given the scale of the devastation, and black markets thrived in the first few years after the war. However, the reconstruction of Hiroshima became a symbol of Japan's post-war pacifism. While most of the city is thoroughly modernized, there are areas &mdash; such as the ramshackle buildings east of the train station (slated for demolition over the next few years) &mdash; that still reflect that 1950s rush to rebuild.

}}

In July and August, when days of heavy rain give way to brutal, muggy heat. Book accommodations with air conditioning if that is when you are planning to visit.

In the latter half of September, warm and pleasant days are interspersed with typhoons powerful enough to wreck buildings (such as the one that nearly destroyed '''Itsukushima Shrine''' on [[Miyajima]] in 2004) and keep travelers locked up in their hotels. Typhoons normally blow through in a day or two most of the time, however. Daily weather reports on TV are usually accurate and you can often get a good idea of what will happen and how to plan your schedule.

October and November are ideal, with less rain and cool, refreshing temperatures. The winter months are fine for a visit &mdash; the weather is dry, with very little rain or snow, and the temperatures are rarely cold enough to keep you indoors. As elsewhere in Japan, though, a number of museums are closed from 29 Dec to 1 Jan (or 3 Jan). 

April and May also have comfortable weather, with some rain but far less humidity than what starts in June. The cherry blossoms usually bloom from late March or early April, and the parks around '''Hiroshima Castle''' turn into a mob scene with ''hanami'' parties. For ''sakura'' with a bit more solitude, go for a hike on '''Ushita-yama''', overlooking the north exit of JR Hiroshima Station (see [[Hiroshima#Recreation|Recreation]]). Nearby Miyajima is also a beautiful and popular cherry blossom area.

===Literature===

* Eleanor Coerr's ''Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes'' tells one version of the story of Sadako Sasaki, a young bomb victim who was inspired to fold cranes by a Japanese folk tale, which said that anyone who folds over a thousand cranes will have their wish come true. According to interviews with her parents, Sadako completed more than a thousand before she died of leukemia at the age of twelve; in Coerr's book, she finished about 640 before died, and her schoolmates completed the rest in her memory.

* John Hersey's ''Hiroshima'' is a short but gripping book that describes the experiences of six people &mdash; five Japanese citizens and a German priest &mdash; before and after the blast. It was originally published as an issue-length article in ''The New Yorker'' in August 1946. Almost forty years later, Hersey returned to Hiroshima to write a follow-up article, which continues the survivors' stories in the post-war years, and it is included in new editions of the book.

* Masuji Ibuse's ''Black Rain'' is a novel about the post-war experiences of a family of ''hibakusha'' as they face discrimination in post-war Japanese society for both employment and marriage, and cope with health problems from radiation poisoning, the consequences of which were barely understood by doctors at the time.

* Keiji Nakazawa's ''Barefoot Gen'' is the most popular ''manga'' treatment of the atomic bomb story, based loosely on Nakazawa's own experience as a young boy in the days immediately after the blast.  It is very graphic.

* Many Japanese people also associate Hiroshima with the ''yakuza'', thanks to the classic 1971 Bunta Sugawara / Kinji Fukasaku gangster film ''Battles Without Honor and Humanity'' (also known as ''The Yakuza Papers'') and its four sequels, which were set in the city.

===Tourist information===
There is a '''tourist information office''' on the first floor of the south side of the station, and another on the second floor of the north side. Both are open 9:30 AM-5:00 PM daily. Be aware that Hiroshima is a popular day trip destination for people staying in [[Kansai]], and the lockers just outside the shinkansen exit are often completely full from late morning. There are additional lockers available on the street level entrance to Hiroshima Station. Another option is to go to a luggage forwarder (''takuhaibin'') office in the station and they can both send your luggage to another location or hold your baggage for the day. While generally a bit more expensive than the lockers, it is ideal if you have some oversize items or a lot of stuff. Most offices close around 6 or 7 PM however. Many people in fact try to cram in both Hiroshima City and [[Miyajima]] into a single day, but a full day at least for each would be far more rewarding. In fact, stampeding to the Peace Park from Hiroshima Station and then leaving the city like so many people do would be sorely cheating yourself - Hiroshima has many other very good sights and history, and is far more than just a city that got A-bombed.

===Districts===
Generally speaking, addresses in '''Minami-ku''' (Minami Ward) are in the station area, while '''Naka-ku''' (Naka Ward) covers the Peace Park and its surroundings.

==Get in==

===By plane===
'''Hiroshima Airport''' ({{IATA|HIJ}}) [http://www.hij.airport.jp/english/] is in nearby Mihara City and connects to domestic destinations in Japan. Both ANA and JAL offer flights from [[Tokyo]] Haneda and [[Sapporo]] Chitose airports. ANA also offers flights from Narita, [[Sendai]] and [[Okinawa]]. There are direct international flights from [[Beijing]], [[Dalian]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Shanghai]], [[Seoul]], and [[Taipei]]. Those with the time can also visit the beautiful Sankeien Garden next to the airport and enjoy a nice traditional Japanese garden with lots of spring flowers, autumn leaves, and a large carp pond.

Buses connect the airport to JR Hiroshima Station (50 minutes, ¥1370) and the Hiroshima Bus Center (51-53 minutes, ¥1370) [http://www.chugoku-jrbus.co.jp/airport/]. There are also buses from the airport to [[Okayama]], [[Onomichi]], [[Iwakuni]], [[Tottori]], and other spots in the [[Chugoku]] region.

===By train===
'''JR Hiroshima Station''' is a 25 minute walk from the Peace Park. If you arrive by Shinkansen, you will be at the north side of the station. There is an underground pedestrian walkway leading to the main side of the station (south exit), where all other trains arrive. Take the pedway and head upstairs; you will see the taxis, trams, and buses that lead to the city center. If you continue on the underground walkway, you'll reach an escalator that exits by a major bridge, with the station now behind you; you can walk to the Peace Park from there, branching right on Aioi-dori.

Hiroshima is a major station on the '''JR West''' [http://www.westjr.co.jp/english/global.html] Sanyo Shinkansen line. It is roughly 40 minutes from [[Okayama]] (¥5610, adult unreserved seat) and 90 minutes from Shin-[[Osaka]] (¥9890). [[Tokyo]] is four hours away via ''Nozomi'' (¥18,380) and 4½-5½ hours via ''Hikari''.

If you have a Japan Rail Pass, you cannot use the ''Nozomi'', so if you are traveling from Tokyo or Nagoya you will have to take one of the two hourly ''Hikari'' trains and change at either Shin-Osaka or [[Himeji]] to the ''Hikari Rail Star'' or ''Sakura''. There are also a few ''Hikari'' departures from Nagoya in the morning that run directly to Hiroshima with no change of trains necessary. Pass holders can also use the Meipurupu bus that loops through Hiroshima City.

Traveling overnight by train from Tokyo, you can take the 10 PM ''Sunrise Izumo/Sunrise Seto'' train to Okayama, then take a ''Mizuho'' train to Hiroshima, arriving at 7:21 AM. Japan Rail Pass holders using this route must change to a Sakura train at Okayama, arriving just before 8 AM.

Regular train services run through Hiroshima on the Sanyo Main Line (between [[Kobe]] and [[Fukuoka]]), along with several local lines.

====Overnight by train with rest stop====

If you hold a Japan Rail Pass, and you wish to travel overnight from Tokyo (or any other distant city), you may want to split up your journey, stopping at an intermediate destination en-route in order to sleep somewhere. The cost incurred will only be for the hotel room; the Rail Pass covers your transportation. This is a good way to travel overnight, especially if you are able to find cheap accomodations, such as a business hotel. Yes, it may be a little hectic, and it might require some research, but this method carries two significant advantages: '''location''' and '''money'''. You will more than likely find good accomodations very close to a main train station in a smaller city, compared to a big city such as Tokyo, and it will more than likely be cheaper than hotels found in a big city. You could use the money you save to forward some of your luggage to Hiroshima using a '''luggage delivery service''' and take an overnight bag with you, which will make the journey easier.

As of March 2012, here is one way you ''could'' go about this from Tokyo: at 7 PM, leave for [[Himeji]] by taking the Hikari train and changing to a Kodama service at Shin-Osaka station. Once in Himeji (arriving around 11 PM) you can take a rest at Himeji's [http://www.toyoko-inn.com/e_hotel/00080/index.html '''Toyoko Inn'''] which costs as low as ¥5,230 for a single room or ¥2,990 double occupancy. At 6:54 AM the next morning, board the first bullet train of the day, a ''Sakura'' service, and you will be in Hiroshima by 8 AM. This trip takes longer than taking the overnight train and shinkansen connection as described above, but it is cheaper; you only have to pay for the hotel room, complete with your own toilet and shower.

===By bus===
'''[http://www.h-buscenter.com/ Hiroshima Bus Center]''' (広島バスセンター)  is on the third floor of the '''SOGO''' department store, which is just down the street from the Peace Park. '''Coin lockers''' are available at both the Hiroshima Bus Center and JR Hiroshima Station.

Long-distance buses arrive and depart from the north exit of JR Hiroshima Station, where there is a JR Bus counter, and the Hiroshima Bus Center in the city center. There is service to and from cities in [[Kanto]], [[Kansai]], [[Kyushu]], [[Shikoku]], and much of the rest of Japan.

The ''New Breeze'' overnight bus runs between [[Tokyo]] and Hiroshima. There are two nightly departures in each direction: departing from Tokyo at 8PM and 9PM, with both buses arriving in Hiroshima at 8AM the next day. The trip costs ¥11,600 one way, ¥21,200 round trip.

There are two overnight buses from [[Osaka]] &mdash; the ''Sanyo Dream Hiroshima'' from JR Osaka Station and the ''Venus'' from the Namba bus terminal. Both cost ¥5700 one way, ¥11,000 round trip. One overnight bus runs from [[Kyoto]] between JR Kyoto Station and Hiroshima at (¥6300 one way, ¥11,400 round trip).

Daytime express buses run from Osaka (about five hours each way), with five departures daily (¥5000 one way, ¥9000 round trip) and two from [[Kyoto]] (5½ hours, ¥5500 one way, ¥10,000 round trip).

Among the many discount bus carriers that ply these routes, '''[http://willerexpress.com/ Willer Express]''' runs services from [[Tokyo/Shinjuku|Shinjuku]] in Tokyo (from ¥6600 one way), and from Kyoto, Osaka and Kobe (from ¥3400 one way), with online booking in English available.

===By ferry===
Ferries dock at Hiroshima's '''Ujina Port''', which also serves as terminus for several tram lines. '''Ishizaki Kisen''' [http://www.ishizakikisen.co.jp/] operates daily service to and from [[Matsuyama]] in [[Shikoku]], with some boats stopping in [[Kure]] along the way. The ride (known as "Superjet") takes 70-80 minutes to reach Matsuyama and costs ¥6500 each way. Slower ferries arrive in about 2½ hours at a much-reduced cost of ¥3200.

===By car===
From the San'yo Expressway, take exit 29 for Hiroshima. Heading southwest on National Highway Route 54 will take you to the center of town; Route 2 is the major east/west artery, south of the city center. Confirm in advance that your hotel offers parking &mdash; not all do, and public parking is both expensive and hard to find.

==Get around==
===By tram===
[[Image:JP-34_Hiroden.jpg|thumb|300px|Green Mover bound for Hiroshima Port]]
Hiroshima has an extensive tram (streetcar) network, which is operated by '''Hiroden''' [http://www.hiroden.co.jp/train/rosenzu/streetcar_map.htm] (広電). It's a slow but reliable way of getting around. The trams themselves are a mix of classic trams (Hiroden bills itself as a working museum of trams) and sleek, new "Green Movers" &mdash; although they all run on the same lines for the same fares. There's no difference other than the smoothness of the ride. Because the trams were bought from other cities, you're getting a tour of Japanese transit history &mdash; some have been in service for more than fifty years, and that might be an old [[Kyoto]] tram taking you through Hiroshima.

Most lines originate from JR Hiroshima Station, and run frequently during daytime and evening hours, approximately one tram every 10 minutes per line [http://www.hiroden.co.jp/train/rosenzu/map/english1.pdf]. Boarding and payment procedures vary by tram; however, the entrance and exit are clearly marked in English. (If in doubt, just follow the locals.) Pay as you exit. Change machines are usually available on board if you don't have exact change &mdash; check near the front or back of the car. Trips within the city are a flat ¥160, save for one line that runs between Hakushima and Hachobori for ¥100; trundling out all the way to Miyajima-guchi (to catch a ferry to [[Miyajima]]) will set you back ¥280. One-day passes are available from the tourist office for ¥600 (¥300 children), or ¥840 (¥420 children), which includes the ferry to Miyajima. There is a very well priced ¥2000 two day pass which includes unlimited tram use (including to Miyajima), the ferry and both ropeways. If paid for individually it would add up to much more than this.

Arguably the greatest value can be had from the 3-day [https://www.hiroden.co.jp/en/e-vhtp.html Visit Hiroshima Tourist Pass], which is available for ¥1000 and includes all Hiroshima buses, trams, and the ferry to Miyajima (but not the ropeway). This pass also provides some discounts to major attractions, including the Peace Memorial Museum and Hiroshima Castle. In addition, the coupon book provides substantial (up to 50%) discounts to a few restaurants in Hiroshima and the surrounding cities. A "wide area" version of the same pass, but covering express buses and transit to some of the surrounding cities in addition, is available for ¥3000. You cannot use any of them for JR trains, however.

===By bus===
Bus lines run through Hiroshima and out to the suburbs. Generally speaking, these serve areas more likely to be used by locals than visitors. Signs include English, and buses depart next to the tram depot in front of JR Hiroshima Station.

===By metro===
The modern '''Astram''' [http://www.astramline.co.jp/] (アストラムライン) links the city center with the northern suburbs, although there aren't many tourist sights out that way. Trips range from ¥180-470 by distance, with departures every few minutes between 6AM-midnight. The underground station at the end of Hon-dōri, near the Peace Park, is the terminus in the city center.

===By bike===

Hiroshima is a great city for cycling. Most of the sidewalks are fairly wide by Japanese standards; the paths along the branches of the rivers offer a very pleasant ride, and if you're looking to test your legs, head up to the hills around [[Hiroshima#Hijiyama Park area|Hijiyama Park]]. Many hotels will be happy to arrange bike rentals.

* Tourist information centers in JR Hiroshima station keep a map of associated rent-a-cycle outlets within downtown Hiroshima. Most of the outlets have their rental desks located in the lobbies of major hotels. The price is ¥1000 per day for an electric-assist bike, and the bikes can be rented from and returned to any of the associated outlets.

[[Image:Hiroshima_Peace_Memorial_Park.png|300px|thumb|print=fullpage|Map of Peace Memorial Park]]
===Peace Memorial Park===
{{disclaimerbox|Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum is temporarily closed between August 7th and September 12th..}}
[[Image:Genbaku dome.jpg|thumb|300px|A-Bomb Dome]]
Most of the memorials related to the atomic bomb are in and around the '''Peace Memorial Park''' (平和公園 ''Heiwa-kōen'') [http://www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp/top_e.html], reachable by tram line 2 or 6 to ''Genbaku Dome-mae''. Coming from JR Hiroshima Station, you'll see the Peace Park on your left just before crossing the T-shaped '''Aioi Bridge''', which was the target of the bomb.

Once part of the busy '''Nakajima''' merchant district, this area was destroyed almost in its entirety by the bomb. Today, there are more than fifty memorials, statues, and other structures in the Park. Some will be obscure in their meaning; others are immediate and devastating. There is no entry fee, save for the Peace Memorial Museum, and access to the grounds is not restricted at night.

* The skeletal remains of the '''A-Bomb Dome''' (原爆ドーム ''Genbaku Dōmu'') are the most recognizable symbol of the atomic bombing in Hiroshima. In another lifetime, the building was one of the city's best-known sights for an entirely different reason; designed by Czech architect Jan Letzel in 1915, the Hiroshima Prefectural Commercial Exhibition Hall (and its fanciful green dome) had a bold European style in a grimy, crowded city with few modern flourishes. Because the explosion took place almost directly above the building, the walls remained largely intact, even as the dome shattered and the people inside were killed by the heat of the blast. Initially, as the city rebuilt, it was left alone simply because it was more difficult to demolish than other remains in the area; gradually, the A-Bomb Dome became the symbol it is today. The "Hiroshima Peace Memorial" was declared a [[UNESCO World Heritage List|UNESCO World Heritage site]] in 1996 amid some controversy &mdash; the [[United States]] and [[China]] both voted against the nomination for reasons related to the war. Today, the benches around the Dome are a favorite spot for Hiroshima natives to read, eat lunch, or simply relax.

* One block east of the A-Bomb Dome (outside Shima Clinic) is a plaque which marks the '''hypocenter''', the exact point above which the bomb exploded.

[[Image:AtomBomb_Kannon.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Memorial Tower to the Mobilized Students]]

* The '''Children's Peace Monument''' (原爆の子の像 ''Genbaku no ko no zō'') is perennially draped in thousands of ''origami'' paper cranes folded by schoolchildren across Japan in the memory of the young bomb victim Sadako Sasaki (see [[Hiroshima#Literature|Literature]]).

* The '''Memorial Tower to the Mobilized Students''' commemorates the 6,300 students who were conscripted to work in munitions factories and killed in the atomic bomb. There are statues of doves scattered throughout its five levels; at the base is a beautiful Kannon statue, always draped with origami cranes.

* Tens of thousands of forced laborers from Korea were working in Hiroshima at the time of the attack. But the '''Monument in Memory of the Korean Victims of the A-Bomb''' was erected outside the Peace Park in 1970, and only moved within its boundaries in 1999. Today, the turtle at the base of the monument &mdash; symbolically carrying the dead to the afterlife &mdash; tends to be draped in his fair share of colorful origami cranes and flowers.

* The '''Peace Bell''' is engraved with a world map, drawn without borders to symbolize unity. The public are welcomed to ring the bell &mdash; not coincidentally, the log is aimed to strike an atomic symbol. ''(Ring the bell gently, so as not to damage it.)''

* The '''Atomic Bomb Memorial Mound''' holds the ashes of 70,000 bomb victims who were unidentified or had no living relatives to claim them. Services are held in their memory on the 6th of every month.

* The '''Rest House''' was known as the '''Taishoya Kimono Shop''' at the time of the explosion. Only one employee, who was in the basement at the time, survived. However, the reinforced concrete building stayed mostly intact. (The interior has been entirely refurbished, but the preserved basement is possible to visit with advance request.) Today, it holds a gift shop, some vending machines, a helpful tourist information office, and &mdash; as the name would suggest &mdash; a place to rest.

[[Image:Cenotaph for A-Bomb Victims.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Cenotaph for the A-Bomb Victims]]

* Inside the '''Cenotaph for the A-Bomb Victims''' is a stone chest with a registry that is intended to contain the names of every known person who died from the bombing, regardless of nationality. (Names are added as ''hibakusha'' pass away from diseases thought related to the radiation of the bomb.) The Japanese inscription reads, "Let all the souls here rest in peace, for the evil shall not be repeated." Note how the arch frames the A-Bomb Dome in the distance.

* At the other end of the pond from the Cenotaph is the '''Flame of Peace''' (平和の灯 ''heiwa no tomoshibi''). It is said that the fire will burn until the last nuclear weapon is gone from the earth.

The entrance of the museum leads downward to a quiet hall for contemplation, and then back up again to a set of kiosks with compelling stories and recollections from survivors (in English and Japanese). Like the Cenotaph and the Peace Memorial Museum, it was designed by architect Kenzo Tange.</see>

The rest of the museum describes the post-war struggles of the ''hibakusha'' and an appeal for the abolition of nuclear weapons in the world today. Be warned: a visit here, while absolutely worthwhile, ''will'' ruin your day. Allow plenty of time afterward to decompress.</see>

* The '''Statue of Mother and Child in the Storm''', completed in 1960 by artist Shin Hongo, is among the most powerful works of art created in response to the atomic bomb. It depicts a woman shielding her child from the black rain. It's in front of the '''Fountain of Prayer''' just south of the Peace Memorial Museum.

* The '''Gates of Peace''' were installed in 2005 on Heiwa-o-dori, just south of the Peace Park, by a pair of French artists. On the sidewalk and the surface of the gates, the word "peace" is written in 49 languages. The ten gates are meant to represent the nine circles of hell from Dante's ''Inferno'', plus a new one: the hell created by the atomic bombing.

====Outside the Peace Park====

* As you explore the city and outskirts, keep an eye out for maroon-colored marble '''historical markers''' such as the one outside the A-Bomb Dome or the one marking the Hypocenter, which have photographs and text in both Japanese and English. You'll come across markers as far as a few miles away from the Peace Park &mdash; which lends perspective to the distance and extent of the damage.

* <see name="Honkawa Elementary School Peace Museum" alt="本川小学校平和資料館" address="1-5-39 Honkawa-chō, Naka-ku" directions="Genbaku Dome-mae tram stop" phone="+81 082-291−3396" url="http://www.honkawa-e.edu.city.hiroshima.jp/peace/peacetop.htm" hours="Open during school hours" price="Free" lat="" long="" email="" fax="">Of the more than 400 students and teachers who were in the school when the bomb exploded, only one student and one teacher survived. After a new school was built, this section of the original structure was kept as a museum, housing a small collection of photos and artifacts.</see>

* <see name="Fukuro-machi Elementary School Museum" alt="袋町小学校平和資料館" address="6-36 Fukuro-machi, Naka-ku" directions="Fukuro-machi tram stop" phone="+81 082-541-5345" url="http://www.fukuromachi-e.edu.city.hiroshima.jp/shiryoukan-index.htm" hours="9AM-5PM daily" price="Free" lat="" long="" email="" fax=""> Like Honkawa, part of the original school building that remained standing after the atomic bomb has been converted into a museum. In the days after the explosion, survivors used the school's chalk to leave messages for lost friends and family members on its blackened walls.</see>

* After the A-Bomb Dome, the former '''Bank of Japan''' at 5-16 Fukuro-machi, Naka-ku (''Fukuro-machi tram stop'') is the best-known pre-bomb structure in Hiroshima. Built in 1936, the city's main branch of the ''Nippon Ginko'' was only 380 meters from the hypocenter; although its exterior remained intact, all 42 people inside the bank were killed by the heat of the blast. Remarkably, the bank was back in service only two days after the bomb and continued operation until 1992, when it was acquired by the city. Occasional art exhibitions are now held there. Hours of access are irregular, but it's worth stopping by to check.

* Somewhat incongruously, the 1925 '''Hiroshima Mitsui Bank''' at 7-1 Hon-dori, Naka-ku (''Hon-dōri tram stop'') also survived the blast, and now serves as home of a busy Andersen Bakery. The ground-level renovations and the ceiling of the Hon-dori arcade combine to obscure its age, but there's a historical marker on the corner. Stepping out of Hon-dori to the side street gives a better view of the building &mdash; and how the city rebuilt around it.

* There is a fascinating, little-known '''pre-bomb house''' on the outskirts of [[Hiroshima#Hijiyama Park area|Hijiyama Park]]. Walk up toward the park on the street branching upward from the Hijiyamashita tram stop. You'll see a temple on your left with a historical marker out front. Just past the temple is a set of stone steps, leading up to a small house and explanatory plaque. (Notice the vane at the top of the house, warped from the heat of the bomb.) Please note that while visitors are welcome in the front yard, the rest of the area is private property, including the house itself.

* From the Shinkansen side of JR Hiroshima Station, you'll see an enigmatic silver tower on Futaba-yama, the mountain ahead. That's the '''Peace Pagoda''' (''Busshari-to''), built in 1966 in memory of those killed by the atomic bomb. To reach it, simply head uphill on the main street facing away from the station. You'll pass through a quiet, pleasant neighborhood of cafes and hillside houses, climb steps, and eventually reach '''Toshogu Shrine'''. Follow the road around the shrine and you'll reach the red lanterns and ''torii'' of '''Kinko Inari Shrine'''. Head through the gates and up the steps to reach the Peace Pagoda. It's an even more impressive sight from the top of the mountain; inside the Pagoda are two gifts containing ashes of the Buddha, which were a gift to Hiroshima from [[India]] and a group of [[Mongolia]]n Buddhists, along with thousands of prayer stones. You'll also be able to see the whole jumble of the city below.

===Chuo Park area===

* <see name="Chuo Park" alt="中央公園" address="Naka-ku" directions="Genbaku dome-mae tram stop" phone="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">A big, sprawling green space in the middle of the city. Broadly defined, the park grounds include many of the attractions below, including the castle and the Carp's old baseball stadium (scheduled for demolition). But Chuo Park is worthy of note in its own right, with nice, long walking paths and athletic fields &mdash; there are quite a lot of open-invitation soccer, football, and ultimate frisbee games that are regularly held here, so don't be shy about showing up with athletic shoes and seeing if anyone needs an extra.</see>

It was destroyed by the atomic bomb, by which time it was serving as a military headquarters, and reconstructed in 1958. Some of the original concrete foundations can still be seen. Today, the castle grounds are a nice place for a walk, and definitely Hiroshima's favorite place for ''hanami'' (cherry blossom parties), with 440 ''sakura'' trees. The five-story castle museum is an attractive reconstruction of the 16th century ''donjon'', with interesting relics and armor to see (and try on), as well as some informative displays about the history of the castle and the city. The view from the top is worth the entrance fee all by itself. Explanatory pamphlets are available on the first floor, along with an English audio guide, if desired. Closed from Dec.29-31, Ninomaru until Jan 2nd.</see>

===Hijiyama Park area===

* <see name="Hijiyama Park" alt="比治山公園" address="Minami-ku" directions="Hijiyamashita tram stop" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="" email="" fax=""> A huge park to the south of JR Hiroshima Station, between two branches of the river. (Follow Ekimae-dori from the station to the southeast, and you'll walk directly into it.)

There are a few famous Western names in its collection, including Andy Warhol and Frank Stella, but the real focus is on interesting modern Japanese artists working in their own styles, and the exhibition designers make creative use of the museum space. Special exhibitions cost extra. There is a sculpture garden outside that can be visited for free, and a decent city-view from the plaza near the museum's front steps. NB: Closed for renovations until spring, 2023.</see>

Space is limited, and reservations required. Bookings can be made in English" price="Free" lat="" long="" email="" fax=""> Mazda's corporate headquarters are a short distance outside of Hiroshima. The tour is a must for any automobile fan, but if you have any serious technical questions, then you should go on the Japanese tour and bring along your own interpreter, as there's less detail on the English tour. Highlights include the Mazda Cosmos (the world's first car with a rotary engine) and the 4-Rotor Mazda 787B, which is the only Japanese car to win at Le Mans. From there you will be taken to their Ujina plant and the actual assembly line, with a look at some of their concept vehicles. From JR Hiroshima Station, take the Sanyo Line in the direction of Saijō or Mihara to JR Mukainada Station (two stops); cross the rails and exit through the south exit. From the train station exit, head straight on the street a little to the right of the exit until you see the confusingly labelled pharmacy, called "Zoom-Zoom". Head down the stairs opposite Zoom Zoom into an underpass and you'll exit in the Mazda Admin building's parking lot.</see>

The ''tahoto'' (treasure pagoda) was moved here from [[Wakayama]] in 1951 and consecrated in memory of the victims of the atomic bomb. From JR Hiroshima Station, take the Kabe Line to JR Mitaki Station. It's a 15-minute walk from there. Behind the temple you can also hike to the top of Mt. Mitaki.</see>

Despite more and more high-rises peeping over the trees recently, Shukkeien can feel like an entirely different world, with little paths crossing ponds on bridges and winding their way around graceful teahouses and waterfalls. It's directly behind the Prefectural Art Museum, and combined admission tickets are available.</see>

" price="¥300 ferry one way"> Another great half to full day outing from the city for those with the time is Bunny Island, famous for its large number of rabbits who are happy for a handout. You need to take the train to Tadanoumi Stn (with a transfer at Mihara; those with a rail pass can conveniently use the shinkansen) and then catch the 15 minute ferry to the island. The ferry office also sells rabbit food you can purchase. Some people take their own food like carrots and cabbage, but the rabbits seem to prefer the rabbit food (and can get pushy to get it). The best time to go is in the morning. Most of the rabbits congregate around the ferry port, and from afternoon they usually get sleepy and are not so active. Ferries leave every half hour or so, but to avoid a wait, it is better to check train schedules and plan accordingly. In addition to the rabbits, there are hiking trails for good scenery, a resort, the ruins of a power plant, plus a wartime poison gas factory and museum.</see>

* <see name="Senseki Garden" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="082-434-3360" email="" fax="" url="http://senseki.org/" price="¥700"> The suburb of Higashi-Hiroshima City is often overlooked by travlers, yet it offers an astonishingly beautiful traditional Japanese garden, opened only about 20 years ago. It is about a 15-minute taxi ride from Saijo Stn (25 minutes from the Higashi-Hiroshima shinkansen station) but there are also some limited free shuttle buses from Saijo Stn most weekdays. You can see carefully selected rocks making up the 15,000 sq. m. garden, a miniature Mt. Fuji, cherry blossoms, azaleas, water lilies, and carp pond.</see>

There are food vendors and things for sale, but live performances now dominate the program, with comedians and J-pop bands on stages along Heiwa-o-dori. It's the smaller performances that make the Flower Festival worthwhile, though, particularly in the stalls near Jizo-dori, where you might stumble across a phenomenal [[Okinawa]]n band or a local jazz combo.</do>

For the price of entry, attendees can drink their fill of ''sake'' from local breweries. In short order, the festival area turns into a wild (yet reasonably well-behaved) display of public drunkenness involving people of all ages. Outside the festival area, tours of ''sake'' breweries are also available, with wood ''sake'' cups are available as souvenirs for your visit. JR Saijo Station is just a couple of stops from Hiroshima &mdash; you'll be swept up in the crowds as soon as you arrive.</do>

There's a flea market as well, and usually some cultural performances at the castle in the evening.</do>

===Recreation===
{{infobox|Know Your Carp|The Hiroshima Carp have no competition for the city's sports loyalty. Some key facts to get you up to speed:

* The Carp ''own'' the color red in Hiroshima, but it wasn't adopted by the team until 1973, along with their [[Cincinnati|Cincinnati Reds]]-style logo. Red is intended to symbolize a never-ending fighting spirit.
* The 1978-80 '''''Akaheru''''' (Red Helmets) team was almost certainly the team's apex, setting league records for home runs and winning two championships.
* However, the Carp's last pennant was 1991, giving them the longest title drought in Japanese baseball.
* Slugger '''Koji Yamamoto''' is '''Mr. Red Helmet''', the team's all-time great (now retired). The cream of the recent crop are outfielder '''Shigenobu Shima''', the '''Red Godzilla'''; outfielder '''Tomonori Maeda''', the '''arrogant samurai'''; and pitcher '''Hiroki Kuroda''', an export to the [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles Dodgers]] (and as of 2012 playing for the New York Yankees).
* Cash has been a recurrent problem throughout the team's history, with local citizens pitching in to keep the team afloat on more than one occasion. Today, '''Mazda''' is the team's largest minority owner, but without a deep-pocketed sponsor like [[Tokyo]]'s Yomiuri Giants or even [[Sapporo]]'s Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters, the Carp struggle to hang on to free agents.
* The Carp's mascot, '''Slyly''', bears a striking resemblance to the [[Philadelphia|Philly]] Phanatic because he was designed by the same firm.}}

After more than fifty years in a stadium across the street from the Peace Park, the Carp moved to the new '''Mazda Zoom Zoom Stadium''' to begin the 2009 season. While the team doesn't win much, the enthusiasm of the fans can hardly be faulted, and Hiroshima is as good a place as any to witness the fervor of Japanese baseball fandom. Tickets range from ¥1,800 to ¥3,500. Ask for the Carp Performance (カープ パフォーマンス) tickets &mdash; that's where the drums, chants, and excitement are. Tickets are sold at the stadium starting at 10AM, the "Green Window" at JR Hiroshima Station, the [http://www.carp.co.jp/facilities14/calpio.html "Carp Baseball Gallery"] and a number of convenience stores.</do>

==Work==
Hiroshima features the standard array of English teaching opportunities, with branches of major ''eikaiwa'' like '''Geos''', '''AEON''' and '''ECC''' as well as small, niche language schools. The '''Hiroshima International Center''' (see [[Hiroshima#Contact|Contact]]) is a good place to make inquiries, as is a Saturday night at '''The Shack''' or '''Kemby's''' (see [[Hiroshima#Drink|Drink]]).

'''Mazda''' is largest employer of foreign personnel in the area, due to their relationship with the Ford Motor Company in [[Detroit]] and their manufacturing plants in [[South America]]. Contract workers from [[Southeast Asia]] and the [[South Pacific]] are brought in by Hiroshima-based firms for industries such as ship-building, notably in the nearby city of [[Kure]]. 

Some non-Japanese work illegally &mdash; or under-the-radar &mdash; as bartenders or sell jewelry in Nagarekawa, which motivates occasional visa crackdowns (see [[Hiroshima#Stay safe|Stay safe]]).

==Buy==
===Money===
There is an international ATM in the lobby of the central '''post office''', which is on your right as you exit the south side of JR Hiroshima Station. English menus should be available. International ATMs with English menus are also available at '''7-Eleven''' convenience stores [http://www.sevenbank.co.jp/intlcard/service2.html], which are open 24 hours in plentiful quantities throughout the city.

If you need to change money, the bank across the street from the station - on the first floor of the Fukuya department store &mdash; can handle transactions to and from most major currencies.

===Shopping===
Shopping in Hiroshima is dominated by a few huge department stores; in fact, trains deliver you directly into a fairly bland one called ASSE, which occupies the floors above the south exit of JR Hiroshima Station. Hon-dori (本通り), a covered shopping arcade in the city center, is the place to wander with a wallet you'd like to empty.

[[Image:Okonomiyaki.jpg|thumb|300px|right|print=inline|Okonomiyaki]]
Hiroshima is famous for its style of '''''okonomiyaki''''' (お好み焼き), which literally means "cook it as you like it".  Often (and somewhat misleadingly) called "Japanese pizza", it is better described as a type of savory pancake made with egg, cabbage, soba noodles, and meat, seafood or cheese.  It is grilled in layers on a hot plate in front of you and slathered liberally with ''okonomiyaki'' sauce, with optional extras such as mayonnaise, pickled ginger, and seaweed. It sounds and looks like a mess, but is very tasty and filling. To give you a sense of the civic pride involved here, the Hiroshima tourist information office offers a map with a whopping ''97'' shops serving ''okonomiyaki'' within city limits, and reports have several hundred more in the area. Micchan (みっちゃん) is the most famous of the Hiroshima- style okonomiyaki restaurants with long histories. It has a few branches in and around the center of Hiroshima.

Hiroshima style and [[Osaka]] style are the two competing types of ''okonomiyaki'', and if you raise the subject of ''okonomiyaki'' with a local, be ready to state your preference between the two!  Basically, in Hiroshima the ingredients are layered and pressed together while cooking, while in Osaka the batter is mixed together first, and the ingredients do not include soba noodles.  According to local legend, both dishes originate from a cheap snack called ''issen yōshoku'' (一銭洋食) or "one-cent Western meal", which consisted of a wheat and water pancake served with scallions and sauce. People in Hiroshima love both Kansai and Hiroshima-style okonomiyaki. So, Tokunaga (徳永) is the most famous Kansai-style okonomiyaki restaurant in Hiroshima. 

Hiroshima is also famous for its '''oysters''' (available between October and March) and a maple-leaf-shaped pastry called '''''momiji manjū''''' (もみじ饅頭).  (''Momiji'' is the leaf of a Japanese maple tree.)  Momiji manjū are available with a variety of fillings, including the more traditional ''anko'' (あんこ), red bean and ''matcha'' (抹茶), or green tea; it's also available in cream cheese, custard, apple and chocolate flavors. Boxes of ''momiji manjū'' are considered the quintessential Hiroshima souvenir, but [[Miyajima]] is the best place to buy it fresh.

If you're pressed for time on your way out of town, the sixth floor of JR Hiroshima Station has a good, cheap ''ramen'' shop, an ''udon'' shop, a decent ''izakaya'', a conveyor belt sushi place, and '''STEP''', a good ''okonomiyaki'' joint with English menus. There are Japanese and American chain restaurants clustered near the station, including '''Starbucks''' on the third floor (south exit), '''McDonald's''' on both sides of the station, and the ultra-cheap (¥180 per bowl) '''Bikkuri Ramen''' (びっくりラーメン) just across the river from the south exit.

{{infobox|Some perspective for weary travelers|If you've lost your luggage, checked into a shoebox-sized business hotel that reeks of smoke, and had your stomach pumped after eating some bad eel, you still haven't had a worse trip than '''Tsutomu Yamaguchi''' did. 

In August 1945, Yamaguchi was sent to Hiroshima on a business trip. With the job done, his co-workers left, but Yamaguchi realized that he had forgotten his personal seal for signing official documents, so he headed back into town to pick it up. That's when the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. Badly burned, deaf, and partially blind, he spent a night in the ruins of the city, and then found a railway station on the western edge of the city that was back in operation. He managed to catch a train home to [[Nagasaki]], where &mdash; as Yamaguchi explained to his disbelieving boss what had happened in Hiroshima &mdash; the second atomic bomb was dropped.

In 2009, the Japanese government certified the still-living Tsutomu Yamaguchi as the first known person to have been at ground zero of both atomic blasts. A year later, Yamaguchi passed away from stomach cancer at the age of 93.}}

===Budget===

For a short night before an early train, the cheapest digs in town will be to nap in the easy chairs at the two Internet cafes outside the south exit of JR Hiroshima Station (see [[Hiroshima#Contact|Contact]]), or possibly a Nagarekawa karaoke box. You won't be the only one doing it, particularly on weekends. In particular, the [http://www.wip-fe.com/hiroshima/ WiP Internet Cafe] on the southwest side of the station is a right gem, offering a 9 hour private booth nightpack for ¥2,190, inclusive of shower usage and offers the rare option of staying in a ''separate'' non-smoking area. Actually, a nine-hour booth (either a reclining chair or Japanese-style sleeping option) will cost you only ¥1,900,[http://www.wip-fe.com/hiroshima/guide/index.html#price] though as of October 2012, they've offered a ¥500 discount. Patrons must purchase a ¥200 membership, valid for one year. Don't choose to stay in the open area if you want to actually sleep.

==Stay safe==
[[Image:Hiroshima_mother_and_child.jpg|thumb|250px|right|print=inline|Mother and child, Peace Memorial Park]]
Hiroshima has a rough reputation among Japanese people from other cities, thanks largely to the ''yakuza'' movies that were filmed in town. In reality, though, it's much safer than any large Western city.  As with most places in Japan, petty theft is virtually non-existent. Nagarekawa, the nightlife district, does have its share of prostitutes, sex clubs, and rip-off hostess bars, but to no greater extent than [[Tokyo]] or [[Osaka]].

There have been a few surprise police raids on bars that offer dancing after 1AM, in accordance with a semi-obscure local law about public immorality that Hiroshima occasionally feels compelled to enforce &mdash; probably in order to catch people who are in the country illegally. Japanese citizens are generally allowed to leave right away, but foreigners have been made to stand in line to have their paperwork checked. If you find yourself in one of these situations, just stay calm, show the police your passport, and you'll eventually be allowed to leave without any trouble.

==Cope==

Hiroshima is a safe and friendly city, accustomed to and eager to receive foreign visitors. The average English level among Hiroshima residents is relatively high for a Japanese city, particularly around the Peace Park. Directions to the major sights are clearly sign-posted in English throughout the city.

The Peace Memorial Park is a very popular school trip destination for Japanese students, and you may be accosted by kids working on school projects, asking you (in halting English) where you're from, what your name is, or whatever else their teacher has assigned them to ask. They travel in packs, so you should be able to see them coming from a distance and avoid (or engage) accordingly.

As mentioned above, visiting the sights related to the atomic bomb can be an intense experience. If you only have one day set aside for Hiroshima, several hours could be spent at the atomic bomb memorials. Hiroshima has ''far more to offer'' however, such as Shukkeien, Mitakidera, Hiroshima Castle, Okonomi-Mura, etc and they are relatively close by.
