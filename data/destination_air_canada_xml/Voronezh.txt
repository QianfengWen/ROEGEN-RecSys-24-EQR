'''Voronezh'''[http://www.voronezh.ru] is a city in [[Voronezh Oblast]], ca. 250 km from the [[Ukraine]] border, in the heart of [[Chernozemye]]. It is located on the Voronezh river and is an important railway junction with lines to [[Moscow]], [[Rostov-on-the-Don]] and [[Kiev]]. Due to its relatively large population (ca. 1.024.000), it is often considered as the capital of [[Chernozemye]].


==Get in==

===By plane===

Relatively small '''Voronezh-Chertovitskoye International Airport''' ({{IATA|VOZ}}) [http://www.voronezhavia.ru/] with several connections to [[Moscow]] and flights to [[Munich]], [[Prague]], [[Yerevan]] etc, provided by '''Polet Airlines''' [http://www.polet.ru/].

===By train===

Many trains to and from Moscow every day. The most suitable options are the day train no. 45 (less than 8 hours) and the night trains nos. 25 and 81/83. You can also travel to and from other Russian and Ukranian cities. The main station is Voronezh 1, but most of the trains going to the south via Voronezh stop only at Pridacha station, which has marshrutka connection with the city centre.

===By bus===

The cost of the bus from Moscow is approximately the same as the cheapest train ticket (and the latter provides more comfortable travel conditions). You can catch a bus to Voronezh near Moscow Paveletskaya train station. In Voronezh the bus stops near Pyramide (Pamyatnik) and terminates near Voronezh 1 train station.

===By car===

Voronezh is about 500km south of Moscow on the M4 motorway.

==Get around==

The public transport includes buses, marshrutkas and a small quantity of trolley-buses and trams. A funny option is the yellow buses ''Народный маршрут'' (Folk´s route). It costs nothing, and the network covers most of the city, but they are very rare.

==Eat==

You can find an appropriate restaurant or fast-food, but (if you don't eat everything) it requires some time. If you need a supermarket in the center of the city, you may go to the Soviet style Utyuzhok, modern Poisk shopping center or Tsentrtorg supermarket in the midway between Utyuzhok and SERW.
