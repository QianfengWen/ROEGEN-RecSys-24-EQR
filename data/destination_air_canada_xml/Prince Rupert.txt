{{pagebanner|Prince Rupert Banner.jpg}}
'''Prince Rupert''' [http://www.visitprincerupert.com/] is a small port city on the northwest coast of [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]].  The population of 13,000 people is about half First Nations (native Canadian) people.  The Tsimshian Nation is the indigenous First Nations in the Prince Rupert area.  Prince Rupert holds the title of rainiest city in Canada, with about 2500 mm of precipitation annually.  That's more than double the notoriously rainy Vancouver.  Bring good rain gear.

*'''First Nations Carving Shed''' (1-800-667-1994), located just a block from the Museum of Northern British Columbia, features artists and carvers of the region, creating everything from sculpture and totems to jewelry, working with silver, copper, cedarwood and gold.
*'''Kwinitsa Station Railway Museum''', on the west side of the waterfront, tells the story of early Prince Rupert and the role of the railway in its development.

*'''Pacific Mariners Memorial Park''', between the foot of McBride St and the Northland Terminal.  Note the two focal points of the Park: one being the bronze Mariner's statue and Memorial Walls, the other the Shinto Shrine which was built for the "Kazu Maru", a Japanese fishing dingy that drifted across the Pacific Ocean from Prince Rupert's sister-city Owase in Japan.
