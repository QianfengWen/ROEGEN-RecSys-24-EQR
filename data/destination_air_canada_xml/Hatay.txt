'''Hatay''' is a province in southeastern part of [[Mediterranean Turkey]], bordering [[Syria]].

==Regions==

==Cities==
* [[Antakya]], also known as '''Antioch''' {{-}} the provincial capital; a riverside city with a great Mosaic Museum and the hub for sites of early Christianity in the surrounding countryside
* [[Iskenderun]], also known as '''Alexandretta''' {{-}} the biggest city of the province, situated on the shore of Mediterranean Sea, with a pleasant palm-lined waterfront

==Other destinations==

==Understand==
The province, which was then known as '''Sandjak''' (county) '''of Alexandretta''', was under [[France|French]] control as a part of the French Mandate of [[Syria]] between 1920 and 1938. In 1938, it appeared on the maps as the independent '''State of Hatay'''. Following a plebiscite a year later, it joined Turkey as the '''Hatay Province''' in 1939.

It's easy to point out Hatay on maps, even on those showing full continents, as it is where the southern border of Turkey, which follows roughly a straight line in a west-east fashion extends significantly southwards. Situated on the very northeastern corner of the Mediterranean Sea, where northern shores lying on a west-east direction curves into the [[Middle East]]ern shore stretching north to south (traditionally known as the coasts of the ''Levant''), it's possible to find long and sandy beaches popular with the locals in the region, although the traditional centre of the region, [[Antakya|Antakya/Antioch]], is an inland city.

==Talk==
Almost all people in the province can speak [[Turkish_phrasebook|Turkish]], although with a heavy accent in most cases. Also, the Syrian dialect of [[Arabic_phrasebook|Arabic]] is the native tongue for many people in many parts of the province.

==Get in==
===By air===
Domestic flights are available to '''Hatay Airport''' which is located about 25 km away from [[Antakya]]. However, nearest airport with international connections is located in [[Adana]] to the north.

===By train===
The only significant settlement in the province with a railline is [[Iskenderun]], which has several daily train connections with [[Adana]] and [[Mersin]]. Since 2008, trains have been suspended for railtrack improvements between Adana and Iskenderun. For updates, visit Turkish State Railways (''TCDD'') website [http://www.tcdd.gov.tr].

===By car===
The main highway connecting the province to the rest of Turkey to the north is the motorway '''O-53''' (toll-road). There are also secondary highways as well, some of which eventually reaches one of many border posts located on the Turkish-[[Syria]]n border.

<!--This section is for an overview of hotel scene in the province. Please add any individual hotel listing to the city articles - namely Antakya or Iskenderun in this case.

Please do NOT add any hotel listings here.-->

==Stay safe==

==Contact==
The telephone code of the province is '''326''', which should be prefixed with '''0''' when calling from elsewhere in Turkey, or with '''+90''' when calling from outside of Turkey.

==Get out==
With two border posts (one leading to [[Aleppo]], and the other to [[Latakia]]), Hatay is usually a jumping off point for trips into [[Syria]] to south. The neighbouring regions of [[Cilician Plains]] to northwest and [[Southeastern Anatolia]] to northeast also have many cultural similarities with Hatay.
