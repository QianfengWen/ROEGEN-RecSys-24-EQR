'''Ibiza''' or '''Eivissa''' (the official name) is one of the [[Balearic Islands]]. The maximum length of the island by highway is 42 km.

==Cities==

* [[San Antonio (Ibiza)|San Antonio]]
* [[Ibiza Town]]
* [[Santa Eulària des Riu]]
* [[Sant Josep]]

==Other destinations==

* [[Formentera]]- neighboring tranquil and unspoilt island set in some of the cleanest, most turquoise waters of the Mediterranean, and a beautiful boat ride to get there.

==Understand==

Ibiza and [[Formentera]] are also known as the "Islas Pitiusas" (from the Greek word "pitys" meaning pine tree) because of the abundance of pines that cover their landscapes. Ibiza and Formentera are home to about 111,200 inhabitants.

==Talk== 

Though Balearic Catalan (simply "Catalan" in the Autonomy Statute) is the official language of the Balearic Islands, and all sign posts etc. are in Catalan, [[Spanish phrasebook|Castilian (Spanish)]] is the main language of the island, with most natives speaking either English or [[German phrasebook|German]]. English is very widely understood throughout the island, and you can get by with just a basic knowledge of Spanish if you wish to make a slight effort

==Get around==

'''Buses''' -  Ibiza Bus Timetables [http://www.horariodebus.es/]

'''Rentals''' - require extra driving care, as the locals are terrible drivers. Many tourists have been run off the road trying to avoid deadly head-on collisions. New road construction has led to the temporary development of detour roads which are poorly marked and dangerous. During the summer months many tourist drivers under the influence of alcohol, pose a potential threat.

'''Car hire''' - Renting a car on Ibiza is easy as long as you can show your driving license. During the summer months of July and August renting a car can be difficult due to high demand, best to book early. Car hire prices are highly competitive. Ibiza Holidays [http://www.ibizaholidays.com/carhire.asp],[http://www.ibiza-carhire.com/vehicles/Car/ Ibiza Car Hire], [http://www.autostanitibiza.com/ Autos Tanit Ibiza], [http://www.firstrentacar.es/en/ First rent a car Ibiza]

'''Taxis''' - can be used to get around the island and cost €20-30 to travel between cities. NOTE: Don't use the fixed-prices taxis right after you leave the airport. Instead queue to use one of the licensed taxis - prices will be around 50% lower.

'''Boats''' - Sailing is also a very popular way to view the island of Ibiza as the coastline has many beautiful hidden caves and secluded bays worth visiting. If you want to visit Formentera you will either have to buy a boat ticket or acquire a boat charter or yacht rental. There are a few places where you can rent a boat or a yacht for a few days, however, many require a boat license or you can hire a local Skipper, who will guide you to the best spots by boat. 

'''Walking''' - the cities are small enough not to require any mechanical locomotion

'''Jet Ski''' - Another way to visit the most popular beaches is to hire a jet ski or take a jet ski tour to Es Vedra Island.

The beautiful beach that settles just outside the main hub of town. Many young people will be seen flocking to pay for daily rentals on beach chairs, and hawkers scan the beach looking for young adults to attend their club of choice.

==Do==

Explore some of the traditional countryside of this beautiful island that few people take the time to enjoy.

Take a boat or go parasailing.

Learn Spanish in some of the language schools around the island. Some of them are specialised on teaching Spanish as a foreign language. Most of them are located in Ibiza town, where you also will be able to make use of your knowledge the best way and it also will be easier to stay in hostels near a school.

Explore the wharf side festival. Hundreds of locals flock to the carnival-style stands for fresh foods, enticing smells, and quality made trinkets.

During the local beach front festivals, merchants offer a wide array of goods. Pictured above is a fragrant batch of healthful herbs, for making teas or incense.

The numerous stalls are alive with colors and patterns. Above are recognizable wooden figures, hand crafted from the skilled merchants.

In addition to incredible tastes and smells, there is a strong visual aspect to the festivals. A snake charmer is seen leading a small parade through the different stands at the glee and fright of small children everywhere.

===Getting married===
The combination of cheap flights from the UK and a large English speaking local population that migrated to the island in the 1960s and 1970s means that Ibiza is now becoming a very attractive proposition for those couples looking for an alternative location to host their wedding.

Don't forget to try two local specialities: ''ensaimada'', a sort of flat, soft pastry coil - what a Danish pastry would be if it was more like a doughnut - and ''flao'', a sweet cheese and mint flan. Most pastelerias and many bars sell ''ensaimada'' - ''flao'' is a bit more difficult to track down.

There is also plenty of fast food restaurants/outlets in San Antonio and Ibiza Town if you're after something quick to eat on the go.

==Drink==

{{movelistings}}

Ibiza is famous for its nightlife. During the day most tourists are soaking up rays at one of the gorgeous beaches or sleeping off the past night's drinks. Bars do not get busy in Ibiza town or San Antonio until early evening, about 7PM.

Nearly every bar, particularly in the busier summer months, has "drink specials" that will be advertised on the street outside the bar. These are good options to save some cash in a notoriously expensive destination. Usually this will be a beer and a shot for €5, but the terms vary depending on the area, the time of night, and the bar.

The West End, near San Antonio center, is a long, wide street packed with bars and revelers. The party shuts down at around 3 or 4AM here.

Ibiza is most known for its large clubs. Examples are Privilege, Space, Pacha, Eden, Amnesia, and Es Paradis. Most of these clubs have hefty entry fees and the drinks will be extremely expensive. Plan on paying €30-€55 for admission (unless you are able to find a special deal from one of the hawkers on the street) and drinks from €7 (beer; smaller venues) to €20 (cocktails; bigger venues/events).

Ibiza clubs attract some of the best DJ's in the world who play a weekly 'residency' on a particular night. Ibiza's Opening Parties take place over a course of a few weeks at the end of May to the beginning of June. Closing Parties take place at the end of September through the second week of October. Most Ibiza clubs then close for the winter, until reopening the following year.


* '''Pacha''', [http://www.pacha.com/]. The island's most expensive, and arguably best club - plan on €50 entry and €12 for a beer though!  Over recent years, Pacha has increasingly devoted a large proportion of its floorspace to VIP tables at the expense of areas for 'regular' club-goers.  If the VIP experience is your thing, Pacha will be your #1 choice on the island, but expect your credit card to glow red-hot.  

* '''Amnesia'''[http://www.amnesia.es/]. One of Ibiza's most popular superclubs. Located directly in between Ibiza Town and San Antonio, their intimate main room and enormous terrace play home to Cream parties on Thursday nights; past residents have included Paul Van Dyk, Deadmau5, and Above & Beyond.

* '''DC10''' This little (comparatively) venue at the far end of Ibiza Airport's runway reopened fully in 2010 for the first time in 2 years following various closures and bans. Plays mostly underground dance music and techno, with its famous Circoloco parties taking place every Monday during the season.

* '''Jockey Club''' and "Malibu" (both on Salinas beach) - perfect places to drink and watch the beautiful people lying in the sun while DJs spin deep house and chill out tunes, one of the residents Nati Holland plays every saturday afternoon during the summer season [http://www.djnatiholland.com/.]

When it comes to choosing a place to stay on Ibiza, it really depends on what type of vacation experience you are after. Ibiza offers everything from basic hostel-style un-modernized accommodation to five star mega-bling, such as the Ibiza Grand Hotel in Ibiza Town.  Unless you enjoy surrounding yourself with mainly large groups of rowdy drunks who rarely leave their comforts in "San An", then avoid the central 'West End' bar strip of San Antonio, although its peripheries are far classier, offering sunset viewing at the hugely popular 'sunset strip', including Cafe Mambo for the Pacha pre-parties, the legendary Cafe Del Mar next door, plus a selection of other bayfront bars. If you just want to relax and chill, and visit nice unspoilt beaches, then it's better to spend a little more on a nice villa (and, of course, rent a car.) 

The resort of Playa D'en Bossa has recently witnessed something of a reinvention, with upmarket beach bar/restaurants such as 'Nassau' and 'Tides' adding to a market that was once monopolised by the now rather passe 'Blue Marlin' in Cala Jondal.  The resort has a wide range of hotels, with its proximity to Ibiza Town and the Airport being an advantage (although Ibiza is a small Island with a decent road network.)

If you prefer a hotel, you have plenty to choose from.  There are more than 300 licensed accommodation possibilities on Ibiza, that cover the entire budget range, from hostels to exclusive and intimate rural hotels, and most are represented with web pages online and in numerous travel guides, but do not go there in August without a reservation.  You could wind up on the street or on the beach (also illegal). Furnished Room Rentals are also very popular.
