'''Changsha''' (长沙; ''Chángshā'') is the capital of [[Hunan]] Province.

==Understand==
In the first millenium BC, it was an urban centre in the state of Chu. In the centuries following, Changsha was often in a state of contention, sometimes incorporated into Han China proper, and at other times heading an independent state. Mao Zedong started his political career here, as a newly-arrived country boy from the nearby village of Shaoshancong.  During World War II, it was the first major city that was successfully defended by the Chinese from the Japanese invasion. The Xiangjiang river runs through Changsha.

==Get in==

===By air===
Huanghua International Airport is the major airport for those seeking to visit Changsha. A 45 minutes drive on the expressway will take you to the city center. Airport buses operate 06:00-22:00 from downtown to the airport and cost &yen;16.5. The bus leaves from the CAAC Aviation Hotel on Wuyi Avenue  a block west of the central train station. Alternatively for ¥20, take the maglev which has two stops, the terminus being South Railway Station and is connected to Metro Line 2. (The maglev is the second one in China and first using all-domestic technology.)

Traveling from the airport will allow for some window viewing of the relatively wealthy countryside surrounding the city. Although annual floods do sizable property damage, the overflowing of the rivers help irrigate the evergreen and enormous rice paddies.

Warning: do not use the taxi drivers that hang around the terminal trying to catch tourists as they exit customs. At best, you'll end up with an overpriced taxi fare; at worst you'll end up in hospital. Drivers will insist you pay more than what you initially negotiate, holding your luggage and threatening violence until you hand over the cash. This can happen on a busy street in broad daylight, somehow nearby pedestrians and security guards turn a blind eye.

===By train===
Changsha Railway Station is in the heart of the city. There are direct train connections from many cities or indirect ones using a connecting train. From Beijing it is about 14 hours on a Z Train and 5 hours on a G train.

South Railway Station (of the Wuhan-Guangzhou High Speed Rail) is southeast of downtown, about 25-30 minutes from the city core.  From Guangzhou South it is about 2.5 hours on the high speed train, or a minimum of 8 hours on the much cheaper normal trains (a little over one quarter of the price). Duration is about 4.5 hours for trains from Shanghai and about 3 hours from Shenzhen.

===By Bus===

Changsha is connected by long distance buses to many cities.  There are five bus stations:  North, South, East, West, and the bus station near the train station

==Get around==
===By taxi===
Ubiquitous taxis flood the city streets, willing to transport you just up the street or to the other side of town. The meters start at &yen;8.  Each taxi company is slightly different.  Night is more expensive than day.  It is always easiest if you have the address you want to go to written in Chinese.

===Bus===
If you want to spend like a native or just want to experience the sensation of being sandwiched between natives, then hop on a bus for &yen;2 and feel the thrill of speeding down the bumpy roads with barely any breathing room. Buses with air-con (hot or cold) cost 2 &yen;2 and buses without cost 1 &yen;2

Try the 旅3  Bus!  It does a circle around the city stopping at many of the tourist destinations including:  Tianxin Pavilion 天心阁 (tianxinge)， Changsha bamboo museum 长沙简牍博物馆 (changsha jiandu bowuguan), the southern part of walking street Nanmenkou 长郡中学 （changjun zhongxue), the river front 长沙轮渡 （Changsha lundu), snack street 坡子街 （pozi jie), Martyrs Park South Gate 烈士公园南门 （lieshi gongyuan nanmen), before returning to the train station.

Google Maps and Baidu Maps can help you decide which bus to take!

===By metro===
Changsha is served by two metro lines (as of Jul 2016). Line 1 runs north-south and Line 2 runs east-west, the latter serving both railway stations and Wangchengpo (West Bus Station). Network maps on the platforms show an additional four lines (and extensions) which are set to open in coming years.

==Eat==
When eating in Changsha there is nothing better than a plate of stinky tofu (chou dofu) or soo-yo-bing bought right off the street. If you have just arrived, be wary of eating from street vendors. Although the inviting aroma of food cooking may be too tempting to resist, you better have a strong stomach if you do not want to get an upset one.

Food in Changsha is famously described as ''xiang cai''. As Xiangjiang is the major river that borders the city to the west, Xiang denotes not only the flavor and taste of the food but also of the land. Changsha, like Szechuan is known for spicy food, but without the additional ''ma'', numbing affect of certain spices and pepper. In summer, oversized metal mixing bowls filled with crayfish seasoned with plenty of chili and spices, take the stage atop countless tabletops. Restaurants get so busy and overcrowded that tables, chairs along with diners spill into the busy streets.

For international cuisine, four and five star restaurants have reputable chefs although for a visitor, the inifite array of dishes native to or with a Hunan flair are sure to please even the most discriminating palate.

Head straight to Snake Alley for the best ''point-and-eat'' in the city for merely pennies.

==Drink==
'''Jiefang West Road''' (解放西路; ''Jiefangxilu'') has a few Chinese clubs along this road, including SoHo, the ubiqiutous Chinese chain. Drinks tend to be expensive, the music loud, and clubs crowded. It's just off the main walking street so it is in quite a handy location.

'''Taiping Street''' (太平街; ''Taipingjie'') is a newly refurbished area, with traditional/tacky facades has a few smaller bars, some with live music. It is just off Jiefang West Road towards the river.  This is a touristy shopping street and many prices are on par with the West. Bargaining is impossible here. Even those who speak little English know how to say ''no bargains''. But the shops are worth seeing to get an idea of what is available.
