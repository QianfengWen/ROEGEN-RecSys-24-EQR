==Get around==

===Buses===

There is an extensive network of buses running around Pereira connecting most parts of the city. Costs are around 2,100 COP (2019). It runs along the main avenues, including numerous nearby neighborhoods (barrios) and surrounding barrios. Use caution when visiting lower-income barrios (as you should in any other city). Types of buses range from large buses to smaller vans, and vintage Willy Jeeps are also available for side trips to outlying areas including local mountains and valley floors (prices vary depending on destination but generally are very cheap).

===Megabus===

Inaugurated in 2006, this is Pereira's version of bus systems developed in [[Curitiba]] - Brazil and [[Ottawa]] - Canada, later adopted in Bogotá's Transmilenio: a mass transport system with exclusive lanes for large buses and enclosed stations. Buses are painted green, very comfortable, inexpensive, clean and fast. Buses run from 4:30AM to 11:35PM. You need to get a ''Megatarjeta'' to access, available at the stations at a cost of COP 4,400 which are your credit good for 3 trips. Fare COP 2,000 [http://www.megabus.gov.co/].

===Taxis===

Taxis are relatively cheap but make sure the meter is on. Some taxi drivers are dishonest and try to take advantage of foreigners, for example, if you stop along your route they will charge you an additional fare. 
Most cabs have meters but some don't, so ask for cost in advance. It's possible to negotiate as well. 

Standard minimun daytime fare (For the year 2019) is 4,300 COP and rises to 5,100 COP after 7PM and on Sundays and holidays. There is a surcharge of 2,500 COP to/from the airport. 
When you board the cab the meter will start at 1,250 COP and then adds 115 COP for every 80 meters driven (or 70 seconds while idle). One can also hire a taxi by the hour; the fare is $17,000 COP.

===Car Rental===

There are 3 companies with offices at the airport: Sixt, Localiza and Avis. There is also a city office for Localiza at Avenida 30 de Agosto.

There are a few things to see. This is a nice city, famous throughout the area for commerce and shopping.

In what Colombians call 'winter' season it rains often (Almost daily during this season, but not for too long), the temperature rarely drops below 15 °C. You can find dry and hot days on 'summer' season, but overall comfortable (Max 32°C). The air is usually temperate, good temperature, and can be balmy depending on which part of city you're visiting. 

Pereira is also famous for being one of only a few cities with a number of separate micro-climates in world, depending on which elevation, side of the hill and barrio you're in. For example, it's possible in just 10 minutes to go from a spot that's cool and foggy to one that is warm and balmy (like La Olympic Villa).

There is a beautiful park close to downtown called 'Olaya Herrera' on a mount overlooking the city and beautiful coffee rich valleys down below. The view is 360 degrees, and to east, north and south are views of city that's nestled up against the western side of central Cordillera (Colombia, in the western part of country, is basically divided into sections by three large, wide mountain ranges) and to west are views of the valleys, rivers and coffee plantations down below which contain the famous cities of Santa Rosa de Cabal and La Virginia.

==Eat==

The traditional food comes from Antioquia, the region to northwest and famous for the city of Medellin. Lunch-time meals usually consist of a soup made from plantain (a variety of green bananas), followed by a plate of rice and selection of fried pork, beef, or chicken, with small cabbage salad in vinegar dressing, a natural juice drink made from mango, or if you are adventurous, try one of native fruit flavors, they are delicious but hard to pronounce, this will usually be followed by a coffee. Sometimes, you might be offered a dessert called mazamorra, which is corn and milk with local sugar, called 'panela'. They also use panella and water in making coffee, but don't recommend it, as the taste is very sweet, actually coffee served here is exceptionally sweet and unless you are a fan of sugary tasting coffee, ask for coffee made from plain water. 

If you're visiting the 'Los Nevados' Natural Park, ask for 'aguapanela con queso' while going there. It's a hot beverage made of sugar cane served with cheese. Also look for cheese ice cream, chorizos from Santa Rosa and obleas.

==Stay safe==

Be careful in some parts of Cuba and Villa Santana. They are colorful and lively but somewhat risky.

The water quality here is excellent (Pereira water is on the top 20 of best quality drinking waters in the world). It is very pure also it is possible to drink straight from the tap here (but not in all parts of Colombia is this true), so no need to purchase bottled water and taste is great!

==Get out==

* '''Hotsprings'''  The region is famous in Colombia for it's hot water springs and resorts such as 'Hotspring of Santa Rosa de Cabal' . Each contains not only a hot pool where the public gather to soak and relax, but many levels of hotel accommodation. Prices are approx. 30,000 Colombian pesos per day, and all stay open till midnight. The 'Termales del Santa Rosa' lower and upper locations, as does the hot springs at 'Termales del Nevado'. At both locales, the upper pools are closer to water source and so have hotter water, but water temperature also fluctuates depending on which season it is, winter or summer. Santa Rosa costs 23.000 COP in low season and 38.000 COP in high season, on sundays and on holidays (January 2017). There are buses that go there, the last one back leaves at 7 pm. 

* Worth seeing is the 'Termales del Santa Rosa' Hotel, it is a four star hotel and very nice if you can afford the 150,000 pesos/night (per person), US$75, however, includes is all meals and entry fees to pools, as well as use of private, exclusive wading pools. Also, both sites at Santa Rosa have incredible, breathtaking waterfalls that are lit with multi-colored lights, visiting at night is best, or if you have time, stay all day as price of entry is for all day!

*If time permits, the "Termales San Vicente" is set amidst a cloud forest & thermal water rivers. It's much further than the other thermals, but much more in nature and has amazing thermal rivers and birds. The price is 45.000 COP (January 2017) <do url="http://www.colombiaecotravel.com/portfolio/termales-san-vicente-santa-rosa-de-cabal/"></do>
