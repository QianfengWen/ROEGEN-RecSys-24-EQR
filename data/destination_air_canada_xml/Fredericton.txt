'''Fredericton''' [http://www.fredericton.ca/]
is the capital of [[New Brunswick]], [[Canada]]. It is located along the St. John River. Fredericton is the cultural, artistic and educational centre of the province. Fredericton boasts two universities - the University of New Brunswick and the liberal arts focused St. Thomas University. Fredericton is also home to cultural institutions such as the Beaverbrook Art Gallery, the York-Sunbury Museum and the Playhouse, the latter which serves as a venue for local talent/writers. As well, adding to the city's rich cultural milieu, Fredericton is home to the annual Harvest and Jazz and Blues Festival every fall which attracts regional and international jazz and blues artists. The city also contains a growing IT and commercial sector. The city boasts the highest percentage of residents with a post-secondary education in the province and one of the highest per capita incomes.

The population of City of Fredericton is 56,224 (per 2011 census), although the population varies due to the influx of students during the school year which is not counted in official censuses. The City of Fredericton comprises Fredericton proper, and the boroughs of Silverwood, Nashwaaksis, Devon, Barker's Point and Marysville which were incorporated into the city in 1973.

The city is situated in the west-central portion of the province and, along with [[Moncton]] and [[Saint John]], is one of the main urban centres in [[New Brunswick]]. The St. John River flows in a west-east direction, bisecting the city and providing the dominant natural feature for the municipality.

==Get around==

===By foot===

The downtown core and surrounding areas (extending to the west as far as the Delta hotel and to the east as far as the Princess Margaret Bridge is easily accessible by foot. The terrain is flat and concrete sidewalks are a standard feature of most streets and neighbourhoods. Fredericton features a robust walking trail system [http://www.fredericton.ca/en/recleisure/trailinformation.asp detailed here]. Features include a paved walking trail along both edges of the Saint John river, a walking bridge connecting both trails and a leisure gravel network within Odell Park.

===By Bike===

Fredericton benefits from a large network of predominantly well - signed, well - maintained trails, which are well suited to bicycles and other active modes of transportation. Pathways link the city's downtown with most surrounding and suburban areas, including some less common attractions. Many of the paths are attractions unto themselves as well. 

===By car===

Venturing outside of the downtown core is suited best by car. Roads are well maintained and signed and allow access to all surrounding areas. The principle business district is uptown, to the south of the downtown core. Uptown is easily navigated by going up the hill. Parking in most places outside of the downtown core is free. Rental cars are available at the airport and throughout the city.

===By bus===
<listing name="Fredericton Transit" alt="" directions="" address="" phone="+1 (506)460-2200" email="" fax="" url="https://www.fredericton.ca/en/transit" hours="" price="">The majority of the city is covered by bus service. While intervals are long, a well-timed ride can be economical for travel across the city. Note that service is not available on Sundays - keep a taxi company dispatch number handy if you need to go somewhere far afield on this day of the week.</listing>

===By taxi===

Taxi rides vary from about $6 around the downtown core to upwards of $40 for one-way trips to the outer boroughs. It is not typical for riders to wave down cabs in the city, but can be done. Calling the taxi company landline is typical and waits are usually less than 5 minutes within the downtown core during evening hours (except when bars close around 1am Friday and Saturday). Peer to peer transportation companies such as Lyft and Uber do not operate in Fredericton (as of July 2016).
