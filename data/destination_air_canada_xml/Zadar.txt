'''Zadar''' ([[Italian]]: ''Zara'') is a city located in northern [[Dalmatia]], [[Croatia]].

==Get in==

There is a bus/train station within walking distance from the Old Town, and an airport outside of the city.

===By plane===

Airport buses run to the central bus station/train station and the Old Town, from Zadar airport terminal. They depart in conjunction with arriving flights, see [http://www.zadar-airport.hr/en/how-to-reach-us airport bus schedule] for details, and therefore they will run more frequently during weekdays than weekends, as more flights are arriving at the airport. The buses are clean, comfortable and efficient, costs 25 kuna, and there are no baggage fees. The journey takes 20-25 minutes.

Taxis are always available at airport. Price to old town is approximately 150 kuna. [http://www.hbtransfer.com/ See taxi prices] Cheaper alternative is getting an Uber.

===By bus===

The Zadar bus terminal is located at the intersection of Ulica Ante Starčevića and Ulica kralja Tvrtka (lat/long 44.106185,15.241016), right next to the train station.

Frequent buses run to and from [[Zagreb]] (3h 30 min), [[Rijeka]] (change for [[Trieste]] in [[Italy]]), [[Pula]], [[Sibenik]], [[Split]] and on to [[Dubrovnik]]. About half the buses for Zagreb pass through the stunning [[Plitvice National Park]]. There is an [http://www.autobusni-kolodvor.com/en/terminal.aspx?k=8&d=191 online timetable] for the bus station (☎ +385 23 211555, ☎ +385 23 315 940). If you can't find a suitable bus there, search the [http://www.akz.hr/default.aspx?id=260 online timetable] maintained by the [http://www.akz.hr/ bus station in Zagreb] ([http://www.akz.hr/default.aspx?id=265 pay per minute numbers] ☎ 060 313 333, ☎ +385 1 6112 789), as not all companies have been represented on both sites.

Reservations by phone are possible with some operators.

For navigation through city bus stations, overview parking locations and taxi stations, download free Android or iOS application CityBus Zadar on Google Play Store and App Store. You can find out more on [http://citybus.zadar.io official website].

To get from the inter-city bus station (and train station) into the center of Zadar, or the old town, a local bus stop is located on the main road just outside the station. Bus (costs 10 Kuna) number 2 or 4 will take you directly there, the journey is only five minutes. Taxis (costs 20-40 Kuna, ask first) will also be waiting, however, be advised they have a reputation for ripping off tourists, charging much more than the officially posted rate (as much as five times higher). Do the world a favor and catch public transport or walk - walking will take you about 10-20 minutes dependent upon your location in the Old Town.

===By train===

The train station is located at the intersection of Ulica Ante Starčevića and Ulica Ante Starčevića (lat/long 44.106647,15.241961), right next to the inter-city bus station.

A few slow trains a day run to [[Knin]] and connect into trains for [[Zagreb]] (5,5 hours or 8,5 with overnight trains) and [[Split]] (3.5 hr). Virtually nobody uses this train to get to these cities. Train to Knin is one carriage long with no A/C and can be quite uncomfortable, however the scenery is beautiful and will leave you in wonder at the numerous stations which appear to be in the middle of nowhere. Check the [http://www.hzpp.hr/Default.aspx?sec=282 online timetable] at [http://www.hzpp.hr/ HŽ Putnički prijevoz] (2013-06-09, searching for routes only works in the Croatian language version of the site, not the English).

===By boat===
* '''Jadrolinja''' [http://www.jadrolinija.hr/default.aspx?lang=2] ferry company run every few days up and down the coast between [[Dubrovnik]] and [[Rijeka]], stopping off at ports (including Zadar) and islands on the way. They also run almost daily ferries in summer to and from [[Ancona]] in [[Italy]].

* '''Local boats''', Zadar is also a hub for local ferries in Northern [[Dalmatia]]. Services run to and from [[Olib]], [[Mali Losinj]], [[Ugljan]], [[Dugi Otok]], [[Premuda]] and others. 

Note that many boats now arrive and depart from the "new" ferry terminal, around 5kms from the old town. A public bus is available, inquire at the Jadrolinja office in the old town or check on RAFT Croatia website. Taxi fare was quoted at around 80 Kuna (tourist prices). Uber is a great alternative to taxies.

===By car===

===By Cruise Ship===

Zadar is a stop on lots of Adriatic and Med cruises. The ships normally dock at the "new" ferry port south of the town center, and not particularly walking distance to the center. A shuttle will normally be offered to the Old Town by your cruise line, often for a fee, and will take around 15mins.

Another option is to take a public bus.  Take bus #9 from a stop near the cruise terminal, and transfer to bus #2 or bus #4 to get to Old Town.  In May 2016, the cost was 10 kunas.

==Get around==
[[Image:Zadar-st-mary.jpg|thumb|Zadar, the church of St. Mary near the Roman Forum]]
The Old Town is easy enough to get around on foot. To reach the bus/train stations you can walk or catch one of the frequent local buses (bus 2 or 4 will take you there from the Old Town).

Buses in Zadar are relatively new and well maintained, and you will be able to catch a bus to any part of the city from the main hub in the city called Mala Pošta (Little Post Office); ask any local where this is and they can direct you to it. A bus ticket in one direction costs 10 Kuna (cca. US$1.75) while a two way ticket costs 16 Kuna (cca. US$2.80). However, two way tickets are only available for purchase at newspaper stands, although they are easy to find. One way tickets are available for purchase upon entering any bus. Buses are run by [http://www.liburnija-zadar.hr/ Liburnija]; an online timetable is available.

Be advised that bus services cease just after midnight during the summer, so if you plan to get back to a hotel that isn't close to the city center after that time, you might have to walk or catch a taxi. Do not attempt to board a bus without a ticket, without purchasing a ticket or avoiding stamping a bus ticket. Bus drivers in Zadar are notoriously militant about enforcing payment, and you could get into trouble.

Taxis - a trip of up to 5 kilometers (enough to get almost anywhere within the city) may cost up to 80 Kunas, as the taxi drivers have a habit of overcharging tourists. Inquire first, as it will be almost impossible to find a taxi for the advertised price of 20-40 Kunas (circa US$3.5-7). Ask before you get in the cab - there should be a printed price list, although many drivers will not obey this list. There are taxis waiting on both sides of the bridge in the Old Town, and around the bus/train stations.

==Do==

===Apartments===

The old town lacks hotels, but has many apartments. These can be very good. The bars can stay open until early in the morning and the noise can carry in the small streets, so it is worth trying to identify where the largest collection of bars is.

==Get out==
* Rent a boat and explore surrounding islands, especially [[Kornati Islands National Park]] with its 150 islands, high cliffs and salt water lake. Sharun Beach, elected one of 50 most beautiful beaches in the world - it is located on far north end of island called Dugi Otok].  

* Visit the stunning waterfalls and lakes of the [[Plitvice National Park]] (about 2 hours drive, on the way to [[Zagreb]]).

* Explore the breathtaking scenery and swim close to the waterfalls in [[Krka National Park]] (about 1 hours drive, near [[Sibenik]]).

* Party on the beach [[Zrće]], close to [[Novalja]], which has several big night clubs. It is known as ''The Croatian Ibiza''.

* Visit other parts of [[Northern Dalmatia]]; for example nearby historic village [[Nin]], island [[Vir]], island [[Pag]] with the towns [[Pag (town)|Pag]] and [[Novalja]].

* Travel north along the scenic coast, towards [[Rijeka]] (about 3 hours drive) and [[Trieste]] ([[Italy]], about 4 hours drive).

* Travel south along the scenic coast, towards [[Šibenik]] (about 1 hours drive) and [[Split]] (about 2.5 hours drive).

* Travel north inland, towards [[Karlovac]] (about 2 hours drive) and [[Zagreb]] (about 3 hours drive).

* It is possible to join organized or personalized tours from [[Zadar]] either by booking on site lat="44.115118" long="15.229047", or online via http://www.croatica.eu/ or http://www.getyourguide.com

*Travel south to villages of Šibenik and Bibinje.

*Travel north along the cost to villages of Nin and Zaton to find most beautiful sandy beaches, but be conscious, they tend to be crowded in high season.

*For a half-day outing from Zadar, consider taking a boat across the water to the opposite island of Ugljan. Turn right at the ferry port for the town of Preko; turn left for the village of Kali (20 minutes of gentle walking), and beyond for the fishing village of Kukljica (another ten minutes). Locals suggest the best beaches are on the neighbouring island of Pašman, which is linked by a bridge. Buses to Pašman and elsewhere meet the ferry at Preko's ferry port. 

*Take a yellow submarine off the shore of the city for a few minutes (around 40-50, for 80 kuna). Don't expect to see many colourful fish, but it is an enjoyable, short experience.
