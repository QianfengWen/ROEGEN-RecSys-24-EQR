The population of Takamatsu is approximately 420,000 people. The city developed as a port town and is at one of the primary entry points to Shikoku. It is therefore known as the "Gateway to Shikoku". In recent years, it has also come to be known as the "Udon Kingdom".

==Get in==
===By plane===
'''[http://www.takamatsu-airport.com/en/ Takamatsu Airport]''' (高松空港) ({{IATA|TAK}}) is 15km south of the city center. Flights operate to/from [[Tokyo]], [[Taipei]], [[Naha]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Seoul]], and [[Shanghai]]. Buses connect the Takamatsu Airport and Takamatsu Station roughly twice per hour (40 minutes, ¥740).

[[Kansai International Airport]] ({{IATA|KIX}}) has much more options. [http://www.kate.co.jp/en/timetable/detail/TM Direct buses] operate between the airport and Takamatsu. (3.5 hours, ¥5,150, 6 times per day). 

===By train===

'''Marine Liner''' (マリンライナー) trains operate between [[Okayama]] Station on the main Japanese island of [[Honshu]] and Takamatsu Station. Trains run twice per hour in each direction (55 minutes, ¥1,470, free with JR Rail Pass). Because the Marine Liner is classified as a 'rapid' (快速 ''kaisoku'') train, the [[Seishun 18 Ticket]] is valid on this train. First Class Green car seating is available and the view across the [[Seto Inland Sea]] is great from the front of the train. 

A limited express train (特急 ''tokkyū'') called the Uzushio (うずしお) runs hourly to Takamatsu from [[Tokushima]] (One hour, ¥3,070). A few Uzushio trains run between Takamatsu and Okayama on the exact same route as the Marine Liner; you have the option of using those trains if you have a Japan Rail Pass, but generally you should use the cheaper and more frequent Marine Liner.

Okayama Station is a major station for the Shinkansen trains. Connections are available at Okayama to/from all major cities in Japan including [[Hiroshima]] (1h40), [[Osaka]] (2h), and [[Tokyo]] (4.5h).

===By bus===
There are several options to travel by bus to/from [[Honshu]], particularly the [[Kansai]] region. Buses can be booked online.

==Get around==

===By foot===
Takamatsu is a fairly walkable city and the downtown is pretty easy to navigate on foot.

===By bicycle===
Bicycling is an extremely popular method of transportation. The city is extremely bicycle-friendly.

There are 7 '''[http://www.city.takamatsu.kagawa.jp/english/living-infomation/traffic/rental-bicycles.html Rent-a-Cycle Ports]''' around the city, including one underground at Takamatsu Station. Prices are ¥200 per 24-hour period, up to a maximum of 72 hours, and you are allowed to keep the bicycle overnight. Before the first rental, you will need to fill out a short form and show identification.

===Train===
'''[http://www.kotoden.co.jp/publichtm/kotoden/eg/index.html Kotoden]''' (琴電), officially known as the '''Takamatsu-Kotohira Electric Railroad''', is also a viable means of getting around parts of downtown Takamatsu. In particular, the Kotoden is convenient for going between Ritsurin Park, Kawaramachi, and the Takamatsu Station/Castle area.

JR lines, used more for inter-city travel, don't run terribly often and are not very well-suited for getting around town, particularly the city center.

It is full of intriguing items and spectacular views; it is likely to cause even those who have lived in Japan long-term to have a "Wow, I'm really in Japan!" moment. Although it is not one of the official [[Japan's Top 3|top three gardens]] of Japan, it is undoubtedly one of Japan's most impressive gardens, and it benefits from generally being less crowded than its counterparts which are members of the illustrious top 3. Some of the garden's highlights include the ''Engetsu-kyo'' Bridge (primary symbol of the park), the ''Okedoi-no-Taki'' Waterfall, the 'Red Wall of Rocks', a lotus pond, a large number of Japanese pine trees including the turle+crane rock, as well as other impressive sights. The park also contains three tea houses, a restaurant, and a folk craft museum. You can experience tea ceremony ''lite'' at the tea houses for small additional fee.

Takamatsu has several long arcade-style shopping streets, called ''shotengai'' (商店街), giving the city's shopping a more traditional feel. You'll find shops of all sorts on these streets, much as you would at a mall, as well as lots of udon shops. They are concentrated in the portion of the city between Takamatsu Station and Kawaramachi. By name, they are:
* Hyōgo-machi (兵庫町)
* Katahara-machi (片原町)
* Marugame-machi (丸亀町)
* Lion Avenue (ライオン通 ''Raion-dōri'')
* South Shinmachi (南新町 ''Minami-shinmachi'')
* Tokiwa-gai (常磐街)
* Tamachi (田町)

==Eat==
[[Image:Sanuki udon.jpg|thumb|350px|''Kake udon'']]

===Udon===
Takamatsu is extremely well-known throughout Japan for its '''udon noodles''', one of the three major types of Japanese noodle dishes. Udon noodles are distinctive in that they are white, fairly thick, and chewy. Despite udon being widespread in Japan, Takamatsu does it better and cheaper than anywhere else in the country. There are literally hundreds of udon shops within the city limits. Because local foods are often a driving force in Japanese tourism, many people flock to the city for the udon, often doing "chain-eating" tours around the city to famous shops.

Udon made in Takamatsu and the [[Kagawa]] perfecture is sometimes refered to as  '''Sanuki udon'''. 'Sanuki' was the historical name of Kagawa. While this can be considered a regional specialty of Kagawa, the Sanuki variety is so widely-loved throughout Japan that it is often thought of as the 'normal' type, and is what most people imagine when they hear the word 'udon'. 

The average Takamatsu udon shop has a variety of udon dishes available. Ask locals about good udon shops since they are sure to know some. Udon is cheap, and it's a simple but tasty item that is easy to eat even for those who don't especially take to Japanese food, so travelers should make an effort to at udon ''at least'' once while in Takamatsu. Some of the standard types are listed below.

* ''Kake udon'' - (Hot) The most basic variety. The noodles come in a hot dashi and soy-flavored broth and will likely have sliced onions thrown in. Some places may also add a slice of kamaboko (fish sausage) as well. You're likely to have a pinch of ginger added to the broth.
* ''Kitsune udon'' - (Hot) Like ''kake udon'', but with a large slab of fried tofu in the bowl.
* ''Tempura udon'' - (Hot) Also like ''kake udon'', but with a some tempura thrown in for good measure. Typically the tempura will be shrimp plus a vegetable or two, however at the cheapest places the tempura will be ''kaki-age'', a vegetable-shrimp patty.
* ''Zaru udon'' - (Cold) Cold noodles come on a wooden tray. From there, you pick them up, dip them into a soy-based broth that comes with the dish, and then eat.
* ''Kama'age udon'' - (Hot) Identical to zaru udon in manner of eating, however noodles come hot instead of cold. As far as taste is concerned, it's quite similar to ''kake udon''.

There are many more types - different toppings (raw egg, for example) lead to different names. It's rare for a typical bowl of udon to exceed ¥1,000, and not uncommon for the simpler types to hover around ¥400. ¥100 bowls are even available at some places. Feel free to ask locals about good udon shops - they are sure to know some.
