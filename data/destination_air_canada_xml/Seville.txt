Seville is one of the hosting cities for one of the biggest events in soccer—the UEFA Euro 2020. See more information [[Euro 2020|'''here''']].}}</center>

'''Seville''' ([[Spanish phrasebook|Spanish]]: ''Sevilla'') [http://www.turismosevilla.org/ing-index.html] is the capital of [[Andalucia]] and the cultural and financial centre of southern [[Spain]]. A city of just over 700,000 inhabitants (1.6 million in the metropolitan area, making it Spain's 4th largest city), Seville is Andalucia's top destination, with much to offer the traveler.

The city is situated on the banks of the smooth, slow Guadalquivir River, which divides the city into two halves: ''Sevilla'' and ''Triana''. The Guadalquivir (known as ''Baetis'' by the Romans and as ''Betik / al-Wādī al-Kabīr'' by the Arabs) has had a major impact in the history of the city. The location of  Seville is roughly coincident with the point where the Guadalquivir stops being useful for navigation. It is at this point that the cereal producing region of the Guadalquivir Valley starts, and Seville has acted as a sea-port for commerce of agricultural goods produced farther west. Intense trade existed in the area from Roman times, continued under Muslim rule, and exploded as Seville monopolized the new trade with the Americas. As the monopoly was broken and [[Cádiz]] largely took Seville's place, the city entered a period of relative decline.

In the 19th century Seville gained a reputation for its architecture and culture and was a stop along the Romantic "Grand Tour" of Europe. Seville has built on its tourism industry since, playing host to the International Exposition in 1992, which spurred the construction of a new airport, a new train station, a bullet train link to Madrid, new bridges and improvements to the main boulevards. Tourist facilities are top-notch and the city is buzzing with festivals, color and a thriving nightlife scene.

==Get in==

===By plane===

'''Sevilla International Airport''' ({{IATA|SVQ}}) is located about 25 minutes drive from the city center.

A bus service "Especial Aeropuerto (EA)" [http://www.tussam.es/index.php?id=432] runs about every 30 minutes from just outside the "Arrivals" hall during most of the day (though with longer gaps from 1PM-4PM) and costs €4 (€6 for a same day return) and takes 20-30 minutes. Taxis are always available next to the bus stop and run on a fixed fare to Seville center, €21.90 during the day and €24.41 after 10PM and on weekends/holidays.  For the fixed airport fare taxi drivers turn off the meter. Much controversy has been stirred by some taxi drivers trying to overcharge tourists, so be careful to pay no more than this if you are traveling into the city (agree the price before the start of the journey). Other destinations outside Seville obviously cost more and are metered. Tips are ''not'' necessary, though €1-2 for polite, helpful service is appreciated. You might also want to be aware of the fact that speed limits seem to be considered as kind of minimum speed by most taxi drivers...

An alternative is to fly to '''La Parra International Airport''' ({{IATA|XRY}}) located 10km from [[Jerez de la Frontera]], and is 95km from Seville.  Used by discount airlines such as Ryanair (from Frankfurt-Hahn London-Stansted).

===By train===

'''Sevilla Santa Justa Station''' is on the eastern edge of Seville city centre. Completed in 1991, the station is the southern terminus of the Spanish high speed AVE train service. There is also San Bernardo station which might suit depending on where you are travelling from and where in Seville you wish to be.

High-speed trains are great if time is of the essence, less than an hour from the wonderful city of Córdoba, less than three hours run from [[Madrid]] to Seville.

===By car===

Driving is also always an option for long distance travel in Spain, but isn't as convenient or as useful once in town.  If you intend to drive into Seville and are staying in one of the Old Towns, be aware that although Google Maps may say you can drive to your hotel, you very well may end up stuck in a tiny alleyway with virtually no way to turn around.  Talk to your hotel before you plan to park at your hotel, and learn what the street signs mean to keep you out of trouble.

===By bus===

The Spanish bus service is amazingly punctual and comfortable with most having air-con and a toilet.  Believe it or not, to get to Seville from other cities in Spain it can sometimes be only minimally longer than train (but much cheaper).  Check out your options first with the helpful Information desk you will find inside any terminal.  The buses run regularly to/from most major cities, departing either from the '''Plaza de Armas''' bus station near the river, or the '''Prado de San Sebastián''' station near the University/Santa Cruz. Sometime queue for buying ticket from the ticket office on a busy day might take up to 20 min or more.

==Get around==
Sevilla has a great public transportation system. The buses run frequently and cover the majority of the city in their routes. There is a refillable multimodal card (named Tarjeta del consorcio), that can be used in local and metropolitan buses, the tramway and the metro, allowing transfers for two hours. It can be purchased for 1,5 € at many news stands and the two main bus stations. There is also a card only for the local buses that doesn't allow transfers (Tarjeta multiviaje de Tussam) for a sightly cheaper fare (0,69 € instead 0,76 € for a local bus trip).

Sevici bikes are available throughout the city with special docking stations that allow you to easily grab a bike and go wherever you need, then drop it off at another station when you arrive. Bikes cost 11,50 euro for a week pass, which allows the first half hour free and subsequent hours are a euro each. Also, year passes can be purchased for 33 euro (39 with insurance) with each half hour free and additional hours 50 euro cents. It's cheaper to do an annual pass than over three weeks of weekly passes. 

Scooters are available for rent for €30 for the day and €120 for the week. These are a cost efficient way of getting around and a drivers license is not necessary.

E-scooters and e-bikes can be hired per minute, easy to use and great way to get around the city.

A tram system is currently being incorporated into Sevilla's local transportation and is running from the San Bernardo Train Station to the Plaza Nueva but is expanding North and West into Triana.

Taxis are easily accessible throughout the city. Many offer decent rates, but tourists should beware of the possibility of a crooked cabbie. Cabify (Spanish Uber) is also available, it has the advantage of offering a fixed fare according to the distance of the trip, regardless of time. 

=== Bike ===
Sevilla, the cultural heart of Andalusia is developing itself more and more as a cycling city. More than 62.14 miles of cycle lanes have been constructed which gives you the opportunity to discover this city fun, safe and fast by bike. Besides cycling in the city centre, it is also easy to discover the less touristic suburbs of Sevilla.

Also Sevilla has implemented a cycling plan called ´Sevici´. Sevici counts more than 250 cycle stations where you can grab a bike and cycle from A to B. The total amount of bikes now is around 2500. Not only locals use this system. As a tourist you can buy a card for 11 euros. Which allows you to hop on and off and bike through the city.

Lines 2 goes from Santa Justa train station to the Olympic Stadium and Cartuja 93 technology park (old Expo-92 site). The other lines go to nearby cities in the metropolitan area.

=== Other ways of getting around ===
*'''Cruises''', an hour in duration, leave from beneath the Torre de Oro and travel a circuit on the Guadalquivir river.

*'''Horse drawn carriage''' rides found near the cathedral take you to the nearby park and other sites of interest. For the sake of the animals, try to avoid/discourage the use of carriage rides in the heat of the day in summer.

{{style}}
*'''Bull Fights''' at the ''Plaza de Toros de la Real Maestranza'' &mdash; Bullfighting is not a sport for all; those who are either squeamish or have convictions on animal welfare should stay clear, as the event usually concludes with the killing of the bull. Failing that, a visit to the arena and the attached museum of bull-fighting (€7) is well worth the time. While it is not the largest, it is considered the most attractive bull arena in Spain due to its history.

Most if not all of Seville takes a week's holiday and they plan for the Fair months in advance. The fair is close to the river and covers a huge area and contains hundreds of private and public "casetas" which are laid out to form streets. Casetas are small marquees and you can only get into the private ones if invited. The public ones are large but just as much fun. The day is naturally split in two and between noon and 8PM the streets of the fair throng with horses as riders and carriages strut their stuff dressed in traditional Spanish robes. After 8 the streets are cleared and "Calle del Inferno" comes to life. This must be one of the best funfairs in Europe and.

*'''Flamenco''' &mdash; Flamenco is in fact very popular at the moment in Spain and is not just for tourists, however finding the right place is hard. "Pure Flamenco" is a special tour offered by Sevilla LowCost (www.sevillalowcost.es) where you can learn the history of flamenco, taste a manzanilla wine, and enjoy a genuine flamenco show.

El Arenal is another place to consider. The Cultural Centre (C/ Ximénez de Enciso, 28 ''Santa Cruz'', 954 56 06 70) is a good spot to see real flamenco, performances are daily at 9PM, it costs €15, €13 for students and Sevillians, €9 for kids (4 to 10). La Carboneria located in the twisty alleyways in front of the Cathedral offers free Flamenco shows nightly at 10PM (1 hour).

==Buy==

Seville is home to many beautiful artefacts, some of the more popularly known are plates and Spanish tiles. Triana offers many ceramic factories where one can buy various tiles from authentic craftsmen. There are stores that custom design plates and tiles near the cathedral, especially in Calle Sierpes, but across the river in Triana are other worthwhile pottery stores. Depending on the time of year, but especially leading up to Christmas, there are a number of artisan fairs throughout the city.

===Clothing===

Seville offers a wide variety of retail clothing, although generally at high prices. The main shopping district is home to all the big international and Spanish clothing lines (such as Zara who has at least 4 separate stores in Seville). The winding streets and alleyways of the Santa Cruz area (around the Cathedral) do a roaring trade in Spanish- and Andalusian-themed T-shirts and inexpensive ''flamenco'' dresses for little girls. The Corte Ingles (translated literally to "The English Court") is a large chain of department stores located throughout Spain selling everything.

*'''Toro de Fuego''', Hernando Colon, 38 local 3, 954 215 176. An above-average and tasteful T-shirt boutique, offering a large number of variations on the popular "bull of fire" theme. Printing is high quality, the fabric is good quality and proprietor María Gutiérrez is friendly and helpful. T-shirts average €16 for all sizes.

*'''Bershka''', Popular with the younger generation, Bershka has significant presence due to their clothing line with a distinct urban, or street culture feel. It is part of the Spanish Inditex group

*'''Blanco''' is particularly popular with young women in Spain and Europe. The trendy and free designs are colorful, comfortable and affordable.

*'''El Corte Inglés''', The main building in Plaza del Duque has several floors of clothing. The same for the Nervión Plaza location outside the historic center.

*'''Massimo Dutti''', Men's and women's fashion chain caters to a more modern feel of clothing. The designs are formal but quite trendy and utilize excellent fabrics with urban and cosmopolitan details. It is part of the Spanish Inditex group

*'''Stradivarius''', Known for its original, constantly changing fashion, the designs follow the latest trends in clothing and accessories. It is part of the Spanish Inditex group

*Wonder through an '''open-air market.''' Vendors in many parts of the city sell on the streets, but on Sunday, when everything else is closed, a few spots really fill up. One market is located behind the Alcampo shopping center at Ronda del Tamarguillo on Avenida de la Paz (Bus lines 30, 36 from Prado de San Sebastian), but it is easily outdone by a large flea market, selling clothes, furniture, trash, books, shoes, CDs, food, tools, and probably everything else just northwest of Triana near Avenida Carlos III (off of the left-hand side of most tourist maps).

==Eat==

Seville, like most Andalusian destinations, is known for its tapas. "Tapa", while it is associated with certain dishes, is actually a size and many restaurants or bars will offer a ''tapa'', ''1/2 ración'' (half serving, although sometimes enough to make a meal) and ''ración'' (serving) of the same dish. There are many great tapas places around the foot of the cathedral in the center of town. You can't go wrong, simply order one of everything to find your favorite! Some typical tapas include ''tortilla española'' (potato omelet), ''pulpo gallego'' (Galician octopus), ''aceitunas'' (olives), ''patatas bravas'' (spicy potatoes), and ''queso manchego'' (sheep's milk cheese from the nearby La Mancha region). Also be sure to try the ham, which you often see hanging above the bar. Be aware that most of the restaurants kitchens do not open before 20:30 in the evening. Though usually some easy to prepare meals are available before that time.

Some bars near the river, such as '''Pedalquivir''' and '''El Faro de Triana''', offer a nice view but aren't as good a deal in terms of the quality of the food.  Another would be '''El Patio San Eloy''' (San Eloy 9, Sevilla) where the tapas can be a little hit and miss, but where the cool staggered seating steps, fabulous décor and fruity sangria; provide a wonderful respite from the heat of the day. A good deal can more easily be had at less characteristic places such as '''Sloppy Joe's Pizza Inn''' and '''Papasá'''. For the most typical and interesting meal, stop at one of the many bars, especially one which doesn't offer English menus (the prices are likely to be lower).

If you're vegetarian, make sure you specify that you eat no fish or tuna as vegetarian only implies no flesh here. A place with a very good selection of vegetarian and vegan foods is '''Habanita''', a quiet open air restaurant in the center of the city.

If you would like to purchase your own food, head down to one of the markets close to the center of the city, such as in Plaza Encarnación. El Corte Inglés is a larger more popular department store that you can go to for almost every need.

Do NOT eat the oranges from the trees on the street if you are visiting off season.  They are extremely sour and have been sprayed to stop the birds from eating.

Another amazing place for tapas is the '''Taberna Coloniales''' located in Plaza Cristo de Burgos 19. The place is cozy and has only a few tables. Go there early to put your name on the board to get a table, then head inside for a couple of beers. Portions are large and food is very very good. Nice homemade desserts, too.

*<eat name="M.A.S and Dia" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="">These are two very popular grocery stores and have everything you need for much less money than El Corte Ingles.  Additionally, Dia has its own discount brand on a lot of items.  Though they are closed on Sundays (like most everything else in Sevilla) they are located throughout the city and are very easily accessible. </eat>

The original Levies is a great tapas restaurant with great prices and wonderful, inexpensive jarras of sangria. The Taberna has a different menu and offers tapas as well as more mexican-inspired dishes such as burritos and nachos. The third Levies is their wine and drinks bar and is also recommendable.</eat>
*<eat name="Rodilla" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" url="http://www.rodilla.es" hours="12-8" price="$4" lat="" long="">Rodilla is a great place to get lunch, they serve up sandwiches in the form of tapas.

There are two locations in Seville, one close to the cathedral and the one I prefer is conveniently located just outside of the Barrio Santa Cruz area.  Rodilla is inexpensive, and can also be a great option if you a vegetarian.</eat>

==Drink==
The nightlife of Seville is fantastic; no other European city has so many bars per inhabitant than Seville. In summer go to Isla Cartuja and find out why the Spanish night doesn't stop before 7AM. There you can find plenty of open-air discotheques. Other nightlife spots include Calle Betis in Triana, La Alamede de Hércules, and Plaza Alfalfa.

*Couchsurfing Sevilla Community meets at least once a week at Revuelto´s Meeting. Every Friday at 10:00PM in Tha Clan Bar, Calle Adriano, 3 Sevilla. Make sure you ask for the CS discounts ;-) - Update 06/2010, The CS meeting apparently doesn't meet here anymore.  It's on Wednesdays elsewhere.  Check the CS Sevilla group for current listings.
*There are quite a few teterias in Triana across the river offering teas, shakes and middle eastern pastries in a cozy cushion filled environment. 

*Across from the cathedral sits a coffee shop called '''Cafe de Indias''' where you can buy delicious chocolate shakes and coffees. Down the street is a patisserie shop selling chocolate covered palmeras, a wonderful afternoon treat after a long day touring the sites. There are many coffee shops and patisserie shops in Seville, particularly in Calle Asunción in Los Remedios. Café de Indias, Starbucks and other franchises have descended lately on the city and are a good option in an emergency, but you can get a decent coffee in most local bars. For an up-market classic, visit '''La Campana''', at the end of calle Sierpes.

*Don't miss '''Cervecería La Internacional''', one of the best beer shops in Spain. More than 250 types of beer, wonderful tapas and good connections. It's located in Calle Barcelona, just 1 minute away from Plaza Nueva, near the Town Hall. However, do not get confused, it is international, meaning, not typically Sevillano.

*Sangría (an alcoholic fruit punch) is often sought by tourists, but Tinto de Verano (a mix of red wine and lemon or orange soda) is more authentic, has less alcohol, and is often cheaper.

*Cruzcampo, the local beer, is worth trying. Compared to other Spaniards, Sevillanos consume more beer and less wine.

*The tap water in Seville is good.

*Agua de Sevilla is sometimes thought of as a popular drink in Seville, but you will never see a person from Seville drinking it, despite all the tourists drinking it as if it were something popular.
*<drink name="Levies" alt="" address="Calle San José, 15 41004 Sevilla, Spain" directions="954 225 096" phone="" url="" hours="L-J de 20:00 a 2:00 / V-D de 20:00 a 3:00 " price="" lat="" long="">Levies is a set of three restaurants in one small plaza, sharing table space and menus.

Draught beer is also available, along with a wide selection of wines and spirits, as well as 5€ Cocktail jugs. In addition, there are a wide variety of tasty tapas, as you would expect from the name.</drink>

Seville is an emblematic city of Andalusia whose charm is known around the world. Culture, gastronomy, architecture, climate, mentality and lifestyle are dreaming all travelers. You can find many charming corners, unsuspected views of the city or exceptional locations close the most beautiful historical monuments. There are many beautiful and unexpected accommodations accessible for short and medium stay.

Accommodation prices change with the tourist seasons. High season is April, May, September & October, Semana Santa, and Feria; mid season is March & June. Visits are recommended in November. Prices are not too high and weather is neither too hot nor cold. For a more intimate experience on a budget, wander into Santa Cruz, the old Jewish Quarter, and you will find wonderful "pensiones" offering comfy beds and typical courtyard views.

Most places have air conditioning but be sure to ask in summer, you will want it. You will probably pass the siesta (early afternoon) in your room to escape the heat.

Sevillanos are famous for their nightlife so if you don't plan to be out at all hours yourself, you may want to seek out accommodation on a quiet street (that is, without too many bars and restaurants). Alternately, ask for a room set back from the street. While a view of the passing traffic may be pleasant by day, you will appreciate the relative quiet at night.

Hostels are a wise choice for the unplanned trip. There are many nice hostels located all over the city. You can sleep dorm style with up to 10 beds in a room sharing a common bathroom or for a little more money you can stay in a single bed with your own bathroom.
