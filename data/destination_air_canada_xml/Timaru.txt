==Understand==

==Get in==

===By car===
'''State Highway One''' passes through Timaru. This is the main north/south arterial road in New Zealand. The stretch between Christchurch and Timaru is not particularly scenic, so tourists with time on their hands may opt for the slightly more circuitous but more picturesque '''Inland Scenic Route 72''' via Mt Somers and [[Geraldine]]. 

Timaru is at the end of '''SH8''', which leads to destinations such as [[Lake Tekapo]] (122km) and [[Mount Cook]] (210km).

==Get around==

Being a medium sized town in New Zealand, the main mode of transport is by car. That being said, most attractions, accommodation and eateries are located centrally so getting around on foot is doable.

[http://www.metroinfo.co.nz/timaru/timetables/Pages/default.aspx '''Metro'''] provides commuter and daytime bus services during weekdays. There is a limited service on Saturday and none on Sundays.

The moderate size of Timaru also makes cycling an option. [http://www.thecyclery.co.nz/ '''The Cyclery'''] offers bicycles for hire. If you're into cycling, there are quite a few nice rides in the rolling countryside around Timaru.

In the port are magnificent <!-- ?!? --> cranes which play a pivotal role in wealth generation for the region. Marvel at the glorious array of artistic contributions to the city: the ferocious "Face of Peace", and the "malconstructed tubular bunk of Joy" which reside below the Piazza, and in front of the earthquake-proof Council offices, respectively.

Many of the buildings on Stafford St have an Edwardian influence. Look out for the Landing Services building on George Street, built in 1870 from local bluestone. Also the Royal Arcade (between Stafford St and Sophia St) the Council Buildings (George Street), the old Customs House (Strathallan St), St Mary's Church (Church St) and the brutalist Warren and Mahoney District Library (Sophia St). As you travel around town you might also see some of the old brick flour mills such as Evans Atlas (Station St) Belford (North St, best viewed from Heaton St), Coupland's (High St) and Timaru Milling Co. (Mill St). Take a good look as some of these buildings are threatened by demolition due to increased stringency in the building code (even though Timaru has a low earthquake risk compared to other parts of NZ because of its location and soil type).</see>
