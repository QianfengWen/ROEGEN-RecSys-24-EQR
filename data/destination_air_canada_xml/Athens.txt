'''Athens''' ([[Greek phrasebook|Greek]]: Αθήνα, ''Athína''), is the capital city of [[Greece]] with a registered metropolitan population of 3.7 million inhabitants, but indeed there are [http://movingtoathens.info/the-city 5 million people estimated]. It is in many ways the birthplace of Classical Greece and a large part of Western civilization. The design of the city is marked by Ottoman, Byzantine and Roman civilizations. Today, greater Athens is by far the economic, political and cultural center of modern Greece, with nearly half of the country's population.

[[Image:Acropolis.jpg|thumb|right|The Acropolis - birthplace of modern Western civilization.]]
The sprawling city is bounded on three sides by Mt Ymettos, Mt Parnitha and Mt Pendeli; whilst inside Athens are twelve hills [the seven historical ones are: Acropolis, Areopagus, Hill of Philopappus, Observatory Hill (Muses Hill), Pnyx, Lykavittos (Lycabettus), Tourkovounia (Anchesmus)], the Acropolis and Lykavittos being the most prominent. These hills provide a refuge from the noise and commotion of the crowded city streets, offering amazing views down to Saronic Gulf, Athens' boundary with the Aegean Sea on its southern side. The streets of Athens (clearly signposted in Greek and English) now meld imperceptibly into [[Athens/Piraeus|Piraeus]], the city's ancient (and still bustling) port.

Places of interest to travelers can be found within a relatively small area surrounding the city centre at Syntagma Square (''Plateia Syntagmatos''). This epicentre is surrounded by the districts of the Plaka to the south, Monastiraki and Thissio to the west, Kolonaki to the northeast and Omonia to the northwest.

[[Image:Vouli.jpg|thumb|The Parliament building, built as a Royal Palace in 1843]]

The first pre-historic settlements were constructed in 3000 BC around the hill of Acropolis. The legend says that the King of Athens,  Theseus unified the ten tribes of early Athens into one kingdom (c. 1230 BC). This process of synoikismos – bringing together in one home – created the largest and wealthiest state on the Greek mainland, but it also created a larger class of people excluded from political life by the nobility. By the 7th century BC, social unrest had become widespread, and the Areopagus appointed Draco to draft a strict new code of law (hence "draconian"). When this failed, they appointed Solon with a mandate to create a new constitution (594 BC). This was the great beginning of a new social revolution, which resulted in the democracy under Clisthenes (508 BC). 
During the Middle Ages, Athens experienced a decline, but re-emerged under Byzantine rule. Athens was thriving and prosperous during the Crusades, actually benefiting from the Italian trade during this period. However, this fruitful period was shortlived, as Athens suffered badly under the Ottoman Empire, only to recover in the 19th century as the capital of independent Greece.

===Architecture===
[[Image:Plaka1.JPG|thumb|Old Athens - Plaka]]

Athens was just a small provincial village when it was chosen in the 1830s to serve as the national capital of the modern Greek State. Although it had a prestigious past, the city's political, economic, and cultural importance had declined over the centuries, leaving behind only its classical ruins as a reminder of better times. With the decision to move the national capital from Nafplio to Athens, architects and city planners were hired to build a new city next to the classical ruins, with grand neoclassical homes and public buildings, large city squares, green spaces, and wide avenues, making a conscious, decisive turn from the city's Ottoman past. The city regained its importance in Greek civilization, and by 1900 had evolved into a very attractive cosmopolitan city, with abundant neoclassical architecture harking to the nation's past.  

The 20th century however, marked the rapid development of Athens. The city suffered minor damage during WWII, and suffered extensive urban planning in the decades that followed, as the nation rapidly industrialized and urbanized. In the 1960s and 1970s, many 19th century neoclassical buildings, often small and private, were demolished to make way for office buildings, often designed by great Greek architects. The city also expanded outward through rash development, particularly towards the west, as its population grew by absorbing job-seekers from the provinces. With the onset of the automobile, public officials reduced the city's public transportation services without foreseeing the traffic gridlock and smog that would menace the city by the 1980s. 

By the late 1980s and early 1990s, the city's reality led to a rude awakening among local and national officials and, coupled with the country's newfound remarkable prosperity, large scale projects began to slowly regenerate the city and undo some of the damages of recent decades. Over the course of the next 15 years, money was poured into new transportation infrastructure projects, the restoration of surviving neoclassical buildings, the gentrification of the city's historical center and the renovation of many former industrial areas and the city's coastline. The restoration of charming neoclassical buildings in the city's historical center has been accompanied by the construction of attractive post-modern buildings in newer districts; both of which have begun to improve the aesthetic essence of the city. Athens today is ever evolving, forging a brand new identity for the 21st century.

===Olympic Games===
[[Image:AthensOlympicVelodrome.jpg|thumb|The Olympic Velodrome at the Athens Olympic Sports Complex]] 

Athens hosted the 2004 Summer Olympic Games.  While most of the sporting venues were located outside the city proper -in various locations throughout Attica- the entire urban area of Athens underwent major lasting changes that have improved the quality of life for visitors and residents alike.  Aside from the excellent transportation infrastructure that was completed in time for the 2004 Olympics (from new freeways to light rail systems), the city's historic center underwent serious renovation.  Most notable among the city's facelift projects are the ''Unification of Archaelogical Sites'' -which connects the city's classical-era ruins and monuments to each other through a network of pleasant pedestrianized streets- and the restoration of the picturesque neoclassical ''Thissio'' and ''Pláka'' districts.

===History===
Athens first appears on the pages of history around 1400 B.C., at which time it was already a major cultural center of the Mycenaean civilization. The ''Acropolis'' and remnants of the ''Cyclopean Walls'' attest to its status as a Mycenaean fortress city. In 1200 B.C., many Mycenaean cities were destroyed and resettled by invading bands of Dorians, but Athenian tradition maintains that Athens escaped this fate and retained a "pure Ionian bloodline." Beginning as early as 900 B.C., Athens became a leading trade center within the Greek world, owing to its central location, possession of the heavily fortified ''Acropolis'' and its quick access to the sea.

By the beginning of the 6th Century B.C., the foundations of democratic reforms were laid in Athens by Solon, and full democracy was achieved by 508 B.C. under Cleisthenes. By this time also, the Athenian navy had grown large and powerful enough to assist the Ionian regions of Asia Minor in their rebellion against Persian rule, which lasted from 499 to 493 B.C. The revolt ultimately failed, however, and Athens' support of the rebels incensed King Darius of [[Persia]] to the point of launching an all-out invasion of Greece in 492 B.C. Athens and [[Sparta]] led a coalition of Greek city-states against the invaders and defeated them, but Athens was nonetheless sacked twice by the Persians before the war's end.

Following the Greco-Persian War, Athens entered the ''Golden Age of Athenian Democracy,'' during which time it was the clear cultural leader of the Greek world. Philosophy, drama, history-writing, artistry, and political reform all entered their "heyday." Athens also became the head of the ''Delian League,'' which began as an alliance to continue the fight against Persia, but soon became little more than a tool by which Athens promoted its own imperial ambitions. Sparta soon chafed at this situation, and the two cities — once allies, now rivals — fought the lengthy ''Peloponnesian War'' between 431 and 404 B.C. Athens was finally defeated by the militaristic Spartans, and though it remained an important city-state, it failed to become the center of a great empire.

In 338 B.C., [[Macedonia (Greece)‎‎|Macedonia]] defeated an alliance of Greek city-states and conquered all [[Greece]], including the city of Athens. Athens remained under Macedonian rule until the Romans defeated them in 197 B.C. While under [[Rome]], Athens was a free city with a much-admired school system and received special favor from Emperor Hadrian in the 2nd Century A.D. 

Athens passed from Roman to Byzantine rule when the empire split in Late Antiquity, declined during the Middle Ages and benefited from trade with [[Italy]] during the Crusades. In 1458, it fell to the Ottoman Empire and did not again become part of an independent Greece until 1832. In 1834, it became Greece's capital, and in 1896, it hosted the first modern ''Olympics.'' In 1922, after the Greco-Turkish War, many Ionian refugees flooded into Athens, and the city also grew exponentially during the 1950's and 60's. Today, it is a metropolis and a major world tourist attraction.

===Weather===
The weather in Athens is the kind of mediterranean found in many other coastal cities in southern Europe like [[Barcelona]], [[Valencia]] and [[Palermo]]. The truth is though that the Athenian weather may vary from area to area for reasons like it's influence from the urban heat island that is present in many metropolises around the world, it's distance from the sea and it's altitude (there are significant altitude variations within the greater city area). The affluent northern suburbs of [[Kifisia]], Marousi, Nea Erythraia, Ekali, Dionysos, Thrakomakedones, Penteli (build on the foothills of Mount Penteli) are less affected by the urban heat island, have a heavy presence of trees and a high altitude (from 230 to 450 meters). This results in a template climate with colder winters and cooler summers than the city center. The southern suburbs (Glyfada, Alimos, Faliro, Kallithea, Elliniko and Moschato) and [[Pireaus]] also have cooler summers due to their proximity to the sea, in contrast with central Athens were summertime is very hot. 

'''Winters''' in Athens are mild. However they tend to be colder than other cities at the same latitude like Palermo, Valencia or Calgiari and it the weather varies a bit from region to region (due to the differences in altitude and the urban heat island). In the central and southern areas of the city temperatures swings are usually between 5C - 15C (42F - 55F) (the nighttime lows are usually 2-3C on the coast than the city center) but it's not rare for temperatures to climb even higher for a few days (around 19-20C or high 60sF). In the city's northern and northwestern suburbs like Kifisia, Marousi, Nea Erythraia and Penteli nights are colder with temperatures usually hovering a few degrees above zero (or sometimes even below) and days are cooler. Prolonged cold periods are very rare but there may be 2-3 days per year when the mercury bottoms at freezing point even in the city center. Most precipitation falls in the form of rain (on moderate amounts). Snow does usually fall 1-3 times per year in the northern suburbs and, while some flurries may reach the central areas once or twice every winter, and the southern and coastal areas once every third winter. Major snowfalls are rare.

'''Spring''' is a quite pleasant time of the year and while the first weeks of March may still be cold, the weather becoming progressively warmer as days pass. It's not uncommon to see people in areas like Glyfada to walk with shorts and t-shirts in mid-April. The amount of rainfall falling in the city during these months is low (only 67 mm). In mid to late May the first heatwaves may hit Athens and raise the mercury above 30C (86F) for 1-2 days. 

'''Summers''' in Athens are hot and almost completely dry (with the exception of a few thunderstorms in June). The heat is blistering especially in July and August (which share the exact same weather characteristics). Temperatures in the city center and the densely populated western suburbs frequently reach 35C (95F), this adding to the fact that the heat is trapped between buildings can make the atmosphere quite unpleasant at noon and during the afternoon. The northern suburbs usually remain 2-3C (6-7F) cooler than the rest of Athens while the southern areas benefit from the sea breeze and are the epicenter of the action with many beaches, coastal bars and clubs. Unfortunately, some public transport vehicles (metro, tram, bus and trolley cars) don't have air-condition, meaning that a ride with them may be unpleasant. During heatwaves the temperature may reach 40C (105F); in fact Athens recorded the highest temperature in Europe in 1977, a staggering 48C (118F). 

'''Autumn''' Autumn is a season that varies significantly. While September and early October are usually considered an extension of the summer with 30C (85F) readings being seen even in the first week of October sometimes, November is quite cool and the rainiest month of the year. The beaches start to get less and less populated as schools start in mid-September, but early autumn is still a great time to go to the beach if you want to. Usually by late November the weather gets firmly cool/cold marking the beginning of winter.

'''Pollution''': Pollution in Athens used to be a huge problem during the 1980s and 1990s and the city was frequently rated as one of the most polluted in the world. Due to being almost completely surrounded by mountains (Ymittos, Penteli, Parnitha and Aigaleo) the pollution was gets trapped above the city especially when there was stillness and during the winter when many homes burn wood in fireplaces to get warm. However, since then the city and greek goverment have made huge efforts to clean the atmosphere with the introduction of an extensive public transport system, newer and greener car vehicles and the removing heavily polluting factories outside the urban core. Athens' air purification was a big bet for the 2004 Olympic Games and was indeed successful. While there might be some hazy days the pollution era of Athens has passed for good since the dawn of the new milennium.

===Literature===
The Greeks virtually founded all of Western literature, and ancient Athens was the center of this literary activity from very early on, though Homer's epics Iliad and Odyssey and Hesiod's poetic account of the Greek pantheon were written before Athens' rise to literary prominence.

The earliest example of a famous Athenian author is '''Thespis,''' an award-winning dramatist of the 6th Century B.C. who invented the style called ''Greek tragedy,'' but no clearly genuine example of his works survives. In the 5th Century B.C. came the ''Age of Pericles,'' wherein Athenian drama had its "heyday" and multitudes of new theaters were erected. The most famous dramatist of this era was '''Aeschylus,''' who introduced dialogue and character interaction to essentially create the modern idea of dramatic literature. Only seven out of dozens of his plays survive, including ''Agamemnon,'' ''The Persians,'' and ''Seven Against Thebes.''

Other important ancient Greek writers of Athens include:

*'''Sophocles,''' author of ''Oedipus Rex,'' who was a rival of Aeschylus and did much to develop irony as a literary technique.

*'''Aristophanes,''' a comic playwright who led the "Old Comedy" style of ancient Athens. He wielded ridicule to the point that his contemporaries even came to fear him. Eleven of his 30 plays still survive.

*'''Menander,''' famous practitioner of "New Comedy" in Athens. He was extremely popular in both Ancient and Medieval times, though his over 100 works are now mostly fragments. His comic play ''Dyskolos,'' however, has survived largely intact.

For those who would like something more modern to read that connects to Athens, consider any of the following:

*'''Timon of Athens,''' by William Shakespeare, first published in 1623. This is a historical fiction about an Athenian named Timon, who was very generous but lost all of his money to corrupt people who bled him dry.

*'''Ashes,''' a novel published in Greek in 2007 and translated into English. It is set in Athens just before the 2004 Olympics held there, and is in the ''crime thriller'' genre. The author is Sergios Gakas.

*'''Tides of War''' by Steven Pressfield. This novel chronicles the Peloponnesian War but through the account of a fictional Athenian soldier, Polemides. Pressfield has written other classical history novels in the past, so this is from a seasoned author.

Also well known is the Biblical account of St. Paul's visitation to Athens and his speech concerning their superstitious belief in every god, to the point they even erected an altar to "the unknown God," whom Paul then preaches to them. The sermon is recorded in Acts 17 and involves teaching on the doctrines of Creation and the Resurrection of Christ. The latter doctrine led to many scoffing and a few converting. This was the beginning of the church in Athens, which is still a Christian city to this day.

==Get in==

===By plane===

Athens airport is a major hub in the Aegean, Balkan and East Mediterranean regions. Air Canada, American and Delta maintain non-stop flights from North America on a seasonal basis only, while a large number of European carriers fly directly into Athens. Since 2009 after the privatisation of the national airline Olympic Airlines there's no more overseas flights. If you want to fly to Athens during winter time from North-America you must connect somewhere in Europe. From June 2017, [https://asianaviation.co/en/scoot-tigerair/ Scoot] will start direct flights to Singapore and more other flights to Southeast Asia and Australia.

====The airport====
The new '''[[Athens international airport|Athens Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport]]''' [http://www.aia.gr/traveler/] 27 km (17 miles) east of the city center, near the suburb of Spáta, opened in 2001 as part of the infrastructure improvements in preparation for the Olympics when it became one of the more attractive and efficient major European airports. The airport is relatively small for international standards, however it is made and administered with tourism in mind, so you can expect an easy-going experience with high quality of service. In addition, the airport has excellent public transit connections to the city (see below) and the usual array of food stands, duty-free shops, and other airport services. 

There is a Tourist information station in Arrivals that will have the latest literature put out by the Tourist Information Department; this is useful for getting information of arranged local festivities in Athens and Attica. They will also have a printed brochure of Ferry information from Piraeus and other Attica ports.

Especially if you need to kill some time, '''make sure to visit the small museum on the top floor''' that has an interesting history on Athens as well as a space put aside for temporary exhibits.

You are going to need euro coins if you want a trolley for your luggage; trolleys are available at the airport, you will find them in the baggage hall on arrival and they use coins the same way supermarket trolleys do. You insert your coin, and you get it back by placing the trolley back to its original position.

If you stay in Athens for a short time, consider leaving part of your luggage in a baggage storage. It is run by Care4Bag and is located in the end of left-hand wing, arrivals level. Storage time differentiates between 6 hours to 10 days and sizes vary from small to large. The only inconvenience is that the same queue is used for collecting and for leaving – allow extra time before your flight. No automatic lockers can be found in the airport. You can also store your luggage in Monastiraki station in the recently opened Athens Lockers-Left Luggage. There is also a locker facility at Syntagma square Leaveyourluggage. Alternative you can use Baggagement that provides storage and same day luggage delivery from / to any place in Athens area.

If your schedule has you arriving on a long flight with some fatigue likely, you might use the decent Sofitel hotel next to the airport, just a short walk from the arrivals hall.  As a popular business hotel, you'd best reserve your room in-advance, and ask for a non-smoking room if important.

There is Free WiFi in the Airport, which however requires login through email and is limited to 45 minutes, with no promise of security. When your time is up you can just reconnect using the airports web portal or through a different email.

====From the airport to the city====

From the airport you can reach the city:
*By '''Metro''' to the city centre for € 9 (half price for under 18 or over 65, ticket good for 1.5 hours on other Athens transit); this tourist scam price does not correspond with the Metro price in town (1.20 Euro per trip / 2022). If you leave in less than a 48 hours you can get the two-way ticket for € 16.  Group tickets (2 or 3 persons) are also available and they provide some discount (see By Metro section below in Get Around).  To catch the Metro from the airport arrivals hall, go through exit #3, cross the street, escalate to the sky bridge, walk to the station to buy tickets, and follow ''Metro'' signs down to the platforms.

:Be aware that tickets for the Suburban Trains (white tickets) are sold just next to the tickets for the Metro (blue tickets), so make sure you get the correct ones.

:Don't forget to '''validate your ticket''' before going down to the platform and boarding a train (there are validation machines at the top of the escalators in the ticket hall). Failure to validate your ticket at the start of the journey can mean a fine of up to € 120. The ticket inspectors are rigorous and won't hesitate to call for police assistance if you start to object. 

:The airport Metro line is an extension of Line 3 (blue line) which takes you to the downtown Syntagma and Monastiráki stations in Athens and for the downtown of Piraeus you takes off at Dimotiko Theatro. Note that at the airport train station, two types of trains - metro trains and suburban trains - arrive at the same platform. If you are travelling into the city centre, you should take the metro trains (depart every 36 minutes daily 6:10 to 23:34). From the Airport, the metro (blue) train takes 38 minutes to reach Syntagma, 40 minutes to reach Monastiráki and 59 minutes to reach Dimotiko Theatro.

:(If you are heading into Athens to see the Acropolis, you can use the Metro (blue) line to go from the Airport straight to Monastiráki station near the northern side of the Acropolis. An alternative is to go to Syntagma station, where you change from the blue line to the red line heading south, and get off at the first stop of Acropolis metro station which is at the southern more photogenic side of the Acropolis.)

:Those taking the Metro from Athens out to the Airport should note that not all trains on the blue line go all the way to the airport; typically the airport trains run every half hour, while trains in the intervals don't go the whole route. Airport trains are indicated on the schedule and by an aeroplane logo on the front of the train, they are also announced by the signs on the metro platform.  It's useful to go to the Metro station the day before, explain to the agent (most speak English) when you need to be at the airport, and ask what time you should catch the airport train from that station. You can also get this information at the airport metro station, which has a desk staffed most hours by someone who speaks English. It's possible but not necessary to buy your ticket in advance; buying in advance though means you won't risk missing your train if you find at the last minute you don't have change for the ticket machines and have to stand in a line to buy it from the agent.

:And of course be aware of pick-pockets.

*By '''suburban railway''' to Larissis Railway Station costs € 9. Suburban trains are not as fast as the metro trains.  Change at Larissis Railway Station to Line 2 of the subway that takes you to:
**the downtown Omónia and Syntagma stations.
**Northern Greece (until Thessaloniki) and the Northern Peloponnese (until Egio), by train.

[[File:Bus at Athens Airport (line X95).jpg|thumb|right|Bus X95 at the airport]]
*By '''express bus''' [http://www.oasa.gr/content.php?id=airlines&lang=en]: X93 to Kifissos Coach Station, X95 to Syntagma Square (subway Lines 2 and 3), X96 to Piraeus (subway Line 1) and X97 to Dafni metro station (subway Line 2) for € 5.50 (€ 2.70 under 18 or over 65).  Bus tickets are sold at the info/ticket-kiosk (located outside the Arrivals between Exits 4 and 5), or onboard (ask operator) at no extra cost.  Buses, unlike Metro, operate 24 hours a day.  Express bus  X95 [http://www.oasa.gr/xmap.php?id=px95&lang=en] runs 3-5/hour and takes a little more than an hour depending on traffic to go from the airport to the final stop on Othonos street along the side of Syntagma Square.  Boarding is not permitted at intermediate stops on trips from the airport. Drivers normally won't sell you a ticket on the way from airport, so you are supposed to buy ticket in kiosk. Express bus ticket is invalid for transfer.

*By '''taxi''': taxis queue outside exit #3.   According to a new law, taxis to the city centre cost € 38 during the day (5:00-24:00) and  € 54 during the night (0:00-5:00). Be sure to ask if the flat fare includes toll costs and all fees. 

A private airport transfer can be also booked in advance. This service is especially convenient for large groups. 
* [https://deepblue-tours.com/en/ Deep Blue Tours] offers private tailor made transfer with mini-van for groups

* [http://holidaytaxis.com Holiday Taxis] has Athens Airport to the city centre at £156.30 for a minibus 13-seater

Athens doesn't have services with local drivers such as Uber, Hailo or Lyft for the time being. However, there is a service, [http://www.welcomepickups.com/Athens Welcome Pickups], that enables local Athenians to pick you up from the airport, drive you to your destination and give you a meaningful introduction to the city or a quick tour. It costs €38 flat and the price is fixed and pre-paid. 
It is advisable to grab a free copy of city transport map in the airport – in the city, it is extremely helpful.

===By regional coach===

Regional coaches (KTEL) connect Athens to other cities in Greece. The fleet of buses has recently been upgraded, which makes the journey pleasant and safe. For some destinations one can also use the buses of the railroad company (OSE, see next paragraph) that might be international, but can also be used for in-country transport. 

At times there are collaborations with companies from adjacent countries such as Turkey, Bulgaria, Serbia and Albania, so your best move will always be to ask on both the bus and the train companies about your available options.

'''KTEL'''

Thessaloniki → Athens: € 42 single, € 65 roundtrip ''at the counter''; € 32 single, € 56 roundtrip ''e-ticketing''. Reduced prices are offered if you qualify for them.

===By train===

The national, state owned, rail service, '''Hellenic Train,''' [https://www.hellenictrain.gr/] connects Athens to other cities in Greece. All services are via Athens railway station which is collocated with Larissa metro station. You should not expect the diversity and complexity of railroads you usually find in other European countries. The national railroad system is poor in Greece, in effect having only two train lines. One goes south to the [[ North Peloponnese]] (until Egio) and the other to the north, connecting Athens with the second major city in Greece, [[Thessaloniki]]. From there the line continues further to the north and all the way to the east, passing through many other cities of northern Greece. Be advised that there are two kinds of train you can use, IC makes the trip in 4:30 hours, and the train etr 470 that makes the trip in about 4 hours. Both offer first and second class seats, a snack bar wagon and safe luggage transport (for a small extra fee, ideal if you are carrying a lot of them). Tickets are available in the company's site, where there are occasionally offers of tickets with extra discount.

===By boat===

The port of [[Athens/Piraeus|Piraeus]] is the main port of Athens, and is served by many ferries.  Cruise ships also regularly visit, especially during warm months.  Generally, pedestrian ferry users will be closer than cruise passengers to the Metro station providing access to the center of Athens; walking distances can vary considerably.

Cruise passengers on larger ships, docked near the recently expanded Terminal B, usually reach the main cruise Terminal A by port shuttle bus; otherwise, it can be a non-trivial walk.  Smaller cruise ships (e.g., 1300 or fewer passengers) may dock near the Terminal A.  From Terminal A, pedestrians face a safe, level walk north (harbor on your left) of over a mile to the Piraeus Metro station (look for the pedestrian overpass); taxis are readily available to go there, but are not inexpensive.

There're regular routes, mostly operated by freighter ships.

==Get around== 
Public transport in Athens has improved by leaps and bounds in the last twenty years. Since the opening of the metro in January 2000 and the subsequent openings of Eleftherios Venizelos Airport in 2001, the suburban railway and the tram in 2004, the city has seen a significant reduction of time between distances and much of the main roads alleviated from heavy traffic jams. The regular €1.20 ("integrated") ticket lets you travel on any means of transport — metro, suburban trains, trams, trolleybuses, buses — with unlimited transfers anywhere within Athens (except the metro airport line east of Doukissis Plakentias and the airport buses) for 90 minutes, and you can also get a € 4.10 ticket valid for 24 hours, a € 8,20 weekly (5-day) ticket or a € 20 tourist (3-day) ticket that also includes one Metro ride to the airport and one from the airport. Tickets can be topped up using touchscreen terminals at most/major stations and stops, such terminals can also issue refund of unused deposit. Terminals are designed to accept contactless card payment, but in many cases this is not functional. '''Always validate your ticket''' before entering any form of public transport.

===By metro===
[[Image:Public_transport_map_of_Athens.png|thumb|350px|Public transport map of Athens]]

The '''Athens Metro''' system [http://www.stasy.gr/index.php?id=77&=&L=1], for almost 100 years consisted of only one, mostly overground, line connecting Pireaus, to the city center and the northern suburbs. However since the dawn of the new milennium the city has added two new lines (mainly as part of the preparation for the Olympics) that have been expanded ever since. Overall the three lines are: 
* '''Line 1''' (Μ1 – Green[http://www.stasy.gr]): '''Piraeus – Kifisia''' - Line 1 connects the port of Piraeus and the northern suburbs of Kifissia and Marousi via the city centre. Note that line 1 is a rather old line going back to 1869 (lines 2 & 3 are the new subway system of Athens). The only underground section is between Monastiraki and Attiki.  
* '''Line 2''' (M2 – Red[http://www.stasy.gr]): '''Anthoupoli – Elliniko''' The second line of the Athenian Metro was inagurated in 2000. It connects the northern part of the densely populated western suburbs of Peristeri and Anthoupoli with the south-eastern areas of Ilioupoli, Argiroupoli, Alimos and Elliniko via the city center. The line is set to expand towards Ilion to the north and Glyfada to the south but both expansions are in an early phase.   
* '''Line 3''' (M3 – Blue[http://www.stasy.gr]): '''Dimotiko Theatro – Doukissis Plakentias – Airport''' - The third line of the metro was also inagurated in 2000. It connects the north-eastern suburbs of Agia Paraskevi, Chalandri and the airport with Pireaus via the city center like the other lines. This is the first and only completed line as it just added three brand new stations in Pireaus in 2022. [[Image:Athens-metro_01.jpg|thumb|250px|Metro Line 1 train (Green Line) passes by the Stoa of Attalus in central Athens.]] 

'''Tickets'''[http://www.athenstransport.com/english/tickets/]: Metro uses the "integrated" ticket that costs € 1.20 as of 2022 (half price for seniors over 65 and youth under 18). Tickets can be purchased over manned booths or automated vending machines (some of which accept banknotes) in every station. You must validate your ticket prior to going to the platform. There currently are no turnstiles controlling access to the trains, so in theory you could try to ride for free, if however you're caught without a properly validated ticket you'll be asked to pay a hefty 60x the normal fare [currently € 84]. Greece's latest economic misadventures have led into intensified inspections in a try to raise more cash; keep in mind that refusing to pay the fine on-the-spot guarantees that you will be escorted away to the nearest police station for a background check and potentially notify your home embassy.

From the moment of validating your €1.20 ticket, you can use it to ride any "Metro" train to every station (except the Airport) or any of the buses or tram (see below) for the next 90 minutes. It's perfectly fine to reverse direction of travel with the same ticket, as long as you are below the 90 minutes mark; if your last trip is expected to go beyond it, you must validate your ticket for a second and last time just before the mark. In more recent times, as a sign of solidarity to those most affected from the financial crisis, many Athenians elect to "drop" their still-good 90-minute tickets in convenient locations near the station entrance for the next person to pick. While you might feel tempted joining or trying to benefit from them, keep in mind that giving away or accepting an already-used ticket is '''illegal''' and if a policeman in a bad mood notices you, you can get fined for fare evasion (see above) or station littering.

If you plan to do multiple trips within a day, it makes more sense to buy a 24-hour ticket (which again, works for all destinations except the airport) for € 4.10. This needs to be validated only once, at the start of the first trip. The standard fare to or from the Airport is € 9 (half price for seniors over 65 and youth under 18), €18 for a one-way trip for a 2-person group, and €24 for a one-way trip for a 3-person group.

'''The Metro card can be used for ALL of public transport in Athens.'''

The subway runs daily from 05:30-00:30. Line 2 and 3 '''longer operate until 1.30 am on Fridays and Saturday nights'''. Line 1 runs daily from 05:00- 01:00

===By suburban rail===

The '''Suburban Railway''' [http://www.trainose.gr/] ''Hellenic Train'' is a new addition to Athens's network that started operating in the early 2000s.  The main line starts from Piraeus, passes through the central train station of Larissis in central Athens and ends up in Acharnai in the northwest, while the secondary line follows the layout of Attiki Odos from the aiport until Ano Losia. Keep in mind that you can go via suburban rail too to the neighbooring cities of [[Corinth]] and [[Chalkis]].

===By tram===

The new '''Athens Tram''' was inagurated in 2004 [http://www.tramsa.gr/index.cfm?lang_id=1]. While the network is rather limited, it's very useful for tourists and residents who want to commute between the city center and the coastal areas. There are two tram lines:
* '''Line 6 (T6): Syntagma – Nea Smyrni - Pikrodafni''' which connects the city center with Nea Smyrni and the coastal area of Palaio Faliro.
* '''Line 7 (T7): Piraeus (Agia Triada stop)– Palaio Faliro – Voula''' which connects the city center of Piraeus with the coastal areas of Palaio Falyro, Alimos, Elliniko, Glyfada and Voula. 

The integrated ticket costs € 1,20.

The trams run from 5:30 to around 00:30 on Sundays and weekdays. '''The operating hours are longer extene to 1:40 AM on Fridays and Saturdays'''. Always check in your local station about the hours of the last and first tram as the system is quite complicated. The tram is a great way to get from the city center to the coastal areas and commute between them, including the beaches of Palaio Faliro, Alimos, Glyfada and Voula. Remember that the tram is quite slower and has many more stops than the metro, so if you are heading towards the East Athens Riviera (Alimos, Glyfada, Voula) it would be a good idea to continue through the red line of the metro until '''Neos Kosmos''' and avoid taking the tram all the way from Syntagma. On the contrary, if you have time to spare the tram is much better for city viewing, so you should make that desision based mostly on your schedule. Same goes if you wish to go to Piraeus, where you should never use the tram if you hurry to catch a ship for example. If you intend on going to the east riviera beyond Voula (Vouliagmeni, Varkiza, etc) avoid the tram entirely. Instead, ride the red metro line until the terminal station of Elliniko and then take the public bus line 122 or a taxi. Using the tram to move through the riviera is a smart option though; for the most part of this route the train moves through the coastline on a seperate path thus avoiding the traffic-plagued Poseidonos Avenue. In addition, the view towards the sea is quite pleasant.

===By bus===

Athens is served by a network of diesel buses, natural gas buses and electric trolley buses run by the Athens Urban Transport Organisation [http://oasa.gr/]. As of 1st September 2014, there is no bus-only ticket. The integrated ticket has costs € 1.20 (€ 0.50 reduced). The Integrated ticket allows for multiple trips within 90 minutes and is available in most kiosks and all metro stations. Use a € 5,50 ticket (€ 2,70 reduced) to travel to or from the airport, which can also be bought from the airport bus driver (airport-bound buses only). It is cheaper than the Metro airport ticket. If you tend to stay for more than a week then a weekly pass for € 8,20 is the most cost-effective. It gives you unlimited rides on almost all public transit (bus, tram, train, subway) for 5 days. You only need to validate once, before first use. Buses will not stop unless you signal the driver by raising your arm.

'''Night buses'''. As of December 2019 the night bus routes are:
* '''X14''' Syntagma Square to Kifisia. (night only)
* '''11''' Ano Patissia – Neo Pangrati – Nea Elvetia (trolley bus).
* '''040''' Piraeus to Syntagma Square.
* '''500''' Piraeus – Kifisia (night only).
* '''X93, X95, X96, X97''' (the [[Athens#By_plane|airport buses]]).
*    790     Peristeri(Metro Agios Antonios) - Glyfada (night only) 

At the airport you can pick up a multitude of public transport maps, especially for buses, tram and trolleys that cover the whole of Athens, and parts of Attica like Sounio and other ports. These maps can be found in display stands. They are blue and marked with big Numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 in different colors.

===By taxi===

Canary yellow taxis are a common sight in Athens and are a reasonably priced way of getting around (if you can avoid the traffic jams). The starting fee is &euro;1, after which the meter ticks up at &euro;0.34/km ("rate 1") or &euro;0.64/km ("rate 2"), with a minimum fare of &euro;3.10.  Rate 1 applies through Athens city limits, including the airport, while rate 2 applies outside the city and from midnight to 5 AM. Legal surcharges apply for calling a cab by radio (&euro;1.60), trips to or from the airport (&euro;3.20) and heavy bags (&euro;0.32).  Tipping is not necessary, although it's common to round up to the nearest full euro and let the driver keep the change.

Taxi fare fraud is not as widespread as it used to be, but it still happens, so insist on the meter and have a rough idea on how much you are going to pay beforehand. If in doubt you can always ask your hotel or a local, they will likely give you a fairly accurate guess. At busy tourist locations cab drivers can try and con you with a set rate that is ridiculously high (e.g. €20 for a short trip). In these cases it is best to find another and again insist on the charge shown on the meter. If you feel you have been overcharged, ask for a receipt (they are obliged to give one) and take the plate number, then phone the tourist police to report the driver on 171. Advise your cell phone (through Google Maps or Apple Maps) to see if the taxi driver makes too many unecessary turns to increase the fare.

If you prefer taxi apps like Uber, the most popular one in Athens is [https://thebeat.co/ Beat]. Beat taxis charge the same official metered rates as any taxi you will hail on the street, but you get an estimate of what the ride will probably cost beforehand, you can avoid handling cash by paying through the app and the app watches wich routes the drivers are taking. All of the above make fraud less likely.

Be aware that the taxi drivers rarely obey all of the rules of the road. Expect that if you are leaving Athens on an early flight, that the driver will likely drive aggressively to get you there as quickly as possible. Most of them are experienced drivers so accidents are rare.

Taxis are considered as fairly cheap in Athens. As such you can expect to share the ride during rush hours if you can find one, and at night after the Metro has shutdown. As such if you hail a taxi which is already occupied (Free Taxis have a brightly lit TAXI sign on top of the cab) the driver will ask where you want to go to before he will let you in to join the other customers. Strikes by cabbies and public transit are common so be prepared and watch the local news.

===By car===
Driving a car in Athens can be a challenge for tourists. Many visitors to Athens have resembled the city's traffic with those of african cities. While this may be an exaggeration there is a grain of truth in it. Drivers are can be aggressive and reckless sometimes passing through intersections while the red light is on or driving drunk. Traffic jams are also a huge problem and can happen in major avenues and especially in the city center; sometimes even the highway connecting Pireaus with Kifisia can be absolutely packed with cars. Something important to note is that gas stations are not self-service in Greece like the states and other western European countries; you must wait with your car and let someone who works there serve you. While driving is not recommended, there are many international car rental companies in Athens like Hertz, Sixt, Europcar etc.

===By Scooter===
Riding a motorcycle is a good alternative if you don’t want to use a Metro and still avoid getting stuck in traffic. Scooters are popular in Greece and many people prefer this way of getting around, especially in the summer months. There are a few places in Athens where you can rent a motorbike and use it for sightseeing, just make sure to use a helmet since Greece does not have a good reputation for road safety.

===By bicycle===
Athens is certainly not the best city to go around with a bicycle, as it does not have the proper infrastructure. Very few bicycle paths exist and since most of them were made for political purposes they aren't really interconnected or practical. Cars tend to move quite aggressively in general and since sidewalks are small and crowded, bicyclers have no choice but to move near the edge of the road putting their lives in danger and frustrating everyone else. Nevertheless, you can use a bicycle if you want, but you will mostly enjoy it within certain areas. For example, the historical center is generally bike-friendly as it is car-free, though some streets are especially crowded. Also a new very good bike lane, from the city center to the Athens riviera is already in use. It starts from Thissio metro station, following the green metro line to the area of Faliro.<br>
Riding a bicycle in Athens in the main streets, has become lately some sort of a political (counter-)action, especially by younger people with an alternative lifestyle. Many Greeks don't view cyclers positively, as they consider them reckless. In any case, tourists are not advised to use a bicycle as a principal mean of transport, unless they are willing to cycle through the aggresive Athenian traffic. Small rides are safe though in the long network of pedestrian streets around the Historical Centre of the city and can be quite enjoyable indeed. For long distance rides it is recommended to use small side roads, mostly one way streets with less traffic and easy bicycling. The transport of bicycles in tram and metro are free of charge, so its easy to reach the nice mountain areas north of Athens from Kifisia metro station or the beaches of Athens riviera. Bicycles can be rented at many places, for short trips within the city center its easy to use [http://athens.easybike.gr/en EASYBIKE].

===On foot===
[[Image:Plaka_District.jpg|thumb|250px|Plaka District in Athens]]
Athens offers some of the best and worst urban walking in Europe. Several major streets have been recently pedestrianized, and a mostly car-free '''archeological walk''' which starts at Vasilisis Amalias Street, passes in front of the New Acropolis Museum, Acropolis, Herodion Theatre, Thiseio (Apostolou Pavlou Str), Ermou Street and ends at the popular area of Kerameikos (Gkazi) where numerous bars and clubs are located. Pleasant walking can also be had in '''[[Athens/Plaka | Plaka,]]'''  especially its upper reaches, and in much of '''[[Athens/Kolonaki | Kolonaki,]]'''  and the National Garden can provide a welcome respite from the heat and noise of the city center. On the other hand, Athens' horrendous traffic can make crossing the street in many areas a hair-raising proposition, and even walking down many major streets can be an unpleasant experience of noise and pollution. Cars and motorbikes parked blocking the sidewalks (illegal but ubiquitous) can also make a stroll difficult.  Fortunately, much of the traffic-plagued area of the city can be avoided by judicious use of the new Metro, which goes most places a visitor would want to see or to walk around in.

You can now visit the Acropolis, walk along the picturesque streets of Plaka or the hills around the Acropolis at your own pace, with i '''Pod Pocket tours audioguides'''. It’s informative and fun! They are available for rent at Athens Hilton Hotel, Sofitel Athens Airport, King George Palace and Baby Grand Hotel.

===Athens City Pass===
The [https://www.turbopass.com/athens-city-pass '''Athens City Pass'''] offers admission to Athens main sights, museums, tours and the public transport and features also further discounts. It covers a free and fast track entry to the Acropolis and a hop-on-hop-of bus tour around the city. The amount of sights included depends on the version (Mini, Classic and Complete) with Complete covering the highest amount of attractions of the three available options. The Athens City Pass Classic and Complete feature even a practical map and a travel brochure.

==Talk==
While Greek is the main language used in Athens, most Athenians speak English fluently and those in the tourist industry are likely to speak French and German too. Notices, menus and road signs are written in both English and Greek.

{{districtify}}

At first glance, Athens seems entirely to be composed of nasty, four- to six-story concrete buildings, lacking character and badly in need of a paint, but if you look beyond that, you will find little gems tucked in amongst the grey. The areas at the foot of the Acropolis, Anafiotika, Plaka, Monastiraki and Thissio are home to many wonderful Neoclassical buildings, trendy and traditional cafes and shops, narrow winding streets, and incredible views of the Acropolis. Little Greek Orthodox churches are tucked in amongst the concrete, often in the most unexpected places. These are usually beautifully decorated with icons and brass fixtures inside, but make sure you're appropriately dressed (no short sleeves or bare legs is a good rule of thumb, as a mark of respect).

* For the best views of Athens, head to the top of '''Lykavittos Hill'''. You can either walk from [[Kolonaki]] (the path starts 15 minutes from Evangelismos metro stop, and will take 30 minutes to talk up the winding, but paved and not steep, path) or you can take the funicular railway (€5 one way/€7 return) from the top of Ploutarchou Street in [[Kolonaki]]. Either way, be sure to wear flat shoes, and bring lots of water in the summer! From the top you can see the whole city, the port of Piraeus and, on a clear day, the island of Aegina and the Peloponnese. Have a drink at the cafe there, and pay a visit to the chapel of St George.

* If you're lucky enough to be in Athens for the Easter Weekend, you'll see the spectacular sight of hundreds of people making their candlelit way down the hill on Easter Saturday night as part of the Easter Vigil procession.

*There is a '''Unified Ticket of Archaeological Sites''' available at relevant sites that give one-time admission to five popular sites: the Acropolis, Temple of Olympian Zeus, Kerameikos, Roman Agora, Ancient Agora, and Hadrian's Library as well as Aristotle's Lyceum for €30 (€15 reduced). The savings is much more substantial in the summer (April 1st-October 31st) when attractions are full-priced whereas reduced prices are charged in the winter (November 1st-March 31st). If you're a student, almost all admission costs are halved; but the cards are properly looked at and one out-of-date won't pass. This ticket is good for ''five days'', but does not allow re-entry to a previously visited site; not all of the other sites offer the combined ticket, so make sure you first visit a site that sells the ticket-- the Acropolis, and Hadrian's Library definitely sell it. Tickets are not replaced if lost, so be sure to hang on to it until you have visited all the sites or after 5 days. 

*There is also a '''Unified Ticket of Museums''' which includes the National Archaeological Museum, the Epigraphic Museum, the Numismatic Museum, and the Byzantine & Christian Museum for €15 at full price during the summer, and €8 reduced or during the winter. The same rules apply for this ticket as for the Unified Ticket of Archaeological Sites besides that it's only valid for three days. 

*<see name="Athens Open Top Bus Tour" alt="" address="Departs: Syntagma Square " directions="" phone="" url="https://www.cityxplora.com/products/athens-open-tour" hours="90 minutes" price="€15.00" lat="" long="">If you wish to dedicate your sightseeing efforts to the centre of Athens then the standalone Athens Open Tour is just the ticket.

[[Image:AteneOlympieionDaAcropoli.jpg|thumb|The Temple of Olympian Zeus and Hadrian's Gate seen from the Acropolis]]

*The '''Acropolis,''' a '''Unesco World Heritage Site,''' [http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/404]  was the ancient fortified town of Athens, dating back to the Late Bronze Age, and the site of the best buildings of the Greek Classical age: the Parthenon, the Erectheion, the Temple of Athena Nike. Acropolis dominates the Athenian sky and symbolizes the foundation of modern culture and civilization. As the most famous landmark of entire Greece, Acropolis is the eternal symbol of democracy, education and inspiration. If you attend a university in the European Union, bring your ID and you can enter for free. The normal entrance price to the Acropolis and its slopes, including the Parthenon and the Theatre of Dionysus, is €20, or €10 reduced. Also be aware that although the Acropolis is open until 20:00 in the summer, the other sites have earlier closing times. If possible, get to the Acropolis early to avoid heavy crowds, and summer heat when relevant. There are two entrances, the lesser-used one starting near the new Acropolis Museum and allowing you to climb up through the Theatre of Dionysus, but this is a little bit more physically taxing as the climb can get steep. 
*The '''Ancient Agora'''— The site of the Ancient Agora in a very green space and a very beautiful view of the Acropolis. You will see the Temple of Hephaestus, the best preserved ancient Greek temple, the Attalos Stoa, the museum of the agora which is a reconstructed ancient building. From the agora you can walk towards Acropolis. Extension of the agora is the Roman Forum.
*'''Syntagma Square'''— Check out the Parliament building and the newly-restored Grande Bretagne Hotel. Also, catch the changing of the guards in front of the Parliament every hour on the hour. Their uniforms and walking style is fun to see but make sure you don't stand on the wrong side of them if you want to take a picture. If you accidentally do so, they will knock their gun and, as they are not allowed to speak, someone else from the guard will kindly ask you to change position.
*The '''Kerameikos'''— The site of the ancient cemetery of Athens. It also houses the Dipylon Gate, where the Panathenaic procession would begin. It has a museum showcasing many of the grave stele and other archaeological items found on the grounds.
*The '''Temple of Olympian Zeus'''— Only the ruins remain today. The column that has fallen and can still be seen on pieces was brought down during a thunderstorm about a century ago. The 1896 Olympic Stadium and Hadrian's Arch are located nearby,
*'''Panathinaiko Stadium'''— The stadium that housed the first modern day Olympic Games of 1896. Its an enormous, white, marble stadium, with a horseshoe configuration stadium.
*'''Lycabettus Hill'''— [http://www.lycabettushill.com] A 200m hill bordering the Kolonaki district. You can reach the top  by walking or by a funicular railway [7 euro]. There is a cafe-restaurant with a great view of Athens towards the sea. From halfway up looking towards the sea there are astonishing views of the Parthenon with the blue of the sea glimpsed between its columns.

===Museums and Galleries===
[[Image:Old Greek Parliament Athens.jpg|thumb|National Historical Museum (Old Parliament)]]

Because of its antiquity and influence, Athens is full of '''museums and galleries.'''  The major ones are the '''National Archeological Museum''' near [[Omonia]], the '''New Acropolis Museum''' by the [[Acropolis]],  the '''Benaki'''  and '''Museum of Cycladic Art''' in [[Kolonaki]], the '''Agora Museum''' near [[Monastiraki]], and the '''Kanellopoulos''' and '''Folk Art Museums''' in [[Plaka]].  Details of these and others will be found in the district sections.

====Arts and Culture====

The visual arts enjoy a big share in the Athenian cultural and everyday life. Next to big institutions such as the '''National Gallery''' and the '''Benaki Museum''', a big number of small private galleries are spread within the city centre and the surrounding areas, hosting the works of contemporary visual and media artists. In recent years a number of bar galleries have sprung up, where you can have a drink or a coffee whilst visiting an exhibition. 

*'''The National Art Gallery''' is located at Michalakopoulou Street, close to '''Evangelismos''' metro station and is one of Greece's main art institutions and features paintings and works of art from some of Greece's and Europe's best from the 19th and 20th centuries. Emphasis is given to popular Greek contemporary artists including Giannis Tsarouchis, Domenikos Theotokopoulos (a.k.a. El Greco), Theodors Vrizakis, Nikolaos Kounelakis, Nikiforos Litras, Konstantinos Parthenis, Maleas, Giannis Moralis and others

*'''The City of Athens Technopolis''', an industrial museum of incomparable architecture - among the most interesting in the world, has been transformed into a multipurpose cultural space. The centre has assisted in the upgrading of a historic Athens district and the creation of yet another positive element in Athens' cultural identity. Technopolis is located at '''Peiraios Avenue''' & Persefonis Street, right next to the Kerameikos metro station (line 3).

===Parks===
[[Image:National_Gardens.jpg|thumb|In the National Gardens.]]

'''Parnitha National Park''' has well-marked paths, gorges, springs, torrents and caves do the protected area. Hiking and mountain-biking in all four mountains remain popular outdoor activities for many residents of the city. '''The National Garden of Athens''' is a peaceful and beautiful park in the centre of Athens, where visitors can enjoy their walk and spend hours of relaxation. The Garden encloses luxuriant vegetation, plenty of flowers, some ancient ruins, two duck ponds and a tiny zoo, consisting of some parrots, ducks, geese, chicken, bunnies and goats. In addition, there is a children’s playground and a café as well. It's located between the Parliament and Zappeion  buildings.'''The landmark Dionysiou Aeropagitou street''' has been pedestrianised, forming a scenic route. The route starts from the Temple of Olympian Zeus at Vasilissis Olgas Avenue, continues under the southern slopes of the Acropolis near Plaka, and finishes just beyond the Temple of Hephaestus in Thiseio. The route in its entirety provides visitors with views of the Parthenon  and the Agora (the meeting point of ancient Athenians), away from the busy city centre.The hills of Athens provide also green space. '''Lycabettus''', '''Philopappos hill''' and the area around it including '''Pnyx  and Ardettos hill'''  are all planted with pines and other trees and they are more like small forests than typical urban parks. There is also Pedion tou Areos (Field of Mars) of 27.7 hectares near National Archaeological Museum which is currently under renovation.

===Disabled Access===
Most attractions in Athens offer free or discounted admission for disabled people living in the European Union (badge or card required). The discount is not advertised and you have to ask staff to get the information. You will also be offered assistance and lifts access if necessary.

==Do== 

Athens is a city that offers the tourist a great variety of activities to take part in, many of them quite unique and memorable. While it would be nearly impossible to make a full list of things to do in Athens, we offer below a look at eight of the most popular options:

*Attend the '''Athens and Epidaurus Festival,''' which runs from May to October (all summer long) and includes a wide array of events. There will be many musical, drama, and cultural activities, and you should not miss seeing a performance in the ancient theater located in Epidaurus. 
* consider picking up the [http://athenscard.com Athens card]. It includes tours, museums, the one day cruise and more, at a discounted price

*Relax on the more than 20 '''beaches of Attica.''' Most of them are located to the south of town, such as Alimos, Glyfada, Vouliagmeni, Varkiza, Anavyssos, Cape Sounion, and Legrena; but some also lie to the east, including Porto Rafti, Schinias and Marathon - Nea Makri Beach. Quite easy way to reach the beaches is also to take a tram from city centre. Use stops Edem, Batis, Flisvos, Kalamaki, Paralia Glifadas or Asklipiio Voulas to reach the sea.

*Watch a '''Greek basketball''' game. There are two teams in Athens, Panathinaikos and Olympiakos, that rank among the elite basketball teams in all of Europe. You can buy tickets to either of their stadiums right in town and get a taste of how basketball is played in modern Greece.

*Visit the '''Panatheniac Stadium''' in Athens. It was built in 1896 to host the first modern Olympic games and is still the place where the torch-passing ceremony is held before every Olympics. It was reconstructed from the remains of an ancient stadium and is made entirely of marble. The stadium is sometimes used to honor victorious Greek athletes, to hold musical and dance concerts, and for other special events, so you may have a chance to visit it — though it's hard to predict what event will be held there at the time.

*See the '''National Garden,''' a public park that covers 38 acres in central Athens, just behind the Greek Parliament Building. Not only is there abundant and diverse greenery and a relaxing environment, but the garden also contains ancient ruins, busts of famous Greek politicians and poets, a duck pond, a botanical museum, a cafe and a children's area.

*Volunteer at the '''Sea Turtle Rescue Society Archelon''' in Glyfada, in south Athens dictrict. You will have to work for free and at your own costs, but if you want a chance to see and take care of injured sea turtles, this is an opportunity to do so.

*Take a '''helicopter tour of Athens''' to get a panoramic view of such sights as the Stadium, the Acropolis, the Parthenon and the Port of Piraeus. The tour can last from a half hour to an hour, and you will see Athens in a unique way "from a bird's eye point of view."

*Take off from Athens on a '''ferry cruise of the Greek islands.''' You will visit sandy beaches, sheltered coves, and whitewashed island houses on such Aegean isles as Syros, Santorini, and Mykonos.

===Entertainment===


'''Theater and Performing Arts'''

*Athens is home to 148 theatrical stages, more than any other city in the world, including the famous ancient '''Herodes Atticus Theatre''', home to the Athens Festival, which runs from May to October each year. In addition to a large number of multiplexes, Athens plays host to a variety of romantic, open air garden cinemas. The city also supports a vast number of music venues, including the '''Athens Concert Hall''', known as the "Mégaron Musikis", which attracts world-famous artists all year round.

While exploring ancient ruins and viewing the scenic beauty of Athens may take up a good deal of your vacation time, the city also offers a wide selection of shopping opportunities. In general, you will find a large number of quaint shops selling specialty items like antiques, museum reproductions, embroidery, folk art and Greek-style snacks and drinks to keep you "well fueled" as you continue to shop.

To make it easier to know where to go for what, here's a brief overview of places to shop while in Athens:

*'''Malls and Department Stores''' While Athens has fewer shopping malls and large department stores than most other big cities, there are still a sufficient number. Some of the most famous establishments include: ''Athens Heart,'' a four-level mall containing 80 branded stores; ''Athens Metro Mall,'' with 90 stores carrying all major brands, 18 places to eat, five theaters, a supermarket, a bank, and a play area; and ''Attica,'' which is considered by many to be the most fashionable place to shop in the city.

*'''Plaka''', an area of Athens with an overabundance of souvenir shops, numerous vendors selling wares out in the street, and occasional street performers. It's a popular gathering place at night, and there is a great diversity of goods sold along the streets, which are lined with one specialty shop right after the other.

*'''Kolonaki''' which is the most renowned of all Athens' shopping areas. It has many "chic" outlets selling top brands, upscale coffee shops, expensive boutiques, and fur coats and gloves on display in its ''Syntagma Square.'' There are also some bargains on ceramic, clay or bronze handicrafts and a number of good stops where you can sample Greek "luxury food." You can also schedule an appointment with the fashion designer ''Christoforos Kotentos'' if you want to buy designer clothing.

*'''The Ermou Walkway''' a street open only to pedestrians that is lined with shops on both sides. There are many branded clothes for sale, especially women's clothes, and the price is generally lower than in ''Kolonaki.''

*'''The Monastiraki Flea Market''' in ''Monastiraki Square'' nearby the subway station. It is open every day, but Sunday is the day it gets especially crowded with bargain hunters. It's an open-air market that sells valuable antiques, unique souvenirs, and all manner of goods at all price levels. You can actually haggle over the price here without seeming rude, and the sheer size of the flea market means you can explore it for hours on end.

*'''Street Vendors''' in any part of town, but especially in ''Plaka'' and ''Monastiraki.'' Beware of forgeries, but there are also legitimate goods to be found. If the vendor seems to disappear whenever a policeman walks by, take that as a clue. There is no legality issue, however, with those selling fruits, nuts, and produce out of street carts.

==Eat==
[[Image:Plaka_Restaurants.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Restaurants (taverna) in the side streets of the Plaka district]] 

There are few things the Greeks are more famous for than their food, and Athens is considered one of the best places to find authentic Greek food. Tourists, as they wander from point to point, will want to stop and refresh themselves with some delicious Greek cuisine, but for many, the food itself is one of the main reasons for coming.

One "must-try" Greek menu item, so common it has been called the "Greek hamburger," is a '''souvlaki.''' Souvlakia are grilled kebabs of beef, lamb, pork or chicken that are wrapped in pita bread with tomatoes, onions and lettuce. They are dipped in a yogurt flavored with garlic and cucumber called "tzatziki." Many of the best souvlaki shops in Athens are found along ''Mitropoleos Street.'' '''Gyros''' (''ğyros'', "turn") is often preferred instead of souvlaki, and it is made out of chopped pieces of chicken or pork.

'''Street foods''' of various kinds are also popular. Look for ''koulouri,'' a sesame-seed bread ring, ''galaktoboureko,'' a custard-filled pastry with icing on top and ''tyropitta,'' which are a kind of cheese pie. 

There are also many unique restaurant types to try: in a '''psarotaverna''', you will find almost exclusively seafood; at a '''psistaria''', you will encounter mostly grilled meats; '''tavernas''' give you an informal and inexpensive (but authentic) Greek meal; '''mezedopolio''' offers a light meal of traditional hors d'oeuvre; finally '''estiatorion''' are the more expensive restaurants that serve full-course meals. Apart from those there are plenty of foreign cuisine places to eat as well. 

Greek food in general has an abundance of olive oil, fish, lamb and very distinctive spices. A full-course Greek meal should begin with bread, followed by ''mezedes'' (hor d'oeuvres) both hot and cold, such as mashed eggplant, caviar spread, ''dolmadakia'' (meat and/or rice rolled up in grape leaves), grilled octopus and deep-fried squid or zucchini. Cheeses are served along or before the mezedes, including both regional cheeses and the more common feta, kasseri, graviera and manouri. Salads of fresh vegetables or boiled dandelions will also be served with the mezedes. The so called "Greek salad" in Greece is known as ''choriatiki'' ("of the village"). Its main ingredients are fresh tomato, cuccumber, onion and feta cheese with olive oil and oregano (though green pepper, olives and caper are often added). An other very popular salad is ''lachano-karroto'', ("cabbage-carrot") made from julienned cabbage and carrot with plenty of olive oil, lemon and salt. Finally ''dakos'' is a Cretan recipe made from mashed tomato, olives and feta cheese with olive oil, all on top of thick barley rusks. Seldom is soup served as an appetizer, but some soups are full meals. French fries are found everywhere; they are served along with the appetizers or as a side dish.

Main dishes are usually casseroles, grilled fish, grilled meats or meat stews. For desert, look for ''baklava,'' a rich pastry with nuts and honey/syrup between the layers, ''kataifi,'' a delicate pastry with sweet syrup poured over it, or fresh fruits in the summertime. Also be sure to try Greek coffee and to specify whether you want it sugarless, sweet or semi-sweet when ordering.

Some recommended restaurants to visit in Athens include:

====Traditional - Casual====
*'''Trapezaria,''' just north of the National Garden, for traditional but seasonal Greek foods.

*'''Psarras''' in Plaka, which has been serving authentic Greek food since 1898 in a romantic setting near the Acropolis.

*'''Mavros Gatos''' serving small traditional dishes in Psyri

*'''Diporto''', a hidden cellar tavern below the bustling streets of Omonia, serving humble but excellent traditional day dishes

*'''Klimataria''', a traditional tavern near Omonia featuring a grape vine roof and live music

*'''Cafe Avissinia,''' a Greek tavern with oriental influences. 

*'''Tzitzikas kai Mermigas''' in Plaka, for modern Greek tavern food.

*'''Melilotos,''' set on a walking-only street only five minutes from Syntagma Square. You will find a different menu every day depending on which fresh ingredients are available.

====Fine Dining====

*'''Varoulko Seaside*''' in the beautiful Mikrolimano marina of Piraeus, widely acknowledged as the best seafood place in the Athens area.

*'''Dionysos Zonar's,''' a high-end Mediterranean restaurant in Philopappos Hill offering spectacular view to the Acropolis and the theatre of Herodes Atticus. One of the best ways to end your tour of Ancient Athens, especially during the summer.

*'''Twentyone Restaurant''', a modern french/mediterranean restaurant in Kifissia

*'''Nolan,''' two blocks away from Syntagma Square, is a modern Greek restaurant with Asian influences. It is owned by the famous Greek-Japanese chef Sotiris Kontizas, who became widely known as a judge in the Greek version of Masterchef.

*'''Blue Pine,''' old-style french cuisine restaurant in Kifissia

*<eat name="VASSILENAS Restaurant" alt="" address="Vrasida 13" directions="Hilton Hotel area" phone="2107210501" url="www.vassilenas.gr/en" hours="13.00-01.00" price="35-60€" lat="37.974724" long="23.750671">the oldest and Athenian restaurant established in 1920, offers creative award-winning Greek cuisine and more than 150 Greek wine labels. Winston Churchill and Sopfia Loren (among many other VIPs) have eaten here!</eat>

====Souvlaki - Gyros====
It should come as no surprise that souvlaki and gyros are by far the most popular street foods in Greece; their reputation has become global during the last decades. They are found together in restaurants called ''souvlatzidiko'' or ''gyropoleio''. Eating in one of those places is convenient, as the food is served very fast and can be eaten on the go, while the option to sit is always available. While they aren't particularly healthy, at the very least they are a much better option than global fast food chains; in addition they are very cheap. Souvlatzidika are extremely easy to find wherever you are in Athens, even in high-end areas. The best ones are usually around each neighborhood's centre, marked by a public square and shops, and they should look very busy during peak hours. The most famous ones however are those of Mitropoleos St between Syntagma and Monastiraki, namely '''Thanasis''', '''Savvas''' and '''Bairaktaris'''.

For more listings of restaurants, see the individual [[#Districts|district sections]], especially [[Kolonaki]], [[Plaka]] and [[Koukaki]].

==Drink==
[[Image:Dacapo_Athens.jpg|thumb|250px|Cafe in Kolonaki district]] 

*[[Traveller%27s diarrhoea]] is a concern shared by tourists everywhere and may compel them to buy bottled water. However, drinking bottled water is not essential because the tap water in Athens is safe to drink and has no undesirable flavours. Despite that, keep in mind that buying bottled water is a must in many other parts of Greece.

*Greeks love to socialize, and Athens buzzes long after its other European counterparts have laid their heads down to sleep. 20:00 is the earliest most Greeks will consider going to eat out, and you will rarely see someone clubbing before midnight. Note that many Athens clubs relocate to the beach during the summer months. Cafes spill onto the streets and the sound of lively conversation is everywhere in the evenings.

* Have a ''frappé'', the delicious Greek version of cold coffee. Being a Greek invention, it is absolutely nothing like the frappé you find in other countries of the world. Served sweet, medium, or without sugar, with or without milk. Delicious with Bailey's too.

*A 'club zone' is located in the coastal zone, running to the east- if you go there and you are lucky, you can actually get to listen to non-Greek music. There are also many clubs and pubs in the center of Athens.

* Go to the '''Psyrrí''' area (Monastiraki or Thisseio stop, Lines 1 and 3 and Line 1 respectively) for a number of smart bars and small clubs. It is the area immediately north of Ermou street between these two metro stops.

* The area north of Ermou street between Monastiraki and Syntagma has seen a considerably rise in the number and quality of bars during recent years. Aiolou and Kolokotroni streets both offer a fair variety of cafés and bars. All the bars on Karytsi square (a small square at the end of Christou Lada street, behind Klafthmonos square on Stadiou avenue) can get very busy on Fridays and Saturdays, with visitors having their drinks even on the streets outside from spring through autumn, when the weather is nice.

* The area around the Kerameikos station, called '''Gazi''' (Γκάζι, ''gas'') has been the gay village of Athens for quite a few years. Since the opening of the metro station, in 2007, the neighbourhood has attracted all kinds of crowds. This is a home to dozens of bars, cafés and clubs, gay or not, as well as to small theatrical scenes, the latter one especially to the northeast of the area, towards Metaxourgeio.

===Night life===

Athens is famous for its vibrant nightlife. The Athenians like to party and will do so almost every night of the week. The choices are plenty and they appeal to all tastes and lifestyles. In general, things get started pretty late: after 00:00 for bars and clubbing and after 21:00 for dinner at the city's tavernas, Athens Restaurants and bar-restaurants. Clubbing usually goes on past sunrise, but bars and clubs may choose to close earlier if they are low on customers.

Hip areas include '''Gazi, Psirri, Metaxourgio, Exarcheia, Monastiraki, Theseion and Kolonaki'''. Traditional Greek evenings can be spent in '''Plaka'''. A young group of locals have also started running a bar crawl through the most atmospheric areas in the city centre, stopping for drinks in a variety of neighborhoods combined with local ghost stories, called the Athens Ghost Crawl [http://www.athensghostcrawl.com/]

Until recently at '''Psirri''', some of Athens' hottest clubs and bars were to be spotted. During recent years '''Gazi''' has seen some tremendous change. Most of the galleries, mainstream bars, restaurants, clubs and Greek nightclubs here (featuring live Greek pop singers), are trademarked by their industrial design as many of them are housed in remodelled -- and once abandoned -- factories. Gazi is one of the trendiest neighbourhoods of Athens nightlife.  You can get there by metro line 3 at Kerameikos station.

'''Plaka - Monastiraki''' are two ancient, historic and all-time classic Athenian neighborhoods popular with visitors, they do not have many big dance clubs and bars, but offer lively, traditional places to enjoy Greek culture year-round as well as several rock and jazz clubs.

You will find plenty nightclubs with live Greek music along '''Syggrou Avenue''' and at the industrial strips of '''Iera Odos''' and '''Pireos Street''' in Gazi. In the summer months, the action moves to '''Poseidon Avenue''' and the coastal dictricts of '''Glyfada''', '''Voula and Vouliagmeni'''. '''Kolonaki''' is a staple dining and entertainment destination, catering to the city's urban working professionals who enjoy an after work cocktail at many of its bars that are open - and busy - until after midnight, even on weekdays. The clubs here are also very chic. '''Exarchia''' is where to go for smaller more bohemian style haunts that cater to artists and college students. At the foot of Strefi Hill is where you will find most of the bars and clubs, many of which play rock music. An alternative option of Athens nightlife.

==Sleep==
[[Image:Athens-Grande1.jpg|thumb|250px|Grande Bretagne Hotel, one of the most iconic hotels in Greece.]] 

You will find in Athens accommodation choices of every type: luxury resorts, 5-star hotels, budget hotels and even campgrounds. As Athens is packed with tourist from May through October, we suggest you book as early as possible.

===Budget===

  

Some of the safest and most centrally located Athens neighborhoods to stay in include the following:

*'''Psyri,''' with its eateries offering meze and live music, including rembetika (Greek blues). Here, you will find artisans, specialty stores, restaurants, bars, tavernas with or without live music, theaters, art galleries, antique shops, a small number of hotels and more. 

*'''Plaka,''' with its ancient streets and numerous restaurants, shops, and hotels. Here, you will find the ''Ancient Agora,'' the ''Roman Agora,'' the ''Museum of Greek Folk Art'' and more.

*'''Monastiraki,''' which has more antique, craft, and clothing shops than does Plaka. You will also find a gigantic flea market open on Sunday mornings.

*'''Syntagma,''' the tourist hub of all Athens, has many 5-star hotels, highly-regarded restaurants and upscale shopping opportunities. The Greek Parliament building, ''National Garden'' and ''National Historical Museum'' are also in the area. 

*'''Koukaki''' is more a "local" than a tourist zone, but it sits near the ''Acropolis'' and the ''Parthenon'' and has many local cafes on its streets and in its squares.

*'''Omonia''' is the location of several budget hotels, if you are not put off by its run-down appearance. You need to be prepared to look for food in other parts of Athens and exercise some precautions at night if you intend to stay here.

*'''Exarchia''' is away from the touristic fuzz but in the city center, a vibrant and safe neighborhood where mostly students and young people live. You will find many cheap-yet high quality restaurants, cafes and bars and every Saturday the largest Farmers' market in Athens takes place. Keep in mind that the area is highly politicized.

===Splurge===
For luxury hotels and resorts in Athens, these are considered among the best:

*'''Grande Bretagne Hotel,''' [http://hotelgrandebretagne.com-athens.com] considered by most to be the most luxurious hotel in Athens, is situated on ''Syntagma Square'' right in the middle of the tourist area and within easy walking distance of most major attractions. The spa, bar and rooftop diner are especially well rated. During state visits, nation leaders always choose the Grande Bretagne Hotel for their stay.

*'''Grand Resort Lagonissi,''' not in Athens but not far from it, is a top-level luxury resort set right on the beach. If you would rather "live" at the beach and make excursions downtown, instead of the reverse, this could be a viable option. Another option with the same basic set-up is '''The Westin Astir Beach Resort.'''

*'''Electra Palace Hotel Athens''', [https://www.electrahotels.gr/en/athens/electra-palace-athens/] is the number one luxury hotel in Plaka. It has a pool in the basement and on the roof, offers panoramic views of the ''Acropolis,'' has very well kept grounds, and accommodates families with large, triple-sized rooms.

* <sleep name="Hilton Athens" address="Leof. Vasilissis Sofias 46, Athina 115 28, Greece" phone="+30 210 728 1000" url="https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/athhitw-hilton-athens/"> The hotel is a taste of the familiar in the midst of the unfamiliar. It gives you spacious rooms, a pristine swimming pool, and staff that lives up to Hilton's reputation. It's 15 minutes from ''Syntagma Square'' and Plaka as well as nearby trendy cafes in Kolonaki. </sleep>

* <sleep name="Hellenic Vibes Smart Hotel" address="Agias Irinis 7, Athina 105 51, Greece" phone="+30 210 324 0504" url="https://www.hellenicvibes.gr"> Hellenic Vibes Smart Hotel in Athens, combines luxury and smart accommodation and is a true luxurious, urban refuge which offers lively facilities, minimalism as well as aesthetics on a budget and smart technology with a twist. It is located behind the doors of an impressive neoclassical facade of the 19th century, only a few steps from Monastiraki and Agia Irini Square. </sleep>

==Contact==

Greeks generally value their internet connection greatly, and there are many free wireless hotspots across the city. Wi-Fi internet connection is available at Syntagma Square, Kotzia Square, and Theseion. Recently, free internet access became available to a number of metro stations in Athens: Syntagma, Panepistimio, Omonia, Piraeus, Nerantziotissa and Doukissis Plakentias and even more stations will be added soon. Alternatively, you can go to one of the many internet cafés located in the center of the city. Many bars, restaurants, and cafes offer free wi-fi for their guests, while others will give you the password at the receipt.

Greece's mobile networks are second to none in terms of quality (one of the first countries to roll out LTE in Europe) and Athens is very densely covered. Prepaid connections from all major operators(Cosmote, Vodafone and Wind) are available in most stores and offer very reasonably priced voice and data packages; you will be asked to show a passport and have your details registered at the point of first purchase. Vodafone is the only one with an English-language application for cell phones. Public phones are found all over the city and phone cards are available from most kiosks.

There are some internet cafes around the city center and in the greater Athens area as well.

Greece's international code is +30.

While Athens is generally a very safe city, there have been reports of pickpockets on the Metro (especially at the interchanges with the line from Airport), buses and in other crowded areas, including Plaka. You will notice that natives travel with their hands on their bags and pockets and keeping their bag in front rather than on their side or back, which unfortunately is not without reason. You will probably be warned about pickpockets by hotel staff and friendly waiters, but this may be too late. Be extremely cautious and split all your documents, cards and money into different places. 
Street crime is rare; when it happens, it's most commonly purse-snatching from women walking away from banks and ATM machines.

Sometimes groups of street urchins loiter around the ticket machines at metro stations near the Acropolis and may try to cancel your transaction and snatch the returned coins while pretending to assist you. Be aware and prepared to fend them off. 

The "friendly stranger" [[Greece#Scams|bar scam]] has been reported from areas of central Athens frequented by travelers, including [[Omonia]], [[Syntagma]], and [[Plaka]]. Recently, there have been some reports of fraud. Usually, someone will stop you and ask for directions. A couple of other guys then show up claiming to be police, showing a badge (obviously a fake one). They ask if you were getting drugs from the other guy and then ask for your passport and wallet for verification. While you are busy trying to convince them that your passport is valid, one of them sneaks out some money from your wallet.

[[File:Screen Shot 2018-03-26 at 2.00.38 PM.png|thumb]]

Another danger recently reported, especially by travelers boarding the Airport Express Bus in Piraeus X96, and at metro interchanges, is pickpocket gangs operating buses used by tourists. As the bus is boarding, a large group traveling together will divide itself in two, with half of them going on board and then stopping in the aisle to cause a jam-up among passengers trying to board through the door behind them, the other half then offering to help the jammed passengers lift their luggage on board.  Just before the bus leaves, the half of this group on the bus gets off. Then, joining the other half outside the door, they all quickly disperse.

What has happened, of course, is that the passengers who were being "helped" with their luggage by some of this group were being pick-pocketed by others.  The theft is particularly effective because it's directed at travelers who are leaving the country and are thus not likely to report it - many victims don't realize they've been robbed until they get to the airport or even until after they get on the plane. Some travelers have claimed that certain bus drivers are party to these crimes by neglecting to open the rear door of the bus for boarding passengers, thus ensuring a tighter and more confused crowd of jammed passengers trying to board through the center door, making the criminals' job easier.

A variation to this on Metro and escalators is when a gang tries to block part of a group from exiting the train so that one or two members are left behind and separated, thus the group is split and distracted for them to steal valuables. The gang may also try to help/split the group into individual people by helping with the luggage or simply forcing themselves in between at the escalators. This way, the tourists are focused towards the person standing between them making sure he does not steal, while another gang member you may not have noticed before would be stealing items from the last person in the group on the escalator. It would be best to wear tight pocket pants with valuables in front. Carry all bags forward. Keep values out of reach or very low in the bag with a noisy plastic wrapper on the entrances to the bag, so anyone reaching in would make lots of noise, zip up everything and lock if possible, and avoid bags with smooth zips, so when the gang tries to open the zip, you would feel a movement.

You may also be approached by street vendors offering cell phones or other electronic devices at outrageously low prices. You are advised not to buy any of them: They are most likely either convincing fakes or stolen. If however you are in an urgent need for a phone and you do need to buy one from them, ask for the vendor to power on the phone and show you the menu screen. If the phone only shows the no-battery screen its likely to be fake; don't fall for it.

[[Image:Patission_Avenue.jpg|thumb|Patission Avenue, one of the busiest streets in Athens]] 

Athens is one of the most politically active cities in Europe. Demonstrations and riots are common and accepted as part of everyday life and democracy by most Athenians. Keep abreast of news of demonstrations, and avoid them if you don't want to run the risk of being arrested or tear-gassed.  

Anarchist and leftist groups often target police, government, embassies and corporate targets during the night. It is unlikely that tourists or civilians would be hurt, as the anarchists usually are careful to damage only property and not people. Nonetheless, parking by a government building, police station, bank or in the entire area of Exarchia could get your car damaged. In addition, avoid wearing clothes with the Greek flag or carrying Greek flag or other Greek national insignia, especially if you look like a local, since there are cases of anarchists attacking people because of that.

In addition, you should be aware that Athens has many stray dogs. Though the large dogs are almost always friendly, they may be alarming and unusual upon your first arriving into the city. Athenians feed and take care of them, and it is not unusual to see a shop owner offering plastic plates full of leftovers to the dogs on the street.* <see name="" alt="" address="" directions="" lat="" long="" phone="" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price=""></see>

Many Greeks are highly passionate about their sports clubs and there is hostility between the major football club fans. You should ''never'' wear a Panathinaikos t-shirt or hat in Piraeus greater area or an Olympiakos t-shirt or hat in the Ampelokipi, Zografou and Gyzi districts. It is advised to avoid wearing t-shirts or any other type of garments belonging to a Greek sport club in the first place.

===Areas to be careful===
Most of the information below will help you stay safe and better plan your visit during the '''night'''. The entirety of Athens including the areas mentioned below are relatively safe during the day, however stay alert for petty criminals like pickpockets, and of course, use your common sence.

While most Athenian neighboorhoods are perfectly safe and the city has a low crime rate compared to other European capitals, there are some areas of Athens that are sketchy and single-handedly raise considerably the city's total crime rate. Visitors accustomed to living in large urban centres will probably not encounter anything outside of their confort zone. However the reason why this is emphasized, is because Greece is generally extremely safe and this will likely make you gradually less alert. Also, in contrast to other European cities, most degraded and sketchy areas in Athens are part of the city center and close to the touristy districts of Syntagma, Monastiraki, Plaka and Kerameikos, so it is quite easy to end up in them if you start wandering around. Here's a rundown of the neighboorhoods:
*'''Omonoia''' - Omonoia Square and the areas around it are notorious around Greece. They used to be beautiful but since the late 1990s it has been degraded to a shell of its former self. During the day it's bustling with locals and tourists commuting to and from the city center (the area is a major transportation hub being served by two metro lines and countless bus and trolley routes). At night however it's better to stay on the main avenues and avoid going into dark, empty streets. Drug-dealing, prostitution, muggings and fights between gangs (mainly immigrants from Africa or Asia) do happen during the late hours of the night (drug dealers may be active even in broad daylight) outside of the main roads where police presence is lacking. The same goes for the neighborhoods to the immediate north like Plateia Vathis, the National Archaelogical Museum and Victoria with its adjacent areas (mentioned below) While you will find some hotels at very lucrative prices here, it would better to pay a little bit more for somewhere else.
*'''Victoria, Larissa Station, Agios Panteleimonas and Attiki''' - The adjacent neighborhoods of Victoria, Larissa Station, Agios Panteleimonas (Saint Panteleimon) and Attiki are in the direct north of Omonoia. They also host a very large number of immigrants from Asia and Africa and have a high crime rate, as well as drug addicts. These neighborhoods however form a very compact and densely populated region that makes policing very difficult, and are generally not visited by tourists, thus it would be a good idea to avoid them after dark.
*'''Exarcheia''' - The Exarcheia area is located north-east of Omonoia Square. It's a bohemic area that has suffered major degradation in recent decades and is home to anarchist and leftist groups. Many Greeks and especially those belonging to upper classes may present this neighborhood to be significantly more dangerous than it really is. In reality visiting Exarchia is generally safe and the area has many cool restaurants and bars, but pay some extra care at night. Anarchists are notorious troublemakers but you shouldn't worry as they rarely target civilians (and especially tourists). Avoiding the Exarchia police is a good idea; they are often hostile and inclined to treat people as suspects. Be especially careful during protests, when you might be beaten up and arrested without any provocation at all. Muggings are not common, but they occasionaly happen at Strefi Hill and behind the National Archaeological Museum. In general be a little bit more vigilant towards the south and west of the neighborhood, as you get closer to Omonoia and 28th of October St. (mostly referred as Patision St) There are drug dealers at Exarchia Square which may approach you to sell, just ignore them.
*'''Monastiraki and Psirri''' - This may come as a surprise as these areas are the tourist epicenter of Athens but the reason they are ranked on this list is because one should be really careful of his/her belongings as pickpockets and petty thiefs ran rampant here. While violent crime is rare and the area remains busy till late at night, try to avoid deserted alleyways at after-hours.
*'''Metaxourgeio''' is a degraded area, but mostly safe and increasingly popular. The area has many cheap brothels targeted for the common people and there are drug dealers and addicts present. Be aware of petty crime and exercise some extra caution at night, but otherwise you should be perfectly safe.
*'''Filopappou Hill''' - Filopappou Hill offers amazing views of the city but it's better to visit the hill and the surrounding area during the day as there have been reports of armed robberies on the hill at night. If you want a beautiful panoramic view of Athens at night go to the much busier and safer Lykavitos Hill.
*'''Northwestern Greater Athens''' - The Northwestern suburbs of Athens (Acharnes/Menidi, Liosia, Kamatero, Metamorfosi, Fyli, Aspropyrgos) are less densely populated and host many of the capital's company buildings, industrial yards and complexes. Their population is of lower income and some secluded areas are especially degraded with large Roma (Gypsy) population, where there have been occurances of attacks against passing car/truck drivers and muggings. While these areas are very far away from the city center and with zero points of interest, you may need to pass through Menidi to visit Mount Parnitha, a popular hiking destination. The road to Parnitha is safe and you will not encounter any trouble. However you are advised not to stray out of the route to the Mountain, especially during the night, and avoid unwanted attention.

===Embassies and consulates===
In general most embassies and consulates are located either in the area around Syntagma or in the affluent neighborhood of Psychiko, which is to be found about 1 km north of the Panormou metro station (line 3).

==Get out==

Athens is the primary entry point for international visitors of [[Greece]]. Thus, getting out of Athens is a typical way to visit most attractions of [[Greece]].

* <u>'''Greek islands:'''</u> During the summer (June, July, August), [[Greek islands]] are a must-go destination; the water is exceptionally beautiful and warm enough to swim. Also, a lot of touristic businesses (restaurants, hotels, nightlife) operate in the islands during this time. Boats depart from [[Pireaus]], [[Lavrio]] and [[Rafina]].
** <u>'''[[Saronic Gulf Islands]]'''</u>: These islands are within close proximity of Athens and can be suitable even for single-day visits.
*** [[Aegina]] is 40 minutes / 1 hour away from [[Athens]]/[[Pireaus]] via a boat. Huffington post named it "the most beautiful Greek island that you haven't heard of". In addition to enjoying the beach-type attractions, you can also find ancient Greek archaeological sites, such as the Temple of Afaia and the Kolona archaeological site. Aegina was also the first capital of the modern Greek republic (1826-1827). A lot of Athenians also visit [[Aigina]] on weekends throughout the year.
[[Agistri]] is 55 minutes / 1 hour away from [[Athens]]/[[Pireaus]] via a boat.
*** [[Hydra]] & [[Spetses]] are 2 beautiful, picturesque islands that are 1.5 and 1.75 hours away from Athens with a "Flying dolphin" (faster vessels) or 3 hours away via bigger boats that also carry vehicles.
*** [[Poros]] and [[Salamina]] are two other Saronic islands.
** <u>'''Aegean islands:'''</u> The most popular [[Greek islands]] are farther away, and it takes about 4-5 hours to reach them with a high-speed ferry and 6-8 hours with a regular boat. Nevertheless, you can also fly to them.
*** [[Santorini]] is frequently referred to by travel guides as '''one of the most beautiful islands in the world'''. The island offers a unique setting with stunning views and sunsets, as its main towns are located on top of a high cliff right next to the sea.
*** [[Mykonos]] is an Ibiza-like island that suits people seeking clubbing, posh or gay crowds.
*** [[Paros]] & [[Naxos]] are also popular destinations and you can visit them by doing island hopping, on the way to [[Santorini]].
*** [[Rhodes]] is also a very beautiful island with a lot of attractions, but it is essentially the farthest away from Athens.

* <u>'''Archaeological sites:'''</u> Several important archaeological sites can be reached via the bus service or a rented car:
** [[Sounio]] is at the tip of the Attica Peninsula, about 1.5 hours away from Athens by car. There you can find the ancient Greek temple of Poseidon, as well as beautiful coastal and sunset views.
** [[Delphi]] is an archaeological site where prophecies were revealed by Pythia. It was considered as the "center of Earth" during the ancient Greek era. It is about 2 hours away from Athens.
** In [[Epidavros]] you can find an amphitheater where ancient Greek tragedies were played. The amphitheater is admired for its exceptional acoustics. During the summertime, modern actors re-play ancient greek tragedies. Epidavros is about 2 hours away and it can also be reached by boat.
** [[Olympia (Greece)| Olympia]] is the site of the Olympic Games in Ancient Greece. It is about 3.5 hours away from Athens.
** [[Mycenae]] is an archaeological site reflecting one of the most important towns of the second millennium BC. It is about 1.5 hours away from Athens by car.

* '''[[Meteora]]''' is a unique site where Orthodox monasteries are built on top of almost inaccessible large natural sandstone rock pillars. Meteora is about 4 hours away from Athens by car.

* <u>'''Kessariani:'''</u> (9km from Athens city centre). There's a road beyond the bus terminus climbing up the verdant slope. After 3 km the Kessariani Monastery appears on the right. The serene monastery was dedicated to the Presentation of the Virgin; it is now deconsecrated. A recess in the outer wall of the monastery on the east side of the first courtyard contains the famous Ram's Head Fountain, a sacred spring in antiquity that was celebrated by the Latin poet Ovid in his Ars Amatoria. Ancient fragments dot the inner courtyard. In the Middle Ages, the 11C building on the left was the monk's bathhouse. The adjoining wing has a gallery at the first-floor level serving the monk's cells. The church is decorated with murals, those in the narthex date from 1682; Opposite the church are the convent buildings. Leave the Monastery behind and take the path up through the trees to a sanctuary. Fine views of Athens, Attica, and the Saronic Gulf. Continue up the road past the 11C Asteri Monastery. There are views of Athens and the Saronic Gulf as far as the Peloponnese to the west, and of the Attic peninsula (Mesogia), its eastern shore ad Euboea to the east. The summit is prohibited. 

* '''[[Albania]]''' Private bus operators offer direct connections to Albanian cities from Theodore Dilligianis Street near Metaxurgio Metro Station.  Bus Companies like EuroStar and Interline's offer direct overnight connections to the main Albanian cities of Tiranë, Gjirokastër, Berat, Shkodër, Saranda, Himare, & Korça. A one-way ticket to the UNESCO World Heritage city of Gjirokastër is 25 Euro and takes roughly 8 hours, departing Athens at 8pm and arriving in Gjirokastër at 4am. 

* You can visit the [https://www.archelon.gr/index_eng.php '''Sea Turtle Rescue Centre'''] in [[Glyfada]] from 11 am to 5 pm Saturday and Sunday or 1pm to 3pm on weekdays. Just take the tram to Glyfada and get off at Paleo Demario. 15-minute tours are offered for free but as the center is a charity staffed by volunteers they welcome donations.

* Byzantine Monastery of Daphni is a UNESCO World Heritage site, around 7 miles from Athens, and can be reached using the 811, 845 & 876 buses from the Agia Marina Metro stop. Ensure you alight at the Psychiatreio stop (stops are announced on the bus) as getting off at the wrong stop involves walking along a very busy road, which may result in the local police questioning what you are up to!
