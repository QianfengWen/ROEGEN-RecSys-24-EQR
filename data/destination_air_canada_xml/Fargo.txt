'''Fargo''' [http://ci.fargo.nd.us/visitor.htm] is a modern city of just over 100,000 on the Red River in the southeast corner of [[North Dakota]]. Many people relate Fargo  to the eponymous 1996 Coen Brothers movie starring Oscar-winner Frances McDormand and William H. Macy, though none of the movie was filmed in Fargo.  Neighboring [[Fargo/Moorhead|Moorhead]], [[Minnesota]] is across the river from Fargo and the area is generally referred to as Fargo-Moorhead. Fargo is the seat of [[Cass County (North Dakota)|Cass County]].

==Stay Safe==
Fargo is a safe city, with little violent crime, however, use common sense especially when it comes to personal property, just as you would anywhere else. The only area in which a person would need to be on the look-out is downtown on the weekends, especially during the school year. With the many colleges and bars it makes for an unpredictable experience.

==Contact==
There is free wireless internet access in the food court at the West Acres Shopping Center.

Most coffee shops and even a few bars also offer free wireless internet access.
