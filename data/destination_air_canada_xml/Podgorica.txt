'''Podgorica''' [http://www.podgorica.cg.yu/English/tourism/Eturizam.htm] is the capital of [[Montenegro]].

==Understand==
[[Image:AerialPG.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Aerial view of Podgorica]]
Besides being the capital of Montenegro, Podgorica is also the country's largest city, having a population of some 200,000 people. The city is situated in central Montenegro, in the scarce Montenegrin lowlands between Dinaric Alps and Skadar lake.

The Podgorica area has been continuously inhabited since the Illyrian and Roman eras, with settlement on the site of today's Podgorica being firmly established during Ottoman Empire rule. Podgorica was reincorporated in Montenegro in 1878, when the city started to take a more European shape. Nazi and Allied bombings during World War II destroyed much of the historical Ottoman and Montenegro-era Podgorica architecture, and city was reborn as the capital of Montenegro in Socialist Yugoslavia (SFRY). The city was then rebuilt and expanded in a manner typical of Eastern bloc countries, so it is mostly a modern planned city, and by no means a principal sightseeing destination. 

While not a typical European eye candy, the city is definitely worth visiting, owing to its interesting mix of old and new, its café culture and nightlife, and its laid back Mediterranean atmosphere. Both Montenegrin coastal cities and its mountain resorts are within one hour's drive from the city, so it is an excellent starting point for day trips to anywhere in Montenegro.

==Get in==

===By plane===

'''Podgorica Airport''' (LYPG/TGD) is situated 12 km (7.5 miles) south of Podgorica. It is a base for Montenegro Airlines, Montenegrin national carrier, which flies to major European destinations. For booking and flight schedule check the carrier website [http://www.montenegroairlines.com/active/en/home.html].For other airlines serving the airport, check the airport website [http://www.montenegroairports.com/eng/index.php?menu=&menu1=].

The best bet is to take a taxi to the city, as taxis are to be found in abundance in front of the terminal. Taxi rides cost a flat rate €12 to city centre as per July 2019, but this should be confirmed with the taxi driver in advance (or there's an Information desk in the airport who can tell you the current rate). As of 2019 it's still said €12 on the banners although you can easily get a cab no more than for 8€ or even less.
* '''Airport and City Transfer''' 
* '''Podgorica Airport Transfer and Taxi Service''' 
There is also a train stop "Aerodrom" a short walk from the airport. Much cheaper than the taxi, but its existence will be denied by staff at the airport information desk. As of March 2017 the departures from the airport are at: 06:07, 07:32, 09:54, 12:37, 14:57, 15:41, 17:44, 19:08 and 20:48.

===By train===

Train station is located near the city center.

There is regular passenger train service from [[Subotica]] through [[Novi Sad]] and  [[Belgrade]]. Train tickets are cheap, but quality of service is lower comparing European standards. There are overnight trains with sleeping cars for around &euro;25. Trains can be late but are a usual mean of transportation.Taxis will cost around €1,2 from train station to the center.

===By bus===

Bus station serves number of domestic destinations, as well as those in neighbouring countries.

The bus and railway station are located next to each other. City center is 10 minutes walk from there, but if you have any luggage - it's recommended that you either take a minibus(combi) or some of the taxis usually waiting at the station entrance.

Timetables (in and out) can be found on the Podgorica Bus Terminal website: http://www.busterminal.me/

===By car===

Due to its location in central Montenegro, Podgorica is the hub of all main roads in the country. Road from the northern Montenegro and [[Serbia]] requires additional caution during the winter.

==Get around==
* '''Walk''' - Podgorica is a medium-sized city of about 140,000 people. If Your accomodation is near the city center, or the "Preko Morače" district - all points of intrest could be visited on foot.

* '''Public transport''' - Public transportation consists of buses, that are not very frequent, and maps of the lines could be hard to locate. Ticket price is between €0.40 per single ride, and can be purchased on board, usually directly from the driver.

* '''Taxi''' - Probably the best option to move around Podgorica are cheap and reliable taxi service. There are over 20 taxicab companies, that usually operate new air-conditioned european sedans. Taxi stands are virtually everywhere in the city, but they could also be reached by calling the dispatcher. 

The fare is cca. 0.40€ per kilometre, and usually no start fare is charged. Considering the size of Podgorica - no drive within the city should cost more than €3 or €4. 

There is a Tesla Go App that works like Uber and allows you to take a electric car ride for ~3€/10 min within the city.

*'''Old Turkish town''' called "Stara Varoš" ("old town"), with its mosques and old clock tower. A typical old turkish "kasaba"(town), with narrow and curvy streets. Frankly, there are only few sights in this old town, in comparison with other cities in Montenegro.
*'''Skaline''' (the stairs) on the outfall of the Ribnica river to Morača, with its old turkish bridge over the Ribnica, and the ruins of old Nemanja's town.
*'''Monument to King Nikola''' in the park across the street from the Montenegro's parliament.
*'''Hercegovačka pedestrian street''' in the city centre.
*'''Trg Republike'''  the central square of the city, next to Hercegovačka street, a lot of life at the end of the day, when people finish to work. Lot of cheap restaurants and friendly people, a pleasant place to spend the first part of the evening.
*'''St. George's church''', built in 10th century, on the slopes of the Gorica hill (hill after which the city was named.)
*'''Millennium bridge''', the impressive new bridge over the Morača river.
*'''King Nikola's castle''', turned into a museum (closed on weekends), and the surrounding park.
*Newly built '''Hristovog vaskrsenja''' orthodox temple.
*'''Rimski Trg''', the square in the new part of town. Located near the orthodox temple, the square and the surrounding area is the home for the trendiest of Podgorica cafes and restaurants, and favourite meeting point for Podgorica citizens. 
* '''War memorial''' in the park on Gorica Hill.
* '''Church of the Holy Heart of Jesus''' is a modern, Brutalist concrete catholic church a little way out of the centre in the Konik district near the train station. It is probably the city's most interesting building. Be sure to visit when it's open as the interior is as surprising as it's uncompromising exterior.

==Do==

While in Podgorica, one can enjoy the diversity of Montenegro's capital cafes and restaurants, check out the nightlife, or take a walk at some of the favourite picnic locations of Podgorica citizens - Mareza, Skadar Lake, or Gorica hill. While strolling through Podgorica center, you might find the shopping area interesting, as there is vast number of boutiques, just beware the counterfeits!

Note that swimming in the Morača river might be a pleasant way to cool off in the summer months! The other option would be newly built open-air public swimming pools.

==Buy==

The currency in Montenegro is the Euro (€). ATMs are widespread in the city center and the new part of town. Upscale shops and restaurants will usually accept any major credit or debit cards.

If you are coming in from neighbouring tourist filled Croatia, the prices here will seem unbelievably low.

Streets in the center of Podgorica are filled with boutiques, yet, one should be aware counterfeited clothes of world famous brands. 

Most of the premium clothing brands have their stores in new part of the city, chiefly Vectra-Maxim neighborhoods. The prices are on par with those in the region.

There are a few shopping malls in Podgorica, most notably Delta City, a 48,000 sqm mall with over 70 stores, food court and a multiplex cinema, and Mall of Montenegro. There are also smaller malls, such as Bazar, City Mall, Forum, ''Palada'' and ''Nikić Center''.

Open markets on the outskirts of the city are a place to buy very cheap clothing, often of low quality.

Touristic post cards can be found in most bookstores around the city.
