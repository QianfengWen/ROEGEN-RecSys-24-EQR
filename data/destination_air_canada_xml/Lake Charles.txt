{{pagebanner|Lake Charles Banner.jpg}}
'''Lake Charles''' [http://www.visitlakecharles.org/] is in the [[Acadiana]] region of [[Louisiana]] and is well known for gaming and the great outdoors, culinary delights and rhythm and blues. There are over 75 annual festivals from the splendor of Mardi Gras to the swashbuckling days of the Contraband Days Pirate Festival, there is something going on nearly every weekend. 

==Understand==
For years, Lake Charles has been a gambling destination primarily attracting tourists from nearby Houston and New Orleans. Since casino gambling is illegal in Texas, many residents come to Lake Charles. Having casinos since the 70s, the L'auberge du lac impacted the region as the first full service resort in the area. Since then, the Golden Nugget opened, adding another full service resort. Lake Charles remains as having 5 casinos considered to be in the area (L'auberge, Golden Nugget, Isle of Capri, Delta Downs, and Coushatta).

While gambling is the primary tourist attraction, many visitors enjoy shopping and dining during the stay.

==Get in==

===By Plane===
'''Lake Charles Regional Airport''' ({{IATA|LCH}}) [http://www.flylakecharles.com] is located just south of Lake Charles. Car rentals are available at the airport, as well as taxi service. Service includes multiple daily flights to both Houston and Dallas/Fort Worth, via United Airlines and American Airlines respectively. From there, you can connect to many destinations across the world.

For many travelers, it would make sense flying to '''George Bush Intercontinental Airport''' ({{IATA|IAH}}) [http://www.fly2houston.com] or '''William P. Hobby Airport''' ({{IATA|HOU}}), both in Houston and drive the 2 hours or take a bus or train. Both airport feature domestic flights all across the United States as well as international flights to every inhabitable continent.

===By Bus===
Greyhound [http://www.greyhound.com]] offers bus service to Lake Charles. The station is located on interstate 10 and Shattuck St. From there you can hail a cab to your hotel.

Many charter bus companies offer trips to Lake Charles that offer bus service that drop you off direct to the casinos. The trips are all throughout the day, so you can access the casino without having to book a room, and return the same day. The companies offer packages that include casino chips as well as food vouchers, etc. For a listing of charter companies and routes, visit the casino you would like to visit's website.

===By Train===
Amtrak's Sunset limited line makes a stop in Lake Charles.

===By Car===
Lake Charles is accessed via Interstate I-10, which runs through major cities such as Houston, New Orleans, and going all the way to Los Angeles and Jacksonville, Fl. Some casinos are located right off of I-10. To get to L'auberge du lac or Golden Nugget, you merge onto Interstate I-210.

==Get around==
Depending on where in Lake Charles you are located or are trying to get to, different modes of transportation are fit for each other. Yellow Cab Lake Charles (337-433-8282) is a 24 hour taxi service that is convenient when you would rather not drive, or aren't familiar with the area.

Ride-sharing by Lyft is available in Lake Charles.

Public transit is available but routes are limited and service is from 5:45 am to 5:45 pm weekdays only.  

Between the Golden Nugget and L'auberge, there is a complimentary trolley that runs between the two casino resorts. The resorts are still, however, within walking distance, and can be accessed through the casino boardwalk.
