'''[http://www.katowice.eu/en/ Katowice]''' (pronounced ''Kah-toh-veet-seh'') is the capital and largest city of [[Silesian Voivodeship]], [[Poland]]. The largest urban center in the Silesian Metropolis, Katowice stands with a population of over 300,000 in the city itself, and over 2.1 million in the surrounding metropolitan area. Located in the middle of the province on the banks of the river Rawa, Katowice's historical importance as Poland's main industrial centre has been indisputable for decades. Once synonymous as a crushingly gray industrial city, contemporary Katowice has expanded to become a vibrant cultural and business center, with the Silesian Philharmonic, the Silesian Museum, and its famous flying saucer-shaped concert hall, the Spodek, calling the city home. Intrepid visitors will find an interesting city with charming secessionist architecture from the early 1900s, historic reminders of the German and communist past, stunning modern architecture, hospitable and proud local people, and easy access to the Beskid Mountains and other neighboring communities. One of the hidden gems of Poland, Katowice especially delights the senses in April with its numerous flowering lilac trees. 

==Understand==
Katowice sits at the intersection of major road and rail routes connecting Poland to the rest of Europe in all directions, making the city relatively easy to get in and out of. Until recently, the dominant economic sectors in the region were mining, steel, electrical machinery, electronics, and chemicals. Due to economic and political changes in the last three decades, this situation has changed dramatically, with heavy industry giving way to the commerce, tourism, trade fair and service industries. 

===History===
[[Image:Katowice - ul. 3-go maja 15 i 17.JPG|thumb|right|Downtown Katowice.]]
The origins of Katowice date to 1397 when the settlement of Kuźnica was founded. Katowice was first mentioned as a village surrounded by dense forests in 1598. In the 18th century, numerous work colonies sprang up in the region, and by 1769 and 1770, the Prussian Duke of Pless established an underground coal mine in the area. The next industrial sites were the Hohenlohe steelworks in the village of Wełnowiec, founded in 1805, the Baildon steelworks in 1828 (named after their founder, a Scotsman), and the Wilhelmina zinc works in 1834. 

Situated in the Upper Silesian Province of the German Empire, Katowice (then known by its German name, ''Kattowitz'') achieved the status as a county town in 1873. By 1897, Katowice further grew after being crafted into a separate urban district, which also included the suburban municipalities of Bogucice, Zawodzie, Dąb, Wełnowiec and Załęże.

In 1889, one of the largest companies in Upper Silesia, the Kattowitzer Aktien-Gesellschaft, was set up with its headquarters in the city. As a result, major insurance companies and large-cap banks were attracted to Katowice. During the First World War, the steel industry continued to develop at a frenetic pace. Rail connections were also developed during this period, connecting the city throughout the German Empire and with neighboring Austria-Hungary. 

In the aftermath of World War I, discontent with Katowice's Polish population with German authorities reached a boiling point. Beginning in 1919, Polish armed insurgents launched a series of uprisings against Weimar Germany, encouraged on by the newly-independent Second Polish Republic. After the Third Silesian Uprising in 1921, the most successful of all the rebellions, Katowice was annexed by Poland as part of Silesian Voivodeship under the terms of a German-Polish peace treaty. The Polish government gave the province considerable autonomy, with Katowice serving as the provincial capital and home of the Silesian Parliament. Between 1922 to 1939, Katowice experienced massive industrial and population growth.

In 1975, the neighbouring municipalities of Piotrowice [http://www.piotrowice.katowice.pl], Ochojec, Panewniki, Kostuchna [http://kostuchna.boo.pl], Wełnowiec, Szopienice, Giszowiec, Dąbrówka Mała and Murcki were merged with Katowice. Construction works further commenced within the city center. The main communications artery (al. W. Korfantego) was widened and old industrial buildings to the west of this road were demolished. To the east, the historic Tiele-Winckler Palace was also demolished. In the market place, old buildings were replaced by modern shops, including Zenit, Skarbek, and also the Dom Prasy.

The construction of the flying saucer-like Spodek between 1964 to 1971 had a significant impact on the city. The Millennium Housing Estate on the border of Katowice and Chorzów, along with the Paderewski Estate to the east of the city, the Południe Estate in the suburbs of Kostuchna, Piotrowice, Ligota [http://www.ligota.info], and the Roździeński Housing Estate all contributed in shifting the character of Katowice to an ideal, urban socialist workers city. The fall of communism in 1989 and the economic changes that followed would significantly alter the city again towards the end of the 20th century.

Currently, Katowice is going through yet another transformation, complete with a massive refurbishing of the city's historic downtown core, new investments in buildings and transportation, and a large burst of growth in the service and commercial industries.

Although Katowice is not blessed with an ancient historical core like [[Kraków]], [[Wrocław]], or [[Zamość]], the city does contain enough attractions to draw in visitors. Thanks to massive revitalization projects in the city center in recent years, Katowice has started to lift its notorious reputation as a industrial gray landscape. Some of finest examples of Modernism (both International Style structures and Bauhaus-inspired buildings) are easily found in the downtown Śródmieście district.

==Work==
===Business===
[[Image:POL Katowice - Skyscrapers in Katowice.jpg|thumb|Office buildings in central Katowice.]]
The [[Silesia]] region (particularly Katowice) is a major business center of [[Poland]]. As [[Silesian Voivodeship]] is the main industrial hub in the country, its economy was primarily focused on coal, metallurgy, energetics, and chemicals in the recent past. Nowadays, it is converting to a more modern profile, including services, information technology, and conventions. Most of the city's iconic industrial works are located outside of the city in the surrounding region, while corporate offices are beginning to populate Katowice's core.

There are several institutions supporting the development and economic growth of the Silesian Metropolis:
* '''The Katowice Special Economic Zone''' [http://www.ksse.com.pl/index-eng.html]
* '''Upper-Silesian Regional Development Agency''' [http://www.garr.pl/]

There is also a company-organizer for the numerous trade shows and fairs in Katowice:
'''International Katowice Fair''' [http://www.mtk.katowice.pl/en_index.php]

==Stay safe==
Katowice is generally a very safe city to stay in, and should not cause concern for visitors. In previous years, the rail station was a magnet for petty thefts, although since its refurbishment and expansion, this has considerably decreased. As in other European cities, people should keep their wits, particularly in crowded places.

* Important phone numbers: police: '''997''', fire department: '''998''', ambulance: '''999'''; all three share the common universal number '''112'''.
* Municipal guard: +48 32 986 
* Watch out for pickpockets in public transport and busy places. 
* Park your car in a safe place, in an attended guarded parking lot if possible. 
* Most long-distance trains have compartments, choose the occupied ones so you don't ride alone. During night travel, make sure that at least one person is not asleep.

===LGBT Tourists===
Katowice as other big cities is LGBT friendly and couples showing public affection won't catch anyone's attention but stay cautious and discrete while visiting it after dusk (especially side streets). Staying discrete in big blocks of flats settlements as Tysiąclecie or Gwiazdy is recommended. Katowice, as many bigger Polish cities, hosts an annual pride march (''Marsz Równości''). There's a naturist beach on Staw Starganiec (on border with Mikołów).

==Cope==
Katowice has not entered the common European tourist lexicon yet, meaning that English is not as universally spoken as in other tourist-heavy areas of Poland like [[Warsaw]] or [[Kraków]]. However, visitors will be more than able to get around and pantomime to be understood. Thankfully for English speakers, English can be widely understood by many younger Poles below the ages of 30 to 35. Older Poles may potentially have some knowledge of [[Russian phrasebook|Russian]] or [[German phrasebook|German]]. Related Slavic languages, such as [[Czech phrasebook|Czech]] and [[Slovak phrasebook|Slovak]], are also partially understood, albeit with several humorous differences. The easiest way for tourists to avoid any potential language problems would be to learn a few key [[Polish phrasebook|Polish words and phrases]], a fact that will not be lost with Katowicians.

==Get out==
Because of Katowice's excellent transportation links, major tourist attractions in southern Poland are not far away, making the city a good base to explore (or get away to) other locations in [[Silesian Voivodeship|Silesia]] and the neighboring province of [[Lesser Poland Voivodeship|Lesser Poland]]. Additionally, the border with the [[Czech Republic]] is also within easy reach.
