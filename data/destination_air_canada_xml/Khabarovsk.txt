{{pagebanner|Khabarovsk Banner.jpg}}

'''Khabarovsk''' ([[Russian phrasebook|Russian]]: Хаба́ровск, ''khah-BAH-ruhvsk'') is a city on the Amur river in the [[Russian Far East]], near the [[China|Chinese]] border. Often overlooked due to its proximity to [[Vladivostok]], Khabarovsk could easily be a highlight in the long line of predominately dull cities along the Trans-Siberian. But while most cities look their best when the sun is out, only in few is the effect as profound as in Khabarovsk – attractive parks, beaches, outdoor beer tents with live music, and classic architecture awaits if the weather gods favour you.  Even if you are unfortunate, it's not a loss to go indoors: the city also houses some of the best museums east of Moscow.

Overlooking the confluence of the Amur and Ussuri Rivers, Khabarovsk is the second largest city in the [[Russian Far East]], approaching 600.000 residents and growing.  It is also the capital of both [[Khabarovsk Krai]] and the [[Russian Far East|Far Eastern Federal District]].  Unlike Vladivostok, the city has never been closed to foreigners, and retains a distinct international feel, rare for the Russian provincial centers – a feeling propped up by an increasing Asian presence with arrivals from Asian countries now numbering over a million each year. In turn, Asians come here to experience a piece of Europe close to home, with the fortunate effect that the city is spending huge sums of money renovating. Old classical buildings were spared much of the destructive effects of the 1917-23 civil war, and provide visitors with a taste of the past. From a European's perspective, Soviet city planning has unmistakeably taken its toll, but it ''is'' still far more attractive than your average Siberian city.

}}
The climate is temperate and monsoonal, with a cold, dry winter and a hot and humid summer. The average temperature for a full year is  just 2°C, but covers over wide span of monthly averages ranging from a bone chilling −20°C in January to a quite warm +21°C average in July. The city sees an average of 686 mm precipitation in a year, but unfortunately the lions' share falls in the warm summer months. The number of sunny days per year is 70, which is higher than Moscow's 54. Climate-wise, end of May - early June or end of August - early September are the best time for a visit.

=== History ===
[[Image:Khabarovsk Duma.jpg|thumb|250px|The Former city Duma is one of the oldest buildings in the city]]
The lands near the confluence of the Ussury and the Amur, where today's Khabarovsk stands, have been populated for centuries by the indigenous Tungusic people.  Chinese expeditions reached this area as early as the first half of the 15th century, and in the mid-17th century the Amur Valley became the scene of hostilities between the Russian Cossacks, trying to expand into the region, and the rising Manchu Qing Dynasty, bent on securing the region for itself.  Nearly a century of skirmishes between the Chinese, Koreans and Cossacks followed, one of those involving Russian explorer Yerofey Khabarov, whose name the city later adapted.  The Treaty of Nerchinsk (1689) brought the conflict to a close and made the area an undisputed part of the Chinese Qing Empire. According to French Jesuits mapping the Ussury and the Amur rivers in 1709, the future site of Khabarovsk was known to the Chinese as Yupi Dazi ("Fishskin Tartars"). 

In 1858, the area was ceded to Russia under the Treaty of Aigun. The Russians founded the military outpost of Khabarovka (Хаба́ровка), which subsequently became an important industrial centre for the region.  The Russian Geographical Society then began founding libraries, theaters, and museums in the growing city. Since then, Khabarovsk's cultural life has flourished. Much of the local indigenous history has been well-preserved in the Regional Lore Museum and Natural History Museum and in places like near the Nanai settlement of Sikhachi-Alyan, where cliff drawings from more than 1,300 years ago can be found. 

The Trans-Siberian first reached Khabarovsk from Vladivostok in 1897, while the complete railway to Moscow did not see completion until 1913.   Three years later, the Khabarovsk Bridge across the Amur was completed, allowing Trans-Siberian trains to cross the river without using ferries. The city was occupied by the Japanese for much of the Russian Civil War, which may offer some explanation to the many old buildings still standing around the city center.

==Get in==

===By plane===
'''Khabarovsk Novy Airport''' ({{ICAO|UHHH}}, {{IATA|KHV}}) –
With the more than 1.8 million passengers per year Khabarovsk's airport is the leading airport of the [[Russian Far East]] which gradually becomes the regional hub for air traffic. Also the Novy Airport is a refueling and emergency landing point for polar flights between North America and Asia. 

The airport is split to two terminals - Domestic and International one with 2-3 minutes walking distance between them. All public transit are located near the International Terminal. While taxi can be found in abundance at both terminals.

The main carrier in the region is Russian flag-carrier Aeroflot, followed by Transaero, S7 Airlines, Ural Airlines, Asiana Airlines, China Eastern, China Southern and a number of a regional airlines. With Aeroflot and S7 being the members of SkyTeam and Oneworld list of possible destinations (through a code-sharing flight) extends to the whole South East Asia. 

*Domestic flights are from [[Moscow]] (Domodedovo, Sheremetyevo), [[Yakutsk]], Blagoveschensk (Ignatyevo), [[Anadyr]] (Ugolny), [[Magadan]] (Sokol), [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky]] ( Yelizovo), [[Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk]], [[Vladivostok]], [[Chita]], [[Irkutsk]], [[Ulan-Ude]] (Mukhino), [[Krasnoyarsk]] (Yemelyanovo), [[Novosibirsk]] (Tolmachevo), Neryungri, [[Okha]], [[Nogliki]].

*International flights are from [[Japan]] - [[Tokyo]] (Narita Int.); [[South Korea]] - [[Seoul]] (Incheon Int.), [[China]] - [[Beijing]] (Beijing Capital Int.), [[Harbin]] (Taiping), [[Jiamusi]]; [[Hong Kong]] (Hong Kong Int. Kai Tak)

=====Transfer to city=====

Several public transit options available:

* '''Taxi.''' If preordered the average ride to the city center would cost you around 300 RUB (with baggage included in the rate), though on site prices might be as high as 1,000 RUB (especially if arriving at night when no other options available).
* '''Bus.''' Bus 18 serves the southern neighbourhood and bus 35 - the northern one, so if you are staying in the central location you would better take a trolleybus otherwise you would need to change a bus somewhere halfway. Fare 20 RUB.
* '''Trolleybus.''' Trolleybus 1 takes you to the Amur embankment via Lenin Sq making it the cheapest way to the city center. Look for the trolleybus wires next to the International Terminal to locate the stop. Fare also 20 RUB. For both buses and trolleybuses conductors sometimes will try to charge you extra 20 RUB for every big (>55cm in length/height) piece of baggage which is legal though rarely practiced relatively to Russians.  
* '''Marshrutka.''' Small-sized buses operated by private licensed drivers. Faster than buses and trolleybuses though much less space for baggage. Fare 20 RUB paid to the driver. Try marshrutka 60 for the Amur embankment (repeats trolleybus 1 route) or marshrutka 80 to the riverside station which is also a central location.

===By train===
[[Image:Khabarovsk_Railwaystation.jpg|thumb|250px|Khabarovsk Railway station]]
''Wikitravel has a guide to [[Trans-Siberian Railway]].''

Khabarovsk railway station, listed in most train schedules as ''Хабаровск 1'', is a major stop on the Trans-Siberian Railway. There are several trains each day bound for [[Vladivostok]] (800 km) and [[Moscow]] (about 8500 km) along the main Trans-Siberian line. Other options include trains 035 or 386 to [[Blagoveshchensk]], 325 for Tynda, 667 for [[Komsomolsk]], 943 for [[Vanino]] - all on the [[Baikal-Amur Mainline]]. 

[[Vanino]] is an interesting option as it allows ferry connections to [[Sakhalin]] and further on to [[Wakkanai]] in [[Japan]] – see more details in the [[Russia to Japan via Sakhalin]] itinerary.

===By boat===
If you want to go to places along the Amur river the '''Meteor speedboats''' will often be your transport of choice but only during the navigation period (usually May to mid October). In 2008, however, the water level in the Amur was at a historic low, so that the river traffic was disordered. If operated normally you can consider these options:
* Go some 1,000 km downstream to the Ul'chi municipal district, a region mostly inhabited by indigenous Ul'chi people. 
* There are up to five daily hydrofoil services to a shopping-city satellite Fuyuan in bordering [[China]], departing from the ferry terminal facing the Amur river.
* If you are heading for the [[Baikal-Amur Mainline|BAM line]] up north, an interesting option is to take a hydrofoil cruising up the Amur river to [[Komsomolsk]] (6 hours), and catch a train from there.

==Get around==
[[Image:Banknote_5000_rubles.jpg|thumb|250px| The bridge across Amur river on the 5000 rubles banknote]]

There are two kinds of public transit in Khabarovsk - municipality-owned and private. All trams and trolleybuses are operated by local transit authority, marshrutkas are all private, buses are split between the two. While maintaining the same fare several differences can be noted. Firstly, municipal vehicles have a timetable which can usually be found at the bus stop while private buses do not and stop circulating when it gets unprofitable. Secondly, municipal transport tends to get more crowded (especially true for trams) as it allows certain categories (mainly pensioners) to travel at a preferential tariff. And thirdly, while having no timetables, private vehicles drive considerably faster, with some of the marshrutkas violating the city-bound 60km/h speed limit. 

Note that starting 2013 all public transportation operators were ordered by the Russian government to equip their vehicles with GLONASS systems (Russian GPS analogue) and report their locations to Russia’s transport supervision agency. Thus you can check all vehicles currently en route '''online''' [http://bus27.ru] 

=== On foot ===
Khabarovsk is a relatively compact city, making it a walker's delight and at times being the quickest method of transport. The best thing to start with is to walk around the central part of the city. Have a nice walk from Lenin Square to the Amur River via the main street, Muraviev-Amursky. Here you will find all sorts of shops and places to eat. The journey takes around 15-20 minutes. Other important tourist locations within the city center can be reached on foot too.

=== By tram / trolleybus===
The city has a network of six tram lines (Lines 1, 2, 5, 6, 8 and 9). The most useful section for visitors is the stretch of the network running from the main railway station along Amursky Boulevard, before making a left turn up Sheronova St. and crossing Muraviev-Amursky St. just one block west of Lenin Square, then it continues south intersecting Lenin Street roughly at its halfway point, two more stops bring you to 'Dendrarium' botanical gardens (all lines except Line 5). The remainder of the network mainly extends into the sleepy suburbs. Line 5 serves the North from the main railway station. 20 RUB fare paid to a conductor. Keep your ticket until the end of the journey.

Trolleybus network accounts for 4 lines. Lines 3, 4 and 5 connect southern city district Sudoverf with Komsomolskaya Sq, airport and main railway station respectively, while Line 1 has a connection between airport and Komsomolskaya Sq. (River promenade, Museum cluster). Same 15 RUB fare.

=== By bus ===
{| 
|-
| style="vertical-align:top;width:50%;" |

The most useful is the bus 1, which runs a circle line along the city center. It originates from the Railway station, turns down Seryshev St.(one block north of Amursky Boulevard) until it reaches the river park at Lenin Stadium, then turns down Komsomolskaya St. (and Komsomolskaya square) and runs south until Lenina St. It then runs the entire length of Lenina St. and returns to the train station. The route 1 travels both clockwise and counterclockwise. See the above-mentioned website for the routes on the interactive map.

=== The Far Eastern Museums ===
There is a fantastic cluster of top notch museums along Shevchenko Street, just behind the tall blue-domed Church of Theotokos on Komsomolskaya Square towards the river and stadium. Not only are the museums some of the best in the far east, they also make their home in some impressive century-old buildings dating back to before the revolution. After a visit, the nice river promenade is just a short walk away, so you can wash all that new found knowledge away with some pivos in good company.

*<see name="Far East Regional Museum" alt="Хабаровский краеведческий музей" address="11 Shevchenko St" directions="" phone="+7 (4212) 312 054" url="http://www.museum.ru/xkm/english.htm" hours="10AM–6PM" price="300 rubles" for foreigners lat="" long="">One of the oldest museums in the Russian far east, laid out in 6 sections in an impressive 1894 red-brick building. For the most part it's leaps and bounds ahead of the region's other museums, and with nearly half a million artifacts in the collection, they can afford to be picky about what they display. The ethnographic section with displays of indigenous cultures from around the Amur is unusually informative, but the zoology section is also worth a look, stuffed animals galore! To top it off, it has actually seen some substantial renovations lately, and they even have a few English captions here and there.  May be worth considering but the price for  foreigners is high for what you see.</see>

Weapons galore propped up by medals and other memorabilia. If you are not interested in these sort of things, you can probably give it a miss, but they have a few cool war propaganda posters from the Great Patriotic War and a luxury officers' railway carriage from the twenties in the courtyard, if you need to entertain yourself for a while while any male company goes into boy mode.</see>

True to its name, this museum has a huge collection of rocks and minerals – some even some from outer space, like a few moon fragments brought home to Earth by automatic probes and one of the world's largest iron meteorites which crashed into the Sikhot-Ailin mountains in the forties. If you are not into stones, you could check out the small section on tools and equipment related to prospecting in the region or the collection of prehistoric plant and animal fossils. Outside the museum there are a few large monoliths of minerals, ores and rocks. </see>

The monastery, or rather the Theological Seminary, right next to it is also worth a look a brief look from the outside. Opposite, facing the Amur is a war memorial "Вечный огонь" ("the eternal flame"), rather kitschy but has good Amur views.  The whole thing is labeled as the ''Ploshchad Slavy'' or the Square of Glory.</see>

There are several nice, quirky statues cut from huge wooden logs dotted all over the park which can be interesting to trace down in a small treasure hunt for adults. There are also a handful of running amusements, cafés and beer gardens. Just across the street from the eastern entrance, Khabarovsk's local ice-hockey team battles it out in the premier Russian league in the Platinum arena.</see>

Meals in small restaurants are available for $10-20. If money is not a concern, you can dine with a view of sunset and the Amur River at Hotel "Inturist" for $50-100.

It has a large balcony with spectacular views of the Amur, beneath which the restaurant spreads out over two floors serving Japanese and western fare.  A bit on the expensive side and the food leaves something to be desired, though dining with a grand view is the draw here.</eat>

[[image:Amur_bars.JPG|thumb|250px|Bars at the river promenade]]

Locals will happily teach you how to drink Russian-style. People are very friendly, and in general you will find lots of locals who would love to practice their English. Don't miss an offer to visit a Russian ''banya'' (sauna) somewhere outside the city. 

For the most part you should avoid the pubs and bars if weather permits, and indulge in the many beer tents instead.  The '''River Promenade''' (''Набережная Хабаровска'') below the large cathedral is a lively place in the summer months, open air cafes in large tents, dot the promenade along the river. Most bars play different styles of music, and there is usually live music going on in one of the tents. Young crowd, and some establishments stay open till very late. This is also the starting point for a host of river boats, taking the party going crowd on short cruises down the river with loud music banging out the speakers. '''Dynamo Park''' (''Парк Динамо'') also has some beergarten style watering holes along long benches beneath coloured lanterns and Russian ''schlagers'' blasting out the speakers.

==Sleep==
No hostels and not many unrenovated Soviet rooms, so accommodation is pretty steep — on the other hand, the situation is not much different from the rest of Russia.  If the situation is desperate and you have a valid ISIC card, you could try to see if the university will hook you up with a room in their dorms — though call ahead instead of showing up on the day. If not, rooms can go as low as 1000 rubles (€25) if you look around and book well ahead of arrival.

==Get out== 
If you like hunting or fishing then there are plenty of things to offer. Join professional hunters for ride on Himalaishian bear or have great time fishing in mountains with no one 50 km around. Where else you can do it??

[[Image:Khabarovsk Aerial.jpg|thumb|250px|Aerial photo of Khabarovsk, clearly showing the Amur and Ussuri River confluence.]]

* [[Khekhtsirsky Nature Reserve]], the closest reserve of endemic plants and animals. 

* '''Bogorodskoye''' (''Богородское'') The district centre of Ul'chi rayon, should be reachable within one day on the Meteor boat. However, be prepared that getting back is harder than getting there. Whereas you can easily book your ticket downstream in Khabarovsk, return tickets are available only on the vessel itself, they are sold on a first come - first serve basis. Bogorodskoye is starting to develop eco tourism. To get to the surrounding villages, you need to hire a boat, as many of them are accessible only through waterways. Please be respectful to the indigenous peoples, which have gone through a long history of marginalisation and oppression and many of whom still live in deep poverty nowadays. If you want to know more about indigenous cultures, you can also try to contact the Association of indigenous small peoples of Khabarovsk Kray, which has its office in the city of Khabarovsk, please look here [http://www.raipon.org/] for their current contact (search for "Хабаровск").

* '''[[Sikachi-Alyan]]''' (''Сикачи-Алян'') A national village inhabited by indigenous Nanai people, located some 70 km upstream on the Amur river. Close to the village you can find old petroglyphs, carved into stones on the banks of Amur, dating back some 20,000 years. If you don't find them, you might ask in the village for advise. Everyone should know them. Sikachi-Alyan also has a little museum, where you can learn much about indigenous culture, including shamanism, history and of course about the petroglyphs. However, you should probably know Russian or have an interpreter.

* '''Center for rehabilitation of wild animals Utyos''' (''Центр реабилитации диких животных Утёс'') In a couple of hours' distance from the city there is a place in taiga near a tiny village where people take care of wild animals who got in trouble. The tigers, Himalayan bears either found injured or starving as orphans are finally put in the Center and walking free in the area of several hectares in Sikhote-Alin natural memorial. [http://www.animals.hbh.ru/members.htm]

* '''Sakhalin''' (''Сахалин'') - Khabarovsk is an important transfer point between the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] and the railway line to [[Vanino]], where ferries shuttles passengers across the Tartar strait to the fascinating [[Sakhalin]] island. From there you can continue your journey onwards to [[Japan]] with a [[Russia to Japan via Sakhalin|weekly ferry]] in summer.
