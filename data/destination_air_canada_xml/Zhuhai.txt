'''Zhuhai''' (珠海; ''Zhūhǎi'')[http://www.cityofzhuhai.com] is a coastal city in [[Guangdong]] Province, [[China]]. The name 'Zhuhai' means ''Pearl Sea'' coming from  Zhuhai's location where the Pearl River (珠江; ''Zhūjiāng'') flows into the South Sea (南海 ''Nánhǎi''). In 1980 Zhuahi was approved as one of China's 1st five [[List_of_Chinese_provinces_and_regions#Development_zones|Special Economic Zones]] due in Zhuhai's case to its location adjacent to capitalist [[Macau]]. Zhuhai promptly became a boom town expanding from 100 000 inhabitants to become a modern city with a 2018 population of 1.9 million people.

Zhuhai is a very popular tourist destination known as the Chinese Riviera. It's nicknames are ''the city for lovers'' and ''The Hundred Island City'' (217 according the city's official website with 147 of them over 500 square metres). It is one of China's prettiest, cleanest, greenest cities with a beautiful coastline and wavy palm trees. As well as being voted China's most liveable city Zhuhai has been awarded, “Best Garden City in China”, “The Happiest City in China” and “China’s Excellent Tourism City”. People enjoy its many open spaces that help give it a low population density. Despite a small population of 1.9 million relative to the other eight cities in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, Zhuhai had 3.18 million overnight foreign tourist numbers in 2017. That places Zhuhai 3rd for that metric after Guangzhou and Shenzhen among the PRD cities. Zhuhai plans to extend a tourism industry that focuses on leisure and sight-seeing, and to develop Hengqin into a tourist island targeting leisure travellers from across the globe. Local authorities promote Zhuhai as an ecotourism destination despite various environmentally destructive projects in the area. Zhuhai is unique in mainland China as a pulsating nightlife holiday destination, of the kind that similarly attracts people to visit such locations in other countries.

==Understand==
===History===
The Zhuhai area has been inhabited for 4 000 to 5 000 years since the neolithic age. The locality increased in importance during the Tang (618-907) and Song (960-1279) dynasties when its island ports became stopovers on the 'Maritime Silk Road'.

After the Song Dynasty, Xiangshan Town was formed in Shanchang Village where the salt industry was blossoming. Qianshan Fortress was built during the late Ming dynasty, acting as a military department managing affairs with Macao.
 
The area was a base for imperial forces during the Opium Wars but basically remained a collection of coastal villages with a population of around 100,000. In the Chinese Civil War the bank areas of the Pearl River Estuary were reclaimed from Komintang forces on 30 October 1949. The outer islands followed on 3 August 1950. Administrative changes led to the area in 1953 being renamed Zhuhai.
 
The Zhuhai Special Economic Zone was designated in 1979 and approved in August 1980. Zhuhai's selection as a SEZ was largely due to its location immediately adjacent to capitalist Macau (similar to Shenzhen's selection being for its position adjacent to Hong Kong). Zhuhai boomed to include nearby areas and is now a modern city with a population of 1.9 million as at 2018.

===Economy===
Zhuhai has important bio-pharmaceuticals, electrical appliances, manufacturing machinery, software, electronic information and ocean-based industries. Zhuhai transportation is being transformed further enhancing Zhuhai's economic opportunities. Despite a small population of 1.9 million relative to the other eight cities in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, Zhuhai's 3.18 million overnight foreign tourist numbers in 2017 places Zhuhai 3rd for that statistic after Guangzhou and Shenzhen among the PRD cities. The important tourism sector is targeted for further expansion focusing on leisure, sight-seeing and to develop Hengqin into a tourist island targeting leisure travellers from across the globe. There are dubious claims of making Zhuhai a destination for ecotourists. The Zhuhai Wanshan Marine Development Experimental Zone is intended to exploit the aquatic ecosystem around the Wanshan archipelago. Hengqin's location separated from Cotai in Macau only by the few hundred metres wide Shisanmen Waterway makes Hengqin of great importance within Zhuhai. Hengqin and Cotai are connected island to island via The Lotus Bridge. The whole of Hengqin is designated a special economic district, as Hengqin New Area, similar to Binhai New Area in Tianjin and Pudong New Area in Shanghai.

===Geography===
Located in the [[Pearl River Delta]], Zhuhai borders [[Jiangmen]] to the northwest, [[Zhongshan]] to the north, and former Portuguese colony [[Macau]] to the south. By sea, former British colony [[Hong Kong]] and [[Shenzhen]] are just across the bay to the east. The provincial capital [[Guangzhou]] is about 150 km to the north.

Zhuhai city inland portions of the terrain from the northwest to Southeast tilt, and diverse topography, with plain (25.5%), hills (58.68%), which has low mountain, tidal flat. Flat terrain, the hills of Linhai, sea area is vast, the hundred islands crouch, have qifengyidan beautiful bay, and the beach. Inland from Lantau Peak, General Hill's two major mountain ranges and coastal hills, plains. Sanzao island is the largest island, an area of about 78 square kilometers. Mountain land, hills, plains, terraces, is arranged in a crisscross pattern water network division. Coastal alluvial plain from the Xijiang and Beijiang together into alluvial deposits. 

The Pearl River Estuary coastal territory, the underwater beach coast to slow gradient. Coastline, island 690 km long coastline. Highest inland Lantau Peak,437 meters above sea level, sea island in100 meters above the sea level. The main mineral resources of the crystal, iron, tungsten, tin, manganese, potassium feldspar, quartz sand. Natural soil red soil, rocky soil, coastal sand, salt swamp soil. The main rivers are Modaomen, Venus doors, Nai bay door, gate, Hutiaomen, before Hill, Wan Chai River Macao waterway, Nanshui Lek, a total length of 135 km.

===Climate and environment===
The weather in Zhuhai is sub-tropical. Temperature varies between 10C/50F degrees in winter (Dec to Feb) to a hot and humid 35C/95F degrees in summer (Jun to Sep). Typhoons are also a possibility in summer. The best times to visit are during spring and fall.

Zhuhai is one of China's cleanest and prettiest cities.  In 1998, it was awarded the ''International Award for Best Practices in Improving Living Environment'' by the United Nations Center for Human Settlements. The eco-friendly claims can be viewed as questionable and as green-washing given the environmental destruction caused by much of the economic developments in progress. An obvious example of that is the euphemistically named Zhuhai Wanshan Marine Development Experimental Zone intended to exploit aquatic ecosystem around the Wanshan archipelago. This is all the more so given Perna viridis, a species of green mussel, was found to be contaminated by HCHs, DDTs, and PCBs. This is even before considering the enormous carbon footprint of the swarms of flights who bring tourists to Zhuhai; numbers of flight-brought tourists that the Zhuhai authorities plan to increase significantly.

Zhuhai is argued by some to be one of the best cities in China to retire in. With a low population density compared to other larger cities in China, Zhuhai is unsurprisingly greener. Parks and open spaces dot the cityscape, and waving palm trees line the extensive coastline and many of the major streets.

===Islands===
[[Image:Dongao Island beach.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A secluded spot on Dong'ao Island]]
One of Zhuhai's nicknames is ''the Hundred island City'' (217 to be exact with 147 of greater than 500 square metres). Many of the islands are estuarial within the delta of prevalent criss-crossing waterways. Those in the delta and near the coast have been bridged. Wanshan Islands out in the South China Sea are accessible by boat.

Different islands have different character. Some have decent beaches, and some are eerily quiet fishing islands. Many are a noticeable escape from the hustle and bustle of living in Chinese cities and arguably comparable to leaving the country. '''Xiangzhou Northern Wharf''' (香洲北堤码头; ''Xiāngzhōu Běidīmǎtóu''), has ferries to the '''Wanshan Islands''' (万山群岛; ''Wànshānqúndǎo''):

* '''Dangan Island''' 13.2 square km in area and the largest of the Wanshan Islands and with mountainous terrain similar to Hong Kong. Dangan Village is here
* '''Dawanshan''' (Greater Wanshan) The Cargo and Passenger Port at Wanshan Harbour is a Grade A port of the nation. It is considered important in the Wanshan Ocean Development Zone in processing and warehousing for the industrialised fish/seafood industry. However, Perna viridis, a species of green mussel, was found to be contaminated by HCHs, DDTs, and PCBs. Tourist attractions are A-Ma Temple and Floating Cobbles Bay
* '''Dong'ao Island''' 4.62 square km with diving facilities, clear waters, and a nice beach. Club Med opened a resort here in 2014. Blundbuss Tower and Son-Soliciting Springs are on the island
* '''Guishan Island''' A PLA base from the 1950s. Guishan Town (桂山镇) is on the island as are the monument to the Martyrs of Guishan Warship and Wen Tianxiang Park
* '''Wailingding Island''' is also a nice getaway with clear waters and nice beaches

Also accessible via ferry:

* '''Hebao''' (Hope Island) has 8 bays and 12 beaches including 4 000 metre long Da'nan Bay. 126 species of butterfly (Butterfly Valley) and year round floral bloom. Ferry to Hebao from Gaolan Island. Stay at the campsite and take your own food to cook. Nice hiking

Islands accessible by road include:
* '''Gaolan Island''' 34.39 square km with coastline of 34.9 km. The island is known for its beaches and Late Neolithic period rock paintings. Take bus 706 from Zhuhai Port
* '''Hengqin Island''' adjacent to Cotai in Macau and economically very important (See "Economy" section above). Not an 'island getaway' location
* '''Qi'ao Island''' The Qi'ao Cun Event in October 1833 before the 1st Opium war is important nationally in China. British fleets invaded Qi'ao Island intending to sell opium. However, the villagers in Qi'ao organised a successful resistance movement. Qi'ao today is 90% forest with 1 900 residents. It was identified as an ecological tourist zone of Zhuhai in 2000. It is accessible by bus over the 320 metre Qi'ao Bridge

Take plenty of cash on these island excursions as some islands do not have ATMs.

===Districts===
[[Image:Zhuhai skyline at night.jpg|thumb|Zhuhai skyline at night.]]
The city of Zhuhai itself is composed of '''Gongbei''', '''Jida''' and '''Xiangzhou'''. The other areas mentioned are districts within the Zhuhai Special Economic Zone. Zhuhai's northern districts of Jinding and Tangjia, as well as the western district of Doumen, are less developed factory-driven areas that retain a deeper working-man, salt-of-the-earth quality.

North to South along the coast, the main districts are:
* '''Jinding''' (金鼎; ''Jīndǐng'') – Zhuhai's northernmost district is a factory town whose main attraction is a very large and lively nighttime outdoor BBQ; see the [[#Eat|Eat]] Section for details. Jinding definitely has a ''working class edge'', and is worth visiting for the BBQ alone, but wandering around may give you a different perspective to the ones you have previously experienced elsewhere in Guangdong Province. Visit Jinding to experience the ''real China'' before heading back to your more affluent Guangdong stomping grounds. Jinding can be reached via bus 3 or 10, or via sightseeing bus 2.

* '''Tangjiawan''' (唐家湾; ''Tángjiāwān'') – Tangjia is moderate sized town located between Jinding and Xiangzhou. Like Jinding, Tangjia's salt-of-the-earth qualities are more evident than its southern neighbors. Best known for the large '''Dragon Union Opera House''' which, as the name suggests, puts on live variety shows semi-regularly, its primary function is serving as a gigantic karaoke house that mixes karaoke with ''all-inclusive'' adult entertainment.

[[Image:Xiangzhou, Zhuhai, Guangdong Province, Skyline.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Xiangzhou skyline seen from Jinshan Park]]
* '''Xiangzhou''' (香洲; ''Xiāngzhōu'') – Government offices, big department stores (including '''Jusco'''), and some bars and restaurants are scattered throughout this district. This is the area where the locals mainly go shopping.

[[Image:Jida at night.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Jida, with Mao's personal jet]]
* '''Jida''' (吉大; ''Jídà'') is along the coast between Xiangzhou and Gongbei. This district has a lot of offices, high-end hotels and shopping complexes. This is not a particularly useful district to mention for directions, except for the fact that a Jida location assures you that the location is fairly near to the water and that a taxi driver will likely take the road right along the coast until you get there.

[[Image:Lotus Road Shopping, Zhuhai.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Gongbei shopping on Lotus Road]]
* '''Gongbei''' (拱北; ''Gǒngběi'') is the location of the busiest of the 4 Macau border crossings. Gongbei had 134 000 000 border crossings in 2018 rivalling the Singapore Johor Causeway as the busiest land border crossing on earth. Gongbei is Zhuhai's main tourist area with a wide variety of inexpensive hotels, clothing, electronics, souvenirs, food, drink, and colourful entertainment a short walk from the border crossing. '''Lianhua Lu''' (Lotus Road; 莲花路; ''Liánhuālù''; sometimes called Walking Street; 步行街; Bùxíngjiē) Here you can see passers-by on the crowded pedestrian-only street that is filled with shops and street-food vendors (see the [[#Drink|Drink]] Section for more details). There is also '''Bar Street''' (酒吧街; ''Jiǔbājiē''), a modern strip of higher end bars with indoor and outdoor seating, some featuring live music (many blasting loud music inside). At the southern edge of Gongbei is a '''underground shopping center''' and the '''Gongbei Macau border crossing''' (see [[#Buy|Buy]] Section for more details).

Going West from Gongbei are other districts:
* '''Doumen''' (斗门; ''Dǒumén'') is in the Southwest. It is a bit out of the way, in that most of Zhuhai spreads north along the coast.  '''Zhuhai airport''' is here. The very scenic '''Jintai Buddhist Temple''', built at the end of the Song Dynasty is over 1,000 years old and is well worth a visit if you are in the area. Get the full treatment at the '''Imperial (Yu Wenquan) Hot Springs Resort''' in Doumen, the first Japanese outdoor garden-style hot springs resort in China, with over 20 kinds of hot springs. Doumen has the Zhaozhen Museum, named after U.S. Army Colonel, John C. Young whose father was born near there.

==Get in==
===Visa===
In most cases, a visa should be obtained from a Chinese embassy or consulate before arriving anywhere in China. There are certain exceptions including visa free transit visits to China. See the [[China#Visas|China visas]] page for more information. Zhuhai has international entry/exit ports:

* Gongbei (land crossing with peninsular Macau. Open 06:00 – 01:00)
* Hengqin (island to island crossing to Cotai in Macau via the Lotus Bridge over the Shisanmen Waterway. Open 24 hours since December 2014)
* Hong Kong - Zhuhai - Macau Bridge (Open: 08:00 – 22:00 Macau–Zhuhai crossing)
* Jiuzhou (port serving ferries to/from Hong Kong and Shenzhen. Open to passengers as per ferry timings)
* Macau-Zhuhai Industrial Cross-border Park only open to Industrial Park card holders (24 hours) and Macau residents and mainland Chinese with permits to work in Macau (0.00 - 07.00)

Zhuhai airport is not an international airport meaning many international visitors often fly into nearby airports such as Macau and Hong Kong which have direct transport to Zhuhai without the need to go through Macau / Hong Kong immigration/customs. Many nationalities arriving at Zhuhai can obtain a single-entry, three-day tourism visa on arrival (VOA) from Hong Kong or Macau. The 3 days start at 00.00 midnight the day after arrival. Zhuhai VOA offices are only at Gongbei, Hengqin and Jiuzhou entry points.

This visa is strictly only valid in Zhuhai. The Zhuhai VOA can neither be extended nor converted meaning holders must leave China before visa expiry. Payment is by RMB or credit card (Union Pay, Visa and MasterCard). Some credit cards do not process, try to have RMB or back up credit card. For most nationalities the Zhuhai VOA fee is the same as a regular visa fee (168 RMB). This though various for countries with a reciprocal visa fee (e.g. the fee is 304 RMB for UK passport holders). National eligibility for Zhuahi VOA changes so the following should be taken only as a rough guide to be checked elsewhere:

* Most European and developed countries are eligible for the five-day VOA, including US, UK, Canada, French, Australia, Germany, Korea, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland

* Indonesian and Filipino passport holders can get it only if they have been granted a Chinese visa previously

* Citizens from the following countries are ineligible: Afghanistan, Algeria, Bahrain, Cameroon, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Syria, Turkey, Uganda, and Yemen

Citizens of countries not mentioned should contact the relevant Chinese embassy or port to ask if they can apply for the Zhuhai visa on arrival.

If crossing into the Gongbei immigration building, after passing all the duty free shops, the visa office is behind a green door on the right hand side of the hall. Follow the stairs and you will find the office on the left. You need to complete a small white form, have your photograph taken and pay the fee. The visa is then processed within minutes. Currency can be converted at the China Tourist Services office back downstairs in the main immigration hall, but usually at an awful rate. Once the visa has been issued, proceed to the immigration hall to complete the immigration process. Crossing into Zhuhai, China through the Gongbei port takes about 20-30 minutes.

When you exit the Gongbei immigration building, you have reached the Zhuhai border. If you need to purchase a pre-paid cellphone card, please proceed to exit the immigration building, then walk downstair to the underground mall. There are many telephone services stalls here. You may purchase a pre-paid sim-card here for &yen;100. It comes with a loaded value of &yen;50. You will need a GSM phone to get it to work. Always keep your belongings zipped inside your pocket here as pick-pocketing is very common at the border check point.

===By plane===
[[Image:Plane being Boarded at Zhuhai Airport.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A380 at Zhuhai Airport]]
'''Zhuhai Airport''' (IATA: ZUH) [http://www.zhairport.com]. This is located 50 kilometres (31 mi) (road distance) southwest of the Zhuhai city centre in Sanzao Town, Jinwan District. It is a modern airport of 11 million passengers in 2018 directly connecting the area with many Chinese cities, but no direct international destinations. To reach Zhuhai from outside China, one would usually fly to [[Macau]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Shenzhen]] or [[Guangzhou]]. All are within an hour or two of Zhuhai with Macau and Hong Kong airports offering transport services direct to Zhuhai that do not require passing through Macau / Hong Kong passport control / customs control. See below for fuller details of each of these.

Airport Express buses operate between Zhuhai airport and Xiangzhen and Gongbei districts for ¥30 (November 2010) per passenger, and follows the schedule of arriving/departing flights. A taxi from the airport to Gongbei or Jiuzhou in downtown Zhuhai is around ¥130 (airport surcharge of 5 RMB and 6 RMB per item of luggage (October 2011) when traffic is free flowing taking 15 mins to Gongbei Border Control. Taxis accept RMB, MOP and HKD for payment. Public bus number 207 goes right to the Gongbei border crossing for ¥6. However the journey time is between 1 hour 45 mins and 2 hours. Note that this bus does not have a luggage storage area on board.

'''Macau International Airport''' (IATA: MFM) [http://www.macau-airport.gov.mo] The best way from Macau airport to Zhuhai is via the ''Express Link'' [http://www.macau-airport.com/en/v01/01_express.php] service, skipping the Macau immigration and customs. Once you de-board the plane, instead of going through immigration, look for the Express Link (China) sign and follow it. This will lead you past a transit security scan station where you must pick up an Express Link card, and upstairs into the departure hall. Go to the ticket counter at Gate 8, present your card and buy a ticket for the coach that goes to the Gongbei border (past Macau, before Zhuhai). The coach fare is ¥52 and the ride takes only 15 minutes. Coach departure times are 11AM, 11:30AM, 12PM, 12:30PM, 1PM, 2:45PM, 5PM, 5:30PM, 6PM and 6PM.  If you need to check in any bags for your flight, remember to have them ''blue tagged'' during your flight check-in procedure for this Express Link service. The blue tag is not a necessity, merely a convenience. Present your luggage tags at the above-mentioned coach ticket counter and pick up your bags at the bus bay later.

The option to skip the Macau immigration is not available on the return. Allow ''at least'' three hours to get from Gongbei to the Macau airport. Immigration formalities can be very time-consuming, particularly on the Chinese side during the weekends. Once out of the Chinese customs (before entering Macau), there is a little ticket booth to the left where you can get a shuttle bus ticket to the airport for ¥35. The buses will be waiting on the left once you leave the Macau immigration hall. They run at 10 minutes intervals.

Should you decide to go through the Macau immigration at the airport and take a taxi to Zhuhai, the ride takes only about 15 minutes. It costs about ¥60-80 for the short ride. But it is reasonable priced for those (>2 persons) who wish to share the taxi cab fees. The charges are inclusive of surcharge of ¥5 at the airport, ¥5 per piece of luggage. Taxi payment can be in Macau, HongKong or Chinese currencies. They are all treated equally in value. (ie. dollar for dollar, even though Macau dollar has the lowest value of the three currencies). Taxi cabs queue at the curve outside of the airport. Beware of fake note at this point. You may switch on your China mobile phone once you reaches the mid span of the Friendship bridge. The reception is rather good from this point onward.

'''Hong Kong International Airport''' (IATA: HKG) [http://www.hongkongairport.com] has numerous routes to Zhuhai:

# HKIA Skypier has a ferry to the Jiuzhou Port in Zhuhai bypassing Hong Kong immigration and customs. The ferry leaves HKIA at 12:15, 14:15, 17:00 and 20:10.

===By train===
[[Image:Guangzhou-Zhuhai_MRT.png|thumb|Guangzhou–Zhuhai intercity railway map. New Guangzhou shown on the map is more commonly known as Guangzhoul South station.]]
[[Image:CRH6A-0617@ZHQ (20190221171000).jpg|thumb|Train from Guangzhou South in Zhuhai.]]

Guangzhou–Zhuhai intercity railway (Chinese: 广州-珠海城际快速轨道; abbreviated as 广珠城轨) is a dedicated, grade-separated regional railway linking Guangzhou South railway station and Zhuhai. It is the first line completed in the currently under construction Pearl River Delta Rapid Transit network. The section between Zhuhai North and Zhuhai stations is also known as Line R1. The service stops at 5 stations within Zhuhai:

* Zhuhai North (Zhuhaibei) 珠海北
* Tangjiawan 唐家湾		
* Mingzhu 明珠	
* Qianshan 前山	
* Zhuhai 珠海

Zhuhai Railway Station is located at the western end of Gongbei Port of Entry and Portas do Cerco at the border of Zhuhai and Macau (the world's busiest land border crossing). There are frequent High Speed Rail (HSR) trains to Guangzhou and then beyond to/from Guilin, Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu and other main cities in China.

Zhuhai–Zhuhai Airport intercity railway, also known as the Zhuji intercity railway, is a regional rail in Zhuhai. It is part of Pearl River Delta Metropolitan Region intercity railway system. Formerly, the railway was an extension of the Guangzhou–Zhuhai intercity railway. The railways construction is split into two stages:

* Phase 1 from Zhuhai to Hengqin Changlong connects 7 stations with 16.8 km of trackage. Zhuhai station expansion work was completed in May 2019. Phase 1 is expected to enter service in November 2019.
* Phase 2 from Hengqin Chimelong to Zhuhai Airport will connect 3 further stations when open in 2023

It will take only 30 minutes to commute from urban district to the airport using the completed line.

Bus routes 3A (to Jiuzhou ferry port) and 65 (to Zhulinpu in Tangjiawan) connect the station to the rest of Zhuhai, while there is also a minivan service to Beijing Normal University.  Reaching downtown Zhuhai from Zhuhai North station takes around 40-50 minutes by bus.  There is also a taxi queue immediately outside the station.

If your interesting in making your way straight to the Macau border, you can take the k1 bus directly from the station (珠海北站) to the Gongbei (拱北) border crossing. The cost is 3 yuan, and it takes about 30 minutes.

Until the rail line extension comes into play, the direct downtown-to-downtown busses are likely to be faster and more convenient.

===By foot===
[[Image:Zhuhai seen from Macau border.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Entrance to Zhuhai from the Macau border]]
[[Image:Zhuhai, Gongbei, Macau border crossing.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Zhuhai-Macau border; the red building is the Port of Entry (customs and immigration)]]
You can walk across the border from [[Macau]] at Gongbei. It typically takes 20 minutes of walking time, but be prepared for long queues, which can easily add over an hour to your total border crossing time. For Zhuhai to Macau, if you are already late for your connecting flight, go to the express line (no queuing required) and show them your air ticket for immediate attention. The whole border crossing process takes about 20-25 minutes, excluding waiting time in the long queues.

Always keep your belongings zipped inside your pocket here as pickpockets are very common at the border check point.

===By bus===
[[Image:Zhuhai Gongbei bus station.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Main bus station in Gongbei]]

Visitor border crossing by shuttle bus is possible island to island via the Lotus Bridge. The Lotus Bridge connects Macau's Cotai with Zhuhai's Hengqin across the few hundred metres of the Shisanmen Waterway. The fare is ¥3 with no change given so carry the exact cash. From the Hengqin side of the border take bus number 14 to Xiangzhou, or catch one of the Kee Kwan air-conditioned minibuses to Wanzai or Gongbei (¥5).

[[Guangzhou]] has hundreds of buses every day to Zhuhai usually via the Jingzhu (Beijing-Zhuhai) Highway (京珠高速; Jīngzhūgāosù). You can catch one at:
* China (Marriott) Hotel (中国大酒店)
* Guangzhou Baiyun Airport (广州白云机场) just inside the Arrival Hall
* Garden Hotel (花园酒店) 
* Provincial bus station (省汽车站) 
* Tianhe Dasha bus station (天河大厦车站) 
* Liuhua bus station (流花车站) directly opposite the provincial train station

From any of these locations, the trip will cost ¥70-75 and take about 2.5 hours. Buses leave every half hour and go to Gongbei. Along the way, they usually make a stop at '''Xiangzhou''' (香洲; ''Xiāngzhōu'') and '''Suidaonan''' (隧道南; ''Suìdàonán''). 

Zhuhai has several bus stations:
* One is underground, accessed from the lower level of the underground shopping center at the Gongbei border crossing (the Macau border).

* The main Gongbei bus station is within a few hundred meters from the Gongbei border crossing. It's off to your right as you leave the underground shopping centre by the Northeast Exit.

* Xiangzhou also has a large intercity bus station. Take #2 or #10 city bus to reach it from Gongbei.

A bridge from Shenzhen Airport to Zhongshan is planned to open in 2024.

===By car===
It is possible to drive across the border from Macau. Unlike Macau, China drives on the right. Only vehicles with dual plates are allowed to drive across the border.

==Get around==
Zhuhai is quite spread out. The terrain is coastal plain broken up by mountains or, seen from the sea, a series of bays and headlands. There are many clumps of development separated by hills, often parkland.

For all information about the city you can pick up Delta Bridges City Guide at almost every bar, hotel or better restaurant. All information is freshly updated, or visit their website [http://www.deltabridges.com link title]
===By train===
See "Get in, By train" section above; The Zhuhai - Guangzhou intercity railway stops at many different locations within Zhuhai's boundaries.

Zhuhai Metro (珠海地铁) is in the planning stage. Construction is expected to start in 2019, with an estimated time of completion in 2024.

* Line 1: Jiuzhou Port to Jinwan Station (36.8 km trackage)
* Line 2: Jinding Industrial Area to Gongbei Port (30.5 km trackage)

===By tram===
A three-line Zhuhai tram network (珠海有轨电车) is under construction. In 2017, the 14 station first section of Line 1 began service to the public running from Haitian Gardens to Shangchong. When complete, Line 1 will connect central Zhuhai to Zhuhai Railway Station and the Gongbei Port of Entry to Macau.

===By bus===
[[Image:Zhuhai, inside of a bus.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Inside of an older Zhuhai local bus]]
* To move between districts, use buses. These are ¥1-3, depending how far they go and whether they are air-conditioned. Most buses run to only 9:30 or 10 pm.

* Bus 10 will cross all of the Zhuhai SEZ north to south or south to north. By taking bus 10 it is possible to conveniently move between Gongbei, Xiangzhou, Tangjia, and Jinding. Bus 10 terminates in the south near the Macau border in Gongbei and terminates in the north on the mainstreet of Jinding.

* Bus 3 will allow you to reach Jiuzhou ferry port for trips to Hong Kong or Shenzhen.

* The double decker '''sightseeing bus''' bus goes to most areas between Gongbei and Jinding for ¥3. Padded seats and good air conditioning make it a lot more comfortable than city buses for long trips. The last sightseeing bus is at about 7PM.

* To get from Gongbei to Xiangzhou Bus Station to catch bus to Guangzhou, take Bus #10or 10a... 3 yuen.

* To get from Xiangzhou Bus Station to Gongbei take bus #2(2 yuen) to go via the coastline or #10 or 10a (3 yuen)for more direct route.

* To get from Gongbei to the nice beach across from the Dehan Hotel take bus #99...2 yuen.. watch for hotel with a dome that looks like the white house.

===By taxi===
Within any district you can take a taxi from ¥10. Get a card from the hotel where you are staying and keep it with you so that if you get lost you can give it to a taxi driver and he will know where to take you.

==Talk==
[[Cantonese phrasebook|Cantonese]] is the indigenous language of Zhuhai, it being a part of the [[Pearl River Delta]]. Nevertheless, due to the massive influx of immigrants from other parts of China over the last two decades, [[Chinese phrasebook|Mandarin]] is now the ''lingua franca''. English is not widely used, but some people speak it.

* <see name="Fisher Girl statue" alt="" address="Lovers' Road ()" directions="Bus 9 or 99 or the sightseeing bus" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="" email="" fax="">Legend has it that an angel descended to earth one day and fell in love with the beauty of the land. Reluctant to return, she turned herself into a fisher girl, weaving nets and searching for precious pearls to earn a living. In addition, she unselfishly used her knowledge and powers to heal villagers who were ill, and so was well loved by one and all. Soon she met a young fisherman named Hai Peng and they fell in love. Not long after, however, Hai Peng heard and believed malicious accusations, and demanded the fisher girl to give him her magical bracelets as proof of her affection. The fisher girl tearfully explained the origin of the bracelets. While she was still the daughter of the South Sea Dragon King, the eight bracelets were given to her by the eight palace mistresses, to guard her against the thought of abandoning immortality. She would die if she even removed one. Tragically, Hai Peng did not believe her story and turned to leave. The fisher girl, to prove her love for Hai Peng, removed her bracelets and died in his arms instantly. Hai Peng was filled with remorse and grief. His great sorrow moved the Jiu Zhou Huan Elder, who taught him the way to bring the fisher girl back to life. For this he had to travel to the Jiu Zhou Island to find the Resurrection Grass, which must then be fed with man's blood. After much difficulty, Hai Peng found the grass and grew it with his own blood. Days turned to years, and the grass was finally ready and used to revive the fisher girl. Henceforth, the fisher girl became a true mortal. On the day of their wedding, all the girls together found a gigantic, magical pearl at the seashore. In gratitude, the fisher girl presented this to the reverent Elder.</see>

Always inspect the product before paying for it and leaving the shop. Also, note down where you bought the item. You will never get a refund, but Gongbei shop owners are surprisingly diligent about protecting their reputation, so they will more than likely exchange defective merchandise.

==Drink==
Zhuhai is well known as a nightlife destination across China and beyond. Whether it's enjoying Chinese street life, mixing it up with all walks of life on Walking Street, sipping cocktails on Bar Street, or hitting pulsating electronic discos, Zhuhai's nightlife is thriving. There are many bars and pubs scattered in the the city and lanes of the city, especially in Jida, Gongbei and along the Qinglu Road.

[[Image:Lotus Road, Zhuhai at night 2.JPG|thumb|250px|Lotus Road in Gongbei]]
===Lotus Road===
For a truly unique experience, have a beer or coffee at one of the couple dozen open-air bar booths along Linhua Road (莲花路; ''Liánhuālù''; lit. Lotus Road; also known as Walking Street (步行街; ''Bùxíngjiē'')). Hanging out here is by far one of the most interesting things to do in Zhuhai. It is parallel to Yingbin Road and a block east of it, starting on the western side of Gongbei Bus Station, opposite the northeast exit from the underground shopping complex at the Macau border. By day, it is a busy shopping street with numerous shops. It transforms into a spectacular must-see atmosphere at night. This area is filled with individual proprietary outdoor stalls for drinking and playing dice with the bar girls. Bar girls earn commission on the drinks so their goal is to get you to buy as much as possible. There are two groups of outdoor bars with the one further south nearer the border emphasising food (nothing special) and the one a little further north emphasising drinks. There is a stretch of shops in between the two areas. Drinks are cheap (¥18 for a bottle of beer, fresh fruit juice or cup of coffee), and you get to meet all sorts of locals, expats, travellers and tourists. Retain some sensibility exploring Zhuhai nightlife especially late at night as things can get pretty wild. Most stalls are open till 3 am, a few stay open later for enthusiastic customers.

===Bar Street===
[[Image:Bar Street Zhuhai.jpg|thumb|Bar Street lights]]
Shuiwan Bar Street usually just known as Bar Street (酒吧街; Jiǔbājiē) is at the Shuiwan Road of Gongbei. At around 300 metres long, is a well-established, modern strip of more expensive bars, some featuring live music. With the support of the city's municipal government, this bar street is set up to promote tourism supporting the local economy. The construction of the street is of a European style combined with Chinese modern garden sights as well as the local features. Various bars, pubs, cafes and nightclubs along both sides of the street have their respective characteristics, showing different scenes and themes. It is usually the first place newcomers to Zhuhai go to experience the energy and liveliness of life in Zhuhai after dark. This strip is pricier than Walking Street. It is one block in-land and a 20 minute walk from the Gongbei border. Follow the street with the clock tower until it becomes Bar Street.

===Discos===
Your best bet is to hit your bar of choice first and then inquire and explore. The discos tend to be large, intense, and heavy into generic Chinese imitation euro-trance music, and popular with the young and rebellious. Cover charges may or may not apply, drinks are expensive by Chinese standards (generally ¥30 or more). Be careful with your possessions as these places are notorious for pickpockets.

There are numerous discos in '''Zhuhai''' that will allow you to continue your night into the morning. There are several in Gongbei within a short cab ride of either Bar Street or Walking Street:

* <drink name="" alt="" address="" directions="On Walking Street near the food stands closer to the Macau border, look for the escalator going down from the street" phone="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="Open until 6AM" price="">Disco with lots of action.</drink>

There are several slightly smaller, dance type clubs located right on '''Bar Street'''. 

The '''Xiangzhou''' and '''Jida''' areas also have popular discos.

===Karaoke===

For singing/drinking in private rooms with your friends, the following places charge per hour for the room and drinks are bought separately in the mini-supermarket within the facilities.

'''GongBei'''

'''Jida'''

There are a handful of karaoke establishments across the street from the McDonald's as well.

'''XiangZhou'''

There are many KTVs in Xiangzhou.

'''Jinding'''

Come to Jinding Barbeque for a unique dining experience and beers aplenty (see Eat Section) and then go to '''Jinding Karaoke Bar Street''', an off-the-beaten-path strip of about 10 truly hole-in-the-wall karaoke bars located northeast of the main street in Jinding. Come here if you want to experience where real salt-of-the-earth working class Chinese people go to get their drinks and howl at high decibel levels into a microphone. It is not easily reached by walking if you do not know where you are going, but it is easy to flag down any of the locals and get a ride on their motorcycle (takes about 3 minutes and costs ¥5) or take any of the taxi vans parked all around the middle of the main street. Just motion that you want to drink and sing and point in a eastward direction from the center of the main street to convey the message. You will be popular here and may be encouraged to join someone's table and drink gratis as most locals will be surprised a foreigner would come here. Drink plenty of beer or bring earplugs or both to dull the volume of the howling.

===Other===
'''The Blarney Stone''' in the '''Holiday Inn''' has quite a number of beers on tap. It is located in Jida. It features live western music performed by Filipino groups, among others, on some nights (usually weekends). The German beers on tap are rather expensive at Y58 (+15%) but Y23 (+15%) for a pint of draught Filipino San Miguel is rather a good deal, especially during happy hour (6-8pm everyday) when it is buy one get one free.  Although the Irish decor is pretty average, it is a large and comfortable venue for those who are looking for a tamer night out. One of the cheaper hotel bars that I have been in and enjoys a reasonable mix of clientèle for a bar in a western hotel. 

'''Dragon Union Opera House''', also in Tangjia, is a large entertainment venue, occasionally featuring live, perhaps tacky, variety shows with acrobats, jugglers, rope climbers and singers, etc. Beer is expensive during shows. There is also a floor dedicated to massages. There are quite a few karaoke rooms available, complete with furniture, beds, food, drink, choice of girls, and optional adult entertainment options to fulfill your every need no matter how unusual. Known even in Hong Kong as a destination for those seeking an 'all inclusive' karaoke experience, it can be as tame or as involved as you want it to be.

==Sleep==
Hotels in Zhuhai are reasonably priced. Travelers on tight budgets can opt for budget or midrange hotels. Most people choose to stay in '''Gongbei''' due to its proximity to attractions, nightlife, the Macau border, and its variety of conveniently located and reasonable hotels. '''Jida''' has primarily upscale hotels that business travelers sometimes opt for, which are usually conveniently located. Some are further away and require taking taxis or the bus. Further out, '''Xiangzhou''' also has a variety of options at different price ranges. The Northern districts of '''Tangjia''' and '''Jinding''' are further removed from the action of Zhuhai and offer very cheap hotels.

===Budget===
Most budget travelers opt for low end hotels, and there are a number of legitimate cheaper hotels in '''Gongbei''' with low prices between ¥160 and ¥230. Talking your way into ''Chinese only'' hotels may land you prices in the ¥120 to ¥150 range. Some hotels in '''Xiangzhou''' can be had for as little as ¥100 to ¥120, and in the Northern districts of '''Tangjia''' or '''Jinding''' hotels can be had for as low as ¥80 if you look around. However, for those who truly want rock bottom prices somewhere other than a hotel, there is budget lodging in the form of hostels, and private rooms offered by individuals or families.

====Massage parlours====
On the Walking Street in Gongbei there are at least three massage parlours. If you arrive after 9pm you may pay ¥60 to ¥88 (depending on the room type) for two hours traditional Chinese massage and they will let you sleep until mid-day without additional payment. In one establishment you may have the room to yourself. It has television and air-conditioning. In the others you share a room with four other guests.

====Private rooms====
Touts outside the Xiangzhou bus station offer accommodation, often in private apartments with the family on bunk beds in the living room so the bedrooms can earn money. ¥50 a night is usual. These are usually clean and have a TV in every room, but up several flights of stairs and with a squat toilet.

====Gongbei hotels====
There are at least a dozen hotels within short walking distance of the Gongbei border, mostly either cheap or mid-range (¥150-400) ones. You can bargain the prices down and normally they have ''special prices'', around half the listed price. On the other hand, it is not uncommon to see a low price on the sign, but find when you go in that only more expensive rooms are available, sometimes this is true, sometimes it is an effort to coax you into a more expensive room. Adventurous single male travelers can scout around for rock bottom prices, and may be able to find a room for as little as ¥120-130 if they can talk these ''Chinese only hotels'' into accepting them, which is not always possible. Single female travelers, those with young families, or those fearing excessive street noise or noise from other guests should have no trouble landing a room for ¥175-275 (with an elevator, bellhop, restaurant etc), whic anyone would feel more than comfortable staying in. Most of the hotels located around the border fall into this category. The available options are plentiful so looking around for a hotel that suits you may be the best plan.

===Splurge===
Most higher end hotels are located in Jida or Gongbei. Gongbei situated hotels are more convenient for accessing the Macau border crossing, colorful nightlife and walking around and exploring. Jida locations vary, depending on the address of the hotel as some are essentially in Gongbei, while others are well north of that and are a taxi ride from the heart of the action.

==Stay safe==
[[Image:Zhuhai Vegetable Market.jpg|thumb|250px|Thoroughly wash your fruit & vegetables in China to remove pesticides.]]

In general, Zhuhai is a safe and friendly city. People who are sensible are unlikely to have trouble. Those though who engage with certain people significantly increase the likelihood of getting in trouble. Anyone ignoring the information below, you have been warned.

* Beware of [[pickpockets]], especially in the crowded shopping areas and on busses. Their use of a razor to get a wallet out of a hip pocket on a bus is a favourite tactic.

* Like in many places, prostitution can be spotted and seem tolerated in Zhuhai. However Zhuhai is '''''not''''' Thailand. In China prostitution is illegal with potentially dire consequences for anyone caught in the act. A Zhuhai case in 2003 that involved a large group of an Osaka construction company businessmen in a prostitute orgy on the 18 September anniversary of Japan's 1931 invasion of China, caused outrage attracting international attention after a complainant reported it to the media. 14 Chinese defendants were charged with prostitution, soliciting, conspiracy and other offences. Both of the hotel manager and the prostitute at the centre of organising the event were each given life imprisonment. The 12 others were given jail sentences of up to 15 years. Chinese authorities issued arrest warrants for 3 Japanese nationals accused of arranging the sex party and asked Japan to help detain them. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Kong Quan described the case as "extremely odious" and asked the Japanese Government to "strengthen education of its citizens in this regard". Japanese Foreign Minister Yoriko Kawaguchi said she regretted "the kind of act that would damage women's dignity". Prostitution is run by organised crime gangs with many of the prostitutes trafficed into forced service. Possession of condoms is used by police in China to incriminate prostitutes. This unsurprisingly discourages prostitutes from carrying condoms. Prostitution is the primary vector for increasing spread of HIV/AIDS in China.

* As in anywhere else in China, do not drink the tap water, avoid undercooked meats, watch out for counterfeit bills (especially 50s), and be very cautious about [[Driving in China |traffic]].

* As anywhere, tour guides will take you to shops that pay them commission. Those shops are usually overpriced, and the usual advice is to never let any local except a trusted friend take you to any tourist shop. One Zhuhai variant involves outrageously priced herbs from a Chinese medicine company called Bai Chao Tang (百草堂).

* Being a coastal area there is a large seafood industry. Produce in the area has been found contaminated HCHs, DDTs, and PCBs

* Unlicensed taxis often have unscrupulous drivers and are best avoided

==Get Out== 
* The bus to [[Guangzhou]], the capital of Guangdong Province, costs ¥60 to ¥65, runs every half hour and takes 2.5 hours from Gongbei or 1 hour 45 minutes from Tangjia. Allow an extra hour for the inevitable Guangzhou traffic jam. You can board one at the underground station in Gongbei to reach Garden Hotel in Guangzhou (花园酒店), or one from near the Gongbei border to get to the Provincial bus station (省汽车站) or Tianhe Dasha bus station (天河大厦). Additionally, it is possible to take the bus from Tangjia in northern Zhuhai to get to the Guangzhou airport, or Guangzhou proper.

* Peninsular [[Macau]] can be reached through the Gongbei border crossing and Cotai in Macau can be reached island to island by bus from Hengqin.

* [[Hong Kong]] can be reached by a 1-hour ferry boat trip from Jiuzhou Port (九洲港). Bus #3 will take you to the ferry terminal.  Ferries run regularly all day, with the last boat to Hong Kong leaving at 9:30pm.

* [[Shenzhen]]'s Shekou and Shenzhen Airport's ferry terminals can be reached in 1 hour from  Jiuzhou Port (九洲港).

*There are also buses to most nearby cities including [[Shenzhen]] (cheaper than the ferry), and overnight buses to [[Guilin]], [[Xiamen]], [[Zhanjiang]] and [[Beihai]].

* The Xiangzhou and Gongbei bus stations have overnight buses to [[Guilin]] or [[Yangshuo]]. These are fairly uncomfortable. Unlike most overnight buses, they have no on-board toilets, but they do make several stops during the 12-hour trip.

* Flying can either be accomplished by using the Zhuhai airport in the western Doumen district of the city, or taking the bus to the Guangzhou airport. Times vary for transportation depending on how far south in Zhuhai you are departing from. If leaving from Xiangzhou, Tangjia, or Jinding it is nearly as fast, and more perhaps more convenient, to get to the Guangzhou airport. If leaving from Gongbei or Jida the Zhuhai airport would be nearer.

* There are remote check-ins for nearby airports in Zhuhai. For Guangzhou airport, the check-in is at Gongbei bus station, near the KFC. For Hong Kong and Shenzhen airports, you can check in at the ferry terminal, Jiuzhou Port.
