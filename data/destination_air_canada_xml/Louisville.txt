'''Louisville''' is a large city in [[Kentucky]], with about one and a quarter million people living in the metro area. Louisville is also the namesake of the Official Bat of Major League Baseball - the Louisville Slugger.

There are many correct pronunciations of "Louisville," from ''LOOey-vil'' to ''LOOuh-vuhl'' to ''LU-vul'', but pronouncing it like "Lewisville" is generally considered incorrect.

==Understand==
A major city located on the Ohio River in North Central Kentucky across from Southern Indiana, Louisville exists at the confluence of Southern and Midwestern attitudes and cultures. Known historically as the 'Gateway to the South', Louisville has long been a transportation center for the region. Other local nicknames include 'River City' and 'Derby City', in addition to the myriad of ways the name can be pronounced, depending on one's accent. More or less any pronunciation is acceptable except 'Lewis', an error which will not offend anyone but definitely marks one as an out-of-towner. While it only borders on the region, tourists will probably find a bit of the famous Southern hospitality here, along with its varied cuisine and a relaxed attitude toward life. The city also boasts a vibrant arts and music scene and a world-class municipal parks system.

Louisville's biggest draw are the horse races at Churchill Downs (with the famous Kentucky Derby always the first Saturday in May), but the city is making a concerted effort to draw tourists year round. The architecture in Old Louisville and the Highlands is one-of-a-kind, and the people are very friendly.

The Downtown, Old Louisville, Highlands, and Frankfort Avenue areas are walkable and it is possible to take the city bus between one or all four without much difficulty, with a downtown hotel as base. Outside of this part of town though, you will almost certainly need a car.

Aside from Downtown, a must-see for many is the Highlands shopping district, on Bardstown Road roughly from Broadway to the Douglass Loop. Often described as "bohemian", it includes art galleries, bars, coffeehouses, midrange to upscale restaurants, and is ideally navigated by foot or bike. The street life here is particularly active on weekends when the weather is warm.

==Get in==
===By plane===
'''Louisville International Airport''' ({{IATA|SDF}}) [http://www.flylouisville.com] is served by all the major American airlines though it is only a spoke for most. The one terminal holds two concourses. Concourse A holds all the Skyteam (Delta and United Airlines) carriers (which dominate SDF as far as passengers carried) plus American Airlines (which moved from concourse B to the old TWA gates) and Frontier Airlines, while Concourse B holds United Airlines, US Airways, and Southwest Airlines.  Allegiant Air also flies from SDF. The terminal is small and easy to navigate.

With all of the airlines listed above, direct flights are available to most of their hubs, including Chicago, Dallas, Atlanta, New York, Detroit, Philadelphia, and popular tourist destinations such as Orlando and Las Vegas. The airport is "International" in name only &mdash; there are no longer any nonstop passenger flights to any location outside the U.S. Too bad you can't fly with UPS whose huge all-points international "worldport" is in Louisville just south of the passenger terminal.

===By car===
Several Interstates pass through Louisville:  I-65, I-64 and I-71.  
*'''I-71''' (''North-South'') begins in Louisville and heads Northeast to [[Cincinnati]] and [[Cleveland (Ohio)|Cleveland]].

==Get around==
===By bus===
Louisville's public transit service, '''TARC''' [http://www.ridetarc.org], operates bus lines in all parts of Louisville Metro (Jefferson County). Fares are $1.50 for adults (75 cents for children between 6 and 17) with a possibility for two transfers in two hours. Tickets can be purchased at some banks and government offices but this will not really save you much money unless you are going to be staying in the city and getting around by bus for at least two weeks. Buses generally run from about 6AM-10PM, some later on weekends, but it is a good idea to check the schedule for each specific route. Timetables are only posted at major stops, but (502) 585-1234 or www.ridetarc.org provide reasonably useful scheduling and routing help. The buses are also rather impractical in the suburbs, as they are infrequent and the stops are far apart.

===By car===
Car rental services are available at the airport. Louisville is encircled by two beltways, I-264 (officially the Henry Watterson Expressway and locally known as "the Watterson") and I-265 (the Gene Snyder Freeway, or unofficially "the Snyder"). Traffic is generally moderate except at peak hours on I-264 and in downtown. In particular, try to avoid [[:wikipedia:Kennedy Interchange|"Spaghetti Junction"]], the downtown freeway interchange, between four-thirty and seven on weekdays.

The city streets are laid out in a grid pattern in downtown and a wheel-and-spoke system farther out. Frequently, the streets are named after outlying towns they eventually reach (Shelbyville Road, Bardstown Road, Taylorsville Road, etc.) Some of the urban neighborhoods, notably Germantown, Portland, and the neighborhoods surrounding Cherokee Park, can be confusing for non-locals. Fortunately most neighborhoods are quite safe and passers-by will be more than happy to give you directions.

Louisvillians generally do not honk their horns unless there is real danger imminent. If this is not the case it is liable to be viewed as aggressive behavior.

===By bike===
Bicycling is becoming an increasingly effective way to get around Louisville.  Although Louisville's bike program [http://www.louisvilleky.gov/bikelouisville] is in its infancy (born at the 2005 Louisville Bike Summit), developments are occuring rapidly, and there are significant improvements on the immediate horizon.  In fact, former long-time mayor and current Kentucky lieutenant governor Jerry Abramson is an active cyclist.  Bike lanes are being added on city streets, especially in and around Downtown which is already the most bike-friendly area of the city.

Every TARC bus in the city is equipped with bike racks, making bicycling a viable option for long-distance trips and trips along major arterial corridors.  If you plan your transit route in advance, it is easy to get anywhere in the city using just your bicycle and public transit.  Metro Government is also installing more bike racks every day, making it easy to park your bike at your destination.

===Outside===
Louisville's park system was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, the "Father of American Landscape Architecture." Many consider it to be his greatest achievement. Cherokee Park, Iroquois Park, and Shawnee Park are the Flagship Parks, while more than a dozen smaller parks make up Louisville's own "Emerald Necklace." Cherokee Park features a 2.3 mi (3.7 km) 'Scenic Loop' with one lane of traffic reserved entirely for cyclists, pedestrians, and other recreational activities. Iroquois Park contains what was the tallest hill in Louisville before the city merged with surrounding Jefferson County in 2003; the hill's location gives it a commanding view of downtown, especially on clear days. In addition to the major parks, dozens of smaller ones are spread throughout the city, such as Tyler Park in the Highlands, a favorite of locals, or George Rogers Clark Park in Germantown.

A newer addition, Waterfront Park, is arguably one of the greatest things the city has done to improve its image in a decade. Stretching along over a mile of the Ohio River, Waterfront Park offers playgrounds, artistic landscaping, fountains, and open lawns, all with spectacular views of the city skyline and the river. It frequently plays host to concerts and other festivals. The third phase of the park's construction, the Big Four Bridge, is the recently completed pedestrian and bicycle bridge connecting the Waterfront park to downtown Jeffersonville across the river. It is extremely popular when the weather is good, and a small community of shops and restaurants has sprung up on the Indiana side to receive the traffic. 

Enjoy the view (day or night) of downtown Louisville from Ashland Park, on the Ohio River in neighboring Clarksville, IN. Park the car and walk across the street to Widow's Walk, an ice-cream parlor/garden statue shop constructed to look like an old Victorian mansion. Nearby is also the Falls of the Ohio, a state park containing a fossil bed that spans quite a bit of area when the river is low.

===Architecture===

Old Louisville is an architectural treasure trove. Just south of downtown, it is the third largest National Preservation District in the country and the largest Victorian district in the United States. A particularly beautiful area is St. James Court and Belgravia Court, which plays host each fall to the St James Court Art Show. Faced with possible demolition in the 1970's, the area is now considered to be one of Louisville's best-kept secrets. A good way to see the neighborhood is to follow a walking tour [http://www.oldlouisville.com/walking_tours_of_old_louisville.htm]. It also has a number of locally-beloved bars and restaurants, and a heterogeneous population that gives the neighborhood a particularly eclectic feel.

Main and Market streets downtown contain the second largest collection of 1800's era iron facade buildings in the United States. Some have been torn down or otherwise destroyed, but also many new developments leave the old facades intact.

Other notable areas include the Cherokee Triangle neighborhood in the Highlands and Butchertown, which is just east of Downtown.

===Inside===
[[Image:Louisville slugger museum.JPEG|thumb|220px|The world's largest bat!]]

Market Street has a number of '''art galleries'''.  If you are in Louisville on the first Friday of the month, there is a free gallery hop [http://www.trolleyhop.com/] around the downtown galleries, including a couple of glass studios. The '''Speed Art Museum''' [http://www.speedmuseum.org/] is a more traditional art museum on the campus of the University of Louisville, but is now closed for a complete rebuilding and will not reopen until sometime in 2016. '''21C Museum Hotel''' [http://www.21cmuseumhotel.com/overview/default.aspx] has several art installations open to the public and is, like all hotels, is open to the public 24 hours a day. There are also a variety of art galleries within walking distance of each other in the Highlands/Bardstown Road area.

For performing arts, there is '''Actors Theatre''' [http://www.actorstheatre.org/], The '''Louisville Orchestra''' [http://www.louisvilleorchestra.org/], The '''Louisville Ballet''' [http://www.louisvilleballet.org/], The '''Kentucky Opera''' [http://www.kyopera.org/], and The '''Kentucky Center for the Performing Arts''' [http://ww2.kentuckycenter.org/].

* '''Louisville Slugger Museum''', (''on Main street in downtown''), [http://www.sluggermuseum.org/].
* '''Louisville Science Center''', (''on Main street in downtown''), [http://www.louisvillescience.org/].
* '''Frazier History Museum''', (''on Main street in downtown''), [https://www.fraziermuseum.org/].
* '''Kentucky Museum of Art and Craft''', (''on Main street in downtown''), [http://www.kentuckyarts.org/].
* '''Kentucky Derby Museum''', (''south of downtown next to Churchill Downs''), [http://www.derbymuseum.org/].
* '''Churchill Downs''', [http://www.churchilldowns.com/].
* '''Muhammad Ali Center''', [http://www.alicenter.com/].


If you have a car, definitely take River Road out of downtown, past Zorn Avenue into the River Road Historic District.  Beautiful country estates on the bluffs overlooking the Ohio River are amazing to see, along with all the fields that stretch along the river and great vistas of all the boats going by.  The district stops when River Road ends at US Highway 42.

===Kentucky Derby Festival===
One of the nation's biggest civic events, the Kentucky Derby Festival [http://www.kdf.org/] takes place for the two weeks prior to the first Saturday in May when the '''Kentucky Derby''' is run at Churchill Downs. (The festival was rebranded as "Derby Festival" in 2011 because of a dispute with Churchill Downs, which owns the "Kentucky Derby" trademark. The dispute was settled in time for the 2012 festival.) The biggest events include the following:

*'''Thunder Over Louisville''' – Quite possibly the world's largest air show and fireworks display. Thunder draws as many as 800,000 people to the banks of the Ohio river for a day long event filled with food, music, skydivers and many types of aircraft (including military). The evening is topped off with the world's largest fireworks display set to music, usually lasting 30 minutes. Thunder is held on the Saturday two weeks before Derby (sometimes three weeks, depending on when the Easter holiday is observed so as not to interfere with it).
*'''The Great Balloon Race''' – It is held the Saturday before Derby, unless bad weather takes place, then it will be the next day. If bad weather takes place that day, the race is canceled if inclement weather conditions warrant. The start of the Balloon Race moved from the Kentucky Exposition Center to Bowman Field in 2011. Regardless of the starting point, the race ends a few miles away in whatever direction the wind is blowing and carrying the balloons. On the Friday night before the race, the balloons are inflated for the Balloon Glow, a very pretty sight at night. The latter event moved to the riverfront in 2012.
*'''The Kentucky Derby Festival Marathon and MiniMarathon''' [http://www.derbyfestivalmarathon.com] – Both races are held on Saturday morning one week before the Derby, usually at the same time as the balloon race. Since the 2011 edition, both start and finish in downtown Louisville. The two races follow the same route to the west side, back to downtown, and through Old Louisville and the University of Louisville campus to Churchill Downs, where they take a trip around the track in the infield before splitting after exiting the racetrack. The MiniMarathon (in fact a half-marathon) returns directly to downtown. The Marathon heads toward Iroquois Park in the south end, takes a loop around that park, and returns to downtown after taking a detour into the Highlands.
*'''The Great Steamboat Race''' – Held on Wednesday afternoon before Derby, the race historically matched the ''Belle of Louisville'' [http://www.belleoflouisville.org/] against the ''Delta Queen'' [http://www.deltaqueen.com/] for a race up the Ohio River and back again, ending downtown at the Clark Memorial Bridge. When the ''Delta Queen'', a traditional steamboat, was retired and replaced in 2009 by the diesel-powered ''Belle of Cincinnati'' [http://www.bbriverboats.com/belle_of_cincinnati.html], the competition format was changed. The crews of both boats now contest a skills competition for points before the race, and the race itself is handicapped by forcing the more powerful ''Belle of Cincinnati'' to travel farther than the ''Belle of Louisville''. Under both traditional and modern formats, a third boat has occasionally been involved in the competition. The winner, now based on points earned both before and during the race, is awarded the Silver Antlers (the replacement for the Golden Antlers, retired when the ''Delta Queen'' was retired) for another year until the next race.
*'''Pegasus Parade''' – Held for several blocks along Broadway (on the south end of downtown), the parade is the scene for floats, marching bands, celebrities, and many others groups. The parade is held on Thursday before Derby.
*'''Kentucky Oaks''' – One of the most important races for 3-year-old fillies (females), the Oaks is always held the day before the Kentucky Derby. Like the Derby, it is the last race of a full day of racing, and features much of the same pageantry, but on a smaller scale.
*'''''Kentucky Derby''''' – Often described as "the most exciting two minutes in sports," the first race of the Triple Crown is cause for a full day of celebrating, eating, and drinking. There is a full day of races on Derby Day, of which the Kentucky Derby is the last. Everything about the "Run for the Roses" (named for the blanket of roses draped over the winner) is steeped in tradition, from the food (Derby Pie) to the drinks (mint juleps, traditionally served in a pewter cup) to the clothes (designer hats for women, and two- and three-piece summer suits for men). TV stations will have several hours of pre-race coverage as well as the post-race interview with a teary-eyed jockey. Although you can certainly attend in person, either in the stadium seats or the cheaper and boozier infield, it's probably more common to find one of the countless Derby parties, hosted by a bar or maybe just at a friend's house.

===St. James Court Art Show===
A free event, the St. James Court Art Show [http://www.stjamescourtartshow.com/] has been running strong for more than 50 years.  This is the 5th largest Art Show in the United States.  The show hosts an impressive 650 plus artists from all over the Americas.  The outdoor Art Show is open during the daylight hours on Friday, Saturday and Sunday of the weekend of the first Saturday in October.  Held in the heart of historic Old Louisville among the country's largest collection of Victorian homes. An easy drive or bus ride about 1 mile due south of downtown Louisville near Central Park. The heart of the fair is the fountain on St James Court and the lovely  Belgravia Court [http://www.oldlouisville.com/Autumn/AutumnBel.htm] where the artists have to compete for attention among the historic mansions that line the street under towering oaks.  Tip: this is a beautiful neighborhood to explore even if it not an Art Show weekend.



===Sports===
*'''Louisville Bats''' [http://www.batsbaseball.com], The Louisville Bats are the AAA minor league baseball team affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds. The Bats are currently members of the West Division of the International League. They play their home games at Louisville Slugger Field located at 401 E Main St, +1 502 212-2287.
*'''Louisville City FC''' [https://www.louisvillecityfc.com/] - Louisville City FC is a tier two soccer club affiliated with the Eastern Conference of the United Soccer League. They currently play their home games at Louisville Slugger Field located at 401 E Main St, +1 502 384-8799.
*'''Louisville Cardinals''' [http://www.gocards.com] — The city's most visible sports teams are those representing the University of Louisville, members of the American Athletic Conference before moving to the Atlantic Coast Conference in July 2014. The men's basketball team, a perennial contender for conference and national honors, is extremely popular; tickets for high-profile games are difficult to impossible to come by. Most of the school's athletic venues are on the main campus about 4 mi (6 km) from downtown near I-65, with the best-known being the football team's home, Papa John's Cardinal Stadium. However, the men's and women's basketball teams do not play on campus—they now play at the KFC Yum! Center in downtown Louisville. Ticket information: ''+1 502'' 852-5151 or ''+1'' 800-633-7105.

==Do==

===Recreational biking===
If you want to bike for recreation, consider biking "the parkways" to the three major parks (Eastern Parkway to Cherokee Park, Southern Parkway to Iroquois Park, and Algonquin/Northwestern/Southwestern Parkway to Shawnee Park). These were originally designed just for bikers (and other "pleasure craft"), although now, especially Eastern, will require urban cycling skills except perhaps on a Saturday or Sunday. But they still represent the absolute finest the city has to offer in terms of biking - the three parks are magnificent, all have dedicated biking lanes (as in, you get half of or all of the road). Probably about 25-35 miles to see all three, if you're in good shape this can make for the perfect day ride around town, with frequent stops since there's a lot to see. There are minor hills on the parkways, but some moderate hills in Iroquois and Cherokee parks.

A good starting place is Waterfront Park, which has free parking, and also gives you a chance to experience downtown and all three "sides" of Louisville.  Beginning at the Waterfront, you can take the Riverwalk to Shawnee Park (in the process of being renovated with a Scenic Loop bike path similar to that in Cherokee Park), and - by the end of 2007 - connect via Southwestern and Algonquin Parkways to the Ohio River Levee Trail to the Farnsley-Moreman Landing in the southwest corner of the county; almost a 20 mile ride.

You can also go from the Waterfront along the Beargrass Creek Trail to Cherokee Park (see a  Louisville bikeways map [http://www.louisvilleky.gov/BikeLouisville/IWantTo/existingbikelanes.htm] for details). In the next five to seven years, you will be able to bike all the way from Prospect, in the northeast part of the county, to Farnsley-Moreman in the southwest - over 25 miles.  By 2015, you'll be able to bike a full hundred miles around the entire city.

You can rent bikes at Waterfront Park.

===Extreme sports===
Younger or more adventurous types who are into skateboarding, aggressive skating, or BMX may want to check out Louisville Extreme Park, located on the corner of Franklin and Clay Streets just east of I-65 downtown and open 24/7. Among its features are a 24-foot full pipe, seven bowls of different sizes, a street course, ledges and rails, and a 12-foot vert ramp with a 13-foot extension. [http://www.louisvilleextremepark.org].

===Music===
Louisville has a large and thriving music scene catering to every possible taste in music. 
Each September brings three multi-day music festivals to the Kentucky Exposition Center.

*'''Homwtown Rising''', [https://hometownrising.com/]
*'''Bourbon And Beyond''', [https://bourbonandbeyond.com/]
*'''Louder Than Life''', [https://louderthanlifefestival.com/]

There are many bars that feature standard-issue cover bands but of greater interest to adventurous visitors are the venues featuring original local music as well as big-name out-of-town acts.
*'''Headliners''', [http://www.headlinerslouisville.com/] 1386 Lexington Road. Attracts medium-size national acts and top-drawing local acts.

==Work==

==Buy==
Support Louisville's impressive number of locally-owned businesses by shopping in areas like the Highlands (Bardstown Road), Clifton/Frankfort Avenue, and Nulu (East Market Street). Shops displaying 'Keep Louisville Weird' signs (a concept originally developed in [[Austin|Austin, Texas]]) are members of a coalition of locally-owned businesses.

There are several malls and shopping areas in which to browse, including:
*'''Oxmoor Center''' [http://www.oxmoorcenter.com/] and '''Mall St. Matthews''' [http://www.mallstmatthews.com/], Shelbyville Rd at I-264. Oxmoor Center is immediately east of 264 (outside the loop) and Mall St. Matthews is immediately west of 264 (inside the loop).
*'''Jefferson Mall''', Outer Loop and Jefferson Blvd, [http://www.shopjefferson-mall.com/].
*'''Paddock Shops''', Brownsboro Rd. at I-265. Renamed from "The Summit" in August 2013; many locals still use the old name. [http://www.paddockshops.com/].

===Groceries and other basics===
The overwhelmingly dominant supermarket chain is Kroger, with nearly 35 locations in Jefferson County alone and still more in the surrounding counties (a few Kroger-owned stores on the Indiana side of the river operate under the JayC legacy nameplate). Most Kroger locations are open 24 hours. The no-frills chains Aldi and Save-a-Lot have a presence (mostly in poorer neighborhoods), and the local chain Valu Market has several stores, generally in nicer areas.

Kroger's real competition comes from discount-store chains Walmart, Meijer, and Target. In Jefferson County, Walmart has 10 Supercenters (discount store plus full supermarket), plus five Walmart Markets (supermarket only); all but one are open 24/7. Meijer, a regional hypermarket chain based in Michigan, has four Jefferson County locations and two in Indiana, all open 24/7. Of Target's nine area locations (seven in Jefferson County and two in Indiana), eight now have comprehensive grocery sections, though without the specialized counters of a true supermarket; also, Targets generally do not stay open 24/7.

All three major national pharmacy chains—Walgreens, CVS, and Rite Aid—have many stores in the area. Pharmacies can also be found at all area Walmart, Meijer, Target, and Kmart stores, plus nearly all local Krogers. Note, however, that only select outlets of the major national pharmacy chains stay open 24/7. All pharmacies at discount stores and supermarkets close overnight, even if the main store remains open. However, this is only an issue if you need to fill a prescription or purchase a decongestant containing pseudoephedrine (sales of the latter must be recorded by pharmacists because such drugs can also be used to illegally make the highly addictive drug methamphetamine). Other items sold in the pharmacy can be purchased at any checkout.

==Eat==
Local specialties include the '''Hot Brown''' [http://www.brownhotel.com/hotbrown.php3], a broiled open-faced turkey sandwich with bacon and mornay sauce, and '''Derby pie''' [http://www.derbypie.com/], which is similar to a pecan pie but incorporates chocolate.

Locals usually prefer to dine at one of the local eating establishments below.

===Budget===
*'''Spinelli's''', 614 Baxter Ave. and three other Louisville locations [http://www.spinellispizza.com].  Late night (until 5AM every day at all locations) Philly pizza. A luxury car is installed indoors at the Baxter Avenue location for seating.
*'''J. Gumbo's''', 2109 Frankfort Ave. and five other Louisville locations [http://www.jgumbos.com]. A regional chain that began in Louisville. Excellent Cajun food.  Gumbo, Jambalaya, Etoufee, Creole, etc.  Try the drunk chicken, it's excellent.  All meals $6.
*'''WW Cousins''', Breckenridge Ln & Dupont Cir. [http://www.ilovecousins.com] Dress your own hamburger and salad bar.
*'''Twig & Leaf''', Corner of Bardstown Rd and Douglass Blvd. Classic American diner and a local tradition.
*'''Chop Shop Salad''', 436 W Market St (''Downtown''). Choose your own salad ingredients or choose from suggested options. Quick healthy eating option. Only open 11AM-3PM, though. [http://www.chopshopsalads.com]
*'''Check's Cafe''', Corner of Burnett Ave and Hickory in Germantown. Same as above, can't beat the price. The decor features a lot of local sports memorabilia. Doubles as a bar.
*'''Cafe 360''', Corner of Bardstown Rd and Bonnycastle Ave. Order anything you want, 24-hours. Also has a bar. Food is okay but it's really more of a social place to go. Great Hookah.
*'''Shah's Mongolian Grill''' 423 E Warnock St. (''near U of L''). Choose-your-own-stir-fry. Huge bowls of food for about $7-9. Mostly a student hangout, especially in the evenings. Hookah also available.  
*'''Juanita's Burger Boy Diner''' 1450 S. Brook St. (''Old Louisville'') [http://www.juanitasdiner.com] Located a few blocks away from the Magnolia Bar and Grill (see below) and across from Woody's, this diner is open 24/7, has decent food, and is probably the cheapest place in town. Cash only—an ATM is available in the restaurant, though surcharges may apply.

===Mid-range===
*'''Pasha's Mediterranean CafePasha's Mediterranean Cafe/ Hookah Lounge''' (Turkish), Bardstown rd. [https://www.facebook.com/people/Pashas-Mediterranean-Grill-and-Cafe-Louisville-Ky/100066745964865/?wtsid=rdr_0qzfWQ6AZ4EeScTnh].

* '''Volare Italtian Restaurant''', 2300 Frankfort Ave, [http://www.volare-restaurant.com/]. Authentic Italian Cuisine

==Drink==
'''Mint juleps''' are a local drink, traditionally drunk during the Kentucky Derby. If you want to try this classic Southern drink outside of Derby week, it's difficult to find a bar that can make them, owing to the difficulty of stocking fresh mint and the fact that they aren't often ordered. One spot that does offer them year-round is Maker's Mark Bourbon House & Lounge [http://makerslounge.com] (Fourth Street Live!); they sell for $9 as of November 2011.

If you're the voyeur type, a Tom Waits fan, unexposed and looking for some culture shock, or just want to connect with some real locals, you might check out the forty or so hole-in-the-wall bars scattered throughout Smoketown, Germantown, Shelby Park, and Downtown. These places can range from extremely seedy (could get accosted) to the utterly laidback (ability to enjoy your malt 40 with cheap soulfood and the occasional mishmash, smattering of "local color" jabber-banter). Not for the faint of heart.

Smoking is not permitted in bars in the city of Louisville.

===Bars===
Fourth Street Live! [http://www.4thstlive.com/] (On 4th St, downtown) has plenty of bars, ranging from an English Pub to Maker's Mark own lounge and bar, but you'll pay a premium to drink there. Fourth Street is generally only busy on the weekends; it's dead on the weekdays except for 5-7PM or when the after work crowd grabs a drink. Be aware many of the swankier clubs and bars (Red Cheetah, Maker's Mark, etc.) have a dress code, and some have a cover charge, usually about $5. Fourth Street is free to enter.

===Coffeehouses===
There are a plethora of good coffeehouses in Louisville. Local chains include Heine Brothers' Coffee & Java Brewing Company [http://heinebroscoffee.com]. There are three Heine stores in the Highlands area alone, with six more scattered around town. Java has a Fourth Street Live location, a Main St branch, and a store in Crescent Hill where it was founded. (Others are on the east reaches of town, i.e. Middletown, etc.) Vint [http://www.vintcoffee.com] (four locations) merged with Heine Brothers in 2011, but remains a separate chain, and sources its coffee separately from its sister chain. Other selections include Highland Coffee at 1140 Bardstown Rd/627 S 4th St, Old Louisville Coffee House at 1489 S 4th St, Sunergos Coffee [http://www.sunergoscoffee.com/] on 2122 S Preston St, Ntaba Coffee Haus [https://www.ntabacoffeehaus.com/] on 2407 Brownsboro Rd and Ray's Monkey House [http://www.raysmonkeyhouse.com/] at 1578 Bardstown Rd.

===LGBT===
Louisville has a substantial gay, lesbian and transgender communities, most visibly concentrated in The Highlands neighborhood, in the East End and Downtown. There are numerous venues and events catering to them and those friendly to them.

While not necessarily known for its exceptional coffee, Day's Coffee [http://www.dayscoffee.com/] on Bardstown Road has enjoyed a loyal following among Louisville's gay AND family oriented populations for years, thanks to it's very laid-back, unpretentious atmosphere.

The Connection [http://www.theconnection.net/], located downtown, is Louisville's premier gay club and has an enormous dance floor and showroom. Worth the cover on weekends or special events for those who enjoy a good drag show. Claims to have the best drag show in the United States.

Tryangles is a Louisville gay standby that endears by possessing the contradictory qualities of both homeyness and sleaze in equal measure. Popular with the bear and levi/leather crowd.

Teddy Bears has been victims of some scary hype, though for those not afraid of men and trans people "of a certain age" or beyond, it can be great places to relax over a game of pool or unselfconscious karaoke.

==Sleep==
Keep in mind that most Louisville hotels around Derby weekend will usually charge three times the normal rate. The only way to avoid this is to stay with friends and family or to stay at hotels at least 100 miles away, such as Cincinnati or Indianapolis.

===Budget===
* '''Motel 6 Louisville Airport''' 
* '''Microtel Inn Louisville (East)'''.

===Splurge===
There are five great downtown hotels.  They are:

* '''The Seelbach Hilton Hotel'''. Historic and very luxurious. Similar to Palmer House Hilton in Chicago.
* '''The Brown Hotel''' One of the most historical hotels of the city and the country. Not only it is an excellent hotel, but it is full of history and fun stories. For example, during a flood in 1937, Brown Hotel was partially submerged, and a worker caught a two-pound fish in the lobby.
* '''Galt House Hotel & Suites''', 140 North Fourth St.
*<sleep name="Hyatt Regency Louisville"  address="320 West Jefferson" url="">Located downtown connected to Kentucky International Convention Center and 4th Street Live.</sleep>

There are many other hotels around town and in downtown, but they are rather generic.  If you're going to pay more for a hotel, you might as well get character as well. There are also some Bed and Breakfasts in Old Louisville, if you'd like to stay in a 120+ year old Victorian mansion, here's your chance.

==Stay safe==
Crime has become a problem in Louisville in the last few years. The west end of Louisville, particularly the area west of 9th street, is to be avoided. The southwest and south central parts of town have also seen an uptick of crime in the last decade. 
The last two years in Louisville have seen over 100 homicides with 2020 and 2021 nearing 200 homicides. 
Crime is virtually nonexistent east of the Highlands. Within the Highlands, crime is still low, but use caution exiting bars on Baxter Avenue if you are alone. This same advice applies to Old Louisville, only more so. Other than this, just use common sense like you would anywhere else.
