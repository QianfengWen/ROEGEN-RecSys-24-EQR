'''Santa Barbara''' [http://www.santabarbaraca.com/] is less than 100 miles from hyper-metropolitan [[Los Angeles]] but differs vastly from its huge neighbor to the south. With a mild climate and lush natural environs, the "Riviera of the West" is perfect for a day trip from LA, with its wide beaches, highly rated wineries, and a large variety of shopping and dining choices, that enables the town of just 90,000 residents to enjoy the sort of cultural and social amenities which are usually found only in much larger cities.

Although the common perception of Santa Barbara is as a playground for the rich and famous, the reality is that the average income is only slightly higher than California as a whole. Notable for its California Mission-style architecture (a long-standing local ordinance ensures that all commercial construction follow the Mission theme, which results in a plethora of red-tiled roofs and ''faux'' adobe supermarkets), local residents are intensely proud of their city's roots and traditions, and a number of hugely popular festivals throughout the year celebrate the many cultures found in the city.

*'''Beaches''', along the waterfront. Santa Barbara's most popular beach, East Beach, is a pristine stretch of blindingly white sand framed by postcard quality palm trees, surrounding hills and nearby harbor. For less crowded beachcombing, try nearby Leadbetter Beach, or further up the road, isolated Arroyo Burro (known to locals as Hendry's Beach,) where dog lovers bring their pets to frolic in a no-leashes-needed surfside dog park. Hendry's Beach is also home to a nudist beach, where one can often see a frolicking nude man pass by. Even more isolated is Butterfly Beach, tucked away in a cove beneath the high-toned Biltmore Hotel in Montecito.

Latin-themed dishes are, quite logically, the order of the day in
Santa Barbara, and the town's Mexican food ranks with any other town in
California. The town's elevated cultural status attracts high-powered
chefs from all over the world, and the selection and sheer variety of
local fare is quite astonishing for a community of 90,000.&nbsp; Here
are just a few of Santa Barbara's culinary choices:

===Budget===
*'''La Super Rica Taqueria''', 622 N. Milpas St., (805) 963-4940. Once tabbed "Best Mexican Food in the Country" by the New York Times. You won't come here for the atmosphere. There is no sign on the building, and seating is first come-first served, but you'll be happy you stood in the long line forming outside the door once you taste what's served up here. Julia Child claimed this her favorite Mexican restaurant (or even all-time favorite place to eat, according to some accounts), saying, "Everything is incredibly fresh. The salsas are wonderful." $5-$15. 

* <eat name="The Natural Café and juice bar" alt="" address="508 State St., 5892 Hollister Ave, Goleta" directions="" phone="(805) 962-9494" email="comments@thenaturalcafe.com" fax="" url="http://www.thenaturalcafe.com/" hours="Mon-Sun 11AM-9PM" price="">Outdoor, sidewalk dining that is healthy and good.

*'''Super Cuca's Taquería''',2030 Cliff Dr., 966-3863; 626 W. Micheltorena St., Big burritos, vegetarian recommended even for those die-hard carnivores. Alternatively, you can plan on buying two meals in one. Get the "super burrito", with grilled onions and peppers (and sour cream) in addition to your normal burrito fillings and it should heat up nicely in the microwave! Locals regularly choose Super Cuca's for "Best Burito" in the Santa Barbara Independent's "Best of Santa Barbara" list.

*'''Rudy's Restaurant''', Six in town, one in Paseo Nuevo.  Very good tamales, chimichangas and burritos. Charming family-owned business.

Locally owned pizza franchise. If you want a real local experience, have them deliver some McConnell's Ice Cream (locally owned ice cream company, stealing their cow mascot is the traditional senior prank for Santa Barbara High School Students), with your pizza! Also good for late night food, which can be hard to find.

*[http://longboardsgrillsb.com, Longboard's Grill]. 210 Stearns Wharf, Santa Barbara. Located above the Harbor Restaurant, it is the cheapest place to eat and watch the sunset over the ocean. Their clam chowder is fantastic and the fish and chips are pretty good! The rest of the menu isn't as great, but the deserts and drinks are good.

==Get out==
Although Santa Barbara is somewhat geographically isolated, with
only one major route in or out of the city, the surrounding area is
rife with fascinating side-trips.  The Santa Barbara County website, Traffic Solutions [http://www.trafficsolutions.info/transit.htm], has useful info about pubic transit to these nearby locations.

[[Image:3148315023 2da7f130c3 b.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Santa Barbara Wine Country]]
*[[Goleta]], a city just to the west and part of the contiguous urban area of Santa Barbara, is home to University of California, Santa Barbara, and Santa Barbara Municipal Airport.
*'''Wine Country'''. North on US 101 in the [[Solvang]] region.
*[[Los Olivos]]. About 50 miles north of Santa Barbara on Highway 154. This is a cute little one horse town with about 20 local winery tasting rooms lined up on Grand st. A great place to go wine tasting without having to drive a zillion miles from winery to winery.
*[[Solvang]]. Located approximately 40 miles north of Santa Barbara in the Santa Ynez Valley, Solvang is a gingerbread town. What must have started several decade back as a small "Little Denmark" tourist trap has grown into an entire town and surrounding community obsessed with its own overwhelming Danishness. Every sign, roof, light post and pothole is Danish-themed here, and reports of wandering bands of drunken men in plastic Viking helmets are firmly founded in reality. Take Highway 101 north/west to Buellton (the home of the original Pea Soup Anderson's), exit at the Highway 246 offramp and follow the destination signs to Solvang.  If you're up for a twisty drive, take Highway 154 (also known as the San Marcos Pass) back to Santa Barbara at sunset and enjoy an unforgettable view.
*'''Lake Cachuma'''. Beautiful Lake Cachuma Recreation Facility is located approximately 20 miles north of Santa Barbara and offers RV hookups, tent camping, and yurt camping. The Lake also provides fishing, boating, sailing, and lake cruising. No swimming and/or body contact with the water is allowed because the lake is used as a reservoir by the city of Santa Barbara. The Lake's location along highway 154 (the San Marcos Pass) makes it an excellent rest stop on the way up to [[Solvang]] from Santa Barbara.
*'''El Capitan Canyon''',  11560 Calle Real, tel ''+1 866'' 352-2729, [http://www.elcapitancanyon.com/]. An interesting combination of rustic cabin camping and high-end spa. $145-$345, about 5% lower in Nov-April. A few kilometers west of Santa Barbara on Highway 101 near El Capitan State Beach.
