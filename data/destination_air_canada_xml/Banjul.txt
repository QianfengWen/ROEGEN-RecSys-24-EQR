{{Pagebanner|Banner Banjul.jpg}}
'''Banjul''' is the second largest city in and capital of [[Gambia]].  The city is on an island, which has constrained its size - population is only 40,000. Consequently much of the population now is based on the mainland between the airport and the city. The main tourist and business centres are around Bakau, Fajara, Kotu and Serrekunda.

Banjul has become very popular as a package holiday destination with British and other European visitors.  Travel company 'The Gambia Experience' has been the market leader, but other operators are increasing their offerings too.

Go to its wonderful beaches.

Being on the Atlantic ocean, Banjul has some excellent and well priced seafood on offer.  The locally produced peanuts are also very good and go well with a pint of Julbrew.

===Budget===

You can find several local budget options on the independence drive.

===Mid-range===
*Radio Sud Beach bar. This used to be a radio station which started life as a pirate radio on a boat off Sweden.  After changes in the law there, it was sailed away and ended up in the Gambia.  The ship and radio station have both now gone (the former sank nearby and the latter closed in 2002 when its mast collapsed).  It is now a beach bar and restaurant. The original owners are still there and are happy to talk about the history.  Located on the beach near Banjul city.  Driving away from Banjul city it is on the right after the cemetery.

*Restaurant at the base of the Independence Arch has good seafood.

===Splurge===
There are many restaurants in the road leading to the hotels at Kololi beach.  This road is also known as the Senegambia Strip. Unfortunately this area is full with tourists, so be prepared for Bumpsters, super high tourist prices and old beer. Would not recommend eating there.

==Get out==
*[[Serrekunda]] - Taxis to Serrekunda cost around 300-500 Dalasi, from the Ferry Port in banjul to places like Pipeline in Serrekunda. Moving even a street or two away from the port, or travelling when a ferry has not just arrived will drastically reduce this price. Alternatively, a seat in a mini bus will cost only 50 Dalasi from the Garage at the roundabout on Rene Blain Street.
