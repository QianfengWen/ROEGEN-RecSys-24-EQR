'''Guilin''' [http://www.visitguilin.org/] (桂林; Guì​lín) is a city in [[North Guangxi]], [[China]]. Guilin is a scenic town and one of the best-known tourist destinations in China. There are many scenic places within short traveling distance of Guilin. These include [[Longsheng]] with its famous Longji rice terraces; the [[Li River]], a scene of which is printed on the back of [[Xingping|¥20 bank notes]]; [[Yangshuo]], a small county downstream from Guilin; and much more. This makes Guilin an excellent base for exploring the northern end of Guangxi Province.

Guilin is a beautiful city. The town center is surrounded by two rivers and four lakes and studded with sheer sided karst mountains. Outside the city center, the buildings are less well kept. The main industry in the city is tourism so the city is much cleaner than other Chinese cities.

Guilin itself is like most other medium size Chinese cities, other than that it has a large number of western-style hotels, tourists and is relatively free of air pollution. Many Chinese domestic tourists also flock to this area. What makes it special is its proximity to many picturesque limestone mountains and formations.

Avoid traveling during December-February if you can as the weather tends to be depressingly cold and rainy almost every day with a fog that obscures most views. January especially is the low season. Only a couple of boats operate the Li river cruise from Guilin to Yangshuo (no boats to Xingping) during this time.

Separated from the center of China and the Yangtze River basin by the Nan Mountains, Guangxi has always been distinct from the rest of China. The Han Chinese empire first expanded into Guangxi in the 2nd century BC. The Ling Canal was cut around the time, allowing small boats to transit from the Yangtze to the south flowing Xi River via the Xiang River.

Trade grew along the canal and river routes. Guilin was founded as a trading post in the 1st century BC on the West bank of the Kuei River. During the Ming dynasty, a garrison was set up in Guilin and the surrounding area gradually civilised with the development of farmland. The city had a population of over two million at the time of the Second World War, but was utterly destroyed during the war. The population slowly recovered with post-war construction of several factories for the production of paper, chemicals and agricultural equipment. However, market forces have caused several of these industries to relocate out of Guilin.

Guangxi and Guilin are home to 12 different ethnic minorities besides the Han Chinese. Guangxi is an autonomous region for the Zhuang ethnic group, rather than a province. See [[List of Chinese provinces and regions]]. Various other minorities, such as the Dong, are also found in the area.

Guilin is the third largest city in Guangxi, after Nanning and Liuzhou.

==Get in==

===By plane===
There are daily flights to Guilin '''Liangjiang International Airport (KWL)''' from major mainland cities and from [[Hong Kong]], [[Bangkok]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Osaka]], [[Seoul]], [[Singapore]] and [[Taipei]]. Book air ticket early as the price will increase as it approaches your traveling day. At off season, air ticket may be cheaper than train ticket (even the hard sleeper price), it is worth a try to check the difference.

[[Discount_airlines_in_Asia#Air_Asia|Air Asia]] provides flights to Guilin from [[Kuala Lumpur]] 4 times per week.

Airport bus to town is &yen;20, but drops just south of the city center at the Aviation Hotel where you can find taxis waiting. From the airport, a Taxi should then be around &yen;100 to most hotels in the city center. Request meter 'da biao' at the airport taxi rank and overall pricing to downtown hotels should be slightly less than 100 CNY. Many hotels arrange for a "shuttle" (in practice, a taxi). Also, be wary of hotels arranging 'free pick-ups' as some persistently try to sell tours during the journey. Travel time to the city center by taxi is roughly 40 minutes. The airport bus only leaves when full-ish so there may be a wait as the bus fills up. 

Back to the airport, a hotel may arrange the trip for &yen;80.

===By train===
Guilin has three train stations. '''Guilin Station''' (''Guilin Zhan'') is in the centre of town on Zhongshan Nanlu, '''Guilin North Station''' (''Guilin Bei Zhan'') is far away from downtown area, and Guilin '''West Station''' (''Guilin Xi Zhan'', started operation in January 2016) is even farther from downtown (north west to Guilin North Station). Most, but not all, trains which originate/terminate in Guilin go to or come from Guilin North; trains which come through Guilin from elsewhere usually only go to Guilin Station and not Guilin North; and Guilin West Station is on Guiyang-Guangzhou High-speed Railway. High speed trains are now serving Guilin (January 2014) from Nanning to Beijing significantly cutting down journey time (Guilin to Nanning 2 hours), (Guilin to Liuzhou 1 hour) & (Guilin to Beijing 10 hours).

There are trains from North (Beijing, Changsha, Wuhan, Shanghai, Xian), West (Kunming), South (Liuzhou, Nanning, Zhanjiang), and East (Guangzhou, Shenzhen).

*'''From [[Beijing]]''' &mdash; If for some reason you need to rush from Beijing to Guilin or vice-versa, there are three trains on either direction. To Beijing, trains depart from Guilin (not Guilin Bei) at 12:59AM (train from Zhanjiang), 3:06PM (from Nanning) and 7:30PM. Journey time is between 10 hours and 30 hours, with the 3:06PM train being the fastest. 

*'''From [[Hong Kong]] via [[Shenzhen]]''' &mdash; Take MTR to Lo Wu via the East Rail line. After going through immigration and customs, keep to the left when exiting. To get to the area for long distance travel, you need to walk past the [[Guangzhou]] trains area. And then follow the text below.

*'''From [[Guangzhou]] and [[Shenzhen]]''' &mdash; The bullet(high speed) trains have started to run. There are trains between Guilin and Guangzhou almost every 2 hours and it takes a bit less than 3hrs. There are only 3 bullet trains between Guilin and Shenzhen. It takes about 3.5hrs and costs CNY212 for a seat in 2nd class.

*'''From [[Hong Kong]] via [[Guangzhou]]''' &mdash; It is relatively easy to book a train ticket to either Shenzhen or Guangzhou on MTR, however note that if going to Guangzhou there are two stations in this city, the MTR trains terminate in Guangzhou Station and the domestic trains depart from the other East Station, which is on the other side of the city and a fairly long metro ride (English is on the Metro ticket machine). There is a metro entrance in the train station when you arrive in Guangzhou, and it is a bit of a pain to find, just look for the stairs going down in a corner of the station. And then follow the text above.

*'''From [[Kunming]]''' &mdash; There are 3 D trains between Kunming and Guilin: D3942 (07:38/15:35), D3944 (11:02/18:42), D3946 (15:25/22:49). The fare of second class ticket is ¥373.5. The conventional train T382 departs Kunming at 21:15, and arrive in Guilin at 15:19 in the following day. The fare of hard sleeper class is ¥261.5.

*'''From [[Xi'an]]''' &mdash; D trains began to run between Xian and Guilin in early 2018, which takes nearly 11 hours. The fare of second class ticket is ¥544.5. The conventional train K318 is still in operation, which departs Xi'an at 19:07, and arrives at 21:18+1, 26 hours later. The fare for hard sleeper class is ¥343 per ticket (hard seat ¥201). The train's final stop is Nanning.

*'''From [[Nanning]]''' &mdash; There are many high speed trains (under 3 hours) and a few conventional trains (4-6 hours). It is very convenient to travel between the two cities. One way second-class ticket of high speed train costs ¥108.

*'''From [[Chengdu]]''' &mdash; Since January of 2018, D trains have been launched between Chengdu and Guilin. Currently there are 8 departures a day. More will be added in the near future. The travel time via high speed rail varies from train to train, around 7 hours. The original train K652 is not in operation anymore. The fare of second class ticket is ¥315.5.

Once you get out of the train station, you will be approached by cab drivers/other drivers alike. While their cab meters are trustworthy, they might use a few tricks to cheat you out of some RMB, for example, aggressively pushing tours or adding false charges to the tab.

===By car===
There are some expressways locally and within the province, however for any long distance journey, it is a two lane road. Drivers need to have a local Chinese license and international driving license doesn't work.

===By bus===
*'''From [[Yangshuo]]''' &mdash; Minibuses (RMB20, Oct 2013) depart when full from the square in front of the Guilin railway station. Although the signs are written in Chinese, there are always conductors yelling out ''Yangshuo''. As the buses pick-up and let down passengers along the way, the journey time can take anything from 1.5-2 hours. Express buses (RMB23.5 incl. 1.5RMB mandatory insurance on separate slip, Oct 2013) depart from the Guilin bus terminal off Zhongshan Nanlu, several hundred metres north of the railway station (and on the same side of the road as the station). Buses depart about every 20min from 7AM. Buy tickets from the ticket office in the bus terminal or from conductor inside the bus. These buses are big with big space for your legs and depart on time, no matter if they are half empty without passengers, they don't stop on the road so journey takes convenient 80-90mins, highly recommended option compared to small buses departing from front of train station. People selling tickets on the street are actually swinders and their 'tickets' are not accepted.

*'''From elsewhere''' &mdash; Buses link Guilin with a multitude of destinations, including [[Nanning]], [[Guangzhou]], [[Shenzhen]], [[Zhuhai]] and further afield. Buses depart from the Guilin bus terminal on Zhongshan Nanlu, several hundred metres north of the railway station. The direct bus to [[Kunming]] seems to no longer be running, as of November 2013.

===By boat===
You can get to Guilin by cargo boat from [[Guangzhou]] via [[Wuzhou]], but there are no passenger boats to Guilin anymore, except the boats to and from [[Yangshuo]]. You can take a cargo boat if you want to at almost no cost from [[Wuzhou]] to [[Yangshuo]].

==Get around==
Getting a local map from a tourist guide or shop for ¥5 is a good idea. This will show the location of most of the sights as well as details of bus routes. Buses are an ideal way to get around Guilin on a budget. Many city parks and river spots can be accessed easily by bus. All the buses starting with 5# are free. A useful one is bus 58 which runs from the train station (and bus station) to many of the attractions. Bus fare are capped at ¥2 per trip. 

Taxis are also inexpensive and easily hailed within the city. Usually hard to catch during peak hours (5:30PM-7PM). Taxi meters begin at ¥9 for 2km.  Avoid taxi drivers at the train or bus stations asking for a fixed price that is usually more than running the meter.  As always in China, ask them to run the meter( "Da Biao") and if they refuse, better to find another taxi.  

Another inexpensive way for a day-trip to scenic spots in the city area of Guilin is to get a driver for a whole or half day. Off-season a whole day is about ¥100, half is ¥50. Most hotels or hostels arrange this service, also telling the driver where you want to go if one is not capable of speaking Chinese.

===By Car===
Hiring a private car is a good way to explore Guilin. A full day trip with driver is about CNY500-600 for Private Guilin Transport, including fuel fees. Make sure you specify exactly where you'd like to visit beforehand and ensure that all drivers/transportation don't simply take you to the various factories and tourist shops that pay drivers commissions.

But you can walk along river for few hundred meters and then use stairs and go to shallow water and some concrete islands in river to see what you are not missing by not paying 75RMB.

*'''Karst topography''' - Karst topography is a landscape formed from the dissolution of soluble rocks such as limestone, dolomite, and gypsum. It is characterized by underground drainage systems with sinkholes and caves. It has also been documented for more weathering-resistant rocks, such as quartzite, given the right conditions. The Karst topography in Guilin is one of the largest in the world and thanks to the receding water from hundreds of millions of years ago, the gulf in Guilin bared hills made from limestone and dolomite rocks. As the hills protruded in the newly revealed landscape, rain, wind, and countless rivers develop the unique contours of the hills and the magnificent structures in the caves. All of these took 70 million years for nature to pull off. As acidic water slowly eats the bedrock by flowing to the fractures on the ground, these cracks became wider and allow more water to pass through them accelerating the formation of underground drainage creating caves and underground rivers. The Guilin Karst landscape is a classic example of large scale bedrock dissolution process, dissolving more bedrock than it eventually left out. This made the towering Karst hills possible.
In fact the sharp, slender slopes made the Guilin site very unique from other Karst landscapes of the world. This explains the extensive underground structures – a lot of water was channeled from the hills to the ground creating enormous cave complexes. The scale of the hills and the huge number of interconnected caves and rivers made this area a wonderful place to just be amazed of the natural sites on your every turn. Two types of karst landscapes predominate in Guilin: fenglin or peak forest (isolated towers) and fengcong or peak cluster (linked-base towers). The two types may have evolved sequentially from peak forest to peak cluster, or they may have evolved simultaneously. Beiersdorfer described this landscape, which he saw during a recent visit to China: "China in general and the Guilin area specifically boasts some of the most spectacular karst topography in the world."

===Local cuisine===
Guilin cuisine is a combination of Cantonese and Hunanese styles, but with more use of fish and spicies and often prepared using stir-frying or steaming.  Restaurants often assume westerners do not like spicy food and will make your food bland as hell if you do not insist otherwise. Even then there is a chance they will not believe you.

Guilin has some distinct local '''ingredients''' used in a number of dishes.
* '''Chilli Paste''' is a sauce used for local dishes and also sold to other parts of China and abroad.  It is made from chilli, lobster, garlic and Sanhua Wine.

* '''Fermented Beancurd''' has been made in Guilin for more than 300 years and is known to have a unique taste.

* '''Fruits'''.  Guilin is renowned for its fruit, especially shatian pomelo, arhat fruit and gingkgo

As many other Chinese cities, Guilin has its own '''snacks'''.
* '''Horse hoof cake''' (''Matigao'') is a local snack.  This is also known as the water chestnut cake. It is a crumbly cake stuffed with red beans filling. 

* '''Rice with Mung Bean Paste''' is made from steamed rice filled with mung bean paste or other.  Often eaten for breakfast. 

* '''Sweet tofu''' infused with a certain flower is another delicious breakfast item. Look for roadside vendors adding orange-coloured liquid to a steaming hot bag of tofu, which you then drink with a straw. 

* '''Water Chestnut Cake''' made from rice flour, brown sugar, water chestnut powder and sesame powder. 
 
A number of Guilin '''dishes''' are unique to the city or are especially wellknown here.  
* '''Daxu Clear Water Fish''' is a specialty form the ancient city of Daxu.  The fish is cooked with salt and ginger.

* '''Nun Vegetarian Noodles''' this is a noodle soup boiled with soybean sprouts, mushrooms and bamboo shoots and served with . The soup is golden in color, sweet in taste, and has a mouth-watering smell. The noodles are first boiled and then put into bowls where the soup is added.

The Crescent Moon Building in Seven Star Park enjoys a great reputation for its Nun Noodles.

* '''Old Duck Stewed with Gingko''' made from the famous Guilin gingko, duck and ham stewed in a steamer.

* '''Rice Noodles''' (''Mifen'') is a local delicacy, also available as stir-fried (''Chaofen''). This is served everywhere, but try to avoid the joints near the train station. Traditionally the noodle and the topping is first eaten without soup, and once the topping has run out there is usually a pot of soup to add flavour to the rest of your noodles. There are also various pickles and condiments that you can add to your noodles. Servings are sold and priced in small, medium, and large. (一两；二两；三两）The small is more of snack, so start with the medium. There is a good spot in the street behind the Zhongshan Hotel.

* '''Snail''' made with sour peppers, shallot, ginger and sanhua wine.

==Stay safe==

Guilin is quite safe by both Chinese and International standards, but having said that :

* Watch your valuables very closely in the central city, (money belt) as in many tourist locations [[pickpockets| pickpocketing]] is a common occurrence. The bus station is the most dangerous place in the city. Keep on guard when boarding and disembarking your bus! Never carry your wallet in your pocket! Organized gangs of pickpockets operate in this area and they will focus on you if you are of non-East Asian decent.

==Cope==

==Get out==

* [[Yangshuo]] - About 1.5 hours by bus from Guilin is the friendly and picturesque town of Yangshuo. This used to be a popular backpackers town, but now is full of Chinese tourists. It is situated in a beautiful karst landscape. The full day boat trip along the Li River will finish in this town. Getting there by taxi or bus and is also an option.

* [[Xingping]] - This town will probably become the next backpacker place, as Yangshuo becomes too commercial for backpacking types. It is a very peaceful, old town located on the Li River's most beautiful landscape, half way between Yangshuo and Guilin.

* [[Longsheng]]- An area near Guilin with hills covered with terraced rice fields. There are many organised tours from Guilin, many of which will allow you to visit the nearby ethnic Zhuang minority villages. June and September are good times to visit when fields are flooded. 

* [[Vietnam]] - There is a new sleeper over night bus route from Guilin to [[Hanoi]][http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_682087800100jaha.html]. It costs &yen;390 leaving in the evening every day and arriving Hanoi next day. Or catch the afternoon train to [[Nanning]] (5hrs), stay overnight in a cheap station hotel and get the early morning bus in Langdong bus station to Hanoi, arriving about 3PM depending on traffic. 
As with any international transfer, check Vietnamese visa requirements for your country.
