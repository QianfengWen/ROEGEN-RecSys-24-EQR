==Understand==
The capital [[Las Palmas|Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]], in the northeast of the island, is one of [[Spain|Spain's]] largest cities. The south coast of the island is now dominated by the tourist resorts which generate most of the island's economy. The centre of the island is mountainous, with the remains of ancient pine forests on the peaks. Maspalomas in the south of Gran Canaria is the tourist zone, with the largest variety of options for enjoying the island. If you ever need Tourist Information or Specific help, the TI Center is in Yumbo Center.

==Talk==
The official language of Gran Canaria is [[Spanish phrasebook|Spanish]]. However, one hears many people speaking English and German in the tourist areas.

The local inhabitants speak Canario, a Spanish dialect characterized by a slightly more singing tone than the mainland, less clear pronunciation and incorporation of different verb tenses. Even for foreigners with a basic knowledge of Spanish, the varieties spoken on the islands can take some time getting used to. On Tenerife however, the pronunciation seems to be more neutral, and leans a bit more toward normalized Spanish. In a way is very similar to Chilean Spanish. Technically speaking, Canarian is known by 

*loss of ending 's' in most plural unstressed words into a "h" or "sh" sound (relojej instead of relojes), 

*diphthonging words and verbs (callao for callado, pesao for pesado), 

*emphasis of the H sound when normally mute (hediondo pronounced jediondo and not ediondo), 

*different verb tense (ayer juguemos un partido instead of ayer jugamos un partido), 

*use of Haiga instead of haya (as the verb "to have") and 

*use of simple past tense instead of past participle tense, resulting in the occlusion and almost non-existence of the latter

==Get around==
The public transportation system is well organized and economical. There are regular buses that go all over the island, most of the ones useful for tourists run through Avda. Tirajana in [[Playa del Inglés]] and head north to the Atlantico shopping centre or [[Las Palmas]] or along the coast towards Puerto Rico. To travel Maspalomas-Las Palmas the fastest bus is 30.

Rental cars are available in all resorts, both from local companies like TopCar (https://www.topcar.es) and large international car rental companies. Most of the large ones such as Avis and Hertz have offices in [[Playa del Inglés]] near the motorway.
Goldcar at the airport seems to offer interesting prices on the website, but in reality you are forced to buy a tank full of gasoline and return the car empty (which is impossible),  they force you also to take an additional insurance coverage. This makes the price almost double from what is advertised - so be aware of this. 

There are no trains in Gran Canaria. There is an autopista (motorway/highway) that covers much of the island.

To go to the other islands are not far, and the island most near is Tenerife which is only 2½ hour away with ferry.

==Climate==
The climate is subtropical semi-arid for most locations, but it may vary a lot depending on where you are going. For the main touristic resorts the weather is mostly comfortable. 

In Maspalomas there is normally 28-33 degrees in July at daytime, which drops to 21-24 by night. In winter, day temperature is normally 23 and by night 16-17. Bad weather can occur, especially between mid-October and March. Temperatures can then drop to 11-12 degrees and be quite windy.

Arguineguín has the best climate, with the least wind, and is, due to its protected location, among the driest in winter too.

Las Palmas has a bit of a different climate, and is sometimes clouded and rain might occur, even in May or June, but it is not very common. If you travel in winter take at least a thick jacket or two. If you plan to travel to the mountains bring or buy a scarf and gloves. The freezing point can be reached on Pozo de Las Nieves.

In summertime, always bring a bottle of water during the day. If winds from Sahara occur and temperatures rise above 40, try to stay in the shadows, close to climatized air and always drink plenty of water.

===Golf===
The island is home to Spain's oldest golf club plus eight newer courses, mostly located in the south of the island.

===Scuba diving===
Gran Canaria is one of the best places in Europe to come Scuba Diving, as it is one of the most Southerly spots, and has some of the warmest waters.  While not 'tropical' in climate, the waters have plenty of brightly coloured species such as Parrotfish, wrasse and Damselfish.  There are also some big species to thrill .. angel sharks (an endangered species), several types of ray including butterfly rays and mobula rays, and the odd turtle can liven up your diving.

Being circular, there are great dive spots all around the Island, of which the main ones are Sardina del Norte in the North (famous for the Manta Rays in autumn), Las Palmas (famous for the biggest wreck dives in the Canaries), Arinaga on the East Coast (famous for the diving area around 'El Cabron' which teems with marine life, and the South of the Island, especially around Mogan.

There some very experienced instructors on the island who will be delighted to share their knowledge of diving in their local areas, including Gorka at [http://www.buceocanarias.com Buceo Canarias] who organizes excursions to the wrecks of Las Palmas; Brian at [http://www.davyjonesdiving.com Davy Jones Diving] who can tell you all about the marine life to be found in Arinaga; and Gerry at [http://www.canary-diving.com Canary Diving Adventures] who knows all about the best dives on the West Coast from Mogan.  All three have been diving Gran Canaria for over ten years.  There is also a full guide to the marine life and dive sites at Gran Canaria Diving.com[http://www.gran-canaria-diving.com]

The south part of the island has many great diving locations and many dive centers. Most arrange daily trips Monday to Saturday with hotel pickup and reasonable equipment rental prices. Most travel guide books suggest one or two dive centers.

Near Maspalomas, Let's go diving [http://www.lgdiving.com] arranges boat tours to natural and artificial reefs with a variety of fish and other species. A wreck dive is also possible within 20m depth.

==Buy==

==Eat==
Besides many good restaurants of different nationalities, the Canarian Cuisine is especially worth trying. 
Most restaurants serve local wines as well as Rioja. 

La Casa Vieja: [http://www.grillrestaurantelacasavieja.com] (North area of Maspalomas) serve Canarian meals like Gofio, fish, squid rings, octopus with vinegar, Papas arrugadas con mojo (salted potatoes with a spicy mix), and grilled meat.

In Las Palmas there are many excellent fish restaurants, specially along the coast near Las Canteras beach and El Confital in the neighborhood of La Isleta. An exquisite dish is Chancletes al limón, but many other local fresh fish are excellent too.

Restaurant Ciao Ciao near the beach in Las Meloneras serves an Italian cuisine with good pizzas, meat and fish dishes. 

Restaurante Olivia in Puerto de Mogán serves well prepared local dishes near the yacht harbour in Puerto de Mogán.

As an aside, when staying in the area of Playa del Inglés, expect to be regularly solicited by "waiters" who want you to eat at the restaurant they are working for. It can't be avoided but becomes slightly less annoying over time.

==Drink==
The Yumbo Centrum dominates the centre of [[Playa del Inglés]]. It has dozens of restaurants, bars and clubs, many catering to the gay community, particularly on the higher floors. 

Some of the cheaper bars are located on the Western side of the ground floor.

Busy gay bars are Construction on the ground floor and Terry's Show and Amigos on the first floor. The top floor has dance bars such as Mykonos and Mantrix that are a mix of bar and clubs, and tend to be more expensive. Heaven used to have a club here on the third floor, but it has now closed.
* '''Cafe Florin''' [http://www.cafeflorin.com/].  A selection of real English teas can be found at Café Florín, also known as the Internet Cafe, located one minute from the Yumbo, down the hill towards the Playa del Inglés beach.

==Stay safe==
There is relatively little crime in the resorts, the main annoyance is drunks causing trouble. As anywhere, one should not leave valuables unattended on the beach.

In Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, applying common sense for large cities is advisable. Some of the streets can be badly lit and the area around the harbour can be a bit threatening. 

In the south, young guys may attack aged people trying to tear off a bag. It may happen even in the daytime on the central streets of Playa del Inglés.
