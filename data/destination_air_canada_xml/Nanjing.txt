'''Nanjing''' (南京; Nánjīng), historically also Nanking, is the capital city of [[Jiangsu Province]] in the [[People's Republic of China]].
It is situated in the lower reaches of the '''Yangtze River''' and is the central city of the lower Yangtze Basin.

Nanjing means "southern capital" (versus Beijing meaning "northern capital".) It is a renowned historical and cultural city and was the capital of several dynasties over the course of Chinese history. It has many historical sites including Ming tombs that are on the [[UNESCO World Heritage List]]. It was most recently the capital of China under the Kuomintang, from 1927 until their retreat to Taiwan in 1949. With a current urban population of approximately 5 million people, Nanjing is an important centre for commerce and trade in Eastern China.

===Climate===
Nanjing has a humid subtropical climate, influenced by the East Asian Monsoon. It is one of the 3 members of China's ''Three Furnaces'' along with [[Wuhan]] and [[Chongqing]], both of them known for their hot and muggy summers with Nanjing being no exception. The average July temperature is 28.1°C (82.6°F). Daily highs usually surpass 32°C (90°F) which along with the the humidity (80%), can make the heat unbearabale. On the other hand, summers are sunnier than winters and all of precipitation (which is a lot due to the summer monsoon) falls as downpours leaving enough time for the sun to come out. 35°C (95°F) or above readings, usually occur sometimes but long hot periods are rare. The highest recorded temperature is 40.7°C (105.3°F). Hot summers, though, doesn't mean warm winters. Winters in Nanjing are cold, colder in fact than many cities along the [[Yangtze]] River Basin, like Wuhan, [[Changsha]] or [[Shanghai]]. This happens, because the city doesn't have any geographical barriers to protect it from the freezing northern siberian winds (Wuhan and Changsha are both protected by mountains, while Shanghai is a coastal city). The average January temperature is 2.7°C (36.9°F) and night lows are usually around freezing point. Cold waves affect the area and mornings with below -5°C (23°F) temperatures aren't uncommon. The lowest recorded temperature is -14°C (7°F). Light snow does fall at least once a year but major snowstorms are rare with the last one being in January 3rd 2018. Overall the best time of the year to visit Nanjing is April-May when it's neither cold nor hot and there is an acceptable amount of sunshine.

==Get in==

===By plane===
Nanjing's Lukou International Airport is about 35km from the city centre and serves inbound international flights from Japan, Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Germany. You can also fly to Lukou International from most major cities in China, including [[Hong Kong]] (Shanghai now also has a daily night-time flight from Pudong primarily aimed at connecting international travellers.) There is a shuttle bus available from the airport.

There are several options to get from the airport to Nanjing. 

Subway line S1(Airport line) is probably the cheapest way to the downtown. It costs ¥6 and takes 30 minutes to get to Nanking South Station and can transfer to other lines (Line 1 to city center (Shinjiekou) or Line 3) from there.

The 30-minute taxi journey to the city centre costs ¥100 or more (there's a ¥20 toll about 3 km away from the airport). It is usually cheaper to take the airport bus to the centre and take a taxi from there.

There are two express-bus routes from the airport to downtown Nanjing - both terminate at the railway station and connect with the subway and local city buses. The services run at 15-minute intervals with one line serving Zhonghuamen (also has good metro and bus connections) and Hanzhongmen, while the other runs to the east of the city and stops close to Fuzimiao. A one-way ticket costs ¥20 and can be purchased from the kiosk outside the arrivals hall.
WARNING - if taking the bus to the airport from Zhonghuamen or Nanking Railway Station, ignore the touts who hang around outside the bus station and metro station claiming to operate the official bus service - they will usually quote the same price, you'll be loaded into the back of a small, run-down minibus and will usually drop you off several kilometres short of the airport and claim that the fare into the actual airport is several hundred yuan. To find the actual bus service, enter the bus station building and go to Gate 7 - buy the ticket from the kiosk at the gate, not the main ticket office.

If you're flying into Shanghai, there are bus and train services that travel to and from Nanjing. The bus runs four times a day from Shanghai Pudong International Airport, with a stop at Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport and then on to Nanjing Zhongyangmen (and back). From there, take the metro or a taxi to your destination. It costs ¥136 from Shanghai and the trip takes about five hours (only about four at night). Many people prefer to take a plane to Shanghai then bus, taxi or train to Nanjing.

===By train===
There are many daily departures to and from [[Shanghai]] Station and Shanghai Hongqiao Station, which is about four hours away on slow trains and around 75 minutes on the new fast ones (see [[High-speed rail in China]]). Both types of train also stop at [[Wuxi]] and [[Suzhou]] and some continue on to [[Hangzhou]]. Fast trains offer better equipment and are comparable with a business class flight, while slow trains are older and without as many amenities, but may suit people travelling on a budget.

The main station is now Nanjing South Station(also often called Nanjing Nan).  It connects with Lines 1, 3, S1 & S3.  This station only serves high-speed trains, with connections to Beijing, Shanghai, Xuzhou, Zhengzhou, Jinan, Tianjin, Wuhan, Hefei and other destination. For destinations like Zhenjiang, Danyang, Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, Kunshan, you may find Nanjing Station is more convenient. There are two 300 km/h high-speed rail lines connect Nanjing and Shanghai. One is Shanghai–Nanjing HSR line depart at Nanjing's main station. The other one is Beijing–Shanghai HSR line depart at Nanjing South Station. If you are going to Shanghai, it's okay to use either line, and trains on Beijing–Shanghai lines are usually faster as it is a long distance line and has less stops. But if you are going to intermediate stations like Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Wuxi, or Suzhou, Shanghai–Nanjing HSR line at Nanjing Station is preferred, as stations on Beijing–Shanghai line are usually far away from the urban area of these cities (Shanghai and Kunshan are exceptions, both rail lines use the same station). There is also a 250 km/h high-speed rail line connect Nanjing with Hefei and Wuhan. A trip to Hefei takes around one hour, and Wuhan 3.5 to 4 hours. The quickest train to Beijing takes about 3.5 hours.

The other station is Nanjing Station, although locals may refer to it as Nanjing North. It is situated on the north shore of Xuanwu Lake and is also very close to Zhongyangmen long-distance bus station. This train station takes some high-speed services as well as slow trains and sleeper trains.  The departure areas are on the 2nd and 3rd floors and you'll go through a ticket and security check to enter this area. Look for your train number on the indicator boards to find the right waiting room and when your train is called (usually 10 minutes before departure) just follow the crowd to find the right platform. Arrivals are in the basement, as is the taxi stand and the entrance to the subway station. The ticket office, pedestrian entrance and the local-bus station is on the first floor.  If you need to buy a paper ticket, the queues at this station are often significantly shorter than at Nanjing Nan.  Trains to Shanghai from this station are often preferred as they often go to Shanghai Station, near Shanghai's downtown area, rather than the more distant Hongqiao Station.

Zhonghuamen Station (formerly called Nanjing South, changed its name to Zhonghuamen Station to prevent duplicate the name with the new high-speed Nanjing South station opened in June 2011) no longer takes passenger services.

All passenger service at Nanjing West Station were suspended in early 2012. The former terminal station just west of the downtown area, built in 1908, has now been converted into a museum.

===By bus===
Nanjing is well connected to Shanghai, Hangzhou and most destinations within Jiangsu, Anhui and northern Zhejiang provicnces by bus as well as longer overnight sleeper services to Beijing (12 hours) and Guangzhou (24 hours). Most services depart from Zhongyangmen bus station, a large, clean modern terminal in the north of the city approximately 10 minutes walk to the west of the main train station. The station has English signange and announcements but the ticket clerks generally cannot understand English. Some services into Anhui province depart from Nanjing South (Zhonghuamen) station, which is adjacent to Zhonghuamen metro station. There are also bus stations serving nearby destinations at Hanzhongmen, Nanjing East (to the north of Purple Mountain) and Nanjing North (on the west side of the Yangtze River) although they are less useful to travellers.

===By road===
There is a modern highway system between Shanghai and Nanjing, which can allow you to travel quite quickly from city to city. Beware of traffic in the morning and evening rush hours. If you're just one person it may be much cheaper to travel by train, but if you're in a larger group sharing a car service can be cheaper. Keep in mind that you need to be a very experienced driver to handle Chinese traffic, so you may be better served using trains and buses between the cities and taxis in the cities, unless you're really on for a challenge.

If you are interested in driving yourself, see [[Driving in China]].

===By boat===
Nanjing is situated on the Yangtze river. Scheduled passenger liner service is available along the Yangtze river between Shanghai downstream and Wuhan in the Hubei province upstream although the river is mostly used for transport of goods.

==Get around==
If you're staying more than a few days it's worth buying a Jinlingtong (also known as IC-tong). These are available from any metro station, most bus termini and from any branch of Huaxia Bank (look for an information window displaying the letters 'IC'). The card costs Y75 and contains Y25 refundable deposit and Y50 credit, and can be topped up at the aformentioned locations. The card can be used on the metro, all city buses (but not all suburban buses), cross-river ferries, taxis (although drivers are reluctant to accept them and may tell you the scanner is broken) and in some Suguo convenience stores.

===By taxi===
Taxis are a great way to get around and most trips will cost less than ¥25. The taxi driver should start the meter as soon as you are picked up (starting at ¥9); if the taxi driver doesn't start using the meter and you don't say anything he/she may assume you don't know any better and overcharge you at the end of your journey. Ask for a printed receipt detailing the taxi number, kilometres travelled, times, and money exchanged from the driver upon exiting the taxi. Don't expect to get a taxi during both the morning and afternoon rush hours; demand is high and the drivers make their shift changes around these times, too. Tipping is not expected in taxis in China, so the price on the meter is the price you should pay. Unlike taxi drivers in Beijing or Shanghai (who frequently shuttle foreigners around and may be accustomed to gratuity under the table) tipping in Nanjing is an alien concept. You are likely to befuddle but please a driver by insisting that they accept additional 'free' money. As with anywhere else in China, you are very unlikely to get a driver who speaks any English, so unless you speak Mandarin remember to get your hotel's business card and get hotel staff to write down your destination names in Chinese to show your taxi driver before you set off.

===By metro===
The metro is a clean, cheap, safe and fast way of getting from A to B quickly - the system has 10 lines , total length of 378km and covers most of the central city and most important suburbs. The lines are as follows:
''Line 1'' runs from Maigaoqiao in the north, via the railway station and along the length of Zhongshan Lu through the city centre to Andemen - from there the line splits with alternate services going to the Olympic New Town area around the Olympic Sports Centre and to the south towards China Pharmaceutical University via the new South High-Speed train station. Services between Maigaoqiao and Andemen run every 3 minutes, and every 6 minutes on each branch line.
''Line 2'' runs from the new town area in the west and follows Hanzhong Lu and Zhongshan Donglu to the east, terminating nearby the Purple Mountain scenic area. Trains run every 6 to 8 minutes. There are interchanges to Line 1 at Yuantong and Xinjiekou stations.
''Line 3'' runs from the new town area in the northside of yangtze river and goes to Jiangning area to the south.
''Line 4'' runs from the longjiang area in the northwest of the city and goes to xianlin area to the east.
''Line 10'' runs from the andemen station and to the northside of yangtze river via Jiangxin Island.
''Line S1'' runs from Nanking Lukou Airport to Nanking South Railway station.
''Line S3'' runs from Nanking South Railway station to Gaojiachong near the city border with He county of Auhui province.
''Line S8'' runs from the new town area in the northside of yangtze river  to the Jinniuhu station(close to the border with Tianchang city of Anhui Province.

Trains run from approx. 5am to 11pm. Single-journey tokens cost between 2 and 12 CNY depending on distance and can be purchased from vending machines in the station. Stored-value tickets are also available (see above) and give a 5% discount and ￥0.4 discount when transfering to bus within 1 hour.

===By bus===
Buses are handy for getting around - particularly places that are inaccessible by subway, although Nanjing's bus system feels a little aged compared to Hangzhou and Shanghai and has no English information. However, Google Maps displays bus services for Nanjing and some tourist maps such as those sold around the train station will have bus routes. 

Buses running within the city proper will carry a route number displayed on a red placard below the front windscreen next to the entrance door. Low-numbered routes (1-100) follow major thoroughfares and link major shopping, residential and transportation hubs. 3-figure route numbers follow indirect routes and run around quieter residential streets and are less handy for travellers, but can be an interesting way of seeing Nanjing's ordinary working class neighbourhoods. Routes displaying the Chinese character for 'you' (travel) are primarily aimed at tourists and link all the major tourist sights. Routes numbered '8XX' e.g. 801, 806, 813 etc are night buses which run approximately twice an hour between 11pm and 5am when the regular service ends. Buses heading to surrounding suburban towns depart from hubs on the edge of downtown such as Nanjing Train Station (North/East), Changjiang Daqiao (Yangtze River No.1 Bridge - going north-west), Hanzhongmen (West) and Zhonghuamen (South/East). These services display the name of the suburb/town that they serve in Chinese characters and have no route number.

Fares are a flat 2 yuan on numbered services except for some routes which run older non-airconditioned buses which charge 1 yuan - no change is given so have some coins ready. For suburban routes, fares are charged by distance and a conductor collects the fares. There's a discount of 20% for IC card users. Note that many bus stops are some distance apart (often 3-4 blocks) so keep an eye out for your stop and an ear out for the stop's name on the PA announcements (which are only in Chinese). If the bus is quiet then press the buzzer next to the door to signal to the driver that you want to alight.

===By bicycle===
Nanjing is fairly cycle-friendly with segregated bike lanes on most busy roads - however there are a lot of bikes on the road so care should be taken. Generally, the pace is quite slow, and some of the hills in the central-west part of the city can be tiring to climb (but fun and a little scary to descend). Although it's possible to cycle up the Purple Mountain, it should be tackled in the early morning as the roads will be crammed with fast-moving bus and taxi traffic for most of the day, and the roads are narrow with no bike lanes. The bike/pedestrian path around the edge of Xuanwu Lake is a popular place for cyclists, as well as a popular racing ground for local motorcyclists - take care on the many blind corners.

Bikes can be rented from most youth hostels - ensure that the tires are pumped up and the brakes work before setting off though.

Buying a bike is relatively easy and cheap - the best option is to get a good quality used (possibly stolen) bike from the bike markets around Tangzi Jie (behind the Sheraton hotel) for &yen;100-200. The cheap bikes sold in department stores and supermarkets are very poor quality and shouldn't be relied upon. For higher-quality, higher-performance bikes; Giant, Trek and Specialized all have stores in Nanjing. Rembember to carry a strong lock - bike theft is common.

==See==
The city pass can be bought for ¥230 ( or ¥220  if you have a Nanking social security card) at the entrance to any of the big parks in the city, such as the zoo or Yuhuatai Memorial Park and provides you with free entry to 21 different locations including Purple Mountain but excluding the Confucius Temple and some other temples. You need to provide a passport photo for each pass and they are valid for one calendar year.

===In Nanjing===

Some say that Nanjing is all about Tombs. Plan an entire day just exploring the mountain and surrounding areas. The park has a shuttle "train" you can ride and is included in the price of certain tickets. There is also a cable car going up the hill for ￥35 one-way and ￥60 round-trip, or you can walk.

The river was originally called Huai River, and it is said that the river was channeled to the city of Nanjing during the reign of Emperor Qin Shi Huang, so it was named Qin Huai River from then on. Qin Huai River is the largest river in the Nanjing City area and is the 'life blood' of the city. Qin Huai River is so fascinating that it captures the imaginations of people both at home and abroad.There are many famous sites of interest along the banks of the Qin Huai River , including Confucius Temple just 5 minutes away, Zhanyuan Garden, Zhonghua Gate, and the sights along the Taoye Ferry journey to Zhenhuai Bridge.Taking the painted boats to cruise on the Qinhuai River, visitors can not only admire the sights along the river but can also experience the traditional culture of Nanjing. Visitors can take boats at different wharfs to admire the scenery along the river.</see>

*<see name="Nanjing City Wall and Museum" alt="城墙" address="" directions="" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="">The City Wall of Nanjing was designed by Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang (r. 1368-1398) after he founded the Ming Dynasty(1368-1644) and established Nanjing as the capital 600 years ago. To consolidate his sovereignty and keep out invaders, he adopted the suggestions of advisor Zhu Sheng to build a higher city wall, to collect grains and to postpone the coronation. Then, he started to build the city wall. It took 21 years for the project, which involved 200,000 labourers to move 7 million cubic metres of earth. Near the Jiefang Gate, the section between '''Shence Gate''' (in Chinese Shen Ce Men) and '''Taiping Gate''' (in Chinese Tai Ping Men) is the best viewpoint to climb. You can see Jiming Temple on the left and Xuanwu Lake on the right, and many cherry trees.
The '''City Wall Museum''' is to the east of the Old City Gate, and just outside the gate, is the Great Ci'en Temple (Dà cí'ēn sì). There are often special exhibitions in the museum. In Nanjing, the Wall is almost always accompanied by a moat, testifying to the preference of the Ming emperor Zhu Yuanzhang for celestial signs. In ancient times, with the Drum Tower as the boundary, the eastern side of the city was the Imperial City, the political center, the southern side of the city was the commercial area, and the northern side of the city was the military garrison area. The City Wall Museum introduces precisely the various details of the ancient city of Nanjing.</see>

Further up the hill is a cluster of stone formations bifurcated by a steep canyon, believed to have been split in antiquity by mystical forces, that enables accent up a stair way to a pavilion and a high view over the valley. Higher up the hill are the crumbling remnants of group of buildings used by Qianlong’s army.

*'''Xinjiekou''' is Nanjing's fashion district, the cosmopolitan, fast-paced heart of the city bathed in neon. It's the closest thing Nanjing has to Shinjuku in Tokyo or Times Square in New York. All the major retail outlets are centred on this area, which despite its complexity is only a couple of square blocks in size. There are giant department stores including Wal-Mart, Watsons, Suning, and "Fashion Lady" -- a bewildering, subterranean complex of clothing boutiques and vendors that looks like a video game come to life. On the outskirts of Xinjiekou are some higher-end establishments selling everything from single-malt scotch to MINIs. The eight-floor Deji Plaza has a number of retailers such as Cartier, Louis Vuitton, Ermengildo Zegna, Coach, Guess, Versace, Vasque, Crocs, Toys R Us and so on. At DongFang Shopping Centre there's Gucci, Fendi, Celine and so on. While you might be able to get away with haggling at the Fashion Lady don't expect any in Deji Plaza.

*'''Hunan Road''' is a slightly more low-key version of Xinjiekou running between Xuanwu Lake and Zhongshanbei Lu - it has most of the same stores including the Phoenix International Bookstore which has a whole floor of English-language books. There is also a small pedestrianised street called Shiziqiao (狮子桥-Lion's Bridge) running south from Hunan Road which is lined with pretty much every variety of restaurant imaginable, including the usual KFC and McD's, several cheap jiaozi and noodle places, some more upmarket Chinese places and a handufl of international restaurants incluing a Thai and Indian.  
 
*'''The area around the Confucius Temple''' in the south of the city has a lot of shopping, especially clothing and tourist items. It is a maze of tiny individual shops, and fun to explore even if you are not buying. If you are interesting in buying, [[How to haggle | haggling ]] over prices is the name of the game here. If you are skilled in the art of bargaining you can easily get an asking price of ￥380 reduced to ￥80 without breaking a sweat. The streets outside the temple area provide more shopping opportunities, as does the underground mall. The entrance to this mall is sandwiched between two shops but the neon lights provide a clue. This is a Nanjing shopping experience you will want to return to again and again. Opposite Confucius Temple there's Aqua City Shopping Centre with retailers like H&M, Uniqlo, Zara, Mango and so on.  While you are there, take a stroll through the temple, and over the historic bridge which offers great photo opportunities.

*If you have some time to explore, check out a few other options in Nanjing, including the two restaurants in the upscale shopping area of '''Deji Plaza''' on the 7th floor as well as a cafe on the 3rd floor. All three are good stopping points after a hard day's shopping at Louis Vuitton, or just before hitting the arcade or cinema. Near the '''New Cafe''' on Qingdao Lu is a small German cafe inconspicuously tucked away. Very good coffee in a cozy Bavarian/Thuringian environment. Expect to pay at least ¥25 for a good cup of coffee (which is the same as anywhere in Nanjing). Also worth checking out is a restaurant on the outskirts of Confucious Temple that offers a 14 course dinner; it might best be described as Chinese tapas. This is a very good way to sample dishes that you might not want to purchase entree-sized portions of anywhere, such as coagulated duck's blood soup. A fun way for more finicky groups to experience real Chinese food.

==Drink==
Nanjing's nightlife was decimated by Covid and the subsequent restrictions. Bars in Nanjing tend to be smaller, with whisky and cocktail bars being very popular. Pubs are few and far between.
There are four main areas for going out: Downtown, Hexi, Jiangning and Xianlin.
Downtown: the most popular bar for expats is Secco on Nanxiucun between NJ Uni and Nanjing Normal University. Happy hour until 9pm, pints from 15元. Good food.
Over the road is the Nanjing Irish Bar. There's nothing much Irish about it, but it's reasonably priced and the beer garden is excellent in spring or autumn.
Also nearby here is Lost (corner Shanghai Lu and Hankou Lu), a late night with some occasionally excellent live music. Cheap. 61 is a nightclub playing house, techno, hip hop and other music. Open late. Cover charge usually applies. Corner Hankou Lu and Ninghai Lu.

1912 is a party area, with lots of Chinese style clubs. Commune is inside the area and serves reasonably prices food and drinks.
Oasis is a bistro with Spanish-themed menu. Great patio for people watching and two for one during Happy Hour. On the edge of 1912 facing Taiping Lu.
Other places in 1912 change constantly.

Finnegans Wake Irish Bar is an authentic Irish bar on the Cinnalane development just north of Sanshan Street subway station, just off Zhongshan South Road (walk down the pedestrianised street next to the underground car park entrance - the bar is on the left). The bar has excellent food (meals are in the &yen;100 range) which use ingredients sourced from Ireland and there is a good choice of drinks including Kilkenny and Guiness (&yen;70 a pint). Good news if your tab gets too high - they take VISA cards!

The area around Wangfu Dajie contains a huge number of smaller whisky and cocktail bars. They tend to be quite pricey, although the vibe is usually pretty good. Mostly open late.

Hexi: Hexi's nightlife is centred around Yuantong Station. Luga's is a Mexican themed bar selling typical food and drinks. Surrounding this are several smaller whisky and cocktail bars.
Wing Station is a an American themed wing restaurant also serving drinks. Open late. Wuyue Shopping Centre.

Jiangning: Nightlife is centred on the Baijiahu 1912. Red Room is a foreign owned bar serving Western food and has some beers on tap.
Luga's is a Mexican themed bar serving typical food and drinks.
There are several other bars in this area, change is constant.

Xianlin: Centred around Xuezelu station. Bars here tend to close earlier. Pumpkin and Viking Bars share much the same rooftop. Lovely views, excellent in spring and autumn.
Axis Mexican Cantina serves pretty decent Mexican food, the drinks are reasonable.
Masala Kitchen is an Indian restaurant in a space that looks like an old pub. Also stays open late for drinks and occasional music performances, amongst other activities.

==Stay safe==
Good news! Nanjing is now officially the safest city in China - this was the honour of Hangzhou until a recent rise in hotel robberies put Hangzhou in the headlines. This doesn't mean there are no risks. Pickpocketing is a problem in Fuzimiao as well as on crowded buses, the subway and around the main transport hubs. Because Nanjing has a relatively small number of foreigners for a city its size, the common scams seen in Shanghai and Beijing are almost non-existent, however you may still see the occasional dodgy salesman selling counterfeit goods in Fuzimiao.

Be careful if taking the bus to the airport from Zhonghuamen bus station as many touts claim to be the official bus service, however, there is a strong risk of being overcharged or driven to a location several kilometres from the actual airport. The official bus departs from Gate 7 and tickets should be paid for at the gate. Bus Tickets are ¥20 as of March 2010. The fee remains the same in July 2012. Also be careful of fake taxis operating from the bus stations and occasionally the railway station - always use the official taxi stand and ignore any taxi touts.

Although traffic is slightly calmer than most Chinese cities it can still be much more manic than most Western countries. Take the usual precautions when crossing the road and also remember that right turns on a red light are sometimes legal in China (however in Nanjing most of the time there should be a dedicated right turn signals for right turn lanes) so people driving across the crosswalk while the 'walk' sign is showing aren't actually breaking the law. Also be careful of motorbikes and bicycles driving on the pavement.

Many older Nanjingese may have a resentment towards the Japanese because of the events during World War II. If you are Japanese, don't let this put you off visiting as the locals will still be very welcoming, however it's recommended not to appear too conspicuously Japanese and keep any opinions to yourself.
