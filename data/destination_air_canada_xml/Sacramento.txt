==Understand==
[[Image:Sacramento capitol.jpg|thumb|The state capitol building]]

Sacramento is the oldest incorporated city in California, settled between the confluences of the Sacramento and American rivers.  It was founded in 1849 and there are many reminders of the history of the city including Sutter's Fort, Old Sacramento, and remnants of the original ground level of Sacramento. It experienced explosive growth when gold was discovered in 1848 in nearby [[Coloma]], and the gold rush that followed was the largest human migration in history. Currently it has a population of 490,000 in the city and over two million in the metropolitan area. 

The pace of life is somewhat slower than in other large Californian cities. The city is generally viewed as being affordable for being a large California city.

Sacramento's climate consists of very hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. Being somewhat inland, the city is subject to temperature variations. In winter,  daytime highs are generally in the 50sF and nighttime lows are about 40*F. Nighttime temperatures may drop below freezing every so often. In summer, the heat can be intense with daytime temperatures hovering around 90*F; some days will see hotter temperatures. Nighttime lows are more manageable with temperatures generally in the high 50sF. 

Sacramento is subject to heat waves that can last for several days. There is also a phenomenon that may occur called "the delta breeze" when ocean air is pulled inland through the Sacramento river delta, dropping the temperature. The delta breeze tends to hit the westernmost areas of Sacramento late in the afternoon and travel east/northeast at ten to fifteen miles per hour, so the hour at which your neighborhood cools depends on your proximity to the river delta or how far west/south you reside.

Most rain falls in the fall to spring. Generally speaking, you can expect sunny days from May through October. Winter is known not only for its rain, but also its dense fog which can hamper driving conditions and reduce visibility to 100 feet (30 m) at times. Snow is rare in the city, but once every 5-10 years a light dusting occurs, and even some light accumulation away from the city. In the foothills, not far east of the city, snow is more common. Sacramento's location in the heart of California's agricultural interior gives it a blossom-laden spring as a profusion of fruit trees bloom and flower filled grassland. It also experiences a "foliage fall" -- autumn color without the severe weather that accompanies brilliant color in other parts of the nation.

The primary weather concern in Sacramento is heat in the summer and flooding in the winter. Occasional summer thunderstorms can occur; and tornadoes, although rare, can occur.

===Smoking===

Smoking is prohibited by state law at all restaurants and bars, most workplaces (workplaces with five or fewer employees are exempt from the ban as long as all workers consent), and all public buildings. It's also banned within twenty feet of any entrance, window, or exit to a public place.

===Tourist Information===

The diversity of Sacramento is not only reflected in its various neighborhoods but also in the food choices you can find here.  The places in the central district tend to be more trendy and hip while food establishments in their respective neighborhoods reflect the tastes of their residents.  Finding unique fare in suburban Sacramento, northeast of the city limits, can be difficult as many of the establishments are dominated by national or large regional chains.

==Drink==
Nightlife in Sacramento is vibrant if you know where to look. Stay in Downtown or Midtown. This is where most tourists are anyway. The upscale clubs and lounges tend to be on or near J or K Street. Directly across from the Capitol grounds is the Park which is the premiere Sacramento nightclub. The dress code and cover charges tend to be stiff.

Just around the corner is the Capitol Garage which typically has guest DJ's on Saturday and a $5 cover in a laid back atmosphere. Other popular bars in this area include Goldfields Trading Post, a country bar which typically has country performers or open mic nights, and Streets of London, a British-styled pub. 

Another popular club is Mix Downtown with stiff cover charges and dress code as well, but Mix attracts an older crowd than District 30 and less pretentious crowd than the Park. On 10th and S Street, you'll find the popular indie-rock venue Old Ironsides. Local and traveling indie-rock talent showcase their music here. Every Tuesday you can catch Lipstick, a popular indie-rock dance party where you'll find mostly hip Midtown locals. Every first Saturday of the month you can catch After Dark which is like Lipstick only on a Saturday so it attracts a more varied metropolitan crowd.

On K Street in downtown, you'll find Marilyn's, a really cool underground bar in the heart of downtown which showcases local live music talent. There are also popular bars / clubs, including Dive Bar, KBar, and District 30. In this same area is the Crest Theater, an independent historic movie theater that boasts art deco design. In the summer you can catch the French Film Festival here as well as the Trash Film Orgy, an all-night spectacle of old B movie flicks where locals gather in their cheesiest costumes.

R Street corridor, between 10th Street and 15th Street, has several nightlife options as well. Shady Lady Saloon is a popular cocktail bar with an unique saloon-type vibe. R15 is a trendy bar/restaurant (Cafe Bernardo is attached) that has an urban industrial feel. Despite being trendy the prices are very affordable with $2 Pabst on tap and $1 pool tables. They also boast couches and big screens where you can play x-box for free with a couple of friends. In between Shady Lady and R15 is Ace of Spades, a popular music venue. Near the other end of the corridor is Fox and Goose, a British pub, and Shoki Ramen House, a popular stop for a late night meal.

Other popular bars on J and K Street in Midtown, stretching from 20th Street to 28th Street, include Lowbrau, a German themed restaurant/bar, The Golden Bear, the Biergarten, a German outdoor beer garden, Red Rabbit, Blue Cue, and Barwest.

The Press Club on 21st and P Street is popular with the college crowd with its $5 cover charges and cheap $3 24oz. of Pabst. It's known for playing 80's dance music and the best nights to go are Wednesdays or Thursdays as it is a small club and, on weekends, gets unbearably overcrowded.

* <drink name="The Depot" address="corner of K and 20th downtown." phone="" email="" fax="" hours="" price="" url="">Gay-friendly video bar, two coin-op pool tables, covered smoking area.</drink>

* <drink name="Faces" alt="" address="Corner of K and 20th" directions="" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="" email="" fax="">Faces is a popular gay-friendly club. Pricey cover, but the good strong drinks can quickly make up the difference. Recently renovated, Faces has now doubled in size with an upstairs and a pool in the back! Plays R&B on video floor and House on other dance floor.</drink>

* <drink name="The Mercantile Saloon" address="20th & L street" phone="" email="" fax="" hours="" price="" url="">This is a gay-friendly bar to go to get your night started - cheap, big, strong drinks!</drink>

* <drink name="Club 21" address="On 21st, between K and L streets" phone="" email="" fax="" hours="" price="" url="">A gay-friendly establishment. It is 18+ Wednesday nights, which happens to be the only gay male night. Same owner as Faces, however generally plays upbeat, dance tunes that you can sing too.  Beware of the trolls fishing for young men on Wednesdays.  Other nights are predominantly lesbian nights.</drink>

* <drink name="Sac Badlands" address="corner of K and 20th downtown." phone="" email="" fax="" hours="" price="" url=""> This a gay-friendly club and is an offshoot of Badlands in San Francisco. It has three stories and an outdoor patio.</drink>
*<drink name="Benny's" alt="Q Street Bar" address="21st and Q" directions="across from the Sacramento Bee." phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="">Casual and often-crowded dive not far from midtown. Large back area provides extra room. On busy nights, a bartender will operate in back as well. Great place for drinks, and the Mexican food next door is a popular after-the-bar stopoff.</drink>
*<drink name="Streets of London" alt="" address="18th and J" directions="" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="">Trendy "upscale dive" right in the heart of Sac's midtown nightlife. Not really big enough to compensate for its popularity anymore. Drinks are average range. Quieter with a more laid-back vibe on weeknights. It has a night outdoor area too, and a popular trivia night every week.</drink>
*<drink name="Pine Cove" alt="" address="29th and E" directions="" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="">Classic dive, possibly the best in Sacramento. Has gotten massively popular on weekends, but manages not to become unpleasant or lose its "divey" feel. Decently priced. Darts and pitchers make for a laid-back time. Avoid the popcorn machine; rumors abound about its level of sanitation. Karaoke two nights a week draws quite a crowd. </drink>
*<drink name="Blue Cue" alt="" address="27th and J" directions="" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="">Terrific bar with an upscale sports-bar feel mismatched with its unbeatable prices on food and drinks; nightly specials keep savvy locals coming back. Billiard tables rented hourly. Most major sporting events will be played (or, the staff is laid-back enough that they will change the channel upon request). The food, made in the kitchen of the delicious downstairs restaurant, is leagues away from typical "bar food". Drink prices are average, but the specials can and will yield incredible deals.</drink>

*<drink name="Old Tavern" alt="" address="near 20th and O" directions="" phone="" url="" checkin="" checkout="" price="" lat="" long="">Cheapie dive/neighborhood bar with a cool atmosphere. A great stopoff before or after heading to nearby Town House or Benny's. At $1.75 for a pint of beer and $3 for a shot of whiskey, these may be the cheapest drinks in town!</drink>

All branches of the '''Sacramento Public Library''' system [http://www.saclibrary.org/] offer '''free internet access''', via public terminals and wireless.  The most centrally located branch is the large '''Central Library''' located at 9th and I Streets but there are branch libraries in every part of the Sacramento metropolitan area.  Only the Central Library and the regional Carmichael Library are open on Sundays.

===Telephones===
'''916''' is the area code for most of the Sacramento metropolitan area with '''530''' used in outlaying areas.

==Stay safe==
Downtown has a lot of one way streets which can be confusing and are not always well marked so look at the direction in which cars are parked.

Sacramento is generally a safe place to visit.  As with any other urban and major city area, no matter where you are, stay safe.  Be aware of your surroundings, lock your car doors, don't carry a large amount of cash, and don't wear flashy clothing or jewelry. 

As with other large metropolitan areas, there are neighborhoods that deserve more caution than others at night.  Be cautious while in the following areas:

Central District--especially at night.  Most of the businesses close up early, though the nightclubs there can draw crowds and those looking for trouble especially after too much to drink.  

South Sacramento Area--especially at night. It has been cleaned up in recent years but there are still rough patches especially around Martin Luther King Junior Boulevard, Fruitridge Road, Franklin Boulevard, Mack Road, and Meadowview Road.

North Highlands--at night, prostitutes are usually strolling Watt Avenue between Roseville Road and I-80.  The motels at Longview Drive and I-80 are some of the worst in the north Sacramento area. Avoid them if at all possible.

Del Paso Heights used to be of the worst crime infested areas in the Sacramento Region, but has recently attracted numerous galleries, boutiques and restaurants. Stay safe, but there's no reason to avoid it.

==Get out==
Part of the beauty of Sacramento is its central location. It's sometimes possible to go skiing in the morning, and surfing in the afternoon. All within a couple hours by car:

* [[Truckee]] and '''Donner Pass''', about 100 miles east of Sacramento on I-80. Be prepared in wintertime, as the elevation is over 7,000 ft. Highway conditions may require tire chains due to snow. This also includes Reno/Tahoe (below), which are further east via I-80.
* [[Lake Tahoe]], a gorgeous lake on the [[Nevada]] border. It has the highest concentration of ski resorts in the United States, and is popular in the summer time for hiking, biking, and water activities on the lake. There are also gambling casinos on the Nevada side of the lake.
* [[Reno]], a little bit o' gambling just over the border in [[Nevada]]. It is around a 2 hour drive.
* [[Gold Country]], The gold country encompasses several small towns in the Sierra Nevada foothills, including hub towns such as [[Auburn]], [[Placerville]], and [[Sutter Creek]]. [[Coloma]] is where the gold rush began. Gold Country is also known for white water rafting in the summer, and there is a growing wine region in Amador and El Dorado counties.
* [[San Francisco]], does it need an introduction? San Francisco and surrounding sites including [[Oakland]], [[Berkeley]], [[San Jose]], [[Marin County]], which includes Muir Woods and Sausalito, and the [[Pacific Ocean]] are all between a range of a 1 and a half to 2 hour drive, depending on traffic.
* [[Napa Valley]], gorgeous landscape and the most famous wine-tasting in the United States. The city of [[Napa]] is about an hour drive from Sacramento, while the town of [[Sonoma]] is about an extra 45 minutes further.
* [[Apple Hill]] is an apple growing region just past [[Placerville]], under an hour drive from Sacramento. It is a popular destination in the Fall and early Winter, with a myriad of local orchards selling different apple products. There are also several wineries in Apple Hill.
* [[Six Flags Discovery Kingdom]] is the Six Flags for both the Sacramento and San Francisco area, located between the two regions in Vallejo. It is around a 45 minute drive from Sacramento.
* [[Jelly Belly Factory]] offers tours of the factory. It is located in Fairfield, about 45 minutes outside of Sacramento.
