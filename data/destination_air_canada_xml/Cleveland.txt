'''[http://www.positivelycleveland.com/ Cleveland]''' is a culturally diverse city on the shores of Lake Erie, one of the [[Great Lakes]], in [[Cuyahoga County]], [[Ohio]], [[United States]]. Recreational, cultural and educational opportunities are abundant throughout [[Northeast Ohio]]. You'll find world-class museums and cultural events, professional sports and amusement parks, and the most golf courses per capita in the [[United States]]. ''Places Rated Almanac'' ranks the area second in recreational options out of 354 US metro areas. This region ranks fifth in the nation in number of major cultural resources per one million residents.  It is known as the "Rock n Roll Capital" (due to the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame), the "Forest City" (due to the historically forested nature of the city), and the “Sixth City” (due to its population rank in the US in the early 1900’s).

Cleveland is the urban center of [[Northeast Ohio]], the 15th largest combined metropolitan area in the United States. From 1890 until 1970 per US Census Bureau statistics, Cleveland  was ranked as one of the 10 largest cities in the U.S. Like most U.S. cities, Cleveland began to lose population to suburban areas in the 1960s and 1970s. However, in the mid-1980s, Cleveland earned the nickname the "Comeback City" as the urban core experienced a dramatic revitalization process that continues today. As its "comeback" has continued, the ''official'' moniker is now the '''New American City''' as Cleveland has rightfully earned the reputation as a model of effective public-private partnership for urban planning.

Despite the common perception that Cleveland is an industrial town, just beyond the automotive and steel plants, a clean and beautiful downtown rises at the mouth of the Cuyahoga River on the southern shore of Lake Erie (often marvelled over by visitors who are surprised you can't see the other side, i.e., Canada). Like other cities in the so-called "rust belt", Cleveland has endured growing pains as it makes its transition from a manufacturing-based economy. While Cleveland continues to play a leading role in building the U.S. industrial base, it has also developed economic prowess in the fields of health care, law, finance, insurance, real estate development, and professional services.

===History===

The city of Cleveland bears its name from General Moses Cleaveland, an investor and lead surveyor in the Connecticut Land Company, which first settled the area. The spelling of the city's name differs from that of its namesake as a result of a spelling error that appeared on the original map, and Cleveland has been spelled thusly ever since.

The first survey of the land was finished in 1796 and included 220 lots on the east bank of the Cuyahoga River. The town had difficulty experiencing population growth, and only three men reportedly lived in the town as of 1800, and only about 57 people are said to have called Cleveland home in 1810. Although the population was small, Cleveland became the county seat of Cuyahoga County in 1807.

Despite its seemingly prime location near Lake Erie, Cleveland did not start gaining population until the War of 1812 had finished and the threat of Native American attacks had ended. The accessibility to water provided a foundation for a marketplace where farmers and merchants came together to exchange their goods, but the poor quality roads kept Clevelanders virtually exiled from the rest of Ohio.

Cleveland experienced revival during the 1820s when the Erie Canal provided easy access to the Atlantic Ocean. Commerce and residential development were able to really begin taking off after the Erie Canal connected Lake Erie with the Ohio River a decade or so later. Once the railway arrived in Cleveland in the decades that followed, the town began to see substantial population growth, taking the city from under 1,000 residents to more than 40,000 in forty years.

Cleveland's proximity to trade routes, coupled with abundant natural resources, began attracting the likes of business tycoons by the names of John D. Rockefeller and Samuel Mather. As the Industrial Revolution steamed ahead, Cleveland became a hub for coal, iron ore and steel production. By 1880, 28% of the city's jobs were based around the steel industry, but when the Great Depression set in, many of these industrial facilities were forced to lay off labor to try to stay afloat. By 1933, a whopping 33% of the city's residents were unemployed.

Although Cleveland has struggled economically throughout the years, the city is still known as a place where cultural and social activities are strong. The city's first amusement park opened in 1894, which was officially named Euclid Beach Park but became affectionately known as Coney Island. Professional baseball arrived in 1901 and still remains to this day. 

Today, the town boasts of MLB, NBA and NFL teams, notable museums such as the Cleveland Museum of Art and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and area attractions that visitors and locals alike enjoy such as Cedar Point and the Cleveland Aquarium.

===Climate===

Cleveland has what is known as a continental climate. In laymen's terms, this means that Cleveland tends to be warm to hot in the summer, cold to freezing in the winter. Cleveland does have four seasons, with its most mild weather occurring in the fall (September - November) and during its relatively short spring (April and May). Owing to its proximity to Lake Erie, Cleveland tends to stay on the cooler side throughout the year. Temperatures typically range from a low in the 30s in January, to highs in the 80s in July.

Winter is by far the harshest season in Cleveland. Winter weather typically begins in November and lasts through March. Lake Erie, the same lake that helps gives Cleveland its mild temperatures, also helps account for the approximately 68" of snow that get dumped on the city each year. Fortunately, Cleveland loves its white winters. Locals simply pile on the layers and head outside for snowball fights and cross-country snow shoe expeditions. And the city is well-equipped with snow plows; main roads are typically plowed long before anyone can think of calling in "sick" to work.

Spring really kicks into gear in April. While Cleveland does not have a rainy season per se, rain is a relatively common occurrence this time of year. As the weather warms up and the snow begins to melt, the trees and flowers start to put on a show. Magnolia and cherry trees burst into bloom and daffodils and crocuses begin opening their petals. The weather during this time of year is still relatively cool, with highs around 60°F. Travelers will want to dress in layers and pack some rain gear to ensure that a sudden rain shower does not spoil their day.

Summer, which typically lasts from June until the leaves start to turn in September, is characterized by warm weather. Temperatures routinely reach the high 70s (26°C). While the humidity in Cleveland is not as intense as it is farther east, it can make the days feel significantly warmer than they actually are. Travelers arriving in late summer/early fall will want to pack an umbrella. September is considered Cleveland's wettest month.

Like its more famous brethren to the east, Cleveland has foliage that turns almost every color of the rainbow during fall. Fall temperatures are slightly lower than those experienced in the summer, with highs in the low 70s (21°C) during the day.

Cleveland experiences four seasons, with vibrant spring blossoms, hot humid summers, colorful autumns, and frigid winters. 
*July, on average, is the warmest month with a mean temperature of 71.9 °F (22.2 °C); however, Cleveland summers often experience temperatures in the high 80's to low 90's °F with relatively high humidity.
*January, on average, is the coldest month with a mean temperature of 25.7 °F (−3.5 °C). Cleveland winters are cold, but the city usually experiences just a handful of heavy snowfalls, but does have the occasional windchill factor below 0 °F. Also, Cleveland has what is called ''Lake Effect'' snow from mid-November until the surface of Lake Erie freezes, typically by early February. This is snowfall due to Cleveland's position on the southern shore of Lake Erie, at the point where the shoreline shifts from an east-west direction to a northeast-southwest orientation. The city (primarily the East Side) experiences this ''Lake Effect'' snow. Cleveland's ''Snow Belt'', which receives substantially more snowfall than the West Side, begins on the East Side of the city (spreading southward from the Lake for up to 10 miles in Greater Cleveland) and stretches northeast along the I-90 corridor past [[Buffalo (New York)|Buffalo, New York]] as far as [[Syracuse (New York)|Syracuse]].
*Due to its proximity to Lake Erie, autumn in Cleveland has some enjoyable weather that time of year. Some years, high-60-degree weather can be enjoyed through Halloween, without the humidity of the summer months.

===People===

Cleveland is a city that was born largely from the Industrial Revolution. As such, the major population booms in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were fueled by immigrants seeking blue-collar industrial work. Although this laid the foundation for a melting pot of cultures back then, the cultural mix has slowed in recent decades.

As of 2010, 53.3% of the city's population was African American. The next largest demographic, in terms of race, are white residents, who make up about 37.3% of the city's population. The male to female ratio in Cleveland is just about equal, with women comprising about 52% of the population.

Only about 12% of people speak a language other than English at home, and the population of foreign-born persons is less than 5%, which is one of the lowest in the country. 

Because of Cleveland's history in the automotive and industrial ages in America, many of the jobs in the city are blue-collar working-class careers. Approximately 76% of the population has graduated from high school (or equivalent), but only about 13% hold a bachelor's degree.

In Cleveland, 52.7% of people claim to be affiliated with a religion, with Catholicism being the predominant religion. Approximately 30% of citizens are Catholic, followed by about 17% who affiliate with another Christian religion. 2.4% of the population is Jewish, and less than 1% of the population practices LDS, Eastern faiths or Islam.


===Literature===
Founded on the banks of Lake Erie, Cleveland has a rich history as the quintessential American melting pot. The early 20th century witnessed its rise to become the 5th largest city in America. It was a booming metropolis that was home to car manufacturers, jazz musicians migrating north and large populations of immigrants from Eastern European. Authors from (and literature set in) the city explored the working class experience and varied facets of Cleveland culture. The second half of the 20th and early 21st century saw a changed city. White flight, declining auto manufacturing and corruption in city government all conspired to leave an abandoned Cleveland with crumbling infrastructure. These Cleveland authors write about and are informed by these experiences in the city. 

*‘’’Toni Morrison’’’ was born in Ohio, her parents having moved north to escape the racism of the south. She grew up to have a successful career as a novelist, editor and professor. Her works have earned her a Pulitzer Prize, an American Book Award, a Nobel Prize and a Presidential Medal of Freedom. She writes intricately crafted characters engaging in epic themes through captivating narratives. In so doing, she has been instrumental in bringing black literature into mainstream American culture. 

*The poet ‘’’Langston Hughes’’’ spent his early years across the Midwest, but eventually settled in Cleveland during his formative high school years. During that time, he began his literary career, writing for the school newspaper, editing the yearbook and writing his first poems, short stories and plays. His first ‘’’jazz poem’’’, “When Sue Wears Red” was written while he was still in high school. He was an early innovator of jazz poetry, and became one of the leaders of the '''Harlem Renaissance.'''

*‘’’John Stark Bellamy’’’ writes about crime and disasters in Cleveland. He comes from a long line of Cleveland residents, and was a history specialist for the Cuyahoga County Public Library before becoming an author. In addition to a number of novels, he’s also written two anthologies of disasters throughout Cleveland’s history. ‘’Cleveland’s Greatest Disasters!: 16 Tragic True Tales of Death and Destruction” highlights locations all over Cleveland that were hit with disasters like fires, explosions and collapsing buildings. 

*Visitors may enjoy reading ‘’Showplace of America: Cleveland’s Euclid Avenue” before their visit to learn about the heart of [[Downtown]], and what was, for a time, one of the foremost residential streets in America. It goes into detail about the architects that helped to establish the avenue, as well as some of its wealthy and famous residents. The author, ‘’’Jan Cigliano’’’, gives a behind-the-scenes look into the height of Cleveland’s upper class. 

*’’’Les Roberts’’’ calls Cleveland his spiritual home. He is beloved by Cleveland residents for his creation of the fictional detective Milan Jacovich. The detective stars in the Roberts’ series of mystery novels, which are set in Cleveland, and have earned the writer the title of “Cleveland’s Favorite Author” several times.

*''The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History'' - the rich history of Cleveland includes the story of the industrial revolution, the roots of a vibrant arts and cultural mecca, and description of the proto-typical 'melting pot' of America. This is a thick book, but answers just about any question that arises - perhaps plan a stop at a Cleveland or Cuyahoga County Public Library.

===Politics===

"Ohio is often a hot bed for political controversy. The three major cities, Cincinnati, Columbus and Cleveland, tend to cause all eyes to focus on the state when elections come around. To the south, Cincinnati is a very red area on the map. In the middle, Columbus turns purple, with varied (yet equal) views on many sides of the spectrum. To the north, Cleveland tends to lean more left with a preference toward Democratic viewpoints.

This inclination towards voting blue could be attributable to a number of factors. To begin with, the largest population of people who move to Cleveland come from the New York City area. Approximately 2,000 New Yorkers move to Cleveland annually, bringing with them their generally more liberal political views.

Cleveland's demographics may also have something to do with the inclination to vote Democratic. According to CNN Politics' Election Center, a number of relative findings occurred during the 2010 exit polls. In this study, 89% of African Americans voted Democratic and more than half of those polled who were between the ages of 18 and 29 voted Democratic. In Cleveland, the African American population is over 53%, and the number of residents between the ages of 18 and 29 is fairly substantial as well.

Cleveland's median household income as of 2013 was $26,217, which could also play a part in the leaning toward democratic candidates during elections. CNN indicated that 57% of voters who live in household of less than $30,000 voted for Democrats while 51% of those who make between $30,000 and $50,000 voted for Democrats.

In this battleground state, voters are often tasked with making decisions that the rest of the country is watching. As such, Cleveland often hosts highly visible round table discussions and political debates that are televised for all the world to see. This is a state where politicians frequently come to woo undecided voters."

* '''[http://www.clevelandairport.com/ Cleveland Hopkins International Airport]''' ({{IATA|CLE}}, {{ICAO|KCLE}})  is located 13 miles southwest of Downtown. The RTA Red Line Rapid Transit provides frequent and fast rail service from the airport to downtown for $2.25.

* '''[http://www.akroncantonairport.com/ Akron-Canton Airport] ({{IATA|CAK}}) is located 50 miles south of Cleveland in [[Akron]] and is served by most major U.S. airlines.

* '''[http://www.burkeairport.com/ Burke Lakefront Airport]''' is a small airport located downtown right on the shore of Lake Erie that handles private jet, business, and general aviation traffic.

* '''[[Cuyahoga County]] Airport''' is located in northeastern Cuyahoga County and serves private planes.  

===By car===
Four two-digit interstate highways serve Cleveland:

* '''Interstate 71''' runs primarily west before heading due south into the suburbs, and most directly connects downtown to '''Cleveland Hopkins International Airport''' (via Ohio 237), the lower west suburbs (via I-480), the southwest suburbs, and eventually the state capital of [[Columbus (Ohio)|Columbus]].  The curved section of I-71 that runs between W 25th Street and I-90/490 is referred to as the '''Metro Curve''', due to its proximity to '''MetroHealth Medical Center'''.

* '''Interstate 77''', shown on maps as the '''Willow Freeway''' is Cleveland's oldest freeway, and heads due south from the Innerbelt along the east side of the Cuyahoga Valley and most directly connects downtown to the south suburbs, southeast suburbs (via I-480), Ohio Turnpike (I-80), and the city of [[Akron]].  The stack interchange at I-480 is sometimes referred to as '''The Cloverleaf''', although the actual cloverleaf is located at the junction of Brecksville Road and Granger Road, which is just west of the later extension of the Willow Freeway.

* '''Interstate 80/Ohio Turnpike''' is a toll road that connects the Greater Cleveland with [[Toledo (Ohio)|Toledo]] to the west, and [[Youngstown (Ohio)|Youngstown]] and [[Pittsburgh]] to the east.  Access to the city and its suburbs is from I-90, I-480 Eastbound, I-71, I-77, Ohio 8, and I-480 Westbound.

* '''Interstate 90''' connects the two sides (the terms "East Side" and "West Side" have deep root in defining this region) of Cleveland, and is the northern terminus for both I-71 and I-77.  I-90 separates from the Ohio Turnpike just west of [[Elyria (Ohio)|Elyria]] and joins with Ohio 2 until Ohio 2 separates at Detroit Road in the west side suburb of Rocky River.  I-90 then proceeds to I-71, I-490, and the Jennings Freeway (Ohio 176) in the Tremont neighborhood, and over the Innerbelt Bridge into downtown; from this confluence of freeways, I-90 is known as '''The Innerbelt''', until it again merges with Ohio 2 at '''Dead Man's Curve''' and becomes the '''East Shoreway'''.  I-90 once and for all splits from Ohio 2 near the Cuyahoga-Lake County line at the '''Euclid Spur''', which connects to the northern terminus of I-271 and then parallels the lakeshore to [[Erie|Erie, PA]].

Several other freeways also serve the city:
* '''Interstate 271''' runs primarily north and south through the city's east suburbs, forming '''The Outerbelt East''', which connects to I-90 at the end of the Euclid Spur in Lake County and I-71 just north of Medina.  I-480 briefly follows I-271, and Ohio 8 connects I-271 to [[Akron]] in the south.

* '''Interstate 480''' runs east-west along the southern edge of the City of Cleveland, forming '''The Outerbelt South'''.  It is a loop route into the city that both begins and ends at the Ohio Turnpike (I-80).  I-480 is also the primary route to access Hopkins Airport from the east suburbs.

* '''Interstate 490''' connects I-71, I-90, and the Jennings Freeway (Ohio 176) on the near west side to I-77 on the near east side just south far enough to bypass much of downtown traffic.

* The '''West Shoreway''', which is also '''Ohio 2''', follows the lakeshore across downtown west from I-90 past the '''Rock and Roll Hall of Fame''' and '''Edgewater Park''' to just short of the west side suburb of [[Lakewood (Ohio)|Lakewood]].

* The '''Jennings Freeway''' (part of '''Ohio 176''') connects I-90/490 to I-480 on the west side of the Cuyahoga Valley.  It serves as an effective alternate route to I-71 and I-77 from I-480 to downtown.

* The '''Berea Freeway''' (part of '''Ohio 237''') connects I-71 and I-480 to '''Cleveland Hopkins International Airport''' and the southwest suburb of Berea.

* '''Ohio 2''' connects far east lakeshore suburbs in [[Lake County (Ohio)|Lake County]] to I-90 and I-271 (via the Euclid Spur).

* '''Ohio 10/US 20''' connects [[Oberlin (Ohio)|Oberlin]] in southern [[Lorain County]] to I-480 at its western terminus at the Ohio Turnpike.

* '''US 422''' becomes a freeway at I-271/I-480 and connects to the far southeast suburbs and Warren farther to the east.

==Get around==

===By car===
Cleveland might be one of the easiest cities in the world to navigate. There are almost no one-way streets, because the city was planned to have "European Avenues" (which resulted in the foresight to make them broad enough for vehicular transportation that couldn't have been imagined in the late 1700s). Traffic is generally not a problem relative to other major U.S. metro areas. Throughout the downtown area, purple signs direct visitors to let you know where you are and what district you are in. The streets that run north-south are numbered, except for Ontario Street (the north-south street bisecting Public Square). Numbered Streets are named as "West", west of Ontario and "East", east of Ontario. (Broadview Road becomes the primary geographic boundary between 'East' and 'West' addresses to the south of the city.) The major east-west streets are generally named as "Avenues". Navigating the Eastern "Heights" areas (near University Circle) can be a challenge with their more complicated road layouts and relative distance from the major freeways, but the roads are still well-maintained and traffic is still nothing out of the ordinary. 

Finding an address is simple as well.  Numbers on north-south streets increase as you head south from Lake Erie, numbers on east-west streets increase as you head away from downtown and coincide with the numbered streets (i.e. 6500 Detroit Ave is located at the corner of Detroit Ave and W 65th St).  Odd addresses on north-south streets are for buildings on the east side of the street, and even addresses are on the west side; on the west side of Cleveland, odd addresses on east-west streets are located on the south side of the street, while even addresses are on the north side--the reverse is true for east-west streets on the east side of Cleveland.  This addressing scheme continues into most of the suburbs (some exceptions include Berea and Bedford) and even most cities and townships in Lake and Lorain Counties.

Most of the city is laid out in grids and has very clear signage enabling you to easily know where you are.  Throughout the area, signs are thoroughly placed to indicate the route to the nearest major freeway, making the city extremely visitor-friendly!

Cleveland rush hours (7AM-9AM; 4PM-6:30PM in the afternoon) are light compared to many metropolitan areas, with traffic still moving near posted speed limits throughout most of the area.  Some places notorious for slow or stop and go traffic are:

Morning:
* '''I-71 Northbound''' from W 25th St into Downtown and from Bagley Rd to I-480
* '''I-77 Northbound''' from I-490 into Downtown and from Pleasant Valley Rd to I-480
* '''I-90 Eastbound''' from W 44th St into Downtown
* '''I-90 Westbound''' from E 55th St into Downtown
* '''I-271 Northbound''' from Rt. 8 to I-480
* '''I-480 Eastbound''' from the Jennings Freeway (Ohio 176) to I-77 and approaching I-271
* '''Jennings Freeway (Ohio 176)''' from I-480 to I-90/490

Afternoon:
* '''I-71 Southbound''' from I-480/Ohio 237 to Bagley Rd
* '''I-77 Southbound''' from downtown to I-490 and from I-480 to Pleasant Valley Rd
* '''I-90 Westbound''' from E 55th St to the Innerbelt Bridge
* '''I-90 Eastbound''' from downtown to Dead Man's Curve
* '''I-271 Southbound''' from Chagrin Blvd to Broadway Ave./Forbes Rd.
* '''I-480 Westbound''' from W 130th St to I-71/Ohio 237

Road construction can impact travel times at rush hours, and usually occurs only from March to November.  Any point in [[Cuyahoga County]] is normally reachable from any other point in the county by car in 45 minutes or less at non-peak driving hours.

===By public transit===
Greater Cleveland is also served by a public bus and rail transit system, operated by the '''Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority''' [http://www.gcrta.org/], also known as "RTA". The rail portion is officially called the Cleveland Rapid Transit, but is known by locals as "The Rapid". It consists of two light rail lines, known as the Green and Blue Lines (which extend to the east side suburbs), and a heavy rail line, the Red Line (which connects Cleveland Hopkins International Airport and the west side suburbs with Tower City Center downtown and continues to University Circle and beyond). In the late 1990s, RTA added the Waterfont Line, a short track specifically catering to tourists by connecting Tower City Center to the Flats Entertainment District, Cleveland Browns Stadium, Great Lakes Science Center, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Burke Lakefront Airport. In 2008, RTA installed a bus rapid transit line, called the "Health Line", which runs along Euclid Avenue, providing a direct route between Cleveland's primary tourist attractions from downtown to University Circle. A $5.50 All-Day Pass is good for unlimited rides on both the trains and the buses.

===By bicycle===
Greater Cleveland is expanding its bicycle trails and bicycle paths throughout the city. In addition, the city has numerous bicycle shops, mostly located on the near west side, and a bicycle co-op.[http://ohiocitycycles.org/] For more information on biking in cleveland, visit the website of Bike Cleveland.[http://bikecleveland.org/]

Perched on the shores of Lake Erie and the Cuyahoga River, Cleveland is the second largest city in Ohio. Since the 1980's, the city has experienced a resurgence in popularity with Ohio residents and tourists alike. Visitors can explore cultural attractions and historical landmarks from the city’s legacy as a manufacturing center at the turn of the 19th century. Amongst the walkable neighborhoods of world class architecture are thriving arts and theater districts, museums and a conventions center. 

===Landmarks===

The city’s proud history in manufacturing throughout the industrial revolution produced a number of historical landmarks. A short distance from [[Cleveland/Downtown|Downtown]], [[Cleveland/East Side|University Circle]] is a 550-acre concentration of notable museums, botanic gardens, historical societies and hospitals. In fact, it's the densest concentration of cultural attractions in the United States.

*In the [[Cleveland/West Side|West Side]] district, the ‘’’West Side Market’’’ is a huge farmers market with artisan goods, fresh produce, baked goods and prepared food. Many of the sellers offer deals at the end of the day on their products. 

*Movie fans have to make a stop by the ‘’’Christmas Story House’’’ in the [[Cleveland/West Side|Tremont]] neighborhood. A developer purchased and then restored it to an accurate portrayal (both inside and out) of the house in the movie.

===Neighborhoods===

Like many smaller cities in the United States, Cleveland experiences some amount of sprawl; the city limits contain a lot of square miles. Within that sprawl, however, are a number of walkable neighborhoods with restaurants, shopping, galleries and cafes. 

*[[Tremont]] has the greatest concentrations of galleries in the city, as well as new theaters, cafes and popular dining spots. The city’s professionals and artists alike are drawn to living in this neighborhood and are frequently out in the evenings. 

*[[Ohio City]] is considered Cleveland’s “Artisan Neighborhood” and has micro breweries, a number of eclectic shops for finding unique accessories and cafes for gourmet treats. 

*[[Coventry Village]] is the neighborhood to go to for a real metropolitan experience. Visitors can shop locally-sourced food, antique shops and plenty of retail locations for unique additions to every wardrobe. 

===Museums===

Cleveland has a number of world class museums, many of which opened in recent years during the city’s revitalization efforts. There are institutions for visitors to explore art, culture, history and science. 

*Perhaps the most famous museum in Cleveland is in [[Downtown]]; the '''Rock and Roll Hall of Fame’’’ is a must-do for every visitor and local alike. 

===Parks===

The city constructed the Cleveland Metroparks system, which is an extensive group of nature preserves throughout the [[Greater Cleveland]] area that border many of the rivers throughout the region. Within the metropolitan area, there are four parks of that system. 

*On the [[Near West Side]] ‘’’Edgewater Park’’’ is right on the banks of Lake Erie and a popular spot in the warmer months for families and locals.

*Across from [[Euclid Avenue]] the largest park in Cleveland, ‘’’Rockefeller Park’’’, contains within its borders cultural gardens, a greenhouse, a seven-mile stream that determined the mapping of the park, and landmark late 19th century bridges."

===Churches=== 
Particularly visit the '''Tremont''' district in [[Cleveland/West_Side|West Side]] (where the movie, ''The Deer Hunter'', was filmed) and the '''Church Square''' district along Euclid Avenue between [[Cleveland/Downtown|Downtown]] and University Circle (where you can see a broad sampling of houses of prayer, many of which are currently utilized by their second or third generations of faith). There are also several monumental churches in near east side suburbs of Cleveland Heights and Shaker Heights along Cedar Road, Fairmount and Shaker Boulevards.

===Sports===

Enjoy a game with the ''world's best sports fans''. Cleveland is home to the second longest span of sold out baseball games (5 consecutive seasons in the late 1990s), the largest American League baseball attendance (72,086 on 8/9/1981) and the birthplace of Monday Night Football (9/21/1970).  But given its storied sports past coupled with its weathered but dedicated fan base (ESPN named Cleveland the "Most Tortured Sports City"), terms like ''The Drive'', ''The Fumble'', ''The Shot'', ''The Decision'', ''2 More Outs'' will ring in the ears of Cleveland Sports Fans for generations to come. Cleveland sports fans' loyalty paid off when the Cavaliers won the NBA championship in 2016. Win or lose, Clevelanders (obviously) just love sports.

====Sporting Events====

* '''Cleveland Marathon''' [http://www.clevelandmarathon.com] long-distance runners gather from around the globe each spring to ''Rock 'n Run'' downtown.

* ''' MAC Basketball Championships''' [http://mac-sports.cstv.com/] the Mid-American Conference of NCAA Division I college basketball holds its annual championship in early March at "the Q" (Quicken Loans Arena) to determine a ''March Madness'' tournament seed.

* '''Greater Cleveland Sports Commission''' [http://www.clevelandsports.org], every year Cleveland hosts major national and international sports events.

===Outdoors===
* '''No "mistake" about it! - Lake Erie'''.  The shallowest and warmest Great Lake (with the most vibrant fishery) defines Cleveland's northern border and provides many opportunities for boating, fishing, swimming and walks.  Sailers, boaters, waverunners and jet skiers enjoy the lake with marinas, piers and boat launches available all along America's '''North Coast'''. Fishing is popular more than three seasons of the year with healthy populations of Walleye and Perch in Lake Erie.  In the late fall and early winter, anglers pursue steelhead trout in the many rivers feeding Lake Erie up through Northeast Ohio and into Pennsylvania and Western New York.

* Historically nicknamed the '''"Forest City"''' (due to a famous description of a highly sophisticated society amid a heavily forested environment in Alexis DeTocqueville's "Democracy in America" (1831)), Cleveland is a great place for outdoor activities.  '''USA Today''' ranked Cleveland among the 10 best big cities for hiking. If you think Cleveland is just a "rust belt" city, get out to the nearest '''Cleveland Metropark''' [http://www.clemetparks.com/]. The parks form an '''Emerald Necklace''' around the Cleveland metropolitan area, so no matter which direction you go from downtown, you're headed toward a park. Biking, horseback riding, jogging and rollerblading are easily accommodated by the miles of trails (paved and unpaved) encircling Cuyahoga County.  In the winter, visitors can cross country ski these same trails.  Sitting upon the foothills of the Allegheny Mountains, Cleveland also provides downhill skiers with slopes throughout the area.
[[Image:Cleveland S of river.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Cuyahoga River]]

*'''A river winds through it.''' Boaters, rowing crews, canoers and kayakers enjoy the diverse scenery along the Cuyahoga (a Mohawk Native American term, meaning "Crooked River").  The Cuyahoga provides a mosaic of the nightspots of the Flats (dockage available at restaurants and bars), downtown's towers rising up the hill, active industrial remnants of the birthplace of the petroleum and steel industries, pastoral settings and the Ohio and Erie Canal (which in the 1800s provided the connection between the Great Lakes and the Ohio River, ultimately enabling shipping from the Atlantic Ocean (via the St. Lawrence Seaway and the East Coast) to the Gulf of Mexico (via the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers)). The '''Ohio & Erie Canal''' has been preserved as a core element of '''[[Cuyahoga Valley National Park]]'''. In Ohio's only National Park, walk or bike the '''Canal Towpath''', [http://www.nps.gov/cuva/planavisit/todo/recreation/ohioerie.htm]. The National Park starts 8 miles south of downtown and stretches for miles down to Akron. The Towpath extends from Lake Erie in Downtown Cleveland through the southern suburbs past [[Akron]], [[Canton (Ohio)|Canton]], [[New Philadelphia]] and into rural [[Bolivar (Ohio)|Bolivar]] and Historic [[Zoar]].

[[Image:Cleveland Clinic.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Cleveland Clinic]]

Five major industries have evolved to become the economic strength of the region: Health & Medicine, Science & Engineering, Biotechnology & Biomedical, Manufacturing and Education. In addition to 12 ''Fortune 1000'' headquarters, more than 150 international companies have a presence here. ''Site Selection'' magazine ranked Ohio as first in the U.S. with the most corporate facility projects and expansions in 2007.

Of particular note, the Cleveland Clinic Health System is a world-renowned treatment center that has treated dignitaries from all over the world, most notably King Fahd of Saudi Arabia

Also of note is Quicken Loans and their Cleveland Web Center. This medium size company founded by Dan Gilbert (also owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers) boasts being the fourth largest Veteran Lender in the nation as well as the tenth best place to work for in the entire nation rated by Fortune. Quicken Loans has been listed many times as one of the best places to work at years before as well.

{{districtify}}
Downtown Cleveland is home to '''Tower City Center''', a large urban complex, a retail mall, hotels and the '''Terminal Tower'''.  Shops range from high-end to standard mall franchises.  The food court has great views of the river.  Tower City is connected by walkway to the Tower City Amphitheater, the Quicken Loans Arena and Progressive Field, and the federal courthouse.  Rapid Transit lines head west to the airport as well as through University Circle and suburbs to the east.

'''The Galleria at Erieview''' is another complex downtown that includes a popular lunchtime foodcourt.  It has recently been hosting art galleries and art events.

'''Shaker Square''' is an historic shopping center built in 1929 and connected to downtown and the eastern suburbs by two Rapid Transit lines.  The Square includes some interesting shops and restaurants and serves as the center of a diverse, lively neighborhood.

Shoppers have been flocking to Northeast Ohio since the development of several lifestyle centers have attracted upscale retailers.  On the East Side, '''Legacy Village''' (in Lyndhurst) has been added to Cleveland's ''fashion district'' along Cedar Road (which includes '''Beachwood Place''' and La Place in Beachwood). Nearby, '''Eton Collection''' (on Chagrin Boulevard in Woodmere) provides even more upscale options for shopping and dining.  On the West Side, '''Crocker Park''' (in Westlake) provides a mixed-use "new town" environment with upscale shopping.

Cleveland's active art community has galleries throughout the area with larger concentrations in '''Tremont''', '''Ohio City''' (just across the Cuyahoga River from downtown), and '''Little Italy'''.  Unique boutiques abound in the inner ring suburbs of Cleveland Heights, Shaker Heights and Lakewood.  New England charm and "mom-and-pop" shops can be found along the public squares of Western Reserve towns (settled as the Connecticut [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Western_Reserve] Western Reserve), including Chagrin Falls, Hudson, Olmsted Falls, Willoughby, Medina, Chardon and Painesville.

===Groceries and other basics===

The major supermarket chains in the Cleveland area are Giant Eagle, Dave's, Heinen's, Aldi, Whole Foods Market, and Trader Joe's. In addition the nation's two largest discount store chains Walmart and Target each have a store in Cleveland as well. The CVS and Walgreens drug store chains are also ubiquitous throughout Cleveland with many locations open twenty four hours a day.

The most important thing to pack for a trip to Cleveland may well be your appetite. Visitors will find Cleveland filled with world class restaurants featuring classic American cuisine, markets selling locally sourced Amish treats and authentic world cuisine in every neighborhood. A number of food tours introduce visitors to different districts by meal. Tour groups will take diners to sample the very best cooking, distilled from famous classic restaurants or the new and progressive pet projects of renowned chefs. Cleveland attracts cooking show stars, reality TV competitors and homegrown heroes that have made big splashes in the culinary world.  Despite the inland location, Cleveland is surprisingly renowned for its '''steamed clams''', a local delicacy to rival that of the coasts.

[[Tremont]] is the Cleveland destination for food and culture lovers. Amongst the gorgeous historical architecture, just a few minutes from [[Cleveland/Downtown|Downtown]], are a variety of fine dining options. Everything from modern, post-colonial, pan-Asian and Mediterranean-inspired cuisine is churned out by celebrity chefs who are worthy of mid-western worship. Prices tend to run towards the higher-end, with entrees around $25, but most restaurants have appetizers in the $10 range for an affordable sampling of the cuisine.

The city’s arts attractions are mostly clustered in the [[Cleveland/East Side|University Circle]] district. Museums of art, science and history, the botanic gardens and more are all within walking distance of each other and [[Cleveland/East Side|Little Italy]]. In addition to nearby Italian dining, restaurants are easy to find between cultural hot spots and run the gamut of cuisine and price. Tourists can recharge for the next museum with sandwiches from cafes, samplings from upscale European menus or a bento box from one of the Asian fusion restaurants.

[[Cleveland/East Side|Shaker Square]] is a century-old commercial district, just 10 minutes south of [[Cleveland/East Side|University Circle]]; it’s perched on the edge between the [[Shaker Heights]] suburb and the city. Known for its shopping, the historic town square also has many restaurants that are local-favorites. Most of the eateries have patio dining to take in the great people watching, frequent events, festivals and live music. In the summer there’s a farmer’s market for snagging local produce and Amish products. Free parking makes it an easy destination for travelers with vehicles, but it’s also easily accessible from [[Cleveland/Downtown|Downtown]] by public transportation.

[[Cleveland/West Side|Ohio City]] has attracted many of the celebrity chefs in Cleveland, making it full of places to have unique and memorable meals. It’s just a few minutes west of [[Downtown]] and the go-to urban oasis for bohemian locals. Boutique markets have artisan meats and cheese alongside cafes and fine dining.

Theater bugs will feel the most at home in the [[Cleveland/West Side|Detroit Shoreway]] district, where most of Cleveland’s playhouses, improv and experimental theaters reside. Luckily, there are also drool-worthy restaurants for grabbing a bite before and after catching the latest productions. Restaurants tend towards the affordable & casual, but the area is right next to the '''Gordon Square Arts District''', where evening theater goers will find more upscale dining. 

Cleveland is host to a wide variety of restaurants and is culinarily much more diverse than an outsider might suspect in the Midwest drawing on large enclaves of ethnic neighborhoods and immigration (Ohio City, '''Slavic Village''', Parma, Hough, '''Little Italy''', '''Chinatown''' and others). Certainly, Eastern European food and Soul food are big in a city where Hungarians, Slavs, Poles, Czechs, Bohemians and Southern African Americans were drawn to the steel and automotive industries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; however, recent emigres have spiced up the mix, adding many more influences including Indian, Chinese, Southeast Asian, Puerto Rican and Central American, Middle Eastern and Mediterranean.

Cleveland is also famous for introducing the Cleveland-style Cassata Cake - made with strawberries and rich custard - in the 1920s and usually served at Cleveland area weddings. Italian-American bakeries in the area are some of the best in the nation, and will often recommend their handmade sweet pastries and donuts. The Polish boy, or Po' Boy, is also a well known hometown favorite. It consists of kielbasa and saurkraut on a hot dog bun usually topped with hot sauce and served with french fries. 

In the mid-1990s Cleveland was in step with the resurgence of the restaurant industry, and has many restaurants on-par with their larger-city counterparts, many of which are located in the '''Historic Warehouse District''', '''the Flats''', '''Ohio City''', '''Tremont''', the '''Gateway Neighborhood''' and along the '''Restaurant Row''' in the East Side suburbs. In fact, the area boasts of 6 AAA Four Diamond restaurants, the most between New York and Chicago.

Today's Cleveland is not merely your Grandfather's sausage and pierogi steel town.

==Drink==

Beer drinkers will have trouble finding time to visit all the attractions highlighting the mid-western love of brewing. Not only are there phenomenal microbreweries, but many of the bars have massive draft lists of great seasonal beers, limited offerings and classic favorites. The “Comeback City” also has a revitalized club and music scene. Home of the ‘’’Rock and Roll Hall of Fame’’’, Cleveland backs up its claim on rock and roll with trendy spots showcasing local musicians and great touring bands.

Cleveland tourists traveling sans vehicle can rub elbows with locals practicing safe-partying on the ‘’’West Side Shuffle’’’. The shuttle service transports riders from [[Cleveland/Downtown|Downtown]] to a number of bars and pubs throughout the [[Cleveland/West Side|West Side]] and [[Cleveland/Downtown|Warehouse District]]. The route throughout the West Side neighborhoods changes seasonally, but drinkers can’t miss the big black school bus that stops when flagged down.

It’s easy to spend the whole evening in the Warehouse District, from sun-down to sun-up. Travelers will find great spots for cocktails and fine dining before heading out to the clubs and bars. There are plenty of spots to catch live music and entertainment. This Victorian district also boasts some of the city’s best architecture. Located just east of the Cuyahoga River, visitors can now dance and party in buildings that used to house the titans of the coal, iron and shipping industries.

Typical to the rich cultural scene of the district, [[Cleveland/East Side|University Circle]] is the place for wine bars, jazz clubs and vintage rock clubs. For late-night rockers, the more hip Warehouse District is about 20 minutes from University Circle on public transportation, so the evening can start with a glass of merlot before the theater, and end with dancing in a club at sunrise. The East Flats district is adjacent to the more popular areas and is just beginning to catch the spillover of nightlife revitalization. Hip visitors quick to jump on trends can experience intimate nightclubs and music venues without the weekend crowds that can swarm other areas.

Sports fans are likely already familiar with the [[Cleveland/Downtown|Gateway District]], which is home to the city’s stadiums. Even in the off season, great sports bars, live entertainment venues and patio dining attract a number of locals to the area. Visitors can grab a bite, stroll the narrow brick streets and catch a comedy show or some live music before grabbing a pint or martini at one of the renowned bars.

[[Cleveland/West Side|Ohio City]] is the undisputed place for microbreweries and artisanal eateries in Cleveland. Hip and bohemian locals frequently pack into the bars and breweries all weekend long. Stop by the numerous hookah bars, ethnic cafes and gourmet restaurants to pack any day trip with memorable food and drink.

*<listing name="Great Lakes Brewing Company" address="2516 Market Ave, Cleveland OH 44113" phone=”216-771-4404" url="http://greatlakesbrewing.com" hours="Mon-Thurs 11:30am-12:00am Fri-Sat 11:30am-1:00am Closed Sun"> The infamous Great Lakes Brewery is a must-visit for any Cleveland trip. There are tours of the brewery throughout the week, classic American food, great seasonal events and festivals.</listing>"

==Sleep==

[[Cleveland/Downtown|Downtown]] is likely the most convenient district for accommodations during a visit, due to its central location within the city. Getting to the [[Cleveland/East Side|East Side]], [[Cleveland/West Side|West Side]] neighborhoods and University Circle is relatively quick and easy from downtown, and it also has the densest public transportation options. Visitors who are planning on spending their evenings out and about may prefer to stay on the West Side where they can be within walking distance of nightlife, bars and restaurants. Those traveling on a budget or who aren’t particular about where they lay their head can also find a hostel and a few inexpensive hotels on the West Side.

For the most authentic ‘’’Comeback City’’’ experience, staying in one of the lovingly restored vintage hotels is the best bet. Revitalization efforts in the late 20th century focused on bringing the historic downtown hotels into the contemporary age. Vintage detailing includes stories-high atriums, interior balconies, gold leafing, arched windows and Victorian architecture. Contemporary touches provide free wifi, high thread count sheets and flat screen TVs. Many hotels are next door to historic landmarks, and blocks away from historic districts. 

Downtown also offers a few newly-constructed hotels for those who prefer the clean-lined luxury of contemporary architecture. Look near the convention center to find upscale accommodations built after the turn of the last century. 

The West Side is the best place to find charming '''bed & breakfasts''' with hands-on owner/operators who can offer up a local’s perspective on the hidden gems of Cleveland. The hip neighborhoods are also attracting new hotels to the area. They offer a different experience than then some of the downtown hotels, and instead focus on personal cozy rooms with locally sourced products for their bars & restaurants.

On the East Side are a number of boutique hotels close to the upscale shopping and historic neighborhoods. There’s also a couple of ‘’’bed & breakfasts’’’ for travelers who prefer a more personal touch where they stay. Newly constructed hotels in the district frequently feature less than 200 rooms, and have unique restaurants and bars for unwinding after a day of exploring the city. Visitors who like a spa on-site where they stay can likely find suitable accommodations on the East Side.

For travelers flying in and out of the city who prefer to keep close to the airport, most of the city’s budget hotels are near there and still a quick 20 minute drive to [[Downtown]] and the rest of Cleveland’s attractions. Cleveland’s suburbs are never far from the city, have affordable accommodations and may be more convenient for visitors who are planning on spending a portion of their visit in Amish country.

==Contact==
===Wireless connectivity===
*Intel named Cleveland as one of its four "Worldwide Digital Communities" (with [[Corpus Christi]], Texas; [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania; and [[Taipei]], Taiwan). Due to substantial capital investment in support of this distinction, Cleveland will eventually have free wifi access throughout the entire city. In the meantime, most coffee shops offer wireless internet connection as do the campuses of Cleveland State University and Case Western Reserve.  The Tower City Center in the downtown area is another spot with free wifi access.

===Phone===
Greater Cleveland, including all of Cuyahoga County, is served by AT&T.  Several other local telephone companies have networks in different portions of the county, and most cable companies also offer phone service through their networks.

*Area code '''216''' serves the City of Cleveland and the inner ring suburbs. 
*Area code '''440''' serves the balance of the suburbs along with Ashtabula, Geauga, Lake, and Lorain Counties.
*Area code '''234''' and '''330''' together serve the rest of Northeast Ohio, including Medina, Portage, Summit, and Stark Counties to the south.

All calling within Cuyahoga County (which includes all of the '''216''' area code) is toll-free, and includes toll-free calling into and from western Lake County, Chesterland in Geauga County, Columbia Township in Lorain County, and the communities abutting Cuyahoga County in Medina, and Summit Counties.

Area code '''216''' callers in the City of Cleveland can call toll-free into other communities in Lorain County, such as Elyria and North Ridgeville, while the remaining callers in Cuyahoga County can call certain areas at a reduced rate.  Some phone companies provide the extended calling area toll-free as an added benefit to compete with AT&T.

==Stay safe==
When driving at night in the city, stay in your car along major urban corridors (like Euclid, Chester and Carnegie Avenues heading east and Detroit and Lorain Avenues heading west). At night, you may want to avoid inner city neighborhoods and the City of East Cleveland in its entirety (in this case, including Euclid Ave). Additionally, if visiting the city of Bratenahl [a wealthy enclave surrounded by Cleveland on three sides and Lake Erie on the fourth side] be sure not to make a wrong turn and venture down Eddy Road as Eddy Road is a very dangerous area and should be avoided at all times, day or night. It is rather common to see drug dealers openly selling drugs even in the middle of the day or in the early/late afternoon in Cleveland and East Cleveland [the road goes through both cities] along Eddy Road.

'''East Side Driving Tip'''
Many of the city's so-called "rough" neighborhoods are on the east side.  However, tourists in general wouldn't have any reason to visit these neighborhoods.  University Circle on the east side, where all the city's main cultural instituations is safe, however. Eastern inner-ring suburbs such as Cleveland Heights, University Heights, Beachwood and Shaker Heights are all very safe.   

A good rule of thumb is - once an East Side suburban "Road" becomes an Inner City "Avenue", turn around and get directions to Euclid, Chester or Carnegie Avenues. Example: Cedar Road in the East Side Suburbs (where it becomes the "Fashion District") is a really nice corridor, but once it becomes Cedar Avenue in the City of Cleveland proper, you should pick one of the above mentioned roads that run parallel to its north. Similarly, Chagrin Boulevard (which connects the upscale communities of Shaker Heights, Beachwood (including Cleveland's "Restaurant Row" and the bulk of the East Side office market), Pepper Pike, Orange Village, Moreland Hills, Hunting Valley and Chagrin Falls) turns into Kinsman Road (an "underground pharmaceutical" neighborhood) once crossing into the City of Cleveland proper.

'''West Side Driving Tip'''
Again, staying on Lorain and Detroit Avenues, I-90, I-71 or the Shoreway (State 2) is your safest bet. However, driving West 25th (which becomes Pearl), State and Ridge isn't all that terrifying.  On the near West Side, avoid the Public Housing Projects that abut the vibrant neighborhoods of the Flats, Ohio City and Tremont.

Cleveland is ranked 7th in National Crime Rate Statistics.

Avoid eye-contact, walk assertively, stay in lit areas, be aware of bushes/trees/corner, don't walk too close to buildings,

Dial 911 from any telephone for emergency police, medical, and fire services.

==Get out==

*'''Not amused by nature?''' If you prefer to step up the pace, Northeast Ohio offers world-class amusement parks including [[Cedar Point]] (1 hour drive west to [[Sandusky]]) and Memphis Kiddie Park (in Brooklyn, Ohio), a small but fun park for the little ones (toddlers to pre-teens).

[[Image:Thornburg Station small.jpg|thumb|250px|Thornburg Station in the Cuyahoga Valley National Park]]
* '''[[Cuyahoga Valley National Park]]'''.  Located south of Cleveland, this park follows the course of the Cuyahoga River and the historic Ohio & Erie Canal between Cleveland and Akron. A number of older buildings are preserved here. The '''Cuyahoga Scenic Railroad''', with train cars from the 1940s and 1950s also runs through the park. Pick up the train in Valley View near '''Thornburg Station''' [http://www.cuyahogavalley.net/thornburg.html] (8111 Rockside Rd), a mixed-use retail, restaurant and office complex sitting between the river and canal.

*'''[[North Coast Beaches]]'''. Along the southern shore of Lake Erie are a large number of public beaches.  The largest natural sand beach in Ohio, '''Headlands Beach State Park''' [http://www.dnr.state.oh.us/parks/parks/headlnds.htm], is located east of Cleveland, in Mentor. Cleveland Lakefront State Park [http://www.dnr.state.oh.us/parks/parks/clevelkf.htm] also includes a large beach at its '''Edgewater Park''', just west of downtown Cleveland. Many other beaches are available throughout Northeast Ohio, including Huntington Beach, Euclid Beach and Fairport Harbor.

* '''[[Lake Erie Islands]]'''.  Located west of Cleveland, a group of picturesque and festive islands in Lake Erie are accessible via ferry. In addition to several Ohio State Parks [http://www.dnr.state.oh.us/parks/parks/lakeerie.htm] located on the islands, there is plenty to do including wineries, restaurants, bars, marinas and beaches.

* '''Lake Erie Tour Route and Lighthouses'''. Go back to the mainland and see the shoreline.  The drive (or boat ride) around Lake Erie takes you through the Working Waterfronts around [[Buffalo (New York)|Buffalo]] NY, [[Cleveland]] OH, [[Detroit]] MI, [[Erie]] PA, [[Toledo (Ohio)|Toledo]], OH, and southern [[Ontario]] and is intermingled with beautiful preservations of flora and fauna as well as the history of North America's first westward expansion, the ''Old Northwest Territory''.

* '''Hall of Fame Cycle'''. Tourists can plan visits to the Rock Hall, Inventure Place [http://www.invent.org/] (the National Inventors Hall of Fame in [[Akron]]) and the Pro Football Hall of Fame[http://www.profootballhof.com/] (in [[Canton (Ohio)|Canton]]).

* '''Historic Downtown Painesville'''[http://www.downtownpainesville.org]. Visit quaint Painesville for specialty shops, ethnic restaurants, relaxing spas, college nightlife from nearby Lake Erie College [http://www.lec.edu/], historic homes, and bed and breakfasts.

*'''[[Sandusky]]'''. Sandusky is home to [[Cedar Point]], the world's largest amusement park, and Kalahari Resorts, a massive water park. Also home to Ghostly Manor, a top rated year-round haunted house, a Carousel Museum, and a historic downtown.
