'''Bristol''' [http://www.visitbristol.co.uk/] is the unofficial capital of the [[West Country]] of [[England]]. Famous for its maritime history it also offers a great and diverse range of attractions, hotels, bars and events. The best time to visit is in the summer when major festivals are held in the city. 

==Understand==
[[Image:Clifton_SB.jpg|thumb|Brunel's Clifton Suspension Bridge spans the Avon Gorge.]]
Bristol is the United Kingdom’s eighth most populous city (approximately 450,000) and the most populated city in South West England. It received a Royal Charter in 1155. From the 13th century, for half a millennium, it ranked amongst the top three English cities after [[London]], alongside York and Norwich. It borders the counties of Somerset and Gloucestershire and is also located near the historic cities of Bath to the southeast, Gloucester to the north and Cardiff, the capital city of Wales which lies to the northwest. The city is built around the River Avon, and has a short coastline on the estuary of the River Severn where it flows into the Bristol Channel.

Bristol is an excellent base for exploring the West Country, with relatively inexpensive accommodations compared to nearby Bath and a huge choice of bars, restaurants and shops. It's one of the most culturally vibrant cities in the South of England, hosting a wide variety of visual arts, theatre, speciality shopping and live music.

The alternative is to use one of the [[London]] airports or [[Birmingham (England)|Birmingham]] airport and travel on to Bristol by train, car or bus. The most convenient are:
*''' [http://www.baa.co.uk/main/airports/heathrow/ Heathrow Airport]''' is about two hours drive straight down the M4 (''westbound'') motorway. Alternatively the RailAir express bus service (running every 20 minutes) connects with the main [[London]] to Bristol rail service at [[Reading (England)|Reading]] rail station; expect the total journey to take slightly over two hours. National Express [http://nationalexpress.com] also operates an hourly direct coach service between Bristol and Heathrow.
*''' [http://www.bhx.co.uk/ Birmingham International]''' is within quicker (and cheaper) reach of Bristol than London's two other airports, Gatwick and Stansted.  By car it takes about 2 hours and you'll be avoiding the congestion-prone M25. Rail services connect Birmingham International to Bristol every 30 min at peak times with a change in Birmingham New Street. The journey takes between two and two and a half hours. 
*''' [http://www.baa.co.uk/main/airports/gatwick/ Gatwick Airport]''' is about three hours drive away via the M23 (''northbound''), M25 (''clockwise'') and M4 (''westbound'') motorways, and is also reachable by National Express coach service. Alternatively, take the train from Gatwick Airport railway station (located in the South Terminal), changing at Reading. 
*''' [http://www.baa.co.uk/main/airports/stansted/ Stansted Airport]''' is about three hours drive away via the M11 (''southbound''), M25 (''anti-clockwise'') and M4 (''westbound'') motorways. By train you will need to catch a Stansted Express train to London Liverpool Street station, the tube to London Paddington station, then follow the directions below; expect the total journey to take around three and a half hours.
*''' [http://www.cwlfly.com Cardiff International Airport]''' is about one hour west of Bristol, going  northbound from Culverhouse Cross, to J33 of the M4, then Eastbound, to Bristol. Alternatively take the train direct from Cardiff Airport, to Cardiff Central Station, then take another train to Bristol Temple Meads Station .

===By train=== 
'''Bristol Temple Meads''' station is located approximately 15 minutes walk from the city centre and has regular inter-city and regional train services from [[Bath (England)|Bath]], [[Birmingham (England)|Birmingham]], [[Cardiff]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Exeter]], [[Glasgow]], [[London]], [[Plymouth (England)|Plymouth]], [[Southampton]], [[Swansea]] and [[York]]. It is the oldest, continuously and still operating train station in the world.

Bristol has a second main railway station in '''Bristol Parkway''', which is located several miles north of the city centre. This station also has frequent services to many of the same locations as Temple Meads.

From London, you can travel from London Paddington station. There are several direct trains an hour and the journey only takes 1 hour 45 minutes. Train times (from any location) can be found on the  [http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/planmyjourney/ National Rail Planner] or by calling 08457 48-49-50 from anywhere in the UK.

===By bus=== 
[http://www.nationalexpress.com/ National Express]operate services to Marlborough St Coach station, located in the city centre, from cities throughout the UK including [[London]]. The journey from London to Bristol takes about 2h30min. Tickets are much cheaper if booked in advance online.

[http://www.megabus.com/ Megabus] also operate budget coach services from [[London]] and other UK destinations to a stop on Bond Street, Cabot Circus, near Haymarket. Tickets must be booked online and fares are demand responsive but can be very cheap (£1.50 if you book far enough in advance). The journey to London takes about 30 min longer than by National Express. Megabus have expanded in 2017 and now offer direct services to Heathrow and Gatwick Airports and Barnstaple amongst others.

[https://www.stagecoachbus.com/promos-and-offers/south-west/fly-the-south-west-falcon South West Falcon] is a 24 hour coach service linking Bristol with Bristol Airport, [[Taunton (England)| Taunton]], [[Exeter]] and [[Plymouth (England)| Plymouth]]. Pay the driver on the coach or it is possible to book through [http://www.megabus.com/ Megabus] See the website for stop locations.

===By car=== 
The M5 and M4 motorways intersect near Bristol and the M32, a motorway 'spur', brings traffic directly into the city centre. The M4 links [[London]] with Bristol with a driving time of less than two hours.

The city also has 3 Park and Ride facilities, A4 Portway, Long Ashton and A4 Bath Road sites, for more information see The Bristol City Council website [http://www.bristol.gov.uk/ccm/navigation/transport-and-streets/parking/park-and-ride/]

Parkopedia.com [http://en.parkopedia.com/parking/uk/bristol] is a free service that allows users to search and compare parking rates and locations for commercial and private parking facilities in Bristol [http://en.parkopedia.com/parking/uk/bristol].

==Get around==
[[Image:Bristol.png|thumb|400px|right|Map of Bristol]]
===Maps===
[http://www.visitbristol.co.uk Visit Bristol] the official tourism website for Bristol has free maps of the city [http://visitbristol.co.uk/site/visitor-information/maps]for visitors. Distinctive blue A3 tourist maps which cover the city centre, the Harbourside and Clifton, are available for free from the Tourist Information Centre on the harbourside and also from locations such as libraries, shops, Temple Meads railway station, hotels and the YHA hostel.

Detailed maps for districts within the city (such as Fishponds and Lockleaze), cycle, bus and a very detailed harbourside map are available from the [http://www.bristol.gov.uk/travelinfo City Council ].

===On Foot===
Most locations in central Bristol (the Harbourside and Old City areas) are reasonable easily walkable, and there are plenty of attractive walking routes along the quaysides and in the pedestrianised central streets. The main rail station (Bristol Temple Meads) is a little further (about 15 mins walk) but still accessible by harbourside walkways or by bus.  Bristol walking directions can be planned online with the walkit.com [http://www.walkit.com/bristol/] walking route planner.

===Bike===
Bristol has plenty of bike paths and routes and is at the centre of the National Cycle Network [http://www.sustrans.org.uk/default.asp?sID=1089735289781]. Sustrans, which manages the network, is based in the city, and has a shop and information centre on College Green, next to the Marriott Hotel. The staff can provide information on cycle routes throughout the UK. Free cycling maps for the Avon Cycleway, Bristol and surrounding council regions (South Gloucestershire, North Somerset, Bath and North-East Somerset) can be obtained by emailing, telephoning or writing to Bristol City Council's Transport Planning Team [http://www.bristol.gov.uk/ccm/navigation/transport-and-streets/cycling/cycle-lanes-and-routes/].
Do note the hilly terrain, which may be difficult for casual cyclists.

Bristol is also  host to lot's of mountain bike trails.
Some of the best include the 'yer tiz' at Leigh Woods and the 'nova trail' at Ashton Court Estate (both just over the Clifton Suspension Bridge). Belmont is also an option but harder than the previous trails mentioned.

===By train===
Bristol Temple Meads offers direct trains to many UK cities including London (Paddington). It is also one terminus of the Severn Beach Line which passes through Lawrence Hill and Stapleton Road in the East of the inner city; Montpelier, Redland and Clifton Down in the north before heading north-west to Severn Beach, although off-peak trains terminate at Avonmouth. The route is quite scenic - the line itself has been voted one of the most scenic in the world by Thomas Cook; the fares are cheap (a 7 day season ticket between Temple Meads and Clifton Down is £3.90 and an off-peak day return is £1.50), quick (Temple Meads to Clifton Down takes about 15 minutes) and usually punctual and reliable. The Severn Beach train usually runs approximately hourly from 0600 to 2200hrs, Monday to Saturday, with a reduced Sunday service from summer 2008, but check details using Transport Direct [http://www.rail.co.uk/] before travelling.

===By bus===
[http://www.bristolinsight.co.uk/ Bristol Insight] offer open top bus tours with commentary from February-December. The route takes in most of the major visitor destinations including the Clifton Suspension Bridge, Bristol Zoo, City Docks, Temple Meads, old city and city centre.[http://www.bristolvisitor.co.uk/]

Most bus services in Bristol are operated by [http://www.firstgroup.com/ukbus/southwest/bristol/home/ First Bristol]. Live departure times are shown on most bus stops. As most of Bristol's hotels and places to visit are located near the city centre or are in the upmarket suburb of Clifton, First Bristol's number 8 and 9 buses are probably the most useful for visitors. They follow a route from Temple Meads station to Clifton, passing through the main shopping area (Broadmead), the city centre (also handy for the harbourside) and the West End on the way. 

A FirstDay ticket (or 'Dayrider') can be purchased from the driver for £5.00, or cheaper for children or students with ID [https://www.firstgroup.com/bristol-bath-and-west/tickets/ticket-prices]. This ticket allows for unlimited travel on First buses within the city and most of the surrounding suburbs until 4:30AM the following day. 

Other operators include [http://wessexconnect.net/ Wessex Connect ] and [http://www.abus.co.uk/ Abus].

===Boat===
[[Image:Bagheera City Docks.jpg|thumb|Tourist boats at Bristol Harbour Festival, by Jeremy McNeill]]
Because of the way the city centre is intimately interwoven with the old 'floating harbour', a boat is a good way of getting around as well as seeing a lot of interesting sights. '''Bristol Ferry Boat [http://www.bristolferry.com/]''' runs several ferry services around the harbour, stopping at various quays on route, and even providing a commuter service between the city centre and the main rail station.

The '''Bristol Packet [http://www.bristolpacket.co.uk/]''' offer city docks tours with commentaries daily during school holidays and at weekends throughout the year. They also run regular excursions to riverside tea gardens on the Avon towards Bath and Avon Gorge cruises under the Clifton Suspension Bridge to Avonmouth and back.

'''Number Seven Boat Trips [http://www.numbersevenboattrips.co.uk/]''' also offer a ferry service during the summer months.

Bristol City Council offers a useful walking and public transport journey planner at  [http://www.travelbristol.org/]. Bristol is quite a hilly city, but if you don't mind walking up hills the walk can be pleasant on a fine day.

===By car===
Driving is probably the easiest way of seeing the surrounding region. Traffic can be an issue however, so public transport, cycle or on foot is best where possible.

====Parking====
There are plenty of multi-storey and council or privately run car parks throughout the city. There is on-street parking throughout, but it can get busy, and a number of residents parking schemes run throughout the city.

====Park and Ride====
There are three Park and Ride schemes operating in Bristol. The main park and rides are at Brislington, on the A4 Bath Road. Another is in Shirehampton and a third is at the end of the A370 Long Ashton Bypass. These are recommended due to their cheaper fares and ease of access to the busy city centre.
For more information, see the [http://www.bristol.gov.uk/ccm/navigation/transport-and-streets/parking/park-and-ride Bristol City Council website ]

===Taxi===
Taxis can be an expensive way to get around the city. There are about 700 licensed taxis (Hackney Carriages) and these can be distinguished by roof signs and meters charged at a rate set by the council.  There are a similar number of private hire vehicles (without roof signs) that need to be pre-booked. All legitimate taxis and private hire vehicles should have a predominantly yellow council-issued plate at the front and back of the vehicle. More information on taxis and private hire vehicles and a cab rank map can be found at Taxis and Minicabs in Bristol [https://www.bristol.gov.uk/streets-travel/taxis]. Uber also runs in Bristol, but these drivers are not required to be licensed.

===The Bristol to Bath Railway cycle path===
This showcase cycle path runs on a disused railway line from central Bristol to [[Bath]]. With its traffic free tarmac, gentle gradients, and only two minor road crossings on its 22km stretch, it is ideal for cycling. At a leisurely pace the journey to Bath takes a good 2h through green suburbs and some attractive countryside. If you are too tired to cycle back, you can take your bicycle free of charge on one of the frequent trains from Bath Spa to Bristol Temple Meads station. The journey takes 10-15 min.

From Bath, you can continue cycling along the towpath of the Kennet and Avon Canal all the way to [[Bradford on Avon]], taking another hour or so. Though not paved and somewhat narrower than the Bristol to Bath cycle path, the towpath is still traffic free and the scenery even more beautiful. There are two or three places to stop and eat or drink on the way. The aqueduct at Avoncliff is worth seeing. From Bradford too there are direct trains back to Bristol that carry bicycles. [http://www.bristol.gov.uk/ccm/content/Transport-Streets/Walking-Cycling/file-storage-items/bristol-and-bath-railway-path-map.en You can view a PDF map at Bristol and Bath Railway Path ].

* '''Broadmead & Cabot Circus''' are the two major precincts within the city's central shopping district. The newer of the two is Cabot Circus[http://www.cabotcircus.com/] which opened in September 2008. The name was chosen by public vote after it was decided that the name 'Merchants Quarter' brought with it too many connotations to Bristol's slave trade past. It is a large, and mostly under-cover shopping centre, containing over 120 shops including House of Fraser, Harvey Nichols, 'Apple', Hollister, Boss, Ted Baker, Fred Perry as well as a Cinema Du Lux. 
[[Image:CAbbot_circus.jpg|thumb|Cabots Circus Shopping]]

Bristol also has quite vibrant district shopping centres. The best of these are probably:

* North St and East St, in Bedminster in the south of the city. A wide range of independent shops, also supermarkets, greengrocers, butchers, bars, cafes, delicatessens, charity shops.

* Gloucester Rd/Cheltenham Rd in the North, which contains a large number of cafes and restaurants, a number of instrument shops, many hardware stores and a good selection of independent butchers, bakers and greengrocers. At night, the restaurants and pubs attract lively nightlife.

==Eat== 
Bristol has a huge choice of bars and restaurants to suit all tastes and budgets. There are many around the Harbourside and The West End's Park Street and Whiteladies Road, but do not be dissuaded from trying those outside the centre as many are superior to those that attract passing trade due to their location. After a night out, or if your hotel allows food delivery, you will also be able to find many '''takeaways in Bristol''' , with different variaties of food.

===Budget===

==Drink== 
The fact that it's the home to around 44,000 students probably says a lot for the quality of the city's nightlife. The eastern end of King Street in the old city provides a slightly more relaxed, but popular, outdoor drinking area on sunny summer evenings, surrounded by historic pubs such as the 17th-century Llandoger Trow (reputed to have been the haunt of pirates and the model for the Admiral Benbow in Robert Louis Stevenson's novel "Treasure Island").
The South West is famed for its cider and scrumpy and you will easily find pubs and bars in Bristol offering a host of different varieties. But if you are an ale or beer fanatic then you will not be disappointed either; Bristol’s craft beer scene is fermenting as well as the award-winning ale it produces.

Imagine spending a warm sunny afternoon (no, it doesn’t rain all the time) on the roof of a barge in the harbour, or sipping a glass of bubbly looking out to Brunel’s iconic suspension bridge. Or perhaps you prefer to snuggle up in the warmth of the fire in winter at a traditional country pub. You can when you visit Bristol.

If you’re looking for something a little sassier, Bristol’s creative and unconventional style influences the speakeasies and cocktail bars around the city. Don’t be afraid to dig a little deeper into Bristol nightlife; look for a red light, knock on the door to be let in or chase the white rabbit to really experience what Bristol has to offer after the sun goes down.

Amongst the hundreds of brilliant venues in the city, there are four outstanding areas:

* '''St Nicholas' Market''', including Baldwin Street: on and around Corn Street, you'll find several chain bars, including Wetherspoons' the Commercial Rooms on Corn Street which was once a meeting place for Merchant Ventures. Other reliable venues include the Slug & Lettuce and Vodka Revolution on St Nicholas Street, All Bar One and Walkabout on Corn Street and O'Neill's and Reflex on Baldwin Street. 

* '''Harbourside area''': the regenerated waterside is a great place to drink, especially on summer afternoons. On Welsh Back, there's the famous Old Duke jazz pub and, opposite it, the famous Lladngoer Trow - plus, the Apple, a floating cider bar. Bristol's famous bar on a boat, the Thekla, is around the corner, and there are plenty of big chain and independent bars on Canon Road. Millennium Square has lots of chain restaurants and bars centered on the impressive mirrored 'Imaginarium' and fountains. The Waterfront by the hippodrome can be rowdy of a weekend and is best avoided.

* '''Park Street''', '''Park Row''', '''Clifton Triangle''' and '''Whiteladies Road''': Whiteladies Road runs from the Downs on top of Blackboy Hill, past Clifton on one side and Cotham and Redland on the other; at the Triangle, traffic runs around the eponymous island of shops and bars before pushing down Park Street to the center of Bristol. There are hundreds of bars and clubs along this busy thoroughfare.

* '''Stokes Croft''' and '''Gloucester Road''': the anarchic area of Stokes Croft is home to Bristol's big independent clubs, Blue Mountain, Lakota and Clockwork; after these monoliths, there are live music venues, pubs and bars to please the alternative crowd. Highlights include the Pipe and Slippers, the Crofters Rights, the Bell, the Flyer and the Prince of Wales. 

If you're a tourist in Bristol, you may enjoy visiting one of the city's pubs and bars with historic and literary connections.
[[Image:Bristol.jpg|thumb|The Llandoger Trow]]
* '''The Llandoger Trow''' on King Street is supposedly the meeting place of Daniel Defoe and 'Robinson Crusoe', Alexander Selkirk. It is also rumoured to be Robert Louis' Stevenson's inspiration for the Admiral Benbow pub in his work, Treasure Island. The pub is a 17th-century Grade II listed building. 

* Abolitionist the Reverend Thomas Clarkson stayed in the '''Seven Stars''' in Redcliffe while he researched the British slave trade in 1787.

* Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey used to meet in the '''Rummer Tavern''' to talk about emigrating. An earlier pub on the same premises, known as the Greene Lattis, was the first pub in Bristol to get a license, back in 1241.

* Actor Cary Grant often stayed in the '''Avon Gorge Hotel''', which has a terrace bar opening out onto Clifton's best view of Brunel's suspension bridge.
 
* Pioneers of the Bristol sound, Massive Attack, established '''the Tube''', a bar/club at the foot of Park Street.

==Stay safe==
By using the same precautions as you would at home, Bristol can be a very safe city to navigate. Crime in the South West is lower than in the rest of the UK. 

* Stick to well lit, busy areas
* Don't take unnecessary valuables with you - leave your passport in the hotel safe, and if you must bring them, keep them out of sight in a zipped pocket
* Check your route before you leave
* Only use official taxi services - they'll have an ID badge. [https://www.bristol.gov.uk/streets-travel/taxis Find out more about taxi travel] 
* Be careful around the water. Bristol is on a river, and as such there are many unfenced areas where shops, bars and restaurants run next to the water. 

* If you have an emergency, call the police on 999. To report a crime which is not an emergency, call 101.

==Stay healthy==
* '''NHS Direct [http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/]'''  run a 24 hour helpline if you need emergency medical help but it's not life-threatening. The NHS 111 service is staffed by a team of fully trained advisers, supported by experienced nurses and paramedics. They will ask you questions to assess your symptoms, then give you the healthcare advice you need or direct you  to the local service that can help you best. 
* '''Bristol Royal Infirmary [http://www.ubht.nhs.uk/ed/Maps/Maps.htm]''' has an Emergency Department.
* '''Southmead Hospital [http://www.nhs.uk/england/hospitals/showhospital.aspx?id=RVJ01]''' has an Emergency Department. Minor Injury Unit available, only open limited hours.
* '''Frenchay Hospital [http://www.nhs.uk/England/Hospitals/showHospital.aspx?id=RVJ20]''' has an Emergency Department.

==Contact==
