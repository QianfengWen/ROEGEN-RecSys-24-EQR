'''Konya''' is a city in [[Central Anatolia]] in [[Turkey]], known as the city of ''whirling dervishes'' and for its outstanding ''Seljuk'' architecture.

==Understand==
[[Image:MevlanaMuseum.jpg|thumb|350px|Mevlana Museum - Mausoleum of Rumi]]
Konya was once the capital of '''Sultanate of Rum''', known in Turkish as ''Anadolu Selçukluları'', a situation which resulted in much of the architectural heritage visible today. The Persian poet and Sufi thinker "Mevlana" or '''Rumi''' also settled in the city during this period.

Despite rapid growth in recent years, and the arrival of many students from out of town in the Selçuk University (Selçuk Üniversitesi), founded in 1975, Konya still retains the air of an Anatolian provincial town. Even though the influx of tourists from the west has increased considerably visitors are still left in peace, and do not have to suffer the hassles they get in Istanbul. On the downside perhaps is the fact that fewer people speak English (or any other foreign language), but the natural hospitality of the people of Konya usually makes up for that. Be careful with taxi drivers, who sometimes have no scruples about ripping off visitors to their city. 

Konya is also one of the most conservative cities in Turkey with more women covering their heads with headscarves (though visitors will notice that the number of women covering is perhaps slightly above 50%). Dress modestly if you want to fit in with the local population, although not many people will bat an eye lid if you choose not to.

The city lies on a totally flat ground, with the sole exception of a small hill called ''Alaattin Tepesi'' in the very centre of the city—which is actually a man-made hill, erected during the Seljuk period so noble residents could easily watch the city below from their palace. Almost nothing remained of the palace and the hill now serves as the central park, which is a quite pleasant and shady one.

==Get in==

===By plane===
Turkish Airlines [http://www.turkishairlines.com/] and Pegasus Airlines [http://www.flypgs.com/] offer flights from [[Istanbul]] to '''Konya Airport''' (IATA: '''KYA''', ICAO: '''LTAN'''), located about 18 km out of city. In the summer period it's also possible to fly from various [[Europe]]an countries, such as [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]], [[Norway]], [[Denmark]]. The easiest and cheapest way to get to the city centre from the airport is to take the shuttle buses provided by ''Havaş'', which takes around 30 minutes and costs 10 TL pp [http://www.havas.net/en/].

===By train===
[[Image:KonyaTrainStation.jpg|thumb|Old train in front of train station]]

Konya is the southern terminus of Turkey’s high speed railway system (YHT), with regular fast trains to [[Istanbul]], [[Eskişehir]] and [[Ankara]]. The trains from Istanbul currently leave from Pendik some 25 km east of city centre: take the metro to Kartal then bus 251 or taxi the last 5 km to Pendik and allow 2 hours. There are two trains per day from Pendik to Konya, stopping at Eskişehir, and taking 4½ hours.

To Ankara there are 7 trains per day, taking 90 minutes. (Although Ankara railway station is partially closed for rebuilding, this is not expected to affect the YHT service to Konya.) 

For [[Adana]], there is a replacement bus service to Karaman while the track is upgraded, then a daily train (4½ hours) on to Adana. There are also connecting buses to [[Antalya]]. 

An overnight sleeper takes 12 hours to Izmir (shown on Turkish timetables as Alsancak).

The railway station is 3 km SW of town centre: take taxi, dolmus, or town bus # 67 to the centre.

===By Bus or Tram===

There are a number of travel agencies on Mevlana Caddesi, Konya's main street, where you can buy bus tickets. The destinations they deal with are written outside of each agency.

Konya's bus station (''otogar'') has good connections to a wide range of destinations, including [[Istanbul]] (~10 hours, 65-75 TL.), [[Izmir]] (~9 hours, 38 TL.), [[Ankara]] (3.15 hours, 28TL), and [[Cappadocia]] (~3 hours).

When you are issued a bus ticket you will be told which gate at the station your bus will leave from; you need to be vigilant, however, as the buses sometimes park at another gate close by.

The bus station is several kilometres (7km) away from Konya's main sites of interest, most of which are located around Alaaddin Tepesi in the city centre. A number of minibuses (''dolmuş'') depart from outside the bus station, some of which stop in or near Alaaddin Tepesi: these take about 30 minutes and should cost 2 YTL. Alternatively, Konya's tram line&mdash;which conveniently has a stop at ''otogar''&mdash;terminates in a loop around Alaaddin Tepesi: this also takes about 30 minutes and costs 2 YTL per person. A plastic fare card must be purchased before using city buses or trams. These are rechargeable and can be used according to the amount deposited.

Check [https://www.neredennereye.com/] for timetables.

===By car===

Konya is a 3-hour drive from [[Ankara]] and 10 hours (660km) from [[Istanbul]]. From [[Izmir]] you will reach Konya in 7 hours. Also it takes 4 and half hours from [[Antalya]] by car.

==Getting around==
 
In the city of Konya you can travel with the ''dolmuş'' minibuses, public urban buses (''belediye otobüsü''), tram or taxi. Most sites of interest, though, with the notable exception of the suburb of Meram, are clustered in the city centre and are within walking distance of each other. Via tram, though, from Alaadin (the heart of the old city), you can ride all the way to Selçuk University on the outskirts or the city and pass a few sites of interest (Japon Parki being one of them). The tram network ''tramvay'' has close to 25 stops. From Alaadin to the end of the line at Selçuk University, it takes about an hour.

The plastic card is called "Konya Elkart" and costs 1.5 TL and you will probably want to charge it at the same time you buy it.

* <see name="Mevlana Museum/Mausoleum of Rumi" alt="Mevlana Müzesi" directions="Once downtown around Mevlana Cad., just follow the signs toward Mevlana Muzesi" url="http://www.kultur.gov.tr/genel/SanalMuzeler/mevlana-tr/index.html" long="32.4817700" lat="37.8775900" price="3 TL" hours="9am-5pm">This must-see tourist destination of Konya is the tomb of the famous mystic/sufi/thinker Rumi (also known as as ''Mevlana'' in Turkish, or with the full name Mawlana Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Balkhi-Rumi in English literature), as well as the neighbouring museum that displays relics of his life and his time. The items on display in the museum range from old manuscripts, hand written copies of the Koran to some of Rumi's belongings. Also on display are musical instruments used in his time, as well as numerous art works dating from the Seljuk era. Don't bother taking the audioguide as it's very boring. </see> 

:Also of interest to the curious traveller, especially for those looking for scenic photographic opportunities or a short walk through an authentic neighborhood, are the parts of the city that surround the Mevlana Museum. Since this neighborhood hasn't quite kept up with recent times, it still maintains an authentic feel from older days with narrow streets and houses of old architecture, almost with historic significance.

*'''Sille ''' ,8 km northwest from Konya center. Nearly 7.000 years old village on the historic Kings Road, Silk Road and Pilgrims Road to Jerusalem. Several restorated mosques, the Hagia Heleni Church, Milk Church, 7 cave churches, catacombs, ancient rock dwellings, a roman water bridge, cultural museums and traditional houses to see. İnteresting for cultural and religious tourism. Restaurants, cafes, shisha cafes, the sille lake and much more. The location is perfect for wandering around, trekking the landscape and Konya is a short drive by car or by bus. For accommodation there is a boutique hotel at the cay mosque, a beautifully and profesional restored old turkish manison in the center of the village.  Sillehan = a must see in Konya. 


:Located 5-6 city blocks away from the Mevlana museum, one can also find other historic buildings and mosques dating from the 12th and 13th century Seljuks Turks (the most significant one of these is the "İplikçi Camii").

* <see name="Iplikçi Mosque" alt="İplikçi Camii" address="" directions="" phone="" url="" hours="" price="Free" lat="" long="" email="" fax="">This old mosque dating from the 13th century was restored about 50 years ago and is still open for prayer service. It is a nice example of the Seljuk architecture to be seen in Konya, conveniently located between the city centre and the Mevlana Museum.</see>

* <see name="Ince Minare Museum" alt="İnce Minare, literally 'thin minaret'" address="Alaaddin Meydanı" directions="" phone="+90 332 351 32 04 " email="" fax="" url="http://www.kulturturizm.gov.tr/TR/BelgeGoster.aspx?F6E10F8892433CFF1AD8E71A9A9C29259950F655C4E43B74" hours="Tu-Su 8:30am 12:30pm/1:30pm-5:30pm" price="">İnce Minare is the remains of a 13th century ''madrasah'' (school) built by the Anatolian Seljuks. Located close to the city centre near the northern end of "Alaaddin Tepesi", this minaret and the surrounding small buildings today serve as a museum that displays various artifacts from the Seljuk and Ottoman eras. It is a popular tourist attraction, owing mostly to the noteworthy ornamental architecture which has been very well preserved over the centuries.</see>

* <see name="Alaaddin Hill" alt="Alaaddin Tepesi" address="" directions="" phone="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">This is an artificial hill that was built by the Seljuk Sultan Alaaddin Keykubat. Today it stands right in the middle of the city, and serves mostly as a park. Even though the small hill or the park on it may not be very interesting in themselves, the two places to see are 1) the '''Alaaddin Mosque''', and 2) the remnants of the old palace with partly earthen construction located on the north end of the hill - this old structure is protected from the elements with a concrete umbrella.</see>

* <see name="Meram" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">Meram is the district of Konya which lies somewhat away from the city centre, with lighter construction, elegant villas and more greenery. The name "Meram" also refers to the popular picnic area located in the far corner of the Meram district. Near this picnic area there are a few historic buildings to see, some of which are the "Tavus Baba Türbesi" and the "Ateşbazı Türbesi".</see>

[[Image:KonyaSelcukPalace.jpg|thumb|Seljuk Palace remains]]

* <see name="Seljuk Palace remains" alt="" address="" directions="on the Alaaddin Tepesi Hill" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="" email="" fax="">Just one small part of the Seljuk Alaaddin palace remains. Built by Seljuk Sultan Kilicarslan II, restored by Seljuk Sultan Alaaddin Kekubad. Restauration is in progress (May 2016).</see>

*<see name="Japon Parki" alt="" address="Su Deposu Tram Station" directions="" phone="" url="http://www.jkm.org.tr/index.php/tr/haberler/japon-bahcesi.html" hours="" price="" lat="" long="">A friendship park built in a joint cooperation between the municipalities of Kyoto, Japan, and Konya. Though the style *leans* towards Japanese, it's really more of a pan-Asian design. It covers several acres, comes complete with pagodas, ponds, small waterfalls, etc. It's a favourite for wedding day pictures. There's a great restaurant there (which supposedly funds the upkeep of the park) selling, of all things, everything from chicken and beef fajitas to traditional Turkish food.</see>

*'''Saint Paul Catholic Church''' Alaadin Tepesi, between the Alaadin and Zaafer tram stations. It can be seen from the street. The lone operating church left in Konya. Built in the 1910's by the Italian railroad workers and currently cared for by two happy Italian nuns, the church mainly serves the spiritual needs of tour groups and a handful of Christian expatriates. Mass most Sundays between 10:00am and 12:30pm. Between May and September, there are services most days due to pilgrim groups visiting nearly every day. Call for information: 03323536226 (Turkish mobile). Between the two nuns, they can communicate in Italian, French, German, English, and Turkish, but to varying degrees. If you don't have a chance to call, just show up and ring the bell; one of the nuns is usually there to open the gate. Due to the locals' paranoia about the nuns being missionaries, they only allow Turks to visit from Wednesdays and Fridays 2:30pm-3:30pm when services aren't being held.

==Do==

* '''Kule Site''' shopping center. 
* '''Kent Plaza''' shopping center. You can also shop in the small streets of Konya where you can find a lot of clothes and presents for a low price.
* '''Alaattin Tepesi''' Go chill there.
* Have a cup of coffee at Meram (Aydincavus), with a sight of Konya from above.
* '''Fuar''' (the funfair).
* Visit Kapu Mosque and Aziziye Mosque, each with different styles of minarets (towers).
* <do name="Take a walk at Zafer Street" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="" email="" fax=""></do>
* <do name="Sema (Whirling dervish ceremony)" alt="" address="Mevlana Cultural Centre" directions="around 20 minutes' walk from the Mevlana Museum, down the same road, away from the centre. The building is on the right side — a big, modern white building with a pyramid roof" phone="" url="" hours="" price="15TRY for adults, 10 for students" lat="" long="">Highly recommended! A ''sema'' (whirling dervish ceremony) is held at the Mevlana Cultural Centre every Saturday at 7pm (current as of Dec 2019) taking one and a half hours. You don't need to arrange tickets in advance, but you might want to ask at the Tourist Information Center right behind the Mevlana Museum in case there have been changes. The hall is very big so there will almost certainly be free seats, doors open at 6:30 if you’d like to get right up the front. The ceremony begins with a long introduction in Turkish before the actual music and ceremony start. People say this is the closest you can get to a real ''sema''. No flash photography or applauding during the ceremony (so as not to disturb the dervishes).</do>

* '''Study Turkish''' Two of the five universities in Konya have Tömer (Ankara University approved Turkish language programs for non-Turkish speakers) programs. 
1) ''Necmettin Erbakan Üniversitesi'' at the Karatay Kampusu. Coming from Alaaddin, get off at the Kule tram station and take a right. Walk for several hundred meters until you reach the next main road and then take a left. Keep going for two to three hundred meters until you see the statue of the six dervishes at the roundabout - the university is there. Otherwise, call 03322362144. Make sure you call after 1:30pm and listen to the recording before an employee (who doesn't speak English) picks up. Keep saying "Tömer" until they transfer you to a Turkish teacher who usually speaks broken English. Turkish is offered for $300US paid in Turkish lira per level (A1.1, A1.2, A2.1, A2.2, B1.1, B1.2, B2.1, B2.2, C1.1, C1.2). Each level is 70+ hours of classroom time spread out over up to six weeks. Classes are offered in the mornings and evenings and start when there are 10 students enrolled. Passport holders of Arab and Turkic nations are given a 30% discount.    

2) ''Mevlana Üniversitesi'' On the edge of town in Bosna Hersek, easily accessible by tram. Significantly more expensive than Necmettin Erbakan, only offers full time classes in the mornings. Cohorts form at the beginning of the school year, though with every 15 students, new classes will open up. http://www.mevlana.edu.tr/

*'''Work'''

Pretty much all the work available to foreigners in Konya is relegated to teaching English or subject teaching at a university in English. If you have some credentials (i.e. a BA and a CELTA/TEFL cert or a BA and some experience), you can easily land a job in a university making some hefty coin by local standards that allows you to live high on the hog. 

There are five universities in Konya:

1) Mevlana Üniversitesi: private university located on the outskirts of the town. 2,000+ students. About a kilometer from Selçuk Üniversitesi.
http://www.mevlana.edu.tr/

2) KTO Karatay Üniversitesi: http://www.karatay.edu.tr/
Located in the downtown, focuses on industry and business. 

3) Selçuk Üniversitesi http://www.selcuk.edu.tr/English/DefaultEng.aspx
This is the largest university in Turkey with about 80,000 students. It's main campus is on the edge of town, a kilometer far from Mevlana Üniversitesi
 
4) Necmettin Erbakan Üniversitesi:
http://www.konya.edu.tr/
Government university that was part of Selcuk University in 2011. They have at least two campuses downtown. They offer Turkish lessons to foreigners.

==Eat==
Traditional local cuisine mainly depends on wheat/bread and mutton - the major agricultural products of Central Anatolian steppe on which Konya is situated.

Local delicacies include:

* ''Etliekmek'' &mdash; a kind of long and thin pizza (with meat or cheese) which can possibly exceed 1 meter in length! Available at a lot of restaurants in Konya.

* '''Havzun Restaurant''' Coming from Alaaddin, get off at the Kule tram stop and take a right. Walk for about 100-150 meters and it's on the left. Famous throughout Konya as the best Etliekmek. Two pieces of Etliekmek (each about 1.5m long) for 14TL. High quality food. 

* '''Can Baba''' Coming from Alaadin, get off at the Nalçacı tram station and cross the street. All the locals know it, famous through Konya as the best place to get Iskender kebab. Two plates of Iskender, fresh künefe, soft drinks, and mezzeh for 30TL.

==Drink==

[[Image:KonyaCenterPark.jpg|thumb|Central park at Alaaddin Tepesi]]

* The open-air café at Alaaddin Tepesi is good for relief and some shade while watching the city during a summer day.
* Mevlevi sofrası is one of the best places which has a panoramic view of Mevlana museum and Gulbahcesi. You can have a drink with traditional desserts.
*Hotels: pretty much all of them have alcohol. If you're really desperate, though, head to Migros. There's one near the Bosna Hersek tramvay station. Simply cross the pedestrian bridge across from Mevlana University and you'll see it (Bosna Hersek Mah. Mesaj Cd 38/A-B, Bosna). At this particular one, the alcohol section is so busy that they've had to hire a full time guard simply to watch that one section of the store - no joke. There's another Migros in Meram, also fully stocked with booze (Şeyh Sadrettin Mah. Ferit Paşa Cd 12/A, Meram Merkez). There are also fully stocked liquor stores located throughout the city - one of the more easily reachable is in the alley off the main road between the Alaaddin and Zafer tram stations. A second one is off of the Kule tram station. Coming from the city center, get off at Kule tram station and take a right. Walk a few hundred meters until the next main road. Take a left there and you'll see it on your left after a couple hundred meters. A third option is to just look for signs saying "Efes" while in the downtown. Contrary to what most people think, most Konyan men are fairly familiar with the bottle and a significant amount of women regularly imbibe, but doing so in public is illegal and announcing it isn't a good idea as a fairly large amount of Konyans like to appear conservative. Like most parts of Turkey and the Arab world, do what you like, but don't broadcast it to the world.

==Sleep==

If you are an unmarried couple you may find it fairly difficult to book a double room if you don't have a marriage certificate.  Mevlana Sema Hotel right opposite the Mevlana Muzesi doesn't require a marriage certificate.

==Stay safe==

==Get out==
* '''Çatalhöyük''' is a prehistoric archeological site located about an hour's drive away from Konya. Its importance lies in the fact of being one of the earliest and well preserved human settlement sites discovered. At 12.00 there ıs a bus every day from Konya, which passes Çatalhöyük (5 TL), on your way back hitchhike to Çumran (ıf you walk alone on the street, most drivers wıll ask you, if they can take your for free to Çumran) and then take a bus (5 TL) or ask a museum guard for bus services from the next small village.  In 2012, this site was declared a World Heritage site by Unesco.

* '''Tuz Gölü''' (literally Salt Lake), about an hour away on the road north to [[Ankara]], is Turkey's second largest lake after [[Van|Lake Van]], although only about 2 (yes, two) meters deep at most. During summer months, it literally evaporates and leaves behind a flat and completely white landscape, just like a salt desert. It's also a good spot for '''birdwatching''' as it's an important stop-over for migratory birds on their route from Europe to Africa and vice versa during spring and autumn.

*'''[[Cappadocia]]''', about three hours to east, is the most logical next stop on your itinerary around Central Anatolia.

*'''[[Silifke]]''', about 250 km to south, can be a good point of entry into the [[Mediterranean Turkey]] from Konya, as the town is located at about the midway of two extremes of Turkish Mediterranean coast.

===Hitchhiking===

*If you intend to '''head south by hitchhiking''', take public bus #26 '''heading east on Mevlana'''(''Karaman Yolu'', fare: YTL 1.10/person) from the stops in front of the Governor’s Office (''Valilik''/''Vilayet'') in the city centre,  about 5-10 minutes walk away from Rumi tomb/Mevlana Museum (leaving at 6:00, 6:30, 7:10, 7:30, 7:50, 8:30, 9:45, 11:00, etc., the bus stop has a posted schedule if you plan to leave later). #26 takes you to the highway leading to south. You can stay on until it arrives at the steppes out of city, almost until the middle of nowhere. Don’t get off the bus until it leaves the highway by turning left into a narrower road.  If you plan to head toward [[Antalya]], sit on the right side of the bus and get off when you see the large sign indicating the junction of highways D330, D715, and D696, about 15 min or so from the center. Go to the D696 on- ramp to hitch to Antalya, a short walk from the intersection.
