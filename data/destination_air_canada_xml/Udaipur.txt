In 1568, the Mughal emperor Akbar captured [[Chittorgarh]], and Udai Singh was forced to flee and establish the city of Udaipur. Udaipur remained the capital of the state of Mewar, which became a princely state of British India in 1818. After India's independence in 1947, Mewar was integrated into the state of Rajasthan. 

People in Udaipur usually prefer wearing bright-colored clothes. Colorful festivals and fairs depict the cultural prosperity of Udaipur.

The climate of Udaipur is tropical, with the mercury staying between a maximum of 42.3°C and a minimum of 28.8°C during summers. Winters are mild with the maximum temperature rising to 28.8°C and the minimum dipping to 2.5°C. The best time to visit is from September to March. 

==Get in==

===By plane===
Dabok Airport, also known as Maharana Pratap Airport after the son of Udai Singh, is 25km northeast of the city center. There are daily flights from [[Delhi]] and [[Mumbai]] on [http://www.airindia.in/ Air India], [http://www.goindigo.in/ IndiGo] and [http://www.spicejet.com/ SpiceJet]. 

Taxis between the airport and the city cost ₹500-750 from the prepaid taxi booth in the airport. Many hotels offer a prearranged pickup for ₹600-800. There are no public buses between the airport and the city. Uber or the Indian ride-sharing mobile app "Ola" will go between the airport and city center for ₹300-350. Depending on your location within the narrow and crowded streets of the city center, the taxi driver may insist on passing you off to a Tuk Tuk once in the city center. Depending on haggling abilities the tuk-tuk may cost another ₹50-100.

===By train===
Udaipur has direct train connections to many major cities in India including [[Chittorgarh]] (6-7 per day, 2 hours. ₹140), [[Ahmedabad]] (daily, 10 hours, ₹200), [[Ajmer]] (4 per day, 5 hours. ₹135-680), [[Sawai Madhopur]] (daily, 7 hours, ₹270-1,625), [[Jaipur]] (3 per day, 7 hours, ₹170-855), [[Agra]] (daily, 13 hours, ₹360-2,355), [[Delhi]] (2 per day, 12 hours. ₹390-1,440), [[Mumbai]] (every other day, 17 hours, ₹475-1,785), and [[Khajuraho]] (daily, 21 hours, ₹485-3,245).

===By bus===
Udaipur is connected by an efficient bus service to most cities in [[Rajasthan]], which can sometimes be much faster than the train. Buses operate between Udaipur and [[Mount Abu]] (5 hours, ₹165), [[Agra]] (6 hours, ₹120), [[Ahmedabad]] (6 hours, ₹200), [[Jodhpur]] (8 hours, ₹125), [[Ajmer]] (8 hours, ₹150), [[Jaipur]] (9 hours, ₹200), [[Bikaner]], [[Delhi]] (14 hours, ₹420), and [[Mumbai]] (16 hours, sleeper ₹600 or seat ₹400).

===By car===
Udaipur is easily accessible via major roads from every major destination in India including [[Chittorgarh]] (117km), [[Ahmedabad]] (257km), [[Jodhpur]] (260km), [[Ajmer]] (307km), [[Sawai Madhopur]]/[[Ranthambore]] (638km),  [[Jaipur]] (421km), [[Bikaner]] (488km),  [[Agra]] (638km), [[Delhi]] (676km), [[Mumbai]] (725km), and [[Khajuraho]] (776km).

==Get around==

While most of the city can be covered on foot and the narrow alleyways in the old city make any other form of transportation a hassle, a taxi or autorickshaw/tuk-tuk is necessary to reach the Monsoon Palace or the wilderness park. A tuk-tuk will usually cost around ₹50, and should never cost more than ₹100 within the city. If you have a SIM card, Uber or Ola is the way to go. Uber is consistently cheaper than a tuk-tuk and will almost always be a much more pleasant ride.

The elaborate design of this chamber consists of three peacocks (representing the three seasons of summer, winter, and monsoon) modeled in high relief and faced with colored glass mosaic, built into successive niches in the wall area or jharoka. These were built during Maharana Sajjan Singh’s reign, 200 years after the palace was established. The peacocks have been crafted with 5,000 pieces of glass that shine in green, gold, and blue. In an adjoining chamber, called the Kanch-ki-Burj, a mosaic of mirrors adorns the walls. The Badi Charur Chowk within this chowk is a smaller court for private use. Its screen wall has painted and inlaid compositions depicting European men and Indian women.

==Eat==
Udaipur is famous for its spicy snacks such as ''mirchi bada'' and ''kachori''. Other common local cuisines include ''Dal Baati Churma'' (Lentils and rice), ''Pyaz Kachori'' (onion/flour balls), and ''Gatte Ki Sabzi'' (gram flour dumplings with curry). These are common on the menu of just about every restaurant and should definitely be eaten!

Cooking classes are also commonly offered in Udaipur.

There are a couple of Thali restaurants where you can get unlimited servings of a selection of Rajasthani and Gujarati dishes (rotis, savoury bites, daals, vegetables, rice, sweets, and more). There are also American fast-food restaurants such as McDonald's and Subway in the Celebration Mall. Outside of the old town, you can find street stalls selling cheap chaat (Indian fast food).

There are many rooftop restaurants with romantic views of Lake Pichola. However, in all cases, you will usually have to walk up several flights of stairs to get to them.

==Stay Safe==
While Udaipur is generally safe for tourists, it is important to be aware of common scams which can be prevalent in the Old City. Be cautious of touts who begin friendly conversations and soon inform you of the upcoming Royal Wedding at the City Palace. Be assured - there is no such event, nor will it be attended by various celebrities from your home country. Their aim is to bring you to a tailor's shop sell you an overpriced outfit for the evening. Touts can be persistent and may follow you around, particularly around the Jagdish Temple and Gangaur Ghat. Hotel proprietors insist they are not dangerous, and there is no harm in engaging with them in friendly conversation, but also recommend you not reveal too many personal details or information about your plans/hotel, and to simply get into a tuk-tuk at any point if you feel uncomfortable.

==Get out==
[[Image:Saas_Bahu_Temple.jpg|right|thumb|Saas Bahu Temple at Nagda]]
*'''Ubeshwar'''. A nice, green, and wonderful place to visit. Bring some food along, as very few options are available.
*'''[[Delwara]]''' - About 30km north of Udaipur is this small town that boasts a rich history.  It provides a look at traditional village culture, beautiful Jain temples, and a chance to experience village India on its own terms.
* '''Eklingji Temple''' - 22km north of Udaipur in Eklingi Village is one of the most famous temple complexes of Rajasthan. The magnificent architecture of Eklingnath Temple is simply remarkable. However, no photography is permitted inside.
* '''Haldighati''' - An important historical site in the context of Rajasthan at a comfortable distance of 40km from the city of Udaipur. The term Haldighati has been derived from the yellow-colored soil of the place that gives a sense of turmeric (in Hindi).
* '''Jagat Temple''' - Jagat Village, 58km southeast of Udaipur. Built-in 961 A.D, the Jagat Temple is renowned for its intricate carvings in the exteriors.

Devotees throng the shrine in large numbers during occasions of "Janmashtmi", the day of the Lord's birth, and other festivals like Holi. It is famous for its pichwai paintings, with Shri Krishna in the center, and is recognized for its profuse use of gold color.
