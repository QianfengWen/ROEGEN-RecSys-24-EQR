'''[http://www.sarajevo.ba/ Sarajevo]''', the capital of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], is a city of 395,133 people (urban area), nestled in a valley, mainly within the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but with parts in the Republika Srpska entity.

==Understand==

Sarajevo is one of the most historically interesting and varied cities in Europe. It is a place where the people of the Christian Roman Catholic, Orthodox and the Muslim Ottoman, met, lived and warred. It has been both an example of historical turbulence and the clash of civilizations, as well as a beacon of hope for peace and tolerance through multi-cultural integration. Sarajevo is not a huge city - 395,133 people live in its urban area, but it is very livable, vibrant and busy. The city is historically famous for its traditional religious diversity, with adherents of Islam, Orthodoxy, Catholicism and Judaism coexisting there for centuries.

Today, the city has physically recovered from most of the war damage caused by the Yugoslav Wars of 1992-1995. Sarajevo is a cosmopolitan European capital with a unique Eastern twist that is a delight to visit. The people are very friendly, be they Bosniaks, Croats, or Serb. There is very little crime, and the city ranks as one of the safest in South Eastern Europe.

The town is very tourist friendly, especially in the city center.

==Weather==

Four distinct seasons with warm or hot summers and cold winters. Sarajevo is basically on the mountain so winters can be slightly colder here than in other capital cities in the region. You should not be surprised if you see some snow in mid October, but also sometimes in May, although it rarely occurs and stays on the ground for a very short period. Autumn can be cool, but during that period Sarajevo is very foggy and gray with little bit of sunshine.

- Summer - from July to the end of August; temperatures vary, but you can expect hot wave in July or early August (34 to 38 C) that can last for two weeks. Normally temperatures in this season are between 25 and 34 C.

- Autumn - already in late August it becomes slightly cooler, but still warm. You can expect real autumn at the begin of October. Sometimes there is some snow in late October and very often in November. Temperatures rarely exceed 23 C around this period. 

[[Image:Autumn_sarajevo.jpg|thumb|Autumn in Sarajevo]]

- Winter - already in November it becomes obviously colder. December, January and February can be particularly cold with temperatures low as -20 C, but normally it stays around -10 to +15 C. Winters can last for a long period in Sarajevo, sometimes even as long as 5 months. Winter in 2011 and 2015 were very cold and snowy for example (-27 C) so do not be surprised.

- Spring - beautiful season, but you can also expect some cold waves in March or even in April. May or June can be the most pleasant months to visit if you are not into cold weather and snow. During this time temperatures can stay around 25 C.

==Get in==

If you are not staying at a hotel (i.e. a private residence), you must register with the SPS (near the airport) within 48 hours of arrival. Failure to register may result in a fine or possible removal. As of early 2017, this fine was 300 KM (150 euros).

===By plane===

[[File:Sarajevo airport (from plane).jpg|thumb|Sarajevo airport]]
'''[https://www.sarajevo-airport.ba/?lang=eng]''' ({{IATA|SJJ}}) is located 6.1km southwest of the railway station, in the suburb of Butmir.

The following airlines operate service to/from Sarajevo Airport:

* Adria Airways ([[Ljubljana]]),

* Austrian Airlines ([[Vienna]]),

* Croatia Airlines ([[Zagreb]]),

* Germanwings ([[Cologne]]/[[Bonn]], [[Stuttgart]]),

* Air Serbia ([[Belgrade]]),

* Lufthansa ([[Munich]]),

* Norwegian ([[Oslo]]-Gardermoen, [[Stockholm]]-Arlanda seasonal), and

* Pegasus (Istanbul-Sabiha Gökçen, only certain days of the week)

* Turkish Airlines ([[Istanbul]]-Istanbul Airport)

* Qatar Airways (Hamad International Airport - [[Doha]], [[Qatar]]. TUE, WED, FRI, SUN)

* Flydubai ([[Dubai]]-[[United Arab Emirates]], MON & FRI)

To travel between the airport and the city center:

* '''Airport bus 'Airport - Baščaršija''' - bus from the airport to city centre (5KM one way, 8 KM return, first luggage to 23 kg is free, second luggage and luggage over 23 kg is 5 KM). Airport stop is just to the right as you exit the terminal. In the city center, the bus runs the loop together with the rest of the traffic, meaning you should be able to catch it/get off at any bus/tram stop. At Baščaršija square, it stops at the tram stop, NOT the separate bus stop slightly up the hill.

The schedule is posted on [https://www.sarajevo-airport.ba/Page/Autobus airport website], however, because it runs with the regular (heavy) traffic, those times are approximate at best. In August 2019, neither the last bus departing at 22:00 from airport, nor the 6:40 bus from Baščaršija were anywhere to be found between 30 minutes prior to and 20 minutes past those times. But the bus was sitting at the airport at around 7:45 even though it was supposed to depart at 7:25. So good luck!

* '''Trolley bus 103''' [updated 2017.11]

* '''Trolley bus 107''' (If you take this bus, take off just after it turns left and crosses the river. From there' the old town is a 15-minutes-walk away.) Getting this bus is not difficult but also not obvious, so be sure to print a map before,
Google maps is accurate.
You have to exit the airport at the main gate, this is where the sidewalk ends so turn right
and start walking along the highway. On the left side will be a residential neighborhood called Dobrinja.
Walk a couple hundred meters and then cut through the neighborhood to get to
another large road that has the bus stop named Dobrinja Skole on google maps in front of Mercator center. This is where the
trolley 103 stops every 6-7 minutes during daytime.
The trolley is very slow so it will take about 25 minutes to get to Plaza Austrija which is
the final station and in the center of old town if you cross the bridge.
You can do the same on the way back to the airport. Trolley costs 1.80 paid to the driver as of April, 2018.
Be sure to buy a ticket as controllers are frequent.

* '''Bus #200E''' This bus service has been suspended **
* '''Bus #36''' ?? This bus runs between the airport and Nedžarići (1.6 KM), where connections can be made to trams to the city center. Bus #36 operates every 30 minutes 06:00-23:00 Mon-Fri, 06:00-08:00 and 14:00-18:00 Sat and 08:00-15:00 Sun.
* '''Private transfer [http://www.airport-transfer.ba]''' they can provide you with great service and agreed fixed price in advance.
* '''Taxi''' fares to/from the airport are surprisingly expensive for the short distance. The company '''Red Taxi''' <phone="+387 33 760600"> is recommended as they charge what is listed on the meter, which you can call them on arrival and meet them in the parking lot. The dispatchers usually speak English.

===By train===
[https://www.zfbh.ba/en Train timetables for variety of destinations can be searched online], however, do not book tickets online as you will still have to go to the train station to have them hand-written out for you. Trains run between Sarajevo and [[Mostar]] (2 per day: 7:15 and 16:49 as of August 2019, 2 hours but expect slight delays).

The scenery on the train ride between Sarajevo and [[Mostar]] is stunning, passing through rugged terrain with a series of tunnels, U-turns and viaducts. Sit on the left side. It is much more picturesque, as well as cheaper, to travel between these cities by train

One-way 2nd class ticket costs 13 KM, 1st class - 16.80KM, including train station fees, as of August 2019. However, the facilities of the train stations are rather dated. The train itself is a newer Talgo unit, and is suitably comfortable and air conditioned.

In Sarajevo, catch the tram #1 from old city to the train station.

===By car===

[[Image:Main_boulevard_sarajevo.jpg|thumb|One of the main boulevards in Sarajevo.)]]

Roads in Bosnia are often only a single lane in either direction, and due to the mountainous topography tend to be very windy and speed limits are lower (mostly 80 kmh). Beware of trucks and people dangerously overtaking on any road. There are many tunnels, and you must always drive with your lights ON (day or night). However, in recent years significant modernization has taken place.

Driving in Sarajevo can be very difficult in neighborhoods around the city centre, specially in Old Town where many street are one way. The city is normally very busy so pay attention as in any other urban area.

Fast and reliable service with one or two short breaks to Belgrade via the Šepak/Trbušnica border crossing. When booking (via Facebook is often quickest and simplest), include pick-up address, date/time and a phone number at which you may be reached.</listing>

===By bus===

There are two bus stations in Sarajevo. 

On all intercity buses you pay a fee for luggage. This fee of €1 per piece of luggage is paid to the driver upon boarding. Some drivers are rather picky about being paid in exact change in the correct currency (sometimes a local currency, at other instances requesting to be paid in Euros) and sometimes also refuse to be paid in too small coins. So keep some change ready.

==== Autobuska stanica  (main bus station)====

This station is located at GPS coordinate 43.858858, 18.396943, right next to the train station, at the end of number 1 tram line that takes you to the old town (1.60 KM).

This bus station serves both domestic and international destinations. It is advisable to buy international tickets in advance since these routes fill up quickly. International tickets can be bought [http://www.centrotrans.com/loc/ online], at the station, or from the Eurolines office near the cathedral between the old bazaar. Information on bus routes can also be obtained from the tourist information offices.

* There are several buses a day to/from [[Mostar]] which also stop at Konjic and Jablanica along the way. These large, modern, air conditioned coaches are operated by Autoperevoz company and, unlike what many locals will tell you, do not leave every hour. As of August 2019,  These leave at 06:00, 07:00, 09:00, 11:30, 12:30, 15:00, and 18:15 and journey time is approximately two and a half hours. You can check schedule [http://www.autobusni-kolodvor.com/en/timetable.aspx online]. Single tickets cost 21KM (as of August 2019), seats are not assigned (although the ticket will show a seat number, the two seats behind the driver may be taken by conductor, albeit not supposed to).

* There are also buses to [[Split]] (7-8 hours) and a daily bus to [[Dubrovnik]] which leaves at 07:00 and costs 40-160KN.

* There are several buses a day from the main bus station to [[Banja Luka]]. These leave at 05:00, 07:55, 09:15, 14:30, 15:30 and 16:30. Journey time is approximately 5 hours.

* There is a daily bus to [[Graz]] and [[Vienna]], leaving from the main bus station at 08:00, reaching Graz at 19:45 and Vienna around 2 hours later. A one-way ticket costs €44. You will have to pay the driver 2 KM to transport luggage. There are frequent stops on the way, including for food and toilets. Do not rely on these "food stops" as they are basically just shops to buy coffee and you will need local currency to buy anything.

* [http://www.eurobusways.com/ Eurobusways] operates direct service between Sarajevo and [[Budapest]].

* Buses to [[Tuzla]] leave from the main bus station approximately every hour every day. The journey takes approximately 3 hours, and costs around 11 KM.

* There is a bus every day from [[Pristina]] in [[Kosovo]] at 18:30 from the main bus station. The bus is listed on the station schedule as travelling to [[Novi Pazar]], Serbia. From there it travels on to Sarajevo. You can buy the ticket to Novi Pazar at the bus station, or from the controller on board the bus for the whole journey. You might have to change buses in Novi Pazar (which is surprisingly hassle-free). The price from Pristina to Novi Pazar is €7, from Novi Pazar to Sarajevo is €15, and payment is possible in Euros or Serbian dinars. The bus arrives in Novi Pazar around midnight, and Sarajevo around 06:00. Make sure you have the proper travel document to enter Serbia (see [[Kosovo]] Get in section) as the controller will not issue you tickets without seeing them first! Another possibility is to book a bus to Podgorica in Montenegro, and then travel from there to Pristina. 

* There is one bus per day from the main station to Belgrade, at 06:00, costing 40KM. Note that there are several daily buses to Belgrade from the Lukavica station (see below).

====Autobuska stanica Istočno Sarajevo ('Lukavica')====

There is also another bus station in Eastern (Serb-dominated) Sarajevo on the outskirts of the city serving the Republika Srpska and destinations in both [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]]. GPS location 43.823681, 18.356529.

To get here, it is probably easiest to book/order a taxi (around 15KM). If using public transport, take 103 or 107 bus/trolleybus, or the 31E, all from Trg Austria and exit at the last station, and ask people how to get to Lukavica bus station (buses and trolleybuses to the city centre depart from a terminal around 200m from where the international buses arrive). Arriving at Istočno Sarajevo Bus Station, continue on the main road, having the bus station on your right -  you will see the Dobrinja trolleybus stop to your right. Buy ticktes at the booth. If you need Bosnian currency there is a Visa/Mastercard cash machine (bankomat) in the nearby Tom shopping centre. To get there walk into the opposite direction of the trolleybus stop, having the bus station to your left. The shopping centre is at the next big traffic light. There are 2 cash machines (Unicredit and NLB) outside and you'll find a supermarket inside.

Note that the Lukavica 'Eastern' station is actually to the west of the 'main' bus station, and is basically to the west of most of Sarajevo's suburbs.

[http://sarajevo.co.ba/servisi/javni-transport/autobuska-stanica-lukavica/ Click here for Lukavica bus station time table] 

* The bus ride from Lukavica bus station to [[Podgorica]] (35KM) in and Budva (40KM) [[Montenegro]] takes 7 hours (35KM) but is an absolutely amazing ride through some wonderful countryside on the route Lukavica-Trnovo-Rataj-Foca-Brod-Hum-Goransko-Niksic-Danilovgrad-Podgorica (sit on the right side of the bus for the best views). Buses leave at 08:15, 09:00, 14:00 and 22:30. Payment in Euro is accepted.
 
* Bus departure times for Lukavica - [[Belgrade]] are: 08:00, 09:45, 12:30, 15:00 and 22:00 daily. One way ticket cost 40KM.

* Bus departure times for Lukavica - [[Novi Sad]] are: 06:40, 13:30 daily, Thursday and Saturday: also 23:15

* Lukavica - [[Niš]] 08:40, 18:00

===Hitch hiking===

From Mostar, hitching a ride through the beautiful mountains up the M-17 road to Sarajevo is quite easy. Make sure you have a sign though and a Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian language phrasebook would be useful. If you have trouble getting out of Mostar, change the sign to Jablanica where traffic will branch of NW to Banja Luka and then hitch on to Sarajevo from Jablanica. Sarajevo is a long thin city so try to get a lift into the centre. If not, get one at least to the tram tracks that go there from the west of the city limits.

==Get around==
[[File:Avaz Twist Tower, Sarajevo.jpeg|thumb|270px|The Avaz Twist Tower, tallest skyscraper in the Balkans]]

===By foot===
The central area is very compact so it is great to explore it on foot. Have in mind that Sarajevo is surrounded by hills and mountains, and many neighborhoods (even some in central area) might be demanding for walking, especially if the weather is too hot or too cold. Building numbers are more or less consecutive but don't follow the "hundreds" styles of the United States, e.g., 23 Bjestiva street may be blocks from 27 Bjestiva street, specially in the neighborhoods on the hills around.


 [[Image:Marijin_dvor_business_district.jpg|thumb|Marijin dvor, a business district in Sarajevo]]

===By public transport===
'''[http://www.gras.ba GRAS]''' operates public transportation in Sarajevo.

[[File:Sarajevo_-_tram_map.png|thumb|right|300px|Sarajevo Tram map]]

There are some new, but also some very old trams in Sarajevo. This is the most popular form of public transport in the city and trams are very often overcrowded.

The center of Sarajevo is served by a spinal tram network which makes a counter clockwise loop around the central district. This tram network opened in the mid-1870s and was the first in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Tickets should be purchased in advance from kiosks labeled ''tisak'' on the street or from the driver, where they cost slightly more (around 1.80KM). Tickets should be validated upon boarding the vehicle and are valid for a one way trip only. Changing tram or bus means validating a new ticket. A day card valid for unlimited travel on all local public transport in Zone A is available for about 5KM. Please note that inspectors board public transport very frequently: if you can't reach the validator machine because the tram is too crowded, then don't board the tram.

If you wish to tour the city center using the '''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trams_in_Sarajevo Tram]''' this is highly possible thanks to its cycle route around the city center.This is highly recommended if you don't wish to walk all the pedestrian area and you want to approach from the perimeter and head directly to some sights like the City Hall, Bascarcija, Cathedral, Museum or Latin Bridge. For a complete experience however walking in the main pedestrian street of the old town is highly advisable. As of August 2015 it seems that only line number 3 runs in a frequency of a few minutes all along the network(very convenient) with some infrequent departures of Line  1 spotted leaving the Railway station and following a cycle route with the same ending point. However, if you are planning to head to and from the railway station or the sided Main bus station simply walk until the main cycle line(road parallel the tracks that passes in front of the US Embassy) which is served by tram 3 in order to not waste time for the sporadic passes of Line 1.

If you are planning to visit some neighborhoods not situated along the main boulevard you should use taxi since small buses are not so frequent and sometimes schedule is not respected. The best solution for travelers who are visiting Dobrinja or East Sarajevo is a trolleybus that runs regularly between The Square of Austria (very downtown) and Dobrinja. Trolleybus is very convenient for all visitors that arrive at the East Sarajevo Bus Station.

Please have in mind that tram and bus tickets are not valid for trolleybuses - you will have to buy another ticket and this ticket is valid for a one way trip.

Also note that when validating a ticket on the trams to insert the ticket upside down. If you follow the arrow it will not validate. The fine is 26.60 BAM. Welcome to Sarajevo.

===By taxi===
Be careful when taking taxis from the main railway or bus station and the airport. Firstly, drivers are known to charge far more to tourists who have just arrived and do not know the area, so you can easily end up paying at least double of normal price. It is advisable to get an idea of the maximum cost of taxi before you arrive (ask your hostel/hotel) and negotiating the price with the driver in advance. Should there be a problem when you arrive at your destination and the driver suddenly speaks less English, ask at your accommodation for help - they will be used to dealing with this scam.  Secondly, the other well-known "taxi scam" operates in Sarajevo, where the unsuspecting tourist will be taken to a more expensive hotel than the one he or she has asked to be taken to, and the driver and receptionist will swear that the new arrival is in fact in the right place. Have a picture of where you are staying ready, or at least be familiar with its appearance. Many accommodation options will offer a pickup from wherever you arrive, and this is usually free or at a very minimal cost.  

Another taxi scam to be wary of, involves using a rigged meter when the rate increases to a suspiciously high level.  

If you are taking taxi from city centre to the Airport it should cost around 20 KM (10 Euros), plus or minus few KMs. If you are charged much more that this you should complain and refuse to pay that much. Please, feel free to show you are familiar with the prices. Although most taxi drivers are legal and hence registered, some of them take advantage of new tourists who are not familiar with the city. Also, it is not unknown for legal taxi drivers to set irregular prices. 

If you still would like to order a taxi, try ''033 663 555''.

===By bike===

Sarajevo has a brand new bike path from Ilidža to Hrasno neighborhood. Bike lovers will be able to drive along the main avenue from Hrasnica (western suburb) to Skenderija (central area). Bike path (when completed) will run on both sides of the main avenue (along the tram line). 

[[Image:Bike_path_sarajevo.jpg|thumb|New bike path in Sarajevo along the main boulevard]]

Be careful when using the current built bike path: some pedestrians are not familiar with these new red paths and they still do not understand this is built only for bike riders. Also, this bike path is one way path on both sides of the main avenue, but some bikers do not pay attention and they use wrong side. Path is well marked, but locals will need little bit of time to understand the purpose of red paths.

===Museums===

Sarajevo's museums are in disrepair, due to disputes over which arm of the government is responsible for funding them. However, they are still worth visiting.

Leave the bus at Butmir, where the bus turns around to go back, near two small graveyards. From there you cross the bridge on your left hand facing the airport into Tuneli Street. A better option could be to catch a taxi from the tram terminal. taxi from the centre city costs ~17 KM one way. Take the #3 tram to the end of the line from the city centre.

He will take you around the city in his private car, up to 7 people at a time, and share the story of his family during the war. There is a frontlines tour that he gives along with his father, who was part of ye armed resistance that defended the city. He also does a tour to the projects/ working class neighbourhoods of Sarajevo, where you can still (2019) clearly see the impacts of the war on people’s daily lives. He is a very honest, no bullshit type of guy that clearly never wanted to become a tour guide but feels its necessary to share his story.  Tours need to be arranged via his website or email and are 40BM/€20 per person.

===Prepaid cards and the Internet===
Buying a prepaid sim card in Bosnia and Herzegovina is quite easy. But this will also depend on the service provider you are choosing. The main network operators in Bosnia and Herzegovina are BH Telecom, m:tel and HT Eronet. All of the providers have different offers, prices, and terms of services. Regardless of which one you choose, most of them make it quite easy for visitors to buy sim card. Most of the big cities and towns have official stores where you can find out the best internet options and prices. However, probably the best and most common place to buy your sim card is from numerous newsstands and kiosks. 

The quickest way to recharge your prepaid phone or mobile broadband service is online at https://edopuna.ba which is available in multiple languages and works for all providers, or you can visit your nearest newsstand or kiosk.

There are still some minefields and unexploded ordnance / bombs / explosive remnants of war in the Sarajevo area and its outskirts, although the Canton itself is 98% clear of mines, so the problem isn't as big as in some other regions. ''Never'' go into remote damaged buildings, and always stick to paved surfaces, avoiding the forests in Sarajevo Canton (especially the ones on Trebević and Igman mountains without marked pedestrian paths). Areas that are not cleared are marked by yellow tape or signs, but still not all minefields have been identified (due to the lack of resources and the lack of international help). Paved roads are always safe. 
As with any country in the former Yugoslavia, don't get into sensitive discussions about politics and religion with people you do not know.

Be aware of pickpockets who usually operate on public transportation vehicles and in central city area (from Baščaršija to Sarajevo City Center). Use a bit of common sense (eg. keeping your valuables in inside pockets of your jacket/coat) like in any big city and you should be safe. Good advice would be to stick to locals if you know them, as those groups almost exclusively target tourists.

There were a number of violent thefts reported at the abandoned Bobsled track from the Winter Olympic games of 1984 (absolute time frame not given). Armed car thefts are not unheard of in this area as it is close to the Republika Srpska entity border and the Bosnian auto-mafia from both entities usually operates between the borders.

Do not rely on the help of the police if you get attacked, robbed or your car gets stolen/broken into, as procedures regarding theft and petty crimes related to foreigners can often take a long time and finish after you leave the country. Some officers will just ignore your case if they can't do anything about it because you're leaving the whole country in a few days.

'''DO NOT''' park your car with any foreign plates anywhere outside of secured parking lots - this applies for the whole city!!!

'''DO NOT''' park you car in Kulina bana street next to the Drvenija bridge in the center - this parking spot has been known for thefts and windows breaking and tourists are victims quite often. Also do not park your car in Kulovica street in the center, across from Hotel Bosnia. You should park you car either in the BBI Center parking lot or in Sarajevo City Center parking lot.

If you see beggars on the streets (specially Romani kids) we do not suggest you to give any money - most beggars are part of a well organized groups so at the end these beggars have to give all money to the "heads" of these groups. Also, beware of older women with some papers in their hands standing in the middle of Sarači street (main promenade in the Baščaršija) and asking for your signature or money.If you stop and give them money, they will start telling you a fake story about how they're homeless and without a place to stay for the night and will ask you to provide it for them. If you pass by them and they start asking for your money, just say "no thank you" and walk away.

Be careful when you cross the street in the night - drivers tend to speed and very often they do not show any respect for pedestrians. There have been numerous incidents on crosswalks and tram stations with pedestrians being involved, some of them with serious injuries or even death. 
Always look both ways when crossing the street, even when the green light is on.

A final point on health and safety is that the air in Sarajevo can be noticeably thick with pollution during the colder months, so that asthmatics or those with other chest problems may find themselves short of breath a lot of the time, particularly at night. Please do ensure you have ample medication, just in case.

==Respect==

Respect the war history. Many people you will meet lived in Sarajevo during siege and they have many stories to share about that period.

Also, respect religious diversity. The city is a unique mixture of secular and religious people and they are very proud of diverse religious architecture in the city. Do not assume somebody is of a particular faith just because she or he has a certain name - or, do not assume somebody is not religious just because they behave in a certain way. People here tend to observe religion in a very unique way. Finally, there are many mixed marriages and very often those people do not want to be observed as Bosniaks, Serbs or Croats.

If you are visiting East Sarajevo show respect for their war stories. Although East and "Federal" Sarajevo form a single urban area, they are officially two cities with separated administrations. Most people do not have any problems today to visit other part of the city, but there are still some minor tensions.

Most Bosnians (regardless of ethnicity) are extremely warm and friendly so if somebody invites you for a drink or meal it would be nice to accept the invitation.

Do not expect everyone speaks English - most young and educated Bosnians will not have any problems with English, but older generations are more prone to speak German (some might speak Russian or Italian). Many young Bosnians also speak German.
