'''Nanaimo''' [http://www.nanaimo.ca/] is the central hub city of [[Vancouver Island]] in [[British Columbia | BC]], [[Canada]].  It is the second largest city on the island and has the second biggest harbour.  In many ways it is the smaller cousin of [[Victoria (British Columbia)|Victoria]].  Like much of Vancouver Island it has moved from being primarily an industrial town to a tourist city that attracts a large number of retirees from the rest of Canada.

==Buy== 

Nanaimo is the largest city that can be easily accessed by most of Vancouver Island.

Much of this shopping is in the large number of malls and big box retailers on the outskirts of the City.  However, most of the interesting shops are in the downtown core.  Here you will find...
