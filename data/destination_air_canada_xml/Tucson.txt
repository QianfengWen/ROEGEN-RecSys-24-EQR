'''Tucson''' [http://www.cityoftucson.org/visitor.html] (pronounced TOO-sawn) is the second-largest city in the state of [[Arizona]], in the [[United States of America]]. At an elevation of 2,400 feet, it has slightly cooler temperatures than its desert cousin, [[Phoenix]]. It is situated in the biologically diverse Sonoran Desert. With a population of 486,699 (2000 Census) in Tucson and 843,746 in the greater metro area, which also includes Marana, Oro Valley, Green Valley, Sahuarita, Drexel Heights, Vail, South Tucson, etc (most of eastern Pima County [http://www.pima.gov/]), Tucson was the 32nd fastest growing of 280 metropolitan areas from 1990-2000. As of the 2010 census, the population within the city limits was 520,116 and the Greater Tucson Metropolitan Area population was 980,263, making it the 52nd biggest metropolitan area in the country.

==Understand==
Tucson has always been a crossroad.  Until recently, water was relatively plentiful in Tucson, in spite of its location in the middle of a desert.  This made it an important travel route, an agricultural center, and a communications nexus.

Tucson's history is ancient, with evidence of human occupation stretching back 10,000 years.  Between A.D. 200 and 1450, the Hohokam culture dominated the area -- the Pima and Tohono O'Odham peoples that still occupy the area are descendants of the Hohokam.  In 1699, Father Eusebio Kino, S.J., established the Mission San Xavier del Bac, southwest of present-day Tucson.  Over the next 100 years, other missions were established in the area, but European presence was minimal.

It wasn't until 1775 that the Presidio of Tucson was created by Don Hugo O'Connor.  At that time, it was the northernmost Spanish outpost in the New World.  In 1821, Tucson became part of the new country of Mexico, and in 1853 it became part of the United States as a result of the Gadsden Purchase.  In 1863, Arizona became a US territory, and by 1880, its population was around 8,000.  In 1912, Arizona became the 48th state to enter the union.

Today, Tucson is still a crossroads, with European, Native American, Mexican, and Asian cultures bumping into one another, in sometimes conflicting and sometimes compatible -- but always interesting -- ways.

===Climate===
Most people tend to assume that Tucson's climate is similar to [[Phoenix]]'s. While the two cities have many similarities Tucson's much higher altitude means that it is cooler and wetter and the absence of the urban heat island effect means a larger diurnal temperature variation. 

'''Winters:''' Winters are mild when compared to the rest of the US, with highs usually reaching 65˚F (18˚C) and occasionally surpassing 70˚F (21˚C). Don’t come here though dressed only with shorts and short sleeves; the city’s location (desert and high altitude) means that nights can get cold with lows usually from the mid-30s and the mid-40s (around 5˚C). Freezing temperatures are not uncommon and happen on average 25 days per year, while lows can dive down to the 20s (around -5˚C) once or twice every winter. Snow is rare but flurries have fallen a handful of times with the last occurrence being in February 2019 when 1.9 inches coated the city. 

'''Spring:''' Spring is short, dry and usually lasts from March to late April. Springtime also has the most intense diurnal temperature variations; for example, during March the daytime high may be well above 75˚F (25˚C) but nighttime lows may be well below 50˚F (10˚C); dress for all occasions. 

'''Summer:''' Summers are very hot but slightly cooler than Phoenix due to the city’s altitude. Still daytime high temperatures usually hover around 100˚F (38˚C) even reaching 110˚F (43˚C) in seldom occasions. The record high is 117˚F (47˚C). The sun is intense in Tucson during part of the year, and significant protection is needed for those who spend time outdoors. Recent studies show the rate of skin cancer in Arizona is at least three times higher than in more northerly regions. Additional intense heating is a risk to hikers and others who seek to hike canyons and exposed areas. Mid and late summer are characterized by higher humidity and rain attributed to the '''North American Monsoon'''. It begins with clouds building up from the south in the early afternoon followed by intense thunderstorms and rainfall, which can cause flash floods. The evening sky at this time of year is often pierced with dramatic lightning strikes. Large areas of the city do not have storm sewers, so monsoon rains flood the main thoroughfares, usually for no longer than a few hours. A few underpasses in Tucson have "feet of water" scales painted on their supports to discourage fording by automobiles during a rainstorm. 

'''Autumn:''' Autumn is much like spring though slightly wetter. September can still be hot with highs around 95˚F (35˚C) and warm nights in the upper 60s. Temperatures become much cooler by the beginning of November with cool to cold nights the mid-40s (around 5˚C) but heavenly warm days in the low 70s (around 20˚C).

A tram (for a fee) will take visitors 9 stops into Sabino Canyon; a separate tram will take you into Bear Canyon and to the trailhead of the popular Seven Falls Trail. To park, you will need a National Park Pass ($5 day, $20 annual) which is also good to use on Mt. Lemmon.
*'''Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum''', 2021 N. Kinney Rd., Tel. (520) 883-2702, [http://www.desertmuseum.org/].  More like Biosphere II than a walled institution, the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum is part zoo, part natural history museum and part botanical garden all in one Tucson attraction. From tarantulas to black bears, coyotes to scorpions, the museum-zoo is an entrancing and full-contact tribute to the Sonoran desert's wildlife (the wire fences are nearly invisible and the hummingbirds in the buzzing, walk-in aviary seem to think you are the attraction). Give yourself time to soak in the Southwest splendor and if time is all you have, the Museum is also on the fringes of Saguaro National Park, home to the world's largest forests of Saguaro cacti.  
*'''[[Saguaro National Park]]''', 3693 South Old Spanish Trail, Tel. (520) 733-5153, [http://www.nps.gov/sagu/]. The most dense forest of the iconic cactus of the American West. The park has two unconnected units to the east and west of Tucson.

*'''Mission San Xavier del Bac''', 1950 W. San Xavier Rd., Tel. (520) 294-2624, [http://www.sanxaviermission.org/]. The "White Dove of the Desert" is a Tucson mission. Pure white and pristine against a hot desert backdrop, and still heady inside its elaborately colored and muraled interior from centuries of supplication, the Mission San Xavier del Bac was finished in 1797 when Arizona was still New Spain. It has recently been cleaned and restored by professional art conservators who worked with, and trained members of the community.  
*'''Old Tucson Studios''', 201 S. Kinney Rd., Tel. (520) 883-0100, [http://www.oldtucson.com/].  Ever notice that Hollywood's Old West, the backdrop for the gun-slinging and cryptic comments of Hollywood's Western icons -- Wayne, Eastwood, Douglas and Newman -- has much in common with the Wild West of today's Tombstone and Geronimo? They've all been filmed at the Old Tucson Studios, originally built in 1939 for the making of the William Holden vehicle "Arizona." Still an active film, TV and commercial set, it's also a nostalgia-themed park, with main drag shootouts, corseted can-can dancers, educational shows, pre-Prohibition saloons, restaurants, and gift shops.
*'''El Tiradito (The Castaway)''',  South Granada Avenue at West Cushing Street.  El Tiradito is the only shrine to a sinner in North America.  In the 1880s, a young man had an affair with his mother-in-law.  When caught in the act, his father-in-law shot him and he stumbled from bed and ran out of the house.  He dropped dead on this spot, and because he had not confessed his sins, he could not be buried in the church yard.  His family and friends interred him where he fell, but remembered him with candles and flowers.  People still burn candles and leave offerings today.  The shrine is in what remains of Tucson's barrio (much of which was destroyed when the Tucson Convention Center was built).  Best visited at dusk or after dark.

Some motels located on West Miracle Mile Rd and south of 3000th block of North Oracle Rd tend to be cheaper, run-down motels that involve the shady types. Although good deals can be found you probably wouldn't want to take your family to any one of these. This area is a legacy of the pre-freeway auto courts, 1937 to 1965, [http://weeklywire.com/ww/10-13-97/tw_feat.html], called Miracle Mile [http://www.azstarnet.com/sn/portillo/145661]. A number of the old hotels remain, mostly run by Indian owners, compete on price and upkeep. With the city fighting crime, mostly prostitution, aggressively in the area, widening and landscaping Oracle Rd, even removing one of the few traffic circles in Tucson, now only a unsavory reputation remains as the area tries to pull itself out of decline.

==Stay safe==

* If you go walking in the desert parks, or on your own, learn desert-safety tips. Take water, always let someone know where you are going and when you expect to get back, and if you have a cell phone, take it with you and have it on. It's disturbingly easy to get lost in the desert. Also, watch for snakes and bugs, as a few are dangerous to your health. When hiking, for example, rattlesnakes are easy to come across. When putting your slippers on in the morning, scorpions can be an unpleasant surprise.

* Midtown (specifically the section along Alvernon Road between Grant and Ft. Lowell) and the South section of the city (in the general area between I-10, I-19, and Valencia) are not the safest places to be--but there are no real attractions in these areas anyway. Downtown is heavily occupied until 2AM when the bars close. If you are downtown after 2AM, be cautious. While murder rates are fairly low, they are violent and sometimes random. There is gang activity but for the most part it is directed against rival gangs. There are many homeless people downtown. The center city is heavily populated by the "young and restless", so it may seem a spooky to more conservative travelers due to the dirt and noise the youngsters create.

* Residents of Arizona are allowed to carry concealed firearms after completing training and a thorough background check.

* Unfortunately, Tucson has one of the highest rates of vehicle theft in the USA, and there are a few locations in the city you're more likely to have your car/truck stolen at than at any other place in the town (such as the Wal-Mart on 1650 West Valencia Road and the Park Place Mall).  

* During the monsoon season (usually in the months of July - September), Tucson does experience flash flooding.  Under no circumstances should you attempt to drive across a flooded road that is barricaded.  If your vehicle becomes stranded in your attempt to cross the barricaded road: you will be issued a traffic citation by the police under the 1995 "stupid motorist law" (Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 28-910), fined in the amount of $2000, and ordered to pay for all rescue costs (usually $1500 or more - and that doesn't include the towing expense either).  Also, if you knowingly drive a vehicle into a flooded road that is barricaded with a child under the age of 16, you may also be charged with a class-1 misdemeanor charge of child endangerment (Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 13-3619 - per each child in the car) in addition to the previously mentioned penalties if your car becomes stranded.

==Stay healthy==

* Newcomers to the southwest often hear about a lung infection called Valley Fever (a fungal disease - the proper medical name is called, ''coccidioidomycosis'').  Although it's rare to contract this disease, it should be taken seriously as it is difficult for most doctors to accurately identify it (a blood test called a coccidioidal must be done to accurately diagnose this illness), and it takes weeks for the symptoms to fully develop for an ''experienced'' doctor to recognize them.  Exposure to very dusty conditions (ATV riding in the desert, construction, getting caught in a sudden dust storm) increases the opportunity to become infected.  It is recommended to wear a face mask if you intend to be exposed to dusty conditions, and strongly recommended if you have a lung disease or temporarily suffering from pneumonia.[http://www.cdc.gov/nczved/dfbmd/disease_listing/coccidioidomycosis_gi.html#10]  There is currently no cure for this disease, only long term treatment.  For acute symptoms patients may be prescribed an antifungal drug such as ''fluconazole''.

* Take precautions for [[sunburn_and_sun_protection|sunburn and heat stroke]]. This cannot be emphasized enough if you plan to make a trek in the desert mountains. It's easy to sunburn and windburn out in the desert, and the UV rays are very strong.  It is recommended to use sunscreen with at least a UV protection rating of 30 or higher.  Be mindful of the extreme heat when hiking in the mountains during the summer months to avoid suffering from heat exhaustion or possibly dying from heat stroke.  

* Mosquitoes can be bad after a monsoon (usually in the months of July - September), so consider wearing mosquito repellent with a high concentration of DEET to reduce the risk of acquiring diseases typically transmitted by these annoying insects.

* Care should be taken when you decide to ride a motorcycle or ATV in the desert, so you don't get injured by running into or bushing against the "jumping cholla" cacti.  Wearing thick protective clothing, helmets, and gloves while riding are an absolute must.  These are '''very''' prickly cacti with stems that detach with little or no effort, also the cacti spines are very painful to remove from your skin once contact is made.

==Contact==

For all emergencies you may dial 911 from any cell (active or inactive cell phone) or land line phone free-of-charge.  If using a cell phone be sure to inform the operator of your exact location, as it takes extra time for the operator to attempt to triangulate your location--time is of the essence in emergency situations. When calling 911 for assistance be as calm as possible, and do not panic or use profanity over the phone, as the operator on the phone might consider the call as a prank.

For non-emergencies dial the police department at 520-791-4444 between 0800-2200 hrs (after 2200 hrs, you may dial 911 for all issues). If you find yourself in a non-emergency and don't have the number, simply call 911 and they'll transfer you

There are surprisingly many locations within the city of Tucson that are free Wi-Fi hotspots, so free Internet access shouldn't be viewed as a problem.  Most of the hotspots are located at coffee shops (such as the Bruegger's Bagel locations[http://www.brueggersaz.com/]), the local book store (Bookman's[http://www.bookmans.com/]), and the local libraries[http://www.library.pima.gov/services/computers/wifi.php] throughout the city.

There is not a foreign embassy in the state of Arizona; however, Tucson does has one active foreign '''consulate'''.  The metropolis of Phoenix has several other foreign consulates in the event your home nation's consulate is not available in Tucson.

Remember, a consulate is ''not'' an embassy.  An embassy is is headed by an ambassador, and respected of its sovereignty on the host nation's land.  A consulate typically does not have the same privilege of sovereignty, and is headed by a consul member.  Consulates are in essence "junior embassies" meant for visa, passport, and minor tourist / expat issues only - not facilities whereby full diplomatic services of the parent nation are provided or available to its citizens abroad.
