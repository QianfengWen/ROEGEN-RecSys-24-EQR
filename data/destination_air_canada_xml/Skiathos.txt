'''Skiathos''' is a mostly tourist island in the [[Sporades Islands]]

==Villages==

==Other destinations==
*'''Kastro''' site of the medieval center of the island. Abandoned in 19 century. 

==Understand==
Home to the airport that services the other Sporades islands, many joke that the livelier crowds in search of an instant beer are dropped off at Skiathos, where others might choose to go on by boat to quieter destinations.  While it is undoubtedly the most tourist-intensive island of the Sporades, it does have many faces, so don’t be fooled by the brash cover to this book full of splendid Greek secrets.  Steer away from the main drag and you will find stunning scenery, quaint tavernas and lots of luscious green terrain perfect for gentle strolls or more intensive hikes.

===Tourist information===
[[Image:Skiathos Town2.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Skiathos town]]

==Talk==
[[Greek phrasebook|Greek]] is the native language of the people of Skiathos. However, most people also speak passable English and many speak German or other European languages.

==Get in==

===By boat===
Skiathos is accessible via ferry from [[Volos]], Agios Konstantinos, and [[Thessaloniki]] 

'''Cruise ships''' dock at the Chora Port.

===By plane===
The island is served by an '''International Airport''' (World Airport Code '''JSI.'''). The airport is situated  north-east of Chora.  It is served from Greek destinations by Olympic Airways, and from northern European destinations in summer months by charter and some regular scheduled airlines (currently including Austrian Airlines,) usually only once or twice a week.

The runway is an excitement in itself; as you descend towards Skiathos you are met with sea, sea and more sea before out of nowhere appears a precarious strip of runway across the end of this small island.  If the pilot misses his spot, you’ll have to circle and try again!

==Get around==
[[Image:Skiathos Street.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Street in Skiathos town]]
===By bus===
Public buses operate throughout the island.
<p>The main route runs from Skiathos Bus Terminus (Stop 0) servicing all the resorts along the south coast and terminating at Koukounaries Beach (stop 26) to the west of the island. All bus stops are numbered and although they also show the place names there is a tendency throughout the island to refer to all destinations by their bus stop numbers. Fares are very reasonable at (2014) &euro;1.60, &euro;1.80 and &euro;2.00. Frequency varies according to the time of day but is typically every 15 minutes. During high season though (July and August), the buses can sometimes be jam-packed with tourists going to the beaches or Skiathos Town!

===By taxi===
Taxis are easy to get from the port to anywhere on the island. If you are waiting for a bus, the taxi drivers are allowed to stop at a bus stop and take you to your destination, along the bus route. Agree a fare first with the driver, before you board.

===By car or motorbike===
It is not worth the hassle to bring your own car to the island, although it is in theory possible. You can rent a car or a motor scooter. Asphalt roads run across the south of the island. Roads in the interior turn out to be little more than dirt paths. 

Motorbikes and mopeds are popular alternatives to cars. Especially mopeds are frequently used by local youths and can go to many places that cars cannot go - for example the twisted narrow streets of Skiathos city. An additional advantage is that they are cheap to rent - 10 to 15 Euros a day is the usual price. 

If you start a day-trip with a moped, make you sure you do so on a full tank, as gas stations are sometimes hard to find. An extra stop at a gas station can save a lot of nerves. When renting a moped, check if the profile of the tyres is ok if the brakes work properly,lights,turn indicators and petrol gauge. if it doesnt look good dont be bothered to rent it,it could be the one that needs a repair badly. it can cause you a lot of troubles if it breaks down.Make sure the insurance stands on the contract.  Helmets are required on Skiathos.

==Stay safe==
Skiathos is a generally safe destination. 
* The summer sun tends to get very strong.  You should not take the risk of dehydration, sunburns or even heat strokes lightly. Wear appropriate clothes, maybe with a hat and sunglasses; use sunscreen; bring enough water on excursions and know when to stop exhausting yourself and seek the shade of a tree.

==Get out==
The less known island of Skiathos in Greece, as featured in the Mamma Mia film, is to host the Skiathos Gay Culture Festival in July 2012, in what could become an annual event of art exhibitions, beach parties, V.I.P. parties, beach wrestling and beauty competitions. The festival intends to promote gay culture and involves art events and exhibitions as well as themed parties and other events. Organised sailing cruises on yachts as well as private flights are available for the ones who wish to enjoy a more private holiday.

Skiathos is one of the greenest islands in Greece and has been nominated the most popular Greek destination in 2010. The island has a lot to offer in terms of sightseeing and culture. Its beautiful beaches such as the so called "Small Banana" are some of the most popular beaches in Greece, and according to Tripadvisor the best Greek beach 2012.
Ideal for visiting close by islands such as Skopelos and Alonissos, where holiday makers might also have the chance to see the seals that live in the caves of the island. Skiathos enjoys a number of visitors during summer not only because of its natural beauties and crystal waters, but also because of the excellent nightlife that it has to offer. 
The area of Skiathos Town which is the center of the island is characterized by stone paths, traditional taverns and restaurants and affordable bars and nightclubs. Taking into account that Mykonos is one place that it has been extensively visited, Skiathos is hoping it will stand as an alternative potential destination not only for the gay society, but for every holiday maker.
