'''Marseille''' (Greek: ''Massalia'', Latin: ''Massilia'') is the second most populated city of [[France]] (and third most populous urban area), the biggest Mediterranean port and the economic hub of the [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]] region.

==Understand==
[[Image:Marseille.jpg|thumb|300px|Marseille, the "Old Harbour"]]
Marseille has a complex history. It was founded by the Phoceans (from the Greek city of [[Foça|Phocaea]], now Foça, in modern Turkey) in 600 BC and is one of the oldest cities in Europe. The town is a far cry from the Cézanne paintings and Provençal clichés of sleepy villages, "pétanque" players, and Marcel Pagnol novels. With around one million inhabitants, Marseille is the second-largest city in France in terms of population and the largest in terms of area. Its population is a real melting pot of different cultures. It is also said that there are more Comorian people in Marseille than in [[Comoros]]. Indeed, the people of Marseille have varying ethnic backgrounds, with many Italians and Spanish having immigrated to the area after the Second World War. 

Marseille is a place for people who are not afraid to discover a real place with real people visiting colorful markets (like Noailles market) that will make you feel like you are in Africa, or the Calanques (a natural area of big cliffs falling into the sea - Calanque means fjord), the Panier area (the oldest place of the town and historically the place where newcomers installed) or the Vieux-Port (old harbor) and the Corniche (a road along the sea), Marseille has much to offer.

==Get in==

===By plane===
* <listing name="Marseille-Provence International Airport" alt="IATA|MRS" directions="" lat="" long="" address="13700 Marignan" phone="" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="https://www.marseille-airport.com" hours="" price="">It is located about 30 km from Marseille. Buses, taxis, and a train connect it in less than 30 minutes. Shuttle services from other European cities have made more places available from Marseille. Airport buses go directly from the airport to the train station (Gare de Marseille-Saint-Charles), and from the train station to the airport, every 15 minutes.</listing>

===By train===
The main train station is Marseille St. Charles. It is well-linked to the rest parts of the city, as the two subway lines and many buses stop there. It is a short walk away from the Canebière and the Old Port. Beware that the station is located on a small hill. If you decide to go to the station on foot, you will have to climb a series of steps which may appear inconvenient, especially if you carry heavy pieces of luggage. To avoid the stairs, walk along the path to the left of the steps until you reach the lower floor of the station, then take the escalator up.

Marseille has TGV lines to [[Paris]] (3 hours) and [[Lyon]] (1h45), [[Nice]] (2h), [[Strasbourg]] (5h35), [[Frankfurt]] (7h45), [[Geneva]] (3h30) and to [[Brussels]] (5h). There is also a Spanish AVE train to [[Barcelona]] (4h30) and [[Madrid]] (7h45).

===By bus===
Eurolines[http://www.eurolines.fr/Site/EurolinesUK.nsf] has many connections all over Europe. There are at least direct connections from Marseille to [[Barcelona]], [[Prague]], and [[Tangier]]. The bus station is next to the main train station, the St. Charles Station at Rue Honnorat. You get access through Platform N in the train station. Also, there is a temporary office at Platform N.

There is also a Eurolines office on the 3 Allée Léon Gambetta. If you walk down the big stairs on the south side of the station, follow the road until you come to a squarelike intersection. The office is on your left hand.

===By car===
Marseille is very well connected to most French cities through numerous highways. As always in France those highways are expensive but practical, comfortable, and fast. Marseille is around 8 hours from Paris by car, 2 hours from [[Nice]], 1h30 from [[Montpellier]], 4 hours from [[Toulouse]] and 3 hours from [[Lyon]]. However, be aware that driving in the city center is a nightmare - park your car somewhere safe and stick to public transport whenever you can.

===By boat===
Marseille has a big harbor. There are direct ferry routes from Marseille to [[Ajaccio]], [[Bastia]], [[Porto Torres]], Porto Vecchio and [[Propriano]]. 

There are several piers at the harbor, so it is advisable to check well in advance from which pier you are departing.

The Old Port of Marseille serves the nearby islands and the nearest coastal cities.

==Get around==

===By bus, tram and underground===
Marseille is served by a relatively good public transport system, the Régie des Transports de Marseille '''RTM'''[https://www.rtm.fr/en] covering 2 underground railway lines (métro), 2 tram lines, and 74 bus lines. If you have any mobility problems, are in a wheelchair, or have a child in a pushchair, you should be aware that almost every métro station has stepped in it somewhere and some will have several flights of stairs - stick to the trams and buses which are a better option.

The number of transfers is unlimited (including the return journeys) within the one-hour limit between the first boarding and last transfer on the network (you must validate with each entry to the bus). The subway and tram systems stop running every night at 01:00. Beware that until October 2025, the metro stops at 21:30 from Monday to Thursday with free replacement bus shuttles. Most bus routes do not operate after 21:00, although a limited network of night buses (Fluobus) operates with infrequent service (about every 30 minutes) until 01:00. Using a taxi is recommended if you need to travel after 21:00.

Tickets for buses and the métro can be bought in cafés, at subway and tram stations. Single-ride tickets allow unlimited transfers between metro, bus, and trams within 1 hour of initial use, but need to be validated at every re-entry. The fare is €1.70(can be differentiated from the time, zone, age)[https://www.rtm.fr/tarifs?f%5B0%5D=categorie_de_produits_profil_%3A221&f%5B1%5D=type_de_produit%3A284&field_age_max=30&field_age_min=30&ordre=0] and it can be conveniently paid contact-less by tapping the credit card onto the validators at the doors or metro gates. You can also buy tickets from the bus drivers for 2€. Alternatively, there is a multi-journey ticket for 10 trips (''carte libertés'') at €15.00. A daily ticket (carte journée) costs €5.20, and a 72-hour ticket costs €10.80. Valid for an unlimited number of trips, on the RTM network: bus, metro, tramway, ferry boat (excluding sea shuttles), and on the Transmétropole network. 

The Pilote[https://www.lepilote.com/fr/horaires/23], includes all the bus, tram, and metro schedules but is easier to read than the RTM sites. Moreover, this site repeats the schedules of the majority of transport in common routes around the wider region (tram, interurban buses, regional trains [TER]) and makes it possible to search for journeys in Marseille and the nearby communes. Google Maps is fairly reliable too.

Airport transfers are available for €10 each way to and from Gare Saint Charles (or €16 for a return ticket). Tickets may be bought online, by credit card with the driver or at the cabin between Hall 1 and Hall 3/4 of the main terminal and at a separate kiosk in the new Gare Routière, after Voie Platform N in the Gare St Charles. The bus runs every 20 minutes for 10, 30, and 50 minutes past the hour. The ride is about 30 minutes. The bus says Navette Aeroport - Gare St Charles on it. From Gare St Charles, the métro can get you to most hotels. At night (00:00-5:00), the bus terminal in Marseille is closed and you have to walk to the left around the building to reach the busses on the other side.

===By car===
Avoid taking your car if you possibly can. Marseille, at least the center, has narrow streets, one-way streets, random lane changes and so on which can drive both locals and non-locals crazy. The local drivers have a well-deserved reputation for fearlessness - particularly if they are on two wheels. In addition, Marseille has some of the lowest parking fines in France - parking fines are rarely enforced and consequently, you will find cars parked (and sometimes double parked) everywhere.

Due to the new tunnel that is being built to try to alleviate some of Marseille's traffic problems, satellite navigational systems such as the Tom Tom are likely to be out of date and dangerous if followed. For instance, following a Tom Tom in the center of Marseille could take you across newly installed pedestrian areas or Tram lines. The one-way system has also completely changed.

===By taxi===
Be careful of rogue taxi drivers. While there aren't many, there are a few and a €20 ride can quickly become a €40 ride. If you think you've been cheated get the taxi driver's number (located in the rear of the car, often on the window) and go to the Tourist's Office at 4, La Canebière (near Le Vieux Port) and speak to a representative, they can and will get your money back if you've been ripped off. They will also get the taxi driver in significant trouble.

For more information about taxis in France, see the main [[France#By taxi|France]] article.

===By boat===
A Ferry Boat crosses the Old Harbour (Vieux Port). It is a tourist attraction in itself known as the shortest commercial boat ride in Europe. Several other ferries propose connexions with L'Estaque, Les Goudes, La Pointe-Rouge, and Le Frioul. They cost 5€ a return trip but a 1 week RTM transportation pass (13€) comprises them (except Frioul island) which is very interesting. Also, there are several companies proposing boat tours of the Calanques, like mini-cruises.

=== By bicycle ===
Marseille has the excellent Le vélo[http://www.levelo-mpm.fr/] bicycle hire scheme in place, but there are basically no cycle paths and the few that are there are usually filled with pedestrians or parked cars, which makes cycling in Marseille a rather dangerous affair. The vélo scheme costs 1 euro for a week's subscription. Each time you hire a bike, the first 30 minutes are free, then each hour costs 1 euro. Note that there is a 150 euro deposit which will be charged if you don't return the bike properly. Univélo Marseille is a mobile app that gives you live bike or park availability in the 100+ bike stations.

===Architecture and buildings===
* <see name="d'If Castle" alt="Château d'If" address="Island" directions="" lat="" long="" phone="" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">The castle was built on a small island off the city, initially as a defensive structure, and was later used as a prison. It is most famous for its place in the novel ''The Comte de Monte-Cristo'' by Alexandre Dumas. Tourist boats leave from the Vieux Port for a 15-minute ride. The boats do get full, especially on a weekend, so if you want to leave on a specific boat, you're advised to arrive an hour before the trip to buy the tickets (they are issued for a specific time). Then you can kill the time before the ride by visiting the nearby attractions; a Notre Dame church is around 15 minutes away by foot if you are good at walking uphill. Both the island and the castle are small, and everything there can be seen and photographed in 20 minutes. But due to the boat schedules you will spend at least an hour there until the boat picks you up, so don't rush. There are no shops there, so pack your lunch and drinks. A toilet is available. Both the castle and the island offer very limited access to wheelchair users. The entrance to the Castle costs 6 Euro. The whole exhibition is focused on the ''Count of Monte-Cristo'' novel, so unless you're a fan, plan your time differently.</see>
* <see name="Housing unit" alt="Unité d'Habitation" address="" directions="" lat="" long="" phone="" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">It was designed by Le Corbusier.

Panier means basket in French, but in Marseille, it is the name of the oldest area of the town. In the middle of this area, there is the Vieille Charité, a wonderful old monument, now hosting museums and exhibitions. This area is like a village of the Provence right in the city center. Lots of craftsmen, creators, handmade shops, and restaurants are in beautiful places. You can enjoy a beautiful walk there walking down the narrow streets with colored old buildings until the cathedral La Major and the new museum MuCEM.</see>

Football matches are one of the highlights of Marseille's life. Whilst L'OM have fallen on rather lean times the former champions of Europe are the biggest football team in France.

The best games involve teams with some traveling support such as St Etienne, Lens, or the grand-daddy match of them all against the evil Paris St Germain. Tickets can be bought (ideally several days before the game) either online or from the L'OM shop at the Vieux Port.

==Eat==
Unsurprisingly, Marseille's cuisine is focused on fish and seafood. Its two flag-bearing specialties are the famous fish broth '''bouillabaisse''' and '''aïoli''', a garlic sauce served with vegetables and dried cod.

La Bouillabaisse de Marseille is an excellent fish-based soup served with la rouille (a garlic-saffron sauce) and bread similar to crostini.  La bouillabaisse cannot be enjoyed at any budgetary level.  If you are invited to the home of someone making bouillabaisse, then you are in the clear.  Never eat cheap bouillabaisse at a resto unless it's not called bouillabaisse; only eat it out if you have to reserve in advance. Bouillabaisse is a meal. At first the soup, then the fish.

In recent years lots of new places have opened in Marseille, at night, three main districts are interesting (besides beaches between April and October where people go and spend the night - there are also nice bars - Sports Beach, Thursday beach parties at Le Petit Pavillon during summer, sunlight yacht club.
*'''Old Port''' with lots of bars and pubs (particularly on the southern side and on Cours d'Estienne d'Orves - Marengo, Polikarpov, Barberousse, Hard Rock Café)
*'''La Plaine/Cours Julien''' with numerous alternative and underground bars (E-wine, Bar du marché, Petit-Nice, Intermédiaire, Asile 404, Molotov)
*'''La Joliette/J4''' with trendy chic new bars and clubs (Palais de la Major, Casa Pietra, White Rabbit). 

However '''La Friche''' should not be forgotten, particularly during summer when the very large rooftop hosts DJ parties for free every Friday and Saturday.

===Budget===

The hostel is a rather impressive building, both inside and out, like a modern castle perched on a hill outside Marseille. They have spacious dorms, and the views are truly spectacular if you get the right room. There is a lovely staff, no curfew or lockouts, and as good a breakfast as you can expect from a hostel. You'll find clean, good bathrooms, lovely marble and mosaic floors, and quiet environs. The kitchen is lackluster and basic, but it does the job. The view comes at a cost as it is located well outside the city, about 40 minutes walking from the Vieux Port. There is transport from the center by bus lines 6 and 8, and by metro line 1/blue; you must get off at the last stop, La Fourragère, and walk about 10 minutes up a hill to reach it. They take new guests between 7-10 & 17-21 but can make arrangements if this doesn't suit you. Make sure you pay attention to the greeting instructions, as it is not a 24-hour staff, and you may find yourself waiting for a while.</sleep>

==Contact==
Le Vieux Port has WiFi access, available from many of the bars and restaurants, and in some places in the street (although there are not many places to sit). The ESSID to use is "Marseille sans fil" and the network is not encrypted. When you first connect, your browser will take you to a web page about the service in French: simply click on "Cliquez ici" ("Click here") on that page to use the network freely.  

Note WiFi is pronounced wee-fee or wiffy in French - even by English speakers. Asking for Why-Fye will usually be greeted by a blank look.

== Stay safe ==
In recent years muggings and pickpockets have dramatically decreased in the city center, however, avoid carrying valuables and watch your surroundings. Most of the northern neighborhoods (quartiers nord), except L'Estaque and Château-Gombert, might be risky and should be avoided by tourists and there is no logical reason for going there.

The area around Boulevard Michelet teems with prostitutes and should be avoided on soccer nights as you can meet potentially angry and drunk Olympique de Marseille hooligans.

When driving a car make sure the doors are locked. There have been occurrences of motorcyclists opening the doors of cars and quickly snatching bags and valuables from the seats.

Overall the city is fairly safe, as is Paris, so there is no need for paranoia!
