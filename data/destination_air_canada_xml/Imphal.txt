==Drink==
'''Visit local alcohol vendors'''- Although Manipur is a dry state ( alcohol not allowed to sale and drink), it seems that there is some relaxation to sale and drink the traditionally brewed rice based alcohols  in many Kabui/tribal localities (also called as Khuns). Atingba (rice beer) is lighter in alcohol content and and Ashaba (distilled rice brandy) is stronger in alcohol content. Some popular locations are Mujikhul, Kakhulong (in Paona bazar area), Keishamthong khul, Mahabali etc. These alcohol vendors also sell different types of meat dishes, fish and snacks which are very affordable. There will be plenty of young people sitting and enjoying the drinks alongwith some snacks and they will be quite open to talk. Drinking in these places is worth an experience and these alcohol vendors are very unique to Manipur

==Stay safe==
Imphal has been ranked 32 among 150 places which are most likely to have a terrorist attack. The rank is 1st in India with Kashmir trailing way behind somewhere around 42 in the world rank and 2nd in India, so one needs to be cautious not to get oneself into trouble.

During most of the time Imphal and its surroundings are relatively peaceful, but one needs to be extremely cautious during August 15th and January 26th of every year, for this is the time when the section of society which are against the merger of Manipur to India gets into several violent activities which includes planting IEDs and what not.

With the recent Attack on Chandel district in which 18 personnel of Dogra Regt.were killed, the situation is not so calm in the region.

If you are visiting the hill areas it is advisable to take the help of local people.
