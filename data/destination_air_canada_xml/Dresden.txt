[http://www.dresden.de/dwt/en/ '''Dresden'''] is the capital of the [[Germany|German]] federal state of [[Saxony]] (''Freistaat Sachsen''). Dresden is located on the Elbe River and is an industrial, governmental and cultural centre, known worldwide for Bruehl's Terrace and its historic landmarks in the Old Town (Altstadt).

==Understand==
[[image:Dresden-Semperoper.jpg|The '''Semper Opera'''.|thumb]]
Dresden became a city in 1206 and celebrated its 800th birthday in 2006. 

It was home to many Saxon princes and kings, the most famous of them being ''August der Starke'' (Augustus the Strong), whose kingdom included Poland as well. They appertained to the family of the Wettiner and were closely related to many other European royal families. Many buildings date from their reign. The rich art collections are testimony of their extreme wealth. The "Madonna Sixtina," for instance, was bought by the son of August the Strong.

The last Saxon king abdicated in 1918.

75% of the historical centre of Dresden was destroyed by Allied bombing in 1945. These events have left deep scars on the city and are still remembered each year with processions and ceremonies. More than 30,000 people died in the bombing - the exact number is unknown.

For many years the ruins and now the newly rebuilt Frauenkirche, with its gold cupola donated from the UK, acts as a call for peace among the different nations of the world.

The historical centre is nowadays largely restored to its former glory, however some parts are still under reconstruction. 

[[Image:Dresden Germany 2003.jpg|Dresden December 2003|thumb]]
Dresden has about ten million tourists a year, most of them from Germany. The Zwinger was rebuilt in 1964, the Semper Opera house in 1985, and the now most famous landmark of Dresden, the Frauenkirche, in 2005. When asked what they like most about their city, Dresden citizens will reply Old Town (which is quite compact, even though it has a lot of well-known attractions and museums of worldwide meaning), Dresden-Neustadt (an alternative central quarter) and the surroundings like the wine town [[Radebeul]], the climbing area [[Saxon Switzerland]], lots of castles, and most of the city landscape of about 80 quarters.
 
The level of international tourism is growing, especially from the US and China since Dresden is a stop between [[Prague]] and [[Berlin]]. Architecturally, Loschwitz is the most interesting living quarter, despite it being a hilly landscape.

Some people think that the sand stone buildings look black because of burnings or pollution. This is not true. Sandstone turns naturally dark as it ages. You can see the dark stones as well in the near by Saxon Switzerland and on pictures of Dresden from the 18th Century, where the sandstone-buildings are black as well. 

Dresden lies in the former German Democratic Republic and the GDR architecture is still easily visible in the city. In the city center The "Prager Straße" and the "Kulturpalast" are examples for classical GDR architecture. If you leave the center you will find a lot of apartment blocks, called "Plattenbau" as they are typical in Eastern Europe and Russia.
Traces of World War II are not visible in the city anymore.

==Get in==

===By plane===
[http://www.dresden.aero '''Dresden-Klotzsche Airport'''] is located north of the city and can be reached by bus (line 77 and 97) and tram line 7 (change for the bus at tram station ''Infineon Nord''). Even faster is the connection with local train lines (''S-Bahn'', line S2) which takes 21 minutes to reach the main station.

Flights leave to nearly all important German cities and a few European destinations, like [[London]], [[Moscow]] and [[Zurich]]. The emergence of low-frills airlines has led to reduced fares to [[Cologne]], [[Düsseldorf]] and [[Stuttgart]]. [http://www.lufthansa.com ''Lufthansa''] operates to most domestic destinations.

===By train===
Dresden is served by two big train stations, one on the northern side of the Elbe, '''Dresden Neustadt''', and one on the southern side of the Elbe, '''Dresden Hauptbahnhof''' or "main railway station".  Be sure to check if your train is really leaving/going to Dresden Hauptbahnhof or to Dresden Neustadt.

The ''Dresden Hauptbahnhof'' is situated at the southern end of Dresden's main shopping street, Prager Straße, and is a short walking distance from most central attractions in Old Town. It is very well connected with the local bus and tram network and can be reached very quickly from nearly everywhere, even at night time. Trains to nearby towns, such as [[Meissen]] and [[Pirna]] run until around midnight.  Trains regularly depart the main train station for the rest of Germany (Berlin, Frankfurt, Munich) and to Prague, Budapest and Wroclaw.

The other big train station called ''Dresden-Neustadt'' is located just north of the New Town and also offers very good train connections, as most trains run through there, too. Some trains even terminate there and not at the main train station. Dresden-Neustadt is also easily accessible by tram or car.

===By car===
Dresden can be reached without problems by car from the rest of Germany. It is well connected with the German highway system and a new Autobahn to [[Prague]] has been finished recently.

===By Bus===
[https://www.flixbus.com/ '''Flixbus'''] has connections from all over Europe that can connect to Dresden.

[http://https://www.eurolines.com/ '''Eurolines'''] especially connects Dresden from South and Eastern European Countries. But also connections between Germany, Austria and Switzerland are available.

==Get around==

===On foot===
In the centre, especially in the historic part in Old Town (Altstadt), everything is easily accessible by foot. Note that the city center is not the geographical centre of the city.

===By bus and tram===
There is a combined system of trams (''Straßenbahn''), buses and even trains, but no underground trains. It works very well and connects all points of interest, but can be a little busy at peak times. Most lines run at night but at reduced capacity. This allows you to go out to most places or restaurants without bringing a car, including to far flung places like [[Pillnitz]]. See [http://www.dvb.de/en/Homepage/ Dresdner Verkehrsbetriebe (DVB) website].

Best is to get yourself a Day Ticket (€6.00) or, for families, a Family Day Ticket (€8.50). It allows you to ride on all trams, buses, most ferries and trains (except InterCitys and ICEs). It is relatively cheap and valid until the next day at 04:00. You can also get a ticket limited to an hour and some others, but Day Tickets are recommended for flexible travel in and around the city.

As with most places in Germany, the public transit operates on the honour system: you are assumed to have a ticket, and there are a few inspectors out spot checking.  The exception is on the buses after 20:00, when the drivers are required to see all tickets.

===By car===
The street network is very good and many roads have been refurbished recently, especially in the city centre. As in all bigger towns it can be a bit crowded during rush hours. There are many parking lots in downtown Dresden and it should not be a problem to find a place to park, except on Saturday shopping days. A number of automatic signs have been created, indicating the number of available parking spaces within the parking lots. Shops are open c. 10:00-20:00 and you will see a lot of tourists and locals going shopping in the city centre. Please beware of them when driving and note that this is the time with the fewest available parking spots. Car drivers might seem to be a little more aggressive than in other countries, but are usually more friendly if you don't have a local registration number.

===By bicycle===
Bikes are the fastest thing in rush hour traffic if going a short to medium distance and if you're in good condition and not afraid of traffic and pedestrians. Bikes are also good for longer distances as they can be carried (with a separate ticket) in trams. There are many designated cycle paths (marked red on pavements, or with a white bike symbol on a blue background) and it is most times very easy to find a place to park your bike. But as anywhere else, always use a good lock!

Many of the older streets of Dresden (particularly in the northern, Neustadt area) still have a cobblestone surface:  not the most comfortable riding surface!  Also, cobblestone is relatively slippery, compared to asphalt or concrete:  care should be taken when riding in wet conditions.

===Alternative transport===
Dresden has a lot of [http://www.rikschataxi-dresden.de/eng/ pedicabs (bike taxis)], mostly operating around the Old Town. They offer the typical (short distance) taxi service as well as guided city tours. Since 2007 there are also horse carriages that offer tourist sightseeing.

One can also make use of the many bus tour operators. Tickets for these tours can be bought around the old town from various points.

*[http://www.saechsische-dampfschiffahrt.de  '''Paddle-Steamer Tour'''].  Best start your tour from the main pier at the castle and go down to [[Meissen]] or up to [[Pillnitz]] or the [[Saxon Switzerland]].

* '''Semper Opera''' - Be sure to book in advance.

* '''Villas and Villages''' - stroll arround through the many villa neighbourhoods like Blasewitz, Loschwitz, Kleinzschachwitz or Radeberger Vorstadt. They often have an village-style centre, eg: Strehlen very near to Großer Garden.

===Festivals & Events===
Dresden is host to a number of worldwide known events, often unique or the biggest of their kind:

[[Image:Dresden_BRN2009.jpg|thumb|A concert in front of a bar during BRN 2009.]]
* '''Bunte Republik Neustadt (BRN)''' ('Colourful Republic Neustadt') - a massive yearly street festival that consumes the Neustadt part of Dresden in June. The festival consists of many stages featuring local musicians of different styles. The festivities run very late into the night with plenty booths offering a wide variety of food and drink. If you plan to sleep, then it is advisable to book accommodations outside of the Neustadt area during BRN.

* '''Dixieland Festival''' [http://www.dixieland.de/] - Europe's ''biggest Jazz Festival.'' It normally takes place within the second week of May (from May 10-14 in 2006) and attracts bands and visitors from all over Europe, America and the world.  A great deal of the music is played on the top decks of paddle boats in front of the Old Stadt.

*'''''Filmnächte''''' (Film nights)  (Jun-Aug) - on the banks of the Elbe, just across the castle on the other side of the river. A huge movie screen offers cinema in a beautiful setting and there are also many concerts with popular stars. Again, it is the ''biggest event of its kind'' in Europe!

* '''Christmas Markets''' - The Christmas markets lighten up an otherwise gloomy winter in Dresden. Starting on the weekend of the first Advent, the Christmas markets are open every day until Christmas.  During this period, many Christmas markets open up throughout the whole city. Striezelmarkt, located at Altmarkt in Altstadt, is Germany's ''oldest Christmas market'' and is the largest in Dresden. Be sure to check out the booths offering various trinkets, including the famous wood figures (Räuchermännchen) made in the nearby Erzgebirge. Warm up with delicious mulled wine from the ''Glühwein Buden''. But this market is crowded with tourist and the things they sell there are "0815" (boring) things.

==Buy==
[[Image:Dresdenshoppingarea.jpg|thumb|Shop in the main shopping area, downtown Dresden.]]

The main shopping district in Dresden extends from Ferdinandplatz to the west of Sankt-Petersburger Straße northwest to about Wilsdruffer Straße (search for Altmarkt).  At the south end (Ferdinandplatz) is a cinema, a couple of restaurants, and a huge Karstadt department store (which also sells groceries). On the north end is a covered mall.

In the Äußere Neustadt area (north/east of Albertplatz), many small shops provide books, vinyl records and clothing.

The Innere Neustadt (between Albertplatz and Elbe, mainly Haupstraße and Königstraße) is rather on a medium-to-fancy level.

==Eat==
Within the historic centre and especially around the Frauenkirche are a number of restaurants, serving many different tastes.  Be aware, most of these are overpriced, and the quality is often low.  On the north bank of the Elbe River is the Neustadt, which accounts for most of the trendy pubs, bars and clubs, and the majority of the restaurants in the city.  You will generally have better luck finding decent food for a reasonable price north of Albertplatz in Neustadt.

The eastern part of the city, toward the Blaues Wunder, has a lower density of restaurants than Neustadt, and they tend to also serve as cafés, and the food is generally tasteful and cheap.  

When in Germany make sure to try a speciality that is not regarded particularly as ''German'' at first sight. Today, '''doner kebab''' is typically served as a kind of sandwich in pita (flat bread). This type of doner kebab has been available in Istanbul since about 1960. The doner kebab with salad and sauce served in pita, which is predominant in Germany and the rest of the world, was invented in Berlin [[Kreuzberg]] in the early 1970s, because the original preparation was not appealing enough to the German taste. Therefore, as the "modern" kebab is very dissimilar to the traditional dish except by name, it can be argued that the kebab as most people know it is a "traditional" German dish.
When in Dresden you can probably get the best kebabs at '''Babos''' [http://www.babos-dresden.de/] and at '''Dürum Kebap Haus''' [http://www.durum-kebab-haus.de] (Rothenburger Straße 41 or Prager-Straße 32). A typical dish including a large drink should be around €5-6.

The next step above doner kebab is generally Italian.  There are a certain number of ethnic restaurants scattered through the city, and if you go out to the eastern part of town, you will find lots of charming cafés and Volkshäuser that serve good food.
