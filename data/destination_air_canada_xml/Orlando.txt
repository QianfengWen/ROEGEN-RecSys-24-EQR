{{pagebanner|Orlando Banner.jpg}}

'''Orlando''' is a large city in [[Orange County (Florida)|Orange County]], [[Florida]]. 

Orlando, for most people, conjures up the image of theme parks, mainly [[Walt Disney World]], but there is a lot more, in fact, Disney World is not in Orlando, but is in nearby [[Lake Buena Vista]]. With the estimated 52 million tourists a year, Orlando and many other areas in the region developed a lot to offer a traveler who wants to see something other than a theme park.

Other cities in the metropolitan area include [[Altamonte Springs]], [[Davenport (Florida)|Davenport]], [[Kissimmee]], and [[Winter Park (Florida)|Winter Park]].

==Understand==
When people think of Orlando, most think of theme parks and a vast urban sprawl. However, the city proper contains only Universal Studios. None of the other major theme parks (Disney World, Sea World), dinner attractions (such as Medieval Times), and most small theme parks (Gatorland, Holyland Experience, Ripley's Believe-it-or-not, etc) are in other cities or counties. However, since Orlando is the larger city associated with most of these popular attractions, you will find details and descriptions of them below.

===Climate===
Most tourists visit Orlando between June and August, while another peak time for tourism is March and April. Ironically, the less busy times for tourism correspond to the best weather in the Orlando area; the summer months can be exceptionally busy with families who are making a trip while kids are on summer vacation. Visiting when the weather isn't so hot means less people in the area and that provides some advantages, but you will be able to enjoy cooler weather. The climate of Orlando is subtropical, and therefore is very humid (the heat index typically exceeds 100 degrees). Afternoon thunderstorms are expected in the warmer months, although they can occur in any month.

Many say central Florida has two seasons: hot and hotter. Orlando has warm, balmy springs and autumns; hot summers complete with daily thunderstorms; and temperate winters affected by the occasional cold front. That being said:

*'''Spring''' in Orlando has highs in the 80s (27°C) in March & April transitioning to around 90°F (32°C) in May and low-mid 90s in June. Spring is the driest time of year here, and in the past decade some spring months have seen less than a half-inch of rain! This is the time of year in which many small wildfires appear around the region, but this should not bother anyone who stays within the urban area. March and April are great times to visit with dry days, clear skies, and warm temperatures (and no cold fronts). However, late May and early June are arguably the worst time to visit filled with hot, humid, dry days.

{{infobox|Florida Cold & Snow|While most think of Florida as a year-round paradise, many would be surprised to learn that there are at least ten clear winter mornings a year when lows fall to near freezing. Even on the coldest of mornings, highs will soon reach into the 50s and 60s! Nevertheless, every 3-4 years, snow flurries will mix with rain somewhere in the region, the most recent being 3 January, 2008. However, only once since records began in 1948 has any measurable snow fallen at the airport (0.2" in/0.5 cm Jan 1977). So if you visit between November and March, bring a jacket...it may be warmer than northern states, but not as warm as you may think it will be! }}

*'''Summer''' begins with the start of daily thunderstorms around mid-June. Highs from mid-June to mid-September are in the mid 90s, with 90ºF (32°C) often being reached by 10-11AM, and lows in the 70s (23°C). Due to Orlando's proximity to two coasts, thunderstorms form everyday during this period from ocean breezes which heat over land, rise, and cool in the atmosphere to create sometimes violent thunderstorms (see the "Stay Safe" section). However, they often will drop temperatures into the low 80s (28°C) after passing...a welcome relief from the hot temperatures earlier in the year.

*'''Autumn''' varies much more from year to year than spring. The daily thunderstorms taper off in September leaving highs in the mid-high 80s (29°C) until mid-October. The first cold front of the season will usually pass between mid and late October, plunging highs into the 70s (24°C) and lows into the 50s (12°C) and high 40s (10°C). The cooling trend continues into November and December, with highs falling into the 70s (24°C) by late December and lows into the 50s (12°C), affected only by the occasional cold front which can plunge highs into the 60s (18°C)(Nov) and 50s (12°C)(Dec) and lows into the 40s (7°C)(Nov) and as low as freezing (32ºF/0ºC) by mid December.

*'''Winter''' is much the same as November and December. Highs are in the 70s (24°C), lows in the 50s (12°C), affected every week or two by cold fronts. Following a cold front, highs can drop into the 50s (12°C), lows into the 30s (2°C).

===By plane===


'''Orlando International Airport''' ({{IATA|MCO}}, [http://www.orlandoairports.net/]) is the city's primary airport, and the busiest airport in the state in terms of passenger traffic. The airport is to the southeast of downtown but is central with respect to the region and area attractions. Orlando International Airport is a secondary hub for Southwest Airlines & JetBlue Airways, all of which fly numerous routes to/from Orlando. Furthermore, Delta Air Lines offers 10-15 flights daily between Orlando and their super-hub in [[Atlanta]] and American Airlines has 9 flights a day to their Miami hub. Non-stop service is offered to nearly every major city east of the Mississippi and to several major western cities (LA, San Francisco, Seattle, Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City, & Denver). Non stop service to Honolulu was also added recently on Hawaiian Airlines.

Daily flights to Europe are offered by Virgin Atlantic (London-Gatwick & Manchester), British Airways (London-Gatwick), & Lufthansa (Frankfurt). Multiple flights per week are flown to Dublin (Aer Lingus), , Glasgow (Virgin Atlantic, seasonally), & Zurich (Swiss Int./Edelweiss Air). To South America, there are daily flights to Sao Paulo, Brazil (TAM) & Bogotá, Colombia (Jet Blue) and seasonal service to Santiago, Chile (LAN). Over a dozen Canadian destinations are served non-stop, many seasonally (Toronto & Montreal are served daily year-round). Other international destinations served from Orlando include: Jamaica (Montego Bay), the Dominican Republic (Santo Domingo), the Bahamas (Nassau), Mexico (Cancun, Mexico City), Panama (Panama City), Costa Rica (San José), & El Salvador (San Salvador). In addition flights to the Middle East operated by Emirates to Dubai and El Al to Tel Aviv have begun recently, with Turkish airlines flights to Istanbul set to begin soon as well.

[[Image:Hotel inside the Orlando International Airport.jpg|230px|thumb|right| Full sized Hotel, with all amenities and services, directly within Orlando International Airport itself.]] 

Orlando International is structured into two components, landside and airside. There is a central landside terminal (A and B), containing airline counters, baggage claim, rental agencies, numerous shops, and a hotel. This central terminal is connected via trams to four other terminals, known as Airside 1-4, with the airplane gates. There are plenty of shops and restaurants in both the central terminal and the airsides. 

Security screening is performed in the central landside terminal before taking the tram to the airsides and, as in all U.S. airports, only ticketed passengers are allowed past security. Security lines can become extremely long (1 hr), especially during the summer tourist season and near holidays. Combined with long check-in lines, it is advisable to arrive 2-3 hours before your scheduled departure. 

Almost every medium to high priced hotel in the city offers transfers. Orlando is the rental car capital of the world and as such there are several car rental agencies offering a wide range of vehicles for rental. 

There are several '''Shuttle and Town Car services''' options that run from the airport to various points, including Kissimmee, theme parks, University of Central Florida, and the cruise port at [[Cape Canaveral|Port Canaveral]]. Shuttle services are a cheap alternative to taxis, and operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Approximate rates [http://www.orlandoairports.net/transport/local_transport.htm] for shuttles ranges from $9.99-26 depending on your destination. 

'''Mears Transportation''', +1 407-423-5566 provides shuttle service from Orlando International to many hotels in and around the region, including those in the Disney area that are not served by Magical Express.

A secondary airport which serves the Orlando area is the Orlando-Sanford International Airport ({{IATA|SFB}}, [http://www.orlandosanfordairport.com/]) in [[Sanford (Florida)|Sanford]], a city just to the north of Orlando, the side of Orlando opposite most attractions. Service between Orlando Sanford International and Europe includes: Thomson Airways (Birmingham, London-Gatwick, Manchester; seasonally to Bristol, Edinburgh, Glasgow, & Newcastle upon Tyne); Arkefly (Amsterdam); and Icelandair (Reykjavik, seasonal). Orlando Sanford International is also a hub for Allegiant Air which serves a lot of small U.S. cities.

In addition, Orlando area visitors who plan on visiting the Gulf Coast may consider flying into [[Tampa#By plane|Tampa International Airport]], about 80 mi (130 km) west of Orlando or just over an hour's drive, as it is less crowded and a bit easier to access via road.

If you plan on visiting more than just Orlando and plan on taking international flights, you may want to consider flying via [[Miami#By plane|Miami International Airport]], a 200 mi (320 km) and a 3-4 hour drive south of Orlando, which offers more international flights and is the largest US gateway for flights to South/Central America and the Caribbean.

====General aviation====

All persons flying via general aviation should consider arriving via Orlando Executive Airport, 3 mi east of downtown and about 10 or so miles (16km) north of Orlando International Airport. Orlando Executive serves general aviation (95%) and air taxi (5%) exclusively. Additionally, Orlando Sanford International serves general aviation alongside its commercial use.

Orlando Executive Airport provides 24 h service through two fixed based operators, SheltAir Aviation Services and Showalter Flying Services. Air taxi and air charter companies such as '''Jetset Charter''' [http://www.jscharter.com], '''Velox Air Charter''' [https://www.veloxaircharter.com],
'''Monarch Air Group''' [http://monarchairgroup.com], '''Mercury Jets''' [http://www.mercuryjets.com] fly a variety of private charter aircraft and jets, from charter luxury Gulfstream's down to economical piston twins for small groups and individuals. 

Brokers such as '''Orlando Jet Charter''' [http://www.orlandojetcharter.com] and '''Stratos Jets''' [https://www.stratosjets.com] can arrange private flights to any of Orlando's local airports, including '''Kissimmee Gateway Airport''' ({{IATA|ISM}}, [http://www.kissimmee.org/government/kissimmee-gateway-airport]), with access to a wide range of private planes for charter around the world.

===By train===

Orlando has an '''Amtrak''' [http://www.amtrak.com/] station that provides service to other destinations such as [[Miami]], but also connects to other points as far north as [[New York City|New York]] via the Silver Star and Silver Meteor lines. 

In nearby Sanford, the southern terminus of the '''Amtrak Auto Train''' which carries passengers and automobiles between Sanford and Lorton, [[Virginia]], effectively serving as a car-rail link from Orlando to the [[Washington, D.C.]] Metro Area.

In addition, the new '''SunRail''' [http://www.sunrail.com/] system services Downtown Orlando via four stations: Florida Health Village, Lynx Central, Church Street, and Orlando Health/Amtrak.

===By bus===

<p>'''ATC Buses''', 14119 Lord Barclay Dr, Orlando [http://www.atcbuses.com]. Offers bus charter transportation to and from the Orlando Airport to Port Canaveral Cruises and hotels in the Orlando-Sanford area.</p>

===By Car===

Driving to Orlando should be considered as a real and viable possibility for anyone with the geographic means. All Orlando attractions, including most major resorts and hotels are off Interstate 4 which connects to Interstate 95, running from Maine to Florida. Five minutes off of a choice of exits, depending on your destination, takes you anywhere you need to go. This can prove to be the most economical for your trip, as well as the most convenient.

==Get around==

===By car===

The car is omnipresent in Orlando and is a very easy and convenient (if congested) way to get to your destination. Orlando is a sprawling city with most attractions lying far to the south of downtown and into adjacent cities like Kissimmee and Lake Buena Vista (this section includes those areas). The roads are all wide and easy to drive on with all major attractions well signed, but traffic jams around downtown are common in the afternoons, and around the touristy areas on Friday nights and all day Saturday. Orlando ranks 8th in the nation in terms of traffic congestion, and there are numerous ongoing construction projects on area expressways (all aimed at alleviating this, but only causing congestion in the meanwhile). Traffic information is available from new Dynamic Message Signs, most local radio stations, and also by calling 511 (a free, automated service which provides current traffic info collected from hundreds of traffic cameras as well as police reports.)

The main highway through Orlando, and the only interstate serving it, is Interstate 4 (runs NE-SW). In recent years, major construction on it has widened it through areas south of SR528 making it a commuter-friendly highway (except for traffic during rush hours and Friday and Saturday evenings). Downtown Orlando; International Dr; Amway Arena; the Mall at Millenia; and theme parks such as Walt Disney World, Universal Studios, Sea World, Discovery Cove, the Holy Land Experience, and Wet n' Wild are all along or near I-4.

Aggressive drivers are abundant in the Greater Orlando area not only on major highways but also on surface streets in the downtown district. Speed limits are for the most part ignored in and around the city, even though on I-4 the speed limit is only 50 mph (80 km/h) in the downtown area and ranges between 55 and 65 mph (90-105 km/h) near the attractions, it is not uncommon to be tailgated if you travel less than 80 mph (129 km/h) in the left lane. If you are unfamiliar with the area, it is much easier and safer to drive in the far right lane, as road signs will direct. 

{{cautionbox|boldtext=Caution|Started in the early 2000s, open road tolling is used along Orlando's toll roads. A driver with a Sun Pass or E-Pass transponder and a prepaid account continues straight along the road at the speed limit, with the toll accounted for electronically; drivers paying cash (almost all tourists) must follow signage that diverts them to toll booths constructed off the right of the highway. Drivers who do not have transponders and continue going straight past the toll booth are photographed and ticketed.
Most rental car companies are set up to allow drivers to use the electronic toll lanes. Ask your specific company for details as fees and procedures vary.}}

Other major highways include toll road SR-528, the Beach Line Expressway although known until recently as the Bee Line, which runs east from I-4 (exit 72) towards the Space Coast beaches and Kennedy Space Center, [[Cocoa Beach]], and Port Canaveral. SR-528 is, like all Orlando area expressways ('''not''' including I-4), a toll road. While tolls are modest for short trips within Orlando, tolls can quickly add on long cross-town trips (bypassing Orlando on SR-417 is $7.27 for 55 mi/89 km. If you're driving from the Disney area to Sanford, FL between 4PM and 6PM, paying the toll is good if you're in a hurry, because it could take you up to 2 hours going on I-4). SR-417 starts at I-4 just west of SR-192/Disney World. It takes you north, passing both the Orlando International Airport and the Orlando-Sanford International Airport. It ends at I-4 in Sanford, FL. SR-408 starts at SR-50 on the East side of Orlando, by the University of Central Florida and takes you past the west side of Orlando to the city of Ocoee, FL. It ends at the Florida Turnpike. SR-429 starts in Apopka, FL at SR-441 and takes you past the Florida Turnpike and Disney World. It ends at I-4, just west of SR-192/Disney World. The Florida Turnpike starts in Miami, FL at I-95 and takes you north through Orlando and ends in Wildwood, FL at I-75. See this convenient toll calculator online: [https://www.cfxway.com/for-travelers/#calculator].

In Orlando, the main tourism area is International Drive, a strip of road that runs parallel to I-4 for about 10 miles (16 km). Many tourist-focused shops, restaurants, and attractions are to be found along this road; therefore, it is excruciatingly hard to drive on and find parking along this road on weekends, especially in the summer, and excursions to this area are best by bus during such times. Other major roads include: US 192 in Kissimmee (fronted by thousands of small shops and attractions), Orange Blossom Trail (US 92/441...a North-South alternative to I-4), SR-50 (E-W route towards the CBD).

====Gasoline====

There are a few gas stations that '''prey on unsuspecting travelers''' returning rental cars to the airport. This includes Suncoast Energys and Sun Gas on Semoran Blvd. near the airport entrance. Prices at these stations are often more than '''$2 per gallon above''' typical market price. '''Look before you pump!''' The prices are not posted except on the pump. Plan ahead to have enough time before your flight to drive an extra mile or so up Semoran to the cheaper stations. There also are stations around Disney World that have similar practices.

===By rental car===

Orlando is the largest rental car market in the world and is known as capital of car rental companies, with all major car rental companies accessible. Operating directly within the airport are Alamo, Avis, Budget, Dollar, Enterprise, E-Z Rent-A-Car, L & M Car Rental, National, and Thrifty; courtesy shuttles are available for transport to other rental companies.

There are also several car rental companies off the Airport in Orlando which you can normally get a better car rental price. Most of these companies are local companies and [http://www.sixt.com Sixt]. 
If you arrive by air via Orlando International Airport and pick up a rental car there, you can go through the north exit and head to SR-528 West to get to International Dr, Universal Orlando and SeaWorld. This will require $1.75 in tolls. Alternatively, you can take a direct route to Walt Disney World through the south exit to SR-417 South, following it to Exit 5, and taking SR 536 straight into Disney. This requires $2 in tolls. Toll booths along this expressway uses open road tolling: see note above in box.

If you're feeling like you would like to rent a more higher end vehicle there is a variety of exotic car rentals around that can either deliver you a vehicle from their exotic car rental company, most of them are in Miami but they sometimes have deals in which the cars were rented out near by and you can pick those cars up without a delivery fee, or sometimes a bit cheaper then having a car delivered from Miami to meet you at the airport.

===By bus===

<p>Orlando's public transportation is the LYNX bus service. Approximately 60 routes serve the metro Orlando area and costs $2 per ride (transfers included) except for the free Lymmo bus service downtown. </p>

<p>*'''Lymmo Bus''', 1-407-841-LYNX. This free service operates frequently in a circuit in downtown, from City Hall to the Centroplex and back. The Lymmo has a dedicated lane and stations with streetcar type control signals and modified buses that allow passengers to enter the bus without climbing. M-Th 6AM-10PM, F 6AM-midnight, Sa 10AM-midnight, Su 10AM-10PM.</p>

<p>LYNX buses of interest to visitors include routes 8, 21, 37, 38, 40, 42, 50, and 111 -- e.g., bus 8, 38, or 42 for International Dr, bus 21, 37, or 40 for Universal, bus 8, or 38 for SeaWorld, bus 50 for Disney, and bus 37, 42, or 111 for Florida Mall and/or Orlando International Airport. Seven-day standard passes are $16. Check out GO LYNX [http://www.golynx.com/]to plan your trips.</p>

===By trolley===

<p>*'''I-Ride Trolley''', +1 407-248-9590, [http://www.iridetrolley.com/]. Along International Dr and Universal Blvd, this trolley primarily serves tourists in the attractions area, operating daily from 8am to 10:30pm. While the service is advertised as a trolley, the trolleys are in fact modified buses traveling in traffic with many stops, which makes for a slow ride. There are 85 stops along the main (Red) route on International Dr and 22 stops on the (Green) route that serves less congested Universal Blvd. The fare is $1.25 per ride for adults, 25¢ for seniors, and free to kids younger than 12; exact change is required. There's an unlimited 1-day pass available for $4 per person. One-day and multi-day passes, not sold on the bus, are available in many locations. However, because of the very limited route coverage of I-Ride –- it goes nowhere near Disney -- the better choice for many visitors is to use LYNX buses (e.g., bus 8, 21, 37, 38, 40, 42, 50, or 111).</p>

===By taxi===

Orlando is visited by millions of tourists each year and there are dozens of taxi companies that are operational in the region. It will not be a problem to find transportation from The Orlando Airport to your hotel or from the hotel to a theme park, restaurant or mall. If you are not planning to rent a car, you probably should do some research and arrange your own transportation before arriving to Orlando. A full list of companies permitted by the City of Orlando and the Aviation Authority can be found on the website of the Orlando International Airport. Most popular taxi companies:

It is advisable to never hail a taxi off the street. Unfortunately some of those companies do not have any license or insurance and operating illegally. These taxi services, although questionable in practice, can be quite convenient. They are generally available at all times of the night to safely transport 'party-goers’, or those who take advantage of the lively night scene.

===By Shuttle===
There are various shuttles available in and around Orlando. Florida Shuttle Services, Orlando Airport Van, Mears Transportation, and Supershuttle, among others, provide service 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Rates vary by location and start as low as $49.99. Many travelers find shuttles faster and cheaper alternative to their more luxurious counterparts (i.e., taxis, private cars/sedans, etc.). A full list of companies permitted by the City of Orlando and the Aviation Authority you can find on [http://www.orlandoairports.net/transport/vfh.htm Orlando International Airport website].

Keep in mind, you get what you pay for and may of those shared companies have one star and a poor reputation for good reasons. Look at more reliable companies when you shop around:
'''Florida Shuttle Luxury Services''' provides group shuttle service from Orlando MCO airport to many different locations with an Orlando-Miami bus. Rates vary depending on the passenger's destination. 

Based on our current knowledge, we hope you make the best decision to fit you.

===By Train===

SunRail offers service every 30 minutes during rush hours, and 1-2 hours in the midday and evenings [http://sunrail.com/ between DeBary and Poinciana], serving Kissimmee, Winter Park, and of course, Downtown Orlando. Saturday service is available during certain major events. The bus system is generally more efficient for reaching most places throughout Orlando.

The '''Go Orlando Card''' [http://goorlandocard.com] is very useful, and can save significant amounts of money. However, there is so much to do in Orlando that planning a trip itself can become stressful. To alleviate much of this stress, there are ticket packages available for multiple parks, and can not only help plan a trip but save significantly on admission costs. The Orlando FlexTicket [http://theotherorlando.com/contents/chapters/1/flex.html] offers a few different package options that could be critical to your stay.

Although the FlexTicket does not cover any Disney Theme Parks, purchasing these in advance is also not only cost-effective, but can ensure you get everything out of your trip that you are looking for. Using Disney's Website directly [http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/disney-tickets/] allows you to personalize your own vacation. Using the Park Hopper option allows maximum exposure to all Disney Parks.

==Drink==
[[Image:Margaritaville.jpg|200px|thumb|Margaritaville.]] 

Orlando nightlife away from the theme parks is centered mostly around '''Central Boulevard''' and '''Orange Avenue''' in downtown Orlando. Here you can walk and find many bars. A short walk away is the tiny '''Thornton Park District''', near the intersection of Washington and Summerlin. Among the dozens of cafes and pubs, you might stop in for a drink and a quick bite at '''Dexter's''' on Washington. For local flair head across the street to '''Burton's Frosty Mug''', or sample the hip urban environment at the trendy '''HUE''' at the corner of Washington and Central.

Although most of the downtown Central avenue crowd is comprised of the "twentysomething" generation, for a more 30's and over entertainment experience, one can enjoy live jazz on many nights in the lounge of the '''Grand Bohemian Hotel''', downtown on Orange Avenue. The jazz is excellent and the ambiance is quite comfortable, although drinks tend to be pretty pricey here. 

'''Milk District''' is a colorful zone about two miles east of Downtown. This area is very bohemian with tons of nightlife, and a teahouse that is 24 hours thursday-sunday.

'''Winter Park''' has a more sophisticated nightlife scene centered around Park Avenue, with some students mixed in from prestigious Rollins College down the street. There's also a "food truck stop" that's open 24/7, and Austin's Coffee which is a 24/7 coffeehouse a bit west of the central area.

Also, for a more professional crowd with a Latin twist, there is the '''Samba Room''', on Sand Lake Road, about 3/4 west of I-4. This is a lively restaurant and happy hour type of place. The look is chic and the locals and tourists alike gather here for a quality food, beverage and people watching experience. You should ditch the shorts and flip-flops for a more casual chic look, but if you do you will be rewarded with a nice experience here. If you are traveling west on Sand Lake Road, after passing I-4, The Samba Room is on the left in a large shopping plaza. Latin food, music and mojitos are just some of the specialties here.

Across the street from the Samba Room, on Sand Lake Road, is the '''Old Vines wine bar''', featuring live jazz usually from Thurs. through Saturday nights. The wine selection is extensive and the live jazz is some of the best in town. The jazz is performed in the front of the room by the entrance. There is a divider that separates the more intimate rear portion of the establishment, which is the main dining area. 

There are quite a few places to enjoy quality dining and drinks along Park Avenue in Winter Park, an adjacent suburb which is just northeast of Orlando. Winter Park is known for its many older grande homes that dominate the more historic sections of this suburb affectionately referred to by many as the center of Orlando's "old money." Park Avenue is an active pedestrian street featuring trendy shoppes, galleries, restaurants and nightspots. It has recently grown from becoming a one street attraction to more of a district, as several nearby streets have now added similar attractions. 

Of particular interest and uniqueness on Park Avenue is the '''Wine Room''', a converted bank featuring literally hundreds of wines available for self serve sampling. The mode of purchasing here is to pre-load a wine "credit card" supplied by the Wine Room. You are then at liberty to peruse the entire building and select any wine you wish to try, merely by inserting your "credit card." Each wine station automatically deducts the value of your current purchase and advises you of your card balance. Dress is very casual here and you are likely to meet both locals and visitors, all sampling and enjoying their vinos of choice throughout the night.

At the theme parks, '''CityWalk''' at Universal Studios. For a nominal admission fee, both sites offer numerous venues for libations and entertainment. If you're staying along International Dr, there are plenty of bars, pubs, and clubs.

*'''Corona Cigar Company's Superstore & Cigar Bar''', 7792 West Sand Lake Rd, +1 407 248-1212, [http://www.coronacigar.com/]. If you're interested in cigars and all the different kinds of cigars, then this place is for you. The Corona Cigar Company allows its customers to sample different cigars. They also serve drinks.
*'''Bliss Hookah Lounge and Bar''', 4775 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy, Kissimmee, FL 34746, +1 321 337-1460, [https://blisshookahlounge.com/]. Bliss cafe and Hookah Lounge is the hot spot for fine flavorable Hookah (So many brands and hookah flavors to choose from) freshly made hummus, and the finest drinks and cocktails With great live music.
*'''Howl At The Moon''', 8815 International Dr, +1 407 354-5999, [http://www.howlatthemoon.com/]. Entertainers perform songs at request all night. A place where people can go to listen to music, dance, drink, and have fun.

With a hotel around virtually every corner (actually 4 or 5 around every corner) it seems impossible to throw a rock and not hit a hotel. There are hotels to meet every traveler's need, whether it be a hostel or a 5-star resort, although many visiting families often prefer to rent their own private villa as they usually provide much more personal space and have their own private facilities. There are also a large number of lodgings in the surrounding cities and towns.

==Stay safe==
{{infobox|Extreme Temperatures|''Never leave children, pets, or the elderly in a parked car for any length of time!'' Due to high temperature for most of the year, the interior of a parked car can easily heat to '''lethal''' temperatures in a short amount of time. During the summer, the interior of a parked car can reach 130-170ºF (55-75ºC) in just 15 minutes, regardless of the color of the exterior or interior, or whether the windows are open a small amount. You not only risk death, but '''it is illegal and the consequences are taken VERY seriously,''' including  fines and even imprisonment.}}

There are certain areas of Orlando which are more dangerous than others. Some areas travelers should be cautious of are:
*''Parramore District'', area in downtown Orlando is a location where a lot of the area's homeless population congregates and crime rates are higher in this area. 
*''Orange Blossom Trail'', south of Sand Lake Road is known to be a a bit of an unofficial red light district. Drug and prostitution related crime is common here. Prostitution is not legal in Orlando, so you could spend a night in jail if you decide to indulge.
*''Pine Hills'', around Silver Star Road and Pine Hills Road west of John Young Parkway. This is a lower income area that has struggled with high crime rates. The Greyhound bus station is in Pine Hills and is a place to use caution.

While it is unlikely that individual would experience serious crime in these areas, tourists stand out in these areas, and can unwittingly do things that can make them targets for criminal behavior, so it is sensible to stay away.

While crime in the Orlando area is not particularly high, with the annual tourists far outnumbering the regional population (~2million), a substantial amount of local crime ends up being directed at tourists. The most common crimes are theft of items from cars and hotels, so following common sense travel precautions are particularly important in an area like Orlando.
 
* Never leave valuable items in your car unattended, get any purchased items to your hotel room as soon as possible.
* Never leave small children unattended for any length of time, especially at a pool. Most hotel pools do not have lifeguards.
* Hotel room invasions do occur, especially open-air hotel and motel rooms when the victim leaves their hotel room unlocked and not dead-bolted. When you are in a hotel room, '''always''' lock your doors behind you, even if you expect someone in a minute or two.


Pets are better off left with a friend or in a kennel. If you choose to bring your pet, note that most theme parks and hotels prohibit pets but may provide kennels for a fee. Also note above about interior temperatures in parked cars.

For truly the safest experience, consider staying on Disney-owned property. If this is not possible, the area of Lake Buena Vista would be a preferred location. In addition to its accessibility to attractions, it offers a much safer, less urbanized area for comfort.

==Contact==

*'''Ten digit dialing''' is in effect in the Orlando area. All calls from or within the area, even local calls, require dialing the area code. There are some public '''pay phones''' scattered around the city, but they are becoming increasingly rare with the predominance of cell phones. It is not safe to assume you will be able to find a pay phone at any given time.

*'''Orlando/Orange County Convention & Visitors Bureau''', 8723 International Dr, toll free +1 800-972-3304, [http://www.orlandoinfo.com].. The official sales and marketing organization for the Orlando and Orange County area.

* '''Telephone Area Codes''' in and around the city of Orlando begin with 407 or 321.

* It is common for many of the larger hotels and lodgings in the area to offer free '''internet''' access for their guests.

==Get out==

[[Walt Disney World]], about 35 minutes southwest of Orlando proper, is so expansive that it needs its own travel guide.

Also within an hour of downtown Orlando:
* [[Altamonte Springs]]
* [[Celebration]] - the Disney-designed and -operated community
* [[Kissimmee]] Large suburb close to Disney World.
* [[Winter Haven]] - About 30 miles south of Disney off US27. Home to Legoland Florida. [http://florida.legoland.com/]

* [[Cocoa Beach]] - Closest beach to Orlando it boasts world-famous surfing.

* [[Cape Canaveral]] - Home to the Kennedy Space Center and its large visitor's complex, which showcases many space-related artifacts (including some large rockets).
