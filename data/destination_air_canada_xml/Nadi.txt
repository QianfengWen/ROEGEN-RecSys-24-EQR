{{pagebanner|Nadi Banner.jpg}}

'''Nadi''' (pronounced "Nandi") is on the western side of the island of [[Viti Levu]], the main and largest island in [[Fiji]].

==Understand==

Nadi is a transit point for other destinations in Fiji, and is slightly smaller than [[Lautoka]] just to the north, or the capital [[Suva]] out on the eastern coast. Many visitors spend a night here waiting for ferries, boats to outer islands, or planes to and from home. 

While the many town street and bus station is towards the south, a number of resorts line Queens Road from the airport, with some hostels on the water to the west of the airport runway. Few things are walkable in Nadi, but taxis are plentiful and an open-window, basic bus system used by locals exists.

There is not a lot to do but one great way to pass the time is to go to some of the creek sections near the airport where you may see beautiful finches, mongooses and other birds. Sunscreen and insect repellant are an absolute must due to the severe heat, humidity and risk of tropical disease. Make sure you understand the distances beforehand as walking to the beach in the heat may not be an option and internet is mainly available at the airport. You can use a MAC address changer to get a new WiFi session after the 30 minutes of WiFi is used up.

If you do decide to stay in or around Nadi, make sure you are prepared to be approached by people trying to get you into their shop as you walk down the main street.  These people aren't threatening, Nadi is the safest town of Fiji, there is no risk of pick pockets unless there is a festival in town when people from other towns and cities come to Nadi.

The upscale [[Denarau Island]] is just 5 km north west of Nadi, and is where you will find the region's luxury hotels and resorts. This is also where you will find Denarau Marina, your gateway to the beautiful island chains of the Mamanucas and Yasawas.

==Get in==

'''Nadi International Airport''' ('''NAN''') is Fiji's main international gateway. It is responsible for over 95 percent of Fiji's annual international passengers. 
 
Nadi International Airport's '''main''' airline provider is national carrier
[http://www.fijiairways.com/ Fiji Airways], with service to many South Pacific countries and islands throughout the country. [http://www.airnewzealand.co.nz/ Air New Zealand], Qantas, Jetstar Airways, and Virgin Australia bring a large number of tourists. Service to Asia is provided by Fiji Airways (Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore).

See Airports Fiji Limited [http://www.afl.com.fj/nadi_aiport.php] for more information.

Exiting the airport parking area to the main road gives you access to multiple public buses circulating between Nadi and Lautoka. The bus fare to Nadi as of early 2019, is around 2 Fijian dollars.

==Get around==

*Bags may be left for $8 FJD at the luggage storage right next to the arrival gate. This area is reasonably secure but people are allowed to come in and look for their bags so it is recommended you do not leave expensive goods. It may be closed for breaks but should be open until late so make sure of the time you can pick up.

*Taxi drivers will try to hustle you at the airport. They may be an option if you secure your price in advance. If being harassed, be firm and say No. Taxi drivers wear uniforms that may make you think they are airport staff and will do things like go behind the service desk or approach you and offer help. They may try to hustle you by offering incorrect information, such as saying the information desk will not be open today. The service desk may be helpful but they may also try to convince you of false information such as the distance to the buses being longer than it is, or that the next bus would be a long wait though they leave very frequently. This may be to entice customers into the cabs.

*There is a great local bus service at your disposal.  Travel with the locals in open-air comfort for a fraction of the price of a hire car.  All buses are marked on the front with the names of the two towns they travel between.  If unsure, ask the driver. Buses may be caught from the main road 4 minutes walk from the airport. Fare is paid when getting off and is only a couple dollars. Buses come very frequently and you shouldn't have to wait more than 15 minutes. Bus stops are not clearly marked in most cases, ask a local or go where people are congregating. Buses may offer change but better to get it beforehand.

*If you are staying at the Nadi Bay Hotel, simply walk to the end of that road and catch the local bus heading right (towards Nadi Town).  The buses run every 20 minutes or so, and are just 80 cents FJD one-way to town.

*Taxis have their hometown printed on the front bumper, if they are travelling back home they are not allowed to charge more than the busfare.

*You are able to bargain with the taxi driver prior to the trip in order to get the price of your trip down before you leave to your destination, ask your hotel or research reasonable prices prior to your ride. The taxis can be flagged down, or found at taxi stands

*It is recommended that you do not hire a personal car to take you around, simply for safety reasons. 

*Rental Cars are available through many known names such as Avis, Europcar, Hertz, Budget, etc. many can be found in the airport. You must have a valid drivers license and be above the age of 25 (or 21 depending on the company) in order to rent a car. The average price is around F$100 per day.

*If you are travelling to Denarau Marina for the Yasawa Flyer, a complimentary bus leaves the airport at 6:50am, stopping at a number of hotels before arriving at the port around 7:45am. Check in with the Awesome Adventures or travel desk to confirm the coach shuttle.

*If you are headed to a hotel in Nadi from Port Denerau, save over half your taxi fare by taking the frequent local red public bus at the port for FJ$1 to the town center. Get off when most of the bus does, and walk a block down the main street to Prouds department store where a line of taxis are parked. You can often get to any hotel for less than FJ$10 total this way.

==See==

* Visit the '''Hindu Temple''' at the southern end of the main street of Nadi.  It is the largest in the Pacific and is very colourful. Admission is $10 per person. Conservative wear is required and signposted. Women may borrow free sarongs from the shop. 

*Visit the '''Wailoaloa Beach''', at a 1/2 mile long the beach located in the northern area of Nadi. There are multiple beach clubs and resorts located on this stretch. According to a traveller, this beach is popular with backpackers and is a $10 cab ride from Nadi.

* The '''Newtown Beach''' has public access as well, it is located about 10 minutes away from Nadi town by bus.

* Visit the '''Nadi Garden of the Sleeping Giant'''. Originally started to make a place for the private collection of tropical orchids of Canadian actor Raymond Burr, this garden now houses many beautiful plants and trails for walking. It is open Monday-Saturday, entrance fee is F$10. One hustle encountered from an insistent market vendor was to offer a private car to this location and to wait for you, at an indeterminate price.

==Do==

* Hop on a local bus (FJD$2) to [[Lautoka]] and visit a real Fijian city away from the tourist eye.  The bus terminates at the local markets, where you can buy tonnes of fresh produce.

* From Thursday to Sunday, drop in to the '''Capricorn Hotel''' between Nadi airport and Nadi town at around 8pm.  You can sit under the bungalow and listen to a wonderful group of Fijians playing traditional and modern songs on guitar, ukulele and keyboard.  You may even be invited to try some of their kava drink (an experience in itself)!  The Hotel also serves meals and there is a bar.

* Hop on a ferry at Denarau Port and visit the Mamanuca and Yasawa islands right off the coast. 

* Visit the Nadi Town market, there are hand crafts, fruits, other produce, music, and much more! Food may not always be available, handicrafts are the main supply. Expect to haggle and deal with salesmen as goods are overpriced. Make sure you secure a price for anything before it is carved for you. You may be asked to sit down and chat as a precursor to buying something. Some goods may not be made by the store-owner, as they are also for sale at the airport.

* If you are religious and wish to attend a church service in Nadi, there are numerous churches that hold their worship services on Saturdays or Sunday. A few to mention are: Assemblies of God, Methodist Churches, Baptist Churches, Pentecostal Church [http://livingwaychurch.co], Seven Day Adventists and more [http://across.co.nz/Churches.Fiji.html]. They can be contacted via the local telephone directory [http://www.whitepages.com.fj/] or via the internet [http://www.google.com.fj].

==Stay safe==

You will hear on the grapevine quite a few stories of pickpockets and scams in Nadi. You may be told to put down your bags for respect at a temple and discover the bags are gone when you get back.

Avoid quiet streets and beaches away from the resorts near New Town, even during daylight. A taxi to the city center is only F$10, and ask hotel staff to call one for you. After dark, stay at your resort. That said, Nadi (and Fiji) are generally very safe.

There is a police station in the centre of the main street if you have any problems.

People encountered are generally friendly, with good English-skills and willing to help.

==Get out==

Tickets '''cannot be purchased with cash on board''' and must be prepaid. Most bus services require a reloadable eTransport card obtained at any Vodafone shop, or consult a travel desk for a reservation.
