'''Havana City''' ([[Spanish]]: ''Ciudad de la Habana'') is the capital city of [[Cuba]], and one of the fourteen provinces of the Republic of Cuba.

Before the Communist revolution and subsequent US blockade, Havana was one of the vacation hot-spots of the Caribbean, and since Cuba reopened to tourism in the 1990s, it has become a popular destination once again, albeit with many fewer U.S. citizens, due to an almost total ban on travel maintained by the U.S. federal government. However, there will be lots of tourists at any time of year, so expect huge crowds and long lines in places.

'''El Habanero''' [http://elhabanero.cubaweb.cu] and '''Tribuna de La Habana''' [http://www.tribuna.islagrande.cu] are the local periodicals. '''The H Magazine + Guide''' [http://www.thehmagazine.com] is an interesting publication about Havana beyond common stereotypes.

===Weather===
Cuba has a tropical climate, with warm, humid weather all year long, though cold temperatures have occured in the mountains before. Being surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico, Cuba has warm water year round, with winter water temperatures at 24C, spring and fall temperatures at 26C and summer temperatures at 28C.

===Currency===
Cuba has two currencies, the Cuban Peso (CUP) and the Cuban Convertible Peso (CUC). Most tourists will be using the CUC for all purchases, hotels, taxis and activities, but there is possibility to pay in equivalent in CUP (or CUC, when there is a CUP price), the rate is mostly 1 CUC = 25 CUP. The CUC was created to replace all the US$ that were used in the tourist industry until the late 1990s. 

For more information check the section on [[Cuba#Money|Money]] in the Cuba article.

==Get in==

===By plane===

'''Jose Marti International Airport''' ({{IATA|HAV}}) has three separate terminals. Terminal 1 is for internal (domestic) flights, Terminal 2 is mainly for charter flights from the [[USA]] and Terminal 3 is used for all other international flights.

To get in from the Airport to the city you'll need to take a taxi (25 to 30 CUC) or book an airport transfer (30 CUC). If you are feeling particularly adventurous you can try taking the bus. A good explanation (with an interactive map) is [https://whynotcuba.com/how-to-get-to-havana-from-the-airport/ here]. The way to the bus stop isn't difficult at all. When you leave the international terminal 3, turn right and follow the bigger road towards terminal 2. There's also a connection bus, but you might have to wait some time. When you reach terminal 2 you turn left and keep on walking until you reach Boyeros Avenue. The bus stop is right on the other side. P12 and P16 go all the way to Plaza de la Revolucion. Price: 1/2CUP. If you don't have CUP, throw 0,05CUC or even a CUC in. It's still a lot cheaper than the cab.

All luggage is scanned by X-ray after deplaning and after going through passport control. Customs officials can be very strict, and may snoop out any suspicious electronics or other items. However, if you are only taking a computer and camera equipment, they are more likely to just wave you through and not take a second look at your customs forms. Customs officials and immigration officials also work slowly and baggage reclaim is very slow, so expect a very long wait when entering the country.

As of September 2012, new duties rules have been put in place affecting anything brought into the country, so pack accordingly.  The first 44 kilos of your luggage is free (regardless of the content), however after that there is a 2 CUC per kilo charge for anything over that weight.  Certain items (most electronics, small appliances, etc) will be charged a 100% duty relative to their value (it's helpful to have a receipt for what it cost you in this regard, otherwise the customs officials will use their own price schedule which is often quite inflated).  Any communications gear (two-way radios, satellite TV equipment, even walkie-talkies) will be confiscated with no questions asked.  This applies not only to charter operators coming into the country from the U.S. but any entry into Cuba, regardless of the port of departure.  

The local airline, Cubana de Aviación offers decent service but reservations are notoriously hard to secure (usually two weeks in advance is a minimum).  Check with HAVANTUR offices located throughout the city and at major hotels for reservations.  Be prepared to pay in cash. Regular services from most South American and European countries, as well as Canada, are available. From Europe, Virgin Atlantic, Iberia, Air Europe and Air France all fly regularly to Havana.

===By train===
Most trains in eastern Cuba have been suspended due to poor track conditions. Only the following trains were operating to Havana in September 2007. '''All services run on alternate days only.'''

* The express Tren Frances, overnight from [[Santiago de Cuba]] via [[Matanzas]], [[Santa Clara (Cuba)|Santa Clara]] and [[Camagüey]] every other day (note that several hours have recently been added to the schedule due to the poor track conditions).
* An overnight local train from Santiago de Cuba, operating on alternate nights when the Tren Frances does not run.
* An overnight train from Moron with stops in Matanzas and Santa Clara.
* An overnight train from Sancti Spiritus with stops in Matanzas and Santa Clara.
* A daytime train from Camagüey with stops in Matanzas and Santa Clara (this is the only daytime service to Havana on the main line).
* A very slow daytime train from [[Cienfuegos]].
* A slightly faster evening train to Matanzas and Cienfuegoes, returns to Havana overnight.
* An overnight local train to [[Pinar del Rio]] that returns to Havana during the day.

Since these trains run every other day (when they are operating at all), you will need to confirm in advance that they are running on the day you wish to travel.

There is also the Hershey electric train running several times a day between Havana (Casa Blanca station) and Matanzas ('downtown' - not the main Matanzas station). The Hershey train cars are very dilapidated and will appeal certainly to die-hard train enthusiasts - but will be a good adventure for many others. The trip takes a minimum of four hours regardless of what the schedule says. Most of the seats are at least partially broken - but you should be able to find someplace to sit down. At any point of time there are two trains running on this single-track railway: one Matanzas-bound and one Casablanca-bound, provided that both trains are operational. Theoretically you can get off at Hershey and catch the train way back by walking across the platform - either train will wait for another's arrival because technically a train cannot leave Hershey station (which serves as the midway dual-track meetup point) while another is still occupying the only track of its onward leg. Note: as of April 13, 2018 the Hershey train was not running due to damage from Hurricane Irma.

===By car===

Car hires in Cuba are quite expensive, and the supply is quite limited, so if you do want to get around by yourself, book in advance and keep in mind you will pay significantly more for the convenience. All legal tourist rental cars have special tourist license plates (first letter of the plate is "T"), which means you will pay comparatively high prices every time you park your car in a city. Parking fees are generally taken by official workers wearing Havana Club vests and prices are variable depending on what part of the city you are in, but should never be more than 1 CUC/hour, and typically half that or less. Taking into account the all-around unreliability of Cuban transport, hiring a car can be the right choice for those who don't want any hassle whatsoever. Please keep in mind that picking up hitchhikers is almost a moral obligation for the "aware" tourist, especially when travelling between cities. Picking up a hitchhiker can be the best way to arrive to your destination without getting lost. Beware of the [http://wikitravel.org/en/Cuba#Scams scams]regarding the cost of insurance.

===By bus===
'''Viazul''' [http://www.viazul.com/] operates an inter-city coach service to/from most major destinations including [[Camagüey]], [[Cienfuegos]], [[Matanzas]], [[Pinar del Rio]], [[Sancti Spiritus]], [[Santa Clara (Cuba)|Santa Clara]], [[Santiago de Cuba]], [[Trinidad (Cuba)|Trinidad]], [[Varadero]] and [[Viñales]]. Schedules are posted on the Viazul website. The main Viazul bus terminal is 3km southwest of central Havana. You can grab a cab next to the exit from the terminal to El Capitolio for 10CUC or less (make sure in advance that it is 10CUC for a group and not per person).

Viazul can get you from Havana to almost anywhere in Cuba, but the prices will shock budget travellers (with prices from $15-50CUC). For major cities along Autopista, it's about 1/4 the cost if you hitch-hike (and more fun).

===By Guagua/Truck===
Guaguas or trucks are the local means of transport. You can get to Havana from almost every city in the east. Usually they stop at bigger crossroads near the motorway, you get in the back of some oldstyle GDR- or US-American truck, pay in national pesos and will be able to chat with Cubans. In comparison to Viazul the trucks are very cheap. Examples: Pinar del Rio - Havana - 50CUP (around 2USD), Matanzas - Havana - 30CUP (1,20USD). It takes a little bit longer, is less comfortable, but as authentic as possible. Trucks along the autopista stop under every bridge, where you will have a connection to nearby towns by Collectivo Taxi or horse carriage (both shouldn't cost more than 20CUP, depending on the distance. 20CUP for 50km in a Collectivo should be fine). Ask people under the bridges how much they would pay - if you're waiting at some crossroads to board a truck, straightly ask other passengers what the price is. At amarillo points you can also hitch a ride with cars - the amarillo gets 2CUP.

===By boat===

Due to political circumstances, it is difficult to enter Cuba by sea. Visiting mariners need to make arrangements in advance of entering port to avoid difficulties. Also, most ports are closed to unauthorised visitors.

==Get around==
[[Image:Cocotaxi.JPG|thumb|300px|''Coco Taxi''.  Coco taxis are cheap transport.]]

===By taxi===

* [http://www.havanaairporttransfer.com Havana airport transfer data]

As a tourist, the most convenient way of getting around Havana is by taxi. Some of the taxis are old American Chevys from the 1950's, others are (somewhat) newer Russian Ladas, whilst most tourist taxis are modern Peugeots, Skodas and even Mercedes.

It is illegal for tourists to ride in anything other than the official government taxis. However, it is often easier to wave down one of the old Chevys or Ladas. When riding in an illegal taxi, negotiate the fare ahead of time. The fare in illegal taxis will be no cheaper than the official taxi fare. Around the city, taking illegal taxis should be no problem. However, taking an illegal taxi to or from the airport may attract the attention of the police, so most of the drivers will let you 200 meters behind the terminal nearby the parking lot.

Taxis collectives are the old, beaten-up yank-tanks with a taxi sign on the roof or in the front window. Tourists are not supposed to take them, but you will rarely run into problems and they are a fun and cheap alternative to the state-run taxis. In fact, the driving standards are pretty good, if you can cope with the loud reggaeton music blasting from their speaker systems - the volume of which is only lowered to hear the destinations shouted from the customers hailing the cab. Stand just off intersections of the major streets and flag down the taxi. Shout your general destination (neighborhood) through the window at the driver. He will either drive off (with no further words being said!) or stop for you. They have set fares and run set routes, so you may need some assistance when taking them the first few times.  

One useful shared taxi route for Centro Habana goes west along Neptuno -> San Lazaro -> Hotel Havana Libre -> east on San Lazaro -> south on Prado to start again.

Another useful shared taxi route starts at Parque de la Fraternida (near Habana Vieja) west of Industria on Simon Bolivar.  It travels west along Simon Bolivar, which turns into Avenida Salvador Allende, which turns into Avenida Manuel de Cepedes, which turns into Avenida de la Independencia.  This route passes within 200 m of Habana Vieja, 50 m of Plaza de la Revolucion, 800 m of the Viazul bus station, and 500 m of Airport Terminal 2 (within 25 m of Avenida de la Indepencia at the shared taxi stop for Airport Terminal 2 is a bus shelter where passengers can take an hourly bus that stops on the main roadway, about 150 m from Terminal 3 for 1 CUP or the occasional taxi for 1 CUC).

Fares are either 10 CUP for a short (5 km) journey during the day or 20 CUP for a longer run or at night (some drivers will accept a 1 CUC coin if you do not have CUP). The drivers are generally honest regarding the fares, but it is best not to appear oblivious by asking how much at the end of the trip. Always watch what the other passengers give: if in doubt, give only 10 CUP unless the driver asks for another 10. There can be a long wait trying to get a taxi collectivo as they are very popular with Cubans and often full, but the experience and the savings make it worthwhile. If a taxi sounds his horn as he approaches a crossroads then he has vacant spaces to fill. A typical taxi to (or from) the airport will cost 20-30 CUC depending on where you are staying in Havana, how good you are at haggling, and how much the taxi driver wants your business.

Coco Taxis and yellow three wheel motorbikes are a cheap way of getting around central Havana.

===By bus===
Havana used to have a public transportation service called the ''El Camello'', a split-level bus pulled by a semi-truck, and resembling a 2 humped camel (thus the name). Camellos finished operation in April 2008 and were replaced by modern city buses imported from China.

The cost of riding the new city bus is 1 national peso or sometimes even 0.40 national cents to anywhere in the city (the driver will not give you change). Expect some overcrowding, there are plenty of buses running though, so if the one you want is full simply wait for the next one. There are few clearly marked bus stops on route, but it's clear where they stop usually as you will have other waiting at the side of the road; you are able to leave when the bus stops at the traffic lights. Note that a number of private buses now ply the streets alongside government ones, serving a variety of routes. They are much less crowded and more comfortable, but cost 10 pesos. [2016-01]

Especially to the suburbs this bus network is a practical means of transport for visitors. Click here for a map of government buses routes ("P" routes): [[Media:HavanaBusMap.jpg]] [2016-01]

===By car===
Hiring a car can be an interesting experience, but take care as Havana has many one-way roads. One-ways are noted by a blue arrow sign usually stuck to a building near the street corners, but you can not necessarily guarantee this, and there is so little traffic in Havana that you may not necessarily be able to tell based on traffic flow. Google Maps also does not give entirely reliable turn-by-turn directions. Roads in Havana are generally OK for a developing country, but be on the lookout for deep potholes which may destroy your tires, or worse, if you are not careful and drive into them. Your Casa or hotel probably can arrange a parking spot for you, but in case not, public parking areas in Havana are managed by men wearing Havana Club vests and they will likely approach you within a few seconds of you parking your car. The cost is variable depending on location and whether you have a tourist car (license plate starting in T) or not, but in Havana Vieja it will likely run at about 0.30–0.50 CUC per hour, and less in Centro and Vedado. If you plan to park overnight, ask the parking attendant if you can do so, as some parking spots are 24 hours and others are daytime-only. Overnight parking may require advance payment. If so, make sure you get a receipt. For peace of mind it is probably better to pay someone to watch your car in an official spot rather than trying to find a back alley somewhere to leave the car in order to save $2. The parking men are not scammers, think of them as the parking meters as you would have in many other countries.

===By cycle===
Cycling can be a great way to get around Cuba.  There are a number of international tour companies [http://www.cubalinda.com/English/Activities/Cycling/Cycling.asp]that offer guided tours, the most popular is from Havana to Santiago de Cuba.  If you are traveling in February and March avoid the west to east approach as the trade winds are tough to cycle against.

===By foot===
Walking around Havana is by far the best way to see and experience the city: get a decent map of the city and discover new sights on foot. Many choose to do it with a  local tour guide, which I consider the best way to savor the city. Most of them are foreign language teachers, others can even  be doctors. You will find the best on line, the minimum they charge is 25 a day.

==See==
[[Image:Capitolio Building.JPG|thumb|425px|The Capitol Building in Havana (Capitolio Nacional)]]
* '''Museum of the Revolution''' and the '''Capitol Building'''.

* Visit a live '''cigar factory'''. One offering tours is at the intersection of Peñalver and San Carlos (just 1 mile southwest of Old Havana La Habana Vieja), tickets can/should be bought in advance (10 CUC per person as of July 2014). English tours are available. Please note that there is no photography allowed. It is the place where you can also be sure to get the correct cigars in the shop - more expensive than 'street offers' - but the quality of these "street offers" is definitely questionable. Note that the Partagas cigar factory just behind the Capitol Building has closed permanently since late 2011 and moved; the original factory is now a shop only.

* '''Havana Club Rum Factory'''.  Go on a guided tour of Havana Club, one of Cuba's most famous rums. Most of the exhibits are subtitled in English and are fairly self-explanatory. (7 CUC, Jan 2017)

* '''Walk along the Prado''' street in the evening. Great public space - unfortunately not illuminated at night. The Prado hums with street life, cafes and charm.

* '''Walk along El Malecón'''.  A favorite stroll for tourists and locals, a walk along the Malecon runs along the main streets of Havana and provides stunning views of the Bay.

* Enjoy the glory of '''La Habana Vieja''' (''The Old Town''), some of it faded and crumbling - but there are many beautifully restored buildings as a result of the UNESCO World Heritage Site designation.

* '''Plaza de la Revolución'''.  Huge square dominated by a statue and monument of Jose Marti and the iconic image of Che Guevara adorning the Ministry of the Interior. Arrive either early or late, as it is often swamped by tourists and gets very hot during the day.

* '''John Lennon Park''' in Vedado. Notable for the regularly stolen (and replaced) eyeglasses.

* '''Hotel Habana Libre''' in Vedado. The hotel housed Castro's soldiers for several days after they took Havana. It has an excellent selection of photos in the lobby along with one of the only 24 hour fast food restaurants in the city.

* Enjoy extraordinary 360-degree views of the city using the large '''Camara Oscura''' in the old town.

* The '''Catedral de San Cristobal''' in old Havana. Said to be the only example of a baroque construction that possesses asymmetrical features, one of the towers is wider than the other.

* '''Plaza de Armas'''. Spacious and elegant, the square is surrounded by baroque constructions that give it a authentic colonial milieu. It was laid out during the 1600s, replacing an old plaza which acted as the center of religious, administrative and military activity. Until the mid-18th century, it was used for military exercises and parades. After its remodeling between the years 1771-1838, it became a favored meeting spot for the city's wealthy. Today it is also known as Céspedes Park, in honor of the country´s Founding Father, whose monument stands at its center. This square is one of the most outstanding in the city, enlivened by vendors of antiques and classical books on Latin American and world literature. Attractions of remarkable historical value lay around the square such as the capok tree (Ceiba) under which the first mass for the city´s founding was officiated in 1519.

*'''Castillo de la Real Fuerza''' is the oldest bastioned fortress in the New World and has now reopened as a Cuba’s premier maritime museum.  (There is also a small naval museum in Cienfuegos.). The museum contains excellent exhibits of Cuba’s maritime past, from pre-Columbian days through to the 18th Century with the Royal Shipyard of Havana, one of the largest in the world which built nearly 200 ships for the Spanish Crown. The museum features a huge four metre model of the Santisima Trinidad, located on the main floor with a large interactive touch screen, which describes life aboard an 18th Century ship-of-the-line in Spanish, French, and English. The original ship was launched into Havana Bay on March 2, 1769 and was the largest ship in the world in the 18th Century, with 140 cannons on four gun decks.  She was one of four Cuban-built ships at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. Downstairs you will find ancient navigational instruments, underwater archaeological artifacts, and gold and silver from the colonial era. Also note the original weathervane, La Giraldilla, while her replica moves in the breeze on the top of the fortress tower, which commands a fantastic view of the city. The second level of the museum hosts many other historic and contemporary models of ships with links to Cuba and is also a good location for viewing the harbour and city skyline.

* '''Baseball game''' - Havana Industriales is the best team in the league, and they play regularly at Estadio LatinoAmericano. Ask many people for schedule to crowdsource the truth (get at least 3 opinions) because oddly few people seem to be correct.  Entry is 3CUC for foreigners (1P for locals) and seating is wherever you want. Public buses like P14 leave regularly to stadium from Parque de la Fraternidad for 1-10 pesos; just ask people which bus and when to exit.

* '''Necropolis de Cristobal Colon''' - a large ornate cemetery west of the Plaza de la Revolución. Unfortunately they charge like everywhere in Cuba (5 CUC).

* '''Latin American New Cinema Festival''', [http://www.habanafilmfestival.com] is a popular event held every December, screening international films and drawing around 500,000 people.

* '''Tropicana Show''' &mdash; A cabaret show that costs 90 CUC. Note that second best cabaret show in town is at the Cabaret Parisien at the Hotel Nacionale, which costs 35 CUC.  There are less expensive cabaret shows available, which local Cubans may be able to afford, and therefore attend.

* '''Take a tour in an old car''' &mdash; For around 20-30 CUC an hour for up to four people, be driven around Havana in style.  Choose a car you like near the Hotel Inglaterra or outside the Museum of the Revolution.  Note that those on a budget can ride old cars by taking shared taxis for 1 CUC or less.

* '''Walk around Havana Vieja''' in the early mornings, or take a very long walking tour with [http://www.havanafrans.nl "Havana Frans"], a Dutch jazz photographer who lives in Havana.

Havana is a surprisingly expensive city to stay in; if you stay in hotels and eat in restaurants it can work out to be nearly as expensive as other popular international destinations. The problem is that Cuba has a dual economy, if you could live on pesos it would be incredibly cheap. Sadly, as a tourist this is virtually impossible. Most peso hotels won't take foreigners or, if they do you have to pay in CUC. If you are on any kind of a budget it is advised to stay in [[casa particular|casas particulares]]; it is much cheaper, often more comfortable and the food (a recurring theme in Cuba) is almost invariably better. Food, transport, but also certain souvenirs you can buy both in CUC and CUP. In the old town you will find many expensive places, especially on pedestrian roads like O'Reilly, Obispo and Obrapia. Some parallel streets can be a lot cheaper and even peso restaurants can be found. Don't get fooled by the art and souvenir shops on those main roads. For example: they sell propaganda posters, supposedly originals or very precious prints, for prices around 20CUC, sometimes 15CUC. This is far from the actual value. Look for shops outside of the center. In the harbour area there is a little market were the price for the same posters already drop down to 6CUC each - if you manage to find some locals to give you help it can be even cheaper. Another examples are propaganda comic books about the revolution. In the tourist bookshops they cost 7CUC and that's also the number written on the first page. Actually it used to mean 7CUP. For this price the comic books are available in normal bookshops addressed to Cubans outside of the center. Ideally, you ask someone to help you finding those places. 

Other things you can buy: there are the classic small corner shops that have almost no diversity at all, then supermarkets with bottled water, rum, bread, sausage, canned food. All not very spectacular. A bigger shopping center you will find at Carlos III., but you might need to queue a little for special products. There's also separate hygiene shops, i.e. Agua y Jabon, where you get shampoo, shower gel, toilet paper (kind of a big deal in Cuba) and so on for surprisingly high prices (shampoo usually for 2,85CUC).

ATMs are not too hard to find in downtown Havana, but bear in mind that American credit- and debit-cards can not be used in Havana. Note that even credit cards issued in countries other than the USA may be issued by a bank whose parent company is a U.S. corporation. In this case, the card will not work as the parent company is bound by U.S. law. Even banks wholly owned by non-American companies may have a policy on blocking Cuban transactions in order not to compromise their US business. '''Always''' check with your bank or credit card company before leaving home to see if your card will work in Havana. Also, the ATMs do not accept MasterCard/Maestro but are marked to accept Visa.

You can withdraw money from your MasterCard in a couple of exchange offices. There is one in the basement of the Hotel Nacional, but expect quite steep service fees.

Exchanging US dollars in a CADECA (Casa de cambio) will incur a 10% penality.  Sterling, Euros and Canadian dollars can easily be exchanged at Cadecas and do not incur the same fee.

==Eat==
Whilst Convertible Peso restaurants can be quite expensive at the top end for rather mediocre food, some such as the Café de Oriente have a splendid ambiance. The average government-run restaurants are about US$20 for two. Almost without exception, state-run restaurants will have lower quality food than paladares. However, state-run restaurants often have very nice ambiances, so if you care more about the setting than the value-for-quality of the food, state-run places may be a reasonable option. 

Keep in mind that some tourist-oriented restaurants add a 10% service charge to the bill automatically, while others do not. Take a look at your bill and check whether the service fee is itemized or not before leaving too much (or to little) of a tip.

===Budget===
Stalls selling food priced in national pesos are all over the city.  Look for the windows or tiny storefronts with planks hanging out front, listing items and prices.  Generally, an espresso is 1 CUP, a sandwich is 5-15 CUP, a pizza is 10 CUP.  Availability of other dishes varies widely, but nothing costs more than 25 CUP or so.  Be nice and tip well.

Some restaurants like Hanoi, in Calle Brasil, offer generous meals for 5 CUC.

With Cuban national pesos, you can get ice cream for only 1 peso (US$0.04) in small street booths scattered around the city. You can also get a filling bocadito (small ham sandwiches) or a cajita (small meal in a cardboard box) for less than 20 pesos (US$0.80), or a "pizza" for 7-10 pesos (US$0.40).

Particularly, the '''Terminal de Omnibus''', by the Plaza de la Revolucion, has a very good peso cafe with offerings as fried chicken for only 25 pesos ($1.00 USD).

*'''Coppelia Ice Cream parlour''', opposite the Habana Libre. Practically a Cuban institution with people waiting up to an hour to get a seat. Prices are in pesos and CUC (obviously the queues being for the peso area). Peso-paying sections cost 1 peso per scoop (open till 9:15pm) and outdoor convertible-paying section costs 1 centavo (0.01 CUC) per gram (two scoops and up, which will costs you minimum 2.75 CUC; open 24 hours)

===Mid-range===
Keeping your eyes open you can find complete menus (starter or salad, soup, main dish, dessert and a national beverage) for 6-10CUC. In the Vieja, there are such restaurants in the smaller, not very crowded streets.

Beware that at least one paladar charges an hefty per-person service charge on top of your bill (10 CUC per couple at Paladar Amistad de Lanzarote in Central Havana) - deceivingly printed in Spanish only in a bilingual English/Spanish menu. Also no matter what the owner insists, there is never a tax levied for eating at paladares. Always ask before ordering.

*<eat name="El Aljibe" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="">In the Havana suburb of Miramar, El Aljibe is the definitive proof that food in Cuba needn't be bland. Try the house specialty, chicken in sour orange sauce. El Aljibe also has a remarkably well-stocked wine cellar.</eat>

*<eat name="La Casa" address="Calle 30 No. 865 e/ 26 y 41, Nuevo Vedado" hours="Daily from 12:00 to 0:00" price="10-25 CUC">This stylish restaurant, located in Nuevo Vedado, is a large California-style house typical of the 1950s. The dining room and garden are inviting and intimate. The impeccable service and consistency uncommon in Cuba, are a must in Havana. Website adress: [http://restaurantlacasa.wordpress.com Restaurant La Casa]</eat> 

*<eat name="Paladar La Tasquita" alt="" address="Calle 27 de Noviembre (Jovellar No. 160) e/ Espada y San Francisco" directions="" phone="873-4916" url="" hours="Daily from 6 to 10" price="15-25 CUC" lat="" long=""> Located near San Lazaro, this ''Paladar'' (Small, family-run, private-owned restaurant) serves typical ''criolla'' food. You will be dining in the living room of a local family, so don't expect anything glamourous in terms of atmosphere. On the other hand, the staff is very friendly and you will get the opportunity to taste typical cuban food as local families prepare it: Simply delicious. The seating is limited so reserve in advance.</eat>

There are many good, mid-priced restaurants in Chinatown. "Bavaria" is one of the best if you can picture a restaurant named after a German province pronounced like "barbaria" with Chinese decor, serving pizzas and spaghetti.

===Splurge===
The restaurants inside five-star hotels tend to charge excessive amounts of money for mediocre food and service.

Try '''La Fontana Restaurant''', one of the most notable grill restaurants in Cuba. La Fontana has a refined yet sober home environment, suitable for a dinner with a touch of familiarity and a placid conversation, while enjoying exquisite dishes from its specialty, updated Cuban cuisine. Ask for octopus grilled over charcoal with pesto, or choose a sea snail in garlic and aged rum. It is about $25 per person, and you need to make a call to book: +53 7 202 8337, +53 5 293 2497, or +53 5 286 4747.

La Guarida is almost certainly the most famous paladar in Cuba, and has an interesting setting in a ruined building in the Centro neighborhood. During the high season, you will need to reserve a table at least a couple weeks in advance if you want to eat at prime dinner time (e.g. 7-9pm). Even during the low season, you will likely want to book several days in advance. A three course meal with cocktails will probably cost around $40 per person. 

For great ambience and surprisingly palatable fare, Paladar "Vistamar" on Calle 1 in Miramar offers a top-notch wine list, excellent selection and quality of sea-food, and (very rare for Cuba) an assortment of beef dishes.  Perched at the edge of the ocean overlooking the Florida Straits, you can enjoy dinner "al fresco" either on the balcony or the patio, or inside in a well-aportioned dining room with (again surprisingly for Cuba) attentive and knowledgeable staff.  Expect to pay for the priviledge though, as an entre will set you back 10-20 CUC and an average bottle of wine hovers around 30.  No reservations necessary, but a little hard to find as it appears to be a private house at first glance; get a taxi to get you there.

===Breakfast===

All the tourist hotels serve breakfast, typically a buffet with a wide variety of good food, although overpriced (15 CUC at the Hotel Nacional). If you stay in a <i>casa particular</i> ask whether you'll be served breakfast. If not, ask the landlord/lady to take you shopping. Breakfast in casa particulares can be good value, or terrible value — it depends entirely on how good of a cook they (or their helpers) are! Breakfast costs usually around 3-5 CUC per person. If you are very budget minded, or if the breakfast ends up being terrible on your first day, you could instead go to a cafeteria and get a coffee and an egg sandwich for about 10 CUP. A few restaurants in Havana open before 11 AM, including:

*'''Café Arcángel''' &mdash; Located on Calle Concordia and Águila, Café Arcángel has everything from fruits and vegetables to eggs, bacon, and even salmon baguettes. You can also order one of a dozen different types of coffee, and can make it Irish if you prefer. 3-6 CUC per person.

*'''Pastelaria Francesa''' &mdash; Next door to the Hotel Inglaterra, this pastry shop has a wide variety of delicious confections. Pick up a pastry and a coffee for under 2 CUC per person for a cheap and fast breakfast.

*'''La Farmacia''' &mdash; At the very northern end of Havana Vieja, offers standard breakfast of bacon, eggs, and juice for around 5 CUC. 

*'''Café Espada''' &mdash; Near the Museo de la Revolución, also provides a variety of breakfast options for around 5-10 CUC depending on how extravagant you go.

==Drink==
Cocktails in Cuba are of surprisingly uniform prices—around 3 CUC for a mojito nearly anywhere you go (except state-run hotels like Hotel Nacional, which charge closer to 7 CUC). While the prices are nearly uniform, the quality and quantity vary massively. 

*'''La Bodeguita del Medio''' is ''the'' bar in which to sample a Mojito. The former hangout of Ernest Hemingway, it is best sampled in the evening once the tourist crowds from Varadero have headed back out of the city.

*'''El Floridita''', Obispo St.  Another stop on the Hemingway booze tour; known for its daiquirís (which are, truth to tell, overpriced and mediocre), but better visited for its atmosphere, which is almost unchanged from pre-Castro days.

*'''Hotel Nacional''' has exceptional cocktails at Salon de la Historia. Try a Pina Colada for 5 CUC (2014) while amusing yourself at the photos of the all the celebrities who have visited over the years. 

*'''Los Buccaneros Hanoi''', Calle Brasil. With the front of the Capitol building on your right from the main street, walk about two blocks to the left on the road that runs parallel to the Capitol. There are two bars called Hanoi. Go to the first one Los Buccaneros. This bar serves very good mojitos for 1$CUC.

*'''Azucar Lounge''', Plaza Vieja. Directly above Café El Escorial. A modern bar with excellent mixed drinks and coffees and with a nice view over Plaza Vieja. 

*'''Casa Balear'''*, a very local spot at Avenida de los Presidentes and Av. 23. Many twens come here after their lessons are finished in the nearby tourism section of the University of Havana. Mojito 15CUP, others around 20CUP.

*'''La Fabrica de Arte Cubano (FAC)''', is an abandoned factory that was given to some artists by the goverment. They turned the place into a mix of nightclub, bars, chillout lounges, a huge gallery and exhibition area as well as a cinema screen and stages for performances. It's probably the most vibrant and pulsating night life place for now and it's far from touristy, despite the fact that many foreigners visit it. Usually full of expats and art interested people. Location is pretty much off the oldtown, what gives it more of a flair of authenticity and underground. Here's their [http://www.fac.cu/ website]. 
 
You can have a great time just outside of the Hotel Inglaterra near the Capitólio Building, drinking good daiquiris and mojitos at an affordable price.

There are two '''types of establishments''' you can go to to drink in Havana: '''Western-style CUC bars''' with near-Western prices, a good selection of quality drinks (and sometimes food), nice decorations, semi-motivated staff and often live music, typically found around tourist hot-spots such as Old Havana and tourist hotels. Here you will mostly meet other tourists, expats and a few Cubans with access to hard currency, but don't expect a 'local' experience.

The alternative is to seek out '''local neighborhood bars''' where you can choose from a quality, but limited, selection of drinks (mainly locally produced rum by the bottle, beer and soft drinks, very rarely will you be able to get cocktails such as mojitos), cigars of dubious and cigarettes of only slightly better quality, and sometimes snacks. Local bars accept CUPs and are dirt-cheap, although bar keepers will often ask you for CUCs instead - it's up to you to negotiate an acceptable price, but keep in mind that local bar staff are state employees and (literally) paid a pittance. These bars are also a good way to meet locals who may even open up a bit and talk about their lives after a couple of drinks.

Local bars are not that hard to find despite typically having no prominent signs displayed outside. Just ask or walk around a local neighborhood and look out for a bare-walled, neon-lit run-down room without any decorations or furniture, save for a bar and a few rickety chairs and tables, sullen staff and depressed/bored/drunk-looking customers, almost always men. Contrary to Cuba's reputation as a music and fun loving nation, these places are not boisterous affairs - they are quiet, almost subdued, music is rarely played (if at all, it will come from a radio but never be live), and have the charm of third-world railway station waiting rooms.

Nonetheless, they make for a fascinating experience (especially if you make the effort to speak to some locals - offering to buy a drink will get a conversation going, no surprise there), and they provide a good insight into what life must be like for ordinary Cubans without hard currency. As a foreign visitor, you will be generally welcomed. '''Discussing politics over a drink''' is a tricky, and typically lose-lose proposition: speak negatively about the Cuban political system and you may put your Cuban drinking companions into a very difficult position as they may very well be informed on (for hanging out with subversive foreigners); enthuse about the Revolution, Che, Fidel, Cuba's health care system, sticking it to the Gringos, etc., and people will assume that you are at best naive or at worst not in full possession of your mental faculties. Cheers!

<!-- Please do not add links to external guides. We like to have the actual hotel info right here! See [[Wikitravel:External links]] for more info -->
There are 3 main areas that travelers generally stay in: Old Havana is the liveliest (some would say hectic and dirty), Central Havana is slightly quieter and parts can be a bit seedy, and Vedado is the quietest with more greenery, and is the place to find the large hotels and nicer [[casa particular|casas particulares]].

Hotels vary. While everywhere should have hot water and steady electricity, you cannot necessarily expect air conditioning (although many do have it), nor TV, and you will have to be extremely lucky to find a place with WiFi--and even for places with WiFi access, you will still need to use an ETECSA card. Quality can be a bit bizarre—a hotel may have an in-hotel doctor and a swimming pool, but the rooms inside may be decrepit and have dysfunctional showers or toilets.

AirBnB now works in Cuba, but keep in mind that many of the places listed as "full apartment" are not actually the full apartment, but more of a BnB where the owner lives in the home and rents out rooms. If you really want your full apartment, Havana is basically the only place in the country where this can be arranged, but you may have to message a few places to see whether the "full apartment" really means it includes the kitchen, or not.

*'''Casa del Jardin, Havana''', ($35CUC), Calle 46 No. 105 e/ 1ra y 1ra A, Playa, [https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/7996076?preview].  Studio with kitchen and bathroom. The garden is accessible and can be used. Gladys speaks wonderful English, German and Russian. +53 5 3863464

*'''Casa Nora, Havana''', ($35CUC), Calle 64 No. 4105 e/ 41 y 43, Playa.  Living room, bedroom and compact kitchen.  George speaks wonderful English and has a wealth of information.

*'''Casa Mireya''', 47 Ave. #5211 (''between 52 and 54''), Playa, +53 7 209 13 54.

*'''Casa Mari y Jose''', Calle 8 No. 511 e/ 5taA y 5taB, Miramar-Playa, La Habana, Frente al Restaurante Kasalta. Booking: http://www.hostalmarijose.com

===Mid-range===

* '''Casa de Sergio and Miriam''', Luz 109 (''in the center of Old Havana''), +53 7 860 8192, [http://www.monkibo.com/havana].

* '''Hotel Inglaterra''', Paseo del Prado, Old Havana, [http://www.hotelinglaterracuba.com]. A popular hotel with a restaurant for those wanting to stay closer to the action yet still in the comforts of a hotel. Rooms from US$80.

*'''Hotel Mercure Sevilla Havane''', Trocadero 55 e, Prado y Zulueta Habana Vieja, Tel. (+53)7/8608560, Fax. (+53)7/8616565, E-Mail: reserva@sevilla.gca.tur.cu [http://www.accorhotels.com/de/hotel-1870-hotel-mercure-sevilla-havane/index.shtml].

* '''Hotel Telegrafo''', Prado and Neptuno, Old Havana. A popular hotel just around the corner from Parque Central, right next to Inglaterra. Renovated in 2004, and now really nice inside, a welcome haven of peace away from Vieja. Rooms US$80-120, cheaper if you book ahead with Opodo.

===Hotels===
* '''Tryp Habana Libre Hotel''', La Rampa (''just off the Malecón in Vedado'').[http://www.hotelhabanalibre.com] A Havana landmark in a good location, it's popular with tourists and journalists, has a good 24 hour cafe on site, and a business center with decent internet connections.

*'''Hotel Habana Riviera''', Paseo and Malecón, Vedado.[http://www.hotelhavanariviera.com] Located along the Malecon, Havana's waterfront boulevard, this elegant hotel is considered a classic among Cubans. Its proximity to the historical-cultural center of Havana, makes this hotel the perfect place from which to explore the city. In the night time the Riviera offers excellent entertainment featuring both the exclusive Copa Room Cabaret and one of Havana's top restaurants.

* '''Hotel Nacional''', Calle 21 and O, Vedado, +53 7 836 3564.[http://www.hotelnacional-cuba.com] Overlooking the ocean on the Malecón, this hotel is legendary, having hosted international VIPs for 30 years.  Many years of neglect, coupled with an only partially successful renovation, have left the Nacional a step below its former glory.  That said, some stay here and rarely leave the hotel, enjoying the restaurant, terrace, frequent live performances by renowned Cuban musicians, and enjoying the views while sipping Mojitos. But did you come to see Havana, or hang out in a hotel? Maybe some of both is called for. The hotel also has an excellent, albeit expensive business centre featuring CNN, internet access and a bar. Rooms from US$150.

*'''Hotel Saratoga''', corner of Prado and Dragones, Old Havana, +53 7 868 1000.[http://www.saratogahotel-cuba.com] Opened in November 2005, it is regarded as one of the higher quality hotels in Cuba.

*'''Hotel Parque Central''', on Neptuno (''between Agramonte and Paseo di Marti''), +53 7 867 1037.[http://www.hotelnhparquecentral.com] Similar to the Saratoga in quality, and has a beautiful ground floor lobby as well as a rooftop swimming pool.  The recently-opened Torre wing may have the best rooms in Cuba, at least by Western standards.

* '''Hotel Conde de Villanueva''', Calle Mercaderes esq. Amagura, Old Havana. A beautifully restored colonial home, this hotel is the ultimate destination for a connoisseur of Cuban cigars; each room is named after a tobacco plantation, and, of course, all rooms permit smoking. Boasts an impressive cigar shop in the hotel, in addition to a (reasonably average) restaurant. Be warned, though: if you like to sleep late, there is a peacock that wanders around the courtyard that begins to make noise as soon as the sun comes up.

* '''Hotel Ambos Mundos''', Obispo esquina a Mercaderes.[http://www.hotelambosmundos-cuba.com] Writer Ernest Hemingway stayed and wrote most of ''For Whom the Bell Tolls'' here, a fact which adds historical charm to this well-located hotel in Old Havana. The Plaza de Armas is a few steps away, and the establishment has an elegant and lively lobby where piano and jazz musicians perform. 

* '''Hotel Park View''', Colón 101.[http://www.hotelparkview-cuba.com] A popular hotel in the 1920s, the Park View (reopened in 2002) is a small establishment just off Prado, close to the colonial centre of Old Havana and the seawall. It does not share in the historical or decorative charm of other Old Havana properties, but it is certainly a practical option for anyone interested in exploring Old Havana and traveling on a tighter budget. 

* '''Hotel Plaza''', Ignacio Agramonte No. 267.[http://www.hotelplazacuba.com] The Plaza is one of Havana’s oldest hotels. In addition to a beautifully restored interior and a great location near many places of interest in Old Havana, the hotel also has some interesting anecdotes. Albert Einstein once dined here, and Babe Ruth stayed at one of the suites, today a museum (where his bat has been preserved). 

* '''Hotel Santa Isabel''', Baratillo 9.[http://www.hotelsantaisabel.com] Considered Old Havana’s flagship hotel, this establishment is one of the classier – and more expensive – colonial-era options in this part of town. The long terrace overlooking the Plaza de Armas, shared by 10 west-facing rooms, is one of the hotel’s most evident charms, as are its colonial appeal and a magnificent location.

* '''Hotel Meliá La Habana''', Ave. 3Era. E/ 76 Y 80 Miramar. A modern five star hotel with very big and comfortable rooms, and possibly the biggest swimming pool in Havana.

==Contact==
The city code for Havana is 7. Prefix with 0 or 01 when calling from within Cuba. 

'''Internet cafes and WiFi''' can be found at ETESCA (the state telephone company) offices which sell internet cards for $2CUC for an hour. Parks often have guys standing around who will sell you legitimate cards for a small markup (e.g. $2.50 to $3CUC) which can save you the trouble of having to find an open ETECSA shop. Definitely try to avoid the price gauging from the hotels, which charge around $4.50 CUC for the exact same card! If buying on the street, just make sure that the card is valid for the correct year, and that the passcode has not already been scratched off. (There should be two numbers -- the login should be visible, while the password should be hidden behind a scratch-off section like lottery tickets.) You can use these cards on ETECSA computers of wifi hotspots nation-wide. In Havana they exist in Hotel Habana Libre, Hotel Inglatera, Hotel Nacional, the Capitolio, and public parks like Fe Del Valle. You'll know it by a mob of people standing around staring at screens, just like in the rest of the world. A few casa particulares also have wifi, which saves you the trouble of having to go to the closest park or state-run hotel, but again these will require an ETECSA card to log in. 

The cards provide 1 hour of time, but you will need to specifically "log out", otherwise your card will use up the whole hour (e.g. if you just close your laptop or phone). For phones it may be a bit trickier to log out properly, in which case you may try to 'forget network'. Some Samsungs have trouble connecting altogether.

Since 2017, 3G cell phone networks are now easily available for tourists in Cuba, although the prices are quite expensive. For instance, Digicel offers a SIM card with 100 MB of data for $25, and recharges of 300 MB for $50. This will require an unlocked phone and the knowledge of how to avoid your phone immediately using all of its data on useless things like app updates and push notifications. If you know how to manage your phone's data use very precisely, this can be a great tool for getting around Cuba. If you do not know how to manage every app's data usage, this will likely be an expensive exercise in frustration. 

The emergency number is 116. The information number is 113.

==Stay safe==

Havana is quite safe for a large city.  Heavily dependent on tourism, Cuban police are everywhere and pay special attention to spots where travelers congregate (Habana Vieja, El Malecón. etc.), so you don't have to be afraid of being accosted in the daytime. Prison sentences for crimes involving tourists are extremely harsh, a fact which residents are well aware of, which adds an extra layer of deterrence. Violent crime is rare. It is relatively safe to walk at night throughout Havana when compared to other Latin American cities, though pickpocketing and theft is common, so make sure not to leave your belongings unattended. Be wary of hustlers (jinteros/as) offering to show you a place to eat or offering a tour of the city, as you'll be stuck paying hefty prices to cover their commission. Just walk away and continue walking -- soon enough they will leave you alone. In local restaurants, ask for menus or prices before ordering anything; there can be special 'tourist price menus' that get pulled out after you have consumed food or drink.  If you're male, expect to be accosted regularly by prostitutes and/or their pimps, especially in Habana Vieja.  While technically illegal, erstwhile mandatory jail time for prostitution filled prisons so quickly that the regime had little choice but to start looking the other way. 

Beware of the frequent [http://wikitravel.org/en/Cuba#Scams scams] in Cuba.

*'''Electric train to Matanzas''' One of the oldest electric trains in the world runs four times daily from Havana to [[Matanzas]]. It was built by Hershey and runs through their decrepit chocolate town. It's like riding a metro for 92km through villages and countryside. Leaves from Casablanca across bay; there are ferries running there in calm weather. Supposedly train is unreliable, but got me to my flight on time (just!).  Cost 3CUC.
