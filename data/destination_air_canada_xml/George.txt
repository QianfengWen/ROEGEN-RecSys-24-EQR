'''George''' is situated in the [[Western Cape|Western Cape Province]] in [[South Africa]] and is the main gateway to the beautiful [[Garden Route]]. It is the sixth oldest town in South Africa and very centrally situated halfway between [[Cape Town]] and [[Port Elizabeth]]. Cradled by the Outeniqua mountains to the north and the Indian ocean to the south, George is an ideal town from which to explore the area’s many scenic attractions – be it on the Outeniqua Choo-Tjoe train, on walks and hikes on the George and Cradock Peaks, on a boat fishing, or pushing a cart across the golf courses at Fancourt. Rich in historical landmarks, such as the Slave Tree and the King Edward VII Library, George retains a small-town character without compromising on a sophisticated infrastructure. 

==Get in==

===By car===

George can be reached easily with the N2 highway from [[Cape Town]] (to the west) or [[Knysna]], [[Port Elizabeth]], [[East London]] and [[Durban]] (to the east). You can also get to George from [[Oudtshoorn]] (to the north) via the R29.

===By plane===

*'''George Airport''' ({{IATA|GRJ}}),  [http://africa.cwsurf.de/George.htm]. South African Airways[http://www.flysaa.com] operates flights to major cities in [[South Africa]], like [[Cape Town]], [[Johannesburg]] and [[Durban]]. Low-fare airlines 1Time[http://www.1time.co.za] and Kulula.com[http://www.kulula.com]  provide cheap flights to and from Johannesburg.

===By train===

The train used to run between George and [[Knysna]] (via [[Wilderness]] and [[Sedgefield]]) but the railway line was severely damaged in 2006 and 2007 due to landslides after heavy rain and extreme flooding. Sadly, repairs to this line do not seem to be happening and its future is uncertain.

===By bus===

The main bus companies serve George regularly on their way along the Garden Route from [[Cape Town]] to [[Port Elizabeth]], as does the Baz Bus[http://www.bazbus.co.za].

==Get around==

Preferably by car. York street is the main artery.  

There are permanent speed cameras;
# York Street
# Outside Duggies on Courtney Street (driving towards Knysna)
# At the robots (traffic lights) outside Pick n Pay on Courtney Street (driving towards George away from Knysna)
# In York Street close to Mei Ling (Taiwanese Restaurant)
# On way to Wilderness there are 2 cameras as you come around the turn past Far Hills Hotel
In season, over Christmas (December and early January) and Easter (April), however, there are temporary manned speed cameras everywhere.

Driving between George and Knysna there are permanent speed cameras in the Kaaimans River Pass. The speed limit on this pass is 60kmph for a reason, <b>the pass is very dangerous to take at high speeds, especially when wet.</b>
