'''Tashkent''' (Uzbek: Toshkent, Тошкент; Russian: Ташкент) is the capital city of [[Uzbekistan]], and is an ancient city on the Great [[Silk Road]] from China to Europe.  Little remains of the ancient city after the 1966 earthquake and earlier modernisation work following the 1917 revolution.  Tashkent is a very Soviet city that has little remaining from its ancient [[Central Asia|Central Asian]] past. The city has a mixture of modern new office buildings, hotels, parks and crumbling Soviet style apartment blocks.  The streets are generally clean and there are not too many potholes in the city center.  Further out, the infrastructure is not so good.

Over the last few years the Uzbek government has embarked on a major reconstruction program in the centre of the city.  Roads, government buildings and parks are all being reconstructed (many historical buildings and sites are bulldozed in the process).  To the visitor, the new city looks very impressive, although many of the local residents have yet to see any improvement in their residential areas.

Tashkent is waiting for a boom. The infrastructure, hotels and shops are there but the influx of people and business has failed to materialise.  This is caused in part by a combination of government policy and bad publicity.

==Talk==

Although [[Uzbek phrasebook|Uzbek]] is now the official language, [[Russian phrasebook|Russian]] is the native language for most Tashkent dwellers, although most also speak Uzbek. Most businesses use Russian in their signs, menus and other printed material. Only government institutions use Uzbek as the first language, and even then, many government forms and reports are in Russian, rather than Uzbek.  Currently, Uzbek uses the Latin alphabet rather than the Cyrillic that was used during the Soviet Union.  This is a source of some confusion for many Uzbeks, especially those of the older generation.  Shortly after the fall of the Soviet Union, and Uzbekistan declared independence in 1991, the written Uzbek language was converted back into Latin characters.  Many older Uzbeks have difficulty reading the Latin characters.  Uzbek is a Turkic language, and while Uzbeks and Turks cannot completely communicate directly, the better educated on both sides can usually find some common understanding.

Many of the signs in Tashkent are in Cyrillic.  A significant number of Russian words are similar to their English counterparts.  Learning the Cyrillic alphabet — which is not as difficult as one might think — will help a traveller to read signs and in restaurants. It is very useful for the casual visitor to Tashkent to learn a few basic Russian or Uzbek words and phrases. If you need to speak English, young people are your best bet, and even then there is no guarantee that they will speak more than very basic English.

The name Tashkent is usually derived from the Turkish word "tash" (stone) and the Persian word "kent" (city), meaning "city of stones". Another opinion refers to the Sogdian word "tschatsch", meaning "place on a hill".

Tashkent is the largest capital city in Central Asia and has a population of 2.3 million people (2012).

==Get in==

===By plane===
Tashkent International Airport "Yuzhniy" ({{IATA|TAS}}; {{ICAO|UTTT}}) is just a few kilometers from the city centre.  Airlines serving Tashkent include Aeroflot, Air Astana, Air Baltic, Asiana, Uzbekistan Airways and Turkish Airlines. It is also the hub of Uzbekistan Airways [http://uzairways.com/airports.aspx], which flies to many destinations including Almaty, Tokyo, Bangkok, London, and New York-JFK. All the airports in Uzbekistan have immigration posts and Uzbekistan Airways Operates direct flights from Samarkand, Bukhara, Urgench, Andijan, Fergana airports to CIS Countries.

Note that while the domestic and international terminals (terminals 3 and 2) are at the same airport the only way to get from one to the other is by road, a ten minute taxi ride [http://goo.gl/maps/Sk2fq] and see notes below about the taxi situation. A taxi should not cost more than 5000 som between the terminals, but the taxi drivers will try to cheat you. Alternatively, there are two buses that operate between both terminals, 11 and 77. 

In the international terminal, buses leave from in front of the terminal. Walk straight out, past the parking lot where the bus stops are just before the main road. In the domestic terminal, the bus stop is to the left of the terminal (walking out of the terminal) in a large parking lot that does not look like a bus stop. Note that buses do not operate at night. Pay the driver after the ride. As of June 2017, a bus ride costs 1000 som and marshrutka ride costs 1200 som.

A short and inexpensive ($2-3 USD) taxi journey is the easiest way to get to the city center. One should bear in mind, however, that upon exiting the international terminal, a large number of men will be crowded at the (sole) exit door offering "taxi" services. For the most part, these are not "official" taxis. "Taxi" drivers will attempt to charge whatever they believe an international tourist can stomach.  For those without Russian or Uzbek language skills it is best to arrange to have someone meet you at the airport. Fair fares are usually only obtainable by those who understand the system and speak at least some Russian or Uzbek. It is better to walk 50 meters from the exit towards the taxi stand where many taxis are waiting on the road and negotiate. Generally Prevailing fare is minimum 2 to 3 USD for 5km (20 cents per each additional km). Always negotiate. Taxi drivers will rarely accept small bills (dollars, euros or pounds), and cannot be counted upon to give change (in any currency). The easier option is to use Yandex Taxi (online app) for about 16,000 som (Oct 2019), or there is a taxi service in the arrivals area that will charge far higher rates (60,000 som, cash only), but put you into an official tourist car.

Trollies are limited and not readily available.  You have to buy a token to unlock the trollies.  Baggage collection is a lengthy wait - can be up to 1.5 hours.  There are only two luggage belts.  The indicator showing the belt to collect your luggage may not be correct.  It is therefore good to stay in the centre of the two luggage belt so that you can see both belts at the same time.  

Arrival customs clearance has changed a lot in recent times (as at October 2019) - No declarations forms or long lines while all bags are checked. The usual Red/Green channels to walk through. If stopped by an customs officer they'll send you to one of the x-ray machines to check bags. This seemed to happen only to returning citizens with large amounts of luggage.  Tourists mostly walked through without being stopped. You can go through the "green" corridor, without completing the customs declaration, if imported foreign currency does not exceed the equivalent of 2,000 US dollars and the cost and (or) the number of imported goods do not exceed the norms not subject to customs payments established by law or there are no goods whose import or export is prohibited or restricted in accordance with the law. The entire amount of foreign currency in cash exceeding the equivalent of 2,000 US dollars is subject to mandatory written declaration when importing and exporting. Be aware that the arrival area has a number of ATMs (in October 2019 only 1 of 4 was working, and Visa only), hence arriving with a few USD is a good idea, there are exchange banks before customs. Travellers should also be wary of the "tourist welcome desk" before customs, they may overcharge you on the SIM card (as of October 2019 the official price was 42k SOM that became 82k SOM, only found out afterwards the inflation) and offer the third placed network (UMS) that has poor reception across the country, and no 4G no matter what they claim... You are better getting SIMs in town unless you speak no Russian.

Go to the airport early and check in early, the taxi may try to charge 3000SOM (Oct '19) for an official drop-off, or walk for 50 metres for free.  The departures area is on the upper floor, however the access road has been closed, so you have to walk around the left hand side of the arrivals level and up some stairs/escalator, or up the road. You can expect fairly quick customs (unless you are searched, see below), but security can be on the slow side due to the need to take off shoes, as well as the normal laptops/electronics out.

Queue tends to form and this delay your boarding.  Inspection is regular and detailed.  They sometimes may tell you to go to a room for inspection (body search).  You need to empty all your pockets and they check (in detail) all the currencies that you are carrying. After immigration/passport control (at the boarding pass checking counter), they can still call you to go down to the check in luggage clearance area to open your luggage for checking.  The luggage clearance area has no heater and therefore good to keep a jacket with you at all time during winter.  For questionable items, you can first explain what are they and if there is a problem, you are allowed to dispose of the item at the luggage clearance area and not insist that the items are cleared.  Sometimes, simple items such as expensive chocolate may have problem clearing and have to be disposed by the custom officers doing the checking.

VIP lounge and check-in are available for ~USD 100 per person, and there's a special entrance on the right. No international vip-lounge access cards work here. Priority boarding cards issued by some airlines would save a lot of time of inorderly queueing.

The '''Uzbekistan Airways Main Ticketing office''' is located at Amir Timur Str,51. Flight tickets can also be purchased from hundreds of ticketing agents and some even offer free ticket delivery.

===By train===

All trains (both domestic and international) leave now from the '''Northern Railway Station''' (Severny Vokzal), Tukestan kochasi, Metro station "Toshkent". Make sure that you buy ticket in advance or arrive 1 hour before train departure as the queue for ticket office is often long, though appears to have improved recently (Oct '19) as there is now a formal ticketing system which has avoided most people jumping the queue. Get a ticket on arrival from a machine on the left that has English, Russian and Uzbek options. The even easier choice is to do an e-ticket, making sure you print it at home first. Alternatively you can get the ticket office to print your tickets, even if booked online, though it will take a few minutes and you need your reference numbers (mobile phone screen is acceptable).

===By car===
There are road routes from surrounding countries but the borders may not be open and there have been security problems. The border from [[Afghanistan]] is sometimes closed or not open to Uzbek nationals. A person has to walk at least 4 Km to Cross the border on Foot from Uzbek Check Post to Afghan Check Post. 

The ''Cherniaevka'' crossing from [[Kazakhstan]] near Saryagash was closed to non-Uzbeks/Kazakhs as of 10 November 2009; foreigners need to cross at ''Yallama'', 100km from Cherniaevka. Allow one or two hours to get through, especially from the Uzbek side. On 6 July 2010 we crossed at Chernaevka, so it seems to be open again for foreigners. Pretty ok, but long long lines, take the left line at the Uzbek customs, they want you to declare any cellphones as communication devices.

===By bus===

To travel by bus to Uzbekistan a traveller has to take a bus to the border post,then cross the border on foot and then take another bus to the final destination. Buses do not operate inter-country regularly, but some private operators run bus services to many CIS cities on announced dates, however it is difficult to get information, and sometimes dates can change without warning
.
Buses to other cities leave from "Avtovokzal" in the Metro station "Sobir Raximov". Buses usually are very full and advance purchase of tickets is recommended. Tickets are sold to foreigners at Movarunahr Kochasi 51, daily from 8AM to 5PM. As of 2009 buses to Bokhara (11 hrs) cost 8 USD, to Samarkand (6 hrs) 5 USD and to Urgench/Khiva (20 hrs) 12 USD.

Inter-city bus time tables, prices and distances are online.

Jan 2019. Cheapest way to travel from Tashkent city to the border for Shymkent, KZ is to take metro Green line to last stop \ Shaxriston (Habib Abdullayev). Exit building on east side and wait for bus #475 (white color) which will make a U-turn at intersection to stop at bus stop. This is its first pickup heading back to border, so it will be empty. Total cost: 2400 Som. Cross border, push past cabbies on KZ side, walk 300 meters to Matrushkas. 700 Tenge for shared van to Shymkent.

==Get around==

===By metro===

The city has a good public transport system which is cheap. The metro/underground system is typical of the old Soviet style - with large and impressive stations - and is actually quite modern.  There are also modern buses and trams many of which were renewed in 2008. Metro tickets cost 1400 soms (as of April 2022) for any single journey, regardless of distance or connections (metro only, no bus connections). It was previously not permitted to take photographs in the metro stations, however as of 2019 this is now allowed. There is a light baggage check when you enter the system, but there seems to be limited interest in checking passports now. However, previous advice was that in all cases do have documents while you are taking the metro (or anywhere in the city), for you can be checked any time (including both passport and registration slips from your hotel, though again this system has moved online as of 2019 so hotels are less worried about providing the slips). Bags will be checked upon entering the stations.

Tashkent metro has three lines:
*'''Uzbekistan (Blue line)''' from Beruniy to Chkalov, 
*'''Chilonzor (Red line)''' from Janubiy to Turkistan, 
*'''Yunus-Obod (Green line)''' from Sabir Rakhimov to Buyuk Ipak Yuli.  The trains leave every 5 minutes.

===By car===

====Taxis====
To avoid complexities on both negotiation and language, you can use the app "Yandex Taxi" to conveniently order a taxi, know the fare before you take the journey, and pay by credit card (or just cash as there are problems with some international credit cards). These drivers tend to have higher quality vehicles and are less likely to smoke or otherwise "misbehave" to keep their star ratings high. You can move around by GPS and a ride in the city tends to cost around 8000-10000 SOM (Oct '19), waiting times are typically 2 to 3 minutes from any central location.

Of course, if you choose to use traditional methods, taxis can be cheap after some negotiation, however some of the vehicles are very old. While there are official, authorized taxis (with the appropriate sign on the roof of the car), in reality almost any driver in Tashkent can double as a taxi driver. The local custom is to simply stand by the side of the road with your arm extended downward and slightly away from the body. A driver will pull over and then you will state your destination and negotiate the fare in advance. At least some Russian or Uzbek language skills is needed to accomplish this without difficulty. It is usually safe to use this procedure, although virtually every foreign embassy recommends against it. Directions are rarely given here using an address. Most often, a landmark is used, such as "near the hotel Russia,". Moreover, many streets and hotels have been renamed in the past few years but often drivers will not recognize the current name of the street or hotel, still knowing them by their old names. Asking to be taken to the Grand Mir hotel, for instance, will often result in a blank look. Tell the driver you want to go to the Gastinitsa Rossiya (Hotel Russia), however, and they will know exactly where you want to go. For those who speak neither Russian nor Uzbek, it is helpful to have someone draw a rudimentary map or write out directions in Russian. Few drivers will know English.

Do not expect western-style taxi services. Taxi drivers will often smoke while you are in the car and asking them not to will most often result in nothing more than a look of disapproval. You may be paying, but you are in their car. There are many taxi services operating in the city with fixed rates and a person can order the taxi from their hotel room. There are some web sites offering complete lists of taxi services and taxi charges.

Taxis within the city can by reserved by calling '''Taxi Express''', tel 1399999 or 16360272.

====Car rental====

None of the major international car hire companies operate in Tashkent.  Where car hire is available, it will include a driver. Generally daily car rental charges are from 25 USD to 35 USD. It all depends upon your negotiating skills. Car rentals are offered by taxi companies.  They are expensive but can be more reliable.

===Farmers Markets and Bazaars===
Local produce, such as fruit, nuts, vegetables can be very good, especially when they are in season.  In the late summer, local melons appear on the streets and in the bazaars and are tasty and very cheap.

Most local residents do their primary shopping in bazaars. There are many of them in Tashkent, the largest of which is the '''Chorsu Bazaar'''. It is huge, colorful, teeming with people and offers just about anything that can be purchased locally, from produce to locally-made furniture and hardware.  Hand-crafted items, including crockery, rugs, traditional dress, etc., are also available and far less expensive than in the shops frequented by tourists. Have a local go with you to the bazaars if possible. Foreigners are inevitably charged higher prices. [[How to haggle|Bargaining]] is common, but requires some language skills.

==="Broadway"===

'''Saligokh Street''', known locally as 'Broadway', has some street artists, etc. The street is easy to find from the Amir Temur monument, just head away from the Uzbekistan Hotel. The 'mirstore' just off of Saligokh Street has a modern supermarket, coffee bar and hugely overpriced fashion stores. This area, known locally as "Demir," also has MirBurger, which has burgers, pizza and local dishes at reasonable prices. There is also a Georgian restaurant ("Tblisi") and a Chinese restaurant. There is a heavy police (militsiya) presence here and foreigners are not often, but occasionally asked for their documents. It is advisable to keep a photocopy of your passport and visa with you, but leave the originals in the hotel safe.

{{infobox| |
From the start of September 2006, all of the outdoor shops, private sellers and restaurants have been cleared from Saligokh Street and other city parks, probably because they are unlicensed.  This has largely killed the atmosphere of the Broadway area and in many of the parks.  As of August 2007, a few of the painting sellers have returned, but are confined to a small area.}}

Recently, modern designer fashion and shops selling luxury goods from famous international brands have started to appear in Tashkent. Catering for the wealthy, these can be found in the Broadway area, Amir Temur street and Pushkin street.

==Eat==

Uzbek national dishes are similar to those of other Central Asian countries. 
*The national dish is '''Plov''' (also called Osh, Plaf, "Pulau" in Urdu). It is a mixture of rice, mild spices, yellow or orange carrots, mutton, meat, cumin (zeera) and, according to individualized recipes, occasionally other ingredients. 
*'''Shashlik''' - meat (usually mutton, beef or chicken) and chunks of fat roasted kebab style over charcoal. 
*'''Samsa''' ("Samosa" in Hindi or Urdu) are similar to South American empanadas - most commonly with meat (beef or mutton)and potato and sometimes with onion and mushrooms, encased in pastry and baked in wood-fired, clay ovens shaped like inverted beehives called tandories. 
*The local bread, round and flat, is also baked in tandories. It is called '''Non''' (or in Russian, "lepioshki,", "Naan" in Urdu) and is usually delicious. Nan from Samarkand is especially well regarded by many in Samarkand but each region takes pride in its own version of non just as it does its version of Osh.
Though the King of Uzbek food is Plov but Uzbeks feel very proud to make Sumalyak. To every body '''Sumalyak''' is a miracle sweet dish. It is made from Pure wheat and with out any addition of sweetener. The art is such that Sumalyak becomes sweet and Uzbeks take it on very special occasions. A visitor if visting Uzbekistan with a family must make it a point to see the process of making Sumalyak. Readers can find all the information in detail about making sumalyak and other Uzbek Cuisines from link [http://harleytourism.com/uzbekistan-cuisine/Miracle-soup-sumaljak.html] 
There are hundreds of small cafes in Tashkent (and other Uzbek cities and villages) offering these and other local dishes at very inexpensive prices.  A meal of salad, bread, tea, soup and shashlik at around 2-3 USD isn't difficult to find. Bear in mind that sanitation standards leave a lot to be desired in many of these cafes. Especially on warm days, look to see if the meat is kept refrigerated before it is cooked.

===Telephone number change===
During November 2007 the Tashkent telephone number plan has been changed.  The changes are complex. Some numbers that began with the number one have been changed to begin with two.  Golden Pages has a list of the changes [http://goldenpages.uz/index_eng.php?page=ats].

==Stay safe==
Tashkent is generally a very safe place to visit. However, visitors should refrain from political activities or doing anything that could be regarded as undermining the state. As anywhere, remember to watch your personal belongings.

There have been incidents of robbery, including some violent assaults but they are very rare. Travellers should use the same caution they would use in any large city, especially at night. It is not advisable for foreigners to walk around alone at night, especially in areas where few people are about and/or lighting is poor.

As for November 2015, unofficial night-time curfew has been lifted, but try to avoid walking around at night. Try to avoid police officers at night. They will try to extort money from you. It is OK to ask for directions and other information from police officers during the day time however. 

Avoid confrontations of any kind. If you witness a confrontation, especially in a crowded area such as a bazaar, move away.

Concerning food: in hot summer days try to avoid dairy products, mushrooms or any products that might be damaged by heat. You might want to avoid fish unless you are sure it has been well stored.

==Cope==
The local currency is the '''Uzbek Sum (or Som)'''. There are bank notes of  100, 200, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000 and 50000SOM.
Although the most common is the 5000SUM banknote, the times where you paid with stacks of money are basically over but you will still be carrying a lot of banknotes. Expect problems with change from some vendors and taxis, so try to keep a variety of notes with you and get the 50,000SOM changed at museums or larger shops. Note that many places will round down and avoid giving you change of less than 1000SOM, only the metro in Tashkent seems to give the 100 and 200 coins, that are essentially useless but would make nice souvenirs.

'''According to a new law, from 2017 year you can pay for accommodation only in freely convertible currency basically in US Dollars. Sometimes in Euros - depends on hotel, though many will be happy to accept SOM payments as well. Also you may pay by credit cards, though the machines may not always work.'''

Changing currency is no longer an issue sice the devaluation of the official rate. Nowadays (Jan 2018) you can change at any bank for a better rate than at the black market ($1=8200SUM, 1€=9870SUM). If you do decide to exchange on the black market (only US$ or Euros), around Chorsu and Oloy bazaar are the places. Some hotels. US dollars can fetch a good rate but other acceptable currencies are Euros, British pounds, Russian rubles or Japanese Yen. Notes must be in perfect condition with no marks or damage.Few ATM's (known as Bankomat) work with foreign cards.  US dollars are available inside banks using international credit cards with commission of about 2%. The dollars can then be changed to local currency.  Newer shops and hotels are accepting credit cards and Maestro.

The AKB "Kapitalbank" at 7 Sailgokh Street near The Broadway has competitive rates to change cash, and English speaking staff.  They are competent in a few currencies, whereas most money changers deal with USD only. 
There are currency vending machines installed inside arrival halls in the airport before immigration. These machines give quite decent conversion rates on USD and euro and could be a reliable option to convert some dollars for the initial few days. Rates in the bank counters in the city or the counters in the airport weren't much better, and also they insist for very clean dollar bills with no marks or writings or dirt on them.
It is important to keep your currency conversion receipts incase you plan to convert them back to dollars, without which they will plainly refuse to give you foreign currency. Also no currency conversion options are there in the airport departure area after check-in is done.

Directly opposite the main Train Station is the Uzpromstroy Bank with ATM offering USD and Som.

The international arrivals terminal at Tashkent Airport has a number of change machines and ATMs, although most were out of cash (September 2019) or didn't work (October 2019), so it's a good idea to bring some cash to change.  The information desk will sell a tourist SIM card (8GB for around 84,000 Som), though the official price is actually 42,000 Som and it is for the third place network, USM, which has a poor quality signal in many of the key cities (not even 3G, 4G is a distant dream). However if you don't speak Russian the overpricing can be overridden by the convenience, and you can save that money by using the Yandex Taxi app from the airport rather than negotiating with the taxi touts. Or ask for a receipt :)
