'''Ancona''' [http://www.comune.ancona.it/] is the capital of the [[Italy|Italian]] region called [[Marche]]. It is an important port city on the coast of the Adriatic Sea. Most of its medieval center was bombed during World War II. Its '''cathedral''', however, is set on the mountain overlooking Ancona and still worth a look. There is also a monument built by Mussolini on the waterfront. It offers glorious vistas on the coastline with mainly flat sandy beaches. The popular resorts of [[Portonovo]], [[Sirolo]], and [[Santa Maria di Badia]] are at the Mount's base. 

Many ferries link Ancona, and therefore Italy, to [[Croatia]], [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]].

The archway, only 3 m wide, is flanked by pairs of fluted Corinthian columns on pedestals. An attic bears inscriptions.
