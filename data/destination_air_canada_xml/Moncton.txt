==Get out==
'''Hopewell Rocks''' - Walk on the Ocean floor thanks to the [[Bay of Fundy]]'s high tides (second highest in the world.) Truly a fabulous sight. Bring your camera. Get there within three hours on either side of low tide to see the islands best. (Kayaking is also available if the tide's high). A nice 10-minute walk through the woods takes you to a large stairwell to the ocean floor, where you can easily walk among a half-dozen enormous (30 meters+ high) columns of fir tree-topped sandstone islands. A golf-cart shuttle can whisk you back to the park information facility, which features a good explanation of how the islands came to be, a snack bar and gift shop. The ride from Moncton is about 45 minutes. Entrance to ''Fundy National Park'' is another 30 minutes but definitely worthwhile in good weather.

*'''[[Fredericton]]''' - historic capital of New Brunswick.
*'''Fundy National Park''' [http://www.pc.gc.ca/pn-np/nb/fundy/index_E.asp] - offers great hiking and camping.
