'''[https://www.city.sendai.jp/ Sendai]''' (仙台市) is the largest city in the [[Tohoku]] region of [[Japan]]'s [[Honshu]] island. As of April 2021, Sendai had a population of approximately 1,089,000 people.

==Understand==
Sendai is divided into five districts: Aoba-ku, Izumi-ku, Miyagino-ku, Taihaku-ku and Wakabayashi-ku.
[[Image:499301229_d36e56d51c.jpg|thumb|350px|Sendai]]  
As everyone here will tell you, "it's not too big and not too small, it's very convenient and it's close to both the sea and the mountains."
Sendai is a comfortable and pleasant city &mdash; it's a nice place to live. It's very green &mdash; in fact they call it 杜の都 (''Mori no Miyako'', "Forest City"). The main avenues around the city are wide and tree-lined, giving the city an almost European feel. The main shopping street &mdash; confusingly known by two different names, Chūō-dōri (中央通り) and Clis Road &mdash; is pedestrianised and covered, so it feels like a mall.  Several large universities are located in Sendai, attracting young adults from throughout the Tohoku area.
 
===History===
Although there is evidence of settlements in the Sendai region dating back over 20,000 years, it was not until the local feudal ruler, Date Masamune, moved his capital here in 1600 that the city began to take on any signifance. He established a fine castle on Aobayama (green leaf mountain) and the town that was built below the castle near the Hirose River was built according to the traditional street grid pattern. The original name of the area was also Sendai, but the Chinese characters for this name were changed. Originally they referred to a temple on Aobayama that housed a thousand Buddha statues. Later, Date Matsume changed the Chinese characters to mean 'hermit on a platform,' which referred to a mythical palace in the mountains in China.  It is this latter name that is currently used by the present-day city. On March 11, 2011, the city suffered catastrophic damage due to the magnitude 9.0 2011 Great East Japan Quake, the largest ever to hit the country and the 4th largest ever, whose epicenter was 130 km to the east of the city, in the Pacific Ocean. The earthquake caused a devastating tsunami that flooded Sendai. Together, the earthquake and subsequent tsunami killed nearly 20,000 people on the country's north-east coast.

===Climate===
Sendai is not too cold in the winter and not too hot in the summer, compared to other Japanese cities to the south. 

Winter temperatures rarely dip below zero Celsius, and snow, though frequent in winter, melts quickly. Winter weather is very rainy, yielding to variable weather in Spring. There is a long rainy season, marked by consistently cool and cloudy weather, which typically coincides with the month of June, but has been known to set in right after the cherry-blossom blooms in April and to continue through July, and even August. 

When (and if) the rainy season ends, Summer weather is very hot and humid, until September, which brings typhoon season. Most of the typhoons do little damage, having dissipated somewhat on their travel north, but fall on Sendai as very heavy rainstorms, following one another in close succession. 

For those who prefer dry sunny weather, Autumn is the most reliable time for pleasant conditions in Sendai. In October, the weather becomes clear, dry and sunny, though cool, usually throughout the month and sometimes well into November. Daytime temperatures hover around 18C, with cooler nights. Rice harvesting is done at this time, while the fields are golden.

==Get in==
===By train===
Most travelers will arrive in Sendai by train. Sendai is the largest station on the Tohoku Shinkansen (bullet train) which runs from [[Tokyo]] to [[Aomori]]. By the fastest service, it is just over 90 minutes from each.

When searching for trains to Sendai, note that there is a second Sendai station in Kagoshima, so be careful to select the JR Sendai station in Miyagi.

The fastest service is the '''Hayabusa''' (はやぶさ) services which takes 90 minutes from Tokyo and runs at least once an hour (this is the fastest train currently in service in Japan). This train runs non-stop between Ōmiya (just outside of Tokyo) and Sendai. This is an all reserve service, but seats are generally available on short notice outside of peak hours and holidays. The service is covered by the JR Pass and JR East Pass, but otherwise costs ¥11,410 from Tokyo. You may also want to note that the '''Komachi''' (こまち) service bound for [[Akita]] operates on trains which are linked to the Hayabusa until Morioka (after Sendai), the trains are slightly narrower but are otherwise the same service. If you ask for a ticket on a Hayabusa train, you may be issued a ticket for the Komachi, but as long as the destination is Sendai, you need not be concerned.

There is also a slower '''Yamabiko''' (やまびこ) service taking 115-135 minutes from Tokyo depending on the number of stops. This train runs two or three times an hour, and it does not require seat reservations. The cost for an ordinary seat is ¥10,560 (adult, unreserved).

It may be worth noting that the Tohoku Shinkansen also runs Nasuno and Tsubasa services, but these trains do not go to Sendai.

===By plane===
'''[https://www.sendai-airport.co.jp/en/ Sendai Airport]''' (SDJ) mainly functions as a domestic airport with regular flights to [[Sapporo]], [[Nagoya]], [[Osaka]], [[Hiroshima]], [[Fukuoka]], [[Okinawa]] and [[Kanazawa]] (Komatsu). However, there are also a few international flights to neighboring countries, such as [[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]], and [[China]], and there is also a flight to [[Bangkok]] in Thailand.

The airport is linked to the city with the [https://www.senat.co.jp/en/top Sendai Airport Access] railway, which takes 17-25 minutes to JR Sendai Station and costs ¥660.

===By bus===
Many highway buses run to Sendai from various locations in the Tohoku region. 

JR Bus Tohoku and Tohoku Kyuko bus operate highway bus service to Sendai from [[Tokyo/Shinjuku|Shinjuku Station]] in Tokyo. There are five daytime trips and one overnight trip. Each run takes 5½ hours at a cost of ¥6210. 

An overnight bus service also runs directly from [[Yokohama]] and [[Tokyo/Shinagawa|Shinagawa]], costing ¥6500 from Yokohama (6½ hours) and ¥6200 from Shinagawa (5¾ hours).

Kintetsu runs an overnight bus service, the ''Forest'', from [[Osaka]] and [[Kyoto]] to Sendai. The one-way ride costs approximately ¥12,000 and takes 12¼ hours from Osaka and 10 3/4 hours from Kyoto.

'''[http://www.willerexpress.com Willer Express]''' is a company with nightly bus services to Sendai from Tokyo.  With English online booking service.

Meitetsu runs an over night bus service from Sendai to Nagoya. Departure time is 9:30 PM and arrival in Nagoya is 7 AM.

===By boat===
'''Taiheiyo Ferry''' (太平洋フェリー) [http://www.taiheiyo-ferry.co.jp/] (Japanese) +81-22-259-0211. Offers overnight car ferries to [[Nagoya]] (21 hrs 40 mins) and [[Tomakomai]]  (in southern [[Hokkaido]]) (15 hrs 20 mins) on the SS Ishikari and SS Kitakami. [http://www.nptc.or.jp/ferry/index.html] (Japanese). 

Getting there: Ferry terminal is located a ten minute taxi ride away from Nakanosakae Station (中野栄駅) on the JR Senseki line (仙石線). The terminal is also located not far from the Sendai-ko kita （仙台港北) interchange on the Sendai Tobu Highway (仙台東部道路). For further details, check out the ferry website [http://www.taiheiyo-ferry.co.jp/noriba/sendai.html] (Japanese)

==Get around==
===By subway===
Sendai has two subway lines; the Namboku (literally "south-north") line, which connects major shopping districts with Sendai station, and the Tōzai ("east-west") line, which opened in 2015. Key stations on the Namboku line include '''Sendai''' for the overground train station and the AER building, '''Nagamachi-minami''' for the Mall (large American-style shopping mall including multi-screen cinema), '''Hirose-dori''' and '''Kotodai-koen''' for access to Ichibancho (covered shopping arcade), and '''Izumi-chuo''' for the soccer stadium. The only station at which you can transfer from one line to the other is Sendai.

===By bus===
Adventurous types can try the bus system to reach those areas not covered by the subway.  There are a few resources that help english speakers navigate, but it helps if you know the city (or at least some Japanese, as most stops has route maps). In this case it might become very convenient and far-reaching service, as many points in the city are reachable only by bus or car. However, in some places buses are infrequent, with waiting times up to half an hour, and they tend to get ''very'' crowded in the rush hour.

Fortunately for tourists there is a "Loople Sendai" [http://www.kotsu.city.sendai.jp/english/bus/loople/index.html] bus that makes a wide loop around to various Sendai attractions for &yen;600 for a whole day, or &yen;250 for one ride. Normal route buses have fares based on the distance travelled and usually cost from &yen;170 (the basic fare) to &yen;300 for some longest journeys.

Travelcards (commony called "bus cards" both in English and Japanese, although they could be also used on subway) are available, offering slight discount -- &yen;5,000 card has &yen;5,850-worth of fare on it. There are two major bus companies, but for all practical intents and purposes they are indistinguishable.

===On foot===
The city center is compact and can easily be traversed on foot, especially by using the covered shopping arcades. There are many shops and arcades around Sendai station and therefore people could walk around on their own. Other parts of the city are quite hilly (even the center has some significant slopes) and while they still could be traversed on foot, this might be physically demanding. Residential parts are also very spread-out, and walking such large distances becomes impractical.
