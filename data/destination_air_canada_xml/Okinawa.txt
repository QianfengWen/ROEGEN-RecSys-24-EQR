[http://www.ocvb.or.jp/index.php '''Okinawa'''] (沖縄) is one of the 47 prefectures of [[Japan]] and is a chain of islands far to the south-west of [[Kyushu]].

==Understand==
[[Image:Syurei-Gate Syuri-Castle OKinawa Japan.jpg|thumb|Syurei-Mon (Syurei Gate, Syuri Castle) [[Naha]]]]
The name '''Okinawa''' means "rope in the open sea", a fairly apt description of this long stretch of islands between the four main islands of Japan and Taiwan. Consisting of 49 inhabited islands and 111 uninhabited islands, Okinawa has a subtropical/tropical climate. Unlike the other Japanese subtropical/tropical islands such as [[Ogasawara Islands]], [[Amami Islands]] and [[Tokara Islands]], there are frequent flights from all the major cities of Japan, which helps Okinawa remain one of the major tourist destinations for the Japanese. Every year there are more and more foreign visitors going to Okinawa but the number still remains low compared to the tourist destinations on mainland Japan.
  
===History===
The oldest evidence of human existence on the Okinawa Islands, ''Ryūkyū''' (琉球) dates back to the Paleolithic era [http://ao.jpn.org/kuroshio/yamashitacho/200306.htm]. Agricultural societies began in the 8th century. Since the islands are located in the center of the East China Sea, the Ryūkyū Kingdom became a prosperous trading nation, working as a bridge between Japan, China, and Southeast Asia. The Ryūkyū Kingdom had a tributary relationship with the Chinese Empire beginning in the 15th century.
In 1609, [[Satsuma]] (modern-day [[Kagoshima]]) invaded the Ryūkyū Kingdom. The Ryūkyū Kingdom was obliged to form a tributary relationship with the Satsuma and the Tokugawa shogunate while maintaining its previous tributary relationship with China; Ryukyuan sovereignty was maintained since complete annexation would have created a conflict with China. The Satsuma clan imposed punitive taxes on the Ryūkyū Kingdom and earned considerable profits from trades with China during a period in which foreign trade was heavily restricted by the shogunate. 

Though Satsuma maintained strong influence over the islands, the Ryūkyū Kingdom maintained a considerable degree of domestic political freedom for over two hundred years. In 1872 during Meiji Restoration, the Japanese government, through military incursions, officially annexed the kingdom and renamed it Ryukyu han which became Okinawa Prefecture of Japan in 1879. 
The Japanese government carried out linguistic and cultural assimilation throughout the Meiji era[http://leo.aichi-u.ac.jp/~kagamisemi/repo/oguri.html][http://kaken.nii.ac.jp/d/p/13372003/2003/6/en.ja.html].
In 1912, Okinawans obtained the right to vote to send representatives to the national Diet which had been established in 1890.

During World War II, heavy bombardment and suicidal Japanese tactics, including the use of civilians as human shields, killed 120,000 Okinawans, or one-fourth of their population at the Battle of Okinawa. Post-war they remained under U.S. occupation until 1972, and there remain several large American military bases on Okinawa Island. There have been a number of protests against the presence of the US military, usually after a high-profile crime committed by a service member. However, the US bases contribute to the economy of Okinawa main island. 5.3% of the Gross Prefectural Profit of Okinawa comes from the business-related with the US bases [http://www.pref.okinawa.jp/site/chijiko/kichitai/documents/kadai_1.pdf].

===Culture===
[[Image:Ishigaki_Shiisa.JPG|thumb|Shīsa guardian lion, [[Ishigaki]]]]

With their very divergent dialects and customs, Okinawans still maintain their cultural identity somewhat distinct from that of the mainlanders. The Ryūkyūan languages (of which Okinawan has the most speakers) [[Wikipedia:Ryukyuan languages]] [[Wikipedia:Okinawan language]] are closely related to Japanese, but are considered by most linguists to be separate languages—although the Japanese government regards them as dialects of Japanese. Okinawans call themselves ''uchinanchu'' (沖縄人) or "sea people" in Okinawan, and talk of the way things are done on the ''shima'' (島) or island(s), in contrast to the ways of the mainland, known as ''hontō'' (本島) in standard Japanese,  ''yamato'' (ヤマト) in Okinawan, and sometimes as the slightly derisive local slang ''naichi'' (内地).

Okinawa's most famous export worldwide is the martial art of '''karate'''.  In recent years Okinawan culture has become quite popular throughout Japan thanks to popular musicians and local foods. Okinawan music is very attractive and unique because of the mixture of original Okinawan sounds and American rock, jazz. The distinctive instrument of choice is the ''sanshin'' (三線), a three-stringed, banjo-like distant relative of the mainland's ''shamisen'', whose pentatonic melodies are instantly recognizable.  The island has produced a disproportionate amount of musicians, most famously J-pop singer Namie Amuro, and The Boom's　electric-guitar-and-sanshin ''Shimauta'' ("Island Song") has been dubbed Okinawa's unofficial national anthem &mdash; even though the group actually hails from the mainland [[Yamanashi]].

On the roof or at the gate of almost every house you will spot the ubiquitous Okinawan ''shīsa'' or guardian lion-dogs, one with its mouth open to catch good fortune, the other with its mouth closed to keep the good fortune in.

Most of the Okinawa islands belong to the subtropical climate (Tarama Island, [[Yaeyama Islands]] and Okidaito Island belong to the tropical climate). Even in January and February, the average high temperature is around 20&deg;C (68&deg;F), making the area a popular winter getaway, although it's often cloudy and usually a little too cold for sunbathing due to the winter monsoon. Spring, around late March and April, is an excellent time to visit if you take care to avoid Golden Week (a succession of national holidays from the end of April), however, it does not get busy at all on the small islands even during Golden Week. The rainy season starts early in May and continues until June. Unlike the rainy season in mainland Japan, it rains neither every day nor all day long during the rainy season in Okinawa. Summer in Okinawa is hot and humid but still one of the peak visiting seasons, while September brings a higher chance of typhoons. October and November are again good times to visit.

Apr - June: '''Rainy season'''
June - Nov: '''Typhoon season'''

==Cities==
*[[Naha]] - the capital of the Okinawa Prefecture
*[[Chatan]] - some resort hotels and beaches
*[[Okinawa City|Okinawa (City)]] - the second-largest city 
*[[Nago]] - famous for okinawa churaumi aquarium

==Other destinations==
[[Image:Japan Okinawa map.png|500px|thumb|right|Map of Okinawa prefecture]]

===[[Okinawa Islands]]===
From the northern end of the chain near [[Amami Islands]] of [[Kyushu]] to the southern end near [[Taiwan]], Okinawa's major islands are:
*[[Okinawa Island]] (''Okinawa-hontō'') &mdash; the largest island in both size and population, featuring administrative capital [[Naha]]
* [[Ie]]
* [[Ikei]]
* [[Hamahiga]]
* [[Kumejima]]

* [[Kerama Islands]] &mdash; a cluster of small coral islands between Kume and Okinawa
** [[Akajima]] &mdash; popular holiday spot in the Kerama Islands
* [[Tokashiki]] &mdash; snorkeling and diving oasis, the largest island of Kerama
* [[Zamami]] &mdash; popular among snorkelers and divers, with several deserted islands within 10 mins by taxi boat. 

===[[Daito Islands|Daito Islands]]===
small inhabited islands several hundred kilometers to the east
* [[Kitadaito]] &mdash; the easternmost island in the prefecture.
* [[Minamidaito]] &mdash; the largest of the Daitos
===[[Sakishima Islands]]===
* [[Miyako Islands]] &mdash; tourists are usually most interested in the natural monuments found here
** [[Irabu]] &mdash; the "other island" of Miyako
** [[Miyako (Okinawa)|Miyako]] &mdash; by far the largest of the three main islands that make up the group
** [[Shimoji]] &mdash; very close to Irabu, but not quite as large
** [[Tarama]] &mdash; known for its August festival

* [[Yaeyama Islands]] &mdash; closer to Taiwan than the mainland Okinawa
** [[Hateruma]] &mdash; the southernmost inhabited point of Japan
** [[Hatoma]]
** [[Ishigaki]] &mdash; the hub of the Yaeyamas, with spectacular beaches and manta rays
** [[Iriomote]] &mdash; jungles and the mysterious Iriomote wild cat
** [[Taketomi]] &mdash; small island off Ishigaki, known for a carefully restored Ryukyu village
** [[Yonaguni]] &mdash; the westernmost point of Japan, with mysterious ruins and hammerhead sharks
** [[Kuro]] &mdash; tiny island mildly famous for having (way) more cows than people

In addition, the [[Amami Islands]] to the north, while administratively a part of [[Kyushu]], are geographically and culturally close to Okinawa.

==Get in==
===By plane===
Most visitors arrive in [[Naha]], the capital of Okinawa. Domestic flights do connect major Japanese cities directly to some other Okinawan islands like [[Miyako (Okinawa)|Miyako]] and [[Ishigaki]], but prices can be steep; for example, the standard one-way fare for [[Tokyo]]-[[Ishigaki]] is a whopping &yen;50,000.  Using international airspace like Star Alliance's '''Visit Japan''' or JAL's '''Welcome to Japan''', both of which allow domestic flights in Japan for &yen;12,000, may allow considerable savings.
Numerous discount airlines now offer flights to Naha from the main cities in mainland Japan offering much cheaper options to visit Okinawa.  SkyMark, JetStar, and others offer flights from Tokyo and other major cities in Japan to Naha.
Low-cost airlines such as [http://www.airasia.com/ Air Asia Japan] and [http://www.flypeach.com/ Peach Aviation] now fly between Okinawa (Naha) and Tokyo Narita, Osaka Kansai respectively.

Most Japanese airlines do offer deep discounts, but they MUST be bought in advance.  On the airline websites, these fares are given names such as "Ultra SAKITOKU Advanced Purchase Fare", which is a JAL fare only available to purchase at least 75 days before the flight. This one-way Tokyo-Okinawa fare is just &yen;11,990.  For &yen;1,000 more, you can upgrade to a J class fare, which will give you a larger seat at the front of the plane.

===By ship===
Ferry services to Okinawa have been cut drastically in the last few years, with Arimura Sangyo filing for bankruptcy and RKK Line stopping passenger services entirely.  With long travel times, bumpy seas, frequent cancellations in the fall typhoon season, and prices that aren't any cheaper than flying, it's easy to see why this isn't too popular anymore.

As of November 2008, the only survivors are '''A-Line Ferry''' [http://www.aline-ferry.com], aka ''Maru-A'' (マルエー), which runs twice a week from [[Kagoshima]] (25 hours, &yen;16,000 2nd class one-way) and once a week from [[Osaka]]/[[Kobe]] to [[Naha]], and '''Marix Line''' [http://www.marix-line.co.jp], which runs between Kagoshima and Naha only.  All ferries call at various minor islands including [[Yoron]] and [[Amami Oshima]] along the way.  Note that if you don't speak Japanese, you will find it easier to book through a travel agent.

In additional, Star Cruises [http://www.starcruises.com/] operates irregular cruises from [[Keelung]], [[Taiwan]] to [[Naha]] via [[Ishigaki]] and [[Miyako (Okinawa)|Miyako]].  The service operates in the summer months only (June-Sep) and is not available all year.

==Get around==  
Ferry and air connections link the islands together, but many of them are simply so small in population that scheduled services may be infrequent and prices vary. 

===By plane===
Flights between the islands are mostly handled by '''Japan Transocean Air''' (JTA; [http://www.jal.co.jp/jta/]) and its subsidiary '''Ryukyu Air Commuter''' (RAC), both owned by JAL.  ANA's subsidiary '''Air Nippon''' (ANK) also has a limited network radiating out from [[Naha]].  If you plan on traveling extensively in the region by plane, consider JTA's '''Churashima Kippu''', which gets you five JTA/RAC flights of your choice for &yen;35,000. Direct flights from Singapore by Jetstar Asia will begin from 17 Nov 17

===By ferry===
There are dense webs of ferry links between nearby islands, but only infrequent cargo boats ply lengthier routes like [[Naha]]-[[Ishigaki]].  If traveling by boat in late summer, note that the area around Okinawa is known as '''Typhoon Alley''' for a reason.

===By Rental Car===

The legal driving age in Okinawa is '''18'''.

Rental cars are easily available at many locations, including the airport. Be prepared to drive on the left side of the road and to show your International Drivers License. You will need to obtain your International Drivers License before you enter Japan. Military and other SOFA personnel may obtain driving privileges via their own installation procedures.

===By Public Bus===
Public buses are available to almost all locations on Okinawa. Times and routes (usually in both English and Japanese) are indicated at each bus stop and at the various bus terminals. Prices outside of Naha are based on distance travel and are indicated in the front of the bus as it moves from sector to sector (your ticket, which you take as you enter the bus, has a sector number on it). Prices are not cheap and may cost in excess of 2000 yen to go from Naha to the Aquarium at the northwest point of the island. There is a changer for 1000 yen bills and coins at the front of the bus.

Consider using a private tour bus company as the return fare on the city bus (5600￥) costs more than an entire tour day (5000￥) including admission to the aquarium. Tours begin at around 8am and can be arranged by going to the Naha Bus Station at the Asahabashi monorail stop.

==See==
[[Image:Village_Houses.JPG|thumb|Traditional houses, [[Taketomi]]]]

Most people come to Okinawa for the '''sun and beaches'''.  Even in midwinter, when many areas of mainland Japan teeter around the freezing point, temperatures rarely dip below 15&deg;C in Okinawa.  For more adventurous types, the vast yet almost uninhabited island of [[Iriomote]] is covered in dense jungle.

Cultural attractions are rather more limited, as the Japanese invasion and subsequent brutal colonization coupled with fighting in World War II did a regrettably thorough job of eliminating most traces of the Ryukyu Kingdom, but three standouts are the newly rebuilt '''Shuri Castle''' [http://oki-park.jp/shurijo-park/english/] in [[Naha]] on [[Okinawa Island]], '''Nakagusuku Castle''' [https://www.nakagusuku-jo.jp/en], and the carefully preserved tiny village of [[Taketomi]] in the southern [[Yaeyama Islands]].

Historical sites related to World War II can be found throughout the islands, especially the main island of [[Okinawa (island)|Okinawa]], including the Peace Memorial Park in [[Naha]], the navy's former underground headquarters, and the Himeyuri Monument.

Churaumi Aquarium is a world-class aquarium located on the Motobu peninsula. Attractions include one of the world’s largest tanks with huge whale sharks and manta rays. The aquarium is located in Ocean Expo Park with a beautiful public facility called Emerald Beach.

Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST) is a kind research institute located in Onna, its ancient castle-like architecture, carefully crafted hallways, and amazing views of the East China sea make it a very unique destination.

==Do==
[[Image:Underwater yaeyama okinawa Japan.jpg|thumb|Snorkeling around [[Hatoma]] Island]]
=== Watersports ===
Okinawa is the best place in Japan for all sorts of watersports.

===Diving===
The Okinawa archipelago is known as one of the world's best diving destinations, having a number of coral species and marine lives as large as those in the Great Barrier Reef of Australia. You can find over 400 types of corals, 5 types of sea turtles, manta rays, whale sharks, hammerhead sharks and many kinds of tropical fish.  The main downside is that's quite expensive compared to, say, [[South-East Asia]] &mdash; a whole day's diving off a boat (2-3 dives including insurance and lunch) costs between &yen;15,000 and &yen;25,000, depending on the season and island, plus an additional cost between &yen;4,000 and &yen;5,000 if you need gear rental. For a 3-day certification course you will need to pay between &yen;50,000 and &yen;70,000, depending on the season and number of participants. Fortunately, a lot of the diving on Okinawa can be done from the shore (no boat needed), in which case you can get full gear rental and tanks for around &yen;5,000, or if you just need tanks (and can guide yourself) then it will only be around &yen;500 per tank. To top it off many shops do not accept credit cards, so you will need to carry a thick wad of yen to pay for it all.  The language barrier can also be an issue, with most shops only set up to cater to Japanese-speaking tourists, although Piranha Divers Okinawa [http://www.piranha-divers.jp] and Onna Sensui Diving Shop [http://www.onnasensui.com] in Onna Village, Reef Encounters [http://www.reefencounters.org] in [[Chatan]] [[Okinawa Island]], and Umicōza on [[Ishigaki]] are welcome exceptions.

{{infobox|Diving glossary|Most Japanese diving terminology is imported straight from English (''finzu'', ''masuku'', ''regyurētā'', etc), but the following terms are not:
* 潜る ''moguru'' &mdash; to dive; note that dives are counted with –本 (''hon'')
* 器材 ''kizai'' &mdash; equipment
* 水中 ''suichū'' &mdash; underwater
* 水深 ''suishin'' &mdash; depth
* 浅い/深い ''asai/fukai'' &mdash; shallow/deep
* 流れ ''nagare'' &mdash; current
* 安全停止 ''anzen teishi'' &mdash; safety stop
* 潜航 ''senkō'' &mdash; descent
* 浮上　''fujō'' &mdash; ascent
* 珊瑚 ''sango'' &mdash; coral
}}

If all this does not put you off, there is some world-class diving to look forward to: particular highlights include the '''gorgeous reefs''' surrounding the [[Kerama Islands]], the '''manta rays''' of [[Miyako (Okinawa)|Miyako]] and [[Ishigaki]] and the '''hammerhead sharks''' and '''underwater ruins''' of [[Yonaguni]].  The waters are generally divable ''all year'', although water temperature fluctuates between 22&deg;C in the winter to around 29&deg;C in summer. Also, beware of the typhoons during June-November and the north wind that may frequently close diving sites in the north shores of many of the islands during November and December.  Many people dive in boardshorts and rashguards half the year. Most Japanese divers wear a 5mm full-body wetsuit, and dive shops usually provide aluminum tanks with American-style fittings.

=== Snorkeling ===
Snorkeling is better on the small islands than on Okinawa Island. Especially [[Tokashiki]] is ideal for a day trip from Naha with ferries leaving in the morning and returning in the evening.

===Sailing===
Sailing is gaining in popularity in Okinawa. There is a small but passionate international sailing community centered at Ginowan Marina, near the Convention Center. Local and international sailors cruise and race to the Kerama islands and to other locations. Sailing cruises and classes are also conducted out of Ginowan Marina.

===Surfing===
Surfing is popular in Okinawa, but it's not particularly easy: waves break over very shallow shelves of reef and/or basaltic rock, resulting in challenging waves.  Surfing spots can be found all over the archipelago, but most surfers surf off the [[Okinawa Island|main island]].  Check out [http://mensoresurfing.com/index.html Mensore Surfing] for weather forecasts and up-to-date info.

===Fishing===
[[Image:bullmahiincoming2.jpg|right|thumb|Bull mahi]]

Okinawa has some of the best '''offshore fishing''' in the world. Some fish are seasonal, but there are fish for every season of the year. Marlin, mahi mahi, and various species of tuna are some of the fish that are teeming in Okinawa's crystal clear seas. There are many places where you can find a boat to go fishing, but as with diving, language can be a major issue. Some charter services provide fishing tackle, and others require you to rent fishing gear. The 2008-2009 Issue of "Okinawa Island Guide" has featured Saltwater Fishing Okinawa for catering to Japanese, English, and Chinese speaking travelers. 

The cost for offshore fishing in Okinawa is comparable to other charter services around the world. Usually about $100 US Dollars per person for walk on charters, and up to $1,500 US Dollars for private charters.

==Eat==
Okinawan cuisine is distinctly different from that of mainland Japan and bears notable Taiwanese influences.  Okinawans too proudly proclaim that they use every part of the pig except the squeal and '''pork''' makes an appearance in almost every dish, including bits like ears, trotters and blood which are generally disdained by the Japanese. Even Spam has a distinct following.

Other Okinawan ingredients include vegetables rarely seen on the Japanese mainland such as '''bitter melon''' (ゴーヤー; ''gōyā'') and '''purple yam''' (紫芋; ''murasaki-imo''). Okinawan tropical fruits including '''mango''', '''papaya''', '''pineapple''', '''dragonfruit''' and the sour lime-like '''calamansi''' (シークァーサー; ''shīkwāsā'') are delicious when in season.  '''Dark cane sugar''' (黒砂糖 ; ''kurosatō'') is also a popular snack, eaten both as is and made into a vast variety of candies and pastries.

</gallery>

Some dishes worth trying:
*''Gōyā champurū'' (ゴーヤーチャンプルー) is a stir-fried dish made from ''goya'' mixed with pork and tofu. 
*''Gurukun'' (グルクン) is no less than the official fish of Okinawa prefecture. Small but tasty and prepared in a variety of ways, even the bones are edible.
*''Hirayāchī'' (ヒラヤーチー), an okonomiyaki-like thin savory pancake
*''Raftī'' (ラフティー) is a side dish consisting of ''very'' fatty cubes of stewed pork.
*''Sātāandagī'' (サーターアンダギー) are deep-fried balls of dough also aptly known as Okinawan donuts.
*''Sōki soba'' (ソーキそば) is an Okinawan noodle soup with fatty cubes of roasted pork.

Okinawan ''chinmi'' or "strange foods", eaten as snacks with drinking, include:
* ''Chiragā'' (チラガー), the skin from a pig's face; can be very chewy
* ''Mimigā'' (ミミガー), sliced pork ears in vinegar; crunchy and nearly tasteless
* ''Umibudō'' (海ぶどう) or "sea grapes", a type of seaweed eaten raw dipped into vinegar or soy, mild with a pleasant caviar-like texture
* ''Sukugarasu'' (スクガラス), salt-pickled tiny fermented fish, usually pressed onto tofu before eating

Aficionados of '''American fast food''' may find Okinawa to be a curious treat, as many American restaurants popped up here to serve the US military long before they made it to the mainland.  Most prominent is the presence of '''A&W''' outlets serving hamburgers and '''root beer''' (with free refills, even), available practically nowhere else in Japan. '''Foremost''' ice cream (under the "Blue Seal" brand) is also common.  Several hybrid Okinawan-American dishes, most of which seem to employ copious quantities of '''Spam''', are widely available:

*''Nuuyaru burger'' (ぬーやるバーガー), a specialty of local fast-food chain '''Jef''' [http://www.yonabaru.jp/kigyo/jef.htm], is gōyā champurū, cheese and a slice of Spam in a bun.  Appropriately enough, the name is an Okinawan pun that translates roughly as "What on earth is this?".
*''Pork eggs'' (ポーク卵 ''pōku tamago'') consists of fried slices of Spam served with ketchup, scrambled eggs and &mdash; since this ''is'' Japan, after all &mdash; rice and miso soup.
*''Taco rice'' (タコライス ''tako raisu'') is spiced Mexican-style taco meat with cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes, but instead of being in a tortilla, it's on rice.

==Drink==
The local brew of choice is '''''awamori''''' (泡盛), a notoriously strong rice liquor that can contain up to 60% alcohol.  Unlike Japanese shochu, which is usually prepared from potatoes or barley, awamori is brewed using imported Thai jasmine rice since during the days of the Ryukyu Kingdom, short-grain rice could not be brought in from the mainland.

Awamori keeps well, and when stored for more than three years is known as '''''kūsu''''' (古酒, also read ''koshu'' in standard Japanese).  If the label indicates a specific age, it's 100% at least that old; however, ''kūsu'' without a given age is usually a blend of 50% 3-year-old and 50% new awamori.

Okinawa's local beer '''Orion''' is a safer alternative, at least in small quantities.  Most larger islands also have their own microbreweries.

See also "[[Japanese sake tourism#Shochu and Awamori distilleries]]" article.

===Nightlife===
[[Naha]] has the busy nightlife scene you'd expect of a large city, livened up by the presence of many GIs from the military bases. Chatan is another popular nightlife destination with lots of bars and lives music performances. Due to its proximity to the Kadena airbase, Chatan is popular with American military personnel.

Okinawa has many live houses in Naha city and Okinawa city, with styles ranging from Okinawan traditional folk music to American rock, jazz, and other sounds from the USA.  The charge depends on the artist but it’s usually about &yen;1000-3500, plus one drink. Check the time, the artist, and the price before you go.

==Sleep==
Broadly speaking, accommodation in Okinawa can be divided into two brackets: cheap basic lodges, and expensive fancy resorts. Another option is sleeping in campsites.

===Budget===
Okinawa has a multitude of cheap ''minshuku''-type lodges geared towards poor surfers and divers, and unlike the mainland many offer or even specialize in bed-only (素泊まり; ''sudomari'') stays with no meals included.  The very cheapest dorm-type places can go for less than &yen;2,000, although you'll usually be looking at a minimum of &yen;3,000 for your own room and around &yen;5,000 if you want two meals.  Watch out for hidden charges for things like air-con, fridge rental or even using the shower.

In [[Naha]] you can easily find dirt-cheap places starting from &yen;1,000 per night.

====Camping====
There are many campsites around Okinawa, some on nice beaches. They offer cheap accommodation if you have your own tent and sleeping bag (and mat) for &yen;500-1,000/night. Their facilities are sometimes very poor, they have only cold showers for example (and they even charge you for using it!) and no cooking/cleaning facilities. However, they often rent out BBQ sets (&yen;2,000-3,000) which can make the night unforgettable.

===Mid-range===
B&B-type pensions are the most common midrange option, although there are some city hotels also.  Figure on around &yen;10,000/person with two meals.

===Splurge===
The other end of the spectrum is Okinawa's host of resorts, usually located on a private beach in some remote corner of the island &mdash; which means you'll be stuck eating at the resort's expensive restaurant and using their expensive watersports services.  Rack rates for these places tend to be ludicrous (&yen;20,000+/head/night), but you can usually get steep discounts by buying flight and hotel packages, especially in the low season.

==Talk==
{{infobox|Er, excuse me?|One of the most distinctive features of modern Okinawans is appending the English ending ''-er'' for people who do, well, pretty much anything. The meaning of "boozer" (ブーザー) is fairly obvious, while a "shrimper" (シュリンパー) is just somebody who likes shrimp. However, the common semi-affectionate "beacher" (ビーチャ―) does not refer to someone who enjoys healthy marine sports, it means an alcoholic drunk!}}

Okinawa has its own language group, known as '''Ryukyuan''' (琉球語 ''ryūkyūgo'' in Japanese), which it shares (along with much of its culture) with the [[Amami Islands]] in Kagoshima prefecture. These languages are related to Japanese (together, they form the "Japonic family"), but are generally incomprehensible to Japanese speakers. The largest of these languages, the '''Okinawan language''' (Okinawan ''ucināguci'', Japanese 沖縄語 ''Okinawago''), is spoken on the main island of Okinawa and the surrounding islands and is not used much these days. Most people under 20 can't speak it, the most common exceptions being people who were raised by their grandparents and people who grew up in rural areas. To further complicate things, each of Okinawa's major islands has its own distinct dialect, some of which are different enough to be considered their own languages by some.

In the [[Daito Islands]], the obscure Hachijo dialect of Japanese by immigrants from the Hachijo Islands is the native language. The Hachijo-Daito dialects are direct descendants of the Eastern dialect of Old Japanese, while all mainland dialects are descendants of the Western dialect.

All Okinawans speak standard [[Japanese phrasebook|Japanese]], and many understand English as well, particularly on the main island which has several large US military bases.

==Stay safe==
Despite being the poorest prefecture, Okinawa is as incredibly safe as mainland Japan or even more so. On the smaller islands, it's not uncommon to leave front doors not merely unlocked, but open all day.

===Military bases===
Despite Okinawa's love-hate relationship with the military bases, most Okinawans don't have a negative view of American citizens, as they understand the importance of the bases both economically and security-wise to both Okinawa and the rest of Japan. They also know that the average American has nothing to do with them. However, with that said, it's in the best interest not to bring up the bases due to the controversial history. It's also best not to put the Japanese government and the military bases on the same topic, as some Okinawans also have distrust in the Japanese government for preventing the movement of the bases.

US Military bases are strictly controlled by military police. Only active service members along with family members and service personnel are permitted entry. Unauthorized personnel will be stopped at the gates.  That being said, certain parts of large bases like Kadena would not be out of place in some parts of the USA, including ersatz suburban houses and small malls.

==Stay healthy==
The number one health risk in Okinawa is '''sunburn''', and it doesn't take long at all to get fried to a crisp when it's sunny outside. Slap on plenty of lotion.

Okinawa is also home to Japan's most fearsome array of '''poisonous critters'''.  While the venomous '''habu''' (ハブ) snake gets a lot of bad press, mostly due to its unfortunate habit of entering homes in search of rats and mice, not only are you quite unlikely to encounter one outside a sake bottle in a souvenir shop, but bites have a fatality rate of "only" 3%.  Jellyfish (クラゲ; ''kurage'') and a variety of marine creatures that sting if stepped on present a risk, and many beaches have posters in Japanese (and occasionally English) explaining what to watch out for.
