'''Puerto Vallarta''' is a city and popular vacation resort on the [[Pacific Coast (Mexico)|Pacific Coast]] of [[Mexico]].

==Understand==

Around the Bay, beautiful beaches, lush jungles and sparkling waterfalls offer many opportunities for the adventurous, while five-star resorts, world-class shopping, and gourmet restaurants satisfy even the most sophisticated traveler.  Stretching from the south end of Old Town to central downtown, a newly extended and refurbished boardwalk along the ocean, called the Malecon, passes by any number of shops, restaurants, and hotels, and often plays host to mimes, breakdancers, clowns, and artists.

The residents of Puerto Vallarta are very friendly and generally willing to help with directions and other requests. Old Town Vallarta (or the Zona Romantica district) south of the River Cuale is more like a Mexican town and less like a tourist trap. 

English is widely spoken, and as a tourist destination prices are higher than many other places in Mexico. Puerto Vallarta is very crowded at holiday times, if planning a visit to Mexico that coincides with a major holiday consider opting to visit [[Mexico City]] or [[Guadalajara]] instead. The cities empty out as Mexicans and tourists alike flood to the beaches.   

===Climate===
Puerto Vallarta has a, typical for the west coast of [[Mexico]], tropical climate with two distinct seasons: a long and dry 7-month period (Nov-May) and an intense and wet 4-month period (Jun-Oct). The dry season is slightly cooler than the wet season with high temperatures at or around 30°C (86°F) and lows around 16°C (60°F). Puerto Vallarta very rarely records temperatures at 10°C (50°F) or below and the lowest one ever recorded is 7°C (45°F). The drier months are by far February, March and April with a total of only 9 millimeters (0.4 inches). As June arrives the wet season starts and so does the heat. Temperatures are usually around 35°C (95°F) during the day and around 25°C (75°F) at night. Heat waves can hit the city and when this happens the mercury can reach 40°C (104°F) and combined with the high humidity the atmosphere can sometimes become unbearable. The highest recorded temperature is 45°C (113°F). Most of the rainfall occurs in the form of thunderstorms and falls mostly in July, August and September, which themselves account for 80% of the yearly precipitation. The heat continues through November (despite being in the dry season), and finally starts to dissipate by early December.   

==Get in==

===By plane===
'''Gustavo Diaz Ordaz International Airport (IATA: PVR)''' is located just to the North of Puerto Vallarta proper, and just south of [[Nuevo Vallarta]].  Most major US and Canadian airlines serve the airport along with Aeromexico, Interjet, Volaris and VivaAerobus. It has been recently remodeled, though waits can still occur when more than two flights have landed.
Note that the arrival area is plagued by timeshare hucksters as you come out from customs.  They will offer to arrange a cab for you and try to rope you into a timeshare sales presentation.  After you clear customs, walk quickly through the next room - the one housing the hucksters - continue walking past the rope-line.  Now look for the official taxi kiosk out in the main airport atrium.  You purchase your taxi trip here.  All other offers of cab rides you will receive between customs and the kiosk will be from timeshare hucksters.  Ignore every one of them.  The bad experience of those taken in can ruin one's first hours in PVR, and that would be a shame. Or hire private transportation.

If you've packed lightly you can take the city buses into town. Turn left as you come out of the building and go towards the main road.  The bus stop is to your left, under the pedestrian overpass (1/4 block from the airport door), next to the airport terminal building.  Wait for a bus (5 minutes or so) marked "Centro" or "Zona Romantica" (but NOT marked Pitillal or Bobadilla), wave it down, pay your M$10.00 pesos, and enjoy the ride. The bus stops all throughout the town. It takes about 20 to 30 minutes for the bus to get to its farthest southerly stop. You've just saved US$20 ($400 pesos)! You don't need exact change for the bus. Drivers will make change for bills $50.00 pesos & smaller.  If going to the main bus station (or a bus to Nuevo Vallarta, Bucerias, and anywhere north along Hwy 200) go over the pedestrian bridge to the other side.  The other stop is under the bridge at the opposite side.  Get off at Km 9 or 9.5 which is front of the Corona building and walk up two or three blocks along Las Palmas (one of the roads beside the building) past the building to get there.  Some of the of the buses such as the "Ixtapa" or "Central Autobuses" buses may make a turn at the Coronas building and go by the bus station.  Ask the driver when getting on.

Given Puerto Vallarta is the top touristic destination in the State of Jalisco, flights to this city are usually higher than flights to other airports in the state. A good option if you want to save a few hundred dollars is to fly to Guadalajara, Jalisco capital city, and from there drive to Puerto Vallarta. The road is in excellent shape and it is very safe, the last 20 miles are a little bit winding, but nothing that you have not found back home. In Guadalajara, there are a number of car rental companies specialized in servicing people that do this trip. [https://www.veico.com/en Veico Car Rental] targets this market, they have good cars and speak English.

===By private transportation===
If you are visiting Puerto Vallarta, you should consider private pre-arranged transportation directly from your airport to your hotel. This transportation can be arranged by contacting a company by phone or booking online. This will save you time and money. There are several companies that can take you anywhere in Puerto Vallarta and surrounds. Two of the most popular private transport companies are [https://www.vipvallartatransportation.com/ VIP Vallarta] and [https://aeromovilpvr.com/ Aeromovil PVR]. Both are reputable, but VIP is often half the price of Aeromovil, and they often use the same drivers (who will take the higher paying fares first). If you choose VIP, be prepared to wait 30-45 minutes during busy times while Aeromovil customers are taken first.

===By car===
There are modern, well-maintained toll roads all the way from the border, other local roads are not as well maintained especially in outlying, poorer neighborhoods where the roads are still dirt roads but are still suitable for the drive. See also [[driving in Mexico]] for further tips regarding driving in Mexico. 

'''Federal Hwy 200 (MX Hwy 200)'''  begins in Tepic (168km north) and goes through Sayulita, Bucerias, Nuevo Vallarta and into '''Puerto Vallarta'''.  The highway continues south through Barra de Navidad, Manzanillo, Acapulco, etc.   The road passes through town as a local road (at slower speeds) between the airport and the hills south of Zona Romantica.  In downtown (north of Rio Cuale) the highway goes through as Av Mexico & Morelos (southbound along the Malecon or 1 block in) and Juarez & Colombia (northbound).  South of R. Cuale, in Zona Romantica, the highway becomes Ignacio L. Vallarta (southbound) to Basilio Badilla and Insurgentes (northbound only between Basilio Badilla and R. Cuale).  

From '''Guadalajara''' go west on Hwy 15 and exit at signs pointing towards "Ameca" to go through Mascota and America in the mountains along MX 70/90.  Enters into town from the NE in the Ixtapa neighborhood as Carretera Las Palms & A Ixtapa.  Or continue on Hwy 15 to "MX 68 Compostela Cuota/MX 68 Pto Vallarta Cuota" exit and go west along MX 68/200D to the Hwy 200 intersection just southwest of Compostela and go south on Hwy 200 to Pto Vallarta.

From '''Manzanillo''' simply go north on Hwy 200 for the next 284km.  Winds into town on a curvy 2 lane road into Zona Romantica from the south.

===By boat===
There are many party boats that leave the coast from the Marina for day trips. Some stop at various beaches. You are even able to go horseback riding up to a waterfall at one beach south of Puerto Vallarta. Major cruise ships loaded with thousands of tourists from the United States as well as Europe dock in the city's main port typically spending an entire day there.

===By bus===
The main bus station is north of town, 3km past the airport terminal to km 9 of the main road (Hwy 200) in front of the Corona Building (has a globe on pole in front lawn). The main bus station is two or three blocks behind the Corona Building between Avenida Las Palmas or Palma Real at Bahia Sin Nombre 363, Col Guadalupe Victoria.  The following bus companies operate buses to/from here (Note:  The 800 toll free numbers are for calling from within Mexico unless stated otherwise.  Other numbers are regular or local numbers.  From outside Mexico you will have to call the regular numbers):

Second class buses run from coastal towns throughout the Riviera [[Nayarit]] such as San Blas.  Fares on second class buses can be paid to the driver if picked up from alongside of the road.

To catch a local bus into town, exit the bus station and keep walking across the parking area.  Then walk to your right toward the corner.  The city buses will stop here. Any bus you pick up here will take you all the way down to the "Romantic Zone (Zona Romantica)", about a half an hour drive, for just Mx$10.00! Although not really known to tourists, the buses are one of the best ways to mingle with the locals, as well as getting a nice view of the town.

It is possible to walk between the airport and the bus station, however, catching a city bus is a cheap and reliable option from the other side of the road from the airport terminal.  Go across the pedestrian bridge and the stop is under the pedestrian bridge on the other side.

In town, there's an additional bus stop at the NE corner of Aguacate & Venustiano Carranza in Zona Romantica (Colonia Emiliano Zapata) for first & second class buses going south to El Tuito, Manzanillo and anywhere along the way. Tickets can be bought from vendors in front of Abarrotes Don Chalio on 402 Venustiano Carranza; Farmacia Guadalajara on the SE corner of Insurgentes & Lazaro Cardenas; or Superior Tours on Ignacio L. Vallarta 228 (SW of Ignacio L Vallarta & Calle FCO Madero - Tel: 322-222-0024).  Fares for second class buses can be paid to the driver at boarding.  If coming into town from the south ask to get off in Zona Romantica (along Insurgent) if going to downtown or Zona Romantica, otherwise stay on the bus to the bus station (north) to continue north to Nuevo Vallarta, Bucerias, Sayulita, Tepic, or anywhere in the Riviera.

The following have their own terminals and/or stops elsewhere instead:
* <listing name="ATM (Auto Transportes de Medina) grey" alt="" directions="Along Brasil between Guatemala & Brasilia south of the sports complex" lat="" long="" address="Brasil 1140, Col. 5 de Diciembre" phone="+52 322 222-7279 or 222-4732" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price=""> goes up to Nuevo Vallarta, Punta de Mita, San Juan, La Penita, Valle de Banderas and anywhere in between.  In town the routes start at their terminal and they only stop in front of Wal-Mart, under the pedestrian bridge by the airport terminal, and in front of the Corona building along the main highway.  If coming into town get off at the opposite side of the road from Wal-Mart and wait for another city bus to come by (w/ 'Centro' or 'Zona Romantica' marked on the windshield/windscreen).</listing>
* '''Compostela-Pacifico''' (Green & White) [http://www.rivieranayarit.com/local_buses] goes further north to Sayulita, San Francisco (San Pancho), and Rincón de Guayabitos in the Riviera.  In town they stop at the same stops as ATM (Auto Transportes Medina) (see above). 
* <listing name="ATM (Autotransportes Talpa Mascota) Red or Burgundy" alt="" directions="corner of Lucerna & Havre, Col.

==Get around==

===By taxi===
Hotels may provide a price list for cabs (expect to pay about 50 pesos for short trips, and 200 for longer trips). Hotels will also offer (expensive) transport from the airport to the hotel, but it is much better to take a taxi. If you've booked with a travel agency, they will most likely provide you with transportation to and from the airport.
Be prepared for fast speeds, as the cab drivers have schedules to adhere to. Many of the cabs do not have working seatbelts or speedometers as well. Taxi drivers tend to gather at the intersection close to the liquor outlet in the Centro District. They are friendly and you can negotiate trips outside of Puerto Vallarta at a very reasonable cost on slow days. They will wait for you while you dine or shop as well as take a photograph of you and your mates. Include a small tip with the very reasonable fare.

Tip: From the airport, there are two types of taxis available to get you to where you are going. The white federal taxis are available immediately upon exiting the airport but are more expensive. Cross the pedestrian bridge over the highway for the cheaper yellow taxis that are more common in other parts of the city. Crossing the bridge is also where you will need to meet your rideshare (Uber/Lyft) driver.

===By bus===
*'''Local trips''' 
Bus trips cost $10 that you pay when you get on and this fare is the same regardless of distance as long as you stay on the same bus. Have the exact $10 in form of coin(s), bus drivers no longer break bills, you have to insert the coins into a slot for a total of $10. You can, however, pay with a $20 bill if you're with 2 people etc. 

It is easy to find a bus stop. You will see large numbers of people loitering on the sidewalk, many are also marked with a bus stop sign. If you wait a few minutes, a bus will stop as they run quite frequently. Look for your travel location on the bus windshield. Buses stop almost every five to ten blocks and at peak hours tend to get very full & can get very hot, so be ready for that. Many buses are not city buses and do not take passengers from regular stops, so don't be alarmed when a few buses ignore you - many of them are different companies and/or or long distance services that simply pass through the same main road.

The buses are very reliable quite handy to get to places like Pitillal (the rapidly growing suburb to the NE) and Ixtapa (including the nearby U of Guadalajara campus with its gallery and crocodile farm).  They are also useful for traveling from the hotel zone and marina area to the downtown or old-town areas.  Any bus marked Centro will pass through both. Buses marked "Túnel" will skip downtown and head directly to the old-town / zona romantica via the tunnel bypass. 

*'''Out of town trips'''
You can visit Bucerias for 12 pesos, $.85. You can also go to Punta Mita for 20 pesos, $1.50. Mismaloya buses charge around 6 pesos. There are also larger buses that can take you to Guadalajara, which is about a 5-hour trip.

You can catch buses for Mismaloya along Basilio Badillo on the corner just West of where you see them lined up.

The easiest way to catch a bus to Bucerias, Punta Mita or points in between is to catch a city bus to Wal-Mart/Sams.  Walk along the main road to the northernmost bus shelters in front of Wal-Mart. The buses to Bucerias leave from here.

If you want to catch a bus south to Barra de Navidad or any of the towns south to Costa Alegre, you can catch the bus at the corner of [Dieguez & Aguacate] at the south end of town. Busses leave at 6 am & 9 am. Look for the blue bus stop sign. You will have to pay the driver in Peso's (fares vary on distance). Just tell the driver where or when you want to get off the bus. Most busses make frequent stops but have A/C. Regional buses are very reliable & run 7 days per week.

[[Image:Puerto_Vallarta_beach.jpg‎|thumb|300px|Puerto Vallarta's beaches lie between mountains and ocean]]

Beautiful Banderas Bay, one of the largest and deepest in the world, may be admired from many of the surrounding hills exuberant in lush vegetation. Located right at the mouth of the Bay, straddling both sides of the River Cuale lies a charming and picturesque little town with true Mexican spirit, Puerto Vallarta.

For those who just want to relax, Puerto Vallarta's many golden sand beaches offer one of the best ways to experience the beauty and magic of the Bay of Banderas. A section of the beach called The Blue Chairs is the focal point of the gay village. 

To the North, the hills give way a little. Here you will find mile-long stretches of golden sand beaches, rich plantations of papaya and mango and, tucked back along tumbling rivers and streams, small villages where life seems to move at a different pace. There are many different ways to explore the Bay.

To the South, the hills cascade towards the sea creating a rich palette that mixes the vivid green foliage with the deep blues of the water. At their feet nestle secluded coves and small fishing villages, many of which are still accessible only by sea.

To the East, the jungle-clad Sierra Madre Mountains, which quickly rise to over 8,000 feet, encircle and protect the town from the winds and regulate the semi-tropical and humid weather.

And, to the West, the Bay of Banderas is home to a wide variety of aquatic life. Humpback whales come here to mate every year from December to March, and sea turtles nest on the beaches from May to October. Schools of dolphins and giant manta rays also inhabit these waters. The Bay and the Marietas Islands offer an amazing kaleidoscope of tropical fish, attracting snorkelers, scuba divers and sports fishermen alike.

==Do==

Puerto Vallarta has many activities and excursions to keep you entertained. The adventurous can hike or mountain bike in the hills, explore the jungle and hidden trails on horseback, take a jeep safari, snorkel, scuba dive, charter a yacht or sailboat, or take a cruise on one of the many party boats, make a personal photoshoot. Oftentimes they are easily booked online.

===Botanical Gardens===

*<do name="Vallarta Botanical Gardens" alt="Hacienda de Oro Restaurant" address="Carretera a Barra de Navidad Km.24 S/N just beyond Las Juntas y Los Veranos" directions="" phone="(322) 223-6182" url="http://www.vallartabotanicalgardensac.org" hours="From 9AM to 6PM (closed on Mondays)" price="" lat="" long="">Vallarta Botanical Gardens a pleasure garden high in the glorious Sierra Madre Mountains. These gardens are easily accessible, just 12 miles south of Puerto Vallarta (on Hwy 200).  
<br>

Located on 20 acres of land, these botanical collections features thousands of different species of plants. The gardens are in a unique tropical dry forest ecosystem at 1,300 feet above sea level. Against the breathtaking backdrop of soaring mountain peaks, there is much to experience: Palm Gardens, Rose Garden, Tree Fern Grotto, Orchid House, Jungle Trails, Tropical Bird Watching, Agave Gardens, displays of Mexican Wildflowers and the Carnivorous Plant Collection. Bringing your swimsuit and enjoy a refreshing dip in the crystal clear Rio Los Horcones   The Puerto Vallarta Botanical Gardens is registered with Botanic Gardens Conservation International in Surrey, England and members of the Asociacion Mexicana de Orquideologia. The Gardens are listed in the Lonely Planet 2009 Guide to Mexico as a "Vallarta Must See" 
<br>
Vallarta Botanical Gardens is a 501c3 nonprofit institution. The Puerto Vallarta Botanical Gardens was founded in 2004 and was opened to the public in 2005. Our Vision: to build Mexico's greatest botanical garden here in the enchanted highlands of Jalisco, Mexico. Our staff is dedicated to the research and education of plant life, as well as showing the public all the beauty that nature has to offer. Plus providing the finest hospitality around. 
 Presently listed as the Number One Botanical Gardens to visit.
<br>
Hacienda de Oro Visitor's Center with spectacular mountain views, is also where you will find '''Hacienda de Oro Restaurant''', with a courteous staff, delicious brick oven pizzas, salads, and other Mexican specialties. Hacienda de Oro Restaurant was designed by Santa Rosa, CA native, and world-renowned fine artist, Anthony Sbragia. Also, in this area are the famous "classy" restrooms. Located in the heart of an old growth native forest, with thousands of native and ornamental plants, a short ride from town - by car, bus, taxi.
<br>
To reach the gardens by public transportation from the city: There is a bus that runs roughly hourly from the junction of Aguacate and Carranza street in the center. It's named "El Tuito" and tickets are sold by someone next to the grocery store on the corner just before departure, as well as when getting on the bus. The same bus goes back from the highway, there is a bus stop across the road from the gardens just to your right. Fare is $30 one way. For return bus times: ask the reception what they are, it doesn't seem to have a very regular schedule at all, and it also serves as public transportation for people going beyond the gardens. 

There can be a queue to get a taxi back - opting for the bus is realistic as it is reasonably large (25 seats or so).

===Adventure/Sports===

'''Whale watching'''

* Puerto Vallarta’s whale watching season runs from December to March of every year. Humpback whales are the top liners of this fantastic nature show, but you can also see dolphins, porpoises, and other animals. Puerto Vallarta Whale Watching Tours take you to see humpback whale mothers and their calves in Banderas Bay.
* International Charter Group: [http://www.barcosbarcelona.com]. Yacht charter and sailing, one of the worlds largest yacht charter companies, can take care of all charter requirements, from bareboat to crewed in Puerto Vallarta. Operating from nine offices worldwide (USA, Spain, UK, Germany, Italy, France, Spain, Switzerland, Caribbean, Honk Kong and Dubai). 
* Go kayaking or rent a boat from Bilbobentura [15] (a company that rents out kayaks on the bank of the river nervion). 

'''Golfing'''
* La Marina Vallarta Golf Course-Have to have good accuracy for this one due to narrow fairways that are guarded by water
* Los Flamingos Golf Course-Known as one of the easiest to play
* The Mayan Palace Nuevo Vallarta Golf Club, ''18-hole par 71 course'' designed by Jim Lipe. Address: Paseo de las Moras S/N, Fraccionamiento Náutico Turístico, Nuevo Vallarta, Nayarit, Mexico 63735, [http://www.mayanresortsgolf.com/]. Fun course with many obstacles is on the spectacular beaches of Vallarta between the Sierra Madre mountains and the Bahia de Banderas Bay. The Vallarta course offers interesting competitive advantages and challenges to golf lovers for the vast fairways appear to be the easy part but the lakes complicate the game for the most expert golfers.
* El Tigre Golf Club-Long course with many traps and water
* Vista Vallarta-Hosted the 2002 EMC World Cup Championship

'''Scuba Diving'''
* Puerto Vallarta is one of Mexico's top dive destinations. There are many rental shops along the beaches. 

'''Surfing'''
* The beaches in Puerto Vallarta are not ideal for surfing, but a day trip out of town up along the coast of Banderas Bay will take you to some great surf spots! Passing the Ameca river along the way to these spots, you find yourself in the next door northern state of Nayarit. Such trips can be coordinated with a local surfing instructor or done solo.

There are many surfing spots in the state of Nayarit: ranging from beginner waves, to perfect reef breaks for experienced surfers. The names of some of the more popular surf spots are Veneros, Burros, la Lancha, Punta de Mita, San Pancho and [[Sayulita]].  The drive from downtown Vallarta to points inside the Bay takes roughly 45 minutes, and a bit over an hour to get to renowned Sayulita on the Pacific coast. Sayulita is a small village which is frequented by many tourists because it is easily accessible and a vast array of businesses cater to beginner surfers. You can find surfboard rentals, surf lessons, and great beaches. Sayulita is known for producing some of the best surfers in Mexico like Tigre Cadena, Kalle Carranza, Diego Cadena, and Adan Hernandez amongst others. 
The main beach at Sayulita has consistent waves and the place is crowded during the winter months particularly. There are waves small enough for beginners and large enough for the locals and experts. Most of the adventure companies don't offer surfing lessons and you might need to find an independent instructor.

'''Snorkeling - Los Arcos'''
Los Arcos is a set of caves accessible closest via Mismaloya Beach.  You have a couple ways of reaching them
* Tour - In this option, you can book a tour through a major group.
* Panga from Los Muertos Pier(Muelle de Playa Los Muertos) - Pangas are smaller boats that can bring you to a destination.  Here, a panga costs about $1,200 pesos for 4 people and takes about 20-30 minutes to get to Los Arcos.
* Panga from Mismaloya - Mismaloya beach is about a 20-minute drive south from Puerto Vallarta [https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mismaloya+Beach/@20.531961,-105.2925707,18.26z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x84215b96665c4165:0xcde60d72a78ac60a].  Although it is a further drive, there are pangas there which cost about $1,200 for 4 people, but it only takes 5 minutes to get there.  Mismaloya is the closest point to Los Arcos.  Here is a contact you can arrange in advance- Carlos - pricilasirena@hotmail.com, +52-329-291-2070

Los Arcos actually is a pretty small area to snorkel.  Although there are 3 big rock formations, only one is marked off for exploration.  Spending an hour there is a sufficient amount of time to see everything.

* The most popular snorkeling areas are Los Arcos underwater caves and Marietas Islands caverns.
'''Explore the Sierra Madre'''
* The Mexican Outback in the states of Jalisco and Nayarit offers an opportunity of discovery and adventure: A culturally and ecologically trained guide can take you into authentic Mexican villages and through the sub-tropical forest with its extraordinary ecology and wildlife. 

'''Canopy Tour / Zip lines'''
* Puerto Vallarta is well known for its canopy and zip line tours. Experience the exhilarating rush as you fly over the treetops, securely fastened, from platform to platform.

'''Sailing'''
* Banderas Bay is the second largest bay in North America, behind Hudson Bay. The deep, calm waters offer very rich biodiversity, stunning beauty, romantic sunsets, and relaxed sailing. 
'''Kitesurfing'''
* Kitesurfing is becoming more and more popular in Banderas Bay. Especially in Bucerias, a fishing village north of Nuevo Vallarta, you can see up to 30 people kitesurfing on a Sunday when the wind is good. The calm waters of Banderas Bay, the extended shoreline and the fact that it´s not too crowded with kitesurfers (yet) make it an excellent place to take lessons, for example from Jamison Smith [http://www.jamisonsmith.com], an IKO Level 2 Senior Certified International Kiteboarding Instructor. The season is from February until May.

'''Parasailing'''
* You are able to parasail at pretty much every beach. The sky-high trip usually lasts around 15 min.  Avoid Claudia's Parachutes in front of the restaurant Coco Tropical.  Claudia's, run by Pepe (alias 'Leche') is run by criminals laundering money for their cartel bosses.  Your security is of little importance.  Corruption runs deep in Mexico so they are allowed to continue to operate without consequences.

'''Jet Skiing'''
* Jet skis can be rented at most beaches by the hour.

'''Fishing'''
* Banderas Bay is home to annual Puerto Vallarta International Fishing Tournament held since 1956. Fish types include sailfish, dorado, marlin, bonito and yellowfin tuna, roostertail, jack cravel, pargo, red snapper and more denizens of the deep, black, blue and striped marlin.   
**ProFishingVallarta Sports Fishing in Puerto Vallarta [http://www.profishingvallarta.com] - Offers fishing charter services throughout the whole year in Puerto Vallarta Mexico

'''Horseback Riding'''
* There are many ranches in town that offer horseback Riding into small villages and through the forests. They can last from a few hours to a few days. 

'''Turtle-Watching & Repatriation''' 
* Some tour companies offer educational programs combined with hands-on activities to help save Mexico’s turtles.  After the female turtles lay their eggs in nests they create in the sand, volunteers dig up the eggs and re-bury them somewhere safe from predators. After about 45 to 60 days, the eggs hatch.  Without help, only about 1 in every 1,000 baby turtles will survive to adulthood because most are caught by predators before they make it back to the safety of the ocean.  However, turtle repatriation volunteers keep the babies safe until it is time to set them free to head for the ocean (at night when predators are less active).  You can be part of these programs. 

'''Hiking'''
* You will be hard-pressed to find information about simple hiking excursions because no one makes much money from hikers while they are hiking.
So you must research this ahead of time if you wish to hike.  However, one short and interesting hike may be accessed as follows.  Take a water taxi to Yelapa.  On the main beach in Yelapa, walk to the right and cross the creek.  Hike upwards a few meters to the cobblestone trail.  Turn right, and then follow the trail over a ridge and up the adjacent valley.  After hiking about 1.5 km through a tropical deciduous forest, your persistence will be rewarded.

==Eat==

The rich cultural diversity of Puerto Vallarta is reflected in the cuisine that its many restaurants have to offer. From the most casual taco stands to tropical beachfront palapas, to upscale rooftop restaurants with panoramic views, there are literally hundreds of restaurants serving exactly what you are hungry for.

However, care should be taken to avoid [[Travellers' diarrhea|travelers' diarrhea]].  There are many beachside restaurants to tempt you with tropical drinks, but bottled beer is a much safer option.  
When water taxis or other guides seamlessly hand you off to their "amigos" at a beachside restaurant, do not be bashful about seeking other options, or just order a bottled beer to be opened in front of you.  Do not trust that your guide has made a good decision, he will be gone with your tip long before you show any symptoms.  Restaurants listed in reputable tour guides are a fairly safe bet.

===General Safety===
Puerto Vallarta is a beautiful holiday destination, but this is not an excuse to leave your common sense at home. You should not treat the city as if it is a huge beach resort existing solely for your pleasure. 

Exercise caution here as in any place that you are unfamiliar. Keep an eye on your possessions (purses, cameras, etc) at all times. 
Do not flaunt large amounts of cash and wear a concealed money belt to secure large bills and your passport. Make sure you always have small bills/ coins on hand to pay for small items. 

The beaches and hotels have security people who are familiar with the area and tend to ward off most undesirable characters. As in many "tourist destinations", there are local "tourist police", who concentrate on keeping the area safe for visitors. They, and the locals understand the value of visitors and make life very difficult for those who may consider preying on visitors. 

Avoid confrontations with the police. In the event you do have a disagreement with them, expect to be treated poorly and expect to pay many pesos to regain your freedom. Respect and co-operation go a long way with them, disrespect usually will not be tolerated.

For digestive issues, use Immodium. It is sold over the counter & works for most issues.

===Beach Activities===
Water you have never been to can be dangerous. Leaving your valuables (cameras, purses, passport) alone on the beach, is an invitation to theft at any beach.
*'''Precautions'''
*Observe the warning flags on public beaches. There could be a strong undertow.
*Never dive into unknown waters. There may be rocks
*Never have a knife in your bag

==Cope==
Note that not very many places take credit cards. Some larger hotel complexes, high-end restaurants, and shops do, but most do not. It is very much a cash-only economy with ATMs available in convenient locations and a bank downtown where in-person withdrawals can be made.

For the budget traveler - time your visit outside of peak holiday periods (eg Santa Semana/ Easter week). Accommodation prices during peak times can double or triple and the beaches become insanely crowded. 

If you are traveling around Mexico leave your souvenir shopping until you are in [[Guadalajara]] or, even better, Tonalá, as prices in Puerto Vallarta are higher unless you haggle and choose the right marketplaces, avoiding the tourist trap stores (mainly on the Malecon and main drag).

==Get out==

Your exploring does not have to be limited just to the Bay, there are nearby archeological sites to visit as well. Close at hand, in the region of [[Ixtapa]], studies have uncovered sites dating back to 400 B.C.

[[Mismaloya]] is a short drive outside town. It is famous for being the location for the movie "The Night of the Iguana" [https://www.puertovallarta.net/fast_facts/the-night-of-the-iguana] directed by John Houston [https://www.puertovallarta.net/fast_facts/john-huston]. You can not tour the location anymore. 

Chico's Paradise, a river valley with rock formations and picnic/restaurant areas is a drive or bus ride south past Mismaloya Beach at Las Juntas y Los Veranos.

For a trip back in time to the 1600s and 1700s; a day-trip up (4600') to the old silver mining town of San Sebastian del Oeste [https://www.puertovallarta.net/what_to_do/san-sebastian-del-oeste-mexico] is worth the time.

'''Driving'''
* A 30-minute drive up the coast and you arrive at [[Bucerias]], a small coastal village. 
* Heading an hour north you can get to the quaint surf town of [[Sayulita]]
* An hour and half east is [[San Sebastián del Oeste]]

'''Flying'''
* Puerto Vallarta is less than a 45-minute flight away from the inland city of [[Guadalajara]] and about an hour flight from Mexico City.
