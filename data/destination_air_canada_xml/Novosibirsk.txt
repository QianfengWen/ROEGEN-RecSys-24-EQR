'''Novosibirsk''' ([[Russian phrasebook|Russian]]: Новосиби́рск ''nuh-vuh-see-BEERSK'') is a city in [[Novosibirsk Oblast]], [[Siberia]], [[Russia]].

==Understand==
With a population of over 1.6 million people, Novosibirsk is the third most populous city in Russia. 

The city was founded in 1893 as a transport hub. The city was originally called '''Novonikolayevsk''' (Новониколаевск), in honor of both Saint Nicholas and of the reigning Tsar Nicholas II. It became a large industrial centre during the Stalin period. In 1962, it became the first city in the world to reach a population of 1 million people within 70 years of being founded.

The majority of the population lives in apartment buildings and private houses are rare.

Novosibirsk grew into a beautiful place with booming cultural life (after the fall of Soviet Union). Russia's third largest city has embraced its status as capital of Siberia and opened its doors to the world. A slew of  museums and monuments, a relaxed big-city vibe, a pulsating nightlife and a wealth of great accommodation are available to the visitors. 

===Climate===
-Summers in Novosibirsk are typically warm with average temperatures of around 18°C (64°F) but it can be cold at night. Summer months are also often wet and rainy and storms can occur. June and July are the sunniest months.

-Winter can be severely cold with temperatures dropping below -30°C (-22°F), but its usually around -15°C (5°F). Winter is often dark and cloudy and heavy snowfall is a regular occurrence.

-Spring and Autumn are both transitional months, and can either be very cold or quite warm. During spring, streets and roads can become dirty as a result of mud and melting snow.

==Get in==
===By plane===
'''[http://eng.tolmachevo.ru/ Tolmachevo Airport]''', ({{IATA|OVB}}), +7 383 216-98-41, also known as Novosibirsk International Airport, is 16km from the city centre. The airport serves over 4 million passengers per year. There are regular to flights to many major Russian cities including [[Moscow]], [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Khabarovsk]], [[Vladivostok]], [[Krasnodar]], [[Omsk]], [[Ulan-Ude]], [[Samara]], [[Ufa]], and [[Yekaterinburg]] as well as international flights to [[Dushanbe]], [[Istanbul]], [[Baku]], [[Prague]], [[Yerevan]], [[Beijing]], [[Almaty]], [[Osh]], [[Bishkek]], and [[Dubai]].

To travel between the airport and the city:
* [http://eng.tolmachevo.ru/transport/how/bus/111/ Bus #111] (RUB44) operates between the airport and the main train station "Novosibirsk-Glavny" (Новосибирск-Главный) and Avtovokzal (Автовокзал), the bus terminal (30 minutes). The stop is directly in front of the entrance A3 of the airport and is marked by a standpost. The bus leaves every 30 min starting 04:00 until 22:30.
* [http://eng.tolmachevo.ru/transport/how/taxi/312/ Minibus #312] operates between the airport and the main train station.
* [http://eng.tolmachevo.ru/transport/how/bus/112/ Bus #112] (RUB30) operates between the airport and shopping mall "Mega" (IKEA). 
* A taxi takes around 30 minutes and should cost RUB500 if negotiated in advance.
Beware of the private drivers aggressively haggling their services though, they are notorious for deceiving unwary travelers: the fare at the end of the drive may turn out much higher than negotiated. Get out of the car immediately if the driver's "friend" turns up for a ride along! Use the phone or taxi desks inside the airport to order a taxi.

===Akademgorodok===
A visit to Akademgorodok, built in the 1950s as a mecca for academics but suffering from neglect in the post-Soviet years, is still pleasant as a day trip. This formerly elite institution is located about 30 KM south of the city and features several museums and nice, tree-lined streets. 

While you're in the area, you might also visit one of several nice beaches on the Ob Sea, the large body of water created by a dam on the Ob River. 

Also south of the city, about 2 km north of Akademgorodok, is the open-air West Siberian Rail Museum. There are about 90 historical trains and rail cars there.

===The Zoo===
One of the largest zoos in Russia and one of the very few in the world that have a liger (a hybrid of a tiger and a lioness). Many other species including polar bears are represented there too.

==Do==
[[Image:Novosibirsk Ob Sea.jpg|thumb|250px|Tanning at the beach in spring]]

* Novosibirsk Regional Puppet Theater (over 70 years old in an interesting historic building)

* Novosibirsk Circus

* In winter residents build an ice town on the Ob River, and in summer you can go to the beach. 

* <do name="Opera House" alt="Novosibirsk State Academic Opera and Ballet Theater" address="" directions="In the city centre" lat="55.030371" long="82.924516" phone="+7 (383) 222-60-40" tollfree="" email="office@novat.nsk.ru" fax="" url="https://novat.nsk.ru/en/" hours="" price="">Many of the performances are famous works and it is interesting to see the Siberian interpretations. Recommended to purchase tickets in advance.</do>

* Since there is plenty of snow in Siberia during the winter, going skiing or ice skating could be a lot of fun in Novosibirsk. There are a lot of ice arenas in the city. Some of them are free of charge, but those don't usually rent skates. The ones that rent skates may be not free of charge. One of the centrally located stadiums is "Spartak".

==Buy==

There are a lot of malls, shops, boutiques and stores in Novosibirsk. They offer a lot of goods from all round the world and you can have a great time while shopping. However, be careful when buying anything there - always check what you buy, before you pay. Sometimes the goods you buy may be produced not by a brand company but by a company in an Asian country that has a license for producing products under this brand name. Sometimes the quality of these goods doesn't correspond to the quality of the original brand. This may be especially applied to the European brands. For example, the same scents may have a different aroma in Novosibirsk and somewhere in Europe. It doesn't mean that the goods have bad quality and you shouldn't shop. But be careful if you want to purchase anything.
You could have a lot of fun if you go to markets like Central Market ("Центральный рынок") or "Baraholka". There you'll see people from around the world selling stuff that is not brand but it may have a good quality. Be careful there as well, as you may run into pocket pickers. You may even find some local food there and try some specials. There are a lot of different markets in the city but the most famous are Central Market and Baroholka. You may buy nothing there but what you see, you'll see nowhere in the world. It literally looks like an Asian market with only difference it's in the Russian way.

==Stay Safe==
While it's better to stay away from some run-down areas, things aren't that bad overall. Areas like Pervomayskiy Rayon, Kirovskiy Rayon, and distant neighbourhoods of Leninskiy Rayon should be avoided by foreigners as there is not much to do anyway. Those areas aren't dangerous, however. It's just that the outskirts of the cities tend to have much lighter policing, and so chances of something happening are higher.

The centre is obviously the safest place in the city. Night life is huge, even on weekdays, so you won't have any issues whatsoever, no matter the time of day.
