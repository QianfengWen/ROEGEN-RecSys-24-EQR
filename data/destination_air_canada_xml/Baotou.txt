* '''Qingshan''' &mdash; part of the new city with a small and depressing walking street
* '''Jiuyuan''' 
* '''Kunqu''' (Kandulun) &mdash; major part of the new city and is the main shopping and entertainment area with all the western restaurants near Baobaidalou (a large walking street and shopping area)

The new city is bisected by Gangtie St, a large road that goes from the east in Qingshan to the west in Kunqu.
