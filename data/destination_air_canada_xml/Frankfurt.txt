[http://www.frankfurt-tourismus.de/cms/tourismussuite/en/home.html '''Frankfurt'''] ([[German]]: '''Frankfurt am Main''') is the business and financial centre of [[Germany]] and the largest city in the German state of [[Hesse]]. The city is known for its [https://www.skylineatlas.com '''futuristic skyline'''] and the busiest German airport. 

Located on the river Main, Frankfurt is the financial capital of Continental Europe and the transportation centre of Germany. Frankfurt is home of the European Central Bank and the German Stock Exchange. Furthermore, it hosts some of the world's most important trade shows, such as the Frankfurt Auto Show and the Frankfurt Book Fair.

Frankfurt is a city of contrasts. Wealthy bankers, students and granola drop-outs coexist in a city that has some of the highest, most avant-garde skyscrapers of Europe next to well maintained old buildings. The city centre, especially Römer square, the [http://www.kultur-frankfurt.de/portal/en/Home/Start/0/0/0/0/1424.aspx '''cultural landscape'''] and the [http://www.museumsufer-frankfurt.de/portal/en/News/Start/0/0/0/0/2360.aspx '''museums at the River Main'''], draw millions of tourists every year. On the other hand, many off the beaten track neighbourhoods, such as Bockenheim, Bornheim, Nordend and Sachsenhausen, with their intact beautiful 19th century streets and parks are often overlooked by visitors.

Frankfurt is the place where Germany's major autobahns and railways intersect. About 350,000 people commute to the city each day, in addition to the 764,000 people who actually live here. With a huge airport &mdash; the third-largest in Europe &mdash; it is the gateway to Germany and for many people also the first point of arrival in Europe. Further, it is a prime hub for interconnections within Europe and for intercontinental flights. 

Frankfurt is the most diverse city in Germany and has the highest percentage of foreigners in the country: about 28% of Frankfurt's residents (~764,000) have no German passport and another 20% are naturalized German citizens.

Frankfurt is home to many museums, theatres and a world-class opera.

===When to visit===
The best times for Frankfurt are late spring to early autumn. The summers tend to be sunny and warm around 25&nbsp;°C (77°&nbsp;F). Be prepared, however, for very hot summer days around 35°&nbsp;C (95°&nbsp;F) as well as for light rain. The winters can be cold and rainy (usually not lower than -10&nbsp;°C/14&nbsp;°F).   It rarely snows in Frankfurt itself.

If you intend to stay overnight, you may wish to avoid times when trade fairs are held, as this will make finding affordable accommodation a challenging task.  The biggest is the Book Fair (''Buchmesse'') yearly in mid-October; see [[#Fairs|Fairs]] for details.

===Tourist Information===
There are two offices for tourism information. The easiest one to get to is inside the Central Station. Look for the signs: it is near the main exit, next to the German Rail (DB) service area.

The official contact data is:

==Get in==
Frankfurt is the heart of central Germany and as such, it is the national transportation hub. It has excellent connections by rail, road and air. Reaching and leaving Frankfurt is easy.

===By plane===
[[Image:Frankfurt-airport.jpg|thumb|Frankfurt am Main International Airport]]
Frankfurt Airport  [http://www.frankfurt-airport.com/] ({{IATA|FRA}}) is among the busiest in [[Europe]] &mdash; fourth in passenger traffic after London Heathrow, Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport and Amsterdam Schiphol &mdash;. Frankfurt is the banking center of Germany and hosts numerous international trade fairs. Therefore all major airlines and all airline alliances fly frequently to Frankfurt and connect it to every continent and major city in the world. The German flagcarrier Lufthansa [http://www.lufthansa.com] is the main airline in Frankfurt and offers the best connections.

The airport has two terminals (a third is scheduled to be opened in 2024). Terminal 1 is the home of Lufthansa and the [[Star Alliance]] [http://www.staralliance.com] airlines.  Terminal 2 is for all other airlines. Terminal 1 is separated into Concourses A (inside Schengen passport control), Z (the level on top of A, outside passport control), B and C; Terminal 2 is separated into Concourses D and E.  Terminal 1 is a multi-level maze with poor signage & changing entrances due to ongoing construction work and insufficient capacity. Lufthansa tries to ease the confusion, therefore Business Class passengers (+ Gold & Silver Star Alliance Card Holders) have a designated check in area in Terminal 1 A. First class passengers of Lufthansa & Swiss Int'l Airlines (+ LH HON Circle card holders) are allowed to check-in in the separate First Class terminal [http://www.lufthansa.com/online/portal/lh/de/info_and_services/at_the_airport?nodeid=1771144&l=en&cid=18002|] on the right side of Terminal 1, which has its own driveway. All Star Alliance economy class travelers and other Star Alliance partners are checked in in Terminal 1B & 1C. The terminals are connected by the Sky Train (both landside and airside).

The departure gates have some of the most innovative seating around, with bench seats facing many directions and cafe-style tables and chairs for those who wish to whip out their laptops (''sans'' coffee, alas). Passengers requiring special assistance should be advised that they might have to descend several flights of stairs to get to a bus that takes them to the plane, rather than disability-friendly ramps, so talk to the gate agent early if stairs are a problem. Here you can find the flight times for Departure Time Frankfurt Airport  [https://www.airport-frankfurt-am-main.com/departures-frankfurt-airport.html] and here the Arrival Time Frankfurt Airport [https://www.airport-frankfurt-am-main.com/arrivals-frankfurt-airport.html].

Terminal 1 has public showers for €6 (includes towel, foot mat, shower gel, and hair dryer). One location is in the secure area of B Concourse (good for transit passengers), Level 2, near gate B 30 and the duty free shopping.  There is luggage storage in both terminals for €7 per bag per day. For business class passengers travelling on Star Alliance flights, there is also a Lufthansa Welcome lounge in Terminal 1 concourse B in the arrivals hall on floor -1. Note that Star Alliance Gold members travelling economy are not permitted entry here.

Wireless internet access is available.  30 minutes is "free", but requires receiving an SMS (text message), which isn't free if you have to pay to receive an SMS or can't receive an SMS in Germany.  More time is available by paying (e.g., €5 for 1 hour, €10 for a significantly longer period).

The airport has a long visitor terrace on top of terminal 2 (adults €5). It also offers 45-minute airside bus tours (adults €8, hourly from 11 (holidays) or 1-4PM, ticket booth is at the bridge between terminal 1 and "Frankfurt Airport Centre", follow signs and information for ''Flughafen Erlebnisfahrten'' ("Airport Experience Tour").

====Airport to the city centre====

The airport is connected to central Frankfurt by taxi, bus (Line 61 to ''Frankfurt Südbahnhof'' (Frankfurt South Station), and most easily by S-Bahn (fast commuter trains). To get to the city, take lines S8 or S9 from ''Regionalbahnhof'' (regional train station) in Terminal 1 (entrances in section A and B) in the direction of Offenbach Ost or Hanau: interactive route planner [http://www.rmv.de/auskunft/bin/jp/query.exe/en?L=vs_rmv&]. The lines S1-6/8/9 travel through the cornerstone of the system, an underground tunnel (the ''Citytunnel'') through central Frankfurt. If you want to change to long-distance trains get off at ''Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof''(Frankfurt Central Station) or ''Frankfurt Südbahnhof'' (Frankfurt South Station). If you want to go the city centre, get off at ''Frankfurt Taunusanlage'', ''Frankfurt Hauptwache'' or ''Frankfurt Konstablerwache'', which are in the heart of the city. The ride from the airport to the central station takes 11 minutes. Be sure to purchase a ticket at the vending machines in the train station ''before'' boarding the train. The adult ticket is €4.9 (as of Nov 2018). Round trip it is cheaper to get a day ticket for 9.10€. For 2-5 people, it pays to get a group day ticket for 15.80€.

Note that the Frankfurt Airport train station also has long distance ICE (inter city express) trains going all the way from Dortmund in the North to Basel and Munich in the South. Notable stops include Cologne, Siegborg (transfer to the S-66 to go into Bonn), Dortmund, Essen etc. On weekday mornings these trains can get fairly busy so be prepared to stand. 2nd class tickets between the airport and Bonn cost ~64 EUR for 2nd class and ~100 EUR for 1st class if bought at the last minute. Note that you can travel on any ICE train to your destination after buying an ICE ticket. Follow the signs for Fernbahnhof (long distance trains) to go to the platforms where the ICE trains depart

====City center to the Airport====
The Cheapest way is suburban trains "S-Bahn".If you want to go to the airport via S-Bahn, take the S8 or S9 in the direction of [[Wiesbaden]] and jump off at F-Flughafen (airport station). Trains run every 15 minutes. And S8 runs 24/7. Don't take the S1 &mdash; while it has the same general direction and leaves the central station at the same platform, it will go along the other side of the river Main. The line S1 does not stop at the airport.
From the Airport to Frankfurt downtown follow the signs to the "Regionalbahnhof" or "local trains" at Terminal 1. From Plattform 1 run S8 and S9 direction [[Hanau]] or [[Offenbach]]. All S-Bahn trains serve Frankfurt Main Station (Hauptbahnhof) and the stations in the city center such as [[Hauptwache]] or [Konstablerwache]].
A single Ticket costs 4,90€ (available at vending machines in the station) per person and includes all connecting Metro, Tramway, Busses within Frankfurt. Prices are cheaper if you travel in a group.

==== Other airport connections ====

The Frankfurt airport also has connections for inter-city trains. Regional trains to [[Mainz]], [[Saarbrücken]] and [[Koblenz]] stop at the same place as the S-Bahn to Frankfurt. Connections outside the Frankfurt region have a separate train station, the ''Fernbahnhof'' ("long-distance train station"). Here, you can board high-speed trains to [[Cologne]], [[Munich]], [[Basel]], [[Dresden]] and other destinations.

==== Hahn airport ====
The smaller airport called ''Frankfurt/Hahn'' (IATA: HHN), mostly used by no-frills airlines such as RyanAir, advertises proximity to Frankfurt. However, Hahn is '''far away''' from Frankfurt and it takes about 2 h to drive there from the city centre. For that airport, if you have to use it at all, allow more time in your travel plans and budget. A bus [http://www.hahn-airport.de/default.aspx?menu=by_bus&cc=en#] from Frankfurt/Hahn to Frankfurt Main airport and on to ''Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof'' (Frankfurt Central Station) costs about €14 and leaves roughly every hour (much less often on Sundays, i.e. 8:00, 12:00 and so on): tickets are available from the kiosk, outside in front of the main entrance. Often this bus does not have capacity for everyone wishing to take it, resulting in waiting an hour for the next one or very expensive taxi rides.

===By train===
[[File:View from Frankfurt Main Station.jpg|thumb|View from Frankfurt Main Station]]
Frankfurt has two major train stations; the main station (''Hauptbahnhof'') and the Airport (''Flughafen Fernbahnhof''). A few long-distance trains call at the South Station (''Südbahnhof'') instead of the Hauptbahnhof. Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof is one of the biggest and busiest train stations in Europe and has a beautiful architecture, so it's definitely worth a visit. Frankfurt has connections to most German cities and most neighbouring countries via InterCity and high-speed InterCity Express trains. 

The S-Bahn (suburban trains) to the airport, the city centre and neighbouring cities leave from the underground platforms 101-104, accessible via stairs from the main entrance and vis-á-vis platforms 16-23. Additional S-Bahn trains as well as regional trains leave from the main hall. Check the specific timetables for connections to the airport. Platforms for long-distance trains are long, so allow extra time to locate the boarding area for your train.  Don't hesitate to ask someone for help the first time. There is a large departures signboard above the main exit/entrance with destination and platform information, and you can also get information from the railway travel office in the station.

From the main ticket office at Frankfurt you can buy 5 and 10 day rail travel cards which allow you to travel around Germany using all train services, including the Intercity ones. These are a significant saving on individual train fares. The 5 day ticket costs €189 and the 10 day ticket €289. You cannot buy these tickets from regional train stations.

===By car===

Frankfurt is connected to several autobahns and can be easily reached by car. Try to avoid rush-hour and especially snowy days, as car traffic can easily break down. Parking is definitely a problem in most areas. Especially during big conventions&mdash;such the ''Internationale Automobilausstellung'' (International Automobile Exhibition) in September, or the ''Frankfurter Buchmesse'' (The Frankfurt Book Fair) in mid-October&mdash;you should consider using the well designed park-and-ride system.

===By bus===

Frankfurt is serviced by various trans-European buslines like Eurolines [http://eurolines.com]. The main terminus is the central station (Hauptbahnhof). If you are on a tight budget, this can be a good way to reach Frankfurt.

==Get around==
[[Image:Frankfurt_citymap.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Frankfurt city map]]

===By public transport===

The best way to travel around Frankfurt is the U-Bahn (underground and overground), tram and bus. For connections to the suburbs use the S-Bahn.  The metro stations are signed with a white capital "U" on a blue background. To go to the suburbs or airport use the S-Bahn, signed with a white "S" on green background. All S-Bahn lines and the U-Bahn lines U6 and U7 come together in the Citytunnel in central Frankfurt (beside line S7, which ends at Central Station).

You can get single, all-day and weekly tickets. You can get individual tickets, or tickets for a group of up to five people travelling together.  

For Regionalbahn, S-Bahn, U-Bahn and trams you must use a ticket machine to '''purchase a ticket before boarding'''.  Ticket machines can be a little confusing if you do not know how to use them, but they can be switched to operate in English. You have to press ''Einzelfahrt Frankfurt'' for a single trip in the city (2.90 €) or ''Tageskarte Frankfurt'' for a day ticket in the city (7.00 € as of June 2016) or ''Gruppentageskarte'' for 5 people in the city (10.50 €). If you want to ride to airport, you have to press ''Einzelfahrt Frankfurt Flughafen'' (4.90 €) or ''Tageskarte Frankfurt Flughafen'' (9.10 €) or ''Gruppentageskarte Frankfurt Flughafen'' (15.80 €).  If your destination is outside Frankfurt, you enter your destination at the display and then choose for the type of ticket you want (''Einzelfahrt'' - single trip; ''Tageskarte'' - day ticket). Also, every station has some stations listed as "short distance" destinations (''Kurzstrecke''); these are all stations within 2km. to those tickets are cheaper.  If you have the opportunity, ask a bystander to explain the vending machines to you the first time you want to buy a ticket. Unlike in other German cities, tickets purchased are valid immediately. You cannot purchase tickets in advance, to be validated just before travel. When taking a bus you may purchase a ticket from the driver. 

Fares are based on the zones you travel through [https://www.rmv.de/auskunft/bin/jp/help.exe/dn?tpl=fullmap&himApp=show&queryApp=show&poisApp=show&stationsApp=show&showLineLayer=off&showBikeLayer=off&fullmapApi=OSM#70215].  The City of Frankfurt is all contained with a single zone (except Airport) so tickets (except short trip tickets) are all the one fare.  A one-day adult ticket in this central zone costs € 7.00 (June 2016).  The airport is in a separate zone. A one-day adult ticket in the central zone and the airport is € 9.10.  Group day-tickets are less than the cost of two adult day-tickets (€ 11.00 / € 15.80), so are more or less obligatory if you are traveling together and purchasing a day-ticket.  Children discounts are available to kids 14 and under. ''(May 2018)''

If you are visiting attractions and museums then consider buying a Frankfurt Card [https://www.frankfurt-tourismus.de/en]. It allows unlimited travel on Frankfurt's public transport system (city zone and airport) and discounts in many museums. The Frankfurt Card is available as a one day and two day ticket, and for a single person or a group of up to five (1 person 1 day €10.50, 2 days €15.50. These tickets are not sold at the vending machines. You can buy the Frankfurt Card at the airport (arrival gate B, terminal 1), at travel agencies, railway stations, at the tourist information desk at Hauptbahnhof, at the tourist information desk at Römer, or in advance online.  A one-day one-person Frankfurt card including airport transportation is cheaper than the equivalent public transport ticket that includes the airport.

The [http://www.rmv.de/en/ RMV] site has basic information and timetable information available in English and other languages.

The S-Bahn, run by the German train company, is notorious for its delays. If you need to get somewhere on time, allow for some buffer time. In the morning rush-hour, delays of 15 minutes are common. If you are catching a plane or have another similar time-critical appointment, allow an extra 30 minutes to be on the safe side.

Other services (subway, tram and bus) are usually more punctual.

Fines of €60 apply for riding without a valid ticket, and ticket inspections are frequent in Frankfurt, even in trams, and even on weekends. Trains to/from airport are always patrolled by ticket inspectors.

Most trains run from 5am to 1am. There are nightbusses "Nachtbus" covering all stations between 1am and 4am. All nightbusses start at Konstablerwache in the center.
To the airport and from Wiesbaden, Mainz, Offenbach and Hanau you can Use the Line S8 that runs 24/7 everyday. At night (1am -3am) Südbahnhof is served instead of Hauptwache and Kosntablerwache.
On weekends and before public holidays metro lines U4, U7 and U8 also run 24/7.

===By taxi===

Frankfurt has plenty of taxi drivers to service the many business travelers. The city is not too big, though fares tend to be expensive. Watch out for taxi drivers that take detours if they notice that you do not know the city. Still, for door-to-door transportation, taxis are a way to go.

Most taxi drivers love to drive to the airport because it's longer than inner-city fares, but not all taxi drivers are actually licensed to go there. They tend to drive very fast because most German business travelers expect them to do this. If you feel uncomfortable just let the driver know and he will slow down.

In the main tourist areas there are also human-powered "bike taxis" that convey one or two passengers. For those not too keen on walking this may be a convenient way of seeing the sights.

===By car===

Avoid using your car in the city, especially in the tourist "hot spots" like Sachsenhausen (especially on a Saturday) because of parking space. It's very limited, and people tend to park in places they're not supposed to. This ends up costing a fair bit if your car gets towed, which it often will. If you want to enter the city, your best bet is to use a ''Parkhaus'' (parking garage) (which charges a fee of €1 per hour or €8 for the whole day) and then either walk, or take public transport.

Many areas are reserved for local residents, in and outside the city. You will see the areas marked by parking signs that indicate a local permit is needed during certain hours during the day. The wording to be aware of is "Parkausweis Nr.X" (where X is a number). If you park in these spaces you risk a fine. 

Also remember that Germany has strict DUI (driving under the influence of alcohol) driving laws, only allowing 0.5 milligrams of alcohol per milliliter of blood. That is just about one beer or glass of wine. And although there are Autobahns without speed limits, when there are speed limits, these are enforced rigorously. Radar traps are frequent. Heavy on-the-spot fines can be levied. Recently the laws (and fines) pertaining to tailgating have been sharpened, and the fines have become larger.

===By bike===

Frankfurt is bike-friendly, featuring an expansive network of bike lanes. While there are various rental-bike companies in Frankfurt, they are relatively rare and situated in inconvenient areas of the city for travelers. A more convenient source of rental bikes may be Deutsche Bahn. Look out for their rental bikes, marked in the colours red and white and the letters "DB."

These bikes are available from April to December and can be found pretty much anywhere in the city - especially at street corners, which are the major pick-up and drop-off points. You can rent these bikes 24/7 just using your cell-phone and your credit card. German citizens can also sign-up for direct debit from their checking account. For instructions on how to use this service, call the number on the bike or go their website.

===By transfer service===

As already mentioned before in this article, during rush-hours and conventions it’s hard to find a place to park; due to that I would suggest taking a transfer service.
The good thing about a transfer service is you can book it for the way from the airport to the hotel and vice versa; you could potentially also book your ride to any kind of fairs or conventions taking place.

The Römer itself is the town hall of Frankfurt. At the Römer, you can also visit the Alte Nikolaikirche (built in 1290, taking its current form in the 15th century). Several restaurants, cafés and smaller shops can be found at the square itself and in the vicinity.  Walking towards the Main river, you approach the Eiserne Steg, a 19th century bridge leading to Sachsenhausen, as well as the Rententurm (Customs Tower), a 15th century fortified tower in late Gothic style, connected to the Saalhof, an old 12th century castle building that was later modernized but never completely destroyed.</see>

The place is named after a Baroque building ("Hauptwache") located more or less in its centre. The building was constructed in 1730 to house the local city militia, as Frankfurt was an independent city at the time. When Frankfurt became part of Prussia, the building gradually lost its original function. Since 1905, it has instead been serving as a café ("Café Hauptwache").

===Museums===

Museums in Germany are generally closed on Mondays (there are exceptions); the exact opening hours on other days depend on the museum. If you want to visit a museum on a public holiday, check with them before to be sure they open on that day.

The museums in Frankfurt offer a wide range of exhibits. Many museums are clustered on both banks of the Main in a district called [http://www.museumsufer-frankfurt.de/portal/en/News/Start/0/0/0/0/2360.aspx '''Museumsufer''']. To get there, take the subway  to '''Schweizer Platz''' (southern bank) or Willy-Brandt-Platz (northern bank), then walk towards the Main river. You can see the skyscrapers when you leave the station ''Schweizer Platz'', that's the direction you have to take. There are enough museums in Museumsufer to keep you occupied for a while, and it is especially suitable if you are staying in Frankfurt only for a short time.

The '''[http://www.museumsufer-frankfurt.de/portal/en/MuseumEmbankmentTicket/Start/0/0/0/0/2351.aspx Museumsufer Ticket]''' valid for admission to all municipal museums on two consecutive days and is available at all Frankfurt museums:

====Museum related events====

Three special events are associated with Frankfurt's museums.

* Every other Saturday morning there's a '''flea market''' until 16:00 at the Museumsufer. Other Sat. it is on Lindley Str near the Osthafen.

* Once a year (during the last weekend in August), a festival called '''[http://www.museumsuferfest.de/start-en Museumsuferfest]''' 26-28 August 2016 is organized at the Museumsufer with food, music and various other activities. It is quite popular locally and offers a good chance to mingle with the locals. You can buy a badge that will give you unlimited access to all the museums during the festival weekend. Many closed collections open to the public on this weekend. Sign up for tours at the Römer tourist office. A dragon boat races also takes place on the river during the festival weekend and can be watched from both sides of the river.

* '''Nacht der Museen''' [http://www.nacht-der-museen.de] (Long Night of Museums) One night a year (in the End of April, Sa. 10. May 2014), most Frankfurt museums are open to the public until the early morning of the next day. Special bus lines will take visitors from one to the next. Various special events are organized; for example dances, music performances, special exhibits, games, and so on. It is very crowded but also highly recommended; be prepared for very long lines. Buy a ticket in advance so you do not have to waste time during the night of the event on this, and do not forget to pick up a schedule of the events and map of the bus routes. Similar events are organized in other German cities as well.

===Skyline===

[[Image:Skyline-night.jpg|thumb|right|Frankfurt am Main Skyline]]

Frankfurt has some of the tallest buildings in Europe (the Commerzbank tower is the 2nd highest office building of Europe). Its skyline is unique for the country as the high-rises are concentrated in a relatively small city centre, giving Frankfurt the looks of a metropolis. The skyline is the reason why Frankfurt is sometimes called by the nickname '''Mainhattan'''.

* For a view of the skyline try the '''Main river bridges'''. The eastern bridges offer the best view. Also, when you approach the city from the airport via the subway, stay to the right side of the train. Just before the train approaches the Frankfurt central station it enters a big curve, and from here you will have a nice first glance of the skyline.

* Take a walk from ''Schweizer Platz'' northwards for another good view of the skyscrapers.

* The '''Main Tower''' [http://www.maintower.de/hlb/generator/Sites/Maintower/wwwroot/hpMaintower.en,templateId=ur.html] ''(Subway station Willy-Brandt-Platz or S-Bahn-station Taunusanlage)'' building is special as it is the only Frankfurt high-rise that is open to the public. For 7.50 Euro, you can take the elevator to the viewing platform at a height of 200 metres. From here, you will have a good view of Frankfurt and the surrounding area. Make sure to go on a clear day, and if you're in Frankfurt in Fall or Spring you might wish to try to go up a short while before sunset. That way, you can witness how the city changes from day to nightlife. The Main Tower is something that you should not miss during your stay. The viewing platform will be closed during severe weather. 

* The '''old European Central Bank''' in central Frankfurt (Subway station ''Willy-Brandt-Platz'') - easily recognized by its hexagonal layout and the big neon colour &euro; statue in front of the entrance - might be of some special interest as this is the seat of European financial power and decisions. It's not open to the public.

There are various '''fireworks''' displays throughout the year. Many major events - like the Museumsufer festival are ended with very well done fireworks. Check your local event schedule; if you are in the city these are always worth your time. The exception are the New Year fireworks, which are unorganized and less than spectacular. Good vantage points are the Main bridges, or the river banks.

* In the summer, a walk along the '''river Main''' is a nice thing to do. A lot of people will spend a sunny afternoon walking or sitting there on a lawn or playing frisbee or football. It's a relatively quiet area, considering it's in the heart of the city. Nearby cafes and restaurants allow you to have a drink in between. The only disadvantage is that it can be quite crowded when the weather is nice; try going during business hours on a weekday unless you're looking for a crowd.

Trams 12, 19, 20 and 21 also connect the Stadtwald with central Frankfurt.

===Fairs===

Frankfurt's trade fairs are known to have taken place as early as in the year 1160. The '''Messe Frankfurt''' [http://www.messefrankfurt.com/] is one of the world's largest exhibition centers, hosting a continuous stream of exhibitions small, large and gargantuan &mdash; the Motor Show draws almost a million visitors.  Most fairs are open to the public for at least part of the time, and can be a fascinating if somewhat overwhelming experience if you're interested in the theme.  The Messe has its own train station, ''Messe'', two stops away from the Central Railway Station (from platform 104, underground) on S 3/4/5/6, and there's also a Messe station on the U4 subway line.

==Work==
Frankfurt is one of the better locations in Germany to start looking if you want to find a job. It is the center of national and international banking/finance and there are also many high tech, chemical and pharmaceutical companies in the Rhine-Main area. All of these are more willing to accept people with no or less than adequate German skills if you can offer any other special skills.

Last but not least the airport and companies working for trade fairs always need people who speak English and other (seldom spoken) languages. Especially low skilled and very high skilled jobs are available. Make sure you have the proper permits and papers; working illegally can get you into a lot of trouble.

==Buy==

Frankfurt is a great place for shopping, as it caters both to tourists and to the local population, so you can find anything from haute couture to ridiculously cheap, and most of the shopping possibilities are located in the centre. The majority of shops are open until 8PM, though some of the larger city centre shops may close at 9 or 10PM. In general, shops are closed on Sundays.

There are of course restaurants all over Frankfurt. One notable area for dining may be what is locally known as the '''Fressgass''' (a literal translation would be "munching alley"). The correct name of this street is ''Grosse Bockenheimer Strasse''. As the nickname implies, the ''Fressgass'' features many cafes, restaurant, and deli food stores. It's a popular area to dine after the daily shopping. Take the subway to station ''Hauptwache'' or ''Alte Oper''. In late May to early June (exact dates vary each year), the '''Fressgass Fest''' takes place with food stands, cheap beer and live music.

If you are looking for an in-depth paper-based restaurant guide, a popular publication is ''Frankfurt Geht Aus'' (Frankfurt is going out), a magazine style dining guide of the city. It can be bought for €4.80 at many kiosks and book stores, or at the Tourism Information at the central station.

==Drink==
Frankfurt is a ''young'' city where socialising and parties are always high on the agenda. Sachsenhausen, Bockenheim, Bornheim, Nordend and the city centre are the main areas of action. The city center includes the rather seedy red light district -which is heavily patrolled by police and local council officials - near the main station. Strip clubs like the ''Golden Gate Frankfurt'' are popular for e.g. bachelor/bachelorette parties at the weekend and similar joints are in walking distance. Check pricing upfront to avoid problems with bouncers afterwards.

Due to the banks and business travellers the nightlife in Frankfurt is split into upmarket parties or alternative student parties. Generally clothing must be a bit more upmarket than the German average &mdash; sneakers may not be acceptable in some venues.

While high-profile clubs are usually open until morning hours, bars close at around 23:00-01:00 and small clubs at 03:00-04:00 during Saturday nights. Best bet for binging all-nighters is Alt-Sachsenhausen as a lot of bars there will stay open until sunrise.

===Ebbelwoi===
Alt-Sachsenhausen, a part of the suburb Sachsenhausen south of the Main river, is famous for its bars and '''Kneipen''' (a German type of Bar) serving the "regional speciality" '''Ebbelwoi''' (local dialect for "apple wine", sometimes spelled '''Ebbelwei'''). However, these days it's mostly for tourists. Good options in Alt-Sachsenhausen are Dauth-Schneider, Struwwelpeter and Lorsbacher Thal. Another option in Sachsenhausen is along Textorstrasse, a two minute walk south, where you can still find a row of authentic places catering to locals (Germania, Kanonensteppel, Feuerraedchen).

Not as famous as "Alt-Sachs", but also well known, is Bornheim (located in the north) which has also some beer-garden-like cider establishments on 'Berger Straße' and the surrounding area. Some of the popular apple-wine places in Bornheim are Solzer, Zur Sonne and Zur Schoenen Muellerin.

Drinking apple wine: Most locals drink their apple wine pure, but some drink it with a dash of sparkling water. Just order a glass by asking for a "Sauergespritzte" or simply a „Sauer“. You can also order a "Süßgespritzte", this is apple wine with a dash of Fanta or Sprite though this might earn you some disapproving looks from the waiters and locals. Legend goes that in the old days ordering Ebbelwoi mixed with something other than water would have you expelled from the very traditional pubs. Today some waiters will serve the apple wine and soda in separate glasses to leave the customer to commit the sacrilege.
If you are in a group you can also order a Bembel. This is a clay jug that comes in different sizes and keeps the apple wine cool.

===Cafes===
* '''Cafe & Bar Celona''' Holzgraben 31 (near ''Hauptwache''). Tel +49 69 13886709 [http://www.cafe-bar-celona.de] Daily 09:00-01:00, F-Sa 09:00-02:00. Spanish-style bar in the heart of the city. Popular, attracts a younger crowd, good for meeting people. Very crowded around 17:00-19:00. Also serves a variety of Spanish dishes. €7-20/person.

===Clubs===
There are '''many''' clubs in Frankfurt that cater to business people and organise corporate events. The German favour for electronic music results in a wide variation of clubs that offer this music. Alternative music is a niche market that cater the roots of the migrants in Frankfurt.

Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays open from 10 pm.</drink>

==Sleep==
Frankfurt has plenty of accommodation but during major trade fairs, prices at even the cheapest hotels will suddenly skyrocket with charges of over &euro;300/night quite common.  Plan well ahead and alternatively, consider staying in nearby cities like [[Darmstadt]], [[Neu-Isenburg]], [[Bad Homburg]], [[Mainz]] or [[Wiesbaden]] which are under an hour away by S-Bahn. If none of these works then [[Mannheim]] might be a last resort as it is 30mins by ICE high-speed train (but train ticket is rather expensive).

Frankfurt is the banking capital of Germany so most people are business travellers with an expense account. If you intend to stay for longer periods, ask for discounts or corporate rates. If you need to depart early or arrive very late then hotels around main station are a valid alternative to expensive airports hotels as it is just a 10 minutes ride from Terminal 1 by local train.

Many of the hotels in Frankfurt are located around the Hauptbahnhof, but near-by is also the red light district in Frankfurt and is also known for the many beggars and druggies who hang around. Although the area is well policed and quite safe, many tourists are often left with a somewhat negative impression of Frankfurt after staying in this area. If it’s not for you then there are plenty of cleaner areas in the city which you may find more suitable.

==Stay safe==

Frankfurt has had the highest per capita crime rate of all communities in Germany for years.[http://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article13570143/Frankfurt-ist-die-gefaehrlichste-Stadt-Deutschlands.html] For Germany the city is quite dangerous, but violent crime is not as common as in some cities in countries such as the United States and South Africa.

The high crime rates of Frankfurt can partly be explained with some statistical reasons: smuggling and similar offences at the airport as well as anything concerning credit card fraud anywhere in Germany is registered in Frankfurt, since the main credit card clearing company is based in Frankfurt.

Physical crime is in general concentrated in the red-light district around the central train station, which also is the hangout of  many drug dealers/junkies. The Gallus area west of the central station doesn't have the best reputation, either. Nevertheless, Frankfurt is still safe and it is highly unlikely that you will face armed robbery or other violent crimes. Use your common sense and avoid drunken or aggressive people at night.

If you have a problem or are being harassed, ask the police for help. The German police and the Frankfurt Ordnungsamt (City Enforcement Officers) are clean, competent and generally helpful. Germany is very bureaucratic but structured; as long as you behave respectfully toward the police, you should have no problem.

On the other hand, buying and smuggling drugs are major offenses with dire consequences.

Lately, bogus police officers have been an issue. All real officers have a green card with a photograph and a number, and no officer will check cash. Ring 110 if you have any trouble.

==Contact==

===Internet===

There are a number of Internet cafes in Frankfurt of varying prices and quality.

Free Wi-Fi at coffee shops are more and more common but most businesses require some purchases of food etc. to get the code. Various other hotels offer Internet access but usually at a charge.

Burger King (cnr Liebfrauenstrasse / Holzgraben) near Hauptwache offers free Wi-Fi in its restaurant, as does Starbucks near Hauptwache (Börsenplatz)
Many hotels also give WiFi free or with a surcharge.

===Phone===

Besides public pay phones and mobile phone services, a large number of stores sell prepaid telephone cards. This is especially useful for international calls. The PTT multi-media store - 65 Baseler Strasse, offers competitive rates for international calls (10 cents per min to the UK) Some other stores also offer in house phone services. Another easy to reach store that seems reliable is in the ''Hauptwache'' subway station.
You may also visit one of the plenty internet cafés, since they almost all offer cheap phone calls via internet.

===Post offices===

The postal service in Germany is '''Deutsche Post''' [http://www.post.de].

The four easiest-to-reach full-service postal offices are easy to locate:-
* Inside Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof (central station) by the long-distance ICE/IRE trains; near McDonalds. 
* In the Karstadt department store (ground floor) on the Zeil shopping street.
* On Goetheplatz
* At the Südbahnhof (Southern Station) take exit Diesterwegplatz and cross the square; the post office is to the left.

==Cope==
===Drugs and beggars===

The central station area (Hauptbahnhof) is known for being a center for homeless and perhaps drug users. It has improved much in recent years, but you will still occasionally be bothered by beggars. The drug addicts generally don't bother people, and the beggars will ask for '''Kleingeld''' (small change), which by their definition is anything between €0.20-2.  One way to fend off beggars is just to say you do not speak German (and this might just be true for you anyway!). They will often switch to English then, so just pretend you can not speak that either (just shake your head, or say "No English") and they will get frustrated and leave you alone.  If you think you are up to it, you may find it useful to know one or two sentences in the Frankfurter dialect to mimic locals, as tourists are often regarded as more profitable targets for beggars. Some of these phrases would be ''hurr owff'' (stop it), ''lass misch in ruh'' (leave me alone) or ''mach disch ab!'' (go away!). A polite ''Nein, danke'' (no thanks) will usually not do.
