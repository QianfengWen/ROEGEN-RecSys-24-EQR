'''Belgrade'''[http://www.beograd.rs/cms/view.php?id=220] (Serbian: Београд, ''Beograd'') — meaning 'White City' — is the capital of the Republic of [[Serbia]]. Various styles of architecture dominate the city while its recent resurgence as the leading hub in south-eastern Europe makes it a must-see destination.

Belgrade is the capital of Serbia and is, as such, the country's largest city with a population of about 1.7 million people. It lies on the confluence of the two major European rivers, Sava and [[Danube]]. The city has a long history, dating back to the 4th century BC when the area was settled by Celtic tribes. Later on, it became the Roman city of Singidunum, and relics of that era can still be seen in the city, particularly at Kalemegdan Fortress. During the Middle Ages, the town changed hands between the Kingdom of Hungary and the Serbian Despotate (of which it was the capital) until 1521 when it was captured by the Ottoman Empire. Until Serbia retained its independence in 1878, the city again changed hands multiple times, but between the Ottoman Empire and the Habsburg Empire.

After the First World War, Belgrade became the seat of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, from 1929) until its collapse in 1941, after the subsequent German invasion. During the Second World War, it was the seat of the Nazi puppet Government of National Salvation and it was heavily bombed twice, once by the Germans and once by the Allies. It was again liberated by the joint Yugoslav - Soviet Army. 

In 1945 Belgrade became the capital of communist Yugoslavia (although the country wasn't part of the Eastern Bloc after the notorious Yugoslav - Soviet split in 1948), led by Marshal Josip Broz Tito until his death in 1980. During this period Belgrade became the economic, cultural, and political center of the Balkans, as the country was balancing itself between the East and the West. 

This period of stability did not last, and the country broke up into five new republics after the Yugoslav wars. Not long after that, the city saw violence again in 1999, as it was heavily bombed for 78 days by NATO forces. Finally, in 2006, the city became the capital city of the independent Republic of Serbia. This often violent history and outside influence has colored much of Belgrade's evolution, which is evident in its culture and architecture. Often caught between the hammer and anvil of clashing empires, the city has taken on a unique character, reminiscent of both Austrian and Turkish influences, with a unique set of Communist elements thrown in by the Marshal Tito Government. Yet, the city has its own spirit, and in it can be found some not only unique features but also a healthy ''joie de vivre'' in its café culture, nightlife, and often a Mediterranean flavor in its lifestyle.

While there isn't much ethnic or cultural diversity in Belgrade compared to other European cities, there are some minority communities (largely Roma and Chinese), as well as people from other former Yugoslav republics, such as Bosnia, Croatia, and Macedonia. There is also a small expat community. 

Cultural events from around the world, however, are starting to become increasingly common, particularly in the spring and summer months, due to the involvement of local arts and culture organizations, as well as foreign embassies and cultural centers. These attract a good deal of local attention and are helping to raise the city's profile as a cultural hotspot. Belgrade is an energetic city re-discovering its tourism potential.

===Climate===
Belgrade has a typical humid continental climate. Temperatures from December to January are usually around freezing during the night and around 5°C (42°F) during the day. The mercury can occasionally drop down to -10°C (14°F) when cold waves from Siberia hit [[Serbia]] and the record low is -18°C (0°F). Snow is frequent during the winter and can fall as early as November and as late as April. Winters are also really cloudy with only 65.4 hours of sunlight on average in December. Summers on the other hand are sunny and can become hot during the afternoon and the heat can feel much more oppressive in the city. Temperatures can reach 35°C (95°F) sometimes and, rarely, 38°C (100°F). The record high is 43.6°C (110.5°F). Belgrade also receives a moderate amount of precipitation during the summer mainly in the form of thunderstorms.

[[File:Belgrade Airport.jpg|thumb|Belgrade Airport]]
'''Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport'''[https://beg.aero/eng/flights#departures] ({{IATA|BEG}}) is 18km west of the city center, located in the vicinity of Surčin and is the home base of Air Serbia ({{IATA|JU}}), which flies to nearly 50 destinations worldwide. The airport has been opened as a regional hub. Other major airlines that fly to Belgrade are Aeroflot, Qatar Airways, Turkish Airlines, Lufthansa, KLM, Austrian, and Swiss International. Discount and no-frills carriers offer a modest number of flights, including Wizz Air, Pegasus Airlines, Norwegian Air, easyJet, and FlyDubai.  
Here is the full list of carriers that operate to and from Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport:

To travel between the airport and the city consult the website of Nikola Tesla Airport. 

* '''Bus 72'''[http://www.beg.aero/en/strana/8811/bus] runs approx. 2x per hour from the upper departure level at Terminal 1 to Zeleni Venac market in the city center. The tickets (except for the one ride ticket) can be bought from the shop that sells food and newspapers inside the departures hall, although they may not be available and suggest you buy on the bus. The trip takes about 40 - 60 minutes (depending on the traffic) and the buses run from 04:40 to 23:40.  See this URL link for the current schedule and route map.  As of September 2022, the public_transportation fees are: 
*89 RSD (time-limited ticket, 90 minutes)
*150 (one ride ticket, this is the price if the ticket is bought on the bus).
*280 RSD (daily ticket)
*720 RSD (3 day ticket)
*1100 RSD (5 day ticket)

* '''Minibus A1'''[https://beg.aero/eng/parking_access/transport/public_transportation], operates between the airport and Slavija Square, stopping at Fontana (Novi Beograd) and Belgrade - Glavna railway station. The buses are comfortable and air-conditioned. The fare is 400 RSD, which is paid on-board; be sure to tell the driver what your destination is before departure. The trip takes 30-40 minutes.

* If you prefer to take a '''taxi''', read [[#General_precautions|General precautions]] below. In theory, the taxi fare from the airport is fixed - you can buy vouchers for the taxi once you pick up the luggage and clear the customs. The price range is from 1400 RSD to Novi Beograd, 1800 RSD to central Belgrade, and from 2200 RSD to the suburbs. However, in reality, once you buy a voucher and get to the taxis, the taxi drivers may refuse the vouchers or will ask for extra money to get you to your destination. If this is the case, be firm and try to find a driver that will accept the voucher without any extra cost. You can also order a taxi by phone or simply go upstairs to the left until you get to the '''departure section''' and catch one of the taxis dropping off passengers (UPDATE: As of July 2022 the Airport is undergoing a reconstruction, including the drop-off point at the departure section which is now closed. The Taxis now stop near the control tower. Once you exit the airport, keep going forward through the construction area until you reach a parking lot, and then turn left and continue forward until you see the tower and the nearby road. There you can hail one on the street. If you order a taxi by phone, the dispatcher will confirm the pickup location or will give your phone number to the taxi driver so that he can contact you and explain where will he be waiting for you). You can find the list of the most reliable taxi companies that operate out of Nikola Tesla airport on this link [http://www.beg.aero/lat/strana/8901/taksi-udruzenja]. Luggage fees are usually non-existent, but some companies charge them for luggage that weighs over 30 kg.
It is worth noting that you cannot change dinars inside the airport, and while the airport shops will accept dinars, all prices will be stated in Euros.

It's also worth noting that the airport duty-free is vastly overpriced. For example, bottles of Viljamovka - pear rakija with a pear grown inside the bottle - sell for the equivalent of around 10 euros in convenience stores throughout the city center but are priced at 74 euros in the airport. If you're planning to take bottles home as souvenirs you would be best placing them in your hold luggage.

===By train===
'''Update''' The Main Railway Station - Glavna Railway Station - in the center of the city is '''closed'''.

As of 1 July 2018, all domestic and international trains depart from and arrive at the main railway station officially called '''Beograd Centar''' but more commonly known by the name '''Prokop''' amongst locals. The exception to this is the trains to Bar, Sofia, and Skopje which depart from '''Topčider Station''' (reached using tram No. 3).

The Beograd Centar - Prokop station is located between the Senjak and Autokomanda areas of Belgrade and can be reached by public transport, by taking buses 34 and 36, trolleybuses 40 and 41. Furthermore, the run-down '''Beovoz''' suburban trains link the station with '''Vukov Spomenik''' in the city center.

The Prokop station has minimal facilities for now so it is recommended that you buy everything you need for your journey before arriving at the station, such as food and water.

* [[Budapest]]: Two daily trains between Budapest and Belgrade. InterCity ''Avala'' leaves at 12:05 from Budapest - Keleti station, arriving in Belgrade at 20:13. Another daily train, the ''Ivo Andrić'' leaves at 08:05 from Budapest - Keleti station, arriving at 16:32. In addition to that, the overnight train ''Beograd'' leaves at 22:25 from Budapest - Keleti station and arrives to Belgrade at 6:21. There are reservation - free seats for all trains. One way ticket is 15 EUR and the return ticket is 26 EUR (this offer is called the "Belgrade special", as of July 2016). '''Beware of people posing as very friendly guards, trying to enter your sleeping compartments on the night train from Belgrade to "help" you, as they are trying to rob you. They will leave your compartment door unlocked and rob you when you fall asleep. Do not listen to them and ask them to show you their work credentials to be sure. Also, it is good to secure your door apart from the lock, just to make sure, as these people know how to break into compartments. This is known to have occurred as soon as you cross the border into Hungary, but it is a quite rare occurrence'''.

{{infobox|'''IMPORTANT: Update 2022'''
Construction works to reduce travel time between Budapest and Belgrade are still ongoing. The section between Novi Sad and Belgrade is now operated at a higher speed. Now the rest of the line is being upgraded. Only the border-crossing section between Kelebia and Subotica is currently operated by train. Intermediate stations such as Kiskőrös can only be reached by Volánbusz (MÁV tickets are not accepted), except Kiskunhalas, which can be reached by changing trains in Kiskunfélegyháza. Travelers have two daily connections between Budapest and Belgrade, departing from Budapest Nyugati pu. at 5:53 and 11:53 towards Szeged (arriving 12:07 and 18:07 the other way round), then by bus to Kelebia and border-crossing to Subotica. In Subotica there are numerous connections by bus to Novi Sad - and from there finally by train to Belgrade. Traveling time takes 11 to 12 hours. }}

* [[Ljubljana]]: One daytime train, leaving at 8:25, and one seasonal night train, leaving at 21:05. There is a discounted ''Belgrade Special'' ticket, non - non-refundable and bound to specified train and day, costs 29 EUR (one way, reservation included in price).
* [[Podgorica]] and [[Bar]], [[Montenegro]]: One daytime and one-night train (plus 2 more during the summer season). The price to Bar is 21 EUR plus a 3 EUR compulsory seat reservation or 6 EUR couchette reservation (6 seats).
* [[Skopje]]: One daytime train, leaving at 8:20, and a night train, leaving at 22:14. Return ticket costs EUR 32.60 EUR ("Serbia special").
* [[Sofia]]: One-day train in summer, which leaves at 9:30. One-way ticket costs 20.60 EUR. In the off-season, changes are required at Dimitrovgrad (a Serbian border town) and Niš.
* [[Thessaloniki]]: No direct train: There is a bus that leaves at 18:50 for Gevgelija (border town in North Macedonia), then a night train via Skopje and Niš. One way ticket costs 33.80 EUR, return 54 EUR.
* [[Timişoara]]: Unfortunately, there's no longer a cross-border train connection between Romania and Serbia.
* [[Vienna]]: Daily train from Vienna - Hauptbahnhof at 9:12h. The return ticket costs 70 EUR.
* [[Zagreb]]: One daytime train, leaving at 11:05, and one night train, leaving at 23:48. The regular ticket costs 24.40 EUR one way, while the return ticket costs 48.80 EUR. It is important to emphasize that every additional passenger has a 50% discount for the return ticket (just ask for the "City Star" ticket). For example, the "City Star" return ticket costs 73.20 EUR for two passengers.

=== By bus ===
[[File:Belgrade train and bus stations.jpeg|thumb|right|Locations of main train and bus stations]]
Belgrade Bus Station, also known as BAS (short for Beogradska Autobuska Stanica), is right next to the central train station, on Karađorđeva Street. While coach service to national and international destinations is frequent and departure times are usually reliable, beware that the arrival times may not be. The timetables aren't clearly posted and are in Serbian only, so ask for information inside the terminal. When buying a bus ticket for national travel, you will also receive a token to enter the platform area. For international travel, you will be given a paper stub to present at the platform gate.

Be aware that most coach drivers will charge you a fee of approximately 100 RSD per bag for baggage handling in the cargo compartment, though this is not a uniform practice with international travel. Also, beware that drivers rarely speak English or any other foreign language. Inform yourself about your trip prior to departure as much as you can; if in doubt, ask a fellow passenger for assistance. Coach travel in Serbia is a hit-and-miss experience. While there is a huge number of companies to choose from, not all of them have clean, modern coach fleets, particularly for travel within Serbia or to neighboring ex - ex-Yugoslav countries. Coaches are more often clean and modern when embarking on trips to Western Europe. For long trips, drivers usually stop for 15-minute breaks roughly every two hours, though this isn't by any means guaranteed. Pack appropriately with food and bottled water. When disembarking on breaks during the trip, make sure to either secure your belongings or take them with you. When you get off the bus, you'll probably be offered a taxi ride or baggage-carrying by some men. Do not accept these offers. They may be illegal and the intention may be to rip you off.

For international trips to the rest of Europe, Lasta[http://www.lasta.rs] is the Eurolines carrier.

===By car===
'''From Hungary'''

If you are coming from [[Hungary]], you should use the E75 highway (M5 in Hungary, A1 in Serbia). After crossing the border at Horgoš - Röszke, you will pass through [[Subotica]] and [[Novi Sad]]. It is a 2-hour ride from the border. This route has a ticket-based toll system - you take a ticket when you enter the tolled portion of the highway, and then provide the ticket when you exit the highway to determine the amount of the toll.  Credit cards are accepted for the tolls.  If continuing your travel into Hungary through Serbia, you will need to separately buy a "vignette" after crossing into Hungary to pay the Hungarian portion of tolls to continue on the highway. Vignettes are available for sale at various gas stations and small shops near the border crossings.

'''From Montenegro'''

Use the E763 highway, also known as the Ibarska Magistrala (M22 in Serbia). After crossing the border at Gostun - Dobrakovo, you are going pass through [[Zlatibor]], [[Užice]] and Čačak before reaching Belgrade, But beware that this is a mountainous road and accidents are common, especially during the summer. It takes about 5 - 6 hours from the border to Belgrade. Also beware of the road works, as the road is slowly being upgraded to a dual-carriageway. The first section, from Ljig to Preljina will open on the 25th of August, 2016. 

'''From Slovenia and Croatia'''

Use the E70 highway, when coming from [[Ljubljana]] or [[Zagreb]] (A3 in Croatia and Serbia). You will enter Serbia at the Batrovci - Bajakovo border crossing. From there it takes 1 hour to Belgrade.  

'''From Romania'''

Use the E70 highway, coming from [[Timișoara]] (M10 in Serbia, DN59 in [[Romania]]). You will cross the border at Vatin - Moravița and pass through Vršac and Pančevo. It takes around 2 hours to Belgrade. 

'''From Macedonia'''

Use the E75 highway (A1 in Macedonia and Serbia). You will cross the border at Tabanovce - Preševo, and go through [[Niš]] and [[Kragujevac]], before reaching Belgrade. It takes about 4 hours and 30 minutes to get to Belgrade.

'''From Bulgaria'''

Use the E80, and the E75 highways (A4 and A1 in Serbia). After crossing the border at Kalotina-Gradina, use to E80 to Niš and join the E75 there, continuing to Belgrade. It takes 4 hours to complete the trip from the border.

'''From Albania'''

Use the [[Tirana]] - [[Priština]] highway, then continue to Niš and join into the E75 highway to Belgrade. It takes 6 hours to complete the trip from the first border. Beware that you will be crossing 2 borders, out of which, one is administrative.

'''When coming from [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] it is recommended to go into [[Croatia]] and use the A3 highway to Belgrade, as the infrastructure in Bosnia and Herzegovina is in bad shape'''.

[[Image:Beo trolejbus 00.jpg|thumb|A Belgrade trolleybus]]

===By boat===
Belgrade lies where the rivers Sava and the Danube meet. Passenger ships enable you to reach every place along the Danube in a very convenient and meditative manner with many fascinating attractions along the way, but it is a quite slow and rather expensive way of traveling.

===By bicycle===
Belgrade is located on the European bicycle route which connects the Atlantic Ocean and the Black Sea.

==Get around==
[[Image:800px-65lb.jpg|thumb|Belgrade traffic during rush hour from 2006]]

===By public transport===
GSP Beograde[https://www.gsp.rs/naslovna.aspx] (ГСП in [[Serbian phrasebook|Serbian]] Cyrillic) operates an extensive public transport network of buses, trolleybuses, and trams in the city and suburbs. There is a BusPlus android app[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.busplus] for checking wait times for the next vehicle to arrive at any given stop.
Also, you can use the Plan Plus[http://www.planplus.rs/] website and Android App for route planning. 

There are 12 tram lines, hundreds of bus lines, 8 trolleybus lines, and 9 public minibus lines (E1–E9).  Google Maps does a good job of outlining different public transport options, as well as their scheduled times.  

The trams in Belgrade are enjoyable to ride.  Many of them are Soviet-era vehicles that have not been updated but are clean and well-maintained.  It can feel like going back in time to see the driver have to get out of the vehicle to manually switch the tracks.

====Fares====
{{infobox|'''IMPORTANT Update as of May 2023!'''
As of 17th of March 2023 a new fare system is being introduced. This article has been updated will all the information known so far. Previous information regarding the BusPlus system and the validators is no longer valid. If you happen to have an old BusPlus plastic card, you will need to replace it. }}

As of 17th of March 2023, the prices of fares have changed and new tariff zones have been introduced. Tickets do not need to be validated on machines inside the vehicle, as was the case before the new system began. Instead, the tickets are valid from the moment of purchase. This means that if you buy a paper 90-minute ticket, its validity doesn't start from the moment you enter a bus, but from the moment you buy it, so take it into account if the bus stop is not close by. Tickets are also valid for BG:Voz [[#By commuter rail|commuter rail]], but ''not'' for BeoVoz and minibusses. You can see the full ticket prices here[https://ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/r1kk9kpTURBXy83ZDVkZWZkZDIyMDQ3MjM5Y2E2NGNkOWRmMDRlZDYyOC5qcGeRkwLNBLAA3gABoTAF].

There are several ways to buy a ticket:
* Through SMS via number 9011, however, this only includes domestic mobile carriers, so if you have a foreign number you will not be able to use this method. You can buy a Serbian prepaid SIM card and use it to buy the tickets.  
* Buying a paper ticket. However, as of now, there are only 5 locations in Belgrade available to buy a ticket: Skender Begova 47, TC Trg Republike ("Staklenac" Shopping Mall), Knez Mihajlova 6 (2nd floor), Deligradska 10, Bulevar Mihajla Pupina 167. Paper tickets will be available at kiosks in the near future. 
* Buying a ticket through the smartphone app. However, the app is still in development and it's unclear when it will become available. 

Children under the age of 7 ride free.

City transport is now divided into two tariff zones. The first tariff zone is for all the buses within the inner and the outer city limits (zone A), while the second tariff zone includes the outer and suburban areas of Grocka, Barajevo, Sopot, Obrenovac, and the cities of Mladenovac and Lazarevac (zone B). If you need to travel between the two zones, you will need a zone C ticket, which includes both zones. If you are staying in Belgrade, you will mostly be riding in zone A, therefore the prices in this article are in this zone.

Every station should be clearly marked on which zone it belongs to (the Serbian word for zone is "Zona" ).

=====Single ticket / 90-minute ticket=====
You cannot purchase a ticket for a single ride. This ticket has been replaced by a 90-minute ticket and the price is RSD50. When you enter a bus, you no longer have to validate your ticket. Also, you can no longer pay for the 90-minute ticket using Mastercard Contactless. You can buy a 90-minute ticket by sending an SMS with text A90 to 9011. (NOTE: Not available for foreign carriers). 

=====Day and multi day tickets=====
If you plan to use public transportation often, you can buy a 1-day ticket (120 RSD), a 7-day ticket (800RSD) or a 30-day ticket (2200RSD). For purchasing tickets via SMS, codes are A1 for a 1-day ticket, A7 for 7-days ticket, and A30 for a 30-day ticket.

Night buses are now free to use. They have the N suffix and they operate from 00:00 until 04:00. 

=====Minibus=====
Minibus fares are RSD150, payable to the driver.

=====Inspection=====
Ticket inspection in the daily buses is carried out by the Communal police of Belgrade or "Beli". If you are caught without a ticket the fine is 2500RSD which you pay in the next 8 days, after that the fine is 5000 dinars.

====Hours====
Daily transport starts at 04:00 and ends at 00:00. Night transportation is operated only by buses. It is sparse and goes every half-hour to every hour, but there are plans to make all night lines depart every half-hour. It is best to ask where and when to use it since some of the night lines are modified versions of the daily ones. 

Tram Line 2 is famous in the city with a circular route, running in both directions. The circle is known as ''krug dvojke'' (#2's circle) and rings the central city streets. Line 3 is famous for the beautiful neighborhoods it goes through, particularly Miloš's Konak Park.3

=== By commuter rail ===
'''BG:Voz''' (BG:Train) is an additional line. These trains run according to schedule which is every 30 minutes (15 minutes on rush hour). 

Note that trains are often late and delayed.

===By taxi===
Taxis are cheap by European standards, though far more expensive than anywhere else in Serbia.

====General precautions====
[[Scams#Taxi_Scams|Taxi scams]] are common in Belgrade. It is always best if you order the taxi by phone since your order will be saved in the operator database. Here[http://www.beograd.rs/cms/view.php?id=201690] is the official info about taxi services in Belgrade. Taxi fares are regulated by the government and are as follows: RSD140 to start a ride, RSD55-110 per kilometer (depending on the time of day), and RSD12.5 per minute waiting time. The most recommended taxi services in Belgrade are Beogradski Taxi and Pink Taxi Beograd[https://www.pinktaxi.info].

Be sure to choose a taxi with a roof sign with the city coat of arms and a number, indicating it's a city-regulated radio taxi. Never take a privately owned cab - the one with the white marker on the top that does not list the name of the company - since you can pay up to four times the normal price. Also, legal taxis must have their license plates ending with ''TX'' (for example BG-1234-TX).

Insist that the trip be metered. The only exception is the case when you take a taxi from the airport, where you may approach the taxi desk for a receipt stating a fixed price for travel to various parts of the city. You will pay the driver the exact amount stated on the receipt given to you at the airport desk. Tipping taxi drivers is welcomed but not required, and your luggage transport is included in the metered price.

If you believe that the driver is trying to rip you off, call the operator of that taxi association to check if the price is regular for the specified distance. Afraid of the inspection, they might call back the driver and bring him to reason. Also, ask for a signed bill indicating the date, time, start and end destination, price, and driver's signature. Write down the number on the blue sign on the vehicle roof, as well as the license plates. Report the incident to city inspection (+381-11/3227-000) and if you are going from or to the airport, report it also to airport inspection (+381-11/2097-373, taxi@beg.aero). If the driver is aggressive towards you, call the police.

=== By car ===
As in most of Europe, you must keep to the right side of the road. Avoid rush hours (8:30–9:30AM, 4:00–6:00PM). Belgrade is not [[Rome]], [[Moscow]], or [[Beijing]], but getting around can be stressful if you aren't used to traffic congestion combined with aggressive local driving habits. Plan your journey if you are going into the city core, and expect to have a hard time finding free parking places on the streets during Friday and Saturday evenings in the center. Garages might be a better choice. 

Keep your low-beam headlights turned on, during both day and night. The speed limit on the streets of the city is 50 km/h, near schools even less, and on the highway is higher. Police is known to wait at places where you might feel comfortable to drive over the limit, but almost never on the highway. Take special care while crossing Branko's bridge, and driving on the following streets: Bulevar Mihaila Pupina, Jurija Gagarina, Vladimira Popovića, and other major ones. Keep your seat belts fastened. Other passengers must also do the same, even when sitting in the back seat (if there are seat belts installed).

The allowed level of blood alcohol content (BAC) is 0.03%, which is roughly equal to one drink. If you do go by car to drink, consider going back using a taxi or '''Safe driver''' service, +381-64/1746-411. They will come to pick you up on the small, folding motorcycle, pack it in your trunk, and drive you back home in your car. Their charge is modest, and slightly higher than a one-way ride with the taxi (~5€ for <5km, ~7€ for <10km, and ~10€ for >10km).

===Rent a car===
Renting a car in Serbia is a great way to see the country! However, a car rental is probably not beneficial if you are staying only in Belgrade.  Parking is difficult to find, parking tickets are common, and there is a myriad of cheap public transport options available.

If you rent a car, you will be provided with the owner's card. Carry this around with you and do not leave it in the car.  Also, be sure to inform your rental car agency if you plan to take your rental car outside of Serbia.

==== Yellow lanes ====
Many boulevards and some streets have yellow lanes. They are reserved for public transport, i.e. buses and taxis, and you are not allowed to use them. The yellow lanes are marked with a yellow line and are indicated on traffic signs. Some yellow lanes, though, are active only in certain periods of the day, usually during rush hours.

==== Parking ====
There are spaces for parking in the city center. There is a large parking garage with 500 spaces under the old palace in the city center, across from the parliament building.

Also, take into consideration that in the center almost all of the parking spaces in the central streets have zones marked with green, yellow, or red paint on the street (yellow zone spaces are actually marked orange, to avoid confusion with other marks). You can only stay for 3, 2 or 1 hour, respectively, in those spots. You can pay using the machine usually found near the parking spots, buy the parking ticket at a kiosk, or by cell phone (just text your car's license plate number (for example BG123456) to numbers 9111 (red zone), 9112 (yellow) or 9113 (green)). Every message you send is valid for one hour and, some 5 minutes before the hour has passed, you get a text message telling you that you can send another SMS if you want to extend your parking for the next hour. Of course, this only applies in yellow and green zones, in which you can park for more than 1 hour. After the time is up, you'll have to re-park or risk paying a fine (around €15). All of this only applies on weekdays, from 7AM to 9PM and from 7AM to 2PM on Saturdays. After that (Sa 2PM – Mo 7AM) parking is free.

There are also several public parking garages and parking lots where you can park for an unlimited amount of time during the day. Fees are charged on an hourly basis (price varies, usually around €0.7-0.9/hour). In some non-zoned areas, you also pay for parking depending on the duration of your stay, and this is paid in cash to the parking attendant.

Parking violations are dealt with rather swiftly in the city center and with less commitment in the peripheral zones. Failure to pay for parking in a marked spot is handled by parking enforcement officers and can only result in a fine which would be difficult to collect if you're operating a foreign licensed vehicle. On the other hand, illegally parked vehicles are handled by the traffic police. Once spotted, the police are required to wait for 15 minutes for the driver to return. If you do return in time, you will be issued a sanction and a fine (around €50). When the 15 minutes are up, your car will get towed to one of 4 designated lots in the city. Once at the lot, you will be required to present a valid form of ID and the vehicle matriculation papers, pay the mandatory fine and towing expenses (around €90 in total).

For the other parking options, there are a lot of unused private parking spaces all around the city. In a time when everybody has a smartphone, there's a new possibility - parking share. Lako Parkiraj is an online service that connects owners of parking spaces with those who need to park. You can use it to easily find and book parking places in Serbia in advance. Detailed information can be found on the Lako Parkiraj website.

=== By boat ===
Small boats connecting Ada Ciganlija to Novi Beograd's Block 70a are the only mode of public transport on rivers. Also, there are several tourist boats that offer day and night cruises along the Sava and Danube.

=== By bicycle ===
Old Belgrade is pretty hilly and the bicycle infrastructure is scarce, so bicycle transport isn't in wide use. However, New Belgrade and Zemun are relatively flat and offer enough space for bikes to be used. Bicycle tracks link Zemun, Dorćol, Ada Ciganlija, New Belgrade, and Bežanijska kosa. There is a bike lift on Brankov Bridge operating 365 days and the ride is free of charge. There are also more than 50 bicycle racks around the city.

Riding a bike on the same roads as cars and buses is considered too dangerous, although on smaller streets it can be reasonably safe. Avoid riding on major (multilane) roads. Unfortunately, you are not allowed to bring bikes into public transport vehicles.

Bicycle rentals are available mostly in recreational areas like Ada Ciganlija or Zemun Quay. 

=== By foot ===
Belgrade is mostly pedestrian-friendly. The city center can be seen on foot and the main pedestrian street is Knez Mihajlova which connects to the Kalemegdan fortress. The riverbanks are also full of people on weekends when the weather is nice. Belgrade also has a lot of beautiful parks. The pedestrian paths are mostly in good shape but be careful in some places, especially in Skadarlija where the old cobble path is in pretty bad shape.

There are plans to expand the pedestrian zone near Knez Mihajlova Street. Work has already begun to transform several streets into pedestrian areas and in a couple of years, the entire area around Knez Mihajlova and the Republic square should be traffic-free.

==See==
As mentioned, Belgrade's city core is not too big. Everything between Kalemegdan, Knez Mihajlova Street, and Skadarska Street is best viewed on foot. Other than that, it is recommended to use other means of transportation. '''Note''' that many of Belgrade's museums are closed on Monday. It may be wise to check before making a visit.
[[Image:18848bg6tc2.jpg|thumb|The massive Kalemegdan and Belgrade Fortress complex]]

===Churches and Monasteries===
* '''Church of Saint Alexander Nevsky''' (Serbian Cyrillic: Црква Светог Александра Невског), Cara Dušana 63, Dorćol (near Skadarlija). The history of this church dates back to the time of the Serbian-Turkish War (1876) when Russian volunteers arrived in Serbia under the command of General Mikhail Chernyaev. The old church was built in 1877 but was later demolished in order to build a bigger one, which was completed in 1912, and designed by the famous Serbian female architect Jelisaveta Načić. There is a memorial plaque in honor of the fallen Serbian and Yugoslav soldiers, Russian czar Nicholas II, and King Alexander Obrenović inside the church. The frescoes have eroded over time, and the interior is currently rather simple, apart from the impressive marble iconostasis.
* '''Church of Saint Father Nicholas''' (Serbian Cyrillic: Николајевска Црква), Njegoševa 43, Beograd. It was built in 1745 and is currently the oldest church building in Belgrade. It contains one of the most beautiful baroque iconostases in Serbia. It is located at the foot of the hill known as Gardoš (Гардош), near the Danube, in the municipality of Zemun.
* '''Church of the Birth of Saint John the Baptist''' (Serbian Cyrillic: Црква Рођења светог Јована Крститеља), Central Cemetery (Centralno groblje), Zaplanjska 47a. A small graveyard church, located in the Voždovac municipality, contains a unique historical relic of large significance, protected by UNESCO: the iconostasis that was brought to the church in the 70s was built by Serbian and Russian officers who were interned in Bad Sulza concentration camp for the chapel in the camp.
* '''Church of the Holy Virgin''' (Serbian Cyrillic: Црква Покрова Пресвете Богородице), Kajmakčalanska 55, Zvezdara, Belgrade. It was built in 1933, in the Serbian-Byzantine style, richly adorned with frescoes and mosaics, and has a rich collection of relics. It is located between Buevara King Alexander, and Žiča Street, near the "Red Cross Square" (Црвени Крст).
* '''Holy Archangel Michael Orthodox Church''' (Serbian Cyrillic: Саборна црква), Tomb of Vuk Karadzic, Kneza Sime Markovića, Beograd 11000, [http://www.saborna-crkva.com/]. It is dedicated to Saint Archangel Michael and is located near Belgrade Fortress (Kalemegdan) at Kneza Sime Markovića 3. It was completed in 1840, and its interior was richly decorated in the fashion of Serbian neo-classicism. The building of the Serbian Patriarchate is located opposite the Cathedral, and it is also the location of the Museum of the Serbian Orthodox Church, as well as a beautiful patriarchal chapel dedicated to Saint Symeon.
* '''Presentation of the Virgin Monastery''' (Serbian Cyrillic: Манастир Ваведења Пресвете Богородице), Ljube Jovanovića Street No. 8, Senjak (Dedinje), [http://manastirvavedenje.org/].

* '''Ružica Church''' (Црква Ружица) and '''Church of Saint Petka''' (Црква Свете Петке) are located on Kalemegdan fortress, near the observatory (easy to miss, ask for directions). Ružica Church, dedicated to the Birth of the Holy Virgin Mary, was first mentioned in the 15th century; it was destroyed in the early 18th century, and later rebuilt in its present location. It was the military church of the garrison that was located in the fortress. It was once again destroyed in WWI by the Central Powers and then rebuilt again in 1925. At this time the church received its unique bronze soldier statues and the unusual chandeliers made out of bullet shells, swords, and bayonets, a unique example of trench art with religious motifs. Church of Saint Petka (Paraskevi) is located next to it; it was built around a miraculous spring and in honor of Saint Petka whose relics were kept in Belgrade fortress during the Middle Ages. 
* '''Saint Sava Temple''' (Serbian Cyrillic: Храм Светог Саве), Krušedolska 2a, Beograd 11000. The largest Orthodox church in Serbia, and one of the biggest Orthodox churches in the whole world. In 1594, Turkish vizier Sinan-paşa burned the holy relics of Saint Sava (1174-1236), founder of the autocephalous Serbian Orthodox Church, on the spot where the temple is located today, in retaliation for the rebellion of the Serbian people. Since then, the Serbs wished to erect a church in honor of Saint Sava at this location, and have first built a smaller church next to the place of the burning of the relics (this church also still stands, and is located to the left of the main entrance to the big temple). The temple was built in 1935 in several phases - interrupted first in 1941 by WWII, and later by Communist authorities, the work was only resumed in 1985. Interior decoration is not yet finished, however, visitors have access to the north aisle which is complete and in use. From the quality of the marble and plaster work already in place, it will be stupendous when it is finished. The underground crypt, the future burial site of Serbian patriarchs, dedicated to Saint Lazarus of Serbia, is also nearly completed. It is located near Slavija Square, easily accessed from Bulevar Oslobodjenja, and visible from most points of the city. Due to its impressive size, it is often called a cathedral, although it is not yet the seat of a bishop or the patriarch.
* '''St. Mark's Orthodox Church''' (Serbian Cyrillic: Црква Св. Марка), Bulevar kralja Aleksandra 17, Beograd. It was built from 1931 to 1940 and is located in Tašmajdan Park in Belgrade, near the Parliament of Serbia. It was designed as a copy of the famous [http://wikitravel.org/en/Prishtina#Get_out Gračanica] monastery near [[Priština]]. The most prominent Serbian ruler- Emperor Stefan Dusan the Mighty is buried there. Behind the church, there is the Russian Orthodox Church of the Holy Trinity, built by White Russian immigrants who came to Serbia after the Russian Revolution of 1917-1922.

''Stepin Vajat''(Степин Вајат) and ''Duff'' at ''Autokomanda'', ''Mega Mesko'' on the south corner of ''Republic Square'', ''Mara'' in downtown area and ''Iva'' in ''Žarkovo'' are the best grill fast food restaurants in town. 

For good-tasting ''Sarajevo pies'' try ''Fofa'' (Cyrillic: ''Фофа''). A nice gesture is that Fofa does not charge the pregnant women.

Visit a ''splav'' (literally: raft) barge restaurants located along the Sava and Danube rivers. There are two kinds of "splav".  Some are restaurants, but most are nightclubs. You can literally be clubbing all night long. There is no cover charge to get into any of them. Some ultra-popular ones may require that you have an invitation or be on the guest list, but if you tell them that you are a foreigner and that you didn't know, they'll usually let you in. Women are not required to be on a "guest list". The music played on the barges is highly varied and can include live bands, Serbian folk music, pop, and dance.

===International Cuisine===
There are a handful of international restaurants, including Italian, Chinese, and Japanese. These are from moderately priced to very expensive.

==Drink==
Nowadays local legislation states that all bars in the city must close at 1 a m. That said, there are many nightclubs to go to right afterwards that are open until 5 AM or later, including many in the city center.

Tap water in Belgrade is perfectly safe. There is a wide range of bottled waters on offer in grocery stores, supermarkets, and kiosks.

Serbs love beer, and it is possible to buy a variety of domestic beers such as Jelen, Lav, MB, Pils along with a few imported beers, at very cheap prices. The domestic beers are quite decent. Made in Serbia  beers also include Heineken, Amstel, Tuborg, Stella Artois, and Beck's. Belgrade holds a Beer Festival annually in August. 

{{infobox|Culture Tip: How to toast, Serbian style|Like everywhere, Serbs love to toast when in good company, whether it's in a pub or in the home with friends. When toasting in Serbia, it is expected that you look your friends at the table directly in the eyes whilst clinking glasses as a sign of respect. Say 'Živeli!' (cheers!) to everyone and take a sip. Repeat as necessary, and enjoy a night out in Belgrade!}}

Local wines can be good, although more expensive ones tend to be more drinkable, and many of the less expensive bottles are less than satisfactory. The national alcoholic drink is rakija, a Serbian brandy that is very strong and makes a good souvenir.

For the sober crowd, Belgrade has blueberry, raspberry, tomato, peach, apple, strawberry, and any other kind of juice you can think of.

All cafés serve the usual continental coffees', such as espresso and cappuccino. However, regular coffee comes in the form of Turkish coffee, not filtered coffee. If you want a filtered coffee, you need to specify this when ordering, and not all coffee shops have it. Also very popular is whipped instant coffee, commonly referred to simply as 'Nes' (as in, Nescafé). A cafe called Mali Prag (across from the Hotel Prag) is thought by some to offer the best "Serb Coffee" in the world.

There are a couple of places worth visiting if you are a fan of cafe culture. The street best known for its trendy cafes is definitely Strahinjića Bana. On this street, cafes are full even on weekdays. The best atmosphere is on Friday evenings when the trendy youth of Belgrade descend to enjoy the music and each other.

==Stay safe==
[[Image:1753810203c72d6269bb5cz.jpg|thumb|Belgrade in summer]]
Overall, Belgrade is an extremely safe city and has significantly lower rates of violent crime than most Western cities. But, like anywhere, you should always keep money, mobile phones, travel documents, and other valuable personal items in secure places. Pickpockets are known to operate in public transportation, and other crowded places so never wear a backpack or purse on your back, and make sure that you have your wallet in one of your front pockets. If you own a car, it is preferable to have a security system. Traffic laws are usually observed although nervous drivers can change lanes suddenly or make dangerous turns when avoiding traffic during rush hour. Taxi drivers are notorious for swerving in and out of lanes. Pay close attention to the traffic signals as a pedestrian. 

Also, try to avoid getting into conflicts. If you are staying out late in a bar or a club, there is always a small chance that someone will try to pick a fight especially if you are in a group and a single guy is showing hostility. That is a trap by local thugs looking for a brawl. That is not because you are a foreigner. It is just the "law of the streets": anyone can be the target. Just ignore them and walk away no matter what they say or do. The chances that this will happen are very low, but stay alert. Do ''not'' try to ''make fun'' of the locals in your native language. Almost everyone has at least a basic understanding of English and is familiar with foul words and curses. 

=== Emergencies ===
In case of an emergency, call 192 (police), 193 (fire) or 194 (ambulance). Always carry the phone number and the address of your embassy with you. In case of injury or illness, the place to go is the Urgentni Centar (Emergency center), Pasterova 2 of the Clinical Center of Serbia. Be aware that not all medical facilities have English-speaking staff or other foreign languages. 

Pharmacies on duty 24/7:
* '''Prvi maj''', Kralja Milana 9, +381-11/3344-923
* '''Sveti Sava''', Nemanjina 2, +381-11/2643-170
* '''Zemun''', Glavna 34, +381-11/2618-582

===LGBT===
LGBT travelers are advised to be discreet outside of the city center and late at night if around large groups of men. Some neighborhoods are known for being more open than others, Vračar and Karaburma are becoming the neighborhoods a lot of LGBT people choose to reside in for practical reasons. For all that, Karaburma is one of the rare neighborhoods outside of the city center that is becoming low-key pretty gay-friendly despite having 0 LGBT events, bars, or labeling as LGBT-friendly whatsoever. Public displays of affection between two people of the same sex are likely to be met with odd looks in most areas and, in some cases, verbal violence. Although rare, physical violence may occur outside of the city center or when encountering hooligans or intoxicated groups of people.

There are several gay bars and clubs all around the city, and they tend to get quite full: Musk Machine, XL, Guvernanta, Šupa, 54Bar (formerly Smiley), Mystic, as well as non-labeled yet friendly cafes like Meduza, Zappa Baza, Zappa Barka, Pop Quart, Zaokret, and Zgazeni Golub (and most of the places in the alternative district in the Cetinjska parking lot just behind the famous Skadarlija). Other venues include a gay sauna called RedLine Sauna. 

There are several LGBT parties organized periodically by various organizations at different locations, such as WB parties, Thank you next parties, Drag shows, and various others. Electronic music parties are known for being inclusive. Antibo (Antiboemska veselja) parties with an odd concept combining rave setting and turbo folk music are known to be inclusive yet not labeled as LGBT or LGBT friendly. Although known to expose some nationalistic symbols on LED screens during some songs in the line-up, the party concept attracts a lot of LGBT people, making it one of the rare events where same-sex PDA is not rare to see and the party is known to be a safe space. These parties are organized occasionally and in different locations, in most cases Club Drugstore. For those interested in "hard-core" turbo folk and Serbian pop-folk with occasional world music stages occurring at some events, Antibo is definitely the party they need to experience. Information about these parties can be found on their Instagram page. Some similar concepts can be found around the city, like Turbo-Tigar parties and Dragi Bravo, but those don't have a reputation for being safe spaces for LGBT people so far, despite being super popular among them as well. Avoid football fan crowds at all costs if you think you may be a target because of your appearance since they tend to be extremely violent and homophobic. For most places to go out to, using Google Maps can be practical enough since most of the places are within a 2km radius of the city center.

Belgraders, and especially LGBT people from Belgrade, are welcoming. Dating apps such as Grindr, Tinder, and Romeo are frequently used, so these apps can help you in meeting new people and getting information about events, and places to go. 

It is important to know that the Serbian Orthodox church is known to have a very hard homophobic stance. Keep in mind that even though many Serbs take pride in their church, it is not safe for LGBT+ people to join their meetings. Avoid such gatherings at all costs for your protection. If you have any self-consciousness or believe that someone could tell from the way you look that you are LGBT+, rethink visiting any of the churches even if it's a landmark. This is a friendly warning as your safety should be your number one priority.

In case of being abused or attacked, report it to the police immediately. Most ERs have a police officer next to the ambulances 24/7 so don't hesitate to get in touch with them. But keep in mind that although they react properly in most cases, they tend to be pretty indifferent to violence against LGBT+.

== Contact ==
The international telephone code for Serbia is 381. Most cities in Serbia and mobile operators have a 2-digit area code. There is only one area code for Belgrade and that is 11. Typical landline phone number in Belgrade +381-11/xxx-xxxx. The typical mobile phone number is +381-6x/xxx-xxxx. From the Serbian landline phone, use the 00 prefix for international calls (e.g. 0031-20/xxx-xxxx for Amsterdam, Netherlands), and the prefix 0 for calls inside Serbia but outside your area (e.g. 021/xxx-xxxx for Novi Sad, Serbia or 06x/xxx-xxxx for Serbian mobile). If you dial inside the same area, there is no need to use the prefix (just dial xxx-xxxx).

Basically, the whole city is covered by the mobile networks of all three Serbian operators. It is easy to buy and charge cheap pre-paid numbers at the kiosks around the city. If you use a 064 pre-paid number, use *100# to check the credit, for 063, use *121#, for 061, use *123#.

There are a number of red-colored payphones across the city, operated by telephone cards available at the kiosks.

Free wireless access is available at the Student Park in Belgrade Center. Mobile operators offer pre- and post-paid wireless Internet packages.

=== Local Media ===
Belgrade's most popular '''radio''' station, Radio S (94.9), features music from the former Yugoslav countries, while Index (88.9), Antena Beograd (107.9), Gradski (102.2), B92 (92.5), and Studio B (105.4) play mostly English-language pop/rock music. Radio S, Radio Index, and B92 cover all of Serbia and offer occasional traffic reports.

'''Television''' is exclusively in Serbian, but foreign films and series are broadcast with original audio and Serbian subtitles. Some hotels offer channels from other European countries.

Belgrade Insight [http://belgradeinsight.com/] is the only English-language local '''newspaper'''.

==Stay healthy==
The '''Košava''', a notorious Belgrade wind, can be quite chilling, particularly in winter - take care and dress appropriately.

Also be mindful of the high number of stray animals roaming streets, particularly dogs, even in the city center. Whilst it is very rare that they demonstrate outward signs of illness or aggression, err on the side of caution and avoid coming in physical contact.

Pharmacies – called 'apoteka' – are found throughout the city center. Look for lit green crosses on building façades. Some, such as the one in Kralja Milana Str, are open twenty-four hours. These will carry a range of prescription medicines, as well as over-the-counter products like painkillers and vitamin supplements.

==Cope==
Smoking in public places is no longer as rampant as it used to be. The ban that covers workplaces, shopping malls, and public transport is now generally enforced, though it doesn't apply to most restaurants, bars, and clubs.

===Embassies===
In Belgrade there are over 80 embassies. Here is some of them:
