Though physically part of the [[Rocky Mountains (United States of America)|Rocky Mountains]] region, culturally Missoula identifies closely with the [[Pacific Northwest (United States of America)|Pacific Northwest]]. Home to the University of Montana [http://umt.edu/] and often considered by residents as the most liberal city in Montana, it's an interesting mix of ranchers, cowboys, hippies, yuppies, students, artists, athletes and recreationalists. Graduates from the University of Montana frequently remain in Missoula, creating a large over-qualified work force. A local barista or cook may have, at the very least, a Bachelors degree. Tip well; they have loans to pay off!

==Get in==
===By plane===
The easiest way to Missoula is by air. Major hubs that service Missoula's International Airport ({{IATA|MSO}}) include [[Salt Lake City]], [[Denver]], [[Minneapolis]], [[San Francisco]], [[Chicago]] and [[Seattle]].

===By car===
Missoula can be reached by car via US Interstate 90, or US Highway 93, which runs north - south from the Idaho border at Lost Trail Pass all the way to Alberta, Canada. US Highway 12, which follows the Lewis and Clark trail on the west to and from Idaho, provides access to unspoiled wilderness areas and great scenery.

Be advised that road conditions in Montana can be very hazardous in the winter, and if you are not accustomed to driving winding mountain roads or in extreme snow/ice/sleet/hail/rain conditions, you should exercise extra caution.

===By bus===
Missoula has service operated by [https://www.jeffersonlines.com/plan-your-trip/route-maps/ Jefferson Lines] to [[Spokane]] and [[Butte]] where connections are available to other routes.

==Get around==
Visitors to Missoula often remark that the city is hard to get around in by car, a fact Missoulians famously owe to conflicting city engineers at the turn of the century. The confusing roadways make the city bus system a great way to get around for only a dollar[http://www.mountainline.com], but with a little orienting, the city can be much more easily navigated.

*'''Higgins Avenue''' runs from downtown in the northern end of town through the outskirts of the tree-lined streets of the university district until it takes a sharp curve to the west in the south end of town, leading mainly to residential areas.

*'''Broadway Street''' runs east to west, mostly along the Clark Fork river, from Van Buren, entrance to the Rattlesnake Recreation Area and the hippest place to live in town, through downtown before bisecting with Highway 93 and continuing on to the airport and I-90.

*'''Orange Street''' runs through downtown and another treed residential area before intersecting with Brooks Street.

*'''Brooks Street''' begins as Highway 93 from Lolo to the south of Missoula before turning into Brooks Street, a major shopping area populated with strip malls, fast food restaurants and the like, before dead ending into Higgins in a particularly confusing no-right-turn intersection.

*'''Russell Street''' runs north - south from Broadway to 39th, through residential, industrial and business districts, but is a main roadway for motorists.

*'''Reserve Street''' runs from I-90 to 39th from the north - south, crossing Broadway, 3rd Street, South Avenue and Brooks Street before dead ending. Major box stores, such as Target and Wal-Mart, as well as movie theaters, restaurants and other businesses line the thoroughfare.

==See==

Geographically, Missoula is dominated by the scenic Clark Fork river that flows through downtown and the mountains ringing the city.  The Kim Williams Trail, which follows the waterfront, is an easy way to appreciate the former.  Tubing, rafting, and canoe/kayaking are also good options in the summer.  

Mt. Sentinel, on the east side of town, offers a scenic trail system.  A trail starting at the University of Montana leads 700 feet up the mountainside to the “M,” which offers great views of the city.  More adventurous hikers may continue another 1400 feet to the peak of Mount Sentinel, which offers great views of the city, the Rattlesnake Wilderness to the north, and Mount Jumbo to the north.  Those with binoculars may perceive the ancient shoreline of Lake Missoula on Mount Jumbo, marking the edge of an enormous ice-age lake. One can also take the trail off the backside of Mt. Sentinel, which zig-zags down crossing the parasailing jeep road a few times to a sign which shows the lovely trail down thru forest on Sentinel's north side that ends at the old railroad tracks, now the Kim Williams hike/bike trail, and then back to the parking lot at the "M" trails base. Doing the loop in reverse is also very pleasant.

Manmade scenic attractions include the Missoula carousel in Caras Park, the historic courthouse, a fine old train station (closed to the public) and several fine art galleries.  The Missoula Art Museum is also worth a visit.  Knowing that it could never outbid its big-city counterparts for works by famous artists, the museum has instead hosts regularly-rotated exhibits of Western art and works closely with community arts groups.  Furthermore, the price is right for visitors, as demonstrated by its slogan: ''Free Expression, Free Admission''.

Lastly, if you enjoy history both of Missoula's historic railroad stations still stand, preserved, and in use.  One, built by the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Railroad [http://www.american-rails.com/milwaukee-road.html] is currently used by the Boone & Crockett Club and the other built by the Northern Pacific Railway [http://www.american-rails.com/northern-pacific-railway.html] is used as office space by local businesses and home of the Missoula Farmer's Market during the summer months.

==Do==

Missoulians enjoy a range of outdoor activities including hiking, rafting, "tubing", rock climbing, skiing, fishing, golfing, and just about any other activity that can be done outside.  It's no wonder—in Missoula you can take a city bus to within walking distance of federally designated wilderness area.  After hiking and returning to town, you can visit the historic downtown and enjoy some fantastic local food and drink.


There are a number of summer cultural events worth noting: the International Choral Festival the River Roots Music Festival, Farmer's markets (three) every Saturday morning.  Music and food festivals at Caras Park (off Higgins on the banks of the Clark Fork) Wednesday lunches and Thursday evenings and the Western Montana Fair in August. 

Snowbowl, at 7,600 feet, is a great place to ski that is very affordable.

Year-round 'First Friday' finds art galleries open to strolling passersby with music and food offered for free.

The public library on Main Street has special talks and presentations, about Montanan history, for example. There is also a movie 'Cheap date' night with popcorn and a drop-in Scrabble Club Monday evenings.

==Stay safe==

==Get Out==

Missoula's immediate surroundings offer a wide array of activities for all seasons, including the outdoor recreation afforded by vast tracts of public lands, the Old West flavor of several nearby ghost towns, several ski slopes, and a range of unique Montana businesses.

===Hamilton, Montana===
An hour south of Missoula on US-93, the small town of Hamilton offers several worthwhile attractions and proximity to the spectacular Bitterroot Mountains.
*'''Hidden Legend Winery''' [http://hiddenlegendwinery.com/], just to the north of Hamilton on US-93, offers tastings of several varieties of mead (honey wine).  The winery also produces dandelion wine.
*'''Bitterroot Brewery''' [http://www.bitterrootbrewing.com/] in Hamilton serves about six of its microbrews on any given date.  Their taproom and restaurant also occasionally hosts live music.
*The '''Daly Mansion''' [http://www.dalymansion.org/] preserves the summer home of mining magnate Marcus Daly, one of Montana's founding fathers.

===Hot Springs===
*About 40 minutes' drive southwest of Missoula, the '''Lolo Hot Springs''' offer two pools fed by geothermal springs: an outdoor swimming pool and a hotter (110-116 degree) indoor soaking pool.  The springs are clothing-optional after 9 PM on Wednesday and Sunday nights. 
*More adventurous soakers may prefer to hike out to some natural hot springs just across the Idaho border (about an hour from Missoula).  Driving from Montana, the '''Jerry Johnson''' hot springs' trailhead will be the first.  The trailhead is clearly marked--watch for a suspension bridge crossing the river to your left.  The springs themselves are less than a mile hike in, and are large enough to accommodate a couple of dozen people.  These springs are also clothing optional.  If the springs are packed, as they often are, try hiking a quarter-mile further down the trail to two smaller hot springs.
*'''Weir Hot Spring''' is a smaller hot spring about five miles further down the road from Montana.  It is about a mile in on a narrow and hilly trail, which can be treacherously icy in the winter and spring.  Although the drive is longer and the hike harder, visitors to Weir are compensated by smaller crowds than at Jerry Johnson.  In addition, the Forest Service allows camping at Weir, unlike at Jerry Johnson.

===Skiing===
*The '''Montana Snowbowl''' [http://www.montanasnowbowl.com/], just north of Missoula, sports 950 lift-served acres.
Pattee Canyon has nordic ski trails groomed regularly when theres enough snow by the missoulanordic.org club, for skating and classic techniques with mostly easy flat terrain, though its often icey.
Lolo Pass, 45 miles southwest of Missoula, has good nordic Ski trails groomed saturday/sunday early mornings by the Clearwater National Forest contractor, which offer excellent classic and skating tracks. Theres also a warming hut and a staffed lodge at the pass.

===Public Lands===

===Other Sites===
*'''Garnet Ghost Town''' [http://www.garnetghosttown.org/], about an hour's drive east on MT-200, is the closest significant ghost town to Missoula.  Maintained by the BLM in a state of suspended decay, the small mining camp of Garnet is an open-air museum of gold rush life on the frontier.  It is only accessible by car during the summer and early fall, but two cabins in the town are rented through the winter to adventurous skiers or snowmobilers.
*'''[[Glacier National Park]]''' is three hours' drive north on US-93.
