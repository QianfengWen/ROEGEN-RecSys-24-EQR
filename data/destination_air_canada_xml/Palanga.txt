'''Palanga'''[http://www.palanga.lt/] is a popular seaside resort at the Baltic sea in [[Lithuania]].

==Understand==
Not far there was discovered an encampment which indicates that the area was inhabited some 5,000 years ago. Between the 10th and 13th centuries, Palanga was one of the main settlements inhabited by the Curonians. It was situated on the trail of the ancient Amber Road, between Northern and Southern Europe, so at the same was an important center of trade and crafts. The name of Palanga was first mentioned in 1161 when King Valdemar I of Denmark disembarked there with his army and captured the castle of the Curonians.

Palanga is a resort town through which the stream Rąžė flows into the Baltic Sea. Rąžė was formerly known as Alanga and gave Palanga its name. 

The western edge of the city is washed by the Baltic Sea, there are many beaches here. The 200m stretch of coastline includes a beach, sand dunes, and strips of coastal pine forest. The two most famous dunes are Birutė and Naglis Hills. The sea and the beach here are two inseparable things for both locals and guests. But the locals are so attuned to the environment that they don't even notice it.

==Buy==
Items made from amber are one of the town's specialties, and range from inexpensive jewelry and small pictures with pieces of amber (or imitation amber) stuck on, up to very high-quality items. There are good opportunities to buy souvenirs on your way to the beach, where tents with souvenirs are set up.

==Eat==
At the beach, you can enjoy a cheap cheburek and cold beer (sold by young peddlers). A bit of a warning though, the chebureks are not made in a local restaurant, and are deemed "illegal" for unsanitary conditions in which they are thought to be made, but, I have tried many chebureks and I haven't had food poisoning (yet). So buy from the peddlers at your own discretion.
