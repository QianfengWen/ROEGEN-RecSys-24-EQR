'''Visby''' is one of the most remarkable towns in [[Sweden]] and [[Scandinavia]], and it is situated on the west coast of [[Gotland]] Island. The population is about 23,000. It is known for the medieval city ringwall, the Cathedral (Sankta Maria Kyrka), and many medieval church ruins.  

==Understand==
A former Viking site on the island of Gotland, Visby was the main centre of the Hanseatic League (German trading federation) in the Baltic from the 12th to the 14th century.  Its 13th-century ringwall and more than 200 warehouses and wealthy merchants' dwellings from the same period make it the best-preserved fortified commercial medieval city in northern Europe.  In 1995, the city was declared a [[UNESCO World Heritage]][http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/731] site.

During the Swedish summer Mid June - Mid August, Visby is crowded. It is one of the best party cities in Sweden in the summer. Many Visby residents leave during these hectic months and rent their apartments. During the rest of the year, it offers a peaceful experience with helpful and friendly locals and an abundance of restaurants with very high standards. The off-season is a great time to experience the heritage, architecture, museums and parks. Not to mention the surrounding nature reserves, the ocean and its beaches (August- september are still great for swimming in the ocean).

Destination Gotland [http://www.destinationgotland.se/] runs ferries from [[Nynäshamn]] and [[Oskarshamn]] to Visby. You can bring your car on the ferry.  The ferry takes approximately three hours and is the cheapest way to get to the island.

Cruise ships plying the Baltic Sea, from May to September, call on the port of Visby,  Small cruise ships dock at berth 7 at the port.  Large cruise ship hold position at anchor, and passengers are tendered past the breakwater to the port.  The port has only the most basic facilities; but shops and restaurants are in town, only about a 5-minute walk away.

==Get around==
[[Image:Visby ringmur vid Östergravar.jpg|thumb|East side of the Visby medieval ringwall]]
The inner city (Old Town), which is located within the medieval city walls, is small enough to be covered by foot. The rest of the city is easy to get around by bike and has plenty of good bikes paths. 

Tourist information[http://gotland.com/en/] may be obtained from the Donnerska huset, Donners plats 1, near Almedalen and the waterfront in Visby.

===By Foot===
Visby is best enjoyed by foot, especially the Old Town, located within the city wall.  Be aware that some of the streets (alleys) are quite narrow, cobblestone-paved, and somewhat hilly and thus can be difficult for people with mobility barriers.

===By Bicycle===
During the summer there are usually plenty of bike rentals, but they can be expensive, if you're staying for a longer period purchasing a used bike might be a cheaper option.

===By Bus===
There are several bus lines going out to the rest of the island, check the time table before heading out though.

===By Car===
During the summer cars are not allowed within the city walls, though parking outside the walls is free of charge.

===By Taxi===
Like the rest of Sweden, taxis can be expensive, and are best for short trips when you are unable to get around otherwise.
