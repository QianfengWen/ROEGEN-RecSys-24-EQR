'''Bucaramanga''' is a city in the [[Santander (Colombia)|Santander]] region of [[Colombia]].

==Understand==
Bucaramanga is a medium sized city, home to nearly 1 million inhabitants (in all of the metropolitan area).

It's not a huge touristic destination like [[Cartagena (Colombia)|Cartagena]] or [[Santa Marta]] but nonetheless it is surrounded by beautiful landscapes and ancient towns with a lot of history, which overall makes the visit to Bucaramanga worthwhile.

==Talk==
Most of the people in Bucaramanga speak Spanish only, and you will probably have a hard time trying to get addresses and other information from people on streets, but if you go to big hangout places like malls, parks or supermarkets, English speakers will certainly be found around.
