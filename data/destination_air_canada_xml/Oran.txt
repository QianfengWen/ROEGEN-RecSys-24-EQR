'''Oran''' is a city of 600,000+ people in [[Northwest Algeria]].

==Understand==
Oran's beautiful sea shore, constructed under French rule, was inspired by Nice's seafront. It consists of a long boulevard lined with cafés, restaurants, and ice cream shops. The boulevard also offers a splendid view of the sea, the harbour, Santa Cruz and the cliffs ("les Falaises"). It has been renamed "Boulevard de l'ALN" by the government after the independence but it is still called '''Front de Mer''' by the locals.

==See==
There is not much in the way of sights here, but the whole city in itself is one big sight. Take a walk in the city center area to take in a massive number of over a hundred years old French-built beautiful but crumbling apartment buildings. The atmosphere is unique! It's a trip back in time to southern France in the 1940s... Sooner or later you'll stumble on Place 1er Noviembre, the main square, and the cathedral Sacre Cœur that the Algerians turned into a library.  To the west of the city is the mountain called "The Sleeping Giant.  On its summit is a Crusader's Fort and a Mosque that also once was a Crusader's Church.  At its base is the Derbe Quartier, once the Jewish Quarter prior to 1967, it served the Russian navy for years with ladies of the night.  There was a hospital built inside the mountain and Soviet submarines used to surface inside of it.  Large steel doors can be seen around the mountain as you climb the road to the summit.  Gangs of youths used to be a problem there in the past but may not exist now.  It was the landing spot for the US army in WWII and the allied submarines used the caves that are inside the mountain and accessible under the sea.  The port used to be the focus of the Soviet Navy.  It was a critical strategic city for the Soviets as it is just across the Moroccan border from Tangiers the USA's Strategic Air Command "touch and go" point for the Mediterranean region.

==Do==
Oran's nightlife is among the most thriving in the continent. The city has always been the capital of Algeria's parties and music. All night long, plenty of nightclubs, bars and cabarets are opened and offer music, dance and partying in the city area seafront, called ''La Corncihe'' which runs from the city's ''Front de Mer'' to the neighbouring cities of Aïn El Turk, Bou Sfer and El Ançor. All kinds of nightclubs can be found, from the very posh '''Atmosphère''' at the Sheraton Hotel that attracts now international DJs such as David Vendetta to more popular ones in the Corniche. ''Les Pins d'Or'', ''SunHouse'' and ''Le Murdjadjo'' among others.

==Stay safe==
During the day, safety is high. After dark, however, it is not as safe and hotels will encourage that you stay inside. Boulevard de la Soummam is a safe street due to the large number of restaurants. The city is close to empty after dark so no one is there to protect you. Even the tram stops already at 9:50 pm. Visitors are encouraged to stay in a populated shop, store, club or living space at night and avoid traveling by small streets if they must be out.

==Cope==
Changing money at a bank gives you a bad rate (approx. 127 DA for 1€ / Dec 2017). Instead, ask at a tobacconist's and they'll help you change money on the black market (approx. 198–204 DA for 1€; Dec 2017). Technically, this is illegal but the police turn a blind eye. Make sure to count your money but do not be paranoid. Algerians are a lot more honest than their neighbours. 

Past rates bank/black market, €1 equals:
Dec 2013  103 DA / 140 DA
May 2014 107 DA / 150 DA
Dec 2017 127 DA / 200 DA
