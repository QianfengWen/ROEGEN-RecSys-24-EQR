'''Huizhou''' is a city in [[Guangdong]].

==Understand== 
The sight of Huizhou to the average traveller invariably arouses surprise. Some 40 miles north of Shenzhen, in verdant, tropical countryside, a common reaction is "Where did this place come from?" Until comparatively recently (the 1980's) Huizhou was a sleepy Guangdong town on the Pearl River Delta. It has since exploded with industry, attracting investment from Japanese, Korean, European and American companies. It is one of the most architecturally pleasing small cities in all of Guangdong, and one of the very richest. CIA reports citing it as the de-facto HQ for all organized crime in Hong Kong and Guangdong may go some way to explaining the many sumptuous housing developments here, as well as the plethora of Porsches, five-star hotels and other indicators of high-end living. Huizhou is where the Triad crime bosses come to dialogue and chill. Something of an anomaly within mainland China, this is a city that answers to no-one and those who live here have definite reasons for doing so.

Huizhou is well served by highways linking it with [[Guangzhou]], [[Shenzhen]] and [[Hong Kong]]. Shenzhen and the outskirts of Hong Kong are just a 90-minute bus ride away. The city has its own railway station linking it with many cities around China. There are plans afoot to link Huizhou by high-speed underground train with Shenzhen, which will effectively provide the city with a rapid-transit link to downtown Hong Kong.

==Stay safe==


Huizhou is not plagued by the sorts of petty crime found in other Chinese cities. This is a privileged enclave and its rich are well protected. Migrant pickpockets tend to hang around the central bus station, but this place is so heavily policed that their efforts seem pointless. Huizhou is also a seat of regional government, so the zero tolerance for street crime policy in more intense here. In addition, it hosts large Japanese, Korean and western expatriate communities, so there is strong government incentive to keep a lid on antics by vagabonds from surrounding areas. When the powers that be in Huizhou tell you that they will stop at nothing to keep their elite city safe, they really, really, REALLY mean it. Violent attacks against foreigners are unheard of.
