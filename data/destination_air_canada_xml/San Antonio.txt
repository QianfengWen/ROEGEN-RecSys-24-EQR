'''San Antonio''' is the second largest city in Texas and 7th largest in the [[United States]]. It's the 24th largest metropolitan area in the country. Visited by more than 34 million annual visitors, it is a beautiful city on the axis of three different geological terrains: [[Hill Country]], [[South Texas Plains]] and Prairie and Lakes. San Antonio is home to one of the largest Latino populations, with significant African-American populations. There's a lot to do in this city: fine art museums, historical missions, and plenty of amusement parks in addition to great dining and lots of drinking. The culture and people are vibrant and interesting. Its downtown is one of the most lively in the state.

San Antonio is considered to be the cradle of Texan liberty. Its most well-known landmark is the Alamo, the site of the famous battle (1836) where Davy Crockett and Jim Bowie were killed. It must be said that when most visitors see the Alamo for the first time, their common reaction is "Hm, I thought it would be bigger."

San Antonio is a Texas city that reflects the state's Spanish and Mexican heritage. Hispanics make up a considerable fraction of the population, and it shows in most places. The Hispanic atmosphere of San Antonio makes it a truly unique U.S. city. This becomes most evident during Fiesta Week, a yearly celebration that attracts 3.5 million people to its 110-plus events from all over to enjoy parades, music, festivals, fairs, and food and drink in the charming downtown streets of the city. San Antonio also has a smaller African-American population.

San Antonio, with a population of around 1.5 million, and a metro population of nearly 2.5 million, still enjoys a small-town feel despite the hustle and bustle. Its people are friendly, open, and multi-cultural, and the concentration of population around its center makes it easy to get just about anywhere within a 30-40 minute drive.

===Visitor Centers===
* '''San Antonio Visitor Information Center''', 317 Alamo Plaza, 800-447-3372 [http://www.sanantoniocvb.com]. For visitors coming to San Antonio, a good starting place to see is the downtown Visitor Information Center and Official City Store right across the street from the Alamo. It is a wealth of information about San Antonio. Representatives there can assist you in getting a map of the city, help you get around, or anything else you may need in San Antonio. In the Summer of 2009, the San Antonio Convention & Visitor's Bureau launched a savings website, the San Antonio Vacation Experience [http://save.visitsanantonio.com], for families and groups traveling to the city.

==Get in==
===By plane===
* '''San Antonio International Airport''' ({{IATA|SAT}}) [https://www.flysanantonio.com/]. Serves over 30 national and international destinations with non-stop service and many more with one-stop direct service. For destinations, check with individual airlines. San Antonio International Airport has recently completed construction of Terminal B and remodeling of Terminal A. Terminal C construction has been postponed.

The airport has information counters manned by '''Airport Ambassadors''' (volunteers dressed in denim vests and cowboy hats) who provide assistance in many ways at no charge and with no tipping accepted. Passengers should go to them if they have any problems if they need directions, or if they need honest and truthful information about transportation options, the airport, or the city.

For transportation from the airport, there are several options. Ambassadors can provide the details according to each destination, but arriving passengers should keep the following guidelines in mind:

*Only airport-area hotels have free shuttles. They come to the airport only after you call them for a pickup. Ambassadors have the phone numbers for these hotels. Downtown hotels may state that shuttle service is available, but they do not have their own shuttles; they are referring to the private services available at the airport.

*VIA Metropolitan Transit [https://www.viainfo.net] operates Bus Line 5 which runs from the center island at the far end of Terminal B to the downtown area (via North Star Mall and along McCullough and St. Marys Streets). This is the cheapest way to get anywhere in the city from the airport.  It costs only $1.30 (exact change) per adult passenger and runs every 30 minutes during the daytime with a change to once every hour in the evenings (generally just before shopping malls close). Service starts around 5:00 a.m. and continues until approximately 10:00 p.m. Many hotels downtown are within 2-3 blocks of the bus line. It takes 35 minutes for the bus to get downtown--about 15 minutes longer than a taxi. The route map and schedules are available at the Ambassador Information Booths in both terminals or online. Please note that buses on Line 5 change their number to Line 30 downtown, but they continue as if it were one bus line with only the one ticket purchased at the airport needed to go all the way to the end of Line 30. A person going anywhere else in the city on the bus must purchase 1-2 transfers (as will be needed and when entering the first bus) at 15 cents each and change buses either at the North Star Mall Terminal, downtown, or where any bus line they need crosses Line 5's route. However, a trip can be time-consuming if a transfer is required.
 
* Taxis are the cheapest option for service for 2 or more passengers going anywhere in the city if not taking the public bus because they are priced by the carload rather than per person. Taxis are monitored by the city and the metered rate for downtown is in the range of $27-29. The taxi ranks (at both terminals) are manned by personnel who can call a larger taxi to the front of the line for groups of up to 6 people with luggage. Even for one person going from the airport to anywhere other than downtown, the taxi is generally the cheapest option for door-to-door service.

* Rideshare is provided by Uber, Lyft, and Get Me from the airport. Persons wanting to use any of these companies must have an app for the company on their telephone and contact the company via that app. Prices vary by company, and the companies may have varying prices according to the time of day or the amount of demand at the time when they are contacted. In general, the prices that the rideshare companies have been charging to go downtown have been at least $7-10 cheaper than the taxi rates. The pick-up points for rideshare companies after contacting them with your phone are at curbside at the end of Terminal B at the columns with signs indicating they are pick-up points B20, B21, B22, and B23 with seating provided between B21 and B22.

===By train===
* '''Amtrak''', ''SAS'', 350 Hoefgen St. The Texas Eagle provides service north to Chicago; the Sunset Limited train runs west to Los Angeles and east to New Orleans. Before Hurricane Katrina, Sunset Limited was a transcontinental route with service to Orlando; currently, the route is truncated.

===By boat===
San Antonio is in the middle of Texas. Therefore, it is not accessible by boat, except for those willing to row upstream from the Gulf of Mexico, a journey of about 250 miles. Although there are many tubing opportunities around San Antonio, thanks to the huge abundance of rivers in the area.

==Get around==
[[Image:Downtown_San_Antonio.png|Map of Downtown San Antonio|thumb|right]]
===By Car===
If you're staying in central San Antonio you can get by without a car if you're confining your activity to the amusements of the central city. However, outside of the downtown area, having your own car is useful for exploring San Antonio as the public transit network tends to be very spotty elsewhere. It is particularly useful if you are also intent on exploring some of the other attractions such as San Antonio Missions National Historic Park, Six Flags, Sea World, or the surrounding Texas Hill Country. San Antonio has a very well-developed freeway system which means it has less traffic congestion compared with say Houston, Dallas, or Austin.

For those of you unfamiliar with the proper treatment of flooded areas, NEVER drive through flooded low-water crossings. You will lose your car and possibly your life. As little as a few inches of running water can and does wash a car away and each year there are some deaths due to this. "Turn Around, Don't Drown."

===By public transit===
San Antonio's bus system is known as the VIA Metropolitan Transit. It also runs the downtown trolly service (actually a bus) for a small fare. Bus fares range from about $1.20 to $2.50 depending on the service with a one day $4 pass. A monthly big pass includes unlimited rides on all regular, express and streetcar service throughout the month that is indicated on the pass, for $35.00. Students can also retain a semester pass for $35.00. For more information visit the www.viainfo.net. There are 4 different types of routes: Express, Skip, Frequent, and Metro. The Express routes usually run from the sub-urban areas (mostly Park and Rides) to downtown.Most of them run about once every 30 minutes. Skip service usually runs along the streets with high traffic, they are called Skip routes because they usually Skip bus stops that are serviced by the frequent routes. Skip routes also usually run about every 30 minutes. Frequent routes can also be found on high traffic roads and as the name implies, the stops are very frequent. Although Frequent routes come by about once every 15 minutes, it is usually faster to wait a little longer and take the skip routes if you are going a long distance,for example on San Pedro ave, it is usually quicker to wait for the #3(Skip) as opposed to the #4 (Frequent) if you wanted to get from downtown to North Star Mall. Metro service is usually found in neighborhoods around the city, frequency varies with each route, but they usually run about once an hour. Discount fares are available to children between the ages of 5 and 11, senior citizens 62 and older, Medicare recipients, persons with disabilities and students. A reduced fee ID is required for reduced fares and can be acquired from VIA Information Centers (students may get the necessary forms from their campus administration). Bus schedules and route information can be found at VIA's website [http://www.viainfo.net], by calling the VIA information line 210 362-2020 or for the hearing impaired at 210 362-2019, or at the San Antonio Visitor Information Center. The website also permits the use of the Personal Trip Planner that provides the option to enter a origin and end destination to receive the scheduled bus routes to the destination. 

A bus line of interest to the visitor is line #7 SIGHTSEER SPECIAL, which runs hourly daily ($1.20 one way) and links the various museums and attractions north of downtown (e.g., Botanical Garden, Witte Museum, San Antonio Zoo, San Antonio Museum of Art) with Downtown. There are also three (Red, Yellow, Blue) downtown Streetcar lines [http://www.viainfo.net/BusService/Streetcar.aspx], which run about every 10 minutes ($1 one way) from Alamo Plaza to the Market Square area, Alamodome, HemisFair Park, and the King William Historic area.

Rides of less than 30 minutes incur no fee, while there is a small fee for longer rides. In addition there are day passes which allow people to rent a bike for the entire day for only $10.

==Stay safe==
Certain areas of the United States, including the southern regions and rural areas of the Midwest, typically carry more socially conservative views. While the LGBT community is gaining more widespread acceptance, travelers are advised to avoid public displays of affection

The homeless population mostly will only ask for money before moving on to the next person, though it’s important to exercise caution in the event they become a threat. They are mostly in cattleman's square historical district, predominantly underneath and around the Buena Vista St Bridge. 

Other areas of the city are predominantly safe if traveling by car. It should be noted that residents of Texas are allowed to carry firearms openly and concealed without a permit, however restrictions still apply to Government buildings, National Parks, banks, and bars.

==Get out==

To leave San Antonio, use US 281 south to get to Brownsville, I-10 east to get to Houston, I-10 west to get to El Paso, I-35 north to get to Austin, Waco, and Dallas/Fort Worth, I-37/US 181 south to get to Corpus Christi and Floresville, SH 16 north to get to Bandera, SH 16 south to get to Poteet, or US 281 north to get to Blanco and Johnson City. An alternate route to Austin is to either use US 281 north and US 290 east, or take I-10 east and use SH 130 north (however this is a toll road). I-410 and SH 151 do not leave the city. However, Loop 1604 does go to small towns in the county.

San Antonio is a great place to start a day trip to '''[[New Braunfels]],''' best known for its German culture and heritage, not to mention '''Schlitterbahn''' [https://www.schlitterbahn.com/new-braunfels], persistent in being voted the world's best water park; or to '''[[San Marcos (Texas)|San Marcos]]''', home of Texas State University and its Aquarena Center.
