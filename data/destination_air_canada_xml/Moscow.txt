'''Moscow''' [https://www.mos.ru/en] ([[Russian phrasebook|Russian]]: ''Москва'') is the largest city and capital of [[Russia]]. An iconic, global city, and as the largest European metropolis, Moscow has played a central role in the development of Russia and the world. For many, the sight of the Kremlin complex in the centre of the city is still loaded with symbolism and history. Moscow was the capital of the former [[Soviet Union]] and signs of its previous life are still very visible. Yet, there is more to Russia and its capital than just memories of the USSR. Architectural gems from the time of the Russian Empire are still dotted throughout Moscow, whilst signs of modern Tsars (or at least people with similar levels of wealth) abound. During the recent years the city underwent major renovations and now it is one of the most modern European cities.

==Understand== 
Moscow is the financial and political center of Russia and the countries formerly comprising the Soviet Union. It has a population of around 13 million and an area of 2,511km², after an expansion in 2012. One-tenth of all Russian citizens live in the Moscow metropolitan area. Moscow is the most populous city in Europe. Moscow is in the UTC+3 time zone; there is no daylight saving time.

The Moskva River bends its way through the city with most of the sites of tourist interest on the northern bank of the river. The other major waterway is the Yauza River, which flows into the Moskva east of the Kremlin. 

Much of Moscow's geography is defined by the 3 'Ring Roads' that circle the city at various distances from the center, roughly following the outline of the walls that used to surround Moscow. With Red Square and the Kremlin forming the very center, the innermost ring road is the Boulevard Ring (''Bulvarnoye Koltso''), built in the 1820s where the 16th-century walls used to be. It runs from the Christ the Saviour Cathedral in southwest central Moscow, to the mouth of the Yauza in southeast central Moscow.

The next ring road, the Garden Ring (''Sadovoe Koltso''), derives its name from the fact that landowners near the road in Tsarist times were obligated to maintain gardens to make the road attractive. In Soviet times, the road was widened, and there are now no gardens there.

The Third Ring Road, completed in 2004, is not much use for tourists but is a heavily used motorway which absorbs a bit of Moscow's traffic. It roughly follows the outline of ''Kamer-Kollezhsky val'', the customs and passport boundary of Moscow between 1742 and 1852. The outer edge of Moscow is largely defined by the Moscow Ring Road (widely known by its abbreviation: MKAD-Moskovskaya koltsevaya Automobil Naya Dorota), a motorway which is 108km long and encircles the entire city (similar to London's M25 and Paris' ''Périphérique'').

}}

Moscow has a humid continental climate with freezing winters and warm summers, with rainfall evenly distributed throughout the year, measuring 707mm on average. Winters are cold with the average February temperature being -6.7°C (19.9°F) with low temperatures around -10°C (14°F) and highs around -4°C (24°F). Lows do occasionally reach -20°C (-4°F) and during cold waves from Siberia it can plunge to -30°C (-22°F). On the other hand, when the wind blows from the west, high temperatures may rise above freezing and they can reach 5°C (41°F), allowing rain to fall 3.5 days each winter, on average. 
Although snow coverage usually forms by the beginning of November and melts by the end of March or early April, significant alternations may happen depending on the year. Freezing conditions usually continue to persist in March and sometimes last until mid-April. The last snowfall is around 15th April. In May the Russian capital is reached by the first gusts of warm weather and temperatures cease to fall below freezing. However sudden snowfalls are still possible, with the last one being on 7th May 2014 which lasted for about an hour. Summers are warm with an average July temperature 19.2°C, with highs around 25°C (77°F) and lows around 15°C (59°F). The area is affected by heat waves and this may cause high temperatures to rise above 30°C (86°F), but these periods are usually short. Nights with below 10°C (50°F) lows may also occur. Autumn is characterized by rapidly falling temperatures and the first snowfall is around 25th October.

===By plane=== 
Moscow ({{IATA|MOW}}) has four airports:

===Sheremetyevo International Airport===
'''[http://www.svo.aero/en/ Sheremetyevo International Airport]''', ({{IATA|SVO}}), +7 495 232-6565, is 32km northwest of the centre of Moscow, in the city of [[Khimki]]. There are 6 terminals: A (business charter aviation), B (Aeroflot domestic flights), C (closed for renovations), D, E, and F. Terminals D, E, and F are south of the runway and are connected to each other by walkway. Most Aeroflot international flights operate to/from Terminal D. Sheremetyevo International Airport serves approximately 33 million passengers per year.

The airport has plenty of ATMs and currency exchange offices, duty free shops, a hairdresser, a pharmacy, and several overpriced cafes and basic restaurants. Unlimited [http://www.svo.aero/en/wifi/ free WiFi] is available. There is also a hotel on the 5th floor of the AeroExpress terminal.  

If you have a layover at Sheremetyevo Airport, you may stay at the [http://www.novotel.com/gb/hotel-1349-novotel-moscow-sheremetyevo-airport/index.shtml Hotel Novotel Moscow Sheremetyevo Airport] even if you do not have a Russian visa. Go to the 'Transfer/Transit Without Visa' desk upon arrival. You'll be escorted to the hotel in a private bus and stay in a corridor with personal security guard. Rooms are spacious and comfortable. You'll be picked up by Aeroflot staff about one hour prior to departure and the bus will bring you directly to the departure gate. The hotel offers rates for stays during the day as well as overnight rates.

To travel between the airport and the city:
* '''[https://www.aeroexpress.ru/en/sheremetyevo.html Aeroexpress]''' is the only rail link to the airport. Trains operate between the airport and the [http://belorussky.dzvr.ru/en/ Belorussky Railway Terminal] in the northwest section of the city centre. Trains depart every 30 or 60 minutes from 5:00AM to 12:30AM. The journey takes 35 minutes and costs RUB500 one-way if you buy your ticket at the airport or RUB450 if you buy your ticket in advance (4 to 90 days) online or via mobile app (November 2018). The intermediary stop at the Okruzhnaya station allows quite an easy transfer to the circular commuter train line (''Em-Tse-Ka'', see more details in the Get Around section below). Keep your paper or mobile ticket for the entire Aeroexpress journey. From the Belorussky Railway Terminal, the journey to the city center takes an additional 20 minutes by metro.

* '''Bus #851''' (RUB55 for a 90 minute transfer ticket purchased from the driver) and '''Bus #949''' (RUB75) operate service between the terminals and the Rechnoy Vokzal Metro Station, at the northwest terminus of Metro Line 2 (dark green). In the terminal D the ticket machine that accepts credit cards too, is located right at the bus stop. If taking the regular bus, the driver hands you a red card, which you scan in order to get past the metal turning gate. The majority of drivers don't speak any English, so don't depend on them for assistance. Once you get off the bus, continue by foot a few steps in the direction the bus was going in, and you'll see the metro station on your right in the first opening between the buildings. When returning to the airport, after leaving the Rechnoy Vokzal metro station, cross the street, go around the fence on the other side of the street and look for the bus under the orange-colored shopping center.

* '''Bus #817''' (RUB55 for a 90 minute transfer ticket purchased from the driver) or '''Bus #948''' (RUB75) operate service between the terminals and the Planernaya Metro Station, at the northwest terminus of Metro Line 7 (purple).

Buses operate from approximately 5:30AM to 00:45AM.

* '''Night Bus H1''' operates every 30 minutes after the other buses have stopped. The bus operates between the airport and the Leninskiy Prospect Metro Station.

* '''[http://www.svo.aero/en/directions/ Fixed Price Official Taxis]''' are available, with the price based on the destination neighborhood. A fixed price official taxi costs RUB1,800 to the city centre. Note that there is a toll of RUB100 for taking the highway to/from Sheremetyevo Airport.

* '''Taxi apps''' are available, with the price based on the destination neighborhood. Prices on Uber are fixed at rates of RUB850-1,000, before surge pricing, depending on distance. Transfers to the other Moscow airports cost a fixed rate, before surge pricing, of RUB1,500.

* '''Driving''' past the toll bar should be avoided whenever possible as there are fees to do so. In addition to entry charge of RUB100/hour (rounded up to the next hour), after entering the toll bar, there is an extra charge from RUB100/hour to RUB300/hour, depending on the distance from the entrance and the comfort of parking—with an unofficial option of an unlimited-time stay for RUB300.

===By train===

Moscow is the largest Russian railway hub, with ten terminals and connections to all parts of [[Russia]] and far into [[Europe]] and [[Asia]]. Due to its hub status, Moscow's train stations are always crowded, and pickpocketing is an issue, however police patrols and CCTV cameras are abundant, and violent crime is unlikely. Train travel is the predominant mode of intercity transportation for the majority of Russians.

All long-distance trains are operated by [http://eng.rzd.ru/ Russian Railways] and its subsidiaries. Tickets can be bought either at stations or [http://pass.rzd.ru/main-pass/public/en online]. Some international train operators also serve Moscow. For domestic trains, you can show the ticket officer your online boarding pass; however, international trains require a printed ticket. There are often counters with English-speaking personnel at each station. Sometimes the English-speaking counters are marked, and sometimes you will be directed by the first person you speak to another counter with an English speaker.

====From Saint Petersburg====
[[Saint Petersburg]] can be reached in 4 hours via the high-speed ''Sapsan'' trains. There are 15 depatures daily from Saint Petersburg at 05:30, 06:40, 06:50, 09:00, 09:10, 11:00, 11:10, 13:00, 15:00, 15:10, 17:00, 17:10, 19:00, 19:10 and 21:00, with some trains stopping at [[Tver]], Vyshniy Volochek, Bologoe, and Okulovka. Fares vary and are cheaper if bought well in advance but usually are in the range of RUB2,300-6,000.

There are also about 15 overnight trains that travel between Moscow and Saint Petersburg. These overnight trains are generally cheaper than the Sapsan, including a couple of modern and well-equipped two-storey trains. The most famous is the luxurious ''Red Arrow'' (Красная стрела), a train painted in bright red that departs Saint Petersburg daily at 23:55 while the song ''Hymn to the Great City'' plays on its loudspeakers.

====From Europe====
The ''Paris-Moscow Express'' is a weekly train service that makes the 2-night 3,217km journey between Paris and Moscow. The train makes stops in [[Berlin]], [[Warsaw]], and [[Brest]]. The train includes 4-bed compartments (€245), 2-bed compartments (€345), and luxury compartments (€798).

The ''Strizh'' is an overnight train to [[Berlin]] (22 hours; from RUB11,000). It runs on Fri and Sun to Berlin, the return journeys are on Sat and Mon correspondingly. The train's main stops are [[Smolensk]], [[Minsk]], [[Brest (Belarus)]], [[Warszawa]], [[Poznan]], [[Frankfurt an der Oder]].


The ''Polonez'' is a daily direct overnight train to [[Warsaw]] (19 hours; from RUB9,000), via [[Belarus]]. The ''Tolstoy'' is a daily direct overnight train to [[Helsinki]] (13 hours), via [[Saint Petersburg]]. There are also weekly trains to [[Vienna]] and [[Prague]], via [[Belarus]] and a weekly train to [[Budapest]]. You will need a Belarussian visa to ride trains that go via [[Belarus]].

If you want to visit Moscow by train, you need to check out visa requirements for Belarus. The is no border between the countries, but you still need to follow the formalities. It is important to note that travel that originates or terminates in Belarus with the exception of air travel is prohibited to foreigners. Only Russian and Belarusian citizens are allowed to cross the Belarus-Russia land border with some exceptions. Rail travel that originates or terminates west of Belarus should be fine, but the rules are somewhat vague. During some large sporting events, the land border is open to foreigners.

====From Eastern Russia and Asia====
{{seealso|Trans-Siberian Railway}}

Tickets for the Trans-Siberian Railway sell out and it is best to buy tickets well in advance. Tickets are sold by the operator as well as via agencies and resellers.

The main line of the Trans-Siberian Railway runs between Moscow and [[Vladivostok]], the biggest Russian city on the Pacific Coast. The ''Rossiya'' train leaves Moscow every other day at 13:20, while the slower but cheaper trains #44 or #100 leave every day around midnight. Major stops include [[Yekaterinburg]] (24-31 hours; RUB2,000-9,000), [[Omsk]] (35-48 hours), [[Novosibirsk]] (46-54 hours), [[Krasnoyarsk]] (54-66 hours), [[Irkutsk]] (68-81 hours; RUB4,700-23,000), [[Ulan Ude]] (75-89 hours), and [[Vladivostok]] (7 days; RUB10,000-34,000).

The other routes of the Trans-Siberian Railway, between Moscow and China, are more popular among tourists. There are two weekly trains to/from [[Beijing]] (US$500-1,200), the ''Trans-Mongolian (Train #4)'' via [[Ulaanbaatar]] and the ''Trans-Manchurian (Vostok/Train #20)'' via [[Manchuria]]. Both journeys take six nights but the ride via [[Mongolia]] offers more scenery.

====Train stations in Moscow====

Moscow has 10 train stations, all of which are located near metro stations close to the center of Moscow. Be sure to note the station from which your train is departing, which will be indicated on the ticket, or [http://pass.rzd.ru/main-pass/public/en online]. Three stations (''Leningradsky'', ''Yaroslavsky'', and ''Kazansky'') are located on one huge Komsomolskaya square, informally known as the "Three Stations' Square". A running joke among Moscow taxi drivers ever since the Soviet times was to be able to pick up a fare from one of them to the other, taking the unwary tourist on an elaborate ride in circles, but it is almost impossible in the 2020s when map and taxi mobile apps are available. Be prepared for enormous queues trying to enter or exit the Metro at peak times, as people are getting off or on the commuter trains.

===By car=== 
Some entry points to Moscow over the Ring Road and into the city feature rotating roadblocks, where from time to time teams of traffic police may stop a vehicle, especially if it is not featuring Moscow plates. You may be stopped and questioned but you'll be allowed to proceed if you have all the proper documents.

====From Europe====
Foreign cars, especially expensive cars, might attract unwelcome attention, and there is cumbersome paperwork involved to enter Russia by car.

The direct way to drive from [[Germany]], [[Poland]], or [[Belarus]] is along the E30 road, although it requires having permission to enter Belarus. If you can't enter Belarus, an alternative is to go via Latvia using the E22 from [[Riga]].

The E18 provides easy access from [[Finland]] through [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Novgorod]]. This route is also known as Russian Federal Highway M-10. Traffic on the M-10 is heavy.

===By bus=== 
It is generally easier to travel to/from Europe or other parts of Russia via plane or train so most visitors to Moscow will not use the intercity buses.

'''[http://www.luxexpress.eu/en Lux Express]''' operates coach service between Moscow and various cities in [[Europe]]. Buses arrive to and depart from the Stantsiya Tushinskaya Bus Station next to the Tushinskaya Metro Station on Metro Line 7 (purple) in the northeastern section of Moscow. Destinations include [[Tartu]] (14 hours, €49), [[Riga]] (15 hours, €55), [[Tallinn]] (16.5 hours, €55), [[Vilnius]] (18 hours, €66-73), [[Warsaw]] (26 hours, €80-92), [[Minsk]] (34 hours, €78), [[Budapest]] (36 hours, €95-112), [[Prague]] (36 hours, €97), and [[Berlin]] (40 hours, €97-109).

Many domestic intercity buses stop at the [http://www.mosoblvokzaly.ru/ Moscow Intercity Bus Terminal], next to the Shchelkovskaya Metro Station at the eastern terminus of Metro Line 3 (dark blue). Buses to the popular tourist destination of [[Suzdal]] operate from this station.

There are also several small bus stops and stations with buses to/from small towns that are not commonly visited by tourists.

===By boat===
There is no scheduled passenger service to Moscow by boat; however, cruise ships do provide service to the Northern River Terminal, on the Moscow Canal near the Khimki Reservoir. The pier is not convenient to the city and it can take over 2 hours to reach the city centre by car. 

A system of navigable channels and locks connects the Moskva River with the Volga River, which is further connected to the [[Baltic Sea]], White Sea, the Azov, the Black Sea, and the Caspian Sea. In the Soviet times this allowed the official propaganda to refer to Moscow as "a port on the five seas".

===By bicycle===
Moscow is the easternmost destination of the [[EuroVelo cycling routes]]. [http://www.eurovelo.com/en/eurovelos/eurovelo-2 Eurovelo Route 2], the Capitals Route, is a 5,500 km route starting in [[Galway]], [[Ireland]], passing through [[Dublin]], [[London]], [[Berlin]], [[Warsaw]] and [[Minsk]] before terminating in Moscow.

==Get around== 

===Walking===
Be wary of bicyclists on the sidewalk weaving through pedestrians.  Their numbers are growing steadily and no regulations are enforced.  Always walk in a straight line and look over your shoulder if you move to the left or right.

===By public transport===
While central Moscow is best explored on foot, it's easiest to use public transportation to cover larger distances. The metro is comprehensive, boasts some great architecture, and is relatively cheap.

The easiest way to pay for metro fares is to buy a red paper ticket with a number of pre-loaded trips from the ticket booth. These tickets work on the buses and trolleys too. [http://troika.mos.ru/en/tariffs/table/ Fares] depend on the number of trips purchased; an 11-trip card costs RUB320 (RUB29 per trip). 

The cheapest way to use the public transportation system is to purchase a plastic [http://troika.mos.ru/en/about/where_to_buy/ Troika] re-loadable smart-card. The card costs RUB50 and can be redeemed for cash at the end of your trip. You can "top up" your balance at any metro station. For each trip taken, RUB36 will be deducted from your card, and you are entitled to change to a bus, tram, trolleybus, monorail or the cicrular city train line (МЦК, ''Em-Tse-Ka'', see below) for additional RUB20 within the next 90 minutes. Troika also can be used to pay an Aeroexpress ticket to one of the airports, Velobike bike sharing, the entrance to Tretiakov Gallery and some other museums and parks. Alternatively, red cards can be purchased at metro stations at a cost of RUB55 per trip or RUB747 for 20 trips. The red cards expire after 90 days. 

====By metro====
[[Image:Metro_moscow.jpg|thumb|Komsomolskaya metro station (Line 5), one of the most beautiful and well-known ones in Moscow]]
[[File:Sretensky Bulvar.jpg|thumb|Sretensky Bulvar Metro Station]]

The Metro is open from 5:30AM-1:00AM. Station entrances are closed at 1:00AM, and at this time the last trains depart from all of the termini stations. After 1:00AM, many locals will enter the train station using the exits, which are still open. Service on the ring line runs until 1:30AM, although entrances are closed at 1:00AM. The down escalators are also shut off at 1:00AM.

There is signage in the Metro stations in English and the Latin alphabet, but these signs are not everywhere. Next stop's announcements inside the cars are made both in Russian and English. Each train carriage has a map in Latin script and there is one near the entrance to each station. Note the direction of the train before you alight. It is worth printing or saving to your phone [http://news.metro.ru/sc_lat.html a map of the metro system in both Cyrillic and Latin letters] to take with you. All trains in the system have free WiFi onboard.

Note that 2 or 3 stations may be connected as transfer points but will each have a different name. There are 2 stations called '''Smolenskaya''' and 2 stations called '''Arbatskaya''', but the station pairs are not connected to each other despite having the same name. Some of the stations are very deep underground, and transfer times between certain metro lines can take a lot of time. In the city centre, it can save time to go directly to the above-ground entrance of the line you want to take rather than to enter at a connecting station and transfer underground. On the escalators, stand on the right and walk on the left.

Some of the train stations include beautiful architecture and it is worth taking a guided tour of the metro system. The most interesting stations in terms of decor are '''Komsomolskaya''' (ring line), '''Novoslobodskaya''' (ring line), '''Kievskaya''' (ring line), '''Kropotkinskaya''' (Line #1 - red), '''Kievskaya''' (Line #3 - dark blue), '''Arbatskaya''' (Line #3 - dark blue), '''Ploschad' Revolyutsii''' (Line #3 - dark blue), '''Mayakovskaya''' (Line #2 - dark green). Also look at the architecture of the ground entrance building of '''Arbatskaya''' (Line #4 - light blue) and '''Krasnye Vorota''' (Line #1 - red). History buffs may appreciate that Metro Line #4 (light blue) has the oldest stations, opened in 1935.

The '''Vorob'evy gory''' Metro Station on Line #1 (red) is unique in that it is on a bridge crossing the Moscow River. This bridge also carries auto traffic road on another level. There is a beautiful view through the transparent sides of the station. A great observing point around Moscow is located nearby on Vorob'evy hills, next to the main building of Lomonosov Moscow State University.
 
There are a couple of unique trains operating through the system and you will be lucky if you get to ride them. ''[https://www.mos.ru/en/news/item/22127073/ Aquarelle]'' (Watercolor) is a train that includes an art gallery. The train operates daily on Blue Line. The ''Sokolniki Retro Train'' is a train modeled after the original 1930s trains and it occasionally is placed into service, usually around a major anniversary of the metro system. During important Russian milestones some trains are thematically decorated.

The metro is relatively safe, although pickpockets are a problem, as they are in any environment where a lot of people are pressed together. Opportunistic petty crime, such as snatching someone's mobile phone and jumping out just as the doors are closing, is also commonplace. Take the usual precautions at night. There is no train guard or conductor, so the first car near the driver may be the safest. Every car is equipped with an intercom to the driver's cabin; they are beige boxes with a grill and a black button near doors, and mostly work, unless visibly vandalized.

====By bus and trolleybus/electrobus====
Every large street in the city is served by at least one bus and one trolleybus, which necessitate an abundance of trolley wires in the city. Since the end of 2018 trolleybuses are sometimes replaced by new comfortable KAMAZ electrobuses. Most Moscow buses and trolleybuses operate 05:30AM-01:00AM; however, there are a few routes that operate during the night.

Buses, trolleybuses, and electrobuses use exclusive public transport lanes whenever possible, are fast, punctual, and frequent until the late evening.

A trolleybus route map is available [http://opoccuu.com/moscowtrans.htm#5 online]. A useful mobile app called Yandex Transport helps you locate a nearest bus, trolleybus or tram on the line. The red tickets for the metro can be used on the buses and trolleys too.

====By tram====
There are several tram routes, although trams are not common in the city centre. A [http://www.urbanrail.net/eu/ru/mos/tram/mos-tram-map.htm map] and a [http://opoccuu.com/moscowtrans.htm#2 schedule] of the tram routes are available online.

====By marshrutka====
Marshrutka is a jitney-like mode of transport similar to a minibus. They follow similar routes as many bus lines and have a similar numbering system. Depending on the route, the fare is either paid in cash to the driver upon entering (usually RUB50) or is paid via a Troika card. They generally are faster and more efficient than buses, although the drivers are much more reckless. If you need to get off, you have to shout: "Остановите здесь!" (Astanaviti zdes, meaning "Stop here!") as loudly as possible so that the driver can hear. There is a saying "Тише скажешь – дальше выйдешь", meaning "If you speak quietly, you will travel far".

In 2016 most marshrutkas have been removed from the city. Almost all remaining minibuses are now a part of Moscow municipal public transportation system, and their only difference from regular buses is passenger capacity.

====By commuter rail====
МЦК (reads as ''Em-Tse-Ka'') is the latest and highly effective addition to the Moscow transit system. It was open to the public in 2016. The circular rail line (''Okruzhnaya'') that exists since the 1900's, is operational again as a mean of transport after the decades of purely freight use. It operates modern, spacious and quiet ''Lastochka'' (Swallow) regional-class trains built by Siemens. Although the historical placement of stations at the circular line doesn't always allow the smooth change to metro lines, it is worth considering, if you need to commute from one of a distant districts to another without going through the city center, with its overcrowded main connecting metro stations during the peak hour.

Local commuter trains (electrichkas) operate between the Moscow train stations and the suburbs of Moscow Oblast, but are of little for seeing the tourist attractions. Schedules can be accessed online at rasp.yandex.ru or via Yandex.Elektrichki (Яндекс.Электрички) app.

====By monorail====
[[File:Moscow Monorail.jpg|thumb|Moscow Monorail]]

'''Moscow Monorail''' is a 4.7km monorail line with 6 stations.
It is slower, less frequent, and has shorter operating hours when compared with the metro (every 15 min at peak hours, 25 min rest of the time). However, the view is picturesque. It is useful to get to the Ostankino Tower, or to get to the VDNKh exhibition centre from Metro Line #9 (silver).

===By taxi and rideshare===
{{cautionbox|Beware of unofficial taxis that like to hang around tourist areas, train stations, and airports. They use a taxi meter; however, their meter goes by a fabricated inflated rate. A 10-minute ride can easily cost RUB3000 instead of RUB400. Make sure to negotiate a fixed price before entering. Smartphone-based apps such as Uber, Yandex Taxi, and GetTaxi are popular and reliable in Moscow and the rating systems and customer support force the drivers to be accountable.}}

====Fares====
Rates for UberX are the cheapest among rideshare and taxi services. Non-surge rates are RUB50 base fare + RUB8 per minute + RUB8 per kilometer, with a RUB100 minimum. 

It is possible to negotiate the price with taxis drivers and not use the meter. Taxi fares within the Garden Ring are generally under RUB250. When negotiating with a street taxi, if you don't like the amount one guy is charging, you'll doubtlessly find another driver in a minute or two. Try to get an idea if the drivers know where they are going as many will pretend they know how to get to your destination just to get your business. Smartphone-based apps eliminate this problem since the drivers follow a GPS and the rates are fixed.

====Taxi operators====
The best solution is to use taxi hailing apps, such as Uber, Gett (known to travelers from Israel, UK and USA), Yandex.Taxi (the largest local taxi aggregator or so far, and it's also Uber's local parent company), Citimobil, Rutaxi, Taxi Maxim. They all have an English version of the interface and provide choice of payment options - cash or card.

There are several taxi services operating in Moscow, one of those noticeable on the streets being The New Yellow Taxi ('''Novoye Zholtoye Taxi'''). The cars are mainly yellow Skoda Octavia. They will charge the minimum rate of RUB400 no matter the distance.

If you're not good in Russian, there are several English-speaking taxi services operating in Moscow, the most notable being [https://lingotaxi.com/moscow-fares/ LingoTaxi]. Prices are generally higher but booking by phone is easier.

===By car===
Using a car in Moscow can be very time consuming and stressful. Traffic jams never seem to clear until the night. When there are no traffic jams, driving by car is the fastest way to go around Moscow, as there were made a lot of new roads and freeways. Be careful, as russian roads are dangerous, being designed for a fast but not safe driving. There are a lot of migrants from regions where aggressive driving is common. Some drivers will not think twice before cutting you off at the first opportunity.

One bright spot is the relative dearth of the large 18-wheeler trucks on Moscow roads. Sometimes, all traffic on major thoroughfares may be blocked by police to allow government officials to blow through unimpeded, sirens blaring. There is very little parking. Parking illegally can lead to a hefty fine of RUB2500 and your car being towed. If you are driving to Moscow, park as soon as you can at a safe place such as your hotel and use public transit.

Parking is usually not free and the costs can be found [http://parking.mos.ru/en/ online]. Expect to pay RUB80/hour for the parking within the Boulevard Ring and the district, RUB60/hour - between Boulevard Ring and Garden Ring, RUB40/hour between Garnen Ring and Third Transport Ring. Payment is available through SMS (Russian SIM-cards only), mobile app or at parking columns (usually accepting credit cards only). You have to pay for the full hour upfront, unused money will be sent back to your account.

However, if you have driven in [[Rome]] or [[Athens]] before, then it's not that hard to get accustomed to Moscow traffic. Just don't try to drive across the city during rush hours or you can be stuck for as long as 3 hours in traffic jams. Check one of the many traffic jam information websites before you start your journey. Avoid driving the bus lanes even unintentionally, as it turns out to be very costly due to a large amount of cameras. The most popular sites are [http://probki.yandex.ru Yandex Probki] and [http://probki.rambler.ru Rambler Probki]. Use Yandex.Navigator app to better navigate, avoid jams and be informed about radars and cameras. In general, taking the metro may actually be faster than driving. 

Roads are almost empty during holidays at the beginning of January and May as well as during weekends and the summer.

'''Gas stations''': BP, Lukoil, Gazpromneft, Rosneft gas stations all have good quality gasoline.

===By ship===

Boats are not the best way to move around the city fast, but they do offer great scenery. Just like most old Russian cities founded at big rivers, Moscow has been initially designed to impress newcomers from the water.

* Stolichnaya Sudokhodnaya Kompania (Capital River Boat Tour Company) offers  several scenic routes geared for tourists with prices in the range of RUB400-800. A pass is included in some hop-on-hop-off tours.

* [http://www.radisson-cruise.ru/index_en.php Flotilla Radisson Royal] offers several year-round cruises with prices in the range of RUB650-2,000. Unlike other tourist boats, these boats can move on ice very smoothly so that the waiter can easily pour champagne in crystal glasses on a table. There are huge panoramic windows to protect against the wind. The food is overpriced. The trips depart from either Hotel Ukraina or Gorky Park.

* A few hydrofoil passenger ships operate service from the North River Terminal to Bukhta Radosti (Bay of Joy), a popular picnic and barbeque spot with many cafes. This terminal is not close to the city center; the closest metro station is Rechnoi Vokzal.

===By bicycle===
'''[http://velobike.ru/en/ Velobike]''' operates a bike sharing network that has over 2,700 bicycles available at over 300 bike stations throughout city. To use it, you first have to register on the web site or via the mobile app. Membership rates are RUB150 per day or RUB500 for a month. Usage fees, which are in addition to membership fees, vary, but the first 30 minutes are free. This is intentional to encourage people to use the system for short place-to-place trips; however, after riding for 30 minutes, you can dock your bike into a station, wait 2 minutes, and then take the bike out again to restart the timer. The service is only operational in the spring and summer months. After docking the bike you should get an text message confirmation. If you do not get a confirmation, you should call the company; otherwise, you will be fined.

Before opting for a bicycle it's good to remember that Moscow belongs to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_claimed_to_be_built_on_seven_hills the prestigious club of cities built on seven hills]. You can use openstreetmap to check whether your planned route is uphill or downhill or just remember that the lowest parts of the city are the rivers - if you cycle away from the river, it is probably uphill.

===By hop-on-hop-off bus===
'''The hop-on-hop-off bus''' is a convenient way for tourists to see the major sights quickly and efficiently. The buses feature English-speaking guides to answer any questions. A 1 day pass costs US$24 for adults and US$15 for children.

===Museums and religious buildings=== 
[[Image:Red_Square.jpg|thumb|Red Square]]
* '''Red Square''' - The heart of Moscow and the first destination for most visitors to the city. Surrounded by St. Basil's Cathedral, the State History Museum, Lenin's Mausoleum and one of the Kremlin's long brick walls. The cobbles that make up the square are black and not red; the name comes from another gloss of the Russian word "krasniy", meaning "beautiful". Metro: Ohotnii Ryad, Teatralnaya or Ploshad Revolutsii. Red Square can be closed during the big events, such as Victory parade, Military Orchestra tattoo and others.
** '''Lenin Mausoleum''' - in the centre of the Red Square.

Founded in 2008 by Dasha Zhukova in Moscow, the institution is building a unique research archive focusing on the development of contemporary art in Russia while pioneering diverse educational projects for families and professionals that are the first of their kind in the country. These provide the foundation from which experimental exhibitions, events, and screenings are initiated.

[[File:VDNKh (All-Rssia Exhibition Centre) main entry.jpg|thumb|VDNKh (All-Rssia Exhibition Centre) main entry]]

* '''VDNKh''', aka '''VVTs'''. The Russian acronym "VDNKh" stood for "Exhibit of the People's Economic Achievements". It has been since renamed "All-Russian Exhibition Centre" ("Vserossiyskiy Vystavochniy Tsentr"). However, it is popularly known by the Soviet abbreviations. Previously this was a massive exhibit of the advances and progress of the USSR.  Now it is largely a marketplace for everything from computers to bicycles. However, many of the monuments and fountains here make the area a nice place to stroll. Bicycles and roller skates rent is available.

[[File:Cathedral of Christ the Saviour (evening).jpg|thumb|Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]]

* '''Christ the Saviour Cathedral'''  – This cathedral, the tallest Orthodox church in the world (the largest being the Temple of St. Sava in [[Belgrade]]), was blown up on orders from Stalin in 1931, with the view of building the gargantuan Palace of the Soviets, to be crowned by a 100 m high statue of Lenin. The project ran into engineering and geological difficulties (the area used to be a swamp), then the War intervened, and the place was ceded to a year-round open-air swimming pool. The pool was razed and the cathedral rebuilt only after the fall of the Soviet Union, in the mid-nineties. There is an extensive museum underneath the cathedral documenting its history (the original was started in 1839 and consecrated in 1883). Metro: Kropotkinskaya.

===Famous streets===
* '''Varvarka Street / Kitai-Gorod and Ulitsa Varvarka'''  – Varvarka is one of the oldest streets in Moscow. If you are going to spend just a few days in the Russian capital, then you definitely need to walk along this street. Varvarka Street is located in Kitay-gorod and embraces many historical aspects. It is a part of the trading quarter near the Kremlin which is surrounded by the Kitay-gorod defensive wall. Varvarka Street is rich in cathedrals that were visited by the Russian tsars on their way from the Kremlin. This street welcomed the victorious army and became the battlefield in several wars. Varvarka Street begins right behind the Pokrovsky Cathedral situated on Red Square near the Spasskaya Tower of the Moscow Kremlin which is better known as Saint Basil’s Cathedral. Varvarka Street is quite short and can be walked through in ten minutes. The first building is the '''Church of the Martyr Barbara''' belonging to classic style (1804). The second building is the '''Church of Maxim''' the Blessed (1699). Later the church got its ''bell tower'' (1829). In the 19th century, bell towers were usually attached to ancient churches so that they would be seen in urban areas. While walking further on Varvarka Street you will see several buildings which form the architectural ensemble of the Znamensky Monastery (since 1631). See the '''Chambers of the Romanov boyars''' (since the 16th century). It is believed that the first Romanov tsar spent there his early years. Then you will come across the beautiful '''Church of Saint George on Pskov Hill''' (1626). A bell tower was built-on near the church. The left side of Varvarka Street begins with the Middle Trading Rows (1893). At the end of the steet step down to the subway (Metro) and look to the left just at the end of the stairway. You can see the basement of ancient "Varvarskaya tower" - the entrance to the Kitay-gorod and mystic place of ancient Moscow.

* '''Old Arbat Street'''  – Walk down this kitschy street and don't forget to look at the small by-streets around the Arbat. They allow you to feel the "old Moscow spirit". Arbat is full of souvenir vendors, tourist cafes, lousy restaurants, artists, etc.  The prices of the souvenirs vary from reasonable to ripoff, but vendors are open to negotiation. Metro: Smolenskaya (both blue lines), Arbatskaya (both blue lines, from Dark Blue line take west exit). However, moscovites themselves dont really like this street, as there are too many tourists and, to be honest, there are a lot of other beautiful streets to walk around.

* '''New Arbat Street'''  – Located near Old Arbat Street, this street offers a contrast from the touristy pedestrian-only thoroughfare. New Arbat is perhaps where Moscow's rich are the most visible, as some of Moscow's most expensive restaurants and nightclubs are located here.  There are some reasonably priced cafes, however. The street is lavishly lit up at night and is always very lively. Also, check out Dom Knigi (House of Books) on New Arbat. It's not as impressive as the St. Petersburg store, but probably the best bet for books in Moscow. Metro: Arbatskaya (both blue lines, take west exit for Dark Blue line).

* '''Tverskaya Street'''  – This street starts from the Kremlin itself and runs northwest in the direction of [[Tver]] (hence the name) and [[Saint Petersburg]]. For that reason the road was a very important thoroughfare in Tsarist Russia. It is now Moscow's most fashionable street, with several prestigious boutiques. It is also lined with cafes, restaurants, coffeehouses, a couple of theaters, and several hotels, including two locations of the Marriott. Most of the street's architecture doesn't actually have much history to it, though along the way you will find Russia's first, and the world's busiest, McDonalds. The statue of Pushkin at Pushkinskaya Square is a very popular meeting point. Walk its length. From Red Square to Belorusski Train Station is about one hour and is a great way to see the most famous street in Moscow. Take a peek inside the Yeliseev Grocery Store, Moscow's answer to Harrod's food halls, to see the restored ornate interior. Metro south to north: Ohotnii Ryad/Teatralnaya, Tverskaya/Pushkinskaya/Chehovskaya (Puskinskaya Square), Mayakovskaya (Triumfalnaya Square, sometimes called second Theatre square, containing Chaikovskii Concert Hall, Satire Theatre and nearby Mossovet Theatre), Belorusskaya.

* '''Pyatnitskaya street'''
Pyatnitskaya is one the oldest streets of Zamoskvorechye district, which is located on the other side from Kremlin of Moscow river. It is named after the 16th century church that was destroyed by bolsheviks in 1934. Novokuznetskaya metro station entrance was build there instead. During Ivan the terrible times this street and its surroundings became a home for archers. Ever since the names of the lanes around refer to this historical fact. After the 1698 riot Peter the Great issued a decree to transfer the possessions of the archery to merchants.
Today Pyatnitskaya is a very beautiful historical street, that represents the view of old pretty, but not the most rich district of Moscow. There are a lot of cafes and restaurants where tourists as well as locals like to spend their free time. If you like architecture, this streets is a perfect place to enjoy it. You can find one of the few buildings of famous russian art nouveau architect Lev Kekushev (Pyatnitskaya, 33-35), but the most eye-catching building is, of course, St Clement's Church.

* '''Bolshaya Ordynka street'''
The oldest street of Zamoskvorechye. It was named in times of mongol-tatar invasion of Rus'. From this street the road to Mongol Empire began. Ordynka - from word Orda, which is horde - the name of mongolians in medieval period Russia.
Today it is one of the few streets where you can see the old two-storied Moscow - the old city that was almost completely destroyed during USSR. 
It was always and still remains the big road from city centre, so its more transit than neighbour Pyatnitskaya street with more cars and much less cafes. One of the most interesting places in this street is a unique art nouveau church hidden behind the fence and trees not far from Tretyakovskaya metro station (Bolshaya Ordynka, 34). Unique - because that style of religious architecture was new in the beginning of 20th century and, unfortunately, had no chances to blossom, as very soon the bolsheviks came to power and no more new churches of this style were build since that time. However, this is not the only church in this street.

* '''Sparrow Hills''', the highest point in the city for a panoramic view of Moscow.

* '''Cathedral of Christ the Saviour''': The Cathedral of Christ the Saviour is a Russian Orthodox cathedral in Moscow, Russia, on the northern bank of the Moskva River, a few hundred metres southwest of the Kremlin. With an overall height of 103 metres (338 ft), it is the tallest Orthodox Christian church in the world. Christ the Saviour Cathedral – This cathedral, the tallest Orthodox church in the world (the largest being the Temple of St. Sava in Belgrade), was blown up on orders from Stalin in 1931, with the view of building the gargantuan Palace of the Soviets, to be crowned by a 100 m high statue of Lenin. The project ran into engineering and geological difficulties (the area used to be a swamp), then the War intervened, and the place was ceded to a year-round open-air swimming pool. The pool was razed and the cathedral rebuilt only after the fall of the Soviet Union, in the mid-nineties. There is an extensive museum underneath the cathedral documenting its history (the original was started in 1839 and consecrated in 1883). Metro: Kropotkinskaya.

* '''Church of the Ascension''' (Церковь Вознесения Господня). Built to commemorate the birth of Ivan the Terrible, Kolomenskoye's Church of the Ascension upended the Byzantine style with its wooden conical tower, and proved to be a milestone in the history of Russian ecclesiastical architecture. Since 1994, it has enjoyed a spot on the UNESCO World Heritage list. Metro: Kolomenskaya or Kashirskaya, then walk through Kolomenskoye park.

* '''Lomonosov Moscow State University''' (MGU): Lomonosov Moscow State University (MGU) was established in 1755 and has more than 40,000 students (graduate and postgraduate). It is considered one of the oldest universities in Moscow and is part of "Stalin's Seven Sisters," a group of Moscow skyscrapers built in the Stalinist style of architecture.

* '''Novospassky Monastery''' This monastery complex dates back to the 12th century and is surrounded by thick walls originally built to protect Moscow from foreign invaders. Basement of the cathedral is the tomb of the Romanovs, the last kings of Russia. In addition, the monastery has a miraculous icon of the Mother of God "Vsetsaritsa", which helps in case of cancer.  Look skyward to see the sunlight catch the gold and blue domes. The bell towers are stunning and the feeling of awe is all around. At the time, this monastery's importance was second only after the Kremlin churches, mainly - the Assumption Cathedral. It was considered famiy church for the Romanovs' Royal dynasty, although it began before their ascension to the throne, even under the Zakhar'ins, the ancestors of Romanovs. They even arranged a family necropolis here, and then this fashion was picked up by other famous boyar surnames from the first range. To the elitarism of the monastery contributed its relative remoteness from the center of Moscow - formally it was not Zamoskvorechye, but in fact Krutitsky hill, on which stood the monastery, was even further. The wealth of the monastery had played with it a bad joke. When the Bolsheviks came to power, they destroyed and looted most of the monastery and took out the main values, and in the monastery itself they set up a concentration camp and placed other penitentiaries nearby. Here teven tortures and executions took place. Now the monastery was transferred to the Russia Orthodox Church and partially restored. The former luxury does not exist already, but, however, here remained still much to see and admire.

* '''House With Animals''': Its front wall is striped with a menagerie of fantastic beasts and magnificent monsters. This striking building in is nicknamed for the fantastic animals that frolic amid a swath of its front-facing wall—familiar critters like owls and ducks alongside make-believe beasts from chimeras to dragons. Fittingly, the locals have taken to calling the building the “House with Animals,” as its terracotta bas-relief is crammed with a collection of curious creatures. Against the backdrop of soft blue-green paint, the white figures look as though they belong in a gallery rather than on the streets of Moscow, and they’re sure to stop any passerby. The closest metro station is Chistye Prudy.

* ''Monument to the Conquerors of Space'':  Moscow's imposing monument to the space age.
  
* '''Miniature Moscow''': Back in the tiny USSR.  The key element of the exhibition is detailed interactive scale-model of Moscow. It is 368 sq. m and shows 20 000 buildings withing Sadovoye Ring. Light shows and exhibitions are hold daily im the pavillion. Created in 1977 by 300 workers for the 60th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution, Miniature Moscow is a very detailed depiction of the USSR’s capital.

Hours: 11:00 am - 7:00 pm. Address: Mira Ave., 119 | VDNKh, Sirenevaya alley, pavillion Maket Moskvy

* '''Laika Monument (Pamyatnik Sobake Layke)''': It took over half a century but a Russian monument to a famous and tragic space pup finally stands in Moscow. Strangely, the famous mongrel did not receive her own monument in the Russian capital until 2008. The (surprisingly small) monument that now stands near a military research station is shaped like an abstract rocket that morphs into a hand, cradling Laika towards the stars. If only her actual fate had been so peaceful.   Address: Petrovsko-Razumovskaya Alley, 12A, Moscow 127083

* '''Hotel Ukraina (Radisson Royal Hotel)''': The tallest hotel in Europe. Address: Kutuzovsky Ave, 2/1, стр. 1, Moskva

* '''Sokol''': An early-20th-century "dacha" village of quaint cottages curiously located in a modern part of Moscow. If you happen to stumble across Sokol while exploring Moscow, you’d be forgiven for thinking you’d somehow left the city. The quaint dachas (Russian country cottages) that dot the tree-lined streets make this neighborhood look more like a rural village than an urban settlement.

* '''Public Museum of the Moscow Metro''': Hidden in a metro shop under a shopping mall, this small museum tells the story of one of the world's largest urban transit systems. It's not the easiest place to find either, once you've got to the top of the escalator and just before you exit the station there is a door on your right with a museum sign next to it. It doesn't look right but let yourself in and then go up 4 flights of stars and you have arrived!! It is free to enter and to be honest I walked around the small rooms in about 30mins. It's only a 10-15 minute ride out of Moscow from the center on the red line. Free entry, good display, great for young ones and old, they have a virtual drive Metro train. Come up esculator and put doors and it is straight ahead. Address: 36 , Khamovnicheskiy Val, Str, Moskva, Russia, 119048. Near: Vystavochnaya Metro station on the light blue Metro line. Hours:Tuesday - Saturday	1pm–4am / Sunday	Closed / Monday	Closed

* '''Old English Court''': The "Mystery and Company of Merchant Adventurers" - an Elizabethan era hangout in Moscow. The Old English Yard is not a name for a landmark one would expect to encounter in the very center of Russian capital. Tucked away, beyond the far side of the Red Square this unimposing building is overlooked by most of the visitors. However, old English yard hides a fascinating history. Hours Tue – Wed 10:00 am - 6:00 pm Thu 11:00 am - 9:00 pm Fri – Sun 10:00 am - 6:00 pm. Address: Varvarka St., 4, Moscow 109012

* '''Garden of Fallen Monuments (Fallen Monument Park)'''– Where many infamous statues in Moscow were placed after the Soviet collapse. See Dzherzinsky, Stalin, Brezhnev, and others. Adjacent to the New Tretyakov Museum, which houses 20th century art. After the Pushkin Museum and the Tretyakov Gallery, this is worth seeing. Metro: Oktyabrskaya. Everyday open 24 hours. With the fall of the USSR, the thousands of Soviet statues were destroyed or dispersed. Some ended up here in the Fallen Monument Park. Also known as Art Muzeon or Park of the Fallen Heroes, the park has mutilated busts of Stalin, as well as those of Lenin and a statue of Dzerzhinsky, the founder of what became the KGB. There’s a massive Soviet emblem, and clusters of modern art contrasting with the very non-conceptual Communist monuments. There is a small charge to enter the park. Due to development in the area, its future is currently uncertain. Know Before You Go: Take the 5 (brown line) to Oktyabrskaya and exit to Main Street. Turn left and cross the street and continue downhill until you're across from Gorky Park and keep going further down the street. Address: 10/4, Ulitsa Krymskiy Val / at New Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow 119049

* '''The Tretyakov Gallery / The State Tretyakov Gallery'''  With the largest collection of Russian art in the world, the gallery is a wonderful way of seeing the culture of Russia develop through its art. highly recommend to take a guided tour. It takes 5h to see the whole exhibition so better to come before afternoon. This is a large art museum filled with Russian Art from various ages up to early 20th century. Well worth your time and easily accessed from Metro. As a bonus there is a square outside of the Metro that offers several places for a meal including McDonalds. The museum is a lot bigger than it looks and offers a comprehensive history of Russian Art. We had a guided tour and I would highly recommend getting one - as the guides are passionate about the gallery and bring the paintings to life. (Ruble 500 ) Metro ride from Red Square and the neighbourhood is quite pleasant as well. Arrive early as it is very busy and the line to enter is always long. We arrived when it first opened and had to wait 20 minutes to get in and when we left over three hours later the line was just as long. We know why and after you go, you will as well. Also the park is a great place to stroll around. Address: Lavrushinskiy ln, 10, Moscow 119017, Russia. Hours: Sun - Sat 10:00 am - 9:00 pm.
Note that the main building houses the collection of "classic" era -- from old slavonic icons to the end of XIX century.

===Day Trips=== 
* '''The Central Air Force Museum''' - The Central Air Force Museum, or CMAF as it's also known, is located about 25 miles east of the Yaroslavsky Railway Station in Moscow. It is approximately 1 mile south of the train station in Monino. There are infrequent signs to the museum if you walk. The best way to get there is either by taxi or by using a map with a GPS. If you start out in Moscow, take the Metro to Komsomolskaya station. You have to walk over to the railway terminal and buy a ticket for the local train service to Monino. The ticket booth is outside the main ticket building. Look for the windows (3) that have hand-written signs near them with time tables (in Russian). Just ask for a ticket to Monino. There is service every 20-30 minutes, except for the middle of the day (1.5 hour gap). There are both local and express trains. The express trains are more like intercity/international trains (with individual seats) and they are painted differently. There is no notable time difference between them though - for both types it takes about 1h 15m to get to Monino. Monino is a commuter suburb of Moscow. It mainly just has high-rise apartment buildings and a few shops near the train station. Walk south from the station until you hit the museum boundary. Then walk around the east side so you don't go several miles around the wrong way. Admission was only about R250 (~$4 or so). The museum itself is a very interesting contrast in modern and old-style Russian. Some parts of it are very new while other parts were probably designed in the 60s-70s. There are several dozen aircraft outside in various states of repair. Some are set up like the A&S in Washington. Others (I saw a Mig-29 in the grass) are fairly neglected. There is a large indoor hangar with many WWII aircraft and displays that get wet from a leaky roof. Overall this is a place to visit mainly if you enjoy aviation, especially since it is off the beaten path. I spent 2 1/2 hours there, which was enough to see the indoor and outdoor displays. If you enjoy military aircraft, plan on 2-3 hours. Some of the plaques are in English, but not most. '''The Monino Central Air Force Museum is open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on every day of the week except for Mondays and Tuesdays'''.[http://www.cmaf.ru/]

===Theatre===
Moscow has several world-class theatres (Bolshoi, Maly, Moscow Art Theatre, to name a few), and it is definitely worth planning a visit to one of them, although it is neither easy, nor cheap.

Moscow has two '''circuses''', the Nikulin circus on Tsvetnoi Bulvar (metro Tsvetnoi Bulvar), and the new circus near the University. Tickets can be bought for as little as RUB200, and even these seats are good.

Sometimes they are selling tickets at the cover price, and sometime at twice the price. Ask and make sure before parting with your cash.

The '''Obraztsov Puppet Theatre''' at the very north part of the Garden Ring has performances during the winter in the evening. Everything is in Russian and meant for children, but the stories are simple and quite understandable even if you don't understand Russian. There is a small box in front of the building where a puppet appears every hour and does a performance. At 12 midday all of the puppets appear for a short but entertaining appearance.

===Banyas===
[[File:Sandunovskiye Baths.jpg|thumb|Sandunovskiye Baths]]
Make sure you visit a '''Russian bathhouse''' ''(banya)'' while in Moscow, as it's an important Russian tradition and Russians, especially aged 40+, go at least once a week. Have a hot steam, followed by a good whipping with birch branches.

Like any city with snowy winters, Moscow is a great place to go '''ice skating'''.

* Bosco rink on a Red Square is glamorous and easy, although bit costly and not too favoured by advanced skaters.

==Learn==
[[Image:Moscow_State_University.jpg|thumb|Moscow State University main building]]

Moscow remains the educational centre of Russia and the former USSR. There are 222 institutes of higher education, including 60 state universities & 90 colleges. Some of these offer a wide-spectrum of programs, but most are centred around a specific field. This is a hold-over from the days of the USSR, when Soviet-wide there were only a handful of wide-spectrum "universities" mostly with fundamental educational programs and research (mathematics and mechanics, all branches of physics, chemistry, biology, etc.) and a large number of narrow-specialization "institutes" focusing on applied science such as different fields of engineering (mostly in Moscow and Saint Petersburg). Moscow offers some of the best business/management, science, & arts schools in the world. Moscow is also a popular destination for foreign students to learn Russian.

It is possible to work in Moscow, you just need to find a good company to support you.

==Buy==

Currency exchange offices are plentiful in the city, but be sure to count your change and note that the advertised rates sometimes don't include an added commission or only apply to large exchanges.

===Shopping Malls===

Large shopping malls are common near metro stations.

There are more than 500 shops, a cinema with 17 halls, winter garden, and a 4-level aquarium with tropical fish. The stores were initially slow to open due to the weak economy but it is now fairly busy. Don't expect to find anything of particular interest here, it is full of mainstream shops and brands that you could easily find in any other large shopping mall anywhere else in the world. And if you were thinking you might find a bargain, think again, compared for example with Western Europe or North America, prices are steep. Most interesting is probably roaming around the supermarket, where you'll be able to find all kinds of Russian foods and an impressive selection of vodka, despite it being a French chain (Auchan). The aquarium is impressive but it's certainly not worth visiting Aviapark specifically to see it.</buy>

Dining establishments in Moscow range from food stalls near metro stations to quick canteen-style 'Stolovaya' eateries to American-style fast food chains to overpriced restaurants catering to tourists to high-end restaurants where you can spend RUB10,000.

Restaurants and cafes promising "European and Caucasus cuisine" generally cater to tourists and are usually bad; seek a restaurant that specializes in a single region instead (Georgian, Russian, Italian, French, etc.).

Many small restaurants offer lunch specials costing RUB200-250. These deals are valid from 12:00 to 15:00 and include a cup of soup or an appetizer, a small portion of the main dish of the day, bread and a non-alcoholic beverage.

===Tipping===

==Stay safe==
[[File:Moscow at night at Lubyanskaya ploshchad.jpg|thumb|Moscow at night at Lubyanskaya ploshchad]]
Moscow enjoys a relatively low crime rate. However, Moscow is a large metropolis so common sense should be used. Avoid dark alleys - like you would anywhere else. 

Keep in mind that all the drugs are strictly prohibited. Any quantity of prohibited substances can lead to a jail. 

Keep an eye out for pickpockets on metro, in train stations, airports, sightseeing places, and other crowded areas; avoid going on dark deserted streets at night.

The police may demand to see your papers to check if you have been registered within 7 business days of your arrival into Moscow. Always remember that if you stay in a hotel then you are automatically registered and will be handed a confirmation paper at a time of check-in, so don't worry in this case. The police are usually looking for illegal migrants from Central Asia and unless you fit this profile, you are unlikely to be questioned.

In winter months, streets in Moscow can get very slippery. Take a pair of grippy shoes or, even better, boots (to prevent twisted ankles) and a waterproof raincoat. Take care as ice patches are often hard to spot, even when they appear to have been cleared or melted. Wearing non-grippy shoes could result in injury.

Downtown Moscow is very brightly lit, and a lot of the wide roads have underground pedestrian walkways. Those are well lit too - so you shouldn't worry about going down inside them. But of course, like anywhere else, do use common sense, and keep an eye out for pickpockets. Use the pedestrian crossings to cross the street, as traffic can get pretty crazy often times. Furthermore, racism and homophobia is prevalent in Moscow and other major cities.

Beware of Taxi scams. These are pretty common, especially close to the airports, railway stations, tourist sights, bars and clubs. Do not get into the car unless you agreed on price before. DO NOT hope for taxi meters, this can lead you into a  bigger scam. The safest way is using UBER, Yandex or similar apps. If not possible, try to arrange the price before. Also using this cars can be dangerous. Taxi drivers are often quite reckless drivers, however if you politely ask the driver to slow down there is a chance that they will do that. It is also not advised to ride with unnoficial "nelegalniye" (illegal) taxis as they are often old cars which may lack essential safety standards like seatbelts, which together with the fact that their drivers are often very reckless and often use their phone while driving, creates a big risk of getting in an accident.You might also be surprised to see some cars driving with their music volume all the way up and their windows rolled down, unfortunately this is quite normal and there is no law against it.  Also keep in mind that in very heavy traffic (which is basically every morning and evening) some crazy drivers (applies to all kinds of vehicles) may attempt to bypass the traffic by driving through the opposite lane or on the sidewalk.

As is the case everywhere else in Russia, driving in Moscow is a pretty crazy experience. Even though laws have been made tougher and fines bigger, the majority of drivers on the road got their drivers licence using bribery. Because of this, you will notice a lot of people doing things like suddenly swerving accross 6 lanes of traffic, speeding by a lot, aggressively cutting you off, drifting (usually people with old modified Japanese cars or expensive Porsches,BMWs or Mercedes, usually at night), running red lights (including the almost-traditional Russian practice of flying through a red light at a busy intersection), not yielding to pedestrians and etc. It is advised that if you are going to drive in Moscow that you get yourself a dashcam, as if you get in an accident with a local person (mind you, even a tiny markless bump is still considered a vehicular accident by Russian law) the traffic police will most likely be biased in their favour.

==Get out==
Since Moscow is the biggest transportation centre in Russia and one of main the points of entry for the foreign tourists, it is a convenient starting point for exploring much of European Russia. Even travelling through Moscow to Ukraine and some Caucasian and Central Asian countries (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan etc.) could be cheaper than direct flights from Europe/North America. Travel deals to Moscow are not rare and ticket prices are often pretty low within the former USSR.

* '''[[Saint Petersburg]]''' - 13 different overnight trains leave Moscow for the 7 hr (or thereabouts) journey, arriving the next morning. You can either take the sleeper trains, which is a very interesting experience.  Russians have a "train" culture, so it's very possible that you will meet your bunk mates and have a meal and drink with them.  You can also take the high-speed ''Sapsan'' trains - they take about 4 hours, and the vistas rushing by are very lovely. You might even consider paying the extra money for a first class sleeper cabin which has two comfortable beds. Included in the price is a small snack for supper and breakfast. There is also an attendant for each carriage who is willing to make tea in classic metal and glass tea glasses. Very civilized way to travel.

*'''[[Krasnogorsk|Arkhangelskoye]]''' - One of the finest of [[Moscow Oblast]]'s usadbas (estates) is only a short elektrichka ride away from Moscow and makes a fine day excursion.

*'''[[Golden Ring]]''' - Old cities and towns rich in historical buildings, situated in the heartland of Muscovy Russia. There are many tourist companies organizing guided tours, but travellers with rudimentary knowledge of Cyrillic alphabet can do it independently. Many guidebooks are available in English.

*'''Kubinka Tank Museum''' [http://mbtvt.ru/] - One of finest armour collections in the world. About one hour west of the city, accessible by local train (eletrichka) or REKS express train [http://rexexpress.ru/](blue trains with Dachshund on the train cars), and take cab (200 rubel for one way) or marshrutka N59 to the "Tankoviy Muzey" bus stop (only RUB30but after the arriving to the bus stop you should to walk 600 meters on foot along the road until you reach museum checkpoint) from the train station. Earlier access was restricted, previously visitors had apply for a permit. Only a photocopy of the visa and the passport is required for the entrance (at least for EU citizens). The fee is RUB1500  + RUB300 for photo for foreigners. Entrance for kids under 6 years old is free. Definitely worth the bother for any self-respecting tank buff.

*'''Leninskiye Gorki''' - An old country estate, expropriated by the Communist authorities after 1917 and used by V. Lenin as his country residence when he became ill. Large museum, although pretty decrepit now.

*'''[[Borodino]] battlefield''' - This is the site of the famous Battle of Borodino. Museum and national historic site [http://www.borodino.ru/eng_museun.shtml]. Commuter trains from Belorussky Station; 2-3 daily, travel time about 2 hours.

*'''[[Monino]]''' - home of the Central Air Force Museum.

*'''[[Kulikovo Field]]''' - a historical area of famous 1380 Kulikovo battle against mongol invaders

*'''Melikhovo (Chekhov's country house south of Moscow)'''

*'''[[Sergiev Posad]]''' - Famous old Orthodox monastery (Troitse-Sergieva Lavra). Commuter trains from Yaroslavsky Station, several daily; travel time about 1 1/2 hours.

*'''[[Kolomna]]''' - A nice medieval town (about 2 hrs from Moscow) with a number of very interesting churches and monasteries

*'''[[Yasnaya Polyana]] (Leo Tolstoi's country house close to Tula)'''

*'''[[Klin]]''' - A small town in Moscow Region hosting the House-Museum of Pyotr Tchaikovsky

*'''Peredelkino''' - a dacha complex just southwest of Moscow with museum-houses of many prominent Russian poets and writers (e.g. Pasternak, Yevtushenko, Okudzhava, Chukovsky)

*'''New Jerusalem Resurrection Monastery''' - A monastery-fortress (male, working) with a number of museums inside and next to the walls: Wooden architecture museum, local history museum, Art and History museum etc. The monastery was founded in 1656 by Tzar Alexis II and Patriarch Nikon (his "cell", a three-storey house stands in the park outside the monastery walls) to resemble the original Jerusalem. The place is roughly between Novoierusalimskaya (15 min on foot) and Istra (15 min by bus) elektrichka stations, around 60 km from Moscow.

*'''Savvino-Storozhevskiy monastery''' - A beautiful monastery with interesting history, closely connected to Russian Tzars. Commuter trains from Belorussky station to [[Zvenigorod]], several daily; travel time about an hour, but the terminus of the elektrichka is 2 miles from the town, which boasts a number of historically significant churches itself, and about 3 miles from the monastery, which is on a nearby hill. 

*'''[[Dmitrov]]''' - A town about 65 km North from Moscow (trains from Savelovsky station, several daily, travel time 1 1/2 hours), on Moscow Channel, with old churches, interesting sculptures in the streets and a number of museums. Hot air balloon flights over Dmitrov area are possible.

*'''Snegiri''' - Settlement about 40 km from Moscow (Volokolamskoe hwy) that boasts a monument to the Defense of Moscow during WW2, with a good collection of tanks, and a museum. Trains from Rizhsky Station, several daily, travel time about an hour.

*'''[[Smolensk]]''' - A very worthwhile day trip to one of the oldest Russian cities with an ancient fortress. Buses and trains leave from Belorussky Railway Terminal several times a day, cost from 800 RUB and take about 5.5 hours.

*[http://wikitravel.org/en/Balakovo Balakovo] - about a 1000 km south-east from Moscow, a jewel on Volga river with nice natural sceneries, wonderful and cheap food, warm and hospital people. 21hrs train will take you directly from Moscow to Balakovo. Many Moscow inhabitants prefer to spend summer camping on the island Pustynniy Ostrov near Balakovo to enjoy warm beaches, fresh fish and vegetables, as well as to get rest in a quiet place after noisy Moscow life.
