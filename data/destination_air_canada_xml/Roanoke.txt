==Get around==
The city layout of Roanoke does not lend itself well to effective mass transit, and in fact most locals never use mass transit at all.  The city does operate a fairly extensive bus system, [http://www.valleymetro.com/ Valley Metro], that serves most commonly-visited points in the valley.  Valley Metro began operating a new bus service in 2004 called [http://www.smartwaybus.com/ The Smart Way], which connects Blacksburg and the New River Valley with Roanoke.

The town of Blacksburg - a small college town not far from Roanoke - operates a far more effective mass transit system, [http://www.btransit.org/ Blacksburg Transit].  Many students at Virginia Tech do not own a vehicle of their own and rely on the "BT" for their daily commute.
