{{pagebanner|Little Rock Skyline Banner.jpg}}

'''Little Rock''' [http://littlerock.com/] became the capital of the Arkansas Territory in 1819 and of the state of [[Arkansas]] in 1836. The metropolitan area population was 734,622 in 2016 census estimate. The Combined Statistical area population which includes Pine Bluff had 905,847 in the 2016 census estimate. The city proper had 193,524 in 2010.

==Understand==
Little Rock lies at the center of the state, more-or-less where the Ozark Mountains, the Ouachita Mountains, and the Mississipi Alluvial Plain (the "Delta") come together. Traveling east from Little Rock, you traverse flat land nearly all the way to the Mississippi River; traveling west you quickly enter hilly country.

Little Rock is Arkansas' largest city, as well as the state capital and major economic center (although northwestern Arkansas, with Wal-Mart, Tyson Foods, and major trucking firms, is rapidly gaining). Little Rock is home to the state's only medical school, as well as the University of Arkansas Little Rock Bowen School of Law.

===History===
Little Rock derives its name from a small rock formation on the south bank of the Arkansas River called La Petite Roche (the "little rock"). The "little rock" was used by early river traffic as a landmark and became a well-known river crossing. The original historic "little rock" was later dynamited and used as a foundation for a railroad bridge, but its location can be visited in downtown's Riverfront Park.

Little Rock is located at the first high that upstream travelers on the Arkansas River came to, and so was a logical place to found a settlement. When it became apparent that the original capital of Arkansas Territory, Arkansas Post, was too subject to flooding, the seat of government was moved to Little Rock in 1819.

===Climate===
Temperatures can range from above 90°F (32°C) in the summer, peaking in August and September, to below freezing in December and January. The most pleasant times of year to visit are fall and spring; the changing of the leaves in fall is particularly enticing.

==Get in==

===By plane===

Newly renamed '''Bill and Hillary Clinton National Airport''' ({{IATA|LIT}}) ({{ICAO|KLIT}}), [http://www.lrn-airport.com/] lies just east of downtown Little Rock, about 10 minutes from the Clinton Presidential Library. It is served by all major airlines. Southwest Airlines is the airport's largest carrier with service to five destinations. The airport has a single, 12-gate terminal building.  

To get from the airport to Downtown Little Rock, you can take the #12 bus. [https://rrmetro.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/12_ClintonCenterAirport.pdf]

==Get around==

===By train===

* River Rail Trolleys [http://www.cat.org/rrail/]

In November of 2004, in time for the grand opening of the Clinton Library, Little Rock's River Rail Trolley system was completed.  Children ride free; adult fare is $1 per ride, or $2 for a day pass.  The trolley will take you to most of the major downtown attractions, as well as across the Arkansas River to downtown North Little Rock.  

You can pick up a River Rail schedule from any of the hotels or downtown attractions.  It passes by every 15 minutes or so.  The trolley is a fun, easy way to get around downtown Little Rock but tends to operate slowly.

===By car===

If you'd like to see more than Downtown, a car is your best bet.

While taxis aren't as common a sight in Little Rock as they are in Dallas or Atlanta, they are available.  You'll definitely be able to find one at the airport, and probably you'll see one pass through downtown if you're patient.  A better plan would be to call in advance.  You can call Capitol Cab at (501) 570-9999.

If you're renting a car:  I-630 runs from east/west from downtown to the edge of west Little Rock; for most attractions you won't go too far north or too far south of 630.

Be aware while driving that east Little Rock is pretty much flat, whereas west Little Rock can get extremely hilly.

{{cautionbox|The River Rail streetcar tracks on Markham, Second, and Third Streets near the River Market and Clinton Library in downtown Little Rock and Main and Maple Streets in North Little Rock present a hazard to street parking. It would probably be wise to walk or ride the trolleys to visit these streets.}}

===By bus===

* Central Arkansas Transit Authority [http://www.cat.org]

Unlike the River Rail Trolleys, the city bus travels city-wide.  One way fare is $1.35 for adults or $1.40 with a transfer. Service is infrequent even in the city and stops running fairly early in the evening (normally around 8 pm). Bus service in the suburbs is practically non-existent.

===By bike===
Little Rock has a large population of cyclists. There is a large mixed use pedestrian and bike loop connecting both North Little Rock and Little Rock's downtown corridors. There are bike rental places such as River Trail Rentals, +1 (501) 374-5505‎, that are located along the Arkansas River Trail [http://www.rivertrail.org/].Try the juncttion bridge, or the Big Dam Bridge, which is the longest bridge in the world dedicated to pedestrians and cyclists.

Proceed with caution while traveling downtown in the River Market area. There are no dedicated bike paths other than the Arkansas River Trail, and the River Rail Trolley tracks have deep ruts which can knock off cyclists not paying attention.

==See==

===East Little Rock===
The eastern edge of Little Rock is sparsely populated but is a vital economic area, as Little Rock National Airport and Little Rock River Port are both located here.

Many of the city's most popular restaurants are located along Kavanaugh, along with art galleries and odd and interesting shops, both funky and upscale. Hillcrest is mix of mid-priced houses and apartments along with fine old houses. The Heights represents more of the old-money Little Rock Country Club crowd.

===West Little Rock===

Not too many years ago Little Rock essentially ended about where I-430 now runs, but in recent years the pace of development in the western part of the city has been rapid, in both commercial and residential areas. Big box stores, chain restaurants, new hotels, and apartment complexes and subdivisions stretch for miles west of I-630, especially along Chenal Parkway, West Markham Street, and Cantrell, Bowman, and Shackleford Roads. 

*'''C. Maurice Lewis Jr. Natural Resource Complex''', 2 Natural Resources Dr. ''(off Markham St., east of Shackleford Rd. and I-430)''.

===North Little Rock===

North Little Rock [http://northlittlerock.ar.gov/] is an independent city just across the Arkansas River from downtown Little Rock.

*'''Argenta Historic District''' Located in the original downtown of North Little Rock next to the new Stephens Ballpark, one of the oldest preserved neighborhoods in central Arkansas. Argenta is a wonderful example of neighborhood renovation, where citizens and the Main Street program worked together to turn a neighborhood completely around.

*'''Arkansas Inland Maritime Museum''' [http://www.aimm.museum/], 120 Riverfront Park Dr., ''+1 501'' 371-8320.

===The Arkansas River Trail===

The circular '''Arkansas River Trail''' [http://www.rivertrail.org] runs from downtown Little Rock, west along the Arkansas River to the Big Dam Bridge, crosses it, then runs back east to downtown North Little Rock, finally completing the loop after crossing the historic Junction Bridge. Soon you'll be able to go all the way to Pinnacle Mountain, once the Two Rivers Bridge west of the Big Dam Bridge is finished. A great place to exercise by walking, running, roller skating, or cycling.
*'''Big Dam Bridge''' [http://www.bigdambridge.com/] The centerpiece of the Arkansas River Trail is this 4,226 foot long pedestrian/bike bridge over the Murray Lock and Dam, linking Little Rock's Murray Park with North Little Rock's Cooks Landing Park. Absolutely not to be missed.

==Stay safe==
The downtown area around the major hotels and in the River Market area is reasonably safe, but if you wander too far off the beaten track, you may quickly find yourself in questionable surroundings. There have been robberies of pedestrians in parking areas around the River Market, although most were probably not random. Be sure to take a map if you explore the Quapaw Quarter, and avoid walking around here late at night. Most violent crime occurs in the South End area of Little Rock (areas south of I-630) and Southwest Little Rock (65th St/Baseline Rd/Chicot Rd/Geyer Springs Rd). The Downtown area has a growing population of homeless. Try to avoid Roosevelt Road, East End (Projects just east of I-30 near the Arkansas River), parts of Broadway Street, and areas behind the Capitol Building.

Use the same precautions you would in any other urban area. Gangs and street crime can occur in North Little Rock, near Dixie, Rose City (around E. Broadway St), and north and west of historic Argenta (around Pike Ave and Percy Machin Dr), and parts of Little Rock near South End by the UALR campus.

==Get out==  
* [[Memphis]] is a two hour drive east on I-40. 
* [[Hot Springs]] is a one hour drive southwest of Little Rock.
* '''Petit Jean State Park''' [http://www.petitjeanstatepark.com/] is a little over one hour drive west of Little Rock.
