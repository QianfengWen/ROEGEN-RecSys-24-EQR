'''Pointe Noire''' is a city in [[Republic of the Congo]].

==Understand==
Pointe Noire is the second city of the Republic of the Congo.  It is also a major sea port and a tourist destination.  The town has a very French feel to it, because of the colonial past and the still large number of French expatriates and tourists.

==Get in==

===By plane===
Pointe Noire is served by international airlines such as Air France, Turkish Airlines and Ethiopian Airlines and local airlines Africa Airways, Trans Air Congo and Canadian Airways Congo from Brazzaville.  The airport is not far from the town or beach hotels.  A taxi should cost CFA1000 to the centre but drivers will often ask 1500.

===By train===
It is possible from Brazzaville once a week. The train line started up again in 2023 and runs from Brazzaville every Saturday and from Pointe Noire every Thurday. Prices vary from 6000cfa for third class to 15000cfa for a couchette.

===By car===
You can drive the road from Brazzaville to Point Noire in a day. The new road is worth driving on just to get a feel for the forest/grassland region of Congo. In the winding roads through the Mayombe mountains it's possible to get stuck behind slow moving logging trucks, so do not cut the trip too fine.

===By bus===
Many bus companies serve Pointe Noire from Brazzaville - Oc√©an du Nord and Trans Bony Express run the most frequently. Buses in both directions leave early in the morning and prices vary from 7000 to 13000. These buses stop in many settlements on the way.

===By shared taxi===
Shared taxis go to Pointe Noire from Tchiamba Nzassi on the Angolan border for 1000cfa per person.

==Get around==
Roads inside the town are in varying conditions. 

Taxis in PNR cost 1000cfa for a ride within a shorter distance, longer distance prices are negotiated with the driver. If you use a taxi more than 1 hour you will have to pay 3000 XAF for that hour.
