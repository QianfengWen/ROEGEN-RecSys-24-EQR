'''Arequipa''' is a city in the [[Southern Coast (Peru)|Southern Coastal]] region of [[Peru]] just below the edge of the [[Altiplano (Peru)|Altiplano]], at 2380 meters above sea level and surrounded by three impressive volcanoes.  It's Peru's second most important city (after [[Lima]]), and the second most popular among tourists (after [[Cuzco]]). 

==Understand==
[[Image:El_Misti_-_July_2003.jpg|thumb|El Misti volcano, Arequipa]]
The city is part of the so called "Southern Peru Tourist Corridor", together with [[Nazca]], [[Puno]] and [[Cusco]]. In contrast to these other cities, Arequipa is an example of the Spanish and mestizo culture developed in Peru. There are no Inca artifacts or ruins in the city.

In the winter it is drier than in the summer. It is nicknamed the 'white city' (''la ciudad blanca'', in Spanish), because many of the buildings in the area are built of ''sillar'', a white stone. This rock was quarried from the many volcanoes that surround the city, including the towering '''El Misti'''. Another theory which is commonly believed by the local population, is that the name 'white city' came about because it was built by spanish immigrants from the Basque Country who had pale skin and blonde hair. New Urban and archeological discoveries have shown that the frontage of houses were painted in different colours. Remaining examples can be found in the 'Casa Tristan del Pozo', the town centre. Ask for local help to identify Misti, Chachani and PichuPichu, the three volcanoes surrounding the city. 

Arequipa embodies a rich mix of the indigenous and Spanish colonial cultures. With 478 years of history since its founding, examples of Spanish colonial architecture can be found throughout the center of the city and several surrounding districts. UNESCO has declared it a Human Heritage site.  Catholic churches are scattered throughout the center of the city.  Some ancient houses have been refurbished by the local authorities and serve as living museums. An example of this are the so-called "Tambos" located at Puente Bolognesi street.

==Get in==

===By plane===
By far the easiest way to get to Arequipa is by plane, landing in '''Rodríguez Ballón airport''' ({{IATA|AQP}}), 8km from the city. Latam (formerly LAN Peru) [https://www.latam.com] flies from [[Lima]] and [[Cuzco]]. Avianca (formerly Taca) [http://www.avianca.com], Peruvian Airlines [http://www.peruvian.pe] and LC Peru [http://www.lcperu.pe] fly from their hubs in [[Lima]]. There are several connecting flights from [[Juliaca]] in Avianca and Latam. Peruvian Airlines also has non-daily flights to the coastal city of Tacna, in the border with Chile.

A taxi from the airport to the Plaza de Armas costs a flat-rate of S/20; go to the counter before leaving the baggage claim area to avoid hassle.  Signs are posted with this rate, but depending on the size of the car, the size of your bags and your [[haggling|bartering skills]] you could pay less.

If you exit the airport on foot and follow the road for about 1.5km you will eventually come to a T-junction. Cross the road and you will find a bus stop. Combis (small buses) go from here via the plaza de armas. The journey takes about 20/30 minutes, depending on traffic, and costs 1 sol.

===By bus===
There are two terminals serving the city, Terminal Terrestre and Terminal Terrapuerto. They're next to each other, about 3km from the center.  A taxi should cost around 10 soles but prices are fixed based on distance.
You need a taxi to get to your hotel. Take taxis WITHIN the parking lot of the bus station. Those are registered official taxis. Express kidnappings have been reported with passengers taking taxis outside the bus stations. 
You can use buses/combis to get to/from the main bus terminal for 0.75 soles per person to Plaza de Armas; much cheaper than a taxi and still quite quick.
Usually Hotels do not organize pickups from the bus station because buses delay and their time of arrival is not exact. But you can ask your hotel to call a taxi for you when you arrive at the bus station. It will take no more than 20 minutes of waiting. 

From [[Lima]] (16-18 hours) it's advisable to take non-stop express buses &mdash; though more expensive, they tend to be safer.  Cruz del Sur, Oltursa and Excluciva are reputable companies with special tourist services. They leave from dedicated VIP terminals in Lima. Most express buses leave starting at 5 pm in order to get to Arequipa early morning. Its a night trip and has no view attraction. A special service from Cruz del Sur leaves at 9 pm and let you enjoy watchig the beautiful coast of Arequipa during the trip. Regular or local services stop too many times on the way and your risk of losing your luggage is very high. Avoid them. 

Peru Hop has buses to Arequipa, as well. Unlike other buses that provide a direct service, Peru Hop bus passes include stops where you can choose to hop off along the way to Arequipa. Their stops from Lima to Arequipa include Paracas, Huacachina and Nazca. Peru Hop offers free hotel and hostel pick-up and drop-off. 

From [[Cusco]] an option is Cruz del Sur Cruzero service. It's expensive but a night non stop express service with comfortable buses. You arrive to Arequipa very early, at 6-7 am. Be aware some hotels will not give you a room that early.

If you take a Peru Hop bus From Cusco to Arequipa you can choose to stop and hop off in Puno .They offer free hotel and hostel pick-up and drop-off. 

From [[Ica]] (12 hours). Cruz del Sur offers a night nonstop express service with comfortable seating. 
For [[Ica]] Andoriña bus was the cheapest (10 hours - 5 times a day) but it stopped too many times, the AC wasn't working and it was difficult to really sleep.

From [[Puno]] there are buses roughly hourly, taking about 6hours. Cruz del Sur daily service leaves at 3.30 pm. Some Expresso services are also available with 4M and Giardino Tours. If you are a group (4+) you can rent a charter. All the local companies providing regular cheap service have being reported as bad and unsafe for tourists. Julsa has been reported as the worst service available. 

From [[Nazca]], the cheapest bus option is Flores. From its office nearby the terminal in Nazca, there are buses leaving at 3.30pm and 10pm and costs S/. 50 (Nov 2015), and take anywhere between 8 to 10 hours. The bus originates in Lima so might not arrive on time in Nazca. There are numerous other bus companies (Civa, Cruz del Sur, Ormeño).

From [[Tacna]] or [[Chile]] the best option is Florez Hnos Super Dorado service leaving from Tacna National Bus Station. You better leave before night time. Its a 5 hour trip but because of customs procedures to avoid contraband, the bus can be delayed 1 to 3 hours. 

[[La Paz]] Ormeños has direct buses leaving at 1AM every day, passing through Puno at 6AM and arriving in La Paz at 12 midday.

===By train===
[https://www.perurail.com/trains/belmond-andean-explorer PeruRail] runs the luxury train, Belmond Andean Explorer, to [[Juliaca]] and [[Puno]] one time per week.

==Get around==

The city has a central urban area that can be explored on foot. The historic center is a 5 block area around the main square and is relatively easy to navigate with one of the many maps available at hotels or any information office. Some ancient districts like Yanahuara and Cayma are also within walking distance. Walking is safe within reason even at nighttime. Follow your hotel recommendations on which places NOT to go. 

The rural area is a whole attraction itself, with gorgeous terraces, Spanish mills, palaces and the ever-present view of the volcanoes from wherever you are. 

=== Bus Tours ===
One option for visiting most of the main tourist sights from the rural and urban areas is to take a bus tour. Tour buses are available at the main square and you can book the tour at your hotel or directly with the bus driver. In two or four hours, according to the tour you book, you will visit most of the famous viewpoints of the city. It is a great experience (from 6 to 10 dollars). 

=== Taxi ===

For safety, use cabs from taxi dispatch companies. Your hotel or the restaurant can call it for you. Avoid taking taxis that have stopped, waiting for passengers. A tip for taking a taxi is to take the one that you see a passenger leaving from. 
Prices are per ride. A ride from the main square to any place in the central district will be 4 - 7 soles. A ride from the bus station to any hotel is 10 soles (as of july 2015). From the airport, the price varies between  20-30 soles. Some cab drivers try to rip you off by saying prices are per head but price is always per ride for all passengers. Allow for a minor extra charge for luggage (usually half a sol per major piece).
There is also an option to rent a taxi per hour. Price:$6/hour. 
Please follow the advice of your hotel on reliable taxi companies. 

=== Public Transportation ===

Most of the attractions are within walking distance from the historic center. You can use buses/combis to get to/from the main bus terminal for 1 soles per person (as of january 2019); much cheaper than a taxi and still quite quick. Always be aware of your personal belongings and don't leave valuables unattended.
To catch a combi (minivan) from the main terminal, cross the brigde. Wait there for a minivan with a sign in the front saying different destinations, one of them Plaza de armas (eventually, the conducteur will say center). They will drop you at Av. La Marina, you have to go up to the bridge and walk for 3 cuatros to town. It will take around 15 minutes in total.

=== Car rental ===

Traffic in Arequipa is chaotic. It is not advisable to drive. If you drive to Arequipa, leave your vehicle in your hotel and enjoy the city on foot or using taxis. 

From 'Hertz' you can rent a Toyota Hilux for $90/day. The 4x4 they give you will be 5 years old and have been driven over 50,000km. Do not expect the car to be clean inside (insist on a discount for this) and expect your collection to take a minimum of 45 minutes.

==See==

[[Image:Arequipa_Plaza_de_Armas_-_July_2003.jpg|thumb|Plaza de Armas, Arequipa]]

* The '''Plaza de Armas''', the main square of Arequipa, surrounded by buildings made of ''sillar'', a white volcanic stone.

* Visit '''San Camilo Market''', the oldest one, located in the centre of the city. It's three blocks away from the main square. 

* See the Juanita Mummy in the '''Museo Santuarios Andinos'''. From May to November the main exhibit is the '''Dama de Ampato''', also known as '''Juanita'''. It is close to the main square. 

[[Image:Convento_santa_catalina_arequipa.jpg|right|thumb|Convento de Santa Catalina, Arequipa]]

* '''Convento de Santa Catalina''' is the most visited building from the Spanish era of the city. Described as a city within a city, this beautiful place with its colors, flowers and little streets will make you feel like you have traveled back in time. Quite close to the Plaza de Armas. 

* One of the newest attractions is the '''Convento de Santa Teresa''', a little off the usual tourist areas in downtown Arequipa. Not as interesting architecturally as the Convento de Santa Catalina, but some of the paintings and artifacts are stunning.

* Many of the almost 250 colonial buildings entitled as Human Heritage by UNESCO, are close to the main square. Some have been turned into banks, stores, restaurants and departments. This method of preserving the city by finding a practical use for the historical buildings, provides a great experience to the visitor who feels like visiting a living museum.

* Churches are among the most beautiful buildings preserved. They are all Catholic and you can visit them but be aware that they are used daily for worship so try not to be intrusive. La Compania, San Francisco, La Merced and the Cathedral are some of the most famous.

[[Image:Molino_sabandia.jpg|thumb|Molino de Sabandiá, Arequipa]]

* Arequipa has beautiful bridges. '''Puente Bolognesi''' is the closest to the main square. Go there and visit the Tambos (ancient houses rebuilt by the city government and used as apartments). Great experience and good views of El Misti and Chachani

* '''Puente Fierro''' is an iron bridge designed by Eiffel and still in service. A technological jewel located in Vallecito (10 blocks from main square) and a must for people who love trains and bridges. From the bridge, at golden time (4.00-5.00PM), you can get some of the best pictures from the volcanoes and the city. Worth the 15 minutes walk!

* Nearby, in the old countryside, is the '''Molino de Sabandía''' (Sabandía Mill), a three centuries old water mill, set in the old Arequipa countryside.

* Also to be found in the old countryside is the '''Mansión del Fundador''', a renovated centuries old Spanish Colonial mansion. Admission 10 S/, 5 S/ for students.

* '''Downhill volcano biking''' Offered in several levels of difficulty. Half day adventure managed by professional guides. S/70 to 80. They provide all the required equipment. Very safe. Great countryside views. 

* '''Volcano climbing''' Two volcanoes tower over the city: El Misti & Chachani. El Misti is the lower in elevation (5822m), but the harder climb. Trailhead is at 3,400m & the route up is very steep. No special equipment required, no snow or ice. It is possible to take a local bus towards Chiguata to the Asociación Irrigadora El Misti & walk the 6km to the trailhead from there - a 4WD is required to drive this track. Chachani is more difficult to reach, you need to rent a 4WD, but this will get you to 5,000m. There is ice on top, so crampons & an ice axe are advised. Altitude is usually the worst enemy for visitors. Chachani is over 6,000 meter in altitude, perhaps the easiest 6,000m peak in the world. Prices for guided tours are S/.200-300 for Misti & S/.350-450 for Chachani (january 2018).

* '''Whitewater rafting''' Arequipa has some of the best rivers of the world. A typical half-day tour with some 90 min actual rafting will cost you about 70 S/.

* '''Colca Canyon''' 3 hours bus drive away, is popular for seeing Andean Condors, hiking, and cultural activities. You can book a tour online, but if you book in central Arequipa it's 1/3 cheaper. All agents use the same few operators, so no need to shop around on anything other than price, but if you don't speak Spanish check that the guide will be presenting in English too; some present in Spanish and only speak English when asked a direct question. Think very carefully before visiting Colca Canyon in rainy season; unless you get a remarkably clear day the fog will take away 90% of the experience.
====Learn====

==Eat==

Local restaurants are called '''Picanterias'''. They are still very popular among locals. Some are within the urban area and some others on the outside of the city. There is a neighborhood called Arancota, where you can find many of this restaurants. Some of them are huge (600 tables or more) and they are usually full of locals. The main food attraction in this area is ''chicharron'' (fried pork with corn). Menu's are usually set, consisting of a hearty soup followed by a main dish. Drinks are often included. Prices are generally very cheap, varying from 5 S/ to 10 S/. Dishes at La Capitana range from 10 S/ (Almuerzo) to 31 S/ (Cuy, or guinea pig). Prices at La Palomina (and adjoining La Nueva Palomina) skyrockted as they have been included on guidebooks - do not expect a meal below 30 S/. The best time to eat at a Picanteria is between 12 pm and 3 pm. La Capitana is closed on Thursdays.

If you are looking for some '''good and cheap lunch''', have a look at the tiny restaurants in Calle Puente Bolognesi (Plaza de Armas towards Puente Bolognesi bridge). Set lunch (soup, choice of 2-4 main dishes and sometimes a dessert and/or drink) costs between 3,50 and 5,50 soles.

As with all Peruvian food: local delicacies are heavy and sometimes very hot. Try them with care, especially since the height of the city (around 2,300 meters) makes digestion slow. Take a '''mate de coca''', coca-leaf tea, after meals: it helps indigestion and makes the altitude more bearable.

Arequipa keeps one of the most '''varied''' and flavored '''cuisine cultures''' in the country. Robust, with long term cooking products and with soups as their main dish. Local food is usually served at lunch time but you can also find it in locals for tourists during dinner time. 

Spicy food is very popular. Locals use '''rocoto''' (''Capsicum pubescens'') to provide the spicy taste to their foods. This flavour is different than the spicy flavour you find in Indian or Mexican food.

Try  '''Rocoto relleno con pastel de papa''', a stuffed, quite large pepper with potato pie. Ask beforehand if it has been made for "tourists" or if it is the original, quite hot, style; if the last one, be careful, it can be extremely hot.

Try '''Alpaca steaks'''. This meat very low in fat is juicy and very soft. Presented in all the variations that beef is presented regularly. 

This city is the best place in Peru to eat '''river shrimps'''. They are presented in several ways, being the most popular '''Chupe de Camarones''', a thick soup very flavored and presented with many shrimps in it. Beware, plates here are big. 

Arequipa is only three hours away from the sea, so many fish restaurants are available. If you have not tried '''Ceviche''' in Peru yet, this is a great opportunity. There are also many other sea delicacies. 

There are a dozen local '''vegetarian''' restaurants around town, serving a large set lunch for less then S./10.

==Drink==

The typical Peruvian drink is Pisco. Arequipa is the craddle for the Acholado type, a Pisco comming from a mixture of several grapes. Locals drink it pure, in little sips. Chilcano is another way to drink it, Pisco with white soda. And of course, the [[Peru#Drink|Pisco Sour]], which is a must for any visitor. 

The local booze is Anis Najar. [[Peru#Drink|Chicha]] and [[Peru#Drink|Pisco Sour]] is also drunk.
 
Many bars and clubs for tourists are on '''Calle San Fransisco''', uphill from the main square. Many have happy hour specials until 10.00PM. 

There is an area of the city called '''Calle Dolores''', with discotheques, kareoke bars, and salsa ball rooms usually attended by locals but safe enough for travellers. The taxi is needed to get there.

==Stay safe==

All the [[Peru#Stay safe|usual advice]] given for Peru applies here as well. Arequipa feels like a somewhat safe city, and like in most of the other major Peruvian cities there is always a fairly large police presence. That said, don't unnecessarily flaunt your valuables or your money. Despite of this, there have been several robberies reported. DO NOT walk alone after 11.00PM in the downtown area!

In the downtown area, there is a fairly large presence of tourist police, wearing white shirts. Ask them for help. 

The most common form is when a foreigner takes a no-name cab and some corners later other people are picked up to rob the tourist. To be safe, don't just hail any old cab that passes by.  Always take branded taxis (of which you can see plenty).  Several of these branded taxis are very careful about the owners/drivers they take on.  Consequently, they are very reliable.  The best of these is the "Turismo Arequipa" company with a green and white logo (watch out for fakes).  "Taxitel" is also good.

The safest way to call a taxi is to ask your hotel or hostel to do it for you.  Almost all hostels and hotels have a relationship with a taxi company whose drivers are known and trusted. This holds for the rest of Peru as well.

Do not forget, that UBER is operating in Arequipa, and that is also a very safe alternative.

==Cope==

Motorycle and Car parts and repair are generally concentrated along Puente Arnao.  One inexpensive reapir option is Motocentro Arequipa at 337 Puente Arnao, but their customer service can be lacking at times and only comes in Spanish.

==Get out==

*  The [[Colca Canyon]]: It is possible to do it as a day trip that cost about US$20, the tour operator would pick you up from your hotel at 3:00 am to arrive at Chivay around 6:30 am, have a quick breakfast (included) and get to see the condors at the Colca Canyon at 8:00 am. Later, you'll take lunch (not incl.) at Chivay and stop at Patapampa viewpoint to take a few pictures. 
The other alternative is to stay one night in [[Chivay]] to have a slight chance to see the birds early in the morning, tours pick you up at 9:00 am and in the night you get to see a folklore dance show. Besides that is mostly the same and prices start at US$25 depending on the accommodations.

* [[Cuzco]]: There are many agencies offering bus trips from the main terminal to Cuzco. The price for the ~11h trip is 40 Pesos for a regular seat and 60 Pesos for a Cama bus (Sofa bed) (as of January 2019). If you leave around 8 pm, you will arrive in Cuzco around 7 am. It´s a very unpleasant trip the roads aren't in good conditions). Not all agencies have homepages, if you want to book your ticket in advance check the following: [http://sanmartin.com.pe San Martin], [http://excluciva.com.pe Excluciva], [https://www.cromotex.com.pe Cromotex]. There are many more, just ask around if you are at the terminal. If you arrive early, ask directly for more information, it´s busier in the afternoon.

* There are many travel agencies, but only a few tour operators without commissions. The best operators are '''Andina''' (Jerusalen 402A), '''Peru Schweiz Explorer''' for Colca Canyon Tours (around 150 Soles for a 3D/2N trip) '''Perou Voyage''' for private and customized tours to the Colca Canyon * [https://colcacanyontours-arequipa.com] and Quechua Explorer (Jerusalen 508) for hill climbing. For guided and unguided trips you can also contact '''Rafael Llosa''' (rllosach@gmail.com) 

* '''Chachani''' 6057 meters above sea level. Arrange transport with one of the adventure tour guides in town and be prepared for a 2-hour bumpy, swerving, scary drive around sharp curves up steep mountain roads. The base camp is over 5000 meters and the views are spectacular. If you are well-acclimated and have gear (ice axes and crampons) you should be able to summit from high camp in just over 8 hours. Otherwise just hike up the switchbacks to high camp (don´t stay there, you can´t sleep well at that altitude. Heed the mountaineer´s motto: "Hike high, Lie low") and then on to the col, from which you can see the beautiful view of Arequipa and surrounding mountains. The trek beyond can be dangerous if you´re not an experienced mountaineer. If you are, be prepared for a tough slog up dangerous scree and a treacherous traverse, and make sure you feel up to the return trip.

* '''El Misti''' 5822 meters above sea level. Is a 2 day climb there are a lot of agencies in Arequipa offering the climb for around $50 US. First night camps at approx 4600m so it gets very cold. You wake up at 1 AM to make the summit for sunrise. Not at all a technical climb, you can pretty much walk to the top. It helps to be acclimatized as you can get pretty breathless up there.

* '''Sogay Falls''' Located 20 km SE of Arequipa. Day tours cost around $25. As well as the waterfall (2 hours hike), you can see the Quequeña countryside and some stone glyphs. 

* '''Lake Salinas''' Located in the Salinas National Reserve, it's a major birdwatching location but you'll have to take a private tour. Right now its pretty easy to go there by yourself, take the bus from Av Sepulveda and it cost around 10S one way. <the bus leave pretty early around 6.30am and the journey takes about 3.5 hours. On the way back you can catch the bus from where you get off at around 4.30pm. No fees needed to enter the place.
