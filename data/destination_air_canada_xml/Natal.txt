{{pagebanner|Natal Banner.jpg}}
'''Natal''', the capital of [[Rio Grande do Norte]], [[Brazil]], is a city on the Atlantic coast. Natal has some great beaches, historical sites, and nature areas, and it is a frequently used base for exploring the paradisiac beaches and nature of the Rio Grande do Norte state.

== Districts ==

* '''South''': The most affluent area of the city and also where most tourists stay. Contains the Ponta Negra beach and most upscale hotels, shopping malls and restaurants
* '''East''': Contains the city's Historical Center, important sights such as ''Forte dos Reis Magos'' and ''Ponte de Todos'', and beaches that mix visitors and locals such as Praia do Meio and Praia dos Artistas. Also contains the entrance to ''Parque das Dunas''
* '''North''': An industrial/working-class area which is now the most populous of Natal. Contains the Redinha beach, which provides some nice views of the city and with very local feel
* '''West''': A mostly poor and in some parts run-down area, it contains the intercity bus terminal that can be used to reach other cities, like [[Tibau do Sul]]

==Understand==
Natal was founded on 25 December 1599, hence its name (''Natal'' means Christmas in Portuguese). Unlike other Northeastern capitals, it did not quite benefit from the economic boom resulting from the region's sugar cane production. Instead, it grew moderately and more organized, burgeoning on the state's cattle-raising activities and salt and oil extraction.

Nowadays Natal is one of the 8 most visited cities of Brazil. Unlike other large cities of the [[Northeast (Brazil) | Northeast of Brazil]], like [[Recife]] or [[Salvador]], Natal does not have a fascinating Historical Center or a vivid nightlife. In contrast, it is regarded as being significantly calmer and safer than other large cities in the region, and as having a superior quality of life. Many rich Brazilians and foreigners alike have summer houses in the city.

One of the primary reasons to visit Natal is to use it as a base to explore the wonderful state of Rio Grande do Norte, including beaches like Pipa, Baía Formosa, Barra do Cunhaú and Genipabu, and lakes like Carcará and Coca-Cola (See [#Get out]). The city has many lodging options and a couple of good and reasonably priced restaurants.

==Get in==
===By plane ===

The region is since the 31st of May 2014 served by the new Aeroporto Internacional de Natal (Governador Aluizio Alves), which was built to replace Augusto Severo International Airport. The airport is about 26 km from the downtown Natal. 
There are numerous direct flights from most important Brazilian capitals, including São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Recife, Fortaleza, Salvador, Belo Horizonte and Brasilia. 

* TAP[http://www.flytap.com/] flies directly to [[Lisbon]] several times a week.

To get to the city, take the ''Natal'' bus at the doorstep of the terminal, R$ 2,60. To get to ''Ponta Negra'', get off after about 15 minutes at ''Natal Shopping'' (look for the sign "VIA DIRETA SHOPPING"). This is one of the main connection points for buses, and there will usually be a big line of buses stopping off for different directions. If coming from the airport, cross the pedestrian bridge and take any bus with ''Ponta Negra'' in its name (e.g. 43, 56), another R$ 2.20. Buses come very frequently. In Ponta Negra, there are a few helpful stops. You know you are getting close when you see PRAIA SHOPPING, a small modern mall within walking distance of town center. That stop, or one near after, will be close to many of the hotels for tourists.

Natal's airport at São Gonçalo do Amarante is quite a haul, 35km west of Ponta Negra. Trampolím da Vitória runs a public bus that's hardly worth the hassle from Ponta Negra. You need to catch bus 46, 54 or 73 along Av Engenheiro Roberto Freire to Midway Mall (R$3.35, 45 minutes), then switch for the 'R' bus, which hems and haws its way to the airport (R$4.20, 1½ hrs, every 30 to 45 minutes from 5:10am to 11:30pm), passing the bus stop directly in front of the bus station exit along the way. From the airport, catch the 'R' just outside Arrivals. 

A taxi to ''Ponta Negra'' is approximately R$ 120 using the meter and takes about 45 minutes.

There are currently (June 2014) two companies providing minivan services, for prices as low as R$ 25 per person (R$ 55 for two people) and bring you to your hotel in Ponta Negra.

===By bus===
Natal's bus station is about 3 km southwest of the city center, and some 5 km northwest of the ''Ponta Negra'' beach. A taxi to the latter is about R$ 25. Bus No 66 does the same run in about 45 minutes.
* To [[Fortaleza]] 8 times daily (3 of these stopping in [[Mossoró]]) by ''Nordeste''[http://www.viacaonordeste.com.br/]. R$ 35-150, 8-10 hours. Also by ''Guanabara''[http://www.expressoguanabara.com.br].
* To [[Recife]] by Progresso[http://www.progressoonline.com.br/], R$ 42-60, 4.5 hours.
* To [[João Pessoa]] every hour.

==Get around==

===By car===

Renting a car may be convenient if you, as many  visitors, plan to use Natal as a base for day trips outside the city. Even the beaches at the neighboring municipalities of Parnamarim and Extremoz are complicated to reach using public transport. Typical prices are R$110 per day, or R$80 per day for multiple days. Often the car will be delivered to you at your hotel.

===By buggy===

You may explore the coast on the beach rather than a road, by hiring the service of a dune Buggy driver. It costs typically R$ 320 per vehicle or R$ 80 per person if you join a group. You may find cheaper services, but be aware of unlicensed drivers; accidents caused by unskilled Buggy drivers sometimes occur.

===By taxi or public transport===

* '''Taxis''': flag at R$ 4,15, per kilometer R$ 2,15 (rate 1) or R$ 3 (rate 2)
* '''Buses''': cost R$ 2,65 (nov 2015) and get very crowded at peak hours, schedule and routes very unreliable
* '''Urban trains''': very cheap (R$ 0,50), but unfortunately do not reach any major tourist sights

==See==

===Events===

===Other activities===
* <do name="Coastline travel" alt="" address="" directions="" lat="" long="" phone="" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">Hire a buggy with a driver and travel along the coast, both North and Southwards. The coast of the State of Rio Grande do Norte affords a rare combination of dunes, lagoons, sandstone cliffs, and vegetation in between. A driver (buggeiro) will pick you up at your hotel and head for the dunes. There will be a variety of stops for photos, and there is a local economy associated with the industry. In the middle of the dunes will be small artisan markets and bars, many of them fun and quite inexpensive. There are opportunities for zipping, sand boarding, swimming, and sipping from coconuts. Definitely wear a swimsuit and bring a towel to open up activities you can participate in. The ride will take at least half a day or nearly the entire day, depending on how much time you stay at stops. This is a popular and fun activity, catering heavily to the local tourists. For that reason, many buggy drivers do not speak English, although it is not hard to understand their suggestions regardless of language. Highly recommended throughout.</do>

==Stay safe==
If visiting the Forte dos Reis Magos, it's highly recommended that you take a taxi there, and not walk along Praia Forte; recently there have been an increasing number of robberies and assaults of tourists along the beach, past the populated areas (actually, one should not walk to the Forte because it is far away - about 3 km - from the nearest hotel or bus stop).

Ponta Negra beach and its boulevard are not secure either. Armed assault at populated beach can happen during day time. Do not take any valuable articles with you when you go to the beach. Furthermore, expect to be harrassed by taxi drivers trying to offer you a ride, homeless people hanging around on the boulevard or "drunk" people trying to bump into you.

Natal used to be the safest capital city of Brazil, but recent statistics [http://www.mapadaviolencia.org.br/] show that this is not true anymore. Yet Natal is still much safer than other touristic cities in the Northeast of Brazil, like Recife, Fortaleza and Salvador. Pick pockets follow the tourists, but violent assaults are rare. The city is conscious of the importance of tourism, which causes the Government to invest heavily on ostensive security of the busiest spots.

==Get out==
