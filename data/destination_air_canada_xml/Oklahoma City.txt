==Understand==

Oklahoma City is the largest city in the state, as well as its political, cultural, and economic engine. The city is the nation's third largest city in land area (608 sq miles), just behind Jacksonville FL (759 sq miles) and way behind Anchorage AK (1698 sq miles).  The city is the 29th largest city in population in the nation (506,132 in the 2000 census), and the largest city in the 5 "plains states" (Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, and North and South Dakota). After decades of suburban sprawl and an ill-fated downtown "urban renewal", a 'sudden' burst of investment in the 1990s has given the city additional big city attractions as well as a pleasant quality of life that often is the envy if not surprise of visitors from other cities, making Oklahoma City more of a tourist destination in and of itself. Oklahoma's state capitol building is the only capitol in the world with an oil well under it. Although its legal description is Capitol Site #1, it is referred to as Petunia #1 because it was originally drilled in the middle of a flower bed. 

===Geography===
[[Image:OklahomaStateCapital.JPG|thumb|480px|right|Oklahoma State Capital building]]
Oklahoma City is in the [[Frontier Country]] region of Central Oklahoma, in the [[Great Plains|Southern Plains]] of [[North America]]. Contrary to popular belief, the geography is not flat and treeless (like in the true high plains) but rather gently rolling hills covered in places by dense low trees, shrubs, and grasses. The city is roughly bisected by the North Canadian River (recently partially renamed the Oklahoma River in a flight of civic exuberance). The North Canadian is not very impressive as rivers go; it was once substantial enough to flood every year, wreaking destruction on surrounding homes, until the 1940s when the Civilian Conservation Corps dammed the river and turned it into essentially a wide ditch for the next 50 years. In the 1990's, as part of the citywide revitalization project known as MAPS, the city built a series of low water dams, returning water to the portion of the river flows near downtown. The city also has three large lakes, Lake Hefner and Lake Overholser, in the northwestern quarter of the city, and the largest - Lake Stanley Draper, in the sparsely populated far southeast of the city.

==Get in==

===By plane===
'''Will Rogers World Airport''' ({{IATA|OKC}}) [http://www.flyokc.com] offers over 180 flights a day including non-stop service to over 30 cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Atlanta, New York, and Washington DC. The International airport (originally built in the 1960s) has completed the first phase of a major expansion and modernization project and is attracting additional non-stop flights to the city.

===By train===
'''Amtrak''' offers daily service to and from [[Fort Worth]], Texas, aboard the Heartland Flyer [http://www.heartlandflyer.com] line, which can be boarded at the Santa Fe Station in Bricktown. The Flyer makes one trip per day, leaving in the morning and returning in the evening. Stops along the way are in [[Norman (Oklahoma)|Norman]], Purcell, [[Pauls Valley]], [[Ardmore]], and [[Gainesville (Texas)|Gainesville]]. In Fort Worth, passengers can transfer to the Texas Eagle, which runs daily between [[Chicago]] and [[San Antonio]].

===By car===
Oklahoma City is located at the intersection of two of the nations longest continuous interstate highways, I-40 and I-35, as well as I-44. It is also on historic [[Route 66]].

===By bus===
'''Greyhound''' [http://www.greyhound.com] has service to the Union bus station in downtown Oklahoma City, as well as the suburbs of [[Guthrie (Oklahoma)|Guthrie]], [[Edmond (Oklahoma)|Edmond]], [[Norman (Oklahoma)|Norman]], [[Shawnee]], [[Midwest City]], [[El Reno]], and the International Airport. '''Turimex  Internacional''' [http://www.turimex.com/en/] also runs a bus route from Oklahoma City into Mexico.

==Get around==
===By car===
Getting around Oklahoma City is easy by car. You will likely want to either rent a car or plan on staying around downtown because public transportation is rather limited.

The streets are laid out in a grid, with named streets running north and south and numbered streets running east and west. The main thing to remember when driving the city is that on the north side, the numbered streets increase from south to north, but on the south side, they increase from north to south. Be careful with getting the street names exactly right; NW 23rd Street is 4 mi from SW 23rd Street, so you do not want to get them confused. Aside from that minor issue, there are very few one-way street mazes or "Texas Turnarounds" to worry about, and the interstates in town are usually not congested, except during rush hour and construction.

===By streetcar===
The new Oklahoma City Streetcar system runs through the districts of the City Center, Midtown, Automobile Alley, and Bricktown. A 1-hour pass is $1 and a 24-hour pass is $3. [https://okcstreetcar.com/ Route map can be found here. ]

===By bus===
The local bus system is called Embark.[http://embarkok.com/] Their telephone number is 405-235-7433. The main hub is the Downtown Transit Center at 420 NW 5 St. The system offers service around downtown, the airport, and the cluster of museums and attractions in the northeastern part of the city. However, bus service is otherwise patchy. Please note that on weekends, the frequency is less on Saturdays, and the service does not run on Sundays. The cost is $1.75 for a single ride on most buses, $3.00 on express buses. One downtown route is $0.50 for a single ride. A 1-day pass is $4, and a 7-day pass is $14.

===By bicycle===
The city is reasonably bicycle-friendly in the Midtown areas of Oklahoma City because of the numerous low-traffic residential streets. A bike share service, Spokies [http://spokiesokc.com/], operates with eight pickup/drop-off locations around the downtown area. In other areas of the city, bicycle travel is more difficult because of high-traffic on the streets.

[[Image:OKCMemorial1.jpg|thumb|480px|right|Oklahoma City Memorial at sunrise]]

Many of the attractions are located near downtown or on the north side of town.  Highlights in downtown are [[Oklahoma_City/Bricktown|Bricktown]], the city's fast growing entertainment district and tourist showpiece, the new '''Oklahoma City Museum of Art''', home to the largest collection of Chihuly glass in the world as well as an arthouse/revival theater and a restaurant, and '''The Myriad Gardens''', an impressive urban park with a 7 story botanical garden. North of the museum is the '''Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum'''. The memorial is both one of the most visible attractions in the city as well as its saddest, which has posed some problems for the city's tourism department. The outdoor symbolic memorial is free and open 24 hours a day, while the very well done Memorial Museum (located in the former Journal Record Building next door) can be visited for a small fee.

Many of the neighborhoods in the immediate vicinity of Downtown are textbook examples of urban blight, but to the northwest of downtown is a cluster of interesting early 20th century neighborhoods near the campus of '''Oklahoma City University'''. The most notable are '''The Paseo''', a ramshackle artist colony located in a 1930s era urban neighborhood, and '''"Little Saigon"''' or as it's officially known, [[Oklahoma City/Asia District|Asia District]], home to the city's large Vietnamese and East Asian community. The Paseo was built in conscious imitation of Kansas City's Country Club Plaza in the early 20th century, but has since developed a gritty bohemian character that can feel like a breath of fresh air. Dozens of art galleries, restaurants, clothing stores and other related businesses are clustered in the area. Technically the Paseo is only comprised of a single street lined with deco Spanish revival buildings, but it has grown to encompass much of the surrounding neighborhood, including a stretch of storefronts on NW 23rd street, sort of the main street of the Northwest side.

West of The Paseo along Classen Boulevard is the [[Oklahoma City/Asia District|Asia District]], home to the city's majority Vietnamese Asian community. After the fall of Saigon in 1976, one of the cities picked by the US government for the relocation of refugees was Oklahoma City. Since then, these initial refugees have been joined by later immigrants from both Vietnam and other southeast Asian nations, as well as by Vietnamese Americans from elsewhere in the country. The district is home to many great restaurants, too numerous to mention, as well as '''Super Cao Nguyen Supermarket''', the largest Asian market in the state. 

Just West of Asia District is '''Oklahoma City University''' [http://www.okcu.edu] which features a small art museum and a variety of cultural events and programming.

To the North of Oklahoma City University is the '''"[[Oklahoma City/NW 39th Street Enclave|NW 39th Street Enclave]]"''' the largest GLBT neighborhood in the state, Crown Heights [http://www.ch-eh.org/] and the Western Avenue District, which are home to businesses and restaurants catering to young urbanites (Sushi Neko, a fine sushi bar and Will's, a coffee shop, both inside the restored art deco Will Rogers Theater complex, are worth a look). 

On the Northeast side of the city is the capitol complex, which is interesting in itself, and the '''Oklahoma History Center'''. There is a medical research cluster northeast of Downtown centered on the '''OU Health Science Center''' that is large and growing, but unless you're a patient, a doctor, or a scientist, you're unlikely to spend much time there. (However the historic '''Lincoln Terrace''' neighborhood that is between the OUHSC and the state capitol is worth looking at if you enjoy historic architecture.) The Harn Homestead is also located nearby on NE 16th street.

North of the capitol is the '''"[[Oklahoma City/Adventure District|Adventure District]]"''' with the highly ranked '''Oklahoma City Zoo''', the '''National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum''', and the '''Kirkpatrick Center''' (which features a children's science museum, an air and space museum, a photography museum and more), '''Remington Park and Casino''' a thoroughbred and quarter horse racing track with a Casino and off-track betting. 

The Southside is notable primarily for '''Capitol Hill''', a large Hispanic district, and the Stockyards, a neighborhood built around one of the largest cattle markets in the world. Cattle are still bought and sold there every Monday morning, much to the dismay of PETA and other local activists who can sometimes be spotted protesting nearby. The Stockyards resembles in some ways a wild west themed amusement park, ''sans'' rides. There are stores selling just about anything western themed that you could imagine, from saddles to belt buckles to truly giant hats. One of the few places in the city where your newly purchased giant hat will go mostly unremarked upon is the venerable '''Cattleman's Steakhouse''', which has been serving up hearty steaks and '''"lamb fries"''' (a polite term for fried bull testicles) for over a century.  

Capitol Hill to the east is one of the city's great contradictions; rife with poverty and violence, it can also be one of the liveliest and most welcoming neighborhoods in the city. Capitol Hill's main street along SW. 29th Street is full of bustling Mexican owned shops and restaurants, as well as the somewhat out of place seeming '''Oklahoma Opry'''.

==Stay safe==

A little bit of common sense goes a long way. On the whole, the city is quite safe, but you shouldn't take that as a cue to be careless. If you're downtown or in what looks like a sketchy neighborhood, nothing will probably happen to you, but you should still lock your car door, keep your valuables secure, and not put yourself in potentially dangerous situations. Some of the worst areas are in the inner-city districts just surrounding downtown, particularly parts of Mulligan Flats (SE-SW 15th Between I-35 and Western), NE 23rd St., NE 36th Street, Martin Luther King Boulevard, NW 10th Street, South Central Avenue, South Shields Boulevard, and South Robinson Avenue; you might want to avoid being there after sundown. Also steer clear of particularly seedy-looking bars, although not all are created equal. Keep your wits about you and you'll be fine almost anywhere in Oklahoma City.

You might want to check the [[Tornado safety]] page if you are visiting Oklahoma City, as it sits in the heart of "Tornado Alley" but the local media are always all over any developing severe weather. Peak tornado season is in the spring, with April and May being the months with the most severe storms.
Summertime heat is also a concern, as average high temperatures during July and August are typically in the mid 90s though humidity levels are usually not as high as parts of the adjacent deep south. Temperatures over 100 are also very common during the summer months, but all businesses are air conditioned, as well as hotel rooms and other public places. While snow is not uncommon in the winter, it typically falls only a few times and in small amounts, but be advised just a few inches of snow can be enough to cause much more havoc than in more northern locations...drive safely!

It should be noted that people can carry firearms openly or concealed without permits in Oklahoma, though restrictions to government buildings, banks, and bars may apply.

==Get out==
*[[Norman (Oklahoma)|Norman]] Is a short drive south of downtown Oklahoma City is its largest suburb and the home of '''University of Oklahoma'''.[http://www.ou.edu/] The university is the primary attraction in Norman, with a beautifully landscaped Victorian campus and several fine museums, including the '''Sam Noble Museum of Natural History''' [http://www.snomnh.ou.edu/] and the '''Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art'''[http://www.ou.edu/fjjma/]. [[Norman (Oklahoma)|Norman]] is also significant for its leading role in meteorology (Doppler radar, the basis of modern weather prediction was invented there) as evidenced by the National Weather Center, which offers tours. North of the university is Campus Corner, a dense conglomeration of bars, music venues, restaurants, and retail catering to the college crowd. For those with less disposable income, cheaper bars, music venues, restaurants and retail can be found further north in Norman's small Downtown Core along Main Street.

*[[Edmond (Oklahoma)|Edmond]] Is a rather affluent suburb due North of Oklahoma City. It has some great qualities, including nice restaurants, the third largest university in the state '''University of Central Oklahoma''' [http://www.ucok.edu] and some quaint, quiet neighborhoods near its uniquely successful downtown business district.
