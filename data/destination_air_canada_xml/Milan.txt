[http://www.milanoinfotourist.com/home.htm '''Milan'''] ([[Italian phrasebook|Italian]]: ''Milano'') is financially the first most important city in [[Italy]]. It has the most populous city proper in the country, but sits at the centre of Italy's largest urban and metropolitan area. While incorrectly not considered as beautiful as some Italian cities, having been partly destroyed by Second World War bomb raids, the city has rebuilt itself into a thriving cosmopolitan business capital. In essence, for a tourist, what makes Milan interesting compared to other places is that the city is truly more about the lifestyle of enjoying worldly pleasures: a paradise for shopping, football, opera, and nightlife. Milan remains the marketplace for Italian fashion – fashion aficionados, supermodels and international paparazzi descend upon the city twice a year for its spring and autumn fairs. Don't get fooled by the modern aspect of the city, since it's one of the most ancient cities in Europe with more than 26 centuries of history and heritage!

Milan is famous for its wealth of historical and modern sights - the Duomo, one of the biggest and grandest Gothic cathedrals in the world, La Scala, one of the best established opera houses in the globe, the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele, an ancient and glamorous arcaded shopping gallery, the Brera art gallery, with some of the finest artistic works in Europe, the Pirelli tower, a majestic example of 1960s modernist Italian architecture, the San Siro, a huge and famed stadium, or the Castello Sforzesco, a grand medieval castle and the UNESCO's World Heritage Site Santa Maria delle Grazie Basilica, containing one of the world's most famous paintings: Leonardo da Vinci's ''The Last Supper''. If you plan to visit it reserve a ticket online, as it is sold out for several months.

==Understand==
[[Image:Duomo by night.jpg|thumb|The Duomo di Milano, the city's stunning Gothic cathedral]]
If [[Rome]] represents the "old" Italy, Milan represents the "new" Italy. Milan is the most modern of all Italian cities, and it still keeps most of its past history intact. 

At first sight, Milan looks like a bustling and relatively stylish (with its shiny display windows and elegant shops) metropolis, with a good number of grand palaces and fine churches in the centre, but might seem like a slightly prosaic, soulless and business-orientated place. It can be quite rainy, grey and foggy, and some of the buildings, ancient or modern, have quite a severe appearance. Whilst there are a lot of parks, Milan looks as if it has very little greenery, and apart from the very well-kept historic part, some outlying areas are a bit scruffy. However, Milan, unlike most usually historical European cities which throw the sights in your face, requires quite a lot of exploring - take it as it is, and you might enjoy its fashionable glitter and business-like modernity, but might find it not very "captivating". If you spend time, though, strolling through areas such as the pretty Navigli, the chic Brera district, the lively University quarter, or some of the smaller churches and buildings, you'll find a forward thinking, diverse city filled in every corner with history, and with a plethora of hidden gems. Plus, with such an established history in theatre, music, literature, sport, art and fashion, there's really not much you can miss. 

Milan, as many have noticed, doesn't fully feel like a part of Italy. Despite the similarities between typical Italian cities such as [[Verona]] or [[Venice]] with the city, it does have a different atmosphere. Milan feels more like a bustling, busy, fashionable business capital - where in several cafes, lots of people only stop to have a quick espresso at the bar counter, and where tourists at times seem more laid back than the locals. Milan, unlike the traditionally red-terracotta roofed Italian cities, is quite grey, as many buildings are constructed using limestone or dark stones. Ancient buildings mainly have a sort of Austrian/Germanic neoclassical look with some slight French influences. However, with some cycling around in old fashioned bicycles, restaurant chairs and tables outside at summer filled with locals and tourists alike, and people strolling down the pedestrian avenues, licking an ice cream or carrying some heavy shopping bags, Milan does boast some "Italian flair".

These differences between Rome and Milan are evident from several proverbs, such as an Italian saying about the differences of the two cities which roughly translates,'' "Rome is a voluptuous woman whose gifts are very apparent, while Milan is the shy, demure girl whose treasures are plentiful, but discovered in time."''

===When to visit===
[[Image:Leonardo_da_Vinci_%281452-1519%29_-_The_Last_Supper_%281495-1498%29.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Leonardo da Vinci's greatest masterpiece, the Last Supper, Milan]]
Milan, depending on how you want to tour the city, is a rewarding visit all the year. Keep in mind most places, including tourist destinations and museums, are closed on Mondays. 

In autumn, the weather is warm/cool, and in later months can be quite rainy and foggy. At this time of the year, the city's inhabitants are very busy with work, so the only people you're likely to see wandering around are tourists. All the major venues and shops are open, since it is the working part of the year. 

In winter, the city can become cold (often below or around zero degrees centigrade), and the weather is usually foggy and rainy if not snowy. However, the city, in the few weeks before Christmas, becomes delightful to visit - the main sights are all illuminated by stunning lights, a huge Christmas tree is set up in front of the Duomo, vendors and markets can be found everywhere, many shop and display windows are decorated and the streets become bustling with locals and tourists alike. However, the only downside is that it can become extremely crowded, noisy and busy.

In spring, the weather is similar to that of autumn. People go back to work, and the atmosphere becomes more quiet, yet serious unlike that of the winter. Parks become nice to visit, as trees blossom. The city is also quite nice to visit at Carnival, where people dress up and celebrate, and during Easter, where there are special services held in churches and some special events.

In summer, Milan can become extremely hot and humid, with the odd powerful rainstorm here and there. Whilst in July, apart from the weather, most shops remain open, in August, as many locals go off to take their summer holidays, many businesses and venues shut down (with the notice '''Chiuso per ferie''', or shut down for vacation). The city may become quite empty with the odd tourist strolling around, and with several of the main sights shut down. Despite it not being the best time for shopping and the weather's not at all times very pleasant, it's good if you want to enjoy the city to yourself when it's quiet, and maybe want to stroll around, sipping at the odd open bar or at an ice cream, or walking in a silent park. This has begun to change in recent years, and though many businesses still shut down for a week or two in August, many larger ones now remain open.

==Get in==

===By plane===
Milan has two main international air gateways, '''Linate''' airport and '''Malpensa''' airport. Sometimes referred to as Milan's additional airports, Bergamo's [http://www.bergamo-airport.com '''Orio al Serio''' airport] (45km East) and '''Parma''' airport (100km South) mostly host budget airlines.
 
====Malpensa airport====
The main international airport is [http://www.malpensa-airport.info/ '''Malpensa'''] (Milan Malpensa, {{IATA|MXP}}). It's a large, modern, two-runway airport. The airport has two terminals, with Terminal 1 being the largest (international and intercontinental flights). Terminal 2 is the biggest continental base for Easyjet, which is the only carrier in the terminal, and it has grown consistently in the last few years. 

The two terminals are connected by a free shuttle bus service (running approximately every 20 minutes). However, such shuttles are very small and the frequency is inadequate: long queues tend to form, which prompts several taxi drivers to station right next to the stop and pick up those passengers who don't want to or can't afford to wait. It is not uncommon for passengers to wait up to 40-45 minutes for the transfers: most shuttles are packed, forcing passengers to wait for the next one.  

*[http://www.malpensaexpress.it/en/ '''Malpensa Express Trains''']. This is the only frequent railway link between Malpensa and central Milan. From December 2010 trains connect Malpensa airport terminal 1 to both Milano Cadorna and Milano Centrale.

** '''The Malpensa Express Trains between Malpensa and Milano Cadorna''' is recommended as the easiest and fastest connection if you travel from Malpensa airport to the city centre (or vice versa), though it may be crowded at rush hours.  Trains to Milano Cadorna leave every 30 min from Terminal 1 and 2, arriving at Milan's Cadorna train station in less than 40 min (the Cadorna station is connected to Milan's subway network, at the intersection of the red M1 and green M2 lines). All trains stop at intermediate stations (usually Busto Arsizio, Saronno, Milano Bovisa). For full timetable see [http://www.trenord.it/media/1678336/mxp_milano-malpensa.pdf] The last train departs at approximately 11:20PM, so if you arrive on a late flight or are delayed then you will need to take a bus or taxi. (see below) After the last train there are both buses that connect to Milan Cadorna station and buses that connect to Milan Central station (for bus to Milan Central station see below).
** Fare: one-way €13, round trip €20 (to be carried out during the day if purchased at the ticket office, vending and in kiosks affiliated distributors; within 30 days if purchased online or via App Trenord). A new offer allows a family (or group) up to 2 adult and 2 children (up to 18 year old) to travel one-way for €25. Your ticket must be bought and validated in the station before boarding. It isn't possible anymore to buy tickets on board. The only option for a passenger without a ticket is to contact a ticket inspector when boarding or immediately after boarding (a surcharge of €5 will be added to the cost of a full rate single ticket in this case) You can buy tickets from [http://www.trenord.it/it/media-news/notizie/malpensa-t2-con-trenord.aspx] or from the self-service ticket machines at Cadorna Station.

** '''The Malpensa Express Trains between Malpensa and Milano Centrale''' connect Malpensa airport to Milano Centrale. These trains also connect to  Milano Bovisa and Milano Porta Garibaldi. There are 2 trains each hour. These trains stop at Milano Bovisa, Milano Porta Garibaldi and Milano Centrale. Some trains also stop at Busto Arsizio, Saronno, and some trains also stop at some intermediate stations. Running time varies. You can buy tickets from [http://www.trenord.it] or from the self-service ticket machine located at the beginning of platform 3 in Centrale railway station.

** Train-bus combination. The frugal and those living north of Milan can take a regional train from Milano centrale or other stations to Gallarate (€4.80 from Milano Centrale to Gallarate) and then from Gallarate a local bus to Malpensa that runs every hour or two [https://www.airpullman.com/static/upload/ora/orari-gall-mxp-castel--dal-01-03-14.pdf] to Malpensa for about €2. 

*'''Buses''' leave approximately every 20min for Centrale Station and Linate airport, costing about €10 and €13, respectively. Travel can take from 40 minutes (weekends) to 1 hour or more (during weekday mornings).

**From Malpensa Airport Terminal 2 directly to Milan, there are a number of stands for various bus companies. One tried-and-tested service is called '''Malpensa Shuttle'''. Buy your ticket at the stand in arrivals (card accepted) before boarding the gaudily coloured bus in the car park. There are 2-3 buses per hour, and the bus terminates next to the taxi rank by the east entrance of Milano Centrale. A single costs €10, or you can ask for a return ticket for €16. For the journey from Centrale to Malpensa, there is a ticket stand near the east exit of Centrale, and the bus is boarded at the adjacent bus stops.

* Using a '''taxi''' to get from Malpensa to the city center is expensive: €90 (fixed fee for a City-Airport trip, without further stops). Only taxis registered in Milan itself have signed up to the fixed fee agreement - taxis from outlying cities (which you will also find at Malpensa) have not signed on to the agreement, will still take you to Milan but will charge you the meter reading (generally €80+ in light traffic). If upon entering a taxi you do not see a card on the window or rear of the driver/passenger seats, then you are in a non-Milanese taxi. You can request the fixed fee if the driver refuses, then take the next taxi in the rank. You may find that if you take the fixed fee from a non-Milanese taxi then they take a slower non-toll road rather than the toll paying motorway (tolls are ALWAYS paid by the driver so are included in the meter or fixed fee). 

* Avis and other [https://www.aiguarentacar.it car hire] firms are available at Milan airport Terminal 1. 

* You can reach Milan by Trenitalia trains departing from Gallarate train station. A bus service is available from Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 to Gallarate.

====Linate airport====
Some European or national flights arrive at '''Linate Airport''' ({{IATA|LIN}}). This small but rather efficient one-runway airport is very close to the city centre (7 km). It is mostly serviced by airlines to domestic destinations and some European destinations. After the bankruptcy of the 'old' Alitalia and its merger with AirOne, the new airline abandoned Malpensa in favour of Linate.

* Taking connecting flights in Linate might take  much longer than elsewhere because there is no through passage: you get off the airplane, get out of the security area, go through security again together with those passengers who have just arrived from Milan and not with a connecting flight, and only then can you board the new plane. If you're taking a connection from abroad it doesn't make much difference, because in these cases you have to go through security again (say, London to Palermo via Rome Fiumicino), but if both flights are domestic then you don't have to go through security again if the airport has a through passage (e.g. Palermo to Genova via Rome Fiumicino). This is common in most countries: the rationale is that apparently no one seems to trust security checks performed by other countries! 

* Since the airport is so close to the city, it is served by the newly-built metro line '''M4''' (blue). The metro is managed by ATM [http://www.atm-mi.it], the public transport company of Milan. Tickets can be purchased from the newsagent inside the airport terminal or by the ATM vending machines close to the bus stop. With the same ticket, you can transfer to other metro (subway) system once and unlimited buses or trams in a 90 minute period. You can also directly use a comprehensive ticket to many places in the suburbs. For more detail see [[#Get around]]. Information and timetables available from the ATM web site. On the other direction, when going from the city centre to Linate airport, you can take the same metro line heading Linate. During daytime the frequency of the metro is one bus every 5 to 10 minutes.

* A new express service '''Bus no. X73''', connect the Linate airport and San Babila Square, in the city centre and vice versa, via a route similar to the bus 73, but with just one intermediate stop (at Dateo, where interchange with the ''Passante Ferroviario'' is possible). As it is a direct service it takes less time than the normal 73 bus and it is usually less crowded. The advertised journey time is 25 (but take into account more time than this, especially if you are travelling in peak time).  This express service operates only weekdays 7AM-8PM and there is an express bus every 20 minutes. The ordinary ticket of €2 is accepted on this route, no supplement is needed, and you can transfer to the metro (subway) system and other bus (for more details about tickets see above and the Get around section).

* A '''dedicated bus service''', called "Starfly", operated daily 06:00 to 23:30 by Autostradale, connects Linate airport to Milan central station running approximately every 30 minutes and tickets cost €5 per adult (ticket sold at local newsagent and on board). This bus also stops on route at Lambrate railway station. The journey takes approximately 27 min. [http://www.autostradale.it/interna.aspx?gr=2&sez=60&sot=2&ae=8] [http://www.atm-mi.it/en/AltriServizi/Trasporto/Pages/airbus.aspx]

* A bus service, operated by '''Malpensa Shuttle''' [http://www.malpensashuttle.it/] connects Malpensa airport to Linate airport as well as Malpensa to Milan's Central train station (timetables, fares and ticket booking available online). The journey takes 30-60 min, depending on traffic conditions. 

*'''Taxis''' from Linate to the city centre cost around €12-20 depending on traffic conditions. The minimum charge is €12. If you are going to the centre, ignore all the guys standing at the exit to the terminal saying "taxi"... they are for destinations outside central Milan (ie, outlying cities) and will charge a minimum of €70. Queues for regular taxis can get long during peak commuter hours (early evening) and are particularly bad during Fashion Week.

====Orio al Serio airport (Bergamo)====
Some budget airlines fly into '''Orio al Serio Airport''' ({{IATA|BGY}}) [http://www.orioaeroporto.it/]. About 45km north-east of Milan near the city of [[Bergamo]].  Ryanair refers to this as '''Milan Bergamo Airport'''. Public transport into Milan is slightly less convenient than Malpensa or Linate:

* '''Trains to Milan''' leave from [[Bergamo]] station, which you can get to by shuttle bus or taxi, but is quite far from the airport. Buses to Bergamo are run by ZANI and take 10 minutes, at a cost of around €1.50. Trains from Bergamo to Milan run every 30-60 minutes and take around 1 hour. Adult one-way fare approx €5.5.

*'''Bus Services''' &mdash; All buses leave for Milan from immediately outside the arrivals section of the airport and from Ferrante Aporti on the east side of Central Station in Milan for all the companies below.

** Autostradale run a direct bus [http://www.autostradale.it/] from Orio Airport to Milano Centrale station, which is probably the best choice. Departure times may vary, but buses generally run every half hour during the day, less often at night, and take about 1 hour or more. However, beware of cutting things too fine, because the highway to Milan is very crowded during weekdays. Adult one-way fare: 10.00. Tickets are sold in Orio Al Serio Airport in Bergamo and at the Central Train Station in Milan. Be at the Milan Bus stop at least 15 minutes before nominal departure time, or you may get left behind. Tickets can be purchased online, but sellers at the airport and train station will offer 3 tickets for price of 2.

** Zani Viaggi [http://www.zaniviaggi.it] also run a bus service from Bergamo Airport to Milano Centrale station with a stop at the Cascina Gobba MM2 station on the North Eastern outskirts of Milan. Adult fare: €9ish one way.  Tickets sold at an office in the airport or online.

** There are several other bus shuttle companies, e.g. Orio shuttle [http://www.orioshuttle.com/_eng/] that offer direct bus services from Bergamo airport to Milan central, Malpensa and Linate airport. It is advisable to not buy the bus tickets online beforehand, because then the passenger has no choice but to wait for the bus the he/she has booked. Once you get out of the customs area, there are a lot of kiosks and agents, who will offer bus tickets to city center for € 10 one-way, (€0.20 /km one wonders if the companies are fixing prices or have friends in the local governments. )This gives flexibility to choose the first departing bus, instead of waiting at the airport.

*'''Taxis''' will set you back maybe €100 from Orio to Milan.

===By train===
[[Image:Milan_railway_station.JPG|thumb|Central railway station]]
* The main railway station is the '''Central Station''' ('Milano Centrale')[http://www.milano-centrale.com/], which is served by '''Trenitalia''' [http://www.trenitalia.it/], the State Railways. Regular express and fast trains serve all Italian cities ([[Turin]], [[Venice]], [[Rome]], [[Naples]], [[Florence]] and many others), and some European cities ([[Barcelona]], [[Zurich]], [[Geneva]], [[Munich]], [[Paris]], [[Stuttgart]], [[Vienna]], etc.).

The station building is in itself worth a visit being a masterpiece of rationalist architecture.

The station area is not in a great part of town at night, though in the area there are a number of decent budget hotels (see "Sleep" below) and some business-oriented international brand hotels. In general the area south of the station (characterized by a few skyscrapers) is a business and local government center, pretty active during working hours but almost deserted at night. Should you need a few supplies for your trip, there is a supermarket in the west side of the station in the basement, as well as cafes and other small shops. Internet points in the main square overlooking the station. In 2008 the station is completing extensive renovation. At night, parts of the Central Station become a sleeping area for vagrants. Usually around the station there are children aggressively targeting tourist for pickpocketing, so pay attention to your bag. 

The Central Station is served by '''MM2''' and '''MM3''' metro lines. Taxis stops directly in front of the station (on the sides during the renovation period), and ATM buses on the West side (IV November Square) and buses to Linate, Malpensa and Orio airports on the East side (Luigi di Savoia square).

* Another important railway station is '''Cadorna''', served by '''Ferrovie Nord''' [http://www.fnmgroup.it/] (North Railways), where the Malpensa airport Express stops and which is also a stop for MM1 and MM2 metro lines. This is a good station if you are travelling to Como Lago station

* '''Garibaldi station''' is the terminus for most commuter railway lines and is served by the state railways. It is also the station served by TGV trains to and from Paris, operated by SNCF. It is also a stop for the MM2 metro and for the '''Passante''' suburban commuter train link (see [[#Get_around]]). Garibaldi station is divided into three parts - terminating platforms, through platforms, and the underground 'passante' platforms - and can be quite confusing to get around, so allow extra time for changing here.

* Other main train stations are ''Lambrate'' (connected to MM2 metro line), ''Greco-Pirelli'', ''Rogoredo'' (connected to MM3 metro line) and ''Porta Genova'' (connected to MM2 metro line) for the FS Trenitalia railways and ''Bovisa'' (connected to the ''Passante'' suburban commuter train link) and ''Domodossola'' for the Ferrovie Nord railways. Domodossola station is very close to the city section of the Milan Exhibition Centre - ''fieramilanocity'', also connected to the subway system by the MM1 metro line.

Although Ferrovie Nord (FNM) and Trenitalia (FS) are historically two separate railway networks, all railway tickets (except for some commuters' season passes) are valid on both of them, so you needn't worry about getting the wrong ticket!

===By car===
The main motorways linking Milan to the rest of Italy are:

* '''A1''', the '''Autostrada del Sole''' (Highway of the Sun), a six-lane motorway linking Milan to [[Bologna]], [[Florence]], [[Rome]] and [[Naples]].
* '''A4''' Westbound, a six-lane motorway linking Milan to [[Turin]], the Western Alps and France.
* '''A4''' Eastbound, the '''Autostrada Serenissima''', an eight-lane motorway linking Milan to [[Bergamo]], [[Brescia]], [[Verona]], [[Padua]] and [[Venice]], and further to [[Trieste]] and [[Slovenia]].
* '''A7''', a six-lane motorway linking Milan to [[Genoa]], the Ligurian Riviera and the Cinque terre.
* '''A8''', the '''Autostrada dei Laghi''' (Highway of the Lakes), an eight-lane motorway linking Milan to Lake [[Como]], Lake Maggiore, [[Lugano]] and the rest of [[Switzerland]].
* '''A9''', a four-lane motorway linking Milan to [[Varese]] and Western [[Ticino]] in [[Switzerland]].
* '''A50''', '''A51''' and '''A52''', respectively the West, East and North Ringroads (''Tangenziale Ovest'', ''Tangenziale Est'', and ''Tangenziale Nord'') connect the various motorways forming a six-lane ringroad around Milan.
* '''A53''', a four-lane motorway linking Milan to [[Pavia]]. 

The main highway operating company is Società Autostrade per l'Italia [http://www.autostrade.it/].

Because of heavy traffic, it is strongly recommended not to drive in Milan during working days. Driving is much better during weekends. A recommendation is to leave your car in one of the well-marked, huge '''commuter car parks''' near several exits of Milan's motorway ringroad; they're managed by ATM and are easily connected with Milan's underground metro lines, but they close around midnight. They're near highway exits in Cascina Gobba (East), Lampugnano (North West), Molino Dorino (North West), Bonola (North West), Rho-Pero (North West), Bisceglie (South West), San Donato (South East), and Famagosta (South). If you must drive in Milan during weekdays, then make sure you have an up-to-date map showing the one-way system.

'''Traffic congestion fee''' - Since January 1 2008, cars entering Milan's central area within the former walls of the city (''cerchia dei navigli'') must pay a fee (€2,€3, €5 or €10 depending on the engine and age of the car): there are cameras in all entrances to this area and all registration plates are recorded. Payment can be made by purchasing entrance cards at newspaper stands, online or by sms (call 020202 for information). Failure to pay within 48 hours from entering the area implies a fine of €75.

===By bus===
Lampugnano coach station is Milan's main bus terminal. From here, you can take the MM1 (red underground line) to the centre or to the exhibition centre at Rho-Fiera.

The main national bus lines are operated by Autostradale [http://www.autostradale.it/], but there are many other small companies offering even international travel [http://ibus.it/english/index_en.htm].

==Get around==
[[Image:Milan_metropolitana.JPG|thumb|Milan metro]]

[http://www.atm-mi.it/ Azienda Trasporti Milanesi S.p.A.] ('''ATM''') operates a public transport network which is pretty efficient (especially the underground lines and the trams (streetcars)). Single tickets cost €2 and are available from automatic ticket machines in metro stations. 24 hr tickets cost €7,  3-days €12 (as of Aug 2019), as well as a "carnet" of 10 single trips for €18. Unfortunately unlike in Barcelona and Paris, the carnet is no longer transferable. 

You must have a valid ticket before boarding a bus or tram. Tickets are not sold on board and you will not find a self-service ticket machine at bus and tram stop. You need to buy a valid ticket from one of the places listed above. Single tickets are valid for 90 min, during which you can use them on as many trams and buses as you like, for one metro ride and for one ride on the urban part of  a suburban train. Your time starts once you validate it by inserting it into a box which prints the date and time on it. These are found inside trams and buses and at the turnstiles at the metro. If you've first used a single ticket on a bus or tram, you must also validate it when you enter the metro or before taking the urban part of the suburban train. There still exists three different types of ticket machines on trams and buses. To validate the new-style paper with magnetic strip tickets (these should be the only ones that you will ever be sold) you need to use the orange and yellow machines. If you have a new magnetic credit-card type ticket, you should validate it every time you board on a new bus or a tram as well.

===By Metro===
The [https://www.atm.it/en/ Metro] (short for Metropolitana) has a big white '''M''' on a red background as a logo and has four lines, each commonly identified by a colour as shown below, and is the best way to get around Milan. The lines are: MM1, red (''rossa''); MM2, green (''verde''); MM3, yellow (''gialla''); MM4, blue (''blu''); MM5, violet (''lilla''). The subway network is rather extended (lines split into different sections and its 103 stations cover most areas of town). Trains run every 1-3 min, 06:00-23:59 (02:00 on Saturday nights).

Ticket machines at the more important metro stations will often have beggars standing around them, offering to 'help you' buy a ticket. If you accept their help, they will harass you for a tip or simply steal your change as it comes out of the machine.

===By tram===
[[Image:Tram Carrello.jpg|thumb|One of the city's easily recognisable orange tramcars.]]
(Streetcars) run above-ground on rail lines running through the streets. Milan is par excellence the city of trams, and it's the second city in the world for tramway lines extension. They're everywhere, and they are a true symbol of Milan, just like red double decker bus is for London. Being above ground means you get a view of what you're passing, so if you don't need to go far, they're convenient and fun. Some tram lines are operated by the ultramodern 'jumbo' green tram, others are run by yellow or orange antique traditional carriages (similar to the ones in San Francisco) with wooden panelling inside and glass chandeliers. There is also a restaurant tram and a party tram with disco music. Many tram stops have electronic information panels with indications on how many minutes to wait before the next available service. These are known as trams and an Italian (or non-American foreigner for that matter) will have no idea what you are talking about if you ask them where to find a 'streetcar'. Many trams are really museum pieces, which makes of Milan a sort of an open air transportation museum. The most important historical trams are the "serie 1500" type, dating back as far as 1929! They survived even to the WWII bombings and are still now in perfect conditions. Since their historical value, no retirement option is even considered for these tram types.

===By bus===
Buses should probably be your third public transport option. Equally comfortable, rather punctual and clean with many routes to choose from. ATM tram and bus services stop around 02:00. However, some lines end their service earlier and some do not have a night service at all. In any case check your route and timetable in advance if you want to travel late at night. 

Several buses connect suburban cities and towns surrounding Milan. Some are managed by ATM. You can travel on most of them with an inter-urban ticket (biglietto interurbano) which are sold in two forms: including travel in Milan or without. In the ''without'' form you can only go to the end of the line, while with the cumulative version you can transfer to any ATM line. There are several rules and distance limits which apply, so be aware of them when you purchase your ticket.

Many bus stops have electronic information panels with indications on how many minutes to wait before the next available service. 

The Radiobus service has been cancelled and replaced by 'Radiobus di Quartiere', active between 10PM and 2AM every night. These buses pick you up from the terminus (usually a metro stop) and deliver you to any stop in a certain area of town. See here [http://www.atm.it/en/ViaggiaConNoi/Radiobus/Pages/Radiobus.aspx] for more details.

===By train===
The '''Suburban Railway System''' or '''S-lines''' (the logo is a big green '''S''' on a blue background) includes a special line known as '''Passante ferroviario''' (railway link), considered Milan's fourth subway line (although trains run every 6-15 mins), and has eight more lines, each identified by a number (S1, S2, S5, S6, S10 trough Passante Ferroviario and S3, S4, S8, S9, S11 trough other railways), connecting metro area towns with Milan.  Suburban trains run less often than Metro trains (depending on the line, they range from 1 to 4 per hour) but, as some lines share tracks and stations, you can expect as many as 10 trains per hour in central Milan between Lancetti and Porta Vittoria stations. Suburban Railway 'S' Lines are usually marked in blue on subway maps. The Passante is not heavily used by the Milanese and in non-peak hours stations can be deserted so would not be recommended for lone (and particularly female) travellers.

===By taxi===
Taxis can be expensive and drivers are allowed to pick passengers up from designated taxi ranks, through phone bookings and directly from the  street. The main taxi companies can be reached at 02.40.40, 02.69.69 or 02.80.80, or alternatively, from a land line dial 848.814.781 to be connected to the nearest taxi stand. If you book a taxi by phone you'll start paying from the moment the driver accepts the call and comes to pick you up. Local law define some fixed fee trips: Milan to Malpensa Airport €70, Malpensa Airport-Rho Fair €55, Malpensa Airport-Linate Airport €85, Linate Airport-Milan Fair €40. All fees are intended for a one-way, non-stop trip; taxi waiting time and booking are extras. A surcharge will apply in the evenings so don't be surprised if the meter has €6+ on it when you enter, even if at a taxi-stand.

===By car===
Definitely not a good idea to get into the city centre. Like most major cities traffic is a considerable problem, not to mention the hassle of parking. During working hours traffic is often blocked, inside the city as well as on the highway ring surrounding it. It is much better at night, but you'll probably have problems finding a place to leave the car near enough to nightlife attractions. And a '''Congestion charge''' will be applied anywhere from €2 to €10 per day to enter the second city ring (''i Bastioni'') in accordance with how much your vehicle pollutes. The charge is only applied on weekdays, 07:30-19:30. Drivers will have to buy a ticket either on-line or from key points in the city.

===On foot===
Walking is definitely a possibility, and although Milan is a large city, many of the main tourist attractions are within an easy and pleasant walk from one another. In recent years, several tourist hot spots, such as the Corso Vittorio Emanuele or the Via Dante have been made pedestrian, so walking shouldn't be a problem. No matter how hot the day, one will see elegantly dressed people of both sexes in timeless fashion without a drop of sweat. There are many places to sit, apart from the ubiquitous cafes, especially in the parks. Get a decent map of the city before setting out though, as the roads do not always maintain a straight line, and the various piazza can be confusing to the newcomer. In the many parks, there are dog only areas, but one should always be careful when walking as the two things one will see on the ground in the streets are cigarette ends and dog faeces.

===By bike===
Bikes are available through the [http://www.bikemi.com BikeMI bike sharing service]. You can register for annual or temporary subscriptions at any BikeMi station. If you register for a temporary subscription (weekly or daily), a user code, along with your password, will be sent to the e-mail address, chosen during your registration.

There are a lot of things you can see in Milan - from fine churches, old palaces, excellent museums, world class theatres and opera houses, cultural gems, striking buildings, sleek modern architectural works and lovely streets and squares.

Milan has the oldest churches in Italy (yes-- older than the ones in Rome because Milan was the capital of the Northern part of the late Roman Empire). Milan has more ancient and monumental churches than any other European city outside of Italy. You can see a very complete collection [http://www.skyscrapercity.com/showthread.php?t=1497363 here].

Some of the most important and beautiful churches one "can't miss" in Milan are:

* '''The Duomo''', in Duomo Square. Milan's main cathedral, a massive late Gothic church (started in 1386) in white marble, with hundreds of spires and thousands of statues on its exterior and a famous façade. Don't miss the chance to climb up onto the roof and enjoy the spectacular views of the city between the Gothic spires. Duomo is reachable by subway, lines MM1 or MM3, ''Duomo'' Station, or with many buses and trams. Roof open daily 09:00-17:30 (€7 for the stairs, €12 for the lift). Unless you are physically unfit, it is best recommended to take the stairs (250 steps only) and save €5. On an average, it should not take more than 5-6 minutes to climb the stairs. You may have your belongings searched by the Guardia before entering the Cathedral, so show up lightly packed.

* '''Saint Mary of the Graces''' (Chiesa di Santa Maria delle Grazie).  Entry to the basilica is free. A Unesco World Heritage site, this basilica is one of the masterpieces of the Renaissance architect Donato Bramante. The dome is one of the most delightful creation of Renaissance era. The exterior is delicately carved, and the interior is filled with bright light and whimsical atmosphere, a triumph of harmony. The nave is from gothic period. The rectory is separate from Santa Maria alle Grazie and houses the famous Last Supper ('Cenacolo Vinciano') by Leonardo da Vinci (even though nothing remains of "His" painting, it is now 100% restoration). Although not becoming a "pop icon" like the Mona Lisa has perhaps become, the Last Supper fresco is arguably the lifetime masterpiece of Leonardo da Vinci and his most influential work artistically. It is best to reserve tickets a few months before the visit and costs €8 as of 2014. Cancelled reservations are sold from 08:15 every morning (if there are any, best to show up in person). Tickets can be be reserved by phone (+39 2 8942-1146) or [http://www.vivaticket.it/index.php]. Reachable by trams 20, 24, 29 or 30 or by subway, lines MM1 and MM2 ''Cadorna'' Station, or MM1 ''Conciliazione'' station.

* '''Saint Ambrose''' (Basilica di Sant' Ambrogio), in Piazza San Ambrogio. Free entrance. The most important example of the Lombard Romanesque style of architecture, built between 1080 and 1140. In this basilica structural and technical innovations like the groined cross vault lead to wider vaulted naves being made possible. Now it is the second church in the city right after the duomo. Partly damaged in World War II, it shows many masterpieces, like the Vuolvinious golden altar, a Carolingian goldsmith masterpiece, and the very important IV century mosaics of the chapel of San Vittore in Ciel d'oro. The magnificent marble pulpit dates back to X century, whilst the external Atrium preserves some of the best examples of Lombard Romanesque sculpture available. Reachable by subway: MM2 ''Sant'Ambrogio''.

* '''Saint Maurice''' (Chiesa di San Maurizio al Monastero Maggiore). Free entrance. A stunning UNESCO listed, fully frescoed Renaissance church. Most of the paintings are the work of Bernardino Luini. It's considered the "Sistine Chapel" of Milan, you can find it beside of the Archeological Museum in Corso Magenta MM2 - MM1 Cadorna station.

* '''Saint Lawrence''' (Basilica di San Lorenzo Maggiore). Preserved inside this church is a lovely 4th century rotunda, famous for its beautiful courtyard, with Roman-age columns and a statue of the emperor Constantine. The basilica has been built on an imperial palace of the Roman era and is one of the most ancient churches in the world, although baroque remodeling makes its age difficult to envisage. The Saint Aquilinus chapel (€4) is definitely worth a visit. The church can be reached by tram, or the ''Missori'' metro station.

* '''Sant'Eustorgio and the Portinari Chapel''' (Basilica di Sant'Eustorgio e Capelli Portinari). Deconsecrated church now a museum. Entry prices are €6 for the church and €12 for the museum and Portinari Chapel (As of 2014). Originally a IV century paleochristian basilica, it is now one of the most important monument of the city. Here you will find the gorgeous Sforza family monumental tombs and more importantly, the Portinari Chapel, one of the biggest achievement in Lombard Renaissance. It is located in the Navigli district, MM2 Porta Genova.

* '''San Nazaro''' (Basilica di San Nazaro in Brollo). Free entrance. Another IV century basilica preserved within a younger church complex. It is very important in history because it was the first western church ever built in a Latin Cross plant instead of a Greek Cross plant. Very interesting the Trivulzio mausoleum at the entrance, dedicated to the Marshall Trivulzio, who betrayed the Sforza family and gave Milan to the King of France (and therefore forced Leonardo da Vinci to move to France). The masterpiece of the Basilica is the Santa Caterina chapel, with gorgeous Renaissance frescoes by Bernardino Lanino. Very interesting is also the archaeological part. Very close you can find another beautiful church, the '''San Calimero basilica''', with an amazing frescoed crypt.

Some other beautiful and important (and free) churches worth visiting in the city centre are:

* '''San Simpliciano basilica''' Contains the Shrine of the Martyrs dell'Anaunia, another important relic from the IV century, perhaps the best of all the paleochristian basilicas in Milan. Don't miss the frescoed apse.

* '''Santa Maria presso San Satiro church''' A hidden jewel, really a must see. It is a masterpiece by Donato Bramante, who created here the first ''trompe l'oeil'' in art history.

The crypt is one of the most ancient in Milan, and it shows huge roman imperial era ruins.

*'''San Cristoforo church'''. Little cosy ancient gothic church, it is settled beside of the Naviglio Grande. It is one of the most picturesque sights of the city.

*'''Università degli Studi di Milano''' [http://www.unimi.it/], commonly known as '''La Statale''' &mdash; Established in 1924 in a 14th-century building named Ca' Granda with a marvellous internal courtyard. The University is on Festa del Perdono Street, very close to the Duomo. Reach by bus or subway, line MM1 MM3 Duomo Station. It also has other facilities around the city, the most important in Celoria Street.

*'''Politecnico di Milano''' [http://www.polimi.it/english/] &mdash; A Technical University established in 1863 and is now one of Europe's most outstanding centres for engineering, architecture and industrial design.

Almost every Milan university has several facilities around the city and some of them also have secondary centres in other areas of Lombardy and Italy, so if you need something specific you'd better ask before getting there. Every university has its own students' residences, which are much smaller than they should be, so they can satisfy only a small portion of demand for them. If you're not able to get a room in a residence, every university has an ISU, a Studying Right Institute, that can help you find a room or an apartment for rent.  Renting a room or an apartment can be very expensive, starting at €400-500 /month for a room. '''MeglioMilano''' [http://www.meglio.milano.it/] is an association that is now experimenting a project to help non-Milanese students find a home and retired old people find somebody to help them in everyday life. The project is called '''Prendi in casa uno studente''' (Bring a student home), you can ask for information by email (mailto:meglio.segreteria@meglio.milano.it) or by phone on (+39) 02 76020589.

It contains a lot of designer clothes, including that from Moschino, Prada and Yves Saint Laurent, to D&G and La Perla with huge discounts. Unfortunately this shop is now closed.  </buy>

And it has a very pleasant feel because it is more like a mini-town than an actual outlet, with Italian-style piazzas and pretty alleyways, surrounded by rolling hills and a lovely local countryside, and absent of cars. With over 20 million visitors having come ever since its opening in 2000, you can find luxurious designer names, such as Dolce & Gabbana, Etro, Diesel, Roberto Cavalli, Ferragamo, Timberland, Tommy Hilfiger, Prada, Geox, Swatch, Bulgari, Swarovski, and several more (at bargain prices)! Then, if you want to have a meal, you can stop for some fast-foods at Burger King or the Italian Spizzico, have an ice-cream or sip at a drink in a café. Despite the slightly long trip, it makes a truly great day out, and is heaven for any fashionista or passionate shopper!</buy>

For people wanting to spend a bit less while still buying beautiful pieces, other areas are better. One of these is Vercelli Avenue (MM1 ''Pagano'', MM1 ''Conciliazione'' subway stations), another one is Buenos Aires Avenue (MM1 ''Porta Venezia'', MM1 ''Lima'', MM1/MM2 ''Loreto'' subway stations), reputed as being the longest shopping street of Europe.
Corso Buenos Aires connects Porta Venezia to Piazzale Loreto, and is even more commercial: here you can find Calzedonia, Alex Fashion, Luisa Spagnoli, Furla, Brian & Barry and Nara Camice. 

The Brera district (''Lanza'', or ''Montenapoleone'' metro stops) is also not to be missed for trendy and young, yet stylish, boutiques. The Brera district is great for other things, such as browsing through ancient rare art stores and galleries, sipping a hot drink at a refined-air cafe, attending a funky disco, or looking for exotic furniture. However, today, there are a lot of young designers who have up-and coming boutiques, which are slightly less expensive than their Montenapoleone counterparts, but are quite fashionable and of high quality. The Brera district is great because it combines chic, old-air shops, with zeitgeist, modernist and youthful ones. Jewelry stores include Papic oro e argento or Alcozer & J. Bijoux, fashion shops include Accessori or Laura Ashley, and furniture stores include Zohar or Lucitalia.

Let us not forget, the Piazza del Duomo, Via Dante, Piazza San Babila, Galleria Victor Emanuel and the Corso Giacomo Matteoti, which are excellent shopping places. In the Galleria, you get brand fashion stores, two bookstores (Rizzoli and Libreria Bocca) and a sliverware store called Bernasconi plus a Gucci cafe (and many, many more!). In the Corso Giacomo, you can find Abercrombie & Fitch, in Piazza del Duomo you have Grimoldi, Ruggeri, Donna and La Rinascente department store, in Piazza San Babila you can find Upim, Eddy Monetti, Guess and Valextra, and there are loads of shops in the Via Dante, so there are really heaps of shopping opportunities in this area.  

For hipsters, there's the elongated Porta Ticinese area, especially on Saturday, when the flea market '''Fiera di Senigallia''' takes place near the Darsena (2008: currently that area is closed and Fiera di Senigallia has been moved to a place near Porta Genova MM2 subway and train station). This is a great place to wander and browse, and save money if you've somehow survived Milan's high end boutiques. Sort through new and second-hand clothes, old furniture, fake art nouveau lamps, perfumed candles and every kind of essence, books, comics, records, videos and DVDs. In the Corso Ticense, several shops, such as Diesel, RVM Orologi, Dress, Energie, Colors & Beauty, Tintoria La Boutique, Blu Max, Le Jean Marie, Brazilian, Ethic, L'Uomo outlet, Les Tropezziennes, Atelier cucine e ..., Panca's Show Room, or Cinius (and loads more) are present. There are also several banks and post offices, such as the Banca Popolare and Poste Italiane, and a CTS Viaggi travel agency. Thus, with so many shops, you can keep your shopping bags full, and browse even further.   

The other market in Milan is the Mercatone del Naviglio Grande. This takes place along the Alzaia Naviglio Grande on the last Sunday of each month. Dedicated to antiques, the market has over 400 exhibitors, so you're certain to find something that catches your eye.

If outlet shopping is your thing, the shopping outlet in Serravalle Scrivia (a town roughly an hour's drive from Milan [http://www.mcarthurglen.it/serravalle/home/home.php] is a good bet. Tour company-operated buses, including one that leaves from near the Castle, will take you there and back (roughly €20 for the round-trip as of early 2008). Reputed to be the first designer outlet in Italy and the biggest in Europe. Over 180 stores stock clothing, footwear and accessories, and it has a parking with 3,000 parking lots, a children's playground, bars and restaurants. In central Milan, you also get some good outlets too, such as Vestistock, D Magazine, or 10 Corso Como (and several more) which all have designer clothes and other interesting features. Corso Buenos Aires is the best street in the city for outlet shopping, since it contains many of the big shopping centres or department stores.

==Eat==

Although Milan is a city that changes its mind as quickly as fashion trends come and go, it remains one of the strongest bastions of traditional Italian cooking, where homemade elements are still very much praised and appreciated. There are trattorias, enoteche (wine bars) and restaurants (including luxury ones) everywhere that offer traditional Milanese and Italian dishes to eat. This city's traditional cooking is based on filling dishes like osso buco (braised veal shanks) and risotto alla milanese (chicken-broth risotto made with saffron).

Dining times tend to be a shade earlier than in Rome or Florence, with lunch generally served between 12:30PM and 2:30PM and dinner from 7:30PM to 9:30PM. Dinner, and sometimes lunch, are often preceded by that great Milanese institution, the aperitivo—a glass of sparkling wine or a Campari soda.

Chinese restaurants are mainly located around via Paolo Sarpi, the heart of Milan's Chinatown. Long Chang and Jubin are two popular choices.

Avoid the restaurants around the Duomo, they tend to be tourist-only spots, with low quality food at inflated prices. Be aware that most restaurants charge an extra "serving tax", approximate 2 Euros per consumer. Also avoid restaurants or cafes around the central station, where it has been reported that hidden serving tax can be up to 5 euros per person with cheap quality food.

For authentic local dining options, try dining with the locals themselves. [http://www.bonappetour.com/s/Milan BonAppetour] is a great way to discover local Milanese chefs who would love to have you over for an evening dinner. It's a great way to make friends over home-made food, and company. 

The city also features an excellent cafe called '''Brek''' with several locations throughout Milan, including one near Piazza San Babila. The food is very good, the prices are fair, and it's a good place to stop for a quick bite.

For an artistic dining experience, try '''Lacerba''' on via Orti, 4, which serves dishes inspired by the early 20th century art movement, Futurism.

===Aperitivo===
In the last several years, Milan has established a local version of the Aperitivo or Happy Hour. Italians drink very moderately and "happy hour" is not a drinking, but a social event. 

Roughly from 7PM to 9PM, many bars offer drinks and cocktails at a fixed price (€5-8 each), accompanied by free all-you-can-eat buffets with snacks, pastas, and many other small appetizers. But be careful not to confuse "aperitivo" with "free dinner". It's a snack to be enjoyed with a drink. Italians will immediately see you as a buffoon- and it's seen as tacky to fill up on finger food for dinner, although it's common to spot them doing so.

A great place to go is the Straf Hotel [http://www.straf.it/concept_eng.htm] near the Duomo. A whole lot of these places can be found in the area near the Colonne di san Lorenzo and Corso di porta Ticinese, or close by in the Navigli area (subway: MM2 ''Porta Genova'' Station).  You can also take the #3 tram to "Ventiquattro" stop.  From Porta Ticinese (the large archway), head west into the canal area of Navigli.  There are great restaurants for aperitivo in this area, including:

La Ringhiera: Ripa di Porta Ticinese, 5

Slice: Via Cardinale Ascanio Sforza, 9

Mas: Ripa di Porta Ticinese, 11

Another great area for aperitivo, not far from Duomo, is ''Corso Buenos Aires''.

Around this area you can find cool cocktail bars like:

'''b:free cocktail bar''' [http://www.bfreecocktailbar.com]: Via Lecco, 21 (close to Porta Venezia metro stop)

*[http://www.peck.it/ '''Peck'''], Via Victor Hugo 4, +39 02 861040. Foodies in the Duomo area should not miss this place. It is the [http://www.deandeluca.com  Dean and Deluca] of Milan, a gorgeous food shop that stocks the finest of just about everything.

Then, you return to each of the counters you visited, where the staff have wrapped your treats exquisitely. '''To save 10%''', go to the side-store of Peck 11:30-12:00.

===On the budget===

If you would like to eat something on the budget perfect places you can fine in I Navigli. One of the places is Antica Osteria Briosca Via Ascanio Sforza,13 Milan. They do Buffet every night 18.00-22.00 for 8 euro inc. 1 drink (bottle of water, glass of wine, beer). Food is realy good and they have choice of vegetarian options.

===Breakfast===
In bars you can enjoy great caffè espresso, cappuccino and a brioche for as little as €2. At bars in the Duomo and San Babila areas, breakfast can be very expensive if you sit down. If in doubt go to the bar and eat there, you'll pay what the Italians do- and they will admire your audacity too.

===Fast food===
Milan, as a big city, is filled with several different forms of fast-foods, from the foreign giants and national chains, to independantly-owned take-aways and sandwich bars. Most fast-food restaurants are found in the Duomo, Buenos Aires and central station areas, as these are the most crowded and busy ones in the city. In the Piazza Duomo and Galleria, one can find international fast-foods such as '''McDonald's''' and '''Burger King''', but Italian chains such as '''Autogrill''' are found too. Such Italian fast-food chains, such as '''Spizzico''', '''Ciao''' and Autogrill can be found all over the city. There are several Ciao outlets in places such as no. 12 Corso Europa or no. 54 Via Montebianco, and for McDonald's, you get a restaurant in the Piazza del Duomo and Galleria, and also some in the Corso Buenos Aires, plus some others in places such as Corso Vercelli or Piazzale Lotto. Other fast-foods which can be found in Milan include '''Garbagnati''' (''Cordusio'' metro station) which is a self-service restaurant and bakery, which has several vegeterian courses, or the '''Luini''' (''Duomo'' metro station, on Via Santa Radegonda - throughout the same metro exit) which is a restaurant which is famous for making Southern Italian-style pieces of dough with mozzarella and tomatoes inside.

===Pizza===
Although Milan cannot claim to be the birthplace of pizza, (that claim belongs to Naples), you can still find good pizzas in Milan. The best areas for pizza are near Marghera street, at the end of Vercelli Avenue, and on the Navigli, on Brera. Expect to pay €8-15 for a pizza and a beer.

If you are in the Northeast area, there are many little pizzerias on viale Fulvio Testi (the northern extension of viale Zara) in the Greco area, of which an excellent choice is Pizzeria De Pino. Ask for John Luca, and don't miss the lasagne. Here you may also get homemade Mirto (as you can at many other places). The prices are very reasonable in these establishments; expect to pay about €4-5 for pizza and €3-4 for beer. These places are where the locals eat, they are very friendly and helpful but few speak anything but Italian. Take the phrase book with you.

Another restaurant on the viale Fulvio Testi that is a real recommendation is Pizzeria De Bassié. They offer really good homemade pizzas and especially their special "Adriano" pizza is a really good option!

In Milan, pizza is often eaten with a knife and fork, but of course eating with one's hands is possible and welcome. Most people do both.

Watch out for frozen pizza in Milan (it usually states it on the menu). Always check the restaurant has a wood burning oven and that they are using it.

Pizza Fashion near the Centrale train station is good choice and they also do takeaway dessert if you're running to catch your train.

*<eat name="Pizzeria Da Giuliano" alt="" address="Via Paolo Sarpi 60" directions="In westmost part of the street" phone="02 341630" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="">Nice and cozy pizzeria with great, quite thick and large pizza slices.

===Snacks===
In summer enjoy gelato, an excellent Italian ice cream. The quality mark "gelato artigianale" indicates gelaterias that produce their own ice creams, without industrial processing.
Bakeries are open every day, you can enjoy great and inexpensive bread-related food, such as pizza and focaccia. You can find a bakery almost everywhere in Milan, even in the Duomo area, and is a good alternative to bars for a fast lunch.

===Tipping===
There is much confusion regarding tipping in Italy. Italians do not typically leave tips any more at restaurants. In touristy locations there will often be a line (a recent trend) left blank for a tip to be added. Just draw a line through it and leave a few Euros. Never leave tips at bar counters.

===Milan by night===
Milan has a great variety of places where you can have fun. A great starting point is Como Avenue ('''Corso Como'''), near Garibaldi Station, full of bars and glamorous clubs. In the summertime, this street is packed with young and attractive people. 

Another place where you can go is '''Navigli''' quarter, near Porta Ticinese Avenue and XXIV Maggio Square, where you can find a lot of small pubs, open air cafes and restaurants by the water canals (''navigli''). In many pubs and bars you can find a free booklet named '''Zero2''' which is a guide to Milan Nightlife: if you don't know what to do or where to go, do grab one!

Other popular night spots with bars and people are viale Monte Nero (on Wednesday it's packed with people in the piazza in front of a bar called "Momo"), Piazzale Susa (and Citta' Studi area). Nights are overwhelmingly crowded at the '''Colonne di San Lorenzo''' (not far from Navigli quarter), and in the cozy Latin-quarter of '''Brera'''. Another good spot is the pedestrian part of Corso Sempione near the "Peace Arch" ('''Arco della Pace''').

There are bars and clubs open all week long but usually few people go out at night on Mondays or Tuesdays, the vast majority prefer to have fun on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. However, Wednesday night appears to be one of the coolest to go out in stylish VIP-frequented clubs.

Milan has an alternative club scene, with a few crews making electronic music parties outside clubs. Ultracheap, every time in a different location (lofts, warehouses, farms, pools, city parks) those kind of parties attract people aged 20-28. The biggest one is called RESET! [http://www.wearereset.com]and attracts 1500-2000 people once a month

===Gay and Lesbian Travellers===
Although Milan has a variety of bars, clubs, restaurants and venues for gay and lesbian travellers, many only operate one night a week. Choosing from one of the "mainstays" below and asking anyone where to go should lead you in the right direction. 
Also, venues are not concentrated in one area of town, but rather spread throughout the city. 
Foreign travelers are often confused by the ARCI card regime that is required for entry into many clubs. It's a relic from the times of police raids that has now conferred tax benefits on these private club owners. No need to fear-- just show up and purchase one at any of the clubs. You MUST bring some ID or you cannot purchase one. 
* Wednesday and Thursday nights hosts a gay crowd at L'Elephant (Via Lecco, subway: MM1 ''Porta Venezia'' Station).
* Thursdays aperitivo at Hotel Straf near Duomo is well worth a look.
* Saturday nights at Billy or Amnesia (viale Forlanini near Linate airport, reachable by taxi or #73 bus) or BinarioUno disco (via Plezzo, subway: MM2 ''Lambrate'') or Black Hole (former lesbian club).
* On Sunday nights, hundreds flock to the largest and classiest spot in town, the Borgo del Tempo Perso (via Fabio Massimo, subway: MM3 ''Porto di Mare'') (open year-round although outdoor area open May-Sept only).
Cruising clubs such as the "Flexo" and "Depot" are hugely popular in Italy, perhaps even more so than saunas. 
The best saunas in 2008 include Metro (via Schiaparelli near the Central Station, subway: MM2 and MM3 ''Centrale'' Station) and Royal Hammam (near BinarioUno club, via Plezzo, subway: MM2 ''Lambrate'' Station), mostly packed during the weekend especially at night as they are open 24 hours. 
Open air meeting places such as Parco Nord, the gardens behind Cadorna station or Ortomercato are not recommended (criminals and hustlers). The safest way to cruise is to take the late night metro and get into the second-last coach, which is usually occupied by the gays and lesbians.

===Budget===

====Camping====
*'''Città di Milano''', located in Quinto Romano, Via Gaetano Airaghi 61, 02 48200134, (Fax 02 48202999). It is located way on the outskirts of the city. If you arrive by car, take the tangenziale Ovest and exit at San Siro/ Fiera. If by public transport, take the subway (the M1 line to De Angeli) and then a bus (bus no 80). However keep an eye out for signs pointing to the campsite. Don't be afraid to ask locals on the bus where it is. Be aware that it's next to a rather smelly farm. However, the campsite itself has a bar, a restaurant and very good shower facilities. This is definitely an option for students or people who would rather spend money in Milan, instead of accommodation.

==Stay safe==
Unless you venture into the dangerous suburbs, Milan is a rather safe city. Certain areas near Loreto, Central station, and Porto di Mare (Southern end of the yellow metro line) can be unsafe in the night. At the station, do not seek help from any random person offering to help with the booking machines / ATMs or under any other pretext. After they have helped, they will pursue you to get as much money as possible for their "help". Or they can pretend to be helpful, cheating instead. A possible scenario: they guide you through the interface of the ticket machine in a metro station, and advice you to pay using notes instead of coins (allegedly the ticket machine wouldn't accept coins). If you insert a 20 euro note, the machine would give it back after a few moments. However, before it happens, they will grab your attention saying that the ticket should appear in the bottom of the machine, and simultaneously an old beggar with body odour will appear begging for money. You wouldn't notice it but the beggar will collect the 20 euro note that the machine would give  back to you. The "helper" would then show to you that the maximum amount of change given by the machine is less than 10 euros.

Do NOT leave your cell phone or any valuables on a restaurant table. My friend today had his iPhone stolen by a very crafty woman with a map who inched closer and closer to our table. As we yelled at her to move away, she subtly stole my friend's iPhone. While this might seem obvious not to keep valuables in public view, everyone around us had their phones publicly displayed on the table. 

Beware of the vendors in the streets: most of the merchandise they sell is imitation/fake luxury goods. Even at a fraction of the cost of the original merchandise, the quality is spotty, and the goods are not well maintained in storage.

They may also try giving you "free" friendship bracelets (sometimes calling them 'a gift').  After you take the bracelet, a coloured piece of string, they will hit you up for money and relentlessly pursue you until they get as much as they can. They will be forceful, physically tying the bracelet to your wrist, or laying it on your shoulder as you try and walk away. This is especially true in the tourist areas around the '''Duomo''' and '''Castello Sforzesco'''. They usually first ask "Where are you from?". Just ignore them. 

In empty places, watch for strangers directly approaching you. Try to be with other people like in a bus station or a shopping mall.

Beware of people hanging around the square outside Duomo: they will walk up to you and forcefully give you corn on the hands to feed the pigeons on the pretence that they are free. All the pigeons in the surrounding area will then fly to you. The people will then relentlessly pursue you and ask you for money.

Be careful crossing the street: drivers don't usually respect pedestrian crossings unless there is a red light for them to stop.

Around '''Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II''', there are some women who would approach you to ask you for petition signatures for an "anti-drug, anti-AIDS for youth" organization. They would ask which country you're from and try to small-talk you to their booth with the signature sheets. A story from them is that the women are from Slovenia and have been working with the troubled youths for 8 years. Then they will ask you to make a '''40 euro''' donation to "save a life". If you refuse, they will ask for 20 euros etc. Do not sign their petition sheet; the names and donated amount on the papers are likely made up. Advice is to ignore them.

Two big theme parks are nearby: Gardaland [http://www.gardaland.it], the best in Italy, and Canevaworld Resort [http://www.canevaworld.it], home of Movieland (a movie theme park) and a water park. Accessible by way of regular trains (65-85 minutes from Centrale station) and buses. Very crowded during summer and weekends.
* '''[[Oltrepò Pavese]]''' &mdash;  Wine region of Lombardy, about 70 km to the south of Milan, worth a day or weekend trip to relax, walk or cycle and have the Italian Sunday brunch at one of the excellent local restaurants.
* '''[[Cremona]]'''&mdash; a really beautiful historic city center with the '''most beautiful cathedral''' in Lombardy after the Duomo cathedral of Milan. Filled with the most important frescoes, it is definitely worth a visit.

* Excursions without a car: You don't need a car to escape from the business, the traffic, the congestion, the fog in wintertime, and the afa (humid heat in summer), of the city of Milan to a wonderful world of lakes, mountains, castles, and good food: just take the train and, sometimes, the boat.
*Biking Trips: Beginning at the 24th May Square (Piazza 24 Maggio) there is an excellent and very long bike road on the right (northern) bank of the canal. Be aware to take the Naviglio Grande (going west on the northern bank of the canal) and follow it as long as you want. After a few kilometers, you'll reach the nice Chiesetta di San Cristoforo, a popular spot for marriages. If you are well trained, proceed through the countryside. About 10 km to Gaggiano, a very nice and tiny village, and 20 km to Abbiategrasso. If you are still in the mood for riding, follow the canal on the right and reach Robecco sul Naviglio.
