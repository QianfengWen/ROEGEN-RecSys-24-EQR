'''Diyarbakır''' is the largest city in Southeastern Turkey, on the banks of Tigris (''Dicle''), one of the greatest rivers of [[Middle East]] and considererd by many to be the most beautiful city of the southeastern anatolia.

==Get in==

Turkish Airlines [http://www.thy.com/en-INT/] offers daily domestic '''flights''' from [[Istanbul]] (IST) and [[Ankara]] to Diyarbakir ('''DIY''').

Direct '''trains''' (the ''Guney Kurtalan Express'') run five days a week from [[Ankara]] to Diyarbakir, taking 21 hours. There are couchettes and a sleeping car. The main stops along the route are [[Kayseri]], [[Sivas]], and [[Malatya]]; from Diyarbakir the train continues to Kurtalan, another 3 hours. For details see Turkish railways website at tcdd.gov.tr, but beware that the timetable and the online booking system give different days of running for this service. Note also that Ankara railway station is partially closed for rebuilding until early 2018, with bus replacements to Irmak 60 km east of the city, and altered timings. 

Many local '''bus''' companies offer services from cities all over Turkey. The bus from Erzurum takes 6 hrs (from 50TL tourist price to 35TL). The main bus station (''otogar'') is about 10 km away from city centre, along the highway to Urfa.

When traveling from Diyarbakir to west by bus be prepared for several ID check ups at military checkpoints.

==Get around==

==See==
The '''old city''' containing many mosques and churches, is a little run down but enclosed in antique walls. The '''city walls''' are very old and certainly worth a walk around. Some of towers are restored by the municipality and are easy to reach from the center of the old city. One such is '''Kechi Burcu''', which offers a nice view of Tigris river below the city, and a great look over the city walls—a teahouse offering traditional tea is nearby as well. However, be careful while walking on the walls and do not enter into all of the towers which looks fancy enough, as some of them are home to junkies.

The old city is like a village in the middle of the city with village mentality; goose running around, women having cay in front of their houses and kids (who'll beg for money) shouting to foreigners the few English words they know. However, walking around in the city center is unique and totally different from other Turkish cities. You'll see people as they live their everyday kurdish life. If you are lucky, you may even get invited for a tea by a friendly shopowner.

To avoid problems, dress modestly. There is an extensive development outside including a pleasant park. It's called '''Gazi Kösk''' and it contains many teahouses and traditional bed-like constructions, where you sink into cushions and drink tea while overlooking the Dicle river below.

Reopening is expected for 2022. In September 2019, entering the area from castle direction was possible but probably neither really safe nor secure (in particular not at night). In the area there were many destroyed or damaged Armenian residential houses of this former quarter.

==Do==
You can go for a walk on the old city wall. Get onto it at the northern gate and walk anticlockwise to Mardin Gate. Great views of the surrounding area and the city and it's free. Single tourists might be conspicuous, however, and should beware of pickpockets. 

Many tourists only visit the old part of Diyarbakir, but don't miss the totally new and modern '''New City'''. Around '''Ofis''' district you find a lot of nice bars and cafès filled with lots of students and young couples. Some Bars have livemusic, but better ask some locals on the street for that. Don't worry about security issues as this part of the city is filled with policemen.

A tourist office is located at Kıbrıs Caddesi (phone 0412 221 2173), helping out with city plans, guide books, and staff are eager to chat with little English. Opening times not necessarily match with what is written (Mo-Fr 9-13, Sat 9-13). If you stand in front of the closed door it's worth coming back after a while.

==Buy==

In the old city you will find many people manufacturing metal tools by hand - sickles, hammers, and other, mostly agricultural implements.

You can also find cheap (around 25 TL) '''traditional kurdish trousers''', that older men wear everyday. Enjoy tea + bargaining sessions with some friendly '''Bazaar''' shopkeepers.
==Eat==

*'''Hasan Pasha Hani''', Best place to get breakfast in Diyarbakir, located in an old caravanserai. Breakfast consists of your entire table being covered in many small dishes of tasty foods. Expensive for local standards but still very affordable, and delicious.

*'''Buket Lahmacun''', One of the most popular and most tasty places in Diyarbakir to try lahmacun (lahmajun), thin crispy dough covered in meat and spices. Is very tasty and quite cheap. Comes with many salads.

*'''Dağ Kapı Ciğercisi''', Restaurant popular with locals for its grilled liver on a skewer. The restaurant is located in an old house and is very big. Popular with locals.

A must try is seropeh (ser û pê) which is a traditional kurdish stew made from the head and feet of a sheep. Very cheap and tasty. Restaurants serving this dish are very common in Diyarbakir, just look for lamb skulls displayed in the window.

The grill of lamb liver, ''ciğer kebabı'', is a famous part of Diyarbakır cuisine.

''Ekşili etli dolma'', ''meftune'', ''içli köfte'' are some other "must taste"s.

A mixture of wheat grain, chick-peas, and yoghurt called ''mehir'' is purpoted to be very good for stomach and is said to help healing [[Travellers' diarrhea|stomach problems]]. 

Diyarbakır is very famous with its desserts. ''Kadayıf'', ''künefe'' are the two main types of desserts. They are acquired tastes, though, as they are very sweet and contain huge amounts of sugar. '''Saim Usta''' is perhaps the best place to have ''kadayıf'' in town, while for ''künefe'', you should check out '''Levent Usta'''.

==Drink==
There are many teagardens in Ofis and along the Basalt city walls, where you can meet locals. People in Diyarbakir are very open towards foreigners and you'll have a hard time paying for your own tea.

==Stay safe==
Diyarbakır is rough. At first glance, it seems not a very welcoming city, but actually it is the contrary. It is not advisable at all to walk alone during the night time, especially in the old quarter in areas without street lighting. Taking some precautions during your visit is advisable and just using common sense. Don't hang around in dark areas, try not to look like the typical tourist, etc. Stay with the people, and you are fine. Many locals on the street are really helpful. Get their help before getting lost. It may happen that they show you all the way until you're at the place you asked about particularlt at night).

The lower end of the street toward the Mardin Kapı, the Mardin Gate, is pretty dark and can be dangerous at night. Do not become prey to pickpockets who seem to hang around there. 

The modern part of Diyarbakir is very much safer. Kayapinar, a part of the city center, is pretty  modern, and is pretty safe compared to the old city areas. Places like 75 and Diclekent are the safest in the entire city, and has little to no safety issues. Still, you should take precautions just as you do in a western city of Turkey, as pickpocketing and many other dangerous things that exist in the rest of the country applies to this place too, even though the possiblity for it to happen is pretty small compared to the rest of the city.

Diyarbakir seems to have recovered from the old times and the police are trying their best to provide a high level of security. So don't be scared about the issues mentioned above, as the city itself is still a jewel among others in eastern Turkey, offering an amazing and unforgettable charm. Tourist crowds are still tending to go to Mardin (1h away), so enjoy having the city mostly for your own.

==Get Out==
*'''[[Hasankeyf]]''' — village to east, downriver on Tigris, with lots of medieval Islamic architecture and pleasant vistas

*Mainly all other cities in [[Eastern_Anatolia|eastern]] and [[South-eastern_Anatolia|southeastern]] Turkey.

*'''[[Mardin]]''' and '''[[Urfa|Şanlıurfa]]''' are both a day's trip from Diyarbakir, but Mardin is worth spending the night. The dolmush from the İlçe Otogarı Taksi to Mardin takes 1.5hrs and costs 17 TL.

*'''Karacadag''', the forerunner of domesticated wheat originated in the mountains of Karacadag. Cultivation of wheat in the area dates back to approximately 8,800 BCE. Today Karacadag is home to seasonal nomads. Explore the ancient villages populated by Turkmen and Kurdish tribes. 

*'''[[Elazığ]]''', a city filled with natural beauties with its own unique culture.

*'''Eğil''', a district home to the graves of many prophets, and is pretty important fort both historians and locals.

*'''[[Ergani]]''', the largest non-metropolitan district of Diyarbakir with a population of over 137.000 people. It is home to two ancient sites and one mighty mountain, and offers a great experience for tourists.

*See where the first animals in the world were domesticated as mankind started settled farming at '''[[Çayönü]]''' around 40km north-west of Diyarbakir, and close to the district center of [[Ergani]]. The site is hugely important for neolithic research and dates from 7200 to 6600 BC.
