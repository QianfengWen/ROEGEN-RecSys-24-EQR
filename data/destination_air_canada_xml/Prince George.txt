'''Prince George''' is a major service centre in Northern [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. It is the largest city north of [[Kamloops]] in BC, and known as BC's Northern Capital. Prince George is located at the crossroads of highway 16 (East-West) and highway 97 (north-south). It is situated in a large valley at the confluence of the Fraser river and the Nechako river, both significant, high flow rivers.  

==Understand==
From the very beginning, Prince George was built around the forest industry. Today, the forest industry is still the largest employer in town. Prince George has a significant industrial areas North and South of town, along the Fraser River. This includes 3 pulp & paper mills, several chemical factories, several saw mills and an oil refinery. Since its beginnings, Prince George has diversified significantly. Today, Prince George has a large government presence, an important court house, a large provincial jail and the University of Northern British Columbia, one of five British Columbia universities. 

In spite of several interesting and exciting natural features, and a few notable museums, a superb Prince George Folkfest in July, a fabulous art gallery, a fantastic seasonal farmer's market, and many other attempts by the city to make Prince George an interesting tourist destination, Prince George remains a stop; a service center for transiting tourists, and not a destination on most travelers' itineraries.
