'''Jinjiang''' is a mainly industrial city just across the river from [[Quanzhou]] in [[Fujian]].

==Get in==
Jinjiang has an airport, while Quanzhou does not. However, it is a fairly minor airport; there are flights to [[Hong Kong]] and some mainland cities, but no international flights and not a large choice of domestic flights. The usual way to fly into the region would be via [[Xiamen]] or [[Fuzhou]].

To reach Jinjiang by train, or by bus from Fuzhou, go to Quanzhou and grab a taxi. Some city busses also go from Quanzhou to Jinjiang; 801 and 802 are two of the numbers. To get there by bus from Xiamen, take a Quanzhou bus and get off when it passes through Jinjiang.

==Get around==
Jinjiang is a long narrow city, spread along a river valley. Half hour bus rides are not unusual. It is a good city for drivers, with  lots of good new roads and some shopping areas with parking available. However, see [[driving in China]] for comments on traffic conditions.

==See==

==Do==

==Buy==

Jinjiang is very much an industrial city, especially shoes and clothing. Naturally, there are quite a few shops for those items. Nearby [[Shishi]], though, has better clothing markets.

The Filipino chain store SM have only a few locations in China. One is in Jinjiang, at the end of the 801 bus route furthest from Quanzhou. It is part of a very large modern mall.

==Eat==
While McDonalds and KFC are ubiquitous in China and Pizza Hut fairly common, Burger King has only a few locations so far. Oddly, Jinjiang has one, on the basement floor of the SM city Jinjiang, end of 801 bus route.
