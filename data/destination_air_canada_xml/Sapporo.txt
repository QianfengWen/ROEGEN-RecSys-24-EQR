'''Sapporo''' (札幌） [http://www.welcome.city.sapporo.jp/english/] is the capital and largest city of the northern island of [[Hokkaido]], [[Japan]].

==Understand==
[[Image:Skyline Sapporo Hokkaido Japan.jpg|thumb|350px|right|print=lead|Sapporo Skyline]]
Established in the latter half of the 1800s, Sapporo is one of Japan's newer cities. Nevertheless, the city's population has grown from seven in 1857 to nearly 2 million today. As a newer city by Japanese standards, it has less in the way of traditional architecture and infrastructure when compared to older cities such as [[Kyoto]] and [[Nara]]. However, what it lacks in perceived, traditional "Japanese-ness," it makes up for with many historical "Western-style" buildings; lovely, open, tree-filled boulevards to enjoy in summer; and excellent snow and skiing facilities in the long winter.

===Climate===
Sapporo has humid continental climate with wide temperature variations between summer and winter. Winters are cold, influnced by the Siberian Anticyclone, with an average temperature in January being -3.6°C (25.5°F) and features nights with temperatures around -7°C (19°F). The city receives huge amounts of snow during wintertime, this being given to the frozen winds originating in Siberia, which gather up moisture from the Sea of Japan. It is, in fact, the second snowiest city of its size in the world, with the average year-round snowfall being 597cm (235 inches), almost 10 times that of [[New York City]] and 2.5 times that of [[Buffalo]], the snowiest city in North America. It is only surpassed by [[Aomori]], also in [[Japan]] in northern [[Honshu]]. In spite of that the record low is very mild for its latitude, being only -28.5°C (-19.3°F). Summers are warm and humid, with the average temperature in August, the hottest month, being 22.3°C (72.1°F) and days usually feature highs around 26°C (79°F). 30°C (86°F) readings are occasionally observed, but very hot temperatures are very rare. The highest recorded temperature is 36.2°C (97.2°F). The east Asian Monsoon, usually arrives in early August, dropping moderate to low amounts of precipitation, and ends in early October. Inarguably the best season to visit the city, and [[Hokkaido]] in general is spring or autumn. The cherry blossom usually occurs around end of April to mid-May.

==Get in==
Sapporo is Hokkaido's main transport hub for all methods except for the Shinkansen, which will not open until 2031.

The route from [[Tokyo]] is the second most heavily traveled in the world, with several dozen Jumbos flying daily on a variety of carriers and flights as low as &yen;10000 one way if you book more than one month in advance.  Direct international service to Sapporo is limited to [[China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Taiwan]],[[Thailand]], [[Korea]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[Sakhalin]] (Russia), [[Guam]], [[Honolulu]] in the US, but both JAL and ANA provide nonstop service to [[Narita]] for intercontinental connections.  '''Skybus''' [http://www.skybus-jp.com/] operates a door to door shuttle and the JR trains run every 15 minutes directly to Sapporo station (36-40 minutes, unreserved &yen;1070; reserved &yen;1340).</listing>

===By train===
{{infobox|Shinkansen|The Tohoku Shinkansen, which currently runs from Tokyo to Aomori, is inching its way slowly towards Hakodate, with plans to eventually extend the line to Sapporo. Under the current schedule, bullet train service over the full ''Hokkaido Shinkansen'' to Sapporo will not open until 2031 - but when it does, the Hokkaido Prefectural Government claims that a travel time as low as ''four hours'' between Tokyo and Sapporo will be possible.}}
Getting to Sapporo by train is time-consuming and expensive.  Purchasing a JR pass is economical, if you're coming from [[Tokyo]] or anywhere in the south.  Within Hokkaido, trains connect Sapporo to most major cities, including [[Hakodate]], [[Otaru]] and [[Asahikawa]].

* <listing name="JR Sapporo Station" alt="札幌駅" directions="On the Namboku Line." address="North 2 West 1" phone="+81 011 222-6130" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="43.067838" long="141.350677">This is the main train station for Sapporo.</listing>

Trains run from Honshu to Hokkaido via the '''Seikan Tunnel'''. With a total length of 53.85 km (33.49 mi), the Seikan Tunnel was the world's longest railway tunnel until 2016, when it was surpassed by the Gotthard Base Tunnel in [[Switzerland]]. The Seikan Tunnel still claims the title of the world's longest tunnel with an undersea segment, with a 23.3 km (14.5 mi) section under the waters of the Tsugaru Strait.

Perhaps the most popular way to reach Sapporo by train is on the various overnight sleeper services. These are popular, so book in advance.  Note that for sleeper trains, the Japan Rail Pass only covers the basic fare. Pass holders are responsible for paying for the room and other surcharges. For example, a B2 room for two people on the Hokutosei costs &yen;12,600, with up to &yen;8,000 in surcharges.

* A free overnight option from Tokyo to Sapporo for Japan Rail Pass holders is to take the Shinkansen to Shin-Aomori and a regular "shuttle" train to Aomori, then take the ''Hamanasu'' (はまなす) express train to Sapporo. The one-way ride takes just over 11 hours, with arrival in Sapporo at around 6AM the next morning. The return trip to Tokyo takes 12 hours, owing to a longer layover in Aomori.

===By bus===
Express buses connect to most points in Hokkaido.  The main terminal is next to the Bus Center-Mae station of the subway Nanboku line and Toho line

===By ferry===

Although Sapporo is located inland, there are two major ferry ports nearby: [[Otaru]] and [[Tomakomai]]. Both have scheduled car and passenger ferry service to points outside Hokkaido.

==Get around==
[[Image:Sapporo_Tower.JPG|thumb|Sapporo TV Tower at night]]
[[Image:Tvtower.jpg|thumb]]
Unusual for a Japanese city, Sapporo is organized in grid system.  The main thoroughfare, the leafy '''Ō-Dōri''' (大通り, literally "Big Street"), runs east-west across the city and divides the city into North and South, while '''Sōsei-Gawa''' (創成川, literally "Creation River") divides the city into West and East, running under the main street '''Eki-Mae-Dōri''' (駅前道リ、literally "In Front of the Train Station Road").  The address of every block in the center is thus of the type "'''North X West Y'''" (prominently signposted at all intersections), making navigation a snap. However, most businesses etc. will still provide maps to their location, building names or landmarks, because the address "North X West Y" or the like simply means that the place you are trying to find will be ''somewhere'' in the block, and blocks in the centre of the city can be quite large!

===By bicycle===

The city is eminently cycle-able, so the most economical and fastest way to get around Sapporo is undoubtedly on two wheels. While there is a complicated looking city bike scheme, there is also a large bike hire lot adjacent to the east wing of the station. It costs 500 yen per day and you are provided with a lock, all you need is your passport. For more information go and see tourist information in the west concourse of the station.

===By train===
The JR above-ground trains are reasonably priced and a good option for traveling in Sapporo and surroundings.  The trains arrive and depart at specific times. You'll most likely want to take a train to and from the airport.

===By subway===
Sapporo has three subway lines, all converging at '''Ōdōri Station''' at the center of the grid.  The Namboku Line ("North-South") runs north-south, the Tōzai Line runs along Odori east-west.  Only the Tōhō Line breaks the mold by running in a C-shaped curve from northeast to southeast.  Single fares cost &yen;200 and up, with a choice between subway-only tickets or transfer (subway, bus and streetcar) tickets.  The simplest option is the ''With You'' stored value card (lowest denomination &yen;1000).  On weekends and public holidays, the ''Donichika-Kippu'' (ドニチカキップ) allows unlimited 1-day subway travel for &yen;500. On weekdays, the ''One-Day Card'' allows the same, but costs &yen;800.  There is also a ''Bus and Subway Transfer One-Day Card'', which allows unlimited 1-day travel on buses, subways, and streetcars (&yen;1000).  Fares for children are about half those for adults.

===By streetcar===
A streetcar of relatively little utility to most visitors trundles around the southwestern side of Sapporo, connecting to the subway at Susukino. Its most important stops are probably the Chuo Library (Main Public Library in Sapporo) and the Mt. Moiwa Ropeway. It's most useful in winter, when walking the icy footpaths to get to the library or otherwise less-accessible south-western areas of the city becomes quite treacherous. Single-trip tickets are &yen;170. They also sell a "Do-san-ko Pass" on weekends and holidays which allows you to ride all you want for a day for &yen;300. Since this is less than the cost of 2 normal trips, it is usually advisable to buy this if you are going to make a round trip on an eligible day.

===By car===
You could try to drive in the city, but parking might be problematic.  Generally speaking, using the subways and buses is recommended.  There are countless pay parking lots in Sapporo.  One of the largest ones is about 100m south of the Susukino South Toyoko Inn, and it's a short walk from the subway.

* <see name="Clock Tower" alt="時計台 Tokeidai" address="" directions="Close to Odori Station." phone="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="&yen;200">This rather diminutive building has become a symbol of Sapporo, mostly by being the oldest building still standing. It was constructed in 1878 for the Sapporo Agricultural College (now the Hokkaido University) and would not look out of place in "Smalltown U.S.A." Inside you'll find a small retrospective of the Clock Tower's history. Visitor beware, as this is - for some reason - a mecca for Japanese tourists coming to Sapporo who feel that no trip to Sapporo would be complete without a photo in front of the Tokeidai (Clock Tower); it was actually recently rated as Japan's third "most disappointing" tourist attraction!</see>

Also there are two restaurants, a souvenir store, and an hourly robot show complete with annoying music. Famous for its white chocolate, which is sold under the brand "White Lovers" (白い恋人 ''shiroi koibito''), and is only available in Hokkaido. There is also a cake buffet available at the restaurant on the top floor for "&yen;1,500" but reservations must be made 3 days in  advance. The chocolate factory is closed due to renovations until 12 June 2019 —don’t find out the hard way! </see>

* <see name="Odori Park" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="" email="" fax="">Sapporo's most famous park. It is in the center of town and is considered to be a symbol of Sapporo. Although quite narrow (one might argue that it is a nice boulevard), the park is quite long, stretching over fifteen blocks across downtown Sapporo. Filled with numerous flowers, trees, and fountains during the summer, Odori Park provides a welcome respite from the maddening crowds of the surrounding city. In the winter there is a festival called the Sapporo snow festival which is held every year at the Odori Park.</see>

Don't expect costumed performers however &mdash; everything is self-guided. An English map is available. Accessible from Shin-Sapporo station on Sapporo's Tozai line, but it should be noted that the park is far. Taking the bus to "Kaitaku-no-mura" is recommended for those with the combination day pass, but there aren't many buses. Buses only come at 8:23, 9:05, 9:52, 10:26, 10:52, 11:18, 12:18, 13:18 and 14:18. If one visits in the summertime, s/he could easily spend several hours looking around.

* <do name="Sapporo Snow Festival" alt="雪祭り　Yuki Matsuri" address="" directions="" phone="" url="http://www.snowfes.com/english/index.html" hours="Early Feb" price="" lat="" long="">This is Sapporo's largest event.  The festival is best known for the '''ice sculpture competition''' attracting artists from around the world, competing to create the largest and most elaborate artworks from ice and snow.  The festival is focused on Odori Koen, in the centre of Sapporo. It consists of a combination of large-scale replicas and artistic sculptures; children-aimed attractions; and a separate section for world-wide competitors (where you can see a wide range of smaller artistic sculptures). The festival should be enjoyed both in the day -- but particularly at night when the sculptures (especially the larger ones) are lit up. When the weather is warmer and there's a bit of melting, the smaller sculptures are literally remade every night to ensure that they are in perfect condition the next day.  Book accommodation early, because Sapporo gets booked out during the festival.</do>

==Buy==

For those living in Japan who have an ''omiyage'' (souvenir) obligation to fill in your Japanese office when you return from your Hokkaido holiday, the best ''omiyage'' to buy in Sapporo is the ubiquitous ''Shiroi Koibito'' (白い恋人, "White Lovers"). It is a chocolate slice sandwiched in two wafers of sweet biscuit, individually wrapped and available boxed in a range of different quantities &mdash; tasty enough, but rather bland, and few Westerners would associate the taste with Japan.  The original flavour is white chocolate sandwiched in plain sweet biscuit, but there is also a dark chocolate version.  It's available in every souvenir store in the city (try the Sapporo JR area or Tanuki Koji Shopping Arcade when shopping for souvenirs), and also most souvenir stores around the island.

Being a wintery kind of place for a good part of each year, Sapporo also has many stores selling all manner of snow goods. At the beginning and end of each season, many good deals on the previous year's gear can be found, often at discounts of up to 60% off, sometimes more! Also, there are several sports recycle stores in the city and suburbs where good deals on barely-used gear can be found, thanks to the Japanese fondness for having new gear every season. Ask Tourist Information to help you locate sports recycle and snow-goods stores.

* <buy name="Nijō Ichiba" alt="二条市場" address="South 2-3, East 1-2" directions="5 min from Odori Stn" phone="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="7AM-6PM" price="">Sapporo's equivalent to Tokyo's famed Tsukiji Fish Market, this is where the best of Hokkaido's catch is traded &mdash; and like its Tokyo counterpart, there are many restaurants here offering top-quality, cut-price sushi and sashimi.  Popular with locals and tourists alike.</buy>

==Eat==
Sapporo is famous for '''hairy crab''' (毛蟹 ''kegani''), an expensive treat available at any seafood restaurant, and '''miso ramen''' (味噌ラーメン), a more affordable local variation of the ubiquitous noodle dish with ''miso'' paste added to the stock.  The ramen in particular will warm you up nicely on a chilly winter day.   Sapporo '''soup curry''' (just what it sounds like) is also increasingly famous.

As elsewhere in Hokkaido, you can also enjoy dairy products (milk, cheese, butter, chocolate and ice cream), seafood (especially as sushi), fruits (honeydew melon, strawberries) and meat (sausages, ham, bacon and beef).

'''Kuwanomi''' (mulberry) is a popular fruit in Souen. This berry is red or black in color and sweet.  Preserved ''kuwanomi'' can be made into jam, which is a traditional food.  In elementary schools, students make kuwanomi jam every year.

==Drink==
The drink of choice when in Sapporo is obviously '''Sapporo Beer''', and a good option for this is the Beer Museum (see [[#See|See]]).
'''Susukino''' (すすきの), to the south of the center, is one of Japan's largest nightlife (and red-light) districts, originally created to keep labourers in [[Hokkaido]].

The owner, Yasuharu Kawai, used to run hostels in Ireland and Australia, and be a cook and a coffee barista, so he knows how to make a really, REALLY good cup of coffee, from espresso or drip coffee.  He also is pretty humble about his coffee making skills, but you can have a long informational conversation if you're into that type of hobby too.  As for his hostel, everything is brand new and in great shape; the showers are new and clean, the rooms are all new and clean, and he was pretty clever in designing and building the bunk beds to be be big and have private lights, curtains, and a shoe drawer.  I would say if you ever enjoy your stay at Hostel 64 in Osaka or Nui in Tokyo, you'd probably like this place.

==Get out==
* [[Otaru]], approximately 60 minutes by car (shorter by expressway). A very pleasant small town located on the coast, and famous (within Japan) for its attractive canal which is very European in design. Also famous for its seafood, music box museum (with associated tourist shop) and glass works. Also famous for being the setting of the movie Love Letter.
* [[Niseko]], arguably Japan's top destination for powder skiing and snowboarding, is two hours away by bus.
* The hot springs and mossy canyons of [[Shikotsu-Toya National Park]] are within easy striking distance of Sapporo.
* [[Asahikawa]]'s Asahiyama Zoo [http://www5.city.asahikawa.hokkaido.jp/asahiyamazoo/zoo/English/top.html] is the most famous and most visited zoo in Japan, even though it's in the middle of nowhere (at least a two-hour trip from Sapporo). Its most famous exhibits are the penguins which walk around the park twice a day (THE must see for all the Japanese who find this immensely cute), and the seals that you can see swim vertically through a large transparent pipe. It also features polar bears, wolves, Japanese deers, big cats, different kinds of monkeys and more. It's most impressive in winter when it's covered in snow (have you ever seen a giraffe walking in snow?!) but a few of the exhibits are also closed during this season.
