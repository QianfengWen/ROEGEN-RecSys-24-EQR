'''Glasgow''' is the biggest city in [[Scotland]], with a population more than 600,000 in the city itself, or over 2 million if the surrounding towns of the Clydeside conurbation are taken into account. Located at the west end of Scotland's [[Central Belt of Scotland|Central Belt]] on the banks of the River Clyde, Glasgow's historical importance as Scotland's main industrial center has been challenged by decades of change and various regeneration efforts. The third largest city in the entire United Kingdom (by population), it remains one of the nation's key economic centers outside London.

==Understand==
Glasgow has been awarded the European titles of City of Culture (1990), City of Architecture and Design (1999), and Capital of Sport (2003). In 2008, Glasgow became the second Scottish city to join the [[UNESCO Creative Cities]] initiative when it was named a UNESCO City of Music (joining [[Bologna]] and [[Seville]]). In preparing its bid, Glasgow counted an average of 130 music events a week ranging from pop and rock to Celtic music and opera. 

The city has transformed itself from being the once mighty powerhouse of industrial Britain to a center for commerce, tourism, and culture. Glasgow was the host city for the Commonwealth Games in 2014. 

Glasgow has become one of the most visited cities in the British Isles, and visitors will find a revitalized city center, the best shopping outside London without a doubt, excellent parks and museums (most of which are free), and easy access to the Highlands and Islands.

===Defining Glasgow===
The term “Glasgow” in itself can be ambiguous.  Various boundary changes over the years have blurred the distinction between the actual ''City of Glasgow'' administrative area, and ''Greater Glasgow''; the contiguous metropolitan area which occupies much of the lower Clyde Valley with the city itself at its core, and surrounding burghs such as Rutherglen, Bearsden, Milngavie and Clydebank, all of which still fall under the Glasgow postcode area and 0141 telephone code.  Residents of these areas are often still fiercely defensive of their home towns and may or may not identify themselves as “Glaswegian”, but since many of the city's attractions fall within these areas, for the tourist, they may be considered one and the same.

===History===
The area around Glasgow has hosted communities for millennia, with the River Clyde providing a natural location for fishing. The Romans later built outposts in the area and, to keep Roman Britannia separate from the Gaelic and Pictish Caledonia, constructed the Antonine Wall, the remains of which can still be seen in Glasgow today. Glasgow itself was founded by the Christian missionary Saint Mungo in the 6th century. He established a church on the Molendinar Burn, where the present Glasgow Cathedral stands, and in the following years, Glasgow became a religious center. Its name is derived from the Gaelic ''Glas chu'' which translates literally as "green hollow"; over the centuries this has become romanticized to mean "dear green place" which is often cited as a nickname for the city.

By the 16th century, the city's trades and craftsmen had begun to wield significant influence and the city had become an important trading center with the Clyde providing access to the city and the rest of Scotland for merchant shipping. The access to the Atlantic Ocean allowed the importation of American tobacco and cotton, and Caribbean sugar, which were then traded throughout the United Kingdom and Europe.

The de-silting of the Clyde in the 1770s allowed bigger ships to move further up the river, thus laying the foundations for industry and shipbuilding in Glasgow during the 19th century. The abundance of coal and iron in Lanarkshire led to Glasgow becoming an industrial city, and it eventually came to be known as "the Second City of the Empire". Cotton factories and textile mills became large employers in Glasgow and the local region. Trading allowed Glasgow to become one of the richest cities in the world, and the merchants constructed spectacular buildings and monuments and reinvested their money in industrial development, a municipal public transport system, parks, museums, and libraries.  As the city's wealth increased, its center expanded westwards as the lush Victorian architecture of what is now known as the Merchant City area began to spring up. As this new development took place, the focus of Glasgow's central area moved away from its medieval origins at High Street, Trongate, Saltmarket, and Rottenrow, and these areas fell into partial dereliction, something which is in places still evident to the present day.

However, the city's industrial dominance would eventually come to an end. Glasgow did not escape the effects of the Great Depression, and though the outbreak of the second world war temporarily arrested the ongoing decline, the period after the war saw the greatest decline in its industrial base. Although ships and trains were still being built on Clydeside (as of today, only three major shipyards remain on the River Clyde, two of which are owned by BAE Systems Naval Ships), cheap labor abroad reduced the competitiveness of Glasgow's industries. By the 1960s, Glasgow had gone into economic decline, and Glasgow's function as a port diminished with the introduction of containerized freight.

Facing a future without the dominant heavy industries which had brought it much wealth in the past, the city began to depopulate the overcrowded center, dispersing the population to outer areas and new towns and building new motorways in order to allow a new service-based economy to flourish. The infamous tenement slums (many of which had been destroyed or badly damaged by wartime bombs) were replaced by a new generation of high-rise housing and large suburban housing estates (known locally as "schemes"). Whilst the hundreds of new tower blocks changed the city's skyline forever, the high-rise edifices broke up long-established community relationships and social structures. Coupled with poor design and low-quality construction, some of the blocks created as many problems as they solved and became magnets for crime and deprivation.

Since the 1980s, Glasgow has been rebuilding both its image and its architecture, with extensive efforts to clean and refurbish surviving tenement flats, redevelop the western end of the central area into a financial district, and host renowned festivals. Glasgow now boasts the largest contemporary art scene in the UK outside of London, which is centered around the annual 'Glasgow International arts festival. Glasgow was a host city for the 2014 Commonwealth Games.

===Dialect===
The speed of the conversation tends to be quite quick in Glasgow. If necessary, ask people to repeat (even slowly!) what they are saying, Glaswegians are generally very friendly and able to communicate in far more formal English than that which is commonly used if it is required.
Standing on a city center street corner with a map in the daytime is usually a cue for passing Glaswegians to offer help in finding your way.

As with all areas of Scotland, regional dialects are present in Glasgow. The Glaswegian dialect of Scots or "patter" as the more jovial version of it is known, has evolved over the history of the city. As each wave of migration takes place, new words and phrases are added to the Glaswegian "patter". There is a strong Celtic language connection due to the Lowland Scots, Highland Gaelic, and Irish Gaelic influences. 

Some phrases
*"Wean" (pronounced "wayne") - child (Derived from wee-one, meaning small one)
*"Wee" - small
*"Aye" - yes
*"Bam" or "bampot" or "bamstick" - an impolite term for a silly or annoying person
*"Eejit" - an impolite term for a person who has done an incredibly stupid thing- an idiot
*"Tumshie"  - a silly person
*"Pure (brilliant)" - Very
*"Minging" - bad smelling or bad tasting; similarly a "minger" refers to an ugly person. Can also be used to denote drunkenness; "Ah wis well mingin' on Friday."
*"Midden" - an old Scots word for a waste dump, but commonly used to describe anything that is untidy or unkempt.
*"Haw" - roughly equivalent to "Hey" and used to attract someone's attention
*"(to give) pelters" - to humiliate someone
*"Ned" - Nicely described by popular backronym "non-educated delinquent". Typically teenage youths can be spotted sporting tracksuits, drinking cheap alcohol, and wearing "bling" jewelry, as well as bright white trainers (sneakers), soccer socks (kneesocks) scrunched down, and a baseball cap, usually from the brand Burberry. Many neds are aggressive. You'll do well to avoid them.
*"Buckie" - Real name is Buckfast, a "tonic wine" (this indicates its fortified alcohol content and not any medicinal value.) It is relatively cheap and purple in color.
*"Glaikit" - This means someone is dim or has a blank expression on their face. "When I asked him what 13 divided by 11,212.189 was he looked pure glaikit."
*"Teuchter" - A slang word for a Highlander, or anyone from the North of Scotland - often used in a derogatory context. Pronounced like a choker.
*"Gallus" - Means someone is cocky, cheeky, or self-confident
*"Bolt" - go away, as in "leave me alone" - kind of means "run" so tends to be used in a slightly aggressive context
*"Besom" - a cheeky or 'bold' woman.
*"Manky" - unclean, filthy
*"Baltic" - Really cold as in 'The Baltic Sea'.
*"Mental" - Pretty much a synonym for crazy.
*"Pished" or "Mad wae it" - drunk or intoxicated.
Glasgow slang is also peppered with various more or less meaningless phrases such as 'by the way', 'man', or 'dead' (very, as an adjective) that can give the answers to simple questions an almost baroque complexity. So "Did you enjoy the concert last night?" might be answered "Aye it was a pure dead brilliant man" which means, essentially, "Yes, it was good".

For the visitor, central Glasgow can be divided into two main areas, the '''City Centre''', which contains the majority of tourist sights and much of the city's shopping and entertainment, as well as its commercial heart, and the '''West End''', the bohemian area of cafés, restaurants and bars surrounding the University of Glasgow and Kelvingrove Museum.  The best way to get good vistas of the city is to climb the many "drumlins" (hills) upon which the central area is built.

Outside of central Glasgow, the '''East End''' lies east of the City Centre centered along Gallowgate and London Road. The '''South Side''' contains the neighborhoods that lie to the south of the River Clyde, while the '''North Side''' is the area north of central Glasgow. Along the banks of the River Clyde west of the City Centre is an old industrial area that is in the process of regeneration and contains many new and impressive structures, such as the Clyde Auditorium, the Science Centre, and the Riverside Museum.

====City Centre====
The City Centre (known as "town" or "the toon" to locals) is bounded by the M8 motorway to the north and west, High Street to the east, and the River Clyde to the south. This is the area where most visitors will start, and the most notable elements are the grid plan of streets and the lavish Victorian and Edwardian buildings and civic squares which give the area much of its character.  The main arteries of the City Centre are '''Argyle Street''' and '''Sauchiehall Street''' which both run on an east-west axis. They are linked by '''Buchanan Street''' which runs north-south. Together, these three streets form the main shopping thoroughfares.

The eastern side of the City Centre is a sub-district known as '''Merchant City''', which contains Glasgow's original medieval core, centered around the Glasgow Cross (the junction of Trongate, Saltmarket, High Street, Gallowgate, and London Road). Merchant City extends up to George Square, with many ornate buildings that date back to Glasgow's emergence as an industrial city. '''High Street''' north of the Glasgow Cross is the main artery of Old Glasgow and leads uphill to the Glasgow Cathedral and the Necropolis cemetery.

The western area of the City Centre contains the city's core commercial and business district and is dominated by '''Blythswood Hill''', which is centered around Blythswood Square. Running parallel to Sauchiehall Street, '''Bath Street''' is the main route into the neighborhood and has a rich mix of independent shops and bars, as well as distinctive Georgian townhouse-style architecture. South of Blythswood Hill is the city's financial district, with many modern glass and steel office buildings which stand alongside their classical counterparts. Further south, on the north bank of the River Clyde is the district of '''Anderston''', formerly a dockland area, badly scarred by the city's industrial decline and the urban regeneration schemes of the 1960s but now being redeveloped as a residential and commercial area.

====West End====
To the west of the City Centre, no official definition of where the West End boundary line exists, but it can roughly be defined as being bounded by the M8 motorway to the east, Great Western Road to the north, the River Clyde to the South and Crow Road to the west. The nucleus of the area is undoubtedly the neo-Gothic '''University of Glasgow''', which acts as the anchor for this bohemian district, with its lovely architecture, tree-lined streets, and quaint shopping areas.

The primary east-west artery is '''Argyle Street'''/'''Dumbarton Road''', while '''Byres Road''' is the main north-south artery and contains a number of independent shops, bars, and restaurants. '''Ashton Lane''' connects Byres Road to the University campus and is a cobbled backstreet with distinctive whitewashed buildings, holding an eclectic mix of bars and eateries that make it a tourist hotspot (be careful as the Lane can be a bit of a tourist trap during the summer months when the students of the university are not there to keep the bar prices reasonable).  To the east of the university campus and just downhill is Kelvingrove Park, with the tree-lined '''Kelvin Way''' as the main avenue through the park, which connects with Argyle Street near the Kelvingrove Museum.

===By plane===
Glasgow is served by two main airports close to the city, which are Glasgow International Airport and Glasgow Prestwick International Airport. Edinburgh Airport is approximately 40 miles away. 

* '''Glasgow International Airport''' [https://www.glasgowairport.com/] ({{IATA|GLA}}). It is located 8 miles west of the center of Glasgow near the towns of Paisley and Renfrew, this is the city's principal airport and the main direct long haul and transatlantic entry airport into Scotland. There are regular scheduled UK and European destinations, and holiday charters, and the airport is the hub for the Scottish island network operated by Loganair[http://www.loganair.co.uk/]. United Airlines[http://www.united.com/] operate a daily service from [[New York City|New York]] (Newark), while Emirates[http://www.emirates.com] operate 2 daily flights from [[Dubai]]. If you are entering the United Kingdom via London, British Airways[http://www.ba.com/] operates frequent shuttle flights to Glasgow Airport throughout the day from both Heathrow and Gatwick. British Airways also operates a regular business shuttle from London City Airport, although it can be considerably more expensive than flying from Heathrow or Gatwick. Cheaper fares are sometimes available if you book via a price comparison site, rather than going to BA direct. Alternatively, KLM[http://www.klm.com] flies regularly to Glasgow from [[Amsterdam]]-Schiphol, which connects with a wide range of international destinations. Lufthansa[https://www.lufthansa.com/] also fly from their hubs in Frankfurt and Munich. EasyJet flies from Luton, Stansted, Gatwick, and many other European cities, and Ryanair[http://www.ryanair.com/] flies from [[Dublin]] and a number of Eastern European destinations.  

The quickest route to the city center is by taking the Glasgow Airport Express[https://www.firstbus.co.uk/greater-glasgow/routes-and-maps/glasgow-airport-express] bus from outside the terminal building. The bus serves both major train stations in Glasgow as well as Buchanan Bus Station, taking between 15-25 minutes, the service runs 24 hours a day up to every 10 minutes. Tickets cost £9 single and £14.80 return(buy on the bus), group and family tickets are also available. First Bus also runs the route 77 service, which runs every 30 minutes during the day to Buchanan Bus Station via Braehead and Partick. Whilst this service is slightly cheaper it will take you over 60 minutes to reach the city center. 

The slowest, but cheapest, option is to use McGill's bus 757[http://www.mcgillsbuses.co.uk/mcgills-bus-timetables/757-paisley-to-glasgow-airport.aspx] operating every 30 minutes to Paisley Gilmour Street train station, where up to 10 trains an hour run to Glasgow Central in as little as ten minutes. You can buy a train ticket which covers both the train and bus to/from the airport from Scotrail ticket offices and onboard trains. When arriving at the airport you can purchase this by using the Scotrail ticket machine in the arrivals area. A single from Glasgow Central to/from the airport costs £3.80. 

Taxis are also available from outside the terminal building, a journey into the city center will take around 15-20 minutes and cost you in the region of £20.

Glasgow International Airport has 2 terminals. All passengers arrive in the first terminal arrivals hall. The first terminal is used for all airlines except for Jet2 and Ryanair which use Terminal 2 for check-in. Glasgow Airport also has 2 prayer rooms: one in the second set of departure gates and the other in the arrivals hall. Be aware that there are 3 customs "channels". The blue channel is for EU arrivals, EEA Countries, and Switzerland. All other nationals should enter through the green channel. The airport generally never gets overcrowded except at check-in and security.

* '''Glasgow Prestwick International Airport'''[http://www.glasgowprestwick.com/]. ({{IATA|PIK}}). This is about 50&nbsp;km southwest of Glasgow on the Ayrshire coast is the city's secondary airport and is only served by Ryanair (see [[Discount airlines in Europe]]). Ryanair flies into Prestwick from a variety of Mediterranean resorts, which are mostly seasonal.

The airport has its own railway station, with four trains per hour to Glasgow Central Monday-Saturday and 2 per hour on Sundays (show your flight paperwork to get a £4.40 half-price ticket; the journey takes around 45min). All trains from Ayr call at the airport. The A77/M77 roads run directly from Prestwick into the center of Glasgow if you intend to drive.

The X77 bus also runs from the airport to Buchanan Bus Station throughout the day and crucially covers the times (early morning and late evening) when the trains are not running.

*'''Edinburgh International Airport''' [http://www.edinburghairport.com/]. ({{IATA|EDI}}). Although not an immediately obvious choice, the capital's airport is easily accessible from Glasgow since it is on the western edge of Edinburgh, approximately 60km away and about an hour's drive via the M8 motorway. Useful as both Ryanair and Easyjet have a number of European routes that are not available from either Glasgow International or Prestwick.

The airport is linked to Glasgow by Citylink[http://www.citylink.co.uk/index.php] buses twenty-four hours a day. A direct Citylink Air bus service runs from the airport to Buchanan Bus Station approximately every 30 minutes during the day, with the N900 bus serving the airport hourly during the night with journeys taking 60 minutes. Glasgow can also easily be reached from the airport via a connecting tram or bus to Haymarket railway station - all trains from Glasgow call here. See the main [[Edinburgh]] article for more details.

===By train===
[[Image:Glasgow centralstation.jpg|thumb|Glasgow Central Station - the northern terminus of the West Coast Main Line from London]]

''Wikitravel has a guide to [[Rail travel in the United Kingdom]]''

Glasgow has two mainline railway stations. Trains from the south of Scotland, the city's southern suburbs, and all long-distance trains from [[England]] arrive at '''Central Station''' (officially known as '''Glasgow Central'''), while shuttle trains from Edinburgh and anywhere north of Glasgow arrive at '''Queen Street Station'''. Both stations are divided into a "High Level" (for main line inter-city services) and a subterranean "Low Level" (for local suburban services) - you will see this distinction being mentioned in timetables.

Both Central and Queen Street stations have left luggage lockers. The stations are an easy ten-minute walk apart and the route is well signposted, or there's a frequent shuttle bus between them, which is free if you are holding a thorough railway ticket otherwise a fare of 50p is charged if you don't.

Most trains within Scotland are run by ''ScotRail''. 

====From Edinburgh====
Confusingly, there are four rail routes between the capital and Glasgow's two mainline terminals. An off-peak return costs £13.60, regardless of which route you use, a peak return(travel before 9am and between 4:45pm and 6:30pm) is £26.20. A single ticket will cost you £15.30(peak) or £13.40(off-peak). If traveling on Scotrail services up to four children can travel for £1 return each when traveling with an adult if you buy in person at the ticket office. In summary, the four routes are as follows - all depart from both Waverley and Haymarket stations:

* '''Fastest:''' ''ScotRail Express'' via Falkirk High into Queen Street (High Level) - every 15 min on weekdays and Saturdays until 19:45, half hourly outside these times. The journey time is around 45 minutes.   

* '''Faster:''' ''CrossCountry'' trains via Motherwell into Central (High Level) - trains originating from Penzance, Plymouth, Bristol, or Birmingham make the journey every 2 hours throughout the day - journey time approx 1 hour. CrossCountry services have the cheapest walk-up fares between the two cities, of £9.80 for an Anytime single and £12.90 for an Anytime Day Return. ''London North Eastern Railway'' also runs one service a day in each direction via this route.

* '''Slow:''' ''ScotRail'' services via Bathgate and Airdrie into '''Queen Street''' (Low Level) en route to [[Milngavie]] or [[Helensburgh]] Central - 4 trains per hour on weekdays & Saturdays until 20:00, half hourly outside these times. Journey time is around 70-75 minutes. ScotRail normally recommends that travelers use this route if there is a major disruption to the main shuttle service or to relieve pressure on it if large passenger numbers are expected due to events being held in either city. ''Scotrail'' also runs one semi-fast service via Shotts an hour Monday-Saturday into Central (High Level), these take around 70 minutes and only stop at Bellshill, Shotts, Livingston, and West Calder. '''Not''' to be confused with the stopping services via Shotts described below. 
* '''Very Slow:''' ''ScotRail'' stopping services via Shotts or Carstairs and Motherwell into '''Central''' (High Level) - every hour, journey time around 90min. Scotrail also runs services into Queen Street (High Level) via Cumbernauld, these trains run every 30 minutes Monday-Saturday, and the journey time is 75-80 minutes.

====From London and the South====
Glasgow can be reached from London by either the West Coast or East Coast main lines. The quality and reliability of the rail services have improved a lot over the years, and it can be cheaper and almost as fast as flying once the time spent traveling to airports with their associated security hassles is taken into account.

* '''Faster:'''  ''Avanti West Coast''[https://www.avantiwestcoast.co.uk/] run an hourly service from London Euston via the West Coast route. The journey time is 4h30. Avanti also runs a slower 2 hourly service via Birmingham with a journey time of 5h30. Single one-way fares can be found as low as £20.00 is booked up to 12 weeks in advance, rising to £105 for an off-peak single. Open off-peak return £151.

* '''Slower:''' ''London North Eastern Railway''[https://www.lner.co.uk/] run 1 direct train a day from London King's Cross to Glasgow Central via the East Coast route (taking in [[York]] and [[Newcastle]] also). LNER also operates an at least hourly service from London to [[Edinburgh]] throughout the day, which connects with Scotrail services to Glasgow  (see above). Journey time 5h45-6h30 (if connecting at Edinburgh). Single one-way fares start at £21.00 one way if booked on-line and up to 12 weeks in advance. Open off-peak returns are the same as for Avanti West Coast.

* '''Overnight:''' The ''Caledonian Sleeper''[http://www.sleeper.scot/] is an overnight sleeper train that runs every night except Saturday to/from London Euston via the West Coast route. The journey takes approximately 8 hours, although is deliberately scheduled for a late departure and a reasonable arrival time. Tickets can be booked in the usual manner at any mainline railway station in Britain or online: the cost of a return journey from London to Glasgow varies depending on the type of accommodation you choose. There are three types of berth; a single room, a twin room and there are also some double rooms. Some have an en-suite with a shower, these will cost a further premium. There is also a seated carriage available and tickets for travel in this are much cheaper than using a berth. Certain BritRail passes can be used to buy tickets on the Sleeper trains, but supplements are payable for the berth: check before leaving your home country.

====Within Scotland====
Apart from the Edinburgh shuttles, the key inter-city rail routes to Glasgow from elsewhere in Scotland are as follows:

* [[Aberdeen]] and [[Dundee]] (via [[Perth (Scotland)|Perth]]): Hourly into Queen Street (High Level) throughout the day. Journey time to Aberdeen is between 2h30-2h45.
* [[Inverness]] (via Perth): Every two hours into Queen Street (High Level) throughout the day. The journey time is around 3h15.
* [[Stirling]]: 3 trains an hour (Monday-Saturday, 2 an hour on Sundays) into Queen Street (High Level) throughout the day. The journey time is around 30 minutes.
* [[Oban]], [[Fort William]], and [[Mallaig]] via the [[West Highland Railway]]: Up to five trains per day into Queen Street (High Level). In addition, the overnight sleeper train from Fort William to London Euston calls at Queen Street (Low Level) to let off passengers in the late evening. 
* [[Stranraer]]: One train per day into Central (High Level). There is a 2 hourly service to Ayr from Stranraer with connections available to Glasgow from there. The journey time is around 2h20.
* [[Ayr]] (via Prestwick Airport, Troon, and Kilwinning): 4 trains an hour (Monday-Saturday, half-hourly on Sundays) into Central (High Level). Journey times are between 50-60 minutes.

====Other Rail Services====
All national inter-city routes operate into Central (High Level).

''Avanti West Coast'' operate direct services to/from [[Birmingham]] New Street every two hours, these trains continue on to London Euston. The journey time to Birmingham is just over 4 hours.

''Transpennine Express'' [http://www.tpexpress.co.uk/] operate a 2 hourly service to Glasgow from [[Manchester]] Airport and Manchester Piccadilly. Journey time is around 3h20. They also run a few services a day to [[Liverpool]] Lime Street, the journey time is around 3h30.

''CrossCountry'' operate trains every 2 hours to Glasgow from [[Edinburgh]], [[Newcastle]], [[York]], [[Sheffield]] and [[Birmingham]] New Street with some services continuing on to [[Bristol]], [[Plymouth]] and [[Penzance]].

===By bus===
Virtually all long-distance[http://www.travelinescotland.com/], and some short-distance, buses serving Glasgow arrive at the '''Buchanan Bus Station''' (''in the city center, close to Buchanan Street and Queen Street train station''). 

Scottish Citylink[http://www.citylink.co.uk/] and Megabus[http://uk.megabus.com/] jointly operate the long-distance routes throughout Scotland to Glasgow. You may be put on a Citylink bus when you hold a Megabus reservation and vice versa. There are frequent departures from [[Perth]], [[Dundee]], [[Aberdeen]], and [[Inverness]], with tickets costing as little as £1 when bought in advance on the Megabus website. Citylink also operates 'Gold' services from Inverness and Aberdeen which provide more comfort and free drinks/snacks are available on board.

Citylink operates the 900 bus service from [[Edinburgh]], which runs up to every 15 minutes during the day. Buses from Edinburgh operate twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, with the night service also serving Edinburgh Airport. The journey time is 1h20 and tickets can be bought on board the bus for £8.50 single and £10 return.

National Express[https://www.nationalexpress.com/] and Megabus are the main operators on routes from destinations across the rest of the UK. 

Bus and ferry tickets from [[Dublin]], [[Derry]], and [[Belfast]] can be obtained through Scottish Citylink or National Express, in addition to Ulsterbus[http://www.translink.co.uk/] for the latter two. There are also direct buses to Glasgow from Eastern Europe (mostly [[Poland]]), these operators come and go.

Note that the station is huge and very confusing, so you might have to ask for directions.

Some short-distance buses, particularly those from [[Helensburgh]] and [[Balloch]], terminate on Osbourne Street, near the St. Enoch Shopping Centre.

===By car===
[[Image:sunset_glasgow_kingstonbrid.jpg|thumb|Sunset over Kingston Bridge]]
The main approaches to Glasgow are:
*from England on the M74 motorway; Glasgow is about 150km north of the border
*from Edinburgh (east) or Glasgow Airport (west) on the M8 motorway
*from [[Stirling]] and all points north and east on the M80 motorway
*from the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] on the A82 road

====Parking====
On-street parking in both the City Centre and West End is limited and expensive, metered bays are available at the side of the road and you pay at an adjacent machine and display a ticket in your windscreen or dashboard. The prices are typically £0.30-0.40 (depending on location) for every 12 min. In general, parking charges are levied M-Sa (this INCLUDES public holidays) and free after 18:30 and all day Sundays. But always check what the controlled hours are - these are shown on the ticket machines themselves and on adjacent signs. If attempting to park during the free periods - get there as early as possible before the locals do. Some parking areas are for residents only - DON'T be tempted to use them as you run the risk of being towed away!

There are many multi-story car parks in the city center; they have clearly signposted into "East", "West", "North" and "South" zones on all the approaches into the central area with an electronic display showing how many spaces are left in each. They don't however differentiate between the expensive NCP ones and the cheaper ones inside shopping malls or run by the council. 

Park and Ride facilities are limited in Glasgow. Three different Park and Ride facilities can be found on the subway network: at Bridge Street (159 spaces), Kelvinbridge (150 spaces), and Shields Road (800 spaces). The cost of parking at each of these locations is £5 per day, which includes a return subway ticket. For those who already have a Subway season or multi-journey ticket, the charge is £2.40 per day.
Some of the suburban railway stations also have small car parks. A bus park-and-ride is due to open shortly near Hampden Park which allows easy access from junction 1A of the M74.

In general, driving in Glasgow's central area should be avoided if you are not a confident driver, as there are one-way systems, bus lanes, and pedestrian precincts. Glaswegians are not the most patient drivers in the world, and they particularly dislike hesitancy (taxi drivers being the worst culprits). Parking restrictions are strictly enforced, and vehicles parked illegally or in an obstructive manner will be towed away and the owner of the vehicle will be liable for a £150 release charge to recover it.   

'''As of May 2012, the city has introduced license plate recognition cameras and extra manned patrols on the bus lanes within the city center, getting caught will incur a £30 fixed penalty!'''

If, however, you are confident enough to hire a car or require it to save money on your travel, all the major rental companies and some lesser ones are at the airport. You should book your car rental in advance to avoid disappointment and can do so from price comparison companies such as Glasgow Airport Car Hire[http://www.logancarhire.com/]. Visitors from the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] should note that car rental companies will allocate you a manual transmission car by default unless you specifically ask for an automatic one.

===By ferry===
[[Image:Clyde_Glasgow.jpg|thumb|River Clyde looking West towards SECC]]
'''From Ireland:''' P & O[http://www.poferries.com/en/] ferries from [[Larne]] and Stena Line[http://www.stenaline.co.uk/ferry/] ferries from the Port of [[Belfast]] operate to [[Cairnryan]]; six miles north of [[Stranraer]] and seventy-eight miles south of Glasgow. Cairnryan is linked to Stranraer by the 350 bus (which is timed to meet both the Belfast and Larne ferries), and thence by ScotRail train to Glasgow (a change of train may be required in [[Ayr]]). Alternatively, the 923 bus operates directly from Cairnryan to Glasgow.

Through train tickets are available from any railway station in the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]] to Glasgow via the ferry to Cairnryan, with bus connections from Belfast to the port and Cairnryan to Stranraer included in the fare. Fares start at £25 one way (£16.50 with a railcard) for [[Belfast]] to Glasgow (available on the day of travel from most railway stations), taking about five hours. Similarly, Citylink[http://www.citylink.co.uk/] sells inclusive coach and ferry tickets between [[Dublin]], [[Derry]], [[Belfast]], and Glasgow.

==Get around==
''Strathclyde Partnership for Transport'' [http://www.spt.co.uk/] (SPT) is the agency responsible for the local public transport network, which it describes as one of the most integrated and developed in the UK, not European standards. Nevertheless, Glasgow's public transport system is one of the most extensive in the UK outside of [[London]].

===By train===
'''Suburban trains'''[http://www.scotrail.co.uk/] radiate from Central and Queen Street stations to the suburbs and surrounding towns. The network is the largest in the UK outside of London, although there are only two trains per hour on some routes; others are much more frequent. You'll rarely be far from a train station if you are in the Greater Glasgow area. Central serves the dense suburban network which sprawls throughout the southern suburbs of the city, as well as outer suburban services to the Inverclyde and Ayrshire coasts. The underground lower-level platforms of both Central and Queen Street stations are hubs for the east-west electric network north of the river, which provide useful links to the West End (thus complementing the Subway) and further west to the northern Clyde coast towns of [[Dumbarton]], [[Helensburgh]] and [[Balloch]], the gateway to [[Loch Lomond]] and the Southern [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]]. More recently, the Low-Level line from Queen Street has been extended eastwards to the West Lothian towns of Bathgate and Livingston.

Bikes go free, and all trains have ample cycle space on board. The SPT Day Tripper ticket (explained below) gives you complete freedom of the network, and the Roundabout ticket (also explained below) gives off-peak freedom of the suburban train network within the city boundary only as well as the Subway.

===By subway===
[[Image:Glasgow-Subway-Map.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Glasgow Subway map]]
Glasgow's subway[http://www.spt.co.uk/subway/] runs in a double circle around the Glasgow city center and some inner suburbs. Contrary to what tourist guidebooks would have you believe, locals never call it the "Clockwork Orange" (that is a fantasy of the media) and most will refer to it simply as "the Subway". The system serves the city center, the West End (around Glasgow University), and Ibrox Stadium. There are interchanges with surface trains at Buchanan Street (linked to Queen Street) and Partick stations, with St Enoch being a short walk from Central.

The cost for a disposable ticket is £1.75 flat fare, £3.30 for two journeys, or £4.20 for one day's unlimited travel. Those intending to stay in the city for a period of time or intend to visit regularly can purchase an anonymous Smartcard at any subway station for £3. Smartcard fares are £1.55 flat fare, with a £3 daily cap. Weekly, monthly, 6-monthly, and yearly tickets are also available for Smartcard holders.

No bikes are allowed. As of 2018, wheelchairs are not conveyed on the Subway, however, a modernization program is underway so that wheelchair users can travel between St. Enoch and Govan from 2020 onwards.

Trains generally run every 4-8min from 06:30-23:45 (Sunday 10:00-18:12).

===By bus===
Buses go everywhere. '''First Glasgow'''[http://www.firstgroup.com/] is the main operator within the city boundary. There is a bus at least every 10min on main routes during the day, making it easy to get into the center of town, though getting out to a specific destination is less easy. However, services on many routes are much less frequent in the evening. In the city center, buses do not always stop at every stop on their route, so check the sign at the stop. Stops are clearly marked with the services that stop there.

First buses do not give change as the driver has no access to cash, however, all buses also accept payment by contactless card. If paying in hard cash, you put your money in a slot that checks the amount and deposits it in a storage box. An all-day ticket that can be used on any First bus costs £5.40 for the city zone or £7.25 for the entire First Glasgow network.  A weekly ticket costs £16.50 for the inner city or £19.50 for the whole wider network which can take you as far as, for example, [[Loch Lomond]]. Tickets can also be purchased through the First Bus App for less than the on-board fare.

Other bus operators within the city are '''McGill's'''[http://mcgillsbuses.co.uk/] and '''Stagecoach West Scotland''' [http://www.stagecoachbus.co.uk/] which operate services out to the outlying towns in Renfrewshire and Ayrshire respectively: note that the day/weekly passes bought on First buses will not be valid on these, with the exception of SPT Day Tripper and ZoneCards (explained below).

Unless you don't scare easily, it's best to avoid Glasgow buses heading out of town later than 22:00 on Friday or Saturday nights.

===By car===
Because of its compact size and extensive public transport system, it is not really necessary to drive around the center of Glasgow. In fact, for the visitor, driving in the central area can be a stressful and very slow experience thanks to the almost unfathomable one-way system (particularly in and around the business district around Blythswood Hill and Anderston), bus lanes (monitored by police cameras) and pedestrianized streets. Coupled with impatient and often aggressive drivers that don't make the best use of available lanes at the frustratingly long duration and frequent traffic lights, it is often better for your blood pressure and average journey times to get out and walk! Despite the distinctive American-style grid plan of streets (virtually unique among the UK's large cities), the city ''doesn't'' have the American street naming system, so visitors from the US and Canada, in particular, should note talking in the language of "blocks" to a local will only result in confusion.

===Fares===
''Strathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT)'' is the local agency that operates the subway and co-ordinates public transport in the Greater Glasgow area. SPT offers a number of different daily combined bus/rail travel tickets aimed at the visitor.

* '''Roundabout''' ticket gives complete freedom of the subway and the suburban rail network within the Greater Glasgow area, which includes the city boundary and most of the surrounding towns for £7.40 after 09:30 Monday to Friday and all day on Saturday and Sunday. Available to purchase at Scotrail ticket offices.

* '''Day Tripper''' ticket covers the entire Strathclyde rail network, which extends as far south as Barrhill in South Ayrshire, some 68&nbsp;mi south of Glasgow, and Ardlui at the northern tip of [[Loch Lomond]], some 40&nbsp;mi north on the [[West Highland Railway]]. It has the added advantage of being accepted by the subway, most bus operators in the Strathclyde region, and the Kilcreggan and Renfrew ferries. Two versions are available; for 1 adult and up to 2 children (£13.10) or 2 adults and up to 4 children (£23.20). You can buy it only from a staffed rail station, SPT Travel Centre, or online.

* If you are in town for a week or more, SPT's '''ZoneCard''' might be useful. It can be used on suburban trains, buses, and the underground and is valid all day, even in the morning. Prices vary depending on how long you want it for (1 week to 1 year) and how many zones that you want it to cover.

* '''SPT''' also has a Smartcard which is available to buy for £3 from all Subway stations. You can use this to buy tickets for the Subway, and Scotrail services throughout the whole of Scotland, as well as day tickets on McGill's buses.

===By taxi===
Like most major British cities, you have two options. Your first option is the traditional London-style black cabs which can be hailed from the side of the road (look out for the yellow "Taxi" sign being illuminated). The fleet is operated by ''Glasgow Taxis''[http://www.glasgowtaxis.co.uk/], and can also be ordered by telephone (+44 141 429-7070). There are taxi ranks outside Central and Queen Street railway stations, adjacent to George Square and along the southern end of Queen Street itself. There is also a taxi rank located at Buchanan Bus Station. For a journey from say the centre of town to the West End expect to pay around £5-£6, and from the city centre out to the suburbs around £10-£12. Be aware that some drivers will refuse to take you outside the city boundary, but some will if you offer a good price for them.

Your second option is by private hire or minicab. Unlike the black cabs, these cannot be hailed, and you must book by telephone. There is a myriad of private hire operators which are cheaper than black cabs: their phone numbers are clearly displayed on the back of the vehicles. Never use unlicensed private taxis, which can sometimes be seen touting for business outside nightclubs near closing time and near legitimate taxi ranks. Always look for the yellow Glasgow City Council license plate attached to the rear bumper of the vehicle if unsure. Glasgow Private Hire is one of the biggest taxi fleets in Europe and has thousands of cars, which service all areas of the city. They can be reached on a variety of different numbers (including +44 141 774-3000). Another popular alternative is Hampden Cabs, which services most of the city and surrounding area. Hampden Cabs can be contacted at +44 141 649-5050.

===By boat===
There is a ferry from Yoker on the north bank of the River Clyde to the town of Renfrew on the opposite bank which is within walking distance of Braehead shopping centre and the Xscape leisure complex. The Renfrew Ferry now carries only foot passengers and bicycles. It stopped carrying cars in 1984 after the Clyde Tunnel opened just a few miles upriver. Clydelink carries passengers on two smaller-sized ferries, MV Yoker Swan and MV Renfrew Rose. 

===By cycle===
Glasgow now offers a cycle hire scheme[http://www.nextbike.co.uk/en/glasgow/], which covers the city center and some of the inner suburbs. For a half-hourly charge (after registration), bicycles may be hired from automated hire stations around the city. The bikes can be unlocked and ridden around the city with a credit card and must be returned to another hire station by locking the bike into the rack.

===On foot===
The centre of Glasgow is very pedestrian-friendly with major shopping streets given over to foot traffic. As you move out of the city center, all areas have proper pavements, and most major junctions have pedestrian crossings. The River Clyde also has several foot bridge crossings. The main difficulty with walking out of the center of town is finding where the crossings over/under the M8 are. As you head west, some roads appear to go over Charing Cross only for the pavement to disappear. As you head north, the underpasses at Cowcaddens can sometimes feel unwelcoming.

===Architecture===
[[Image:Glasgow tradestonbridge.JPG|thumb|Tradeston Pedestrian Bridge, the "Squiggly Bridge"]]
[[Image:Glasgow citychambers.JPG|thumb|The City Chambers]]
As befits a city that was at its richest through the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th, the center of Glasgow has a fine legacy of Victorian and Edwardian buildings with their lavish interiors and spectacularly carved stonework.  Outside of the central area, the main streets are lined with the legendary tenements - the city's trademark 3 or 4-story residential buildings built from red or blonde sandstone which positively glow during the summer. The controversial ''Bruce Report'' of the late 1940s triggered a massive regeneration program that lasted into the late 1970s and saw huge swathes of tenement housing literally wiped out to make way for soulless housing estates and high-rise tower blocks, whilst, in the city center, many large concrete office buildings were built of often questionable architectural merit.  The few surviving examples worthy of note for those fans of Brutalist architecture are the massive twin 30-story Camlachie tower blocks in the East End (sadly scheduled for demolition in 2014), Sir Robert Matthew's Riverside estate in the Gorbals, and the gargantuan Anderston Centre by Sir Richard Seifert, close to the Kingston Bridge.  Many of these buildings are now being replaced by modern glass and steel structures - epitomized by the likes of the Radisson Hotel on Argyle Street and the new BBC Scotland building on Pacific Quay.

Glasgow was also the home of Charles Rennie Mackintosh, one of the "Glasgow Four," a group of leading proponents of art nouveau architecture. Indeed, during his lifetime, Mackintosh was probably better regarded abroad than he was in his native Glasgow, even apparently inspiring Frank Lloyd Wright, and was recently resurrected as one of the city's most beloved sons. As well as many fine originals and his ''magnum opus'', the Glasgow School of Art, many other knock-offs and impersonations exist. However, despite the 'cult' of Mackintosh, Glasgow produced many other fine architects, the best known of whom is probably Alexander 'Greek' Thomson. 

The following list is a selection of significant buildings in Glasgow, roughly arranged starting in the City Centre and moving west and south:
* <see name="Bridges" alt="" address="" directions="" lat="" long="" phone="" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">There are a number of interesting bridges over the River Clyde in the City Centre. The Tradeston Pedestrian Bridge crosses the river east of the M8 motorway and is nicknamed the "Squiggly Bridge" by locals because of its distinctive S-shape. Nearby, the Kingston Bridge carries the M8 motorway across the Clyde. Built-in 1969, the bridge is far more spectacular to stand beneath than drive over, with an almost cathedral-like vista and a strange aura of calmness that betrays the likely traffic chaos that is going unseen directly above your head. Further west, the Clyde Arc, locally referred to as the "Squinty Bridge", is a relatively new and prominent bridge over the River Clyde that has an elegant curved design and is unique for how it crosses the river at an angle.</see>
* <see name="City Chambers" alt="" address="George Square" directions="train: Glasgow Queen Street" phone="+44 141 287-2000" email="" fax="" url="" hours="Guided tours M-F at 10:30 & 14:30" price="Free">This imposing structure in George Square was built in 1888 in the Italian Renaissance style and is the headquarters of Glasgow City Council. Tours of the building are available daily, and visitors can see the magnificent marble staircases, and lobbies, see the debating chamber, and the lavish banqueting hall. In front, the building, '''George Square''', the city's notional center, is populated by several statues of civic leaders and famous figures from history and is often used for outdoor events.</see>
[[Image:Glasgow-cathedral-may-2007.jpg|thumb|Glasgow Cathedral]]

Behind the cathedral atop a steep hill is the '''Necropolis''' cemetery – dominated by the statue of John Knox and described by Victorians as a literal “City of The Dead”.</see>
* <see name="Glasgow Central Station" alt="" address="Gordon Street, between Union and Hope Streets" directions="train: Glasgow Central" phone="08457 11 41 41" email="" fax="" url="https://www.networkrail.co.uk/communities/passengers/our-stations/glasgow-central/" hours="M-Sa 04:00-00:30, Su 07:00-00:30" price="Free">The city's principal railway terminus, which is worth entering for its grand interior, which you can access from Gordon Street on the north side of the building. On the exterior, a feature of note is the massive glass-walled bridge (known as Hielanman's Umbrella) which spans Argyle Street and holds up the tracks and platforms.  There's also an excellent station tour exploring the hidden corners of the station guided by a Network Rail historian (£10)</see>
* <see name="Glasgow Cross" alt="" address="At the junction of Trongate, Saltmarket, High Street, Gallowgate and London Road" directions="" phone="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">This intersection marks the original medieval center of the city and is dominated by the clock tower of the original City Chambers (destroyed by fire in 1926), and the small hexagonal building known as the Tolbooth. Just to the west on Trongate is the '''Tron Theatre''', a former church that was turned into a prominent theatre.</see>
* <see name="Glasgow School of Art" alt="" address="167 Renfrew St" directions="subway: Cowcaddens" phone="+44 141 353-4526" email="" fax="" url="http://www.gsa.ac.uk/" hours="Tour schedules vary by season" price="£8.75 adults, £7 students/seniors, £4 youth">Seen as one of Charles Rennie Mackintosh's finest buildings, housing one of Britain's pre-eminent schools of art, design, and architecture.

Contains the '''Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery''', including a reconstruction of Mackintosh's house.  The exterior of the main building is fine in its own right; the current main University building is neo-gothic and dates from 1870, designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott (the man who also designed London's St Pancras railway station). The main building has an interesting visitor's center (open all year round) which is free and sits atop a drumlin with commanding views over Kelvingrove Park and the western fringes of the city.</see>

The imposing structure houses a spectacular reading room, although it has to be said much of Mitchell's extensive collection is housed in the rather ugly 1970s extension attached to the rear.  You can easily lose a day in here!</see>
{{infobox|In Search of Raintown|Fans of the Glasgow band Deacon Blue have often made the pilgrimage to the top of the Granite Staircase to recreate the cover photograph of their famous 1987 album ''Raintown''. Sadly, neither of the two cover photos from the album is now possible to reconstruct. Two decades have seen Kelvingrove Park's trees grow to obscure the view of the Clyde and the Finnieston Crane from the top of the Granite Staircase.  Equally, the rear cover shot of the M8 motorway approach onto the Kingston Bridge (adjacent to the Mitchell Library) was taken from a disused bridge upon which an office building has now been constructed.}}

If this just whets your appetite for information on Glasgow's architecture, try and get hold of a copy of ''Central Glasgow: An Illustrated Architectural Guide'', by Charles McKean and others. There are various editions (ISBN:1873190220, ISBN:1851582002, ISBN:1851582010).

===Museums and art galleries===
[[Image:Glasgow Science Center.JPG|thumb|Glasgow Science Centre]]
The Victorians also left Glasgow with a wonderful legacy of museums and art galleries, which the city has dutifully built upon. The following list is only a selection. The city council alone runs several museums and galleries. Visitors should be aware that most of the galleries appear to be closed on Sundays, and that - to the understandable annoyance of many visitors to Glasgow - most of the museums shut their doors at 17:00.

===Parks===
{{infobox|If you should fall in|Glasgow Green is the home of the '''Glasgow Humane Society'''. The Society was founded in 1790 and is the world's oldest practical life-saving body. Until June 2005 the society volunteers were responsible for rescuing those unfortunate to fall into the River Clyde. Unfortunately, modern heath and safety regulations require two lifeboat men on duty and a lack of volunteers has forced the sole lifeboat man, George Parsonage, to stand down the service after 215 years. The rescue service is now performed by the Strathclyde Fire Brigade.}}

Among the highlights are the People's Palace and Winter Gardens (covered above), '''Nelson's Memorial''', an obelisk or needle: built to commemorate Nelson's victory at the battle of Trafalgar, the '''Templeton Carpet Factory''', with its ornate brickwork (now a business center), and the '''Doulton Fountain''', the largest terracotta fountain in the world.

===Football===
[[Image:Glasgow Derby.JPG|thumb|Supporters of Celtic and Rangers display their banners at half time in a derby match]]
Glasgow is also home to the 3 largest football stadiums in Scotland. The major events in the football season are the clashes between the two major clubs; Celtic and Rangers. Known as the "Old Firm", with their sectarian undertones, these 90-minute matches produce a profound effect on the city, occasionally, but less frequently in recent times; resulting in violent clashes during or after the game. The Old Firm Derby is generally considered to be one of the best derby matches in the world, in terms of passion and atmosphere generated by both sets of fans, and is considered by many neutrals to be the most intense rivalry in all of Britain. The match itself is always highly anticipated and much talked about before and after. Cup (non-league) ties between these two giants are quite frequent, raising the tensions further. Be aware that getting tickets for "Old Firm" games can be difficult and cup ties near impossible. If you do go to one of these matches it is advised that you do not wear team colors (blue/red/white for Rangers, green/white for Celtic) after the match. If you are looking for a different experience of Scottish football, then there are a number of non-league teams that play in the city. 
* <do name="Celtic Park" alt="" address="Janefield St, Glasgow G40 3RE" directions="Bus 40/61/62/240/262 go past the stadium.

There are tours of the stadium available every day of the week (times vary). If you want to see a match, tickets are available in advance of games on the Celtic website. Some games will be harder to get tickets for than others, but with the exception of games versus Rangers and European games, there should be some available if you plan ahead.</do>

It has a capacity of 10,887. Partick Thistle matches are a good way to see the Glaswegian passion for 'fitba' (football) without the unpleasantness of the Old Firm rivalry, or the high prices for their games. If you are interested in going to a match[https://ptfc.co.uk/fixtures/first-team/], tickets will be available at the stadium on matchday.</do>

===Music===
Glasgow's been famous for its music scene(s) for at least 20 years, with some top acts literally queuing to play at venues such as the Barrowlands or King' Tuts. There are plenty of venues where you're likely to see a good band (and lots of bad bands too); on any day of the week, there should be at least several shows to choose from throughout the city, with the number increasing to an even greater variety on Thursday, Friday & Saturday. In no particular order, here follows some pop/indie/rock-orientated venues:

Your employer should require this to ensure you pay the correct rates of income tax. However, if you ask around you'll find a lot of bars and nightclubs offer work cash-in-hand. Some of the many temp agencies in the city center aren't too fussy about immigration niceties either. With the city's growing financial services industry, there are quite a lot of opportunities for office temps, though this has changed with the global economic downturn of the last few years.

Glasgow has positioned itself as an upmarket retail destination, the shopping is some of the best in Scotland and is generally accepted as the No.2 shopping experience in Britain after London. Buchanan Street is the 7th most expensive place for retail space in the world, which means that there's an increasing number of designer clothes shops in areas like the Merchant City. Alongside this, the Council is putting pressure on more traditional shopping centers like the Barras where you can get remarkably similar-looking clothes for a more sensible price.

The nucleus of Glasgow shopping is the so-called "Golden Z", made up of the continuous pedestrianized thoroughfares of Argyle Street, Buchanan Street, and Sauchiehall Street. Here, virtually all of the major British big-name retailers are represented. Buchanan Street is the most upmarket of the three, with prestigious names such as House of Fraser, Apple Store and Zara, and other specialized designer stores. Ingram Street in the Merchant City has seen a boom in recent years in attracting more exclusive, premium brands like Bose, Bang and Olufsen, Ralph Lauren, and so on.

Bath Street and Hope Street run parallel to the main pedestrianized streets, and if you want to get away from "chain store hell", they have a fine selection of more quirky, local independent retailers selling everything from fine art, Scottish clothing, antiques, and specialist hi-fi.

There are larger shopping malls on the city outskirts at Braehead, Silverburn, and Glasgow Fort.

The city has won the title "Curry Capital of Britain" two years running and has a huge and dynamic range of restaurants, Indian or otherwise. Despite Glasgow being the hometown of culinary hero Gordon Ramsay,  there are no Michelin-starred fine dining establishments in the city (Glasgow's sole Michelin-starred restaurant, ''Amaryllis'' - owned by Ramsay himself - embarrassingly folded in 2004), nevertheless, there are scores of highly regarded eateries in the city. The restaurants below are some of the culinary highlights of Glasgow.

===Indian===
Glasgow has, arguably, the finest Indian food in the United Kingdom, and indeed many Glaswegians now joke that the Indian Curry is their "national dish". Historically, the city's finest Indian restaurants have been clustered together in the Charing Cross area, just beyond the "main" section of Sauchiehall Street, but in recent years the Merchant City has seen a boom in new establishments.

According to one Glasgow MP, the Shish responded in the 1960s to complaints from Glaswegians that traditional Indian curries were too dry by soaking the chicken and spices in tomato soup, resulting in the first incarnation of the 'wet' style of curry commonly enjoyed today.

There are also literally hundreds of takeaway Indian restaurants around the city on nearly every main street, although the quality of these can be very variable.

===Takeaway/Fish & Chips===
Glasgow has taken many different cultural foods and combined them into a unique dining experience. Most takeaways offer Indian dishes (pakora), pizzas, and kebabs as well as the more traditional fish and chips or burgers. This has resulted in some takeaways offering a blend of dishes like chips with curry sauce, the donner kebab pizza, the battered and deep-fried pizza to name but a few.

Fish & Chips (aka "Fish Supper") is a perennial favorite, and there are a healthy number of fish and chip shops around the city. As mentioned above, many will also offer Asian or Italian dishes alongside the traditional chip shop fayre.  Given the Glaswegian's famous fondness for anything deep-fried - "bad" establishments don't usually last long. In the center of town, four of the best "chippies" are:

==Drink==
Pubs are arguably the meeting rooms of Scotland’s largest city, and many a lively discussion can be heard in a Glasgow bar. There is nothing Glaswegians love more than "putting the world right" over a pint (or three), whether it’s the Old Firm, religion, weather, politics, or how this year’s holidays went. You are guaranteed a warm welcome from the locals, who will soon strike up a conversation.  

There are three (or arguably, four) basic drinking areas: these are also good for restaurants. First, there is the West End (the area around Byres Road and Ashton Lane), second, there is the stretch of Sauchiehall Street between the end of the pedestrianized area (near Queen Street Station) and Charing Cross (and the various streets off this area). Thirdly there is the Merchant City,  which is near Strathclyde University's campus. This is the most 'upmarket' area to drink and eat in, although it still has numerous student dives: start at the University of Strathclyde and wander down towards the Trongate (the West part of this part of town is the gay area). Staying in the city center, there are also several hidden gems in and around the Blythswood Square area and the streets between Hope Street and Charing Cross: this being the city's office district however it can feel quite deserted on evenings and weekends.

Finally, and up and coming is the South Side (i.e. South of the Clyde). This used to be very much 'behind the times' socially speaking, but the relocation of the BBC to the South Side and the whole area generally moving 'upmarket' has improved things greatly. Try the area around Shawlands Cross for restaurants, bars, and The Shed nightclub.  

Be warned though about dress codes, particularly in some of the more upmarket establishments in the city center and West End: sportswear and trainers (sneakers) are often banned, and some door staff is notoriously "selective" about who is allowed in, with arcane "sorry, regulars only mate" entry policies which they will never explain. If confronted with this, take your custom elsewhere. The general "boozer" type pubs have no dress codes, but football shirts (regardless of team) are almost universally banned in all: particularly on weekends. One rule to be aware of is that some clubs and upmarket pubs enforce an unwritten policy of not allowing all-male groups of more than about four people. For this reason, it may be advisable to split into groups of two or three. Some pubs in Glasgow are also exclusively the haunt of Old Firm football fans: again, these will be very crowded on football days, can get very rowdy, and should be avoided. Fortunately, they are easy to spot; for example, a large cluster of Celtic-oriented pubs exist in the Barrowlands area, while one or two bars on or near Paisley Road West are favorite haunts of Rangers fans. 

The following is merely a selection of the many bars, pubs, wine bars, and clubs throughout the city.

An increasingly popular pastime in the city is the 'Subcrawl', a pub crawl around Glasgow's underground system, getting off at each of the fifteen stops to go to the nearest pub for a drink. It is advisable to go with a local especially since in some parts on the south side the nearest pub to the underground station is not immediately obvious, but it is a good way to see the different neighbourhoods and pub cultures of the city.

===Chain/Theme===
Like any major British city, the central area of Glasgow has its fair share of chain and theme pubs, with establishments from the likes of Whitbread, Yates, and of course the ubiquitous JD Wetherspoon:
* <drink name="Counting House" alt="" address="2 St Vincent Pl, Glasgow G1 2DH" directions="George Square – near Queen Street station" lat="" long="" phone="+44 1412250160" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="https://www.jdwetherspoon.com/pubs/all-pubs/scotland/glasgow/the-counting-house-glasgow" hours="" price="">Formerly a flagship branch of the Bank of Scotland, you can drink here in the splendor of this old Victorian banking hall. Converted into an open-plan bar by the Wetherspoon chain, it’s popular with tourists and locals, with quirky features such as the bank vault now being used as a wine cellar.</drink>
* <drink name="Crystal Palace" alt="" address="36 Jamaica St, Glasgow G1 4QD" directions="near Central Station and the Jamaica Bridge" lat="" long="" phone="+44 1412212624" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="https://www.jdwetherspoon.com/pubs/all-pubs/scotland/glasgow/the-crystal-palace-glasgow?utm_source=google&utm_medium=maps&utm_campaign=gmb" hours="" price="">Another Wetherspoons establishment, good for evening football; and a good place to meet up if you are heading across to the O2 Academy or the Citizen’s Theatre on the other side of the river.</drink>
* <drink name="Waxy O'Connors Pub" alt="" address="44 W George St, Glasgow G2 1DH" directions="next to George Square/Queen Street station" lat="" long="" phone="+44 1413545154" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="https://waxyoconnorsglasgow.co.uk/" hours="" price="">Vaguely Irish-themed bar with its curious 'Lord of the Rings'-like setting. Spread over six bars, nine rooms, and three floors. The premises is a fun place, with steps and stairs running up and down through the maze of rooms and bars, and a rather eclectic mix of "tree trunk" and church gothic interior décor.</drink>

===Whisky===
Glasgow has many options for whisky, though many may not be immediately obvious to the passing tourist. Here are some good starting points:
* <drink name="Ben Nevis Pub" alt="" address="1147 Argyle St, Finnieston, Glasgow G3 8TB" directions="" lat="" long="" phone="+44 1415765204" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="http://www.thebennevisbar.com/" hours="" price=""></drink>

It's a great starting point for the beginner; if you make yourself known to the staff as something of a newbie, then somebody in here will certainly be able to guide you through the different regions and tastes.</drink>
* <drink name="Pot Still Pub" alt="" address="154 Hope St, Glasgow G2 2TH" directions="a few blocks north of Central Station" lat="" long="" phone="+44 1413330980" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="http://www.thepotstill.co.uk/" hours="" price="">It stocks over 300 single malt whiskeys (as well as other drinks, of course), and the staff really know their stuff. It's also an excellent example of a traditional British pub, with a great atmosphere.</drink>
 
===Beers & Real Ale===
* <drink name="Beer Cafe" alt="" address="78 Candleriggs, Glasgow G1 1NP" directions="inside the Merchant Square complex" lat="" long="" phone="+44 1415521741" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="http://www.beercafe.co.uk/" hours="" price="">Wide range of local and imported beers both in bottles and draught form.</drink>

This chain is quickly becoming famous for its 2-for-1 stonebaked pizza deals, and its recently introduced £5 all-you-can-eat buffet midweek (the main branch on Gordon St will service weekends, but not the sister branches!) While the beers can be quite expensive, you'll be hard pushed to find better quality food for the price in the city center. A must-visit.</drink>

===Student===
The city’s large student population means there is no shortage of student bars, with large concentrations around the Merchant City area (for nearby Strathclyde and Glasgow Caledonian universities, as well as several nearby colleges), and of course Byres Road and Ashton Lane in the West End for Glasgow University.  Another cluster (near Glasgow School of Art) exists along the western reaches of Sauchiehall Street, just beyond the pedestrianized section. Some of the most popular student bars are:
* <drink name="Ark Pub" alt="" address="North Frederick Street, Glasgow G1 2BS" directions="close to George Square; rail: Charing Cross, Subway: St. George's Cross" lat="" long="" phone="+44 1415594331" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="https://www.crafted-social.co.uk/ark-glasgow?utm_source=gmb&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=homepage" hours="" price="">Catering for Strathclyde/Caledonian Universities and Glasgow School of Art respectively were originally both part of the now-defunct ''Scream'' chain, but are now independent.</drink>

Gigs are downstairs and the bar upstairs plays a variety of alternative/rock/punk.</drink>

===Style===
Bath Street has a constantly shifting array of "style bars", which become more numerous as you walk up the financial district on Blythswood Hill.  The quality varies wildly depending on your taste and tolerance. Some of the best are:
* <drink name="Bunker Bar" alt="" address="193-199 Bath St, Glasgow G2 4HU" directions="on the corner of Hope Street and Bath Street" lat="" long="" phone="+44 1412291429" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="http://www.thebunkerbar.com/" hours="" price="">Popular bar with office workers from the nearby financial area, and a good base to start a night out from.</drink>

===Gastropubs===
* <drink name="Babbity Bowsters" alt="" address="16-18 Blackfriars St, Glasgow G1 1PE" directions="nearest railway - High Street" lat="" long="" phone="+44 1415525055" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="http://www.babbitybowster.com/" hours="" price="">Notable for its fine range of imported lagers, the bar meals are excellent. You can even sit outside in the quaint little beer garden (when it is not raining).</drink>

===Culture and music===
If you would like a taste of the real Glasgow and experience a part of the culture few outsiders are privy to, try one of the many unofficial national drinks favored and savored by the Scots. This is probably the second (Whisky being the first) most influential, but no less important, drink that has graced the fine lands that comprise Glasgow and in fact, the whole of Scotland. This is the one and only Buckfast Tonic Wine. Known by many pseudonyms Bucky, Tonic, Sauce, or Wreck the Hoose Juice. The most traditional manner of consuming this beverage is by gathering in a park and pouring it down your neck before the 'Polis' come or by amassing a group of like-minded individuals and wandering down a quiet cycle path in the dark, preferably when it's raining. There are a few regional variations of consumption as well, some groups mix their Buckfast with Milk creating an otherworldly concoction known as a "Buck-shake" or sometimes "Buck-kakke". Some add caffeinated soft drinks, further adding to the caffeine content of the wine. Though these are some of the traditional ways to consume "The Tonic" by far the most common way people choose to consume their wine is to sit in a flat or garden on a rare nice day, with their pals, with a bottle each (at least) and drink it straight from the bottle.

If you like your rock and metal music make a visit there:
* <drink name="Cathouse Rock Club" alt="" address="15 Union St, Glasgow G1 3RB" directions="close to the junction with Argyle Street" lat="" long="" phone="+44 1412486606" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="https://cathouse.co.uk/" hours="" price=""></drink>

===Traditional/Local===
As the city center and West End's bars become ever more sanitized, off-the-peg, and tourist-oriented, finding a traditional “boozer” in Glasgow is getting harder. For the tourist who wants to make the effort, they can be great places to discover what many would call the “real” Glasgow, the Glasgow where Glaswegians hang out. The other advantage is that the cost of a drink is often a lot cheaper. Common sense should tell you which ones to try out, and which to avoid!
 <drink name="13th Note Live music venue" alt="" address="50-60 King St, Glasgow G1 5QT" directions="just off Argyle Street/Trongate" lat="" long="" phone="+44 1415531638" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="http://www.13thnote.co.uk/" hours="" price=""></drink>

===Gay and lesbian===
Glasgow has a lively scene that centers around the Merchant City area (the so-called "Pink Triangle" formed by Revolver, Bennets, and the Polo Lounge).

==Sleep==
Glasgow, like any other major British city, has a multitude of accommodation options to suit all budgets and tastes.  Hotel prices in Glasgow are on average, cheaper than in Edinburgh (which makes Glasgow a popular choice for staying in during times of high demand in the capital—for instance, the annual Festival/Fringe), although there are periods of volatility when Glasgow hotel prices also increase markedly—for example, high profile rock concerts, or major Scotland football fixtures, so it pays to try and avoid these periods.

The city is well represented by the major international chains such as Hilton, Holiday Inn, and Marriott - and of course, the ubiquitous budget motel chains Premier Inn and Travelodge - both have multiple properties in the city center and on the main arterial roads on the outskirts leading into the city.

==Stay safe==
The emergency contact number in Glasgow is the same as the rest of the UK: '''999''', but the (newly re-organized) Police can be contacted for "non-emergencies" by dialing '''101''' from anywhere within Scotland.

Glasgow is like any other big city: it has safe areas and less safe areas, and the basic common sense rules apply. The center of Glasgow is very safe and you should not encounter any problems. All of the city center and tourist areas are well-policed. During the day, the City Centre also has many 'information officers' in red hats and jackets who should be able to assist you if needed. Glasgow does indeed have some very dangerous areas - particularly in some northern and eastern suburbs - where drug-related crime for instance is rife, but these are well away from the centre and it would be impossible to venture into them unless you were making a conscious effort to do so.

Crime in the city center is usually limited to drunken and rowdy behavior late in the evenings - hotspots include the southern end of Hope Street next to Central Station, and under the 'Heilanman's Umbrella', the railway bridge over Argyle Street adjacent to Central Station; and the western end of Sauchiehall Street which has large concentrations of bars and nightclubs. There is usually a heavy police presence anyway in these areas on Friday and Saturday nights to defuse any problems. The West End fares better, but be aware that the back streets off Byres Road and around the University can quickly disorientate a stranger unfamiliar with the area in the hours of darkness.

Although you'll see it being worn everywhere by the locals, if you buy any piece of Celtic or Rangers-related clothing as a souvenir, avoid wearing it in public as it can lead to confrontation - particularly in the evenings. Most bars and clubs in the center of the city universally ban all football colors, regardless of team. In the past, there have been violent encounters and even killings with locals, so it is always best to wear them away from Glasgow. Either way, football shirts from any club have been banned in schools across the city. Additionally, avoid wearing ''anything'' green in the Bridgeton area as this, despite its close proximity to Celtic Park, is a staunch Loyalist area that has seen violence committed against people who were simply wearing the "wrong" color, regardless of what football team they support. Similarly, try to avoid wearing blue or orange in Royston/Garngad as this is historically a Republican area.

Whereas prostitution/sex work is legal in Scotland, both 'soliciting' (ie prostitutes accosting potential customers in public) and 'kerb crawling' ('punters' driving or walking around obviously looking for sex workers) is illegal; so avoid driving/walking around obvious red light districts. The main trouble spots in the city have historically been the Blythswood Hill and Anderston areas close to the M8 motorway - a busy office district by day, but usually deserted in the evenings and on weekends. 'Running a brothel' is also illegal, so 'massage parlors' and brothels can be and are 'busted' by the police. If you are in a brothel/'massage parlor' which is raided by the police you may be taken into custody and asked questions you don't want to answer. Avoid such places. 

For more information, contact Police Scotland [http://www.scotland.police.uk/]. There is one '''Non-Emergency''' number ''101'' to contact the police wherever you are in Scotland for matters that don't require immediate police attention. For emergencies, dial '''999'''.

==Stay healthy==
The UK's '''National Health Service''' (NHS) will provide emergency treatment for anyone in the UK, irrespective of whether they reside in the UK. In a medical emergency, dial 999 or 112. These numbers are free of charge from any telephone. For advice on non-emergency medical problems, you can ring the 24-hour NHS 24 service on 111.

If you should fall ill or have an accident, then the two closest hospitals to the center of the city with an Accident & Emergency (A&E) department are as follows:
* <listing name="Glasgow Royal Infirmary" alt="" directions="It is on the northeast corner of the city center (just to the north of Glasgow Cathedral" lat="" long="" address="84 Castle St, Glasgow G4 0SF" phone="+44 1412114000" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="https://www.nhsggc.org.uk/patients-and-visitors/main-hospital-sites/glasgow-royal-campus/glasgow-royal-infirmary/" hours="" price="">The location of the hospital is well signposted on all major roads and is just off Junction 15 of the M8 motorway.</listing>

==Contact==

===Phone===
Glasgow's area code (for landline numbers) is 0141. When calling from inside the UK, you may choose to substitute just 0 for the +44 part that we list.

===Internet===
If you are traveling with a laptop then you will find broadband internet access in the rooms of most, but not all, medium to high-end hotels. If this is important to you, check before booking. Alternatively, there are many Wi-Fi hot spots in and around Glasgow, and  [http://www.wifinder.com/ WiFinder] provides a register. 

There are also several places that offer web and other internet access if you are traveling without a laptop. These include: 
* <listing name="iCafe Merchant City" alt="" directions="" lat="" long="" address="70-72 Ingram St, Glasgow G1 1EX" phone="+44 1415486902" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="http://www.icafe.uk.com/" hours="" price=""></listing>

==Get out==
* [[Loch Lomond]], also climb the nearby '''Ben Lomond''' (the most southerly ''Munro'') for great views. It is a 40-minute drive on the A82 road from the West End, and trains to [[Balloch]] (on the southern shore of the loch) leave Queen Street (Low Level) every half hour. [[Tarbet]] and Ardlui on the northern part of the loch are accessible via the [[West Highland Railway]] from Queen Street (High Level) several times a day; [http://www.citylink.co.uk/ Citylink] buses also serve the entire western side of the loch throughout the day.
* Take a seaplane trip to Loch Lomond, or even further afield [http://www.lochlomondseaplanes.com/]
* [[Edinburgh]], Scotland's capital city, is 46 miles to the east of Glasgow and is easily reachable by public transport. Trains depart from Queen Street (High Level) up to every fifteen minutes, as does the Citylink 900 bus service from Buchanan Bus Station. Buses to Edinburgh operate 24/7.
* [[Stirling]] lies 28 miles to the northeast of Glasgow - best known as the spiritual home of Scottish national heroes William Wallace and Robert The Bruce. A natural gateway to the Central Highlands, the city’s famous castle is well worth a visit. Trains leave every half hour from Queen Street (High Level) railway station and are easily reached by car or bus via the M80 motorway.
* The Ayrshire coast towns of [[Largs]], [[Ardrossan]], [[Saltcoats]], [[Troon]], [[Prestwick]] and [[Ayr]] are typically old-fashioned holiday seaside resorts. Whilst most Glaswegians themselves have long abandoned them in favor of package holidays to the Mediterranean, they all have an individual charm of their own. South Ayrshire is the spiritual home to Scotland's literary hero and national "bard", Robert Burns. All are easily reachable via regular train services from Central Station.
* Take a day-trip to the [[Isle of Arran]]. It is possible to obtain train/ferry tickets to reach the island. The Isle of Arran is known as "Scotland in Miniature" due to the fact it contains many features of mainland Scotland in a microcosm. Brodick Castle is home to beautiful gardens and has a path connecting to path up '''Goat Fell''', the highest point on Arran which offers stunning views of Brodick Bay during the summer (The Castle is located at the north end of Brodick, a student discount is available). The island is also littered with sites of archaeological and historical interest including many circles of ancient standing stones. Take one of the circle island buses to see it all. Watch your time though - know the last bus and ferry of the day, especially in winter. There is a beautiful bay with a castle in the middle of the northeast in a village called [[Lochranza]].
* Owned by the National Trust for Scotland, Greenbank House and Gardens [http://www.nts.org.uk/] make for a pleasant day out in one of Glasgow's leafier suburbs. It's a 30-minute walk from Clarkston railway station (catch the train from Central Station (High Level)). The gardens have proven to be an inspiration to gardeners throughout the world.
* A short (30-40min) bus journey Westbound down the M8 towards Houston is a good day out. Houston is a traditional Scottish village steeped in history (and is nearby to both traditional leather tanning town Bridge-Of-Weir and upmarket Kilmacolm, home to many local celebrities), but its main draw is the Fox & Hounds Pub, home to Houston Brewing Company. You'd be amazed how many Glaswegians have made this same short journey to sample the ale and traditional Scottish beers of Houston! Several brews are available all year round, with seasonal specialties on tap depending on the month. Tours of the small but well-respected brewing operation are available. This is one of Central Scotland's most well-regarded brewing communities, and well worth a trip. Houston is well served by two bus companies, but watch out as the service back into Glasgow is around 11PM.
* Take a hike up the Kilpatrick Hills. Kilpatrick Station is only a 50-minute train journey from Queen Street Station (Low Level) on weekdays and Saturdays, and Central Station (Low Level) on Sundays. The hills are huge and from the highest peaks, you can admire Greater Glasgow from a distance, with views as far as Edinburgh, Stirlingshire, Ayrshire, and the Highlands on the clearest days. The hills have their own stunning forests, valleys, lakes, streams, and waterfalls. If you lose your way a friendly local will always be happy to help.
