'''Kelowna''' is the largest city in the Okanagan region, located in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]].

==Understand== 

Kelowna is located in the heart of BC's wine country. It has a metropolitan population in 2020 of 217,229.

Okanagan Lake is the main draw in the summer. This 135 km long jewel is a big draw for boaters (power and sail), swimmers and kite-boarders. In winter, thousands of tourists come from all parts of the world to ski at Big White resort, located 55 km from the city. Tourists also come in the fall (mostly) to experience and taste the Okanagan's world class wines from various wineries throughout the valley.

==Get in==
===By plane===

'''Kelowna International Airport''' ({{IATA|YLW}}) [http://www.kelowna.ca/cm/page68.aspx/], provides daily service to several cities including [[Vancouver]], [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]], Prince George, [[Los Angeles]], and [[Seattle]]. Kelowna International Airport also offers flights to [[Puerto Vallarta]], [[Victoria (British Columbia)|Victoria]] and [[Toronto]].

Some of the Airlines utilizing Kelowna International Airport are:
* Air Canada
* Air North
* Alaska Airlines/Horizon Air
* Central Mountain Air
* Westjet

===By train===

There is currently no passenger train service available to Kelowna, however, you can utilize the nearest train terminal in [[Kamloops]] (about 90 minutes north-west of Kelowna by car).

===By car===

Highway 97 is the major highway through Kelowna, with [[Vernon (British Columbia)|Vernon]] and Highway 1 to the north, [[Penticton]] and Highway 3 to the south, and [[Merritt]] and [[Vancouver]] to the west via Highway 97C. Highway 33 provides secondary access to points south and east.

===By bus===

Greyhound services Kelowna from Vancouver and Calgary and points in between.

==Get around==
Traffic can be quite heavy on major roads in Kelowna during the summer months, especially at the approaches to the bridge crossing the Okanagan Lake and the Ellison Overpass near the university and airport. A lack of advance left turn traffic lights contributes to accidents at major intersections.

* '''Kelowna Regional Transit System''', 250-763-6011, [http://www.transitbc.com/regions/kel/]. Best times to travel are early mornings and late afternoons on weekdays. High traffic routes (such as Lakeshore #1, University #8, Rutland #10, RapidBus #97 are the most efficient and numerous routes). Bus drivers are generally courteous and will on request call ahead to your next bus to facilitate a timely transfer. Bus frequencies are reduced during the summer months when school is not in session, but when school is in session, expect to miss a bus (or two) due to over-filled buses. Check the user website for more details and schedules.

*Kelowna has an extensive network of bike lanes. Cyclists are advised to use bike lanes (when not obstructed by parked vehicles) and intersections with caution. Cycling on local highways is not recommended. See the City of Kelowna website for a detailed map.[http://apps.kelowna.ca/CityPage/Docs/PDFs/iGo/2011%20Pathway%20and%20Bicycle%20Network%20Map/Bike-Map_Overview.pdf]

*There are several boat launches along the lakeshore with parking facilities. Be prepared to queue in the summer months. As for the lake itself, it can get crowded out there, especially with small watercraft.

*The downtown area is pedestrian-friendly, especially along the waterfront and Bernard Avenue.

===Vehicle Rentals===

* Budget Car Rentals
* Enterprise Rent-a-Car
* Avis Car Rentals
* Discount Car and Truck Rentals
* Hertz
* '''Vespa and Scooter Rentals''', [http://www.vespakelowna.ca/].

===Downtown===

The downtown core is easily accessible with public transit as well as taxis and bicycles. Once downtown you have two major parkades to choose from if you decide to drive yourself. One is off Pandosy Street (The Verve Restaurant is in the first level) or at the library by the RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police) Station, so parking shouldn't be a chore.

As in any city the rush hour (usually 4:30PM-6PM) can be a challenge in the downtown core as well as on the main transportation arteries: Highway 97C, Highway 33, Lakeshore Rd.

==See==

*The '''Downtown City Park''' offers a great environment in the summer to sun tan play and enjoy yourself or with your family playgrounds as well as the water and skate board park offer for a great time in the sun.

*Enjoy the '''half submerged playground at Gyro Beach'''; in summer you can let yourself slide along the rope into the lake within which you may come across our lake's resident the Ogopogo (we are not joking, Loch Ness isn't the only body of water with a lake monster [the term monster is used loosely]). If you see Ogopogo make sure to be friendly as it is his home you're swimming in ;). 

*One of the best kept secrets of Kelowna is Bertram Park at the end of Lakeshore Road, with beautiful beaches and grassy areas to picnic on it is one of the most idyllic places in Kelowna, it offers BBQ's as well as change/wash rooms.

*Another "best kept secret" is a beautiful beach located off Lakeshore in the Mission area. To get to it, turn down Truswell Road and take a left on Martin Road. If you walk keeping on the right to the end of Martin, you will come to a river. Turn right down a narrow bank alongside the river and walk along it for a short distance and you'll find and absolutely gorgeous beach frequented mainly by the younger crowd. If you bring beer or "other things" BC is famous for, be careful, as this beach is certainly not a secret to the police. This beach is referred to by locals as "'''Hidden Beach'''", often reduced to "Hidden", or "'''Skim Beach'''".

The main industry in Kelowna is tourism, with its requisite offering of service industry jobs at or slightly above minimum wage. The local ski hill Big White offers winter employment for ski/board instructors, liftees, servers, and so on. With the recent boom in housing, there is a shortage of skilled tradespeople in the construction industry.

==Stay safe==

Kelowna is a growing city and therefore has its growing pains, with these come the following recommendations; avoid Leon & Lawrence Avenues between Water and Ellis during night time. City Park at night is patrolled, however can be somewhat dodgy after hours too.

As long as you keep yourself aware of your surroundings, you will be fine.

In summer, the city is also prone to forest fires, having suffered large fires in 2003, 2009, and 2023. Depending on the season, there may be campfire bans or parks may be closed.
