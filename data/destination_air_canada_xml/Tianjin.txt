Tianjin (Chinese: 天津; pinyin: Tiānjīn) is a metropolis in northern China and one of the five national central cities of the People's Republic of China. It is governed as a direct-controlled municipality, one of four such designations, and is, thus, under direct administration of the central government. Tianjin borders Hebei Province and Beijing Municipality, bounded to the east by the Bohai Gulf portion of the Yellow Sea.

As a dual-core city, Tianjin is divided into the old city and the Binhai New Area. Binhai New Area is a new growth pole in China, and it maintains an annual growth rate of nearly 30% of the GDP. As of the end of 2010, 285 Fortune Global 500 companies have established branch offices in Binhai. It is a base of China's advanced industry, financial reform, and innovation.

In urban population, the city ranks sixth in China and its urban land area (Binhai New Area is not included) is fifth after [[Beijing]], [[Shanghai]], [[Wuhan]] and [[Guangzhou]]. Tianjin's urban area is located along the Hai River, which connects to the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers via the Grand Canal in Tianjin. Tianjin was once home to foreign concessions in the late Qing Dynasty and early Kuomintang (KMT) era. The municipality incorporates the coastal region of Tanggu, home to the Binhai New Area and the Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area (TEDA).

===Climate===
Tianjin has a continental climate similar, though slightly warmer, to its neighbor [[Beijing]]. It features moderate rainfall measuring 511.4mm on average, each year. Extremes have ranged from -22.9°C (-9.2°F) to 40.5°C (104.9°F). Winters are freezing, influenced by the vast Siberian Anticyclone. Despite the fact that its southeastern suburbs reach the [[Bohai Sea]], the city often sees temperatures below -10°C (14°F) and temperatures down to -15°C (5°F) aren't very uncommon. The average January temperature is -3.4°C (25.8°F) and the average high and low temperature is 2°C (35°F) and -7.4°C (18.6°F) prespectively. Snow is uncommon, not because of temperature, but usually because of the lack of precipitation falling during these months. Spring usually arrives by the end of March or early April when temperatures start to rise above 20°C (68°F). During this part of the year Tianjin is occassionally affected by sandstorms originating in the [[Gobi Desert]]. Summers in the city are characterised by sweltering heat and much rainfall. Temperatures usually top 30°C (86°F), but they may occassionally rise above 35°C (95°F) during heat waves. Autumn usually arrives by mid-September and it's similar to spring, albeit being slightly cooler and wetter.

== History ==

The land where Tianjin is located today was created in prehistoric times by sedimentation of various rivers entering the sea at Bohai Gulf, including the Yellow River, which entered the sea in this area at one point.

The opening of the [[Grand Canal of China]] during the Sui Dynasty prompted the development of Tianjin into a trading center. Until 1404, Tianjin was called "Zhigu" (直沽), or "Straight Port". In that year, the Yongle Emperor renamed the city Tianjin, meaning "the Heavenly Ford", to indicate that the Emperor (Son of Heaven) forded the river at that point. This is because he had indeed forded the river in Tianjin when in contention for the throne with his nephew. Later, a fort was established in Tianjin, known as "Tianjin Wei" (天津卫), the Fort of Tianjin.

Tianjin was promoted to a prefecture in 1725. Tianjin County was established under the prefecture in 1731.

In 1856, Chinese soldiers boarded The Arrow, a Chinese-owned ship registered in Hong Kong flying the British flag and suspected of piracy, smuggling, and of being engaged in the opium trade. They captured 12 men and imprisoned them. In response, the British and French sent gunboats under the command of Admiral Sir Michael Seymour to capture the Taku forts (大沽砲台) near Tianjin in May 1858. At the end of the first part of the Second Opium War in June of the same year, the Treaties of Tianjin were signed, which opened Tianjin to foreign trade. The treaties were ratified by the Emperor of China in 1860, and Tianjin (known as Tientsin) was formally opened to Great Britain and France, and thus to the outside world. Between 1895 and 1900, Britain and France were joined by Japan, Germany and Russia, and even by countries without Chinese concessions such as Austria-Hungary, Italy and Belgium, in establishing self-contained concessions in Tianjin, each with its own prisons, schools, barracks and hospitals. These nations left many architectural reminders of their rule, notably churches and thousands of villas. Today those villas provide an exotic flavour to Tianjin.

The presence of foreign influence in Tianjin was not always peaceful; one of the most serious violent incidents to take place was the Tianjin Church Incident (天津教案). In June 1870, the orphanage held by the Wanghailou Church (望海楼教堂), Our Lady of Victories, in Tianjin, built by French Roman Catholic missionaries, was accused of the kidnapping and brainwashing of Chinese children. On June 21, the magistrate of Tianjin County initiated a showdown at the church that developed into violent clashes between the church's Christian supporters and non-Christian Tianjin residents. The furious protestors eventually burned down Wanghailou Church and the nearby French consulate and killed eighteen foreigners including ten French nuns, the French consul, and merchants. France and six other Western nations complained to the Qing government, which was forced to pay compensation for the incident.

In June 1900, the Boxers were able to seize control of much of Tianjin. On 26 June, European defense forces heading towards Beijing were stopped by Boxers at nearby Langfang, and were defeated and forced to turn back to Tianjin. The foreign concessions were also under siege for several weeks.

In July 1900, the Eight-Nation Alliance recaptured Tianjin. This alliance soon established the Tianjin Provisional Government, composed of representatives from each of the occupying forces (Russian, British, Japanese, German, French, American, Austro-Hungarian, and Italian). The city was governed by this council until 15 August 1902 when the city was returned to Qing control. Eminent Qing General Yuan Shikai led efforts to transform Tianjin into a modern city, establishing the first modern Chinese police force. In 1907, Yuan supervised China's first modern democratic elections for a county council.

Western nations were permitted to garrison the area to ensure open access to Bejing. The British maintained a brigade of two battalions in Tianjin, and the Italians, French, Japanese, Germans, Russians, and Austro-Hungarians maintained understrength regiments; the United States did not initially participate. During World War I, the German and Austro-Hungarian garrisons were captured and held as Prisoners of War by Allied Forces while the Bolshevik government withdrew the Russian garrison in 1918. In 1920, the remaining participating nations asked the United States to join them, and the U.S. then sent the 15th Infantry Regiment, less one battalion, to Tientsin from the Philippines.

Tianjin was established as a municipality of China (直辖市) in 1927.

Garrison duty was highly regarded by the troops. General George C Marshall, the "architect of victory" in World War II when he was the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, served at Tientsin in the 1920s as Executive Officer of the 15th Infantry. The U.S. withdrew this unit in 1938 and a U.S. presence was maintained only by the dispatch of a small U.S. Marine Corps contingent from the Embassy Guard at Bejing.

On 30 July 1937, Tianjin fell to Japan, as part of the Second Sino-Japanese War, but was not entirely occupied, as the Japanese for the most part respected foreign concessions until 1941, when the American and British concessions were occupied. In the summer of 1939, there occurred a major crisis in Anglo-Japanese relations with the Tientsin Incident. On 14 June 1939, the Imperial Japanese Army surrounded and blockaded the British concession over the refusal of the British authorities to hand over to the Japanese six Chinese who had assassinated a locally prominent Japanese collaborator, and had taken refuge in the British concession. For a time, the 1939 crisis appeared likely to cause an Anglo-Japanese war, especially when reports of the maltreatment by the Japanese Army of British subjects wishing to leave or enter the concession appeared in the British press. The crisis ended when the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain was advised by the Royal Navy and the Foreign Office that the only way to force the Japanese to lift the blockade was to send the main British battle fleet to Far Eastern waters, and that given the current crisis in Europe that it would be inappropriate to send the British fleet out of European waters, thus leading the British to finally turn over the six Chinese, who were then executed by the Japanese. During the Japanese occupation, Tianjin was ruled by the North China Executive Committee, a puppet state based in Beijing.

On 9 August 1940, all of the British troops in Tianjin were ordered to withdraw. On 14 November 1941 the American Marine unit stationed in Tianjin was ordered to leave, but before this could be accomplished, the Japanese attacked the United States. The American Marine detachment surrendered to the Japanese on 8 December 1941. Only the Italian and French concessions (the local French officials were loyal to Vichy) were allowed to remain by the Japanese. Japanese occupation lasted until 15 August 1945, the surrender of Japan marking the end of World War II.

Tianjin holds the annual Meeting of the New Champions of World Economic Forum (also called Summer Davos) from 2008.

In October 2010, the UN Climate Change Conference convened in Tianjin.

==Divisions==
Tianjin City consists of 13 districts and 3 counties, which are 16 county-level divisions. Each district has a unique culture and could be a large city in its own right. Within each district individual '''neighborhoods''', some only a few blocks in size, have personalities lauded in culture and cuisine.

The 7 districts in urban Tianjin are:

Nankai is also home to the city's most prestigious educational institutions including Tianjin University and Nankai University. The Tianjin New Technology Industrial Area, a 12&nbsp;km² precinct, is also located in Nankai.

Historically, northern parts of the Nankai District were located inside ancient Tianjin. The Tianfei Palace or Palace of the Queen of Heaven of the Yuan Dynasty was built in north-eastern Nankai in the year 1326. In the Ming Dynasty, the heart of the city of Tianjin was set up in Nankai. Nankai became part of the military garrisons during the Ming and Qing Dynasties and the city wall served as a major defense system against foreign invasion in the late 19th century.

Nankai District is located in the south-west corner of urban Tianjin, bordered by Hongqiao District to the north, Hebei and Heping Districts to the north-east, Hexi District to the east, and Xiqing District to the south-west. It occupies an area of 40.64&nbsp;km². The natural topography is characterized by a higher elevation in the north of the district and a lower elevation in the south, with the average altitude being 3 meters.

Nankai District has been one of the fastest-growing districts in Tianjin since the formation of the People's Republic of China. 

The rate of population growth has been negative since 1993 with the birth rate averaging 3.97% and the death rate registering 4.56% in 2005.

The majority of people in the Nankai District are Han Chinese. Small populations of ethnic minorities such as the Hui, Manchu, and Mongol peoples also exist.|

By the end of 2010, 285 Fortune Global 500 companies had invested and established branch offices there. Binhai is intended to be a base for China's advanced industrial and financial reform and innovation. A number of major companies including Rockefeller, TISHMAN SPEYER, Motorola, and Airbus have built branches there. For instance, EADS Airbus has already opened an assembly plant for its A320 series airliners, operational since 2009. The Binhai New Area is intended to replicate the development seen in Shenzhen and Pudong, Shanghai. It is a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in the PRC, and experimental reforms are taking place throughout the zone. Starting from November 2009, Binhai New Area was consolidated into a district, and the former subordinate districts of Tanggu, Hangu, and Dagang were abolished. Nowadays Binhai New Area consists of nine functional zones namely Advanced Manufacturing Zone, Airport-based Industrial Zone, Binhai High-tech Industrial Development Zone, Seaport based Industrial Zone, Nangang Industrial Zone, Seaport Logistics Zone, Coastal Leisure & Tourism Zone， Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City and Central Business District. In addition, Tianjin Port whose throughput ranks 5th in the world also locates in here. |)}}

The current Xiqing area came into existence in the mid and late Tang Dynasty. In Northern Song (Song Dynasty) period, this area was the border of Song and Liao (Liao Dynasty). In Ming Dynasty, this area was under the control of Jinghai County and Wuqing County, Hejian Fu. In Qing Dynasty, it was governed by Tianjin Fu. In 1912, after the founding of the Republic of China, this area was named Tianjin County, Zhili Province.

After 1949, it became a special area of Hebei province and Yangliuqing became its center of governance. In 1952, this area became part of Tianjin Municipality. In 1953, it got its name Xijiaoqu (West Suburb). In 1992, it was named Xiqing District.

Xiqing consists of two subdistricts (jiedao banshichu, 街道办事处): Liqizhuang (李七庄)and Xiyingmen (西营门）; seven counties (zhen 镇): Yangliuqing (杨柳青), Zhangjiawo (张家窝), Nanhe (南河), Dasi (大寺), Xinkou (辛口), Zhongbei (中北), and Wangwenzhuang (王稳庄); 160 villages (cun, 村), and 59 residents' committees (居民委员会).

'''Tianjin Binhai International Airport''' ({{IATA|TSN}}) is located in the east of the urban area, in Dongli District, which is only 15 km (9 miles) to the east of the urban area. It is a second alternative to high-speed train, especially if wanting to reduce the added travel time and cost that comes associated with flying into Beijing -- just some 120 km (75 miles) from Tianjin.

Domestic routes include [[Changchun]], [[Changsha]], [[Changzhou]], [[Chengdu]], [[Chifeng]], [[Dalian]], [[Guangzhou]], [[Guilin]], [[Haikou]], [[Hangzhou]], [[Harbin]], [[Hefei]], [[Hohhot]], [[Nanjing]], [[Ningbo]], [[Qingdao]], [[Sanya]], [[Shanghai|Shanghai-Hongqiao]], [[Shanghai|Shanghai-Pudong]], [[Shenyang]], [[Shenzhen]], [[Weihai]], [[Wuhan]], [[Xi'an]], [[Xiamen]], [[Yantai]], [[Yuncheng]], [[Zhengzhou]], and [[Zhuhai]].

A few international routes are available, including [[Auckland]], [[Bangkok]], [[Hiroshima]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Kaohsiung]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[London]], [[Moscow]], [[Nagoya]], [[Osaka]], [[Incheon|Seoul-Incheon]], [[Singapore]], [[Taipei|Taipei-Songshan]] and [[Taipei|Tapei-Taoyuan]]. However the destinations are far more than that, if Beijing Capital International Airport is taken into account, which is so near. Because the fairly short distance between the two cities, and bullet train service available, consider both cities as an arrival point.

'''Airport Shuttle Bus'''[http://www.airport-china.com/tianjin-binhai-airport/traffic/airport-shuttle.html] There are four routes, and the most expensive price is ¥25. No change is given on the bus, so make sure you have exact change for the fare.

The Binhaiguojijichang metro station at the end of Line 2 goes directly to the airport and takes ~20 minutes from the central station. 

====Beijing Daxing International Airport====
'''Beijing Daxing International Airport''' ({{IATA|PKX}}) which just recently opened is another alternative to flying into Tianjin as the airport is located 119 km (74 miles) from Tianjin. Since the airport has recently opened, the number of daily flights are still limited. The more time that goes by, there will be an increase in air itineraries in the airport’s schedule. For the time being, all the major China air carriers such as China Eastern, China Southern, China United, and Air China airlines are present at Daxing airport along with some international airlines like British Airways, Finnair, LOT Polish Airlines, and Malaysia Airlines.

As far as intercity buses are concerned, the Daxing airport bus to Tianjin runs 4 times a day and the ticket price is 75 RMB (9.5€ / 10.5$) and are currently the only real convenient public transport option to the airport from Tianjin. However there is a high speed rail line being built that will connect Tianjin to Beijing Daxing Airport (expected to open in 2022).

===By train ===

'''Tianjin Railway Station''' is the largest station in the city. It was first built in 1888 and then rebuilt in 1988. The station was again renovated in 2008 in preparation for the Olympic Games. Tianjin North is another railway stations in the urban area. Tanggu station serves the seaside district of the same name. Tianjin West and Tianjin South stations serve bullet trains to Shanghai, while Tianjin West is within the urban area, Tianjin South is a further away from the city center.

Tianjin railway station is open for the bullet train to Beijing South train station. One-way tickets are ¥55 for Economy, ¥66 for Business, or ¥94 for VIP. The bullet train designation is a 'C' and takes about 33 minutes, travelling up to 300&nbsp;km/h. Some C-series trains make a stop in Wuqing, which adds 5 more minutes to the trip.

There are shuttle buses between Tianjin railway station and Tianjin airport. A ticket costs ¥15 per trip. It  stops about 200&nbsp;m from the train station northern gate (back gate). When alighting from the shuttle bus, just walk along the pavement and you will reach the train station.

Should you choose to take taxi, use the official taxi stand (just follow the signage). The taxi fare from Tianjin railway station to Tianjin airport is about ¥50-65. It is not advisable to use any of the touts that offer taxi services. The official taxi stand has plenty of taxis.

If leaving the station by taxi, be prepared for a production-line approach to getting the punters into taxis. Marshals keep the queue moving so have baggage ready to stow and a destination in mind or possibly be forced to go to the back of the line and wait your turn again.

Tianjin South Railway Station handles some of the high-speed rail service to Shanghai. However, it is not near the city centre. There are some bus routes from the South Railway Station to the city, and the taxis are predominantly of the illegal variety, so plan accordingly. The recently renovated Tianjin West Station also handles the high-speed rail service to Shanghai. It can be reached via Tianjin Metro Line 1. Tianjin South serves as an intermediate station for bullet trains between Beijing South and Shanghai Hongqiao. Tianjin West is not located on the main line, but as a termini for trains between Tianjin West and Shanghai Hongqiao.

The Tianjin Railway Station is also locally called the 'East Station', due to its geographical position. In January 2007, the station began another long-term restructuring project to modernize the facility and as part of the larger Tianjin transport hub project involving Tianjin Metro lines 2, 3, and 9 as well as the Tianjin-Beijing High-speed rail.

'''Tianjin West Railway Station''' and '''Tianjin North Railway Station''' are also major railway stations in Tianjin. There is also '''Tanggu Railway Station''' is located in the important port area of Tanggu District, and '''TEDA Railway Station''' located in TEDA, to the north of Tanggu. There are several other railway stations in the city that do not handle passenger traffic.

Construction on a Beijing-Tianjin high-speed rail was completed by August 2008.

The following rail lines go through Tianjin:

'''Tianjin West Railway Station''', Jingshan Railway, from Beijing to Shanhai Pass
Jinpu Railway, from Tianjin to Pukou District, Nanjing
Jinji Railway, from Tianjin urban area to Ji County, Tianjin
Jinba Railway, from Tianjin to Bazhou, Hebei
Starting from Aug. 1, 2008, all trains stopping at the previous Tianjin Temporary Passenger Station will now instead use the newly completed Tianjin Railway Station.

Also, the '''inter-city trains''' between Beijing and Tianjin will adopt a new numbering system: Cxxxx (C stands for interCity.). The train numbers range between C2001～C2298:

'''C2001～C2198''': From Beijing South Station to Tianjin, non-stop.
'''C2201～C2268''': From Beijing South Station to Tianjin, with stops at Wuqing Station (武清站) or Yizhuang Station (亦庄站);
'''C2271～C2298''': From Beijing South Station to Tanggu Station of Tianjin.
The new C trains take only 30 min between Beijing and Tianjin, cutting the previous D train time by more than a half. The ticket price (as of Aug 2008) is ¥69 for the first-class seat and ¥58 for the second-class seat.

===By car===

Some spots in Tianjin, including roads and bridges, have names from Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People (for example, Minquan Gate on Zhonghuan Road). Names harkening back to the era of the Republic of China on the mainland also appear (e.g. Beiyang Road). Many roads in Tianjin are named after a Chinese province or city. Also, Tianjin is unlike Beijing, in that very few roads run parallel to the major four compass directions.

Tianjin has three ring roads. Unlike Beijing, the Inner and Middle Ring Roads are not closed, traffic-controlled roadways and some often have traffic light intersections. The Outer Ring Road is the closest thing to a highway-level ring road, although traffic is often chaotic and sometimes more than chaotic.

'''Inner Ring Road''' (neihuan)

'''Middle Ring Road''' (zhonghuan)

'''Outer Ring Road''' (waihuan)

Tianjin's roads often finish in dao (道 avenue), xian (线) line, more used for highways and through routes) and lu (路 road). Jie (街 street) is rare. As Tianjin's roads are rarely in a cardinal compass direction, jing (经) roads and wei (纬) roads often appear, which attempt to run more directly north-south and east-west, respectively.

The following seven expressways of China run in or through Tianjin:

'''Jingjintang Expressway''', from Beijing, through Tianjin's urban area, to Tanggu District / TEDA

'''Jinghu Expressway''', from Jinjing Gonglu Bridge to Shanghai (together with Jingjintang Expressway, this is the expressway from Beijing to Shanghai)

'''Jingshen Expressway''', through Baodi District on its way from Beijing to Shenyang

'''Tangjin Expressway''', from Tanggu District, Tianjin, to Tangshan, Hebei—known in Tianjin as the Jintang Expressway

'''Baojin Expressway''', from Beichen District, Tianjin, to Baoding, Hebei—known in Tianjin as the Jinbao Expressway

'''Jinbin Expressway''', from Zhangguizhuang Bridge to Hujiayuan Bridge, both within Tianjin

'''Jinji Expressway''', from central Tianjin to Jixian County

The following six China National Highways pass through Tianjin:

'''China National Highway 102''', through Ji County, Tianjin on its way from [[Beijing]] to [[Harbin]]

'''China National Highway 103''', from Beijing, through Tianjin's urban area, to [[Tanggu]] District

'''China National Highway 104''', from Beijing, through Tianjin Municipality, to [[Fuzhou]]

'''China National Highway 105''', from Beijing, through Tianjin Municipality, to [[Macau]]

'''China National Highway 112''', circular highway around Beijing, passes through Tianjin Municipality

===By bus===
Tianjin is well connected with other cities via bus. The price from Beijing is about ¥30.

There are also two school bus lines linking Nankai and Tianjin Universities and Tsinghua University. They depart daily at 3:45PM and 4:45PM from Tsinghua's North-West Gate.

===By boat===

Tianjin is connected to [[Dalian]] as well [[Incheon]], [[South Korea]], by passenger boat.

[[Kobe]], [[Japan]] - is served by a weekly China Express Line [http://www.celkobe.co.jp/] ferry, departing Kobe at 11:00 on Fridays and arriving in Tianjin at 14:00 on Sundays. It takes 51 hours to do the nearly 2,000&nbsp;km (1,242&nbsp;mi) crossing between the two cities. Tianjin Office Tel.:''+86'' 22-2420-5777

The port is named '''Xingang''' (新港), which is about 45&nbsp;km east to downtown Tianjin. The district Xingang located is named '''Tanggu'''. Tianjin Metro Line 9 (also known as the ''Light Rail'' by locals) connects Tanggu to downtown Tianjin. A train ride from Tanggu or TEDA metro stations to Tianjin's central railway station takes 40 minutes.

There is also a few direct high-speed trains serve '''Tanggu Railway Station''' every day, make a stop in Tianjin's central station before continue to Beijing South. A single trip from Tanggu to Beijing South Station takes just under an hour. Both Tanggu metro station and railway station are about 15 minutes away from the sea port by cab and should not cost you more than ¥20–¥30 by meter.

==Get around==

===By bus===

Founded in 1904, the Tianjin bus system was the first in China, and the metro was second in the nation (1970) and today the city is well served by public transportation. Within the city, traveling on a bus line that is less than 12&nbsp;km (7&nbsp;mi) will cost ¥1.5, while ¥1 will cover a journey on any line over 12&nbsp;km, even if you travel less than 12&nbsp;km (7&nbsp;mi) but on a line that is over this distance, the cost is still ¥1. It's well worth your time to look up popular bus routes. Buses are comfortable and clean.

===By taxi===

Taxis are abundant. The minimum cost for 3&nbsp;kilometers is ¥8 (plus ¥1 mandatory fuel surcharge), and ¥1.7 per kilometer thereafter. Taxis also charge for the time while the vehicle is stationary at ¥1.7 for every five minutes (cost is exempt for less than five minutes). It is strongly recommended to avoid taxis not waiting in the proper queue at popular places for tourists (such as a railway station). See note in the Get in-By train section above about how to avoid train station taxis. The same advice applies at tourist stops, it is best to walk a few blocks to a regular street to catch a metered taxi. Ride with illegal taxis at your own risk.

There are Tianjin tourist maps with destinations written in Chinese characters and English. Pointing at where you want to go will get you a long way with taxi drivers. It might be a good idea to take a magnifying glass along as many of the drivers have trouble with the small font.

You can rent a taxi driver for the day or even for just a few hours. The drivers are happy to wait, and the cost for two hours would be less than ¥100.  

Another caution about taxis is that there are toll roads in some parts of China. In a taxi, you will be expected to pay the base fare plus the toll fee. The driver pays the toll and receives a receipt at the toll booth. At your destination, you ask for the receipt(s) and pay that amount plus the base fare. If you are going a long way, you may also be asked to pay for the return toll fee. That is a legitimate request, although you could argue that the driver will pick up another fare to pay for the toll anyway.  You may or may not succeed with the driver. Tipping isn't common practice, as in most Chinese cities.

===By metro===

The second part is the residential area, with the first small Western-style residential area for foreign people who opened up concessions, whose residence next to the office area, close to Jiefang Road, around the former Italian concession in the east of Marco Polo Plaza. In the 20th century, due to the current situation, Tianjin's position in China had become very special and important. On one hand, social and political unrest made concessions a haven for ousted politicians and businessmen, on the other hand, Tianjin, had geographically profits for transporation and duty-free customs, was full of opportunities. Various dignitaries and rich people lived in Tianjin. Living in a small Western-style house was more comfortable and convenient than a traditional courtyard and the Fifth Avenue was located in a prime location of the British concession, thus people rushed in to build their houses here. The neighbourhood became Tianjin's rich area at that time. Tianjin was undoubtedly the first in term of the size of rich area among the affluent cities in modern China.</see>

* <see name="Former Concessions in Tianjin" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">The Concessions in Tianjin were concession territories ceded by the Chinese imperial Qing Dynasty to the great powers in Tianjin.
Tianjin's position at the intersection of the Grand Canal and the Peiho River connecting Beijing to the Bohai Bay made it one of the premier ports of northern China. Foreign trade was approved there for the British and French by the 1860 Peking Convention. Its importance increased even further when it was connected to the Tangshan coal fields by the Kaiping Tramway, the railroad that eventually connected all of northern China and Manchuria. Between 1895 and 1900, the two original powers were joined by Japan, Germany, Russia, and by Austria-Hungary, Italy and Belgium – countries without concessions elsewhere in China – in establishing self-contained concessions each with their own prisons, schools, barracks and hospitals. The European settlements covered 5 square miles (13 km2) in all, the riverfront being governed by foreign powers.
** '''Austro-Hungarian concession (1901–1917)'''
During the Boxer rebellion and its aftermath 1899-1901, Austria-Hungary participated in the Eight-Nation Alliance and helped in suppressing the rising. However, Austria-Hungary together with Italy sent the smallest force of any of the combatant nations. Four cruisers and 296 Hungarian enlisted soldiers were dispatched.
** '''Belgian concession (1902–1931)'''
The former Belgian Concession was established in 1902. Located on the eastern bank of the Hai River (Hai He), the Belgian government and business community did not invest in concession development, therefore there were not many buildings constructed in this area, and those that were built are no longer extant.
** '''British concession (1860–1943)'''
The British concession, in which the trade centres, was situated on the right bank of the Hai River below the native city, occupying some 200 acres (0.81 km²). It was held on a lease in perpetuity granted by the Chinese government to the British Crown, which sublet plots to private owners in the same way as was done at Hankou. The local management was entrusted to a municipal council organized on lines similar to those in Shanghai. The seat of government was the stately Gordon Hall, situated on Victoria Road (now Jiefang Lu).
** '''French concession (1860–1946)'''
The former French concession was established in 1860. After more than 100 years, almost every prominent building in the original concession is still extant, including the French Consulate, the Municipal Council, the French Club, the Catholic Cathedral, the French Garden and many others. Many of the bank buildings along the financial street (currently Jiefang Lu, formerly the Rue de France) are still in existence today.
** '''German concession (1899–1917)'''
Germany by the late 1870s was on a course of extensive economic involvement in several Chinese provinces, among them the Tientsin area. The German enclave south of the Hai River was situated between the British and one of the Japanese concessions. In July 1877 xenophobic groups threatened the life and property of German merchants in Tientsin. Local unrest intensified, mainly due to poor harvests and resulting famine, and Tientsin business interests requested armed protection. The German admiralty then dispatched the corvette SMS Luise to China. This initial show of support eventually evolved into a permanent presence in Chinese waters by initially modest German naval forces.
** '''Italian concession (1901–1947)'''
On September 7, 1901, a concession in Tientsin was ceded to the Kingdom of Italy (Regno d'Italia) by the Qing Dynasty of China. On June 7, 1902, the concession was taken into Italian possession and administered by an Italian consul. After World War I the Austro-Hungarian section was added to the Italian, doubling its size. It became the headquarters of the Italian Legione Redenta (an "Italian legio" made of irredentist troops in the defeated Austro-Hungarian empire), that fought in 1919 against Lenin's Soviet troops in Siberia and Manchuria.
** '''Japanese concession (1888–1945)'''
The former Japanese concession was established in 1888. The Japanese army occupied the entire city of Tientsin from 1937 until their defeat in 1945.
** '''Russian concession (1903–1920)'''
The former Russian concession was established in 1903. The former Russian concession in Tientsin (1903–1920), originally an area of more than 398 hectares, was never completed. Located on the eastern bank of Hai He River along a bend in the river, it was originally divided into two districts (east and west). In 1920 the Beiyang government of the Republic of China retook the land and concession from the Russian SFSR. In 1924, the Soviet Union renounced its claim on the concession.
** '''American concession'''
The United States never requested or received extraterritorial rights in Tianjin. A de facto concession was administered from 1869 until 1880, principally under the aegis of the British mission. Ultimately, the American concession territory became part of the British Concession in 1902. The United States maintained a permanent garrison at Tientsin from January 1921, by the 15th Infantry, US Army until 1938 and by the US Marine Corps until December 8, 1941, the day after Pearl Harbor was attacked by Japan.

The southern and northern canals are parts of the Grand Canal. The Southern Canal is joined by the Wei River at Linqing. The Northern Canal joins with the Bai He (or Chaobai River) at Tongzhou. The Northern Canal (sharing a channel with Bai He) is also the only waterway from the sea to Beijing. Therefore, early Westerners also called the Hai He the Bai He.

At Tianjin, through the Grand Canal, the Hai connects with the Yellow and Yangtze rivers. The construction of the Grand Canal greatly altered the rivers of the Hai He basin. Previously, the Wei, Ziya Yongding and Bai Rivers flowed separately to the sea. The Grand Canal cut through the lower reaches of these rivers and fused them into one outlet to the sea, in the form of the current Hai He.

**'''History'''
During the Boxer Rebellion, Imperial Chinese forces deployed a weapon called "electric mines" on June 15, at the Peiho river before the Battle of Dagu Forts (1900), to prevent the western Eight-Nation Alliance from sending ships to attack. This was reported by American military intelligence in the United States. War Dept. by the United States. Adjutant-General's Office. Military Information Division.

Like the Yellow River, the Hai is exceedingly muddy because of the powdery soil through which it flows. The silt carried by the water deposits in the lower reaches, sometimes causing flooding. The waters from the five major tributaries only have one shallow outlet to the sea, which makes such floods stronger. Because China's capital (and second largest city), Beijing, and the third largest city, Tianjin, both lie in the Hai He Basin, Hai He floods cause a significant loss. To alleviate flooding, reservoirs have been built and artificial channels dug to divert excess water directly into the sea. For example, the Chaobai river is diverted to the Chaobai Xin river and no longer joins with the Northern Canal.</see>

The first floor serves as a living room, a dining room, guest rooms and a kitchen, while the second floor as bedrooms, a library and a chamber. The exterior walls and balconies with projecting brims were used to add more room to the building.

In front of the garden will be built a garden, in which enormous poplars, pagoda trees and cloves are planted and some ponds and pavilions are constructed. Besides, a reception office, a kitchen, a garage and a tennis court will be built on the northeast side of the garden.

No longer the central business district, it isn't a very busy street, with noticably less car and pedestrian traffic than other parts of the city, making it a good place to spend a couple of hours wandering. Most of the buildings now house local Chinese banks so feel free to have a look inside (though staff may object to photography) at the interiors, many of which feature original wooden panelling and stained glass.

Ask some of the locals and they will try and compare it with the glitz and glamour of Shanghai's Nanjing Lu, possibly the most famous shopping area in the whole of China. With that in mind, it may seem that the people of Tianjin are making one hell of a claim. However, whilst Tianjin may still have quite a way to go in becoming the Shanghai of the north, Binjian does not deserve to be left in the shadows.
Making a serious comparison with Nanjing Lu may well be folly, but Binjiang does have several similar qualities. First, and possibly most striking, is the architecture. Like Shanghai, Tianjin also grew around a large colonial presence from Europe and America. Evidence of this is still relatively clear, if you can avert your eyes from the mesmerizing glare of neon signs, you will see that many of the buildings to which they are attached are of classical European design. Two glorious examples of this are the Xinhua bookstore and the city's main post office. Scratch away their rather boring modern-day uses and remove their bulky signs, and you discover two wonderful old buildings.</see>

The site lies on a steep and abrupt mountain ridge.

Huangya Pass was originally built over 1400 years ago in the Northern Qi Dynasty and reinforced with brick walls in the Ming Dynasty. In 1984, major repair work has been performed on over 3 kilometres of the wall including on 20 water towers and 1 water pass. The pass is a major tourist attraction within Tianjin and was listed as a site of relics protection in 1986.

**'''Overwhelming''': With its walls and towers built on mountain ridge with an average altitude of 738 meters, the Huangyaguan is really overwhelming. To the east there is the cliff, and the west, crags. It winds its way across mountains like a dragon. Guarding a stronghold, it has been the north entrance of Jinxian.

**'''Striking''': On the mountains with peaks rising one higher than another, the Great wall jumps its way up and down as a linkage between the cliff and crags. Since the mountain is sloppy, the steps are very high. In some sections, it looks like that the wall is running straight up or down. When you look down, you will feel dizzy at the sight.

'''Scenic''': On Huangyaguan, you will be able to enjoy both mountain scenery and waterfalls and springs.

'''Old''': With a history of over 1400 years, the ancient walls was first build in Beiqi, and reserved well until today. In Ming Dynasty, it was added with walls made of bricks.

How to get there: There are tourist bus available every weekend at the '''Northeast Bus Station of Tianjin''' and there are also buses available from the Tianjin Railway Station, but fewer. Worth a visit for its water run-off controls, well-preserved [[Great Wall of China]] towers, challenging hiking and striking scenery.</see>

Its purpose was to protect Tianjin from attack by wokou sea raiders.

Later, in 1816, the Qing government built the first two forts on both sides of the Haihe estuary in response to increased concerns about seaborne threats from the West. By 1841, in response to the First Opium War, the defensive system in Dagukou was reinforced into a system of five big forts, 13 earthen batteries, and 13 earthworks. In 1851, Imperial Commissioner Sengge Rinchen carried out a comprehensive renovation of the forts, building 6 large forts: two on the south of the estuary, called "Wēi" (威-Might) and "Zhèn"(震-Thunder, Tremor, Quake), three to the north, "Hǎi"(海-sea), "Mén"(门-gate) "Gāo" (高-high), and the sixth, the "Shitoufeng" (石头缝-Stone Seam) Fort, was built on a small ridge on the northern shore. Each fort had 3 large guns and 20 small caliber guns. Forts were constructed of wood, brick and an external curtain of two feet of concrete, the layering designed to avoid spalling and minimize artillery rounds' penetration. The forts were around 10 to 15m high, which located as they were in an exceedingly flat landscape, provided a critical vantage point.</see>

===Culture===

People from urban Tianjin speak Tianjin dialect, which comes under the Mandarin subdivision of spoken Chinese. Despite its proximity to Beijing, Tianjin dialect sounds quite different from Beijing dialect, which provides the basis for Putonghua, the official spoken language of the People's Republic of China.

Tianjin is a respected home base of Beijing opera, one of the most prestigious forms of Chinese opera.

Tianjin is famous for its '''Xiangsheng''' (相声) stand up comic crosstalk and comedians including Guo Degang and Ma Sanli. Ma Sanli (马三立) (1914–2003), an ethnic Hui and longtime resident of Tianjin, is renowned for his xiangsheng, a hugely popular form of Chinese entertainment similar to comedy. Ma Sanli delivered some of his xiangsheng in the Tianjin dialect. Tianjin, along with Beijing, is a center for the art of xiangsheng.

Yangliuqing (Green Willows), a town about 15 km west of Tianjin's urban area and the seat of Tianjin's Xiqing District, is famous for its popular Chinese New Year-themed, traditional-style, '''Yangliuqing colourful wash paintings''' (杨柳青年画). Tianjin is also famous for '''Zhang's clay figurines''' (泥人张) which are a type of colourful figurine depicting a variety of vivid characters, and Tianjin's '''Wei's kites''' (风筝魏), which can be folded to a fraction of their full sizes, are noted for portability.

===Worship===

Tianjin has a '''Buddhist Temple of Great Compassion''', a Catholic '''St. Joseph’s Cathedral''' (Laoxikai Church), a Catholic '''Our Lady of Victory Church''' (Wanghailou Church), a '''Tianjin Jewish Synagogue''' and a '''Roman Catholic Diocese of Tianjin'''.

There are a number of attractions of interest to the foreign travelers, in particular the colonial architectures and streetscapes that are a vestige of Tianjin's legacy as a treaty port. The architecture is concentrated in three main areas: Wu Da Dao(五大道), Jiefang Road North(解放北路) and the Italian Town(意大利风情旅游区) located to the west of the train station (see the previous section). All of these areas are fairly compact and flat, lending themselves well to walking tours.

Tianjin cuisine places a heavy focus on seafood, due to Tianjin's proximity to the sea. Prominent menus include the '''Eight Great Bowls''' (八大碗), a combination of eight mainly meat dishes. It can be further classified into several varieties, including the rough (粗), smooth (细), and high (高). The '''Four Great Stews''' (四大扒) actually refers to a very large number of stews, including chicken, duck, seafood, beef, and mutton.

Tianjin also has several famous snack items. '''Goubuli Baozi''' (狗不理包子) is a famous and traditional brand of Baozi(steamed stuffed bun) that is famous throughout China.

There are a number of expat bars catering to the visiting business community, most of which can be a little expensive (more than ¥25 for a small bottle of beer) so if you like something a bit more laid back and comfortable.

As far as '''clubs''' go, Tianjin is a big university city both for Chinese and foreign students so there are lots of places for dancing. The music policy tends to be mostly Western and Chinese dance, pop and hip hop/R&B, so if you have more alternative tastes in music the clubs are possibly not for you.

==Stay safe==
Tianjin is known to be as safe as any city in China. Safety is really not a big issue in Tianjin.

Generally you do not have to be too concerned about personal safety in China if you just follow the basics you would at home. Girls generally say they are happy to walk anywhere in the main city areas where there are lights. But if you come out of a night club drunk, you are an obvious target.

1) If you are going to a nightclub, it's best advised to avoid loud and anti-social behaviour. Chinese really don't appreciate this sort of behaviour. However, at places like Rainbow Bar, rowdy behaviour from foreigners is more acceptable.

2) Unlike Beijing, many tourist places, museums, temples and the Ancient Culture shopping areas close from 3-5 pm onwards.

3) There are several pedestrian bridge crossing but few tunnel crossings like Beijing. Many people cross at traffic lights or zebra crossiing. But generally especially since the roads are wide and new due to recent construction, road crossing should be done with care.

4) Follow the locals but do not take unnecessary risks.

5) Make sure your cab driver turns on the meter. Many try to take a foreigner to their destination and over charge them. If they do not turn it on either ask them to stop and get a new cab or refuse to pay at the end. Cheating Hotline: +86 22 23549000

6) Being a new train station, there is a bit of confusion when getting out of the Tianjin Station to your next connection. There is a taxi and bus hub. At the same time, there are many offering transport or day tours. It is ilegal and it is better to wait until you find a travel agency or use the public bus or meter taxi to get to your next destination. If you really want to get one, the price is generally below ￥30 to the downtown.

===International Banks===

Though credit and debit cards are gradually becoming more widely accepted at department stores and supermarkets most stores and all attractions still operate on a cash-only basis and only the very largest or most expensive shops accept foreign credit cards. It's generally best to ensure that you have a decent amount of cash on hand when going out. ATMs are located at virtually all bank branches, and most (though not all) of the large banks now accept foreign debit or credit cards. Bank of China branches all have the ability to take cards from foreign banks, and most offer English instructions. For more advanced financial transactions (converting currency or travellers checks, for instance) the best places to go are the Bank of China branch.
