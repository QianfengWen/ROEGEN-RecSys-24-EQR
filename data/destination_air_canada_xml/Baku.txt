'''Baku''' is the capital of [[ Azerbaijan]].

==Understand==

'''Baku''', also known as '''Baky''' or '''Bakı''', is the largest city in the [[Caucasus]] and the capital of [[Azerbaijan]]. Baku is on the coast of the Caspian Sea on the southern tip of the Absheron Peninsula. There are three major divisions in Baku: ''İçəri Şəhər'' (the ancient city), the Soviet built city, and the newest part of the city. The population as of January 2012 was 3,202,300.

===Climate===

[[Image:Flametowers-Baku.jpg|thumb|right|250px|World's first flame shaped towers in Baku]]
A curious fact about Baku is that its average year-round temperature (14.2°C/57.6°F)) matches the average temperature of the ''entire'' landmass of the earth to within a tenth of degree. Baku has a temperate-continental semi-arid climate. The average annual precipitation is about 239 mm. Summers are hot and dry, winters very cool, fairly wet and breezy. In some years, a lot of snow falls, and light accumulations of snow happen almost every winter. Precipitation is rare in the summer. However, seasonal temperature excursions are less than in many continental regions at this latitude (about 40 degrees north) owing to the presence of the Caspian Sea. Baku is very breezy most of the year.

'''Heydar Aliyev International Airport''' [http://www.airport.az/] ({{IATA|GYD}}) is situated 25 km (15 mi) from Baku city centre. It is served by major airlines including Aeroflot, Austrian Airlines, Azerbaijan Airlines (AZAL), Buta Airways, Turkish Airlines, Lufthansa and Qatar Airways, and a whole host of smaller airlines. One of the least expensive ways to get between Baku and [[Europe]] is via Aeroflot, with inexpensive flights to/from [[Moscow]] daily. Air Baltic also offers flights with good prices from/via Riga; Turkish low-cost carrier Pegasus Airlines has flights from Istanbul's Sabiha Gokcen Airport, however these are code-shared with Azeri flag-carrier Azal, and start from around $130 one-way. WizzAir offers a low-cost option from Budapest to Baku (from 39EUR one-way) - this was stopped in March 2015, but fortunately resumed again in March 2016.[https://wizzair.com/en-GB/about_us/news/wizzen358].

An airport express bus service with luggage space beneath the bus connects the airport and the city with stops at Koroglu metro station and 28 May metro station/area. The route is operated by modern comfortable coaches with decent legroom and even a bathroom on board. It runs every 30 minutes between 6am and 10pm and every 60 minutes at night time. One way ticket costs 1.30 manat (as of October 2018) and must be purchased before getting on the bus. When exiting either of the airport terminals, ticket machines are available on either side of the doors as you exit the airport. (The same machines are installed throughout the city bus stops and subway stations and feature somewhat basic (and therefore confusing) prompts in English; paper cards are sometimes out, so it's better to purchase a reloadable card at the airport if you plan to use public transport. The main screen on the ticket machines offers you two choices - purchase a reloadable (plastic) BakiKart for 2 manat and then load the cost of the fare (1.30 or more) onto it or purchase one time use paper BakiKart Express at cost of 0.20 manat (for 1.50 manat total). The plastic card can be used for buses and subway rides in the city; the Express paper card is not reloadable. 

For taxi ride to the city center, the lowest price you can get is 15-20 Manat (June 2016) but be prepared from them to ask for up to 60 Manat. Be aware that there is one single taxi company that is allowed to officially do business at the airport but you will be swarmed by many taxi drivers as soon as you exit customs. Police occasionally force out all cab drivers trying to do business on the fringes of the airport, leaving you stuck with a high fare.  Some taxis (purple London-style ones) have meters but many don't use them so you must make sure they turn them on or negotiate a price in advance.  If you cannot find a reasonable price, go out of the airport, past the taxi stand, and ask the cabbies in the far end of the parking lot.  Be cautious since the majority of Baku cabs are unmarked.  Don't let the cab driver renegotiate the price with you.  It is a common trick to ask for much more on arrival to your destination.  You are not obligated to pay what they demand.

In comparison, Uber offers honest and transparent service and price. For those without local SIM and mobile internet, note the airport free wifi extends to glass entrance door to the waiting hall, once exited the hall you have to have your belongings scanned again upon entrance into the hall. Late September 2017 your contributor used UberSelect (costing marginally more than UberX) from airport to Baku city for 12AZN.

For 5 Manat you can take a cab from the airport to Metro Koroglu (former Azizbeyov). From there it's four to six stations to the city centre - but only from 6AM until midnight.

===By train===

Overnight trains are avalible from [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]] on a regular basis. Moscow (60 h) has departures three times a week, there is also a once-weekly train leaving [[Saint Petersburg]] (70 h) on Sundays. Other cities with less frequent connections include [[Novosibirsk]] (80 h) and [[Yekaterinburg]] (75 h). [[Kiev]] (68 h) has a service leaving every Saturday, with carriges added from several other cities. Also, on some occasions there is a direct train from the Belarusian city of [[Brest (Belarus)|Brest]] (81 h) which also stops in [[Minsk]] (76 h). 
There is an overnight sleeper from [[Tbilisi]] in neighboring [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] leaving daily at 20:40. Journey times is 14 hours (officially 12:15, but delays are common due to long border control). There are 12 stops before Tbilisi, including [[Ganja]] and [[Rustavi]]. A journey in second class (four beds per cabin) from Tbilisi will set you back 51GEL, while first-class (two beds per cabin) costs 97GEL per person. The only way to buy ticket '''from''' Tbilisi is at Tbilisi railway station, the counter only accepts cash. First-class carriage is air-conditioned, but it repeatedly switches on and of on every stop, so mind wrapping yourself up well not to catch cold. Toilets in the train don't have any toilet paper and even running water could be a problem. Most stops are very short, and it's hard to find any food sold (drinks only).

Domestic trains are very cheap, most journeys cost less than 3AZN which makes it cheaper then staying in an hostel.

===By bus===

Buses run between Baku and [[Lankaran]] (departs: 11:50AM, 3PM, 4PM, 5PM), Sheki (hourly, 4AZN, 7-hr trip). International buses also operate from destinations in [[Iran]], [[Turkey]] and from Tbilisi. A common rule of thumb for bus rates in Azerbaijan seems to be about 1AZN per hour ride. Example: Agstafa is about 7 or 8 hours away from Baku. About 8AZN.

===By minibus===

Minbuses operate between Baku and Sheki (6 hr), [[Lankaran]] (5 hr), Xachmaz (3 hr), [[Saatli]] (5 hr), and [[Imishli]] (4 hr).

===By ferry===

The phone number of the sea terminal (''Daniz Vagzal'') is 994 12 447 7314.

Ferries operate between Baku and Russia, Iran, [[Kazakhstan]], (Irregularly, approximately every 7-10 days), and [[Turkmenbashi]], [[Turkmenistan]] (steerage bed, US$50, 2-day trip, bring food).

Make sure you have appropriate visas before embarking, if necessary.

==Get around==

[[File:Baku Metro map.jpg|thumb|Baku Metro map]]
===By car===
Road traffic in Baku is quite heavy and the style of driving is a bit aggressive for both private and public service.

===By taxi===

London taxi cabs have been recently introduced in Baku, and travel fees are 0.70AZN per km.A taxi costs 4-10AZN for trips within the centre of Baku, and to the airport cost 14AZN on the meter - albeit at 6am with little traffic. You are anyway suggested to agree or double-check the price for the service before getting on the car. Uber and Bolt are also operating in Baku and have some of the lowest prices.

===By bike===

A great way to cover a lot of ground is to use a bicycle. But because of its lunatic car drivers and the chaotic traffic, Baku is not really a great town to get around in by bicycle. Except for the up-town, the city, including old town (''İçəri Şəhər'') and downtown is almost dead flat, and though there are some streets that are safe to ride, there is almost always a chaotic and dangerous amount of traffic on the road.

There are no separate bike lanes on the streets, no way of using the sidewalk with super high gutters (10"+) curbed in stone and no pram or stroller ramps so the streets are not designed for rolling objects. So cars and cyclists are forced to share the streets of Baku. The city centre is considered not to be bike-friendly and the locals strongly advise against it. The traffic over the past few years has become seriously chaotic and congested with hostile, incompetent and completely inconsiderate drivers. There were more than 285 deaths and 1185 injuries recorded in 2012 just for pedestrian crossings. The actual figure for deaths is estimated to be closer to 1000+. The reason for this ridiculously high figure can be seen on any street in Baku. Its been estimated that more than 40% of drivers have never actually sat and passed their drivers licence test, but simply just 'acquired' one. 

While cycling on the street is not recommended, except for the clinically insane, the Boulevard on the other hand offers an amazing place to stretch out. The new area of the Seaside Boulevard was opened in May 2012 and extends from the 'Baku Sports Palace' (Bakı İdman Sarayı) to the 'National Flag Square'. There is a car park near the Sports Palace and is the perfect starting point. The length of the new boulevard is approximately 5kms. There are wide open terraces to explore all the way up to the flag with lovely restaurants, pubs and lounge-cafe's all along the way. This is soon to be extended in the other direction once the new Holiday Inn is completed on the foreshore and this will provide up to 10kms of scenic and traffic-free biking. Bike and pedal car rental is available on the Boulevard at a cost of 3AZN for 2hrs and 1AZN per hour after that. Pedal cars cost slightly more.

While Baku is a safe place, make sure to get a good lock (or two), and to use it if you intend to stop. If you are looking for a road, mountain or trekking bike, then there is a bicycle rental shop at the city centre called MyBike (Address: Asef Zeynalli Street, Ichari Shahar). If you want to know the best routes, you should get a copy of the beautifully designed 'Baku by Bike' plan, which is available at all bike rental points of MyBike.  Bike rental costs about 10-20AZN per day (approximately, AZN 1 = €1, as of 2012).

A passport or identity card must be shown and a refundable deposit is required.  While this service is quite convenient, be sure to bring ID or passport and contact information, including hotel phone number, to speed up the paperwork.

There are a lot of English and American ex-pats here in Baku so Mountain Biking is popular and there are some great rides to be had further out of town in the foothills. While these will test your ability on the other hand they will provide a stunning view of Baku city and the Caspian.

There are a number of 'clubs' or organised rides along the boulevard and into the hills. The bike shops can provide more details.

While different to back home, bike riding in Baku can be one of the most rewarding past times ever.

===By bus/minibus===

Buses and minibuses cost 0.30AZN per person and can take you to almost any place within Baku. Destinations are usually posted on the front and the right side of the bus. The website http://www.niim.az/en/bus-info shows the route and current location of every bus on an interactive map.

Unfortunately buses are not handicap-friendly, if you are on a wheelchair or you are limited in walking, you will find impossible or very difficult, to get on a bus due to the high steps to get on board.
The style of driving for the bus drivers is very aggressive, sudden breaking or accelerations may occur, you are suggested to hang safely once on board.

===By metro===

[[File:Baku Metro map.jpg|thumb|Baku Metro map]]

The metro goes to many places throughout Baku and it costs only 0.30AZN. It is the least expensive way to get around Baku besides walking. Ask a cashier or attendant. You must obtain a ''Bakı Metropiliten Kart'' (2AZN refundable deposit) and load it like a normal metro pass. Alternatively, you can use a ''Azerbaycan Sosial Kartı'' like the ones on some Azerbaijani ATM cards. The metro workers will be more than happy to help if spoken to in either Azeri or Russian, and some may understand English.

Be careful when transferring trains at the transfer stations (28 May and Jafar Jabbarli) as the signage is not easy to spot, the final destination of the train is on a display on each platform. At the exchange stations a display in the aisle will show the final destination of the upcoming trains, in such stations there is no need to move to another level to change the metro line. At the transfer stations, on the same platform, usually they alternate runs for the different lines so, there is one train for the red line after one run of the green one and so on. 
During peak hours, the metro can be really crowded so it might be common that you cannot get into the train and wait for the next two or three runs before you can. You are suggested to plan your travel keeping in mind that you could be delayed due to this issue.   

There have been reports of people being arrested while taking photographs of the metro station.

The stations are not handicap-friendly, if you are on a wheelchair or if you are limited in walking, bear in mind that there are no elevators to get to the platforms and the road-level is connected only by escalators.

'''Metro-etiquette'''

When entering in any station the metro staff will check your bags with a metal detector, you are requested to cooperate if they need to check the bag content.

Queues are not well respected, either if you are getting off or on the train, it is frequent to see travelers just got in to stop right in front of the exit, rather than moving aside or, those arriving at the platform, quickly jump into the train with no regard for the people already waiting there.

Step aside or wait in the aisle if you're not going to catch the upcoming train.

While into the train, seats are for women of any age and seniors, men are usually keen in offering their seat to them when they spot someone standing.

Due to the crowding of the metro you will be frequently bumped and pushed, especially at a station if you are near the exit, no one is going to make his/her excuses and they are not expecting yours when pushing others.


'''Refund BakiKart'''

If you want to refund the balance of your BakiKart this can only be done in the following metrostations;

20 yanvar
28 may
Nariman narimanov
Neftciler

Go to the cashier after the security check. The Bakikart itself will not be refunded.

===By train===

The Baku electric train runs through several parts of Baku and the surrounding area including [[Sumqait]]. 1AZN.

===On foot===

It is possible to get around Fountain Square, the Boulevard, and the old city by foot, but the entire city cannot be covered on foot.
The Azeri government recognises its traffic problems and hazards for pedestrians in Baku and has built an extensive network of underground pedestrian walkways to ensure pedestrians do not attempt to cross the roads. Numerous deaths and near misses have been recorded of people attempting to cross the road without using the underground walkways. They are everywhere in the city, especially near the Boulevard and look like subway entrances often with escalators, stairs but rarely with pram or disabled access ramps, some have lifts but they are not operational. It is highly recommended you locate them and use the underpasses.
According to roadworks and ongoing building renovations, you may find that the sidewalk is suddenly interrupted with no choice than going back and find an alternate route.

==Talk==

English and Russian are understood in many places throughout Baku, but it wise to still either bring an Azeri phrase book and/or brush up on your Azeri/Turkish/Russian before arriving. However, about 80% of population at least understands Russian, and about half the people under the age of 50 will speak at least a little English. Turkish is partially mutually intelligible with Azerbaijani, so people will likely understand you as long as you stick to simple words and speak slowly, although it may be a little bit harder for Turkish speakers to understand Azerbaijani than the other way around. 

English is well catered for in most shops, restaurants and bars as a result of 15+ years of expats from the oil industry. Very easy to make yourself understood with little local language skills.

==Drink==

{{infobox|A Cultural Note|Although tea houses (''çay xanalar'') in Baku usually allow women to enter, in the regions, it is often unusual for females to enter such establishments. Women drinking in Baku is a la mode, but it is taboo for women in the regions of Azerbaijan to consume alcohol.}}

===Tea Houses (''Çayxanalar'')===

There are many outdoor tea houses (''çayxanalar'') that serve tea and sweets to people in their own individual nooks.  Going to them can be a great way to get a sense of the local culture.  If you are adventurous, try challenging a local Bakuvian to a game of backgammon (nard) or dominoes.

===Cafés===

There is a good selection of cafés dispersed throughout Baku.  Expect to pay Western prices for your coffee.

==Contact==

===Internet===

Internet cafes in Azerbaijan are called "internet klubs" and they are found throughout Baku. Some coffee houses provide wireless internet, but they are quite rare in Baku. Recently public wi-fi service was implemented the central areas.  One "klub" with fast internet downtown is VIP, U.Bunyadzade 3.  They also have a lot of games you can play.

===Post office===

[[Image:Poct_Small.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Azerpost Office]]

Azerbaijan Post locations are dispersed throughout Baku. Mailing an international letter generally costs 0.8AZN.

===AZAL===

As Azal seems to be in a permanent state of flux as to where their offices are located, pop into a travel agent and ask about tickets very carefully before buying anything.  In some cases, like Nakhchivan or last-minute flights, you WILL ABSOLUTELY have to go this every-moving central office during a few random opening times in order to get your tickets processed.  One travel agent who can guide you buy phone is reachable at +994 55 4201220 or +99412 5551320 or 5981619.

==Stay Healthy==

==Stay safe==

Baku is considered a safe city,  nevertheless common sense is useful as in all other big cities. Homeless people do not harass or attack people and are very safe to be around. The '''biggest''' problem in Baku is driving. Many drivers do not obey rules and speed. Safety belts are universally ignored and some cabs don't have some or any.

===Emergency contact numbers===

* Ambulance: 103
* Fire: 101
* Gas Emergency 104
* Speaking Clock 106
* Police: 102

You must speak in Azeri, Turkish or Russian to communicate your needs. It would be a good idea to memorize key phrases before coming to Azerbaijan - see the [[#Talk|'''Talk''' section]] for phrasebooks.

===Safety tips===

The roads can be treacherous at night due to unseen potholes and dimly lit cars. Most areas in and near the downtown are mostly safe. There are some underpasses under particularly busy roads (some with escalators), and some zebra crossings and traffic lights. Watch out for traffic police if otherwise crossing a busy road, they may try to fine you 20AZN for a traffic offence (even though the locals do it constantly.)

Try to stay away from the outskirts.

===Crossing the street===
Be aware that it is illegal according to Azerbaijani law to cross the street if there is an underpass. Police will give you a fine!

==Cope==

==Get out==

*The '''Petroglyphs of Gobustan''' are protected as a national park about 50 km to the south, and date back as far as the 12th century BC. The invading armies of Alexander the Great and Trajan also left some interesting grafitti. Significance of the archelogical finds are highlighted in a museum in the park.

*A ferry departs daily from Baku across the Caspian Sea to [[Turkmenbashi]], [[Turkmenistan]]. This ferry has become somewhat of a sleeper hit with backpackers on the Silk Road, but is very uncomfortable and should only be taken by adventure-seekers.

*A ferry depart irregularly to [[Aktau]] in [[Kazakhstan]] (every 7-10 days maybe). Docks are located 2 km to the west of the old town.  It is difficult to get tickets!

*'''[[Sheki]]''', which is a 7 hour bus ride 250 km to the west northwest, is a beautiful city in the Caucasus mountains with lots to see and do, including the Khan's Palace, a 17 century architectural wonder. 

*Buses take international travelers onwards from Baku to [[Iran]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].

*The Baku Airport is one of the few in the world offering flights to '''[[Nakhchivan (region)|Nakhchivan]]''', an exclave of Azerbaaijan. Travelers heading that way should book a flight from here.

*Go and enjoy the resorts and oil baths in [[Naftalan]], 250 km to the west.

*Relax by the Caspian in [[Nabran]], Azerbaijan's biggest tourist destination for international travelers and a coastal city close to [[Xachmaz]].
