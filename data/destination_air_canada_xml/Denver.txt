'''Denver [http://www.denver.org/]''' is the capital of [[Colorado]] and the largest city in the [[Rocky Mountains]] region of the [[United States]]. Known as "The Mile-High City", Denver sits at an altitude of 5,280 feet (1,600 m) above sea level and lies where the Great Plains give way to the Rocky Mountains. Denver is a large city and one of the fastest growing in the U.S.

[[Image:Denver skyline.jpg|thumbnail|The Denver skyline]]
Denver is a bustling city of more than 600,000 people supporting a fast-growing metropolitan area of nearly 3 million people. The city embraces its cowboy and mining past but also looks toward the future with a vibrant arts and performing arts scene, dozens of great outdoor festivals, and distinct neighborhoods each offering a unique experience. You'll find everything a cosmopolitan city has to offer including a spectacular view of and easy access to the beautiful Rocky Mountains, which are only 12 miles (19 km) west of town.

Denver does have its growing pains. Urban sprawl is becoming a problem, with the metropolitan area sometimes growing faster than the infrastructure can really handle, especially with public transportation. Denver is generally a driving city, and some problems with pollution and traffic are a part of everyday life. Large mass transportation and freeway expansion projects have recently been completed, including the popular light rail system.

Denver residents enjoy a temperate climate and about 300 days of sunshine per year, with four pronounced seasons.  

Although known for its heavy snowfalls, which can occur between October and April (sometimes even in September and May), Denver experiences average winter temperatures warmer than those of cities along Mid-Atlantic, the Midwest and New England. The city typically receives about 60 inches (153 cm) of snow per year, averaging about one storm per season totaling 12 inches (30 cm) or more. While daytime temperature typically rise to the 40s (4-9° C), evenings cool considerably, often dropping into the teens. "Chinook" winds, which warm as they descend from the mountains can occasionally bring unseasonably warm temperatures in the 60s and 70s (15-24° C) for days at a time. If you're planning to visit Denver during the winter, be prepared with full winter gear just in case as -20° F (-29° C) is not unheard of, but also pack a light sweater and t-shirt.

[[Image:Denver Lightning.jpg|thumbnail|Evening thunderstorms are common in late spring and fall]]

Spring in Denver is pleasant, though generally rather brief.  Trees begin budding by late March and are in full leaf by mid April to mid May.  March, on average, is Denver's snowiest month.  

By June, Denver enters its summer season.  Temperatures typically rise in earnest at this time, with most heat waves beginning in mid-June and continuing through August. July is usually Denver's hottest month with temperatures in the high 80's to over 100 (31-38 °C). The city averages 43 days per year over 90 (32° C).. 

June is hot, dry, and usually clear, but by mid-to-late July, the Southwest monsoon kicks in.  During monsoon season, from mid-July to late August or early September, the majority of days begin sunny, clear, and warm, then gradually become increasingly overcast, cool, and drizzly by late afternoon, with brief thunderstorms occurring around sunset and into the evening.  

By late August, temperatures begin to drop with a noticeable difference between daytime and nighttime temperatures. As the days get shorter through September and October, daytime temperatures drop to the high 50's to mid-60's (14-18 °C). Slather on that sunscreen all summer long; the rays are strong and the air is dry, with temperatures often reaching the upper 90s (~35 °C)in July and August.

Autumn is a peaceful time to visit, with mild temperatures, little severe weather and lots of that famous clear blue sky. You'll get to see the trees display their fall colors, which usually peak around mid-September in the mountains and October in the city itself. October usually brings the first snowfall of the season to Denver, although it's very light. By November, it's clear that winter is on its way, with plenty of clouds, some snow and much cooler temperatures.

[[Image:Denver International Airport terminal.jpg|thumbnail|The Denver International Airport main terminal.]]
'''Denver International Airport''' [http://www.flydenver.com/], ({{IATA|DEN}}, {{ICAO|KDEN}}).  Commonly referred to as ''DIA'', it is located around 18 miles (29 km) northeast of downtown. Frontier Airlines, United Airlines, and Southwest Airlines all maintain hubs in Concourses A, B, and C respectively. Most other major domestic carriers also have service here. In addition, Aeroméxico, Air Canada, British Airways, Copa Airlines, Edelweiss Air, Icelandair, Lufthansa, Norwegian, Volaris, and WestJet offer service to international destinations. 
*  '''Frontier Airlines''' [http://www.frontierairlines.com/].  Discount carrier with its hub at DIA's Concourse A and service to and from over 60 cities in the United States and Mexico.
* '''United Airlines''' [http://www.united.com/].  The largest carrier at the airport, with service across the nation and the world from Concourse B.
* '''Southwest Airlines''' [http://www.southwest.com]. The quintessential discount airline maintains its fastest-growing hub in Concourse C.

The airport is set amidst rolling plains with the towering Rocky Mountains and Denver to the west. DIA is located in a rural area of Adams County, quite far from any conceivable local destination.  This was a deliberate choice, to avoid the problem of being walled in over many years by development (which was why Denver had to replace its old international airport, Stapleton).  Unfortunately, this also means DIA is very far from off-airport hotels and restaurants. Efforts by Denver to develop airport land for such uses have been resisted by Adams County, since Adams would be stuck with the expense of supporting new residents who would commute to such businesses, while Denver would reap the tax revenue. 

The [https://www.flydenver.com/parking_transit/transit/a_line_commuter_train A Line] is a commuter train that runs from the airport to Union Station in Downtown Denver.  The A Line cost is $10.50 per day from any of the stations along the A Line and includes unlimited rides on the A Line as well as the entire RTD Light Rail system during a single business day. Trains usually run every 15 minutes during peak travel times, and every 30 minutes from 3-5 am. and 6:30 pm. to 1 am.  The one-way journey between DIA and Union Station takes at least 35 minutes, and RTD Transit Police usually inspect passengers' tickets and passes at least once during that time. 

DIA is also served by a few local bus lines, such as the 145X, 169L, AA, AB, and AT routes.

The main airport terminal, the Jeppesen Terminal, can be crowded at times due to a post-9/11 security redesign that created a single central screening station, followed by a train that passengers must take to Concourses B and C. It can take up to an hour to get from the ticket line to the gate, so travelers should plan on arriving at DIA at least 1.5 hours before their scheduled departure time.  There are a number of airport shuttles you can take from DIA to the city and destinations in the mountains.

DIA has gradually blossomed into a major international hub, but continues to experience growing pains. Major airlines, such as United, often run the same aircraft back and forth across the country through Denver several times per day on tight schedules, but do not base them at DIA.  Thus, one delay on the first flight of the morning can cascade through every other flight scheduled for that day, and trap hundreds of people in DIA's concourses as their connections are disrupted.  Although DIA has many scheduled flights that depart or arrive well after 9 PM, it still has virtually no post-security restaurants, stores, or services open after 9 PM.  The exceptions are a single McDonald's restaurant in Concourse A and vending machines in the other concourses.  Even worse, DIA is prone to severe weather delays. In the summer, they tend to be caused by thunderstorms during the Southwest monsoon season, and during the winter they tend to be caused by snowstorms.  

Denver's evening thunderstorms during the summer can sometimes result in the simultaneous cancellation of many inbound and outbound flights.  Unfortunately, the Denver metro area has not yet developed sufficient hotel room capacity to adequately accommodate all travelers stranded when that occurs.  This in turn means travelers arriving very late on badly delayed late night "red-eye" flights may be horrified to discover their hotel reservations may not be honored.  After all, by the time they arrive, travelers stranded by earlier cancellations have been offering ridiculous amounts of money to front desk staff for hours. This risk is one of several reasons for why red-eye flights into Denver are so affordable.

DIA is one of the most expensive airports in the United States at which to rent a car, with subcompact vehicles going for base prices of at least $50 per day and up (''before'' taxes and additional charges like CDW/LDW).  Rental cars can be found in Denver and its suburbs for half the price of their DIA counterparts, but nearly all off-airport rental car depots have very limited hours and are inconvenient to reach from DIA. 

====Private Aviation====

There are two airports surrounding Denver available for private and general aviation. Most private flights prefer using Centennial Airport ({{ICAO|KAPA}}), located 18 miles to the south of Denver in the suburb of Englewood, near where I-25 meets CO-470. Centennial offers 4 private terminals and around-the-clock customs services. 

[https://www.jeffco.us/airport Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport] ({{ICAO|KBJC}}) is also available 16 miles to the northwest near Broomfield, and is the closest airport to downtown Denver. Air charter companies such as Mountain Aviation [http://mountainaviation.com/] and Private Jets Colorado [http://www.privatejetscolorado.com/] offer access to aircraft rentals at all 3 Denver airports, ranging from economical single & twin engine prop aircraft, to luxury business jets.

On warmer days, the air density from the high altitude can make takeoffs difficult. As result, both Centennial and Rocky Mountain Metro feature relatively long runways so planes have enough room to depart. Flight visibility in the Denver area is often in excess of 100 miles (160 km); weather fronts tend to travel quickly north-south along the front range. For small planes, any direction but west is a good choice.

[[Image:Denver Bison Herd Genessee Park Colorado.JPG|thumb|Since 1914, the City of Denver has maintained a bison herd on the outskirts of town at Genessee Park. The herd is still easily viewed along Interstate 70.]]
*'''I-25''' (north and south), '''I-70''' (east and west), and '''I-76''' (northeast) are the major interstates leading in and out of the city.  I-225 and I-270 cross the Denver area.
*'''U.S. Highway 40''' connects Denver to [[Salt Lake City]] to the west.
*'''Interstate 70''' connects Denver to Summit County, the location of many major ski areas, to the west.
*'''Interstate 25'''  connects Denver to [[Colorado Springs]] in the south and [[Cheyenne]], Wyoming in the north.
*'''U.S. Highway 36''' connects to the northwestern suburbs and on to [[Boulder]].
*'''C-470''' Connects to the southern end of E-470 (also accessible from I-25) leading to the south, southwest, and western suburbs. 
*'''Toll Roads''' There are a couple of major toll roads in the Denver area, and they can help you avoid some serious rush hour traffic on I-70 and I-25.
**'''E-470''' connects the airport to the southeast, east, northeast and northwest suburbs, C-470 at its southern terminus, and the Northwest Parkway at its northern terminus, leading to [[Boulder]]. E-470 is a "cashless" toll road - there are no longer any toll plazas and no way to pay tolls except via an in-car device or a billing service. If renting a car, check to see if the rental car agency provides for proper billing; otherwise, you may be subject to billed tolls and hefty service charges. Tolls are $2-4 and without an in-car device, service charges can run to $25 or more.
**'''Northwest Parkway''' connects to the north end of E-470 leading to north, northeast and northwest suburbs, and [[Boulder]]. Also accessible from I-25. Tolls are up to $3 each, and booths accept only cash. There's no attendant between 10PM and 6AM, so pay attention to the signs; though some booths still accept exact change, others require you to pay online [http://www.nwpky.com] or by mail.

===By train===
*'''Amtrak''''s [http://www.amtrak.com/] '''[[California Zephyr]]'''  stops in Denver once a day at Union Station, continuing east to Chicago and west to Emeryville, California. [[Rail travel in the United States|trains]]  Connections are available to all light rail lines that serve Denver at this station, as well as a free shuttle which can take you further into downtown and to the State Capitol.

===By bus===
*'''Greyhound''' [http://www.greyhound.com] The bus station is downtown at 1055 19th Street, just a few blocks away from Coors Field and other central attractions. Serviced by Greyhound and skyRide buses, the station also has storage lockers that can be rented hourly. Expect the bus station to be crowded and dirty.
*'''Autobus Americanos''' [http://www.autobusesamericanos.us/EN/Home.shtml], Provides bus service to/from Mexico. The bus stop is located at 2147 N Broadway.

==Get around==

[[Image:Downtown denver.png|thumb|350px|Map of Downtown Denver]]

*'''Numbered streets''' run east-west in the north half of the metro area, including suburbs. Ellsworth Avenue is the "equatorial" street. Numbered streets increase as you travel north and are generally called avenues. Avenues south of Ellsworth are named.
*'''Named streets''' run north-south. Broadway is the "meridian" street. Ordered alphabetically going up as you travel east or west away from city center. Addresses on named streets correspond to intersecting numbered streets, so "1701 Broadway" is at 17th and Broadway. North-south streets are generally called streets, not avenues. 
*'''Downtown streets''': The diagonal layout of the downtown area can be tricky, especially for first-time visitors. North of Colfax and west of Broadway, the streets are canted 45 degrees from all other streets in the city. The transition between the two systems is confusing even for locals. Southeast-northwest streets are numbered, while southwest-northeast streets are named. As this was the original grid system of Denver, some vestiges of it exist outside of downtown, creating diagonal cuts in certain parts of the city. Some of those streets include Park Avenue, Speer Boulevard and Morrison Road.

===By car===

'''Renting'''

If you plan to go outside of downtown and the surrounding neighborhoods car rentals are the most convenient form of transportation. Local companies tend to offer better prices, but national chains might be more convenient as far as return policies and hours.

Rental companies include most major car rental chains.

'''Parking'''

Meters are free on Sunday and run until 10 p.m. on weekdays. After 10 p.m. at many of the meters where it was formerly free, it now is $1.00 per hour from 10 p.m. until 8 a.m. at the new "smart meters."  The meters say "overnight parking allowed" but you are still required to pay during this time, or you will get a $25 parking ticket. In the downtown area near Coors Field, The Pepsi Center, and LoDo, there is pretty much no free parking on weekdays. In some areas a few blocks from the city center there are a few non-metered spots within reasonable walking distance of downtown. However, just because you don't see a meter doesn't mean that parking is free. Denver is increasingly using "European-style" meters, where you purchase a paper ticket from a machine somewhere on the block and place it on your dashboard.  Also, many neighborhoods around downtown allow only permitted residents to park, so be sure to check the signs first.

It is worth noting that the city government has been cracking down on parking violations recently, so if you park at a meter with a flashing red light and don't pay, even for a few minutes, EXPECT TO GET A TICKET.  Meter violations will cost you a cool $25 ($50 if you don't pay up within two weeks).  Lack of change is no longer a problem, as all the meters in the downtown area are now equipped with credit card readers that accept Visa and MasterCard.  $1 will get you around an hour, depending on the location of the meter.

Areas outside of the downtown core (20th St, Speer, Wynkoop St, Colfax and Broadway) usually have meters that end at 6 p.m. and are free on weekends, so parking is much easier during those times. The area just northwest of downtown, across the train tracks from Union Station, has free 2-hour parking spots (on Wewatta Street just before the Park Avenue bridge).

===By public transit===

[[Image:Denver-lightrail.jpg|thumb|The light rail station at 16th and Stout in downtown Denver.]]

The '''RTD''' (Regional Transportation District) [http://www.rtd-denver.com/] operates public transit throughout the Denver area, including buses and light rail.

In 2004, voters approved FasTracks, a plan to significantly expand Denver's public transportation system. However, due to budget problems, the expected completion of this plan is still in the future.

Denver's existing '''light rail''' [http://www.rtd-denver.com/LightRail/index.html] system can efficiently get you from downtown to various points in the metropolitan area. One light rail line travels parallel to I-25 to the southern part of the Denver metro area past the Tech Center. Another light rail line connects downtown Denver to Englewood and Littleton. Other lines run along I-225 through Aurora, west from downtown though Lakewood to Golden, and soon from downtown to the northwest through Wheat Ridge.  There are also commuter rail lines to Arvada, Wheat Ridge, Westminster and to Denver International Airport. Bus rapid transit runs along US 36 through the northwest suburbs to Boulder Most rail lines get you to downtown Denver either through central downtown via the Convention Center or to Union Station past INVESCO Field and the Pepsi Center. Light rail tickets must be purchased (cash, credit or debit card accepted) from vending machines at the stations before boarding the trains. They cost $3.00 Local (1-2 zones), $5.25 Regional (3 zones), $10.50 (airport zone).  

[[Image:Colorado Convention Center.jpg|thumb|Colorado Convention Center and central transportation hub]]
The backbone of Denver's transportation system is the buses. RTD buses are $3.00 for a one-way local trip, and with payment you receive a transfer that's valid for three hours. There is also a '''free shuttle''' [http://www.rtd-denver.com/FREEMallRide.shtml] along the 16th Street pedestrian mall, which is a little over a mile long and takes you close to most major places downtown. More information about RTD can be found at the Union Station bus concourse or on the RTD website.  Local routes (denoted by a number) crisscross the city, supplemented by 'Limited' buses that stop less frequently on major arteries like Colfax and Colorado Boulevard.  These buses are denoted by an 'L' after the route number, and cost the same as a Local route.

RTD also operates limited intercity regional coach service, mostly to the north suburbs and Boulder/Longmont.  These coaches leave from the Union Station bus concourse and will have letters designating their routes.  Fares start at $5.25 one way.  If you're in Colorado to ski or board on a budget, Eldora Mountain Resort in Nederland can be reached from Denver via the NB1 and NB2 buses.

Make sure to have change before you use SkyRide or buses. Fare boxes on the buses and coaches do not give change, and vending machines at the stations give change in $1 coins, quite hard to spend later. Neither fare boxes on buses nor most ticket machines at stations accept cards - cash only!

===By bike===
Denver has a large network of bike trails leading all over the city.  The city has a fiercely loyal cycling culture, and it's reflected in the abundance of bike lanes and trails in and around downtown.  Main trails run along both Cherry Creek and the Platte, and bike lanes run down many downtown streets.  The lanes are sometimes dedicated and sometimes run with traffic, and are marked by a stencil of a bike in the street.  The city's designated routes are signed, and you can pick up a bike map at the info centers downtown and at many bike shops. 

Denver recently launched a bike share program [http://denver.bcycle.com]; you can purchase a membership online or at any of the 50 stations throughout the city, choose a bike, and start exploring. Rides of less than 30 minutes incur no fee, while there is a small fee for longer rides. 

Don't be afraid to assert yourself in traffic when there is no bike lane - the drivers are, while impatient sometimes, for the most part respectful.  Bikes are treated legally like traffic in Denver, and (while admittedly rare), you can get tickets for running red lights and stop signs.  Bikes are also expected to ride as far to the right as practicable, unless you're riding in a group of 3 or more - in which case you are considered (and can behave like) a car.  Neat, huh?

Bikes are required to have front lights at night, and a good lock is recommended in areas around downtown.  Bike theft happens frequently.

Denver is a vibrant city with plenty of attractions for visitors, plus a diverse collection of neighborhoods that can be attractions in themselves. Many of Denver's older areas are the perfect density for exploration; you'll find an interesting mix of apartments and homes with flowery front gardens, wide flagstone sidewalks, bright green lawns and big, shady trees. Capitol Hill, Highlands, Baker, Berkeley, Uptown, Sloan's Lake, Cheesman, Washington, City and Congress Parks are just some of the neighborhoods bustling with people and places to see. 

Denver has many beautiful parks that are full of colorful gardens, meandering paths, crystal clear lakes, abundant wildlife and recreation opportunities. The city has a rich pioneer history, and there are plenty of museums where you can learn all about it. It's also a very environmentally conscious city, with one of the nation’s first municipal “Green Fleets”, public transit vehicles using hybrid and alternative fuel and a city tree-planting initiative. Hop on a green bus, grab a bike or just walk around to discover Denver.

Late spring and early autumn are excellent seasons to do things outdoors in Denver. Besides the city's various lush green parks, there are plenty of outdoor festivals, sports, and gondola rides. (Yes, gondola rides.) In winter, the snow-peaked mountains in the distance and the crisp air on your cheeks make it the perfect time to tour Denver's famous breweries or check out the downtown arts scene.

There are a number of shopping areas in Denver. 

*The '''16th Street Mall''' runs the near entire length of 16th St in downtown Denver.  It is home to a number of chain stores, as well as novelty shops.  It is dominated by the Denver Pavilions, an "urban mall," on the southeast end of the street. Effective December 1st 2017, smoking/vaping is prohibited within 50 feet of the Mall.

*The '''Cherry Creek Shopping District''' [http://www.ShopCherryCreek.com] sits southeast of downtown Denver, and hosts some of the most expensive stores in the metropolitan area.  The Cherry Creek Shopping Mall is the epicenter of this district.

Like Larimer, it is home to rich old architecture (as well as a few modern pieces).  It is anchored by the Tattered Cover (see below) and hosts a ton of shops, mostly in fashion, furniture, and big chains like OfficeMax.

*'''Larimer Square''' offers some of the best shopping districts in the city and was one of the first urban shopping concept, dating back to the 1960's.  The area is full of all kinds of stuff from clothing to furniture.  Check out the district's rich history, as well. The main part is between 14th and 16th Streets.

==Eat==

Mexican food is abundant and satisfying and takes a local Denver flavor.  Green Chile is the order of the day: a brown, chunky and spicy sauce made from pork and Pueblo or Hatch green chilies that works well on everything from chorizo and eggs to tamales. Denver is also known for "western" food using ingredients such as angus beef, buffalo, rattlesnake, cutthroat trout and Rocky Mountain oysters. The city also embraces its cultural diversity with a wide-range of ethnic restaurants. Southeast Asian restaurants are especially abundant with a multitude of Thai and Vietnamese restaurants in every style and price range. Denver has most types of cuisine as other large cities and has several restaurants recently noted in top food publications. A recently passed bill had outlawed smoking in bars and restaurants statewide. However, some places with outdoor patios still allow smoking there.

The restaurant section of the weekly independent newspaper '''Westword''' [http://www.westword.com/] (available for free every Thursday at newsstands and locations across the city) is a good place to find the food you're interested in for your price-range and location.  Below is a sampling of some consistently good choices.

*Denver has recently grown into its natural position of being a true Donut Town

*<eat name="Glazed & Confuzed Donuts" alt="" address="5301 Leetsdale Drive" directions="" phone="303-524-9637" url="http://www.gcdonuts.com/" hours="" price="" lat="" long="">When doughnuts tastes fresh and bouncy and boast a bevy of unique, inspired flavors, the shop making said treats surely stands out. At Josh Schwab's Glazed & Confuzed, such is the case, and it's not just the witty name that makes the offerings so good. </eat>

*<eat name="Habit Doughnut Dispensary" alt="" address="1553 Platte Street" directions="" phone="720-428-8565" url="http://www.habitdoughnuts.com/" hours="" price="" lat="" long="">The doughnuts at this hipster shop downtown aren't for everyone. But if you crave brioche doughnuts in flavors like strawberry jam, peanut-butter drizzle and candied peanuts, or mint-buttercream filling with mint-chocolate ganache, well, then, give Habit a go. French-toast doughnuts come with a "syringe" of maple syrup, and a range of streusels make an appearance on all sorts of daily flavors.</eat>

*<eat name="City Donuts " alt="" address="4918 East Colfax Avenue" directions="" phone="720-485-5706" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="">If you aren't looking, you might drive right past City Donuts' small storefront on East Colfax. Don't let this happen; after all, the quaint shop won our Best of Denver award last year for its sweet pastries for a good reason. The selection (lacking the newfangled inventions of other shops) may look a little dull, but those looks are deceiving. The yeast-risen options prove light, fluffy and totally addictive, while the cake doughnuts have a nice lemony freshness that sings with not-too-sweet frosting and multi-colored sprinkles. You might also want to try the apple fritters, which have a deep flavor and density perfect for dipping in black coffee or taking on the road. Just make sure you get there early: The doughnuts are made at the Aurora location, and they sell out just about every day. Second Location at 746 Peoria Street, Aurora (303-367-4603)</eat>

*<eat name="LaMar's Donuts " alt="" address="Multiple Locations" directions="" phone="" url="http://www.lamars.com/locations/" hours="" price="" lat="" long="">Ray Lamar opened his first LaMar’s Donuts in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1960. More than thirty years later he decided to franchise, and now you can find these sugary doughnuts in nine locations in Colorado, as well as in four other states. The concept is simple: lots of flavors, choices of cake and yeast-risen doughnuts, and a reputation for fresh and fun creations. Compared to other boutique shops in the city, the doughnuts at LaMar's are sweeter and more traditional, but sometimes that's all you want in a pastry. Choose from flavors such as caramel iced, maple iced with peanuts, old fashioned sour cream, pineapple cake and cherry-iced cruellers. The shop is a child's dream, with piles of doughnuts as far as they can see and so many to pick from you might have to buy them two. Luckily, LaMar's also specializes in coffee, perfect for washing down a Lamar's creation.</eat>

*<eat name="Voodoo Doughnut" alt="" address="1520 East Colfax Avenue" directions="" phone="503-241-4704" url="http://voodoodoughnut.com/" hours="" price="" lat="" long="">There might be magic in the doughnuts coming out of this bustling shop on Colfax. Otherwise, why would there constantly be a line to get these goodies? Voodoo Doughnut started in Portland, Oregon, and came to Denver in 2013, following a successful  24/7 model that constantly churns out super-fresh pastries that have developed a cult following. No matter what texture you crave, there's something for everyone here. Get yours in cake, yeast-raised or French cruller. Pop-culture options include the Old Dirty Bastard, a yeast-raised doughnut with chocolate frosting, Oreos and peanut butter; the Arnold Palmer, a plain cake doughnut with vanilla frosting that's dusted with lemonade and iced-tea powder; and the crunchy cereal-covered Captain My Captain. Don't leave without getting one of the signature voodoo-doll doughnuts, a fluffy specimen plumped with raspberry jelly and coated in chocolate. After all, how often do you get to eat a pastry shaped like a strange little man?</eat>

*<eat name="Winchell's Donuts " alt="" address="1301 S Broadway" directions="" phone="(303) 777-9361" url="http://www.winchellsdonutdenver.com/" hours="" price="" lat="" long="">These donuts are great.  The recipe has not changed much since the beginning and there is no reason to change it.  </eat>

And crucially, it is open around the clock to feed the morning downtown crowd and the late night intoxicated revelers</eat>

*'''Heaven Dragon''' 16255 W 64th Ave, +1 720 898-9909.  Though not in Denver proper (rather, it's in the suburb of Arvada) this often-overlooked Chinese restaurant may be among the best in the entire state of Colorado.  With prices that will feed even a large family for under $40, its food is consistently ranked by reviewers as spectacular, to the point where visiting politicians (congressmen, governors, even President George W. Bush) often go out of their way to stop there.  The atmosphere is superb--very formal and elegant, despite the low prices.  A bit of a hike from the city, however--20 or 30 minutes from downtown on a good day.

Without a doubt, this is as touristy as it gets, but it is nonetheless absolutely worth a visit. Famous for its game meat, both prosaic and rare, the buffalo tenderloin is exceptional, but more adventurous palates can go after the rattlesnake dip, alligator tail, ostrich medallions, or even yak steak! (Call ahead to check ostrich and yak availability.) The place is ''saturated'' in Old West kitsch, aging wood, and animal heads, and Th-Sa nights Roz Brown stops by to croon old cowboy tunes accompanied by his autoharp.</eat>
*'''The Fort''', 19192 Highway 8, Morrison.  Though a bit of a drive, The Fort is possibly Denver's most famous restaurant.  It sits just on the edge of suburban Denver and is perhaps most famous for hosting a dinner during the G7 conference in 1997. Reservations highly recommended.

==Drink==

Colorado produces more beer by volume than any other state and Denver ranks first for US cities. In fact, Colorado Governor (and former Denver mayor) John Hickenlooper was a microbrewer before running for office.  Notable breweries in Denver and environs include:
*''' Coors Brewery''' [http://www.coors.com/]
*''' Great Divide Brewing Co.''' [http://www.greatdivide.com/]
*''' Breckenridge Brewery''' [http://www.breckbrew.com/]
*''' Wynkoop Brewing Company''' [http://www.wynkoop.com]
*''' Bull & Bush''' [http://denver.citysearch.com/profile/1861914].  
*''' Stranahan's Colorado Whiskey [http://www.stranahans.com/]
*''' New Belgium''' [http://www.newbelgium.com/], maker of the very popular Fat Tire, is based to the north in [[Fort Collins]].  
*''' Rock Bottom''' [http://www.rockbottom.com], a national chain of brewpubs, is based in Louisville (near [[Boulder]]).

One should keep in mind that the effects of alcohol are magnified at higher elevations, so people may find themselves inebriated more quickly and with greater effect than they would at lower altitudes. Moderation is probably a good idea until you understand your body's reaction to alcohol and can acclimatize to its effects at higher elevations. 

That said, the following are some of the best bar-hopping locales in the city:

===Bars in Lower Downtown (LoDo)===

'''LoDo''' is the name Colorado locals have given the Lower Downtown district of Denver. It's a great place for meals, entertainment, and nightlife, where restored Victorian buildings now house more than 90 sports bars, brew pubs, jazz clubs, and restaurants.

*'''The Cruise Room''', 1600 17th St, +1 303 825-1107, [http://www.theoxfordhotel.com/cruise-room.html]. 1930's Art Deco Martini Bar inside the Oxford Hotel. Best Martinis in Denver! You can also order fresh seafood from McCormick's Fish House.
*'''Double Daughter's Salotto''', 1632 Market St, +1 303 623-3505. A modern and slightly goth bar for all the cool kids to hang out. The bar features some of the oddest and best ambiance in the city and is connected to Two Fisted Mario's, a pizza place that is open late so you can grab some grub after the bars close.
* <drink name="Falling Rock Tap House" alt="" address="1919 Blake St" directions="" phone="+1 303 293-8338" url="http://frth.com" hours="" price="" lat="" long="" email="" fax="">The Falling Rock is a beer geek's dream, with over 70 excellent beers on tap.  The selection changes from week to week, too, keeping the locals entertained and tipsy off of fine Belgians and microbrews.  It gets crowded after Rockies games, but during the off season, it's a great place to escape from the cold and warm up with a well-poured Belgian trippel. For that matter, it's a good place on an average night to "escape LoDo" and have a beer in a place where you'll be able to have a good conversation without shouting.</drink>
*'''NATIV Hotel - Stereo Lounge''', 1612 Wazee St, +1 303 572-3300, [http://www.nativhotels.com/stereolounge/]. The Lobby (main bar) is a retro and contemporary design of lighting, shag rugs, and comfortable lounge seating. DJs and live music.

* <drink name="My Brother's Bar" alt="Brother's" address="2376 15th St" directions="" phone="+1 303 455-9991" email="" fax="" url="" hours="11AM-2AM daily" price="Food: $4-10">Brother's is the oldest still-operating bar in Denver, steeped in the history of the Beat movement; Jack Kerouac was a regular here during his years in Denver.  Massive selection of premium choices and a fantastic single-malt scotch selection. Classical music plays, but don't expect to hear it on a really busy night. Good food, making this a great casual lunch option, including the JCB: a cheeseburger featuring Jalapeno Cream Cheese.  There's no sign on the bar so don't look for one, but it's right on the southeast corner of 15th and Platte streets.  This is where the locals go and regulars abound.  </drink>
*'''Nallen's Irish Pub''', 1429 Market St, +1 303 572-0667. A little piece of the Old Country in Denver, Nallen's has great nightly drink specials and a Tuesday night pub quiz.

===Bars in Capitol Hill & Other Neighborhoods===
'''Capitol Hill''' is the neighborhood directly east and south of the Colorado State Capitol, located on Colfax Avenue and Grant Street.

*'''Charlie Brown's Bar & Grill''', 980 Grant St, +1 303 860-1655. Charlie Brown's in another beat era hangout located at a hotel where Ginsburg and the gang used to stay. Has great happy-hours, a mostly local crowd, good food, and an agile piano player belting out tunes while you drink.
*'''The Church''', 1160 Lincoln St, +1 303 832-2383, part of the "SoCo" (South of Colfax) club district, the Church is one of the most popular dance clubs in the city, and as its name suggests, is housed in a former Episcopalian church. That however, does not prevent hundreds if not thousands of people from descending on the dancefloor every night to shake what God has given them.
*'''City O City''', E 13th Ave. You will find a changing handful of unusual brews on tap.  Grab a blueberry muffin or the vegan buffalo wings (which are excellent - and you can eat them without having to worry about a bone!) and people watch.
*'''Cricket on the Hill''' 1209 E 13th Ave, +1 303 830-9020. Denver's preeminent punk bar/club offers almost nightly live music, great specials and some of the best clientele to people watch in the city. CLOSED

And cheap late night drinks accompanied by some seriously plastered clientèle. Clearly not for everyone, but it has its place. If you are up for a real wild ride, order ''The Beaver'', a huge pitcher of impromptu God-only-knows-what, usually less than $10.</drink>
* <drink name="Lowry Beer Garden" alt="" address="7577 East Academy Blvd." directions="" phone="+1 303 366-0114" email="" fax="" url="http://www.lowrybeergarden.com/" hours="Summer Hours: 11am-12am" price="$">New in the Lowry neighborhood, this Beer Garden is in between two of the old airplane hangars that made up Lowry Air Force Base.

The Lowry Beer Garden also serves up your favorite casual fare with locally-made gourmet brats & sausages, freshly-baked pretzels, house-ground burgers, hand-cut fries and chef-created salads. </drink>

===Bars On Colfax===
'''Colfax Avenue''', described by Playboy Magazine as the "longest, wickedest, street in America," stretches 26 miles through Denver and its suburbs. Colfax has long had a "gritty" reputation for being home to prostitution and drug peddlers.

The many bars, restaurants and nightspots along the street give it a 24/7 ambience.

==Stay safe==
Denver is quite safe for a city its size. Use your common sense when traveling, particularly in downtown and some of the other inner-city neighborhoods. Denver has a quite visible population of homeless people, but the city has strict laws about accosting for money. In general, panhandlers harm no one. Downtown has a fairly active 24/7 population.

Still, it may be a good idea not to travel alone at night in some of the neighborhoods near downtown. Although the inner-city neighborhoods are not as bad as those in some other cities, they have more crime than the rest of the city. The rest of Denver is safe. It should also be noted that residents of Colorado are allowed to carry concealed firearms after completing training and a thorough background check.

===Emergencies===
Like the rest of the United States, the emergency number in Denver is 911. This will connect you to the local emergency services (police, medical, and fire). If you need to report a crime to the police, such as a burglary (not in progress), minor assault (no injuries and not in progress), car theft, etc. Dial +1 720 913-2000 and request for police assistance.

[The Denver Police][https://www.denverdonate.com/partners/denver-colorado/denver-police-museum] is the main police force for the Denver Metro area.

===Altitude sickness===
[[Image:One Mile Above Sea Level.jpg|thumb|Mile High Marker on the State Capitol building]]

'''Altitude sickness''' or '''Acute mountain sickness''' is an ailment that potentially anyone can have when they visit areas with higher altitudes than they are used to, due to decreases in barometric pressure (not oxygen content). Denver is called the Mile High City for a reason--at an altitude of a mile above sea level, one can start to experience some of the effects of altitude sickness though generally this condition becomes more pronounced at elevations around 8000 ft (2500 m) and above. Some normal changes may occur when people travel to higher altitudes that are not altitude sickness. These include the following:
* Hyperventilation (breathing faster and/or deeper than normal)
* Shortness of breath after exertion
* Changes in nightly breathing
* Awaking at night


The above are generally nothing to worry about, but problems with breathing may be helped by a drug called acetazolamide. If you think you may have problems, get advice from your doctor before traveling to Denver.

Some people get Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS), which can be serious, at the higher elevations you will experience if you are touring through the Rocky Mountains. A diagnosis of AMS is usually given if a person has a headache accompanied by one of more of the following symptoms:
* Loss of appetite, vomiting and/or nausea
* Fatigue or weakness
* Dizziness or light-headedness
* Insomnia, difficulty sleeping

Some people liken AMS to a bad hangover or worse. It occurs because your brain tissue swells at higher elevations than it is used to. If you are feeling unwell at high altitudes, assume that you are suffering from AMS unless there is another logical explanation that would be accompanied by other symptoms (food poisoning or a viral infection).

To avoid AMS, try to get to a lower elevation until your symptoms subside, drink lots of fluid to avoid dehydration, and avoid traveling at high rates of ascent. If the symptoms continue or worsen, '''travel to a lower altitude.''' AMS can turn into '''High Altitude Cerebral Edema (HACE),''' a potentially fatal condition where the brain swells so much that it ceases to function properly. Symptoms of HACE include confusion, inability to think clearly, lethargy, ataxia (walking staggerdly, as if one was drunk), and changes in behavior. The person may not recognize having HACE, but if you any of you experiences any of these symptoms (especially ataxia), '''immediately make sure the person is taken to lower elevations for medical treatment.'''

Another very serious condition, called '''High Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE)''' causes fluid in the lungs. If someone suffers chest tightness, congestion, gurgling breaths, blue or gray fingers or lips, cough producing frothy or pink liquid, and difficulty breathing even at rest, '''they should be taken to a lower elevation and receive medical treatment immediately.'''

Although not particularly common, keep in mind that these illnesses are possible and that anyone is susceptible to them, even if you have traveled to high elevations before. For more information about AMS and related illnesses, see  this link. [http://www.ismmed.org/np_altitude_tutorial.htm]

Another medical concern at higher elevations, particularly those in Colorado and Denver, is sunburn and skin cancer. The higher elevation means that there is less atmosphere protecting the skin from harmful solar radiation. This is especially true in Colorado, with both dry air that saps the skin of protective moisture and with the beautifully sunny days.

Colorado actually has the highest rate of skin cancer in the country, so it is always a good idea to wear a lot of high SPF sun-screen, hats, long sleeve shirts and pants. You are not protected from the sun even in the winter. The sun's rays can actually be reflected by the snow on the ground, still causing skin damage. When in Colorado, do as the locals do, and '''wear sunscreen''' on any exposed skin surface at any time of the year.

==Get out==


===Winter Sports===

For skiers and snowboarders, winter is the best time to visit Denver. Many people fly into Denver International Airport each season on their way up to the ski capitals of Summit and Eagle counties, including [[Vail]], [[Beaver Creek]], [[Copper Mountain]], [[Keystone (Colorado)|Keystone]], [[Loveland Basin]], [[Arapahoe Basin]], and [[Breckenridge (Colorado)|Breckenridge]], [[Winter Park (Colorado)|Winter Park]]; a little further away are [[Steamboat]], and [[Aspen]]. You can find information on resort shuttles at the desks in DIA's main terminal. 

There are many ski resorts about 1 1/2-2 hours west of Denver along I-70, but weekend traffic to them can be very slow, especially in inclement weather. Steer clear of the crowds by skiing during the week or planning your trip outside the busy season (Thanksgiving to New Year's). There are also plenty of mountain trails for snowshoers and cross-country skiers, which are generally free. You can also take the RTD [http://www.rtd-denver.com/] Ski-n-Ride service from Boulder to Eldora Ski Resort west of [[Boulder]], which is the only resort with scheduled bus service.

===Transportation and Shuttle to Ski Resorts===

[https://silvermountainexpress.com/ Silver Mountain Express] offers private transfers from Denver to any Colorado ski resort, including [[Vail]], [[Beaver Creek]], [[Copper Mountain]], [[Keystone (Colorado)|Keystone]], [[Loveland Basin]], [[Arapahoe Basin]], and [[Breckenridge (Colorado)|Breckenridge]], [[Winter Park (Colorado)|Winter Park]]; a little further away are [[Steamboat]], and [[Aspen]].

===Year-Round Destinations===

* '''Red Rocks Amphitheatre''', [http://www.redrocksonline.com]. In [[Morrison]], Colorado on the western edge of Denver, this is a gorgeous outdoor concert venue set in a red sandstone paradise. There's a great view of Denver below. From Igor Stravinsky's North American debut of his 'Rite of Spring' at the park's opening in the '40s to the Jethro Tull, Grateful Dead and Phish riots of the '70s, '80s and '90s, Red Rocks's history is quirky and storied. It was also a stop on The Beatle's famous British Invasion tour of America. But if you pay and visit Red Rocks only during a concert, you're seriously cheating yourself. Check out the Rock and Roll Museum at the top of Red Rocks, eat in the restaurant, hike the red sandstone and scrub oak trails for their scenic beauty and wildlife. It is illegal, however, to climb on the rocks themselves. If you can't bear to leave after the show, book a room or stay in a campground next to the amphitheater.
* Travelers in Colorado often use Denver as a home base for forays into the neighboring mountains, to places like [[Rocky Mountain National Park]].
* [[Boulder]] is a laid-back university town about 25 minutes northwest of Denver. Snow-capped mountains can be seen for miles from the town.
* '''Winery tours''' - Visit a [[Front Range]] or mountain winery, or even the vineyards themselves in [[Colorado's Wine Country]]. Various Wine Trails have been organized by the Colorado Wine Industry Development Board [http://www.coloradowine.com/maps.html], a promotional entity funded by the state. The  Wine Trails can be driven or biked.
