{{pagebanner|Minsk Banner.jpg}}

[http://minsk.gov.by/en/ Minsk], with a population of 1,959,800 (according to the 2016 survey), is the capital and largest city of [[Belarus]]. 

==Understand==
Minsk is situated on the Svislač and Niamiha rivers. 

After the Pale of Settlement of 1835, the population of Minsk became 1/3 Jews, almost all of whom fled or were killed during World War II. During the war, the population of Minsk was reduced from 300,000 people to 50,000 people. The city was 80% destroyed and was rebuilt in the 1950s to the liking of Stalin. The population of the city grew due to industrialization and movement of young people from the Belarusian countryside.

The city now features a combination of rebuilt historical buildings, as well as modern apartments and shopping centers, and soviet-style buildings and monuments. It features sightseeing opportunities, as well as dining and shopping similar to its neighboring countries in the European Union, while still showing signs of Russian influence.

English is rarely spoken but Russian is spoken by all, in addition to Belarusian. It helps to learn some key phrases in Russian. 

==Get in==

===By plane===
Passengers from 74 countries do not need a visa if flying to Minsk National Airport under certain conditions. For more information, see [[Belarus#Get_In]].

All flights arrive at the [http://airport.by/en '''National Airport Minsk''']  ({{IATA|MSQ}}, 37km north-east from the city. Just before the passport control, you will find a cash machine; more are available inside the arrivals.  Straight after that, you can collect your luggage and follow to the customs control. Even if you choose the green corridor, you may be stopped for questioning. It is a routine practice and shouldn't make anyone anxious: only large sums of cash, luxury products, alcohol and cigarettes will attract the custom officers' attention. The "Arrivals hall" has few small kiosks with Belarusian souvenirs, alcohol, and newspapers; also ATMs, currency exchange, car rentals and train/bus ticket machines (more are at the bus stop outside the airport building). The ''Departure hall'' on the third floor has a 24/7 restaurant, several cafes, souvenir shops, bank and post offices. '''Free wi-fi''' is available at the Prime Time cafe (password: primecafe, January 2016). Upon check-in, you will be advised on the sector number for the custom and passport control - allow 15 to 20 minutes to pass them. Several duty-free shops and bars are available just before the boarding gates.

[http://en.belavia.by/home/ Belavia] operates regular flights to many capitals across Europe, as well as Israel and Central Asia; to major cities in Russia and Ukraine. Other airlines, such as Aeroflot, Lufthansa, Austrian, LOT, Ukrainian International Airlines, Air Baltic, Air China and Etihad provide good connections to Minsk from across their networks. Although low-cost airlines do not serve Minsk, most of the available carriers offer cheap tickets every now and then.

Note that most of this information is now outdated due to new EU sanctions on Belarus due to the recent Ryanair grounding. Flights to Belarus are no longer operating from any EU country. To get to Minsk one must either (a) fly to somewhere like Turkey, Dubai, or the Caucuses and catch a connecting flight or (b) fly to Russia and then catch a connecting flight, which is cheaper if visiting both Russia and Belarus together as you will have a visa to Russia in that case. Note that this option requires getting a Belarusian visa.

====Getting to the city====
* '''Bus 300э''' runs every 30-50 minutes (less frequently late in the night) from/to Centralny bus terminal, next to the main railway station (Minsk Pasažyrski). The bus stop is clearly visible from the main airport exit - slightly on its left. For the timetable, see the airport website, [http://airport.by/transport/regular-route-bus], Minsktrans website [http://www.minsktrans.by/city/#minsk/bus] or check at the airport bus stop. At the Centralny bus terminal, tickets are sold at the ticket office. At the airport, they can be bought from the bus driver for cash or from a ticket machine inside the bus stop shelter and by the main exit from the airport building - paid by debit/credit cards. Price is BYN4.00 + luggage BYN0.40. In about 30 minutes after leaving the airport by 300э, the bus stops at ''Uručča'' (Уручча | Уручье) metro station. Ticket to this stop costs about 2/3 of the Central bus terminal ticket. Many passengers leave here to continue by metro and other means of public transport. If travelling to the airport from ''Uručča'', leave the metro station through the front exit, turn right, and find the outermost bus stop. There is a small, well-hidden plate with a timetable. Bus 300, take about 50 mins to a hours from airport to Minsk Central Bus station (final stop) if there is no traffic. If you travel to the ''Aŭtazavod'' area (Аўтазавод / Автозавод) - Mahilioŭskaja metro station - you may prefer taking bus 173э to Sokal (Сокал / Сокол) suburb and changing for 112с at the same bus stop. Bus 173э, however, has a very infrequent service - see timetable [http://www.minsktrans.by/city/#minsk/bus]. 

* '''Yandex taxi''', which can also be accessed via the Uber mobile app, operates in Minsk. If you have a cell phone, this is probably the easiest and cheapest option – a ride into town can be as cheap as €10. A Yandex trip from the city centre to the airport costs around BYN 33 (December 2019). If you want to pay with card in Yandex app, you might not be able to add your card until you are in an area which supports card payments. If this happens, wait until you arrive in Belarus, then turn on the phone GPS, make sure you have a data connection, restart the Yandex app and the option to add card should appear.

* '''[http://airport.by/en/tourism/transfer National Airport Minsk]''', the official airport transfer service, has a good reputation with short number 7373. But the official airport transfer service has several important shortcomings: Chinese cars, non-English speaking drivers, low quality of service in general. If you looking for higher level of service you can use private transfer services like [https://www.minskairporttransfer.com Minsk Airport Transfer] or [http://minsktransfertours.com/ Minsk Airport Transfer & Tours]. It should cost about €25-30 and transfers can be ordered in advance using online booking form.

* '''Taxis''' are available at the airport although drivers generally will not speak English – have the name of your destination written in Belorussian or Russian and be prepared to pay in cash.

===By train===
The width of the train tracks is different in Poland and in Belarus, so if you choose to arrive by train please be prepared for long wheel changing. However, if you are arriving from say, Kyiv, Moscow, or Lviv you need not worry about this.  Plus as an added bonus, the prices are substantially cheaper from CIS countries.

Minsk can be easily reached from other major cities including [[Kyiv]], [[Warsaw]], [[Vilnius]], and [[Moscow]].

Be aware that trains crossing the border between Russia and Belarus do not pass through passport control and are basically considered domestic trains by the authorities. Because of this, it is illegal for those without Belarusian or Russian citizenship to take these trains.

====From Kyiv====
There is a daily train leaving Tsentralnyi Vokzal (Central Station). It departs city around 9 pm and get you to Minsk next morning at around 8 am.  As of November 2016 ticket fares are 1100, 1850 and 3500 UAH for different sleeping car types.

====From Warsaw====
There are two options - Direct and Cheap
The direct trip takes about 10 hours. There are two trains a day -
 
First departs from Central Station at 21 which arrives in Minsk around 08:00, costing about €70
Second one departs from "Gdański" train station about 16:00 and arrives in Minsk about 02:00, direction Moscow. Cost about €150
(To "Dworzec Gdański" - Gdanski Train station you should use Metro Blue Line (First Line) from Central Station, 3 stops - Direction "Młociny")

But there is much cheaper way. €15-25 but you must use 3 trains/buses:

First of all - you must get to the Belarusian Border. The border split cities, Polish city called Terespol and Belarusian city called Brest. You can buy a direct train ticket to Terespol from Central Station (Warszawa Centralna) or take a bus to Terespol from Main bus Station situated at Eastern Train Station (Warszawa Zachodnia). Cost is about PLN50/€11. In Terespol, you cannot walk across the border, you can take a train to Brest (PLN13, 3 per day), and cross the border by hitchhiking a car. The passport check is very long, so be in Terespol at least 40 minutes before the train departs. Then you must take a train from Brest to Minsk (€5). There are 5-8 trains a day. At ticket office ask for "Kupeyny" and go to the platform with the trains going in direction of Moscow. 

====From Vilnius====
From Vilnius, Lithuania, the train takes about 2.5 hours and runs three times per day (early morning, late afternoon, evening) plus there is one or two per day more expensive Kaliningrad–Moscow train at night; see timetable at [http://www.rw.by/en/ Belorusian railway website]. The train from Vilnius costs around €15-20 one way if bought in Lithuania or you can buy them in advance for nearly the same price at Belorusian railway online-booking website.

You have to walk to last platform and walk through Schengen passport and customs control and than board a train with selected doors (the conductor checks your tickets). Trains are quite modern with US English voice announcing the stations and border control procedures.

If you are non-belorusian citizen you will receive from a conductor a migration card with two sides to fill out; if the conductor won't give you one, ask for ''bumazka''. Later, the Belorusian customs service will enter the train, asks you if you have alcohols and cigarettes above the limit and fast-check your baggage. Later the border control with big computer on the neck will come and ask you for your passport and filled ''bumazka'' (migration card). Sometime they can ask for insurance, letter of invitation or whatever else (as everywhere in East Europe: the more supporting documents prepared – better for you :). The inspector will check everything, stamp your passport and migration card (DO NOT LOSE IT!, you will need it in hotels and while leaving Belarus) and we wish you good luck in Belarus.

====From Moscow====
Moscow is connected with Minsk via several Belarusian Railway and Russain Railways trains daily, both daytime and overnight. Travel time varies from 8 to 10 hours (see the timetable on [http://www.rw.by/en/ BCh] or [http://pass.rzd.ru/main-pass/public/en RZD] official website). Trains crossing the border between Russia and Belarus do not stop there for passport check, therefore an overnight train travel from Moscow to Minsk offers a good sleep in a 4-berth or 2-berth compartment.

===By coach===
There are several bus routes from Vilnius central bus station to Minsk central bus station. The coach service takes 4-5 hours (0.5-1.5 of which is spent at the border, depending on the traffic).

===By car===
Driving in, while possible, requires knowledge of the boundaries system. This is a border of the European Union, so control is very strict. Crossing it can take 2 hours. They may check your bags. Without knowledge of Russian, Belarusian or Polish, this can be very hard. There is a very long queue of cars at every border crossing. However, if you have passport, VISA and car registration papers prepared, act honest and helpful and arrive as a tourist in a personal car, the border crossing can go very smoothly and be over within 45 minutes. Sometimes it takes 3 hours. If you will ride from Polish Side, from Warsaw, you can see the Truck queue, just pass it, and go direct to Polish City TERESPOL / BREST (Belarussian).
Be Carefull! When you are in Poland and you are 30km near border, The Customs, or Border control have this same rights as Police! (Green Cars - "Straż Graniczna")  So drive slowly, and carefully

==Get around==
[[Image:Minsk-Metro-Uruch'e-04.jpg|thumb|Minsk metro]]

=== Languages ===

Use of two state languages, Belarusian and Russian, across the transport system in Minsk may pose inconvenience for visitors. Effectively, the same stop, station, street or square may be known and referred to by two names, in Belarusian and Russian. For example, one of the metro interchange stations is known to the Russian-speaking majority as ''Площадь Октябрьская'' (Oktiabrskaya Sq.), but maps and announcements in metro refer to it in Belarusian as ''Плошча Кастрычніцкая'' (Kastryčnickaja Sq.). As of 2013, transliteration of geographical names (streets, stations etc.) into Latin alphabet is done from Belarusian according to the new system  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_on_transliteration_of_Belarusian_geographical_names_with_letters_of_Latin_script]. Learn it as it is used across Minsk metro and on many other signs already. Elsewhere, you will see plenty of examples of the geographical names transliterated from Russian, e.g. Loshytsa, rather than Belarusian Lošyca.

===Transport===
Get around by using bus, tram, Metro (subway) or rent a car. All are cheap and reliable. The subway is noted for being clean and safe. All public transport in Minsk operates c. 05.30-00.30; taxis are 24/7 naturally.

A panoramic English-language map of the centre of Minsk that shows every building individually is widely available from bookshops and kiosks. It also has a conventional map showing more of Minsk and some tourist information. It is worth buying a copy as early on in your visit as you can because it makes getting around on foot easy and fun.

====Bus, trolleybus, tram====
There is large network of buses, trolleybuses and trams in Minsk. Thanks to this system of more lines, there is a direct connection between many places, but the intervals are longer. The ticket for a single trip costs 0.55 BYN (0,30 USD) while bought in advance or 0.65 BYN (0,32 USD) from a driver (both as of October 2017). Don't forget to validate your tickets after entering the bus, even when you bought them from a driver!  [http://www.minsktrans.by/city/#minsk/bus Timetables are available] at public transport operator websites (in Russian), or there is [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=minskguide.org Android app in English] with connection search, maps and timetables (everything offline as well).

====Metro====
The Minsk Metro, is the most reliable transport system around Minsk. Additionally, each metro station is decorated uniquely and the oldest stations of the red, Maskoŭskaja line, are listed architectural landmarks. For instance, the station at Kastryčnickaja Plošča (Kastryčnickaja Square) is decorated in the theme of the Communist Revolution. The station at ''Plošča Pieramohi'' (Pieramohi Square) is decorated in a victory theme, and the Plošča Lienina (Lienin Square) station includes a bust of Lenin and a host of hammer and sickle reliefs. Plošča Jakuba Kolasa (Jakub Kolas Sq) renderes Belarusian folk themes in ceramics beautifully all over its station.

The Metro consists of two lines crossing at the very city centre, the red line runs (known as Maskoŭskaja) from the northeast to the southwest, while the blue line (Aŭtazavodskaja) runs from the the west to the southeast.  All the stations have numbers (for example the interchange stations, Kastryčnickaja i Kupalaŭskaja, are 116 and 216) - in addition to their proper names - for easier reference, they are listed on all new metro maps; however, it is a very recent innovation and the majority of locals are not aware of that yet.  Use stations' proper names if speaking to locals.  Train depart every 3 min at rush hour and are almost never late.  You can buy tokens at a window inside the station.  One ride costs BYN0.65 [http://www.minsktrans.by/ru/tariff.html], but if you speak no Belarusian or Russian, just give some money and say: Metro. For those staying for a week or longer, a 10-day or a 14-day pass may be a good option. Payment can also be done directly at the gate with contactless Mastercard/Visa cards (including foreign-issued cards).

====Car rental====
You may also rent a car to travel around the country. Rates depend on period of hire and start from USD20 a day. There are offices of Europcar, Avis, SIXT and other rental companies.

Regional trains from Central Station are also cheap. A trip from Minsk to Gomel (5h) with a cabin for 4 cost BLR20,000 and almost never full.

It is somehow appropriate that in a country like Belarus, the KGB should be located in a landmark building in the centre of the capital.</see>

* If you have ten minutes to spare at the Minsk Airport, in front of the main building you will find five or six old '''USSR-era planes''' on display. Free.

* You might be willing to hire a private guide when staying in Minsk or another major Belarusian city. Please note that private guides are licensed by the National Tourism Agency - and you can check the list of their names on the official website of the Agency List of private guides in Russian [http://belarustourism.by/agency/educational/review-list/]. A licensed guide in Belarus must always wear a special badge Badge of a licensed guide in Belarus.

==Do==
* '''Minskaje Mora''' (Minsk Sea) is an artificial reservoir 5km north of the city centre. There's a free public beach, and pedal-boat and catamaran rental. Buses leave the central bus station regularly. Suburban trains go there - they leave from a special platform to the right of the central train station; no need to enter the main building, just head to the right to arrive at three little platforms (22-24) with their own ticket booths. To get there by car, head north along the P28 and lookout for signs after Ratamka village.

==Buy==
Woven and embroided linen goods are the most typical presents Belarusians take abroad. They can be purchased in specialist shops and any large department store. Souvenirs made of straw, wood and leather are traditional to Belarus too (not Russian ''Matryoshka'', though), as well as hand-made pottery. Womens housery ''Milavitsa'' is widely known across former USSR. Belarusian vodka isn't as well marketed as Russian or Polish, but can easily compete with those on quality and is traditional to Belarus too; look for well-designed bottles and packaging and the price can generally be a reliable guide to its quality. Another authentic Belarusian alcoholic drink is ''krambambulia'' - a slightly sweet herbal infusion - hard to find. The Minsk Airport has reliable duty free shops with reasonably priced Belarusian alcohol, chocolate and souvenirs. Shop assistants, however, advise the passangers with transfers in the EU airports not to take the purchased liquids into hand luggage as they may be confiscated by the airport security (April 2014).  

* '''Ragna''' [http://vk.com/ragna_by], 4 Suchaja St. (Frunzienskaja subway station), has a very interesting selection of Belarusian traditional crafts, mostly handmade, unlikely to be found in mainstread shops.

==Eat==
{{infobox|Advice for Vegetarians & Vegans|Meat is always on the menu. It isn't considered a meal if meat isn't a part of it but, because of a love of the potato you should be able to get vegetarian side dishes. Sometimes ''borsch'' is made with only potato and beetroot, but be aware that borsch is sometimes cooked with meat. Some ''golubsty'' are only stuffed with rice. If you're a vegan you will have a very hard time trying to adequately feed yourself; buying fresh produce at the numerous markets might be your best bet. Often it can be a lot easier to try and find perhaps an Indian restaurant. Pizza restaurants usually have a meat-free pizza on the menu.}}

Belarusian cuisine is similar to that of the rest of Eastern Europe, particularly Russian and Ukrainian. Expect heavy potato dishes, mushrooms, soups and baked meat. There's plenty of Western food available in the capital, especially Italian, French and American. The quality varies, but has improved dramatically in recent years. Note that many local restaurants will have entertainment during nights and weekends.

There are also several locations of McDonald's, KFC, and other Western fast food chains.

* '''Pechki-Lavochki''', Main Ave. Is a great Belarusian restaurant.

* '''Vasilki''', Praspiekt Niezaliežnasci (Independence Avenue), 16, A restaurant serving traditional local cuisine. Pleasant interior in a rustic style. Breakfasts from 8am. There are also restaurants at J. Kolasa str., 37, and Praspiekt Niezaliežnasci, 89

* '''Beze''', Main ave.  Viennese style café with a great bakery and light snacks.

* '''Gourman''', close to Grand Opera Theater. Styled as an Italian trattoria. It serves Belarusian and European cuisine. 

* '''Taj''', vulica Brylieŭskaja, 2.  Wonderful North Indian restaurant. Vegetarians will find heaven. There should be an English menu available also. Vegetarian dishes start from around BR6,000 and mains from BR12,000. Open Noon-Midnight.

* '''Tiflis''', vulica Talbuchina 3.  Quite solid Azerbaijani/Georgian food – get the classics here, including khachpuri, walnut salads and hearty soups, along with a variety of meat dishes. Around 20 BYN. 

* '''National Food''', Trinity Suburb. Not the restaurant's real name but this place has "National Food" on the front in big English letters so should be easy to find. It has a large menu of traditional food available in English, including a couple of vegetarian options. Mains BR20,000 to BR30,000. The food really sticks to your ribs. They also sell honey-flavoured kvass.

* '''News Cafe''', Vulitsa Karla Marksa 34.  Across from the UK embassy and a must try in Minsk. Order the El-Capone – wonderful veal.

==Drink==
A typical drink is "Kefir", which is a sort of sour milk, similar to yogurt.

"Krambambulia" is a traditional medieval alcohol drink which you can buy in most stores or order in a restaurant. It's a pretty strong drink but its taste is much softer than vodka.
*<drink name="London" alt="" address="Pr. Niezaliežnasci" directions="close to KGB headquarters, on the other side of the street" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="">This friendly little café, in the shadow of the KGB headquarters, offers a wide range of teas, free wi-fi, seating outdoors (with heaters) and a small cozy room upstairs where it's possible to sit and talk in a relatively private setting.</drink>

Making a reservation is recommended, especially on weekends.</drink>

==Sleep==
If you need a visa to enter Belarus, you must get registered with the local police department - Department for Citizenship and Migration within 5 business days. Most hotels process the registration automatically upon check-in while many apartment rentals might be reluctant to provide registration. Check if the rental service offers registration service and at what price.

There are plenty of apartment and room rentals available online.

You might receive a call to your hotel room late at night offering a "massage". To avoid being woken up it is worth unplugging your phone.

===Budget===
Many hostels are just apartment flats with bunk beds in all the rooms. Finding them and checking in many require a phone call and coordination and most apartments only have 1 or 2 bathrooms to be shared by all of the guests.

==Stay Safe==

Minsk is a very safe and clean city. Unlike most Eastern European cities, there are very few homeless and drunk people in the streets. Although locals might insist otherwise, Minsk is a city where you really must go out of your way to find trouble, even at night. If you are in need of assistance, there is a strong police presence in the city centre. However, their ability to speak English in most cases will be severely limited.   

Be careful when photographing government buildings and the monument to Lenin at Independence Square. While you might be observed and kindly ushered away from the monument, photographing government buildings can lead to trouble with authorities and even arrest. Be mindful of what you are photographing.

While not seen as frequently as in Kyiv, be aware of cars or delivery trucks moving on sidewalks. In some areas of Minsk parking is limited forcing drivers to manoeuvre and park their vehicles onto pedestrian lanes.
