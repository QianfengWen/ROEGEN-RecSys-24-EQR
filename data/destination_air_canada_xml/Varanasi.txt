{{pagebanner|Varanasi Banner.jpg}}

'''Varanasi''' [l], once known as '''Benares''' or '''Banaras''' and '''Kashi''', is a historical city in northern [[India]]. It is considered one among the 7 oldest cities in India  and is renowned all over the world for ancient temples mostly dedicated to Lord Shiva. It is also famed for the old ghats and the worship be of the river Ganges.

==Understand==
[[Image:Varanasikedarghat.JPG|thumb|Pilgrims bathing at Kedar Ghat at sunrise]]
The city is sacred to Hindus and Jains and also one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, with settlements dating back to the 11th century BC. Many Hindus believe that dying in Varanasi brings salvation/nirvana and so they make the trip to the city when they realize that they are close to death. For some, the culture shock of the burning corpses in plain view can be a bit overwhelming. However, the scene of pilgrims doing their devotions in the River Ganga at sunrise set against the backdrop of the centuries-old temples is probably one of the most impressive sights in the world.

The city can be scorchingly hot in the summer months so, if possible, time your visit to fall between October and March, and bring something warm to wear for chilly days and nights.

==Get in==

Varanasi is well connected by plane, train, and bus. 

===By plane===
'''Lal Bahadur Shastri Airport''', [https://www.aai.aero/en/airports/varanasi] ({{IATA|VNS}}) is located 25km northwest of the city center. A minibus will take you to the train station or city center. Ask security for the minibus station or simply walk out of the airport building and turn left. you will see the minibus(es).  A taxi to/from the airport takes an hour and costs ₹750, while a tuk-tuk/auto-rickshaw can take twice as long and costs ₹500. Allow extra time due to traffic. Air India [http://www.airindia.com/], Go First, SpiceJet [http://www.spicejet.com/], and IndiGo [http://www.goindigo.in/], Vistara, BHuddha Air all operate regular flights to [[Delhi]], [[Mumbai]], [[Kolkata]], [[Bengaluru]], [[Hyderabad]], [[Khajuraho]], and [[Visakhapatnam]].

It is easy to get a state-run bus to the city center (opposite Varanasi Junction/Cantt station), which costs less than half a dollar. The bus stand is 10 minutes walking distance from the airport.
If taking a state-run (or private operator) bus from Varanasi to the airport, take a bus going to Jaunpur and get down at the Babatpur airport stop. After walking for 10 min, you can easily get to the airport.

===By train===
There are multiple daily services to cities including [[Delhi]] (13 hours), [[Agra]] (13 hours), [[Lucknow]] (7 hours), [[Mumbai]], and [[Kolkata]]. 

Varanasi is served by three major railway stations: 
* '''Varanasi Junction (IR station code : BSB)''' - the trip between the train station and the Ganges-area costs ₹100 in a tuk-tuk. There is an international tourist bureau on the left side of the main waiting room which is also a tourists lounge with A/C, sofas and toilets.
* '''Manduadih Railway Station'''  - the trip between the train station and the Ganges-area costs ₹100 in a tuk-tuk.
* '''Pandit Deen Dayal Junction (IR station code : DDU)''',  previously known as Mughalsarai Junction (MSG) 20km east of the city  - the trip between the train station and the Ganges-area costs ₹500 in a taxi.

===By bus===
The bus station in Varanasi is located just east of the Varanasi Junction train station. A tuk-tuk from the bus station to the Ganges area costs ₹100.

====Arriving from Nepal====
Buses are available from major cities in [[Nepal]] to the border city of [[Sunauli]]. From the Sunauli bus station, take a rickshaw (200 NPR) to the border crossing, get your passport stamped on the Nepali side then walk through the border. After 100m of walking through no-man's land, you will find the Indian immigration office hidden away on the left hand side of the road. After going through Indian immigration, walk 300m and find the bus stop on the right hand side. From there, take the government bus to [[Gorakhpur]], not the private lines which are far less comfortable and stop everywhere. The bus trip between the border and Gorakhpur takes 4 hours and costs ₹60. To reach Varanasi from Gorakhpur, you can either take a train from the Gorakhpur Junction train station (5-7 trains per day, 5.5-7 hour journey, ₹200-800 cost) or a bus (hourly, 8+ hour journey, ₹130 cost).

Alternatively, there is a single bus that can be taken from Kathmandu through to Varanasi. As of Dec 2016 the bus costs 2100 NPR although if you reserve a ticket through a travel agency in Thamel it may be slightly more. The bus leaves from the Swayambhu bus park at 7pm every two days, a schedule should be available on the UPSRTC website. There is an office at the Swayambhu bus park where you may be able to directly reserve your tickets ahead of time. The bus is reasonably comfortable although it has no toilet and stops every few hours or so. The trip itself can take anywhere from 15 to 23 hours.

====Arriving from other cities in India====
There are buses run by state government from [[Lucknow]] (8 hours, ₹160), [[Gorakhpur]] (8+ hours, ₹130), [[Khajuraho]] (12 hours, ₹250), [[Kanpur]] (9 hours - ₹195), [[Faizabad]] (7 hours, ₹105), [[Bodhgaya]] (7 hours, ₹250) and [[Prayagraj]] (3 hours - ₹107 for AC, ₹60 w/o AC).

==Get around==
Note that many streets are too narrow to be reached by cycle-rickshaw, auto-rickshaw, and car and therefore, you may have to walk a bit to reach your destination.


===By foot===
[[Image:Varanasi_alleys.jpg|thumb|Typical alley in Varanasi]]
'''By foot''' is the only way to see the waterfront and the ghats - but be ready to be hot, sweaty, and lost - locals are usually happy to point you in the right direction. The names of ghats and signs pointing to restaurants and hotels are often painted on the walls in Roman letters. For better orientation, walk into any book store and pick up a small guide/map book that will have the list of all the ghats and their historical background.

'''Walking Tours''' are operated by many companies, with the cheapest being the [http://www.stopshostels.com/#!facilities/cni1 daily tours operated by Stops Hostel] (₹100 plus transportation, 3 hours). Walking tours are a great way to see some of the harder-to-find sights such as the Flower Market and Ayurvedic Herb Market.

===By cycle-rickshaw and auto-rickshaw===
The chaotic streets of Varanasi are sometimes too much to handle by foot. Therefore, it will often be convenient to travel by cycle rickshaw or auto-rickshaw. A short journey of a few kilometers should cost under ₹50, while a longer journey within the city, such as between the ghats and the train station, will cost ₹100. Further journeys, such as to [[Sarnath]] (10km), cost ₹200 each way by auto-rickshaw.
If you take a "Shared rickshaw" you can get everywhere for ₹20, be patient and insist on wanting a shared one. 

There is a pre-paid auto-rickshaw stand at the Varanasi Junction (Cantt) train station.

===By Maharaja Rickshaw===
The city also has Maharaja Rickshaw(or Mr Rickshaw Wala) run by a new company which offers tailored luxury experience at very low price(starting INR250 per person). This creates all together a different experience of seeing city and also the drivers are very friendly.

===By car or taxi===
While taxis and cars-for-hire do exist, traffic makes them impractical.

===By bicycle===
Bicycle rental is available from many vendors. Inquire at your hotel.

==See==
Varanasi is not a city with distinct tourist destinations. The experience is in watching the spectacle of life and death on the river and meandering through the alleys of the old city.

===Ghats and the River Ganges===
{{infobox|Floating away|While the use of ghats for cremation is well known, they are also used to give last rites to those who do ''not'' need cleansing by fire to purify their soul, including young children and pregnant women.  Instead, their bodies are wrapped in cloth, weighted with stones and eased into the Ganga.  However, it is fairly common for the ropes to give way, resulting in '''putrefying corpses''' washing up on the east shore across from the city.  Steer clear if squeamish.}}
[[Image:Varanasi_ghats.jpg|thumb|Dasaswamedh Ghat (main ghat)]]

The River Ganga is a sacred river for the Hindus and you will see traditional rituals and bathing occurring at all times of the day. On the Eastern banks, the River Ganga is flanked by a 300m wide sand belt, beyond which lies a green belt, a protected area reserved for turtle breeding. The western crescent-shaped bank of the River Ganga is flanked by a continuous stretch of 84 '''ghats''', or series of steps leading down to the river, stretching for 6.8km. These ghats were built by Hindu kings who wanted to die along the Ganges, and they built lofty palaces along the river, most of which are now hotels, to spend their final days. You can walk along the river and see all of the ghats, but the best option for viewing the ghats is to charter a boat and see them from the river.

Hindus consider it auspicious to die in Varanasi, so some ghats are known as '''burning ghats''', where over 200+ corpses per day are cremated in full view before their ashes are eased into the Ganga.

Some of the most popular ghats, from north to south:
* '''Panchganga Ghat''' - the meeting of the five rivers
* '''Manikarnika Ghat''' - the main cremation ghat; a must-see, but remain quiet and never take photographs (note: scams are plentiful here; see the "Staying Safe" section)
* '''Dasaswamedh Ghat''' - known as the 'main' ghat, this is the site of the large evening ''aarti'' ceremony
* '''Rana Ghat'''
* '''Kedar Ghat''' - brightly painted in stripes and busy with bathers, very photogenic
* '''Narad Ghat''' - the ghat on which bathing with spouse is not advised because the legend of contention
* '''Harishchandra Ghat''' - the cremation place where Raja Harishchandra did the last rituals of his son.
* '''Hanuman Ghat'''
* '''Shivala Ghat'''
* '''Tulsi Ghat''' - site of the large water purification plant
* '''Assi Ghat''' - a popular place to stay, with many hotels, restaurants, and internet cafes

[[Image:Varanasisunrise.JPG|thumb|Sunrise boat rides on the Ganges]]

*'''Watch pilgrims bathing in the Ganges''' - Over 60,000 people come to the ghats every day to take a dip in the sacred waters of the Ganga, most notably at sunrise. This is a fantastic sight to see. However, due to the sewage pipes that discharge feces into the river, along with sunken corpses, there is a risk of infection from numerous diseases such as hepatitis and bacteria such as e-coli. Reports have shown that the Ganges water has a fecal coliform MPN of 88,000 per 100ml, compared to a desirable fecal coliform MPN of 500 per 100ml.

* '''Boat rides''' - Very popular, especially at sunrise and sunset. Boats can either be rowboats or motorboats. The most popular sunset ride is to start at Dasaswamedh Ghat or one of the many ghats along the river and head up to Manikarnika Ghat to see the cremations, then down to Dasaswamedh just after sunset to watch the evening ''aarti'' ceremony from the boat. Sunrise is another magical time for a ride, when the ghats are filled with Hindus bathing and starting their day - one of the most famous sights in India. You can bargain the price of the boat ride to around ₹50/person per hour. During the boat ride, other boats, usually manned by children, will float up to your boat to sell bowls with flowers and a candle to be offered to the river (₹10) or masala chai (₹10), or various trinkets that are overpriced. It is recommended to avoid polluting the river further by 'offering' non-biodegradable objects to the river. At Nishadraj Ghat, a few minutes walk from Assi Ghat, you can find a boat driver named Bhomi, a local singer renowned for his incredible voice and charming, beautiful songs; during the boat ride he sings anything from local folk songs to modern film songs and old devotional ones, and often improvises lyrics over his own songs to communicate with you and the various people gathered on the ghats. 

* '''Explore the alleyways ''' - The sounds, sight and smells are just unbelievable! Walk along the ghats and up to the sights.

===Festivals===

* '''Chhath Pooja''' (October/November) - The four day festival for the sun god, Dala aka Surya. Rituals include holy bathing, fasting and abstaining from drinking water (Vratta), standing in water for long periods of time, and offering prashad (prayer offerings) and Arghya (water/milk offering) to the setting and rising sun. 

* '''Deepavali''', or '''Diwali''' (October/November, always at new moon) - The five day festival of lights. The special decorations, ceremonies at the temples, and ''aarti'' ceremony at the ghats are spectacular.

* '''Maha Shivaratri''' (February) - A Hindu festival celebrating Lord Shiva, who lived in Varanasi according to Hindu mythology. On this day, the streets of Varanasi are filled with pilgrims and parades dedicated to Shiva occur all day. Entrance to temples will require long queue and the temples will be extremely crowded. The day of Shivaratri is also the last day of the Dhrupad Mela, a festival of "Hindustani" (a form of Indian classical music) that goes on night and day for about 72 hours.

==Eat==

''Banarasi Khana'', or local delicacies, are known for their flavors. Many dishes here are flavored with asafoetida, ginger, bay leaves, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, and/or dried fenugreek leaves.

''Benares Dum Aloo'' is different from the dum aloo cooked elsewhere in India because the potatoes are stuffed with and cooked in a gravy that includes jaggery, fennel, and chili paste.

Varanasi is also known for its street food and chaat vendors. ''Aloo chaat'' is very common.

''Varanasi Paan'' is famous all over India and the world. Paan is an assortment of flavors wrapped in a betel leaf. There are two versions: One that includes tobacco, and one that includes only sweet flavors. The exact ingredients depend on how much you offer, which can be as little as ₹10 or as much as ₹300. To eat the sweet version, shove the entire leaf in your mouth at once and chew until you swallow!

''Rabri Malai Balai'' is a popular dessert in Varanasi that includes milk, sugar, almonds, and pistachio nuts. You can find it served in hole-in-the-wall or sweet shops.

''Malaiyo'' is one of the unique sweets that you can find during winter (November to February), it's made up of milk that has been whipped in the dew of early winter morning.

There are plenty of food outlets with a very dynamic range in quality. The restaurants closer to the ghats cater more to foreign tourists, with variable success. 

===Benarasi Delicacies===
*''' Keshav Tambool Bhandaar''': (near B.H.U.,Ravidas Gate) Paan with natural ingredients. 

*'''Shiv Lassi Bhandar''': (near the main gate of Ram Nagar Fort) Lassi with layers of Malai and Rabri. Superb Stuff.  

*'''Kashi Chat Center''': (near Godowlia Crossing) Good assortment of exotic chats. Try out the Aloo Tikia Chat.

* '''Zaika''' restaurant - in Shivala, opposite Hotel Broadway.  Good Indian/Chinese dishes; try the sweet-corn-pakoras. 

====Middle-Eastern Food====

Possibly due to a high influx of tourists from Israel, a number of Middle Eastern restaurants have opened in Varanasi, all of which serve very similar food, cater to a predominantly tourist clientèle, and charge a little over Rs 100 for a thali. 

* '''Hayat Mediterranean'''': near Assi (new location= behind dumraon bag colony park), managed by authentic middle-easterners (from Jordan).  Try the labanha (dry yogurt), or the baba ghanSoush (eggplant) with pita.  The Nanas (mint-lemon drink) are the best in town. The feta is a tad high in salt, but at least they have it.  The restaurant has a tent-like lounge atmosphere that gives it a cult presence. Ask for "hello to the queen" and see smiles.

* '''Phulwari Restaurant & Sami Cafe''': near the Vishwanath Temple crossing, you sit beside a religiously near-defunct but architecturally gorgeous Mahadev temple, and sip on iced teas and nanas. Some locals still consider this a holy site and aren't too happy about the cafe being so close.

===Splurge===

* '''Varuna''' and '''Chowk''', Taj Ganges Hotel, Nadesar Palace Grounds. Tel''+91 542'' 250-300 - Two restaurants respectively offering Indian and Western cuisine.

==Drink==
* '''Alcohol''' is not common in Varanasi, but it is available at a few restaurants and hotels, such as the Radisson and Taj. There are several wine shops in the old city but they don't offer any sitting arrangement. You can buy whatever you want and bring it to your hotel room. 

* '''Bhang''' is a potent, powdered form of marijuana often mixed into "special" lassis, simply called ''bhang lassi''. The drink is especially popular on holidays as Varanasi is a major center of Shiva worship as it is offered to the lord in form of ''Prashad''. It can be quite intoxicating. 

* '''Thandai''' is cool milk based drink made with pistachios, almonds and kesar and topped off with a large dollop of ''malai'' (cream). ''Bhang'' is often added to thicken the concoction, though it can be made without. Many Tandai stores are located near the main Godowlia, and most also serve lassi.

* '''Lassi''' is a  blend of yogurt, water, spices and sometimes, fruit. The best place to try lassi in Varanasi is ''Blue Lassi Shop''. There you will find more than 50 types of this drink: with fruit or different toppings. It is a really interesting unordinary place. Quite difficult to find, so better to ask locals to show you the way. Although it's almost always crowded with tourists, it's highly recommended to visit. P.S. take your passport size pic, you can stick it on the wall among thousand other pics.

==Sleep==

The most interesting area to stay is around the ghats, which are the main attractions for foreigners and are close to the religious attractions. However, this area is extremely noisy and many accommodation choices here are subpar, so do some research before you book. An alternative to staying in Varanasi is to stay near the main train station (Varanasi Junction). This area has some very nice new places popping-up in the recent years and is only about 10 minutes on a tuk-tuk. Another alternative is the much quieter [[Sarnath]], 10+ km from Varanasi, but it takes 75+ minutes each way to reach Varanasi by tuk-tuk (₹200).
 
Some budget accommodations advertise free morning and evening boat rides along the river. However, the boat will take you up the river and then let the passengers know that for the return trip, there is a fee of ₹60 per person. Those who do not want to pay can get out of the boat and walk back.

Beware that Varanasi, particularly during summer, is prone to many hours of power outages a day. It is best to double check that your fan or A/C is run from a backup generator, or you may not have it for much of the day.

==Stay safe==

Violent crime is rare, but still do be careful in the lanes after dark.  

===Power outages===
Carry a light or phone; power outages are extremely common, and the alleys are hard enough to navigate in daylight, let alone in pitch dark, because of their broken paving stones and cows common.

===Rickshaw / taxi scams===
Rickshaw / taxi scams are common in Varanasi, and the driver will inevitably tell you that the hotel that you wish to go to has burned down, is flooded, or closed. Don't believe him. Drivers receive commission from hotels for bringing in new guests, and this is one way to trick newcomers to going to these places. Don't get annoyed, but see the exchange as playful banter and part of the Varanasi experience. However, if the driver continuously refuses to follow your instructions, threaten to get out of the rickshaw. If after all this you still end up at a different place, just refuse to pay until you arrive at your hotel. The same procedure will need to be followed when sight seeing, as drivers will inevitably try to take you to handicraft stores, from which they receive commission. If calling for a pickup from a more respectable hostel, be wary that other taxi drivers may listen in to your phone conversation then tell another taxi driver who will pick you up pretending to be your hostel, then take you to a commission charging hostel.

===Cremation ghat scams===
As you approach Manikarnika Ghat, you will be approached by touts posing as cremators or volunteers in a local hospice. These people will explain the cremation process and even lead you to a good viewpoint. They will then take advantage of your emotions by asking you to pay for some wood to burn the body of someone who can't afford it. They will usually insist on receiving ₹500 - if you offer less, it will be initially be declined. This is a complete scam. Either tell him you have no money or that you don't feel comfortable donating.

Photography is strictly prohibited.

==Respect==
===Cremation ghats===
There is, rather understandably, some resentment at tourists trespassing up to the cremation ghats for raucous sightseeing at the funeral ceremonies of loved ones. Behave respectfully and ''do not'' take photographs of cremations, even from the river. You can take photographs if it is from a distance; most do not mind. There are touts who will "stop minding"for a fee. Note that if it is the family that objects then you have to respect it but not if local touts object in the interest of extracting money. Offer the money and if they seem ready to accept, withdraw it and photograph! Call the police if necessary.

===Temples===
Since this city is full of temples you will have to take off your shoes/sandals at every point. Wear flip flops that are easy to take off.

==Contact==
BSNL, Reliance, Vodafone, and Airtel are the most popular ''cell phone'' services in the region. If you bring your GSM cellphone from home, you can buy a SIM card and call within India and abroad. You will need your passport and a passport photo to buy a SIM card.

'''Wi-Fi''' is available at just about every hotel or restaurant that caters to foreign tourists. '''Internet Cafes''' are common, especially in the lanes between Dasaswamedh Ghat and Assi Ghat. Usually, the shopkeepers will record your passport information before giving you access to the Wi-Fi.

Calling abroad is cheap from [http://www.iwayindia.com/ Iway] branches.

==Get out==

* [[Agra]] - the next point on the tourist "Golden Triangle". Buses and trains, including overnight trains, leave several times a day.

* [[Prayagraj]] - Another spiritual city along the Ganges, Prayagraj can be reached via a 3-hour bus ride.

* [[Delhi]] - The capital city of India can be reached now from Varanasi in just 8 hours by using the speedy Tejas express.

* [[Gaya]] - One of the most sacred places to do Pind Dan (funeral offerings for the benefit of the soul of the deceased). A 4+ hour drive from Varanasi.

* [[Jaunpur]] - The district just northwest of Varanasi, it is primarily a rural area.

* [[Khajuraho]] - South of Varanasi, it is a bit out of the way, but is famous for its many 1,000+ year-old Hindu and Jain temples.

* [[Lucknow]] - known for its good food, it is a good place to stop for a day on the way to Delhi.

* [[Nepal]] - buses travel to the Nepali border where you can transfer to [[Kathmandu]] and [[Chitwan]] buses. Most buses go via [[Gorakhpur]] and can take 8-12 hours, or there are daily flights.  There are a number of travel agents in Varanasi which will sell you tourist/AC buses to [[Kathmandu]] or [[Pokhara]].  Avoid these services (especially the operator Paul Travels) because they are not actually tourist buses. Instead, they are actually the local, public buses and once you get across the Nepal border, they will try to get more money from you.

* [[Sarnath]] - One of the most sacred places for Buddhists, known as the place where Lord Buddha gave his first speech after his enlightenment. 10+ km from Varanasi, 1 hour+ by Auto rickshaw (₹200 each way). Other option is take one share Auto rickshaw to Varanasi Jn. (₹10 to ₹25) and then another share Auto rickshaw to Saranath (₹100 for four persons) - March 2015
