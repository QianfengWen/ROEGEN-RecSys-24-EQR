'''Oslo''' is the capital and largest city of [[Norway]], and the third largest city of Scandinavia. Oslo is also the demographic, cultural, economic, and political center of Norway.

==Understand==
===History===
The history of the city can be traced back over 1,000 years. Oslo was founded in 1048, by King Harald Hardråde. The city became the capital of Norway around 1300 but lost its privileges during the Danish-Norwegian Union from 1348 to 1814. In 1624, a fire devastated old Oslo, and the city was moved some kilometers west to gain protection from the fortress at Akershus. The city was renamed '''Christiania''', after the Danish King Christian IV, a name that remained until it was officially renamed on January 1st, 1925 to Oslo. Traces have been found close to Ekeberg indicating settlement as far back as 10,000 BC.

After the devastating 1624 fire, Old Oslo (around the mouth of the Aker River) was largely abandoned and the ruins were converted to farmland. Today, a few church ruins are still visible under Ekeberg Hill (across the water from the new Opera House, located between the E18 road and the railway). Beyond these ruins, virtually nothing of medieval Oslo remains. Ironically, the new city Christiania was established outside the borders of Oslo, and 'Oslo' remained the name of the small, surviving settlement outside the new city borders. During Christiania's rapid expansion in the 19th century, as the capital of a new state, the site of the original Oslo (Old Oslo, or 'Gamlebyen') was included in the city. Due to the rapid inclusion of surrounding agricultural areas in the 19th century, a large number of remnants from the city's farming history are still clearly visible in place names and farmhouses. Remnants of historical pastures, such as St. Hanshaugen, are now used as a recreational park for Oslo's residents.

===Geography===
Oslo, with its approximately 453 square kilometers, is one of the largest capitals in the world by area. Most of this is forest, making Oslo a city in close contact with the nature surrounding it.

Oslo is situated in an amphitheater-like setting, with the city center at the bottom close to the [[Oslofjord]], and residential areas stretching uphill from there in all directions. Behind the residential areas, the forested area of Marka (Nordmarka, Østmarka, Lillomarka) extends, with flora and fauna that are quite extraordinary for a city of this size. Moose are commonplace (easily spotted in winter), and the whole of the capital is part of Norway's wolf reserve (a breeding couple is thought to have settled in Østmarka). However, polar bears are non-existent in Norway proper, even though some might think so, due to old stories about Norway.

The [[Oslofjord]] is an inlet of the Skagerrak Bay, stretching inland from the North Sea. In the reverse direction, the inlet runs towards Øresund and the Baltic Sea. Oslo has an impressive archipelago of islands, which in summer becomes the city's favored playground. 

The inner city center is bounded by Oslo Central Station (Oslo S) to the east, the Royal Palace (Slottet) to the west, and the seafront (from Akershus fortress to Aker Brygge) to the south. It is fairly compact and easily walkable. Karl Johans gate, the mostly pedestrian main street connecting Oslo S and the Palace, is the main artery of downtown Oslo. However, several of the neighborhoods close to the center hold interesting sights and entertainment offerings, so to explore these you should make use of the city's comprehensive and modern public transport system.

===Climate===
Although well into the northern latitudes, Oslo's climate is fairly temperate thanks to warm air being wafted across the Atlantic from the Gulf Stream. Summer weather in Oslo is usually mild and pleasant, with frequent hot spells and plenty of long sunny days. In winter temperatures hover just above or below freezing, with occasional cold spells. Snow is most often plentiful in the forested areas, making Oslo a great winter sports venue. Rainfall is spread across the year, the rainiest month being August.

===People===
Oslo has a population of 1,064,235 people including its extra-municipal suburbs (such as Bærum and Lørenskog). It has the highest population growth of any European capital, with exorbitant real estate prices to match. The Oslo metropolitan area has a population of around 1.5 million. The diverse population includes some of Norway's wealthiest celebrities. About a quarter of the population is of non-Norwegian origin, the majority hailing from Sweden, Poland, and Pakistan. This has made Oslo an ethnically and culturally diverse city. Accompanied by a large influx of people from all around Norway, Oslo is thus often referred to as the "melting pot" of Norway. Cultural differences have affected Oslo's society and cityscape in matters of cuisine and shopping, which have all blended into the everyday life of Oslo's population. Some areas of Oslo, especially around Grønland and Tøyen, and some suburbs east of the city center have majority-immigrant or majority-non-ethnic Norwegian populations. Oslo has been an extremely segregated city for centuries, and there are still significant differences between different parts of the city and attempts to reduce this divide have been futile. There are notable immigrant communities of Pakistani, Somali, Swedish, Sri Lankan, Iraqi, Polish, Romanian, Vietnamese, Iranian, Ex-Yugoslavian, Moroccan, Turkish, Albanian, Filipino, Thai, and Danish origin. Polish immigrants form the largest minority group in Oslo.

===Districts===
Following the latest reform of January 1, 2004, the city is divided into fifteen boroughs (by dealer) that are to a considerable extent self-governed. Each borough is responsible for local services not overseen by the City Council, such as social services, basic healthcare, and kindergartens. For convenience, the city can be divided into six larger districts.
* '''Sentrum''' (Sentrum) Central downtown area.
* '''West''' (Bygdøy) "The Museum Peninsula" and the poshest area in Norway
* '''Inner West''' (St. Hanshaugen, Frogner, Majorstua)
* '''Inner East''' (Sagene, Grünerløkka, Gamle Oslo)
* '''Outer West''' (Ullern, Holmenkollen, Vestre Aker, Nordre Aker)
* '''Outer East''' (Alna, Bjerke, Grorud, Stovner, Nordstrand, Søndre Nordstrand, Østensjø)

==Get in==
===By plane===
Oslo is served by two airports: Oslo Airport (Gardermoen) and Sandefjord Airport (Torp). Oslo Airport is the largest of the two and is the main international gateway to Norway. Rygge Airport (Moss) used to be an option but closed in November 2016.

Be aware that most Internet flight booking sites will show flights to all mentioned airports when searching for Oslo Airport. Make sure to check the actual airport from the search results before booking. If you don't want to land in an airport that is far away from Oslo, Gardermoen Airport is your best choice.

* <listing name="Oslo Airport" alt="" directions="" lat="" long="" address="Edvard Munchs veg, 2061 Gardermoen" phone="+47 64812000" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="http://www.osl.no/" hours="" price="">({{IATA|OSL}}, {{ICAO|ENGM}}) is Norway's largest, and Scandinavia's second largest airport, located in [[Gardermoen]], 47 kilometers northeast of Oslo. Direct flights are available to a multitude of Norwegian and European airports, as well as several intercontinental destinations. The largest airlines in Norway, Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) [http://www.flysas.com/] and Norwegian Air Shuttle [https://www.norwegian.com/uk/], operate most of the flights. Flights by about 30 other airlines make this airport easily accessible from most of the world. There is free Wi-Fi access at the airport.</listing>

To travel between the city and the airport: 

* '''Flytoget''' [http://www.flytoget.no], operates high-speed express trains which depart every 10 minutes and generally take about 19 minutes to reach Oslo Central Station (Oslo S). Every other train is express to Oslo S, and the next train will service stations located west in and out of Oslo city, terminating at Drammen. Tickets (to Oslo S) cost NOK 196 when bought from a ticket machine or in the Flytoget app (NOK 98/retired, kids, youth up to 20 years old, and students up to than 31 with a student ID; tickets are not valid for transfer in Oslo).

*'''Vy''' [http://www.vy.no/] (previously known as NSB) operates trains southbound via Oslo to Drammen, then on to Kongsberg or Skien. The train station is linked to the airport via free shuttle buses. You can change to any train from Oslo S (central station). Northbound trains are also offered from the airport directly to Eidsvoll, Lillehammer, and Trondheim. This is the more popular and cost-effective way to get into Oslo - trains depart from the adjacent platforms to the Flytoget Express. The trip takes 23 minutes, and trains depart three times per hour. Tickets cost NOK 118 (NOK 69 with a valid Oslo public transport ticket, valid for transfer in Oslo). Tickets are sold at ticket machines, or on board, but be sure to board the right carriage. For more details check: [[#By_train_2|Local Trains]]. If you prefer apps, you can buy tickets in the Vy app. Strongly recommend using this option; economical and convenient. The last Vy train to the city may be about 11:30 PM; the first train on weekends to the city is around 6:40 AM. If you arrive late, Oslo airport is sleep-able and safe on the land side. The main train station in Oslo has all the amenities you can think about including Starbucks with free Wi-Fi (upstairs) and there is live information assistance during daytime hours at the ground level if you need it.

* '''Flybussen''' [https://www.flybussen.no/en] operates buses to Oslo city center which take roughly 45 minutes to reach the city center and cost NOK 179. A return ticket valid for 1 month is also available for NOK 260, cheaper if bought online or in the Flybussen app. This is valid for transfer in Oslo. There is also a 50% discount for all Flybussen tickets (NOK 95 one way if bought online) for different groups, including students younger than 31. Flybussen also operates several other bus lines to other places in Oslo (and Akershus). Please refer to the website for more details.  

* '''Taxis''' can, and should, be ordered in the booth inside the terminal for different fixed prices from approximately NOK 700+ to Oslo city center. Leaving the terminal to flag one from the queue is almost always more expensive. You won't get scammed by taxi drivers as you might in many large cities, but getting the fixed airport price is crucial. Recently when arriving very late (midnight) there is only a taxi from the company “By Taxi” and prices to the city center run at 1700-1800, and scams known from other cities are back. If you can’t order a taxi in the terminal there are apps e.g. Oslo Taxi and you will save significantly if you order online rather than falling from the “By Taxi” line and scam. Most people with a destination in Oslo will be far better off getting the Flytoget, Flybussen, or local train to Oslo S, as it is both cheaper and faster. Uber Black is also available in Oslo, and possibly from the airport, but with limited availability. Rentals are another possibility if you are staying outside OSLO city proper (and nearby cities such as Lillehammer, Moss++, and the rental car companies' apps are often the most cost-effective setup.

* <listing name="Sandefjord Airport Torp" alt="" directions="" lat="" long="" address="Torpveien, Sandefjord" phone="+47 33427000" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="https://torp.no/en/welcome-to-torp-sandefjord-airport/" hours="" price="">{{ICAO|ENTO}}) is near [[Sandefjord]] and [[Tønsberg]], 118km south of Oslo. The following airlines operate at Torp: KLM  ([[Amsterdam]]), Norwegian Air Shuttle ([[Alicante]]), Ryanair ([[Alghero]], [[Alicante]], [[Barcelona]]-Girona, [[Bremen]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Frankfurt]]-Hahn, [[Liverpool]], [[London]]-Stansted, [[Milan]]-Bergamo, [[Marseille]]), Widerøe ([[Bergen]], [[Bodø]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Stavanger]], [[Tromsø]] , [[Trondheim]]), Wizz Air ([[Gdańsk]], [[Katowice]], [[Poznań]], [[Riga]], [[Warsaw]], [[Wroclaw]], [[Kyiv]]-Zhuliany, [[Bucharest]], [[Belgrade]], [[Sofia]]).</listing>

To travel between the city and the airport by bus or taxi:
* '''PKS OSLO''' [https://pksoslo.com] door-to-door transfer can pick you up from any address in Oslo for NOK 230 per person. (As of 2023, This is the cheapest option, but it's pretty slow - the exact time depends on the pickup/drop locations of everyone else on the bus).
* '''Taxis''' are very expensive; a taxi to Oslo costs around NOK 800.
* '''Torpekspressen''' [https://www.torpekspressen.no/en/] operates between the airport and Drammen and Oslo (1 hour 45 mins) and costs NOK 240 for a single ticket, NOK 420 for a return (discounts for students (NOK 340), ISIC Card Holders and senior citizens). Torpekspressen buses are scheduled to accommodate arriving flights, so after you get off the plane, most likely there will be a bus to Oslo waiting for you. If you miss the bus scheduled for your flight, you may end up waiting a long time for the next bus.

===By train===
[[File:Oslo Main Train Station (interior).jpg|thumb|300px|Oslo Main Train Station]]
* <listing name="Oslo Central Train Station" alt="Oslo Sentralstasjon/Oslo S, T-bane Jernbanetorget" directions="" address="Jernbanetorget 1, 0154 Oslo" phone="+47 81500888" email="" fax="" url="https://oslo-s.no" hours="" price="">Station is at the eastern fringe of the city center, by the end of the main pedestrian street ''Karl Johans gate''. Oslo S is at the center of Norway's railway, all lines (including the airport express train) terminate at Oslo S, making Oslo S the supreme gateway to Oslo. The major express buses go to the bus station next door to the train station.</listing>
Internationally, there are three daily services to [[Gothenburg]] ([[Sweden]]) (4 hours). Four daily Swedish semi-high speed X2000 trains travel in the direction of [[Stockholm]] ([[Sweden]]) (4 hours 50 minutes), one of which will require a change in [[Karlstad]] (schedule [http://tagtidtabeller.resrobot.se/tidtabell/tag70h_823.pdf]). There are no international night trains to or from Oslo. For [[Copenhagen]] ([[Denmark]]) and beyond, you will have to change trains in [[Gothenburg]].

Tickets for the Gothenburg line are cheaper when bought at the Vy website. Tickets for the Stockholm line are cheaper if you buy them from the Swedish train company SJ's website, where the tickets can be cheaper. Tickets are released for sale 3 months ahead of departure, and the sooner you buy them, the cheaper they will be. Both Norwegian and Swedish prebooked train tickets can be picked up at ticket machines in Oslo Central Station (Norwegian tickets also at other stations).

Norwegian state rail operator Vy runs fairly frequent and semi-efficient, though not fast, domestic services to [[Stavanger]], [[Kristiansand]], [[Bergen]] and [[Trondheim]], as well as a relatively comprehensive local and regional service around Oslo. 

Flytoget (the Airport Express Train) also operates from Oslo S in its own little area clearly marked with signs. See details in the Oslo Airport section.

Long-distance trains heading south- or westwards also stop at Lysaker station at the western city border. Those heading north and east make their first call at Lillestrøm station, outside of the city.

For people using Oslo as a point of transit, it is good to note that Oslo S has two "attached" buildings, both of which can be used to pass through to the trains. Østbanehallen (or Ø) has been recently renovated to include fancy restaurants. Just walk through the escalator to get to the station. Also, Byporten, a narrow shopping mall is also there to be used. Just walk ahead to get to the trains. Each of these also contains a hotel.

It has lockers for rent, a huge variety of cafes and restaurants, and a few hotels. The small lockers are NOK 30, the medium lockers are NOK 40 and the large lockers are NOK 60. The medium lockers also come in two shapes, cubic and thinner but taller, making them useful for storing luggage that would not normally fit (like skis).

===By bus===
Oslo is well served by bus from most of Europe. The biggest operators of international buses are the Swedish company Swebus [http://www.swebus.se/] and the Norwegian company Nettbuss[https://getbybus.com/en/nettbuss]. Both run inexpensive services to and from [[Stockholm]], [[Gothenburg]], [[Malmö]] and [[Copenhagen]] several times a day. 

On domestic services, Nor-Way Bussekspress [http://www.nor-way.no/] is the biggest operator, with several buses to tons of other Norwegian destinations, primarily. These are very useful for reaching along-the-way destinations, as outside of the central parts of Eastern Norway they stop at every single stop along the way, but are tedious for traveling very long distances also covered by train. 
Lavprisekspressen [https://lavprisekspressen.no/] has buses to Trondheim (Friday/Sunday) and Kristiansand/Stavanger (daily), with cheap fares (Internet booking only). 

===By car===
International highways '''E6''' (from Malmö and Gothenburg) and '''E18''' (from [[Saint Petersburg]], Helsinki and Stockholm) meet in Oslo. '''E16''' (from Gävle and Torsby) runs some 40 km north of Oslo, passing the airport, with a branch to the E18 from Hønefoss to Sandvika just west of Oslo. June 1, 2019, a new system of road tax will be implemented, creating 83 "road tax stations" which are basically just cameras that read your license plate. Pricing will change if there are rush hours and based on your car's fuel (gas, diesel, electric, or hydrogen). Rental car companies will just charge you whatever you drive for automatically. Be aware that understanding this road tax system can be complicated for an outsider, and that there is currently political pressure in Norway to reduce the impact of it which could change the outcome of current changes. The road tax company in the Oslo/Akershus area is Fjellinjen.

The E6 is the main north-south road of Norway and continues north to [[Trondheim]], [[Alta]], and [[Kirkenes]], with branches to most Norwegian cities. The '''E16''' runs east to [[Kongsvinger]] and west to [[Bergen]], the '''E134''' to [[Haugesund]] and the '''E18''' run south-west to [[Drammen]], [[Grenland]] ([[Skien]]/[[Porsgrunn]]) and [[Kristiansand]]. Other notable roads into Oslo include '''Rv4''' from [[Gjøvik]] and '''Rv7''', an alternative (and shorter) road to [[Bergen]] passing Gol and [[Geilo]].

Driving in Oslo city areas is getting harder as more roads close or become one-way drives, popular places in the city center are not accessible and parking spots are being more regulated (2-hour rule in many places, high fare). The city is very accessible by public transport, city bikes and walking.

===By boat===
[[Image:Cph_osloferry.jpg|thumb|300px|The ferry to Copenhagen in port]]
Oslo is connected to Denmark and Germany by '''car ferry'''. Color Line [https://www.colorline.no] runs services to [[Kiel]] (Germany) daily. DFDS [http://www.dfdsseaways.co.uk] runs daily services to [[Copenhagen]] (Denmark), and  Stena Line [http://www.stenaline.no/] provides service to [[Frederikshavn]] (Denmark).

You may also want to consider Color Lines high-speed boats from [[Larvik]] (2 hours south of Oslo on E18, or easily reachable by hourly NSB train) or [[Kristiansand]] (4 1/2 hours south of Oslo on E18, or reachable on five daily trains or near-hourly buses) to [[Hirtshals]] (Denmark). They both take some 3 1/2 hours to reach Denmark.

The port for cruise lines is near Akershus Festning, a short walk from downtown. The train station in Kristiansand is close to the ferry quay, while in Larvik the quay has been moved to a location that is a bit of a trek from the station.

==Get around==
There is a comprehensive '''public transport system''' in Oslo, consisting of buses, trams, trains, metro (T-bane) and boats. The public transport is planned and coordinated by Ruter [http://www.ruter.no/en].

Ruter Help Center (formerly known as Trafikanten is the '''information centre''' for public transport in Oslo. It is temporarily situated at the main entrance of Oslo Central Station as well as at Aker Brygge and a few other locations. They hand out free maps, give information, and sell all kinds of tickets. The Ruter website has timetables, maps, route planners, and search engines for all city transport in Oslo, as well as all transport in the nearby counties of Akershus, Østfold, Oppland, Hedmark, Buskerud, Vestfold, and Telemark. The Oslo Tourist Information Centre is in the same office at Jernbanetorget, at the rear counters.

There are two main hubs for public transport inside the city center: Oslo Central Station (Oslo S)/Jernbanetorget and National Theatre (underground). All metro lines pass these stations, all trains pass Oslo S and most trains (including the Airport Express Train (Flytoget)) pass Nationaltheateret. National Theatre is most convenient for key buildings such as the Royal Palace, the National Gallery, the Parliament, Oslo Concert Hall, and Oslo City Hall.

===Tickets and the zone system===
The Oslo and Akershus public transport utilizes a zone system[https://ruter.no/en/buying-tickets/zones/] in which the price for a trip is calculated based on how many zones you pass through. It's likely that most tourists will only use Zone 1, therefore ticket prices listed below are for Zone 1 only.

All public transport runs on the same scheme and your tickets are valid for all Ruter metro, trams, buses, and ferries, and on Vy's trains in Oslo. A  ticket must be stamped or activated (validated), the single ticket is valid for one hour of free travel in the zone(s) the ticket is valid for. You can also get a Travelcard where you load pay-as-you-go-credit.

Period tickets are also available; '''24-hour ticket''', '''7-day ticket''', '''30-day ticket''' and '''365-day ticket'''. 

Student discounts for 30-day tickets are also available, but only if you are studying in Oslo or Akershus area. Read more about other discounts here: [http://ruter.no/en/tickets/Discounts/]. For a short visit, one additional option is to buy a '''Oslo Pass''' which includes free admission to many tourist attractions and other benefits.  

All tickets can be bought digitally on either the Ruter or EnTur[https://om.entur.no/last-ned-appen/] app using a credit or debit card. Physical tickets are available at Ruter Customer Center outside of Oslo S and at most 7-Eleven, Deli De Luca, Mix and Narvesen stores in Oslo and Akershus. There are also ticket machines at all metro stations and a few of the tram stops. All tickets are also valid on night services, running every Friday and Saturday night after the regular service has shut down. 

Make sure that you have a ticket with you when traveling and that it is '''validated''' before boarding public transport. Most physical ticket types and digital ticket types are not valid until they are not activated (validated). On a bus or tram, physical tickets are activated (validated) when you board by holding the card next to a card reader, or occasionally by the driver. On the metro and the large railway stations, you activate the ticket at the platform before entering the train. It is rare that someone will check your ticket when boarding and departing transport. Ticket checks are carried out at random and are fairly common. Being caught without a valid ticket leads to an on-the-spot fine. 

Note: General public transportation tickets are ''not'' valid on the Airport Express Train (Flytoget), the Airport Coach (Flybussen) services, or VyExpress services. They are however valid on Flybussen's service FB2 and FB5.

===By train===
'''Local trains''' cover certain areas of the city, and run out to the neighboring municipalities and towns. The local train network spans across the city limits to neighboring cities and towns. 

Some of the cars on local trains have orange doors, with the notice "Ubetjent" (Unserved) and "Carriage without Conductor". These cars are usually not visited by the conductor, and you can use these cars ''only'' if you have a ticket that is stamped or pre-validated and does not need to be stamped by the conductor. You may be fined if you use one of these carriages with, say a single ticket, and a conductor ''does'' come to check your tickets. If you are unsure about the rules, play it safe and take one of the carriages with black doors and notices marked "Betjent" and "Carriage with Conductor".

In the center, the main station is Oslo Sentralstasjon (Oslo S), which connects to the metro station ''Jernbanetorget'' through a direct link (escalators down by track 1/exit to Oslo City shopping center/bus terminal) and most bus/tram lines above ground. The second downtown station, served by most local trains and several regional ones, is the underground station ''Nationaltheateret'', which is located immediately below the metro station of the same name. Most westbound buses also stop just outside the station.

Punctuality, especially in the winter, can be an issue as the train system is quite run down. However, things have improved since a big program of refurbishment was started in 2010. Please note that regular tickets are valid on the Vy trains, but ''not'' on the Airport Express Train (Flytoget).

===By metro===
[[File:Oslo T-bane at Majorstuen.jpg|thumb|300px|Oslo T-bane at Majorstuen]]
Oslo has one of the largest metro systems in Europe. It is known as the '''Tunnelbane''' or mainly just '''T-bane''' in Norwegian.

To find a T-bane station, just look for the blue and white logo with a "T" within a circle. There are six lines, but the network is easy enough to figure out: all lines merge together into one single tunnel through the city center, from Majorstuen through Jernbanetorget (Oslo S/Oslo Central Station) to Tøyen, and then spread out into the suburbs. A loop line runs in a circle from northern Oslo city center to the center and back. The loop line is called "Ringen" (the ring) in Norwegian.

With rolling stock from the 1960s, the Oslo metro used to be one of the most run-down in Europe, but it has now been fully replaced with new metro trains engineered by Siemens and designed by Porsche. The carriges are called MX3000 and are all modern looking, accessible for wheelchair and stroller users, and clean.

When entering a T-bane station, make sure to pick the correct platform: all stations except three on the loop line (Sinsen, Storo and Nydalen) have separate entrances and separate platforms for trains going west and trains going east. If you have a paper ticket, make sure that it is validated before entering the train.

===By bus or tram===
'''Trams''' and '''buses''' complement the metro network, and use the same tickets. They cover most of the city and run from approx. 5AM to past midnight, on some lines up to 1 AM. Two bus lines, 31 and 37, run all night, every day.

All tram lines run every 10 minutes during the day, and every 20 minutes at night and early morning (30 min on weekend mornings). The main lines cover parts of the city with no metro and are an efficient way of getting around. The main, central tram terminal is at Jernbanetorget, where all lines converge. 

Bus lines cover the rest of the city, as well as several ring lines. Nearly all central bus lines converge at Jernbanetorget. The most useful bus lines for visitors are buses 30, 31, 32, 34, 37, and 54, passing by Jernbanetorget and covering parts of the city with no tram or metro lines. Buses 20 and 21 provide central ring-line service, while buses 23 and 24 cover the highway ring road further out. Some services complement metro stops in the outskirts of Oslo.

Nights after Fridays and Saturdays, buses cover parts of the city with varying frequency. All regular tickets are valid. Most of these start or pass by the bus stops close to the Parliament Building (Stortinget) and Jernbanetorget (Oslo Central Station/Oslo S). 

===By taxi===
Taxis are expensive, so if public transport still runs, use it. Taxis in Oslo as in most of Norway are frequently new, large, and comfortable cars like Volvo or Mercedes. Most taxis wait for customers in a line in front of hotels or train stations, or you can order one by phoning one of the handful of taxi companies (for an extra charge). You can also flag one from the street, or go to a taxi stand.

Several companies compete to have the most incomprehensible price structure. All taxi companies have a starting fee and a fee per kilometer. These fees vary by taxi company and time of day. Usually, there's three different rates: The lowest one is the day rate, usually between 06.00 and 18.00. The next is the evening and night rate, usually 18.00-06.00 M-F and 06.00-18.00 Sa. The last rate is usually for Saturday after 18.00 till Monday 06.00, but different companies do have different time frames. Beware that some companies will operate with a special holiday rate (helligdagstakst) on public holidays, including the night before, which will result in staggering rates.

Taxi drivers in Oslo aren't a particularly jolly breed, but they usually do not speed too much, and taxi crime towards customers is almost non-existent (towards tax authorities, however, is a different matter). Sometimes a taxi driver will attempt to charge you extra for luggage, and some companies do have a surcharge for this. The price structure should be shown on a sticker inside the car but is always in so small print, and with an overwhelming amount of details, you can't possibly decipher it. Another thing that often disturbs visitors is that the taxi driver's name and license are not printed inside the car itself, but this is legal. If you encounter any problems, ask for a receipt which will help you identify the car later, or make a note of the taxi license number on the car roof.

All taxis accept Visa and Mastercard, and the card can be swiped into the meter at the start of the journey for card validation. The driver will usually keep the card on top of the meter so that you can keep an eye on it. If you are uncomfortable with this, it is possible to ask to get the card back, but the card needs to be swiped again when you arrive at your destination. Most meters are just swipe and sign, but some companies have EMV chip terminals where you'll need to authorize the charge with your PIN. There have been no known scams connected to credit card fraud in taxis.

Some people tip taxi drivers or round the bill up to the nearest NOK 10, but taxi drivers do not generally expect a tip - most people pay the exact amount by card anyway.

===By car===
For general information on driving in Norway, see [[Norway]].

The major roads entering Oslo are also used for travel inside the city. In the eastern suburbs, road '''E6''' is the main north-south corridor. East-west transport can be done on road E18 as well as '''Ring 3''' running from E18 at the western city border to E6 in the eastern suburbs. The smaller (and slower) '''Ring 2''' connects Skøyen in the west via Majorstua, Ullevål General Hospital, and Carl Berners Plass to E18 east of the center. The ring roads (as well as other main roads) are great for navigation.

Beware to always give way to trams and pedestrians, unless overridden by signs or traffic lights. ''Never'' challenge the tram, they have a long braking distance and will in any case give a loud, clear warning if you are obstructing. In some roundabouts the tram is driving straight through the island while cars must circle, be extremely careful in this type of roundabouts. Trams are not obliged to yield to pedestrians, while cars must. Park your car at a safe distance from the rails so as not to obscure the tram (ask locals if unsure).

===By boat===

[[Image:Oslo_bygdø.jpg|thumb|300px|View of Bygdøy]]
At Aker Brygge, you can catch boats to different destinations:
* B1-B4 services run to the small, cozy islands just outside Oslo. Locals use these to get a little escape from the city (and from the tourists).
* B10-B22 services run to other places on the west and east coastline in Oslofjord, including Nesodden.
* Bygdøyfergen service is a tourist boat that runs to the Bygdøy peninsula where you can see several museums. This boat is not covered with a standard Ruter ticket but is included in Oslo Pass. If you want to save money and ride with your Ruter ticket, just take the 30 bus service from Nasjonalteateret instead (takes maybe a few minutes more).

===By bicycle===
Cycling in Oslo is a great way to experience the city as a tourist. Many of the city’s streets have separate bicycle lanes and Oslo as a cycling city gets better and better every year.

Where there are not clearly marked cycling instructions, bicycles in Oslo must follow the same traffic rules and road signage as cars under Norwegian law. Cycling on the pavement/sidewalk is allowed, but speed should be greatly reduced and priority and care should be given to pedestrians.

There is a city-wide bike rental system called Oslo Bysykkel[https://oslobysykkel.no/en] and you can find many of these bikes in stations the 250+ dedicated stands around the city center and the surrounding inner suburbs. Rental can be purchased for 60 minutes, 24 hours, 30 days, or 365-day periods. Also, on the Oslo Bysykkel app, you will be allowed to find and unlock bikes and purchase the pass with a credit or debit card.

Oslo Bysykkel bikes are generally in good condition, but always check the lights, brakes, and other parts before cycling. During busy periods, you may find stations empty when you want to find a bike or full when you want to return one. The company works to transfer bicycles between the stations to match demand. The standard city bikes are available from April to November. After that, it is available only a reduced number of winter bikes. 

Lime, a private company, has also started to provide an electric bike rental service in Oslo. You can see these bikes situated free-standing around the city and not in any designated bike stand. These bicycles are motor-powered to help riders easily climb hills and speed up the journey time. You can download the Lime app[https://www.li.me/en-no/the-app] to find a vehicle and scan the QR code on the e-bike to unlock it.

There are several electric scooter companies that operate in the city: major ones are Voi[https://www.voi.com] and Tier[https://www.tier.app/en/]. These can be used by downloading their respective apps, adding a payment card, and using the app to find and unlock bikes.

===Buildings and structures===
Architecture in Oslo may at first seem dull. Unlike for instance its Swedish counterpart, Stockholm, downtown Oslo has only scattered monumental buildings where in particular the Parliament-Palace axis (upper part of Karl Johan Street) has a certain Parisian grandeur. The charm of Oslo can also be found in the affluent inner-city suburbs of for instance Frogner and Fagerborg as well as above St.Hanshaugen Park. Northern Europe has a distinct '''wooden house''' tradition. Wooden houses are not allowed downtown, but these charming houses can be found in large numbers in villa suburbs such as Bygdøy and Holmenkollen, or former workers' areas such as Rodeløkka, Kampen, Vålerenga, Damstredet, Hellerud, or Telthusbakken. Oslo also has many exciting building projects and a huge part of the city's waterfront will in a few years have changed.

Be careful when temperatures go under 5 degrees as the roof may be very slippery! The main highway, which used to pass just between the Opera and Oslo Central Station, is now moved to a sub-sea tunnel under Bjørvika.

These areas were likely to be erased from Oslo in the seventies by eager town planners who wanted highways for cars rather than living areas for the citizens, but luckily they were stopped by idealists who really loved their city. Their effort made these parts of Oslo into something special, even though other Norwegian cities have bigger wooden areas. Still, these areas are a plus for Oslo and its inhabitants as well as for tourists. They are not commonly visited by tourists, and may not be mentioned in your guidebook, but some of the areas have cafes/restaurants worth a visit. In Kampen, you can find a very cozy Elvis café by the church, and in Vålerenga Restaurant Smia is also located by the church.</see>

===Museums===
Oslo has a large number of museums. If you are planning on seeing several of the expensive attractions in a short period of time, then you may consider an '''Oslo Pass''' [http://www.visitoslo.com/en/activities-and-attractions/oslo-pass/]. It includes unlimited entry to most of the museums and the Holmenkollen ski jump (but not the Royal Palace), free travel on Oslo's quite expensive public transport, and even limited discounts on some restaurants and other attractions. Whether the Oslo Pass is truly cost-effective will depend on the range of activities planned and the time period involved. Students get a 20% discount on the Oslo pass, as well as discounts for Children and Seniors; However, museums and transit passes offer similar discounts. You could also buy a travel card allowing unlimited travel on public transport (no student discount on this). You can buy 24, 48, or 72-hour Oslo passes or travel cards. They can be purchased at Tourist Information Offices in Oslo and through the Ruter app (in the App Store and Play).

Somewhat outside the city center is a peninsula called '''Bygdøy'''. You can get there by bus (number 30) or, in summer months (Apr-Sep), by ferry departing from Pier 3 at Aker Brygge outside the city hall (you'll see a big sign that says Bygdøy). Day tickets are not valid on this ferry. At Bygdøy, you will find two groups of museums within walking distance of each other.

Be prepared for some muddy sections of the trail as they take you through some pretty thickly wooded areas. The forest is dense enough that any damp areas of the trail don't dry out. This isn't helped by the multitude of small run-offs flowing down the mountain.</do>

==Work==
Oslo is the capital and the most populated city in the country, the administrative, economic, and cultural center of Norway. The city has grown so much in recent years, that it has completely devoured the region's territory. Almost 25% of the population in Oslo comes from abroad. Norway is famous for its incredible level of equality, tolerance, and acceptance. The city region is growing and building up a new positive reputation - a hub of innovation, a major international business player, and a place of concentration for the most talented experts. Since Oslo invests a lot in the training of knowledge corridors, technology parks, city quarters general business infrastructure, and coworking spaces, the city is considered a future-proof location. If you're looking for work check out the website of the governmental agency '''NAV''' [http://www.nav.no/] or other sites that can easily be found online, specially geared towards workers from outside of Norway. Even though Oslo is considered an expensive city for companies currently located in the capital of Norway and those companies that would like to locate in Oslo, the city itself provides a number of beneficial solutions. Coworking Oslo is one of the most popular solutions among sole proprietorships, medium-sized companies, and Start-Ups. Flexibility, reasonable price, free and fast internet connection, close distance to public transport stops, 27/7 access, administrative support, telephone system, security, cleaning, and other benefits are what modern office Oslo workspace offers to arrive in Norway companies, people who have a working trip to Norway and even digital nomads.

==Buy==
In 2010 Oslo was ranked the most expensive city in the world. Still, there are possibilities for getting bargains in Oslo during the big sales. The prices of famous brands are not higher in Oslo than in London or Paris, often lower even if they are not on sale. The big sales are in January and August.

===Shopping Districts===
[[File:Oslo Aker Brygge (general view).jpg|thumb|300px|Oslo Aker Brygge]]
If you are out to shop there's plenty to choose from. The main pedestrian street Karl Johans Gate has plenty of shops of dubious quality. The street '''Bygdøy allé''' (which is locally famous for its chestnut trees) (bus 20, 31) has regained its reputation of being a shopping street in the past few years through establishments that focus on kitchens, kitchenware, interior designs, exclusive Norwegian furniture, light design, and others. The street '''Møllergata''' (downtown, public transport from stops Stortorget and Møllerveien at either end of the street) was earlier known as the furniture street. You will still find a few good, but rather expensive shops for Norwegian furniture on this street. You can easily find this street close to the Christiania Glasmagasin and the street Torggata which contains a few home interior shops like KID, Hemtex, and Åhlens (with a Muji department in the basement).  Akersgata is famous for several exclusive shops as well as the high-end shopping center Eger at Egertorget. Bogstadveien is a high-end shopping street. Good for non-chain stores, focus on clothes and accessories.

==Eat==
There are a lot of both expensive and cheap places to eat in Oslo. The cheapest restaurants are Asian restaurants which in many cases serve good food at low prices. Check the menus on the door. 

Buy at least one '''Hot dog'''. They are referred to as "pølse" and they are great for keeping the low blood sugar troll at bay and increasing your weight! Other street snacks are also available throughout the city, but it's usually more expensive than in comparable cities elsewhere.

'''Aker Brygge''' (tram 12, bus 21, 32, 33, or 54; stops Aker Brygge, Vika Atrium or Bryggetorget) is a waterfront located south of the city hall. During summer the area is very noisy and vibrant. There are outdoor restaurants and bars almost everywhere. Be sure to get some tasty seafood (or whatever else you like to eat) while you are there, or just enjoy your cold beer in the summer sea breeze. Be advised that this is also the most expensive area in Oslo to dine or drink, so unless the weather is good, you can just as well stay indoors somewhere else. 

'''Sven's''', located near Vika Atrium, offers a fast food version of a traditional dietary staple - lutefisk. Sides include herring, pickled vegetables, and salted meats.  Because of the amount of lye used to treat the food, be prepared to sign a waiver upon entry. 

You are also close to most of the restaurants, bars, or nightclubs located within the city center. A key reference point will be '''Stortingsgaten''', running parallel to '''Karl Johans gate''', both running eastwards from the Royal Palace (this is also the main shopping area). While both of these streets have a few restaurants and nightclubs, most will be found in one of the side streets running out from them, or parallel to them. It doesn't matter much where you start, you will find restaurants, bars, and nightclubs almost anywhere from the subway station National Theatre on the west, to far beyond Oslo Central Railroad Station on the east. There are several other areas, such as '''Grünerløkka''' (tram 11-12-13 to Nybrua, Schous plass, Olaf Ryes plass or Birkelunden), '''Majorstuen''' (T-bane, tram 11-12-19 or bus 20-22-25-45-46 to Majorstua), and '''Grønland''' (T-bane to Grønland, bus 37 to Tøyengata or bus 60 to Norbygata) that are worth checking out. Be advised that nearly all bars and nightclubs close at the same time, so if you want to get a taxi back to your hotel, try to leave a few minutes before the rush starts. 

===Budget===
====Torggata====
Torggata is getting more upmarket. However, you may still find budget dining, like cheap Vietnamese, Thai, and Chinese restaurants and even cheaper kebab joints and pizzerias, as well as other offerings. It's close to the center, but you can get bus 34 or 54 to Jacob kirke/Calmeyers gate or tram 11-12-13-17/bus 30-31 to Brugata or Hausmanns gate. The closest T-bane station is Grønland (then walk north along Brugata) or Jernbanetorget (then walk northeast).

Some great offerings in this area include:
* <eat name="Bari Pizza & Grill" alt="" address="Torggata 23, 0183 Oslo" directions="" phone="+47 22111965" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">The best pizza joint in the area also does decent kebabs.</eat>

==Drink==
===Buying alcohol in stores===
Beer can be purchased in supermarkets for a 0.5l can. Supermarkets stop selling beer after 8 p.m. each day, 6 p.m. on Saturdays, and 3 p.m. on holiday weekends. It is not possible to buy beer in a shop on a Sunday. It is '''illegal''' to drink in public areas. You will usually only get a warning if spotted by a police officer, but if you behave impolitely or he/she is having a bad day you can get a fine. However, in public parks during summer, laws are not enforced as strictly. Good places to go for a park beer are '''Sofienbergparken''' and '''Kuba''' at Grünerløkka, '''Frognerparken''' in Majorstua, or the park at '''St. Hanshaugen''', on a hill with a great view located between Grünerløkka and Majorstuen.

Hard liquor or wine can only be bought at international airport terminals or state-owned shops called Vinmonopolet [https://www.vinmonopolet.no/content/english/about-vinmonopolet]. Vinmonopolet outlets are open Mon-Fri till 6 PM, Sat till 3 PM, Sun closed. Some of the central Vinmonopolet outlets in Oslo are:
* Oslo Central Station, beneath the staircase leading down to Trafikanten
* In the basement of the Oslo City shopping center
* In the Steen og Strøm shopping centre, close to Karl Johans gate
* Rosenkrantzgate 11, close to Grand Hotel, Karl Johans gate
* In the House of Oslo shopping centre, Vika (tram 12 to Vikatorvet)
* Thereses gate, Bislett (near Bislett stadium, trams 17 and 18)

===Pubs and bars===
All bars, pubs, and restaurants in Oslo are smoke-free, which means you have to go outside to smoke. But since you can't drink on the street, you have to leave your drink inside, unless the bar/pub has a designated drink area that is still open (they always close earlier than the venues themselves). Closing hours are as late as 03:30 in the city center. National legislation says you can't serve any alcohol after 03:00. Oslo has a flourishing craft beer scene, mostly (but not exclusively) centered around Torggata. Oslo is generally expensive. 

Areas with notable pub density are '''Grünerløkka''' (tram 11-12-13 to Nybrua, Schous plass, Olaf Ryes plass or Birkelunden), '''Aker Brygge''' (tram 12 to Aker Brygge or bus 21-32-33-54 to Vika Atrium or Bryggetorget), '''Solli/Frogner''' (tram 12-13 or bus 30-31 to Solli), '''Grønland''' (T-bane to Grønland, bus 37 to Tøyengata or bus 60 to Norbygata) and the city center especially '''Youngstorget''' or '''Grensen'''.

===Coffee===
Oslo is ranked as one of the best coffee cities in the world and you will find cafés serving good coffee everywhere. Serious chains like Kaffebrenneriet and Stockfleths are worth a visit, but there are numerous other great places. To mention a very few:
* <drink name="Fuglen" alt="" address="Universitetsgata 2" directions="Tram 11, 17 and 18 to Tullinløkka" phone="" email="" fax="" url="http://www.fuglen.no/" hours="" price="">To enter Fuglen is like enter a living room from the 60s.

Tim Wendelboe means business. It's a tiny establishment and seating is scarce.

They also arrange barista courses.</drink>

==Sleep==
Getting a hotel in Oslo can potentially be difficult. In peak periods, when big fairs or conferences visit Oslo, tourists have been sent as far as Lillehammer (170 km, 2h 15 min by train) to find accommodation. It would be smart to reserve a room in advance. There are also relatively few youth hostels, etc., for backpackers and people traveling on a budget. During Nobel Prize week room availability will fall and prices may double.

===Budget===

====Camping====
If you bring or buy a tent, you can take public transport to for instance Nordmarka (forest area north of the city), and stay for free. See the Norway page for legislation details regarding camping.

==Contact==
===Internet access===
Most of the internet cafes are located in the eastern part of town or Grønland. Look for small shops selling telephone cards - they usually have internet terminals. If you carry your own laptop, WLANs will be easy to find at cafes, hotels, bars, and even in parks. There are several open Wi-Fi connections in the upper-level cafes at the train station Oslo Central Station and the subway station at Grønland.

==Stay safe==

===Crime===
Crime is not a big problem in Oslo, but as in any metropolitan area, some caution is warranted. Avoid getting into quarrels in taxi queues after the closing hours of bars. The police advise that the area along the Akerselva River from Grønland to Kuba is best avoided after dark falls. It is notorious for multiple instances of rape, muggings, and drug dealing. 

There has been a relative increase of rape in Oslo. Authorities have increased the frequency of patrols and have made arrests. Women should remain highly vigilant at night, and when clubs and pubs are closing. Avoid walking alone through parks and poorly lit areas of the city. Do not, under any circumstances, use “pirate taxis” or other unofficial forms of transportation. 

The lower parts of Karl Johan Street (down towards the Central station) are best avoided at night. Be aware of prostitutes approaching you; they often do pickpocketing by coming close to you, flirting, and trying to hold around you. And, for the record: buying sex is strictly illegal in Norway, and can result in a heavy fine.

Since some time back, drug dealers and addicts have now less prevalent than before around the Central Station (Oslo S). This is partly due to crackdowns by police. Currently, the drug trade has mainly moved to the area around Brugata, Hausmanns Gate, and Torggata. It is possible that drugs might be offered to tourists passing by, but the dealers will accept no for an answer and won't further hassle you. The area is also crowded at most hours.

Theft and pickpocketing is a relatively visible problem in some parts of Oslo. Police blame itinerant criminal bands from abroad for some of it. Normal precautionary rules apply:
* Watch out for pickpockets in crowds. Especially packed trams and buses passing through the eastern part of the city (Grønland, Grünerløkka).
* Do not leave your belongings unattended.
* Avoid leaving your cell phone and wallet on café tables.

Homophobic crime is not a huge problem in the city as a whole, but LGBT persons should avoid physical signs of affection, at least in the districts of Grønland and Tøyen due to a large and fairly conservative Muslim immigrant population in the area - there have been cases of homophobic violence in this area in recent years.

Inner-city areas such as Grønland and Tøyen have smaller gangs operating locally, so be vigilant after dark. The chances that something might happen are very slim, but these areas top all statistics in Norway when it comes to crime, assault, and robbery.

===Politics===
Politics is a none-too-sensitive subject in Norway and is often discussed in public. Like in other Western countries, political views differ, and most people seem to tolerate this. There are both far-right and far-left opinions in the everyday crowd, but true extremism is rare. Pay normal attention when expressing your political opinions; violent and autocratic ideologies are generally not tolerated in Norway. In addition, being a highly diverse city, racism and sexism is generally not tolerated among most people in Oslo as in other European cities. In environmental policies, Norwegians have a fairly European-minded attitude when climate issues are discussed, but fewer people (including activists) will be vegetarian.

===Traffic===
Cars are required to yield to pedestrians at marked and signed crossings and will be heavily fined if they don't. However, this rule does not apply to trams (streetcars); the trams have the right of way. Oslo has a web of tram lines downtown and as the trams are fast and heavy, you will certainly lose if you attempt to challenge one.

In recent years there has been a surge of electric scooters for rent around Oslo. Even if there are restrictions on the use of these, they are, unfortunately, not usually enforced. The result of this is that the streets are full of people driving around on the scooters, and unfortunately many show an utter disregard for traffic safety rules and fellow pedestrians. Be attentive and stay vigilant of the scooters when walking around downtown Oslo.

===Water===
Oslo has one of the world’s cleanest drinking water supplies. It comes from lakes and rivers in Oslomarka and is treated at a waterworks before it reaches the tap. Drinking water from the tap is perfectly safe and is both cheaper for you and better for the environment.

===Winter conditions===
In winter watch out for icy patches, and when wandering in the forest beware when crossing snowy clearings - they may well be frozen lakes with snow over them, which may look safe but could crack. Finally, beware of snow and icicles falling from the roofs in Oslo - there are usually red/yellow signs upwards, and some areas are occasionally cordoned off.

==Cope==
It is easy to get around in Oslo, and almost every Norwegian speaks English. Most people will respond in English to any question you may have. Some Norwegians also speak some German or French.

A couple of mobile apps will make your stay incredibly more easy. 
*"RuterBillett" for buying single and period tickets for the mentioned services. 
*"RuterReise" to quickly find out what bus, metro, train, or tramlines to use. 
*"FinnPolet" to find the state-owned shops that have a monopoly on all alcoholic beverages exceeding 4.7%. 
*"Turdus" to locally download all the articles on Wikitravel. English version 68MB.

==Get out==
* '''[[Drammen]]''' used to be a totally unremarkable industrial city dubbed "the biggest road crossing of Norway". Even if traffic is still rife, the city has gone through a facelift, and the center is as cozy as any. TIMEkspressen bus line 1 (every hour, day and night) and 10, and 3 trains an hour gets you there and away.
* '''[[Drøbak]]''' is another of the picturesque, small seaside towns dotted all over southern Norway, and the closest to Oslo. A nice place to get away from the big city bustle, even if Drøbak also can become crowded in summer. Buses run at least hourly.
* '''[[Fredrikstad]]''' is a very enjoyable city not far from Oslo, with a walled old town and lots of street life in summer. Trains run approx. every hour (taking 1h10min), and express buses run about 10 times per day (1h 30min).
* '''[[Kongsberg]]''' is a beautiful city well-known for its silver mining history. The city is located about an hour and a half west of Oslo by train or bus. The Kongsberg International Jazz Festival is hosted here every year in early July.
* '''[[Oslofjord]]''' is the 120 km long fjord on which Oslo is situated at the bottom of Oslo. The outer part of the fjord is the most tourist-friendly, with thousands of islands and hundreds of beaches situated near a line of cities containing 8 of the 20 largest urban areas in Norway. All of these cities are reached most easily by taking the Inter City-trains bound for [[Skien]], [[Halden]] or boats from Vippetangen (+91-92-93-94), bus 60 runs to the quay). During the summer island hopping in the [[Oslofjord]] is recommended.
* '''Oslomarka''' is the 20 to 40 km wide forest surrounding the city. This is an important recreational area for the citizens of Oslo, and quite unique for a capital. Take the T-bane to Holmenkollen (line 1), Frognerseteren (line 1), Sognsvann (line 3) or Skullerud (line 3 - in the opposite direction of Sognsvann), bus 41 from Røa T-bane to Sørkedalen or bus 51 from Nydalen T-bane to Maridalen. You can also visit the tourist association at Storgata (at Kirkeristen tram stop) for good maps and inexpensive accommodation alternatives in Oslomarka.
* '''Son''' is also one of the coastal pearls. Take a local train to Moss, alight at Sonsveien station, and take the bus that meets most (but not all) trains.
* '''[[Tønsberg]]''' is an attractive seaside town with an attractive city center. It's the oldest town in Norway, and even if this isn't instantly visible, there's lots of history to digest. Excellent highways will take you to the city in an hour from Oslo. The train takes around 1h 10min.
