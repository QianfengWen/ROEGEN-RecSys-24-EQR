'''Hilo''' is a city on the [[Big Island]] of [[Hawaii]].  The county seat and largest city in Hawaii County, Hilo is one of the best starting points to explore the eastern half of the island, including Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.

==Get in==
'''Hilo International Airport''' [http://airports.hawaii.gov/ito/] Hilo Airport is the main airport serving Hilo and the eastern side of the Big Island.  The majority of flights to Hilo originate from Honolulu via Hawaiian Airlines and Southwest.  There is also one flight from Kahului daily, and one non-stop flight from LAX daily, operated by United Airlines.

Most of the visitors bound for Hilo will arrive via one of the inter-island Airlines (Hawaiian and Southwest), or as a day stop from one of the frequent cruise ship visits.

==Get around== 
[[Image:2003_night_kilauea_lava.jpg|thumb|400px|Lava flow at Kilauea.]]
As public transportation on Hawai`i Island is minimal, virtually all visitors rent a vehicle from one of the many rental agencies upon arriving at Hilo International Airport.  As an alternative, taxis are also available at the airport through renting a car is almost always more practical.  The county's Hele-On Bus system ($1 fare) does not serve Hilo International Airport, though, for those who travel light, it's theoretically possible to walk to Mamalahoa Hwy in the heat to catch a bus, which runs only a few times a day, please check schedules.  It's a good idea to make car reservations in advance, as special events or active conditions at the Volcanoes National Park can quickly deplete the supply of available vehicles.

* '''King Kamehameha Statue''' - Erected in 1997 at Wailoa State Park, the statue of King Kamehameha is perhaps the most impressive of the four found throughout the state.  A gift from the island of Kauai failed to erect the statue due to the historical significance of being the only island never to be conquered by Kamehameha the Great. Standing at 14 feet tall, the statue now overlooks Hilo where the first King of Hawaii established his seat of government.
* '''Lili'uokalani Gardens''' - Located on Banyan Drive, this authentic Japanese garden was built in the early 1900s as a memorial to the immigrant Japanese who developed the old Waiakea Sugar Plantation and is named in honor of Hawaii's last reigning monarch, Queen Liliuokalani. The park lies southeast of downtown Hilo, on the Waiakea Peninsula in Hilo Bay. Much of the park now consists of Edo-style Japanese gardens and is said to be the largest such garden outside Japan. The gardens contain Waihonu Pond as well as bridges, ponds, pagodas, statues, torii, and a Japanese teahouse.
* '''Mokuola (Coconut Island)''' - Mokuola is a small island in Hilo Bay. It is a small park and is connected to the main island via a footbridge. The island includes a large grassy field, picnic areas, restroom facilities, and a few tiny sandy beaches. A popular recreational activity is to jump off the tower into the waters of Hilo Bay. The name Mokuola translates as "healing island" or "island of life" from the Hawaiian language. Moku meaning "island" and ola means "life." It was the site of an ancient temple dedicated to healing. It is located off Banyan Drive. Legend tells that anyone who was sick or feeling ill would be healed by swimming around Mokuola three times.
* <see name="Naha Stone" alt="" address="300 Waianuenue Ave" directions="in front of the Hilo Public Library" phone="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">It was prophesied that the man who moved the Naha stone, which weighs nearly 5000 pounds, would unite all of the Hawaiian islands and be the greatest king of all Hawaii.  Kamehameha, at the age of fourteen, not only moved the stone, but lifted it end over end, and he eventually fulfilled the prophecy. The Pinao stone, which sits next to the Naha stone, once guarded an ancient temple.</see>

A ''tsunami'', Japanese for “harbor waves” is a fact of life in Hawaii, especially in Hilo.  On 1 April 1946, and 23 May 1960, Hilo suffered devastating tsunamis that reshaped its social and economic structure. The goals of the Museum are to promote public tsunami education and to preserve history. The Museum serves as a living memorial to those who lost their lives in past tsunami events.</see>
* '''Rainbow Falls''': If you don't have time to make it up to Akaka Falls, or you don't like hiking, Rainbow Falls is worth a visit. Try to visit early in the day. You have a better chance to see the rainbow created by the mist. Drive-up Waianuenue Avenue from downtown, following the signs. If you pass the hospital, you have gone too far. Very wheelchair accessible, but the Boiling Pots will require some hiking. 
{{infobox|WARNING|Do not swim in boiling pots or anywhere in the Wailuku river! A combination of strong undertow and hidden lava tubes underwater make this river the deadliest one on the East side of Hawaii. Do not swim anywhere in this river, and if you see other people swimming, do your best to warn them|print=fullpage}} 
* '''Waiakea Pond''': The largest natural lake on Hawaii's Big Island is Waiakea Pond. Waiakea Pond is connected to Wailoa Stream which meanders on its journey down from the lower reaches of Mauna Loa volcano in the center of the island toward the ocean at Hilo. It collects freshwater from a number of springs, with excess water flowing out through a channel to Wailoa Stream which empties into the ocean at Hilo Bay. Waiakea Pond is regularly used for fishing, with the portion of the lake south of the footbridges designated as public fishing waters.

==Stay Safe==
Hilo is generally safe. There are usually homeless people loitering around public parks and sometimes they can be a little aggressive, just be aware of your surroundings.

==Respect==
*'''Haole''': Though many think that "haole" just means white person, it refers more to an attitude than anything else. Hilo is a workaday town that more represents "old Hawai'i" and sees a limited number of tourists.  Locals, known as kama'aina, deal with tourists less often than in the resort areas, so respecting the local people and culture is very important.
 
* Those who speak the Hawai'ian language tend to be either young or very old.  A large portion of the population speaks Hawai'ian pidgin, but does not attempt to speak it. If a much younger person calls you "Unko" (uncle) or "Antie" (aunt), it is simply a sign of respect and acceptance.  But do not call someone close to your own age "Unko" or "Antie," because it could be taken in a negative way. And, sadly, "thank you" has become more common than "mahalo" even in Hilo.

*'''For Surfers''': If your home break is aggressive, do not bring that attitude with you. Especially when the waves get heavy, do not be a wave hog or try to drop in on others. You will find trouble if you don't know the rules.

* If you remember only one thing in this section, Hawai'i like most places in the world will be a fun adventure if you just smile and be polite.  If you will simply do that, then much aloha will come back to you.  As the saying goes, "Come to Hawai'i with your aloha...or don't come at all."

==Get out==
Check with your car rental company before driving to the Mauna Kea summit. Four-wheel drive is highly recommended.

* <listing name="Akaka Falls State Park" alt="" directions="11 mi/18 km N of Hilo at the end of Hwy 220" address="" phone="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">This awe-inspiring waterfall is the highest falls on the island.  The loop trail is an easy walk through the tropical rainforest and provides several viewing opportunities.  Kahuna Falls can also be viewed from the trail, though it is much less impressive than Akaka Falls.</listing>

* <listing name="Nani Mau Gardens" alt="" directions="3 mi/5 km from Hilo" address="421 Makalika St" phone="+1 808 959-3500" email="" fax="" url="https://www.nanimaugardenshilo.com/" hours="" price="">Nani Mau, which translates as "forever beautiful", features over 50 acres of artistically-landscaped displays of native and exotic tropical flowers and plants, a spectacular orchid garden, rare palms and tropical fruit orchards.  First opened to the public in 1972, this tropical garden claims to have every flowering plant in Hawaii.</listing>

* <listing name="Pana’ewa Rainforest Zoo" alt="" address="" directions="off Hwy 11" phone="+1 808 959-9233" url="" hours="9AM-4PM daily" price="Free" lat="" long="" email="" fax="">This is the only zoo in the U.S. situated in a tropical rainforest - a playground for exotic birds and animals, including a white Bengal tiger and pygmy hippos. Three squirrel monkeys from the old Pearl City Tavern (now closed and razed, replaced by an auto dealership) are there as well. (Namasté, the tiger died on January 16, 2014.  The zoo has plans to renovate the enclosure before obtaining another tiger.)</listing>

* '''[[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park]]''' - The entrance to the park is in the town of Volcano, roughly 40 minutes drive from downtown Hilo.  Many people can spend several days exploring all that the park has to offer. There are a number of excellent hikes, showcasing most of the flavors of Hawaiian geological activity.  Of course, the thing that most people come to see is the active flow zone of Kilauea.  Entrance fees are consistent with other U.S. National Parks.

* '''Mauna Kea''' - It is a dormant volcano. Go to Saddle Road via State Highway 11 (either turn right on E Puainako St, and then reaching the end of a T-intersection, turn right and then make a left and with an unsigned Hawaiian Route 200; or take the Waianuenue Ave (changes into Kaumana Dr), and then after you reach an end, turn right and you will be on Saddle Road). Four-wheel drive is required to reach the summit, but the Visitor's Center, which is at approximately 9,300 feet, is reachable by a good 2-wheel drive car with excellent brakes (for the descent). An optimal view of the night sky can be seen thereafter sunset, enhanced by large telescopes set up for free viewing. However, check the phase of the moon; if the moon is full, you will not be able to see any stars or planets, but only the moon, in the telescopes.
