Regina is pronounced [ ri-jayh-nuh ] similar to the word angina.

Visiting comedians doing a basic comparison of the name to a women’s body part in their set have been greeted with stony silence. Visiting musicians such as Mick Jagger were enthusiastically received when he described that he learned that Regina is the city that “rhymes with fun”.

==Get in==

===By plane===
*'''Regina International Airport''' ({{IATA|YQR}}), 5201 Regina Ave, [http://www.yqr.ca/]. Only minutes from downtown Regina, it has eight gates which handle flights to major centres in Canada via Air Canada and WestJet, plus weekly seasonal flights via WestJet to [[Las Vegas]], [[Phoenix]], and [[Orlando]] and charter flights to sun destinations during winter.  Regional airlines provide service to Saskatoon, Prince Albert and points in northern Saskatchewan.

Public transport (bus #8) can be reached by walking (1.2 km; 15 mins) from the airport to the nearest bus stop at Regina ave and Pasqua st. Fare is $2.50 (adult). Bus heads downtown.

*Regina sits along the Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1 in Saskatchewan) and is a 40-minute drive east of Moose Jaw. Saskatoon is 2.5 hours to the north on Highway 11, Calgary is 7 hours to the west on Highway 1, and Winnipeg is a 5-hour drive to the east on Highway 1.  Highway 6 runs north-south through the city along Albert Street, the main street, and runs south to the U.S. border (Raymond and Plentywood, Montana), which is about 90 minutes away.  North it eventually leads to the parklands in central Saskatchewan and is one of four routes to Prince Albert (the others being Highway 11, Highway 2 via 11 and Highway 20 via 11).  Highway 33 runs to southeast Saskatchewan and the cities of Weyburn and Estevan. Highway 46 is a short commuter highway to Balgonie, Saskatchewan.

Regina is pretty navigable, especially its inner city area which roads are on a grid, like most other cities around the region.  Regina also has a Ring Road, though it is only a half ring road and can take you through most of the city.

'''Wascana Centre''' is a huge 9.3 square kilometre (2300-acre) park that is built around the shores of Wascana Lake, a man made lake in the heart of Regina. It is one of [[North America]]'s largest urban parks, and includes several attractions, such as several walking and bicycle paths, the Saskatchewan Science Centre, an outdoor pool, a marina with boat rentals, the Saskatchewan Legislative building, and the Saskatchewan Centre of the Arts.

A few statues dot the park, there is a playground on the South East corner. The park is well treed and has many benches. On summer afternoons expect downtown's business-people to populate the park equally with teenagers (who mostly stay on the grass). The park is on the North side Victoria Avenue between Scarth and Lorne Streets.
*'''A.E. Wilson Park''' has the Northern entry point to the Devonian Pathway. There are many path intersections in this area, making it great for short walks.

*'''Douglas Park''' houses the Canada Games Athletic Complex and Leibel Field.
*'''Wascana Hill''' With Regina being located on the flat prairies, there are no natural view points.

A roadway allows you to drive to the top for an excellent view of the surrounding city, including the University of Regina, Wascana Centre, the Legislative Building, and the downtown city skyline. In the winter a tobogganing area is popular with local families.

==Stay safe==
Much like Saskatoon, Regina has a higher-than-average crime rate per capita, but unless you go out looking for trouble, nothing is likely to happen to you. The downtown area is quite safe, though you may run into the occasional panhandler or drunken person at night.

The two main neighbourhoods to avoid in Regina are the North Central and Heritage/Chinatown districts, (which are located northwest and northeast of the downtown core), and where most of the crime and prostitution is concentrated.

==Get out==
*'''Moose Jaw''' - Chief attractions are the excellent Western Development Museum (one of four in the province) near the intersection of Main St. and the Trans-Canada Highway (Highway #1). This museum's focus is on transportation, which fills it with excellent, bright displays of antique trains, automobiles, and aircraft, with even one prairie boat thrown in! Another notable tourist attraction is the pair of "tunnels of Moose Jaw" tours, which take visitors through a set of winding tours above and below the downtown core of "the Friendly City." The tours have two themes: the Chinese immigrant experience, and the bad old days of the 1920s, when Chicago mobster Al Capone allegedly took a ride to the northwest terminus of the Soo Line Railway in Moose Jaw to hide out whenever the "heat" was turned up in Chicago.
*'''Regina Beach''' - 35 miles northwest of Regina, north of Hwy 11. This beach community and several others sit on Last Mountain Lake.
*'''Fort Qu'Appelle''' for decades, has been another summer getaway, with several shallow lakes in the vicinity lined by rows of cottages and boat houses.
*'''Rouleau''', a small town located about 45 minutes south of Regina, has become a popular destination in recent years due to it being used as the filming location for the popular TV sitcom ''Corner Gas''. (The studio where the rest of the series was filmed is located near Broad Street and College Avenue in downtown Regina.)
