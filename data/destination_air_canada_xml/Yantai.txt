'''Yantai''' (烟台 ''Yāntái'') is a port city in [[Shandong]] province, [[China]].

==Understand==
Yantai is a small sleepy port city on the Shandong coast that to this day still retains some of its colonial charm.  The city is fairly small but there is a bustling development zone and large container and shipbuilding ports.  There are a number of western expats working here on the docks and teaching English.  However, the Yantai PSB refuses to grant work visas for private English schools. They also refuse to recognize work visas from other municipalities even, if you work for the same franchise in Yantai. They will say it is because the school is too small. However, the fee for a work visa is only 800rmb per year. Shaking down teachers on business or student visas or visas from another city might net them 5000rmb-10000rmb per. Hopefully Beijing will see this and push local PSB's to issue work visas for established schools rather than this extortion. It makes them look really bad.

Yantai is home to Yantai Raffles (in Chinese: 烟台莱福士船厂) (Coordinates: 37°35′48″ N,121°23′39″E), which owns the largest ship building crane in the world, towering over the eastern edge of the T shaped peninsula. Yantai is known for tasty fruit, especially cherries, apples, peaches and pears and is also the home of Changyu Wines.

The seaside is home to a promenade for walking or relaxing. Among the seaside attractions is a great water, light and sound show: nightly at the promenade. It is definitely worth seeing. 

==Get in==

===By plane===
International flights to Seoul, Osaka and Hong Kong are available. Domestic flights connect Yantai with more than 20 major cities in China, such as Beijing (daily, 1 hour), Harbin (daily, 2 hours), Jinan, (daily, 35 minutes), Shenyang, (daily, 2 hours), Ningbo (daily, 1.5 Hours), Dalian (daily, 45 minutes) Chengdu (4 hours), Guangzhou (3 hours), Kunming (4 hours), Shanghai (daily, 1.5 hours), Shenzhen (3 hours), Wuhan (daily, 2 hours) and Xi'an (2 hours). A new airport opened in 2015 in Penglai, the old airport in Laishan is closed to the public.

===By train===
Yantai is easily accessible from Jinan and Qingdao with frequent trains daily and a high speed train to Qingdao.. There are two high speed rail trains per day from Beijing via Tianjin. But rail transport may be inconvenient if you travel long-distance, as there are no direct or fast trains. Sometimes you need to transit at Jinan.

===By road===
The Yantai-Weifang (272 km/169 mi), Yantai-Qingdao (276 km/172 mi) and Yantai-Weihai (86 km/53 mi) high quality superhighways have been put into service. Minibuses run between Yantai and nearby cities, such as Qingdao (3.5 hours) and Weihai (1.5 hours). The long distance bus station is southwest of the railway station on Qingnian Lu.

===By water===
There are seven slow boat departures daily to Dalian at the ferry terminal. A third class bed costs ¥114-160 and the journey takes 8 hours. An alternative fast boat (four departures daily) which takes only 3.5 hours at ¥170. There are also boats to Tianjin, but only in the summer. Several Korean ports can be reached by boat which takes approximately 16 hours, including Incheon (Mo-We-Fr 19:00, Tu-Th-Sa 10:30). Japan can be reached by boat which takes approximately 30 hours, Kobe (Tuesday, noon).

==Get around==
City transport: There are about 30 public bus lines in service. Bus Line No.10 and 17 are by far the most useful for travelers for sight seeing purposes. No. 10 goes from the railway station, then passes Nan Dajie and turns east down the coast. No. 17 goes from the railway station to the coast and all the way to the municipal government in newly-developed Laishan District. Taxi is a good means of going places with a flagfall fare of ¥8 (Although many taxis still have ¥7 posted). A 30-minute of taxi ride would probably cost you around ¥30.

And an amusement park with a variety of roller coasters ranging from bumper cars to a log ride.

The zoo is open all year round along with certain parts of the amusement park. People will be seen climbing the mountain most days through out the year. The paddle boats on the lake are not available in the winter as the lake freezes over. On a nice day however there are many couples, families and friends out exploring the lake.

This is a good spot to visit to see a variety of people in Yantai. On the weekends when the weather is nice there are large crowds. On the week days it is much calmer. 

Climbing the mountain gives you an opportunity to observe people practicing Tai Chi, singing traditional Chinese songs, and sometimes you might even find older couples dancing.</see>

Xianying Palace is a temple that was built during the Northern Song Dynasty, starting in 1122. It was originally a Taoist temple to the sea goddess Matsu, but became Buddhist later. At the present time the local government has restored the temple to its Ming Dynasty appearance, although many additions had been made during the Qing.  The Changdao Islands are now open to non-Chinese nationals. Avoid during Chinese holidays, or make sure you get to the ferry at 6am, as it will become impossibly crowded later.</see>

* <eat name="Druid's Irish Pub &amp; Restaurant" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="" email="" fax=""> Serves Western meals just like Ma used to make. Druid’s is a little piece of Ireland, a sliver of the emerald isle inside the Middle Kingdom and is a favourite among expatriates. A great way to step out of the hustle and bustle of China and into a Irish state of mind. Druid's has the distinction of being one of the few places in mainland China and the only in Yantai to serve real Guinness & Kilkenny beer on tap and Magners Irish Cider. The food menu is well priced and lists an assortment of popular pub grub like Bangers & Mash and Guinness Stew to excelent steaks, and seafoods.
The beverages include beers, wines and spirits from around the world and of course great cocktails. In fact, whatever it is that you fancy - they most probably have it!
They focus on sourcing the best quality ingredients, preparing them simply and delivering plenty of flavour and texture. This is simple, good, honest and robust food with its origins firmly in the Western tradition. There is nothing frilly or fancy.
Hospitality exudes naturally from thier staff; they are good-natured with friendly efficient service, speak English well and have that all important smile. Friendliness, humor, hospitality, fine food and drink: all these combine to create the Druid’s experience.</eat>
