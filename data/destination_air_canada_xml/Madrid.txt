'''Madrid''' [http://www.esmadrid.com] is the capital and the largest city of [[Spain]], as well as the capital of the autonomous community of the same name ([[Comunidad de Madrid]]). The city has a population of approximately 3.2 million, and the metro area has a population of nearly 6.7 million. Madrid is best known for its great cultural and artistic heritage, a good example of which is the El Prado Museum. Madrid also boasts some of the liveliest nightlife in the world.

==Understand==
The etymology of Madrid’s name is shrouded in myth and takes long stories to explain possible meanings. On the spot, the locals will be precise about all the details.

===Location===
Madrid is located just northeast of the geographical center of the [[Iberia|Iberian Peninsula]], in the middle of the Spanish central Castillian plateau (Meseta central), at an average altitude of 650m. Nearly all of the most famous tourist areas are located in the center of the city including Puerta del Sol, Plaza Mayor, Palacio Real, and Plaza de Colón. The major streets in Madrid include the Gran Via, Alcalá Street, and Paseo de la Castellana. The oldest parts of the city are located on the hills next to the left bank of the Manzanares River.

===Climate===
The climate of Madrid is continental, mainly dry and quite extreme at times. Madrid sees perpetual sunshine, a characteristically hot and dry summer, and a fairly cold winter with frequent frosts during the night and the occasional snowfall. Spring and autumn are mild with the most rainfall concentrated in these seasons. Madrid has over 300 days of sunshine per year, making it one of the sunniest cities in Europe. Spring and autumn are definitely the best times to visit, especially the months of April, May, June, September, and October. There is a very little rainfall during summer and also less rainfall during winter. During winter snow occurs sporadically; however, snowfall usually lasts only for a few days, but there is abundant snowfall in the adjacent mountain ranges nearby.

===Culture===
[[Image:PlazaMajor.jpg|thumb|300px|Plaza Mayor]]
The culture of Madrid is largely influenced by its royal history, as the center of the Spanish Empire. The Royal Palace, big places and buildings used by the Spanish Monarchy. Enormous cathedrals and churches are plentiful in Madrid, as well as medieval architecture, although nowadays Madrid is as cosmopolitan a city as [[Berlin]] or [[London]], full of new architecture, lifestyle and culture.

As the Spanish Capital, Madrid has been emblematic of the different "establishments" for most Spaniards. During the 2nd Republic (1931-1936) it was a bustling city of new ideas. As the capital of the Francoist dictatorship (1939-1975), the city still appears to many Spaniards as a conservative part of Spain. However, the city was also the epicenter of the famous Movida, the Spanish movement of the 80s that raised figures such as director Pedro Almodóvar. The heritage of this era is indeed still visible in the city center, where a party can be found at all times and one of the most liberal and colorful environments of Spain can be seen. 

The citizens of Madrid, who refer to themselves as '''Madrileños''' or the more traditional and currently seldom used term "gatos" (cats), live by a daily routine that is heavily influenced by the climate. Due to the typical midday heat during summer, a "siesta" can be still observed during which some citizens take a break to cool off. Madrileños can usually only afford this "luxury" during holidays and weekends. Most stores are open all day; only smaller stores are often closed during this time. Workers and those more affected by the Western lifestyle choose not to take this long break and work traditional working hours, which are usually 9am to 7pm. During the summer many offices, however, will have a summer schedule requiring workers to start at 8am and finish at 3pm (most commonly without the standard 1-2 hour break for lunch). Offices usually close during the weekend but businesses are often open Saturday morning (downtown stays open until the afternoon). Most grocers are closed on Sundays, but some major chain and department stores linked to "culture" (books, music, etc.) will be open throughout the day, and all of them on the first Sunday of the month. Shops and department stores in Puerta del Sol area are open every day.

Madrid possibly has the largest number of bars per capita of any European city and a very active nightlife. Madrileños are known to stay up until as late as 5AM-7AM. It is quite common to see a crowded Gran Vía on weekend nights. It is important to note that, due to this lifestyle, lodging located near the fun areas may end up a nightmare for light sleepers if your window faces the street.

Madrid has a very modernized and elaborate transportation network of buses and the Metro. The city contrasts with some large European cities in that it is extremely clean, and city employees in bright yellow vests can almost always be seen cleaning the streets and sidewalks. Like most large cities, however, there is a substantial population of vagrants and beggars lining the streets.

Madrid is one of the biggest and most cosmopolitan cities in Europe. Communities of West Africans, North Africans, other Europeans, Chinese, Indians, Filipinos, Pakistanis, and (especially) Latin Americans are prominent.

Some popular neighborhoods are:
* '''Alonso Martínez''' - Many pubs and small discos are active until about 3AM. A very young crowd, and if you′re around here before midnight, and over the age of 20, prepare to feel positively old. Most places close around 3AM, then people move to nearby areas to continue partying (clubs in Gran Vía or Tribunal).
* '''Barrio de las Letras''' / '''Huertas''' - Many of Spain's most famous writers lived there (Cervantes, Quevedo, etc.). It's in between Lavapiés, Puerta del Sol, and Paseo del Prado. It is an area full of history and interesting buildings and is also well-known because of its concentration of bars, pubs, restaurants, and hotels. Plaza de Santa Ana is a beautiful square. It can be considered "too touristic" for some local people.
* '''Chueca''' - Near Malasaña and Gran Vía. It is the gay district (although no one is ever excluded) with a very strong personality. New design, trendy shops, cool cafes. Pop and electronic music. By far, the most cosmopolitan place in town. Has become quite chic and expensive.
* '''Ciudad Universitaria''' -  area where most of the students reside as there are several dorms in this area. There are many cheap bars with great nightlife starting from Thursdays.
* '''Conde Duque''' - Like Malasaña, this district shares a similar audience. Calle Conde Duque is full of cafés and restaurants. Between the main squares in the district, Plaza de Guardias de Corps and Plaza de las Comendadoras, you will also find other options to have drinks, cafés, or tapas. The Conde Duque Cultural Centre usually hosts shows, concerts, and exhibitions. 
* '''Gran Vía''' - The place that never sleeps. A major street that includes many popular nightclubs usually is open from 1AM to 6-7AM.
* '''La Latina''' - It is the place near Lavapiés to go for tapas and is full of bohemian young people looking for stylish bars. In the old section, many small bars and pubs, a generally older crowd (the late 20s, 30s - you know, "adults"). Contains La Cava Baja street. Avoid places in the Plaza Mayor but sunbathing and beers are suitable. Multiple bars serving fantastic tapas in the Cava Baja and Cuchilleros. The area centered on Calle Calatrava (what the locals call 'Chuecatina') is has developed into a gay (very hetero-friendly) zone. It's surprisingly very crowded on Sunday mornings, from 11AM to late in the afternoon due to its close location to the flea market El Rastro.
* '''Lavapiés''' - Multicultural quarter of the city, with more than 50% foreign residents, mostly from Africa, Asia, and Latin America. An increasing amount of westerners are choosing Lavapies as their residence in Madrid, mainly because of the hip vibe it has attained in recent years. Plenty of world music bars and many alternative theaters and art galleries. Lavapiés is maybe the most cosmopolitan and hippy area at the same time in Madrid. Indian restaurants, alternative cafés, African music, and South American shops. Several community gardens, food co-ops, and eco shops are scattered around the district. Not a lot of tourists here since the quarter holds no monumental sights but has a rather unique atmosphere. Walking around for a beer or a coffee is well worth it.
* '''Moncloa''' - Due to its proximity to the main University in Madrid (Universidad Complutense), Moncloa is associated with students and a student lifestyle, many cheap bars, and discos as it is near the university, although some of the places are best avoided.
* '''Salamanca''' - Plenty of expensive boutiques, unique shops with impossible prices, and department stores. 
* '''Torre Europa'''. In front of the stadium, under the tower, there were several luxury pubs and clubs. There are 4 or 5 bars and discos in the Avenida de Brazil area catering to a young and student crowd.
* '''Tribunal''' / '''Malasaña''' - Hip area. You can enjoy a café, a dinner, a book or just some drinks. Mainly rock and pop music clubs, some of them still open from "La movida madrileña" (a vibrant cultural period from the early 80s). Calle Manuela Malasaña is a great place to eat. Such is Calle del Pez although it has mostly bars. Plaza Dos de Mayo is the heart of the district and a great place to have a drink.

[[File:Madrid - Barajas airport (interior general view).jpg|thumb|300px|Barajas airport]]
'''Adolfo Suárez Madrid-Barajas Airport''' ({{IATA|MAD}}), +34 902 404 704, [https://www.aena.es/es/adolfo-suarez-madrid-barajas.html?/utm_source=Google&utm_medium=GMB_MAD] is located 13km from the city center. It is one of the largest airports in Europe and is serviced by many airlines, as well as being the home base for Iberia Airlines. The airport has 4 terminals. Terminals 1, 2, and 3 are close together and served by the same metro station, while Terminal 4 is far from those and has its own metro and commuter train stations. 

The traveler may be required to show a valid visa at the airport immigration, depending both on the duration and purpose of their stay in Spain[https://www.spainvisa.eu/].

The best way to move downtown is to take the Metro (line 8 pink, from 06:30 to 01:30, to/from the airport) to Nuevos Ministerios station from all terminals. It is clean, safe, frequent, fast, and inexpensive. The airport is located within the city limits of Madrid and is just 9 km (6 miles) away in 25 minutes from the city's financial district. In order to reach the city center (Sol, Ópera, or Gran Vía), or other stations consult the metro map. 

Terminal 4 of the airport, in additionally to the metro network, is also connected to the city by ''Cercanias'' commuter train[https://www.madrid-traveller.com/madrid-cercanias-train-tickets/] (line C-1, from 06:00 to 22:30,  €3.10) which goes directly to ''Atocha'' and ''Chamartin'' mainline train stations. To connect the ''Sol'', take the train (look for ''Renfe Cercanias'') to "Nuevos Ministerios" and then transfer to line C-3 or C-4 southbound on platform 8. ''Sol'' will be the first stop. If you are connecting to a long-distance or AVE train at ''Atocha'' or ''Chamartin'', then your ''Cercanias'' (C-1, and any connecting C trains) ticket is free. You will still need to get the actual ''Cercanias'' ticket. Ask at the RENFE kiosk at Barajas Terminal 4 directly across from the automatic machines where most people purchase their C-1 ticket (just before you reach the C-1 turnstiles). Show your ticket to the attendant and they'll issue your free ''Cercanias'' ticket. 

Another way of reaching downtown is a '''24-hour express bus service'''[http://www.emtmadrid.es/Aeropuerto?lang=en-GB] that passes all terminals and then goes direct to ''O'Donell'', ''Cibeles'' (20 minutes walk or quick metro ride to ''Puerta del Sol'') and ''Atocha'' ('''main train station''', not serviced between 11:30 PM and 6 AM). The ticket is paid in cash to the bus driver. Departures every 12 minutes (daytime) to 35 minutes (late at night). Travel time Terminal 4 (end of the line) - Cibeles 30-40 minutes. 

Public bus No 200 operates between the airport and Avenida de América bus station in Madrid. You can use disposable, weekly, or 10-trip tickets. Bus 114 does NOT go to the airport terminals and is a 40-minute walk to Terminal 1. 

Public night bus N4 goes from Plaza Cibeles to Barajas district, a 400m walk from the terminal through a passageway over the highway. Best to get off at the second-last stop, Avenida General, and then make a right turn immediately after the bus stop. Go straight on, keep going straight crossing the parking lot, and then make a left to cross another huge parking lot. After that, you see the road and the pedestrian highway overpass. The disposable or the 10-trip ticket is valid.

From the Airport it is also possible to take a taxi. Journeys between the airport and the inner M30 area (city center), or vice versa, including those reserved electronically, are subject to a flat rate.

* <listing name="Renfe" alt="" directions="" lat="" long="" address="" phone="+34 902-240-202" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="http://www.renfe.com/EN/viajeros/index.html" hours="" price="">A train service operates to/from Madrid. Frequent trains operate between Madrid and [[Barcelona]] (2h 40min), [[Seville]] (2h 20 min), [[Malaga]] (2h 30 min), [[Zaragoza]], [[Tarragona]], [[Lleida]], [[Huesca]], [[Ciudad Real]], Puertollano, [[Lisbon]], [[Milan]], the French coast, [[Paris]], with continuing journeys to most of [[Europe]].</listing>
Madrid has two train stations: Chamartín and Atocha, both of which have excellent Metro and Cercanias commuter train connections. Most northbound and international trains arrive and depart from Chamartín station, while trains to [[Barcelona]], [[Valencia (City)|Valencia]] and southern [[Spain]] depart from Atocha. If you need to get between the two stations, Metro line 1 (30-40 minutes) or Cercanias lines C3 and C4 (15 minutes) offer the most direct connection.

'''Chamartín''' station is on the north side of the city and is served by the Metro stop of the same name on Metro lines 1 and 10. 

'''Atocha''' is on the southern side of the city center and is divided into two main sections, an area for Cercanias trains and one for long-distance trains. The long-distance side is set inside the towering old station, where you will find a tropical garden with a pond full of small turtles as well as a number of shops. A memorial to the victims of the terrorist attack is in the Cercanias portion of the station near the Metro stop.

===By bus===
Madrid has eight enormous international and intercity bus stations. Information on where buses to a particular destination depart from can be found at the Tourist Office.

Many of the international buses, and those headed south of Madrid, arrive at and depart from '''Estación Sur de Autobuses''', Calle de Méndez Álvaro, Tel.+34 91-468-4200, [http://www.estacionautobusesmadrid.com] which is accessible by metro. 

Buses to and from [[Barcelona]] and [[Bilbao]] operate from the '''Avenida de América bus terminal''', also accessible by Metro.

===By car===
There are car rental facilities available at the airport, train stations, and other main travel sites. Always be sure to have a street map handy! The roads within Madrid are difficult to navigate as there are no places to stop so it's very handy to look at a map or check your route.

Also, if you are relying on GPS navigation, be aware that there are several consecutive junctions underground near the center and your GPS may not get a signal underground. Plan your turns before you enter the tunnels.

Madrid city is well covered by the main global car rental companies, such as Avis, Budget, Hertz, Thrifty & Europcar, some of these also provide Rent to Buy Facilities. All car rental companies offer competitive pricing for economy-class vehicles and unlimited mileage options. Some local car rental companies may also offer competitive pricing.

Parking within the city follows the pay-and-display system, daily from 9am to 9pm (limited on Saturdays, and all of August, to 9am to 15pm, and being free on Sundays).

==Get around==
===By public transit===
Madrid has one of the best public transport networks in the world and the second largest metro network in Europe, second only to London's. Buses and subways form an integrated network and work with the same ticket. Alternatively, you can buy unlimited travel passes as follows: 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 5 days, or 7 days. Children under the age of 4 may travel without a ticket. Children under 11 receive a 50% discount. Tickets can be purchased at Metro stations, newsstands, and ''estancos'' (tobacconists').

====Train====
Madrid has a system of local trains ''Cercanías'' that connect outlying suburbs and villages with the city center. Although most useful for visiting historic or outdoor destinations outside the city core, they are also useful for quickly getting from the north end of the city (Chamartin and Nuevos Ministerios) to the south end of the city (Sol and Atocha) and, Barajas airport (terminal 4).

====Metro====
[[Image:Madrid Metro Map.svg|thumb|300px|Tourist map of the Madrid Metro]]
The '''Metro de Madrid''' [http://www.metromadrid.es/] (Madrid's Subway/Underground) is one of the better and less expensive metros in Europe. It is an underground railway network that covers practically the entire metropolitan area and airport. In addition, the underground tunnels of the Metro provide relief from the sun on hot days. Ticket machines are multilingual with instructions in Spanish, English, French, and German. 

The '''Tourist Card''' is the most practical ticket for visitors, valid for all the public transportation system (metro + buses + trains) for 1, 2, 3, 5, or 7 calendar days and 2 zones: A and T. Prices depend upon the selection and validity. It is an electronic contactless card and can be purchased from ticket machines at all Metro stations, including the airport. Credit cards are accepted, but if your card doesn’t work even with a PIN, the airport metro has a counter which sells this card and has a credit card terminal.

When you travel to or from airport stations, there is an additional supplement, which can be paid at the entrance or exit. The Passes or Tourist Card do not require this supplement - it is included in the price. You can catch some trains as late as 2:00AM, although the official closing time for the metro system is at 1:30AM.

Announcements in the metro are made in both Spanish and English on most major lines, including the line to and from the airport. Along with this, almost all metro stops have a map of the exits and the surrounding area above the station.
However, most stations don't have a map of the Metro lines on the platform so prepare for your travel in advance and don't expect to plan your journey on the go.

====Bus====
Whatever the Metro doesn't cover, the buses do. Night buses (''Búhos'', "night owls"), have their main hub at ''Plaza de Cibeles'', covering most of the city at roughly 20-minute intervals. Buses are equipped with a free wi-fi facility (EMTmadrid), easy to use with any type of laptop or netbook.

===By taxi===
Taxis can be hard to find during late hours on weekends, especially if there is some rain. Unlike in other European cities, there are few taxi stands. Just stand by the side of a major road or bus stop and wave your hand to signal an available taxi passing by. Available taxis have a green ''libre'' sign on the windshield and a green light on top. 

Official taxis are white and have a red stripe and the flag of Madrid on the front door. The tariff is displayed on top of the car (a ''1'' during the daytime, a ''2'' during the night, which becomes 2 and 3 on holidays such as Christmas Eve). 

There are also special surcharges for entering or leaving the airport/train station. Ask for the written table of tariffs and charges (''suplementos'') (shown on small stickers on rear windows, compulsory by law) before paying if you think it's too expensive. 

Be aware there are some taxi drivers that will do what is called 'la vuelta al ruedo' which basically means they will drive you around or through the crowded avenues to increase the fare.

Most taxi drivers do not speak English, so you should have the names and/or addresses of your destinations written in Spanish to show your taxi driver. Likewise, get your hotel's business card in case you get lost.

===By car===
Transportation by private automobile in Madrid can be a nightmare. The Spanish capital suffers from the typical problems of most big cities; far too many cars and not enough space to accommodate them. Sometimes there can even be traffic jams in the ''Paseo de la Castellana'' at 3:00 AM (early to some Madrileños). The problem is compounded by the narrow streets in the old town, where a lorry delivering beer barrels to a local bar can cause a huge tailback. Finding a parking space can be very time-consuming, and difficult if one is not skilled in the art of close proximity parallel parking. Many Spaniards are also lacking in this art, prompting them to simply park in the street, blocking other cars in. If you find yourself blocked in by such a practice, honk your horn until the driver returns. If you parallel park your car in Madrid, be aware that most Madrileños park by sound alone. They will feel no remorse for repeatedly hitting the car in front and behind them while trying to get into or out of a tight spot. If you value your car's paint job, or you have rented a car, it may be best to park underground. Though this is no guarantee for nobody hitting your car, the chances are somewhat diminished.

In short, renting a car is not only unnecessary, but not recommended for getting around downtown Madrid, and a car is likely to be more of a liability than an asset. Visitors should make use of Madrid's excellent public transportation instead. Renting a car only makes sense if you are planning to leave Madrid and drive to the nearby towns.

===By bicycle===
[[Image:ElRetiro.jpg|thumb|300px|El Retiro]]
Although Madrid does not appear as a bike-friendly city at a first sight, things are changing slowly to make the bike experience more comfortable. Several streets in the historical downtown have been transformed into mixed-traffic spaces where pedestrians and bikes have priority over cars. There are new easy-bike paths all along the river and connecting important parks. 

It is also possible to use a lot of narrow easy streets where traffic is slow and calm to travel along the city without depending on exclusive bike paths. There are some official and unofficial publications on these streets along the web[http://www.infobicimadrid.es/gis_bicis.htm].

To avoid some of Madrid's inconveniencies, such as hot weather or slopy streets it is also possible to get bikes on Metro and Railways trains with some schedule restrictions, and on every public transport without restrictions when using folding-bikes.

There is a public rent-a-bike service Bicimad[http://www.bicimad.com/]. There are also some rental shops in the historical center area such as the company Baja Bikes[http://www.bajabikes.eu/en/bike-tours-madrid] and Urban Zero[http://www.urban-zero.com/]. These companies offer several rental points in Madrid (Retiro, Atocha, Madrid-Río, etc.). They offer Guided and self-guided bicycle tours, using electric or conventional bicycles.

===By segway ===
Madrid is relatively flat, so it's easily to move by bicycle, skateboard, rollerblade. Book a segway tour in Madrid[https://www.segwaytour.com/] or rent one and move through the city without walking. It's secure. If you want to know more about the different sights, what to do, where to eat or hang out you should go with a guide.

==Talk==
While knowledge of the English language is increasing among the younger generations, the majority of Madrid's residents know only a few words — even employees at American businesses such as McDonald's, KFC, or Burger King, and employees at cash exchange centers rarely speak much English. You can often find someone with a fair grasp of English at larger hotels and tourism sites, but it would nevertheless be helpful to know at least a few common [[Spanish phrasebook|Spanish words and phrases]].

Though it is the official residence of the King of Spain, the royal family does not actually reside here and it is generally used only for state ceremonies. The Royal Palace is considered to be one of the most iconic and beautiful buildings in Madrid, not only for its location (overlooking the river valley) but also for its architecture and the artistic treasures to be found in the rooms. A simple one-way tour of the palace (both self-guided and guided are available) takes you up the grand stairway and through the lavishly decorated state rooms with their elegant tapestries, frescoes, porcelain, carvings and added decor like china, silverware, medals, etc. From the courtyard, you can access the ''Farmacia'' (Pharmacy), which contains hundreds of bottles of early medicines and a reconstructed laboratory, and the ''Real Armorial'' (Royal Armory), a two-story collection of medieval weapons and armor. Explanations in the armory are in Spanish only, so do not expect to understand much unless your know the Spanish names for all that medieval weaponry.

This is Madrid's museum district, named for the three major art museums clustered along Paseo del Prado east of the old city: the Museo del Prado, one of the finest art museums in the world, the Thyssen-Bornemisza, a baron's collection of classical art, and the Reina Sofia Madrid's modern art museum.

Real Madrid is the most successful football club in Spain and Europe, having been crowned Spanish champions a record 32 times and European champions a record 13 times. Their biggest rivals by far are FC Barcelona, with which it contests matches known popularly as ''El Clásico'' at least twice a year. The rivalry between the two sides is by far the biggest in Spain and one of the most intense in the world and stems from the longstanding traditional rivalry between the Spanish and Catalan-speaking parts of Spain. As such, tickets for such matches often sell out very quickly. In case you arrive in Madrid on non-match periods, you can take a self-guided tour of the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium. It includes tours around the field, the dressing rooms, the Press Room, and the Real Madrid Museum where the trophies and other memorabilia are kept. However, a few days before a match, the chances are you will not be able to take the full tour, but only a part of it, with at least the Real Madrid Museum, at a reduced price.</do>

* ''Cocido Madrileño'' - Chickpea stew with meat and vegetables. The particularity of this stew is the way it is served. The soup, chickpeas and meat are served and eaten separately. 
* ''Gallinejas'' and ''Entresijos'' - Portions from different parts of lamb fried in its fat. Very traditional and typical of Madrid city.
* ''Oreja de Cerdo'' - Pigs ears, fried with garlic. This popular dish is widely eaten throughout central Spain.
* ''Sopa de Ajo'' - Garlic soup is a rich oily soup that generally includes paprika, grated Spanish ham, fried bread, and a poached egg. A variation of this soup is known as ''Sopa Castellana''.

It is ironic that Madrid, located right in the center of Spain has higher-quality seafood than most coastal regions. This quality comes at a price, and most Spaniards only occasionally shell out for a ''mariscada'' (Spanish for "seafood feast"). So, tasting Madrid's seafood can be an experience that will be worth the cost for the visitor.

Meat and meat products (Jamon Iberico, morcilla, chorizo, etc.) are of generally a very high quality in [[Spain#Specialties to buy|Spain]] and particularly in Madrid.

===Restaurants===
Many of the restaurants and ''cervecerías'' (breweries) in the Sol and Plaza Mayor area have "generic" poster board advertisements on the sidewalks with pictures advertising various paella dishes. These paellas are usually of bad quality and should be avoided. If you are looking for good, authentic Spanish paella, it is usually best to find a more expensive, "sit-down" type of restaurant that offers a variety of paella dishes. 

A much better option is the La Latina neighborhood just south of Plaza Mayor, especially along Cava Baja street. To enjoy a '''gastronomic tour''' of this area you can join the Old Madrid Tapas & Wine Tour [http://www.walksofspain.com/]. There are also a number of deli-like shops along Calle Arenal that offer food ''para llevar'' (for takeaway).

At bars, one generally orders various sized plates, a ''ración'' meaning a full dish, a ''media ración'' a half dish or a smaller version which would be a ''tapa'', a ''pinxto'' or a ''pincho''.

The Spaniards don't eat lunch until 2 or 3 pm, and dinner doesn't start until 9 or 10 pm. As a rule of thumb, restaurants serve lunch from 1PM (earlier in touristic zones) until 3:30PM, then close and reopen for dinner at 8:00PM, serving until 11:00PM. This schedule is usually for restaurants since the bars and "mesones" are usually open all day long offering a wide variety of "tapas" and "bocadillos"(rolls) for a low price. If you're really desperate, the standard bunch of fast food chains does stay open throughout the day.

==Stay safe==
Madrid is a relatively safe city. The police are visible, and the city is equipped with cameras. There are always a lot of people in the streets, even at night time, so you can walk across the city generally without fear. Travelers who remain aware of their surroundings, and keep an eye on their belongings should have little to worry about.

Madrid has a significant amount of nonviolent [[pickpockets|pickpocket]] crime so always watch any bags you have with you especially on the Metro and in busier public spaces. It is important for your safety to avoid falling asleep in the metro, which can leave you particularly vulnerable to thefts. It is not unknown for thieves to cut jean trouser pockets in order to steal belongings. 

Be careful when carrying luggage, especially if anyone approaches you with an outspread map in hand asking for directions. It's entirely possible that this is a trap to distract you while an accomplice steals your luggage.

When using ATM machines, be aware of your surroundings, just as you would be anywhere. Bring a friend if you need to withdraw cash after dark. 

Beware of thieves preying on people leaving nightclubs who have had a lot to drink. Do NOT carry valuables on a night out.

Be aware of young men and boys who are indicating they are deaf or homeless and trying to get you to sign a piece of paper. This also can be a ruse to distract you in order to steal your belongings. These thieves sometimes enter cafes/bars so make sure you do not leave wallets or phones on the table as possessions on show make for easy targets. The area around Calle de las Infantes near Gran Via is particularly renowned for this.  

Avoid people offering masaje (massages). Be firm and say "No me toques" (Don't touch me) or "No tengo dinero" (I don't have any money) and keep walking. This is often a scam to extort money.

Coffee shops such as Starbucks are typically full of locals and tourists playing with mobile phones, laptops, and tablets. Groups of gypsy kids are often seen raiding such establishments - they favor branches with two exits and run from one to the other, grabbing whatever they can. Control yourself and hold onto your belongings if something is suspicious.

Street drinking (Botellón) is a very popular and cheap night out. However, be careful as drinking in the street is against the law and the police can and will fine you.
