[[Image:Zhujiang_new_town.jpg|thumb|325px|The new Guangzhou skyline with the Canton Tower and Zhujiang New Town]]

'''Guangzhou''' or '''Canton''' (广州) , the capital of [[Guangdong|Guangdong Province]], is the third largest city in China after Beijing and Shanghai with a population of more than 12 million. Founded in 214 BC, the city has been a springboard for trading, cultural exchanges, many revolutions and reforms, making it an unavoidable stopover to understand what shapes the modern China.

==Understand==
[[Image:Guangzhou in China.png|right|noframe|240px|Location of Guangzhou in China]]

Guangzhou's isolation from the rest of 'typical China' by mountainous topography and early exposure to the outside world has resulted in its unique way of lifestyle, liberal ideas, distinctive cuisine and tremendous wealth. It is no surprise that Guangzhou is a cradle of many reforms and revolutions that changed the fate of China forever. Today Guangzhou still unveils many republic-era sights that help travelers understand modern Chinese history.

Founded in 214 BC, this capital of the richest province is always a mix of new and old. It not only boasts some of the oldest temples in China, a millenarian-old park, an imperial tomb of a southern kingdom and complete preservation of colonial villas and church on Shamian, but it also serves as a showcase of futuristic architectures and autopilot metro on Zhujiang New Town. 

Despite its vibrant sight-seeing resources, travelers usually come to Guangzhou to shop and eat. Guangzhou accommodates countless huge markets specializing in almost any made-in-china products, including Chinese tea, herbs, garments, watches, electronics and toys. You will be appalled to see the real prices of those China-made products and the profit your local shops earn by selling them. 

Food is the centerpiece of life and Guangzhou has the country's largest number of restaurants per capita, which is the birthplace of what you call 'Chinese food' (Cantonese food) in the west. Here you can grab the authentic taste of sweet & sour pork, wonton soup and dim-sum. Few travelers can leave the city hungry. 

As busy as it sounds, you can easily escape the crowd. Just head to surrounding villages, in which some of them date back to the Song Dynasty (960-1279AD). Bird watching in Nansha Wetland, a 200-hectare stopover for migrant birds from as far as Seriba, can easily make for a peaceful day.  

===Districts===
[[Image:Guangzhou_map.png|thumb|350px|Layout of Guangzhou]]

Guangzhou is divided into ten districts. Among them, Yuexiu and Liwan, the cradle for the Cantonese culture, has been the city center since the imperial era. Tianhe, which was a farming village decades ago, has been constructed into a new business center with some biggest shopping malls and highest skyscrapers in the city. 

For travelers, the most useful road is Zhongshan Road, a 9 KM long highway horizontally cutting through the downtown of Guangzhou. The highway is divided into 8 sections. From Zhongshan 6 Road (中山六路）to Zhongshan 8 Road (中山八路) it covers around 80% tourist attractions and all famous restaurants. This area is well connected by Metro Line 1 from Changshou Lu (長壽路), Chen Clan Academy (陈家祠), Ximenkou(西门口） to Gongyuanqian (公园前).

'''City Center'''
*'''Yuexiu''' (越秀 ''Yuèxiù'') &mdash; The Zhongshan 6 Road area, which covers the original area of Yuexiu before its expansion in the 2005, has been the very core since 214 AD. Highlights include Yuexiu Park, Guangzhou Museum located at Zhanhai Tower, Orchid Garden, Mausoleum of Nanyue King, Guangxiao Temple, Temple of Six Banyan Trees, Huangsheng Mosque, Beijing Lu Shopping District, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hall, Temple of Five Rams, Shishi Cathedral.

*'''Liwan''' (荔湾 ''Lìwān'') &mdash; On the north of the pearl river makes up the old Guangzhou area and home to the standard Cantonese accent (Xiguan Accent, literally West Gate Accent).  Tourist highlights include the colonial Shamian Island, Xiguan Old Houses, Xiangxiajiu shopping Street, Liziwan Lake Park and Chen's Clan Academy. 
*'''Tianhe''' (天河 ''Tiānhé'')  is the business district, thriving with many skyscrapers and shopping malls. The newly developed Zhujiang New Town (珠江新城) is a showcase of futuristic urban planning and avant-garde architecture. It is also home to the oldest messy urban village Shipai as well as most expat communities. The district serves as a transportation hub for trains to Hong Kong. Highlights include Guangdong Museum, Central Library,  Opera House and Shipai village. 

'''Around the Center'''
*'''Haizhu''' (海珠'Hǎizhū') &mdash; At the south of the Pearl River, the former industrial district has transformed into more residential and business today. It is home to the city's latest landmark Canton Tower and the South Campus of Sun Yat-Sen University, which is a well-preserved historic building complex of the 1920s. Traders come here often for the Canton Fair in Pazhou.
*'''Panyu''' (番禺 ''Pānyú'') is an area getting more popular among local tourists. Its Lianhua Mountain boosts 100,000 blooming lotus flower and sits a huge Bodhisattva Guanyin statue. Various theme parks have attracted thousands of tourists. The area is covered by many historic villages and towns that give you a peek into the life of traditional Southern Chinese.

*'''[[Conghua]]''' (从化 ''Cónghuà'') is popular among tourists for its hot springs and Tianhe (Heavenly Lake) Recreation area.

===History=== 
Formerly known as '''Canton''' in the West, the city of Guangzhou has a history dating back roughly 2,200 years.

[[Image:FiveRams.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The symbol of Guangzhou -- the five Rams]]A legend tells of five celestial beings riding into the area that is now Guangzhou on five rams carrying sheaves of rice. The celestials bestowed blessings on the land and offered the sheaves to the people of the city as a symbol of prosperity and abundance. After the celestials left, the rams turned into stone, and Guangzhou quickly developed into an affluent and influential city. Due to this legend, Guangzhou has gained several popular nicknames: ''Yangcheng'' (羊城; City of Rams), ''Suicheng'' (穗城; Sheaves of Rice City) and ''Wuyangcheng'' (五羊城; City of Five Rams). In addition, due to the abundance of flowers along the city's main thoroughfares, Guangzhou is often referred to as ''Huacheng'' (花城; City of Flowers).

According to historical records, the city was built in 214BC and was known as '''Panyu''' (番禺). The name Guangzhou actually referred to the prefecture in which Panyu was located. As the city grew, the name Guangzhou was adopted for the city itself.

As a major sea port, Guangzhou's history is full of color. In 786 the city was sacked by the Persians and in 1711 the British East India Company established a trading post here. In 1757, the government designated the city as the only port allowed business transactions with foreign nations. This continued until 1842, the signing of the Treaty of Nanking, when four other ports were added. Losing the exclusive privilege pushed Guangzhou to become more industrialized later.

Guangzhou was also part of the so called "Maritime Silk Road" that linked southern China with India, South-East Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. As a result of its links with the Middle East, a mosque was established in the city in 627, and a small Muslim community continues to live in Guangzhou to this day. Additionally, the sixth patriarch of Zen Buddhism was born in Guangzhou and taught the famous Platform Sutra in the city. As a result, Guangzhou has retained a strong connection with this school of Buddhism, and the monastery where the sixth patriarch studied is considered a local treasure. The first Protestant missionary in China, Robert Morrison, entered Guangzhou in 1807.

===Climate===
Guangzhou has a humid subtropical climate, influenced by the East Asian Monsoon, with plenty of rainfall throughout the year, measuring 1.736mm on average. Extremes have ranged from 0°C (32°F) to 39°C (102°F). Winters are mild with the average temperature in January being 13.9°C (57°F). Cold weather is virtually unknown in Guanghzou since the cold air masses originating in [[Siberia]] don't make it this far south and are blocked by the mountains in the north. Small portions of them however, may manage to penetrate through the mountains and reach the city, pushing low temperatures down to 5°C (41°F), but very rarely below, although due to the strong cold winds and humid weather, it does feel very chilly, while Snowfall is extremely rare, with the last occurence being in 24th January 2016, 87 years after the previous one. Summers, like the rest of southern [[China]] are hot and very humid. The heat is sweltering, due to the fact that the average high temperature in July is 32°C (90°F) and the average humidity is 82%, making the atmosphere very unpleasant. Daytime highs may surpass 35°C (95°F) up on occasion. October and November are inarguably the best months to visit Guanghzou and most of rain falls between April and September.

==Get in==

===By plane===
'''Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport''' (广州白云国际机场, {{IATA|CAN}}, {{ICAO|ZGGG}}, [http://www.baiyunairport.com]) is a major hub in Southern China, second only to [[Hong Kong]]. The airport is the base for China Southern Airlines [http://www.csair.com/en] and has an extensive range of domestic flights including: [[Beijing]], [[Changchun]], [[Changsha]], [[Chengdu]], [[Chongqing]], [[Dalian]], [[Daxian]], [[Guiyang]], [[Guilin]], [[Hangzhou]], [[Harbin]], [[Haikou]], [[Hefei]], [[Hohhot]], [[Jinan]], [[Jiuzhaigou]], [[Kunming]], [[Luzhou]], [[Nanchang]], [[Nanjing]], [[Nanning]], [[Qingdao]], [[Sanya]], [[Shantou]], [[Shanghai]], [[Shenyang]], [[Shenzhen]], [[Shijiazhuang]], [[Taizhou]], [[Tianjin]], [[Urumqi]], [[Wanxian]], [[Wuhan]], [[Wuxi]], [[Xi'an]], [[Yibin]], [[Yichang]], [[Yiwu]], [[Yuncheng]], [[Zhengzhou]], and [[Zhuhai]]. Direct international routes include [[Adelaide]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Auckland]], [[Bangkok]], [[Brisbane]], [[Busan]], [[Cairns]], [[Doha]], [[Dubai]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Fukuoka]], [[Hanoi]], [[Ho Chi Minh City]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Istanbul]], [[Jakarta]], [[Kathmandu]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[London]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Macau]], [[Manila]], [[Melbourne]], [[Moscow]], [[Mumbai]], [[Nairobi]], [[New York City]], [[Paris]], [[Perth]], [[San Francisco]], [[Seoul]], [[Singapore]], [[Sydney]], [[Taipei]], [[Tel-Aviv]], [[Tokyo]] and [[Vancouver]].

Foreign nationals from 51 countries who transit through Guangzhou Airport when flying between two different countries (for example, London-Guangzhou-Auckland) qualify for a '''72-hour visa-free stopover'''. For the purpose of the policy, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan are treated as international flights (for example, London-Guangzhou-Taipei would qualify). The name of the policy is a bit of a misnomer, as the 72 hour period actually begins at 00:01 after the day of arrival (for example, if you arrive in Guangzhou Airport at 09:00 on 1 January, you can stay until 23:59 on 4 January). During the 72 hour visa-free stopover, you are allowed to move freely within the whole of [[Guangdong]] Province, but you must fly into and fly out of Guangzhou Airport. For details, visit the [http://www.gdcrj.com/bszn/wgrcrj/wgrlhgl/mqzc/201308/t20130802_27060.htm FAQs webpage (in English)] of the official government website of the Guangdong Province Division of Exit & Entry Administration.

Warning: Immigration at Guangzhou has denied 72-hour visa-free stopovers for those with Turkish stamps in their passport. Those with less than 8 hours between flights are also regularly denied entry - despite rules to the contrary. If you plan on enjoying an extended stay in Guangzhou under the visa-free system you are taking a risk.

If you are flying on China Southern Airlines and have a stopover in Guangzhou, you may qualify for complimentary hotel accommodation. For details, visit the [http://www.csair.com/cn/czadscale/2015/20150603/20160927.html?WT.inner_id=gzfs150603en China Southern website].

The food in the international transfer terminal is very expensive. You can pay US$10 plus for a cup of tea! It is recommended to bring everything you will need for your layover. There is a free hot water machine downstairs, next to one of the smoking lounges. If you bring a mug, and some tea bags, you will be good to go for hours.

The airport is 28 km (17 mi) north from central Guangzhou. The most convenient way into the city is by Metro Line 3. The lower level of the airport terminal leads to the Airport South Metro station. A journey to the East Railway Station, or to Tiyu Xilu Metro station (both ¥12) takes about 50 minutes. Trains run every seven minutes, with the first train leaving the airport at 6AM and the last train from and to the airport departing at 11PM.

Taxis are also available and take about the same time as the Metro. A taxi ride to central Guangzhou will cost about ¥120, inclusive of a ¥15 toll fee. Taxi stations are available outside Arrival Hall Section A Gate 5 and Arrival Hall Section B Gate 6. If you arrive after midnight when the metro has stopped running, be prepared for a real long wait in line for taxis. Waiting times can start from 45 mins, not because of the lack of taxis, but because of the sheer number of arrivees. Also, do not be surprised that the queue is not really an orderly queue, which is quintessentially chinese. Some parts it's 2 people, some parts it's 4, and towards the front it can spread out to 8 in a row. People will attempt to out squeeze you to the back at every opportunity possible. You may find yourself 10 spaces behind the person who started right behind you.

[[Image:RuralGuangzhou.JPG|thumb|350px|Seeing rural Guangzhou from an Airport Express bus.]] Airport Express buses operate just outside the arrival terminal, but are a distant second to the metro in reliability and comfort. If you have more than one piece of luggage or if a line has a stop at your hotel, this may be your top choice. Line 1 (¥16) departs every 10-15 minutes from 7AM until the last flight and takes 45 minutes to reach the Guangzhou Railway Station and Central Hotel. The ticket prices range from ¥10-55. Lines 1 to 6 are traveling within the metropolitan area, while lines 7-11 go to outer districts. There are also direct Airport Express buses to some cities in the [[Pearl River Delta|Pearl River Delta region]], such as [[Zhuhai]] and [[Foshan]]. However, there is no direct bus to Macau or Hong Kong.

Do not accept solicitations for rides to the city. Sometimes, people will stand at the arrival area and ask if you need a taxi. These are illegally operated and use unmarked vehicles, or charge you a fee, offer you a phony receipt, and then arrange a taxi that will still charge you. They usually cost a lot more than licensed taxis since many travelers do not know the cost of airport transportation.

Flying to/from '''Hong Kong International Airport''' ({{IATA|HKG}}) is another option. From Hong Kong International Airport, you can take cross-boundary coach to Guangzhou and other cities in Guangdong. Service providers include China Travel Service, Trans-Island Chinalink and Eternal East. Fares range from HK$220-250 one way.

Trains cover the 182 kilometers from [[Hong Kong]] in about two hours, including a stop at Dongguan. Through Trains to '''Guangzhou East Railway Station''' depart from Hong Kong at Hung Hom railway station in Kowloon and arrive in Guangzhou at the East station. Through train services are operated by Hong Kong MTR. [http://www.it3.mtr.com.hk/b2c/frmIndex.asp?strLang=Eng]. The one-way journey price ranges from 190HKD-230HKD. 

'''Note:''' Tickets purchased on it3.mtr.com.hk must be paid for by credit card and collected in Hong Kong by the card holder. If you intend to begin your journey from Guangzhou, most times of the year you can obtain tickets on the spot at Guangzhou East Railway station. However, at peak season, you will want to book ahead to have a reserved seat. Booking (and paying for) tickets through the MTR website will only RESERVE your seats if you are outside Hong Kong and intend to begin your journey in Guangzhou. You will need to pay again at Guangzhou East station and then seek a refund from MTR once you arrive in Hung Hom. To avoid this, MTR has an officially appointed ticketing agency on the China side for multilingual inquiry and booking.This company has been confirmed by MTR customer service and is: Norrway Trading Co. Ltd. (+86) 20 8765 9328, from within China 020 8765 9328 (no known website). Alternatively, [http://www.cits.net China International Travel Service] has non-real time inquiry and booking service in English. There are a number of other avenues (Chinese travel agents) for inquiring and booking GZ-HK MTR tickets, but they are in Chinese (e.g., www.020ztc.com), who have an office on the first floor of Guangzhou East station. Many of the better quality hotels in Guangzhou will also have an affiliated travel agents where you can book and pay for train tickets, so contact them as well. Reservation for Guangzhou-Kowloon trains usually opens 28 to 30 days before departure.

It is cheaper to take the Guangzhou-Shenzhen intercity train service (广深城际列车) from [[Shenzhen]] to Guangzhou East Railway Station. Some trips also stop at Guangzhou Railway Station. Shenzhen is right across the border from Hong Kong and thousands of people walk over the bridge between the two every day through Luohu (罗湖), or spelled as Lo Wu from the Hong Kong side of the border. Tickets can be bought at the Shenzhen Rail Station in Luohu. The one-way journey price starts from ¥80.

A project is underway to link the entire Pearl River Delta area with high speed rail network. The Guangzhou–[[Zhuhai]] (near Macau), Guangzhou–[[Shenzhen]] High Speed Rail (a different railway, originating from Shenzhen North Station and terminating in Guangzhou South Station, than the Guangzhou-Shenzhen intercity train mentioned above) have opened in 2011, and the journey takes just 57 minutes and 35 minutes respectively. A new long distance line from Guangzhou to Beijing travels through major cities such as [[Changsha]], [[Wuhan]], [[Zhengzhou]] and [[Shijiazhuang]]. It takes 7h59m to 9h38m for a journey to Beijing, over 2,000 km away. One way ticket is ¥865. There are also overnight soft sleeper bullet trains for ¥990 on most days of the week. Some high-speed trains also go to Luoyang and Xi'an. One way trip from Guangzhou South Station to Xi'an North is between 7h40m and 9h09m, price from ¥813.5. This is part of a nationwide [[High-speed rail in China|high-speed]] network. The above mentioned destination are also accessible by much slower non-high-speed sleeper train from Guangzhou Station in the center of the town.

It is easy to go to [[Guilin]] and [[Yangshuo]] by bullet train before moving on to rest of China. It will take 2h31m to 3h8m  and costs ¥137.5. Guilin is also accessible by non-high-speed sleeper train from Guangzhou Station right in the center of the town, which takes about 11 hours.

It is possible to take a direct train from Guangzhou to [[Lhasa]] in [[Tibet]]. The 4,980 km journey takes 55 hours and runs every other day from Guangzhou Station (广州站). A sleeper costs ¥869 and up. For discussion see [[Overland to Tibet]].

For reservation on all the train tickets except tickets to Hong Kong, Chinese Railway do have a online ticketing website and smart-phone app, but it's all in Chinese and only accepts Chinese debit or credit card. For English speaker with no access to a Chinese bank account, follow the tips on [http://www.seat61.com/China.htm#How%20to%20buy%20tickets seat61.com], which gives very thorough instruction on how to buy train tickets from major reputable online travel agencies.

Bear in mind there are now three major train stations in Guangzhou. Countless travelers have gone to the wrong station and missed their scheduled trips, so be sure of your departing station, which is specified on the ticket. 
* '''Guangzhou Railway Station''' (广州站) is one of the biggest in the country and services non-high-speed routes that go all the way to [[Harbin]]. Metro lines 2 and 5 have a connection stop here.
* '''Guangzhou East Railway Station''' (广州东站) services non-high-speed routes to Hong Kong and some other mainland cities. Metro line 1 ends here, and Metro line 3 from Airport South has a station here.
* '''Guangzhou South Railway Station''' (广州南站) serves ONLY the high-speed rail network.
Guangzhou also has several other stations such as the North Station and West Station. There are also different names for each of the stations. Be sure to use official names to avoid confusion.

Although some signs are available in English, most of the staffs do not really understand and speak English, except at the Guangzhou-Kowloon ticket counter, in which staffs are generally able to communicate in simple English. Bring a phrasebook or a Chinese friend if you're planning on traveling deeper into China.

There used to be frequent ferry services from other cities in the Pearl River Delta, as well as some cities in Guangxi and along the coast, for example, Xiamen, Haikou or Shanghai. But nowadays, along the construction of extensive highway, water transportation no longer have its value as they used to. There is currently no ferry terminals in downtown. The two major ferry terminals are Lianhuashan Port Ferry Terminal (莲花山客运港) in Panyu District and Nansha Port Ferry Terminal (南沙客运港) in Nansha District.

Lianhuashan Port Ferry Terminal (莲花山客运港) in Panyu has ferry service to two locations in Hong Kong: Kowloon (China Ferry Terminal or China HK City, both refer to the same terminal in Hong Kong) and Hong Kong Intl Airport Sky Pier.

[[Image:Guangzhou_east.png|thumb|Eastern central Guangzhou in detail (east Yuexiu and Tianhe)]]
Public transportation system is comprehensive in Guangzhou like most other big Chinese cities.  If you stay in Guangzhou for long time, purchase a multi-purpose '''Ling Nan Tong - Yang Cheng Tong''' (岭南通-羊城通) stored value card, which can be used to pay fares in metro, bus and ferries and used for many convenience stores, public phones and vending machines.  

However, to return the card at the end of the trip, you need to go Gongyuanqian (Exit J) and Tiyu Xi Exit G, and East Railway Station. (Exit HJ). It may be worth simply keeping the card as a souvenir. 

===On foot===
Despite the sheer size of the city, walking is a great way of exploring the traditional Liwan and Yuexiu districts. The easy tour is to walk through Zhongshan 6 Road (中山六路, Zhongshan Liulu) which covers most tourist attractions including Liurong Temple, Guangxiao Temple, Huaisheng Mosque and many huge markets. It also has the two most popular pedestrian streets , Beijing Lu and Shang-xia-jiu for shopping mania. 

To give you some sense of direction whenever you get lost, figure out the location of two major horizontal lines, which are Zhongshan Road and the Pearl River (Zhu Jiang) , you will easily tell every direction. This area is also well connected by Metro Line 1 and Trolleybus 104, 107, 109 and 78(Night Bus) which is the only trackless tram system in South China.

===By bicycle===
Bicycles are promoted as a low-carbon mode of transportation. Over 100 rental outlets are now available along many BRT lines and subway stations. The rental fee is by the hour and up to ¥30 a day. One popular bike route is along the Pearl River on the Haizhu District side. Other dedicated bike lanes are slowly appearing in the city center, including Tianhe District. Yangchengtong Card is accepted in many public rental outlets.

New bikes are available in major hypermarkets from ¥500 for a reasonable cheap single-speed to around ¥2000-3000 for a 21-speed mountain bike. Giant and Merida are the two most common international brands. High-end bicycles are also available to affluent customers in this rich city.

You will see brightly colored shared bikes almost anywhere nowadays. In order to rent these, you must create an account with their respective APPs, including passport number and WeChat/AliPay/Chinese bank card. The most popular in Guangzhou are Mobike, Ofo, Bluegogo, and Xiaoming. After paying a deposit between ¥50-200, each half hour is generally ¥0.5-¥1.

Folding bikes are permitted on the subway (sometimes not on buses) and tax, but non-folders are not permitted on any form of public transport other than the cross-river ferries. Bicycles are not permitted to cross the river via the Zhujiang Tunnel or Zhujiang suspension bridge, but are permitted to go on the public ferries for ¥1 (see below).

[[Image:Guangzhou_Metro_Map.png|thumb|Guangzhou Metro]]

Opened in 1999, the ever-growing Guangzhou '''Metro system'''[http://www.gzmtr.com/en/] covers much of the city center. The fare ranges from ¥2 to ¥12. Most of the signs and announcements are in Chinese and English. 

If you stay in Guangzhou for extended period, think of getting a Yang Cheng Tong transportation cards (see details above). Card holders can get 40% off on any rides since the 16th uses in every month. 

There are currently 8 lines in operation:-

====Central Lines====
'''Line 1''' is the most useful for tourists, horizontally cutting through the center of Guangzhou. Five major stations Huangsha, Changshuo Lu, Chen Clan's Academy, Ximenkou, Gongyuanqian cover up to 80% tourist sights. 

'''Line 2''' runs horizontally through Guangzhou South Station and Yuexiu Park.

'''Line 3''' is a Y-shaped eastern Guangzhou. The 'main line' runs from Panyu Square to the Tianhe Intercity Coach Station, whilst the 'branch line' splits off at Tiyu Xilu and heads towards Airport South.

'''Line 5''' runs east-west from Jiaokou (Liwan District) to Wenchong (Huangpu District) and follows the inner ring road through the city. Useful for reaching Guangzhou Railway Station, the Garden Hotel and Zhujiang New Town.

====Others====
'''Line 4''' serves Guangzhou's eastern outer suburbs and runs from Huangcun in Huangpu District down to Jinzhou in Nansha. This line is most useful for reaching the Olympic Sport Centre and the University Town.

'''Line 8''' was formed out of the remnants of Line 2 following it's southward extension and runs east-west through Haizhu District from Fenghuang Xincun to Wanshengwei. Useful for reaching Sun Yat-sen University and Pazhou Exhibition Centre.

'''Zhujiang New Town APM''' is an experimental autopilot metro system which takes you to the Canton Tower.  You need a separate 2yuan ticket to get a ride. 

'''Guangfo Line''' is China's first intercity railway, connecting downtown Foshan with Xilang, where you can transfer to Line 1. Central Foshan can be reached in approximately 45-60 minutes from central Guangzhou. Transfers from GZ metro lines and Yangchengtong cards are accepted.

===By bus===
Guangzhou bus network is comprehensive. Bus fares are ¥2 for adults and ¥1 for children, disables and senior citizens. However, information at bus stops is mostly written in Chinese characters. A current stop's name may be displayed in pinyin or English on a LED display panel as long as it is available. On-board announcements are made in Mandarin, Cantonese and mostly English as well. 

Buses are only handy for traveling within one district or for reaching suburban districts that are not served by the subway. Heavy traffic can lead to a slow, uncomfortable journey although they can be handy for a cheap but slow sightseeing tour. Trolley bus lines (Routes 101-109) are handy for exploring Liwan and Yuexiu districts. 

Most bus routes run from around 6am to 10 or 11pm, after which there are night buses with the prefix 'Ye’ (夜, night). Night route numbers are not related to the normal route numbers. The fare is usually ¥3 - ¥4. There are more than 100 night routes, but most of them stop running in between 12:00 to 1:30am, and some start again around 5am. In most cases, taking a taxi after midnight and before the sunrise is a better idea.

Guangzhou has over 30 commuter express bus lines (高峰快线) run mostly during peak hours from major bus and subway interchanges to congested areas and outlying districts. Fares are from ¥1-4. There are also four special lines for University Town (大学城专线). You can find these in most major stations in the city that would take you to University Town. Fares are from ¥2-4. There are also 2 tourist bus lines (旅游专线) passing through many scenic spots in the city. Other special lines are: Lines to some commercial districts, shuttle buses for many different residential complexes such as Favourview Palace and Star River, and even complementary shuttle buses for some shopping center. The driver of a shuttle bus may ask for your receipts.

===By BRT===
The Bus Rapid Transit system went into service in early 2010. It is essentially a long segregated bus lane (not an elevated busway like in Xiamen) running along the Tianhe Road and Zhongshan Avenue corridor towards the eastern suburbs. Some intersections are traversed by bridges and tunnels, which cuts journey times considerably, but other intersections have traffic lights and therefore traffic jams, and crowds can be as dense as in Metro stations but with fewer doors and a narrower standing area compared to Metro trains.

All buses that use the BRT start with a B prefix (B1, B22 etc.), though some without the "B" stop nearby. When reading a bus route (in Chinese) you can see the BRT logo above each BRT station name, like the GZ Metro logo above bus stops that are near Metro stations. The B1 stops at every BRT station, but other B routes use any number of BRT stations (sometimes just one) and use normal roads the rest of the time.

If boarding a BRT bus at a normal (non BRT) bus stop, the normal fare of ¥2 applies, however you can transfer to other BRT routes for free, provided you transfer at a BRT stop. If boarding at a BRT stop, insert ¥2 (coins only) into the entry turnstile to enter the platform area; no payment is required when boarding the bus, and you can board at the rear.

As with normal bus routes, there is almost no English at BRT stations, and only the current station name is in pinyin. Overall it isn't much use to tourists.

===By taxi and DiDi===
This is the most popular way for foreigners to get around, and it is very affordable. The starting charge is ¥10 for the first 2.6 kilometres, and after that ¥2.6 for each kilometre. No fuel surcharge is added, but a 50% surcharge is automatically added when the trip reaches 35 kilometres. A few of them also accepts Yang Cheng Tong as payment, but it is not preferred by the drivers. The taxi hotline is 96900. This comes in handy if you forget your valuables in a taxi. '''Save your receipt because it contains the taxi's identification number.'''

Most taxi drivers do not speak English or any other foreign languages, so have the name and address of your destination written in Chinese to show the driver. Many are from the poorer northern provinces and do not even speak Cantonese. If your destination is not well known, have a nearby landmark included in the address, e.g. "across from the Garden Hotel."

Whilst the majority of taxis are the regular VWs and Hyundais found in almost all Chinese cities, there are an increasing number of 'London taxis' on the streets of Guangzhou (which comes as no surprise as the latest generation of London black cabs are built by Geely Motors in China). In Guangzhou they are known as "old-fashioned" cabs (老爷车，''lao ye che'') They are wheelchair accessible and can carry up to 6 passengers. Many people recommend using the yellow taxis as that company only employs local Guangzhou drivers who know the city well - other taxi companies usually hire migrant workers from other provinces who may not know where they are going.

Beware of taxi driver as sometimes, in addition to going around the block one too many times, they will also try to pass counterfeit notes. Pay close attention as to what they pay when passing toll booths. Good drivers will show you the toll receipts. Only add the toll amount to what is displayed in the meter. A trip between the airport to the East Railway Station cost around ¥120-130.

Most people find taxi drivers in Guangzhou to be honest. However, during the Canton Fair near the Pazhou Complex, it is common to see drivers violate rules, such as refusal of service and pre-negotiating a price rather than using the meter. It is also difficult to find a taxi available elsewhere in the city.

Most taxi shift changes take place between 15:00-17:00. During this time, it is hard to find a taxi as many drivers stop working by displaying the "out of service (暂停服务)" sign before the end of the shift, unless you are going in their direction. Taxi can be also hard to come by during commuter peak hours of 19:30-09:00 and 17:00-19:00. Finding a taxi at night is usually not a problem.

Uber has no presence in Guangzhou. However, there is a local service provider called "DiDi". It operates similarly to Uber and has an app in English which becomes very helpful for the expat community. Payment could be done through multiple ways including international credit cards and WeChat (international credit card could also be added here too but a WeChat account is needed). The prices are very cheap compared to other countries and is generally safe and reliable.

===By car===
While driving in Guangzhou is an option, drivers unfamiliar with the driving conditions in China's large cities should be aware of the risk and potential compensation incurred. Many car rental companies offers a driver as well. 

See also [[Driving in China]].

===By motorcycle===
Although a convenient way to navigate the city's back alleys and lanes, motorcycles are banned in the city center, and riding a motorcycle into these prohibited areas can lead to fines and possible confiscation of the bike. In addition to the central motorcycle ban, electric bicycles are banned from the city roads.

===By ferry===
The ferry is the cheapest way of crossing the Pearl River (Zhujiang). They were very popular in the 1980s and early 90s, carrying tens of thousands of passengers across the river each day. Nowadays its popularity declines greatly, mostly because of the construction of many bridges along the Pearl River and the availability of other public transportation. The river narrows while going through the city center (a bit wider than the Thames in central London). It is usually faster and more convenient to use the bridges or public transport(metro, bus) to cross the river than wait for the ferries. One ferry route that maintains its popularity operates between the '''Huangsha Pier''' by the seafood market next to Shamian Island and '''Fangcun Pier''', the pier on Bai-e-tan Bar Street (Changdi Road) in Fangcun. It departs every 10 minutes from 6AM to 10PM. The fare is ¥0.5 for a foot passenger or ¥1 if you bring a bicycle. The fare can be paid in cash (no change given) or by using Yangchengtong Card. There are separate boarding gates for cyclists and pedestrians, and you pay at the boarding gate.

Another popular and scenic route is called Waterbus (水上巴士), which travels down the river from Huangsha Pier to Canton Tower making a few stops along the way on both side of the river, shown as follow. Ticket price is ¥2, payable with cash or Yangchengton transportation card. '''This waterbus only runs during the day before 6:00 pm.'''

'''Huangsha Pier(黄沙码头) -- Xidi Pier(西堤码头) -- Tianzi Pier(天字码头) -- Da Yuan Shuai Fu(大元帅府码头) -- Sun Yat San University North(中大码头) -- Canton Tower(广州塔码头)'''

There is another ferry connecting Canton Tower with '''Hai Xin Sha (海心沙)''', located immediately across the Pearl River, providing another scenic way to cross the Pearl River. Ticket price is ¥2, payable with cash or Yangchengton transportation card. '''This ferry only runs during the day before 6:00 pm.'''

==Talk==
Mandarin is the official language as is spoken by everyone other than some of the older generation. All true Guangzhou locals speak Cantonese, and if you visit areas such as Liwan and Yuexiu, this is the predominant language spoken on the street. Migrants from other parts of China will speak Mandarin. Local people take the preservation of their dialect so seriously that they even marched to the government office to protest against a plan to limit the use of Cantonese in TV and radio broadcasting. 

English is spoken by more people than in the rest of China (save for Beijing and Shanghai), but still not by the majority, so it is a good idea to carry your hotel's business card with you. ''Do not expect drivers to speak English'', some of them can't even speak Mandarin without a heavy accent. To save yourself the hassle and agony when asking for directions, have names of your destinations clearly written down in Chinese by the hotel staff before venturing out. That said, many educated younger people will have a basic knowledge of English and staff at hotels as well as bars and restaurants widely visited by foreigners generally speak an acceptable level of English. Staffs at Starbucks generally speak acceptable English and high school or college students can generally understand basic English as well, but not for speaking. If you find a Chinese people on the street who speaks English fluently, then you most likely run into either someone working at a foreign company, a highly educated student or a person who has studied abroad.

Despite the fact that not the majority of people speak English, but the signs are often in Chinese and English, even though sometimes the English version doesn't really make any sense or obviously translated by google.

==Eat==
Cantonese cuisine is well-known for its blend of color, fragrance, taste and presentation, and it is ranked among the top four in the country. In particular, ''dim sum'', a delicate pastry, is famous for being simple yet delicious. Local customs, as well as a long history of contact with the West compared to other regions in China, have played a major role in the development and diversity of Cantonese cuisine. Chinese food served in Western countries is usually Cantonese food, albeit slightly adapted to Western tastes, meaning that most Western visitors from large cities will be familiar with Cantonese food to a certain extent. That being said, authentic Cantonese cuisine is also famous throughout China for another reason - Cantonese people eat '''absolutely anything''', and it is often said that Cantonese people eat anything that has four legs other than a table, anything that flies other than an airplane, and anything that swims other than a submarine. In addition to that, various internal organs of animals are regularly eaten, such as the liver, kidneys, heart and even brain. This means that Cantonese cuisine is one of, if not the most adventurous in China due to their expansive use of exotic ingredients, and their extremely broad definition of what is considered edible. This is how Guangzhou earned the distinct name of "Eating in Guangzhou (食在广州)."

===What to Eat===
* '''White Cut Chicken (白切鸡)''' This is one of the most popular Cantonese dishes. It is lightly flavored to allow one to taste the true chicken meat. Many Cantonese restaurants have their signature dish based on this, such as the Wenchang Chicken from Guangzhou Restaurant, Real Taste Chicken from Bingsheng Restaurant and Qingping Chicken from various restaurants. However, to be cautious, especially westerners, since the chicken is completely steam without any cut off, you might see the head and feet of the chicken

* '''Yum Cha / Dim Sum (饮茶)''' "A pot of tea with two pieces (一盅两件)" is Guangzhou's dim sum culture. Many locals stay for hours chatting and reading newspaper with just a small order of food. The varieties of dim sum dishes in many restaurants are easily over a hundred. The bite-size quantity of each dish allows one to venture out and try new things that will satisfy one's taste bud.

* '''Siu Mei / Shao Wei (烧味)''' Cantonese barbecue is famous around the world where many have seen the image of roasted ducks and chicken hanging in front of a store. Siu mei is a staple item in Cantonese restaurants. Some Varieties include barbecued pork (叉烧), roast goose (烧鹅) and roast pig (烧肉).

* '''Seafood (海鲜)''' Eating fresh seafood the Cantonese way is a good way to explore Cantonese culture. From picking live fish or lobsters in front of your eyes to eating the sea creatures with their heads attached, this is a great advanture for any visitors.

* '''Dessert (甜品,糖水)''' A Cantonese meal is not complete without Cantonese desserts. Soupy or custard desserts are common. Two distinct Guangzhou favorites are double layered milk (双皮奶) and ginger milk curd (姜撞奶). Other popular choices include tofu pudding (豆腐花), red bean paste (紅豆沙), green bean paste (綠豆沙), guilinggao (龟苓膏), black sesame paste (芝麻糊) and sago (西米露).

When it comes to drinks, Guangzhou is one of the best cities in China to knock back a few. With a relatively large population of foreigners here, the city offers a wide variety of nightspots that cater to all tastes.

Tsing Tao and Zhu Jiang are the two major Chinese beer brands that are sold almost everywhere. Both are fairly standard light lagers. Carlsberg is also brewed in Guangzhou, which explains the reasonably large amount of Carlsberg taps in the bars.

{{warningbox|Foreigners MUST present an original passport with a valid visa for staying at a legal hotel or hostel. 

Many wikitravellers have reported troubles during check-in when their passports were held by other consulates or PBS office for applying for or extending a visa. Make sure to check in first at hotels/hostels before applying any visas. 

If you don't have an original passport, don't expect mercy from hotel receptionists, who may face a prison term and heavy penalty if they allow you to stay without a passport. 
}} 

{{warningbox|
Guangzhou has Public Security Bureau (PBS) 's Exit and Entry Office for renewing visa for staying at China. When submitting your application, you need to present a Temporary Residence Registration Form (临时住宿登记, Linshi Zhusu Dengji) , which is issued only by legal hotels and hostels. Consult front desk staff. 
}} 


{{cautionbox|'' From April 15th to May 5th and October 15th to November 5th are the annual Guangzhou International Trade Fairs in which room rates in hotels and hostels will usually be hiked up. Prices vary every year and you are advised to secure your bed before going to Guangzhou in those two seasons''}}

{{cautionbox|'' Beware when booking any hotels around Guangzhou South Station (廣州南站). Most of the hotels here that carry brand names, such as Home Inn (儒家), 7 Days Inn (7天連鎖酒店), etc. are FAKE and you'll end up staying in a dodgy, unclean place. Those hotels do not actually have branches near South Station. Avoid staying in this area if at all possible.''}}

==Work==
Guangzhou is not as well known as Beijing or Shanghai as a hub of foreign commerce and trade - perhaps unfairly, as it's the center of manufacturing in China. Most people on the planet are no further than a few feet away from an object produced in in the Guangzhou metropolitan area at any given time. This includes the components of the screen you're reading this on.

While there may not be as many opportunities for foreigners here compared to Beijing or Shanghai, this massive city and its rapidly growing economy does offer some work for foreigners - management, translation, engineering and teaching English. There are a number of large ESL school chains, owned by foreigners, in the area who hire (mainly) North American teachers. As with any rapidly growing industry, there are many sketchy companies trying to make a buck. If you want to work as an English teacher in Guangzhou - which can be an amazing experience - make sure to verify the credentials of the school.

English teaching jobs are available teaching a range of ages from kindergarten to elementary, middle and high school students as well as universities and private language centers. Schools usually require native speakers with a degree in any discipline and TEFL certificate.

==Stay safe==
Violent crimes are not common. As one of the first open ports in China, Guangzhou is known for its liberalism and general tolerance of cultural differences. Crimes that target foreigners are rarely heard of but [[pickpockets]] could happen in shopping areas and transportation hubs. Teahouse scams, which are serious problems in Beijing and Shanghai, have not been reported in Guangzhou. 

A possible scam is when a taxi driver refuses your notes and tells you it is fake. What happens is that the taxi driver changes your note for a fake one without you noticing. Always be suspicious when a vendor refuses your money and gives it back to you. 

As the third wealthiest province of China, it has attracted enormous immigrant workers both from other provinces and overseas. The local police has Arabic- and English-speaking forces to deal with the rising drug trade involved with foreigners, who are not exempted from the death penalty for drug trafficking.

Traffic conditions in Guangzhou have drastically improved in recent years and rules are practiced - ''relatively''. However, like everywhere else in China, cars do not yield to pedestrians and zebra crossings are for display only.

Emergency numbers are: Police: 110; Fire: 119; Medical: 120; Traffic accident: 122.

==Contact==

*The '''area dialing code''' for Guangzhou is '''020'''. From overseas, dial +86 20 XXXX-XXXX. Phone numbers are 8 digits. Mobile numbers are 11 digits and city code is not required.

*'''Internet''' is prevalent in Guangzhou. Many western chain restaurants such as McDonald's, Subway, Starbucks, offer an easy access to Internet. Many major public places are now covered with free wifi (ssid: wireless_GZ), including the Baiyun International Airport, libraries, public parks, hospitals, railway stations and several shopping centers.

*'''Police''': The Public Security Bureau Exit-Entry Administration Division is located at 155 Jiefang South Road (解放南路155号) ''+86 20'' 8311-5808 (M-F 8:50AM-11:30AM, 2:30PM-5PM.) You can get your visa extension done here.
