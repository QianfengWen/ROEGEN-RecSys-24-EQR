{{pagebanner|Ljubljana Banner.jpg}}

'''Ljubljana''' [http://www.ljubljana.si/en/] has no world-famous attractions, which is just great: there's no need to hop from one place to another, taking photos and crossing the items on your checklist. You have all the time to stroll around and enjoy the city itself.

In the summer, its center hosts a number of city sponsored events, from children workshops and public playgrounds on the streets that get closed for traffic for the occasion, to Trnfest's off-beat street performances and musical events of all genres. In autumn it shows its academic face as it fills again by students of the state's largest university to whom the city owes much of its youthful character. Cold December days are warmed by thousand of lights, the new year's decoration conceived by local artists, and by food and drinks sold from street stands on the banks of Ljubljanica river. After surviving the boring gray remaining of winter, the city erupts again with spring flowers planted on its streets and crossroads.
 
==Understand==
[[Image:Ljubljana Montage.png|thumb|400px|right|Ljubljana with its many sights]]
Ljubljana ("lyoob-lyAH-nah") is a charming city full of artists, museums, and galleries. With a population of just over 200,000, it is one of the smallest capital cities in [[Europe]].

===Orientation===

The Ljubljanica river flows through the center of town, past Baroque buildings and under the ramparts of the ancient castle on the hill.  The new city and modern-day commercial core lies to the west of the river, while the old city and the castle are located on the east side of the river. Many bridges cross the river, the most famous of which is ''Tromostovje'' (Triple Bridge), designed by architect Jože Plečnik.

===By plane===
'''Ljubljana Jože Pučnik Airport''' (IATA: LJU) is located 30 km from the city centre of Ljubljana and it is the largest Slovenian airport.

'''EasyJet''' is connecting Ljubljana with [[London]] Gatwick (LGW), [[London]] Stansted (STN), [[Berlin]] Tegel (TXL) and [[Berlin]] Schönefeld (SXF), '''Turkish Airlines''' with [[Istanbul]] (IST),'''WizzAir''' with [[London]] Luton (LTN) and [[Brussels]] Charleroi (CRL), '''LOT Polish Airlines''' with [[Warsaw]] (WAW), '''Transavia''' with [[Amsterdam]] (AMS), '''AirSerbia''' with [[Belgrade]] (BEG), '''Finnair''' with [[Helsinki]] (HEL), '''Aeroflot''' with [[Moscow]] (SVO), '''Air France''' with [[Paris]] (CDG) and '''Montenegro Airlines''' with [[Podgorica]] (TGD). '''Arkia Israeli Airlines, Israir Airlines and El Al Israel Airlines''' are all connecting Ljubljana with [[Tel Aviv]] Ben Gurion International Airport (TLV).

'''What LJU does have:''' free WiFi (''Airport Public''), bars with coffee, tea, alcohol, local beverages and several food options such as sandwiches and desserts (departures area: one before security check, one after; arrivals area: one in the waiting hall; the visitors terrace is closed due to renovations of the airport), restaurant (departures area: one before security check; no fast food options), shops with souvenirs (departures area: two before security check, duty free after), exchange office (departures area: post office – only open Mo-Fr 8:00 a.m-10:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m.-5:00 p.m.), VAT Tax Refund (departures area: souvenir shop), Tourist-information counter (arrivals area: offering large selection of free promotional material that covers whole Slovenia and free maps of major cities; selling Ljubljana Tourist Card – if you buy it online with 10 % discount, you can just pick it up there; they do not book accommodations, transfers or tours; open till the last flight).

'''What LJU doesn’t have:''' storage lockers (you can save your luggage at Ljubljana Train Station for 3,00-6,00 € a day), train connection to Ljubljana, hotel.

'''Traveling between the airport and the city center:''' 
* '''Buses''' run every hour on the hour between 5 a.m. and 8 p.m. during the week and every two hours on the hour between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. during weekends and holidays. Tickets that cost 4,10 € can be bought directly at the driver. Free rides are included in Ljubljana Tourist Card but only for buses at 8 a.m., 10 a.m., 12 a.m., 2 p.m., 4 p.m., 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. during the week. The journey to the city center takes 50 minutes.
* '''Shuttles''' are offered by two companies: GoOpti and Nomago. The ticket that cost 10 € can be bought at their desks at the arrivals area waiting hall. Reservation is only required for destinations other than Ljubljana. The journey to the city center takes 30-45 minutes (depends on the traffic).
* '''Taxis''' usually charge around 50 € for the ride to the city center. You can book them upfront [https://www.airportljubljana.co/Booking_Ljubljana_airport_taxi.php online] and it will be cheaper, but pay attention that you book with a transfer company that is stationed in Slovenia because international companies sometimes ‘forget’ to pick up their clients (and it is much easier to get a refund if that happens with Slovenian company). Airport taxis have their permission displayed at the left corner of the windshield and if they charge you with an excessive price you can file a report with Ljubljana Airport (just save a receipt). 
* '''Private transfers''' similar to taxis but usually booked in advance you have a fixed rate (so there is no room for inflated bills) and drivers wait for you at the airport personally. There are plenty of companies and you can arrange your airport transfer from home well in advance of your travel. You can also book a specific vehicle type or class, ranging from cars to minivans.
One the most experienced and reliable also according to TripAdvisor seems to be [https://www.airportljubljana.co/Slovenia_private_transfers.php Airtrail Slovenia], company based in Ljubljana, which will either pick you up from one of the airports nearby or take you to a trip around the country or even broader.
* '''Rental car''' companies offer a large variety of manual and automatic vehicles: Dollar & Thrifty, Agio, Surprise, Atet, Advantage, Avantcar, Avis, Budget, Igma Car, ABC, Europcar, Hertz, Sixt, Anticus, Adria Car, Green Motion, Alamo, Enterprise, National and Interrent.

===By bus===

Bus Station Ljubljana (''http://www.ap-ljubljana.si/en/'') is right next to the train station and has services throughout Slovenia, as well as to foreign countries. The station has several useful schedule search engines (also in English) for working out connections; however these do not always have live availability information (i.e., a journey marked as "sold out" or "not available" on the machines may indeed still be bookable at the ticket offices). Generally speaking, a bus can take you almost anywhere in Slovenia within a few hours. Ticket offices are cash only (ATM is available next to the ticket offices).

You can visit some of the most interesting places in Slovenia from Bus Station Ljubljana, f.e. Postojna Cave, Bled Lake, Piran, [https://www.park-skocjanske-jame.si/en/ Škocjan caves]. Bus Station is offering a full package for Postojna cave, voucher as a ticket and a discounted audio guides in 15 languages. You can also buy a ticket for the Bled Castle on the station and you get a coupon with a discounted price for Bled famous Slice Cream.

Direct international connections: [[Trieste]] (2 hours), [[Rijeka]] (2,5 hours), [[Zagreb]] (2,5 hours), [[Venice]] (4 hours), [[Banja Luka]] (5 hours), [[Bihać]] (6 hours), [[Bologna]] (6 hours), [[Munich]] (7 hours), [[Florence]] (8 hours), [[Tuzla]] (8 hours), [[Ulm]] (8 hours), [[Zenica]] (8 hours), [[Belgrade]] (8,5 hours), [[Stuttgart]] (9 hours), [[Turin]] (9 hours), [[Split]] (10 hours), [[Mannheim]] (10 hours), [[Karlsruhe]] (12 hours), [[Niš]] (12 hours), [[Sarajevo]] (12 hours, or 9 hours overnight), [[Frankfurt]] (14 hours), [[Skopje]] (15 hours), [[Hamburg]] (16 hours), [[Tetovo]] (16 hours), [[Sofia]] (16 hours), [[Pristina]] (18 hours).

===By train===

[[File:Ljubljana Main train station.jpg|thumb|Ljubljana Main train station]]
The Ljubljana bus and train stations are located next to each other at Trg Osvobodilne fronte (''Trg'' means square in Slovenian). The two stations are located just north of the city center and a short walk from most hotels and attractions. The train station has a tourist information center, currency exchange, and left-luggage service.

Ljubljana is the hub of Slovenia's rail system and national operator [https://potniski.sz.si/en/ Slovenske Zeležnice]. Local trains run throughout the country - no point in Slovenia is more than 3 hours away. The fastest train is ICS (InterCitySlovenija) which runs from Koper to Maribor via Ljubljana (the most expensive). Local trains, such as LP or RG stop at every station (the cheapest). IC, EC and MV trains connect major cities (Ljubljana, Maribor, Murska Sobota, Jesenice, Koper).

Direct international connections include [[Zagreb]] (2 hours), [[Rijeka]] (3 hours), [[Graz]] (3 hours), [[Salzburg]] (4 hours), [[Vienna]] (6 hours), [[Munich]] (6 hours), [[Budapest]] (7.5 hours), [[Frankfurt]] (10 hours), [[Zürich]] (11 hours). There are two trains per day to [[Trieste]] (2.5 hours) and eight trains a day in each direction to Villa Opicina (2 hours).

Nearby [[Pula]] can be reached with a change of trains in Divača and Buzet. For this route a Pula Spezial ticket (€19 one way/€29 return) is available.

===By car===
Renting a car is also an option, especially if you are visiting remote destinations outside of Ljubljana.

==Get around==

===On foot===
The center of Ljubljana is small enough to cover on foot. You can pick up a free city map at a tourist information center or in the train station. Navigating or finding a street is easy as streets are clearly marked.

===By bicycle===
Bikes are available for rent at the '''Slovenian Tourist Information Center''' (beside the Central Market) as well as some of the hotels in the area (€1 for 2 hours, €5 for the whole day ending 7~9pm depending on season). There is also a system called "Bicikelj" where you can rent bikes for a week for just 1€. It has 300 bikes on 30 stations around the inner city part and you can subscribe with a credit card online. For more information go to this site: http://en.bicikelj.si/

===By city bus===
[[Image:Lpp.jpg|thumb|250px|Typical Ljubljana city bus (top left), a bus station (top right), a self-service kiosk for buying and refilling prepaid bus cards (bottom left) and a bike-rental service that runs on the same cards (bottom right)]]

The city's transportation authority [http://www.jh-lj.si/index.php?p=4&k=1636&l=2 LPP] operates 26 bus lines, which are clean and run frequently (every 5-10 minutes, 15-30 minutes during the weekend and summer). Most bus routes operate 5am - 10.30pm (Sundays from 6am). Night lines are: N1 (10.30pm - 5am), 2, N3/N3B (9pm - 5am), N5 (9pm - 5am), 6 and 11B/N11 (9pm - 5am). Saturdays and Sundays no service on lines 11 (11B is Saturday and 20Z is Sunday replacement), 15, 22, 24, 28, 29 and 60. Sundays no service on lines 1 (1B/1S is replacement), 7L, 8 (1B/1S is replacement), 18, 20 (20Z is replacement), 21 and 27 (NS Rudnik - BTC - Letališka) does not operate on Sundays, it is replaced with a route 27K which goes from Bavarski dvor to Kolosej in BTC City and it's on service only on Sundays from 4PM onwards.

To ride the buses, you must first purchase an Urbana card (similar to an Oyster Card in [[London]]). These can be bought at self-service stations ("Urbanomat") found at the larger bus stops across the city, LPP sales sites, Tourist Information Centers and newspaper agents for €2 and need to be loaded with an amount ranging from €1 to €50. Upon entering the bus by the front door, you need to position the card next to the reader to pay for the route. The confirmation is a quiet beep and an illuminated green light, while  a negative response is a louder beep and a red light. After that, you proceed to take your seat / stand.

The cost per journey is €1.30 and includes an unlimited number of free transfers within 90 minutes from the first entry to the bus. Although if you are a regular guest in Ljubljana and have a mobile with a Slovenian operator (for example A1, Mobitel, Izimobil, Debitel etc.) and you have a postpaid contract with them, you can pay the bus route with your mobile - you just dial 1899 at the entry of the bus and approach the Urbana device with your mobile and leave it there until the device approves the payment. It's a 'quite in handy' thing, but it costs €1.30 and you can use it only for the ride you're on (unlike Urbana card when you can have unlimited number of free transfers within 90 minutes from the first entry to the bus) - the amount will be charged from your number and viewable on your monthly payment.

Most lines operate at least once every 15 minutes. Timetables [http://www.jh-lj.si/index.php?p=4&k=802] (in Slovene) only have departure times from first bus stop so you can use the webpage [http://bus.talktrack.com/Default.aspx?culture=en-GB] to obtain predicted departure times for next three buses from every bus stop.

===By taxi===
Note that not all taxis charge the same fare.

While taxis ordered by phone are cheap, those waiting on the street will usually charge through the roof, and you can end up paying €25 for a short ride. Unless you're in a hurry, always order a taxi by phone!

If you create a mess in the vehicle or otherwise damage it, you will have to pay for repairing/cleaning, tourist or not.  Cleaning a cab usually costs 10-15 euro; if you don't have the money, they'll take valuables from you (phone, passport, jewelry, etc.), and return them if you agree to pay the bill. If things get out of hand, feel free to call the police -- it's your right to call them.

Taxi drivers are generally very nice people, but when it comes to the money, they can get violent quickly.  You need to be extra careful when using 'freelancers' in Slovenian 'privatniki'.  Ordering a taxi by phone is safer and much cheaper.

You might check out also some of private transfers companies which you preorder in advance and are mostly higher class vehicles and service for a reasonable or even lower rate than taxi. If you know the route you can make arrangements already from your home so everything is set up when you arrive to your destination.

==Talk==
The main language of the city is unsurprisingly [[Slovenian]]. Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian/Montenegrin is generally understood by most people and frequently spoken fluently by adults, especially those over the age of 40. Most citizens speak at least some English, some speak it fluently. It's also worth trying any major European language you speak, especially German, as you just might be understood.

The easiest and most pleasant way to reach all spots described below is on foot, except for the Zoo and the Architecture Museum.

Most of Ljubljana’s bars tend to cluster on the streets running parallel to the river, radiating from Prešernov trg, which is the main square in Ljubljana.

Some litte saftey advices:

Do not argue with security guards, they are not very friendly!

Do not start or be involved in fight inside the club!

Homosexuals are not very welcome so i would advice them to avoid this club!

Never i repeat never drive drunk around 'dvanajska' club, police is looking for their cut, and the fines are extremly high(1000euro>) involving towing your car away! Always take a taxi, bus or 0,00 alcohol drive.

Prices are €20 and up a night with the private Turquoise room going for about €40 a night. Front desk is staffed in the morning and early evening and you need the code to get in.
Contact the hostel if you're going to be late, because no one will be around to let you in or unlock your room (unless you have a cell phone that will work in Slovenia. Phone numbers are posted outside). Reception staff are very friendly and extremely helpful.
A nice efficient place to stay, with a good vibe, if you don't mind bare-bones comfort.</sleep>

==Stay safe==

Ljubljana is possibly one of the safest capitals you'll ever visit. Remarkably safe during the day and night, as a tourist you should have no problems, provided you are not desperately looking for trouble.

Even the rougher parts of Ljubljana, located far from the city centre, are relatively safe, if you don't flash your valuables. These areas, not commonly frequented by tourists, include Fužine, Vevče, Rakova Jelša, Štepanjsko naselje and parts of Šiška, Moste and Šentvid. Firearm and weapon attacks are extremely uncommon, with confrontations being mostly physical. 

After shops close for the night, the BTC shopping center area at the northeast of the city is frequented by reckless drivers, so extra caution is recommended for pedestrians and drivers.

Tivoli Park is generally very safe and a very popular destination for picnics or taking an afternoon stroll for an average Ljubljanian, but just as anywhere in the world it is recommended that you don't put your guard down and avoid larger groups of teenagers hanging around in the park late at night, as thefts and sexual assaults have been reported.

Scam artists and pickpockets are very uncommon, but are still present and target tourists. Take care as you would in any city. Homeless people and beggars are also uncommon and are not violent or confrontational.

Although Ljubljana is for the most part an open and tolerant city, gay-bashings have been reported in recent years, so you'll be better off keeping the nature of your sexual orientation down a bit. Rural regions of Slovenia might be even more hostile towards the LGBT community, though the attacks are limited to verbal confrontations. 

The police in Slovenia is in general trustworthy and helpful.

All in all, Ljubljana is one of the safest cities around the globe.

==Get out==

=== Hills around the city ===

* Šmarna gora (662 m), is a popular (and overcrowded on weekends) hill on the northern outskirts of the city. For 30-60 minutes of easy climbing you will be rewarded with a nice view over the entire city. Bus number 8 will take you to the foothill; get off at 'Tacen'.

* Off the beaten track, Krim mountain (1107 m), used to station a military and civilian communication center due to its' strategic position overlooking most of Slovenia. With only the civilian part remaining, the top is open to the public and offers a great 360 degree panoramic view on clear days, especially after it rains. The climb takes 2-3 hours (beware of bears!), with the most convenient access by car. The last 4 kilometers of the road are unpaved and narrow, so even by car the journey will take about 30 minutes each way.

=== Farther out ===

* [[Bled]] - the most picturesque town in Slovenia, with a scenic lake with an island church, overlooked by a castle. Only 1 hour from Ljubljana.

* [[Triglav National Park]] and the [[Julian Alps]] - a paradise for  outdoor adventurers. Opportunities abound for hiking, mountaineering, rafting, canyoning, paragliding, skydiving, etc...Located just outside of [[Bled]]

* [[Postojna]] - home to the remarkably huge Postojna Cave and the Predjama Castle

* [[Divača|Škocjan Caves]] - another set of remarkable caves, a UNESCO World Heritage Site

* '''Skiing''' - Slovenia's national sport. There are several ski resorts all across the country. One very good one is the Krvavec ski resort [http://www.rtc-krvavec.si/] in the Kamnik Alps. It is located about 35 kilometers north of Ljubljana.

* [[Izola]], [[Koper]], [[Piran]], and [[Portorož]] are located on the coast of [[Slovenia]] and offer beautiful scenery. Do a little sailing or water sports or walk around the old city of [[Piran]]. 

* [[Kranj]] - old medieval city, located just 30 min from Ljubljana. Take a stop here, when going to Bled.

* [[Kamnik]] - button-cute little town 45 min north of Ljubljana, just below the Kamnik Alps. It has a perfectly preserved medieval town center. 

* [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]] - 2.5 hours by train

* [[Rijeka]], [[Croatia]] - 2.5 hours by train

===Hitchhiking out of Ljubljana===

Hitchhiking in and/or out of Ljubljana is possible and widely practiced, but take the usual precautions as always with hitchhiking, especially if you are a woman.

* North towards [[Maribor]], [[Austria]] - from the main street, West of the Train station (Dunajska Cesta) take buses 6, 8 or 11 in direction of North. Get off in the station "Smelt", 15 minutes later, when you see the "World Trade Center" building. Ahead of you, you will see the highway. On the first turn to the right, go into the highway entry and stand on the side with your sign.

* South towards [[Koper]], [[Rijeka]], [[Italy]] - from the city center (Dunajska cesta, Kongresni trg) take bus number 6 in direction south, till the last station (Dolgi most). Get out, and on your left side you will side the entry lane into the highway. There will also be an entry to a parking of a small house, stand on the side there with your sign (you will see where everybody else stands...).

* East towards [[Novo mesto]], [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]] - from the city center (Dunajska cesta) take bus number 3 in direction south, till the last station (Rudnik). Get out, and walk 200 meters more along Dolenjska cesta until you get to the crossroad and the entry point to the highway (left turn, opposite to the railroad crossing). Stand on the side there with your sign (the are some hitchhikers but not all the time ...).
