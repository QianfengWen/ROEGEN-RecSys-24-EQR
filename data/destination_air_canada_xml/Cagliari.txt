==Get around==
===By public transportation===
Cagliari Public Transportation CTM provides an fast and efficient service to get around in Cagliari city and suburbs.There are about 30 lines of buses and four new metro lines are in progress. At least the bus traffic is amazingly efficient and reliable to Italian standards. 
[http://www.ctmcagliari.it] Prices are reasonable with a wide variety of choices: €1.20 for a 90 minute single ride, €2.00 for a 120 minute single ride, €3 for a daily pass, €12 for a 12 ride pass, €12 for a weekly pass. Only single ride tickets can be purchased on board for €1.50 (exact change) and subject to availability. It is advised to buy tickets from automatic vending machines or tobacco-shops ("Tabacchi") or newsstands ("Edicola") before getting on the bus. Some cafe/bars also sell tickets ("biglietti"). Look for a "CTM" sign for an establishment that sells tickets. Remember to validate your ticket once on board.

There is a light rail service in Cagliari known by its commercial name "Metrocagliari".[http://arst.sardegna.it/orari_e_autolinee/servizi_metroca.html] Presently it serves in between the stops 'Repubblica' and 'Policlinico Universitaria'. Presently, the tram line does not serve the area of popular tourist attractions.[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Cagliari_mappa_metrotranvia.svg] Take note that the 'CTM ticket' is not valid on the tram as it is operated by 'ARST Gestione FdS'.

===By taxi===
Taxis are available in very few specific taxi stands or by advanced booking over the telephone (Quattro Mori: 070 400101 and Rossoblù: 070 6655). As they main attractions are either very close to the city center or very well connected by public transport, taxis are not very essential.

===By car===
It is really difficult to get parking and drive in rush hour even if the road network has been recently improved.

===On foot===
The best thing you can do is walk through the old city and discover it. Almost everything you have to see in a quick visit of Cagliari can be joined by a pleasant little walk.

Wear comfortable shoes, though. The old town of Cagliari lies in a somewhat steep hill, so you will be walking uphill or downhill most of the time.

There are clean public toilets in the building on the Pontile Sanita ferry wharf, near the bus terminal.

===By bike===
The Cagliari bike station is in the centre of Cagliari, inside the parking area, at the train station. [http://www.ichnusabike.it]. Please take note that Cagliari is a hilly city and biking in the historic center can be tiresome. Also, in most of the parts of Cagliari, there are no specific bike lanes.
