'''Aomori''' (青森) [http://www.city.aomori.aomori.jp/english/idxeng.html], the capital of [[Aomori (prefecture)|Aomori prefecture]], [[Japan]], is located on Mutsu Bay, at the northern tip of [[Honshu]].

==Get in==

===By air===
Aomori's airport is served by Japan Airlines. JAL flights arrive from [[Tokyo]] Haneda Airport, [[Nagoya]] Centrair Airport, [[Osaka]] Itami and Kansai Airports, [[Sapporo]] Chitose Airport, and Fukuoka Airport. Buses connect the airport to the main train station for &yen;560. The bus ride lasts 35 minutes.

===By train===
[[Image:Shin-Aomori station 20101123.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Shin-Aomori station]]
Aomori is the northern terminus of Japan's Shinkansen train service. From [[Tokyo]], Tohoku Shinkansen '''Hayate''' (はやて) and '''Hayabusa''' (はやぶさ) trains run to '''Shin-Aomori station''', from which regular trains shuttle passengers over to the more centrally-located '''Aomori station'''. The trip on the '''Hayate''' takes approximately 3 hours 40 minutes, including average transfer and waiting times at Shin-Aomori, while '''Hayabusa''' trains are slightly faster. Ticketed passengers are permitted to travel to Aomori station in the non-reserved car of any train, even if a limited express train heading towards Aomori departs first.

The regular one-way fare from Tokyo to Aomori is &yen;16,370 on the '''Hayate''' and &yen;16,870 on the '''Hayabusa''', and so the better deal for the round-trip is to purchase a '''JR East Rail Pass''' (&yen;22,000 (12+)/11000 (6-11) for 5 non-consecutive days within a 14 day period). If your travel plans include other parts of the country, such as [[Hokkaido]], the better option will be the regular Japan Rail Pass or a '''JR East-South Hokkaido Pass''' (&yen;27,000 (12+)/13500 (6-11) for 6 non-consecutive days within a 14 day period). Note that the Green Car version of the rail pass is valid for Green Cars on the '''Hayate''' and '''Hayabusa''', but any version of the pass will cover just the basic fare for the premium first class seating on the '''Hayabusa''' called "GranClass". Travelers using "GranClass" will be pampered with an all-leather seat resembling business class on an airplane, a personal on-call train attendant, high-quality meals and complimentary alcoholic beverages. Japan Rail Pass holders willing to partake in such an experience must pay the Shinkansen express charge and GranClass surcharge (&yen;16,490 from Tokyo). Without a Rail Pass, "GranClass" costs &yen;26,360 between Tokyo and Aomori.

===By bus===
Aomori, at the northernmost point of Honshu, is the terminating point for several highway buses. 

From [[Tokyo]] Station, JR Bus Tohoku's ''La Foret'' service runs once per night, reaching Aomori in 9 1/2 hours at a cost of &yen;9,000 each way on Fridays, Saturdays and the day before holidays, and &yen;8,500 on all other days. Konan Bus' ''Tsugaru'' runs over the same route; their bus costs &yen;7,500 each way, or &yen;9,000 during peak travel periods.

From Ueno Station in Tokyo, Konan Bus runs discounted bus services to Aomori: a daytime service called ''Sky'' (&yen;5,000) and two night services called ''Panda'' (&yen;4,500; &yen;5,000 during peak travel periods). These buses take longer to Aomori - about 11 hours each way - due to an additional stop made in [[Hirosaki]].

'''[http://willerexpress.com/ Willer Express]''' operates several buses from Tokyo Station, Tokyo Disneyland and Shinjuku to Aomori with prices starting from about &yen;5,000. Bookings can be made online in English.

Four bus operators jointly run ''Blue City'' daytime buses between [[Sendai]] and Aomori (5 hours, &yen;5,700). There are more runs during the summer months than the rest of the year.

===By boat===
'''Seikan Ferry''' [http://www.seikan-ferry.co.jp] and '''Tsugaru Kaikyo Ferry''' [http://www.tsugarukaikyo.com/] operate ferry services from Aomori to the port of [[Hakodate]] with multiple departures daily. One way fares are cheapest on the Seikan Ferry at &yen;1,500 for a carpet space. The Tsugaru Kaikyo ferries are more expensive: one way fares are &yen;2,700 for second class (carpet space), &yen;5,000 for first class and &yen;6,000 for special class. Note that first and special classes are only offered on specific departures and offer better amenities, such as a room with bed. Travel time on all services is approximately 3 hours, 45 minutes.

==Get around==
'''Taxis''' are always available from the train station.

'''Buses''' exist in Aomori, and while it can be confusing at first, getting around by bus is not too difficult.  If you're starting at the bus terminal outside Aomori station, you can easily get English-language information on any bus route at the Tourist Information Counter next to the bus terminal.  Also, if you're using the city bus on the weekend or a national holiday, you can buy a special one day pass for 500 yen that allows you to travel anywhere on a city bus.  It's a great way to get around if you're planning to visit several places.  The passes can be bought from the driver or in advance at the city bus counter, which is in the same building as the Tourist Information.

Anywhere around the downtown area is easily accessible on foot.

==Buy==
For loading up on regional souvenirs, head to '''ASPAM''', the unusual-looking triangular building located just behind the bridge on the harbor. It contains an exhibition hall for promoting tourism and local products.  Alternatively, check out A Factory, which also stocks a wide range of local products.  There's also a small food court and an apple cidery, where you can sample the local brew.

==Eat==
Aomori's specialties include a miso-curry-milk ramen, Tsugaru Ramen (made with niboshi, a type of dried fish, in the broth), apple pies, apple cider, and various other apple based products.

* <eat name="Ganesh" alt="" address="" directions="A few blocks SE of the train station &mdash; go down Shinmachi a few blocks and then right a few blocks." phone="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">This is a small restaurant with very good Indian food.

* <drink name="Cafe Skyline Gusto" alt="" address="Shinmachi" directions="" phone="" url="" hours="7AM-2AM" price="" lat="" long="">The Gusto chain is always a safe bet for foreign travelers. It is similar to the Denny's and Jonathan's chains in Japan and not too different from the Denny's or Perkin's restraunt chains in America. Gusto is often the best option for the weary traveler due to its late hours and relaxed atmosophere (as well as the farmiliar menu items, all with pictures). Cafe Skyline Gusto is across from the Aomorikan Hotel, down a street or two. It has pretty standard fare in terms of Japanese breakfast food (toast with mayonnaise and eggs), but also features bacon and sausage as sides to eggs (most expensive is &yen;499). In addition, you can also get a stack of three pancakes or two pancakes with condensed milk, banana and maple syrup (both are roughly &yen;450). Gusto is particularly know for the drink bar (included with most set menu items), which includes milk, a wide variety of juices (remember Aomori is famous for their apples!) as well as the coffee machine, which dispenses cappuccino, American style coffee as well as espresso. The bar is self-serve, and makes for an easy morning. The drink bar by itself is roughly &yen;350, so buying breakfast is worth it for the drink service alone.</drink>

*<drink name="Carpe Diem English Bar" alt="ichi go ichi e" address="" directions="5 min walk from the train, Shinmachi passage is a pedestrian area on the right side of the main street. Carpe Diem is between Bonitos Coffee Shop and the spagetti shop.  2 doors down from the ramen shop." phone="017 722-2129" url="" hours="11:30AM-late" price="&yen;500 for a large beer." lat="" long="">Carpe Diem is a foreigner friendly bar with premiership football and curry made by a Calcutta chef. Free internet.</drink>

==Sleep==
Numerous hotels dot Shinmachi, the main street that stretches out from the train station.  These hotels generally increase in price the closer you get to the train station. 

* <sleep name="Aomori Grand Hotel" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" email="" fax="" url="" checkin="" checkout="" price="">This hotel is probably the closest and most expensive of these hotels.  It is on the left as you begin down Shinmachi.</sleep>
*<sleep name="Iruha Ryokan" alt="いろは旅館 " address="030-0803 Aomori, Aomori, Yasukata 1-31-21" directions="Right outside Aomori Station East exit behind 'Route Inn'" phone="017-722-8689" url="" checkin="15:00-23:00" checkout="10:00" price="¥4000" lat="" long="">Sato San likes her guests and will take good care of you in this ryokan. For the location is is hard to beat but the facilities are a bit old and spartan.</sleep>

==Contact==
The city tourist information center is located next to the bus stop on the left as you exit the train station; they have good brochures and maps in English.  You can pick up the free '''Northern Tohoku Welcome Card''' [http://www.northern-tohoku.gr.jp/welcome/] here, which gets you discounts on transport and attractions.

==Stay safe==

==Get out==
* [[Hirosaki]], the "Kyoto of the North", is 45 minutes away by train.
* The [[Shimokita Peninsula]], one of the most remote but also one of the most beautiful places in Japan, is a few hours away by train.
* The route from Aomori city to [[Hachinohe]] via [[Sukayu Onsen]] and [[Lake Towada]] is accessible via an infrequent [[Japan Rail]] bus (leaving e.g. 10:10am, noon) which leaves from the terminal (stop 8) outside Aomori Station. This is a picturesque route in a 45-person-capacity bus with a recorded tour commentary in Japan and English, and which also allows day trips to the [[Hakkoda Mountains]]. This area is an hour away by bus from Aomori, and can be hiked via Sukaya Onsen or from the local cable car, which the bus also stops at. The last bus for Aomori leaves from the onsen at 16:58 (cable car 17:08). Lake Towada is also a worthwhile stopping point on the road to or from Aomori. Note that the schedule changes during the winter time: the last stop for the bus will be at Sukaya Onsen, with the last bus leaving at 15:25. A day pass for the bus costs &yen;1,800.
