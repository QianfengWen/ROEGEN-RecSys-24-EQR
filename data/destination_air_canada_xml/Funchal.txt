{{pagebanner|Funchal Banner.jpg}}

'''Funchal''' is the capital and main city of the autonomous region of Madeira, on the island of [[Madeira]], situated in the south between [[Santa Cruz (Portugal)|Santa Cruz]] and [[Camara de Lobos]] cities.

The city's name comes from the abundance of fennel (''funcho'') found on the island. It was an important shipping center during the 15th-17th centuries. It is one of the most beautiful cities in Portugal.

==Get in==

'''Cristiano Ronaldo Airport''' former '''Funchal Airport''' ({{IATA|FNC}}) is in nearby Santa Cruz, sometimes known as Madeira international/Santa Catarina/Funchal. Once famous for its hair-raisingly short runway ending at a cliff over the Atlantic Ocean, the airport has been expanded to handle all sizes of aircraft. There are several daily flights from most major cities in [[Portugal]] (Lisbon, Porto). Flight time from [[Lisbon]] is 1 1/2 hours. Also, there are good connections from [[London]] (mostly Gatwick)(LGW), with TAP/ Air Portugal(TP) and British Airways(BA); its flying time is estimated at 3 1/2 hours.

Funchal is served by highway ER101 which runs along the coast. An easy way to get to the city centre by car is to take exit 11 and head downhill towards Funchal. Continue on this road (ER103) until you pass under an overpass. Immediately on your right is a large parking garage (closed on sundays). From here it is only a few minutes walk to Mercado Dos Lavradores / Sé Cathedral.

From and to the airport you can take the Aerobus, which runs about 10-14 times a day and stops at all major hotels. Tickets can be purchased at the driver (pay by cash), one-way ticket will cost 5 euro (return 8 euro). Schedule [http://www.sam.pt/informacoes-aerobus.html]. It takes about 30 minutes to get the center of Funchal.

==Get around==
The city centre is small enough to explore on foot. Orange city buses can take you around and up to Monte (lines 20, 21). Buy a giro card from the office for 0,50€  and can be topped up with journeys for 1,35€ a piece. At the bus driver you pay 1,95€ for a ride. Most city buses start from the waterfront area. If you are lucky you can acquire a bus timetable for the local and regional buses starting in Funchal at the tourist information. Timetables and a map are also available [http://www.horariosdofunchal.pt/].

The Quinta do Palheiro Ferreiro Park is a typical example of a manor in British colonial style. While the manor itself is private and can't be visited, you can enjoy the public park. On first sight it looks like an English park, old Platanes form a long alley from the main gate to the gardens. But when you look closer you see all the tropical plants that build the basis, completed by hundreds of plants from al over the world. So around the year there ar always some plants blooming. The main part of the park is formed by several gardens, e.g. a French Garden, a Sunken Garden, the Ladies Garden, a Rose Garden and some more. On the opposite of the main gate is a Tea House, which is connected to the golf course. The serve some good tea, cakes, pastries, snacks and small lunches. The way back to the main gate is formed by the Camellia Avenue, a flourish firework between end October and March.<p>
The park is situated on 500m altitude. Between 9 - 11:30 the park is often crowded by bus tourists, choose the afternoon for a more laid-back visit. Entrance fee 10,50€<br>
Public busses frequently connect Funchal with the park: line 36 or, if you have strong nervs, line 37 for a more ''spectacular'' ride. [http://www.palheiroestate.com Palheiro Gardens]</see>

==Eat==
Funchal has an abundance of good, if not necessarily cheap, eating places. Most places serve traditional Madeiran and Portuguese food, which is well-prepared and well-tasting, but not terribly exciting. One of the most typical dishes and served almost everywhere, is ''espada com banana'', scabbard fish with banana. It is usually served with fresh salad and potatoes. A bit more expensive, bacalhau (dried, salted codfish) is served in many restaurants. One of the more common, and best, varieties is "bacalhau com natas", codfish in cream sauce.

==Stay safe==
Funchal is usually a very safe city. However, as in any other places you go, common sense is required.
Probably the unsafest place to go in Funchal is Zona Velha (near the cable car) at night, because it usually gets very crowded because of the nightlife.
Of course crowded places don't mean you'll get robbed, but be careful as sometimes there are pickpockets there.
Beware the pickpockets there and don't go to abandoned dark alleys.

==Get out==
[[Porto Santo]] - A wonderful quiet beach community, Porto Santo is a small island on the North-East of Madeira can be reached by either boat or plane. It is well worth a visit for its nice small restaurants, its long beach, and the Christopher Columbus house.

==Contact==
* '''Internet Access''' - In Funchal there exists a public ''free'' wifi sponsored by the Madeiran government. You'll find a 2m tall white and blue board on several places and squares telling you that wifi is available here. Above that, some bars and cafés offer internet access too. Some spots are here: Praca do Municipio, Avenida Arriaga (2 x around the ''Golden Gate Café'' and the Cathedrale), Praca de Colombo and 3 or 4 more places

* '''Post Office''' - You barely get stamps at the vendors selling postcards. A post office ''(CTT Correios)'' is located near the Cathedrale in the Avenida Zarco and the Rua Calouste Gulbekian near the Casino. Postcards to EU countries are 0,68€ ''(Oct 2010)''
