'''Tokushima''' (徳島) [http://www.city.tokushima.tokushima.jp/english] is the main transport hub of eastern [[Shikoku]]. It has a couple of worthwhile attractions, and its palm-lined boulevards are pleasant enough to pass through on your way to other locations in Shikoku.

==Get in==
===By plane===
Pint-sized '''Tokushima Airport''' [http://www.tokushima-airport.co.jp], to the north of the city, has daily services to [[Tokyo]], [[Nagoya]], [[Fukuoka]] and [[Sapporo]].  Buses to JR Tokushima Station take 25 minutes and cost ¥430. The schedules are synchronized to flight departures/arrivals.

Buses run to the station from [[Kobe]] Airport every 1-2 hours at 55 minutes past (2 1/2 hours, ¥3200). Airport Limousine buses operate from the nearest international gateway, [[Kansai International Airport]] in [[Osaka]] (2 3/4 hours, ¥4000 &mdash; cheaper if you purchase a round trip ticket).

===By train===
From [[Okayama]], take a ''Marine Liner'' rapid train to [[Takamatsu]], then transfer to the ''Uzushio'' limited express for the run to Tokushima (2 hours, ¥4420). Two daily ''Uzushio'' trains run directly from Okayama, with no change of trains required (¥5050). If you are coming from Kansai or the east (i.e. [[Nagoya]] or [[Tokyo]]) then changing to a bus at Shin-Kobe will result in an easier trip to Tokushima - a wise investment for Japan Rail Pass [http://www.jrailpass.com]  holders, even if the pass doesn't cover the bus. (See ''By Bus'' below)

The JR Tokushima Line runs toward [[Ikeda (Tokushima)|Ikeda]] (2 hours), for connections south towards the [[Iya Valley]].

===By bus===
If arriving from [[Kansai]] via [[Awaji Island]], you're pretty much guaranteed to end up in Tokushima. '''JR Bus''' [http://www.kakuyasubus.jp/] operates many services to Tokushima: '''Awa Express''' bus service leaves from [[Kobe]] and Kobe Airport (2 hours from Shin-Kobe station, ¥3200, 15 daily round-trips), [[Osaka]] (2 3/4 hours, ¥3600, 23 daily round-trips), [[Kyoto]] (3 hours, ¥4100, 7 daily round-trips), and on weekends and holidays, [[Nara]] (4 hours, ¥3900, 2 round-trips). '''Keihan Railways''' [http://www.keihanbus.jp/] has its own highway bus that travels to and from [[Kyoto]] and [[Hirakata]].

The overnight ''Dream Tokushima'' bus runs from [[Tokyo]] and [[Tokyo/Shinjuku|Shinjuku]] (10 hours, ¥10000 each way).

===By ferry===

'''Ocean East''' (tel. 03-5148-0109) operates a ferry service between Tokyo, Tokushima and [[Kitakyushu]]. Both the Tokyo and Kitakyushu runs are overnight; passengers can book Western-style bedrooms, bunks, or sleep on the floor. If you're sleeping on the floor, this is one of the cheapest ways to get to Tokushima: Tokyo fares are ¥9310 each way, and Kitakyushu fares are ¥6790 each way. First-class tickets are ¥25,480 on the Tokyo run and ¥17,920 on the Kitakyushu run.

'''Nankai Ferry''' [http://www.nankai-ferry.co.jp/] (tel. 073-422-2156) operates another ferry to [[Wakayama]], which is easily accessible from the [[Osaka]]/[[Kyoto]]/[[Nara]] area. The ferry takes just two hours, costs ¥2000, and runs every 2 hours or so, even in the middle of the night.

==Get around==
The city center is small enough to cover on foot, but bikes can be rented next to JR Tokushima Station (tel +081 088-652-6661, 9AM-5PM) at ¥500 per day.

==Do==
[[Image:Awa Tokushima.jpg|thumb|240px|Awa Dance Memorial Hall]]
* The '''Awa Odori''' (阿波おどり) festival, held August 12-15 annually, is by far Tokushima's largest claim to fame.  With a history of over 400 years, people dance in the streets according to the complex choreography. As the proverb says, "The dancing fool and the watching fool are both fools, so why not dance!" This atmosphere of this visual and aural spectacle is certainly worth a detour to Tokushima if you happen to be in Japan in mid-August, but accommodation can be extremely difficult to secure. 

* '''Mount Bizan''' (眉山) has 1500 cherry blossom trees, making it an impressive sight at blossom time. At the Awa Odori Kaikan, there's a ropeway [http://www.awaodori-kaikan.jp/bizan-ropeway/] (9AM-5:30PM, later during festival periods; ¥600/1000 one-way/round-trip) to the top of Bizan. The walk down takes about 15 minutes.

==Buy==
Tokushima became a major city in part because of '''indigo''', which is used locally to dye beautiful patterns in products from handkerchiefs and scarves to cushions and large door-curtains. ''Otani-yaki'' pottery, with its natural muted colors and rustic-looking shapes, is another popular souvenir, as is handmade paper.

* <buy name="SOGO" alt="" address="1-5 Terashima Honcho Nishi" directions="" phone="+81 088-602-1611" email="" fax="" url="http://www2.sogo-gogo.com" hours="10AM-7:30PM" price=""> Has a Kinokuniya with English-language books on the 8th floor.</buy>

==Eat==

Tokushima is famous for its wonderful strawberries and ''sudachi'', a small round green citrus fruit with a lime-like flavour. In the summer, ''sugata sushi'' is available, wherein a whole small fish is stuffed with sushi rice. Another popular local treat is ''narutokintoki'', a kind of sweet potato.

There are some nice places to eat on the 5th floor of Clement Plaza, which is above the train station, and also in the department stores nearby.
