The twin cities of '''Laredo''' [http://www.ci.laredo.tx.us/], [[Texas]] and [[Nuevo Laredo]], [[Mexico]], which celebrated their 250th anniversary in 2005, are situated on the banks of the Rio Grande. Laredo, which has a population of 207,787, has been governed under seven national flags. Nuevo Laredo has a burgeoning population of 355,827. The twin cities are collectively referred to as Los Dos Laredos. The weather is moderate in winter months around 68째F (20째C) but sizzling in mid-summer around 100째F (39째C).

This city is the commercial hub of the [[South Texas Plains]], which is primarily an agricultural region. It offers entertainment, education, and cultural resources that fit well with its Hispanic heritage. Laredo is one of the fastest growing cities in the [[United States]].

Non-US nationals are recommended to carry their immigration documents with them even if they do not plan on crossing the border into Neuvo Laredo, Mexico. There are check points on your way back from Laredo where they might be asked to show your immigration documents.

Non-US citizen having a valid US visa who decide to cross the border and enter Mexico should be prepared for a long wait at the CBP detention center/check post to get back into US, even with all the necessary documentation. It might not be a pleasant one, but can be minimized by crossing at off hours or by using alternative crossings, such as the Colombia bridge.

==Stay safe==
Laredo, overall, is a very safe city to work or visit.  As in all other border towns, always be aware of your surroundings. Residents of Texas are allowed to carry concealed firearms after a background check, however it is illegal to transport any guns or ammunition into Mexico. Doing so can result spending time in a Mexican jail.

==Get out==
Day trips by car can take you to [[Zapata]] TX (less than 1 hour to the south) for hunting, fishing and nature observation/birding; and to [[Kingsville (Texas)|Kingsville]] (less than two hours to the east) a ranching heritage town, and home of the [http://www.king-ranch/ King Ranch Museum]. Cross over the bridge to [[Nuevo Laredo]] and visit nearby [[San Ygnacio]], [[Camargo City]], [[Ciudad Mier]], [[Ciudad Miguel Aleman]] and [[Ciudad Diaz Ordaz]] for a taste of Mexican history, environment and lifestyles.
