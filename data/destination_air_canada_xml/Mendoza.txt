'''Mendoza''' is a city in western [[Argentina]], in the desert [[Cuyo]] region. Mendoza is the center of the Argentinian wine industry, for which it is world renowned. It is also near the Aconcagua, the highest mountain outside of the [[Himalayas]]. Mendoza is the capital of [[Mendoza (province)|the province of Mendoza]].

==Understand==
Although it is situated in an extremely dry desert region, Mendoza has an extensive artificial irrigation system, which allows for greenery throughout the city as well as the growth of grapes used to make its wines. Most streets have irrigation channels on either side, with bridges for pedestrian and vehicular traffic. These are periodically flooded with water diverted from the river. The approximately 80,000 trees and the wide avenues give the city a beautiful ambience, a change from much of the bare feel of many Argentine cities.

To the immediate west is the Pre-Cordillera of the Andes towering over the city, with peaks at some of the snow-covered (throughout the year) Andes peaks beyond.
 
'''Siesta''' (afternoon nap) is still taken in Mendoza, mostly because of the summer heat. Most businesses close between 12:30 and 13:00, many foodstores do not close until 14:00 The shops then re-open at about 17hs and stay open until 20:30. Supermarkets are usually open 9:00 to 22:00, also on Sundays. Banks are only open Monday through Friday from about 8:00 to 13:00. Casas de cambio (money exchanges) close at 20:00.
===Climate===
Summers are hot and dry in the city. January is particularly hot; temperatures of 40°C (104°F) are not uncommon. However, the lack of humidity (and during summer, the many trees) makes both the heat and cool more bearable than, say, humid Buenos Aires. The nearby mountains are cool, though, even in the summer.

Winters are moderately cold in the city from late June to late August, and very cold in the mountains. Many '''ski centers''' are located near Mendoza (see below "DO").

===By bus=== 
The large bus terminal is about two kilometers from the city center. Taxis and ''remis'' (private taxis) are readily available (US$ 3-4 to the center), or it is a 15 minute walk (not recommended at night, the area between it and the center borders on the red light district).

There are daily bus connections to all major destinations including [[San Carlos de Bariloche|Bariloche]] and [[Santiago de Chile]], a beautiful 7-hour bus ride crossing the [[Andes]]. Santiago de Chile is not always reachable by bus as the Andes pass often closes after heavy snowfall in the winter months, normally around late May to early September (but may be stretching until mid October). The pass may then be closed for a couple of days up to a week. Travelers on a strict timetable (upcoming flight, expiring visas, etc.) should consider this and not go on the last possible day. The first day after reopening of the pass large queues can be expected at the border checkpoints, adding several hours to the journey time. The joint immigration/customs control for both Chile-out-stamps/Argentina-in-stamps (convenient) for entry into Argentina is located at Los Horcones near Puente del Inca, and the one for entry-into-Chile/exit-from-Argentina stamps is at Las Libertadores, also known as Paso Cristo Redentor in Chile, 5&nbsp;km past the tunnel '''(Check the following websites for pass conditions [https://pasosfronterizos.com/paso-los-libertadores.php] (Spanish)'''.

Mendoza has a small international airport, El Plumerillo (airport code MDZ), with flights to Buenos Aires (LAN and Aeroineas Arg.) and Santiago de Chile (LAN), but tickets are very expensive as compared to bus fares (the fares to Chile are more reasonable, as you do not have to pay the foreigner premium for domestic flights). Flights to Salta, Iguazú and Bariloche have started in the 2010, to and from, on Tuesdays , Thursdays and Saturdays, with Aerolineas Argentinas. From the airport, you can take a remis (a type of taxi) for fixed posted prices (as of late 2014, it was 90 pesos to the centre). There is also a city bus (collectivo) that takes you downtown, but it comes only every 40 minutes and takes an hour to make it's way downtown (exact coins only).

Mendoza is a travel hub of sorts for Argentina. If coming from Santiago, you will now have to pay the Argentine reciprocity fees paid by USA and Australia passport holders (if you book your bags through at Santiago, you will not have to pay the similar fees for Chile payable only for entry at the Santiago airport immigration, not for land entry into Chile. As of February 2014, Chile was added to the US Visa Waiver Program and no longer charges a reciprocity fee for entry at any port.).

* 13-17 hours: [[Buenos Aires]]

===By car===
The best choice to rent a car [https://www.welcomeargentina.com/mendoza/car-rental.html].

==Get around==
Central Mendoza is relatively compact and walkable - for example it is a 20-30 minute walk from Plaza Independencia to Parque San Martín, however to get to the bodegas (vineyards) to the south walking isn't recommended as it they are at least 10km away.

A ticket bought in bus or trolley is valid in the other means of communal transportation. 

Buses are cheap and plentiful, but a little confusing at first. Buses have two numbers, a group (Grupo) number, which is the big number at the top of the front of every bus, and a route number, which is two or three digits (i.e. 33 or 114-115) and is on a small sign behind the windscreen. Buses on the same line (eg Grupo 3) all go to ''roughly'' the same place (eg Godoy Cruz) but the route varies by route number - so be careful not to get on the wrong route! Now, you cannot pay cash for bus journeys (2015 MAR), and it is necessary to purchase a Red Bus card (a prepaid proximity card) that you touch-in when boarding a bus. You can buy a Red Bus card from some kioskos near a bus stop and charge them up at the same place. 

There are 5 trolleys, which are part of the same transport system and have the same price, use the same coin machines and RedBus card. A popular run is the Parque circuit, which takes you to the gates of the large (3.2 sq.km) and green Parque San Martin gates every 10 minutes or so, which you can catch on 9 de Julio , Colon or Aristides Villanueva Streets downtown. At the gates, you could also return by catching the circuit at the same stop.

There is also a light train, ''Metrotranvia'', running from the old Mendoza railway station at the corner of Belgrano and Juan B. Justo/Av. Las Heras to the suburb General Gutiérrez, some 15 km southeast of city center. It too uses the general ticket system, and you also you must have a Red Bus card. Information and timetable here: [https://www.facebook.com/TransporteMza '''Horarios Metrotranvia'''].

Taxis are plentiful, metered and fairly cheap, costing about the same as in Buenos Aires. 

You can hire bicycles in town - most hostels can put you in touch with a bicycle hire outfit - prices are negotiable (i.e. they will charge you as much as they think you are willing to pay). You will need some form of ID to leave as deposit. Ask to see and test the bike ''before'' handing over your money - many are old clunkers.

===Adventure and outdoor activities===
Many companies organize trekking, expeditions, horseback riding and whitewater rafting in the desert and the mountains. Also almost all accommodation facilities organize  the different activities only ask them about it. Mountain cabins (bungalows) in areas with spectacular scenery are easily rentable in the city. Remember that tango has an important place in the Argentinian culture, but so does soccer, the wine industry, the gaucho lifestyle and the cuisine.
* <do name="Aconcagua" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="" tags="">America's highest peak Aconcagua (highest in the world outside the Himalayas) provides trekking and climbing possibilities. All travel agencies and backpacker hostels can organize trips - although a considerably cheaper and more flexible option is to take a Buttini bus to the park from Mendoza's bus station. The bus will drop you off at the entrance to buy the entry ticket. To catch the bus back, you'll have to walk back to the Puenta de Inca. You will walk the short interpretive trail and lookout (which will take 45 min), rather than paying the hefty hiking fees past that you need to pay in town at the Provincial Park office in Parque San Martin (depending on how far and how many days you trek). If you want to see the top of Aconcagua, check the weather for the area before going, or you will waste your time and money.</do>
* <do name="Cerro Arco hike" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="">Cerro Arco is located near the town of El Challao, from where many of the most important treks can be started. A pleasant half-day hike easily done independently from Mendoza, offering the great views of both the Andean foothills behind and the vast expanse of Mendoza's plains to the front.  Cerro Acro is the looming mountain to Mendoza's north west, topped with various antenna. It is also used as the base for paragliding. Take bus 114/115 (linea 3) on Sarmiento, just west of the Plaza Independencia, (or Parque San Martin on Av Del Libertador) to El Challao Mirador, at the end of the line 8km to the northwest. There is a clear turnaround at the end of the bus line where you get off. From there walk across from the white nightclub (which is slightly downhill from the road) following the dyke  100 metres, then take an unpaved track further west until you reach a small restaurant / mountaineering museum/ clubhouse - then follow the track to the north (going through the gate). This is a popular hike for Mendocinos at the weekend, but during the week it may be deserted.  You can treat yourself to a hearty asado at the restaurant - although beware that restaurant has two menus, one more expensive than the other!  From the Mirador the hike is about a 3.5 hour round trip. Get out of the area well before dark. In the summer, go early to avoid the worst of the heat, and in the winter bring a jacket, as it can be cool and windy at the top. Afterwards you could visit the aircraft hanger sized church in Challao, a local version of Lourdes.</do>

The most popular destination for biking and wine tasting is Maipu, a short bus (numbers 171, 172, 173 or you can catch the Metrotranvia Train getting off at Gutiérrez (last stop); don't take the white new bus-van Maipu Special service, that cost one extra peso and do not stop in the wineries area) or cab ride out of Mendoza.

== Learn ==
As with many cities in Argentina, there is a variety of Spanish courses and private lessons are available. There are three established language schools in Mendoza: 
'''Ecela Spanish''', located just two blocks from Parque San Martin. Ecela offers private and group classes, and this school also organizes activities within the city as well as excursions during the weekend. Students get the chance to live in a host family as well as immersing in the the Argentinian culture. [http://ecelaspanish.com/spanish-school-mendoza-argentina/]

'''Intercultural''' [http://www.intercultural.com.ar] is the biggest, has a range of afternoon activities, and is slightly more expensive, '''Green Fields Language Center''' (aka COINED) is smaller and feels even less well-organized, but many of the teachers work at both schools.

Another great option for individual or very small tailor-made quality group lessons with a highly trained instructor: '''Spanish in Mendoza, Argentina''' '''(SIMA)''' [http://spanishinmendozaargentina.greenash.net.au/]. This is a better option for those seriously interested in learning or improving their Spanish, although the classes are very enjoyable.

Another interesting way to learn Spanish is by sharing accommodation. For people planing to stay for a couple of months, renting a room in a shared place could be the best option. Prices are reasonable low compared to hostels and hotels.

==Buy==
* The '''wine''' is excellent and can be extremely inexpensive, although in terms of quality you most often get what you pay for. There are several wine boutiques which offer wine tasting. In general, you can buy the same bottles of wine at local supermarkets at lower prices.
* '''Olive Oil'''. Argentina has been producing good quality Olive Oil for generations.
* There are several '''mountaineering and trekking equipment shops''' offering a wide variety of outdoor equipment. A couple of shops are on Av Juan B Justo near Av Belgrano.
* Leather goods are also readily available and inexpensive. There are many shops on Las Heras Av.

==Eat==
Mendoza Restaurants have many good buffets that serve reasonably priced lunches and dinners. Most offer 5-10 meat dishes freshly cooked on a giant grill and a variety of side dishes and desserts. The quality of the food can be quite good and it's an excellent way to try a selection of Argentine food. Good restaurants abound, but be warned that many close between 2pm and 8pm. For a round-up of Mendoza's more expensive eateries ask for the ''Guía Mendoza Gourmet'' from the tourist office. The main restaurant strip is on Aristides Villanueva, which runs east-west from Ave Belgrano (where the defunct railway tracks are) to Parque San Martin. It is difficult to have a bad meal here, although as a general rule be wary of special offers from places near the hostels - they may be cheap, but this shows in the quality. There are also some excellent (and pricey) restaurants on Ave Sarmiento running west from Plaza Independencia. A cluster of cheaper restaurants are on Ave Juan B Justo 

Try world-famous Argentinian beef '''asado''' (roasted) from a '''parrilla''' (grill) restaurant, with a bottle of Mendoza's excellent wine. Beware that they tend to put too much salt in the meat so you cannot really appreciate the taste. Try asking for unsalted steak and then add the desired amount of salt at the table.
Mendoza's most famous wine varieties are the Malbecs from Maipú and Luján de Cuyo. Other good options are Cabernet Sauvignons and Merlots. Restaurants offer small  wine bottles (375 ml).

Even by Argentinian standards, Mendocinans eat late. On weekdays kitchens open around 9PM, but few diners arrive before 10PM. On Fridays and Saturdays things don't get going until 11PM.

==Sleep==
Mendoza is a very liveable city, and many choose to stay for a few weeks to take language courses and the like, there are a number of short-term apartment rental companies, concentrated in microcentro (downtown). You'll find several in 'Galería Independencia' in Lavalle street. An internet search will bring up several scores options, if you know that an apartment is called 'departamento'. Be wary of paying deposits before you arrive as the apartment may not live up to your expectations. Traffic noise can be a particular problem.

The most pleasant part of town is between Avenida Belgrano and Parque San Martin - La quinta Sección, the richest part of town, with quiet streets and well kept neighborhoods, and the bars and restaurants of Arístides Villanueva within walking distance. East of the centre is the more low rent area, and contains the cheaper hostels. Be warned, the below information appears to be rather out of date and is in need of updating.

==Stay safe==
Beware of muggers, especially in the bus terminal and the city blocks surrounding it.

As in many countries, be careful of the vehicles. There is no right-of-way-for-pedestrian at crossings and many drivers will not respect stop-signs (only "transit police" are allowed to enforce these laws, not the mostly-visible standard police officers). Intersections are potential death traps, this cannot be emphasized too much, the vehicles are often driven erratically, fast, & without attention, wandering and without signalling. Look everywhere, and make no assumptions. Especially be careful when there is a bus or taxi approaching from any direction. Many pedestrians choose to jaywalk (a crime not enforced enough here yet) in the middle of the block to avoid endangering their lives and limbs at intersections!

The transit police, who are actually a separate police force in Mendoza City, Godoy Cruz, Las Heras, Maipu, and Lujan de Cuyo, have consistently enforced and increased fines since 2009, for lack of seat belt usage, headlights not on at all times, and talking on the cell phone while driving. These crimes have diminished greatly. Speeding is still rarely enforced on public roads due primarily to lack of local acceptance of radar gun results but renewed efforts are underway in 2013.

==Get out==
Buy your bus tickets out at the terminal or in the street Montevideo, where some larger bus companies have their offices, at least a few days before you leave, especially during the December to March high season, July mid-winter break, and holidays, when bus usage is especially high.
