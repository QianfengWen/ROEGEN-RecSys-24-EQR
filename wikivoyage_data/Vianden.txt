One of Luxembourg's main tourist attractions, Vianden is a delightful historic town with a stunningly restored medieval castle, spectacularly situated on a rock high above town. Think charming cobblestoned streets with typically pastel-coloured Luxembourg mansions and a gorgeous Our valley backdrop. Vianden is a traveller's favourite and although high season will bring in some crowds, it's a most pleasant little town with a restaurant at every corner and all the fairytale atmosphere you could ask for. Coming here, you'll follow in the footsteps of countless celebrities, famously going back to Victor Hugo, who repeatedly spent time here.


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
Vianden's Grand-Rue, the main street.
Vianden's history goes far back, with a Gallo-Roma castellum preceding the current castle. The earliest documented mentions of the town, then called Viennensis, date from the end of the 7th century. Building of the castle began in the 11th century and Vianden soon became the seat of the counts of Vianden, but the city gained its charter only in 1308. The town flourished in the Middle Ages, when it was known for its craftsmen, and later on for its leather works. The last leather tannery closed in the 1950s.
The power of the counts of Vianden was at its peak in the 13th century, and so was the grandeur of their castle. A Renaissance-style structure was added to the castle in the 17th century, but over time the state of the fort diminished with the stature of its lords. As Luxembourg fell under Dutch rule, the town became of little consequence, with earthquakes and a fire further damaging its castle. Things worsened when William I of the Netherlands, uninterested in Vianden and its castle, eventually sold the premises to a local merchant, who in turn sold off its interior piecemeal, leaving the place in ruins. There were several largely unfruitful attempts at restoration, but it was only in the late 1970s that serious repairs took place and the castle was returned to its former glory. For anyone who's interested in the town's history, a visit to the castle is a must-do, as it provides a wealth of information on the matter.

Vianden today[edit]
The St Nicholas Chapel, just across the street from the bridge, originates in the 13th century but was rebuilt in 1724 after a fire.
The revival of the castle immediately turned Vianden into a major tourist destination in the region. With its winding roads and rolling hills, the area around town is particularly popular among motorcyclists, who are welcomed by local establishments for the business they bring. On sunny summer afternoons this town of 2,000 people (2018) can get a bit crowded and noisy because of the many motorbikes and visitors, but early risers will find a peaceful village even in high season.

 Tourist Information Office, 1A, rue du Vieux Marché, ☏ +352 83 42571. Tu-F 08:00-12:00 & 13:00-17:00, Sa Su & holidays 10:00-14:00. The tourist office has information on all the sights in and around Vianden, and it can arrange guided tours and make reservations for hotels or the adventure park. It can also provide information on hiking routes starting in Vianden. 
Get in[edit]




Picture-perfect
There are countless fine images of Vianden's castle, but if you're looking to take your own perfect snapshot, consider stopping half-way down the road into town. Find the point where a few parking places have been created on the left side, when driving down the hill (parking spaces can get very crowded during the summer).


By car or motorcycle[edit]
Most people come here by car or motorcycle. It's a 50 minute drive from Luxembourg city via the N17, with a scenic final approach. Most parking in the village is paid and has a time limit of 3 hours. Your best parking options are near the castle, or immediately left before you enter the village. Some hotels offer basement private parking for motorcycles.
Parking spaces are limited, so during the high season in summer, parking could be challenging.

By bus[edit]
To get here by public transport, e.g. from Luxembourg (city), take a train to Ettelbruck, and then catch the 570 bus at the bus station adjoining the train station. It runs twice per hour on weekdays, but less frequently on weekends, and also stops in Diekirch. The bus trip takes about 35 minutes, or 20 min from Diekirch. Vianden is the second to last stop on the route – ask the driver if unsure. From Luxembourg city, the entire trip takes about an hour and is free, like all public transport within Luxembourg.
There are also two buses to and from Clervaux in the morning, and another two in the afternoon (line 663, takes about half an hour). In season, a bus from the German city of Bitburg runs to Vianden as well.

By plane[edit]
The nearest major airport is Luxembourg Findel Airport. Alternatively, try Frankfurt-Hahn Airport, which is about 120 km from Vianden.

Get around[edit]
The town is small and just walking down the Rue Grande (which does have some vehicular traffic) is a must do. The castle is situated on a rock some 300 m above the town centre. You can drive a good part up the hill and park there, go up by foot, or walk down from the télésiège stop.
The télésiège leads from the river side to a restaurant stop even higher than the castle, providing some lovely views over town. From there, it's a 15-min downhill walk through the forest to the castle; the path is fairly rough and steep, so a reasonable level of fitness and appropriate footwear are required. The télésiège provides return tickets, but if you want to see the castle in one go, you will need to walk the path back up. In that case, buying a single ticket up and strolling down the hill from the castle to town is at least as convenient.

Alternatively, in summer, there's a little tourist train that runs through town and up to the castle, offering a convenient way to reach the castle for elderly or less mobile visitors, or another fun activity for kids. Its ticket office is near the bridge over the Our.

Vianden Castle
The town's Grand-Rue is as much its functional main street as it is an attraction, with its cobblestoned course and centuries-old buildings on both sides. Most buildings remain in use, as hotels, restaurants or residential houses. Particularly picturesque is the Place de la Resistance, along the main street, where you'll find the town hall and a small fountain.

49.9356.2027781 Vianden Castle, ☏ +352 83-41081. Apr-Sep: 10:00-18:00; Mar Oct: 10:00-17:00; Nov-Feb: 10:00-16:00. There's no way to miss the grand castle of Vianden, overlooking and dominating the little town beneath it. It was impressively restored in 1977 and has been a real visitor magnet ever since. A route leads visitors through 20 different historic castle rooms, after passing the modern entrance and soon to be opened visitors centre. Some of the rooms (including the kitchen) have been fully refurbished, in order to give a real peek into life as it would have been in the castle in the middle ages. Others have been restored but leave more to the imagination, including the upper chapel, the impressive Knight's hall and the beautiful Byzantine Gallery. There's an arms room and a genealogy room, where the family history of the castle masters is explained. In short, take your time to wander through these ancient halls. It's a fine trip for adults and children alike. €6, student €4.50, senior €5, child (6-12) €2, children (<6) free.   
49.93396.207832 Maison Victor Hugo, 37, rue de la Gare, ☏ +352 26-874088. Tu-Su 11:00-17:00. During his 19 years of exile from France, Victor Hugo stayed in Vianden a few times, most notably for 3 months in 1871. He left behind a painting of the castle ruins as they were at the time and reportedly got the castle architect fired as he thought his work to be insufficient. The Maison Victor Hugo is a small museum displaying some original works (manuscripts and drawings) as well as the original rooms with furniture as the famous visitor has used it. From the museum windows, there's a lovely view of the castle. Audio guides are available in English, French, Dutch and German. €4 for adults, €3.50 for young people (13-25) and €2.50 for children (6-12). 
The quiet courtyard of the Trinitarian cloister.
49.933236.204883 Trinitarian church and cloister, Grand-Rue, ☏ +352 26-950566. This old church of the Trinitarians is an excellent example of Gothic architecture in the country. It was built as early as 1248, with the large choir originating in 1644. The main Rococo-style altar was created by Michel Weiler in 1758. Adjoining is a small former cloister, from the same 13th century origin. Don't miss a peek in its wonderfully tranquil courtyard. The entrance is a simple door on the side of the building, in the alley between hotel Heintz and the church. Note the late 13th century effigy of Marie de Spanheim. 
 City ramparts. In the Middle Ages, Vianden was a fully fortified town, surrounded by city walls with 24 half-round towers and five gates. Most of those ramparts are now gone, taken down by Marechal de Bouffiers in 1679. A few restored ruins and a bell tower remain, however. Take a quick detour via the small stairway between Grand Rue numbers 58 and 60. It will lead you to the 1603 belfry and some nice views over the village. 
49.933546.202674 Stadtmuseum (Musée d’Histoire de la Ville de Vianden), 96-98 Grand-Rue, ☏ +352 83-4591. Open Easter to Oct., daily 11-17, although in low season it's closed on Mondays. A charmingly small museum, housed in two adjoining buildings on the main street. One of the buildings still has its 19th-century interiors, while the other serves as a bakery museum, with part of the décor of the 1950s bakery that was housed here on display. The house that now has the bakery museum, was once the home of famous poet Edmond de la Fontaine, famous under his pen-name Dicks. A tablet on the façade reminds of the buildings famous former inhabitant. All the text in the museum is in German, but there's an English translation text available on request. The entrance ticket also gives free access to the copper mine museum in Stolzembourg, about 6 km out of Vianden. €3, child €1.50. 
49.956.1780565 Vianden Pumped Storage Plant, ☏ +352 84-90311. 10:00-16:00, Easter-Sep 10:00-20:00. If you have a taste for major industrial sights or large water basins, and would like to get away from the crowds, hike a few kilometres up along the river Our, until you reach the Pumped Storage Plant. It has two large reservoirs and was expanded in 2013. The total reservoir capacity is about 10,800,000 m³, making it the largest hydro-electric power plant in Europe. It has a visitors' centre, which allows a peek into its underground power plant. It's a pleasant walk, along the water, but uphill. Free.   
Do[edit]
49.936336.206251 Télésiège. Take the 11-min chairlift ride up for a scenic view over town or to spare you a fairly steep hike. To get to the start, follow the Grand-Rue down, cross the river and go left. Follow that street and you'll find it after about 500 m. If you only want to go one way, for logistic convenience it's best to take the lift up and stroll down to the castle and then back to the village. In terms of the view, however, going down it's easier to look around and take pictures. Note that as you go upwards and get close to the exit point, a picture is taken of you, with the Our valley and the town as a backdrop. You can buy a copy for €6.50 as you get out. €4.90/3.60 for a return/single ticket. 
 Indian Forest Adventure Park, ☏ +352 83-42571. Mar 30-Oct 31: 10:00-18:00; 1 Nov-29 Mar: W-M 10:00-18:00. Near the castle, the park can be reached either on foot (there are clear signs near the path to the castle, best to park your car at the castle parking) or by taking the chairlift and walking downhill (about 15min). They offer about 60 different climbing routes and courses at different difficulty levels, allowing beginners and children and advanced climbers alike to have a go. It's not just a climbing wall, but rather adventure routes including different kinds of obstacle courses, typically a few metres off the ground. Of course, all participants are secured. Reservations are usually required, especially in high-season. English-language instruction and introduction is available, but limited, so it's best to call well ahead. €18, €13 (5-15), €5 (0-4). 
49.940276.209782 Swimming pool, rue du Sanatorium, ☏ +352 83 45 32. Dive into the heated, 65 m long outdoor swimming pool. This bath with Olympic measures has a slide and is open from the end of May to the beginning of September. €4, €1.50 for children. 
Catch a movie at the Ancien Cinema (see the Drink section for details). It shows a variety of movies and houses a number of books on various aspects of the film industry.
As in all Luxembourg regions, there are great hiking opportunities all around. Taking the chairlift up, the crowds will go left to find their way down to the castle. Go right, however, and you'll walk straight into the forest with plenty of walking trails going on from there.
 Nut market. If you happen to be here the second Sunday in October, you'll be able to join in the charming local nut festival. The Vianden region has a long history of nut productions, most notable walnuts, and this annual festival is a celebration of that tradition. The streets of the village fill with music, lots of walnuts and anything you can make using nuts, from liquor to candy and cheese. 
Buy[edit]
Vianden is a village and for any major shopping you'll need to head out to larger towns in the region, e.g. Diekirch. However, there is a pharmacy and a few small shops to supply travellers' basics like local delicacies, candy, drinks and souvenirs. The castle also has a small gift shop offering the usual tourist souvenirs with images of Vianden castle and Luxembourg as a whole. Remarkably, there's a model car shop in town. ATM's can be found on the main street.

Eat[edit]
Terraces along the river Our make for perfect coffee break spots
Virtually every non-residence building in Vianden, mostly along the Grand-Rue, is some kind of hotel or restaurant, and places to eat are all around. Prices and cuisines vary wildly; you can find everything from €5-7/meal snack bars (hamburgers, chicken patties, fries, etc.) to restaurants serving traditional French and/or German cuisine (€30+). You can also find pizza, pasta, Chinese food, and all manner of desserts.
Some of the best places to eat belong to hotels, with pretty much all catering to guests who are not staying in the hotel as well as those who are.
Note that restaurants tend to close early or even entirely in winter. If you find yourself all out of options, try the snack bar near the tourist office.

 Lajolla Lounge (under Auberge de L'Our), 35, rue de la Gare (Near the bridge). Without doubt one of the nicest terraces in town, right on the waterfront and under street level, so away from the cars. The menu is rather extensive. The service is not too attentive or fast, but still, this is a nice spot for lunch or dinner. The rack of lamb is especially good. From €12.50 for an omelet to >€300 for a ribeye steak. 
 Le Châtelain, 126 Grand-Rue. Part of the Hôtel Oranienburg, this place next to the castle is one of the best restaurants in town.

Drink[edit]
Most restaurants have nice outdoor terraces and you'll be welcome for a drink virtually everywhere.
