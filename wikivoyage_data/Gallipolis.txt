Gallipolis is a village of 3,600 people (2019) in Gallia County, in Southeast Ohio. It is just across the Ohio River from Point Pleasant, West Virginia. 
The name Gallipolis is from the French for "city of the Gauls" because it was  settled by a group of French pioneers known as the "French 500". Most of the French 500 died within a couple years due to their lack of preparedness for life on the frontier, but the city has endured.
