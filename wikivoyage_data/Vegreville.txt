Vegreville is a town of 5,700 people (2016) on the Yellowhead Highway in East Central Alberta, approximately 100 km east of Edmonton. It is home to the world's largest pysanka (Ukrainian Easter egg).


Understand[edit]
Vermillion River
Incorporated in 1906, Vegreville is primarily an agricultural community and has strong historical ties to the Ukrainian immigrant community.
Grand Trunk Pacific's rail line (now Canadian National Railway's Vegreville Subdivision) from Lloydminster reached west through Vegreville to Edmonton by 1909. The GTPR was completed to Prince Rupert in 1914 and financially ruined by 1919. CN79458, a red caboose retired in 1993, is on display in Elks Park off 48th Street.
