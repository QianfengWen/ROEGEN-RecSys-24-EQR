35.28048136.5335481 Yoro Falls (養老の滝). A picturesque waterfall recognized as one of Japan's top 100 waterfalls. There is a legend that long ago a young man who was supporting his elderly father but was very poor. He lamented that he couldn't even buy sake for his father until one day he smelled sake and went to the waterfall. When he tried the water, he realized it was sake. He took it home to his father and when his father drank the sake, it healed his ailments and made him young again. (updated Feb 2024)
Do[edit]
Site of Reversible Destiny: Yōrō Park
35.282102136.5505841 Site of Reversible Destiny (養老天命反転地) (In Yōrō Park). Fall on your arse. No, seriously. Although part of a broader, unfinished vision for Yōrō, this site is for all intents and purposes a theme park where the theme is you, yes you, falling on your butt. Its sloped surfaces and utterly bizarre design is intended to disorient visitors. Try not to miss the pitch-black tunnel system on the northwest side, but don't worry, there's no creepy crawlies living in there! The grand artistic vision is essentially that people rely on their physical senses too little and that peoples' lives can be made to revolve around navigating man-made objects (namely their houses). The gift shop stocks helmets. ¥710. (updated Aug 2020)

Yōrō Park is still open during mild rain, so while it is undoubtedly more fun this way, be careful.
