Banff is a small fishing port in Aberdeenshire in northeast Scotland. It stands on the west bank of the mouth of the River Deveron, with the village of Macduff on the east bank; in 2020 each had a population of about 4000. The main reason to visit is the scenic coastline, dotted with little coves and harbours, and for Duff House which is nowadays a branch of the National Galleries of Scotland.
Sir George Steven (1829-1921), founder president of the Canadian Pacific Railway, was born in Dufftown in Aberdeenshire, and named Banff, Alberta and Banff National Park after this Scottish town. The name "Banff" means a stream, or a holy woman, or a piglet... they've no idea frankly. 


Get in[edit]
Duff House
Stagecoach Bus 35 runs from Aberdeen to Macduff and Banff, taking two hours, and continues to west to Portsoy and Elgin. It runs M-Sa every 30 min as far as Banff, with an hourly onward service to Elgin. 
Watermill Bus 273 runs every two hours M-Sa between Banff, Macduff and Gardenstown. Bus 271 runs once M-F early morning from Fraserburgh. 
Banff lost its railway in 1964. The nearest stations are Huntly and Keith but these lack onward public transport; Elgin is a better option. These stations are all on the line between Aberdeen and Inverness, with trains each way every two hours.
By road the usual approach from the south is via Aberdeen, reached by M90 / A90. The direct route is then A947 cross-country. A scenic coastal route is to stay on A90 to Fraserburgh then take A98 west to Banff. 
You can also approach via Inverness: follow A96 Aberdeen road to Fochabers roundabout then A98 east to Banff.
