San Pedro Garza Garcia
The Western suburbs of Monterrey consist of two municipalities - San Pedro Garza Garcia and Santa Catarina.

Santa Catarina
San Pedro Garza Garcia (often referred to locally as simply "San Pedro") is the wealthiest part of Monterrey, consisting of elegant neighborhoods, glitzy upscale shopping centers, towering high rise buildings and myriad restaurants and international hotels. This is a very modern area with most development occurring since 1997. Development continues to occur as new commercial centers and mixed use centers are in the western part of San Pedro (Valle Poniente). 
Santa Catarina is a low-key, sprawling, working-class neighborhood that is a gateway to La Huasteca and the Cumbres National Park --- magnets for outdoor enthusiasts. Santa Catarina is home to many foreign-owned maquilladoras and industrial plants. Shopping centers and businesses line the main roadways, such as the Carreterra Monterrey-Saltillo. New mixed use development is happening in the eastern part of Santa Catarina, near the boundary with San Pedro.

By plane[edit]
Monterrey International Airport (MTY IATA) is a 40- to 50-minute taxi ride in the northern municipality of Apodaca.

By bus[edit]
Monterrey's Central Bus Station (Central de Autobuses) is about a 30-minute ride, in downtown Monterrey. 
Long distance buses to Saltillo and San Luis Potosi usually travel through Santa Catarina on MEX 40 (Carretera Monterrey-Saltillo). Several of the long-distance bus lines operate small stations along this highway where buses stop to pick up and drop off passengers. If you plan to stay in Santa Catarina or San Pedro, you can use these stations to avoid having to go all the way into el Centro to the main bus station.

Monterrey is surrounded by mountains of the Sierra Madre Oriental range. A huge swath of mountainous terrain constitutes the Cumbres de Monterrey National Park, which extends many miles south. In the Western suburbs, the most popular areas of the park are Chipinque (accessed via San Pedro) and La Huasteca (accessed via Santa Catarina). This is rugged backcountry, rich in opportunies for rock climbing, canyoneering, backpacking, caving, mountain biking, and hiking. Exploring the parks can be an absolute adrenaline rush, but be careful because much of this terrain is not suitable for newbies. Best to go with an experienced guide who will provide suitable equipment and instruction. Gaia Extreme is an established company with an excellent local reputation: they can provide guides and equipment for most of the local area.
