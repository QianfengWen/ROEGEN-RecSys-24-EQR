Lviv (also spelled L'viv; Ukrainian: Львів; Polish: Lwów, German: Lemberg, Russian: Львов), formerly known as Lvov after its Russian name, is in Western Ukraine and used to be the capital of East Galicia. It's the biggest city of the region and a major Ukrainian cultural centre on the UNESCO World Heritage List. There is useful website for tourists visiting Lviv: lviv.travel.


Understand[edit]
The city has a multicultural history but little of the evidence of this has survived until today. It was founded in 1256 by King Daniel of Galicia (Ukrainian: Король Данило Галицький - Korol' Danylo Galyckyy) and fell under Polish control in the 14th century. Poles, Jews, Ukrainians, Germans and others lived there together for centuries. This multicultural experience virtually came to an end during and after WWII. Germans, with the help of Ukrainian collaborators, killed most of the Jews (about one third of Lviv's population at that time) and Poles. At the end and in the direct aftermath of the war, the remaining Polish population (about 65% of the population) was then "repatriated" to Poland in its new borders by the Soviet government. The Polish and Jewish heritage is hardly preserved, but one can find some inscriptions on former shops in Polish, Yiddish and German.
Because of Lviv's proximity to the EU and its openness to foreigners, the city's multicultural feel has experienced a resurgence. Even today, walking through the city centre, a traveller can hear Poles laughing and taking pictures of the beautiful old buildings, Germans walking through the city on guided tours, Ukrainian or Russian tourists and students joking about this or that, and American or British businessmen chatting in cafes. There is even a small Jewish community in the city. The many universities in Lviv attract students from every continent on the globe, and its old architecture draws tourists from various parts of the world, including Ukraine.
The Polish king John II Casimir founded the Lviv University in the 17th century and Lviv (known as Lwów) was by that time one of the most important cities in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, along with Kraków, Warsaw, Gdańsk and Vilnius.
In 1772 the city was taken by the Habsburgs, and in Austrian times it was known as Lemberg, the capital of Galicia. After the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918, it was returned to Poland.
As a result of World War II, Stalin moved the Soviet frontier westward so Lviv became part of the USSR under its Russian name Lvov (still widely used by supporters of Russia, but very offensive to most locals). After Ukrainian independence in 1991, the Ukrainian name of Lviv was gradually adopted in English.
Lviv is the region of Ukraine with the strongest sense of Ukrainian identity. Even when it was part of the Soviet Union, most signs were only in Ukrainian, and only a few also in Russian. Because of its history as part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Lviv has a Central European flair in its architecture that makes it one of the most beautiful cities in Eastern Europe, and also has a Catholic majority, unlike most of majority-Eastern-Orthodox Ukraine. Lviv has even been called "the capital of Ukrainian culture". The people there are very warm, although somewhat direct (which is very common in eastern Slavic cultures).
Since slightly before the Euro 2012 soccer tournament, the city has become more and more tourist-friendly. All downtown street signs are now in both Ukrainian and English, and the staff of the Information Center on Rynok Square speak many different languages. Maps, schedules of local events, and tourist guides can be obtained there for free in English, German, Polish, and Russian. There are even small information kiosks beside some monuments (small touch-screen TVs that offer maps and information about the city). Visiting Lviv is very rewarding for the pioneer traveller, as living is extremely cheap here and the place has a truly authentic feeling, unlike places like Kraków or Prague, which are swamped with tourists.

Money[edit]
For more information on currency see here
ATMs (known as "bankomats") and currency exchanges ("obmin valyuti") are ubiquitous throughout Lviv, particularly in the city center. Most ATMs will accept Visa and MasterCard. Currency exchanges will often only accept foreign currency in pristine condition. Travellers' checks are not very useful in Lviv; however, there are still a few hotels and banks that will cash them for you.
Credit cards are now widely accepted in many of the city center restaurants, cafes, hotels and some hostels. Also at the main bus station and long distance train station. Surprisingly, lots of small grocery stores now also accept plastic.
Attempting to pay for something inexpensive with a large denomination (50 грн and above) will often at the very least annoy the shopkeeper; salespeople may even refuse to sell to you if you do not have any smaller denominations. Grocery stores and other high-volume shops are an exception to this rule.

Bars[edit]
 Hasova Lyampa Bar (Kerosene Lamp), Virmenska 20. You’ll most likely see a man dressed in old time regalia pacing in front of the entrance, beckoning people inside. If he’s not there another greeter awaits in the form of a metal statue sitting at a desk with a... you guessed it, lit gas lamp. Once inside you’ll find a spiral staircase ascending up three flights of dining space. Each floor is cozy, candle lit, and decorated with classic gas lamps. Gas Lamp also has one of Lviv’s best patios, in the form of their rooftop dining section. While the entrees are standard, the snacks that go with beer are real standouts.

If you’re lucky, a “Russian spy” may have snuck in to the restaurant and the brave staff will turn off the lights, grab a flashlight, root out this spy and serve him a healthy portion of justice.

Depending on the nights festivities you may have to pay a small cover charge, but it’s well worth it, as early evening acts often include international Jazz bands, and late evening events often fall into the feverish dance music category. Descend a flight of stairs past a little merchandise stand to the cavernous first room. Sit down at a long beer garten style table and order a giant stein of the Lvivske beer. The name, Robert Doms comes from the man who founded the brewery in 1715 (also the name of their signature brew). The underground location and stone walls give Robert Doms Beer House great acoustics and an intimate feel. Or, if you’re not in the mood for music, head to the adjoining Austrian style pub room. Plush, wooden and well lit, this is a great place to watch a game of football with friends as the giant TV at the end of the room has a habit of sucking in people's attention. 
 Kumpel beer restaurant, Vynnychenka 6 (on Mytna square). Mini-brewery. 
Franz Josef The twilight zone. 24-hour outdoor freak show. See the local intelligentsia acting rather unintelligent.
 Dublin Irish Pub, Kryva Lypa 5, ☏ +380 322 616171. M-Th 12:00-00:00, F Sa 12:00-02:00. In the busy courtyard just off Doroshenka St. The name is written in Cyrillic as well as Latin. Staff do not speak English but the menu is in English. Live soccer on TV. 
 Korzo Irish Pub, Brativ Rohatinskiv street (off the main Rynok). Though it may sometimes seem like it, not every bar or restaurant in Lviv has some kind of theme or hook, and Korzo Pub is one of these places. - Nothing too fancy here, just an oak bar, brass taps and well worn tables that have eavesdropped on hundreds of conversations, arguments and romantic encounters. Korzo also has a great selection of international spirits, so if you’re the kind of person who needs a shot of tequila to get the night going, this is your place. As the beer flows, you might want to try the fish soup, hearty and robust, locals say it is the perfect ballast to prevent a hangover the next morning. If quenching your thirst on a sunny afternoon of exploring is your goal, Korzo has one of Lviv’s largest patios. 
Clubs[edit]
The club scene in Lviv is thriving; with many options ranging from the cavernous clubs Metro and Millenium to the intimate and upmarket Zanzibar. There are usually entry charges but drink prices more than make up for this. In most clubs you are able to buy bottles of vodka for a reasonable price and simply chill at a table all evening.

 Fashion Club, Ivana Pidkovy Square, 1, ☏ +380 67 374 4491. Open 24 hours. Bizarre nouveau riche. 
 Club Metro disco (Нічний клуб), Zelena 14 (outskirts of the centre), ☏ +380 32 242-0788. Metro isn’t the easiest place to spot during the day, but at night, just follow the hordes of fabulously dressed young people as they make their way there. Entrance will probably set you back about 120 грн and once inside the first thing you’ll see is a large disco. A raised platform in the centre of the dance floor features male and female go-go dancers (and any brave customers who decide to join them on stage). A bar opposite provides local beers, vodka and champagne. For a change of pace, head downstairs where you’ll find two more bars. One serves the techno and house room, the other the lounge, private rooms and the hip hop dance floor. To cool off from all of the dancing, hit the giant upstairs patio with its heat lamps during winter and umbrellas for those rainy Lviv nights. (updated Sep 2023)
 Pozitiff, 14 Zelena St., ☏ +380 32 294905. If you’ve been to Metro Club you may have noticed a long line of locals trying to gain access to Pozitiff. This place is not easy to get into, and there are no guarantees that your money, passport or even begging can ensure you gain entrance. It’s all the bouncers call. Your best bet is to arrive with a small group of the most attractive people you can find. At this point the door man will either let you in, or not. If he does you’ll have negotiate an entrance fee. This cover charge usually depends on how cool and attractive your group is: The better-looking, the lower the fee. Expect to pay close to 240 грн for entrance. As entrance is so difficult, some patrons make the most of their trial, floating through the bar mingling, chatting and flirting. Others, displaying the icy confidence that got them in in the first place simply recline in their booth and radiate cool. No matter how you choose to play this one you’ll find enough friendly professionals to chat with and if you need to check your email, the Internet café section remains operational even into the wee hours of a rocking party.

Stay safe[edit]
Ukrainian cities are not dangerous, though a bit more precaution is required.
Common tricks include impersonating a police officer. In doubt ask an officer or tell him you're not following him. The first thing they try is to get you out of the tourists places in to areas where they can 'acquire' a fine.
Open robbery happens less as the risks are bigger. However, pick-pockets operate in the historical center, so keep an eye on your belongings.

Cope[edit]
It can be very helpful to learn some Ukrainian before visiting, or at least the Cyrillic alphabet. Everyone can also read, speak and write in Russian, although they'd appreciate that you learnt a few basic phrases in Ukrainian as well. German and, especially, Polish (as Lviv used to part of Poland) is spoken well among people with mature memories of the interwar era. Especially if you speak Polish surviving in Lviv shouldn't be a problem, as many people understand it since it's quite close to Ukrainian.
People selling you tickets at the train station might not speak anything other than Ukrainian or Russian and may not have any patience or sympathy for you. Queues in Ukraine tend to be a chaotic mess, especially at stations. Assert your place with an elbow and mean stare, because everyone else will, including the 15 babushki pushing you to the side.  Make sure you get in the line for foreigners when you want to buy train tickets. The cashier might not speak English, but if you know the details of the train you want, just write them down!

Go next[edit]
Kyiv
Odesa
The Carpathian Mountains and their accompanying ski resorts are good for a day trip
Lutsk
Rivne
Transylvania, Romania: To go south, take a bus to Chernivtsi (a bumpy 6½- hour ride, or you can take one of overnight trains).
