Broel Towers along the River Lys
Kortrijk (French: Courtrai, sometimes referred to in English as Courtray) is a city in Flanders, the northern part of Belgium. It is the capital and biggest city of the arrondissement of Kortrijk, which has about 285,000 inhabitants (2014). The wider municipality comprises the city of Kortrijk proper and the towns of Aalbeke, Bellegem, Bissegem, Heule, Kooigem, Marke, and Rollegem.
The city is on the Leie River, 42 km (26 miles) southwest of Ghent and 25 km (15 miles) northeast of Lille in France. Kortrijk and Lille are part of the same transnational Eurodistrict urban area with around 1,900,000 inhabitants.
As the biggest city of southern West Flanders, Kortrijk has many schools, a university, hospitals and shopping streets.


Understand[edit]
Kortrijk is a medium-sized city with a good balance of tradition and innovation/modernism. It has always been famous for shopping, and in 2010 a big shopping centre was opened in the heart of the city. There are traffic-free shopping zones, and lots of historical sites in the city centre. Outside the centre there are some less developed neighbourhoods, though none are really bad.
Kortrijk is a rather safe city. Suburbs/satellite cities like Menen have to endure mainly burglary criminality from youth and gangsters, but Kortrijk is rather safe.
The city is known as the Guldensporenstad (City of the Golden Spurs), after the battle of the Golden Spurs in 1302. It used to be the centre of the linen industry and is still known as an important textile industry region.

Talk[edit]
As Kortrijk is a part of Flanders, the main language is Dutch. Many of the inhabitants will be happy to answer you in English or if you ask beforehand, in French, although automatically starting a discussion in French could offend some of the locals. Some older people speak a little German.

Get in[edit]
Grote Markt with Sint Maartenskerk
By train[edit]
The 50.8244793.2644461 Kortrijk Railway Station is in the centre of the city. Kortrijk is an important node in Flanders' railroad network.

Direct connections from Brussels and Ghent. Kortrijk is 1 hour and 20 minutes away from both Brussels and 26 to 35 minutes from Ghent, depending on the type of train you take. So make sure to take the quicker train, unless you like to spend time in trains.
The French city of Lille is a train ride of 40 minutes away from Kortrijk. Occasionally, this will require a change in the Belgian/Walloon border town of Mouscron. Kortrijk can also be reached from Lille by taking a Tournai train and changing at Froyennes.
There are also direct connections to and from Ghent and Bruges. The train covers the distance in 50 minutes to 1 hour and 10 minutes.
High speed train lines do not stop in Kortrijk. There is a direct connection to the Lille Flandres and Lille Europe train station (30 minutes by train) however. Accessing Kortrijk from England/Paris through stopping in Lille is easier and quicker to do than going to Brussels and taking the regional train in Brussels.

By bus[edit]
Next to the train station there is a large bus station, giving access to regional bus lines and a well-constructed city bus network. The Flemish national bus company, De Lijn, has lines to Kortrijk from Mouscron, Roeselare, Waregem and other neighbouring towns. For more information regarding different timetables (only available in Dutch): https://www.delijn.be[dead link].

The typical place to party is the end of the Burgemeester Reynaertstraat close to the station. By the local public this is called 'Het Straatje', which stands for 'the little street'. This is a typical place for going out on Thursday night and in the weekend. There are around seven bars, which typical have loud music and are for dancing.
If you're keen to enjoy a quiet drink, a place to go is the Vlasmarkt, on a minute walk from The Belfry. A handful of bars there are very nice designed and enjoyable to visit, and usually, they are less expensive then the bars on the Market Place. This place is frequented by locals.

Kortrijk had in the 1980s some places where "alternative" , "non-conformist" music could play. For various reasons those places stopped doing that and some locals decided it was their time to set things up. After 27 years more than 2000 bands have played; most part in The Pit's and some on other stages under various co-organisations. This is rather a huge achievement for a completely volunteer run organisation. Among the bands who played are: Drive Like Jehu, GO!, Crowbar, Eyehate God, Rancid, Nations on Fire, The Mummies, Antiseen, New Bomb Turks,Supersnazz, the Spits, the Locust, Dead Moon, Groovie Ghoulies, Killdozer, Deadbolt, D.O.A., Strychnine, Zeno Tornado....
