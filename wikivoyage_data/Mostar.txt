Old town of Mostar
Mostar   is a city in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Much of the city has been rebuilt and visitors might be surprised to see that this formerly war-torn city is a lively and beautiful destination once again, particularly the area within and around the old town. However, many visible signs of Mostar's troubled  history in the 1990s remain.


Understand[edit]
It used to be one of the most ethnically diverse cities in the country, and today it suffers geographical division of ethnic groups. The city was the most heavily bombed of any Bosnian city during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina following the breakup of Yugoslavia. At the beginning of the war, air strikes destroyed many important buildings and structures, including  the cultural and spiritual icon: the Old Bridge (Stari Most), which is a  UNESCO World Heritage Site.
Mostar has been most famous for this beautiful historic Ottoman-style bridge, which spanned the Neretva river in what is considered the historic centre of the city. Through combined efforts with the international community, rebuilding of the Old Bridge was completed in 2004, almost 11 years after its destruction, using some of its original stones recovered from the Neretva river.

43.3416817.816353 Muslibegovića House (Muslibegovića kuća) (located near the Karađoz Bey’s Mosque). Open for visitors 15 April – 15 October from 10:00-18:00. Constructed 300 years ago, it is considered the most beautiful Ottoman period house in the Balkans. The house comprises separate quarters for women (women’s courtyard – haremluk) and men (men’s courtyard – selamluk). Unlike earlier architectural styles, this is a four-storey house built around the centre. Double-arched entrance with the central pillar reveals Mediterranean influence.

Small but pretty Ottoman mosque built in 1618 that was destroyed during the war but rebuilt with Turkish financial support. Climb the minaret for spectacular views over the town.

Do[edit]
43.3377417.815191 Watch locals dive off the Old Bridge. Members of the Mostar Diving Club will dive off the bridge into the emerald green waters, but first they will try to collect some money from tourists. Do not attempt this yourself. The waters of river are at a constant 12°C, and going suddenly from 30°C to 12°C can cause a heart attack among even the fittest. The young local men diving would hose themselves down first in order to lower their body temperature before diving. The best place to watch this is below Old Bridge on shore of Neretva river. 
43.3388617.809252 Walk Along the Former Front-line, on Bulevar Revolucije. Here, in 1993 the city was divided between Croats on the west and Bosniaks on the eastern side.

43.3378517.80873 Zvonik mira (Bell Tower). Visible wide around the city. Take the elevator up the bell tower next to Sveti Petar i Pavao. 6 KM. (updated Oct 2022)
Drink Bosnian coffee. Don't let anyone tell you that Bosnian coffee is the same as Turkish coffee. Instead, let the good people of Cafe de Alma (Rade Bitange not far from the bridge) educate you about this distinct way of preparing coffee. They are the only roasters in town and they are passionate about preserving this tradition. The café will serve your coffee in a traditional coffee set, plus a Turkish delight to sweeten your drink, all for 2 KM. Before you drink your coffee, the staff will explain to you how it is prepared and how best to enjoy it.

Ancient Stjepan-grad fort (Počitelj in Čapljina) near Mostar
Day trips[edit]
Many of these areas are hard to reach with public transport; however, transfers with bigger taxi companies are cheap (somewhat controlled) and several agencies offer guided tours.

43.13333317.7333331 Počitelj  - a well-preserved walled town (municipality of Čapljina) dating back to 1383 that is 35 km south of Mostar. It is reachable by public transport by taking yellow bus #41 towards Čapljina for around 30 minutes. Excellent view of the Neretva River. During the Middle Ages, Počitelj was the administrative centre and centre of governance of county Dubrava župa. The town has a few small restaurants, coffee shops and street vendors selling local grown fruits and souvenirs most of the year.
43.25742717.8946682 Blagaj  - a village 12 km southeast of Mostar. It is reachable by public bus 10/11/12 in 20-25 minutes (2.1 KM, stops in Španski trg in front of the Gimnazija). The bus may leave from the road opposite the main station, not the bus station itself, but can be caught at several stops in the city. At Blagaj, a karst river flows out of a mountain. It's very beautiful, with deep blue water. A historic tekke is built into the cliff (entrance 10 KM). Women must wear headscarves to enter the tekke. Trout are farmed in the river, and several excellent restaurants serve trout with seating on the riverbank. There is an impressive ancient fort with amazing views on top of the mountain. The area around the fort is dotted with countless pomegranate trees—so being there in fall, you will have a delicious time. To reach the fort, follow the road past the village's old town and then ask where the trail starts, or just follow the road (keep right) to where the road swerves left (you'll see several ancient gravestones) and you'll find the path on your right. The trail is about 2 km. You can pitch your tent in the fort or in one of the numerous campsites in Blagaj directly adjacent to the Buna river. Velagićevina (the Velagić family House) was built in 17th century and is a beautiful example of the Ottoman residential architecture, a one-storey structure with typically extended porches. In the vicinity there are also old flour mills that were powered by the strong Buna River.
43.19015917.677863 Međugorje, 25 km from Mostar, is exceptionally popular among catholic pilgrims due to an alleged apparition of the Blessed Virgin Mary to youths in the town. Buses depart from the bus station every few hours.
43.08388917.9591674 Stolac  - an old Ottoman town with the medieval cemetery of Radimlja (Nekropola Radimlja), the Illyrian site of Daorson and the palaeolithic cave painting at the Badanj Cave (Pećina Badanj).
43.1558317.608335 Kravica  Waterfall gorge, 25 km north of Mostar, is popular for outdoor sports such as biking, hiking, canyoning and climbing. The Drežanka River is a tributary of the Neretva, and the two rivers join in an artificial hydropower lake. Take a bus in the direction of Drežnica; there are buses which go to the end of the gorge, Gornja Drežnica. Or take the train in the direction of Sarajevo and get off at train stop Drežnica, approx. 30 min. There are several camp sites and basic accommodation, although you will need your own sporting equipment.
