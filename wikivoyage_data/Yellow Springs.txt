Yellow Springs is a village in Southwestern Ohio. It is home to Antioch College.

Yellow Springs in the Glen Helen Nature Preserve
The Village of Yellow Springs was founded in 1825. It was named for a natural spring rich in iron ore in Glen Helen. Legend has it that if you drink from the spring you will always return.
In the conservative stronghold of Southwest Ohio not far from a major air force base, Yellow Springs has the reputation for being an island of left-wing activism supported by its small liberal arts school, Antioch College.  Some locals go as far as to call it the Berkeley of Ohio.  When school is in session, people watching is an interesting event given the personalities this college attracts.
The Village offers some of the best dining in the Dayton area, along with several artisan groups and a downtown bustling with side-walk shops. All of this lies a short distance from Ohio's best natural area, including John Bryan State Park[dead link] and Glen Helen.
The Village can get quite congested on warm-weathered weekends, but nearly all of its attractions are open during weekdays, which offer less in the way of crowds. As of the 2000 census the population was 3,761.
