Joggins is a small town in the Minas Basin region of Nova Scotia. It is known for its fossil cliffs, which date to more than 310 million years ago and are a  UNESCO World Heritage Site.


Understand[edit]
The cliffs have fossils from the Carboniferous period, from the end of the Devonian "Age of Fishes" (roughly 360 million years ago) until the start of the Permian (300 million). Plants began to emerge from sea to land in the Devonian and most coal is from the Carboniferous era by which time huge forests had developed. Joggins was originally a coal mining town.
The Carboniferous was the main era when animals emerged onto land. Joggins has many amphibian fossils and the oldest known reptile fossil.
