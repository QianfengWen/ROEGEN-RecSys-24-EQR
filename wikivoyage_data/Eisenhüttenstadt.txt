Understand[edit]

Eisenhüttenstadt was founded as Stalinstadt in the 1950s in the eastern part of communist East Germany to house the employees of an iron works (Eisenhütte) nearby. It was named after Soviet premier Joseph Stalin. After he died and new Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev dismantled  Stalin's cult of personality, Stalinstadt was united with the pre-existing city of Fürstenberg to form a new municipality under the de-Stalinized name of "Eisenhüttenstadt".
The town has had the same problems after 1990 as most towns of its size in the former East Germany, including unemployment, young people moving out, and low birth rates. Its unique history and architecture make it a somewhat undiscovered destination for tourism. While the name may be challenging if you don't speak German, it means "Iron Hut City". Locals often shorten it to "Hütte" in daily conversation.

Eisenhüttenstadt's first restaurant, conceived by the city planners as Großgaststätte for the workers residing here. Nowadays, only the building's left wing is used as restaurant, however one can still marvel at the intricate interior design while sitting in comfortable satin arm chairs and enjoying a traditional German meal. In stark contrast, your food will be delivered by a robot (still a rare sight in Europe's restaurants, let alone in Germany) with a cat face – but don't worry, the plates will be put on your table by the friendly staff who'll also be the ones serving your drinks. From approx €12 (mains). (updated Mar 2023)
