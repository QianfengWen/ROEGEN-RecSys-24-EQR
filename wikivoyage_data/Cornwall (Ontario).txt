Cornwall is a city of about 48,000 people (2018) on the St. Lawrence River in Eastern Ontario.


Understand[edit]
Lamoureux Park Walkway
Cornwall is on the St. Lawrence Seaway, opposite Massena and Rooseveltown, New York. The 1958 seaway eliminated rapids upstream at Long Sault, opening a path for large ocean-going vessels from the Great Lakes at the expense of inundating and destroying several small villages (such as Aultsville and Moulinette). Some historic buildings which were displaced from the Lost Villages are now at Morrisburg (Upper Canada Village) or Long Sault (Ault Park); islands along what is now the Long Sault Parkway were once part of the Canadian mainland. Long Sault and Ingleside are planned communities to house displaced villagers.
Cornwall-Massena is the home of a large hydroelectric generating station (with visitor's centre) and large ships may be viewed transiting the Seaway locks. Much of the city's industrial base is now gone, as is the pollution associated with Cornwall-Massena in the 1970s.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Cornwall is on Highway 401 (exit 789), about one hour west of Montreal and two hours east of Kingston. As Ontario's easternmost city, Cornwall appears as a control city on highway signage for over a 160 km (100 miles) from Kingston (exit 611) eastward.
From Montréal, Autoroute 20 west becomes Ontario 401.
From Ottawa-Hull, take the Trans-Canada Highway 417 to Casselman, then turn south on Ontario 138.

By train[edit]

Between Montreal and Toronto including stops in Dorval, Cornwall, Brockville, Kingston, Belleville, Cobourg, and Oshawa. Operates multiple times daily.
Travellers from Ottawa can reach Cornwall by connecting through Kingston. It is possible to shorten the trip by transferring at Brockville instead; however Via does not guarantee this connection and both legs have to be booked separately.
By bus[edit]
45.0541-74.77842 Megabus Cornwall bus stop, 3250 Brookdale Ave (immediately north of Highway 401). Megabus (Coach Canada) serves Cornwall from Montreal and Toronto. The Cornwall intercity bus stop is located at the Irving 24 Service Center on Brookdale Ave.   (updated Feb 2021)
 417 Bus Line. Commuter bus service from Ottawa. Tickets must be purchased in cash from the bus driver. (updated Apr 2023)
By plane[edit]
The closest major airport is Montréal-Trudeau YUL IATA, from which direct onward connections are available by rail from the Dorval commuter train station. Ottawa also has a major airport, but Ottawa-Cartier (YOW IATA) is no closer than Montréal and lacks Dorval's relatively easy air-to-rail connection.
There is a tiny airport in Massena with a few federally-subsidised US flights daily to Albany.

45.0928-74.56783 Cornwall Regional Airport (YCC  IATA), 19403 Airport Road, 19403 Airport Road, ☏ +1 613-930-6625, cyccmanager@gmail.com. Cornwall Regional Airport does not have scheduled service - it can only handle general aviation with a maximum of 15 passengers. However, it is an airport of entry and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency on a call-out basis.   (updated Feb 2021)
By seaway[edit]
Cruising on small craft is an option on the St. Lawrence Seaway, but there is a minimum length at the locks (about 20 ft, which excludes some small boats which can be carried by auto trailers) and the huge "Seaway Max" ships are given priority - one of these leviathans fills an entire Seaway lock with only inches to spare.
As the Seaway is fresh water and the Cornwall-Massena border is 45°N (halfway to the North Pole), shipping through the locks is inherently seasonal, typically ending in December and re-opening near the end of March.
