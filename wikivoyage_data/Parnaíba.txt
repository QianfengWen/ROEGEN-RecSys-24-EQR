Parnaíba is a city in Piauí. Most tourists pass by here for visiting the river delta, or on their way between Lençois Maranhenses and Jericoacoara. However, Parnaíba has its own charm, including nearby beaches, and could be worth a couple of days.


Get in[edit]
By bus[edit]
View from Salt Rock Beach
A modern bus terminal lies on the southeastern outskirts of the city, where Rua Ceará Chaval and Avenida Deputado Pinheiro Machado intersect, about 5 km from the center. Most long distance buses are handled by Expresso Guanabara.

To Teresina (5 hours) via Piripiri (2½ hours) every 2-3 hours.
To Tutóia (from where you can move on to Paulino Neves and Lençóis Maranhenses) by São Francisco or Continental. R$ 14, 3 hours bumpy ride. This bus stops by the companies´ own bus station near the center, and waits there for half an hour before continuing.
There is also a flourishing market for "alternative" buses, at somewhat discounted prices, by the downtown end of Avenida Capitão Claro (a continuation of Avenida São Sebastião).
