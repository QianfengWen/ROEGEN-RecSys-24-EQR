Wroxham and Hoveton are two towns in Norfolk separated by the River Bure. They are connected by a road, foot and rail bridges. Wroxham is unofficially often known as "Capital of the Broads", though in practice Hoveton has the vast majority of marinas, boat yards and boat hire centres, and most of the commercial activity.


Understand[edit]
Wroxham Bridges

The Broads are an important aspect to the area and both towns have "their" broads 52.69861.41841 Wroxham Broad and 52.69481.42882 Hoveton Great Broad & 52.70581.44943 Hoveton Little Broad.
Both towns have a lot for tourists are can get quite busy during the height of summer. The River Bure from the town and downstream can also get busy through high season.  However, the road bridge connecting the towns is quite low and upstream the river is generally quieter as the larger cruisers are unable to get under the low bridge.
