Grimsby is a town of about 27,000 people (2016) in the Niagara Peninsula region of Ontario.


Understand[edit]
It is named after the English fishing town of Grimsby in north-east Lincolnshire.

History[edit]
The town of Grimsby was founded in 1790 as Township Number 6 after a group of United Empire Loyalists fleeing persecution in the United States settled at the mouth of 40 Mile Creek in 1787. It was later called 'The Forty'. Robert Nelles, a politician and later lieutenant-colonel in the War of 1812, was one of the town's founders. His home on Main Street West was used for many planning sessions during the war. In 1816 the village became known as Grimsby, the name of the surrounding township. Canada's first Chautauqua was established in 1859 in Grimsby Park and Beach, but by 1900 interest had declined, and by 1909 it had ceased.
The town has gone through many changes, from being a small rural village; to a centre for the manufacture of farm machinery, hospital furniture, furnaces and other metal products; and later the hub of the Niagara Peninsula's fruit-growing industry. Grimsby also had a successful fishing industry which lasted until the 1960s. With a number of wineries and distilleries, Grimsby now serves as the starting point for touring the Niagara wine region.

Climate[edit]
Grimsby's climate varies throughout the year; 12-15 °C in the spring, 21-33 °C in the summer, and 10-17 °C in the autumn. Temperatures in the winter months vary between 4 °C and −16 °C, with about 190 cm of snow per year.
