The city of Presidente Prudente was named after President Prudente de Morais, who was a Brazilian lawyer and politician, first governor of the state of São Paulo (1889-1890). With the great economic crisis of 1929, the economy of municipalities linked to coffee production suffered great shock and Presidente Prudente introduced economic activities such as the cultivation of cotton. The industrialization of the city began in the mid-1930s.
In the 1940s much of the usable land in the area was made up of pastures. The increasing importance of cattle ranching in the High Sorocabana region was accomplished by deforestation. The correlated industrial activities in the early days of logging, turned to the transformation of raw materials, mainly offered by cattle breeding.

Stay safe[edit]
Prudente is like other cities in Brazil, there are points of greatest risk, safer ones. The city does not have pockets of poverty, and slums in uneven areas. There are so poor neighborhoods, distant and more prone to drug trafficking and crimes, but the city, luckily and public security actions, does not have major points of intorpecentes consumption. However the locals consider the relatively quiet town.
The region has a lot of prisons, especially since the closure of the Carandiru Prison in the capital in 2002. Over the years the city became an important center for monitoring and Civil Police Military Intelligence and the State of São Paulo, since the major heads of criminal organizations are in Region prisons.
The traveler should be aware in remote places, especially at night. Stay in well-lit and busy places. Avoid walking after 23:00 on weekdays, in Downtown and Parque do Povo area. Use only in case of necessity the public toilets in the evening Parque do Povo, as these sites become places of prostitution and drug users. Another point to be avoided is the region comprising the Bus Station and Urban Terminal as it is a place of prostitution and customarily occur armed robbery.
Taking the necessary precautions tourists will always be safe in the city. If you need to contact the local police for points-to-face and telephone service in addition to the "190" of the PM.
