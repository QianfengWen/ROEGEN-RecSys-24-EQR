Saint-Louis is a city and a world heritage site on the Grande Cote in Northern Senegal, at the mouth of Senegal River which serves as the border with Mauritania. With some 259,000 inhabitants (2021), it's the country's eighth largest city.


Understand[edit]
Colonial architecture in old Saint-Louis.
The city of Saint-Louis is about 260 km north of Dakar on the coast and spreads across the mainland (Sor), Île de N’Dar (the Island), and the Langue de Barbarie Peninsula. The mainland is connected to the historical island, which is just 2 km long and 400 m wide, via the Pont Faidherbe Bridge, which was rebuilt in 2011.
The Île de N’Dar is linked to the Langue de Barbarie Peninsula via the Pont Mustapha Malick Gaye Bridge; the peninsula is home to the beautiful beaches of the Hydrobase as well as part of Langue de Barbarie National Park. Also accessible from Saint-Louis are the Parc National des Oiseaux du Djoudj and the Réserve Spéciale de Faune de Guembeul.
Saint-Louis was founded in 1659 as a fortification and was known as St-Louis-du-Fort to distinguish it from other places with the same name in the French Empire. The area had already earlier been an important trading point, but the island where the colonial city was founded was uninhabited as natives thought it was haunted.
During the age of colonization, in the 17th and 18th centuries, the town changed hands between the French and British a couple of times, and became one of the most important cities in West Africa, both culturally, economically and politically. It served as the capital of French West Africa until 1902, and capital of French Mauritania until 1957. Today Saint-Louis is more of a regional center, but the world heritage-listed old town reflects its glorious past.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Saint-Louis has an airport, but there are no flights as of February 2020. The nearest major airport is the one in Dakar.

By car[edit]
If you have your own car, from Dakar take Route N2 all the way to Saint-Louis. It is approximately 260 km from Dakar.
At Dakar Airport you can hire a car with or without a guide/driver. Prices with a guide start at roughly CFA 20,000 per day and increase depending on quality of the vehicle.

By bus[edit]
The easiest way to get to Saint-Louis from Dakar is in a sept-place, which is a seven-passenger station wagon.  They leave from the main station in Dakar (also called Pompier).  You wait at the station for the car to be full, which means the rest of the passengers are heading for Saint-Louis as well, so it's a direct trip.  The going rate is about 5000 CFA.  To rent out an entire sept-place it should cost about CFA 33,000-35,000.
Mini cars (vans) from Gare Pompier in Dakar to St. Louis (tourists on a tight budget): mini cars cost CFA3,500 from Dakar to St. Louis and you would have to pay a small amount for baggage (CFA 100-500 maximum for most suitcases or bags).  Carry valuable items with you personally – not in baggage which will be carried elsewhere.  Sometimes things of value inside can go missing. Also prepare yourself for a long day.  These cars have a top cruising speed of about 50 km/h and make frequent stops.
Ndiaga Ndiaye (pronounced jegg-in-jaay) (big white Mercedes buses) from Gare Pompier in Dakar to St. Louis (Tourists on a tight, tight budget): Ndiaga Ndiaye cost CFA 2,500 from Dakar to St. Louis and you will have to pay a small amount for baggage (CFA 100-500 maximum for most suitcases or bags).  Carry valuable items with you personally – not in baggage which will be carried elsewhere.  Sometimes things of value inside can go missing.  Also prepare yourself for a long day.  These buses have a top cruising speed of about 50 km/h and make frequent stops.  They can also take several hours to depart considering that they fill all the seats before departure.  Always look inside and count the seats which are open before paying for your pass.  Operators often lie about how many seats are left in order to get more clients and you could end up waiting for hours at the gare, which is not always pleasant.
Senegal Demm Dikk runs air conditioned buses from Dakar to Saint-Louis departing in the morning. These are comfortable and ultimately not much more expensive than taking a Sept-Place. 

By taxi[edit]
You should be able to get a personal taxi from Dakar airport to St. Louis or Mouit for around CFA 60,000  depending on the condition of the taxi and negotiation skills. (4 people maximum.)

By train[edit]
Although there are tracks and a colonial railway station, trains have not served Saint-Louis since around 2003.

Get around[edit]

By public transport[edit]
You can usually count on taxis fares in Saint-Louis to be a solid fixed rate of 500 CFA.  From the garage (gare routiere) to downtown or at night expect to pay 600 CFA.  There is a fairly decent "car rapide" public transport system that shouldn't cost more than 100 CFA for your average stretch.  On the Island of Ndar, there are caleche rides designed for site-seeing tourists.  However, most of the historic city is easily accessible by foot.

By bike or scooter[edit]
To see more of Saint-Louis, why not rent a scooter or a bicycle, this is a great way to cover more ground and to explore some places that you might not be able to reach on foot. Located on the corner of Rue Blanchot and Quai Roume on the island. Scooters are available for 10,000 CFA/day and bikes for 5,000 CFA/day.

See[edit]
Saint-Louis was founded in 1659 and named after the French King Louis XIV in the 1700s, it is the oldest city to be created by Europeans on the western coast of Africa and served as the capital of Senegal from 1872 to 1957. It played an important cultural and economic role in the whole of West Africa, a stroll around the Ville (as the cab drivers know it as) quickly reveals the French colonial influence.
Many of the buildings hold their old character with many brightly colored buildings and beautiful balconies to be seen all around the island. The island was named a UNESCO world heritage site in 2000. Be sure to stop into the Syndicat d’Initiative of Saint-Louis in the Governance building opposite the bridge and pick up the urban walk they have mapped out.

16.025788-16.503981 Musée de l’Aéropostale Jean Mermoz, ☏ +221 33 961 24 55, sltourisme@orange.sn. Open Monday through Saturday. This museum has displays about the colonial airmail service that played a role in the development of Saint-Louis as well as an exhibit about the pilot Jean Mermoz. The entrance fee is 2000 CFA. 
16.031731-16.5035452 Grand Mosque of Saint-Louis (Grande Mosquée de Saint-Louis). A beautiful but rather low-key mosque that features a colonial-style architecture. The two minarets features both a clock and a ringing bell. 
16.02474-16.504473 Saint Louis Cathedral. The oldest functioning church in West Africa, this Roman Catholic church was opened in 1828.   (updated Feb 2020)
Faidherbe Bridge
16.02575-16.500724 Faidherbe Bridge. As boats were insufficient to handle traffic between Saint-Louis island and the mainland, a bridge opened in 1865 and named after the colonial administrator Louis Faidherbe. With the introduction of rail traffic across the bridge, it too became insufficient and the current bigger one was opened in 1897, but it inherited the name of the older bridge. There's a myth that the bridge was designed by Gustave Eiffel – it's not, though his company indeed came second in the bidding process.   (updated Feb 2020)
16.0226-16.50825 Guet N'Dar. Walk to Guet Ndar, the fishing village that is located on the Langue de Barberie and watch the fisherman bring in their catch. If you're lucky, you might get a great deal on seafood. Dozens of trucks wait to buy up the fish (for as little as 500 CFA a crate) and transport them into the interior as far as Kaolack, Tambacounda and Mali. Local people carry the fish in baskets on their neck and on their heads. Women can be found smoking and drying fish next to the beach in vast cauldrons. Nearby very colorful pirogues are always under construction. It is possible to see nearly every stage from the first carvings to the final painting. If you walk into the residential district of Guet Ndar, you will see thousands of people trying to live their lives squeezed in a tiny area. The scene is very colorful and lively, but when you walk along the beach you will see the effects of overcrowding in the squalid sanitary conditions and insufficient trash disposal. There is a decent-sized market in Guet Ndar, somewhat smaller than the larger Sor market two bridges away. (updated Feb 2020)
Langue de Barbarie Peninsula[edit]
On the Langue de Barbarie Peninsula you can check out the fishing village of Guet N’Dar and watch the bustling fish market and catch glimpses of the colorful pirogues that are used for fishing. Further down on the Guet N’Dar is the fisherman cemetery and past that is the Hydrobase, a great place to spend a day at the beach. Occupying the very south end of the Peninsula is part of Langue de Barbarie National Park which is home to a variety of bird species.
