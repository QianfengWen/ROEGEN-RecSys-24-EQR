Jungle Jim's is best known for their large selection of international foods, including African, Middle Eastern, European, Eastern European, Hispanic, Indian/South Asian, and Asian. They have thousands of different types of wine and beer, more than 1,000 different types of cheese, 1,500 different types of hot sauce, etc. Robotic characters are installed in some themed aisles, and a non-operational monorail, and other features really make this feel like a 1980's theme park. So huge that you could easily spend several hours wandering up and down the aisles. Also offers a cooking school.   (updated Jul 2023)
