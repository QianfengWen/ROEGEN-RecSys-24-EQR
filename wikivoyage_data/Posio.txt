Landscape in Posio.
Posio is a municipality in the southeast corner of Finnish Lapland, renowned for its large water areas and as home of Pentik Oy interior design company.


Understand[edit]
The Posio area has traditionally been inhabited by nomadic Forest Samis and even the name Posio means a certain part of a traditional Sami pole tent. The first Finnish settlers arrived during the late 1500s, to the Sirniö area. They came from south-east, following the lake district of eastern Finland northward. This is still heard in the speech of the locals as the Posio dialect belongs to the Kainuu dialects of the eastern dialect group instead of the far north dialects of the western dialect group, spoken in the rest of Lapland. The priests from Pudasjärvi parish are known to have travelled here to hold services already in 1688. However, the nearest church remained in Kuusamo until 1927, when Posio got its own.
Geographically Posio belongs to the Koillismaa highlands. The landscape is hilly and most of the area is around 300 m above sea level. There are much more lakes in this area than elsewhere in Lapland, and Posio is a prominent "summer cottage municipality" (kesämökkikunta) as there are thousands of private holiday homes by the lakes. The speciality of these highland lakes is a local form of vendace, which is about 4–5 cm long and has soft bones. This vendace, known as Kitkan viisas, "the wise one of the lake Kitka", is considered a delicacy, and since 2013 the name has got protected designation of origin (PDO) status in the European Union.
The climate in Posio is sub-polar temperate. The area enjoys one of the heaviest annual snowfalls in Finland. A postcard-like view showing masses of frozen snow on tree branches is fairly typical to this area.
Posio has around 3,100 inhabitants (in 2021), half of which live in the parish village Ahola. The most famous person living in Posio is interior designer Anu Pentik (1942–) and around 100,000 admirers of Finnish design visit the Pentik Mäki Cultural Centre next to the Pentik ceramic factory annually. Otherwise, Posio attracts mostly nature enthusiasts.
The municipality is unilingually Finnish. English is widely understood, like elsewhere in the country.

Do[edit]
Hiking in Korouoma Nature Reserve or Riisitunturi National Park are popular year-around activities. Posio has good possibilities for fishing and ice-fishing and the licences are fairly easy to get. In wintertime Posio has over 75 km of ski tracks. The skiing season generally starts in November and lasts until the end of April. There is a maintained ski track also in Riisitunturi National Park, which leads to the top of the fell.
The 950-km UKK trail runs through Posio from south-west to east, although seems not to be maintained or marked in the municipality. The trail visits both Syöte and Riisitunturi National Park.

66.251427.61121 Palotunturi nature trail, Lamminvaarantie (33 km from the centre). A 4-km nature trail rises up to the top of the Palotunturi fell. The trail goes through old-growth forest, which hasn't been subject to forestry for over 200 years. The amount of dead wood material on the ground is exceptionally high. The day hut on top of the fell is suitable for sleeping. The hut is an old fire guard's cabin and it served as a air defence station during World War II. There is a parking lot where the trail starts. No public transportation but taxi. 
Korouoma Nature Reserve[edit]
Frozen waterfall at Korouoma.
66.154427.52382 Korouoma Nature Reserve is a rugged canyon hundreds of millions of years old, occurring in the bedrock fracture zone. The canyon was given its current form by the impacts of the Ice Age. The deepest point of the canyon is the central section at 100–130 metres deep. The canyon and its high cliffs form an impressive landscape to enjoy throughout the year. The Korouoma region has a diverse range of different nature types with ridge terrain and small groves. Korouoma is a fairly popular hiking area, with 5-km and 8-km day hiking trails from Saukkovaara and Koivuköngäs and a 20-km trail through most of the area, with an open wilderness hut. In wintertime Korouoma becomes a popular destination for ice climbers, and it is stated to be the best in Finland.
As of November 2019, the 30-km trail is closed, as the stairs down to the canyon are in bad condition, and because of a flood caused by a beaver dam, some bridges on the trail have been destroyed. The Pirunkirkko bridge was demolished 9.6.2021. The rental huts of Koron korsu, Piippukota and Kaivoslampi are closed. Also Piippukota Campfore Shelter and Kaivoslampi Lean-to shelter are closed as of 2022 because of being in poor condition.

Lake Livojärvi[edit]
65.993828.12753 Lake Livojärvi is one of the most popular summer destinations in Posio, and is often stated as Lapland's Riviera. The lake is characterized by very clear water and large sandy beaches and at sunny summer days the beaches might be surprisingly crowded.

66.00228.24662 Hirsiniemi nature trail, Hirsiniemi (20 km from the centre). A 16-km nature trail that goes around Pernunselkä, a part of the lake Livojärvi. Lots of sandy beaches and several campfire sites. The trail starts from a parking lot, goes by the northern bank to the holiday village Livohka and then back by the southern bank. There is a boat crossing near Livohka. No public transportation. The road to Hirsiniemi parking lot is in poor condition. 
Riisitunturi National Park[edit]
Footpath in winter in Riisitunturi National Park.
66.23328.5074 Riisitunturi National Park lies north-east of the town centre. The national park and its surroundings form a wilderness region characterised by slope mires, hillside spruce copses and southern fell nature. Special features of the area are the slope mires. In wintertime, the spruce dominated forests are shrouded in a thick covering of snow and ice, and hardened crown snow. The region also has an abundance of smaller lakes. Maaselkä is the watershed between the east and west, and it runs through the park.
The park is almost entirely at a height of over 300 metres above sea level. The two summits of the Riisitunturi Fell itself rise to a height in excess of 450 metres. Popular places to visit include the Riisitunturi Fell summits with the wilderness cabin between the summits, and the landscape sites along the excursion trails. Riisitunturi National Park was chosen as Finland's Trekking Destination of the Year in 2010.

Syöte National Park[edit]
The northernmost part of 65.850427.80385  Syöte National Park  extends from Pudasjärvi and Taivalkoski to south-west Posio. There is no official trail or entrance to the park from this direction, but entering anywhere is allowed.
The 65.921627.78761 Hoikkalampi and 65.859527.76182 Lomavaara open wilderness huts provide free lodging for those who go (sleeping bag, mattress, cooking utensils, torch etc. needed; pets allowed; latecomers have an absolute right to the facilities, others should tighten up or leave). The UKK trail passes near the huts (although following it can be hard, as there are several other footpaths). Have a good map. The marked part of the UKK trail starts across the municipal border 4 km south-west of the Lomavaara hut, at the village Kouva. The trail goes west of Kouvanjärvi and should be easy to find just north of the lake. It continues southward as a marked and maintained trail through the park and all the way to Sotkamo.

Sirniö Smith Village[edit]
The village of 65.853228.1596 Sirniö in south Posio is well known for its smithery traditions. The smithery culture dates back to the village's origins in the 17th century, when the rural location forced the villagers materially independent. The international blacksmith event has been organised in Sirniö every June since 1998. In addition, the village provides experience services with blacksmith themes for tourists.
The village survived the destruction of the Lapland War and the oldest buildings have been built already in the 1700s. The whole village belongs to the list of nationally significant built cultural environments.
