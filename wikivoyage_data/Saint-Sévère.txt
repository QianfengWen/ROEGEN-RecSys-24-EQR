Understand[edit]
History[edit]
The parish of Saint-Sévère is located in the territory of the former Dumontier stronghold, a seigneury granted in 1708 to Sergeant François Dumontier. From 1800, inhabitants occupied the middle of this stronghold on the Pic-dur range where the church of Saint-Sévère was erected. In 1828, by diocesan decree, the St-Joseph, Bellechasse and Pic-dur ranks were detached from the parish of Sainte-Anne d'Yamachiche to form the Catholic parish of Saint-Barnabé. Finally, considering the reaction of the parishioners, there was rather the constitution of two Catholic parishes: Saint-Barnabé and Saint-Sévère. Finally, the Catholic parish of Saint-Sévère was incorporated on January 23, 1850.

Geography[edit]
The locality is crossed by the rivière du Loup (from north to south) and by the Petite rivière Yamachiche (tributary of the north shore of lake Saint-Pierre). The serpentine course of the latter mainly drains the agricultural lands of the St. Lawrence plain. While the Loup river has its source in the Mastigouche Wildlife Reserve; its course forms the western limit of Saint-Sévère and the eastern limit of Saint-Léon-le-Grand.
The territory of Saint-Sévère is part of the Saint-Laurent plain. It is mainly made up of agricultural land, apart from the areas near the Rivière du Loup and the Petite Rivière Yamachiche which are mostly wooded.
The village is located at the junction of the rang de Bellechasse (coming from the northeast) and the route de Saint-Sévère (south side) or the chemin Saint-François-de-Pique-Dur (north side). As you cross the village and the rest of the parish, you can see many old, well-restored houses, as well as houses from different eras. In the rows, the old farm buildings mingle with the more modern.

Economy[edit]
The economic activities of Saint-Sévère are centred on agriculture and a little forestry. Recreational tourism activities are restricted to a "Rien ne se perd, tout se crée" (Nothing is lost, everything is created) shop, and two agri-food businesses: "La lavanderaie Passion Lavande" and the "Domaine et Vins Gélinas vineyard".
