Walking is the only way to really see the town, since it is fairly small, but for travelling further afield, cars, buses and trains could be necessary. There is a town bus, but since it mainly tours the housing estates around the town, it will be of little use to visitors.

See[edit]
The town has little to distract for more than a morning.
Bridge Cottage is worth a look, but other than that the town is fairly bland. It is cloaked by housing developments, of which more seem to be inevitable. However the surrounding villages of Blackboys, Framfield, and Ashdown Forest are popular with walkers. Parking is free throughout the town.

It’s quite difficult to dress a fairly unexciting town as something that it isn’t. Lewes is probably a better attraction if you wish to visit this delightful area. You are probably better off having a look at the local area including Ashdown Forest or the Cuckoo Trail from Heathfield to Eastbourne. Still, the local area does contain some hidden gems.
