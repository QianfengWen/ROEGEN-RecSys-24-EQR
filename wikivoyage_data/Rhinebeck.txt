A view of downtown Rhinebeck
Rhinebeck [dead link] is a township in Dutchess County, New York. The township encompasses the village of Rhinebeck as well as the hamlet of Rhinecliff. The downtown area of Rhinebeck is not tiny, but it is small enough to walk around within an hour or so, and well worth it, as it is full of beautiful, lovingly decorated houses. It also has a beautifully preserved, functioning Roosevelt-era post office (built from 1939-1940) with murals that depict the history of the area and other interesting documentation.

The Maples, one of many buildings in Rhinebeck that are listed in the National Register of Historic Places in the United States

The Beekman Arms Inn, where George Washington stayed, is the oldest continuously-operated inn in New York State if not the United States as a whole
 Artigiani Del Gelato, 41 E. Market St.. Excellent, creative gelato. If they have the wasabi flavor when you go, get a sample — seriously. Even if you think you wouldn't like it. The lemon cookie flavor is wonderfully lemony, and the lemon-basil flavor is refreshing. $5 for 3 scoops in a waffle cone..

Two people with normal appetites can easily split a soup or salad (they offer "half bowls" of soup that are a full bowl to almost anyone else) and two pizzas and be full and satisfied. Good service, too. Gluten-free pizza is also available.
