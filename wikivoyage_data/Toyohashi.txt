Toyohashi (豊橋) is a city in Aichi prefecture in Honshu, Japan.


Understand[edit]
Toyohashi, centrally located between the main metropolis cities of Tokyo and Osaka, is known for its port, the largest for the import/export of automobiles in Japan. The Toyota Motor Company also has a production facility in the nearby city of Tahara, and the city has a manufacturing base. Volkswagen also has a large factory here. Yoshida Castle is at the center of the city, which was once an important post town on Tokaido road linking Edo with Kyoto. Toyohashi has extensive forests, and is close to the beaches of the Atsumi Peninsula, an important nesting habitat for the loggerhead turtle.
