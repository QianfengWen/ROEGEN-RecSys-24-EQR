Chipping Campden Market Hall
A classic Cotswold town, the relaxed and friendly town is made picturesque by its historic architecture made with honey colored Cotswold stone, a charming 15th-century church, a historic Market Hall that is almost 400 years old, and a decent selection of easily accessible pubs, bars, restaurants and hotels that make it a worthy stop on a trip through the countryside. Chiping Campden was built on the backs of the sheep that are still raised in the area, meaning that the town, like so many in the Cotswolds, was built with wealthy wool money. The town proudly supports the tradition of walking the English countryside. In fact, Chipping Campden is the starting point for the Cotswold Way, a 100-mile (160-km) walk from Chipping Campden to Bath. Chipping Campden hosts the Olimpick Games, a celebration of sports held on the first Friday after the Spring Bank Holiday.
