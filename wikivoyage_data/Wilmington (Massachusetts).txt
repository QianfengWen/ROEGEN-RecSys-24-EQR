Boston is the largest city in New England, the capital of the state of Massachusetts, and one of the most historic, wealthy and influential cities in the United States of America. Its plethora of museums, historical sights, and wealth of live performances, all explain why the city gets 16.3 million visitors a year, making it one of the ten most popular tourist locations in the country.
Salem is best known for the "Salem Witch trials" even though the hysteria really started in what is now Danvers. The city is well worth a day-trip from Wilmington, or even a trip in its own right, to see what basically amounts to a three-dimensional textbook of American architectural history.
Lowell is quite nearby
