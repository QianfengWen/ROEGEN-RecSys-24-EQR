"Sicamous" is an adaptation of a Shuswap language word meaning "river circling mountains".

History[edit]
In the 1800s, Sicamous and area was inhabited by a semi-nomadic Indigenous nation called the Secwepemc or Shuswap. They crossed the Rocky Mountains to hunt buffalo on the plains. In this area they were called the "Schickamoos".
In 1864, gold was discovered on the Columbia. Seymour Arm became a supply centre in the Big Bend Gold Rush. In 1885, permanent settlers arrived after the driving of the Last Spike at Craigellachie, which linked Canada sea to sea. Among the first settlers in Sicamous were families from Finland. Old Town, or Eagle Pass Landing as it now known, became an almost instant town in 1871. It was the central supply centre for railway construction. Today it is used primarily for recreational purposes such as sledding, houseboating, hiking, swimming, and biking.
Later, in the early 1900s, CPR hill became a residential development. Finlayson's store and a jail were built in 1892, adding a post office in 1904. The first school opened around 1908.

Get around[edit]
Sicamous is directly around the Trans-Canada Highway, and so travelling by car is the best way to get anywhere. If you want to see the lake, the best way is by boat. It is an excellent idea to hire a houseboat and travel around the lake, or if you are short on time, hiring a speedboat is always a fun and quick way to admire the scenery of the hills and lake. There are even 2 stores in the middle of the lake in the summer for supplies.
