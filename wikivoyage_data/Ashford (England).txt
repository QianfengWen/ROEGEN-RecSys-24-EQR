Ashford is a town in Kent on the River Great Stour at the southern or scarp edge of the North Downs in the South East of England. In 2021, it was home to 83,000 people.


Understand[edit]
It is thought that Ashford originates from a settlement that was established around 893AD, which became large enough to have a mention in the doomsday book, listed with a church and two mills under the name "Essetesford" in 1086. Ashford was designated a market town in 1243, and by 1600 had risen to become an important market town, primarily for livestock.
Ashford is in the centre of Kent, and was one of the first towns in Kent that drastically changed into a highly developed town with modern standards. Ashford International railway station was opened on 28 February 1996 and received trains from France terminating at London Waterloo. Now trains terminate at London St Pancras International. The town also has an airport with regular flights to France. The town's name is derived from "ash tree" and "ford" (meaning "river crossing").
To the north east of Ashford is the smallest town in Britain, Wye. 

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
The main roads into Ashford are the M20, which runs from the M25 via Maidstone and on to Folkestone, and the A2070, which connects Ashford with Hastings in the south and the A28 to Canterbury in the north.

Passengers travelling by Eurostar to the UK from Paris (Gare du Nord), Lille (Europe), Calais (Fréthun) and Brussels (Zuid-Midi) stations undergo UK passport/identity card checks in France/Belgium before boarding, rather than on arrival in the UK.

Passengers travelling to France/Belgium from Ashford International go through French passport/identity card checks at the station before boarding the train, whilst selective customs checks take place on arrival in France/Belgium following disembarkation.
