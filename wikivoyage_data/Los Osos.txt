Los Osos is an unincorporated community located in San Luis Obispo County. The community is combined with Baywood Park.
Los Osos means "The Bears" in Spanish.  Despite the name, no bears have been seen in this area for over 100 years so there is no need to worry about encountering one in the countryside.
