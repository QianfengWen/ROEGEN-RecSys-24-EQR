Cobblestone street in Cosala
Cosalá is a small town in the northern state of Sinaloa, Mexico. Surrounded by mountainous terrain, the area boasts two man-made lakes, a spectacular cavern system, and an impressive waterfall. The town itself is very picturesque with cobblestone streets and adobe buildings painted in a rainbow of pastel colors. It has been designated as one of Mexico's Pueblos Magicos.


Understand[edit]
Historically occupied by the Yaqui indigenous people, Cosala was founded in the early 19th century as a stronghold for Mexican/Spanish settlers. The town has less than 6,600 residents (2010). Like other towns in Mexico, Cosala has a ridiculously pompous long name that nobody ever uses, and this one is really a doozy!  The town's official name is Real de Minas de Nuestra Señora de las Once Mil Vírgenes de Cosalá. I like to think that they had to change it when it was pointed out that there weren't any virgins to be found in Cosala, let alone 11,000.
