Understand[edit]
History[edit]
Simpsonville developed in the 1820s as a stagecoach stop, but eventually became the vast suburban town it is today. The once-burgeoning town struggled during the Civil War and Reconstruction, but in 1885 lots were laid out to surround a new rail line. The Woodside Cotton Mill, established in the early 1900s, was instrumental in the town's growth, as was the installation of a large water main from Greenville. Urban sprawl from the city of Greenville has led to tremendous growth in and around Simpsonville.
