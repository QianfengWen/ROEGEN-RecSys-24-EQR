Adapazarı is a city in the Eastern Marmara region of Turkey, 160 km east of Istanbul, and with a population in 2020 of 279,127.
It's the chief city of a metropolis of just over a million population, which until 2000 was likewise named Adapazarı, but is now called Sakarya. Some features of that wider metropolis are also described here, such as the transport hub of Arifiye.


Understand[edit]
The city dates back to 378 BC, when it was known as Agrilion. It's been vigorously built upon ever since, so there are few ancient remains. The city has long been industrial, initially based on agriculture, nowadays on business such as automobile parts. 
This area was devastated on 17 Aug 1999 by a 7.6 magnitude earthquake along the North Anatolian fault line. This runs east-west just south of the city, through Lake Sapanca, then through Izmit (the worst hit) into the Sea of Marmara. Adapazarı like all the affected cities has been rebuilt since, but fault movement continues and the quake centres are migrating west, so it's feared the next big one could bring down Istanbul.
