Understand[edit]
The Esch-Sûre lake, directly behind the dam, which can be seen on the bottom left.
Esch-sur-Sûre is mostly known for the Upper Sûre dam, built in the 1960s to meet the country's drinking water needs.
The -sur-Sûre suffix of the town's name refers to the river Sauer, which is called Sûre in French. The name means nothing more than Esch on the river Sauer.

Get in[edit]
By public transport[edit]
To get to Esch-sur-Sûre by public transport, it is necessary to take a train to Ettelbruck first. From here, bus 535 runs every two hours to Esch-sur-Sûre. Other bus connections connect the small town to Wiltz and Rambrouch, which links to Colmar-Berg and Diekirch.
