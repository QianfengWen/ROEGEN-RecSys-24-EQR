Travemünde[dead link] is the closest of the boroughs of Lübeck to the Baltic Sea. As the name suggests, it is at the mouth of the river Trave. For hundreds of years, Travemünde has been a popular seaside resort and harbour on the German Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein. Daily passenger and cargo ferries leave to Scandinavia and the Baltic states but the pristine white beach and the rich history encourages people to stay. The town is trying to build a new future as a tourist destination to avoid the fate of many faceless ports.


Understand[edit]
Ferry arriving in port
The town was founded in 1187 on the delta of the river Trave. Since 1329 Travemünde has been part of Lübeck but it always maintained its cultural independence. During the times of the medieval Hanseatic League in the Baltic Sea, Travemünde blossomed into a growing village for the first time. Travemünde lost its relative importance with the decline of the Hanse from the 15th to the 18th century. Since 1802 Travemünde has been allowed to label itself Seebad (literally seaside resort) and tourism has been its main source of income. Its fame as a major nightlife and flashy high society meeting point ended with the world wars.

Unlike nearby Lübeck, Travemünde was spared the major destruction of World War II, but the town wound up directly on the front lines of the Cold War after the partition of Germany. Until 1989 the inter-German border was behind the Priwall (which belonged to the East German state Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania) and most of the beach on the Priwall side was a military area and off-limits to the public. The Priwall was developed after the reunification but differences can still be witnessed today. Also ecologists prevented the complete development of the Priwall to allow nature to maintain its part of the area.
Today about 13,500 people live here and it is an important port town. Even during the German separation, Travemünde remained well known to most Germans, for its being part of the historic Hanse city pact, and for the novel "Buddenbrooks" which took place in parts in the town. To commemorate the local Mann family (Thomas Mann was Nobel laureate in 1929) there is still today a Buddenbrook house in Travemünde. The old town has maintained its sleepy character despite the fact that at weekends there are loads of tourists.

Get in[edit]
Travemünde map — view full-screen dynamic map
Travemünde is a port town, so traffic is always an issue when roll-on, roll-off vessels arrive in the harbour or when drivers are rushing to catch a ferry. Most visitors drive directly to Skandinavienkai to get on the ferry. Travemünde has two major stations and Autobahn exits to separate the traffic for the port and the town. Traffic control prohibits almost all ways between the town and the port. If you want to see the ships it is best to use a bike or the train as cars have to take a big detour around town.

By train[edit]
It's easy to check the departure time of the next train to Lübeck
All trains travel from Lübeck's main station to Travemünde, operated by Deutsche Bahn[dead link]. The schedule is based on peak/off-peak times and for special occasions, e.g. Travemünder Woche, a special schedule will be displayed.

See[edit]
Old town houses
The former Bailiff's Residence from 1551, one of the oldest buildings in town
The old town of Travemünde is almost unchanged over the centuries and gives an impression of how people on the German Baltic Sea shore built their communities in the past. It is structured like a ship (streets have names like "starboard" and "port side"), and it is best discovered on foot. It is bounded by the Kaiserallee and the Vorderreihe. Depending on your interests, Kurgartenstraße, Vogteistraße, Godewind, Fallrepp, Backbord und Steuerbord will probably be the most important streets for you. Most public buildings can be visited, and private buildings that are active in the tourism industry welcome visitors. Signs saying Kein Eintritt, Privatgelände (no entry, private property) indicate that you are not welcome. The area between Vogteistraße and Vorderreihe is focused on tourism with loads of shops, bars and restaurants while the area between Godewind and Kaiserallee in more residential/living oriented.





Kurabgabe
Germany is governed by law, and beaches are no exception. If you intend to spend a day at the beach between 15 May and 14 September, then you are obliged to pay a "resort tax" (German Kurabgabe). This resort tax is automatically collected by hotels and pensions from its guests (business travellers don't have to pay it). The tax is €2.60 for the city beach next to the promenade and one euro per day for the Priwall beach. The tax is €1.40 from 15 September to 14 May. Registered residents of Lübeck and Travemünde are exempted. In theory, you need to pay before you enter the beach at the tourism office, but in reality, checks are not frequent and non-German travellers will not have to pay a fine or cash on the spot.


Beach and Sea Promenade
53.9624710.88361 Beach. The 1.7 km of white sand is the town's main attraction and the beach is, without a doubt, the place to be during the summer. The beach is the main reason why this town has been a popular seaside resort since 1800s.

Drink[edit]
The Casino was one of the oldest German casinos (founded in 1816) and rose to fame after the World War II, when Aristoteles Onassis was one of the guests and Josephine Baker sang in the night club. Since it closed in 2012, places to wear neat dresses are limited. The Hotel Maritim does have the Nightsailor bar but it caters primarily to the hotel's guests and is rather small. Nightlife is continuously changing and focussing more on parents and families and pensioners. If you want serious clubbing, bars or nightlife action, then you will need to travel to Lübeck or even Hamburg.
