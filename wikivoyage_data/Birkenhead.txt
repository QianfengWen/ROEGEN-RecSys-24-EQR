Woodside Ferry Terminal interior
Birkenhead is a town on Merseyside, England, on the Wirral peninsula in the historic county boundaries of Cheshire, across the River Mersey from Liverpool. It is not a tourist destination in its own right but can make for a rewarding afternoon trip from Liverpool, and is well worth a couple of hours.


Understand[edit]
The town grew around the huge Cammell Laird's shipbuilding works, its population peaking in the 1921 census when it was the 20th most populated town in England. Landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted was so impressed by Birkenhead's public municipal park after a visit in 1850, he incorporated many of its features into his work on New York's Central Park. 
In 2011, it was home to 89,000 people.

Frequent and reliable Merseyrail services operate between the town's stations. There is also an extensive bus network. Saveaway tickets[dead link] are valid on all public transport in Birkenhead. These can be purchased at any staffed railway or bus stations in Merseyside. An "all areas" ticket is best, if intending to also travel to Liverpool, Chester, Ellesmere Port, Formby or Southport. The ticket costs about £5 per day, for off-peak use. Alternatively, a slightly cheaper "area B" ticket will cover most of Wirral.
