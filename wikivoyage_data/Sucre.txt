Sucre is a city in Chuquisaca Department, Bolivia. It is the official capital of the country, though most of the government is based in La Paz. Its center is a UNESCO world heritage site, and it is a pretty city with welcoming people and a peaceful atmosphere.


Understand[edit]
Street view
Famed throughout Bolivia for its pretty, well-kept centre, and for its agreeable climate, la ciudad blanca ("the white city") is probably the most tranquil city in Bolivia (or perhaps South America). While it offers specific attractions in the form of historic buildings and renowned theatre as well as indigenous culture and prehistoric sites in the surrounding towns and countryside, the highlight of Sucre might be its relaxed atmosphere, which detains many travellers for far longer than expected.
Sucre's history has always been closely tied to that of Potosí. The city rose to prominence as an attractive retreat for wealthy and influential figures connected with Potosí's silver mines. Although Sucre can be considered a "colonial" city, its architecture is more an example of later, neo-classical style. The dishevelled, crooked streets of Potosí better reflect the chaotic urban planning of early colonialism and the silver rush, while orderly, elegant Sucre is a result of the wealth later spawned by the silver trade. Sucre’s original name, Ciudad de la Plata de la Nueva Toledo (city of the silver of New Toledo) reflects the huge significance silver played in the city’s development.

Climate[edit]
Sucre's climate is categorized as a subtropical highland climate. The city is in the tropics and the temperature is fairly stable throughout the year, average daytime highs are usually around 20 °C (68 °F) and average nighttime lows are around 10 °C (50 °F), but temperatures have risen above 30 °C (86 °F) or dropped below freezing in almost all months. November to March are the rainiest months. May to August see virtually no rain at all, though this is also the coldest time of the year.

History[edit]
In the mid-16th century, the Spanish King Philip II established an Audiencia in Sucre with a jurisdiction covering what was then known as Upper Peru, that is, the land south and east of Cusco and encompassing what is today Bolivia, Paraguay, northern Chile and Argentina. Although the Audiencia conferred a degree of autonomy on Sucre, it was still a subdivision of the Viceroyalty of Peru. In the early 17th century Sucre grew, with the founding of a bishopric, as well as monasteries belonging to various religious orders. Sucre is still a centre for the Catholic church in Bolivia.
In 1624 St Francis Xavier College of Chuquisaca was founded in the city. This university is still operating, and is considered one of the finest in the country, and is the second oldest university in the Americas. Sucre’s football team in the Bolivian league is Universitario, and originates from St. Francis Xavier College.
Sucre has long been known as a centre for progressive thought, and in 1809 it was from here that one of the first independence movements in South America began. Despite this, Bolivia was one of the last South American countries to gain independence, in 1825. When independence was established in Bolivia, Sucre became the capital of the new nation.
As the silver industry waned in importance, power shifted from Sucre to La Paz, and at the end of the nineteenth century the seat of Bolivian government was moved to La Paz. Sucre remains the constitutional capital of Bolivia, but only the judicial branch of government is based here. This remains a contentious issue for Sucreños.
Sucre became a more conservative city as the old wealth and power of the city was threatened by the Evo Morales government and its plans for reform and wealth redistribution. During the 2009 referendum, Sucre voted emphatically against Morales' proposed new constitution. Morales remains a very unpopular figure in the city, and the city has suffered from sporadic outbursts of protest since his election in 2005, occasionally accompanied by racial violence against the poor indigenous and rural people who voted for him.

By bus[edit]
-19.039589-65.2467721 Sucre Bus Terminal (The terminal is about 2 km from the city centre. A taxi to the centre should cost Bs. 4. This is per person not per vehicle. If you are not comfortable sharing a taxi, you should make this clear. Alternatively, micros 3 and A go from Junín near the plaza to the bus terminal.). Bs. 2.50 for accessing the platforms, which must be paid at a little office before boarding. The clerk will give you a ticket, which you give to another person at the exit door. You may skip this by waiting for the bus just outside of the terminal gate like many locals do. (updated Jun 2018)
The  times and destination for buses to and from Sucre are as follows, and when it comes to ticket prices expect considerable bargains if you show up short notice. However, many companies sell only cama tickets, so if you want to travel cheap (semi-cama), maybe 3 hr before would be better. All origins/destinations but Potosí are overnight rides.

Potosí – There are hourly connections that take 3-4 hr. You can also take a shared taxi, it will take about 2½-3 hr and the driver will go very very fast.
La Paz – 12 hr
Oruro
Santa Cruz – 14 hr and buses pass through Samaipata.
Cochabamba – It is 8-10 hr hours by bus. Buses only leave in the afternoons and evenings, with the last bus typically leaving between 21:00 and 22:00. Much of this road is unpaved, and it can be a quite uncomfortable and cold ride.
Tupiza – Leaves at 22:00 from Tupiza.
Tarija
Villazon – 9 hr.
Uyuni – Leaves at 22:00 from Uyuni. 7-8 hr.
The roads out of Sucre are fairly rough, with the exception of the road to Potosí, which you also take to reach Oruro or La Paz. For this reason think hard about upgrading to a semi-cama or full cama bus. The overnight normal bus to Cochabamba is definitely not fun.
Tickets generally only go on sale the day that the bus will depart (although El Dorado will sell you a ticket the day before), so to be sure of getting a seat you need to arrive at the terminal before midday. However, if you are flexible, you can also arrive a few hours or an hour before and can get great bargains, e.g. semi-cama for La Paz for Bs. 50—see the country article. Many tour agencies will offer to book tickets ahead for you, but understand that this is not how things are normally done in Sucre, so expect to pay more, and make sure you check whether you need to redeem the ticket from the agency for a ticket from the bus line. If buying at the terminal itself, make sure to go to the operator's office inside the terminal - the touts in the car park outside are usually genuine, but have been known to "double sell" seats.
Whichever route you take or level of bus you opt for, do not expect to find a toilet on board unless you travel with the most expensive operators. Ask to make sure in any case. Do expect the bus to stop in the middle of the night somewhere close to a cheese vendor, and to see half of the male passengers lined up to relieve themselves against a convenient wall.
Blockades around Sucre and to nearby towns and cities are not uncommon, so ask whether the road is open or blocked before buying a ticket.

By plane[edit]
-19.2463-65.15072 Alcantarí International Airport. Opened in 2016 to replace the old Juana Azurduy de Padilla International Airport which had many issues. Despite its name there are only domestic services, from La Paz, Santa Cruz, Uyuni, Cochabamba and Tarija—operated by Amaszonas, BoA and Ecojet. (updated Apr 2020)
Get around[edit]
Downhill view
Some of the attractions outside of Sucre, such as Tarabuco market and the dinosaur footprints, can be visited by guided tour, tourist bus or public transport.

On foot and navigation[edit]
Sucre is a small city and the center is very walkable. For the most part, you won't need to move more than five blocks from Plaza 25 de Mayo, the main square.
Outside of the city there are many hiking and walking opportunities, as explained below. For reliable trails and GPS navigation in this region, consult OpenStreetMap, which is used by many mobile Apps like OsmAnd or Mapy.cz. Or just download the according GPX or KML files through Waymarked Trails for such trails on OpenStreetMap. (Note, you just need to change the OpenStreetMap relation ID to download the GPX or KML files through the same link.)

By taxi[edit]
Sucre has plentiful taxis. Within the centre do not pay more than 5Bs pp.

By micro[edit]
Sucre has small buses (micros, really not much bigger than vans) that run set routes. They don't have actual stops, so just flag them down whenever and let the driver know when you're ready to get off. The fare is Bs. 1.50 (2023), which you pay to the driver. Micros run frequently and can sometimes be very crowded—don't be surprised to see someone hanging out the door.

See[edit]
The historical parts of Sucre were listed as a  UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1991.

-19.00278-65.237221 Cal Orcko (Parque Cretácico). Tu–F 09:00–17:00, Sa Su holidays 10:00–18:00; tours to the footprints are at 12:00 and 13:00 only. More than 5,000 dinosaur footprints imprinted on a 70 degree sloping wall of a limestone quarry, which used to be a lake floor. This is the world's largest set of dinosaur tracks. To visit the footprints and the museum that accompanies them, you can take the Dinobus at 09:30, 11:00, 12:00, 14:00, 15:00; return times 10:00, 11:30, 13:30, 14:30, 16:00, 17:00.

Or take Bus 'H' or Bus number '4' that leaves every 5 minutes and returns every 5 minutes from Cretaceous park and to the city (Bs. 1.5, 45-60 min). You can take this bus from Arenales street at the corner of Junin street, one block from 25 de Mayo square. Alternatively, you can get there by taxi at whatever time you want for a bit more money. A guided visit takes about 1½ hr and is included with admission. Only the guided visits at 12:00 and 13:00 get to go down into the quarry to see the footprints up close; otherwise you'll just be able to look at them from a distance. You need closed shoes to go down the quarry. Bs. 30, plus an extra Bs. 5 if you want to take pictures.   (updated Jan 2024)
-19.047471-65.2603852 Casa de la Libertad, Aniceto Arce (Central Plaza), ☏ +591 4 6454200. This museum is in a well-restored and maintained convent from the colonial era. The chapel was the meeting hall where Bolivian independence was declared on 25 May 1825. The museum includes a number of paintings and objects related to Bolivian history, especially to the independence movement, and the struggles breaking away from Spanish domination. Bs. 15 + Bs. 10 for camera.  
The office of prefecture
-19.047932-65.2596443 Plaza 25 de Mayo. The heart of Sucre, surrounded by the cathedral, the office of prefecture, the town hall, the historic Casa de la Libertad, as well as a swag of restaurants and bars. Get a shoe shine (don't think that wearing flip-flops you will deter the shoe shine kids), use the free Wi-Fi, grab some snacks, or just watch the world go by. The lion-flanked statue is of Mariscal Jose Antonio Sucre, Simon Bolivar's right hand man and the first president of Bolivia. 
Glorieta Castle, Sucre
-19.08466-65.268614 Glorieta Castle (Castillo de la Glorieta), Carr. Sucre-Potosi, ☏ +59146435240. W-Su 09:00-16:00 (closed M Tu). Fascinating place with a fantastic story behind it. The castle was home to Francisco and Cotilde, the prince and princess of Glorieta, as proclaimed by Pope León VIII in 1898. The pope was so impressed by the couple's reputation for charitable and humanitarian works that he named them prince and princess. The pink castle is hard to miss, with its imposing towers, each reflecting a different architecture and mood. The "Prince's Tower" reflects Russian themes, the "Princess's Tower" reflects Chinese themes with its pagoda-like structure, and the third, presumably shared, is a Gothic structure. Influences of other European styles are found in different areas of the castle. Guided tours are in Spanish and are available each hour except 13:00. 20 Bs (foreigners), 10 Bs (Bolivians), 10 Bs (photo permit).  (updated Feb 2023)

The military museum has a big collection of Bolivian and international weaponry. It is really interesting if you know a thing or two about weapons and if you can understand some Spanish. They do not offer guided tours. In their collection they have a jet engine, airplanes, miniatures, typewriters, a parachute, engines, all sorts of artillery including very rare ones. They also have a room dedicated to their combat history. During the Pacific war, Bolivia lost its access to the Pacific Ocean. In the last room, you will find a roll with thousands of letters from children asking their sea back. (updated Sep 2016)
-19.04718-65.259466 Museo del Tesoro, Plaza 25 de mayo # 59 (north corner), ☏ +591 464 43366, infomuseo@museodeltesoro.com. 09:00 - 12:30 and 15:00 - 18:30.

Do[edit]
Parque Bolivar
Sucre is generally known as a great city to kick back in. It is a popular place for people to study Spanish or volunteer, and many who visit end up staying for far longer than expected. While the city centre can be seen in a day (add another day or two if you like museums, churches, cafes, or moving slowly), the surrounding countryside is rich in other attractions, from traditional villages to dinosaur footprints to trekking through the mountains of the Cordillera de las Frailes.

-19.054687-65.253431 La Recoleta. Walk up Calle Dalence ("Pantaleón Dalence"), Grau, or Calvo ("Daniel Calvo") from the central plaza to La Recoleta, a spot up on a hill with a plaza and old buildings. Although there are often events here, as well as a monastery (Convento de la Recoleta), church and museum, the main attraction is definitely the view of Sucre from the Mirador Cafe. The drinks and food here are of European price level. Adjacent Hotel Kolping also has excellent views and a lunch buffet. If you don't want to pay, there are nice views from the plaza itself. At the entry to La Recoleta there is a small but rich market where native people sell weawings and handicraft.  (updated Jun 2018)
-19.041897-65.2643732 Parque Simón Bolívar. Take a stroll in the park, the city's favourite lovers' hangout. Just don't step on the grass. You can watch people (nice people there), watch street performances, eat. People have their small Eiffel tower there, just next is a big playing park for kids. At the upper end of Parque Bolivar stands Bolivia's supreme court. At the lower end is Estacion Aniceto Arce, Sucre's train station which is not in use. If you don't get your fill of old trains in Uyuni, there is another one within the station precinct. Ask permission from the token security guard before you enter, as there is a guard dog here (although she is usually playing with her puppy).  (updated Jun 2018)
 Independence Day. 25 May. The day the city came alive. Sucre was where Latin America’s fight for independence started, at least that’s what we were told. The parade around they city make you feel proud, even if not close to being a Bolivian. This is also the reason for the naming of the main plaza: Plaza 25 de Mayo. Today, the plaza is full of families and couples, and it’s a fantastic place to sit and watch people go by, preferably with an ice-cream in hand. (updated Jun 2018)
 International Human Rights Film Festival (Festival Internacional de Cine de los Derechos Humanos). Known as the "Seventh Eye", a bi-annual film festival organized by PUKAÑAWI has occurred 20 times in Sucre. The festival recognizes films that focus on human rights in 3 categories: in Bolivia, in Latin America, and around the world. The festival was held in 2023 and the next one is being planned for 2025. (updated Jan 2024)
Beyond the center[edit]
-18.969751-65.2732593 7 Cascadas (8 km NE out of town). Go for a hike to the 7 waterfalls. Take a taxi from Sucre to the tiny village of Alegria for Bs. 20 (or catch the red 12 micro bus to the last stop for Bs. 1.50), then walk the remaining 3 km. Or negotiate for the driver to take you all the way. Take food, water, towels, bathing suit, sunscreen as there are no services nearby. The waterfalls make for a pleasant day-trip. You can hike around (wear sandals not shoes, as the path crosses streams) and swim in the natural pools. This attraction may be better in wet season.Besides frequent robberies in this area in the past, as of 2016, it was a very popular spot with locals and tourists, and seems very safe. While the waterfalls are almost entirely dry in April and May, it is still a beautiful place to swim and jump from the cliffs. (updated Jun 2018)
Sunrise in Maragua crater
Inca trail
-19.05171-65.432924 Maragua (crater and village). One of the most popular destinations outside of Sucre is Maragua crater, a region of unusual rock formations. The crater is not volcanic (contrary to what some say), but was formed by erosion. Fossils of marine shells are still found in the region and sold by local children. There can be nice children on the way, who may ask for some gift, so buy some pens, notebooks, dried fruits, or nuts in Sucre (no sweets please, people may not have access to dentist service)—you'll like making these children happier. It is possible to spend a night in Maragua village inside the crater (i.e. Bs. 60 a night)—ask local people, other tourists, or local kids will organize you a place. Conditions are basic but the experience unique. Simple meals are available too.Offered by many companies as a tour, but can also organised independently with a proper map. Buy food and water beforehand. You may want to take some chlorine pills to purify some water on the way. Take the minivan to Potolo (ask people in Sucre for the proper place to catch such a minivan; Bs. 12; a breathtaking ride), and get of at the chapel (ask the driver for "Chataquila" or "camino del Inca"). Start following the inka trail from Capilla de Chataquila. When down (Chaunaca; lady takes Bs. 10 for the community), turn left and follow the river (don't cross the river yet). Further (where you see trees, church, some houses), cross the river over suspension bridge (Puente en el camino al Maragua; the lady takes Bs. 10 for the community), then hike up to Maragua (a waterfall and some water spots on the way). Here you could stay overnight, or you choose the camping site right at the beginning, depending on when you start the trek. From Maragua down to the dinosour footprints, from where you continue further to Potolo (2nd night?).From Potolo there are regular buses back to Sucre. Alternatively, you can continue from Potolo into the valley for another half day hiking. Yet another alternative is to walk the main way from Maragua (start early - 07:00 or 07:30), through the other village in the crater, Irupampa, out of the crater, and all until you join a bigger road in the village of Quila Quila, take the road left, but wait there until some 12:00 to catch a truck back to Sucre (it's really a long way), or catch some other car. Along the trail there are many sightseeing points, and you can do some side tours to rupestrian paintings or the Salar de Chullpas. Check out the downloadable trail and waypoints in the following.Details: Maragua Trail (green). Distance: 30.5 km, hilly. Duration: 2 days. Grade: Easy to medium. Altitude range: 866 m. Total climb: 963 m. Total descent: 1,513 m.The details on OpenStreetMap are not reliable and you cannot use OsmAnd nor Mapy.cz. Better download the GPX file/trail through the icon in the top right of this page or directly here. Use this as an indication together with satellite pictures.   (updated Jun 2018)
-18.9718-65.36335 Centro Ecológico San Antonio de Aritumayu (Resort), Aritumayu (18 km from Sucre. A 1½-hour drive.), ☏ +591 72884956, aritumayu@yahoo.com. If you stay longer and want to escape the city for some fresh air and nature, consider the ecological centro in Aritumayu. Splendid clean river with waterfalls nearby, and basic but clean accommodation available (romantic: no electricity nor cellphone coverage). (updated Jun 2018)
Several agencies offer tandem paragliding at Bs. 450-900 (depending on the size of the group). It is a 2-hour very bumpy ride each way to the take-off spot. In essence, you will spend the whole day for a 10-minute flight.
Other companies offer quad and motorbike tours. Climb up to 3,665 metres through natural surroundings (somewhat trashed by quads) with superb views.
Many tour companies offer single or multi-day treks into the surrounding countryside, focusing on understanding the local cultures and ecology and offer the chance to stay with local communities. If you are just interested in hiking and trekking, many trails can be done on your own using GPS and OpenStreetMap—see above.
In addition, the following leisure tours that can be arranged:
At Icla there are rubber-tubing tours through a river canyon.
The village of Yamparaez, on the road to Tarabuco is a good starting point for condor-spotting treks.

Sucre is a popular place to learn Spanish and to volunteer. There are many Spanish schools including the Sucre Spanish School or the Fox Language Academy. Fox state that fifty percent of the study fee at Fox goes towards paying for Bolivians to learn English but Fox's contribution to helping kids learn English is a little disputed, due to questions of management. Fenix [dead link] a few blocks from Fox, is a Bolivian-owned and managed not-for-profit school that is an excellent alternative. Prices are the same as Fox, but the teachers are better-paid and highly experienced and the funds are put to use appropriately. All the money goes towards helping needy causes in the community. They focus on conversational Spanish and making lessons fun. There are plenty of activities like cooking classes, dance classes and volleyball games. Fenix also offer a variety of volunteer projects including with the elderly, orphans and disabled. They have a Facebook page email: s-panishlessons@hotmail.com and the address is Calle Miguel Angel Valda No. 61 (2nd Floor).
For a different approach to learning Spanish, check out Spanish in Sucre. Instead of keeping you in a classroom, they take you out to explore Sucre, and learn Spanish at the same time. Because they don't have the typical costs of a traditional school, they are cheaper. Lessons only cost US$3.50 for group lessons per person per hour and US$5 per hour for private lessons.

In Sucre, shops tend to be clustered by type. So you might see one block with 15 jewelry stores, then another with a dozen toy stores, and so on.
Sucre is famous for its tapestries, which are sold at Tarabuco market and shops all around the town. Different tribes or family groups from the villages that surround Sucre all have their own unique style, which is shown in their work by using different colours or symbols. Some tapestries can take up to a year for one person to make, depending on size and complexity. Travelers can help support this tradition by purchasing the tapestries from Tarabuco market, or at a cheaper price, from the many shops in the town. The best tapestries are sold in fair trade stores and at the ethnographic museum.
Locally knitted sweaters, scarves, and related items are a good bargain, especially those made from alpaca wool.

Huge variety of vendors offering anything imaginable and a lot of things you would never imagine. Many meat vendors offering freshly slaughtered meat products. A huge number of fresh fruit and vegetable vendors. Large prepared food area where unusual scents beckon tourists to try authentic regional dishes at some of the lowest prices in the city. A tasty lunch can be had for 3 Bs. The place is always crowded and has a reputation for pickpockets, so secure your valuables (or leave them in your hotel room). (updated Jan 2024)
Eat[edit]
Sucre offers a wide range of eateries from street vendors and stalls in the markets to elegant restaurants. The large numbers of students mean there are many interesting but inexpensive places to get a filling meal. Probably the cheapest lunches are had upstairs in the market (from Bs. 8). Salteñas, a type of large empanada, usually filled with meat, that's popular in Bolivia, can be found easily. Several small salteña eateries are at the lower end of Calle San Alberto.
Sucre is also famous for its chocolates. Chocolates Para Ti and Chocolates Taboada, both with shops just off the central plaza, are the best known, and there are several shops selling artisanal chocolates (aka confectionery) between the plaza and the central market. Para Ti also have shops at the airport and bus terminal, although the latter is usually closed. However, the incredible amount of sugar they put into the confectionery leaves doubts whether it will be of everyone’s taste. But no wonder one of the many chains selling confectionery is simply called Sucre.

Most places on the main square, and down the first block of Calle Nicolas Ortiz, are heavily gringofied, -for better or worse. Sunday is by far the slowest night.
In the market there are many stalls selling all kinds of fruit juices and salads.

Stay safe[edit]
The plain-clothed police officer scam seems to be popular (but seldom) in Sucre, especially targeting women travelers. Read all about it under Bolivia#Stay safe and be aware. If you are near the central plaza and this happens to you, walk there, as there are usually uniformed police there.

Cope[edit]
To extend your visa go to the migration office on calle Bustillos.
There are several small book exchanges around town; try Bolivia Specialist, Joyride Cafe or Backpackers Sucre.

Connect[edit]
Internet is mostly slow. Places on the central plaza are generally over-priced; you should be paying about Bs. 2 per hour. One of the best places for internet, and one of the few to have serviceable Skype, is on the corner of calle Calvo and calle Padilla.
An incomplete list of places with wifi: Joy Ride Cafe, Florin, Kulturcafe Berlin, Hotel Kolping, Amsterdam, La Posada. There is also free (but hopeless) wifi in the central plaza, and in the food court above supermarket SAS.
Operators Entel, Viva and Tigo have 4G coverage in all of Sucre.
Go next[edit]
Tarabuco – A popular one-day or half-day excursion to the Sunday market. If you want explanation and guidance, any tour agency can arrange a tour. But you don't need an agency—there is frequent and cheap (Bs. 10 one way) public transportation (minivans) too, or even trucks on the road to and from Tarabuco. It takes about 2 hr to reach the town. It is important to leave early; the markets are at their best before lunch time, and begin to pack up in the early afternoon.
Candelaria – For a far less touristy experience visit this village, which is further from Sucre than Tarabuco, but a part of the same culture that is renowned nation-wide for its handicrafts. According to people from Indian Arts Museum, prices of handicrafts are better in Tarabuco (because sellers compete there), but in Candelaria you can get very sophisticated and beautiful works (not sold in Tarabuco). Transportation is very limited and people have been stuck out here, so it's best to go with a tour agency.
On the road to Nucchu
Yotala and Nucchu – Yotala is a little nice town, can be reached with minivan (Bs. 4, leave Sucre from cemetery, takes more or less 30 min). You may want to head to Nucchu from there. Nucchu is a village, probably most famous for hacienda, where first presidents (Sucre, Bolivar) used to stay during independence war. The hacienda is quite nicely preserved, a local lady takes care after it. It may be possible (depends on, i.e., if the owner is in Bolivia) to spend a night there, Bs. 80 (contact/reservations: +591 645 17 98 or +591 645 20 22). There is another famous building (of some princess?) in Nucchu, and the village is interestingly laid out (a river, two hanging pedestrian bridges). To reach Nucchu from Yotala best is to catch some public transport (ask people in Yotala) that occasionally goes there. Or try to hitch-hike, you may be lucky. Otherwise it's quite a long walk, but the scenery is good, you can meet local Quechua people (they speak Spanish), they can tell you about the life in the valley and difficult conditions there.
Potosí – Formerly the most prosperous town in Bolivia and still a mining town today. It is interesting to see and maybe do a tour into the mines.
To get to Argentina, several companies offer direct buses from the Terminal de Buses Sucre departing at 20:00, arriving at the border town of Villazon around 06:00. (Bs. 70-80 for full cama; 9 hr.) Do not buy an onward ticket from touts at the border, only buy from the bus station in La Quiaca after crossing the border by foot.
