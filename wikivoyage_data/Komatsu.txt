Komatsu (小松) is a city in Ishikawa prefecture, Japan.  The construction equipment company of the same name was founded here and remains a major employer. Komatsu has developed into the second largest city of Ishikawa but at first glance has little to appeal to a casual tourist, unless you are a big fan of concrete. If you take the time to look deeper, however, you'll find that this little city has a lot to offer.

By plane[edit]
Komatsu Airport
36.393889136.40751 Komatsu Airport (小松空港, KMQ  IATA). The main airport for Ishikawa. There are international connections from Taipei daily and from Seoul and Shanghai 4 times a week, and domestic services from Tokyo, Sapporo, Sendai, Fukuoka and Naha (Okinawa).   
Hokutetsu Kaga Bus services leave for JR Komatsu station every 20-30 minutes (12 min, ¥260). Hokutetsu also runs direct buses to Kanazawa (40-60 min, ¥1100), Fukui (1 hour) and Kaga (25 min, ¥500).

By train[edit]
The Hokuriku Shinkansen runs directly from Tokyo via Nagano and Kanazawa to Komatsu in under 3 hours.
Komatsu is on the busy JR Hokuriku Main Line from Osaka to Naoetsu via Fukui, Kanazawa and Toyama, with several normal and express trains every hour.  Ordinary trains from Kanazawa take 32 minutes and cost ¥480. While it's become more convenient for Tokyo travelers, the Shinkansen has made things less convenient for travelers from Nagoya, Kyoto, and Osaka as all direct trains to and from these cities were discontinued when the Shinkansen opened. Now, travelers from these areas can only take express trains as far as Tsuruga where they must then transfer to the Shinkansen to reach Komatsu.

Do[edit]
36.409722136.4478891 Rojo Park (芦城公園 Rojō Kōen). Near city hall, this public park was once the grounds of a castle belonging to Maeda Toshitsune. Though the castle was torn down during the Meiji Era to make way for what is now Komatsu High School, the park remains. It is a very traditional Japanese garden with a tea house, waterfall, and series of ponds. While there are some nods to the design of Kenrokuen — the statue on the hill, the plum grove, a lantern over water — the garden is not as vast of stuffy as its northern counterpart. Expect to see families out for a stroll and more than a few stray cats. The park is a local favorite for hanami (cherry blossom viewing) in the spring, as it has a large grove of cherry trees at its center. Free.  
Buy[edit]
Those looking for souvenirs might find a better selection in Kanazawa, especially in Kanazawa station or near Kenrokuen. The Komatsu Urara Concert Hall (near the station) offers some souvenirs in its gift shop, including items bearing Kabuki, the Komatsu mascot.
Komatsu city houses several kutani-yaki studios, including the workshop of one Living National Treasure. You can buy some kutani-yaki pottery in the station and at the Urara, or you can visit some of the art dealerships scattered throughout the city.
