Westchester is a neighborhood of Los Angeles on the West Side of Los Angeles County in Southern California.  While it's not a part of Westchester, the community of Playa Vista is also covered in this article.


Understand[edit]
Westchester includes Los Angeles International Airport, whose runways and service facilities, along with the associated hotels and travel services, dominate the southern portion of the neighborhood. In contrast, the northern half is largely residential and retail. It is also home to Loyola Marymount University and the Otis College of Art and Design.

Thousands arrive in Westchester through LAX every day, but residents and visitors to Westchester, as in much of Los Angeles, typically travel by car. The primary connection to the freeway system is Route 405. This freeway experiences heavy daily congestion during commute times, and locals will sometimes opt for Sepulveda Blvd., Lincoln Blvd. (California Route 1), or La Cienega Blvd. as alternate access routes from the north and south.
Being home to LAX ensures a significant number of travel options are available to Westchester. The Los Angeles County MTA, Santa Monica Big Blue Bus, and Culver City Bus systems all have connecting routes to the airport and surrounding areas. Flyaway Shuttles, a bus service operated by LAX, provides a non-stop connection to the airport from Downtown Los Angeles, Westwood, and San Fernando Valley.
Neither Westchester nor the airport, strangely, have a direct connection to the Los Angeles Metro light rail system (though several solutions have been proposed). An airport shuttle service to the nearest metro station is available (see LAX for additional information).

Stay safe[edit]
Westchester's pedestrian-compatible residential northern areas vary greatly from the area surrounding LAX. Century Blvd. and Sepulveda Blvd. experience heavier traffic volumes and a larger than average number of buses and high-occupancy vehicles. Be aware of your surroundings and exercise caution if navigating these areas on foot.
The east side of Westchester, particularly along La Cienega Blvd., where the district borders Inglewood, has a higher crime rate than is typical for the area. The violent crime rate has fallen, but petty crime and robbery are still above normal levels for the region. Travellers should not feel discouraged from visiting, but should exercise higher caution when in this area.
