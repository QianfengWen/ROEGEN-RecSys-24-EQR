The main stadium at Dignity Health Sports Park is home to the oldest of L.A.'s two top-level professional soccer teams, and was the temporary home of the National Football League's Los Angeles Chargers from 2017 to 2019. It will also host the USA Sevens event in the World Rugby Sevens Series for men's national rugby sevens teams for at least 2020, and possibly beyond.

33.8643-118.2611 LA Galaxy, 18400 Avalon Blvd (Dignity Health Sports Park). One of the charter members of Major League Soccer, the Galaxy is best known as the former home of three major stars, American Landon Donovan, England's David Beckham, and Sweden's Zlatan Ibrahimović. 
 LA Galaxy II, 18400 Avalon Blvd (Dignity Health Sports Park). The reserve side for the MLS Galaxy plays in the second-level USL Championship at Dignity Health Sports Park—but not in the main stadium. Galaxy II instead plays at the complex's track & field stadium. 
 USA Sevens, 18400 Avalon Blvd (Dignity Health Sports Park). This annual event in rugby sevens, held in late February/early March, is returning to its original site of Dignity Health Sports Park in 2020 after stints in San Diego and Las Vegas. Sevens is a variant of rugby union played on a full-sized field but with seven players a side instead of 15, and halves of 7 minutes instead of 40. The short game duration allows many games to be played in a day, and a full tournament to be completed in a weekend. The USA Sevens is part of the World Rugby Sevens Series, an annual circuit of 10 events that feature 16 teams (including the U.S.) and strongly encourage a festival atmosphere. If you're so inclined, it can be a great opportunity to meet people from other parts of the world.
