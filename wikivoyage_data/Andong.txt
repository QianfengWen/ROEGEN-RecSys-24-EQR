Andong's international claim to fame comes from having been visited by Queen Elizabeth II of England. So the story goes, the Queen asked to be taken to the most Korean place in Korea. She got taken to Andong.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
It takes 3 hours to get to Andong from Seoul, 2.5 hours from Busan or Daejeon, and 1 hour from Daegu by car.

By train[edit]
There are regular direct services from Seoul, Busan, Daegu and Gwangju. Passengers heading from Seoul can either take a KTX-Eum high-speed service or Mugunghwa train from Cheongnyangni directly to Andong. Alternatively, they could ride the KTX to Daegu and then transfer to the local train. Andong's train station, as of 2021, is 15-30 minutes away from the city center, but it is located next to the bus terminal, enabling for easy access to the attractions and the city centre. The station has English-speaking staff, self-service ticket machines, a Global ATM and a tourist information centre.

By bus[edit]
Andong is quite easily accessible on the intercity bus network. Bear in mind that it's usually best to pre-book your ticket or at least try to confirm departure times online.

From East Seoul Terminal[edit]
Located out the front of Kangbyeon station (subway no.2-green line)
The buses go every 10-15 minutes to Andong and it takes 2 hours, 40 minutes.

From Gangnam (Seoul) Express Terminal[edit]
Located in Gangnam Express Bus Terminal-station (subway no.3 and no.7-orange&olive green)
It's easier to find the terminal by getting into the Sinsegye Department Store and going via the Fendi & Gucci store (1F) because the way between those stores is connected by the terminal.
The buses go every 40-60 minutes to Andong and the ride takes 2 hours, 50 minutes.

From Daejeon[edit]
Andong lies due east of Daejeon, thus across the grain of Korea's train network. As such, buses are about your only realistic transport option short of hiring a car. Departs from Dong-gu Express Bus Terminal, on the far east side of town down near HomePlus and Han-nam University. Buy your ticket at the Intercity Bus counter (on the right facing the counter, or left as you walk in). Cost is ₩14,100 one-way, and the bus is never full. Expect a rather long stopover at Gumi to get out, stretch your legs, and twiddle your thumbs aimlessly, after which the bus will depart again from another platform. The buses go about every hour and the full trip takes roughly 2 hours 10 minutes. Daejeon's bus timetable website is an indecipherable mess, so just show up with fingers crossed.

From Andong back to anywhere[edit]
Last bus leaves around 20:00. To some cities, it's around 18:00. Be sure to confirm the times: Andong actually has a very good timetable website but unfortunately it's not web indexed. If aiming to be back by a certain time, consider that the listed times can and do vary wildly according to traffic, in particular Sunday evenings are a nightmare.

Get around[edit]
The downtown area of Andong is very small and you can walk across the city centre in under 10 minutes.
Taxis can be flagged off the street but it's not recommended as you may have a long wait. The best place to get a taxi from the city centre is from outside the railway station, otherwise it's recommended to order one by phone - ask your hotel for the phone number of a reputable company. Black 'Deluxe' taxis are available too at a higher price for better comfort and drivers who can communicate well in English and Japanese.
Buses link Andong to surrounding towns and villages. Plenty of buses depart from the bus terminal right across from the new train station and serve most of the tourist attractions. Information at bus stops are only written in Korean - however the tourist information office at the train station provides a useful English bus schedule displaying departure times, destinations and fares. Bus fares do not increase by distance but are instead based on the length of the route - typically about ₩1,000 for a bus going to the outer suburbs to ₩2,500 for the furthest destination. Change is available (in coins only) but it's not recommended to attempt paying with a ₩10,000 note for example. Domestic tourists rejoice, for Seoul T-money cards are in fact accepted!

Cultural and Historical Attractions[edit]
Andong Hahoe Folk VillageHahoe Village from atop Byongdae Cliff. Mind the step.
Festival performance in Hahoe Folk Village.
Dosan seowon
Byeongsan seowon
Various cultural assets including national treasures and tangible or intangible cultural heritages are well preserved in the Andong Hahoe Folk Village, and the whole village was designated as Important Folk Material No.122, also a listed UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2010. People live in every house in the village and you can enjoy the true folk culture of Korea there. They provide the traditional Korean mask dance on weekends (15:00, every Sunday in March, April, November / 15:00, every Saturday and Sunday from May to October).
Other sights include:

 The tree inhabited by the Samshin-goddess. Walk around it three times, and write your wish on a tag. Peace or reuinification seem to be common answers if stumped. The sight alone of all the aging tags hung off such an ancient tree is worth a peek. 
 Byongdae cliff. The view from atop showcases the entire village and is rather spectacular. Take the little wooden ferry from down by the pine forest, it's pretty cheap and return is included. Those feeling adventurous can note that its actually possible to descend or ascend the cliff not only by taking the main trail beside Okyeon Pavilion, but also by a lesser marked one that goes via Gyeomam Pavilion, following the strata along the cliff-face itself, halfway up. Not for oversized individuals or those wary of heights. 
You can visit the village from 09:00 to 17:00 during the winter season (November–March) and 09:00 to 18:00 during the summer season (April–October). Nominal (₩2,000?) admission fee.
Take bus #46 from the stand directly across the road (and a few metres to the right, in front of the convenience store) from the Intercity bus terminal. Buses run about every 1–2 hours during peak time and be aware that the trip takes a whole 50 minutes. Cost ₩1,000. As of 2010, the last two buses back to Andong during festival season depart at 17:00 and 19:00 respectively. Note that the you are not left with much time to jump on to an intercity bus home upon arrival.

Andong International Mask Festival
 Andong International Mask Dance Festival. In every October, you can also visit the Andong International Mask Dance Festival, showcasing not only Korean Mask Dance, but also various traditional dances of countries round the world. The festival is split into two halves.Typically tourists only visit the main event in Andong city itself, by the river (~2 blocks south of the bus and train terminals). It is interesting, but dance acts on the main stage are well spaced out (day-pass admission ₩5,000), even on weekends, and the rest of the time you are left to wander what's mostly a tourist trap. Food and booze is plentiful however (even whale), and there are many affordable mask making stalls set up, intended for children but also widely enjoyed by curious overseas visitors as the little blobby things you use to decorate the mask are unlike anything that can be seen in the West. The second half is located over in Hahoe village (see above). For the idle spectator, this is a definite highlight, as the stage is positioned amongst the pine grove on the banks of the river, opposite Buyongdae cliff, with the colourful costumes contrasting well against the natural backdrop. When travelling to Haohe village during the festival, pick a seat on the left side of the bus for a special surprise amongst the rice paddies. Programs to learn many folk dances and mask dance contests are also prepared during the festival. 
 Andeok Apple Village. Famous for producing honey-sweet apples with a savory crunchiness. It is a beautiful and quaint village located between the cities of Pohang and Andong.Numerous apple farms to be appreciated. Just walk around the village and you will see them. Spend a day walking around and appreciating the beauty. Maybe the locals will offer apples to foreigners when they are in season around October.

Drink[edit]
Andong Soju is one of the specialties of the city. Its traditional distillation method dates back to the Silla Dynasty (57BC-935AD). The wife of a household was traditionally responsible for distillation along with other household chores, and she passed it down to the wives of her sons.
