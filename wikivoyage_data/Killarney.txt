Killarney is a town in County Kerry in southwest Ireland. It has a resident population of 14,504 (as of 2016) but in summer they're outnumbered by tourists, because this is one of the most scenic areas of Ireland, firmly on the tourist circuit for over 150 years. Its lakes command great views of Ireland's highest mountains, and the landscape is protected as Killarney National Park. It's the usual starting point for the Ring of Kerry, the 214 km circuit along the coast of Iveragh Peninsula.
Killarney in Irish is Cill Airne, "church of sloes" or blackthorns. The origin of this is obscure, but other suggested derivations are even more obscure, so sloes it is.


Understand[edit]
Ross Castle
The area around Killarney had industry from metal ores in prehistoric times, and from the 7th century became a centre for religious learning, with monasteries on Inisfallen and elsewhere. From 1747 it became one of the first places to try to promote a tourist trade, as part of Viscount Kenmare's efforts to improve his estate. This didn't get very far in an era when very few people could enjoy the luxury of leisure travel, and travel within Ireland was especially tedious. That changed with the arrival of the railway in 1853, encouraged by Henry Arthur Herbert who now owned the estate. Hotels popped up, and tourists flocked to enjoy the antiquities and scenery around the three lakes, and the longer circuit of the Ring of Kerry.
Muckross House and the estate changed hands a couple of times then in 1932 were gifted to the nation, to become Ireland's first national park. The park has expanded considerably since then, and now ranges from genteel municipal gardens at the edge of town to forest with herds of red deer and wild mountain terrain. (There are no fees or gates, but you might pay for parking or other activities.) There are also large tracts of mountain that are beyond the park but protected in similar ways: this larger area is also described here. 
Bus tours of the Ring of Kerry start from Killarney and always go anti-clockwise, to Killorglin, Caherciveen, Portmagee, Waterville, Derrynane, Kenmare and back to Killarney. Independent travellers starting from Tralee, Killarney or Kenmare will probably do best to go clockwise. Starting from other towns on the circuit, go anti-clockwise as you've a few hours start and should always be able to keep ahead of the wagon train. 
The TIC is Visit Killarney on Scott's St, the alley off College St. It's open M-Sa 09:30-17:30.

It is a common and wise custom of those who make this tour, and are not pressed for time, to hire the carriage at the hotel in Killarney and continue with it "all the way round." It is absolutely marvellous what these mountain bred horses can get through "thinking nothing" of thirty miles for days together or even fifty miles in a single day. - Travelogue of 1858
Town is compact, but you need horsepower or wheels for Killarney National Park - a bike works well.
Bike hire is available at Killarney Rent a Bike (three locations, aka O' Sullivan's), Lyne's and Killarney Bike Rental.

Jaunting Cars were once a common tourist conveyance but are now almost confined to Killarney. They come in various configurations but typically seat four, with a single horse and a driver known as a "jarvey". They'll trot you round town and out to Ross Castle and Muckross; tours of Dunloe Gap involve a transfer from town by boat or conventional car then the jaunting car takes you up the lane.

See[edit]
Muckross Abbey
Town centre along High St is typical 19th century low-rise, pleasant enough but always busy with traffic. St Mary's RC Cathedral, west along New St, is a grand neo-gothic structure completed in 1855.
52.06052-9.504761 Franciscan Friary (on Fair Hill north side of the centre remains active.). It's a hefty building of 1860, founded by Belgian friars, and you can attend church services to see the ornate altarpiece and stained glass windows. (updated Feb 2024)
52.02093-9.506652 Killarney National Park (starts just west of St Mary's). This entrance (junction of Port Road and Mission Road on R877) leads past Knockreer House (nowadays park offices) into bosky gardens and parkland overlooking the lough. The park is free and open 09:00-18:00. (updated Feb 2024)
52.05664-9.508623 Killarney House (south off N71). the other town entrance. The grand 18th century chateau proved remarkably combustible, so eventually the owners gave up and decamped to the stables, converting them into the present house. It's used as park premises but is sometimes accessible for tours. (updated Feb 2024)
52.041-9.5314 Ross Castle, Ross Rd V93 V304. Mar-Sept daily 09:30-18:00, Oct Nov Tu-Su 09:30-16:00. A well-preserved 15th century tower house on the lake shore. The owners were ousted after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and it became a barracks until the 19th century, so it was kept repaired. Visit by guided tour. Adult €5, conc €4, child €3.   (updated May 2021)
52.03797-9.535725 Ross Island. The peninsula west of the castle, with mixed forest and firm trails. It was mined for copper from about 2400 BC to 1900 BC. (updated Feb 2024)
Lakes or loughs: the one next to town is Lough Leane, the largest and lowest of the three. The name means "lake of learning" probably referring to its monasteries. For the visitor it's the lake of viewing, as it creates an unbroken vista west towards the mountains. South is 52.01067-9.531466 Muckross or Middle Lake, smaller but 75 m deep, as it fills a glacial scour. A pleasant hike circles it, crossing by old stone bridges. Further southwest is 51.97981-9.592657 Upper Lake: the fall on the river is only 2 m so small boats can travel between the lakes; perhaps the supposed lake monster does likewise. The river flows into Muckross Lake at 52.00721-9.549378 Meeting of the Waters, where there's a weir and a back-channel direct into Lough Leane.
52.046-9.5549 Inisfallen is the largest island in Lough Leane: boat trips often visit. The ruined abbey dates from 640 AD, though what you see now is 12th / 13th century. The Annals of Inisfallen were compiled here from 1092 and are now in the Bodleian Library in Oxford.
52.026111-9.49555610 Muckross Abbey, off Muckross Rd N71. Daily 08:00-20:00. The first monastery was founded in the 6th century, but the ruins you see now are of the Franciscan friary of 1448. It was smashed up on several occasions before Dissolution and a final scourging by Cromwell. The ruin is roofless but extensive; a striking central courtyard has a yew tree and cloisters. The graveyard remains in use. Free.   (updated May 2021)
52.02872-9.4866111 Killegy Chapel (is east side of Muckross Rd near the abbey). It's an overgrown 18th century mortuary chapel. The Celtic High Cross in the graveyard is Victorian, commemorating Colonel Henry Arthur Herbert (1815-1866) the owner of Muckross Estate and statesman. (updated Feb 2024)
52.017778-9.50166712 Muckross House, Gardens and Traditional Farms. Daily 09:00-18:00. Grand mansion built in 1843 in Tudor style, and further embellished (especially the gardens) for Queen Victoria's visit of 1861. Two sideshows have outgrown the original attraction: "Muckross Traditional Farms" are an outdoor museum of farm life in Kerry in the 1930s, with demonstration of country crafts and cutesy animals for children to pet. There's also a large clothing and pottery retail outlet. House & farms adult €9.25, conc €7.75, child €6.25, gardens free.   (updated May 2021)
52-9.50713 Torc Waterfall is the 110 m cascade of the Owengarriff River - it descends 20 m but not in a clean drop. The river flows out of the Devil's Punchbowl, a corrie lake beneath Mangerton Mountain, following the fault line that underlies this area. There are several walking trails, and after you've slogged up them for a while, you'll probably guess how the "Cardiac Steps" got their name.
51.967-9.59314 Ladies View is a viewpoint on N71 climbing out of Killarney towards Kenmare. Coaches and motorists often make a stop here, and there's a cafe and gift shop.
The Gap of Dunloe
52.017-9.63515 Gap of Dunloe is a scenic mountain gorge west of the lough, created when a glacier broke through and bruised its way north. It's flanked by Macgillycuddy's Reeks to the west and the Purple Mountains east. Tour groups transfer to pony carts for the ride up. The lane traversing the gorge is a public road so you may drive it, but it's very narrow, and cars come into conflict with other cars, bikes, more cars, pony carts and yet more cars.
52.06039-9.6347916 Dunloe Ogham Stones stand near the north end of the gap: they're 5th / 6th century though their present position and arrangement is modern. They're burial markers, naming various maci mocoi toicaki - sons of the Tóecraige tribe.
52-9.74317 Carrauntoohil at 1038 m / 3407 ft is Ireland's highest mountain, midway along the ridge of Macgillycuddy's Reeks. The ascent is a strenuous hike, hazardous in poor weather, usually 5-6 hours there and back via Devil's Ladder trail. If you're hard enough walk the whole ridge, with some half a dozen peaks of around 900 m. If you only want a Sunday stroll, or the weather's iffy and you prefer a low-altitude Plan B, park at Cronin's Yard and make your way up Hag's Glen.
52.077-9.55618 Aghadoe is a straggling village north of the lough, partly bypassed by N71. It has the cylindrical stump of 13th century Parkavonear Castle and Aghadoe Cathedral, built 1158 over an earlier monastery church and falling into ruin in the 17th century. But the main attraction is the sweeping view over the lough towards the mountains, so there's a cluster of hotels here.

Stay safe[edit]
As in most places, traffic is your main hazard. Take usual care of valuables and avoid idiot drunks.
The hills demand suitable clothing, footwear, stamina, and the ability to read map and compass - even when the weather is fine, and it can sour suddenly.

Connect[edit]
As of May 2021, Killarney has 4G from all Irish carriers, and close to the railway and bus stations there's 5G with Eir. There is mobile coverage on the main roads around town but not along the back lanes far side of the lough.

Go next[edit]
Ring of Kerry by car can easily be done in a day. If as suggested you go clockwise against the buses, the first stretch is over Moll's Gap to Kenmare. But if you decide to follow them, take N72 west via Aghadoe to Killorglin, where the main attraction is Kerry Bog Village.
The Dingle Peninsula lies to the north. Go that way for boat trips to the Blasket Islands.
The peninsula south is Beara, with a portion in Kerry but mostly in County Cork; a road tunnel drills through it to Glengarriff.
