Erfoud (Arabic: أرفود‎ - Also written Arfoud) is a town in southern Morocco, in the Tafilalet-region.


Understand[edit]
Erfoud is known as the "Gate of the Sahara" as it is near Erg Chebbi Dunes, and you can actually take direct off-road tracks to the dunes.
Many films were shot in the area, some of the most famous are: Prince of Persia - 2010 - Director Dick Richards; The Mummy - 1999 - Director Stephen Sommers; March or Die - 1977 - Director Dick Richards.
While many Ksars (fortified villages) have existed for centuries, Erfoud was built new by the French around 1920s. Arabs are the majority but as the tourist industry developed, many Berbers started coming to the city around 1990s.
Erfoud is a good place to stay and explore local destinations. Also Erfoud offers quite a good range of businesses, supermarkets, restaurants, mechanics - great for those traveling overland with their own 4x4 or cars, and wish to fill up with goods. It is fairly rural and does not rely on tourism in the way cities like Marrakech do. Thus, Erfoud is exceptionally relaxed, hassle-free, and hospitable.
