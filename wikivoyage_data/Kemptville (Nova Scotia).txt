Kemptville is an inland village in Yarmouth and Acadian Shores region of Nova Scotia along the Tusket River. It is a popular location for sport fishing due to its many rivers and lakes.


Understand[edit]
The village consists of Kemptville and North Kemptville in Yarmouth Municipality, and East Kemptville in Argyle Municipality.
Kemptville is named after General Sir James Kempt, who served as Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia from 1820–28, about the time this area was first settled by Europeans.

History[edit]
The settlement of Kemptville began with Abner Andrews, the son of Major Samuel Andrews, a British Loyalist from North Carolina. Andrews moved to the area from Tusket, Nova Scotia, and was later followed by his brothers Nathan and David Andrews and by James Hurlburt. Other families later came from various corners of Yarmouth County such as Yarmouth Township, Shelburne and Argyle, in addition to a smaller number of families from England and the United States.

 Tobeatic Wilderness Reserve. A 120,000-ha pristine wilderness area that can be accessed from East Kemptville. It's twice the size of the Isle of Man.  The heart of this wilderness is a semi-barren landscape, surrounded by more productive woodlands. Eskers, moraines, kettles, huge erratics, outwash plains and other glacial features are found throughout. Expansive wetlands, long stillwaters, fast flowing river and more than 100 lakes provide diverse aquatic habitats. Forest cover includes dense conifer and deciduous forests, including pockets of old-growth pine and hemlock. Most impressive are the old forests at Silvery Lake and Sporting Lake (also designated as Sporting Lake Nature Reserve).
