Understand[edit]
Iyana Ipaja is a multilingual city. Like most parts of Lagos, Yoruba is spoken by much of the population. However, other ethnic groups such as Igbo and Hausa are well represented. Many of its inhabitants speak English to a reasonable extent.

Get in[edit]
You can get a bus to Iyana-ipaja from any bus-stop in Lagos State. It is a landmark area in Lagos. Iyana-Ipaja is directly accessible from Ikeja, via Egbeda, for travellers coming in from the airport or coming in by road.

By bus[edit]
It is relatively easy to access this area by bus from most places in Lagos. Government-owned buses (commonly called BRT) are available at designated bus terminals in Lagos, although you might need to have a bus card to use them. You can get more information on how to obtain these cards at the offices of the BRT terminal. Alternatively, you may patronize privately owned yellow buses, locally called danfo. Their fares are often reasonable. To avoid being cheated, try asking fellow passengers what the fare should be. If you are going to this area for the first time, inform the conductor and/or fellow passengers that you do not know your stop. Continue to do this as the trip progresses. Avoid falling asleep, being absorbed in your phone or not paying attention to your surroundings. Keep all your things within arm's reach where possible, and keep an eye on them. 

By taxi[edit]
For a more comfortable experience,  you can get Uber, Bolt or Taxify. These options are often more flexible, allowing you to be picked up and alight at your desired stop, instead of having to walk to and from the public bus stops. However, here are some safety tips. Update friends and family about your ride and location, take a photo of the car and it's plate number if possible. If you're traveling solo, pretend you have people waiting for you at your destination - fake calls if necessary. Avoid entering if you find that the passenger door handles have been broken or tampered with. 

By bike[edit]
Though a ban was imposed by the Lagos state government on motorcycles plying major roads, one can still get bike rides to most inner cities of Lagos. It is an interesting way to travel, although you might want to ask the locals (for instance, a nearby street vendor), for directions on how much the fare should be. Else you risk being charged up to five times as much as the normal fare. Try to pick a middle aged rider over younger ones, as they are often less reckless and more reasonable.
