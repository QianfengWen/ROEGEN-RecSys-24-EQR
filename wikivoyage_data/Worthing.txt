Worthing is the largest town in West Sussex.  The town lies nestled between the English Channel and the South Downs National Park. It is a seaside town with a pier, a prom and pleasant seaside parks. Since the 19th century, it has been nicknamed 'Sunny Worthing' thanks to its reputedly sunny and mild microclimate.


Understand[edit]
Worthing Pier from the beach
For much of the 20th century the town seems to have taken its eye off the ball with regards tourism, preferring to see itself as a town by the sea rather than a seaside town.  In the 21st century, the town has been getting its act together; palm trees have been planted along the beach promenade, the Dome Cinema has been restored and the area around Splash Point revitalised.  The town has a growing reputation for the arts and now hosts the Worthing Birdman event which attracts tens of thousands of people.  Further regeneration work is planned, including a £150-million redevelopment of the Teville Gate area near the station.
The hills around Worthing were home to some of Britain's earliest and most extensive flint-mining operations, which saw some of the hardest flint available mined for thousands of years and exported across much of Britain and Europe.  These flints helped people to fell trees, bringing about the neolithic revolution turning the nomadic Stone Age into a settled agricultural Bronze Age.  Church Hill dates from 4500 BC.  You can still see the filled-in mineshafts on the edge of Cissbury Ring, just north of town.
Settled since the Bronze Age, Worthing remained a small fishing hamlet until the 1750s, when various wealthy citizens visited for the hunting and fishing opportunities afforded by the area.  Princess Amelia, daughter of King George III, stayed in Montague Place in 1798, which put the town firmly on the map of England's fashionable society.  In the 19th century, Worthing was an elegant and fashionable resort attracting the rich and famous of the day.
It is famous for being used as the location for the movie Wish You Were Here nd for its literary connections.  Oscar Wilde named the central character of The Importance of Being Earnest after the town, and wrote the play while stayed here at the height of the town`s fashionability in the 1890s.  Jane Austen's unfinished novel Sanditon is thought to have been significantly based on experiences from her stay in Worthing in 1805.  A blue plaque marks the former home of Nobel prize-winning playwright Harold Pinter in Ambrose Place.
Today Worthing has a windsurfing and kitesurfing centre at the western end of the promenade and is a good place to stay for visitors wishing to explore the South Downs which are just north of the town.
Worthing (population 100,000) is a large town and the centre of an urban area of 185,000.  With nearby Brighton, it forms part of England's tenth largest conurbation, with nearly half a million residents.

While in Worthing, look out for a type of sweet named Worthings after the town, available from various places including the shop at the town's Museum and Art Gallery.

Eat[edit]
Many different international cuisines are offered in Worthing, and most offer excellent food at a reasonable price. There main area for eating out in Worthing is in and around the pedestrianised Warwick Street. There are also an increasing number of restaurants around the West End of the town centre, about 1km west of South Street, around the west end of Montague Street and Rowlands Road.
For Italian food, go to 'Pomodoro e Mozzarella' on Warwick Street. This restaurant is far superior to the nearby franchises of Ask and Pizza Express, and offers authentic Italian cuisine in a friendly but very intimate atmosphere. Be sure to make a reservation if you want an evening meal there on a Friday or a weekend night. For Chinese food, try either China Palace or Fortune Inn on Chapel Road; the first is somewhat more expensive than the second, but both offer good food. China Palace has both a traditional a la carte menu and also a 'buffet' menu - for a fixed price, you can eat as much as you like, but it is cooked to order rather than being displayed in open gastronorms in the self-service style. Good Indian food can be found slightly away from the town centre on Goring Road at Shafiques. Ask for the window seat here and watch the local world go by.
For a bite to eat during the day, head to Bath Place, just off the east end of Montague Street, where you will find two very interesting cafés: Thai Lunch Box and Parklife. Thai Lunch Box offers a fairly traditional sandwich menu backed up by an extensive menu of Thai food. Look out for the oriental supermarket next door - pop in and have a look round if you have time. Parklife (almost directly opposite TLB) serves all sorts, including milkshakes in over 50 different flavours.
