City of Essaouira
Essaouira (Arabic: الصويرة) is a coastal city in Morocco. It is known as the Windy City.


Understand[edit]
In addition to the new town, Essaouira offers a picturesque medina (old town) surrounded by seawalls and city walls, designed by a French architect in the 18th century, a harbor with fish market, and a long beach with numerous water sports opportunities. Once a hippie hangout, Jimi Hendrix and Cat Stevens spent some time here. Orson Welles filmed part of his Othello in town; west of the medina there's a square named in his honor.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
31.3975-9.6816671 Essaouira-Mogador Airport (ESU  IATA).   (updated Jan 2018)
Flights arrive from Paris, Lyon and other places with some regularity.

By bus[edit]
Essaouira Bus Schedule
31.51086-9.767132 Supratours (just down the street from the beach and close to the medina entrance at Bab Marrakech). Runs coaches from their office in Marrakech (immediately next door to Marrakech's new train station). 80 dirham per person for standard bus, plus 5 dirham for each piece of stowed luggage. (updated Jan 2018)
31.50416-9.756993 CTM, ☏ +212 5247-84764. Runs a coach service from Marrakech's bus station (or the CTM Offices in the Gueliz, on Zerktouni street) for 80 dirham (add 5 dirham per piece of stowed luggage) taking about 3 hours to Essaouira. CTM buses also connect Essaouira to Agadir (3 hours) and Casablanca (6 hours) about four times per day. (updated Jan 2018)
31.5174-9.75924 Gare routière, Avenue 2 Mars. Small and unappealing station which local buses depart from. Local buses from Marrakesh bus station cost 55-60 dirham but they might try to ask tourists for more, these buses are sometimes less comfortable and slower, but they depart more frequently than the CTM buses. Many ticket sellers and semi-touts are running around the buses and station, trying to organise your trip and luggage. Note, official prices are posted inside the terminal, so do not get told it is more expensive than that. Also be curious about any luggage fee—not common, especially for luggage on-board. (updated Jan 2018)
Tickets are rarely available for the next departing coach with Supratours and CTM. Try and book your tickets the day before, or further in advance during peak travel periods.
Between Essaouira and Agadir it is very easy to catch an intercity bus anywhere along the way. During the day there is one bus about every hour. While CTM and Supratours are not allowed to pick up additional passengers, local intercity buses do not have such a restriction. This is a great way to explore the coast including Taghazout between these two cities without issues. The regular price for the full distance is 50 dirham.

By taxi[edit]
A whole grand taxi from Marrakech costs 450-800 dirham, depending on your negotiating skill, where you are, the mood of the driver, etc. It is about 80 dirham per place if you wait and take a grand taxi (six passengers, leave when full).

Get around[edit]

The walled center of town, the Medina, is supposedly restricted to non-motorized vehicles,  but this rule is widely ignored in the case of mopeds which are an increasing nuisance.  Other than that, there are occasional donkey carts to dodge.
Taxi costs a flat fee of 8 dirham during day and 9 dirham after 20:00 (as of Jan 2024).

See[edit]
Essaouira Bastion
Essaouira is a perfect example of a late 18th century fortified town, with the original canons still in place and where Orson Wells shot his Othello, "The Moor of Venice".

Medina[edit]
The UNESCO World Heritage Listed medina: check out the fish market at the west end, watch the sunset from the seawall at the Place Moulay Hassan, visit the Scala (wall tower north east of the Place), walk through the markets towards Bab Doukkala at the east end, and check out the artisan's shops near the eastern wall.

31.51434-9.772421 Essaouira Ramparts.  (updated Jan 2018)
31.51016-9.773822 Essaouira Citadel. 09:00-17:00. 60 dirham for foreigners. (updated Jun 2019)
31.49594-9.786813 Mogador island (about 1.5 km from the city). It's a nature reserve, and thus can't be visited without an official authorization. In the 19th century, it was used as a quarantine station for pilgrims returning from Mecca.   (updated Jan 2018)
Diabat town[edit]
31.481-9.774 The nearby town of Diabat. is at the south end of Essaouira's beach, and is allegedly where Jimi Hendrix once spent some time. Even if the stories aren't true, this long, windswept beach with its ruined fort is a fantastic walk. Diabat is an empty, concrete Berber village that is practically devoid of attractions except the Hendrix ruin and a Hendrix Café. It's best visited in the early morning via taxi and then return to Essouiara via a short and very romantic walk on the beach past the castle in the sand of Hendrix fame. (updated Jan 2018)
31.4836-9.76915 Dar Sultan Palace. Walk south along the beach, cross the shallow river Oued Igrounzer and in the hills to your left you will see the ruins of a once magnificent 18th century palace used by Sultans and Kings. A path leads there; you can still find some old floor mosaics and thankfully the ruins offer some shade. (updated Jan 2018)
Do[edit]
The beach dominates the Essaouirans' leisure time. Although the strong wind and currents makes relaxed tanning and swimming a little difficult at times, it is perfect for kitesurfing and windsurfing. With good winds for most days of the year, Essaouira is a watersports' paradise. The best spots are reported to be Essaouira Bay, Sidi Kaouki, Cape Sim and Mouley Bouzertoune. Equipment can be hired from various hire centres on the beach front. However, this is not the ideal place to learn watersports, particularly kitesurfing. There tends to be a bit of a catch 22 - either its calm and you can't go out because there's no wind or its windy and you can't go out because there is a huge shore break. In addition the water can smell of sewage.
Camel and horse rides, quad-bikes, near the southern end of the main beach. A crowd of salesmen offering any type of rides can be found there throughout all day long.

Buy[edit]
Essaouira stores
Essaouira's craftsmen are renowned for their woodwork and lacquerware. Intricately inlaid boxes, chessboards and curios can be found for good prices in the city's hundreds of shops; however, be aware that extensive deforestation is taking place in the area due to these woods not being replanted. Artwork of all kinds can be had here.

Essaouira inlaid wood market
31.51407-9.767021 Baguette+. Great bakery. Anything without cream of chocolate is great. Go there in the morning to early afternoon. 2 dirham per piece. (updated May 2019)
31.51416-9.767222 Rhassoul/ghassoul merchant. Essaouira seems a good place to get this product. This merchant sells proper rhassoul/ghassoul, i.e. wash soil. They sell natural and perfumed ½ kg bags. 8 dirham natural, 10 dirham with perfume. (updated May 2019)
Eat[edit]
Although Essaouira is on the sea, seafood sold to tourists can be quite expensive. Fishermen sell their catch through the market hall and you can have it cooked at the small stands nearby. Prices are clearly marked by weight on the large pricing board at the end of the fish market stalls, but this seems to make little difference to the chances of being hustled. Sample price: 5 dirham for pack of fresh sardines (10 one of them) in fish market. Carefully evaluate how much you are being charged. A cheaper option is to buy Harira (a spicy soup) for 5-8 dirham or a sandwich (i.e. at Blue facade for 10-20 dirham, walking at the street from fish stands to the Medina).
One of the best options is to buy your seafood from the dock (haggling sometimes required) where they sell everything from eels to sharks, then take your fish to the central market side streets (follow the smoke!) where they will grill it for you for only 5 dirham a grill rack, they will also grill your vegetables or make Moroccan salad. Seeing locals carry frozen fish in their hands around the corner to these stalls is common.

31.50949-9.774331 Fish Market, Essaouira local market. If you are a fish enthusiast, you should not miss the food in the market. Buy your fish (cheap, shrimps are 50 dirham/kilo, sardines 5-6 dirham) take it to the small kitchen/restaurant and let them cook it for you. They add salad, olives and bread for 25 dirham. buy the fish + 25 dirham for the baking. 
There are many reasonable restaurants and cafés on the main streets and squares.

 Berber Cafe, Ibn toumert (At Bab Kasbah take Derb Lalouj towards the sea;then take the second left turn down Ibn toumert. The cafe has a big pink door). Small friendly cafe, seats about 8 for meals and decor is mainly old boxing posters (husband used to coach), but the small menu is good and the prices are great. 30 dirham chicken/veg tangine, 20 dirham bean stew, 5 dirham tea, 4 dirham per sardine. (updated Jul 2017)
 Chez Omar (In the Rue Khabdazine with 10 other restaurants with low prices.). Small street with restaurants that serve great and cheap food in huge quantities.

31.51386-9.771035 Shyadma's Vegan Food, 20, Rue Laalouj - Place El Khayma. Lovely vegan/vegetarian spot in the middle of Place El Khayma, a less visited place with many restaurants. Shyadma's is tiny, but everything is made from seasonal vegetables and fruits from the nearby market. You will most likely have to wait 15-20 minutes for your food, but it's well worth the wait. If you call this Moroccan slow food, you will be very right. A refreshing delight for foodies, especially vegetarians and vegans! 
31.51227-9.772076 Taros, 2, rue de la Skala, ☏ +212 5244-76407. Combines a French-Moroccan restaurant, a gallery and a terrace bar with live local music and "5" (rue Youssef el fassi) for its elegant ex-pat vibe. (updated Jan 2018)
Drink[edit]
Some of the hotels have licensed bars, but it's hard to beat the terrace bar Taros for its view over the lively Place Moulay el Hassan and the harbour. Popular with locals and tourists, has decent music
An off-license, the only one in town, can be found outside of Bab Doukkala on the Boulevard al Massira, to the right. Just inside this gate is the "black market" for alcohol on religious holidays and at night. Just ask the boys selling loose cigarettes!

If arriving by bus, local women will surround you as you exit offering discount riads or accommodation in their homes for as little as 150 dirham (can be negotiated down to 75 dirham), though you will not get a view of the ocean for this. There are many hotel options available so feel free to bypass them. You can always return to the bus station and they will still be there.

Stay safe[edit]
Avoid the dealers selling "hash brownies" near the square, they are usually fake
Hashish is widely smoked in Morocco, but do not be fooled into thinking it is legal even if you see Moroccans smoking during the day. Smoking or being high in public is seen as a vice, especially near holy places, in the morning, or if you are drawing attention to yourself; use your judgement.

Go next[edit]
Agadir — the modern resort city with its beaches.
