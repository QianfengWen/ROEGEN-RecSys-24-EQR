Batavia is a city and town in Genesee County, New York.


Understand[edit]
Get in[edit]
Batavia is almost impossible to miss if you're driving anywhere near Genesee County. As the oldest population center in this part of the state, it was only natural for major roadways to be built radiating outward from here. Sure enough, four different state routes all pass through the city, all meeting at the intersection of Main and Oak (and three of them concurrently occupy a small stretch of West Main). New York State Route 5 is a major east-west route through the state, from the Pennsylvania border all the way to Albany. Route 33 runs between Buffalo and Rochester. Route 63 starts up in Lyndonville, and runs southeast through Batavia (skirting Tonawanda Creek) to Geneseo and past Dansville. Finally, Route 98 runs from Lake Ontario's Point Breeze in the north all the way down to the Southern Tier just outside Salamanca.
Oh, and the New York State Thruway (I-90) also passes just north of the city. You know, the major cross-state expressway. It's a toll road, but it's unquestionably the fastest way to get to Batavia; take exit 48 (for Route 98).
If you'd prefer to fly, Genesee County Airport (FAA LID: GVQ) sits just north of the Thruway off of Route 98. There are no scheduled commercial flights, but it's got a mile-long runway and about a hundred private planes come and go each day
The nearest commercial airports are in Buffalo and Rochester, both 27 miles away.

Do[edit]
 Batavia Muckdogs, Dwyer Stadium, 299 Bank St, ☏ +1 585 343-5454, tsick@muckdogs.com. With the realignment of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Muckdogs are no longer part of professional baseball. For now, they play as part of the Perfect Game Collegiate Baseball League, showcasing amateur players looking to catch the eye of big-league scouts. They play from June through early August.

People flock from miles around for Alex's ribs, which are quite frankly among the best you'll taste anywhere.  They've got a pretty good menu of other steak, seafood and chicken options, but if you're in the mood for ribs, you can't go wrong.  The restaurant is a bit cramped and not well lit—thirty years ago, it would have been smoky, too—but there's always a crowd.

The industrial interior is the perfect setting for Center Street's slow-cooked meats. And though the meats—pork, chicken, brisket, and ribs—are the main attraction, they've got a wide-ranging menu, including flatbreads, pasta, seafood, salads, and more. Whichever way you go, the portions are huge; if you're not careful (or if you fill up on their complimentary cheese biscuits) you're going to have a ton of leftovers. (updated Sep 2017)
