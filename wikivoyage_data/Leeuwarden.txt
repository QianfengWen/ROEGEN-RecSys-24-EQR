The former weigh house in the city centre is one of the key monuments in town.
Leeuwarden is the capital of the Dutch province Friesland in the north of the country. Leeuwarden and Friesland as a whole are often overlooked by visitors. As the Netherlands are small, however, and the famous "Afsluitdijk" connects Friesland to the provinces in the west, it's a 90-minute drive from Amsterdam to Leeuwarden. For those willing to make the trip, the city has lots of history to offer and gives an insight in the proud local culture of the Frisians. There are several worthwhile museums, including large Fries Museum.



Understand[edit]
Leeuwarden was a "European Capital of Culture" for 2018, an honour it shared with Valletta.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
From Amsterdam, Leeuwarden can be reached by two different routes: the western route via the A7 and the A31 and the eastern one via the A1, A6 and A32. From Groningen and northern Germany, Leeuwarden can be reached via the A7 and N31.

By public transport[edit]
An intercity train service connects Leeuwarden to Amsterdam and to Schiphol Airport. There are direct connections once per hour, and additional ones with a transfer in either Zwolle or Almere. For Amsterdam Central Station you must transfer at Lelystad or Almere Centrum. The journey will take about two and a half hours and costs about €25 for a single ticket. Direct train connections to and from Leeuwarden include services to Utrecht (2hr, €24), Groningen (35min, €10), Heerenveen (20min, €5.80), Franeker and Harlingen. All trains to Leeuwarden terminate there.
Bus services run to nearby destinations in Friesland, including Franeker, Heerenveen, Sneek and Harlingen as well as villages on route. The journeys typically take longer than the same ones by train.

By plane[edit]
The nearest airport is Groningen Airport Eelde, a small airport with scheduled international flights from Copenhagen, London (Southend), and Gdansk, as well as flights to holiday destinations in Southern Europe. From the airport, take bus 2 or 100 towards Groningen station (20-35 min); from here you can take the direct train to Leeuwarden (3 times/hour; 35 min).
From the much larger Schiphol Airport near Amsterdam, the direct train to Leeuwarden takes approximately 2hr 15min.

Get around[edit]
Map of Leeuwarden

As is the case with all old city centres in The Netherlands, the old centre of Leeuwarden is compact and can easily be explored on foot. The tourist information centre (VVV) has a number of walking and biking routes, if you want to make sure to catch all major sights. *  Fietspoint Leeuwarden.  is at the train station and rents out bikes for around €7.50 per day. Cycling is an excellent way to discover the city as well as the surrounding natural areas.
All city bus lines depart from the bus station, which is next to the train station. The bus station is divided in a (covered) part for local city lines, and one for regional lines. The city lines are operated by Connexxion but for some lines smaller buses under the name "Maxx" are used. Regional lines, which operate routes to and from villages and cities in the area, are also operated by Qbuzz.

See[edit]
The Fries Museum re-opened in 2013, after moving to an excellent new building on the Wilhelminaplein.
The city centre with the late 19th century Bonifatius Church in the background.
Just north of the railway station lies Leeuwarden's compact medieval centre, surrounded by defensive canals. With 617 buildings listed as national monuments, the city has no lack of heritage to see. The old town is small enough to easily explore on foot, with plenty of time to take in the many historic buildings. Among the most notable ones are:

53.2038895.7972221 Grote of Jacobijnerkerk, 95 Jacobijnerkerkhof. The largest of the medieval churches, dating back to around 1300. It's a Gothic style building that was built as a monastery. It houses a famous 1727 Christian Müller-organ.   
 Waag, 148 Nieuwestad. Leeuwarden's nicely decorated former weigh house was built in 1590, probably to replace an earlier one. It was a major centre for trade in the city, with butter and other dairy products being the most weighed and traded goods. It kept its function until 1880 or so, and now houses a lunch room. 
53.2027785.7897222 Oldehove, 1 Oldehoofsterkerkhof. When the city of Groningen got its massive Martini-tower in the 15th century, the Frisians were determined to get a tower of their own, at least as high. Money was raised throughout the province and building began in 1529. The master builder was however unaccustomed to the clay grounds under the city, and the measures he took to ensure the towers stability (including a 1.1-5 m foundation and a broad base) soon turned out to be insufficient. The tower was only 10 m high when it started to lean. Attempts to correct for the sag resulted in the tower not only leaning, but also being bent in itself. After about 4 years, the construction was stopped and the tower remained as it was ever since: 40 m high and leaning. Only in 2005 experts found that one side of the tower was built on the remains of an artificial dwelling hill, which is believed to explain many of the problems. In any case, although nothing like the Martinitower in grandeur, the Oldehove has proven an interesting landmark for the city and it has been restored. Due to the state of the structure and in order to limit noise for the people living around the tower, its bells are only used for special occasions.   
 Kanselarij, 13 Turfmarkt. 
53.2019445.7958333 City hall, 36 Raadhuisplein. Building of the Classicist city hall started in 1715. It has been extensively restored. The inscription above the mainentrance reads "Pace et Justitia", or "Peace and Justice".  
Other attractions include:

53.2025.79885 Mata Hari birth place & statue, Kelders 33. The birth place of Mata Hari, the famous exotic dancer, courtisan and hapless spy, was restored after a 2013 fire, and since 2016 the building has contained a presentation centre (belevingscentrum) with exhibits about the town's most famous citizen. In front of the building stands a statue of Mata Hari dressed as an exotic dancer. Elsewhere the Fries Museum has a Mata Hari Room.   (updated Aug 2017)

 Poetry route. You'll have to understand some Dutch to really appreciate this poetic initiative, but even if you're not intentionally following this remarkable route, make sure to notice the art you're walking on. Throughout the city centre, parts of the pavement have been replaced by stones with poems in them. Some display famous, old poems while others hold new work, created for this purpose by participating poets. There's a free map available from the website if you want to see them all.

There are plenty of good destinations in Friesland and in the rest of the Northern Netherlands. Just west of Leeuwarden lie Dronrijp and Franeker, both interesting and picturesque towns. Only slightly further are the harbour town of Harlingen and the water sports destination Sneek. Go sailing on the Frisian Lakes or hop on a train to bustling student city Groningen, to see its Martini-tower, the 15th-century inspiration for Leeuwarden's failed Oldenhove.
