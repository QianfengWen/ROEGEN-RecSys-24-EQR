Church of Saint Maethlu
Llanfaethlu is a village of 550 people (2011) on Anglesey, Wales. It is home to the only surviving working windmill on the island.


Understand[edit]
The village takes its name from the Church of Saint Maethlu. The community includes Llanfwrog.

History[edit]
There is a hill fort with a single bank and ditch in the vicinity of Llanfaethlu, and a small hoard of Roman coins was found on a hill to the west of the church, some having been minted when Domitian was emperor, around 90 AD.
The village is built around the Church of Saint Maethlu. This church is dedicated to Maethlu the Confessor who is thought to have founded an early Christian religious establishment about three quarters of a mile to the south of the present building. Two other early Christian burial sites have been found close by, at Hen Siop and at the lodge of Carreglwyd.
