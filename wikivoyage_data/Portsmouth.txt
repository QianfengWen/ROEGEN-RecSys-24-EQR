Portsmouth (pronounced "ports-muth" and nicknamed "Pompey") is a large city in the county of Hampshire, on the south coast of England. Portsmouth plays a major role in British history, especially naval history. Its rich heritage offers a variety of attractions, including the Historical Dockyard, which houses some of the most historical warships in the world – HMS Victory, Lord Nelson's flagship used at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, and the Mary Rose, a Tudor-era warship. Portsmouth has two cathedrals, including the Romanesque Portsmouth Cathedral, 12 museums, most of which are free, and two theatres. The city offers excellent shopping facilities in the Gunwharf Quays complex, home to a variety of designer stores including Ralph Lauren, Hugo Boss and Barbour, as well as the striking 557 ft (170 m) landmark Spinnaker Tower, which offers excellent views of the Solent and City.

Other famous figures to have lived here are HG Wells, Arthur Conan Doyle and Rudyard Kipling. The city is well served by three musical venues, The Wedgewood Rooms, Guildhall and Pyramids, which regularly host major musical and comedy acts.

The majority of the city of Portsmouth lies on Portsea Island, though it is separated from the mainland only by a roughly 30-m wide stretch of seawater, so is perhaps more accurately thought of as a peninsula. Historically, Portsmouth has long been an important naval port and builds on its rich heritage with memorials, museums, trails and the fascinating Historic Dockyard. It has 4 mi (6.4 km) of seafront, including pebbled beaches. It is a university city, home to the University of Portsmouth, and has a large multicultural student population.
Portsmouth has a population of 200,000 people and is the most densely populated city in the UK, outside of certain parts of London. The entire Portsmouth Urban Area is home to more than 442,000 people.

Visitor information[edit]
Visit Portsmouth website
Get in[edit]
Cathedral Church of St Thomas of Canterbury, also known as Portsmouth Cathedral
By train[edit]
50.7984-1.09041 Portsmouth & Southsea station  has National Rail trains run frequently from London Waterloo and take between 1 hr 30 min and 1 hr 40 min via Haslemere. Or about 2 hr 10 min via Winchester (you may arrive earlier by taking a later train via Haslemere than going via Winchester). A cheap day single is about £33. Other major services include Brighton (1 hr 40 min), Cardiff (3 hr 10 min) via Bath and Bristol; and Southampton (1 hour). There are also direct trains from Gatwick Airport (1 hr 20 min). Alight at Portsmouth & Southsea station for Portsmouth City Centre shopping, Portsmouth Guildhall and a short walk to the seafront.
Alight at 50.7971-1.1072 Portsmouth Harbour station  for the Historic Dockyard, Gunwharf Quays, the Spinnaker Tower and ferries to the Isle of Wight.
Alight at 50.7967-1.07333 Fratton station  for Fratton Park football stadium.
50.8282-1.05884 Hilsea station  is in the northeast of the city. lt serves the local industrial estates and most visitors would have no reason to alight here unless they are visiting Portsmouth Rugby Club. Some trains do not stop at this station.
When departing by train those unfamiliar with the stations can easily miss them even when only a few feet away. Portsmouth Harbour is behind the bus station at The Hard. Portsmouth & Southsea is easily found at the bottom of Commercial Road if you look out for the railway bridge just south of the building. Fratton can be found to the east of the road bridge at the bottom of Fratton Road and north of the roundabout between Victoria Road North and Goldsmith Avenue. The less frequented Hilsea Station is underneath the road bridge at Norway Road and Cosham station is on the Cosham High Street.

By car[edit]
Portsmouth is easily accessible by car via the M275 the M27 and A27. From London, take the A3 or M3 south. As Portsmouth is an island city, routes in and out are limited, and so congestion can be a problem, especially during rush hour. The large majority of residential roads have a 20 mph (~32 km/h) speed limit.
Parking is plentiful on the street (about £1/hr) and in pay-and-display car parks. The city centre and Gunwharf Quays both have multi-storey car parks, and Southsea has on-street parking. Some roads have a time limit on parking for non-residents and these limits are enforceable 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
Portsmouth has a Park & Ride scheme allowing parking for a reasonable cost and free bus travel to the city centre and The Hard. The buses run until the early or late evening depending on the day. There is no access for cars from the Park & Ride car parks into the city proper - only buses are permitted to leave the car parks in this direction - this is to avoid residential roads being used as rat runs by cars entering the city.
If you stroll a little away from the city centre and tourist hot spots (sometimes just around the corner in Southsea), parking can be found for free or in time-limited bays.
Motorcycles can park without a resident's permit and within the marked bays. Gunwharf Quays also has a dedicated motorcycle bay in the underground car park.
If you're visiting the university, you can obtain day car passes from University House. However, the car parks are very busy during term time.

By bus[edit]
Local bus routes stretch as far afield as Havant and Southampton. Day passes can be bought for £3.70 which allows unlimited travel in the Portsmouth City area or £4.80 for the whole of Hampshire.
National Express travels into the Hard (a few hundred yards from the harbour and historic dockyard) with links to many of the country's major cities.

Stay safe[edit]
As with most other large English cities, there can be a problem with violence around the city centre at weekends, around pub and club closing times (around 11PM and 2AM), but with a little common sense, the risk is minor. The same applies to the big pub-laden street of Albert Road in Southsea, where drunk people abound and the pavements are relatively narrow.
The area along Southsea seafront can be very quiet and secluded at nights, as it's no longer the bustling nightlife area that it used to be. You should be cautious.
The main place to avoid is Somerstown, the high-rise council estate to the south of the city centre, especially after dark. Somerstown is one of the most deprived places in the country, and consequently it is one of the main, if not the main hotspot for crime in the city, and it is very much best avoided. Somewhat luckily, a tourist has precisely zero reasons to want or need to go there - so don't. If your walking route takes you through Somerstown, choose a different route. Buckland, situated to the north of the city centre, should also be avoided at night - similar caveats apply.
More generally, petty crime is an ongoing concern in the city. Nothing should be left on display in vehicles and it's sensible to park your car in a Park Marque scheme facility (ask at the Visitor Info Centre +44 23 9282 6722).
There is an intense, long-standing and exceptionally bitter football rivalry between Portsmouth FC and Southampton FC, tying into a bitter rivalry between the cities more generally. Most residents do not care particularly much about this rivalry, but those who do care really care, rather passionately. Wearing a Southampton football top may cause you some problems in the city; in fact, anything with red and white vertical stripes (Southampton's colours) is probably a bad idea. This goes quintuple on days on which Southampton and Portsmouth play each other; wearing Southampton kit in these circumstances is quite likely to get you assaulted if you walk into the wrong pub. Complimenting Southampton or denigrating Portsmouth in comparison to Southampton is also quite likely to cause your evening to take a turn for the worse depending on who you do it around.
