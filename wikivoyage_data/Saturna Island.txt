Saturna Island is in the Southern Gulf Islands of British Columbia, Canada. It is between Vancouver Island and the mainland, and is the most easterly of the Gulf Islands. Saturna Island is mountainous and approximately 31 km² in size. Approximately 44% of the island is a part of Gulf Islands National Park Reserve (GINPR). Gulf Islands National Park Reserve was formed in 2003 from existing provincial parks, an Ecological Reserve, and other Crown land.

Like many of the Gulf Islands, Saturna is short on fresh water, so water conservation is expected.

History[edit]
The island was first used by Indigenous people who called the island "Long Nose", due to the island's long north-eastern tapering shoreline that ends at East Point.
Saturna was explored by Spanish sailors and named in 1791 after their naval schooner, the Santa Saturnina, one of the ships in the Spanish expedition that explored the Strait of Georgia. The first European settlers arrived in the 1800s.

Landscape[edit]
The highest peak on Saturna Island is 48.77445-123.171661 Mount Warburton Pike  at 497 metres. Mt. Warburton Pike (GINPR) is accessible by vehicle, and features panoramic views of the San Juan Islands and the Southern Gulf Islands.

Flora and fauna[edit]
Feral Goats
Marine wildlife on the shores of Saturna includes seals, sea lions, river otters and tidal marine life. It is also common to see porpoises and the endangered orca whale in the waters off East Point (GINPR).
Saturna Island is the perfect place for bird watching: over 180 species -- including ruby-throated hummingbirds, oyster catchers, bald eagles and great blue herons -- can be seen on Saturna Island.
At Mt. Warburton (GINPR), endangered Garry oak trees cling tenaciously to the shallow soil, while a large population of feral goats roams the island's south-facing cliffs.
Climate[edit]
In this area, daily temperatures rise above 30°C (86°F) on an average of one or two days per year and fall below -5°C (23°F) on an average of only 2 nights per year. During the winter, the average daily high and low temperatures are 8.2°C (47°F) and 3.6°C (38°F), respectively. The summer months are equally mild, with an average high temperature of 19.6°C (67°F) and low of 11.3°C (52°F).
This may seem like mild weather, but boaters and kayakers can feel very chilled especially if soaked by rain or waves. Hypothermia is a very real possibility.
Nearly two-thirds of the area's rainfall occurs between November and February, with July being the driest month on average. August and September frequently experience morning fogs.
