Zurich[dead link], is a village of about 1,000 people in Huron County, about 6 km inland from Lake Huron.


Understand[edit]
Zurich was founded in 1856 and is known for its Swiss heritage, reflected in some of the architecture. 

History[edit]
Zurich was founded by Swiss immigrant, Frederick Knell, whom laid out the town site in 1854 and in 1856 was founded as Zurich. Knell established a post office, general store, grist mill and saw mill. Knell served for four years as the Reeve of Hay Township. By the 1860s, the population was approximately 300 people with many of them coming from Germany and Switzerland. By 1881 the population had increased to 600 and in 1996 the population was 845. In 1896, Zurich was incorporated as a Police Village by Huron County Council. In 1970, it became incorporated as a village. In 2001, Zurich was amalgamated into the Municipality of Bluewater. Beginning in the 1970s, many buildings in Zurich were constructed in a neo-Swiss style which is a white exterior with brown painted board outlines. When walking around Zurich, count how may you can find. The early German and Swiss bricklayers and builders had a distinctive style of laying bricks which can be seen in many of the older brick homes in Zurich and area. They laid decorative raised brick borders at the eaves, fronts and corners of the buildings. How many houses in town can you find that have this detailing. Many of the unique features of Zurich’s downtown are the commercial building that have the “boomtown fronts”. As old Western movies, the buildings have modest frame structures with grand front facades. These buildings date back to the founding of the village and many have retained the heritage features today.
