Laguna Beach may also refer to Bang Tao, Phuket, Thailand.
Laguna Beach is a resort-residential community (population about 23,000 in 2018) along the Pacific coast in South Orange County in Southern California.  It is known for its extensive artist community, seaside village atmosphere, beautiful beaches, and luxury resort hotels. Fans of the Beach Boys will recall the mention of the city in the song "Surfin' Safari".  In warm sunny weather, Laguna Beach can have an overwhelming Mediterranean-island ambiance.  Laguna Beach attracts a few million visitors a year.


Understand[edit]
Orientation[edit]
Laguna Beach lies along the coast of the Pacific Ocean with a ridge of hills bounding its eastern edge. The main road is Pacific Coast Highway, also referred to as Coast Highway, Highway 1 and PCH.
North Laguna
This is the area from about High Street north to the city line at Crystal Cove State Park. This stretch of Coast Highway has a few restaurants and shops, but is main residential (large gated communities) with entry points to secluded beaches.
Main Beach / The Village
This area fans out from Broadway, a street that becomes Laguna Canyon Road (CA 133, a main artery into Laguna Beach). To the north is the famous Gallery Row area and oceanfront Heisler Park. To the south is the village area with shops and restaurants. Broadway ends at Main Beach, with its boardwalk and popular sandy beach area.
South of Main Beach
This is the long area from about Cleo Street south to Aliso Creek Beach. This stretch of Coast Highway contains a lot of shopping, restaurants, hotels and entry points to secluded beaches. Residential neighborhoods slope up the hills.
South Laguna
This is the area from Aliso Creek Beach south to Crown Valley Parkway. It contains cliff side beaches, some restaurants and shopping, a hospital and residential properties.

Get in[edit]

By plane[edit]
Orange County's John Wayne Airport, also known as SNA is only about 15 miles from Laguna Beach.  From SNA, you can get to Laguna Beach by one of several ways: rent a car and drive (most popular), take a taxi (about $50), take a door-to-door shuttle (about $30) or limo, or take the OCTA [see Orange County Transportation Authority below] bus #76 ($2.50, runs hourly) to the Newport Transportation Center and transfer there to the OCTA bus #1 that runs to Laguna Beach via the Pacific Coast Highway.  All of these modes may be found at the SNA's Ground Transportation Center across the street from Terminal A and B, with the exception of the OCTA bus #76, which is boarded at the OCTA Bus Stop at the far end of Terminal B curbside.

By car[edit]
Laguna Beach stretches along the Pacific Coast Highway (CA 1) at the "T" intersection of Laguna Canyon Road (CA 133), which becomes Broadway in town.  When arriving on summer nights during Pageant of the Masters performances expect a lot of traffic along CA 133 and plan extra time to get into town.
From John Wayne Airport, you can take either Interstate 405 (to the north) or CA-73 (to the south and partway a toll road) to get to CA-133 and south to Laguna Beach.  Alternatively, you can drive south from John Wayne Airport to Newport Beach and pick up CA-1 to Laguna Beach.

By rail[edit]
There are Amtrak and Metrolink stations in Irvine, Laguna Niguel, San Juan Capistrano, and San Clemente. From there it will be necessary to take public transportation or a taxi.

Get around[edit]
Laguna Beach is a linear town stretched along the Pacific Coast Highway (CA 1) punctuated by several canyons.  In town, Broadway (CA 133, which becomes Laguna Canyon Road out of town) divides the Pacific Coast Highway into the North Coast Highway and the South Coast Highway; address numbers increase outward from Broadway, with odd-number Coast Highway addresses on the ocean side.

By public transit[edit]
Orange County Transit Authority (OCTA).  The OCTA Bus #1 runs up and down the Coast Hwy twice an hour.  Route #89 runs up Laguna Canyon Road to Laguna Hills twice an hour.
Laguna Beach Transit[dead link] operates five trolley routes year round seven days a week (M-Th 6:30AM-6:15PM, F 6:30AM-11PM, Sa 9:30AM-11:15PM, Su 11AM-8:30PM). The routes are all named after the neighborhoods that they serve: Arch Beach Heights, Bluebird Canyon, Top of the World, North Laguna, and South Laguna. All routes loop back to the Transit Center on Broadway in downtown. In addition, all routes are free.
The city also operates three routes during the weekend with the same hours as the neighborhood trolley (F 4:30-11PM, Sa 9:30AM-11:15PM, Su 11AM-8:30PM) The routes serve the coast as well as up the canyon. All routes are free.
Short Coastal: Starts at North Laguna and travels along the coast to Mission Hospital in South Laguna. Frequency: 20 minutes.
Long Coastal: Starts at the Transit Center downtown and travels to the Ritz Carlton in Dana Point. Frequency: 30 minutes.
Limited Stop Canyon: Starts at Lot 16 (Act V) parking lot in Laguna Canyon and travels to downtown via Laguna Canyon Road.
All routes can be lenient on schedules so do not expect your trolley to be on time. The weekend routes do not run on a schedule.
Use the Trolley Tracker App[dead link] to see a live map of where your trolley is. Available for iOS and Android.
By car[edit]
Although a car may be convenient, parking is at a premium in the summer; beware of having your car towed. You'll probably have to pay to park downtown in beach weather. The cheapest option is parking in the residential areas on the other side of Pacific Coast Highway, although you risk begrudging the residents. If you are trying to get downtown a good place to park is the district parking lot just across from Laguna Beach High School. From here you can take a short walk into town.  Lot prices in the summer range from $7-15.

See[edit]
Before seeing anything, visit the Laguna Beach Visitors Bureau[dead link], 252 Broadway (☏ +1 800 877-1115 or ☏ +1 949 497-9229).  It is in the heart of town and distributes lodging, dining, and art gallery guides. It's open Monday through Friday from 9AM to 5PM, and Saturday from 10AM to 4PM (plus Sundays in the summer).

33.59158-117.759481 Art-A-Fair, 777 Laguna Canyon Rd, ☏ +1 949-494-4514. Su-Th 10AM-9PM; F Sa 10AM-10PM. The Art-A-Fair Festival is one of three premier outdoor art shows held annually in Laguna Beach.  Located in Laguna Canyon between the Sawdust Festival and Festival of Arts in a beautiful garden setting, it features over 125 artists, plus live entertainment, fine food, demonstrations and workshops.  Artists from California as well as many other states and countries apply annually and are accepted through a jury system, which contributes to the high quality of art and master crafts among participants. $3.50-7.00. 
33.59158-117.759482 Festival of Arts, 650 Laguna Canyon Rd. 10AM-11:30PM during the summer. This fine art festival showcases Orange County’s most accomplished artists during the summer months.  Held on the same grounds as the Pageant of the Masters, there are demos, music, and food available in addition to the artwork. 
33.59158-117.759483 Pageant of the Masters, 650 Laguna Canyon Rd. Held nightly during the summer, the Pageant of the Masters advertises itself as the place "where art comes to life", which is about the best description that could be given of an event that is unlike any other.  For over seventy years this annual pageant has presented recreations of famous paintings, statues and other works of art on a stage with orchestral accompaniment.  The catch is that real people act as models for the subjects depicted.  The artwork is textured in such a way that it is often impossible to distinguish the 3-D reproduction from a 2-D image, so bring binoculars to get a closer look.  Tickets sell out early every year, so plan ahead to attend this event. 
Every summer there is the Sawdust Festival 935 Laguna Canyon Rd. It is going on at the same time as the Pageant of the Masters. Lots of brilliant local (Laguna Beach) art to look at.
Top of the World. So named because as the highest peak in the area, it provides a spectacular view of the ocean. Top of the World has been a longtime favorite destination for Orange County's romantically inclined. Sunsets and sunrises from this location are both incredible.
Do[edit]
There is very good scuba and skin diving in Laguna. Diver's Cove is in north Laguna.

There are some good surfing breaks in Laguna however it is always best to check with lifeguards for the designated areas since it is not allowed at many beaches. But be weary and considerate since several breaks are pretty localized. Surfing tends to be more laid back at Thalia st since there are already a ton of people out in the water anyways. Grab a sponge board and hit the glassy shore break at Main Beach, or the neck breakers at Crescent Bay.
Caution: Laguna is notorious for its shore breaking waves which cause countless neck and back injuries year round. Checking with lifeguards about the conditions is alway a must if you are thinking about going out in the water for your first time.

There are some steep streets going to Top of the World and Arch Beach heights that are great for downhill skateboarding. Especially the fire road between T.O.W. and Arch Beach heights. While you're up there check out the amazing view and a beautiful sunset.
Awesome tide pools at Moss Street--bring the kids and check out some sea anemones.
Experts only skimboarding at Victoria Beach and Aliso however there are strict rules about skimming during the summer.
Good mountain biking in Laguna Canyon and Laguna Wilderness Park. Laguna's mountain biking tends to be very vertical and will test your limits. Going off roading from the fire road between Arch Beach Heights and T.O.W. can be quite a rush.
Take a hike out in El Morro canyon.
Have a picnic in one of the many beautiful parks in the Laguna area.
