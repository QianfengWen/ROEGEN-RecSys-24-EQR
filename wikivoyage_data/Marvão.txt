Marvão is a mountain village of 3,000 people (2019) in Alentejo perched on a quartzite crag of the Serra de São Mamede.


Understand[edit]
The castle

Marvão's (muhr-VUHNOOW, /maɾ.ˈvɐ̃w/) name is derived from an 8th-century Muwallad rebel, named Ibn Marwan. Ibn Marwan, who constructed the Castle of Marvão, likely on the site of an earlier Roman watchtower, as a power base when establishing an independent statelet ("emirate", duchy) covering much of modern-day Portugal during the Emirate of Cordoba (884-931 CE). The castle and walled village were further fortified through the centuries, notably under Sancho II of Portugal (13th century) and Denis of Portugal.
The village has generated significant tourist interest: it was included in the 2003 book, 1000 Places to see Before you Die. Nobel prize-winning author José Saramago (1922-2010) wrote of the village "From Marvão one can see the entire land.... It is understandable that from this place, high up in the keep at Marvão Castle, visitors may respectfully murmur, 'How great is the world.'"

The medieval castle was mostly built after 1299, and features many characteristic features of a crusader-era castle: a tall central keep with raised entrance on the first floor; a series of lower, outlying turrets (some semi-circular); high-placed arrow-slits; open spaces to aid the sheltering and assembly of villagers and troops; a well, and huge rain-collecting cistern to supply water to both keep and the wider castle in the event of siege; bent entrances (both on the village and castle gates) to slow down invaders in the event of breached gates; a series of narrow killing zones (notably, in the triple gate on the village-side of the castle); extensive crenellated battlements and curtain walls that enhanced the natural defences provided by the escarpments of Marvão's rock. Adult €1.50, child 0-12 free.   (updated Feb 2021)

39.369331-7.3863972 Roman ruins of Ammaia (in the Serra de São Mamede Natural Park). These are the ruins of an ancient Roman city. The settlement was probably founded at the end of the first century BC. It was an important urban center due to its location and the exploitation of mineral and natural resources in the region, such as quartz and gold. It was abandoned during Arab rule. At Quinta do Deão there is a Sítio Museum where the most interesting finds in Ammaia are on display. In 2019, an amphitheater was found in Ammaia, 60 metres wide.   (updated Feb 2021)
