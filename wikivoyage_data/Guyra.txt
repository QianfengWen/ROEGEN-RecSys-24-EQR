Guyra is a small town (population 2,207 in 2016) in the New England region of New South Wales in Australia.


Understand[edit]
Bradley Street, Guyra's main street
The local indigenous people were the Anaiwan people, who called the place either 'hillgo-el' or 'illgo-el', meaning 'a swamp'. The name Guyra comes from their word meaning either 'a white cockatoo' or 'a fishing place', after one of the first farms in the area. The indigenous Gumbayniggir people lived in the eastern part of the district.
The settlment of the district began with farms established in 1835. The Great Northern Railway reached Guyra in 1884 (passenger services ceased in 1989), and the settlement was proclaimed a town the following year. Dairying and potato cultivation became important industries in the district. The town became the focus of national attention in 1960 when a 4 year old boy wandered away from his home on a property and was lost for 4 days, found asleep against a log. A popular country music song 'Little Boy Lost' by Johnny Ashcroft commemorates the event. Sheep, cattle, potatoes, and tomatoes are the main agricultural industries in the district.
Guyra is in the Armidale Regional Council Local Government Area.
