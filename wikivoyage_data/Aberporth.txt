Aberporth is a very popular small town in the county of Ceredigion in Mid Wales.  It overlooks two sandy beaches and is one of Ceredigion's favourite holiday destinations, proving popular with tourists throughout Western Europe. Rock pools are exposed at low tides and the cliff top walks along the Ceredigion Coast offer extensive views.
Bottlenose dolphins are seen frequently close to shore. In 2006 orcas and harbour porpoises have also been seen but such sightings are rare. Even rarer was a turtle seen in 2005. Sunfish and basking sharks are often seen offshore in the summer.
Aberporth is also a popular recreational fishing village in the summer and is also popular with divers and boating people. It has two good beaches and has been awarded a blue flag for its beaches several years running due to the high water quality found in this area.
