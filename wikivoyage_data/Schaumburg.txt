Get around[edit]
Map of Schaumburg
By train[edit]
Schaumburg is directly served by the Milwaukee District West Line (MD-W) station at 2000 S. Springinsguth Road.  Because of the size of the village though, one of the other nearby stations may be closer to where you need to go or where you live.  To the west of the Schaumburg station is Hanover Park station.  To the east of the Schaumburg station is the Roselle train station, and further east is the Medinah train station, All of these stations are less than 10 miles from the Village Hall.  Trains to downtown Chicago take about an hour to arrive at Union Station.  Metra fares and times can be found on their website Metra Rail.  Parking for cars is available at all of the stations mentioned for $1.50/day, but does not provide for overnight parking.

By commuter bus[edit]
Schaumbrg is served by 16 Pace Bus routes.  There are express routes going from Schaumburg to the Rosemont Transit Center where the "El" can be picked up to take you to either downtown Chicago or O'Hare Airport.  On game days there are also express routes to both Soldier Field, where the Chicago Bears play professional football, and Wrigley Field, where the Cubs play professional baseball.  During the summer there is an express route to the Six Flags amusement park in Gurnee, Illinois.  There is also the Schaumburg Trolley to take you to various shopping locations, Ikea, Loews Theater, and the Schaumburg Convention Center.  There are of course a host of other routes for commuters to make their way to other suburban locations.  The Pace Bus stations, times, and fares can be found at Pace Bus their website.

By car[edit]
Unless you are staying on one of the major roads that run through the village, a map is essential.  Schaumburg was not built on a grid system of roadways, but instead has many winding roads that lead into neighborhoods, cul-de-sacs or dead ends, and they can easily turn you around into a different direction than you intended to drive.  You can sometimes even see where you want to go, but there may not be a visible road to get you to that location.
