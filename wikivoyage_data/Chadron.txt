Chadron is a city of 5,400 people (2019) in the Nebraska Panhandle.


Understand[edit]
In historic times, Native American tribes such as the Oglala Lakota (Oglala Sioux Tribe), and Cheyenne lived in the area. The Sioux used this territory as a hunting ground after pushing other tribes to the west.
Chadron is named for Louis Chartran, a French-Indian (Métis) fur trapper who ran a trading post on Chadron Creek in 1841. He was married to a Native American woman.
In 1884 the town was established when the Fremont, Elkhorn, and Missouri Valley Railroad was constructed through the area from Omaha, Nebraska, en route to Wyoming.
