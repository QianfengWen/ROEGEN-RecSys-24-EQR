Key Biscayne refers to both a tropical island just southeast of Miami and a village on that island. The Village of Key Biscayne, incorporated on June 18, 1991, is in the center of the four-mile-long, two-mile-wide barrier island between the Atlantic Ocean and Biscayne Bay. The wonderful tropical island is very quiet and mostly residential. Key Biscayne Island, which is south of South Beach, is the first island of the Florida Keys. Beaches are spectacular, the landscaping is lush and waterfront activities are plenty. Some consider it the best area to feel like you are in the islands while being in Miami.
