Teackle Mansion
Princess Anne is in the Eastern Shore region of Maryland. It is a small historic town in Somerset County, Maryland, only fifteen minutes away from Salisbury.


Understand[edit]
Founded in 1733, and shortly thereafter becoming the seat of Somerset County, the main reason for a tourist to visit is simply to enjoy the pretty, historic architecture in this pleasant small town. Just east of the historic center is the other main reason why people visit: the University of Maryland's Eastern Shore campus.
