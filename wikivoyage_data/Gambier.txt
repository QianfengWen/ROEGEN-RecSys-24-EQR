Get around[edit]
The "Gates of Hell", the entrance to Middle Path at Kenyon College
As a college town, Gambier is very walkable, and everything is close together except for the slightly out-of-the-way BFEC. The campus is split into two grassy areas, North Campus and South Campus, each surrounded by academic buildings and student housing, with a mini downtown area in between. While the campus is private property, it's open to the public (you need a Kenyon-issued ID card to get into any actual academic buildings or dorms).
The gravel path running through the village, known as Middle Path, is an important landmark. It runs about a mile from Bexley Hall at its northern end, through the town itself, and south to Old K(enyon), the college's first building. Where Middle Path meets Wiggin Street is a pillared entrance called the "Gates of Hell" by the college's students.
Centrally located parking spots are mostly free two-hour parking. The underground 40.3745-82.3995831 West Quad Garage has extensive and free designated visitor parking, with direct access to the admissions building and the library. Get to it from College Drive.
The village has one small old-fashioned gas station and mechanic in the form of 40.3773-82.397752 Campus Auto, but gas is more expensive here than in Mount Vernon. An EV charging station is across the street.
