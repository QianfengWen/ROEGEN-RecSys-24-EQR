Belgrave is a suburb in Yarra Valley, 35 km east of Melbourne.
Its Local Government Area is the Shire of Yarra Ranges. At the 2016 Census, Belgrave had a population of 3,929. Belgrave was first settled by Europeans in 1851; it is only 16 years younger than Melbourne.
It has many animals not found closer to Melbourne, such as black cockatoos, echidnas, wallabies, ringtail possums and bushy tail possums. There are many amazing forest tracks you can walk and places to go to fully see the beauty of the place.


Understand[edit]
Belgrave was named after Mount Belgrave, a house which was built by an early settling family, the Bensons. The family was connected with Belgrave Chapel Leeds, Yorkshire, England; the name carried by Mr and Mrs R.G. Benson when they came to Melbourne in 1856. Until the 1900s Belgrave was considered a part of Upper Ferntree Gully and the train station was known as Monbulk from 1900 to 1904.
The village centre started in what is now called Tecoma, where a school was opened in 1901. At the time of World War I, Belgrave had a store, a post office, a sawmill and a dozen or more farmers and nurserymen. By 1920 it had become a small resort area and had 7 guest houses and 4 coffee shops. It also had a lolly shop, a chemist and 2 stores.
Belgrave had a population of around 1,000 in the 1920s and they decided to give the growing settlement new place names: Belgrave Heights and Belgrave South.
Belgrave was promoted as the Queen of the Dandenong Ranges and as 'Belgrave the beautiful'. To its north there was Monbulk Forest (now called Sherbrooke Forest). The popularity of Belgrave continued after the war.

Climate[edit]
The weather in Belgrave is much as would be expected about anywhere in Melbourne; unpredictable. In summer there are days where it's too hot to go outside or do anything (except maybe go to the pool). In winter the days are shorter and darker and rain and hail can be expected (but the lantern parade is on to brighten up the darkest day). A lot of days it will be sunny and rainy on and off, or suddenly become clear on a stormy day.

Belgrave Railway Station
Belgrave is the final station on the Belgrave line. Travel from (and to) Melbourne takes approximately 1 hour, however during peak periods many trains run express, resulting in shorter journey times. To use public transport you'll need a Myki card, which costs $6 (or $3 for children/concession) from post offices, milk-bars, petrol stations and train stations. Once you have the Myki card it needs to be topped up with money. An adult fee (for one trip) is approximately $3 (it changes frequently) and a child/concession fee is $1.50. The number of stops doesn't change the cost.

By car[edit]
Renting a car can be useful, consider using Car Next Door (many people rent their used cars out around the Dandenong Ranges). There is plenty of parking and much of the hinterland is accessible by car. Note that the roads can be curvy, hilly, bumpy and hard to drive on if you aren't used to the area.

By bike[edit]
Bike rental is possible but only from a bike store in Monbulk (Cog Bikes Australia). There are bike tracks along the railway to get to Tecoma, Upwey and Upper-Ferntree Gully but riding along the roads can be hilly, bumpy and generally hard to ride even if you're used to the area.
