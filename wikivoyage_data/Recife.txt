Recife, the capital of Pernambuco, is one of the largest and most important cities on the northeastern coast of Brazil. This lively capital, founded by Dutch colonizers, is brimming with a vibrant culture, an interesting old town (which includes the oldest synagogue in the Americas) and some nice beaches.


Understand[edit]
Boa Viagem beach
Recife (Portuguese: "The Reef") is on the Atlantic coast, at the estuary of the Capibaribe, Beberibe and Jordão Rivers, close to the easternmost point of the Americas. The city, which is only two meters above sea level (some parts are below), is distributed across rivers, canals and islands. 
Due to the prevalence of waterways in its geography, Recife is known as Veneza Brasileira (Brazilian Venice). Its 1.7 million inhabitants (2020), 3.7 million in the Grande Recife, are called recifenses. Services are the base of the economy. Despite the high incidence of poverty, the municipal Human Development Index (HDI) in 2000 (0.810) was above Brazil's national average (0.800). Recife is famous for its beaches, history, Carnaval, arts and cuisine.

Orientation[edit]
The city can be roughly divided in four major areas:

The Centro (Center) is composed of the neighborhoods of Recife Antigo (Old Recife), Santo Antônio, São José, Santo Amaro and Boa Vista, which are scattered through a couple of islands and part of the mainland.  They are connected to each other by a series of bridges over the Capibaribe River.  The Centro contains most of the historic and government buildings in the city.  The port, which is in Recife Antigo, was once the most active in all of the Americas.
Zona Sul (South Zone) is the most modern and touristic part of the city, as it was built around the beautiful natural reef beaches that gave the city its name.  This area has a great many hotels, restaurants, bars, the airport, and the largest shopping mall.  Its most important neighborhood is Boa Viagem, set along the beautiful Boa Viagem beach. Because of the beach and the skyline Boa Viagem is also called the Copacabana of the North East.
Zona Oeste (West Zone) is by far the greenest part of the city.  It contains remnants of the Atlantic Forest that once covered most of the Brazilian eastern coast.  It contains two famous museums (Instituto Ricardo Brennand and Museu-Oficina Francisco Brennand), as well as the Federal University of Pernambuco, and the Recife Military school (2nd best school around all Brazil).
Zona Norte (North Zone) is mostly a residential area.  Throughout the centuries, the neighborhoods along the Capibaribe River were home to the local aristocracy.  It contains the city's best schools and hospitals, and is also famous for its parks and bars.
The term Grande Recife is used to describe the Metropolitan Region of Recife, the fifth largest urban agglomeration in Brazil (after São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte and Porto Alegre) and the single largest in the Northeast.  Grande Recife offers superb touristic attractions inside and outside the city limits.  Do not miss Olinda or Porto de Galinhas.  The first is famous for its natural setting, colonial architecture and carnaval, while the second has been consistently voted the best beach in Brazil.  Cabo de Santo Agostinho, Itamaracá Island and Igarassu are known for their beautiful beaches and important historical monuments.

History[edit]
Map of Mauritsstadt and Recife, 17th century
A collection of fishing shacks, inns and warehouses started on the delta between the Capibaribe and Beberibe rivers in the captaincy of Pernambuco, sometime between 1535 and 1537, at the long reef (actually a petrified sandbank) that runs parallel to the shoreline, enclosing its harbor. Here is found the city's -8.06315-34.8711691 Marco Zero. Eventually it became a port for the capital Olinda, which is just across the Beberibe. In 1630 came the Dutch invaders, establishing the colony of New Holland. They laid siege to Olinda, pillaging it in 1631, and built a new city on the island of Antônio Vaz opposite the first settlement, naming it Mauritsstadt, after count Johan Maurits van Nassau-Siegen, governor from 1637 to 1644. His Vrijburg palace was built at the spot where Republic Square is today. Mauritsstadt's map shows two large forts, built of earth and wood, on either side of the walled city; the four-pointed northern one, Fort Ernest, was demolished to make way for the present Princesses' Field Palace. The five-pointed southern one, Fort Frederik Hendrik, has survived, rebuilt in stone, officially renamed Five-Pointed Fort, and has long been home to the Recife City Museum.
Nassau was a tolerant man, and allowed freedom of religion, but the Dutch West India Company bosses were hardline Calvinists, severe in architecture and taxation. This frustrated Nassau, who went home and left the company to impose its own rule, which drove the natives to rebellion. After the Dutch West India Company's larger, better equipped army's defeat (albeit a narrow one) to a Portuguese and Native force in the 1649 Guararapes battle at Recife's outskirts, opinion in Amsterdam considered that "Dutch Brazil by now no longer has a future worth fighting for". The last invaders were expelled in 1654, and a sizable resident Sephardic Jew community moved to New Amsterdam.
Recife became the capital of Pernambuco in 1827.

Beaches[edit]

With 8 km of hotels and restaurants, it is the longest urbanized stretch of beach in Brazil. If you want a tan, you came to the right place. The beach road has a wide walkway attached and this is dotted with huts selling food and drink. Try the traditional "água de coco" (coconut water). The beach is full of vendors selling food and drink. There are also vendors selling t-shirts, hats, suncream, sunglasses. These guys can get a bit insistent.  Simply smile and one word will have them on their way: não (pronounced "now"). The beach is somewhat protected by a coral reef wall visible at low tide, making it good for a swim, but don't go out past the wall, as the waters are more dangerous, with sharks reported in the area.

Eat[edit]
Local specialties[edit]
Bolo de rolo with sorbet
Pernambuco has a multicultural gastronomy with African and indigenous influences, among others. The national dish Feijoada (a stew of beans, pork and beef, served with rice and Farofa) is not very popular in Recife.
On the other hand some ingredients which are widely used in Recife are hardly found in the South of Brazil, as manioc flour (which is the main ingredient of tapioca), cuscuz (corn flour), pumpkin, jerked beef, goat or lamb. Seafood is exotic and delicious. The regional food has some peculiarities like Carne de Sol and buchada, a dish prepared with the stomach of billy goat.

Recife is the birthplace of two traditional and delicious cakes Bolo de Rolo and Bolo Sousa Leão.
Do try the snacks on offer from beach vendors---little chicken and beef kebabs, oysters, prawns, and grilled cheese. Just be aware that some of the vendors may have been carrying them around for hours--if it doesn't look fresh, it probably isn't.
A must try is Caldinho: a soup served all over the place (restaurants, dedicated carts and people with flasks selling it on the beach). Comes in a variety of flavors from black bean to shrimp. The person selling it will say "completa" when you order it. This simply means "complete", and if you say yes at this point you get a few added extras, such as a small boiled egg put into the cup of hot soup.

Recife is the gastronomic capital of the Northeast. There are more high-quality restaurants here than in any other city in Brazil north of Rio de Janeiro.

Beach food[edit]
Boa Viagem beach; beachgoers and a (ice cream?) vendor
Fancy sitting around all day on the beach under a beach umbrella?  Well, you can! The chairs and the guy that moves the umbrella are free. All they ask in return is that you buy your food and drink from them.
They all carry a menu and the food arrives quickly and freshly made on the beach. Try the seafood. The fish is usually caught locally and earlier that same day.
Apart from your own vendor, there will be a variety of vendors walking up and down the beach, selling a variety of things. Learning the language for these items is useful but unnecessary as the vendor will take the time to show you what he/she has on offer.

Prawns (camarão) - Be careful of the prawns-- smell them before purchase. A free sample is available with the word provar.  They might have been walked up and down the beach for hours in the hot sun. A quick sniff is enough to tell you if they are fresh or not. If you decide to eat them, here is a quick tip: hold the tail of the prawn, tear off and discard the head and leg sections, hold the very tip of the tail, pop the rest in your mouth and bite off the tip leaving it in your fingers. Yes, you can eat the shell; peel it if you wish, but you will not see the locals doing this.
Oysters (Ostra) - Vendors will be carrying a bucket full of ice and live oysters. They are prepared for you one at a time. Served with a squeeze of lime, salt and cumin powder.
Crab - They do not come prepared, so unless you know which bits to eat and which bits to discard, steer clear!
Grilled cheese (Queijo de Coalho) - No warnings here--just go ahead and enjoy.  It's a real treat.
Kebabs (Espetinhos) - Grilled chicken or beef. Cooked fresh right in front of you.
Ice-cream - The prices are a lot more expensive than just off the beach. But you don't have to get out of your chair.  In that heat, you will appreciate that.
Caldinho - you will notice guys walking up and down the beach with flasks. These are full of different flavors of a soup called caldinho. Try prawn one with hot pepper sauce.
Ovos de codorna - Small boiled quail eggs ready to peel, salt and eat.
Nuts - A variety of nuts is available, cashew being the most obvious, because it's grown right there in northeastern Brazil.  Also, peanuts in 2 varieties: roasted or boiled.
Drink[edit]
Bars[edit]
There are many many bars in Recife, most, if not all, serving food as well as drinks. The prices are cheap.
At the less classy end of the market, there are some great bars. They don't have great signage to tell you that it's a bar. Basically, if you see some plastic garden furniture in the street, you are looking at a bar. These are usually the most fun places with the loudest people and the best vibe. Be careful of the ice in places like this as it might not be made from bottled water. It also helps to have a good constitution of you are going to eat in these bars.

There are huts selling food, beer, and the like about every half kilometer in the center of Boa Viagem beach.

Stay safe[edit]
Sign that raises the attention for sharks
Recife's reputation for safety is not one of the best. Robberies on streets and buses are fairly common. Do not be alarmed — odds are you will have a fabulous time here — but be aware of your surroundings and take the usual big city precautions.

While entering or leaving Olinda at dusk or dawn, you have an elevated risk of being ambushed. Taxis are recommended.
Beware of the unlicensed guides.  Make sure you have the travel itinerary planned out and a price (including meals, fuel, etc.) agreed upon before starting out.
Watch out for shark warnings before entering the water at the Boa Viagem beach.
If you are carrying notes of R$ 50 or 100, be sure to tell the taxi driver before you get in because he might not have change. Some taxi drivers might not know how to get to where you are going, so make sure that you have the address written down. If you are a woman traveling alone, sit in the back as some drivers may try to take advantage of the situation.
Avoid Recife's downtown on Sundays. Streets are deserted all day long and are very unsafe. Consider taking a tour to a neighboring city or beach instead.

The Policia Federal for extending your visa or visa free stay is in the airport on the ground floor.

Stay healthy[edit]
As elsewhere in Brazil, some beaches in Recife are not suitable for bathing, and conditions can change from day to day. On the day of your visit, check the map of the latest weekly bathing report (in Portuguese, informativo de balneabilidade) of the state's Environment Department (CPRH). There is also a mobile app called #deupraiaPE (in Portuguese) that provides an up-to-date map of polluted bathing sites.
