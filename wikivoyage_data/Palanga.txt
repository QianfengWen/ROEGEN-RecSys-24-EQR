Palanga is a seaside resort in the Samogitia region of Lithuania. It includes a string of smaller resorts from the edge of Klaipėda city to the border with Latvia and the regional airport; in 2023 it had a population of 18,132.


Understand[edit]
Lithuania as it emerged from the First World War was landlocked: Klaipėda on the Baltic was the German port of Memel, while points north belonged to Latvia. Lithuania then annexed Klaipėda and exchanged territory with Latvia to acquire a coastline. Palanga lacked a harbour - its unusual L-shaped pier was constructed to compensate, but there was no shelter from wind, waves and ice, and the town was altogether better suited to be a summer beach resort. Its visitors are almost all domestic tourists and few foreigners come here. 
55.91821.06731 Palangos turizmo informacijos centras is the tourist office, at Vytauto g 94, corner with Kretingas g. It's open M-F 08:00-18:00, Sa Su 10:00-16:00.

See[edit]
55.920321.04531 Palanga Pier is L-shaped, built in 1882 to export bricks but soon becoming a leisure spot, especially towards sunset. It has repeatedly been wrecked by storms and ice floes. The last major reconstruction in 1998 extended it to the present length of 420 m. The pier is free to stroll 24 hours.
Basanavicius gatvė is the spine of Palanga - many Lithuanian towns have a street named for Jonas Basanavičius (1851-1927), leader of the revival of national identity. This one stretches from the pier inland for almost 1 km to Vytauto gatvė. It's a pedestrian mall lined with bars, restaurants, nightclubs, funfairs and souvenir shops.
