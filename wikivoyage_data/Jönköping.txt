Jönköping is by many Swedes referred to as the Jerusalem of Sweden - this is due to the town's many churches. The city is on the southern end of Sweden's second largest lake, Vättern. Jönköping also has two smaller lakes of its own, Munksjön ('The Monk Lake') and Rocksjön ('The Rock Lake'). It is Sweden's 10th largest municipality with about 136,000 inhabitants (2017).

By train[edit]
Jönköping is surprisingly underserved by rail for a city of its size. There are no direct SJ trains from either Stockholm and Malmö and only slower regional trains from Gothenburg. In general a change of trains is required in either Skövde or Nässjö. There are plenty of regional trains from other cities in Småland however.

The city centre is small and very walkable. In general the city is very pedestrian- and bike-friendly. A good starting point for discovering Jönköping is its central station, Jönköping Resecentrum, where trains and buses to and from other cities depart and arrive. The station is connected with Juneporten, which is the place where all the inner-city buses leave. Bus tickets within the city cost 20 kr and 16 kr flat rate, during peak and off-peak respectively. Young people and children usually get discounts. The last inner-city bus usually leaves around midnight on weekdays, so if you plan on traveling late be prepared to take a taxi which can be rather expensive. On weekends you may be able to catch a bus up until two in the morning, but check the schedules in advance on the regional traffic office homepage, Jönköpings Länstrafik[dead link].

Habo Kyrka (Habo Church) lies several kilometers northwest of Jönköping, just off the road to Falköping. It's a small frame church whose interior is decorated with peasant folk art depicting biblical scenes.
Gränna is the hometown of the peppermint rock candy. One can also take the boat from here to get to the island of "Visingsö".
Taberg, interesting mountain just south of Jönköping. Called the miracle in Småland by Carl von Linné.
Visingsö is an island in lake Vättern, not far from Jönköping. It has a total area of 24 km² and its sights include its herb garden, the old castle ruins and going on a tour through the island by horse buggy. One gets out to the island by first getting to the town of Gränna to which one can take the local bus. After that you leave from Gränna on a boat which departs for Visingsö every hour or so.
60 km east of Jönköping lies the village of Eksjö. It is a town that has been able to preserve many wooden buildings in the center. Most of these houses are built around quiet courtyards. One house is now a museum where you can see how a well-off family lived around 1900.
Outside of Eksjö there is a nature reserve were you can walk through a small canyon, the Skurugata, and then on up the hilltop, the Skuruhatt. The trail that takes past both is only 4 km long, but beware not to wander of onto the longer hiking trails that cross it. Walking through the Skurugata is a little adventurous, especially if it rains and the rocks become slippery. From the Skuruhatt you can see the surrounding countryside and forests.
