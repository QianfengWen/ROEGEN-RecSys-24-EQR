Belper is a town in the Amber Valley of Derbyshire, 7 miles north of Derby, with a population in 2011 of 21,823. It's been industrial since medieval times, thanks to nearby deposits of ironstone, made into nails and other ironware. It also became a textile town and its mills are part of the UNESCO Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site. It's by no means picturesque but it's close to attractive countryside in the Peak District west and north.


Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
Belper is on the mainline between Derby and Chesterfield/Sheffield, although it is only served by one main line train per weekday. It is also served by the Derwent Valley line between Nottingham, Derby and Matlock.  Trains run roughly every hour - see www.thetrainline.com for timetable details.  The station is unmanned but you must buy tickets from the machine on the Derby bound platform to any destination. (If you join at a station like Derby with a booking office you must buy your ticket beforehand.)

Shanksie's pony is fine for the main part of town, but pack an extra bottle of pop if you're pushing a buggy or wheelchair from the river to St John's Chapel (especially if you go up Long Row - it's steep and cobbled).
