Stay safe[edit]
While Newport is a safe city, like many others crime can occur. Usually you will encounter no problems.
Newport can be rough at night. Bars such as Meze Lounge and Lloyds Queens Hotel are considered to be safer than Revolution.
Your personal safety in Newport on the whole is not at risk. In the unlikely event that a threatening situation occurs, it is best to simply move on and avoid offending anybody.
