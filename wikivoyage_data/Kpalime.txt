6.934610.6234751 Chateau Vial. The French colonists built the impressive chateau in 1940. Since then however, the humid climate and sporadic maintenance of Chataeu Vial has led to it deteriorating.   (updated Feb 2018)
6.9085760.630732 Holy Spirit Cathedral (Cathédrale Saint Esprit). Neo-Gothic cathedral built during German rule in 1913.   (updated Feb 2018)
 Wome Waterfall (Cascade de Womé). Jungle waterfall below ground level. There are no guides on site so it is best to bring a guide from town. Since the terrain and route to get there is rugged, a 4x4 is the best vehicle to travel in. The water is clean so you can take your swimming gear and go for a dip. (updated Feb 2018)
 Kpime Waterfall (Cascade de Kpimé), Kpimé Seva. A magnificent sight during the wet season. However as the water in the falls is diverted to a nearby dam, sometimes it shrinks to a mere trickle in the dry season. Guides are available at the falls. (updated Feb 2018)
