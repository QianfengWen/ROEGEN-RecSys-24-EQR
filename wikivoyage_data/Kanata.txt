Understand[edit]
Ottawa River at Pinney Homestead
Kanata is a relatively new area that was developed in March Township in the 1960s. Many technology firms are headquartered in Kanata, including Mitel.
Canada's National Capital Region is not a separate region like the District of Columbia or Australian Capital Territory but there is a National Capital Commission (NCC), funded by the federal government, which does various things in the city and region. One of the NCC's projects was a "green belt" around Ottawa; they expropriated a band about 10 miles (16 km) wide around the city, reforested parts of it and rented other parts back to farmers. Kanata was the first major development outside that belt, a planned community that won some design awards.
In 2001, anything and everything within the Ottawa-Carleton county line (including Kanata, Carp and Manotick) was merged into Ottawa despite some local opposition.

By plane[edit]
Scheduled domestic and international flights serve Ottawa International Airport (YOW IATA). Carp Airport (YRP IATA) serves only general aviation.
A taxi from Ottawa airport to Kanata will be expensive since it is quite a long way (southern extreme of the city to the extreme west). OC Transpo bus connections are good; route 97 serves the airport, and 88 goes to Kanata, meeting route 97 at Heron transitway station.

By car[edit]
Highway 417 (Trans-Canada Highway) goes right through Kanata.  Travelers heading west can travel from Ottawa.  Major exits for Kanata are March Road, Kanata Avenue, and Terry Fox.  Travelers heading east can arrive from Sudbury or North Bay, though the freeway part of the highway is numbered 417 and the non-freeway part of the highway is numbered 17.
About 12 km west of Kanata, is the interchange between Highway 417 and Highway 7, where Highway 7 terminates.  A branch of the Trans-Canada Highway travels between Sudbury and Kenata along Highways 69 and 400, Highway 12, and Highway 7.
