Map of Naperville
I-88 runs through the northern part of the city and goes to Chicago in the east and the Quad Cities in the west.
There is both long-distance and commuter rail service to Naperville. There are hourly trains from Chicago Union Station by Metra via the BNSF Line, with trains continuing to Aurora. Amtrak serves the city via its daily Southwest Chief between Chicago and Los Angeles and the California Zephyr between Chicago and San Francisco. Additionally, multiple Illinois Service routes call here. 41.779598-88.1455311 Naperville Station is located at 105 E. Fourth Ave, slightly north of downtown.

Get around[edit]
If you plan on bringing your rental car downtown, be prepared to park it in the large public parking structures, because finding a space in the downtown area can be tortuously slow work. There is often a spot in the three-story 41.772068-88.1468172 Central Parking Facility across from the Smoothie King, near the corner of Washington and Chicago Avenue. The second and third floors are accessible via Jefferson Avenue, which is a block down Washington.

In Downtown Naperville you'll find new high-end chain stores, specialty shops and restaurants inhabiting quaint old buildings which are still a reminder of when Naperville was a sleepy burg.
The Riverwalk is a 3.5-mile brick path that runs along the shore of the DuPage River and was originally inspired by the more famous Riverwalk in San Antonio, Texas.  It passes the 160 foot 41.770042-88.1567282 Moser Tower Millennium Carillon. With 72 bronze-cast bells, the Millennium Carillon is one of only four grand carillons in the world.
Public Art can be found throughout downtown and the Riverwalk.  They include "River of Life," a four-part ceramic mural just off West Jefferson; "Man's Search For Knowledge Through The Ages," a bas-relief in front of Nichols Library; and 41.771787-88.1513243 The Dandelion Fountain near the Riverwalk, among others.  To see more, follow the "Century Walk" public arts walk.
41.769303-88.1528384 The Naper Settlement. A reconstruction of the town as it looked in the 1800s when it was founded by trader Joe Naper.  It's much like the Joseph Smith Homestead in Nauvoo. 
Art Galleries abound in Naperville.  Check out Art & Frame Naperville, the Naperville Art League, the Anamart Gallery, Hozhoni Native American Art, North Central College and the Naperville Cultural Center.

Ribfest is Naperville's biggest yearly event. The four-day festival takes place in Knoch Park and usually features 15-20 rib vendors from around the country as well as bands like REO Speedwagon and Heart.
Naper Days, held annually at the Naper Settlement, is a much more manageable event with games, bands and the Taste of Naperville.
Haunted Naperville Tours are a unique way to see the city. The stories are hit-or-miss, but the fact that they're all based on first-hand encounters makes Naperville at least a little bit creepier.
Buy[edit]
Stop by the bustling downtown area to do some serious power shopping. There's nothing that can't be found anywhere else other than foods indigenous to the area, such as Chicago pizza, Italian beef sandwiches, etc.

 Naper Nuts and Sweets, 10 W. Jefferson Ave. Come to this old-fashioned candy shop in the heart of downtown Naperville for thousands of candies, freshly made popcorn, and chocolates. Also, visit the store to learn more about Operation: Caramel Popcorn, a project to ship popcorn to the military overseas. 
Eat[edit]

The fire pole still resides in a corner of the bar area. No, they won't let you slide down it. 
And you really should go to El Famous (both on Ogden Avenue) to wolf down a giant burrito.
If you want some really fresh, delicious seafood during lunchtime, head over to Succulent Seafood at Gartner Plaza (corner of Gartner Road and Washington Street) and order a pasta dish or a fish sandwich with any of a number of freshly prepared sauces as you wait.
 Cookie Dough Creations, 22 Chicago Ave, ☏ +1 630-369-4833. A fantastic dessert replacement to the more commercial Cold Stone. Order a scoop of ice cream and then a scoop of egg-free cookie dough to go on top.
