Map of Vihti


History[edit]
Archaeologists have found traces of human settlements on lakeshores since the Stone Age. First historical mention of Vihti dates to 1433 at time being a part of Lohja parish. Vihti parish was founded on 1507 when first vicar was appointed and (now ruined) St. Bridget’s Church was built. 
From 1950 to 2021, Vihti’s population has almost tripled (and Nummela’s population increased tenfold) due to massive growth of the Helsinki region.

Orientation[edit]
Centre of Vihdin kirkonkylä
From the traveller's perspective, Vihti can be divided into three areas:

60.33424.321 Nummela is a town and the municipality seat. With the population of 15,000 (2016), it holds roughly half of the municipality's population. Here's where you can find most of the shopping options, restaurants, nightlife, etc.
60.41724.3262 Vihti  or Vihdin kirkonkylä (the parish village) is a much smaller town, yet more historical and a former municipality seat. It is often abbreviated as Vihti kk. In road signs and bus windows Vihti refers to this particular town, not the municipality as a whole.
The surrounding rural area (including small settlements like Ojakkala, and Otalampi) has very limited shopping and eating options but some of the top attractions of the area.
