A view of the township by the coast
Southport is Australia's southernmost town, found in the Huon and Far South region of southern Tasmania. The small town of 149 (2021) was a whaling station in the 19th century, but today, it isn't known for anything, apart from its trivial status.
Southport marks the southern terminus of the Huon Highway, and is a popular quick stopover for travellers heading towards the End of the Road in Cockle Creek.


Understand[edit]
Get in[edit]
43°26′5″S 146°58′29″EMap of Southport (Tasmania)
The only sealed highway or road to Southport from the north is the Huon Highway (A6), a highway connecting Southport to Kingston via Huonville. The town is about 96 km (60 mi) southwest of Hobart, including the distance on the Southern Outlet, 85 km (53 mi) from Kingston, and 58 km (36 mi) from Huonville. The road is mostly a good quality 2-lane road with a shoulder up until Dover, from where it loses its shoulder, despite being an A-route.
From Cockle Creek or Recherche in Southwest National Park, use C636 and C635 up north and then turn right at A6 just to the north of Southport.
