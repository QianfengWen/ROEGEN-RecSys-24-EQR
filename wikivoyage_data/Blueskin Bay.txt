Blueskin Bay is in Otago, New Zealand, 25 km north of Dunedin, 25 km south of Palmerston, and 350 km south of Christchurch. The area's small towns and villages of Waitati, Warrington, Seacliff, Evansdale and Doctors Point attract lifestyle-commuter types who work in the city and alternative dudes who want to do their own thing.


Understand[edit]
Blueskin Bay is an estuary where the Waitati River and Careys Creek meet the Pacific Ocean, on the east Otago coast. New Zealand's main north-south rail line, State Highway 1 and "The Other 1" all pass through here. The Bay lends its name unofficially to the surrounding district which is geographically and socially on the fringes of Dunedin. There is an unusually large proportion of Germans in Waitati.
