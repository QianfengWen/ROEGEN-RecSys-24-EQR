Salalah is the capital city of Oman's southern Dhofar region. It is the second largest city in the Sultanate, and has the distinction of being the Sultan Qaboos' birthplace. For most visitors, Salalah is the gateway to Oman’s most southerly governate of Dhofar – a historically independent, and culturally and ecologically unique region.


Understand[edit]
Central Salalah
As the traditional regional capital, the city’s history stretches back two millennia, when, thanks to its strategic location, it was an important stop on the frankincense and silk trading routes. In the 19th century the region was incorporated into the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, and Salalah served as the country’s capital from 1932 until the accession of Sultan Qaboos in 1970, who relocated the capital to Muscat. Salalah was the Sultan’s birthplace in 1940, and his mother was a member of a prominent regional Jebbali tribe; to this day the Sultan maintains close ties to the city.
Today Salalah is still known for the cultivation and trade of frankincense (albeit now on a smaller scale), and is famous for its summer khareef (monsoon) and annual Salalah Festival, when visitors flock to the region to escape the blazing hot temperatures elsewhere on the Arabian peninsula. As lodging and eating establishments outside the city are scarce, it serves as a useful and interesting base for travellers wanting to explore the wider area at any time of year.

Read[edit]
Maria Dekeersmaeker, The DNA of Salalah, Dhofar: A Tourist Guide. Written by a Belgian journalist based in Salalah, this unusual book is a treasure trove of facts and history, organized thematically.
Climate[edit]
Most visitors come to Salalah during July and August to enjoy the annual khareef, when the nearby wadis are full of water. Occasionally streets flood, and ocean currents are too strong for swimming or diving. The crowds leave in September along with the rains, but the vegetation is still green, and hotel prices have started to come down.
Diving is only possible during the dry season, from October to the end of May, and this is also the optimal time for bird watching. May and especially June are the hottest months of the year, with humidity steadily increasing until the rains bring relief again in late June or early July.

Get in[edit]
17°0′53″N 54°5′44″EMap of Salalah
By plane[edit]
 Oman Air. Flies from Muscat to Salalah at least three times a day, with a flight time of 1hr 30min. Operates direct international flights from Dubai W-Sa, with a flight time of some two hours, as well as to Jeddah Th and Sa, with a flight time of 2hr 50min. 
 Air Arabia. Flies from Sharjah on Su M W Th, with a flight time 1hr 45min. 
 Qatar Airways. Operates direct flights from Doha 3 times daily, with a flight time of 2hr 10min. 
Beware, the taxi from the airport is 10 or 20 times the normal taxi rate.

By car[edit]
It's a very long drive from Muscat
Driving to Salalah from Muscat takes roughly 12 hours, and can either be an amazing and memorable experience, or a very uncomfortable one depending on what kind of traveller you are. The first 5 hours are very scenic, as you pass Rusayl, Nizwa and other small towns. However, it's barren desert and oil fields for most of the remainder of the trip, with the only larger settlements along this stretch being Haima and Thumrait just one hour before Salalah.
Travelling at night is usually better than driving in the heat of day (arriving in Salalah at night is a must, as the city lights from the high-altitude entry point are gorgeous). Watch out for renegade dunes on the way. There are several stops along the way for food, drinks, a cigarette break, or nature calls – you should take every opportunity to stop, as there might not be another one for many more kilometres. As of 2019, many petrol stations do not accept credit cards, so you should have cash with you. Lodging on the road is not good; plan your trip so you do not have to sleep on the road.

By bus[edit]
17.01887454.0984151 ONTC Bus Station (next to the New Souq / Central Market), ☏ +968 23 292773, fax: +968 23 202721, info@ontcoman.com. Oman National Transport Company runs buses to/from the Ruwi station in Muscat three times daily, with the trip lasting 12 hours. RO 6 (one-way), RO 11 (return). 
Bus transport to/from Muscat is also offered, both with identical fares, by:

 Malatan Trading, As Salam St, ☏ +968 23 211299. 
 Bin Qasim Transport, ☏ +968 23 291786. 
By boat[edit]
There is at least one operator in Muscat that will charter you to Salalah.
Cruise ships stop regularly at the commercial 16.946754.00352 Salalah Port, west of the city. Shuttle buses transport visitors from the ship to the port entrance, and taxis are also available. Visitors need to bring only their cruise boarding pass and their Tourist Entry Permit.

Get around[edit]
On foot[edit]
It is possible to explore parts of Salalah on foot, as most places of interest are close to each other. During warmer times of year, though, walking may not be the best idea.

By taxi[edit]
The usual unmetered Omani taxis operate here. Negotiate the price before getting in. In 2021, a ride within the city was 1 rial. Most of the time, regular taxis were cheaper than the ride-hailing app Otaxi, but the app can be used to estimate a price.

By car[edit]
If you hire a car, 2WD cars are adequate for most sights within Salalah itself. Outside of Salalah, however, many places of tourist interest lie off road, and SUVs are recommended particularly during the khareef season because of slippery terrain. Book your car well in advance if you plan to visit during this peak period, as rental agencies often run out of vehicles.

Roadside fruit stand
If you decide to visit places outside Salalah city (good advice for traveling anywhere in Oman), remember to carry some food packed for emergencies (fruits, fruit juices, sandwiches recommended) as there are few restaurants outside the city.

Sleep[edit]
During the annual khareef from July-September the population of Salalah balloons with visitors from elsewhere in Oman and the Persian Gulf, so if you plan to visit during this time it is essential to make reservations well in advance.

Budget[edit]
17.01965654.110171 Al Hanaa Hotel, 23 July St (across from Lulu Hypermarket), ☏ +968 23 298305, +968 23 290274, alhanaa@omantel.net.om. Within walking distance of downtown.

Splurge[edit]
17.00881754.1512866 Crowne Plaza Resort Salalah, Dahreej, ☏ +968 23 235333. Check-in: 2PM, check-out: noon. A better alternative for luxury accommodation as the property is much larger than the Hilton and more importantly it is close to the city centre. RO 72+/night. 
16.98136154.0153847 Hilton Salalah, As Sultan Qaboos St, ☏ +968 23 211234, fax: +968 23 210084. Check-in: 2PM, check-out: noon. A popular choice for European visitors.

A beach resort providing a myriad of activities including tennis, volleyball, and badminton courts, petanque, and beach football. Doubles OR 132+. (updated Jan 2017)
Connect[edit]
Mobile coverage using Oman's providers is close to flawless, but roaming can sometimes be slow. There are several internet cafes around town, but speeds are inconsistent. Prices vary, but are usually cheap. You can also buy a tourist SIM card from any of the two main phone companies.

Stay safe[edit]
Salalah is a very safe place. However, the Salalah (Arab) way of driving might need some getting used to for non-Arabs.
Don't go swimming in the sea or permit toddlers/children to wander off at beaches. The sea has very strong ocean currents and the seabed has a steep drop off, making it very unsafe for swimmers, experienced or beginner.

Cope[edit]
Remember to carry your passport and visa papers with you wherever you go, at least photocopies, as you can expect local police or military patrols to check on you when you least expect them to show up, even if you are within city limits (a routine procedure to check for illegal workers and immigrants).
It's advisable for women to bring conservative clothing, especially if travelling outside the city. A general rule is to keep shoulders and knees covered. Western swimwear is acceptable on private hotel beaches, but not on public beaches where one-piece suits, or even t-shirts and swimming shorts, are preferable. Keep a sarong handy.
Bring plenty of water and sunblock if travelling outside the city.

East[edit]
Taqah coastal city is 35km away on Highway 49, and Mirbat also on the coast is an hour's drive.

West[edit]
To the west is Mughsayl with its famous blowholes, and some dramatic coastline (see Itineraries in Dhofar).
