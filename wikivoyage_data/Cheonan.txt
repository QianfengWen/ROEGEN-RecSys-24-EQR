Cheonan (천안, 天安) is a city in South Chungcheong, South Korea. Cheonan is a name derived from heaven. This is because King Taejo of Goryeo named it the "Most important place under the sky." Also, to this day, Cheonan citizens still call Cheonan the most comfortable place under the sky and joke that it is safe from natural disasters such as typhoons.


Understand[edit]
Cheonan is located in the northeastern area of Chungcheongnam-do Province. It is adjacent to Cheongju-si and Jincheon-gun of Chungchengbuk-do on the east, Asan-si on the west, Gongju-si and Sejong Metropolitan Autonomous City on the south, and Pyeongtaek-si and Anseong-si of Geonggi-do on the north. Cheonan, located at 83.6 km south of Seoul, is considered a central city, geographically speaking. It is a gateway to the Seoul National Capital Area and the western region of Chungnam, a transportation hub connecting national roads, railways, expressways and local roads, and a junction of the three southern provinces.

Climate[edit]
The average temperature in Cheonan city is 11.8 °C each year. The average annual rainfall is 1229 mm. Fine dust levels can affect travel. Cheonan has a lower density than Seoul, but due to the influence of a coal power plant in Chungcheongnam-do, it has a higher density than Gangwon-do. Therefore, it is necessary to check the concentration of fine dust here.

Reservations for train tickets can be made here. As the site runs in English, Chinese and Japanese, foreigners will also be able to book it easily. You can also see information about reservations, cancellations, refunds, and charges here.

Buy[edit]
The Shingsegae shopping center is where most Cheonanites go for their local shopping of luxury items in Cheonan. The Galleria is an architectural marvel. It's won many design awards and is set over 9 floors. Definitely worth a taxi ride of ten minutes just to see the building. (If you go planning to buy take a LOT of money).
There is an Emart in the basement of the Shinsegae shopping complex.
Across the street from Shinsegae Department Store is a whole host of other venues to buy you much needed items. Once you exit the Bus Terminal, you'll see the crowds flowing across the street at every green pedestrian light. Over there you'll also find many more food options awaiting your tongue and stomach.

Eat[edit]
Cheonan is famous for Sundae and Hodu-gwaja. Sundae is made by adding seonji, perilla seeds, cabbage, green onions, red pepper, and glutinous rice to the pig's intestines. In the early 1960s, a ham factory was built around Byeongcheon. There were many shops that made sundae to deal with the pig by-products. That's why Cheonan's Sundae became famous. There are many famous sundae gukbap shops in Cheonan. Sundae gukbap is a Korean soup with sundae. But it can be a strange food for foreigners. Some people dislike the unique flavor and taste of Sundae gukbap, so please refer to it.
