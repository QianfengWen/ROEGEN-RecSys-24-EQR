Get around[edit]
See[edit]
 West Texas Trail Museum, 100 E Weston, ☏ +1-307-756-3496, fax: +1-307-756-9347, wttmuseumdirector@rtconnect.net. It's a typical museum for the region with everyday objects and local history stuffed so full at first it feels cramped. With the museum being so quiet and standing so close to those well used tools or carefully saved mementos it becomes a personal experience with Moorcroft's history. Along the hallways are old photos and there is a sizeable mineral display for such a small museum. Free.
