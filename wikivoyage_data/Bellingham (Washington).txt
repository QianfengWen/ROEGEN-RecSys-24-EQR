Bellingham is a city in the North Cascades region of Washington State. Also known as the City of Subdued Excitement, this city of 92,000 people (2021) is the northernmost city in the contiguous 48 states. 


Understand[edit]
Bellingham Bay and Lummi Island
Its status as the northernmost city is not widely known, as the state of Maine in the Northeast often appears to be further north on many maps. It was formed in 1903 when the cities of New Whatcom and Fairhaven consolidated from what were once four separate settlements. The local economy got its start in resource extraction, notably coal and timber. The Georgia-Pacific mill on the waterfront, whose site is now being redeveloped into a dynamic mixed-use neighborhood, sustained the local economy for many years.  Employment has diversified from heavy industry to education, services, tourism, and retail.
Situated on Bellingham Bay, you can venture from downtown and in minutes be in rural farmland, the North Cascades or out on the salt waters around the San Juan Islands. Bellingham is about 80 miles north of Seattle and 55 miles south of Vancouver, BC. Bellingham is the seat of Whatcom County.
The historic Fairhaven District at the south end of the city is probably the most tourist-oriented area, with a number of nice shops and restaurants. Many of the buildings in Fairhaven date back to the late 19th and early 20th century. Beautiful historic homes overlook the bay from the South Hill neighborhood, just north of Fairhaven. Western Washington University on the flank of Sehome Hill boasts an outdoor sculpture garden and adjoins the Sehome Hill Arboretum, with a number of trails and a lookout tower at the top. Downtown lies to the north of the University. Although less touristy than Fairhaven, it is still vibrant during regular business hours, and caters to college revelers at night.

Culture[edit]
Environmentally friendly practices, such as recycling, are part of the culture here. Bellingham is known for being a town that cares for its environment and its residents enjoy the many outdoor activities the region supports. Outdoor adventure is a key reason why people live and visit here. Activities range from skiing on nearby Mt. Baker to whale watching near the San Juan Islands.
The city's downtown has a variety of locally owned businesses, fine dining and nightlife options. It is also the cultural core of the city, with an eclectic mix of museums and performance venues all within blocks of each other. Coffee is a way of life in the Northwest, and Bellingham certainly has its share of local espresso stands.
Western Washington University attracts students from across the region to Bellingham. This keeps the city relatively young and vibrant, and contributes to an unusually rich local cultural scene. WWU is also home to one of the largest & finest collections of outdoor sculpture on the West Coast, featuring works of internationally renowned artists including Richard Serra, Isamu Noguchi, Beverly Pepper and Anthony Caro.
While the community is growing, it retains much of its authentic self and its commitment to a laid-back, progressive style.

Fairhaven is served by Exit 250, and downtown is served by Exit 253 Lakeway Drive.A scenic alternative when coming from the south is Chuckanut Drive (State Route 11), a winding road that follows the side of Chuckanut Mountain along the water overlooking the San Juan Islands. Turn off I-5 at Exit 231, reach the village of Bow at State Route 11, and turn right (north). Expect to take an extra 20 minutes to reach downtown. This route is also popular with cyclists (warning: narrow shoulders) and has been used frequently for national car commercials.
Another rural alternative in the eastern part of the county is State Route 9, which parallels Interstate 5 and can be accessed south of Whatcom County via Skagit County.  This route carves through a valley east of Stewart Mountain and the Mt. Baker foothills. On a two-lane highway, you pass through small towns and by various farms, follow the south fork of the Nooksack River, and end up at the border community of Sumas on the U.S. and Canadian border. To connect back to Bellingham, visitors should go west on Highway 542 when it intersects with Highway 9.

Some Whatcom County roads outside of Bellingham are referred to by locals with a preceding the: Guide Meridian is "The Guide," and so on.

Stay safe[edit]
Crime[edit]
The crime rate is relatively low for an urban area by American standards. Violent crime perpetrated by strangers is nearly unheard of, but property crime is more common. If you are parked at a trailhead or in a park, keep your valuables out of sight, or better yet leave them where you're staying.
There are few areas of the city that couldn't be considered safe at all hours of the day and night. The downtown bar scene sometimes attracts a drunk and somewhat rowdy crowd at night, and a few street corners downtown attract groups of loiterers that have occasionally become belligerent. But overall no unusual precautions need be taken.  Certain areas in Alabama neighborhood should be avoided.

Rail/trail crossings[edit]
When hiking in the area, it's not unusual to have to cross the railroad tracks that hug the shoreline south of the city, or in some cases walk along the tracks (though both are considered trespassing). Stay alert: while the many freight trains that pass through make plenty of noise, the passenger trains are surprisingly quiet and can easily sneak up on an unwary hiker.

Cope[edit]
Bellingham's winters are often long and rainy, and it's the northernmost city of its size in the lower 48 states. If you visit between the months of October and May be prepared for a good deal of wind and precipitation.

Consulates[edit]
All foreign consulates are in Seattle.

48.7734-122.47376 St. Joseph Medical Center, 2901 Squalicum Pkwy, ☏ +1 360-734-5400. Operated by a not-for-profit healthcare system.   (updated Mar 2023)

Go next[edit]
Mount Baker: A glacier-covered volcano with a popular outdoor recreation area and ski resort, east of Bellingham on Mount Baker Highway, Highway 542.
Chuckanut Mountains  has numerous hiking trails south of the city. Lookout (Galbraith) Mountain offers some of the best mountain biking in the area. Chuckanut Drive (state route 11) is a scenic drive leading south of Bellingham overlooking the Salish Sea, while hugging the cliffs of these mountains
North Lake Whatcom Trail is a treat on hot summer days, as it has numerous spots to take a dip in the lake or just take in the scenery. Follow North Shore Drive nearly to the end and follow the signs to the trail head. Come early, as the insects can be a bit overwhelming in the evening.
Bellingham Bay and the local rivers and lakes provide for some great boating opportunities. Rent a sailboat or kayak on the Bay or Lake Whatcom. Join a charter trip to the stunning San Juan Islands or Victoria. Watch the mighty Orca whales glide majestically in their home waterways. Take an exhilarating raft trip on the Nooksack River. Spending time on the water is a great way to experience Bellingham.
North Cascades Highway: No major city in Washington has quicker access. Take I-5 south to exit 232 Cook Road, and turn left. Make another left turn when you meet the highway in the town of Sedro Woolley (4.5 miles).
San Juan Islands by boat, or commuter plane from the airport
Vancouver: Just an hour north of Bellingham across the border in Canada, this beautiful city hosted the 2010 Winter Olympics.
Seattle: Surrounded by water, mountains and picturesque isles, this city has something for everyone. About 2 hours south of Bellingham on I-5.
