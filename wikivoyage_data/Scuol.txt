By train[edit]
The 46.79410.28671 railway station of Scuol-Tarasp is at the end of two lines of the Rhaetian Railway and as such all trains end here. There are two hourly trains:

R train from Pontresina (1h 20min) via Samedan (1h 10min). This train runs along the Engadin valley.
RE train from Disentis (3h 30min) via Chur (2h) and Klosters (40min). This train travels through the Vereina tunnel and comes all the way from the Surselva.
