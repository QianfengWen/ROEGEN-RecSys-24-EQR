Map of Jeffersonville (Indiana)

Interstate 65, which crosses the river on the John F. Kennedy and Abraham Lincoln Bridges (respectively carrying southbound and northbound traffic), connects Jeffersonville with Louisville and other points between Chicago and Mobile, AL. Interstate 265, with the 2016 opening of the Lewis and Clark Bridge to Kentucky, offers a bypass around the northern end of the city. The 65 and 265 crossings are tolled, with all-electronic tolling (no toll booths). The lowest toll rates are available only to drivers with transponders issued either by the local tolling authority or the multi-state E-ZPass consortium.
Small aircraft can fly into Clark County Airport, 5 miles north in Sellersburg. Passenger jet service is available at Louisville International Airport, 8 miles south off of I-65 and I-264.
Amtrak discontinued service to Jeffersonville and Louisville in 2003.

By phone[edit]
Most telephone numbers in Jeffersonville, and the rest of the Indiana side of the Louisville area, consist of +1 812 plus a seven-digit number, but the entire 812 area is now served by an overlay complex of two area codes, with +1 930 as the second. A local or in-state telephone call now requires all 10 digits of the local number be dialed (omitting just the leading +1 from a local landline call).
Signage on many established businesses may still display the original seven-digit numbers; dial 812 before these if no area code is indicated.
