52.9287-3.06162 Chirk Aqueduct. 70-foot (21 m) high and 710-foot (220 m) long navigable aqueduct that carries what is now the Llangollen Canal across the Ceiriog Valley   
52.915-3.1973 The Ceiriog Valley (Dyffryn Ceiriog). This beautiful valley follows the Afon Ceiriog river from its source in the Berwyn Mountains, 18 miles to its confluence with the River Dee at Chirk. Former UK Prime Minister (from 1916–22) David Lloyd-George described the valley as A little bit of heaven on Earth, and it has changed little since his time. Despite its proximity to the A5, one of the main tourist routes into North Wales, the valley is little-known and rarely visited.
