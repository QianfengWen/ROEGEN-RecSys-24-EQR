Hudson is a town of 5,411 people (2021) in the Suroît peninsula, in Vaudreuil-Soulanges, in Montérégie région of Quebec, about 60 km west of Montreal. It sits on the southern shore of the Lake of Two Mountains, near the confluence of the Ottawa and St. Lawrence Rivers.
Two important stopovers on the road between Montreal and Ottawa (via Quebec highway 40 and Ontario highway 417, are located near the limit of Hudson (however, one is in the territory of Vaudreuil-Dorion and the other in Rigaud); these service areas offer food, lodging, convenience stores, gas and other services to motorists. In addition, Hudson offers a range of infrastructure and recreational tourism activities.


Understand[edit]

Although it's now an easy 45-minute highway drive from Montreal, it used to be an isolated village of mainly Scottish and English farmers. It was briefly a lakeside cottage getaway. Most residents of Hudson get out of town by spending the day in Montreal or the West Island, with occasional trips to Ottawa.
Much of its past can still be seen today, with a largely anglophone population, turn-of-the-century homes, pretty lakeside views, tree-lined streets and the English-inspired architecture of the town centre. These features make it a popular daytrip for Montrealers, particularly in the summer.
Travellers can benefit from waterfront infrastructure and services for nautical activities on the Ottawa River, downstream from the Carillon dam, on Lac-des-Deux-Montagnes. There is a scenic mountain there, as well as sucreries, i.e., maple syrup farms where tourists can go for a hayride and try a traditional Quebec meal.

Geography[edit]
The village of Oka is across the Lake of Two Mountains by ferry. In winter, an ice path is built to connect the two shores. The Viviry River (a tributary of Lac des Deux-Montagnes) separates the municipal territory in two.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Carillon-Pointe-Fortune and Hudson-Oka ferries cross the Ottawa River to the Outaouais and Montagnes Laurentiennes regions on the Quebec side. In winter, ice bridges are maintained at Carillon-Pointe-Fortune and Hudson-Oka to connect the two shores.

From the island of Montreal, take Autoroute 40 westbound. The most scenic route is to get off at Exit 35, turn right at Avenue Saint-Charles, and turn right at Chemin-de-l'Anse. This will take you along the shore of the Lake of Two Mountains (Lac-des-Deux-Montagnes) until you get to Hudson, at which point the name of the street will change to "Main". Drive another 4 km along Main road to get to the centre of town. The trip from downtown Montreal takes about 45 minutes (except during Montreal's rush hour, when it will often take 90 min).
From Ottawa, take Highway 417 eastbound. At the Quebec border, the highway changes its name to Autoroute 40. Get off at exit 22, turn left on Côte-St-Charles. At the end of Côte-St-Charles, turn right on Main. Drive 1 km to get to the town centre. The trip takes about 90 minutes.
Between Montreal and Ottawa, Highway 417 and Autoroute 40 are part of the main route of the Trans-Canada Highway.

By train or bus[edit]
The Exo Vaudreuil-Hudson Line provides commuter service from Montreal. Most trains end at Vaudreuil, requiring a bus transfer.
You can also get to Hudson by taking Montreal's public transit to:

John Abbott College in Montreal's suburb of Ste-Anne de Bellevue, and connecting with a CIT La Presqu'Ile bus to Hudson at 15:29, 16:29 and 17:47.
Vaudreuil train station on the AMT[dead link] Montreal-Vaudreuil line, and connect with a CIT La Presqu'Ile bus at 16:54, 18:12, and 19:03.
Cote Vertu Metro station and take a CIT La Prequ'Ile express bus to Vaudreuil. Expresses leave Cote Vertu every half hour from 15:00 to 19:00. You can then connect with the Vaudreuil-Hudson bus discussed above.
By ferry[edit]
A ferry operates during most of the spring, all of summer, and most of autumn taking cars, people and bikes from Oka to Hudson across the Lake of Two Mountains. It leaves from Main Road, just east of Bellevue Street. In the winter, the lake freezes over, and it is sometimes possible to drive over the ice across the lake from the ferry terminal to Oka (depending on weather conditions and ice thickness).

Get around[edit]
Map of Hudson (Quebec)
By car[edit]
The town centre is concentrated on Main Road. The centre of town can be traversed by car in two minutes. Driving the whole 20-km route of Main Road (which continues as Chemin de l'Anse in neighbouring towns) can be quite scenic, with views of large country houses, farms, trees, and the Lake of Two Mountains.

By taxi[edit]
For convenient and efficient transportation in and around Hudson, consider utilizing the local taxi services available. The taxi companies provide a reliable and comfortable option for getting around town, whether you're heading to a specific destination or exploring the scenic surroundings. With experienced drivers who are knowledgeable about the area, taxis offer a stress-free way to travel.

By bicycle[edit]
Although Main Road/Chemin de l'Anse is quite narrow, one can often find groups of cyclists riding along this scenic route on summer weekends. Be aware that the north-south streets off of Main Road (Bellevue, Cameron, and Côte-Saint-Charles Streets) have very steep inclines at some parts.

By foot[edit]
Hudson is a small town; the town centre can be crossed by foot in 20 min. Summertime is the best time to do this; in the winter, the cold and the wind make walking unpleasant.

See[edit]
The town's architecture is quite distinct from most towns in the greater Montreal area. Some buildings date back to the beginning of the 1900s, while the new buildings have tried to copy some of the older building's features.
Most people who come to Hudson take a drive down Main Road to see the old houses, foliage and lakeviews. This is popular in the summer but perhaps best done in October, when the leaves turn fall colours.
