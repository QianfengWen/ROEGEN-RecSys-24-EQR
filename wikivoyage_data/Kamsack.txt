Map of Kamsack
Kamsack is located in the scenic Assiniboine River Valley and is surrounded by rolling hills, forest area and farmland. The community is the gateway to Duck Mountain Provincial Park.

History[edit]
The lands around what is now Kamsack were settled in the 1880s by a handful of agricultural settlers. The farming area around Kamsack was well settled by 1905. These farms consisted of a variety of ethnic groups which are still present to this day: Doukhobors, Ukrainians, Europeans, Americans and Eastern Canadians were all among the early settlers to the area. In 1903 the Canadian National Railway and Kamsack railway station were built which literally forced the birth of Kamsack. The town is still today served by Via Rail passenger service. The name Kamsack came from an early post office of the same name, which was located in one of the early settlers' homes. The name "Kamsack" came from an indigenous word meaning "something vast and large". In the 1900s, the Doukhobor village called Nadezhda (Russian: Надежда, 'Hope'), some 15 km (9 mi) to the northwest of Kamsack, was the site of the annual general meetings of the Doukhobor community of Saskatchewan. By around 1910, the meeting site had shifted to the village of Veregin, some 10 km (6 mi) west of Kamsack, where a permanent Doukhobor central office was established.
