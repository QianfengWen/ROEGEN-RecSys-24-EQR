Mazatec women perform a traditional dance
Huautla, formally known as Huautla de Jimenez, is a small town in the Sierra Mazateca mountains of Oaxaca (state) in southern Mexico. The town is home to an indigenous group called the Mazatec whose shaman reportedly indulge in psychoactive mushrooms and morning glory seeds among other mind-expanding fungi and plants. Its good work if you can get it. The town is also a magnet for outdoor enthusiasts, particularly for cave explorations. The town is one of Mexico's designated Pueblos Mágicos.


Understand[edit]
Curandera in Huautla
Huautla was thrust into the spotlight of early 1960s counterculture when an article appeared in Life magazine about the "magic mushrooms" of the Mazatec people of Oaxaca, particularly a curandera named Maria Sabina in Huautla. Timothy Leary, John Lennon, and Bob Dylan were among the earliest pilgrims to visit the town in order to experience the kind of hallucinations described in the article. 
The people of Huautla did not appreciate the publicity and they chafed at their budding fame over ancient practices that they preferred to keep to themselves. Maria Sabinas was ostracized by the community and arsonists burned her home. 
While travelers can still find locals who will sell them psychoactive mushrooms, they are unlikely to find a shaman willing to perform the ceremonies that would guide them to enlightenment. Nobody wants to invite the kind of misfortune that met Maria Sabinas after she welcomed the foreigners.
