Globe is in the Mogollon Rim in Eastern Arizona. Globe was founded in 1875 as a mining town, and still is dependent on mining. The town has many well-preserved buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and can make a pleasant stop.


Understand[edit]
Together with the neighboring town of Miami, Globe and the surrounding area are often referred to as Globe-Miami.
Globe's economy remains heavily dependent on the service industry, and the mining industry, and as of 2016 the city was home to one of the few operating copper smelters in the United States.
Its population in 2018 was about 7,300.

History[edit]
Besh-Ba-Gowah, about one mile south of Globe, was occupied by Salado populations between AD 1225 and AD 1400.
In 1875, prospectors found silver in the San Carlos Apache Reservation, including an unusual globe-shaped silver nugget. In just four years, the silver began to give out, but by then copper deposits were discovered.
By February 1881, Globe was the Gila County seat. Coming with Globe's new importance as the county seat came a stagecoach line linking it to Silver City, New Mexico.
Due to Globe's relative isolation from the rest of Arizona and its proximity to the San Carlos Apache reservation, Globe remained a frontier town. Globe's history is laced with many historic events such as murders, stagecoach robberies, outlaws, lynchings, and Apache raids. Natiotish, a San Carlos Apache, left the reservation with a group of about 50 men and continued to attack ranchers and miners.
The Old Dominion mine was the principal copper producer in the Globe District. In the 1900s, the Old Dominion Copper Company in Globe ranked as one of the world's richest. The Old Dominion closed in 1931, and mining operations moved to nearby Miami. In retirement, the old mine workings serve as the water supply for Globe-Miami and the district mines.

Climate[edit]
Globe has a semi-arid climate, characterized by hot summers and moderate to warm winters. Globe's arid climate is somewhat tempered by its elevation, however, leading to slightly cooler temperatures and slightly more precipitation than Phoenix or Yuma.
Summers in Globe are hot, with daytime highs generally between 90 °F (32 °C) and 100 °F (38 °C). High temperatures topping 100 °F (38 °C) are not uncommon in July and August for Globe. Summertime lows are generally right around 65 °F (18 °C).
Wintertime highs usually average between 55 °F (13 °C) and 65 °F (18 °C), and lows tend to be right at or above freezing (32 °F/0 °C).
