Go next[edit]
Solano
Batad. While the rice terraces of Banaue are mud-walled, those of Batad are stone-walled. They form an amphitheatre and are an impressive sight. 15 km on bad roads, followed by a 40-minute downhill hike, but worth it.  There are a number of hostels and guest houses in the small village there, overlooking the rice terraces.  If weather and time permit, Batad is probably a better place to spend the night than Banaue.  There is a public jeepney plying the Banaue to Saddle Point (start of trek to Batad village) route daily. Banaue to Saddle Point is around 2 to 4PM while the Saddle Point to Banaue jeepney is around 9:30AM to 10:30AM. They may take extra trips during the peak season (e.g. Holy week). Head on to the Banaue public market and ask around. Fare is ₱100 to ₱150 for tourists while the locals pay ₱45.
Baguio - A major town that several bus route through on their way north from Manila. Ohayami Trans has a daily trip to Baguio at 5:30PM and takes about 9 hr for ₱430 + fees
Metro Manila - Ohayami Trans has a daily trip to at 7PM and takes about 9 hr. Alternatively, you can get a jeepney to the junction just before Solano and catch a Manila bound bus - the bus will take around 8 hours but if you get a jeepney at 06:30 you can be in Manila by 5pm.
Bontoc and Sagada. By hiring a van in Banaue (ask in your hotel) you can visit these two centres as a day trip. Bontoc is a busy town but has an excellent museum of Ifugao culture. Sagada has the impressive Sumaging limestone cave (take a change of clothes and leave your best shoes in Banaue), burial chambers and hanging coffins. En route to Bontoc you pass the incredibly beautiful Bayo terraces. Make sure that your driver has the correct licenses before leaving however, as there are checkpoints in and around Bontoc and without the correct licenses you may be forced to turn around before your destination.
Hapao. A half-day trip from Banaue. More terraces. Steep steps lead down to some, giving easy access for a close-hand inspection.
