History[edit]
In 1798-99, 40 years after the founding of nearby Liverpool, settlers began to look toward the "North District", an area rich in timber, waterways and potential farmland.  A century of settlement and development in this once primarily Mi'kmaq (Aboriginal) area ensued and the early 1900s farming, lumbering and gold mining were flourishing.
Caledonia was settled in 1817 by six Scots and two Irishmen who were attracted by the good farmland on the drumlins.
A mainstay of the area for almost two centuries, the health of the lumbering industry was attributed to the variety and abundance of timber available.  Farming is still very important in the area and the establishment of the Queens County Farmer's Market in the summer is a popular draw for locals and visitors alike.
A gold rush in the late 19th century, caused a boom in the area of which evidence can still be seen today in some of the storefronts and buildings.

Get in[edit]
Caledonia is about 45 minutes north of Liverpool and about an hour from Annapolis Royal on Highway 8, also known as the Keji Scenic Drive.
