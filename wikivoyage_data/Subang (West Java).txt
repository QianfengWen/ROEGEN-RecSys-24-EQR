Subang is a city on the foothills of the Parahyangan mountains of Western Java in Indonesia, and the capital of the regency of Subang.


Understand[edit]
The regency of Subang extends all the way from the north coast (near the town of Pamanukan) to the Tangkuban Perahu volcano 80 km to the south (near the hot spring resort town of Ciater). The city of Subang is in the middle, on the foothills of the mountains of Parahyangan.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Subang is along the major Jakarta-Cirebon toll road (exit KM 110). Travelling from Jakarta to Subang takes about 1.5 to 2 hours if there is no congestion, but because of the traffic often significantly more. In addition, there is a trunk road leading from Bandung via Lembang and Ciater to Subang. However, because this road leads through the mountains, and the part near Bandung is often congested, it is often quicker to take the toll road via Cikampek.
