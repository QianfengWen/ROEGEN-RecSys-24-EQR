Havre-Saint-Pierre (population 3337, 2021) is a tiny seaside village in a remote corner of Quebec's North Shore, in the region of Minganie. The town is also noted for the excellent fishing, being made up largely of snow crab, scallops, and lobster, with excellent salmon and trout to be found in the numerous rivers and lakes.


Understand[edit]
Marina Havre-Saint-Pierre
Havre-Saint-Pierre is on Pointe-aux-Esquimaux on the Quebec North Shore (Côte-Nord). It began as a fishing and lumbering town when settlers arrived from the Magdalen Islands in the 19th century. The dialect spoken is more closely related to Acadian French than to Quebec French.
It is part of the regional of Minganie, on the Route des Baleines and the Route Nature aux mille délices (gourmet route).
The city hospital is the major employer in the region.  Tourism contributes significantly to the local economy due to the town's position near the Mingan Archipelago National Park Reserve, a park encompassing a large number of islands in Mingan Archipelago of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. It is noted for the unique variety of flora and fauna to be found there, such as puffins and the rare Mingan Thistle, and for the unique geological features on many of the islands referred to as "monoliths".
The town is a seaport handling ilmenite, an iron-titanium ore brought by rail from a Quebec Iron and Titanium Company mine 40 km (25 miles) northwest on the Romaine River.
Its many rivers and lakes include the Romaine River to the northwest and Manitou Falls on the Manitou River to the west.

History[edit]
In 1857, a group of Acadian families from the Magdalen Islands, who had been deported from Savannah (Georgia, USA), settled on Eskimo Point (Pointe aux Esquimaux). The first mass was held on in 1857, on the day of the feast of Saint Peter (Saint Pierre).
