Catedral de Tehuacán
Tehuacán is a good-size city of almost 300,000 people (2020) in Puebla (state). It is the second largest city in the state and is known for its nearby poultry farms and the rural scenery of the Balsas River Valley. It's a safe and pleasant town to pass a couple days with some fascinating historical sites and good restaurants.


Understand[edit]
Tehuacán is one of the oldest areas of human settlements in Mexico, and is believed by many anthropologists to have been an early agricultural area where corn (maize) might have been first domesticated almost 9,000 years ago. The city was occupied by different indigenous cultures over the centuries, including the Mixtecs. It is listed by UNESCO as a Biosphere Reserve (as Tehuacán-Cuicatlán Valley), the citation for which implies it is the origin of Mesoamerican civilization. They may be right since an agricultural base is necessary for big city-states with their leisure classes to exist.

 Cueva Coxcatlan (Cueva de Maiz, Coxcatlan Cave), ☏ +52 238 236 7238. 08:00 - 14:00. If you're interested in how humans came to populate the Americas, this will be a fascinating site to visit. This was the cave where, in the 1960s, American archaeologist Richard "Scotty" MacLeish discovered the oldest examples of domesticated corn production. 10,000 cobs of a small type of corn called teosinte. Radiocarbon dating showed they dated from 3600 BC. Don't expect anything big or elaborate, it's a small cave, but the locals are passionate about it, and anthropology geeks will be too. A second cave in the Valley of Tehuacan, known as Cueva Brava, was found nearby in the 1980s with similar evidence of early Mesoamerican corn production.
