Union City is a city of 70,000 people (in 2020) in the southern part of the East Bay portion of the San Francisco Bay Area region of California.  It is bordered to the north by the city of Hayward and to the south by the city of Fremont.  It is part of the Tri-Cities area, which consists of Union City, Fremont, and Newark.


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
When California began to experience incredible growth in the 1950s, Southern Alameda County developed quickly and the city of Hayward began to eye the townships to its south for potential annexation. To preclude such an event, a citizen's committee petitioned for incorporation; and on January 13, 1959, the City of Union City came into being, binding together the four townships of Union City/New Haven/Alvarado/Decoto. Tom Kitayama, who served on the citizen's committee, became its first mayor. He was the first Japanese American to hold public office in California, just 14 years after the end of World War II.
