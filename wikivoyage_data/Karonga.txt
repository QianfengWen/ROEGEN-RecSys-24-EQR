Karonga is a city in northern Malawi located on the coast of Lake Nyasa.


Understand[edit]
Karonga is the closest major town north of Tanzania on the coast of Lake Nyasa. Historically, Karonga was known as for its slave trading industry. Today, it is also noted for its prehistory, with a museum showing dinosaur fossils from the area. A discovery in 2009 of prehistoric human-made tools and a human tooth have put Karonga on the evolutionary map for being the potential "Cradle of Life," for humankind.
