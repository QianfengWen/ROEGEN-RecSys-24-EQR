Sion (German: Sitten) is the capital of the canton of Valais in Switzerland. With a population of 35,000, it is the biggest city in the canton and a regional centre. The cantonal administration as well as many of the higher schools are located here.


Get in[edit]
The train is probably the easiest way to make it into Sion. Half-hourly trains arrive to 46.2273897.3593861 Sion railway station from Brig and Geneva passing through all major towns in Valais. Regional trains also depart half-hourly in either direction. Eurocity trains on the Geneva - Milan line and seasonal TGV trains from Paris stop here at irregular intervals.
Sion lies on the A9 highway and has two exits (Sion-Est and Sion-Ouest) either of which can be used to access the city centre.

Get around[edit]

There are public buses[dead link] running around the city, however, the frequencies are not that great and a big part of the historical core of the city is not accessible by bus. The city is largely walkable and as such walking might be the most convenient way of getting around the city.

See[edit]
Basilique de Valère
The Basilique de Valère and the Château de Tourbillon are the two most prominent sights in Sion. They stand on two neighbouring hills and can be see from far. Nevertheless they are relatively easy to walk to from the city centre and the views are breathtaking.

The church (Notre-Dame de Valère) was built during the 12th and 13th centuries and obtained the rank of minor basilica at the time of the visit of Pope John Paul II in 1984.   (updated Mar 2016)

Buy[edit]
While Sion might seem like a bit of a backwater town to outsiders, it is actually the biggest city in the region. Here you can find a couple of the very few departmental stores of the Valais as well as well stocked supermarkets.
