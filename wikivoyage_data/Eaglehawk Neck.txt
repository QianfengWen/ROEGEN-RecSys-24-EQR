Teralina / Eaglehawk Neck is the narrow strip of land that marked the northern border of the Port Arthur convict site on the Tasman Peninsula. The 30-meter narrow strip was guarded by dogs to prevent convicts from escaping during the early 19th century – this line is now called The Dog Line, and there is a small museum explaining the historical significance of this narrow strip.


Understand[edit]
Get in[edit]
Eaglehawk Neck is about 50 km southeast of Sorell via the Arthur Highway (A9), which should take about 40 minutes (as the road is very windy) and is about 19 km north of Port Arthur. 
The only way of visiting Eaglehawk Neck is via car, and even if you did manage to somehow visit Eaglehawk Neck by some other means, most of the town's points of interest require a car.

See[edit]
-43.007902147.9342751 Tessellated Pavement (Eaglehawk Neck tessellated pavement), 380 Pirates Bay Dr. This is perhaps the best example of a tessellated pavement anywhere in the world – and hence why it's simply called Tessellated Pavement. It's where flat rock is divided into various different block-shaped sections, making it look like it was man-made. This rare natural phenomenon becomes even more spectacular during sunrise with water within the pans.  (updated Feb 2023)
-43.0136147.92522 Officers Quarters Museum (Eaglehawk Neck Historic Site) (cnr Arthur Hwy (A9) and Pirates Bay Dr). This is the remains of the officers' quarters, built in 1832 to prevent convicts in Port Arthur from escaping. The area was heavily guarded by military officers and fierce dogs for when the military officers went drunk. The site closed in 1877, around when the convict era was coming to an end. There is also a statue of a dog outside the museum as a symbol of what the area once was. (updated Feb 2023)
Tasman National Park[edit]
Fossil Bay
A small part of Tasman National Park encompasses Eaglehawk Neck, and is connected to Eaglehawk Neck via a small road (C338) and require a Tasmanian national parks pass to visit. 

-43.044147.94993 Devils Kitchen, Tasmans Arch Rd. Another natural phenomenon created by the crashing waves of the Southern Ocean/Tasman Sea which creates an impressive trench. There's a parking lot right next to the lookout, and it doesn't require much walking. (updated Feb 2023)
-43.036111147.9508334 Tasman Arch, Tasmans Arch Rd (C338). A massive natural bridge and sea cave (though it's probably too small to be considered as one), great for photos. Parking is available a few meters from the lookout.  (updated Feb 2023)
-43.0341147.94785 Blow Hole (Tasman Blowhole), 336 Blowhole Rd. Although its name is very unoriginal if you can't make it to Maingon Blowhole around 30 kilometers away, here's a good alternative. The blowhole is somewhat average compared to other Australian blowholes, so prepared to be disappointed if you've seen many other blowholes, but if you've never seen one, this is a good one to visit. (updated Feb 2023)
-43.03362147.949146 Fossil Bay Lookout, Blowhole Rd. A discrete but impressive lookout overlooking the water from the Southern Ocean/Tasman Sea that turns into a salty geyser before flowing towards the blowhole further west. (updated Feb 2023)
