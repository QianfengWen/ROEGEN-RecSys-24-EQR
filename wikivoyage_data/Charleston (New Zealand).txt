Charleston New Zealand with Paparoa Mountains in the background
Charleston is the first small town south of Westport on State Highway 6, in the northern part of the West Coast of the South Island of New Zealand. Located in the Buller District, it is a significant historical gold mining town once boasting more than 5,000 residents and more than 30 hotels and shops. On January 29, 1868, Robert Hannah set up his shoe shop in Charleston. His business grew to become the largest shoe manufacturer and retailer in New Zealand in the day. Hannahs continues as a major nationwide brand in New Zealand. 
Today Charleston is a quiet hamlet, offering dramatic views of the rocky coastline and the Paparoa Mountains from the tracks at Constant Bay. Explore the tiny bays, and witness the wild crashing waves of Constant Bay and Joyce Bay. Charleston has a myriad of other entertainments -- from river swimming to tramping the river tracks, glow worm cave exploration, rafting, and other adventures.


Understand[edit]
Charleston was once a thriving gold mining town after a goldrush in 1867. It is now a quiet village, and a gateway to adventures such as caving, vertical rock climbing, underworld rafting, kayaking and tramping.
