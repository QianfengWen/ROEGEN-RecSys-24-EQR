Understand[edit]
Panoramica plaza de armas Durango
It was named Victoria de Durango in 1828 in honor of Mexico's first president Guadalupe Victoria who hailed from here. 
Durango was founded by Captain Francisco de Ibarra in 1563. Prior to the city's establishment, it had been the refuge of tribes like the Nahoas, Zacatecans, and Tepehuanos. Ibarra picked the site for Durango due to its proximity to silver mining prospects and a mission called Analco that furnished essential supplies. Over the years, Durango saw the deaths of revolutionaries like Miguel Hidalgo during the War of Independence and direct action a century later during the Mexican Revolution. Then, more fun times came about with the introduction of filmmaking industry to the area, mostly related to westerns, which still colors the city's personality today.
The city was built on a rectangular street grid during the colonial era; it was not until the 1990s and much of the first decade of the 21st century that the city's government decided to clear some of the narrow colonial-era streets to build parks, plazas, and wider avenues that today continue to act as roads between the city's sprawling neighborhoods.
Durango sits in a bit of a bland high (~6200 ft) plain called the Valley of Guadiana, but sits close enough to the Sierra Madre Occiendental to the west to make excursions to sites like Parque Nacional Mexiquillo possible.

Climate[edit]
The city of Durango has a temperate semi-dry climate, with rains during the summer and slightly cold in winter with some frosts and drizzles. Summers are warm, reaching temperatures of up to 37 °C and regular rains in the months of June, July and August, reaching 400 mm of precipitation on average.
