Kraainem is a municipality on the outskirts of the Brussels Capital Region, administratively belonging to Flemish Brabant. It began as a rural village, but the expansion of Brussels has led to a fast-paced urbanization of Kraainem throughout the 20th century, and the municipality has become a popular residence for Eurocrats and expats alike.


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Little is known about the early history of Kraainem, aside from a few lithic artifacts found during agricultural activities. During the urbanization of Stokkel and South Kraainem, a large concentration of artifacts was discovered in 1928 near the border with St.-Pieters-Woluwe. These finds are dated to the meso and neolithicum.
Remains of Roman settlements were uncovered at the end of the 18th century, and a Roman villa once stood at the location of the current town hall. It was known as Villa Crainham, and gave Kraainem its name. None of the classical remains were preserved, unfortunately. It is known that Villa Crainham remained until the 11th century, from 1003 also a church is recorded in charters: crainham villa cum ecclesia. The Keulsebaan crosses through Kraainem, connecting Roman Brussels to Cologne, parts of which remain today.
Most of Kraainems current territory remained uninhabited throughout the first millenium. The northern urbanised area of Kraainem, High Kraainem, evolved from a Frankish court centered around what is now known as the Jourdain Castle. It was little more than a fortification surrounded by a few dwellings in the first half of the 9th century. A map from 1771 shows the historic division of Kraainem between a high and low area: to the west a church built upon earlier fortifications, and to the east numerous farm houses and a few smaller dwellings. It is unknown how the fortifications might have looked, but remains of a double octagonal moat can be traced to the west of the church and remained prominent until 1836. The development of High Kraainem remained limited to this core until well into the 19th century, with a survey in 1830 counting only 15 houses.
The north-west of Kraainem hosts a second urbanization core, Low Kraainem. It was more densely populated than High Kraainem, but of less significance because it lacked High Kraainems church and defensive fortifications. Low Kraainem owed its importance to the confluence of the Maalbeek in the Woluwe. Water mills were already constructed in 1397 to harness the power of the water for agricultural purposes, and a residential core grew around these mills. Around 1427 the St. Anthony chapel was built, taking advantage of merchants crossing through the area over the Keulsebaan. Laag Kraainem flourished economically in the 14th and 15th century, but the St. Anthony chapel had disappeared again by 1850. The Jozef Van Hovestraat and Jef. Thumasstraat are the oldest remaining streets of Low Kraainem.
Stokkel is Kraainem's third core of habitation, and evolved from a small settlement in the 12th century as part of the Woluwe abbey. The abbey ensured the soil was made fertile, thus allowing agriculture and the development of a settlement there. The area south of Stokkel, now a residential neighbourhood, remained forested until the 19th century and a source of income from hunting.

Pre-urbanised north Kraainem in 1836, with Low Kraainem around the Jozef van Hove Str. on the left and High Kraainem around the church (black building) on the right.
In the 19th century[edit]
At the end of the 19th century, Stokkel gained a tram connection to Brussels, which still exists today as tram 92. The improved accessibility started rapid urbanization of Stokkel, whereas northern Kraainem retained its rural characteristics. Until the end of the Second World War, only two unpaved roads connected Low and High Kraainem to Stokkel, and they were only usable a few months a year.
Wheras Stokkel urbanised, northern Kraainem developed slowly and became industrialised in the early 19th century. Paper mills had existed in Kraainem since the Middle Ages, and gained importance from the Belgian independence in 1830 to supply the new capital city of Brussels with newspapers. By 1892, it had evolved into a large industrial complex with a hundred craftsmen. A grain mill and brewery were also part of the complex. Today, Kraainem still bears the fruits of this history, and is considered one of the richest municipalities of Belgium.
From 1860 onwards, the monumental construction projects in Brussels drove the bourgeoisie out of the capital city, and many found refuge around Stokkel, which gave it a development boost and much of its wealth.

Modern Kraainem[edit]
Improvements to the road network after the First World War led to a gradual decline of Kraainem's industrial importance, and by 1932 all mills had been closed and demolished. Very little of that industrial heritage remains today, as the industrial sites were reclaimed as residential areas after the Second World War when the connections between north Kraainem and Stokkel were paved, and subsequently also northern Kraainem experienced accelerated urbanization. Kraainem's population increased from 1739 in 1920 to 3330 inhabitants in 1947.
From 1927 onwards, the area south of Stokkel became the focus of further residential development. Still a part of the Sonian Forest until then, roads were constructed in the southern half of Kraainem, and soon afterwards the first villas were built. The Second World War put a temporary stop to the development of South Kraainem, but from the 1950s the deforestation accelerated and had completely urbanised the area by 1967. Only a small fraction of the Sonian Forest was preserved in the southern most point of Kraainem. It permanently shifted the municipality from an agricultural, forestry and trade to a residential focus. Kraainem is almost completely urbanised, although a few meadows remain in the northern half of Kraainem.
In the second half of the 20th century, Kraainem transformed from a Flemish town into an international community. Migration of Wallonian citizens settling in Kraainem gave it an increasingly mixed urban population, to which Eurocrats were added after establishment of the European institutions in nearby Brussels.

Orientation[edit]
Situated to the east of Brussels and to the north of Tervuren, Kraainems territory has the shape of an hourglass, with at its narrowest point a width of only 160 m. It is scarred by numerous highways, cutting into Kraainem from the west and north side. The north of Kraainem is a mostly flat area in the valley of the Maalbeek river, towards the centre and south its topography becomes hilly.

Districts[edit]
50°51′9″N 4°27′51″EMap of Kraainem
Kraainem has 5 districts, each with a distinct personality.




 
Low Kraainem Historic commercial centre situated in and around the Woluwe valley where the Kleine Maalbeek joins the Woluwe river. Nothing is left of the industrial patrimony, including paper mills, grain mill or brewery that once brought Low Kraainem its wealth, but many 18th and 19th century farmsteads and houses exist today as evidence of its rich economic history.



 
High Kraainem The historical centre of Kraainem, founded in the 9th century. It was built around a stronghold and the famous Saint Pancras Church, but only the church remains. It is the current administrative centre of Kraainem, with its neoclassical town hall and numerous cultural buildings.



 
Central Kraainem's fastest developing district, with flourishing commercial ventures, and high rise residential apartment buildings. Only a few meadows and farms remind of the agricultural history of Kraainem, and open spaces are quickly receding under pressure of continued urbanization.



 
Stokkel Upscale residential and commercial district around the Dumon Square with expensive flats, and a large shopping district with countless boutiques.



 
South Residential district, occupying nearly half of Kraainem's territory, and responsible for much of its tax revenue. It borders the Sonian Forest to the south, a  UNESCO World Heritage Site.


Language[edit]
The presence of European Institutions in Brussels led to a second wave of immigration in the 1980s and 1990s, Kraainem's quiet residential areas and easy accessibility being appreciated by European Union and NATO officials. The large influx of immigrants has replaced most of the original Flemish population, and caused Kraainem to become more francophone from 1960 onwards, and fully multilingual since the 1990s as a result of the numerous expats residing in Kraainem. Only a small fraction of the population still speaks Flemish, French is the de facto lingua franca. Many residents, especially the younger generation, have a fair understanding of English, too.
Language is still a sensitive topic of discussion in Kraainem, the older generation in particular does not embrace multiculturality and blames francophone and European immigrants for higher prices for housing and the increasing crime. Residents usually avoid discussing the topic in public, and it is advisable to not take a stance in the discussion as this may lead to starting a brawl.

Proximity to the North Sea grants Kraainem a mild sea climate. Temperatures are between 4°C and 20°C most of the year.
In winter, periods of a few successive colder days are common, when winds from Scandinavia drop temperatures subzero. Snowfall is rare and limited to a maximum of a few cm per day, so it is not necessary to bring snow boots along when visiting Kraainem in winter. Main roads are deiced quickly by municipality services, but secondary roads may remain slippery until the late afternoon. Although not formally prohibited, ice skating on the ponds of the Jourdain park should not be attempted because the ice is rarely thick enough to support the weight of adults.
In summer, temperatures occasionally rise above 20°C with peaks up to 35°C. When temperature rises above 30°C, locals will seek shelter from the heat, and social life tends to slow down a bit (slower service in restaurants or bars, understaffed public services, etc.) A few successive hot days usually end with a thunder storm and plenty of rain. During hot days, the safe threshold for ozone may be exceeded, at which point it is recommended to minimize physical efforts. Factor 50 sunscreen is recommended in summer, and can be purchased in any supermarket such as the Carrefour Planet, Delhaize or Colruyt. During heat waves and droughts, restrictions on water usage may be temporarily in place to discourage inhabitants of wasting tap water. For example, it may be prohibited to fill swimming pools, wash vehicles or water gardens during periods of drought. However, tourists are not formally expected to know these exceptional regulations of temporary nature, and are therefore unlikely to be fined by police when caught.
The climate in Kraainem is humid the year round, and rain can be expected at any moment, regardless of the time of the year. Visitors should take an umbrella along, a waterproof jacket, or at least spare clothing in a backpack. Weather can change quickly, a cloudless sky in the morning may turn into rain in the afternoon and vice versa, so be prepared to handle both warm and rainy days when visiting. Being more inland than its neighbour to the east, Brussels, Kraainem is usually slightly hotter in summer and colder in winter than Brussels.

Tourist office[edit]
50.861364.465841 Tourist Office, Arthur Dezangrélaan 17, info@Kraainem.be. Tourist office at the Kraainem Town Hall. Provides free maps for walking and cycling, as well as tickets for the public transport system. Free. 
Get in[edit]
By metro[edit]
The easiest way to reach Kraainem is by metro, get off at station 50.84894.45851 Kraainem  (second last station on line  1   Weststation-Stokkel). Travel time is about 20 minutes from the 50.84654.35862 Brussels Central Station.

By tram[edit]
Tram  92  operated by the Brussels transport company MIVB traverses Central Kraainem from west to east, get off at 50.844764.466763 station Wilderozen.

By plane[edit]
Kraainem also shares an airport (BRU IATA) with Brussels, located to the north. A taxi from 50.89594.48284 Brussels National Airport to Kraainem will cost about €22.

By bus[edit]
Numerous bus lines and a tram line cross Kraainem. Keep an eye on the logo on the vehicles, as there are 3 companies operating buses in Kraainem, and their tickets are incompatible. Thus, make sure to get a ticket for the company you're traveling with. When in doubt, ask the bus driver for directions.
Brussels transport company MIVB operates 2 lines,  76  (direction Oppem) and  77  (direction Hippodroom), which also stop at the metro station.

By car[edit]
Proximity to the highways (E40 and R0) make it easily reachable by car if you choose to rent one, but during rush hour (07:00–09:30 and 16:00–18:00), massive traffic jams daily paralyze most of the highways surrounding Brussels, as well as the intercity between Brussels and Leuven.

Get around[edit]
Modern Kraainem has a strongly residential outlook with a well developed road network. It has been completely mapped on OpenStreetMap, which is likely more up to date than the official maps offered by the tourist office. Kraainem has excellent 3G coverage (see also Connect) but to prevent excessive bandwidth usage and costs related to streaming map data, it is recommendable to download the Kraainem map beforehand and view it offline on a mobile device.

On foot[edit]
From its total area of 5.8 km², only the northern half and centre are of touristic value, the south being residential areas without significant points of interest. With a good portable map, it is possible to cross Kraainem by foot in a single day. To most visitors, it will be most convenient to make a loop with start and end point at Kraainem metro station. From the metro station, walk east until the Grensstraat, then walk to the end until the Kapellelaan. On your way down the Kapellelaan, you'll encounter the Salesian monastery and further down the road, 't Kapelleke. Continue down the Jozef van Hovestraat, with numerous historic farmsteads and farmhouses, until the crossing with the Jef. Thumasstraat in Low Kraainem where you take right. Follow the Jef. Thumasstraat until the Old lease house on the corner, then take right and follow the Oudstrijderslaan with the Eclair park on your right until arriving in High Kraainem. At the Kraainem town hall, take left towards the Saint Pancras Church, and then right into the historic settlement of High Kraainem. Pass through the gate, turn left onto the Steenweg op Zaventem, and walk around the ponds of the Jourdain park, passing the Old vicarage and the Jourdain castle. Continue your walk towards the Vredesplaats/Konining Astridlaan where you'll cross the Peace Monument. Follow the Koningin Astridlaan, walking past the Industrial Heritage Monument, until the crossing with the Groenstraat. At the next intersection, turn right into the Jules Adantstraat past the Bouvier-Washer Cité, then finally at the crossing with the Wezembeeklaan turn right and continue your walk until the Kraainem Metro station. The entire tour takes between 2 and 5 hours, depending on the time you spend at the different landmarks.

By public transport[edit]
Kraainem is crossed by bus lines (316 and 352 from De Lijn), tram line  92  passing through Stokkel, and metro line  1   connecting Stokkel and Kraainem with Brussels. The 50.8494.458481 Kraainem Metro  station is a local transport hub and bus terminal serving as a transit station between metro and bus lines from the Flemish transport company De Lijn, the Brussels transport company MIVB and the Walloon transport company TEC. Each company has its own tickets, which are not accepted by other companies. You can buy tickets on each bus directly from the driver, however, and they are only marginally more expensive than purchasing them beforehand. Travelers are responsible for paying fare rates, drivers may not check the validity of your ticket, but if you're caught without a ticket (zwartrijden in Dutch) you can expect heavy fines up to €150. Aside from local transport, numerous long distance coaches also depart from Kraainem metro, but these require prior reservation and tickets.
The easiest way to plan your public transport journey is using online route planners. The best planner is the one from the national railway company NMBS. If you're familiar with Google Maps, the Transit function may also be used to plan your journey.

By bicycle[edit]
A dedicated bicycle road along the Hebronlaan.
Kraainem has an hilly topography, with the lowest point in the Maalbeek valley slightly below 40 m above sea level, the highest point is 120 m. Fortunately, inclinations are rarely steep, enabling convenient transport by bicycle. Unlike Brussels, no cycling experience in busy traffic is required; the few avenues and intersections with heavy traffic have dedicated cycle lanes. Many local residents own their own bike, and it is one of the most common modes of transportation. The 50.848594.459032 Villo bicycle rental system  is also available in Kraainem, with a rental station close to the Kraainem metro station. The bikes are rather heavy but of good quality, and can be rented starting at €1.60 per day, with a fee of €0.50 per half hour after the first hour. A debet or credit card is required to rent a bike, as the ticketing machine does not accept cash.

See[edit]
The 12th century Saint Pancras Church after the 2012 restoration.
The rich history of Kraainem, dating back to as early as the 9th century, leaves its numerous landmarks spread out over modern Kraainem. Many religious and agricultural historic buildings remain, and may be visited. Note that most of the historic residences and farmsteads are privately owned, and taking a close look may be regarded as trespassing by its residents. However, upon request, most owners will happily give tourists a tour and discuss the history in detail. With the exception of the Salesian monastery, all landmarks below can be easily reached by public transport.

Culture and architecture[edit]
50.862314.466341 Saint Pancras Church (Sint-Pancratiuskerk), Arthur Dezangrélaan 20/2, ☏ +32 2 720 02 61, benoit.goubau@outlook.be. Sa 17:00–19:00, Su 10:00–12:00. The oldest building in Kraainem, the Saint Pancras Church has its origins in the 12th century. The massive roman tower with walls up to 1.7 meters thick most likely had a military function. Initially, the church was added to the tower and had a simple rectangular shape. In the 13th and 14th century, the northern wing was added to the church. With financial help of the Affligem abbey, the small choir was transformed in the 16th century into the Gothic choir that remains today. Until the 18th century, the entrance to the church was a small door in the south wall, the side that now faces the Kraainem town hall. Around 1720, the entrance was moved to the current baroque gate in the tower. From 1170 onwards, the church underwent significant changes: the asymmetric layout was abandoned, and a third section was added under the same saddle roof. The current sacristy, pulpit and two confessionals were also added. The interior was enhanced with furniture that was not originally intended for the church: the origin of the organ is still a mystery, and in 1873 two altars were purchased for 100 francs each from a Brussels church. At the end of the 19th century, the church escaped a complete transformation in Neo-Romanian style, and a more humble design of Jules Van Ysendyck was chosen instead, which preserved much of the antique interior. In 1984, pastor Vanzulpele observed a depression in the archway above the choir, which started a sequence of restorations finally completed in 2012. The current interior is based on the interior after the renovations of 1770. The graveyard around the church is no longer in use and only serves to preserve the historic image of the building. Religious ceremonies are still being held on Saturday and Sunday, when the church can be visited. Free.  
Historic residential area of High Kraainem, with characteristic low houses with white painted walls.
Well preserved historic buildings in characteristic red bricks in High Kraainem.
50.862214.466982 High Kraainem (Hoog-Kraainem), Steenweg op Zaventem 54. Well preserved remains of the first residential activities in High Kraainem, dating from a Frankish settlement in the 9th century. The complex of interlocked houses and farmsteads, erected in the local sandstone but painted with white walls, is situated between the Saint Pancras Church and Jourdain castle. There is evidence of a stronghold historically situated west of the current location of the church, but it was demolished by the end of the 14th century because it lost its strategic importance. A map of 1397 only reports the location of the moats (fossa castri), which were eventually backfilled and repurposed. Today, no visible evidence remains of the stronghold's existence. From the 14th century to the 19th century, High Kraainem remained a small settlement: at the time of the Belgian independence in 1830, only 15 houses were counted in High Kraainem. Free. 
Old vicarage in Jourdain park, next to the Jourdain castle.
50.862574.468753 Old Vicarage (Oude Pastorie), Pastoorkesweg 1, ☏ +32 2 720 63 46. A vicarage built in 1652 with a foundation of sandstone and red bricks. The characteristic arc door and slate roof, typical for the era it was built in, have survived restoration efforts. It remained in use as vicarage until 1906, when a new vicarage was built next to the current town hall at Arthur Dezangré Avenue. The building was recognised as architectural heritage in 1976 and restored in 1990. One of the curiosities of the vicarage is a small mechanical single person elevator hidden in the tower under the saddle roof, but it has been out of service for years. The building hosts a restaurant by Maxime Collin.  
50.862014.469064 Jourdain Castle (Jourdainkasteel), Kasteelweg 4-6. The castle was built as a farmstead with a U-shape surrounded by multiple vegetable gardens, as documented in 1771. In 1846, the farmstead was expanded, surrounded by a brick wall, and transformed into a closed farmstead (vierkantshoeve). A barn was also added, but demolished in the late 20th century. It was purchased by doctor Delphin Gaillard in 1883 together with the surrounding park. He gave the 18th century farmstead its current castle appearance, with emphasis on traditional style elements: brick masonry, corners of white sandstone, stepped gables, small towers and a roof resembling a Chinese pagoda. The castle and park were then sold to Victor Jourdain who gave his name to the castle, and in 1980 the property was transferred to the Kraainem municipality which restored the building and used it as community center. The last restoration dates from 2003, when a lift was added. The castle is occasionally opened to the public for cultural events, and is classified as Flemish Architectural Heritage. It hosted a florist until late 1990s, which occupied the large veranda. Recreation grounds with a children's farm make the castle a popular attraction for local families with kids. (updated Jul 2017)
Salesian Monastery, a design by religious architect Paul Bellot in 1928.
50.854724.457085 Salesian Monastery (Klooster van de Visitatie), Hebronlaan 5. The order of the Salesians was founded in 1610 close to Annecy in France by Jeanne de Chantal and Francis of Sales, who gave his name to the order. On 12 February 1667, a monastery was founded in Brussels -- then part of the Southern Netherlands -- but the success of the order was strongly variable in time and by the first half of the 19th century it was nearly extinct in Brussels. A second start on 21 November 1845 had more success, and not even a century later the original location was too small to house the order. Architect Paul Bellot, born in 1876 and specialised in religious architecture, was tasked with the design of a new monastery located outside Brussels. Then still rural Kraainem was chosen because of its remote location, at the time there were no other buildings on the hill, and the closest settlement was Low Kraainem which was only accessible by a narrow unpaved road (now the Kapellelaan). Construction started in 1928, and by the end of 1930 when it was finished, the monastery had become a popular pilgrim destination. Unlike similar monasteries in Belgium, which started out small and were gradually expanded, the availability of sufficient space and budget allowed the entire site to be built at once between 1928 and 1930. All buildings thus show the same style elements, many of which were typical for the designs of Paul Bellot: polychrome bricks from Zandvoorde (a municipality close to Oostende near the Belgian coast) and extensive use of concrete for structural and decorative purposes. Art deco and brick modernism influences can be observed in all aspects of construction. Only the building sides facing the streets (Kapellelaan and Hebronlaan) are decorated (for example, a Madonna sculpture above the entrance), the sides facing the inner sanctum, gardens and orchards do not have any decoration. The architecture and degree of decoration reveals the originally intended purpose of the rooms in the buildings, a feature called architecture parlante. The facades are also hierarchically decorated, with the chapel as most important and thus most extensively decorated part of the structure. The interior resembles a Medieval monastery, with style elements of the Arabic and Mozarabic arts. Illumination was considered paramount by Paul Bellot, and windows are consequently large enough to illuminate the rooms they are intended for, without penalizing decoration. Much of the original woodworking, both indoor and outdoor, has been preserved, as evidenced by the oak inner doors and staircases. The monastery is still in use today, and remains the only Salesian monastery in Belgium. It is not normally opened to visitors, reservations are mandatory. The monastery can be reached from Low Kraainem by following the Jozef van Hovestraat and afterwards the Kappellelaan up the hill.  (updated Jun 2017)
50.861794.457426 't Kapelleke, Annecylaan 1. The chapel referred to as  't kapelleke by local residents (literally, the chapel) is located at the intersection point of the Jozef van Hovestraat, the Lijsterbessenbomenlaan, the Bossstraat and the Kapellelaan. At the time of its construction in 1932, there were no buildings around its current site, and with the exception of the Jozef van Hovestraat, all streets were unpaved roads. By 1932 however, the crossing became increasingly important because of the expansion of the Laag Kraainem residential area, and the construction of the Salesian Monastery along the Kapellelaan 1 km further between 1928 and 1930. As more streets were added in later years, a roundabout was constructed to divert traffic away from the immediate surroundings of the chapel and preserve the original roads. The chapel is one of the most iconic landmarks of Kraainem, and known by local children because of the adjacent kindergarten and primary school. The chapel is completely surrounded by buildings, and therefor lost most of its authentic outlook. Can be easily reached from Low Kraainem by following the Jozef van Hovestraat up the hill, around a 5-min walk. Free. 
50.859914.476597 Jewish cemetery (Joods kerkhof), Kerkhoflaan. Before 1930, the area of the current cemetery existed as garden for the castle park of Edward De Burbure of Wezembeek. With the rapid expansion of Kraainem in the first half of the 20th century, the cemetery around the Saint Pancras Church lacked the necessary capacity, and the need for a larger cemetery became evident. The area was purchased by the Kraainem municipality in 1933, and it was turned into a cemetery the next year with the construction of 2 service buildings. At the southern entrance of the cemetery, a small area is dedicated to war casualties and veterans. The larger section is reserved for the Jewish community, with was constructed in 1946 and later expanded in 1959. Many graves are victims from the Breendonk concentration camp. A memorial monument for unidentified Nazi victims is overlooking the area. The cemetery is a 15-min walk away from High Kraainem. Free. 
The Peace Monument, in memoriam of Kraainem's World War victims.
50.860434.466348 Peace Square (Vredesmonument), Vredesplein. Memorial site for the local casualties of the two world wars. The square and its monument were constructed in 1930 when the adjacent Queen Astrid Avenue was conceived as the connection between High Kraainem and Stokkel. Before 1930, there were no buildings or roads at the current location. The monument is signed by Victor Demanet who led its construction. Later, inscriptions in memorial of the Second World War were added along with the text gij hebt den dank verdiend van 't vaderland (you have deserved the gratitude of the fatherland). The monument was inaugurated by King Albert I. Free. 
Industrial heritage[edit]
18th century farmstead in the Jozef van Hovestraat no. 90, dated 1749.
Farmhouse from 1727 in Low Kraainem.
50.864524.45419 Low Kraainem (Laag-Kraainem), Jozef van Hovestraat, Molenstraat, Jef. Thumasstraat. Low Kraainem is in the valley of the Woluwe river, a side river from the Senne, and found its origin at the point where the Kleine Maalbeek (consisting of the Wezembeek and the Sterrebeek) merge into the Woluwe. The historic trajectories of the Woluwe and the Kleine Maalbeek were characterised by many ponds and marshes, but these have gradually disappeared in the 19th and 20th century. The residential centre of Low Kraainem primarily consisted of the Jozef Van Hovestraat (previously Kerreweg, Steenstraete and Crainhemstraete, but in 1914 renamed after Jozef Van Hove who was major of Kraainem), Molenstraat and Jef. Thumasstraat. With the construction of the E40 viaduct and Woluwe Avenue, much of the historic centre have been destroyed, and the Jozef Van Hovestraat was cut in two halves. Many historic buildings have been preserved however: an 18th-century traditional farmstead at nr. 90-92 and a farmhouse from 1739 at nr. 86. Both are evidence of early residential development in the area, encouraged by the tram line that existed at the time (Statieplaats means station square in Dutch). Other historic architecture can be found at nr. 1, 5, 7B, 20, 15-21, 37, 78-82 and 115. Free. 
Old Lease house in Low Kraainem.
50.865134.4545610 Old Lease house (Oud Pachthof), Jef. Thumasstraat 16. Situated along the route of the tram line that used to connect Low Kraainem with High Kraainem and Sterrebeek, the Lease house is assumed to have served as the central registrar of agricultural properties in Low Kraainem and High Kraainem. The function dates back from before the 19th century, when almost all farmland was property of large land owners, and farmers could only lease the land in exchange for a portion of the crops it yielded. The building dates from late 17th century, but it has been renovated multiple times. Kraainem's council meetings presumably took place at this location until the current town hall was constructed in 1867-1868. A lounge bar is housed in the building. (updated Jun 2017)
Industrial Heritage Monument.
50.852394.4643511 Industrial Heritage Monument (Evenwicht), Koningin Astridlaan 183. 24/7. The monument consists of three giant splinters, one wooden and two aluminum, commemorating the rich industrial legacy of Kraainem in the 19th and 20th century. Paper mills in particular have been historically important for employment in Low Kraainem, which was ideally located because of the water supply from the Woluwe and Kleine Maalbeek, and the supply of wood from the nearby Sonian Forest. From the extensive industrial complexes with paper mills, grain mills and brewery, nothing remains today. The monument was designed by Rainer Gross and inaugurated in 2000. Easily reachable from either High and Low Kraainem with a 15-  20-min walk up the hill towards Stokkel. Alternatively, take bus 352 and get off at Koningin Astrid. Free. (updated Sep 2017)
Interbellum era social housing in the Korenbloemstraat, meant for World War I veterans.
50.848814.4681412 Bouvier-Washer Cité (Bouvier-Washerwijk), Bouvier-Washerstraat 13. 24/7. The Cité, built between 1920 and 1923, was envisioned as a social residential complex for veterans from the First World War who returned from the front line with disabilities. The chlorine gas used as chemical weapon in the early stages of the war in particular turned out to be rarely deadly because it was dispersed in the air, but caused irreversible damage to the lungs of many unprepared soldiers. For the first time in history, large numbers of veterans thus returned home with permanent breathing problems, a disability preventing reintegration in the labour market. At the end of the First World War in 1918, Belgian social security was unprepared to cope with this new phenomenon, and the Association sans but lucratif au profit des mutiléls de guerre (Association for the benevolence of war mutilated individuals) was founded to construct cheap social housing for the victims. Many such social cités were constructed in Kraainem, the Bouvier-Washer Cité was among the first. The architecture is typically regional: red brick facades alternating with brightly painted surfaces, abutments to the corners of walls, anchors and plaits, etc. The neighbouring Korenbloemstraat served the same purpose but was added 10 years later between 1930 and 1932. Many buildings have been modified, but the authentic looks were preserved in Korenbloemstraat no. 28. The Cité is still used as a residential area today, as houses were sold or passed on to heirs after the original veteran inhabitants died. A 20- to 25-min walk from High Kraainem, follow Koningin Astridlaan direction Stokkel until the crossing with the Wezembeeklaan, then take left. Alternatively, take bus 352 direction Kraainem Metro and get off at stop Koningin Astrid. Free. (updated Sep 2017)
Parks and nature[edit]
The Jourdain park in High Kraainem.
50.863334.4704513 Jourdain Park (Jourdainpark). 24/7. The area east of the High Kraainem residential complex, at the time along the curvy road that connected Kraainem with Wezembeek, was purchased in 1883 by doctor Delphin Gaillard. The park only came to existence in 1899 when successive owner Victor Jourdain, who gave his name to the park, added 8.5 ha of marsh and woodland to the area before the start of the First World War in 1914. After his death in 1918, his heirs added the large ponds along the Kleine Maalbeek to the park, an addition of 4 ha. This included a watermill, which used the largest of the two ponds as a reservoir. The park consisted of the current ponds, but also a vegetable garden and orchard. A large portion of the park was sacrificed for the construction of highway R0 in 1973. From then on, the park was governed by the Kraainem municipality. As of today, the park hosts a large variety of rare and exotic plants and trees, including Platanus x hispanica, Tilia platyphyllos, T. tomentosa, Aesculus hippocastanum, and Sequoiadendron giganteum. Free. (updated Jul 2017)
Eclair park near Low Kraainem.
50.864514.4567214 Eclair Park (Eclairpark), Oudstrijderslaan 87. 24/7. A small park in Low Kraainem, the counterpart of the Jourdain park in High Kraainem. Willow trees are the symbol of Kraainem, and the willow tree of the Eclair park is one of the last remaining, after the iconic willow tree in front of the Saint Pancras Church was chopped during the renovation of the church in 2011. The pond is fed by a small spring, which used to be a source of fresh water for the inhabitants of Low Kraainem, but due to ground water contamination, the spring water is no longer suitable for human consumption. The pond drains into the Kleine Maalbeek, which in turns merges into the Woluwe 200 m further. The pond is a rich biome, as evidenced by the countless water plants in and around it. The pond also functions as flood water storage. A small recreation area makes the park a popular destination for families with young kids in Low Kraainem. Free.  (updated Jul 2018)
50.84484.465915 Old Tram Track (Oud tramspoortje). 24/7 (but lighting off after 23:00). Trajectory of a historic tram track connecting the royal palace in Laken with the king's summer residence in Tervuren (now it's the Africa museum). Only a fraction of the historic track is in use, the remainder converted into a long stretched park reaching from Kraainem to Oudergem. Used by students of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel as bicycle highway to reach the Etterbeek campus. Beautiful trajectory, crossing the border between Flanders and Brussels. Approximate length is 8 km. To return by metro, take line 5 in Oudergem towards Erasmus/Erasme and change for line 1 towards Stokkel/Stockel at Merode. Not recommendable in rainy weather. Free. (updated Jul 2017)
50.81844.478316 Sonian Forest (Zoniënwoud). 24/7. The Sonian Forest, covering an area of ca. 4400 ha, is the largest and best preserved remnant of the historical Silva Carbonaria, commonly known as the charcoal forest, that in the 4th century still stretched from Thuin to Brussels. It has a large geomorphological value because significant sections on the Loess plateau had never been felled in history, thus retaining the characteristics of a primeval forest. The highest point reaches 133 m above sea level. The source of the IJse is in the centre of the Sonian Forest, and its trajectory spawned countless ponds, creeks and marshes. Archaeological evidence of human activity in the Sonian Forest has been traced back to neolithic remains over 5000 years old. Remains of iron ore smelters from the Carolingian era have also been found. It is presumably under the reign of Charles the Great (768-814) that the Sonian Forest got split off from the Silva Carbonaria and developed an independent fauna and flora. Under Austrian reign in the 18th century, thousands of beech trees were planted, which is still visible today. From the 18th century onwards, the forest saw increasing economic importance: several monasteries and priories were built in and around it, and the countless ponds served to provide them with a supply of fish whereas the forest itself had a hunting ground function. Nearly nothing of these buildings remains today, but the intense network of droveways reveals their historic locations and importance. Under French rule, from 1794 to 1814, the Sonian Forest was nationalised, and large areas were felled for economic reasons. After the Belgian independence of 1830, parts of the forest were sold off to individuals to fill the new country's treasury, but in 1843 it became property of the state. The first half of the 19th century brought new disaster to the forest, however, when in 1832 the General Society (Société Generale) started the construction of roads that cut the forest in smaller pieces. A railway connection between Brussels and Terhulpen was constructed in 1854, further dividing the forest. After the Second World War, the roads were significantly widened and paved, then later upgraded to the highways that still exist today, and are part of the Brussels Ringway R0. The lack of tunnels or bridges make them a significant barrier for the fauna in the forest: foxes, boars, frogs, toads, deer, and budgerigars. Although only a tiny fraction of the Sonian forest is in Kraainem, the forest has become very popular with locals for recreation purposes. The Sonian Forest is a  UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forest offers excellent opportunities for hiking, Nordic walking, jogging and cycling. Fishing or camping are not allowed, however. The forest can be reached from the Kraainem centre with bus 316 direction Leuven (get off at Middenlaan) or explored by Villo bike (see Get around). Free.   (updated Jul 2018)

Adjacent to the famous Bouvier-Washer Cité, it offers visitors benches to rest and a calm environment to enjoy the surroundings.

In the early morning or late evening, encounters with wildlife are likely, and visitors can enjoy observing rabbits, weasels and even foxes in the wild. It is formally prohibited to feed wildlife, and visitors should refrain from taking out food around animals, foxes in particular. Free. (updated Jun 2017)

Buy[edit]
Currency[edit]
To obtain cash, there are 3 methods:

Exchange another currency against euros at the Zaventem airport upon arrival;
Withdraw cash from an ATM (beware, additional fees may apply);
Request additional cash from the cashier at Carrefour when paying electronically.
ATMs can typically be found at banks, and are available to tourists without any surcharge. However, exchanging another currency for euros will often either require an account at that bank, or the exchange rate will be particularly unfavourable for you.

(updated Jun 2017)
Drink[edit]
Bars in Kraainem still play a prominent social role in society, although their importance is declining. All bars serve a variety of warm and cold, alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Some may not have a traditional menu with a listing of all the available drinks at every table, in which case you simply ask the waiter or waitress what you'd like. He/she will be happy to recommend you alternatives if your preference isn't available. There are no age restrictions for entering a bar, but minors won't be allowed to order alcoholic drinks or beverages with high caffeine content.
Although tap water is safe to drink, few restaurants or bars will serve it. When ordering still water, you'll be served more expensive bottled water (Spa, Bru, Chaudfontaine, ...) instead.
The popularity of ice tea as a soft drink is in Kraainem on par with Coca Cola, and widely available. When ordering ice tea, most restaurants and bars will serve you Lipton Ice Tea Lemon, a favourite among Belgians, which is sparkling unlike its variants in neighbouring countries (i.e. Germany). If you prefer non sparkling ice tea, order Nestea instead. The latter may not be universally available, however.
By far the most popular drink served in bars is beer, one of Belgium's national prides. Many types and brands are available, each having different flavors and alcoholic content. Some types may not be available around the year, particularly those based on fruits, or those meant for special occasions (i.e. Christmas beers with cinnamon). The most common beers are Stella, Jupiler and Maes, and bars will serve at least one of those. When ordering a pint or pintje (pronounced with the i of finish), you'll be served the common beer they have on hand. Since no tap water is served in bars, a pintje (33 cl) is often cheaper than still water (50 cl). There are around 130 officially recognised breweries in Belgium, producing over 1000 beer types. In addition, many locals brew their own beer as a hobby, with carefully developed recipes, and often better taste than commercial beers. Do not attempt to order industrially produced beers like Heineken or Budweiser in Belgian bars, these beers are regarded as inferior and you'll insult the waiter or waitress by doing so. While Belgian beers are widely regarded as the best in the world, they are also the strongest in alcoholic content, some reaching 10 - 13% vol. This may be an inconvenient surprise to those not expecting such a high concentration.
The traditional beer of Kraainem, Brussels and the Pajottenland is the lambic. These beers differ from other beers because they are fermented by wild yeasts and bacteria native to the Senne valley instead of cultivated brewer's yeast. This gives lambic beers their more accentuated flavour, often with a sour aftertaste. A popular variant is the kriek lambic, a type of fruit beer (fruitbier) which is made by fermenting lambic with sour Morello cherries native to the nearby municipality of Schaarbeek. The cherries are added in whole (including pits) and left to ripe for several months, their sugars are fermented completely, thus resulting in an unsweetened but fruit flavored beer. Some breweries add sugar after the fermentation process to obtain a less intense, mild flavour, targeting female customers. Variants with raspberries instead of cherries (frambozenlambiek) are also available. A special variant of the lambic is the geuze, which is produced by blending young (1 year old) and older (2 - 3 years old) lambic. The fermentable sugars present in the young lambic cause a second fermentation cycle in the bottle, resulting in a higher carbon dioxide content. Unlike other lambics, geuze bottles are therefore highly pressurised and should be handled with care. They will therefore not be allowed on airplanes, even checked in.

50.861964.46391 De Lijsterbes, Lijsterbessenbomenlaan 4, ☏ +32 2 725 20 41.

50.862294.464322 De Ronne Hoeck, Oudstrijderslaan 3, ☏ +32 479 96 54 76. A traditional Flemish bar (café or kroeg), one of the last remaining in Kraainem. Bars like De Ronne Hoeck (Flemish dialect for the round corner, referring to its location) used to play an important role in Flemish social life until the early 2000s, because they served as meeting points for locals of all social classes and ranks. For many commoners it used to be a daily routine to pass through the local bar on their way home from work, to discuss politics, sports and assorted topics while beers helped to forget the burdens of work. Traditional bars like De Ronne Hoeck are characterised by the lack of proper illumination and dark coloured wooden furniture, leading to the name bruine kroeg (literally brown bar). From the 21st century the popularity of traditional bars declined sharply under pressure of the expensive euro, the ban on indoor smoking, and competition with more trendy lounge bars. Not the most inviting to tourists, but an interesting place for those looking to experience Flemish social history. (updated Aug 2016)

Sleep[edit]
Finding cheap lodging in Kraainem may be difficult in the touristic summer season. A convenient alternative is to find accommodations in Brussels and visit Kraainem by Metro (see "Get In") for a day. If you opt to stay in Kraainem, it is recommended to search for lodging offered by locals (B&Bs, guest houses, apartments etc.) to avoid high hotel prices.

Connect[edit]
Telephone boxes have been phased out, and Kraainem's last telephone box on the Wezembeeklaan was torn down in 2015. In case of emergency, local inhabitants or businesses will happily lend you their land line if necessary if you urgently need to make a call.
Kraainem also has complete 3G coverage, so with a European SIM card it is possible to connect to 3G Internet. Roaming may be expensive if your operator is not based in a European Union country (see also European Union article). Alternatively, a SIM card may be purchased from the local operator Mobile Vikings, which offers 2 GB data volume for €12 and accepts payment by PayPal, Bitcoin, and many mainstream payment options.

Stay safe[edit]
Kraainem is usually safe, both during the day and at night. The dangerous Belgian traffic probably poses the most significant risk to visitors, so take care when crossing streets. Jaywalking is not a criminal offence in Belgium, but that does not mean drivers will slow down either, unless you're crossing on a marked pedestrian crossing. Beware of pickpockets in shopping areas and on public transport. Groups of youth are known to hang around the Kraainem metro station in the evening and harass travellers, so it is advised to avoid the immediate area around the station at night or travel in groups.

Stay healthy[edit]
There are few health hazards to worry about in Kraainem. Tap water in Kraainem, and most of the rest of Flanders, is drinkable, and as healthy as bottled mineral water. Fountains and wells on the other hand are not suitable for human consumption. In summer, ticks are routinely encountered in the region, and are known to carry Lyme disease, which can be deadly if left untreated. If you spot pink or red circles on your skin after a walk in the forests or parks, you may be infected, and should seek medical help immediately.
