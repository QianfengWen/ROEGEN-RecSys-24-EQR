History[edit]
The town began as a hamlet for the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) lines that were built in the area in 1883. The CPR named the town after one of its benefactors: Claude Bowes-Lyon, the Earl of Strathmore. The Earl's granddaughter, Queen Elizabeth – as consort to King George VI – later passed through the community on the "Royal Train" in late May 1939.
A track-laying record was made between Strathmore and Cheadle when the railway was built. In one hour, one mile (1.6 km) of steel was laid and – at the end of the ten-hour working day – the rails were laid to Cheadle, 9 miles (14 km) for a record. Efforts by the Canadian government to develop western Canada led to increases in Strathmore's population and its importance as a rail supply stop. In 1905 the CPR moved the Hamlet of Strathmore 4 miles (6.4 km) north to its current location. The CPR railway tracks are now gone, and the land has been subdivided.
