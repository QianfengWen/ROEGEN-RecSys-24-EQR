Abigail and John Quincy Adams
Quincy is in Massachusetts. Quincy was the birthplace of presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams. United States Declaration of Independence signer and first Massachusetts governor John Hancock was also born here. Quincy produced the first commercial railroad in the country in order to transport the granite from its quarries to Boston for use in many buildings there. Quincy's shipbuilding history started with sailing ships in the 1800s and continued with battleships at the Fore River Shipyard. Howard Johnson's and Dunkin Donuts restaurants were also started here.
