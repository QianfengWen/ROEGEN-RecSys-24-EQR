Porta de Sant Miquel
Morella is a town of 2,400 people (2018) in Castellón. Tourism is a primary source of income, and the town has been actively taking steps to enable its eventual nomination for listing as a UNESCO world heritage site.


Understand[edit]
Morella (from Arabic: Maurela) has been inhabited since the earliest of times, as attested by nearby cave paintings and Bronze Age graves. The fortified hilltop which dominates the town has been controlled by many different groups through the ages, including the Iberians, Greeks, Romans, Moors, and finally Christians. Morella was the scene of fierce fighting during the Spanish War of Succession, the Napoleonic Wars, the Carlist Wars, and in the 1930s, the Spanish Civil War. In 1938 Franco's forces seized the town, but Republican guerillas remained active in the nearby mountains until 1956.
During Franco's dictatorship (1939-1975), the population declined dramatically as residents sought employment in the cities, but after the return of democracy it began to rebound.
