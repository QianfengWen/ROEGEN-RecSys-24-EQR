Bombala
Bombala is a pretty and historic town in the Snowy Mountains region of New South Wales.  If planning a trip between Sydney and Melbourne, the route through Bombala gives an interesting mix of coastal and mountain scenery, in addition to allowing for a visit to Australia's capital city.  This may be a pleasant touring alternative to the all-freeway Hume Highway, or the coastal Princes Highway. 


Get in[edit]
The Monaro Highway passes straight through Bombala, connecting from Canberra and Cooma in the north, to the Princes Hwy in the south across the Victorian border.
NSW Trainlink has coach connections to Bombala from Canberra (from Kingston) via Cooma three times a week, which costs roughly $26 per adult. The V/Line Capital connection, which connects with the train from Melbourne at Bairnsdale and continues to Canberra runs through Bombala three times week.

Get around[edit]

See[edit]
The town of Bombala was settled in the 1840s, and was one of the major towns of the region. It was the terminus for the railway line from Sydney, which has now been progressively closed all the way back to Canberra. You can still see many historic buildings in the town. The railway station and lines are still there, and you can walk on the platform.

The small down of Delegate is 30 minutes drive away.  You can continue on the road south from there, for a 100km winding and scenic trip to join the Princes Highway.  Great trip for those who love driving corners.  Not so great for travelling with those with a propensity for car sickness.
SE Forest National Park holds one of the area's last patches of pristine wet fern rainforests – it does require some travel on gravel roads, though.
