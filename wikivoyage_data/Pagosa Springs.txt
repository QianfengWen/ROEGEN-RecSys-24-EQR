Pagosa Springs is a town of 2,100 people (2019) in Southwestern Colorado along the San Juan River. It is most famous for its natural hot springs. There are also many opportunities for recreational activities nearby, such as the Wolf Creek Ski Area.


Get in[edit]

The nearest commercial airport to Pagosa Springs is the Durango/La Plata County Airport near Durango, which offers commuter air service to the major airports at Dallas Denver, Las Vegas, Phoenix and Salt Lake City.
Durango is about 60 miles west of Pagosa Springs on US Highway 160. From the east, US-160 connects Pagosa Springs to Alamosa via the Wolf Creek Pass. The scenery is spectacular, but take care as the road receives heavy snowfall and is often closed during the winter. To the south, US-84 crosses over the state line to Chama, New Mexico and beyond that Santa Fe.

Get around[edit]
The central part of Pagosa Springs, where the hot springs are, is small and easily walkable. However the outer parts of town are growing quickly, especially the western part where there's plenty of new residences and big box stores. For those areas, a car is needed, but locals are friendly to hitchhikers going uptown and downtown. The Mountain Express Bus [dead link] travels all over town.
