Zagora, Pouri, Chorefto, Agii Saranta, Makrirrachi, Ovrios are in Northeast Pelion. Since these villages are close to each other, they are considered as a single travel destination.
Zagora, Chorefto and their surrounding villages and beaches are a year-round destination. As tourism is not the lifeblood of these mainly agricultural settlements, visits at any time of year can be rewarding. Zagora and Pouri provide fine food and accommodation even in the winter months, with an increased sense of coziness.  In summer, the beaches spring to life with a rewarding but populist spirit, far away from the glitter of Mykonos. Festivals that last until early morning are common in July and August.


Understand[edit]
Zagora, one of the main villages of Pelion, developed around a monastery that was founded in 1160 (but was destroyed by fire in 1887). Zagora's growth benefitted from privileges granted by the Ottoman authorities. In the 1700s and 1800s, through its port of Chorefto, Zagora's merchants became prosperous from trading local silk and woolen fabrics and developed extensive links throughout Europe and the Middle East. Zagora's famous Hellenic schools were established with the fruits of local traders' prosperity and global experience. These schools educated some of the leading individuals of the 18th-century Greek Enlightenment, which foreshadowed the 1821 Greek Revolution. The visitor can see the prosperity of that era in the stately archontika (mansions) of Zagora and the surrounding villages and their churches, some lavishly decorated, that were built typical Pelionic style.
The economic life of these villages today is dominated the Agricultural Cooperative of Zagora-Pilio, one of the oldest agricultural cooperatives in Greece. The cooperative places on its fruit a trademarked "Zagorin" sticker, which has become an EU Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) for apples. The farmers in the region are also major producers (and exporters) of kiwi fruit.

Tourist information[edit]

39.4446623.103151 Public Historic Library of Zagora, Zagora (on the main road through Zagora, just below the Agios Giorgios plateia follow a ramp with a sign marked "ΠΡΟΣ ΒΙΒΛΙΟΘΙΚΗ" up to the library), ☏ +30 24260 22591, mail@vivl-zagor.mag.sch.gr. M Tu Th F 09:00-13:30, W 09:00-17:00. The Public Historic Library of Zagora was an important resource for the education of some of the leading figures of the 18th-century Greek Enlightenment that preceded Greece's 1821 Revolution. The library was founded in 1762 and is known for its collection of about 3,500 old and rare books. The library's contemporary collection that serves today's community contains over 10,000 books and magazines. Key early contributors to the library were John Prigos (1725 - 1789), a merchant who travelled through Europe and the library's founder, and the Patriarch of Constantinople Callinicus IV. There are often small, interesting exhibits (although signage tends to be in Greek only). Free. (updated May 2021)

Beaches[edit]
Agii Saranta beachSwim at one of the major beaches of the area (from north to south): Parisena, Chorefto and Agii Saranta.
39.461623.11591 Parisaina Beach, Chorefto (on the main beach road in Chorefto, head north from the intersection from Zagora; park before the road begins a sharp ascent on the left; you will see a path around a headland that will take you to the beach). Wide and devoid of any permanent development and (before late afternoon) shade, but often full of campers, Parisaina beach attracts many naturists. In summer a primitive, communal atmosphere takes hold. Silence, distance and appreciation of nature in these crystalline waters. (updated Apr 2021)
39.452223.1232 Chorefto Beach, Chorefto (at the end of a winding, sometimes narrow 8-km road from Zagora). Stretching for 1,650 m, from a rocky outcrop in the north to the jetty for Chorefto's small port, Chorefto Beach is one of the longest on the Aegean side of Pilion. There are plenty of hotels and rooms to let, along with camping, along the main beach road, and plenty of places to park. The middle third of the beach is the most developed, with tavernas and stores along the street, as well as serviced loungers and umbrellas on the sand (available for a small fee). For much of the beach, there are simple showers and changing cabins for public use. The sandiest parts of the beach are the northern two-thirds, with the southern third having larger, but smooth-worn, rocks both on the beach and on entry to the water. Chorefto's clear waters can vary from completely flat to very rough, even during the summer. In summer, there is a lifeguard station at about the mid-point of the beach, with a (green, orange and red) flag that alerts as to safety conditions. (updated Apr 2021)
39.4425423.135073 Agii Saranta Beach (from Chorefto, follow the beach road south, around the camping and up the steep incline, a signed road 250 m after the road levels leads to Agii Saranta; from Makryrrachi, between a church and small supermarket, take the signed road from the main road; this road is rough in part, but you will find the road leading down to Agii Saranta in 2.6 km). One of the most beautiful beaches in Pilio. Clear waters and fine sand surrounded by a lush forest that forms a gorgeous amphitheater. There are some pleasant tavernas and bars, serviced umbrellas and even some rooms to let. On weekends in the summer, crowds from Volos ensure parking near the beach is full (often before noon); consequently, access can be problematic, as for a portion of the descent only one car can progress in either direction around a blind hairpin turn. This will often lead to a queue of cars needing to reverse up or down a steep incline. Best solution is to park at some of the wider lay-bys on the descent and walk down. (updated Apr 2021)
There are agencies, mainly based at Chorefto, that rent kayaks, canoes and paddle boards, accompanied and non-accompanied, including Pelion Secrets[dead link], Chorefto Kayak & Sup Rental[dead link] and Pelion Scout. Pelion Scout will also arrange canyoning, cycling and hiking trips. The Athletic Club of Zagora (the Centaurs) will organize beach volleyball and beach football tournaments on Chorefto beach throughout the summer; these are publicized on posters throughout the region as well as on their facebook page.
Less developed beaches should also be considered:

39.4694523.111464 Analipsi Beach (from Pouri, follow signs down a very steep road to Analipsi Beach; park at the road's end and walk along the stony beach; the boulders become just large pebbles as you move further south). But for the shower in front of the Plimari Taverna, Analipsi is visibly undeveloped. You can walk to more secluded, and sandier, coves (including Tourkopigi Beach) if you are athletic enough to scramble over the large rocks at the south end of the beach. You can certainly get away from the crowds here. (updated Apr 2021)

Stay safe[edit]
The Public Health Center of Zagora (☏ +30 24260 22222) serves the East Pilion region and handles most basic medical emergencies. Advanced treatment is arranged by ambulance transfer to the General Hospital of Volos.
At certain times, the open waters of the generally unprotected beaches of East Pilion can have strong waves and currents. Do not swim too far out from shore, and try to swim with a companion.  Some beaches, such as Chorefto and Agii Saranta will, at certain times of the year and at limited times during the day, have lifeguards. The jetty protecting the small port at Chorefto offers calmer waters for swimming when more open waters are too rough.
Drive cautiously and considerately. The roads in this area are often narrow and have a surprising number of hairpin turns and blind corners. Farmers of apples, kiwi and olives will often park their pickups partly in the road at inconvenient spots, especially from late August to early October. Pedestrians, including school children and the elderly, are frequently on the road at all times of year. Cyclists are becoming more common. The KTEL coaches and the double-trailered lorries from the Zagorin cooperative also operate on these narrow roads.
Connect[edit]
Most of the bars, restaurants, taverns and cafes offer free wi-fi for their guests.
