Chaozhou (潮州; Diê5ziu1 in Teochew, Cháo​zhōu in Mandarin) is a city in Guangdong Province in China, and the main cultural center of the Chaoshan region.


Understand[edit]
Chaozhou is in the easternmost part of Guangdong Province in the north of the delta of the Han River, which flows through the city. It borders Shantou to the south, Jieyang to the southwest, Meizhou to the northwest, the province of Fujian to the east, and the South China Sea to the southeast.
Administratively, Chaozhou is divided into two districts and one county. Xiangqiao (湘桥) district forms the downtown core of the city, with
Chao'an (潮安) district to the west, and Raoping (饶平) county to the east.
Many overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia can trace their ancestry to the area, with Bangkok, Phnom Penh, Pontianak and Johor Bahru being prominent examples of cities where Teochews form the majority among the ethnic Chinese community. In addition, Teochews also form one of the largest non-Cantonese communities in Hong Kong, and play a prominent role in the city's economy.

Talk[edit]
Teochew is the main local language, which is closely related to Minnan, and mutually intelligible to some extent. Locals are very proud of their language despite government attempts to standardise Mandarin as a common language, so any attempts to speak Teochew will be met with encouragement, and may even get you preferential treatment in shops and restaurants. As the main cultural center of the region, the Chaozhou dialect is regarded as the prestige dialect of Teochew, thus making it a good place for those interested in learning the language.
As Chaozhou is part of Guangdong province, many people speak Cantonese as a second language. As with elsewhere in mainland China, standard Mandarin is the only language taught in schools so expect all educated people to be fluent in Mandarin. English is not widely spoken, though staff at the higher end hotels will be able to speak English.
Despite many residents having relatives in the much more international city of Hong Kong and in overseas Chinese communities, non-Chinese visitors are not common here so expect some friendly curiosity and attempts at conversation from people if you visit, especially from kids and teenagers who know a little bit of English. The city is developing with China's economic expansion, so visitors and facets of Western culture, while still infrequent, are becoming more common.
