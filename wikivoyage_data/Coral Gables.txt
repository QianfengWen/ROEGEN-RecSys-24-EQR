Coral Gables is a city in Greater Miami, in Florida.
Just south of downtown Miami is beautiful Coral Gables, or simply "The Gables" as it is known to natives. The city is perhaps best known as the home of the University of Miami, one of the nation's leading private universities.


Understand[edit]

The University of Miami is well known for its top academic programs in business, marine science, medicine, music and other fields.  It also is well known for its premiere athletic programs.  With five national championships since the early 1980s, the University of Miami football team has won more national championships than any other Division I football program.  Its baseball team also is a national powerhouse and has won the College World Series numerous times.
This planned section of town is an oasis of quiet stately homes, shopping and Miami restaurants in the heart of Miami. If you're tired of South Beach and the downtown scene and are looking for some classy fun, take a trip to the Gables.
The city is home to many historic landmarks as well as 22 parks, 33 public tennis courts, two public golf courses, and other first-class recreation amenities. Among them: the largest tropical botanical garden in the continental United States, a spring-fed grotto swimming pool made of native coral rock with underwater caves, tree-lined bike paths and walking trails, and more.
In the past three decades, the city has experienced healthy growth, which has bolstered the economic base. Today, Coral Gables is home to 175 multinationals, 26 consulates and trade offices and more than 30 fine art galleries. It is also known as the Fine Dining Capital of South Florida and has the highest concentration of live theater in Miami-Dade County. Growth in the commercial sector has brought a wealth of new activities for residents, including nighttime entertainment, live music, casual and fine dining, and new retail options. It has also helped maintain low property taxes. At the same time, the residential areas have remained protected from commercial intrusion.
The city supports both the residential and business sectors with excellent city services, having attained the highest possible standards in every field. In fact, Coral Gables is the only city in the state of Florida and one of only two cities nationwide to have a Class 1 Fire Department, a fully-accredited Police Department, and the highest awarded Building and Zoning Department rating. In addition, Coral Gables has been named a "Tree City USA" for 14 consecutive years, it has an award-winning Communications Division and offers one of the most comprehensive Parks and Recreation programs in the state.
Coral Gables is well-known for its outstanding restaurants. With more than 40 great places to eat, all within walking distance in the downtown area, the hardest decision will be which one to try first. There are places to meet for a casual outdoor lunch as well as elegant, top-rated restaurants for fine dining.
