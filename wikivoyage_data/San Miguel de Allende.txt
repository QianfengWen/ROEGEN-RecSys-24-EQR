San Miguel de Allende is a colonial city in the state of Guanajuato in the Bajio mountains of central Mexico, about 270 km (170 mi) northwest of Mexico City. In 2020, the town had 72,000 residents, in a metropolitan area of 160,000.
It's a tourist destination, an art colony, and a retirement community for 20,000-25,000 foreigners – mostly Americans, Canadians, and Europeans. In spite of the increased number of foreigners over the past decades, it still is charming enough that many Mexicans visit for special holidays, and there are more than a few visitors who buy a house within a few days of their first arrival.


Understand[edit]

San Miguel is, first and foremost, a city built for relaxing. It is a Spanish colonial town of 72,000 people (2020). The urban area has 160,000 people.  It is a heritage site protected by the Mexican government in order to maintain its character. In 2008 it was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
Founded as "San Miguel el Grande" in 1542 by the Franciscan monk Juan de San Miguel, it became a centerpiece in the war for Mexican independence from Spain. After the war, in 1826, San Miguel was given city status and renamed San Miguel de Allende after Ignacio Allende, a hero of the independence movement, the "first Mexican soldier" and a native of the city. In danger of becoming a ghost town in the early 20th century, the town was declared a national monument in 1926 and building became heavily restricted in the town's historic centro district, allowing the city to keep the colorful native facades that have become the backdrop of many famous works of art and even modern motion pictures.
A series of artist colonies were founded in San Miguel in the 1950s, including the famous Instituto Allende, and many American ex-soldiers moved their families here following World War II either to attend one of these colonies or to escape the polio scares raging through many U.S. cities. The result was a healthy American expatriate population that exists today mostly as elderly retirees and second-generation business owners. This population, combined with wealthy Mexicans (especially actors and politicians) that have rediscovered San Miguel as a Malibu-like retreat from Mexico City, has created an eclectic mix of Old World Mexican charm, American hospitality, and a party atmosphere that makes San Miguel a world-class destination for adventurous travelers.

San Miguel's weather is typical of central mountainous Mexico. It varies little, and even in the hottest months (May and June) when daytime temperatures can reach 35°C, the dry air makes it tolerable and cool mountain breezes tend to make evenings delightful. Winter evenings (from December to February) can get cold, even down to freezing overnight, but it warms up quickly in the morning. The rainy season extends from June to September when days are pleasant for sightseeing until heavy downpours (usually late in the afternoon and evening) cool and freshen the air. The climate has the same lazy, quiet air and temperance as Palm Springs, encouraging long hours of swimming and pool-side tanning, reading or napping, or just lying in a hammock and forgetting the world exists.

Tourist information[edit]
20.91454-100.743841 San Miguel Tourist Information (Consejo Turistico de San Miguel de Allende), Plaza Principal 8, ☏ +52 415 152 1695. M-Sa 08:30-20:00, Su 10:00-17:30. Offers street maps and can arrange for Spanish or English tours of the city. 
Watch[edit]
The movies Once Upon a Time in Mexico and And Starring Pancho Villa as Himself were filmed almost entirely in San Miguel.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
From the León (BJX) and Querétaro (QRO) airport[edit]
The closest airports to San Miguel are the Aeropuerto Bajío/León (BJX IATA), about 95 km (55 miles) west of San Miguel de Allende and Aeropuerto Querétaro (QRO IATA), about 90 km (50 miles) southeast of San Miguel de Allende. Arriving at either of these airports will reduce your final journey to a relatively inexpensive hour shuttle or cab ride into town. Aeromexico Connect, Viva Aerobus, Volaris and Magnicharters offer flights from Cancun, Chicago, Los Angeles, Mexico City, Monterrey, Puerto Vallarta and/or Tijuana to the region in addition to United Express and American Eagle with flights from Houston Intercontinental and Dallas/Ft Worth respectively. 

Rides from the two airports[edit]
When taking a taxi from one of the two airports, make sure you use an approved taxi service (the green and white cars are official taxis). Uber and Didi drivers may be willing to try picking you up, but risk being pulled over by the police and ordered to turn around and take you right back.
Even still, if you don't know San Miguel that well, you may want to consider calling ahead to your hotel or B&B and having them provide transport. This will almost always be cheaper than taking a taxi from the airport. Regional taxis may know how to get you to San Miguel, but only a taxi or car sent by your lodging will know how to get you straight to them. The driver will meet you inside the terminal, in the area where you clear customs. You can arrange transportation through your hotel, etc., or book direct with one of the many shuttle services listed on San Miguel websites. From the Querétaro or León airports the company Bajiogo offers a shuttle for around M$500-600 (Jan 2024), and will drop you off to your exact location. This is a good deal if you're by yourself, but maybe be similar to the price of a taxi if you have two people.

By bus from the two airports[edit]
From the Querétaro airport to the Querétaro bus terminal, it's convenient to take a taxi or go by e-hailing. From there are direct intercity buses to San Miguel de Allende.
From the León airport it's not really convenient by bus. As of January 2024 there's no bus from the airport itself to San Miguel, only to León . You could catch a bus to Leon and then transfer, or try to walk farther from the airport and catch a bus along the road (see the Guanajuato article for more details).

From the Mexico City airport (MEX)[edit]
Your flight may be less expensive if you go through Mexico City  (MEX IATA).
Primera Plus offer hourly buses from Mexico City's Benito Juarez International Airport (MEX) to Queretaro and Celaya where you can transfer to another bus to San Miguel. It's a 4- to 5-hour trip. Alternatively, you could go to the northern bus terminal (Autobuses del Norte, Metro line 5). From there it's a direct 3:50h ride in an intercity bus.
Do not try to take a non-prepaid taxi from the MEX airport. The taxi drivers in Mexico City are well-trained to cheat you by charging you three or four times the cost of a trip to San Miguel. It's simply not worth the hassle. If you're hell-bent on flying into Mexico City and not taking a bus, call ahead to the hotel or B&B where you're staying and ask them to send a taxi from San Miguel. Yes, they may charge you for both the trip to and from the airport, but it will be infinitely less expensive than if you try to pick up a taxi from the street outside the Mexico City airport. It is very important not to pick up a taxi from the street outside the Mexico City airport for safety reasons, in any case. Take one of the official airport taxis to your hotel. These "Transporte Terrestre" taxis are the only ones allowed inside the airport. You will buy a zone-priced ticket ahead of time inside the airport by walking all the way down to the right (several hundred meters) after exiting the international arrivals area.

By carpooling[edit]
From cities around you can have a look for shared rides on Blablacar.

By car[edit]
Narrow streets of San Miguel de Allende.
If you're an experienced driver in Mexico, you'll have few problems reaching San Miguel. It's less than two hours from León and one hour from Querétaro, and maybe a three-hour drive from Mexico City. The only difficulty will come when you reach San Miguel. Parking spaces are at an absolute premium here, so you'll want to arrange to have a spot for your car waiting when you arrive. Additionally, the cobblestone streets were not designed for modern traffic, so driving around San Miguel can be a challenge. Most people walk or take a US $2 cab ride anywhere downtown.
If you've never driven much in Mexico, driving to San Miguel is not difficult. While San Miguel is on the side of a mountain ridge, most of the roads leading to it are in excellent condition and safe to drive, at least during the day. Since much of this area is "free range" land, horses and cattle may find their way onto the road, especially at night.
Seniors and tourists touring the region may find sightseeing more difficult because of the locals' propensity to drive fast along these two-lane highways. It's not much fun having a car on your bumper while trying to see the beautiful countryside in this area. Slower drivers often drive partly on the shoulder to let faster traffic pass.

Get around[edit]

On foot[edit]
Maybe 90% of San Miguel's attractions are within walking distance. Just keep in mind that because San Miguel was built into the side of a mountain, it can turn out to be difficult to traverse, some inclines are 15 or 20 degrees. Furthermore, the streets are cobbled and narrow – some were nothing but goat tracks before they were paved – and many have fallen into disrepair. Curbs are often a high step away from the road. All in all, the town can be unforgiving to an inexperienced walker. For this reason, it is advisable to bring comfortable shoes.

Street behind the parish church
By e-hailing[edit]
Uber and Didi cover the city.

By bus[edit]
San Miguel has its own pleasant and reliable bus system that serves the entire town, including out-of-the-way places like the Luciérnega Shopping Center. Buses are called urbanos and run from 07:00-21:00 daily for a flat rate of M$8 (Dec 2021) inside the city center (single ride, no transfer, driver gives change). 
The schedule is every 15-20 minutes in the central city; every 1-2 hours to and from outlying areas in the municipality. Routes are never referred to by their number but by the name of the destination. There is no route map. Destinations are generally marked or painted on the side or on the windshield. Centro means downtown and Central means bus station. 
Buses are white with color-coded trim. All the blue-white and orange-white buses pass the stop opposite the Oratorio de San Felipe Neri downtown.  Yellow-white buses make a circle around town passing near Centro and Central. All red-white, green-white, purple-white buses and some yellow-white buses connect to the outlying suburbs and are boarded at various stops located several blocks outside the center of town.

By taxi[edit]
Catch a taxi to any destination within central San Miguel for M$35-40 (2016), and M$40-50 after dark. In-town taxis are abundant and a great option after an afternoon of shopping. Taxis do not use meters and the price should be confirmed first. Taxis in front of the bus station are notorious for over-charging; most locals walk a few meters past them to flag down a cab on the street.  If calling for a taxi to pick you up, the price doubles.  If planning a late night out, most taxi drivers can be trusted to keep an appointment if the pickup time is arranged in advance.

By tourist trolley[edit]
Two different companies provide sightseeing rides using trolley-looking buses. You can ask for tickets in the main tourist office just in the main square. The ride lasts 1½ hours (if traffic allows) and reaches the top of the El Mirador hill for a fantastic view of the town.

By car[edit]
Driving in San Miguel can be challenging due to very narrow streets and limited parking, and is best avoided. There was a time when the city was not so wealthy and only taxis could be found on these roads. Now that the real estate market has boomed, an influx of money has made cars more affordable and now the average resident is more likely to own one – good news for the economy, but bad news for the roads.
Many two-way streets in San Miguel are too narrow to support two lanes of traffic, and it's not uncommon for a street to become so choked with cars that drivers have to get out and negotiate which one is going to back up to a wider street to let the other pass. Many streets are one-way and indicated by arrow signs placed on the sides of buildings; a double arrow indicates a two-way street.
Watch out for very steep streets. They can get even steeper than you realize and at least one in San Miguel is so narrow at the bottom that no more than a medium-sized car with its side mirrors pulled in can safely maneuver between the buildings. Scratches on the walls attest to drivers who have literally had to scrape between the buildings. Backing up the hill is usually not an option.  Following a city bus is a good way to guarantee not getting into a tight situation.
On-street parking regulations are widely ignored by Mexicans.  If you park on the street, do NOT leave it parked for more than 24 hours (There are no signs warning about this).  Parking violations may result in the transit police removing your license plates. You will then need to find the police station, pay a fine, and hope that your plates are returned. A better alternative is that there are several paid parking lots in town; look for 'E' signs indicating estacionamiento (parking).

Craft shop
Arts and crafts[edit]
The streets around the Jardín are full of specialty shops selling common souvenirs, clothing, art, furniture, and Mexican tile, and any other type of Mexican artwork that you can think of. In addition to its cultural staples, San Miguel de Allende is known for its amazing shopping. Being near the geographical center of the country, artisans from every part of Mexico have been known to send their artwork to San Miguel to be sold.
Whenever possible, buy directly from the artisan. Many amazingly talented artists are not able to support their families due to the low prices they receive for their art. At times it is very necessary to bargain and at other times inappropriate – use your intuition and allow for mistakes.
