Dufur is in the Columbia Gorge of Oregon.


Understand[edit]
Dufur, a city of 600 people, is a farming community which primarily grows wheat, tree fruit and grapes. Its founders' names are a corruption of the French name "DuFour" (of the oven).
From 1913 to 1928, Dufur was a stop on the Great Southern Railroad, a former 41-mile short line which ran south along Fifteen Mile Creek from The Dalles to Friend. It once had an electric-powered sawmill and, until 1921, large apple orchards. Little remains of the abandoned railway but the former The Dalles depot, moved to a site at the base of Brewery Grade. Friend, Oregon is now a ghost town where little remains but the Friend Store, a one-room schoolhouse, and a cemetery.
