Ride a cock-horse to Banbury Cross,
To see a fine lady upon a white horse;
Rings on her fingers and bells on her toes,
And she shall have music wherever she goes.
— Traditional British nursery rhyme


Banbury Cross and the Fine Lady
Upton House
Banbury is a market town in the Cherwell district of Oxfordshire. It is known for the nursery rhyme "Ride-a-cock-horse" (shown on the right) and Banbury cakes. The local football team is Banbury United and they play at the Spencer stadium.


Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Due to the building of the M40 motorway, Banbury is now a town with good industry. It is now one of the major commuter towns for London, Oxford, Solihull and Birmingham. The M40 also provides local residents access to the Midlands and the southeast.
Hennef Way (A422) was upgraded to a dual carriageway easing traffic on the heavily congested road and providing better links to north Banbury and the town centre from the M40.

By bus[edit]
Banbury has an inter-urban bus service provided by Stagecoach Group which feeds the outlying villages and provides transport to places such as Oxford, Chipping Norton and Brackley.

By train[edit]
