The tourism, fishing, fur, pulpwood, forestry, agricultural grains, livestock, dairy and poultry product industries all support Meadow Lake.

History[edit]
It was founded as a trading post in 1799, and became a village in 1931 and a town in 1936. In 2009, it became Saskatchewan's 14th city.
Peter Fidler built Bolsover House in 1799 near "Lac des Prairies", the first name given to Meadow Lake. In 1873 Metis families arrived establishing a Hudson's Bay Company trading post, joined by other settlers in the early 1900s. The largest impetus occurred following a fire of 1919 and the exodus of some of the settlers during the Great Depression from the Dust Bowl of central and southern Saskatchewan to communities in the north.

Climate[edit]
Meadow Lake experiences a subarctic climate that falls just short of being classified as a Humid continental climate.
