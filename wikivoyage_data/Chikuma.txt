Chikuma (千曲市 Chikuma-shi) is a city in Nagano. With a population of about 62,000, Chikuma is a small city by Japanese standards, and has urban areas mixed in among the forests, orchards and rice paddies. It's a great place to experience a different aspect of Japan than what you find in the big cities or on the regular tourist trail.


Understand[edit]
Chikuma City was formed in 2003 from the amalgamation of Koshoku City in its northern parts with the historic onsen towns of Togura and Kamiyamada in the south. This southern part of the city, known locally as Togura Kamiyamada Onsen, boasts numerous traditional ryokans (inns), ancient temples and shrines, seven public onsen bathhouses, a history of geisha entertainment that lives on today, and numerous natural features such as mountains, forest, hiking trails and picnic spots. In the west of the city, the areas known as Obasute and Yawata provide other historical and cultural attractions including the famous moon viewing rice paddies of Obasute and the Takemizuwake Shrine in Yawata. In the east of the city is the village of Mori, often called Anzu no Sato, or Apricot Village, because of the wealth of apricot trees that blossom profusely in spring.
Maximum daily temperatures average 15-20 °C in April, 25-31 °C in July, 18-21 °C in October, and 0-5 °C in January. Most years see 850 mm to 1100 mm of rain falling, with the winter months being the driest.
