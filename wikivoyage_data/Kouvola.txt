Kouvola railway station
Kouvola is a city of 80,000 people (2021) in Southern Finland, 134 km northeast of the capital, Helsinki.


Understand[edit]
The town emerged around the junction of the north-south and east–west rail tracks. It is one of Finland's most important rail hubs, and the main rail link between Finland and St. Petersburg goes through Kouvola. In 2009, the six municipalities – Kouvola, Kuusankoski, Elimäki, Anjalankoski, Valkeala and Jaala – merged, accounting for the new municipality of Kouvola as the 10th largest city in Finland.
Verla Groundwood and Board Mill, near Jaala, is a monument to the early days of the Finnish forest industry and a world heritage site since 1996.
Although Kouvola is said to be the ugliest city in Finland, there are still many sights worthy of seeing in Kouvola. Even the ugliness can be an experience.

60.49050326.452453 Kymijoki. Kymi river, flowing through many towns and districts of Kouvola (though not the city centre), is one of the widest rivers in Southern Finland. Giving the name to the entire region (Kymenlaakso translates to Kymi's Valley), it is one of the most important drainage rivers of the Finnish Lakeland (the main lakes upstream are Vesijärvi, Päijänne and Keitele). A swift river with many rapids, it has long been a major source of hydroelectricity (earlier on timber rafting too) and as a result of this much of the Finnish wood and paper industry has historically been concentrated in this region.
