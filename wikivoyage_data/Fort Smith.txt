Garrison Avenue - Fort Smith, AR

Understand[edit]
In 1817 Fort Smith was established as a military fort next to Indian territory in Oklahoma to keep the peace between the native Osage tribes and the recently relocated Cherokee groups. It is at the junction of the Arkansas river and the Poteau river at a place that early French explorers called Belle Point. The military fort was named after General Thomas A. Smith, the military's district commander. The military later relocated to nearby Fort Chaffee but the civilian settlers remained keeping the name of the fort and establishing a western frontier town that was often the last genteel layover for people from all walks of life before excursions into Indian Oklahoma including soldiers en route to the Mexican War in the Southwest.
Later Fort Smith became a popular stop for westward expansionists, gold rush diggers, and those seeking better opportunities due to the Great Depression and Dust Bowl of the 20th century.
Today as the second largest city in the state, the municipality and surrounding area is a major economic hub for the state of Arkansas with many major corporations with roots in the city still in operation and employing thousands. The downtown area and commercial zones are usually busy with voluminous traffic most days but beyond that you will find quiet residential zones and woods. Due to economic trends in the U.S. economy, some major factories and plants have closed and/or moved resulting in a swelling of the unemployed population and an uptick in local taxes.

The Hanging Judge
The Fort Smith National Historic Site contains the former courthouse of Issac Parker (1838-1896), who became known as "The Hanging Judge". Parker served 21 years on the bench, during which he sentenced 160 criminals to death by hanging, of which 79 were  hanged. Today, the phrase hanging judge has entered American law jargon as a term for a judge who frequently implements the death penalty or seeks swift and firm justice.

Respect[edit]
Being so close to a number of military installations and bases the area boasts a large number of military families.
The city is in a very GOP concentrated district as opposed to the rest of the state, though changing political trends for both parties have caught up to the area.
Church attendance is very high and religious expression often encouraged but residents are often respectful if one politely declines their invitations to services. There are also small nonreligious secular social groups nearby, notably in Fayetteville, if that's one's preference.
Being near many rural communities and woodlands one may come across, though rare, wildlife especially the nearer one is on the outskirts of the city. It is best advised to leave the wildlife be.
Local county liquor laws prohibit the sale of alcohol on Sundays.
Due to nation-wide economic changes several large scale employers have had to close or move. These events have hit the local residents very hard and as a result several have had to swallow their pride and accept public assistance.
