Leven is a town on the coast of Fife in central Scotland, with a population in 2016 of 9040. It was industrial during the 19th and 20th century, merging into the neighbouring towns of Methil and Buckhaven to create the conurbation of Levenmouth; it's struggled to re-invent itself since the coal mines closed. Leven is far from scenic but has a good beach, and to its northeast the industrial strip ends, with golf links and better scenery towards the East Neuk of Fife.
