Maryborough is a city in Central Queensland.


Understand[edit]
Located three hours from Brisbane, Maryborough was a major immigration port and a visit to the Wharf Street Precinct retains many reminders of this period.
Much of Maryborough's character has been preserved in classic Queenslander houses, mostly built of local timber in a range of sizes and designs. Gracing the city's broad tree-lined streets, these homes have given Maryborough a reputation as one of the most beautiful historic locations in Queensland.
Within minutes of the city centre are rich farmlands, gold beaches, rainforests, islands and national parks.  Beautifully restored 'Queenslanders' (the unique houses built for tropical Queensland), graceful commercial buildings and lovely old churches are three of Maryborough's great drawcards.
