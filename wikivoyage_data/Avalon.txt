By boat[edit]
Most visitors reach Avalon on the ferry from either Long Beach, San Pedro, Dana Point or Newport Beach; note that the ferry from Marina del Rey is no longer in operation. The trip takes about an hour via high-speed ferry. Perhaps the best way to reach the island is by private sailboat or powerboat, about a half-day from the Los Angeles harbors. The seas in the channel are generally calm, though there are swells; dolphins, flying fish, and other sea life are often sighted.

Go next[edit]
If you are coming from the mainland you probably want to see a bit more of Catalina Island, such as Two Harbors or the interior of the island (home of the buffalo). Unfortunately, golf carts are not allowed outside of Avalon; all roads leading away from the town hold "no golf cart" signs. So, if you are interested in visiting other parts of the island, another mode of transportation (such as bicycle, small motorscooter, or guided tour) must be found. Note that the island is hilly so you might find yourself pushing your bike up the roads in the island's interior.
