Understand[edit]
Weert is a lively old town between North-Brabant, South-Limburg and Belgium. You can shop and it regularly hosts various events. In the vicinity are beautiful nature areas where you can make lovely walking and cycling tours.

History[edit]
Weert was first mentioned in a document in 1062. In that time it belonged to the County of Horn. This county was first governed from Horn, but later Weert became the capital. From that time Weert got an urban relation with canals, ramparts and gates. In 1414 Weert received market rights. Around 1500 the city experienced its golden age. Earl Jacob Ι of Horn built a new castle, called The Neijenborg. The St. Martinus church was built and the monastery was expanded. Due to the distastrous 80 Years War, Weert declined to a country town. The castle was destroyed in 1702 during the War of Succession. The recovery came after the construction of the Zuid-Willemsvaart in 1825. These days, Weert is one of the largest cities in Limburg.
