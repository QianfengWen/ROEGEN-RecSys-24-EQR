In this procession, the possessed mortal performs magical acts, such as piercing his own cheek with some solid and sharp stick from one side to the other, without any bleeding; a sword carrier hits his own back with a very sharp sword without injuring himself; and another cuts his own tongue without injuring himself.  This procession usually attracts the attention of the whole city.
