Alfa Pendular at Coimbra-B
Coimbra has two main train stations:

Coimbra-A is a historic train station built near the riverbank close to the medieval city centre.

40.224929-8.4410422 Coimbra-B railway station (Estação Velha), Rua do Padrão - Eiras, ☏ +351 707 210 220. Coimbra-B is a through station on the Lisbon-Porto line, served by high-speed long-distance Alfa Pendular trains.

Travel time to Coimbra-B is about 1 hr from Porto and about 1 hr 45 min from Lisbon. Train times (from any location) can be found on the CP National Rail site.   (updated Dec 2020)
By car[edit]
The principal motorway serving Coimbra is the A1 (Autoestrada do Norte), with several exits that will be put you about 10 min away from the city centre. Driving from Porto takes about 1 hr, and Lisbon is about 2 hr away.
The A13 motorway (Autoestrada do Pinhal Interior) provides a link from Entroncamento and Tomar.
The A14 motorway (Autoestrada do Baixo Mondego) provides access from the coastal city of Figueira da Foz.
The IP3 road serves Chaves and Viseu.

By bus[edit]
40.2162-8.43673 Terminal Rodoviário de Coimbra (Coimbra Bus Station), Avenida Fernão de Magalhães. The bus station is easily reached by local bus or on foot (a 10-min walk from the city centre). It has destinations for the whole of Portugal (with changes for some far away destinations), and it's faster and fares are normally cheaper than the train. (updated Aug 2021)
Some buses (e.g. Flixbus) don't use the bus station, but leave from a parking lot further up the same road, underneath the flyover, opposite the Audi car showroom by the roundabout. Halfway between the bus station and Coimbra-B railway station. No ticket office. No benches. There is a bar just across the road and a 24 hour hamburger place 2 minutes away towards the town centre.

By shared shuttle[edit]
There are a few companies providing door-to-door shared shuttle service to Coimbra from either Lisbon or Porto. It is a budget option with more personal service than the bus. You can get to Coimbra from your hotel in Lisbon or Porto with shared shuttle, and get off by the square Largo da Portagem, which is the area visitors ususally start their touring. If you are coming from airports, you can go with Coimbra airport shuttle. It is recommended to book ticket in advance to guarantee a seat.

Get around[edit]
Map of Coimbra


By foot[edit]
Most of the things to see and do in Coimbra and most of the places to eat, drink, and sleep are within reasonable walking distance of each other and of the rail station in Baixa. There are several hotels, restaurants, cafés, pastry shops, and nightclubs.
Most monuments are in Baixa and Santa Clara (across the Mondego river). Smaller shops, restaurants, and hotels are mostly in Baixa and Santa Clara. Major shopping malls are in Alta, by Solum, and near the municipal stadium/pool.

By bus[edit]
The SMTUC (Serviços Municipalizados de Transportes Urbanos de Coimbra) operates several bus routes in and around Coimbra.
The "Pantufinhas" or Linha Azul (Blue Line) provides transport in the historical city centre, and a link between the lower and upper town.

By elevator[edit]
There's an elevator (Elevador do Mercado) that connects Rua Padre António Vieira with Rua Olímpio Nicolau Rui Fernandes (next to Mercado Municipal D Pedro V). A valid SMTUC ticket is necessary to gain access.

By car[edit]
Coimbra is a hard city to drive in as it was built around medieval structures. Also, finding a parking spot can be difficult. The best option for visiting Coimbra is to find a hotel with parking or to park near the city centre and then walk around. The main attractions are in the city centre and within walking distance of each other.
Coimbra Baixa is the lower city (downtown). Alta is the highest part of the city, which is also difficult to drive around.

Having a meal is not really a problem in Coimbra, since the city has a lots of restaurants, some featuring regional cuisine, in the old city (Baixa). Rua de Azeiteiras, a street in Baixa, has lots of nice traditional restaurants.

Budget[edit]
Three reasonably big shopping centres serve the standard fast food meals you can find everywhere. They are located in key places in the city, but not necessarily close to the tourist attractions of the city.

Mid-range[edit]
40.212-8.4231 Molho de Brocolos, Avenida Sa da Bandeira 33/35 (around to the right and at the back of the 2nd floor of Galerias Avenida). Organic vegan food.

Small but tasty dishes, rich in flavour mainly because they use local products, good vegetarian even vegan choice, nice selection of Portuguese wines, surprising(ly good) desserts. (updated Feb 2021)

A unique atmosphere inside the restaurant is responsible for this fame, but the food is good too. The walls of the restaurant are filled with small pieces of paper, with writings from clients. Be aware that it is quite a small space, so there's a big probability that you won't find a table. Generous portions and a charcoal grill that makes a big difference compared with the electric ones. Try the bone marrow stew (from which the restaurant takes its name) or the grilled seabass or a great dish of stewed octopus and potatoes. (updated Feb 2021)
40.2087-8.43125 Restaurante Vitória, Rua da Sota 9, ☏ +351 239 824 049. Restaurante Vitória is in the city centre and has traditional dishes suchs as "cozido à portuguesa", "bacalhau assado na brasa", "chafana". Nice and quiet restaurant. (updated Feb 2021)

The food is great with some unique dishes from around the country - like "Vitela Maronesa" and "Secretos de Porco preto". Vegetarian meals. During the weekends there is jazz, folk and fado concerts - most of them for free. It's great to finish your meal - you have plenty of time, Portuguese are always late - and get a concert right there. Sometimes they get very crowded. (updated Feb 2021)

Go there at night, and try the chanfana, even though you may not have a clue about what this is. This is the place for those who really appreciate good food.

Another very popular Italian restaurant, close to the new bridge. The decoration is great, with a lot of pictures from Florence, Venice, Rome. The quality of the food is quite high. It's definitely not your standard pizza. (updated Feb 2021)
40.223-8.43929 O Telheiro, Rua do Padrão 262, ☏ +351 968 590 671, geral@otelheiro.pt. Tu-Sa 12:00–15:00 & 19:00–23:00, Su M closed. On the downside, it is very hard to get a table (but you will get one if you wait) and it is out of the centre of Coimbra (approx. 5 min from Coimbra B train station). €10–€25. (updated Feb 2021)
40.2099-8.430610 João dos Leitões, Rua da Gala 45, ☏ +351 239 821 001. M–F 09:00–19:00, Sa 09:00–15:00, Su closed. One of the most typical restaurants of the city. Its main dish is a roasted piglet served whole with potatoes and salad. €5–€18. (updated Feb 2021)

The bars in the City Park are open all day long.
Night out[edit]
The bars in the Parque Verde do Mondego are a good place to go for a drink during spring and summer. The bars around the Praça da República are full of the spirit of the students of the University, mainly during weekdays in autumn, winter and spring.
A warning: the students in this town seem to prefer Tuesday or Thursday night to go out. On weekends, this city is sleepy as many students go home to their families.

40.2106-8.42842 àCapella, Rua Corpo de Deus–Largo da Vitória, Capela Nossa Srª da Victória, ☏ +351 239 833 985, mail.acapella@gmail.com. Daily 19:00–02:00.
