Luss in Argyll and Bute is the first sizable village that you reach while heading north along Loch Lomond; 3 miles further north is Inverbeg. Although nowadays bypassed by the A82 main road, they're both busy and touristy, especially Luss where every coach excursion stops for photos and the gift shop, disgorging tourists asking if this is the loch that contains the Loch Ness Monster. You need to get away into the forests and hills or out on the water to enjoy the place. 


Understand[edit]
Lus is the Gaelic word for "herb"; the village population is around 450. TV viewers will recognise it as "Glendarroch", the setting for the soap opera Take the High Road, screened 1980 - 2003. The fictional village was remote, with its characters cast in upon each other. In reality Loch Lomond south of Luss is lowland in nature: broad, dotted with small islands and not very deep, among lush fields. Further north is distinctly highland, where the loch is a deep narrow fjord hemmed in by mountains. 

Get in[edit]

By bus: Citylink buses run from Glasgow Buchanan station every couple of hours, and stop in Luss and Inverbeg on their way to Fort William, Oban or Campbeltown. 
Garelochhead Bus 305 runs three times M-Sa from Alexandria and Balloch to Luss. Balloch is the nearest railway station, with frequent trains from Glasgow Queen Street. 
Bus 302 runs three times M-Sa from Helensburgh to Luss, Inverbeg, Tarbet, Arrochar, Lochgoilhead and Carrick Castle
By car take M8 west of Glasgow to cross Erskine Bridge then head north on A82 past Dumbarton to come onto the loch shore.
By bike: a cycle path runs from Balloch at the south end of the loch along bypassed loops of road and purpose-built track to Luss, and continues north to Tarbet, 17 miles in all. It's level going and suitable also for hikers, wheelchairs and horses.

Get around[edit]
Luss and Inverbeg are small and easily explored on foot, and there's a cycle path between them. Don't walk or cycle on the A82, which is pounding with traffic at all hours.
Sweeney's Waterbus crosses Loch Lomond April-Sept twice a day between Luss and Balmaha, with some calling at Inchcailloch island. One sailing per day is from Luss to Rowardennan then back across the loch to Tarbet. Bikes are carried and the waterbus timetable suggests some itineraries.

See[edit]
Luss Pier
Pier Road, leading down from Loch Lomond Arms Hotel to the shore, has an attractive line of 19th century cottages.
56.1004-4.63671 Luss parish church, Luss Pier. This was built in 1875 but has several much older monuments in the churchyard, such as cross-slabs which may be from the 7th century, and an 11th-century hogback grave-cover. The church interior is only open for services, 11:30AM on Sunday.   (updated Jul 2023)
56.0838-4.63752 Wee Peter is a statue of a boy on an offshore plinth by Aldochlay village. Mawkish legends are spun of how he drowned in the loch; actually he's just a piece of Victorian kitsch that turned up in a London scrapyard, and in 1890 a local man bought the statue to adorn the village. But Peter's hard to spot, and there's no public path to this part of the shore. At least he's protected there from drunks and vandals, who wouldn't hesitate to drown him again.
56.088-4.6273 Inchtavannach is the closest to shore of the loch islands, and one of the largest. It was the abode of St Kessog (hence Innis Taigh a' Mhanaich, island of the monk's house), who christianised the area and was martyred in 520 AD. It's nowadays private woodland and the waterbuses don't call here.
