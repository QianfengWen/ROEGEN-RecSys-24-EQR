Beaconsfield is a small town of 1,093 (2021) in northern Tasmania. Perhaps infamous for the 2006 Beaconsfield mine collapse – one of the worst mining accidents in Tasmanian history, the quaint town on the western banks of the Tamar River is possibly one of the best places in Tasmania to learn about the state's gold mining industry.
