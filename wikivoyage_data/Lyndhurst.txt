Understand[edit]




The Bisterne Dragon
The Bisterne Dragon legend takes place primarily in Bisterne, but also features Burley and Lyndhurst, and is one of the area's most famous pieces of folklore. The local tradition is that a dragon had his den at Burley Beacon, about 3 miles (4.8 km) east of Bisterne, at Burley.  One version of the tale is that the creature flew every morning to Bisterne, where it would be supplied with milk. To kill the dragon, a valiant knight (usually named Berkeley) built a hide, and with two dogs lay in wait. The creature came as usual one morning for its milk, and when the hut door was opened the dogs attacked it. The knight took the dragon by surprise, and the dogs died in the affray. 
Another version of the tale says that the dragon slayer only succeeded by covering his armour with glass. A popular telling of the story has it that the fight raged throughout the forest, with the dragon finally dying outside the village of Lyndhurst, his corpse turning into a hill (now known as Boltons Bench). Though the knight had defeated the dragon, he had been mentally broken by the battle, and after 30 days and 30 nights he went back to Boltons Bench to die alone atop it, his yew-wood bow falling on the ground beside his body and eventually sprouting into the yew tree which can still be seen today.


The first mention of Lyndhurst was in the Domesday Book of 1086 under the name 'Linhest'. The Court of Verderers sits in the Queen's House in Lyndhurst. (Verderers are forestry officials in England who deal with common land in certain former royal hunting areas which are the property of the Crown.)

To deal with the large volume of traffic through the village, there is a one-way system. This in effect turns the major roads of the village into a traffic circle. In summer the traffic through the village increases hugely because of the tourists. This can create queues into the village from all directions.

See[edit]
The Queen's House
 The Queen's House. The most important building in Lyndhurst is the Queen's House, which has also in the past been called the King's House, for the name changes according to the gender of the monarch. It is the principal building owned by the Crown in the New Forest, and contains the Verderers' Hall, home of the ancient Verderers' Court. The Queen's House is also the local headquarters of the Forestry Commission. The current structure largely dates from the 17th century, during the reigns of Charles I and Charles II. The building is a rambling two-storey structure in brick. The prisoners' dock, tables and chairs of considerable age are preserved in the hall. (updated Dec 2020)

It is over 500 years old and has a girth of 7.38 metres (24.2 ft). The tree is still growing. It was pollarded when about 200 years old and is thought to have been last pollarded in the mid 19th century.   (updated Dec 2020)
50.869-1.62413 Portuguese Fireplace (on the road between Bolderwood and Emery Down). The Portuguese Fireplace is a war memorial in the New Forest National Park. It is near to Millyford Bridge and is used as a Waymark. Because it was also operated by the Canadian Forestry Corps, it is also referred to locally as the Canadian Fireplace.   (updated Dec 2020)
The Church of St. Michael and All Angels was built in the 1860s, and contains a fresco by Lord Leighton and stained-glass windows by Charles Kempe, William Morris, Edward Burne-Jones and others; Alice Liddell, the inspiration for Alice in Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, is buried there.

As of 2020, it is not open to the public. A proposed redevelopment of the site would save the historic portion of the building.   (updated Dec 2020)
