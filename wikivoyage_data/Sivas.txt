Sivas is a city in Central Anatolia, with a population in 2020 of 335,570. By road it's 450 km east of Ankara, and stands at 1278 m elevation. It's industrial but has several 13th century Seljuk buildings, and is a transport hub. 


Understand[edit]
In the first century BC, the Romans called this place Sebaste for their emperor. There are scant remnants of those times as a series of conquerors came, smashed the place and marched on. However in 1174 it fell to the Seljuks, the Turkic people who supplanted Byzantine Rome in this region, and their fine medreses remain. The Ottomans arose in the 13th century and captured Sivas, but in 1400 Tamerlane stormed all the way from Kabul, occupied much of present day Turkey, and almost crushed the Ottoman dynasty. They regained the town in 1408 and held it until the modern republican era. It was here at the congress of 1919 that Atatürk cemented his position of leadership and launched the War of Independence.
Sivas stands on a high-altitude plain with hot, dry summers and bitterly cold, snowy winters. Summer nights can still be chilly, especially if the breeze picks up, so bring along at least some cold-weather clothing regardless of season. This climate suits hardy varieties of wheat, so the main industry is based on agriculture, such as manufacture of cereals.

By train[edit]
High speed YHT trains run three times daily from Ankara to Sivas at 08:00, 13:00, and 18:10, with the same return times. They take 2 hr 30 min via Kırıkkale and Yozgat; an adult single in 2023 is 240 TL economy, 360 TL business class. Two daily services also continue to and from Istanbul.
Conventional trains from Ankara run daily and take 11 hours via Kayseri (bypassed by the YHT). These have couchettes and a sleeping car, some carry a buffet but don't rely on it, bring your own rations. It's expected that these services will change radically once the YHT service is bedded in, as the Ankara trains could instead terminate in Sivas. 

Vangölü Express continues eastwards to Elazığ and Tatvan, which has buses and an occasional ferry to Van, for trains to Tabriz and Tehran in Iran.
Guney Kurtalan Express runs via Malatya to Diyarbakır and Kurtalan.
Dogu Express runs via Divriği, Erzincan and Erzurum to Kars. There's also a twice daily regional train between Erzincan, Divriği and Sivas.
Additionally, the regional Hattı train runs daily from Samsun on the Black Sea coast, taking eight hours via Havza and Amasya. It departs both ways around 08:30. 

39.73951637.006772 Sivas railway station (Sivas Garı), Muhsin Yazıcıoğlu Bulvarı (Two km southwest of town centr). This is the historic station, completed in 1934 and modernized in the early 2020s. It will continue to serve both conventional and high-speed train for the foreseeable future, as there are no firm plans to extend the YHT line further east.   (updated Apr 2024)

Çifte Minareli Medrese.
Sivas is famous for its three madrasas - Islamic schools - built by rival patrons in the late 13th century and vying with each other for splendour.

39.74908337.0153611 Buruciye Medrese (100 m south of Meydan). This patron was Muzaffer Burucerdi, and the school (completed in 1271) studied physics, chemistry and astronomy. The architect is unknown but it's in a square Seljuk style, with a courtyard surrounded by cells. These are windowless, so you'd sleep in them rather than study. It fell derelict in the 20th century but has been restored. Free entrance.   (updated Jan 2023)
