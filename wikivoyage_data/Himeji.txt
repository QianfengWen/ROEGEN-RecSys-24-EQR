Himeji (姫路) is a city near the western edge of the Kansai region of Japan, which has a World Heritage castle.


Understand[edit]
Himeji's main attractions are its gorgeous castle, one of the largest wooden structures in the world, built in the late 1500s, and Mount Shoshazan, a temple with a history of over 1,000 years.
Because of its picturesque old Japanese appearance, Himeji has been used for filming many Japanese and foreign movies; props from these films, including "The Last Samurai," can be found in the JR station information center.

Daily 09:00-17:00 (admission is only until 16:00); May-Aug until 18:00 (admission is until 17:00); closed December 29–31. The Main keep is limited to the first 15,000 visitors each day. Dating to 1609 and also graced with the name "White Egret Castle" (白鷺城 Shirasagi-jō), this striking white edifice is generally considered the most beautiful of Japan's castles and is one of the few that has escaped the ravages of civil war, World War II, earthquakes, and firebombings. The castle was designated as a national treasure in 1931 and was registered as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1993. It is virtually the last castle in Japan that still manages to tower over the surrounding skyscrapers and office buildings. Although renovated, much of the castle looks as it did when it was first built, and in contrast to European castles, is very empty, consistent with the Japanese minimalist style of the time. On extremely busy days, you may have to wait to enter since the number of visitors at any one time is limited. Check the website for a "congestion forecast" and status. ¥1,000 adults and ¥300 children. A ¥1,050/¥360 combination ticket gets you into both the castle and the nearby Kōkoen Garden. A free guided tour in English is included if a guide happens to be available (no reservations are possible).

This magnificent collection of 9 Edo-period-style walled gardens was laid out in 1992 on a site where samurai houses once stood. The street plan and gated partitions preserve the appearance of the old residential quarter, except that within the various enclosures visitors find beautifully landscaped gardens and water features instead of noble residences. There is a tea arbour and a restaurant within the grounds, but eating and drinking outside of these places is prohibited. ¥310 adults and ¥150 children. A ¥1,050 combination ticket gets you into both Kōkoen and Himeji Castle.

Festivals and events[edit]
Cherry Blossom Viewing Party, usually around the second Sunday in April. Lots of koto and taiko drumming.
Yukata Matsuri - mid June, runs 2-3 days.

Which is a good enough reason to go. This festival is always packed and makes for great people-watching, as many kinds of Japanese subcultures are on display.
Oshiro Matsuri - early august. A large parade down the main street ending at Himeji castle. There is also a big stage to see lots of dancing, which can range from either very traditional to very hip. Often it's a combination of the two.
