For other places with the same name, see Mecca (disambiguation).

Mecca, officially known as Makkah al-Mukarramah (Arabic: مكة المكرمة, Makkah al-Mukarramah), is a city in Saudi Arabia and the holiest city in Islam. 
Mecca is the birthplace of Prophet Muhammed, the founder of Islam, and Muslims believe the Qur'an was first revealed to Muhammad here. The Great Mosque of Mecca, known as Masjid al-Haram is considered to be Islam's most sacred mosque and Muslims anywhere face toward it when they pray.
Each year, millions of people from around the world flock to Mecca for the Hajj pilgrimage, which is an obligation for all Muslims. This makes Mecca the most visited city in all of Saudi Arabia. 


Understand[edit]




Pilgrimage
The pilgrimage to Mecca, known as the Hajj, is obligatory for all Muslims provided they are physically and financially capable. Over three million Muslims visit the city during the month of Dhu'l-Hijjah yearly. 
Visits outside this month are known as minor pilgrimages or Umrah, which are not compulsory but are strongly encouraged. The Umrah can be performed in less than a few hours whereas the Hajj is more time-consuming, and involves more rituals.
The Umrah is not intended to be a substitute for the Hajj; however, both are demonstrations of submission to Allah (god). 


History[edit]
Mecca is generally considered "the fountainhead and cradle of Islam". 

Early history[edit]
See also: Pre-Islamic Arabia, Islam, Islamic Golden Age, Ottoman Empire
Muslims believe that the history of Mecca goes back to Abraham (Ibrahim) who built the Kaaba with the help of his eldest son Ishmael around 2000 BCE. In 570 CE, Muhammad was born in Mecca. Since those days, Mecca's history and identity has been inextricably linked with Islam.
According to Muslim traditions, in 610, it was in Mecca (inside the Hira cave on the mountain of Jabal al-Nour) where Muhammad the age of 40 received his first revelation from Allah, through the Angel Gabriel. Muhammad then begin preaching. In 622, Muhammad left Mecca for Yathrib (now called Medina) for fear of being assassinated by the local Quraysh ruling clan, who had declined to accept Muhammad and his beliefs and started persecuting followers of Islam. As Muhammad migrated to Medina and settled there, several armed conflicts followed between followers of Muhammad and local tribes of Mecca, particularly one during which the followers of Muhammad attempted to return to Mecca in 628 for pilgrimage but weren't allowed to enter the city. A peace treaty was eventually signed that allowed followers of Muhammad to return to Mecca. In 629, Muhammad along with thousands of his followers migrated back to Mecca from Medina (where he had lived for 13 years) for a Hajj, known as the first pilgrimage. According to Muslims, the peace treaty was to also include ceasefire for 10 years but after 2 years, the Quraysh violated the truce by slaughtering a group of Muslims. Muhammad and his followers, companions and allies now much stronger in number, so instead of fighting back, they simply marched across the city of Mecca and thereby triggered the surrender of the Quraysh of Mecca. Eventually, Muhammad Islamicized the city and made it the center of Muslim pilgrimage, Hajj, which is one of the five pillars of Islam.

Medieval times[edit]
Mecca has been ruled by various dynasties over the last 1500 years. Starting in 1517 CE, with only one short interruption, Mecca and the rest of the Hejaz were under the control of the Ottoman Empire. From the 10th century, the local religious and temporal leaders were the Hashemite Emirs.

20th century[edit]
The Hashemites, working with the British intelligence officer Lawrence, led a successful revolt against the Turks during World War I. After the war, (at least as Arabs see it) the British betrayed their allies. Despite wartime promises, there was no independent Arab state in the Levant, only British and French protectorates.
In 1924, Mecca was conquered by the ibn Saud family following a short battle. This was part of the process of founding modern-day Saudi Arabia.
Meanwhile, the British helped put Hashemites on the thrones of Transjordan and Iraq.

Grand Mosque seizure[edit]
On 20 November 1979, armed extremists attacked and seized the Grand Mosque, calling for the overthrow of the Saudi royal family. The siege lasted two weeks, until the armed forces of Pakistan and France intervened to assist the Saudi authorities.
The seizure of the Grand Mosque had a profound impact on the Muslim world and changed the course of Saudi Arabia's societal and political direction; after the extremists were captured and executed by the Saudi government, Saudi Arabia adopted a more  conservative stance, giving more power to the religious authorities and enforcing Islamic law more strictly. The role of women in Saudi society was completely reduced (female TV presenters were a common sight prior to the seige) and travel to Saudi Arabia became more restricted and regulated.

Modern history[edit]
Like any other city around the world, Mecca has its fair share of issues and problems. The Saudi government is routinely criticised for downplaying the severity of incidents during the Hajj, poorly managing the city, and demolishing Islamic heritage sites in the city. It has been estimated that 95% of Mecca's historic buildings, most of which were more than a thousand years old, have been demolished by the Saudi government. Many people from around the world have expressed anger and frustration at this, seeing this as cultural vandalism and an attempt to erase and eradicate Islam's origins and identity. 
The Saudi government claims they're trying to accomodate Hajj pilgrims and make them feel comfortable, but some do not agree with that, claiming that the Saudi government is more interested in making Mecca a tourist destination. The Saudi government routinely rejects criticism of how they're managing the city, hitting back at critics by telling them that they are "playing politics" or "interfering" in state affairs. 
One notable critic of the Saudi government's management of the city is the Turkish government. A number of Ottoman Empire structures in the city have been demolished, which the Turkish government sees as an attempt to diminish their historical legacy in the city. In 2002, the Ajyad Fortress, an Ottoman citadel that stood on a hill overlooking the Grand Mosque of Mecca, was demolished by the Saudi government to make way for the Abraj Al Bait, a $15 billion project designed to accommodate the vast and growing number of Hajj pilgrims. The Turkish government, as well as others in the international community, unsuccessfully tried to prevent the Saudi government from demolishing the fort.
Recent events, such as the 2015 Mina stampede, have drawn strong responses from governments in Muslim-majority countries. Iran, a country that has long been at odds with the Saudi government, has banned its citizens from going to Mecca for the Hajj a few times (only to reverse the bans later on) after several Iranian pilgrims were killed in separate incidents.

Visa requirements[edit]

For more information on Saudi immigration regulations, please refer to the "Get in" section of the Saudi Arabia article. 
If you plan on visiting during the Hajj, you must apply for a Hajj visa.

By plane[edit]
Since Mecca is deemed as a sacred and holy land, Mecca is a no-fly zone. There are no airports in the city, and commercial planes are strictly forbidden from flying over the city.

The main gateway to Mecca is 21.67944439.1566671 King Abdulaziz International Airport (JED IATA) (in Jeddah). The airport has a dedicated Hajj terminal that is only used during the Hajj. Millions of pilgrims pass through this terminal during the Hajj, so expect the terminal to be crowded.   
Another gateway to Mecca is 21.483440.5415222 Ta'if International Airport (TIF IATA) (in Taif). Since it is a relatively small airport, very few airlines operate at the airport. The government plans on constructing a Hajj terminal for pilgrims at the airport, but as of 2022, work on it has been delayed due to the effects of COVID-19.   
By car[edit]
Once you've landed in either Jeddah or Taif, the next step is to drive to the city.  Mecca is served by two major highways: Highway 40 and Highway 15.

If you are driving from Jeddah, go along Highway 40. Highway 40 is a well-maintained, modern, multi-lane highway and the journey will take you at least 60 minutes depending on traffic conditions. Expect this highway to be completely jammed and packed during the Hajj or the Umrah, however.
Another easier way to enter Mecca is through Taif. Just drive along Highway 15 and you will reach Mecca in 60 minutes. Since most Hajj pilgrims fly into Jeddah, expect this highway to be completely free of traffic. If you desire to enter Mecca quickly, it is recommended that you take this route.
If you don't have your own car, you can consider doing the following: 

Hail a taxi at the Jeddah airport to take you to Mecca. You can share the costs with other pilgrims if you choose to do so. Prices might be higher during the Hajj season, so stay alert.
Hail an Uber to take you to Mecca. Uber works in all major cities in Saudi Arabia.
By train[edit]
The quickest way to enter the city is by train. A train ride to Mecca from Jeddah will take you at least 30 or so minutes.  The Haramain high-speed railway links Mecca and Medina via Jeddah, and you can directly go to the city from the train station at King Abdulaziz International Airport.

By bus[edit]
The Saudi Arabian Public Transport Company (SAPTCO) offers bus services to and from the city. A bus ride from Jeddah to Meccah would normally take you 1¼ hours depending on traffic conditions. 
SAPTCO also offers a VIP service to Mecca. VIP buses are a lot more comfortable, have free Wi-Fi, and are more spacious. If you're not a citizen of a GCC country, make sure you have a valid passport and the right visa before boarding a VIP bus. 
There are many ways in which you can book a bus ride to Mecca. You can do it at a SAPTCO branch, on the SAPTCO app (iOS, Android), or on the website. The SAPTCO app is only in Arabic.

Get around[edit]
Mecca's transportation network is well developed, however, expect getting around to be a literal hassle during the Hajj; millions of pilgrims are in every nook and corner of the city, and it can take ages to get to one place from another. 

By metro[edit]
Mecca Metro trains. Modern and eye-feasting.
Metro stations


The Al Mashaaer Al Mugaddassah Metro line (Arabic: قطار المشاعر المقدسة الخط الجنوبي) is the only operating metro line in the city. The metro was built in the year 2010 by a Chinese railway construction firm (China Railway Construction Corporation Limited). It is believed to have the highest capacity of any existing metro in the world, which, truthfully, should come as no surprise to you, considering how millions of pilgrims flock every year to Mecca for the Hajj. 
There are plans to fully add another metro network in the near future and this new network, known as Makkah Mass Rail Transit, will consist of four lines: line A, line B, line C, and line D. A total of 88 stations are expected to be served by this intended expansion. Although this sounds impressive, construction contracts have still not yet been awarded as of yet. Once construction contracts get awarded and the project gets finished, you can expect to get around Mecca with ease and convenience. But that's ages from now. 

Al Mashaaer Al Mugaddassah Metro[edit]
The Al Mashaaer Al Mugaddassah Metro line has nine stations and is used as an exclusive shuttle train for pilgrims between holy sites in Mecca, Mount Arafat, Muzdalifah, and Mina. As is the case with all transport modes during the Hajj, the metro can be densely crowded and packed, so plan and prepare accordingly. 

21.41881839.8708536 Jamarat (Mina 3) (قطار المشاعر - محطة منى 3 - الجمرات), King Abdul Aziz Rd, Al Mashair. The very first station of the Metro. It is approximately 5km away from Masjid Al-Haram.

By car[edit]
Being served by two major highways, you can very easily cover the entire city by car. Mecca's road transportation network is well-maintained, organised, and well developed. Roads typically tend to be free of any traffic after the Hajj. 
Uber works in Mecca. If you don't feel comfortable driving on Saudi roads, or if you don't have your own car, you can hail an Uber.

By foot[edit]
During the Hajj, expect to do lots and lots of walking. A lot of attractions in the city center are within walking distance.

Covered in black cloth, it is circled seven times by Muslim pilgrims and it is toward the Kaaba that Muslims face in the direction while performing Islamic prayers (Salat). The Black Stone set intact into the Kaaba's eastern cornerstone wall by Muhammad himself is an Islamic relic which, according to Muslim tradition, dates back to the time of Adam and Eve. Many Muslim pilgrims while doing Tawaf try to kiss and touch the sacred stone; however, this usually requires a lot of effort because of crowding.   (updated Apr 2015)
21.4226239.826333 Maqaam-e-Ibrahim. Next to Kaaba is a crystal dome called Maqaam-e-Ibrahim, which contains a rock that is believed to have an imprint of Abraham's foot.

21.38333339.856 Cave Thawr (Ghaar-e-Thawr), Jabal Thawr. This is the cave in which Prophet Muhammed hid in as he made departure to Yathrib (now Medina) from Mecca while being pursued by Quraish of Mecca who were planning to harm him. According to traditions, once Muhammad and his companion made entrance into the cave, the entrance was blocked by a spider which had cast a web to cover it and gave the impression to members of Quraish that no one has made entrance inside the cave since a long time thus saved life of Muhammad. Today, many pilgrims climb up the 1,405 m high mountan to see the cave.   (updated Apr 2015)

Mecca in general is a safe city, but one should take extra precautions during the annual Hajj pilgrimage. 
The various safety tips found in the Saudi Arabia article will come in handy. Refer it to often to stay out of trouble. 

Overcrowding and stampedes[edit]
Expect things to get this crowded during the Hajj.
Overcrowding and stampedes are not unusual in Mecca. Since the development of air travel, pilgrims have been able to access the city much easily than before (earlier people used to travel to Mecca by boat or by other means), and as a result, the city's capacity can be completely overwhelmed.
If you're travelling with family members or with a friend, stick together. Supervise your children (if you have any) closely to make sure they are close to you and are not lost among the crowd.
In September 2015, approximately 2,236 pilgrims were trampled upon and killed in Mina, an incident regarded as the worst ever stampede in the city. The stampede drew extremely strong responses from Muslim-majority countries, with some blaming the Saudi government for being negligent and downplaying the severity of the incident, and the Iranian government (Iran had the highest casualty toll in the stampede) was angered to such a great extent that they went as far as banning their citizens from performing the Hajj in 2016.

Extreme weather[edit]
Mecca has a hot desert climate and temperatures regularly reach as high as 50°C (120°F) during the summers. 
As is the case throughout the Middle East, always check weather conditions and hydrate often; you can very easily get exhausted, lethargic, and dehydrated if you do not take the necessary precautions.

Pickpocketing[edit]
There are many dishonest people and groups that often try to take advantage of the Hajj pilgrimage and/or the Umrah to deprive people of their personal property. You should not assume that Mecca only attracts the honest. 
When traversing through the crowds, keep your valuables safe. Err on the side of safety and don't take any unnecessary risks. If you have been the victim of theft, call the police. Saudi authorities treat theft very seriously, largely because of a zero-tolerance justice system.

Construction-related accidents[edit]
The Saudi authorities invest heavily into construction projects designed to cater to Hajj pilgrims, and this has, on occasion, caused a few construction-related accidents. 
In 2015, a crawler crane in the Grand Mosque collapsed, killing 111 pilgrims and injuring dozens of others. In the event something is being renovated or constructed, do not walk close to any construction site. Give all renovation sites a wide berth.

Female travellers[edit]
Since 2018, female pilgrims have spoken up about sexual abuse and harassment experienced on the Hajj. Although it is unlikely you'll experience severe harassment, don't be afraid to create a scene and don't feel the need to be polite in the event someone harasses you; no woman would be expected to put up with rotten behaviour like that. 
The Hajj is time-consuming and can take a huge toll on your physical health. Many pregnant pilgrims suffer miscarriages during the Hajj. If you are expecting soon or if you are recuperating from an illness, it is strongly recommended that you postpone your trip.

Stay healthy[edit]
There are several hospitals in Mecca. 

21.43602839.8539681 King Faisal Hospital, ☏ +966 12 526 3200. 
Respect[edit]
As the holiest city in Islam, appropriate religious prohibitions and attitudes should be in order. When you're here for either the Hajj or the Umrah, remember to eschew from the following: smoking, engaging in sexual relations, using foul language, shaving your hair and cutting your nails.

Local etiquette[edit]
The various respect tips found in the Saudi Arabia article are of immense help. Familiarise yourself with Saudi etiquette before entering Mecca.
Refrain from pontificating about the Saudi government's construction campaign in the city; the issue is very sensitive among some.

General etiquette[edit]
You are bound to meet people from all over the world. Be open to new experiences, and don't feel afraid of communicating with anyone. Approach people with a positive attitude and you are apt to make friends; a gruff, impatient attitude may generate resentment.

Photography[edit]
It's actually forbidden to take photographs inside the Masjid Al-Haram, but the rules are not rigorously enforced. In fact, it is quite common to see people clicking away happily with their smart phones inside the mosque. You would, however, arouse suspicion from the staff if you come in with a fancy camera. 
There's some disagreement on whether or not people should take photographs inside the Masjid Al-Haram. Although some don't see it as a big deal and will happily share their photographs with others, many others consider it incredibly disrespectful. 
If you feel the need to take a photo, don't engage in "touristy" behaviour (i.e. acting like you're seeing a place for the first time in forever) and don't conduct yourself in a way that would be perceived as disruptive or annoying. Always be considerate to the people around you; chances are, other people take things more seriously than you do!
