Flensburg (Danish: Flensborg) is a city in Schleswig-Holstein located on the east coast. The 90,000 (2018) inhabitants live around the Flensburger Förde (Flensborg fjord). Its main claim to fame besides being a border town is the fact that the central registry for traffic offenses committed throughout Germany is headquartered in Flensburg. While Flensburg, like much of Schleswig Holstein, had received an enormous number of refugees after the war and thus its population jumped above 100 000 in 1945, making it a Großstadt according to the German definition of the term, it had lost this status again by 1952 when the population fell through refugees moving on to more permanent housing. As population has been on the uptick in the 21st century, there is talk locally of achieving the population of 100 000 again in the near future.

Understand[edit]




"Flensburg Government"
In the last few days of World War 2 most leading Nazis were either in Berlin and going down with their Führer or had tried to escape, sometimes offering to make separate peace with the Western Allies (which Hitler deemed "treason" signing execution orders against anybody who tried it). When Hitler committed suicide, he named various people to various posts in his testament (a thing that was of course against all laws or legal precedent - but the Nazis did not exactly care about such things) but his appointed "successor", Propaganda Minister Goebbels committed suicide after a single day "in office"(as was expected of him) so whatever semblance of a German "government" there still was fell to a bunch of Nazis in and around Flensburg under "President" Karl Dönitz (formerly an admiral) and "Chancellor"  Johann Ludwig Graf Schwerin von Krosigk appointed by Dönitz. While the Brits initially let the sham happen under their eyes, because they hoped it could help in ensuring an orderly surrender of German forces (which was signed May 7th by the military leadership) by May 23 the Brits had had enough and arrested the ridiculously top-heavy "government" that had barely "governed" over even Flensburg for less than a month.


Flensburg has long been a bi- or even trilingual community with a strong Danish minority and a German majority that gradually switched from speaking High German ("Hochdeutsch") only with out-of-towners and speaking Low German ("Niederdeutsch" or "Plattdeutsch") in virtually all other situations to speaking less and less Low German - though there are efforts to preserve the language.
As the Danish border is just across the fjord, virtually all government offices and museums (even smaller ones) will offer their website in German and Danish and often also English. Dutch and Low German historically formed a dialect continuum and written Dutch is close enough to written German that competent speakers of one can make out the gist of a text in the other, but don't count on mutual intelligibility.
Due to the border, many Danes come to Flensburg to buy goods which are either unavailable or more expensive in Denmark, particularly booze, which is highly taxed in the Nordic countries. On the other hand, people from Flensburg like hopping across the border to places like Sønderborg to sight-see or shop.
The tourist information center is in the old town centre.

Get in[edit]
By bus or train[edit]
54.77449.436671 Flensburg station. Sadly the historic main station built in the 1880s which was much closer to most points of interest was shut down and so if you're arriving by train, you'll be somewhat out of town.   (updated Nov 2023)
There are bus and train connections both from Denmark and Hamburg. Search Bahn.de for public connections in Germany, and DSB for Denmark.

54.78589.43742 Zentraler Omnibusbahnhof Flensburg (ZOB) (Central bus station). Built as one of the first central bus stations in Germany in the 1930s and sometimes jokingly referred to as "Gummibahnhof" ("rubber station") it sits at the site of the old central train station and is thus much closer to many points of interest.  
By car[edit]
Most people arrive here by car. Flensburg is situated at the border of Germany and Denmark, beside the motorway  ( in Denmark) leading to Hamburg in the south and to Kolding and further north in Denmark. It's one of the most important routes between the Nordic countries and Central Europe.

By plane[edit]
The nearest airports are Hamburg (HAM IATA) about 150 km (93 mi) away offering a wide array of flights to domestic and international destinations and Sønderborg (SGD IATA, in Denmark 50 km (31 mi)  away; flights from Copenhagen only). Hamburg airport is served by the Hamburg S-Bahn and from Hamburg main station direct RE and Intercity trains leave for Flensburg with a travel time a bit under 2 hours. From Sonderborg airport take a taxi to the rail station and then DSB train.

By boat[edit]
