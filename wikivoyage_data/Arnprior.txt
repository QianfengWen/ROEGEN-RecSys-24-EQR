Arnprior is a town of about 9,600 people (2021) on the Madawaska and Ottawa rivers in Eastern Ontario.


Understand[edit]
Arnprior, aka "the Prior", is the gateway to tourism in the Upper Ottawa Valley and the Western gateway to Ottawa and Canada's National Capital Region.
Arnprior takes its name from the village of Arnprior Stirlingshire, Scotland (UK) from where its founding fathers came. It is known for lumber, hydro power generation, aerospace, and farming.

History[edit]
Arnprior Weir
In May 1613 European explorers, led by Samuel de Champlain, first visited the Ottawa River valley, home of the Algonquin tribe of First Nations (Aboriginal) people.
In 1823, a 1,200-acre (490 ha) surveyed block was ceded to Archibald McNab and given the eponymous name, McNab Township. McNab had approval from the Family Compact to treat the settlers on his land in the feudal manner practised in Scotland. In 1831 the town was named by the Buchanan Brothers after McNab's ancestral home of Arnprior, between Stirling and Drymen, Scotland.
Tired of the harsh treatment, the settlers revolted and, after a government investigation, McNab was forced to vacate the area in 1841. Arnprior, Braeside and McNab township grew as separate communities and boomed when they became integrated into eastern Ontario's massive timber industry.
One of the most successful businessmen of the upper Ottawa was Daniel McLachlin, who built a massive sawmill at the confluence of the Madawaska and Ottawa Rivers, and expanded the community of Arnprior. The lumber industry maintained a significant position until the closing of the Gillies Mill. The forests of the period are represented in the Grove which is an excellent example of indigenous forest, grown after a fire in the 18th century. With individual specimens reaching 175 feet (53 m), these are the tallest white pines in Ontario.
