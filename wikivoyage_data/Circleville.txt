By car[edit]
The backbone of Circleville's transportation system is the two major US Highways running through it. 
US 22 runs WSW-ENE through the city and forms Main Street through downtown. It continues WSW to Washington CH and Wilmington before terminating in downtown Cincinnati. It travels east past Ohio Christian University to Lancaster, Zanesville, Cambridge, and Steubenville before continuing into West Virginia and Pennsylvania.
US 23 runs N-S through Circleville, just west of downtown. It is a two lane divided highway for most of its length through town, but has a freeway-style exit at US 22/OH-56 into downtown Circleville. It continues north to Columbus, Delaware (Ohio), Marion, Upper Sandusky, Fostoria, and on to Toledo and Michigan. It continues south to Chillicothe, Waverly, Portsmouth, and Huntington (W. Va.) metro, before winding through the Appalachians.
Numerous state highways service the city as well, the most major being OH-56, providing access to I-71 to the northwest.

Get around[edit]
By car[edit]
Because the city is relatively small, it isn't difficult to get around. The major streets in Circleville are:

Main Street (US 22/OH-56) runs ESE-WNW through downtown. The two highways merge just west of town, then they cross the Scioto River into town. They split just to the east of downtown.
Lancaster Pike (US 22) when US 22/OH-56 splits to the east of town, US 22 goes northeast to Lancaster, about 20 miles away. This is a major road, and it has many businesses along the road. The Pickaway County Fairgrounds are also along Lancaster Pike.
Court Street (partially OH-188) is another major street in Circleville. The intersection of Main and Court is the center of downtown, and north of Main Street, Court Street becomes OH-188. It continues south to the main shopping district.
Northridge Rd (OH-188) to the north of town, OH-188 turns northeast onto Northridge Rd, which goes toward Lancaster.
Nicholas Dr is a major N-S road starting at US 22 and continuing to Northridge Rd. Mostly through residential, but is near Circleville Public Schools and the YMCA.
US 23 is the main transportation corridor in Circleville. To the south of town, it runs through a major shopping district with a Walmart, many restaurants, and a few hotels.
