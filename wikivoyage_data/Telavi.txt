If you were looking for the Israeli city, look here
Telavi (Georgian: თელავი), with a population of 21,800, is the capital of the province of Kakheti in the country of Georgia.


Understand[edit]
Located within the Alasani valley and besides Sighnaghi, Telavi is an important regional tourist centre with many accommodation options; it serves as a base for trips (churches, wineries, parks) into the rest of the region. Nevertheless, it is also great for a day trip from Tbilisi. The similarity of the city's name to Tel Aviv is often used in Georgian jokes.
In the 2nd century, Telavi was first mentioned as Teleda on the world map Geographike Hyphegesis of the Greek geographer Ptolemy. The name originated from the Georgian word Tela, meaning elm. Under Kwirike the Great and during the 9th century, the city became the capital of the kingdom Kakhati-Hereti. The city developed into an important Georgian trade centre until the 12th century, due to its convenient location near the silk road. King Artshil II. made the city capital of the Kakheti region and built his palace and fortress here.

Get in[edit]
By marshrutka[edit]
There are 3 marshrutka stations:

41.92337245.4708612 Main marshrutka station (south end of Alazani Avenue). E.g. for Tsinandali, 8 km east of Telavi, 0.5 lari; taxi: 5 lari. Although Sighnaghi and Telavi are close to each other, there are only 1-2 marshrutkas a day, so check the schedule beforehand. Your best bet in that case would be hitch-hiking instead, which is rather easy along the "highway". 
41.9235745.4724363 Marshrutkas heading to Alaverdi Monastery (from the main marshrutka station cross the road, take a narrow street for 20-30 m, and there is a small parking lot with more marshrutkas). 
 Marshrutkas heading from/to Tbilisi (Old Bus Station (on Google Maps)) (walk 200-300 m from the main marshrutka station direction north (i.e. down) of Alazari avenue. The station is a bit hidden shortly after the traffic light, down an alleyway on the left.). From Tbilisi, marshrutkas depart more or less hourly (at least 09:00 and 10:00, but there many more throughout the day) from the Ortachalla station (in front of the station). 10 lari, takes up to 2½ hr (especially when by near Sighnaghi and through Gurjaani before heading to Telavi). 
By car[edit]
There are two options to get to Telavi from Tbilisi. One is highway no. 5 and no. 42 by Gurjaani, about 140 km. The shorter and newer option is highway no. 38, departing shortly after the Tbilisi city border near Vaziani north from highway no. 5, about 70 km. The latter one is via the Gombori Pass and notably shorter, even though not much faster due to the many turns and serpentines. In winter and with snow it is recommended to take the longer route.
The road between Akhmeta and the Georgian Military Highway, via Tianeti, can only be done by 4WD.

Get around[edit]
41°55′11″N 45°28′7″EMap of Telavi
The city is small enough to be walkable. However, visiting the neighboring sites requires the use of further marshrutkas and/or taxis.
Whereas seeing one or two sites (e.g., the fortress/palace and nearby Alaverdi Monastery) can be a one-day activity from Tbilisi, it is best to stay several days in Telavi to fully enjoy the surroundings (including Tusheti and Sighnaghi).

See[edit]
Alaverdi Cathedral
41.9178945.476121 Palace of King Erekle II (Telavi Castle/Batonis Tsikhe), 1 Erekle II street. closed for renovation as of March 2017, likely to reopen in summer. Palace of the ruler of Kakheti Kingdom between 1744 and 1798, and afterwards fortress and seat of Kakheti Kingdom through the centuries. The palace inhabits influences of the nearby neighbour in the south, Persia. Southeast of the palace also the King Erekle II on a horse monument can be found.   
41.9167245.478082 900-year-old Plane tree, Chadari street (100m in front of the statue of King Erekle II). 46 m in height, and 36 m in diameter at the top. Likely the oldest living thing you will hug in your life. This tree has an unusually large circumference and in summer provides shade for the local (friendly) street dogs. The local people call it Chadari. Free. 
41.9196445.468723 St. George Church. 
41.9195645.469754 Cholokashvili Street (Old City). Beautifully renovated street/old town. Not very busy during low season. The renovation is considered critically by some, because it does often not resemble the original version and many of the buildings behind are left untouched and thus continue to fall apart. 
41.9200345.457715 Russian Era Monument (St. Barbare), Kartuli Universiteti St. (west of the city, the forest side road to the monument is shortly after the cemetery on the right hand side). Here you find the 40-50 m high St. Barbare, which appears to be a monument for the fallen soldiers 
42.03244645.3763076 Alaverdi Cathedral. One of the most important monasteries in Georgia built in the 11th century.   (updated Mar 2021)
Close-by sights that can easily be reach by marshrutka or taxi are Alaverdi Monastery, Ikalto Monastery, Shuamta Monasteries, Tsinandali and even Gremli – see Kakheti.

A good starting point is the shop close to the big Plane tree and the statue in Telavi itself. The staff speaks fluent English, they sell wines from a number of wineries and they have information and prices for different tastings you can do. They can also organize a driver to take you there.

Numerous homestays have opened up in Telavi. Many Kakhetian houses are quite large and are traditionally home for both the family of the wife and the husband.
