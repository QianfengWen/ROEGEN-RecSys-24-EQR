Ballymena is a town historically in County Antrim in Northern Ireland. These counties have been abolished and the town is now part of the Borough of Mid and East Antrim. It was badly scarred by The Troubles, by economic decline, and associated social problems. It's nowadays a commuter town for Belfast and in 2011 had a population of 29,551. The Travel Information Centre is in the Braid Centre on Bridge St.


Understand[edit]
In Irish Baile Meánach means "the middle townland" and it is more or less central in the historic county, standing midway between Belfast and Derry. It was one of the earliest Plantation towns; in 1626 the area passed to the Adair family, who held it until 1904. 
Ballymena is best known as the buckle of the "Bible Belt" of Northern Ireland, and the powerbase of The Reverend Dr Ian Paisley (1926-2014). To call him a Protestant and Unionist does not begin to describe the biliousness of his position. In a political and religious career spanning over 60 years, he was fanatically opposed to civil rights or any other concessions to the Roman Catholic minority population, and he encouraged the formation of Protestant militias. He founded the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster, a bible-literalist sect who halted the teaching of evolution in Ballymena schools. He preached that the Pope was the Antichrist, and when Princess Margaret and the Queen Mother met Pope John XXIII in 1958, Paisley condemned them for "committing spiritual fornication and adultery with the Antichrist". Later he became convinced that the European Union was a Popish plot. In 1971 he founded the Democratic Unionist Party, and was elected MP (and later MEP) by huge majorities for decade after decade. From 1977 he campaigned to "Save Ulster From Sodomy" but was unable to prevent the decriminalisation of homosexual acts. Nor was he able to block the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. He mellowed somewhat under power-sharing, in 2007 becoming First Minister of Northern Ireland, with a decent working relationship with deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness of Sinn Féin (the duo were dubbed "The Chuckle Brothers"). He retired from politics and his ministry in 2010, with his son Ian Paisley Jr succeeding him as MP for Mid-Antrim.
