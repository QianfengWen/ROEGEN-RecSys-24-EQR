St Peters Cathedral, Madera
Madera (known also as Ciudad Madera) is a small town in the Northern Mexico state of Chihuahua. With a highland location in the Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range, the town's elevation of 2,112 meters gives it a pleasantly cool climate where dense pine forests thrive. These forests have been the source of the town's economic reliance on the lumber industry. A number of archaeological sites nearby contains remnants of the Anasazi (Mogollon culture).


Understand[edit]
Madera is a young town by Mexican standards, having been founded in 1906 to harvest lumber from area forests. During the Mexican Revolution it was occasionally used as an outpost by Pancho Villa's Division del Norte. 
In September 1965, the town was the site of an armed insurrection by a leftist guerrilla group called Grupo Popular Guerrillero. The Mexican Army moved in quickly with paratroopers and regular army units. They moved to control strategic points and were able to put down the nascent rebellion.

29.19432-108.1420911 Concatedral de San Pedro de Madera, Calle Primera 102. The town's main church is an amazingly cool looking building of rustic stone construction with wrought iron hardware. For a cathedral, it's shockingly small: smaller even than a typical parish church in most parts of Mexico. The building has a single nave, high stained glass windows, a single belfry and a single dome. 
 Zona Arquelogica Huápoca, Cd.Madera (From Ciudad Madera, drive west on Av Independencia which turns into a rural road that will take you 35 km along twisty, rugged mountain roads). Daily 09:00 - 18:00. Large archaeological site with cliffside dwellings, a spa area features natural pools and a modern swimming pool for those who don't want to bathe in the river, and a large pre-historic cave with cave drawings called Cueva Grande. An interesting site museum is open daily. Other highlights include Cueva de Aguila, Cuevad de Serpiente caves, and the Huápoca bridge. This can be a full-day experience so pack a lunch and bring water and sunblock. 
Cuarenta Casas is another archaeological site about 40 km north of town. It is an old Anasazi (Mogollon culture) settlement with spectacular dwellings built into the cliff face with most of the home occupying caves in the rock wall. The site is thought to have been used as a military outpost for the protection of trade routes between Paquime and indigenous settlements in modern-day Arizona and New Mexico.
