Singaraja is the largest city in North Bali, and the former colonial administrative capital of not only Bali, but the whole of the Lesser Sunda Islands. Singaraja still has some of the feel of an old colonial capital. The streets are wider and grander than elsewhere in Bali and some of the old houses set in large gardens recall days long gone. 


Understand[edit]
Singaraja can be a little quirky
Singaraja just looks different to other towns and cities in Bali. This is also a noticeably multi ethnic city. The Arabic influence is especially apparent in the district near the old docks called Kampung Arab and the largest Chinese temple in Bali is here.
This is major academic centre with two universities, and the number of students residing swells the population to just over 100,000, making Singaraja Bali's second largest city.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
It takes 3 to 4 hours to drive to Singaraja from the south of Bali. There are three main routes: east via Kintamani, taking in the stunning active volcano and mountain vistas, west via Pupuan, through beautiful rice-paddies, spice and coffee plantations; and central, via Bedugul with its famous market and botanical gardens. Whichever route you take, the journey is sure to be scenic and interesting.

By motorcycle[edit]
The ability to overtake on single lane roads reduces the travel time significantly especially when delays abound during peak hours.

By taxi[edit]
A prepaid taxi from the Denpasar airport will cost Rp 600,000-800,000.
