Wells Cathedral
Bishop's Palace
Wells is the smallest city in England, with a population of around 10,000. It is in Somerset in the south-west of the country. The city is dominated by the magnificent Gothic cathedral and is famous for its remarkably intact ecclesiastical quarter. This area contains the Bishop's Palace – the seat of the Bishop of Bath and Wells – and the Vicar's Close, a medieval street purported to be the oldest continuously-inhabited street in Europe. The city takes its name from the natural wells found in the Cathedral grounds, which feed the moat and ponds around the Bishop's Palace. The majority of the Edgar Wright comedy Hot Fuzz was filmed in and around Wells.

The city is so small that unless you have a medical condition you should have no trouble walking everywhere. If you would like there are taxis but these would only be useful making forays into the countryside (beautiful, by the way) or to nearby Cheddar, but these are accessible by bus, as well. Taxis in Somerset are expensive, even more so than in most large cities.
