Blairgowrie & Rattray is a town in Perth and Kinross, 16 miles north of Perth, with a population of 9260 in 2021. Blairgowrie is the larger settlement, southwest of the River Ericht, and Rattray is northeast. They were combined in 1928 and are locally referred to as "Blair" which is the Scottish Gaelic word for a plain or open meadow. They grew up as small market towns at the meeting point of historic routes, including one of General Wade's military roads. They're best known for their raspberries and strawberries; they have a huge demand for casual labour to pick the fruit in early summer, which they struggle to recruit now that EU residents can no longer be hired.

By train head to  Perth which has frequent trains from all the major Scottish cities. Birnam and Dunkeld station is closer but lacks onward public transport, and there's a stiff hill if you cycle it.
Stagecoach Bus 57 runs every 30 min from Perth via Scone (for the Palace), Kinrossie and Coupar Angus to Blairgowrie (50 min), and continues hourly to Rattray, Alyth, Meigle, Muirhead, Lochee and Dundee. Bus 59 also plies hourly from Dundee to Blairgowrie (55 min) so that route is served every 30 min.
Bus 60 from Dunkeld is just a school bus twice M-F.
Bus 71 is similar, from Blairgowrie three times M-Sa up the valley through Bridge of Cally to Kirkmichael and Tarvie. It doesn't reach the Glenshee ski area.

Get around[edit]
You can walk around town, but Bus 63 orbits Blairgowrie and Rattray every 30-60 min. You need your own wheel for outlying sights.

See[edit]
River Ericht divides Blairgowrie from Rattray. It descends steeply, so its flow was harnessed for a series of textile mills, processing flax for linen, then jute, then rayon. They're all derelict now but a bosky riverside walk leads past them. A suggested route from the bridge is upstream on the west bank past "Cargill's Leap" then returning on the east bank.
56.579-3.3691 Ardblair Stone Circle has been bisected by B947, so it just looks like a barrier to prevent the illegal parking of Druids. Only if you happen to be going that way.
56.623-3.2322 Alyth five miles northeast of Blairgowrie was on the old cattle-drovers' route, crossing the river by the 17th century Packhorse Bridge. It later had textile mills driven by the river. Alyth Museum is on Commercial St, open F noon-4PM, Sa Su 10AM-4PM. The Alyth Arches were part of a church dating back to 6th century; the nearby Gothic parish church of 1839 dominates the skyline.
56.588-3.1633 Meigle Sculptured Stone Museum is east on A94, see Forfar.
56.814-3.4594 Spittal of Glenshee is the last tiny settlement on A93 before the road climbs Devil's Elbow and the bleak moors of Cairnwell, to reach Glenshee ski centre at the top then descend into Braemar. The name indicates "hospital", a refuge as night and the weather closed in. There's an ancient megalith by the Spittal parish church, and a stone circle nearby.
56.671-3.2225 Glen Isla is the most western of the five Angus Glens. It starts above Bridge of Craigisla, where there's a 24-m waterfall, the Reekie Linn. The B951 climbs the valley through Kirkton of Glenisla and Brewlands Bridge to Forter Castle, a 16th century tower house that's now a private dwelling. The B951 here crosses the ridge west to join Glenshee. A dead-end lane continues north in the glen to Auchavan, where trails lead up to the glacial Corrie Fee.
Beavers became re-established on Tayside by 2006 and are thriving, so look out for them on any loch or river hereabouts.

Glenshee ski area is 25 miles north on A93, see Braemar. You can tell when conditions have been good as hordes of wind-reddened skiers emerge from vehicles to re-fuel on fish & chips before heading home to the cities - Blairgowrie & Rattray is the first place of any size on their road south.
