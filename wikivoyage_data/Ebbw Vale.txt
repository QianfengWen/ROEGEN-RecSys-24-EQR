Ebbw Vale town centre

Understand[edit]
Ebbw Vale is a town in Blaenau Gwent, South Wales at the head of the valley formed by the Ebbw Fawr tributary of the Ebbw River, South Wales.
It was a small community that was completely transformed during the Industrial Revolution. This is due to the opening of Ebbw Vale Steelworks and of various coal mines in the area, none of which are still open today. Ebbw Vale is known for its innovative contributions to Britain's development, though the Steelworks and Coal mines have since stopped production. Because of the decline in steel and coal production, Ebbw Vale has one of the highest rates of unemployment in the United Kingdom.
