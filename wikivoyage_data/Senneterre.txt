Senneterre (population 2950, as of 2011) is a small forestry town in Quebec's Abitibi-Témiscamingue region.


Understand[edit]

Established on the Bell River in 1919, Senneterre is 60 km (37 mi) northeast of Val-d'Or. It is the third-largest incorporated municipality in Québec (by area), covering 14,887 km², which means that it is larger than Montenegro. Most of that space is covered by forest. There are cycling and snowmobile trails; hunting and fishing outfitters use the town as a point of departure.
The town centre is at the intersection of the Canadian National Railway and Quebec Route 113. This town centre is mainly surrounded by Parent Lake and Tiblemont Lake.
The economy of this city is mainly based on wood exploitation.

History[edit]
While the site first served as a trading post, colonization began in 1904 when the first permanent settlers arrived. It was first identified as Rivière-Nottaway, then Rivière-Bell. Over the next 10 years, there were only a few residents who were joined by people fleeing conscription. Between 1911 and 1913 when the National Transcontinental Railway was being constructed, the area was surveyed and the geographic township of Senneterre was formed, named in honour of a captain of the Languedoc Regiment that fought in the Battle of Sainte-Foy.
The completion of the railway accelerated the development of the place. In 1914, the Parish of Saint-Paul-de-Senneterre was founded. It developed into a center for forestry, commerce and tourism.
In 1948, it shortened its name to Senneterre. In 1953, CFS Senneterre opened, home to the No. 34 Aircraft Control & Warning Squadron and part of the Pinetree Line chain of radar stations. After the closure of CFS Val-d'Or in 1976, the base also served as the search and rescue centre for north-western Quebec. In 1988, CFS Senneterre was closed.
