Bisbee is a town in Southeast Arizona, and the county seat for Cochise County. This former mining town has reinvented itself as an artist community, and it now attracts tourists for its vibrant cultural scene and well-preserved architecture. Notable are its many Victorian-era houses built into the hillsides, some of which can only be accessed by foot.


Understand[edit]
Bisbee was established in 1880 as a mining town, and named after Judge DeWitt Bisbee who was a financial backer of the Copper Queen Mine. Mining operations ceased in 1974.
