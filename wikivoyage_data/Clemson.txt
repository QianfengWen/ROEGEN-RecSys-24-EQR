Clemson is a college town in Pickens County, in Upcountry South Carolina.


Understand[edit]
Although there are nearly 20,000 permanent residents, people who visit are typically students, family of students or college football fans. The busiest time of the year is typically on Saturdays of Clemson Tigers football home games (September–November). In 2015, the Princeton Review named Clemson as the #1 college town in the United States when it came to the relationship between college students and full-time residents. While it is a smaller town, there are numerous restaurants, shops and activities.

By bus[edit]
Clemson Area Transit, sponsored by the City of Clemson and Clemson University, this bus line is not only fare-free, it also does not generally suffer from many of the problems that plague larger city bus systems (schedule delays, sketchy clientele, dirty buses, etc.) For this reason, the CAT bus system is one of the best public transit systems in the entire nation. Several larger cities have come to Clemson to observe the system, which even carries many university students and well-to-do professors to class. Clemson Area Transit covers many major destinations, including most of the area's hotels, motels, and most major eateries. For the traveler on a budget, or even those not on a tight budget, the CAT bus system may be the way to go. It covers the campus and surrounding cities, including Anderson, Central, Pendleton and Seneca. Travelers on the CAT bus going to Anderson can, upon transfer, obtain a fare-free day pass to the Electric City Transit system which serves the city of Anderson.

By car[edit]
