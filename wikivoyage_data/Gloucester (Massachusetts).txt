Gloucester is a city in Massachusetts. One of the country's oldest settlements, established in 1623, it serves as America's oldest seaport.  Although the sea is contributing less to the city's economy, Gloucester is still a true New England fishing center as immortalized in the movie The Perfect Storm. Rocky Neck, the longest continually operating art colony in North America, is also in Gloucester. With a population of about 30k, this is the only real "city" you'll find on Cape Ann.

Gloucester is America's oldest seaport.  Established in 1623, the city's roots are tied to the sea.

The Cape Ann Museum has the largest collection of Fitz Henry Lane paintings in the country, Hammond Castle, built by John Hayes Hammond, the father of remote control, Beauport, built by Henry Sleeper and a National Historic Landmark, the Sargent House, home of Judith Singer Sargent, one of the country's first feminists and the Gloucester Maritime Heritage Center, telling the story of the fishing industry and featuring the oldest continuously working railways in the country.

Events[edit]
 St. Peter's Fiesta: Last weekend in June annually.  This five-day festival began in 1927 and is organized by the Italian American community in Gloucester. It honors St. Peter, the patron saint of fisherman, and locals come out to pay their respects and pray for the safe return of all fishermen. The Fiesta features all the carnival rides, street performers and food stalls you'd expect from any classic summer festival. The real highlight, however; is the Greasy Pole contest. An idea imported from Sicily, a 45 foot pole is suspended over the ocean, and slathered in all manner of greasy, slippery substances imaginable. A flag is attached to the end, then contestants try to walk across. Whoever grabs the flag first is declared the winner for that day. Winners don't get much, outside of bragging rights and free drinks for the night. Yes, alcohol is involved, injuries occur, and the Coast Guard is on hand for safety. The contest runs daily throughout the festival with Sunday being considered the championship round.  
Buy[edit]
The main downtown area of Gloucester holds a number of local shops and restaurants for many tastes. Although the downtown area has lost the department stores it used to have, many new shops and eateries have opened.  The area is a pleasant walk around, and it's easy to drop in and visit shops for Souvenirs, such as the Weathervane and the House of the Raven.  The area is changing daily, into a more tourist friendly venue for visitors attracted to a still operational fishing port.  Although the city has suffered from the loss of the fishing industry, residents have moved towards recognizing other avenues that the city can survive economically, including tourism, while still maintaining the active fishing community.  The main street area has begun sprouting condos downtown, and a new retail spot has arisen in the former Browns Mall, where the Green Life Natural Living Store, and a kitchen specialty store are new additions to the retail scene.  There is a sporting goods store called Palazolas, as well as a few bookshops, and antiques stores.
