GO Transit provides commuter rail and bus service to Brampton. 
There are three GO train stations in Brampton: Bramalea, which serves the eastern end of Brampton; Brampton station, which serves central Brampton; and Mount Pleasant, which serves the western end of Brampton. 

The Kitchener route operates trips most of the day from Monday to Friday between Toronto and Brampton including stops in Mississauga. On those days, trips travel between Toronto and Kitchener including stops in Mississauga (Malton), Brampton, Georgetown, Acton, and Guelph mostly toward Toronto in the morning rush and toward Kitchener in the afternoon rush, but with a few extra round trip runs during the day and evening. The trip by train from Toronto Union Station takes 35 minutes.
When GO trains are not running, they are replaced by GO buses serving the same area, however these buses generally run to and from Yorkdale and York Mills subway stations to the north of downtown Toronto instead of Union Station. Trains and buses run about every 20 minutes during rush hour and about every hour outside of rush hour.

Downtown heritage structures[edit]

Because of the presence of many modern buildings, Brampton's downtown does not quite have the quaint heritage image of towns such as Newmarket, Port Hope or Brockville.

Many of the buildings listed here are not open to the general public, but all can be viewed from a public sidewalk.
