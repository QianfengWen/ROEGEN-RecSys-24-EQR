Vík í Mýrdal, also known as Vík, is a village in South Iceland. The area is dominated by Mýrdalsjökull, the glacier which is home to Katla, one of Iceland's fiercest volcanoes.  It's about half way along the south coast, the largest settlement in the surrounding area and it's one of the few villages on the sandy beach that makes up most of the south coast of Iceland.


Understand[edit]
Vík is a very small village, with about 300 inhabitants.
The village and the surrounding countryside are in constant danger of floods that might result from a potential volcanic eruption, which has been expected for many years now.
On the other side of the village lies the Atlantic Ocean which is treacherous in these parts, waves can be big and small boats easily get swallowed up if the crews are not experienced enough. While there is no reason to worry about the volcano if you're a tourist, you should be very careful going into the ocean —  there have been cases of tourists drowning when caught by waves on the beach near Vík.

Vík is absolutely tiny (1.5 km/1 mi at its widest point), so walking around the village is easy. For the many amazing sites in the surrounding area, however, it's a good idea to have a well-equipped car, preferably with four-wheel drive, because many of the interesting sights are only accessible via gravel tracks. Alternatively, most hotels can help arrange transportation to many of the popular sites around the area.

63.415568-19.0008381 Black Sand Beach (Reynisfjara) (walk south from Vík towards the shore). The Black Sand Beach is famous with its basalt stacks and black lava sands. Here you can also admire the impressive Reynisdrangar rock formations and view the Dýrhólaey peninsula not far away. For those that are into bird watching, they can see the puffins nesting in the mountain in the summer. This beach is perhaps the most dangerous in Iceland and there have been many fatalities caused by "sneaker waves" (waves that sweep in much further into the beach than onlookers would expect) sweeping people out to sea.

Turf houses have a door as an entrance and occassionally windows, with a small ventilation hole in the roof. It is not safe to enter the turf houses though. (updated Jan 2024)
