Stellenbosch (pop. about 100,000) is a city in the Western Cape, and is the heart of the Cape Winelands, South Africa's prime wine region. Its historical parts display colonial Dutch architecture.


Understand[edit]

Stellenbosch (founded in 1679) is about 50 km east of Cape Town and is the second oldest town in South Africa. It was named (like Simon's Town) after the former Governor Simon van der Stel. The town is situated on the banks of the Eerste River ('First River') and has some fine examples of Cape Dutch architecture. It is also known as 'Eikestad' ('Oak City') because of its oak tree lined streets. Wines from the Stellenbosch region are known internationally and rank among the best in the world. Stellenbosch is also home to one of the country's oldest established universities with over 25,000 students. There is a bustling night life during the university term-time, with many night clubs catering for young people.

Get in[edit]
By bus[edit]
A van service runs from hostels in Cape Town to Stellenbosch for about R120/pp, depending on how many passengers there are (just one and it's R200). The main bus companies also go to Stellenbosch.

By train[edit]
MetroRail[dead link] operates a regular train service to Stellenbosch from Cape Town via Bellville. Check the schedule, as trains do not run very often. It is also advisable to travel in groups and avoid busy travel times in the morning and evening on weekdays.

-33.92374618.8543072 Du Toit railway station, Porter Rd (In the northern parts of the city). (updated Dec 2020)
By plane[edit]
Stellenbosch has its own airfield but the nearest international airport is near Cape Town. Cape Town International airport is about 35 minutes away by car and airport shuttle service is available.  Most hotels and guest houses will arrange transfers on request: expect to pay R400-500 for up to four people.

By car[edit]
Stellenbosch lies approximately 60km from Cape Town. Drive on either the N1 or N2 highway.
If on the N1, exit at the R304 towards Stellenbosch.
If on the N2, exit at the R310 (Baden Powell Drive) and follow the signs.
The N1 is generally considered to be the safer route, particularly at night.

Get around[edit]

Stellenbosch is small enough that the entire city centre can easily be covered on foot. The Tourism Bureau also has a few cycles to rent. A curiosity is that there are no street signs. If you look closely you will see that the street names are indicated in yellow (in Afrikaans) on the edge of the sidewalks.
Stellenbosch is not safe at night, do not walk around, get an uber as you will get mugged. There is no need to take taxis for safety - although if you want to eat (and drink) at one of the outlying wine estates, you'll have to.

Go next[edit]
Visit the nearby vineyards of the Cape Winelands. Maps, information on vineyards that receive and accommodate visitors and advice on getting to them is all available from the very helpful people at the Tourism and Information Bureau [formerly dead link] . There are many companies and individuals offering organised and customised tours - or more simply and cheaply, you can take the Vine Hopper minibus which picks up anywhere in central Stellenbosch and takes circular routes around 12 local vineyards (6 each on alternate days).  Get off the bus where you want, stay as long as you want, and get on a later bus to take you to the next vineyard or - if you've had enough daytime drinking - back to Stellenbosch.  Tickets for the Vine Hopper cost R300 and are available from the Tourism and Information Bureau or the larger hotels.   Other activities available in the area include whitewater rafting and tour organizers can also be found at the Bureau.
