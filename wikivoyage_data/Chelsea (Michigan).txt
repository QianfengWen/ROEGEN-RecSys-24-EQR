Chelsea is a city of 4,944 people (according to the 2010 census) in Washtenaw County.


Understand[edit]
Chelsea's big claim to fame is local-boy-turned-famous-actor/writer/director Jeff Daniels, a proud Michigander who still lives in town between engagements, and who tends to showcase Michigan in his films (Escanaba in da Moonlight is set in the Upper Peninsula (UP), and Super Sucker in the fictional town of Johnson City). Daniels is also a strong supporter of local arts, and founded the Purple Rose Theatre Company as a way to feature Midwestern actors, directors, designers and playwrights. The other big name in town is the Chelsea Milling Company, home of Jiffy Mix, one of the first instant baking mixes and still a popular brand nationwide.
If you're not thrilled by movie actors or fluffy biscuits, then you can always stroll around the charming downtown area, with its quaint homes, fun shopping, and locally-famous restaurant The Common Grill, which has published two cookbooks that you'll be able to find in local bookstores.
