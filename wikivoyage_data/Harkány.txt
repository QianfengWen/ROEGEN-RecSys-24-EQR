Understand[edit]
There are archeological evidence in the environs have revealed finds from the Hunnish, Avar and Roman ages. Written sources first mention it in 1323 with the name "Harkan". The origin of the name can be traced back to the Hungarian bird name "harkály" (woodpecker) on the one hand, and to the old Hungarian dignitary name "horka" on the other. One of the first owner was, Pálffy György, the lieutenant general of Temesvár, the Gara-family. Later proprietors of the castle of Siklós were: the Batthányi-family and the Benyovszki-family. It was an inhabited area under the Turkish occupation of Hungary. Beside the Hungarian population German, Croatian, Serbian and Slovakian families have been settled here since the middle of the previous century.
The curative effect of the water of Harkany was discovered in 1823 completely accidentally. The first two wells were bored by Vilmos Zsigmond in 1866 and in 1887. The first pool was opened in 1925. It is medically proven that the water and mud lends itself particularly well to the medication of rheumatic illnesses. Drinking cure is a potent remedy of catarrhal ailments.
