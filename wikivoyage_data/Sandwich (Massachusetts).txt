Get in[edit]
Looking west on Main Street
By car[edit]
Sandwich, is a little more than an hour and a quarter from both Boston and Providence.

From Boston take I-93 south to Route 3 south to the Sagamore Bridge. (Becomes Rt. 6). After the crossing Sagamore Bridge any of the first 3 exits off Route 6 leads into Sandwich.
From Providence or points south take I-95 north to I-195 to Route 25 south to the Bourne Bridge (I-495 also becomes Route 25). At the rotary (traffic circle) on the Cape side of the bridge go almost all the way around and travel along the Canal to Route 6. Any of the first 3 exits off Route 6 leads into Sandwich. Rather than taking Route 6, you can continue straight under the Sagamore bridge on Route 6A into town.
