Hundested is a city of 8,500 people (2022) in the far north western corner of North Zealand in Denmark. 


Understand[edit]
For many years the city blossomed as an important harbour with ferry connections across the Isefjord and more importantly to Grenå in Jutland. With the demise of the ferry to Jutland in 1996, the commotion of the once lively harbour has withered away for much of the year, but there are still traces of it during the height of summer, when vacationers flock to the ferry to carry them to the many vacations homes on the Odsherred peninsular.

Get in[edit]
Hundested Rørvig ferry
There is train from Hillerød (1 hour) once or twice an hour , with an extra express train running between 06:00 and 17:00 There are good connections with the S-train system in Hillerød, with departures and arrivals timed with those of the S-train. If in a car, just follow route 16 (Hillerødmotorvejen) all the way from Copenhagen, though be mindful that route 16 breaks from the highway just east of Hillerød (Frederiksværk exit).
The ferry [1] across the Isefjord to Rørvig takes 20 minutes, service is scaled back considerably (06:00-18:00) outside the busy summer season. There is also a ferry from the small hamlet Sølvager south-east of the city to Kulhuse on Hornsherred. At a mere 8 minutes, it claims to be the shortest ferry crossing in the country.
