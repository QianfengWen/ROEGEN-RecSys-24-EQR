The museum houses a number of Nordic Bronze Age and Iron Age artefacts relating to the island and has a Mjolnir, discovered in Bornholm but now housed in the National Museum of Denmark. It also has a notable collection of Roman coins, pottery and paintings. 
The Rønne Lighthouse, a slender white-painted octagonal tower in cast iron, stands on the waterfront not far from the church. Constructed in 1880, it was decommissioned in 1989.
Skt. Nicolaj Kirke (St Nicolas's Church), with its distinctive tower, is part of the Diocese of Copenhagen and in its present form was enlarged and fully refurbished in 1918. It stands on the site of an earlier church or chapel from the 13th century of which some sections can still be seen.
Store Torv, the central square, was used for military parades.
Several notable buildings lie in the heart of the town, including the Rønne Public Library, the Nordeabank and old merchant/noble warehouses and residences.  The neo-classical Kommandantgården was built in 1846 and now a ceramics museum. The Amtmandsgårde is located at Storegade 36.
The Toldboden is a merchant warehouse, built in 1624, and is one of Rønne's oldest half-timbered buildings. The Torhus building, at the side of the square, was built in 1834 and is the former town hall, courthouse and jail.
Rønne Theatre built in 1823 is Denmark's oldest provincial theatre still in active use.
