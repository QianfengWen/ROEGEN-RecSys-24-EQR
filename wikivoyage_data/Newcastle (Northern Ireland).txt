For other places with the same name, see Newcastle (disambiguation).

Newcastle is a seaside resort in County Down in Northern Ireland. The "new castle" was probably already tumbledown when first documented in 1433 and even its successors are long gone. Newcastle is best known nowadays as the home of Royal County Down Golf Club, and for its beach and wildlife reserve. It had a population of 8,300 in 2021 and has lots of visitor amenities, so it's a good base for exploring the Mourne Mountains, which rise to the south.

Finnis Souterrain a mile north of the dolmen is a 100-foot underground passage from the 9th century. It doesn't appear to have been used for burials or religious rituals so maybe it was just a hideout. The entrance was created in the 19th century as the original entrance has been lost.
