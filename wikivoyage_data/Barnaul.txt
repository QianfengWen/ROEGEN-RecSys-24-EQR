Barnaul (Russian: Барнау́л buhr-nuh-OOL) is the capital of Altai Krai.


Understand[edit]
The Building with spire, one of the city's landmarks
The city was founded in the XVIII century as a center of silver and copper mining, and has a population of over 600,000.

History[edit]
The house of merchants Yakovlev and Polyakov
The foundation year of the city is unknown and is either 1730 or 1739. The name of founding father is Akinfey Demidov, a Russian mine-owner who started copper extraction and melting in the region. Later on his business spread to the gold and silver and the family reached all-Russian scale. The city became a fort and built a dam. This activity was major for centuries to come. Except that, nature and geography explorers never abandoned this Siberian place. Pyotr Petrovich Semyonov-Tyan-Shansky  and Alexander von Humboldt lead their expeditions across the city.

Architecture[edit]
Pokrovsky Cathedral interior decorated with oil paintings
53.32963383.7744172 Pokrovsky Orthodox Cathedral, Nikitin St. 137. From the 1940s the seat of the Barnaul diocese, the cathedral is a magnificent example of neo-byzantine architecture in Barnaul constructed between 1898 and 1903. It is a listed cultural heritage building. Interestingly, the cathedral was funded by private donations, and the poorest settlement on the then western outskirts of Barnaul was chosen as its location. The iconic red brick cathedral replaced the wooden Church of Intercession which had existed at the location since 1863. The interior of the cathedral is decorated by classic artists including M. V. Nesterov, V. M. Vasnetsov, and I. N. Kramskoy who painted directly with oil paints on dry plaster between 1918 and 1928. Under Soviet rule the cathedral was closed in 1939 and the bell tower and dome subsequently demolished, after which the building was turned into a warehouse. By 1943 it was one of the only surviving religious buildings in the city, which aided its promotion to cathedral status. In the late 1940s restoration of the cathedral began, to be completed in 1993 with the reconstruction of the bell tower.  (updated Jul 2019)
