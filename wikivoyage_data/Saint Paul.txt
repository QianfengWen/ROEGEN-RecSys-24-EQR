Minnesota State Capitol
Saint Paul (or St. Paul) is the capital city and the second largest city of the US state of Minnesota. Along with the slightly larger Minneapolis it forms the urban core of the Twin Cities region, the third largest metropolis in the Midwest.


Understand[edit]
Geography[edit]
Saint Paul is in the Upper Midwest along the Mississippi River, just east and downstream of its sister city Minneapolis. Its location near the head of navigation on the Mississippi River led to its historical development as a transportation hub for freight from the west and to the east and south.  The geologically recent Mississippi River is a prominent feature of the landscape, traversing the city from the upscale riverside homes in Highland Park to the undevelopable floodlands near the junction with the Minnesota River, through the historic downtown riverboat landings and railroad infrastructure, the Mississippi River is the defining feature of Saint Paul.

METRO Light Rail. The Green Line runs from downtown Saint Paul to downtown Minneapolis.

Trains run every 10 minutes during much of the day, with service being reduced to every 15 minutes later in the evening, and then just hourly during the overnight hours.
Bus. Bus service in Saint Paul has improved, even if it doesn't quite match up to services in Minneapolis. The 54 runs fairly often between downtown Saint Paul and the airport via West 7th Street. The A Line runs frequently along Snelling Avenue and Ford Parkway.
