Piran (Italian: Pirano) is a city in the Coast and Karst region of Slovenia.


Understand[edit]
Piran is probably the most beautiful of Slovenia's coastal towns, perched on a tiny piece of land jutting into the sea.  It feels more like an Italian coastal town, without all the Italian tourists, and for good reason: Piran was part of the Venetian empire from the late 13th century to the end of the 18th century.

The closest airport is south of Portoroz, 45.47335313.6149781 Portoroz Airport  (POW  IATA), close to the Croatian border. At a distance of ca. 15 km from Piran, it is the smallest of 3 international airports in Slovenia, however, it has few international connections.

There is no train service to Piran. Nearest station is in Koper.

By bus[edit]
Frequent buses connect Piran to Izola,  Koper (20 minutes), and Trieste (1 hour), and there is a free shuttle service to the adjacent resort of Portoroz.  From Ljubljana, there are buses roughly hourly, taking 2-2½ hours for the journey depending on route. Schedules are available online[dead link].
Buses also connect Piran with Bernardin and Lucija every 15 minutes.

By foot[edit]
Piran is very small and it takes 30 minutes to walk from one end to the other.

By bus[edit]
There is a free bus travelling along the coast between Piran and Portoroz, stopping at Bernardin. Closest bus stop is 45.5282413.568071 Tartini Square.

By car[edit]
Cars are generally not allowed in the old town and even when they are it is not a lot of fun since the streets are very narrow and parking costs €24 per day. There is parking available outside the town centre.  The biggest lot is along the waterfront at Fornače, but reserved only for local inhabitants and busses. At Fornače there is also a parking house with the same name, which costs about €17 per day; another isparking house Arze-, which costs €12 per day.  The city provides a free shuttle bus to and from the parking lot Fornače and Tartinijev trg roughly every 15 minutes. See (in Slovene)[dead link]  or (in Italian)[dead link].

Eat[edit]
Piran's coast with colourful buildings, swimming piers and restaurants
Many of Piran's restaurants are found along the waterfront (Prešernovo nabrežje), with open air seating and great views. The food and service is generally good, but many of the restaurants tend to have similar menus (meat, fish, mixed grills, etc.) and similar prices. Restaurants away from the main waterfront area can be a bit cheaper. There are also a number of pizzerias and gelato shops scattered around the town. If you want fresh produce, there is sometimes a market behind the municipal building off Tartinjev trg.

Sleep[edit]
With a shortage of hotel accommodation the best option can be to take a 'private room', (rent out a room in a local's house). Several local tourist agencies keep lists of such rooms and will book them for you. Don't expect the owners to speak English, but they are generally very helpful and are experienced in hospitality. Standards vary: sometimes you'll get towels for a shower, sometimes not. But regardless, it will certainly be an experience and a chance to meet some locals.
