Stay safe[edit]
Driving[edit]
It is advisable for inexperienced country drivers to avoid driving at dusk and dawn to avoid coming into contact with kangaroos who have been spotted crossing roads as close as the edge of town. If you must travel during these high-risk times, drive carefully and enlist your passenger as a "spotter" for wildlife, particularly kangaroos. Even late into the night, Kangaroos can be seen crossing or standing across roads.
If you plan on driving on any non-major roads, it is advisable to bring water in case you break down and need to stay with your car whilst awaiting assistance. Most roads in the central goldfields are well travelled, and someone will come across you within hours at worst. Cell Phone reception is poor once you've left Maryborough until within 25 minutes~ of Ballarat or Bendigo.

Bushfires[edit]
During bushfire season (December - February) check the bushfire danger rating daily on the CFA Website. 
If the danger rating is extreme, be aware of the names of the towns and regions you plan to travel to throughout the day, and keep tuned to 107.9 FM in the small chance that a fire does break out. Any news broadcasted regarding a new or existing fire will be preceded by an alarm tone, you won't miss it. 
If the danger rating is code red, reconsider your need to travel out of the town. Code red days are only announced once every 10 years or so, and are extremely high risk days for fast moving dangerous bushfires.

Go next[edit]
If you've brought camping gear you could head 20 minutes away towards Avoca, where there are several underappreciated campgrounds with waterfalls and incredible bushwalking tracks.  
Travel to Ballarat for more Goldfields heritage and tourism, including Sovereign Hill.
