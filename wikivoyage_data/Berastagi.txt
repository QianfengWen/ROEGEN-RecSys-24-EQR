A small town in the main road connecting Medan with Karo highland and Lake Toba, it's a popular weekend getaway town for locals from Medan. The town is located in the Barisan mountains (Bukit Barisan), the longest mountain range in Indonesia extending from Aceh to Lampung. With a height of about 1300 meters above sea level, the annual mean level temperature is about 23° C. In the rainy season, fog may occur frequently and wind may get chilly. A light jacket or windbreaker may help. You might check the market for second hand jackets.

Get in[edit]
The nearest airport is Medan's Kuala Namu International Airport. A taxi direct from the airport takes around 3 hours.  Buses also go right from the airport to Kabanjahe via Berastagi (Rp 40,000).
Berastagi is only 67 km from Medan, but the road is often jammed, particularly on weekends, so travel time is often north of two hours. 
Bus Rp20,000 (Mar 2024), duration 1½-2 hr, with Pt. Almasar Indonesia shop (loket), near Citra Garden 2, south of Medan. No bus from Amplas terminal.
Renting a car is expensive, but if you are short of time and plan to continue your journey beyond Berastagi, it's a viable option.  Motorbikes are also available to rent in Berastagi.
While bus can stop in Berastagi mostly on-demand, the nearest bus terminal seems to be Kabanjahe. It can be reached via local yellow minibus written Karya from Berastagi main road, south direction. From there, you can take bus to Medan, Lake Toba, and elsewhere.

Get around[edit]
3°13′6″N 98°30′53″EMap of Berastagi
By public transport[edit]
Buses service many of the surrounding villages as is the case in the rest of Indonesia.  Prices are similar to those elsewhere in Indonesia. You may get to ride on the roof of local minibuses. Many run along the main road all the time. Central market is main stop.

By foot[edit]
Berastagi is a small city and walking around is possible if you stay at the city. You can cover the whole city in less than an hour. Walking to surrounding villages, though, is not recommended.

See[edit]
The tourist info is very helpful. However, booking trips is cheaper with local agencies, for example Losmen Sibayak Guesthouse (in the center, next to BRI bank).

3.2068798.537751 Bukit Barisan National Forest (Taman Hutan Raya Bukit Barisan), Jl. Letdjen Jamin Ginting. Popular among locals for picnicking and camping, especially on weekends. The forest is poorly managed and in poor condition, though. (updated Apr 2018)
3.192398.501342 Gundaling hill (Bukit Gundaling), Jl. Gundaling, Berastagi. A small hill that give panorama view of nearby Sibayak and Sinabung. Sadly, it's packed with many small stalls around. You can take a picture with Sinabung with its volcanic plume as your background on a very clear day. Or you can ride a horse or horse carriage around Gundaling. Skyview at "Jembatan kaca puncak gundaling berastagi" for Rp20,000. (updated Mar 2024)

Do[edit]
Sibayak volcano's south face from Lau Debuk Debuk hot springs
3.22498.514351 Lau Debuk Debuk hot springs (Pemandian air panas Lau Debuk Debuk) (From Berastagi, catch a yellow KT minibus on the main drag, but ask to make sure it's going all the way there. Rp 6k. It's also possible to walk to Lau Debuk Debuk in about two hours, but it's a jungle path that is frequently unmaintained and overgrown. Only go with someone who's been over it recently.). At least some of the pools are open all hours, though minibuses back to Berastagi stop around 19:00. Take a dip in the hot springs on the foot of Gunung Sibayak while enjoying the view of the mountain. Feels so good, especially after having just climbed the volcano. There are so many hot springs around that it may confuse you, but just pick one which is clean. You can purchase a small pack of sulfur powder and rub it in your skin before dip inside. The powder is supposedly very good for skin. In late afternoon the springs become crowded with local families. There are also several hotels in the hot springs town with prices from around Rp 150,000. Entry price varies, around Rp 5,000 - 10,000, and you can stay as long as you like.. (updated May 2018)
3.23916798.5055562 Sibayak (Gunung Sibayak). A climb of Gunung Sibayak is a must. A guide is definitely required unless you are an experienced trekker as the path is very slippery, steep and confusing in some areas. The guides will also probably know many alternative paths to the top depending on the weather and your fitness level or time. There are two common starting points - Pertamina power plant at Lau Debuk Debuk (Semangat Gunung village) from the south east or pos Lestari from the west. Easiest route is from pos Lestari as it starts from attitude about 1000 meters and 1-1½ hours to the crater. The climb will go through forest trail about 15-30 minutes before changing to rocky path all the way to crater rim. Possibility to get lost on this route is very low as the path is very well defined. The more adventurous route is from the Pertamina power plant. The trail involves forest trail, which is very slippery and many branches exist that you may get lost, especially if you climb at night. After the forest trail about 2-3 hours, you will emerge in the rocky trail for final push to crater rim that takes about 1 hour. This route is more rewarding as you can get a splendid view of Berastagi town and Lau Debuk Debuk valley from the rocky section. In a very clear morning day, you even can see all the way to Lake Toba. The crater is filled with rocks that tourists have inevitably made into all sorts of shapes and words. On rainy season, the crater may be filled with water to form a volcanic lake. If you love camping, the area around crater rim are splendid spot to pitch a tent. Beware of the strong wind and very chilly night! There are three summit if you dare to climb them - Puncak Antena, Takal Kuda and Pintau. Puncak Antena is the lowest summit of all three and so called because of the government seismic monitoring built at here. If you climb from Pertamina, your climb will emerge on the ridge connecting to Puncak Antena on your right. Takal Kuda is the second highest summit and the most believed highest summit by locals. Takal Kuda means "head of horse" in local language and it's easily recognized by a single tall granite on the top. The highest and true summit is Pintau, which can't be seen from crater and rarely climbed and even known by locals. It is located just behind Takal Kuda and to see it, you have to climb Takal Kuda or Puncak Antena. It is not recommended to climb Pintau unless you are a very experienced climber, as the route is very treacherous.   (updated May 2018)
3.1798.3919443 Sinabung (Gunung Sinabung). You can also climb Gunung Sinabung. The easiest way is to take a minibus to Danau Kawar (a lake at the foot of the volcano) and then hike up (you should ask for directions as the beginning is not obvious). After the initial pass through the farms the path is impossible to miss (although the usual stories about lost/dead tourists exist and are listed at the tourist information office in Berastagi), so no guide should be necessary. Good views from the top and excellent walk through the jungle (the walk up to Sibayak is not quite so pleasant). As of April 2018, Gunung Sinabung still on high alert status due to eruptions. The area around Gunung Sinabung (including Danau Kawar) may be a no-man zone. Consult with local authority before heading to there.   (updated Apr 2018)
There are several waterfalls around, some can be reached with car/motorcycle, but some required trekking for several hours.

3.27598898.536474 Two Colors waterfall (Air Terjun Dua Warna). This waterfall's source origin from Gunung Sibayak and to reach it will need long trekking through rainforest. Guide is necessary. Start point trekking usually is from Sibolangit camp, but several other routes exist. The waterfall is uninspiring, but the trekking is quite adventurous. (updated Apr 2018)
If you bring kids, you may want to visit the theme parks.

Eat[edit]
Chinese restaurants in the main street have some good eating options and hot food.
Food tents are set up along the side of the main street after dark. Many types of Indonesian foods are available, like 'Ikan Bakar' (Grilled Fish).  They also sell a spicy tea called Bandrek, which is perfect on a cold mountain evening.  Best with milk (Bandrek susu).
There are now several cafes along the main street.  Ask to try the local coffee.  Sumatra coffee is world class, and Karoland coffee, though not yet famous, is as good as it gets.
Samudera Bakery on the main street has nice bread.
For an adventure try the local specialty called babi panggang karo or BPK (grilled pork served with spicy pig blood and cooked cassava leaves), saksang (pork/beef/dog meat in a special sauce) or ikan mas arsik (sauteed goldfish with spices).

Very good quality coffee is grown in these highlands, though it's not yet well known outside of local cognoscenti.  Ask for it!

Go next[edit]
Medan
Lake Toba
Public transport to Lake Toba/Parapat is possible but involves 3 minivan changes and takes around 5 hours. Easier to charter a taxi/minivan from the guesthouse and get there in 4 hours than whole day or Taxi Trans for Rp 500,000 (private van); like tobatransporter@hotmail.com/+6285261492668. You could also stop at the waterfall on the way; Bukit Lawang seems to be best reached via Medan.
For public transport:
Medan:
Frequent ordinary buses to Simpang Kuala/ Simpang Pos on Jln Ginting in Medan are Rp 20,000. From there you can get minibuses into central Medan for around Rp 7,000.
Samosir:
-Walk to the bus station south of the roundabout in central Berastagi and take the next bus headed towards Kabanjahe - 20 min, Rp 5,000 (you can tell the driver you're going to Parapat and this message may be passed along to the other drivers making it slightly easier to communicate).
-In Kabanjahe grab the next bus going to P. Siantar and ask to be dropped off at Sinpong Dua - 3 hours - Rp 25,000
-When dropped off at the Sinpong Dua junction, you'll need to cross the road and walk south a few minutes (just ask any local where the bus stop to Parapat is) Big bus costs Rp 15,000 and takes about an hour - drops you off right near the ferry to Samosir Island/Lake Toba
Total time takes about five hours or so including transfer time and it's best to leave Berastagi by about 10:00 in order to leave plenty of time to catch the ferry to Samosir (as of August 2015).
July 2012:
For transport to Lake Toba (Rp 130,000/person; leaves at 13:30 or 14:00 and arrives in time for last ferry to TukTuk - as of August 2015) , Medan and Bukit Lawang, seats in one of the tourist buses (minivan 5-7 persons; PT Bagus Holiday's Taxi) can be arranged through the local tourist agencies. This is much quicker and easier than public transport and just a little bit more expensive.
