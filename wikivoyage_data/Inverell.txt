Inverell is a large town (population 11,660 in 2016) in the New England region of New South Wales in Australia.


Understand[edit]
Inverell Court House
The indigenous Kamilaroi people are the original inhabitants of the district. A pioneer settler, Alexander Campbell, established his farm 'Inverell Station' on the Macintyre River in 1848. The name Inverell comes from the Scottish Gaelic language and means 'the meeting place of swans'. A store was established in 1853 where the Macintyre River and Swanbrook Creek meet, and the site of the settlement was surveyed in 1858, with land sales beginning not long after. The railway reached Inverell in 1902, however the line closed in 1987. Diamonds were discovered at nearby Copes Creek in 1875 and mined at Copeton from 1883 until 1922. 
The main industries in the Inverell district are the farming of wheat, barley, oats, sorghum, wine grapes, and maize, and the mining of tin, sapphires, zircon, and industrial diamonds. Inverell is known as 'The Sapphire City'. Nearby Copeton Dam is the water supply for Inverell and is a popular destination for water sports.
Inverell is the main centre of the Inverell Shire Council Local Government Area.
