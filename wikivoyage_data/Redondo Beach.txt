Redondo Beach is in the South Bay of Los Angeles County in California.


Understand[edit]
Redondo Beach Chamber of Commerce & Visitors Bureau, 200 N. Pacific Coast Highway, ☏ +1 310-376-6911.
Redondo Beach is the most suburban of the three beaches (Mahattan, Hermosa, Redondo). There are not a lot of touristy things to do, but there's significantly less traffic and people walking around compared to other beaches around Los Angeles. For that reason, Redondo has become slightly more popular for people who frequent the area and just want a hassle-free vacation at a California beach city.

Get around[edit]
See[edit]
 Hopkins Wilderness Park. The park was a Nike radar site during the Cold War. It was the IFC (Integrated Flight Control) radar site for Nike-Ajax LA-57, one of 16 Nike sites that formed a protective ring around Los Angeles from the 1950s to the 1970s.  Now it is home to ducks, turtles, rabbits and other small creatures.  Some finding they way there, others abandoned.  The kiddos will love it, and there are picnic areas scatterred around the park  some near the two ponds. 
33.8397-118.39261 Redondo Beach Pier. The Redondo Beach Pier has been rebuilt and altered by storms and redevelopments. Its official name is "Municipal Pier," and it has also been called the "Endless Pier."  Earlier versions were known as "Pleasure Pier" and "Horseshoe Pier."   
 Riviera Village. In South Redondo Beach up against the Palos Verdes hills. Away from the hustle and crowded feel of Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach. Originally called Hollywood Riviera because so many of Hollywood came there to escape, it now has a more European feel to it. Some great place to grab a bite to eat, or if you want to grab some food and walk to the beach, stop in to Trader Joes. The Village is basically a triangle with the water on the west side, PCH on the east side, and Palos Verdes Drive along the south side. The beaches here are less crowded and parking is pretty easy. You can pay at meters along the Esplanade or drive a few blocks inland and park for free.  Run the steps (all 72 of them) at Avenue C on the Esplanade. The view is impressive and you'll have plenty of company from sun-up to sun-down. Watch dolphins playing in the waves just off shore. 
Do[edit]
On hot dry days in Los Angeles, the beach area has amazingly cool and clean air, and is less crowded than the beaches between Santa Monica and Malibu.
Redondo's King Harbor has many restaurants, a boardwalk with shops and an arcade, and a large pier with great views. Location is at the west end of Torrance Blvd. Plenty of parking, in shade (nice in Summer)
Several miles further south is Riviera Village, a charming little shopping and eating district. As property values have soared in the area, the Village has "Yuppified", but retains its small seaside feel.  Location is along Catalina Avenue and Vista Del Mar streets. Interestingly, only one of these shops has seating outside where one can actually view the ocean. It's at the NW corner of Catalina Avenue and I street.
Between the above 2 locations along the Esplanade (street) offers great ocean views and access to a superb stretch of beach.

Buy[edit]
33.8713-118.3551 South Bay Galleria, 1815 Hawthorne Blvd. Originally opened on fifty acres in 1959, the South Bay Galleria is a large, indoor mall that is today anchored by several national department stores and a 16-screen movie theater. Reflecting the time of its construction, the four story May Company department store actually has a public bomb shelter in its basement, although it is not accessible to visitors.   
Eat[edit]
 Rinaldi's, 308 Ave I, ☏ +1 310-375-2443. An Italian deli that makes you think twice about what goes into the perfect sandwich. There are so many options that it may lead to an obsessive urge to include everything. If you can't decide on one after five minutes then just ask for the "Shack Attack." 
 Yellow Vase Cafe, 1805 S Catalina Ave, ☏ +1 310-373-0013. Get a latte, or a great lunch, and flowers for your honey all at the same time. Quite stylish with great owners. 
 Creme de la Crepe, 1708 S Catalina Ave (in Riviera Village), ☏ +1 310-540-8811. Everything French. Book ahead because it's a small place with fantastic food. 
 El Torrito, 100 Fishermans Wharf (on the Redondo Beach Pier), ☏ +1 310-376-0547. An awesome Mexican restaurant that not only offers great drinks and food, but also has a fantastic ocean view in parts of the restaurant. 
 Rice Things, 2401 Artesia Blvd #105 (North Redondo Beach), ☏ +1 310-214-9033. Excellent sushi for the cheapest price in the South Bay. Try the combination sushi dinners for $10. 
 Old Tony's, 210 Fisherman's Wharf, ☏ +1 310-374-1442. This is a classic restaurant with amazing seafood (try the salmon chowder & any salad with the "house" dressing) and a spectacular view (you're literally sitting right over the ocean). Their "Firechief" Mai Tai lives up to its name, created by Tony back in the 1950s. You get to keep the custom glass its served in. Ascend up the spiral staircase and gaze at the signed portraits of stars who have visited, and you will have arrived at the Top o' Tony's, a unique hexagon bar that's a fun place to watch the sunset and listen to some great guitar. 
 El Burrito Jr. (LBJ's), 919 S Pacific Coast Hwy, ☏ +1 310-316-5058. 8AM–11PM. The local cheap Mexican place. El Burrito Jr started out of this shack and their business has prospered so much that they've expanded into other locations around the South Bay, but this location is still the best. Order a "Special C," and you'll get two bean and cheese burritos for $6. Really anything on the menu is a safe bet. It's cash-only, but they have an ATM on site. (updated Oct 2016)
 The Standing Room, 144 N Catalina Ave, ☏ +1 310-374-7545. Tu-Su 11AM-9:30PM, M 11AM-8PM. Good burgers inside a corner store. $15. (updated Apr 2023)
Drink[edit]
