One of many industrial parks in Gomez Palacios
Gómez Palacio is the second-largest city in Durango, Mexico with a population over 300,000 people. The city is located in the northeastern part of the state. It is an urbanized industrial area and a suburb of Torreón, Coahuila. The metropolitan area is referred to as Comarca Lagunera, it consists of the cities Gomez Palacio, Torreon, and Lerdo and has a combined population over 1.2 million and is the 8th largest metropolitan area in Mexico.


Understand[edit]
Pancho Villa
The city's history revolves mostly around industry and revolution.
Soap was the city's first big industry, with Comarca Lagunera building its first factory in the city in 1892. With it came mills for producing oil from cotton seed. Then came textile mills. Later it would be explosives factories. Today, it's almost any product imaginable as several foreign corporations have established maquiladoras in Gomez Palacio and nearby Lerdo. 
Gomez Palacio has 9 bridges that cross the Nazas River connecting it with Torreón. The oldest is the Silver Bridge at the end of Av. Miguel Aleman. The bridge was built in 1932 but has a cannon aimed across it that's even older --- the cannon marks the position of General Felipe Angeles in 1913, during the revolution, when the Division of the North attacked the city of Torreón.
While Gral. Angeles was down by the river, General Francisco "Pancho" Villa was up on a hill a mile or so away from the river, aiming his cannons to bombard Torreon...
