Put-in-Bay is a resort village 3 mi (4.8 km) offshore of mainland Ohio on Lake Erie.  Put-in-Bay is a village on South Bass Island, but the name commonly is used to refer to the entire island.  A summer resort since the mid-1800s, the town is the hub of tourism among the Lake Erie Islands, with its numerous taverns, wineries, restaurants, and hotels.  Along with the festive atmosphere of downtown Put-in-Bay, there are key pieces of American history to discover here, relaxing outdoor activities, and natural splendor.  This island resort community is also close to a plethora of mainland parks and attractions, including the world-renowned Cedar Point amusement park in Sandusky.

Understand[edit]
The primary industry of Put-in-Bay is tourism. The tourist season runs roughly between April and October. 
There are approximately 500 full-time South Bass Island residents, most of whom remain on the island over the winter. Supplies and perishables are flown to the island during the winter months along with the mail, parcels and bank employees who staff the island's only bank (for one day a week) until the spring. The island has a single school that is used for all classes – grades kindergarten through 12 – and also serves the educational requirements of the residents of nearby Middle Bass and North Bass islands.

Get around[edit]
Visitors should seriously consider leaving their cars on the mainland. It is so much easier and more convenient to travel around the island with a golf cart, by bicycle, or by moped, which are available for rental at several locations on the island. Put-in-Bay Golf Carts are available with 2-, 4-, 6-, and 8-passenger configurations. Taxis and old-school buses meet the Miller Boat Line ferries, which dock at the old Lime Kiln dock on the south side of the island.  The taxis and buses take travelers approximately 2 miles to Put-in-Bay, past the airport, for a small fee.
Cars are permitted on island roads, although speed limits are low and parking is very limited.  From mid-March to late-November, you can get your car there from the mainland for $15 one-way on the Miller Boat Line (see listing above), located at the end of Route 53 on Catawba Island.  Each person traveling with the vehicle also pays the normal fare of $7 per person one-way.  Reservations are not required, even on weekends, and vehicles are taken on a first-come, first-served basis. Besides cars, they also take motorcycles, trailers, RVs, and other vehicles.  During heavier traffic periods, there can be restrictions on bringing your vehicle to or from Put-in-Bay.
