Imatra (population ca. 30,000) is an industrial town in South Karelia. It is dominated by Lake Saimaa, the River Vuoksi and the Finnish-Russian border. Imatra’s over 300-year-old history of busy tourism is greatly attributed to the attraction of the spectacular rapids of the river Vuoksi, which have enticed many illustrious personas to visit the area throughout the ages. Visitors have included such people as Russian Empress Catherine II, Alexander Dumas Senior and Richard Wagner.
The municipality of Ruokolahti, 10 km to the north towards Puumala is also handled in this article.


Understand[edit]

Imatra's rise to prominence can be traced back to the late 19th century when it attracted Russian aristocrats and wealthy visitors who were drawn to its stunning natural beauty. One of the main attractions for these visitors was the Imatrankoski Rapids, which were considered one of the most impressive natural wonders in the region. To accommodate the influx of tourists, the town built several hotels and other amenities, including the Imatran Valtionhotelli, which was completed in 1903 and quickly became one of the most famous hotels in Finland. The hotel's beautiful architecture and breathtaking views of the rapids made it a popular destination for famous guests like Russian Tsar Nicholas II and Finnish President Urho Kekkonen.
However, in the early 20th century, Finland gained independence from Russia, and the flow of Russian tourists to Imatra decreased, leading to a decline in the town's fortunes. Nevertheless, Imatra continued to be a popular destination for domestic tourists and grew and developed in the years that followed.
Today, Imatra is well-known for the Imatrankoski Rapids, which are a series of rapids on the Vuoksi River that flow through the town. The rapids attract both tourists and locals, and the area features several viewing platforms and walking trails. However, a hydroelectric dam was built and, since 1929, the rapids flow freely only at regular shows and on special occasions.
Apart from natural beauty and historic landmarks, Imatra is also a hub for sports and outdoor activities. The town boasts hiking and biking trails, a golf course, and water sports opportunities, making it an ideal destination for those who love the outdoors.

In poetry
Imatra is even mentioned in the Kalevala, the epic poem of Finland (compiled from oral poetry in 1835):
"Three, the water-falls in number,
Three in number, inland oceans,
Three in number, lofty mountains,
Shooting to the vault of heaven.
Hallapyora's near to Yaemen,
Katrakoski in Karyala;
Imatra, the falling water,
Tumbles, roaring, into Wuoksi"
