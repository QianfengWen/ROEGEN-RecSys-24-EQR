Hartland is a small town of about 950 people (2016) in New Brunswick that is famous for having the longest covered bridge in the world.


Understand[edit]
History[edit]

The first European settler in the area of what would become Hartland was William Orser (b.1762) and his son William Jr. William traveled there from New York with his wife and six children.
The town was named Hartland in 1874, to honour James R. Hartley, a surveyor and member of the province's legislature.
The town is best known for being the site of the Hartland Bridge, the longest covered bridge in the world. It opened on July 4, 1901. The bridge was covered as part of major repairs in 1921, and the pedestrian walkway added in 1945.

 Hartland Visitor Information Centre, 365 Main St, ☏ +1 506 375-4075. Mid-May to early Oct. Gift shops, clean toilets, free parking, close to the covered bridge. (updated May 2019)

You can still drive across, or walk across on the sidewalk that was added in 1945. The bridge is now a National Historic Site.   (updated May 2019)




Legends
When the bridge was mostly used by horse and wagon, couples would stop half-way across to share a kiss. The first wedding on the bridge was celebrated in September 1992 between Charmaine Laffoley and Dana Hunt from Toronto. It is thought by some locals to be good luck to hold one's breath the entire way across while driving.
