Tarifa is a small, historic town in the Province of Cadiz, Andalusia, Spain. Tarifa is the southernmost point of mainland Europe and Africa is just 14 km away across the Strait of Gibraltar and is exact point where the Atlantic Ocean meets the Mediterranean Sea.
Tarifa's popularity as a holiday destination has markedly increased in the 2010s, mainly fuelled by its position as Europe's most significant kitesurfing destination.


Understand[edit]
The charming walled Old Town has maintained a distinctive atmosphere and the surrounding area has avoided the worst ravages of the tourist developments which have blighted much of the Spanish coastline. Much of the surrounding coastline is still protected by law and a few kilometres to the west of the town are two of Spain's most beautiful beaches.

Sealife watching[edit]
Seven species of marine mammals can be found in the Strait of Gibraltar.

In Tarifa, various providers offer observation trips from the end of March to the beginning of November. Such trips only take place when the sea is calm.

Tarifa owes its fame to windsurfing. The bay is ideal, with fresh winds from the Atlantic, the so-called Poniente wind, and the warm strong Levante wind from the Mediterranean.
