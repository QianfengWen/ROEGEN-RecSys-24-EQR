Berry is a town in Shoalhaven, NSW.


Get in[edit]
Berry is both on the South Coast Railway Line, and the Princes Highway heading south.  The main road heads right through the centre of town, and it quite a choke point at busy traffic times.  The new bypass is scheduled to open in 2018, and should do a great deal to reduce through traffic in the town centre.

If you're just interested in browsing the antique and craft shops, the town is easily walkable.  Some of the surrounding land and hills are worth a scenic drive.
