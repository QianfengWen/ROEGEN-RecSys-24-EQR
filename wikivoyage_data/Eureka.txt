Eureka is a city in Humboldt County, California. With a population of slightly over 25,000, it is the largest coastal city on the West Coast of the United States north of San Francisco and south of Portland and the center of the California North Coast (Redwood Coast). The timber industry gave the town its early wealth. Now, with logging in decline, it retains the charm of that era with older Victorian buildings and the feel of an old-fashioned working town. 
Situated on the shores of Humboldt Bay, Eureka provides an urban environment in this rugged corner of California with a quaint but lively city center, thriving arts scene, and variety of shopping and dining options without the hectic rush of other major cities in the state. It also serves as the gateway to Redwood National Park and Humboldt Redwoods State Park, which are home to the world's tallest trees.

Stay safe[edit]
Due to its small population, Eureka and the surrounding area are very safe with low crime rates. Normal travel safety precautions should be exercised.
Humboldt County is the center of the U.S. marijuana industry and many illegal operations are in the surrounding rural areas. Some are well-guarded and armed. As a result, while it is unlikely a traveler would encounter one, avoid anything that may seem suspicious when outside the Eureka urban area.
When venturing into the surrounding forest areas and wilderness, stay on marked or well-traveled paths and take extra water and maybe a portable charger with you. Due to the dense vegetation, it is easy to become lost or encounter aggressive wildlife and cell phone reception may be spotty or nonexistent.
