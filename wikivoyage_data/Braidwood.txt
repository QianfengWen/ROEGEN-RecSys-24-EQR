Braidwood is a small and historic town on the road between Canberra and the coast.  It is a service town for nearby cattle and sheep farmers, and for forestry operators.  It does support some Canberra workers who live a country life in return for a longer daily commute.  It also supports a tourist industry, with a few restaurants, pubs, hotels, and choice of accommodation — surrounded by parks and countryside.

Get in[edit]
Braidwood is situated on the western side of the Great Dividing Range in New South Wales. It has no train station but can be reached by car from Canberra via the Kings Highway (approx 1 hour), Batemans Bay or Nowra (60 to 90 minutes drive) or Sydney (approximately 3 hours drive via Goulburn). It is a popular stopping point on trips between Canberra and the Eurobodalla region of New South Wales.
A daily bus service is available to and from Canberra and the nearest train station is at Bungendore, which is located about 50 km to the west of Braidwood.
