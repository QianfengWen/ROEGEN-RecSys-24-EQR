Kalimpong (Nepali: कालिम्पोङ Kālimpoṅ, Bengali: কালিম্পং Kālimpaṁ) is a hill station in the Darjeeling Hills‎ of West Bengal. It has less to see than Darjeeling but is, in comparison, quiet and pleasant to walk around and explore. The town has a number of interesting colonial-era buildings scattered around the town. The climate is ideal for growing a range of plants, particularly flowers and the area has many nurseries. The town is between two hills: Deolo and Durpin Dara, both of which provide views of Mt Kangchenjunga on a clear morning. Deolo provides the most sweeping panoramic views and also has a guesthouse, while Durpin Dara has the Zang Dhok Palri Phodang Monastery.


Understand[edit]
Kalimpong began as a trading post on the Tibet to India route. Then, from early 18th to mid-19th century, the town was successively ruled by the Sikkimese and Bhutanese kingdoms. After the Anglo-Bhutan War in 1864, the Treaty of Sinchula (1865) was signed, in which Bhutanese-held territory east of the Teesta River, which included Kalimpong, was ceded to the British East India Company. After falling under British control, the town was developed as a local administrative centre, and a number of missionary schools opened in the area. 
The town is populated by mostly Nepalese-speaking people, with a large minority of Tibetans. There are several Tibetan Buddhist monasteries, private schools, and colleges scattered throughout the town and surrounding hills. 
At around 1,250 metres, the town enjoys a moderate climate, which attracts people from towns at higher altitude in the winter and from the Plains in the summer.

Buy[edit]
Most of the Tibetan shops are on 10th Mile Rishi Road, and R.C. Mintri Road.
The Haat Bazar (weekly bazzar), just off Relly Road, down the hill from the bus stand, occurs every Wednesday and Saturday and is a vibrant market with mainly clothing and vegetable stands. Food stands serve plates of momo for ₹50 (2023), as well as a delectable local pasta.
Don't hesitate to bargain: you can haggle quite a bit. Or if you are adventurous, just walk a bit more to the wholesale market (just around the corner from the main street). Its fixed price, but you won't get a better deal anywhere else in town.
To buy clothes all you have to do is to visit R.C. Mintri road full of marwadis.  Don't leave Kalimpong without tasting locally made lollipops.

Thangka House on 10th Mile, Rishi Road. This shop sells small souvenirs, and beautiful art such as thangkas and authentic hand paintings. They also have postcards and an assortment of prints for sale, which are cheaper than the hand paintings.
