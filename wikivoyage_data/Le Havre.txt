Le Havre is a port city at the mouth of the Seine, on the English Channel (French: Manche) in the region of Upper Normandy in France. Listed on the World Heritage List for its reconstructed city centre, Le Havre is challenging its reputation as an industrial city. It is a city full of contrasts, which should be explored to discover its particular charm. 


Understand[edit]
Le Havre, originally le Havre de Grâce (Harbour of Grace), was founded in the early 16th century at the mouth of the Seine as the main harbour for Paris. Goods transferred at Le Havre between ocean-going vessels and barges which went to and from Paris via the Seine.
Le Havre was heavily bombed during the Battle of Normandy in 1944. The reconstruction of the town was undertaken by Auguste Perret using reinforced concrete. This project has led to the city being added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.

Get in[edit]
Map of Le Havre
By train[edit]
Trains run from Paris regularly, taking about 2 hours: most stop at Rouen en route. There is also a TGV from Marseille once a day.

By boat[edit]
Ferries run to Portsmouth and Newhaven in southern England daily. This service is provided by LD lines. Crossing times are from 3 hr 15 min[dead link]. Popular alternative routes going to areas close to Le Havre include Newhaven to Dieppe, and Poole to Cherbourg.

By cruise ship[edit]
The cruise terminal is just south of the ferry terminal.  At the cruise terminal, you can pick up a map of the downtown city (very useful).  A shuttle bus brings you downtown in about 5–10 minutes (2½ km).  The dropoff point is on east side of rue de Paris, just before rue Victor Hugo. From this point, you can easily move about the downtown core.

By plane[edit]
49.5338890.0880561 Le Havre – Octeville Airport (LEH  IATA). Has no scheduled flights, but is still used for general aviation and the occasional charter to southern European resorts.   
The nearest airports offering scheduled international and domestic flights are at Deauville (DOL IATA), Beauvais (BVA IATA), and Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG IATA).

By car[edit]
Traffic in the southern approach to Le Havre has benefited from the construction of the huge Pont de Normandie over the Seine estuary. However, whilst certainly impressive from an architectural standpoint, during busy summer weekends the entire structure can seem more like a car-park. Expect long delays (up to an hour) to cross the 4 km toll bridge (about €6).
There is an Avis car hire agency at Gare du Havre (train station), on the corner of Cours de la République and Magellan Street.  From City Hall, it's a 20-minute walk (1½ km) east along Boulevard de Strasbourg.

Get around[edit]
The centre of town is easily covered on foot.
A local bus service runs regularly around town.
The ferry port and train station are a short walk out from the centre of town and buses run on these routes.
Rent a bike for a few euros at the tourist office or at the bus parked along the beach during the season.

See[edit]
Maison de l'armateur
Church Saint-Vincent
The view of the port (bassin du commerce) with its lovely bridge and both the Volcano and steeple of St Joseph's church in the background. Nice both in the day or at night. On the north quay, the casino (gambling, fine restaurants, hotel, spa).
St Vincent district is an old district near the beach which didn't suffer too much from the terrible bombings that flattened the city in 1944 and in which 5,000 people died in the ruins in a few hours. The little church and the square around it evoke a village atmosphere in southern France. During the season, painters gather on the square and give an impression of "Montmartre".
Take the funiculaire (cable car) for an easy climb to Le Havre's upper plateau. From the Hôtel de Ville (City Hall), it’s a 7-minute walk (600 metres) along avenue René Coty to the lower terminal is located on rue Gustave-Flaubert (corner rue du Docteur-Vigné). A one-way ticket costs €0.40. Once at the top, turn right from the upper terminal (heading east), along rue Félix-Faure, another 7-minute walk (500 metres) brings you to a superbly panoramic view of the beautiful city and its harbour. You can return down the Escalier Olivier-Senn, then stroll through narrow historic streets, zig-zagging back to the city center. Returning to the lower terminal takes about 12 minutes, all downhill.
