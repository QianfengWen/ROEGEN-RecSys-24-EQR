Old City Hall (Altes Rathaus)
Itzehoe (IPA: [ɪtsəˈhoː]) is a city in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany.


Understand[edit]
Despite what you may think, Itzehoe is not pronounced with a German "ö" sound at the end, but rather with a long "o", so the correct pronunciation sounds almost like "It's a hoe".

Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
53.9249.510621 Itzehoe Station. There are several Intercities daily from places as far away as Cologne or Dresden, some trains even go to Frankfurt. They all go on to Westerland on the island of Sylt where they terminate. Furthermore there is service by regional trains to the rest of Schleswig Holstein and to Hamburg-Altona. Why do so many trains stop in this rather modest town, you might ask. Well, the electrification of the mainland towards Sylt ends/begins here and thus all trains passing through must change their motive power from diesel to electric and vice versa - and while they are stopped for that anyway, they might as well load and unload passengers.

By car[edit]
Autobahn A23 as well as Bundesstraße B 5, B 77 and B 206 connect the town with the surrounding places.

Go next[edit]
Itzehoe is a good point of origin if you want to explore the German North Sea coast. Furthermore the Kiel Canal, the busiest in the world, is just a couple of kilometers to the northwest (A23 crosses it) and also easily reachable by bike. If you haven't been to Sylt already, take a train and take it all in. Büsum, some 30 km to the northwest is the point of departure for ferries to Heligoland, and rather well known locally for its Krabben (scientifically: Crangon crangon). If you feel a big city is what you want to experience next, Hamburg is a little less than 50 km in the other direction.

Wacken[edit]
The hamlet of Wacken, famous for its heavy metal festival is not far from Itzehoe. Itzehoe is the closest train station to the festival from where an official shuttle service gets metalheads to the festival.
