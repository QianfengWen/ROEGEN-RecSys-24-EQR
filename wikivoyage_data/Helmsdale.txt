Helmsdale is a fishing village in  Sutherland in the Scottish Highlands, about two hours by road or rail north of Inverness. In 2011 its population was 764. The name derives from Norse Hjalmundal, the "Dale of the Helmet". 


Understand[edit]
The village was planned and built on a grid pattern in the early 19th century to accommodate those who were being evicted from the valleys above to make way for sheep, the infamous Highland Clearances. There was a brief gold rush along the river in 1869.

58.1167-3.65421 Timespan, Dunrobin Street, KW8 6JA, ☏ +44 1431 821327. Mar-Oct: daily 10AM-5PM. Local history museum, covering the Clearances, and the Helmsdale gold rush of 1869. You can still pan for gold further up the valley. With café. Adult £4. (updated Aug 2022)
Helmsdale Castle was an L-plan tower house built 1488 just south of the river. In 1567 the Earl's aunt tried to poison her way to the succession. The last of the ruins were cleared away in the 1970s when A9 was re-aligned across the bridge, so all you see now is a monument by the roadside.
Emigrants' Statue adjacent commemorates the Scots of the diaspora to the colonies, and those dispossessed by the clearances (not quite the same thing). Completed in 2007, its sculptor was born in Helmsdale but went out to the South Africa goldfields. A matching statue was unveiled in Winnipeg in 2008, where a group from Helmsdale had been among the founder families.

58.0659-3.79632 Lothbeg Wolf Stone records the killing of the last wolf in Scotland around 1800. The claim is possible, but 1700 is a likelier date. Wolves were hunted or trapped to extinction in England and Wales by 1500, and in Ireland by 1786. The bleak hills of Sutherland are one area proposed for their re-introduction.
58.0235-3.86813 Clynelish Distillery, Brora KW9 6LR, ☏ +44 1408 623000, clynelish.distillery@diageo.com. Daily 10AM-5PM. Now part of Diageo, this was a twin distillery, but Clynelish A (or Brora) closed in 1983 and you visit Clynelish B. It produces a peaty single malt whisky, 95% of which goes into Johnnie Walker Red Label; see Kilmarnock#Understand for the story of this iconic brand. However a few bottles of single malt are released, and old stock from Distillery A are pricey collectors' items. Tasting £15, tour £19.   (updated Aug 2022)
57.9872-3.91214 Carn Liath is an Iron Age broch, which looks to have been built over a Bronze Age village and burial site. It's free to access 24 hours.
57.9823-3.94585 Dunrobin Castle, Golspie KW10 6SF, ☏ +44 1408 633177. Apr-Oct: daily 10AM-4:30PM. Opulent home of the Dukes of Sutherland, originally from 14th century but what you see now is mostly a grandiose Victorian chateau. Yes, lots of heads of dead animals, and the dark side is that the duchy ruthlessly evicted its tenants in the 18th and 19th centuries. With extensive gardens. Adult £13.50, conc £11.50, child £8.50.

North of town[edit]
58.1484-3.57936 Ousdale Broch is a substantial Iron Age tower from 2nd or 3rd century BC; it was repaired 2015-20 and the access path was improved. In 1201 it may have marked the boundary between Viking and Scots territory, as William King of Scotland faced down Harald the Elder here. Nearby are ruins of the clearance village of Borg, but those at Badbea are better.

58.159-3.5517 Badbea  (pronounced "bad-bay") is an abandoned village 5 miles north of Helmsdale along A9. There are many poignant ruins across this region whose inhabitants were evicted to make way for sheep, but Badbea is the other way round: from 1792 evicted crofters gathered in this area, and were given small plots of land (useless even for sheep) to tend and on which to build their own houses. They also found employment in herring fishing. By the late 19th century that was unprofitable, and the villagers drifted away to the cities and to the colonies. The site is freely accessible 24 hours: park on A9 and follow the soggy track south for half a mile.
58.182-3.49628 Berriedale Castle is a medieval ruin on a coastal promontory.
58.2363-3.50899 Eagle Rock is a memorial on the hillside where an RAF Sunderland flying boat crashed on 25 Aug 1942. Fourteen of the 15 aboard were killed, including Prince George, Duke of Kent, the first British royal death on active service since James IV was slain at Flodden. The plane was heading through fog to Iceland, and it's thought strong winds pushed it inland from its intended course; the Duke's lurid early life prompted all sorts of alternative stories.
58.249-3.43210 Dunbeath is a village 15 miles north of Helmsdale on A9. It was the birthplace of the novelist Neil Gunn (1891-1973), best known for "The Silver Darlings". Dunbeath Heritage Museum (Tu W F 10AM-4PM) covers his work, a major component of the 20th century rebirth of Scottish literature. Dunbeath Broch half a mile upriver is an Iron Age redoubt. Dunbeath Castle teetering on the cliff edge a mile south of the village is private, no tours. Laidhay Croft Museum a mile north up A9 is a 250-year-old thatched longhouse.
See  Wick for points north of Latheron, where A9 heads north inland to Thurso while A99 follows the coast to Wick and John o'Groats. Useful to know: "Latheron" is from the Gaelic for "muddy place".

Golf: Helmsdale GC is nine holes. Twice round off yellow tees is 3720 yards, par 60.
Brora GC is 18 holes, white tees 6211 yards, par 70.

Drink[edit]
Bannockburn Inn is on Stafford St the main road. The bar is open 4PM till late. They serve meals and have rooms.
Rum is only produced in a handful of places across Scotland; the micro-distillery revival of the 2010s was mostly about gin. Scots Rum is a Helmsdale-based venture to make more. Ominously, the website extols piratical traditions in the same breath as crowd-funding the planned distillery via cryptocurrency, so it's unclear when or if anyone will get to drink any rum, or reap any other return on investment.
