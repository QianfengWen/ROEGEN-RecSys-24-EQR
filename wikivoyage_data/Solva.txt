Solva Harbour showing Lime Kilns
Solva (Welsh: Solfach) is an ancient harbour village near St Bride's Bay in the county of Pembrokeshire in North Wales. It lies on a deep ravine at the mouth of the River Solva.  In the ravine is Lower Solva, consisting of a long street ending at the small harbour. Solva lies on the north side of St Bride's Bay, in North Pembrokeshire in the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park and on the Pembrokeshire Coast Path. The trading ships have been replaced by tourism, and the harbour has become a popular boating centre.
