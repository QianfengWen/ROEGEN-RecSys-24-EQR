Álamos is a town of 11,000 people (2020) in the foothills of the Sierra Madre Occidental in Sonora. Alamos is the main historical attraction of Sonora, and one of Mexico's most splendid colonial cities. As the most northern of the colonial pueblos, Alamos has a rich history of conquistadors, mining barons, imperialists and revolutionaries. Upon entering the city, you'll experience a feeling of a different age, of Spanish romanticism, of Old Mexico.


Understand[edit]
Town hall
Historically an important center of silver mining, the town's economy is now dominated by the tourist sector. It has been designated a pueblo mágico due to its architecture. 
Álamos today is known for its charming atmosphere and warm, friendly people, where one can leave the hurried life behind and relax into the serene lifestyle of this small colonial gem. The population hovers around 6,000 people in the city and another 4,000 inhabitants in outlying areas yet Álamos retains the grandeur of its colonial past.
Álamos is known as “La Ciudad de los Portales” (portales are tall, arched, covered verandas or walkways fronting many of the cobble-stoned streets or calles). Álamos boasts numerous buildings exhibiting classic Andalusian architecture from Mexico's Colonial period, including numerous mansions, the Plaza de Armas, the Church of La Purísima Concepción, La Capilla and the Palacio Municipal (“city hall”).
The great wealth created by the silver mines from the surrounding mining towns of La Aduana, Minas Nuevas, and others enabled the founders and residents of Álamos to build scores of colonial Spanish mansions throughout the town; most of them went into ruin in the early 20th century but in the late 1940s, a number of Americans and Canadians began buying and restoring the houses.

Climate[edit]
The climate, due to its position in the Sierras, retains cool, pleasant days in the winter, some hot days in the summer and spectacular rain storms in July & August. The area offers almost 360 days of sunshine. Álamos has three seasons: a hot, dry season from April to June, a hot, humid wet season from July to October, and a warm, generally dry “winter” from November to March.
