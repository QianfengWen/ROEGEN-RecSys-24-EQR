Ganja (Azeri: Gəncə) is a city in the Ganja Region of northwestern Azerbaijan.


Understand[edit]
Ganja is one of the oldest cities in the Caucasus, and has long been one of the most important in Azerbaijan. Having been subjected to a seemingly endless stream of invading armies, its name has changed repeatedly over the years and is very interesting architecturally. The historical name, Ganja, was restored once again upon Azerbaijan's independence in 1991. With a population of 330,744 (2016), it is the country's second-largest city.
Most proudly the city was home to Azerbaijan’s national bard Nizami Gəncəvi (1141–1209).

Respect[edit]
Basic advice will help you to feel comfortable in most common situations.

Be familiar with the terms Qeyret, Adat and Namus (code of honour). Unlike Baku, Ganjalis understand causes of globalization and resist it in areas related to family and human behaviour.
Never joke about the name of the city also being a word for marijuana.
Ganjalis are very hospitable people, and sometimes you may mistakenly think that it's false hospitality. In fact, some people can overdo it in their desire to help you. It is your responsibility to stop them (and do so with plausible arguments), but be careful because even a hint of rejection will hurt them.
