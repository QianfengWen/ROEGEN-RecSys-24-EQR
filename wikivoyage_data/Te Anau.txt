Te Anau is a small town on the shore of Lake Te Anau, in the Southland region of the South Island.  It is the gateway to Fiordland National Park and Milford Road.


Get in[edit]
Turn off the Queenstown - Invercargill highway just north of Lumsden onto SH94. Te Anau also has an airstrip for light sightseeing aircraft.
Most travellers use Te Anau as a jumping-off point to Milford Sound and Doubtful Sound. Allow 2 hours to reach Milford Sound from Te Anau. There are lots of scenic stops along Milford Road, but not much else, so stop at Fresh Choice for snacks and be sure to fill up your fuel tank, as there is limited petrol available in Milford Sound.

By bus[edit]
InterCity Coachlines run buses to Te Anau from Christchurch via Dunedin, Queenstown and Milford Sound. From Invercargill a change at Gore is required.
Tracknet run buses from Queenstown and Invercargill. This is also available as a combined ferry and bus ticket from Stewart Island by Stewart Island Experience. Tracknet have services to and from some walking routes.

Lake Te Anau
-45.2954167.7271 Te Anau-au Caves. Approximately 2.3 hr total. A boat trip and guided tour into the Aurora Caves system by walking path and small boats within the cave itself where you will see thousands of glow worms. The caves are only accessible by boat, and Real Journeys operates a quality catamaran for a 30-minute cruise each way.

It is not suitable for everyone. You will have to bend over considerably at the entrance, which is only 1 m high for 3-4 m. Promotions often apply. $63/adult, $20/child.   
 Lake Te Anau (Te Ana-au). "The cave of swirling water", it is the second-largest lake by surface area in New Zealand (after Lake Taupo) and the largest in the South Island. North Fiord, Middle Fiord and South Fiord are the only inland NZ fiords. 
 Lake Marian. Off Hollyford Road on the way to Milford lies one of the most beautiful places on earth. 
-45.43302167.713242 Te Anau Wildlife Centre (1 km (c. 10-min walk) from the Fiordland National Park Visitor Centre towards Manapouri). Dawn to dusk. A short walk from downtown, the Te Anau Wildlife Centre provides the unique opportunity to view some of New Zealand's rarest endangered birds. Be sure to see the takahe, a large flightless bird with beautiful blue plumage and an enormous red beak. With only 225 takahe left in New Zealand, this is perhaps your only opportunity to see this majestic bird. Free, but donations are appreciated. 
Do[edit]
Tramp any of the many tracks located in the area. Te Anau isn't called the walking capital of the world for no reason! The major tracks that can be started from the surrounding area include the following "Great Walks":
 Kepler Track. This track starts from near Te Anau, and the section around the lake to Brod Bay and back makes a pleasant gentle day walk. The complete track ( a circular route) usually takes 3 or 4 days and climbs to 1470 m. (updated Mar 2018)
 Routeburn Track. (updated Mar 2018)
 Milford Track. This has been described as the greatest walk in the world. It is very popular and the many dates are fully booked within hours of booking opening in June for the following summer. The track starts with a ferry ride from Te Anau Downs, and there are connecting shuttle buses available. The track takes 4 days if you are walking independently. (updated Mar 2018)
Don't miss out on going to Milford Sound, taking a cruise, and enjoying the scenic wonderland. For once it's probably better to take a bus, they don't rush it and you get good quality commentary.
Take a day walk somewhere - Lake Marian for example. If you don't have gear, you can hire it from Bev's Tramping Gear Hire.
 Cruise Te Anau. A boutique cruise to the South Fiord of Lake Te Anau and a gentle bush/nature walk to discover the Hidden Lakes.

Go next[edit]
State Highway 94 (SH 94), the Milford Road, leads to Milford Sound, 120 km to the north.  Milford Sound is a major tourist attraction, but the trip itself is just as spectacular and should not be rushed. There are several scenic stops along the route that provide unique views. With about 2,500 visitors a day travelling to Milford Sound at peak times, it pays to get an early start, especially as parking space sometimes runs out in the (free) Milford car parks in the late morning.
Manapouri is just to the south via State Highway 95 (SH 95), which serves as an important gateway for exploring Doubtful Sound.
