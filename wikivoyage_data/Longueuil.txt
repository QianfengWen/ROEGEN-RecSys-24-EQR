History[edit]
Charles Le Moyne, lord of the area under the French colonial system starting in 1657, named Longueuil after a village which is today the seat of a canton in the district of Dieppe in his homeland of Normandy.
His son, Charles Le Moyne de Longueuil, built Fort Longueuil as his fortified residence. It was constructed of stone between 1685 and 1690 and had four towers.
Fort Longueuil was believed to be occupied by American troops during the American Revolutionary War. It was subsequently occupied by the British. It was demolished in 1810 due to its poor condition. The archaeological remains of Fort Longueuil are a National Historic Site of Canada. The site extends beneath the present-day Saint-Antoine-de-Padoue Cathedral. Until the middle of the 19th century, Longueuil and its boroughs formed a single Catholic entity with the Saint-Antoine-de-Padoue church as the only place of worship.

Municipal restructuring
City Hall near the airport
The territory of Longueuil became a barony, then a parish municipality. Throughout history, the latter has broken up into seven autonomous administrative units: Longueuil, Jacques-Cartier, Montreal-South, Greenfield Park, Saint-Hubert, Mackayville (now Laflèche) and LeMoyne. Then some municipal mergers occurred. In 2002, as part of the major municipal restructuring in Quebec, the new Longueuil was created by the amalgamation of the former cities of Boucherville, Longueuil, Lemoyne, Saint-Lambert, Brossard, Greenfield Park, Saint-Hubert and Saint-Bruno.
Following a referendum on mergers, the cities of Brossard, Saint-Lambert, Saint-Bruno and Boucherville were reconstituted in 2006, by detachment from the agglomeration. Since 2006, these four detached towns have been linked to the agglomeration which is a supramunicipal entity for common services, in particular the fire and police department, municipal assessment, public transport, social housing, the municipal court.

Climate[edit]
Longueuil has long winters, lasting from November to March, short springs during April and May, average summers, lasting from June to August, and short autumns during September and October.
