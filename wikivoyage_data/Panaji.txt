Panaji, also spelt Panjim, is the capital city of the tiny state of Goa in India. It has its own charm, a river flowing along one side of the city, some areas which are low-rise and red-roofed, and even a Latin Quarter at the eastern end of town. Increasingly, it is shaping itself as a centre where cultures (many from around the globe, and from diverse areas of India too) meet and creativity flourishes.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
The nearest airports are Dabolim Airport (GOI IATA, 35 km) and Manohar Parrikar International Airport (GOX IATA).

By train[edit]
The nearest railway station is 15.49045873.9245351 Karmali (IR station code: KRMI), about 10 km to the east, but many express trains do not halt there. A more important railhead is Madgaon Junction, 45 km to the south, being the main junction on the Konkan Railway all trains stop here.
From the railway station, taxis, rickshaws and buses go to Panaji, but if you are carrying only a backpack, motorcycle taxis are a bargain, plus you get to ride on the pillion seat! Be sure to fix fares before the ride. If you are on a tight budget, and carrying little baggage, you could take the local bus. To get to the bus stop, get out of the Karmali station, a short climb and across the road is the bus stop. Wait across the road for busses going towards Panaji. There is no sign board marking the Bus stop.
On the first floor of the KTC Bus stand at Panaji is the Konkan Railway ticketing office, you can make or cancel all Indian Railway tickets here. A ₹10 service fee is levied on each transaction, which is well worth it, as it saves you making a trip to Karmali, Thivim or Madgaon station to do ticketing work. The ticketing office is air conditioned, has seats, and issues tokens, so you don't have to stand in a queue awaiting your turn. The counter is open from 8AM to 6PM on weekdays.

By bus[edit]
Panaji is connected with the state of Karnataka to the south and Maharashtra to the north by winding highways.
A wide range of buses are available. The non air-conditioned, state transport bus, that though cheap is an interesting way to travel, if you don't mind the discomfort of a rattling bus body, rigid seats, over crowding and stopping at umpteen villages and bus depots along the route. You could also take a reserved ticket, which assures you of a seat, though is no protection against over crowding. Locals usually share seats. The state transport corporations, also have semi-luxury and luxury buses. Luxury meaning the seats are padded and recline.
The major state transport corporations operating in Goa are the Kadamba Transport Corporation (KTC), from Goa, Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC), from Maharashtra, and the Karnataka State Road Transport from Karnataka. All the state transport buses, usually begin and terminate at the Kadamba bus stand at Panaji. Bookings, time tables etc. can be had here.
Dozens of semi-luxury and luxury buses also connect Panaji with Mumbai, Pune, Mangalore, Bangalore, and Hyderabad. A relatively comfortable option is the Air conditioned Volvo coaches that operate towards the later hours. Find out prices before you purchase a ticket, as it is not uncommon to find that your neighbour on the bus has paid a much higher or lower price for the ticket. Many travel agents have their offices in the building adjacent to the Kadamba bus stand.
A famous romantic Bollywood film, Bombay to Goa starring the Indian super star Amitabh Bachchan, was based on this bus journey.
All private buses leave from the bus stand at the beginning of the Mandovi bridge. Bus departures start daily from 4PM and go on till almost 10PM when the last Volvo coaches leave.

By car[edit]
NH-17 (National Highway-17) passes through Panaji. (This is the route buses will take while coming down from Mumbai). The route is scenic, and roads in good condition compared with other routes, but narrow and risky along part of the journey, so driving down is not recommended unless you are used to Indian roads. A detour from NH-17 towards Kolhapur joins you to the Expressway and further on to the Mumbai Pune Expressway. Take this route if you intend including Lonavala, Khandala or Pune on your itinerary. The expressway is also faster and safer, though the additional distance will not save you much time.
NH-4A connects to the NH-17 from Panaji. This is the main highway connecting Goa with the state of Karnataka. Be prepared for a rattling travel, as the road condition has deteriorated beyond repair on a 20 km stretch near Anmod, as soon as you enter Karnataka. The Government of Karnataka has neglected this important tourist link, which connects Goa with world heritage sites at Badami, Pattadkal and Hampi. This road is one of the reasons why Karnataka lost the Tata Nano project to Gujarat, as its bad condition almost deprived Dharwad of the nearest port facility.
From Mumbai - Take NH4 or the new Expressway towards Pune, Kolhapur. After Kolhapur, continue on Nh4 for 25 km, then pass the town of Nipani, then climb up a hill, and the take right towards Ajra, Sawantwadi via Amboli ghat. This will take you through Uttur, Ajra, Amboli, & finally Sawantwadi - in about 3-4 hours. After reaching Sawantwadi continue south on NH17 towards Panaji. Sawantwadi to Panaji is about 60 km; you will pass through Mapusa and you could take a detour to Calangute, Baga, Vagator.  The time from Mumbai to Pune is approximately 3-4 hours. Pune - Kolhapur is approximately 3-4 hours and Kolhapur to Panaji via Sawantwadi is 4 hours.
From Mumbai - Take the Pune Expressway, exit at Panvel. Take NH-17 South and continue for 600 km down south to Panaji. You will pass through Mahad, Khed, Chiplun, Vengurla, Sawantwadi and finally into Panaji. NH-17 is a narrow, winding road and expect to travel at an average of 50 km/hour.

Don't miss out on the old city.
See the islands that are just across the river. It only takes a couple of minutes to cross on the car ferry, and on the other side there are unpopulated fields of high marsh grass, sweeping views and utter peacefulness. To access the islands go to Ribandar, on the road to Old Goa, and take the ferry at Ribandar going to Chorao. Or go further down, just past the Goa Institute of Management and take the other ferry. The ferry service is free to passengers, though cars, motorcycles and other vehicles pay a small fee. The islands can also be accessed from the Ferry crossing at Old Goa, behind the Church Complex, also a calm spot for a bit of fishing.
Miramar Beach - A lovely golden beach of soft sand girdled with palm trees. The main beach outside of state-capital Panaji.

D'Silva's, serves delicious authentic Goan snacks opposite the children's park, just past the roundabout. The place is obscure and easy to miss out.

Nice playground for kids, including a giant fish made of cement.

Some great food can be found in this calm and breezy capital city.

Drink[edit]
There are lots of places in Goa where one can find a bar and restaurant. There's one around every corner of every road. Visitors arriving in Goa during the very early hours, stand a better chance of getting a tipple than a cuppa.
Many small village bars also serve authentic Goan fare. Some of the best and freshest fish curry and rice and fried fish, squid, mussels, crabs etc. can be had here. You can be sure it is authentic Goan fare as few tourists visit these places. Most of these bars offer a quiet laid back atmosphere to sip your drink and contemplate, unless of course a Cricket match is on television.

15.49900473.8334251 Down The Road, at Pato Bridge, GM road. The other landmark is the general post office, 20 meters down to the bridge. The ground floor is a bar with Kala OK.

 Spicy Bella Bar & Restaurant, opp Campal Parade Gground, Bal Bhavan Rd (on the way to miramar beach), ☏ +91 6454710. 24 hrs. The speciality of this restaurant is Italian Pizzas and Pasta, which you have to try. The ‘Spicy Bella Pizza’ shown at the right is unarguably the best Italian pizza you can get around Panaji. It will keep you wanting for more. The other Italian pizzas are a bit plain, and go for those only if you have an appetite for Italian pizzas specifically. If you love Domino’s and US pizzas, it is likely that you won’t like the usual Italian ones. The menu hosts an exotic list of pasta dishes. Since every pasta dish is totally different, we can’t comment much on their taste in general. The quantity is good enough for 2 people though. And with every pasta or pizza, you get about 4 different spices and pepper sauce. The drinks menu lists about 6-7 mocktails, but if you let them know that you’re all in for mocktails, you will be presented with the bartender’s special menu with super exotic ones and all kinds of combinations such as kiwi juice with blue crush, pineapple juice with coconut cream and so on. We tried some cool ones. In the adjoining photo, the leftmost one is “Mickey donald”, with a dominant pineapple taste and a hint of strawberry and cream. Prefect for pineapple lovers. The one in the middle is ‘Pink Blossom’ from the regular menu. It has a combination of pineapple, orange and litchi. The one that took the longest to make is the one at the right, called ‘Spring Cooler’. It is a unique blend of juices, cream, and crush. Overall, we can say that Spicy Bella has the most exotic list of mocktails on the menu.

Goa is home to the Consulate General of Portugal, which is understandable, as Portugal has had close and long historic and colonial ties with Goa. As Portugal never recognized India's takeover of the state, for a long time, it considered Goans eligible for Portuguese passports. While it is no longer as easy as it once was for people of Goan origin, this continues to be available, but difficult and time-consuming to obtain now especially for those born after 1961.
