Shrine of Our Lady of Altötting
Altötting is one of the most important and most visited Catholic pilgrimage destination in Europe. The city is in Upper Bavaria, close to the Austrian border.


Understand[edit]
First mentioned in the 8th century (although the first settlements probably date back more than 3000 years), Altötting's ascension as a Catholic pilgrimage destination began in the 9th century with the construction of a first monastery by King Carloman of Bavaria.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
There are two airports that are suitable for a trip to Regensburg:

Munich International Airport (MUC IATA), one of the busiest airports in Europe, is located 80 km (50 mi) to the west of the city with many international connections.
Salzburg International Airport (SZG IATA) is situated 60 km (35 mi) to the south of Altötting and has mostly domestic (Austrian) and a few European connections.
By train[edit]
Altötting station is conveniently located just south of the city center, but due to its very small size lacks most amenities of a modern train station. There are hourly connections to Munich (90 min) and Landshut (75 min), and a bihourly connection to Salzburg (105 min). With all connections there is a change of trains in Mühldorf am Inn.

By car[edit]
With its rather remote location close to the Austrian border, Altötting isn't so well connected to the German highway network. The most important ones are autobahn A 94 to Munich and federal highway B 20 to Salzburg.

On foot[edit]
Altötting, given its importance for German Catholics, is a major destination of pilgrimage. These pilgrimages are mostly organised and go for 120-200 km and 3-5 days.
