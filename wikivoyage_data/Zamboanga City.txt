Zamboanga City is in the Mindanao region of the Philippines. Known as the "City of Flowers" (the etymology of Zamboanga comes from the Malay word jambangan means garden of flowers), it is now one of the most important and busiest port cities in the Philippines.
Zamboanga is often called "Asia's Latin City", partly because the Chavacano language, a Spanish-based creole, is common and partly because is shares other Spanish traditions; it even has the same patron saint as Spain, Our Lady of the Pilar.


Understand[edit]




City of Flowers
One common and popularly accepted claim how Zamboanga got its name is that it derived from the Malay word jambangan ("flower garden"), though other historical findings dispute that. All that said however, Zamboanga City is proud to call itself the "City of Flowers" after that name derivation.


Zamboanga City is one of the largest cities in the Philippines by land area, with a size of about 1,500 km2 (580 sq mi), coming third after Puerto Princesa (about 2,300 km2 (890 sq mi)) and Davao City (2,400 km2 (930 sq mi)). It is also the second largest city in Mindanao (after Davao City) and the sixth largest in the Philippines. by population, with about 860,000 residents as of 2015.
The city is an important seaport, being the main transportation to the south. During Spanish times, Zamboanga provided protection to the rest of the Philippines from menacing Muslim pirates (which remains a threat until today). 

Orientation[edit]
Zamboanga City is large sizewise, around as large as Davao City. With its vast area, mostly rural, it is much more of a province with an urbanized area at the southern end and towns and villages surrounding it. It is subdivided into 98 barangays, 30 being urbanized. Zamboanga City is bordered to the north by the provinces of Zamboanga del Norte and Zamboanga Sibugay, and Basilan Island to the south.

People[edit]
Zamboanga City natives mostly belong to the Zamboangueño ethnic group, a result of marriages between Spaniards and Austronesian peoples brought to the city to build forts. Zamboangueños speak the Spanish-based creole language Chavacano, which is widely spoken across the city, and are proud of their Spanish ancestry. Due to migration out of the insurgency-ridden Sulu Archipelago, Muslim-majority Yakan, Samal, and Badjao (Sama-Bajau) are also widespread. 

Climate[edit]
Compared to the majority of Mindanao, Zamboanga City has a tropical wet and dry climate with an average of 28 °C (82 °F). Daily highs range between 32–33 °C (90–91 °F) and lows between 24–25 °C (75–77 °F). There is rather a short dry season, running between January to March; it is mostly rainy for the rest of the year.

Talk[edit]
The two commonest languages in the city are Cebuano (Bisaya) which is spoken in many nearby areas and Chavacano (Zamboangueño), a creole language whose vocabulary is 80% Spanish but whose grammar is mostly from Philippine languages.
The national government promotes Tagalog as a national language, but it is not indigenous to this region. Both Tagalog and English are taught in all schools, so many people speak one or both though the levels vary hugely.
There are some people in the city whose native tongue is that of some nearby area — Hiligaynon in some parts of Mindanao, Tausug in the Sulu Islands — but most of them will also speak one or more of the languages mentioned above.

Stay safe[edit]
Zamboanga City lies just north of the Sulu Islands, and the risk of the insurgency there spilling over into the city remains high. In September 2013, Zamboanga was besieged by the then-Islamic nationalists Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), which flattened parts of the city, but hostilities have hardly affected the downtown.
