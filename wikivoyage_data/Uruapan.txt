See[edit]
Plaza de Martires de Uruapan. Facing this plaza are two commercial portals as well as some of the city's most important landmarks. On the north side, there is the La Huatápera Museum. The Plaza has a chapel called Santo Entierro, with fine stonework in cantera in plateresque style. The interior is restored and contains images of angels playing musical instruments and important people from the history of the Catholic church. The rest of the complex shows Moorish influence and houses a collection of handcrafts from the various indigenous communities of the state.
La Huatápera Museum (also known as Museo de los Cuatro Pueblos Indios). Huatápera is a Purépecha word, meaning “meeting place.” It was originally a hospital, built over a pre-Hispanic platform. The museum exhibits artwork by the Purepecha, Nahua, and Otomi indigenous peoples, as well as temporary exhibits of art and historical interest.
Immaculate Concepción church
Just to the east of the Huatápera Museum is the Immaculate Concepción church, which was built in the late 20th century. It has a cantera portal finished in the 1970s but no cupola nor bell tower.
The Casa de Cultura (Cultural Center) is on the western side of Huatápera. It was built in 1992 over what was the Franciscan monastery established by Juan de San Miguel. The original church of this monastery is now the parish church for the city. Built in 1533, it maintains its 16th-century Plateresque portal, and the interior of the church has a crucifix that dates from the 18th century. The paintings on the triangular spaces just under the cupola represent salvation and the miracle of the Mass, done by Mohamed Socidel.
San Pedro Factory
The San Pedro Factory (Fabrica San Pedro) is a still-operational textile factory built in the late 19th century, when the city was at its industrial peak. Construction of the mill began in 1886, originally to work with cotton but later expanded to other fibers, such as linen and silk. The factory is still in operation but not to the same capacity as in the past. The current owners maintain the more handcrafted feel of the products making bedspreads, tablecloths, napkins and more. Part of the complex is now used for cultural and other events.
The city is home to the narrowest house in the world according to the Guinness Book of World Records. Located at 50-C Carrillo Puerto, it measures 1.40 by 7.70 meters.

Legend has it that a priest named Juan de San Miguel exorcised the devil during the 16th century, and that as the devil ran, he tripped and hit his knee on the ground, splitting open the canyon with water gushing from the spot. The springs feed a trout farm in the park where natural resources authorities grow fish to stock streams in the region. The trout farm is open for tours and you can even buy a fresh trout for your dinner table if you like. (updated May 2024)
