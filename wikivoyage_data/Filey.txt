Filey is a seaside town in North Yorkshire, England. It used to be a fishing village, catching sea trout from cobles, but it lacks a harbour: boats have to be dragged up the sands. So its fishermen couldn't compete with better-endowed ports, and in the 19th century the village evolved into a holiday resort. In 2021 the population was 6665. 
Filey's long firm sandy beach stretches for 3 miles between the Brigg and Flamborough Head. From 1910 to 1912 this was a test field for early aviation, with Bleriots and other locally-designed aircraft juddering into the sky on shaky wings.

By rail[edit]
Filey is on a branch line between  Hull and Scarborough, so you can get here in two ways: via York, changing at Seamer (just before Scarborough) for the train towards Hull, or at Hull north via Beverley and Bridlington. The branch line trains run daily but only every two hours or so, and the Seamer connection can be tight. If your train from York is late, ask the conductor if the Hull train can be held. But you'll probably be advised to stay on the train to Scarborough then take Bus 12 / 13, see below, which doesn't go through Seamer.
54.2099-0.29381 Filey railway station is a sturdy old brick building with a small waiting room, toilet and ticket machine. There is step-free access to both platforms via the level crossing. Outside is a taxi office, a string of eating places and the bus station.

By road[edit]
From M1 / A1 take A64 east past York. This road gets very congested on summer weekends.
From South and Midlands follow M18 east onto M62. Leave at Howden, take A614 to Bridlington then A165. This road can likewise be slow-moving.
Travel news on Yorkshire Coast Radio[dead link] (96.2FM) will cheerfully confirm that you are indeed stuck in a traffic jam.
There's very little parking by the seafront, as the esplanade huddles against a cliff. Try north end of town, eg round Church Ravine, or the country park towards the Brigg.

By bus[edit]
The simplest route is via Scarborough, reached by the hourly Transdev Coastliner 843 from Leeds via York and Malton. Then take East Yorkshire Bus 12 / 13, which runs south from Scarborough daily every 30 min to Filey (30 min) and Bridlington (another 30 min). It's a leisurely trip as the bus visits all the caravan parks along the coast.
From Hull take East Yorkshire Bus 121 to Bridlington. This runs hourly, daily, taking two hours via Beverley and Driffield. Then take the 12 / 13 bus for Filey.
Filey bus station, 100 yards from the railway station, is just a big brick bus shelter with no facilities.

Get around[edit]
Bus 12 / 13 gets you along the coast, but the train gets you closer to Hunmanby (for the distillery) and Bempton (for Flamborough Head).
The local taxi firm is Lazer Radio Taxis, tel +44 1723 515515.

54.2117-0.28871 Filey Museum, 8 Queen Street YO14 9HB, ☏ +44 1723 515013. Apr-Oct: Su-F 11AM-3:30PM. Small quirky museum of local history. Adult £2.50. (updated May 2023)
54.2132-0.28752 St Oswald's Church, Church Cliff Drive YO14 9ET. This fine church is from 12th and 13th centuries, and may have been the site of an important church for much longer. Until the Dissolution it had no vicar but was served by the monks of Bridlington Priory. It's perched above the ravine that was once the county boundary, so to say that someone "would soon be in North Riding" meant he or she would soon be laid to rest in the churchyard. The tower was a landmark for fishing vessels and in 2014 its lead roof was discovered to be etched with over 1500 graffiti from the 18th and 19th centuries.  (updated May 2023)
Sculpture along the promenade, such as High tide in short wellies aka Finlay, the great steel fisherman.

Do[edit]
54.218-0.2751 Filey Brigg is the rocky neck of land extending from the cliffs of Carr Naze. South of it, the coast is clay, which the sea has scooped out and is still busily eroding to form the bay. A path has been laid along the Brigg, reach it either along the beach or by the path descending from the car park at the top of the Naze. Get yourself out of there two hours before high tide, as a couple of low spots along the Brigg flood early and will cut you off.
Cleveland Way is a clear trail leading north-east along the cliff top to Scarborough, and eventually to Whitby. The southbound path leads through Filey to Flamborough Head and Bridlington.
Flamborough Head: see Bridlington for these great white cliffs that curtain the south end of the bay.
