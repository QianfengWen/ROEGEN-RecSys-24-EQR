History[edit]
Perth-Andover Bridge
Much of Perth (originally called Larlee) was part of the territory of the Tobique First Nation, whose reserve was established in 1801, at the band's request. Due to squatters, the First Nation were forced to surrender a total of 2,539 acres, much in Perth-Andover.
Andover was first called Little Tobique, the community was given the name Andover, from the town in England. Much of Andover's original land grants were to English soldiers and Loyalists from the American Revolution.
