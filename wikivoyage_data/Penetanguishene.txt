Town docks on Penetanguishene Bay.
Penetanguishene (usually shortened to Penetang) is a town of about 9,000 (2016) in Simcoe County.
Penetang sits on the south end of Georgian Bay, part of Lake Huron.


Understand[edit]
Historically, Penetanguishene had a large French-speaking population while neighbouring Midland was an English-speaking community. The communities reflect the heritage of both founding peoples.
The name Penetanguishene is believed to come from either the Wyandot or Abenaki via Ojibwe, meaning "land of the white rolling sands". Tourism occupies a considerable portion of its economy with five marinas and shops and restaurants catering to the tourist trade. In the winter, snowmobiling and ice fishing is popular and there is a mid-Winter carnival.

History[edit]
As early as AD 800, the Huron settled in semi-permanent villages in the area. The young French translator, Étienne Brûlé, was the first European to set foot in the Penetanguishene area, some time between 1610 and 1614.
In 1793, John Graves Simcoe, the first Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, visited the area and saw its potential as a naval base. He wanted to use the bay to shelter warships to protect British interests on lakes Huron, Erie and Michigan. Beginning in 1814, the British-Canadians built the Penetanguishene Road to provide the area a land route to Barrie and Toronto, as it had been accessible only by water transport along the rivers or across Georgian Bay.
In 1817, naval units were stationed at the Penetanguishene Naval Yard. But, because treaty limitations with the U.S. limited naval power on the Great Lakes, two British armed topsail schooners, HMS Tecumseth and HMS Newash, were laid up "in ordinary", and eventually reported to have sunk at their moorings in the harbour in 1828. Families of Métis fur traders who had moved with the British from Michilimackinac to Drummond Island after the War of 1812, moved again to Penetanguishene. They settled in the town and the surrounding area. Although the naval base was closed in 1834, the military base remained until 1856. Some of the troops settled in the area after their service was complete providing an English-speaking population.
In the 1840s, French-speaking families from Quebec (mainly from the area immediately east of Montreal), attracted by promises of cheap and fertile land, joined the French-speaking Drummond Island settlers already in the area. Later, as the logging industry began to develop, more English-speaking settlers arrived. Penetanguishene became the local market and meeting place for them. Many of Penetanguishene's families today are descended from the Québécois settlers who arrived in the 1800s, giving the town its bilingual nature.
