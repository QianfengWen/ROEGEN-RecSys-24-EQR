Whitianga is a seaside town in the middle of Mercury Bay on the east side of the Coromandel Peninsula in northern New Zealand. It has a deep water harbour from which cruising boats depart for trips around the scenic Mercury Bay coves and cliffs to Te Whanganui-A-Hei Marine Reserve and its abundant sea-life. The town is on Buffalo Beach and numerous beautiful beaches are nearby. With a permanent population of 5,000, it's the second biggest town on Coromandel Peninsula (after Thames) and the biggest on the east coast of the Peninsula, and hosts a variety of dining and accommodation options.


Understand[edit]
Buffalo Beach
Coromandel Peninsula is on the north-eastern coast of the North Island, due east from Auckland. Whitianga is north of other Peninsula towns Tairua and Pauanui. Mercury Bay is called such because Captain James Cook and his crew came here in November 1769 to make scientific observations of the transit of Mercury across the sun. On the other side of the harbour, which is accessible by a short passenger ferry trip, is Cooks Beach, which is also named after the visit by Captain Cook.

Scenic sea cruises[edit]
Cathedral Cove in Te Whanganui-A-Hei Marine Reserve near Hahei
Several operators run similar cruises, with some variations, around the cliffs and coves to Te Whanganui-A-Hei Marine Reserve and its abundant sea-life. The main cruises last between 2 and 2.5 hours, and some operators also run a 1 to 1.5 hour cruise early or late in the day, which may suit better if you are arriving or leaving Whitianga that day.
