Haarlem is a lovely historical city on the river Spaarne 20 km from Amsterdam. International tourism finally seems to have discovered the town's many charms, and an increasing number of visitors find their way here each year. A quick glance at the city centre makes it obvious why. Haarlem boasts a magnificent old centre with plenty of monumental buildings. As the city was home to several first class Dutch painters, including Frans Hals, there's a lot of art to go around. And if you're into shopping, a day in Haarlem is a day well spent too, as it was best shopping city of the country several times. Other towns may lay claims to that title, but Haarlem's centre undisputably offers a colorful mix of large chain stores, specialty shops, boutiques and art galleries. A broad range of bars and restaurants makes the picture complete. In short, Haarlem is well worth a visit. For those who are wondering: yes, the famous New York City neighbourhood of Harlem is named after this once powerful Dutch city.


Understand[edit]
Haarlem is the centre of a flower-growing district and a major export point for flower bulbs. However, with some 750,000 people visiting the city each year, tourism makes up an increasingly important part of the town's economy. With about 161,000 inhabitants (2019), Haarlem is the 13th largest city in the Netherlands but when it comes to tourism, it's the 4th most visited city. As for most popular places, this may mean the incidental line and some crowds around main attractions in high season. However, the town is fairly quiet in off season and its growing popularity does come with ample opportunities to eat and sleep.

History[edit]
The first record of the name 'Haarlem' dates from the 10th century. Located on a busy north/south connection route, the city became the seat of the Counts of Holland. In 1245 the city was granted city rights by Count William II of Holland. Due to the heroic acts of knights from Haarlem during the fifth crusade and their contributions to the siege of Damiate in 1217, Haarlem was granted permission to show a cross and a sword in the city's coat of arms. Haarlem was known for its flower growing district, and also for its textiles, shipyards, engineering plants and textile mills. In 1573, the Spanish ended its charter. In the 16th and 17th centuries, Haarlem was a hotspot for Dutch painting. Frans Hals, Jacob van Ruisdael, and Adriaen van Ostade were all located here. Also in the 17th century it became a refuge for Huguenots.
In the beginning, all of the city's buildings were wooden and the risk of fire was always present. In 1328 most of the city was burnt down. When rebuilding began, yet again in 1347, another fire spread through Haarlem. This time though, it engulfed the Counts' castle and city hall. However, the Count decided that he no longer needed a base in Haarlem and decided to move to The Hague. With that, he donated the land to Haarlem and later a new city hall would be built in its place. It would take over 150 years for the city to be rebuilt.

Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
Haarlem is well-connected by train, with intercity and sprinter trains running between Amsterdam and Haarlem Central Station roughly every 10 minutes. From Amsterdam, it's a 15-minute journey (€4.60) with trains usually leaving from platform 1 or 2. Pay a bit of attention: Haarlem is one of the stops on the main train line between Amsterdam and Dordrecht/The Hague, so it will likely not be the final destination for the train. However, as not all trains to those cities will stop in Haarlem, check the signs or ask a conductor to make sure you're getting into the right one.
Coming from Amsterdam Schiphol Airport (AMS IATA) directly, you'll have to change once, at Amsterdam Sloterdijk (or at Amsterdam Central Station, but that will take you an extra 10 minutes or so). Trains are easy to use and you may be lucky enough to encounter one or more of the most entertaining ticket collectors in the country. They number singers and magicians among their members.

By bus[edit]
A good alternative is to use the big red and grey "R-net"-bus, line 300. It runs every 6–10 minutes between Schiphol and Haarlem Central Station, or you can get out at Wulft/Centrum.  There are a fair amount of stops along the way, but for a lot of the journey there is no traffic because the bus has its own dedicated lane.  The trip is approximately 45 minutes.  You will need to carry your luggage on the bus with you. As on all public transport in the Netherlands, you pay with a OV-chipkaart and a single trip costs €3.64. There are many bus stops clustered in this area—the one for the R-net 300 is across the street, and is indicated on the sign at the bus stop.

By bike[edit]
If you have – or rent – a bike, it takes between an hour and an hour and a half to cycle (depending on the cyclist) from the centre of Amsterdam, a fairly relaxing ride on typically level terrain.

Get around[edit]
52°23′7″N 4°38′36″EMap of Haarlem
Haarlem is best seen on foot: it's a 10- to 15-minute walk from the train station to the city centre. If you don't want to walk, bus lines 2, 73 and 300 will take you from the central train and bus station to busstop "Centrum/Verwulft" in about 5 minutes. Buses here are mostly operated by Connexxion. Arriva operates a local bus route to Leiden as well.
Although Haarlem's waterways aren't quite as numerous as those of Amsterdam, there are enough of them to make a tour of the city by boat a nice experience. Boats are operated by Post Verkade cruises[dead link] (€9.50, Dutch only) and Haarlem Canal Cruises[dead link] (smaller groups, open boat, €12.50) and leave from opposite Teylers Museum. It's best to call ahead.

See[edit]
After burning down in 1932, windmill the Adriaan was rebuilt only in 2002 to reclaim its prominent place among Haarlem's attractions.
Haarlem's main sights are its lovely historic centre and its fine art museums. You'll get a good idea of what the city has to offer by just wandering the streets in the centre for a while, as many monumental buildings and the most prominent museums are all there. The tourist information office can provide maps and walking routes as well as guides, if you don't want to miss anything.

Grote Markt[edit]
Saint Bavo Church on the market square
Haarlem's main market square, with the huge Saint Bavo church right on it, is the heart of the old city. Not only the church, but several monumental buildings can be found on different sides of the square and when the weather allows, it's lined with outdoor café terraces. You'll also see the statue of Laurens Janszoon Coster, locally called "Lautje", a pioneer of book printing who has become an icon of Haarlem.

52.381314.6373591 Grote Kerk (Sint-Bavokerk), Grote Markt 22 (north side) 2011 RD. This impressive Gothic-style church has been the heart of the city and its main landmark for centuries. It was built in the middle of the Grote Markt as a Catholic church between 1370 and 1520. In 1559 it became the cathedral of the Diocese of Haarlem-Amsterdam, but less than 20 years later it was confiscated in the name of the Protestant Reformation and it has been a Protestant church ever since. Much of the antique interior remains, including the great Müller-organ that, according to records, has been played by Händel, Mozart, Mendelssohn and other famous people throughout its history. When built, this organ was the largest one in the world, leading Herman Melville in his famous novel Moby Dick to compare the inside of the whale's mouth to the many pipes of Haarlem's great organ. €2.50 adults, €1.50 youth 12-16, free for children under 12.   (updated Sep 2023)
52.3813894.6347222 Stadhuis (City Hall), Grote Markt 2. After fires destroyed the Count's castle on this location in the 14th century, this city hall was built. The current façade is slightly younger, and originates from the 17th century.   
52.3810944.6361613 Vleeshal (Meat Hall), Grote Markt 18. From 1604 until the 18th century, the Meat Hall was the only place in town where it was permitted to sell fresh meat. Butchers had to pay rather steep amounts to be granted a spot in the Dutch Renaissance style building that had been designed and built for the purpose. It's now part of the Frans Hals Museum.   
52.3816854.6364694 Hoofdwacht, Grote Markt 17 (Corner of Smedestreet). Built in the 13th century, this is one of the oldest monuments in the city and the first century of its existence, it served as the first town hall. Later, it was used as private housing for several prominent Haarlem families. From April-Sept, the building is open to visitors but only on weekends. Free.

Gapers (Black Moors Head)
These are an ancient symbol of pharmacy in the Netherlands. They look like people yawning (gapers means yawners in Dutch), but really they have their mouths open to take medicine. Sometimes a pill can be seen on their tongue. These symbols were once common in the Netherlands, especially in Amsterdam. Today they are very rare on buildings.
Usually the head is of a black or Moor man. This is because in the 15th-17th centuries, pharmacists would travel through the country with an assistant trying to sell their medicines. Before an audience the pharmacist would give a pill to his assistant. These were often Moors. The assistant would act better.
So pharmacies became known by the assistant's head.

The Cathedral became the main cathedral for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Haarlem-Amsterdam, and holds that function still today.

As well as being the tulip capital, Haarlem was a manufacturing centre producing wool, silk, lace, damask cloth, furniture, smoking pipes (along with cheap, locally-grown tobacco), and massive quantities of beer.

It gained fame through the 1865 American novel Hans Brinker or the Silver Skates, in which a boy put his finger in a hole in the dike to prevent Spaarndam from flooding. Easy cycle from central Haarlem. Famous for its statue of Peter, the boy who put his finger in the dike and saved Haarlem from flooding. There you can find great places to enjoy a great cup of coffee or a cold glass of beer. It is a strictly people zone, meaning no cars or trolleys pass through. Free.   (updated Mar 2019)
Zandvoort - one of the most popular Dutch coastal destinations is just 10 km away. You can take a train, or go by bike as it's a pleasant ride.
Zaandam - is the biggest town in Zaanstreek-Waterland, with its typical old Dutch villages, windmills, dikes and wooden houses. It's a 20-min train journey, but you'll have to change at Amsterdam Sloterdijk.
