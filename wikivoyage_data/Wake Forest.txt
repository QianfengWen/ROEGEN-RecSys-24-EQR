Wake Forest is a town in Franklin and Wake Counties of North Carolina, immediately to the north of the state capital Raleigh. With a population just over 41,000 that primarily commutes to work in the Research Triangle Park, the town is the 9th fastest growing municipality in the state of North Carolina. On first approach, it doesn't look much different from the other satellite cities and towns surrounding the Research Triangle: a sometimes congested central highway passes through shopping centers and restaurants around which are clustered sprawling residential neighborhoods. Gently rolling hills are dotted with green, a reminder of the feature for which the town is named. However, leaving the highway and driving downtown reveals an area frozen at a particular point in time. The town is primarily known for its historic character, but also for outdoor activities in the Falls Lake Recreation Area.


Understand[edit]
Wake Forest is the original home of Wake Forest University, founded in 1834. The then-college and the fledgling community around it thrived through the 1800s, excepting a period of closure for the Civil War from 1862-1865. The opening of a railroad depot to serve the college in 1874 spurred further economic growth, leading to the incorporation of the town in 1880. In the 1950s, two significant events froze much of the town: the highway moved to the west, and the college moved to a city over 100 miles a way.
Because of this, the former campus area of Wake Forest and its downtown retain much of the character of 1950s Piedmont America. The town has four historic districts, three of which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and now works to preserve what history accidentally captured. The Local Historic District, also called "Faculty Avenue", preserves the homes of faculty of the college, dating back to the early 1800s through the time of the campus's relocation. The nationally registered Downtown District features a commercial center built up between 1890 and 1950, with only one building added in 1971 after the college's move. Those with an interest in period architecture and character will find a lot to look at in Wake Forest, although outside of the commercial district few of the buildings are open to entry by the public as most have private occupants.
