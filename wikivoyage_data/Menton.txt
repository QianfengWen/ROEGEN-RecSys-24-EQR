Menton (Italian: Mentone) is "The Lemon Festival Capital of the World". Located in Alpes-Maritimes, France, but next to the border of Italy, it is in many ways more Italian than French. It has its own microclimate, generally milder than the rest of the French Riviera, and became in the late nineteenth century a place where Northern Europeans with tuberculosis came to either regain their health or to die. As a result its cemetery is filled with the graves of notable Englishmen, Germans, and Russians. The old town is largely pedestrianised, which adds to the charm of this sedate resort.

Menton has a curious one way system, it is probably a good idea to park near the port and not attempt to drive anywhere else. Although the climb up to the cemeteries is steep on foot it is considerably better than attempting to drive it.

Get around[edit]

Menton is reasonably compact and most points of interest are within walking distance.
Attractions such as the cemeteries and the churches are up steep hills and many steps however the views that can be gained are well worth the effort.
Being so close to the Italian border, one can literally walk to Italy. This is definitely more of a novelty than of practical use, as trips into Italy even to the nearby towns are far enough to be made either by rail or by road.
