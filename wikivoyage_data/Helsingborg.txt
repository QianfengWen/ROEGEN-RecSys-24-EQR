Central Helsingborg, from the castle
Helsingborg is in the Scania province of southern Sweden. Historic Helsingborg, with its many old buildings, is a scenic coastal city. The buildings are a blend of old-style stone-built churches and a 600-year-old medieval fortress (Kärnan) in the city centre, and more modern commercial buildings. 


Understand[edit]
Helsingborg is on the east side of the Oresund on Sweden's south-west coast. It's Sweden's 8th largest municipality with a population of about 128,000 (2009). Major businesses are service, trade, industry and tourism. In 2000 a branch of the University of Lund opened in the former Tretorn rubber factories a stone's throw from the Denmark ferries.
On the opposite side of the sound in Denmark is Helsingør. Before the Malmö–Copenhagen Øresund bridge was finished, most of the trans-Scandinavian traffic (transit and tourist) used the ferries between Helsingborg and Helsingør. There is still heavy traffic across the Sound here because of the high population density on either side of the border. In addition, the ferries are usually somewhat cheaper than the fees for the bridge and they often provide a shorter route compared to the bridge.

Tourist office[edit]
 Visit Helsingborg, ☏ +46 42-104350, Visit@helsingborg.se. M–F 10:00–16:00, Sa 10:00-13:00. Has several "Infopoints" scattered around the city. (updated May 2018)
Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
56.04375112.6949791 Helsingborg Central Station is in the lower level of Knutpunkten, a massive complex on the waterfront which also includes the ferry terminal.
From Malmö and Lund, there are three trains an hour to Helsingborg; the trip takes 40 minutes on the fastest routes, or just over an hour on the mauve Pågatåg local trains. Trains run hourly from Copenhagen (1¼ hours) and Kastrup Airport (1 hour) to the south, and from Göteborg (2½ hours) to the north. Hourly trains run from Hässleholm (1 hour), of which some originate in Kristianstad (1hr 20min). Tickets for these trains are issued at fixed prices by the Skånetrafiken transport authority, and are also valid on local transport at either end of the route.
Stockholm-bound travellers usually have to change to a SJ express train in Hässleholm or Lund.
An alternative route to Copenhagen is to take the ferry across to Helsingør (20 min), where the trains to the Danish capital are more frequent (45 min). This can be faster than waiting for an hourly direct train, and is also cheaper. Skånetrafiken can sell combined tickets that cover both the ferry and train.

By bus[edit]
There are regular bus services between Helsingborg and Stockholm, Copenhagen, Oslo, Gothenburg and other cities along the way towards these cities. The major bus companies are Vy (Bus4You) and Flixbus.

By car[edit]
By E4 from Stockholm in the north, and E6 from Malmö in the south and from Gothenburg/Oslo in the north.

By boat[edit]
From Helsingör, Denmark, it's a 20-minute ferry ride across the sound, with ferries departing every 15 minutes most of the day. At night, there is at least one ferry every hour.
Ferries are operated by Sundsbusserne and ForSea.

By plane[edit]
The Ängelholm-Helsingborg Airport (AGH IATA) is situated approximately 40 km from Helsingborg and has daily flights to Stockholm Arlanda Airport (SAS) and Stockholm-Bromma (Kullaflyg), weekly flights to Visby and seasonal flights to Mora.
Copenhagen Airport is about one hour away by train.

Get around[edit]
56°2′45″N 12°41′46″EMap of Helsingborg
Practically all public transport goes through the train/ferry terminal Knutpunkten (Helsingborg C), including regional and long-distance trains and buses as well as local buses.
Skånetrafiken [1][dead link] runs the local and regional bus and train system, and if you intend on spending some time in the Skåne-region it is highly recommended that you get the so-called Jojo-card which is a prepay card that gives you 20% off any ticket. Additionally a duo/family ticket will give you another 10% off (for up to 2 adults and 3 children).

By public transport[edit]
Bus is the main means of transport in town. Buses run from early morning till around midnight and a little later on Fridays and Saturdays. The city bus system (Green buses) connects most of the city and all but one (#2) stay within one fare zone. Single trip costs 19 kr, but it's not possible to pay with cash on the buses. Regional buses (Yellow buses) connect to nearby towns.
There are two further stations beyond Helsingborg C, but these are unlikely to be useful to tourists travelling within the city.

By taxi[edit]
Taxi rides are rather expensive in Helsingborg and there is little competition. They can be found right outside Helsingborg C main entrance, next to the Marina Plaza hotel.
