Understand[edit]
Market Cross, Market Place
Through the 13th and 14th centuries Flemish weavers settled in the town making it a centre for wool and weaving industries. The town flourished as evidenced by the massive parish Church of St. Nicholas. In the 18th century the church was given an appropriately massive tower (the only higher church tower in the area being Norwich Cathedral). Unfortunately enthusiasm was greater than structural engineering skills and in 1724 the day following a long bell ringing sessions with a particularly heavy set of bells, two sides of the tower collapsed! There have been plans to re-build the tower but all have been abandoned so the tower ruins can still be seen today.
The Market Cross in the centre of town was built as a base for rent collectors for the town market stalls.
Norfolk still takes great pride in the fact that Vice Admiral Horatio Lord Nelson (1771-1805) was born and brought-up in the county. He attended Paston Sixth Form College in the town until age 12 (when he went on to Norwich). He later went on to achieve many naval victories, maybe the most famous being at the Battle of Trafalgar (1805).
Today the town is mainly residential, catering for the local population.

Get in[edit]
The town lies on the A149 between Cromer (9 miles) and Great Yarmouth (25 miles). The B1145 to the west connects the town to the A140 main road to Norwich and Cromer.
Trains run hourly from Norwich, taking 25 min to North Walsham and continuing to Cromer and Sheringham. 
The 52.81691.38461 railway station  is south side of town next to the Motorcycle Museum. It's just an unstaffed platform halt, with ticket machines but no kiosk, and no toilets. There's step-free access to both platforms, though the ramp is steep for Platform 2 from Norwich towards Sheringham.
Sanders Coaches operate a number of services between the town and Norwich, Holt, Cromer, Great Yarmouth and other destinations.

See[edit]
St Nicholas Church
52.82161.38741 Church of St Nicholas. In the era when the size of your church (and in particular the height of your church tower) reflected the prosperity and status of your town, in 1924 North Walsham truly experienced "pride comes before a fall" as their 2nd highest church tower in the area collapsed; the ruins of the tower still remain today as plans to re-built have never come to fruition. However only the tower collapsed and the church is still in use and can be visited today.   (updated May 2017)
