Prora  is a site on the German Baltic Sea island of Rügen. During the Nazi era the worker's organization Kraft durch Freude (Strength through Joy) began building a huge beach resort hotel for 20,000 people at the shore of the Baltic Sea. The project was almost finished when World War II started, but it was never used as a hotel. In the East German era the site was used as a military base.
In the 1990s, parts of it were opened as a museum, but most parts of the megalomaniacal 4.5-kilometre-long building complex remained empty. Since 2005, various parts were developed to become apartments, youth hostels or event locations (such as the M3 Prora night club). Prora is also known as the Colossus of Rügen.
