See[edit]

It was actually called the Iglesia de la Inmaculada Concepción until the present one was built in 1711. Located in the colonial old town, it was designated a cathedral in 1561 and dedicated to the Virgin Mary. It displays Baroque and Renaissance Colonial architecture and has withstood earthquakes.

14.46197-87.640783 Iglesia de San Francisco, 6a Calle NO (two blocks north of the cathedral, adjoining the Plaza San Francisco). This is the second oldest church in Coyamagua, after Iglesia de la Merced, and was built in 1560 by Bishop Fray Alonso de la Cerda in the colonial old town. It was dedicated to St. Francis of Assisi. Also featuring Baroque and late colonial Renaissance architectural style, what is distinctive about this church is that it has the oldest bell in America, the Antonina Bell, having been cast in Alcalá de Henares, Spain in 1460 for a religious congregation there and then brought to New Spain (Honduras).

It is unique in that it functioned as a church for the mulattoes and indigenous peoples of the time, where the Indians had an open chapel on the back of the presbytery. Here also is where several soldiers were shot on the south side of the church for having revolted under the government of General Luis Bográn in 1886, and where Canon Don Luis Ortega Licona is buried.

Eat[edit]
 Restaurante Sabor Colonial (Colonial House Restaurant) (next to Hotel Caxa Real on Paseo Ronda de la Alameda), ☏ +504 2740-0146. Colorful and festive venue of local flavors. 
 Restaurante El Torito (Toritos Restaurant), CA-5 (on the main highway, just south of town). Toritos is probably the best restaurant in town. Known for their excellent steaks, they also serve seafood and chicken. Full bar, credit cards accepted. Air-conditioned. Secure parking. 
 Fast Food Restaurants, CA-5 (on the main highway, between the old and new boulevards). On the main highway, between the two major intersections, is a Pizza Hut, a Burger King, Dunkin' Donuts, Baskin Robbins, and a Pollo Compenero. Wendy's is about a quarter of a mile towards town, on the "old" boulevard. Go towards town at the Texaco, you'll see it on the left. 
 Golosinas. These small, inexpensive, family-run restaurants serving typical Honduran food and either fried or rotisserie chicken are on every block it seems. Food preparation in Honduras is not tightly regulated as it is in the US, so caution is on order when in any restaurant. But after being in-country for a few weeks, you should be able to eat pretty much anywhere. 
 Mang Ying, Old Blvd (4th Ave) and 7th St (turn off the main highway at Texaco, continue through town for about 1.6 km (0.99 mi)). There are many Chinese restaurants in Comayagua, most of them serving the same food, but Mang Ying is probably the best. Expect giant portions. A decent atmosphere, with large photos of Chinese landmarks and generous seating partially makes up for the fact that "American" style Chinese food, such as General Cho's Chicken, is absent from the menu. Overall, good food, prepared quickly. Air-conditioned. No credit cards accepted. Secure parking. 
 Asados La Casita, Old Blvd (Ave 4) and 1st ST, approx (from the main highway, go towards town at the Texaco, maybe 400 m (1,300 ft), on the right). Excellent family restaurant with the one of the only true grills in town (there are more than a few street food vendors around town who grill skewers of meat and white corn-on-the-cob). Grilled favorites such as steak, pork chops, sausage, and barbecue chicken are accompanied with tortillas, rice, beans, chismol, cooked plantains, and a trio of sauces in a farmhouse atmosphere. The walls are covered with original paintings depcting pastoral Honduran life, and antique Honduran tools and small farm implements that would have been used in a Honduran casita of years past. Reasonable prices. Air conditioning. Secure Parking. No credit cards accepted.
