Pemberton, and the wider Pemberton Valley, is a pretty area in the north of the Sea to Sky region of British Columbia, Canada. The valley floor is mostly agricultural, while the surrounding mountains provide climbing, mountain biking and some spectacular hiking opportunities. In 2021, the village of Pemberton was home to 3,400 people.


Understand[edit]
Farming in the Pemberton Valley
The Pemberton area is part of the traditional territory of the Lil'wat First Nation. European presence started with the Fraser Gold Rush in the 1858 with permanent non-native settlement beginning in the 1870s, but settlement was slow until the valley was connected to Vancouver by rail in 1915.  In the days of the Fraser Gold Rush Trail, steamboat and other water traffic voyaged from New Westminster via Harrison Lake  near the east end of the Fraser Valley to Port Douglas at the north end of Harrison Lake, then up a rough wagon road along the Lillooet River to the south end of Lillooet Lake, then by boat again to Port Pemberton at the Head of Lillooet Lake (near today's Mount Currie), then overland along the Birkenhead and Gates Rivers to Anderson Lake, where more boats to Seton Portage and Seton Lake landed at the head of another wagon road near Lillooet. One of the early attractions of the valley was the richness of the soil and farming continues to be important to the area. The Pemberton Valley is an important centre for seed potatoes and, more recently, organic farming, with a big Slow Food/Tere Madre movement. Pemberton is a bedroom community of Whistler.
Tourism has become more important to Pemberton, including outdoor recreation,  eco & agro-tourism. The nearby mountains and lakes provide a wealth of opportunities activities at all levels, for the most intrepid to generally being outdoors and taking in the scenery. For the outdoor enthusiast there is in the summer: biking, backpacking, boating, hiking, horse riding, golfing, & mountaineering. In the winter, there is skiing, sledding, snowmobiling, snowshoeing, snowboarding, ice climbing, hockey, skating & curling on the smaller lakes. For flight enthusiasts Pemberton is a centre of hang gliding, paragliding, gliding, skydiving, and heli-tours with the town's own airport for private planes, small jets & helicopters. The Valley hosted the Canadian Paragliding Nationals in 2012.

The village of Pemberton is small so it's easy to get around it by foot. However, travel to other parts of the Pemberton Valley or to the Provincial Parks is easiest by car or bike.

By public transit[edit]
 BC Transit (Pemberton Valley Transit System), ☏ +1-604-894-6135. Operates two bus routes daily, a multiple times per day: Local transit: $2.50 for adults, and $2 for seniors and students; Travel to or from Whistler: $4.50. (updated Apr 2022)

The highlight is the hike that winds its way past three turquoise alpine lakes to below the Matier Glacier.

The hike to the middle and upper lakes is moderately difficult with some rocky sections and an elevation gain of over 350 m. The hike one-way is 5.5 km but well worth it if you have the time.

Do[edit]
Hot Springs are plentiful and beautiful in the area. Caution: There is a phenomenon called supernatant liquid. A layer of lighter, fresh, cooler water can float on top of the denser, mineral-rich, hot-springs water. Dipping your toe into the top of the pool may deceive you. The water underneath may be hot enough to scald, and cause 2nd or 3rd degree burns. Check out the temperature below the surface first before jumping into the pool, by dipping in with a bottle on a stick or lanyard, or with a long-handled cooking-pot. Don't use your bare hands or feet.
