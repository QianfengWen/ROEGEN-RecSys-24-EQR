Understand[edit]
Uusikaupunki was founded in 1617 and is the main town of the Vakka-Suomi region. In the 19th century it was an important ship building and shipping centre. The Empire style wooden old town was built according to a plan from 1856. Among the big employers nowadays are Finland's only car factory (which produces Mercedes-Benz A-Class cars) and a shipyard (building boats and small ships). The Vakka-Suomi countryside, including countryside parts of the Uusikaupunki municipality, is described in a separate guide.
