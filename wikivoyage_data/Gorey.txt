Gorey is a market town in County Wexford. It's 41 km north of Wexford and is evolving into a commuter town for Dublin 90 km to the north; in 2016 the population was 9822. The nearby villages of Courtown and Riverchapel are beach resorts. The tourist information centre is in Market House in the town centre, open M-Sa 09:30-17:00. 
Gorey in Irish is Guaire which may mean a sandbank, the bristles of a horse, somebody's name . . . no idea frankly. 


Get in[edit]
Gorey Coat of Arms: the swan grasping an eel represents industry
Five trains a day run from Dublin Connolly, taking just under 2 hours via Dún Laoghaire, Bray, Wicklow Town, Rathdrum and Arklow. They continue from Gorey to Enniscorthy, Wexford, Rosslare Strand and Rosslare Europort the ferry terminal. A walk-up single from Dublin is €12, see Irish Rail for timetables and ticket deals. The 52.671-6.2921 railway station is 500 m south of town centre by the retail park.
By bus there's competition on the route from Dublin. Expressway Bus 2 / X2 runs hourly from Dublin Airport and Busáras via Arklow to Gorey, and continues to Enniscorthy and Wexford, adult single €11. Wexford Bus 740 also runs hourly from the airport, with several stops in central Dublin (but it doesn't use Busáras), then Arklow bypass, Gorey, Enniscorthy and Wexford; similar fares to Expressway. The 740 bypasses Wicklow Town but the 740A stops there. Gorey doesn't have a bus station, the stop is on Main St by Market Square. 
By car from Dublin follow N11 / M11 south through County Wicklow and reckon 90 min. From Rosslare ferry port take N25 towards Wexford then join N11 / M11 north.
