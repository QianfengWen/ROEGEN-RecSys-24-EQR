Athenry is a market town in County Galway with medieval town walls, castle and abbey. In Irish it's Baile Átha an Rí, town of the ford of the king. Those kings were the Ó Mainnín dynasty, ousted in the 12th C by supporters of the O'Connor kings, who in turn were ousted in the 13th C by the Anglo-Norman de Bermingham overlords. The present town still follows the Anglo-Norman street pattern, though the buildings are mostly modern. Athenry has a population (as of 2016) of 4445 and has become a commuter town for Galway 25 km west.    


Understand[edit]
The Fields of Athenry is a folk ballad written in 1979 by Pete St John. It relates the sad tale of an Athenry man who "stole Trevelyan's corn" during the Great Famine of the 1840s to try to feed his family, and was sentenced to be transported to Australia. Trevelyan (1807-86) was the senior official in Dublin who was tardy in distributing famine relief, declaring that "the judgement of God sent the calamity to teach the Irish a lesson". Let them eat maize instead, quoth he, a commodity exported in bulk from Ireland throughout the famine, but unaffordable by the peasantry. The song refers to "Botany Bay" but that was a generic term for all the penal colonies of Australia, and Fremantle would be our hero's likeliest destination. The song was original, in the style of but not adapted from earlier ballads, and in the 1980s it became an unofficial anthem of Irish sports supporters.
