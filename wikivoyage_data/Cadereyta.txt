Cadereyta (also known as Cadereyta de Montes) is a historic small town in the state of Querétaro. It is one of Mexico's Pueblos Mágicos.


Understand[edit]
Cadereyta was founded in 1640 as a Spanish administrative and military stronghold to reinforce Zimapan in its mission to pacify indigenous populations in the region, particularly the Jonaces and the Pame. This would smooth the efforts to develop the region and to enable the missionaries to do their work. The Franciscans, notably, established the eight monasteries of the Sierra Gorda region.

Botanical Garden in Cadereyta
Jardin Botanico - When life hands you lemons, you make lemonade. Most of Queretaro has a hot, dry climate and some of its endemic (and endangered) plant species are cacti and agave succulents. But the mountains of the Sierra Gorda create mountain peaks and valleys that have their own microclimates, making the state quite biodiverse with plenty of subject matter for botanists and naturalists to chat about at happy hour. The Botanical Garden in Cadereyta showcases and preserves many endemic plants. As you walk through the gardens, keep an eye out for birds and reptile species as well.
Hacienda Tovares - This colonial hacienda dates from 1640, it was the home of Capitan Alonso de Tovar, the founder of Cadereyta. It's a ranch with horses, a lake, event pavilions, a restaurant, a spa, and an upscale boutique hotel. Day passes to the property are available, as are horseback rides and entertainment.
Vivero Quinta Fernando Schmoll, Calle El Pilancón No. 1, Barrio de las Fuentes - If the Jardin Botanico just whetted your appetite to learn more about cactus and desert plants, you'll enjoy this place. It was built by Schmoll and his wife, Carolina Wagner, in 1920 to raise dry climate plants that could thrive in the semidesert climate of Queretaro.
