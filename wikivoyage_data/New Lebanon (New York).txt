The Shaker society based in New Lebanon served as the headquarters for all Shakers in the entire country, which included some 19 major communities from stretching from Indiana to Kentucky to Maine. Residents of New Lebanon and Caanan, New York, and Hancock, Massachusetts, converted to the Shaker faith in 1780, and in 1787 the new leader of the Shakers, Joseph Meacham, organized a headquarters in New Lebanon. He appointed Lucy Wright, from Pittsfield, Massachusetts, to co-equally share in the leadership responsibilities. The Shaker society at New Lebanon persisted until 1947, when the Shakers dissolved the settlement. The historic site was labeled a National Historic Landmark in 1965, and in 2004 and 2006 was listed by the World Monuments Fund as one of the 100 most endangered historic sites in the world. The museum today includes 10 original buildings, the most notable of which is the famous 1859 Great Stone Barn, which was heavily damaged in a fire in 1972 and is now undergoing a long-term restoration. The museum also hosts the most comprehensive Shaker collection in existence, having absorbed the collection of the former Shaker Museum in nearby Old Chatham.
