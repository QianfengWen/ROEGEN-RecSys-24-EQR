Not to be confused with Africa
Arica is a seaside resort town of 223,000 (2016) in Northern Chile. It's quiet, relaxed and safe, with several nice beaches and sun virtually every day of the year. Its mild weather has made Arica known as the "city of the eternal spring" in Chile while its beaches are frequented by Bolivians. This city is the northern gateway to Peru and Bolivia. 


Understand[edit]
Morro de Arica, the hill towering over the city
Arica has a mild, temperate climate with one of the lowest annual rainfall rates anywhere in the world.  You will rarely find any clouds in Arica, although the sky can sometimes be darkened with a sort of fog called camanchaca.
The city was an important port already during Spanish colonial rule. Chile seized the city from Peru in 1880 during the War of the Pacific, being recognized as Chilean by Peru in 1929. A substantial part of African Chileans live in or trace their origins to Arica.
Near the city is the Azapa Valley, an oasis where vegetables and Azapa olives are grown. Economically, it is an important port for Chilean ore. It is also a center of rail communication with Bolivia and has its own international airport. Arica has strong ties with the city of Tacna, Peru; many people cross the border daily to travel between the cities, partly because many services (for example, dentists) are cheaper on the Peruvian side. Arica is connected to Tacna in Peru and to La Paz in Bolivia by separate railway lines.

-18.47297-70.304941 Terminal Rodovario. (updated Jul 2023)
-18.47365-70.304312 Terminal Internacional. (updated Jul 2023)
Numerous buses arrive daily from centers further south in Chile. Buses from/to Iquique hourly, 7,000 pesos, taking 5 hr. Also frequent connections from/to Santiago. From/to San Pedro de Atacama 2 companies run a daily service (at night): Tur-Bus (13,000 pesos, 11 hr) and Espresso Norte (10,000 pesos, with a change in Calama).
Daily buses come in from Bolivia, La Paz, Cochabamba and Oruro. If you wish to come from Oruro, you will also have to get a bus to Patacamaya to transfer to the bus to Arica, there are no direct buses. In general, it is best to go from La Paz—they have direct buses, otherwise the transfer can be very confusing.
Colectivos (shared taxis) arrive and depart continually from Peru during the border opening hours of 08:00–22:00, taking passengers from the International Bus Terminal (about 100 m from the main bus terminal) in Arica to the International Bus Terminal in Tacna, Peru. They take 1½-2 hr and as of 2014, colectivos cost 4,000 pesos, or 18 Peruvian soles, and leave as soon as they are full (4 or 5 passengers); the driver also helps you through immigration and customs. Buses cost less, but take much longer. From the Terminal Rodovario (alongside) buses come in from other centers in Peru. There are no direct buses from Arequipa, Cusco or Puno to Arica. From Tacna however, buses go regularly to Arequipa, Lima, and Puno. For Cusco, it is necessary to change buses in either Arequipa or Puno.

See[edit]
-18.478951-70.3207251 Cathedral of San Marcos (St. Mark's Cathedral) (entry is from Plaza Colón). The magnificent church designed by Gustave Eiffel (who also designed that tower in Paris) was built in the 1870s.  It's a popular attraction.   
-18.480278-70.3236112 Morro de Arica. A steep hill that overlooks Arica from 139 m above sea level. The views from el Morro are superb. You can follow the work being done in the harbour closely or gaze at the mountains gradually turning into the altiplano in the east. The hill looks like a giant sand dune from a distance but it is in fact made of solid rock. The paved footpath visible from anywhere in town starts at the south end of Calle Colón. Allow 10 minutes for walking up, and enough time for philosophic discussions on top. There is a war museum on the hill for those into uniforms and cannons from the 19th century. Beware of the dishonest Coca Cola vending machines; bring water and snacks from town. The hill, together with the archaeological Museo de Sitio Colón 10 museum next to it and the mouth of Camarones River some 100 km south of Arica make up a world heritage site related to the pre-Columbian Chinchorro culture and their mummification practices.   
-18.478951-70.3207253 Catedral de San Marcos & Plaza Colón. The cathedral and civic heart of the city, the public square is where its residents congregate for celebrations, diversions or just being a part of the community.   (updated Jul 2023)

The mouth of Camarones river is, together with the hill and museum mentioned in #See, the third archaeological site and component in the world heritage site Settlement and Artificial Mummification of the Chinchorro Culture in the Arica and Parinacota Region. This was an important settlement during the pre-Columbian Cinchorro culture.  (updated Aug 2021)

Beaches – Swimming and sunbathing on the beaches north of town. Summer is the main season, in winter you will have the beaches for yourself. Water is cold.
Hiking – "Playa Corazones" area
Nearby valleys – Visit the olive trees plantations

Lauca National Park – Chungará Lake is the main attraction in this wilderness park surrounded by volcanoes and adjacent to the border with Bolivia. Tour operators and touts will try to grab you on the pedestrian streets in the center, but hiring a car or getting on a bus to Bolivia and getting off in Parinacota on the Chilean side or Lagunas on the Bolivian might work out cheaper.
