Greenbelt is a city in Prince George's County, Maryland.


Understand[edit]
Contained within today's City of Greenbelt is the historic planned community now known locally as "Old Greenbelt" and designated as the Greenbelt Historic District. The historic district was built during the New Deal era in 1937 and much of the original housing is now owned collectively as a cooperative. The architecture is in the Art Deco style. Greenbelt's residents take the city's history of cooperation and volunteerism seriously; as a result they organize a variety of festivals, events, performing and visual arts.
The city has three areas: Old Greenbelt is the historic area between Greenbelt Road, the Baltimore-Washington Parkway, Kenilworth Avenue and the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center. Greenbelt West includes the Beltway Plaza strip mall and the Franklin Park rental housing complex. Greenbelt East is a collection of 1990s developments and the Greenway Center. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center is within the City limits.
