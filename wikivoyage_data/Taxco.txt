Taxco is a beautiful city in Mexico built on a hill in Guerrero. It is rich with old and new silver mines in the surrounding areas with narrow winding streets and hundreds of silver shops. If you are looking for a side trip that is the place to go. Taxco is renowned for its more than baroque-style church (completed in 1758), the Santa Prisca Cathedral.


Get in[edit]
It is off the toll way (Hwy 95D) but it is worth the drive, it is between Acapulco and Mexico City. There is regular bus service to the town from Cuernavaca by Estrella Blanca.
There are also buses there from Mexico City from the South Bus Station (Autobuses del Sur). A one-way ticket costs M$130 (pesos) and they usually leave every half hour. The bus will take you through very scenic mountain views and drop you off in the middle of the town. Since it is a mountain town, you can either walk uphill to the Zocolo (square) where many shops and the famous church are, take a taxi, or any bus that says "Zocalo".

Do[edit]
Get a lot of exercise walking up the steep streets.
There is a gondola (teleferico) that can take you up to a fancy hotel called Monte Taxco, with great views and a decent bar/restaurant. There is not much else to see/do up there.
Taxco is known for its Holy Week celebration in April. [dead link]

Buy[edit]
Silver!  There is very beautiful silver, mostly all engraved with "MEXICO 925" or "TAXCO 925"  The silver shops away from the centro are where you can bargain.  You will be charmed and ecstatic at all the beautiful silver, but will get tired of looking at it in 4 hours or less.  You will also be approached by men, women, and children selling you items in the centro (plaza centrál).  If you are not interested in being bothered, do not give them any eye contact.  Once one finds you are slightly interested, all the other vendors will come try to sell their goods.

Eat[edit]
Try the Pozolé.  It is a soup-like dish of large corn pieces called hominy, pork rind/fat, avocado, and some crispy tortilla crumbles.  Try it at the top of the hill above the small covered market which sells silver.  It's cheap, tasty, and filling.  It's a great dish to try if you want to experience Mexican food. Thursdays are the traditional pozolé days during which the red and green varieties are typically served. The white style is served the other days of the week.
For adventurous diners, try the jumiles, small edible insects that are harvested from November to February and sold in the markets of Taxco. Some healers attribute painkilling and healing properties to them. They are served on a tortilla as a taco. jumiles-in-taxco [dead link]

Sleep[edit]
Hotel Casa Grande is the cheapest digs in town (US$15 for a single with shared bath).  It is a 400-year-old building just off the Plazuela and is about a block from Santa Prisca and the Zocolo.  Rooms are arranged around a courtyard, some are great, some are a little scruffy with semi-functional bathrooms, so ask to see a few.  The rooftop terrace is really great for relaxing and looking out at the city.
For a little fancier accommodations the Hotel Santa Prisca is a beautiful place with a fountain and lush court yard.
The Agua Escondida is right on the Zocalo and has a nice pool. Ask for the cheaper rooms at M$350.
 Mi Casita, Guerrero 1. Located off the plazuelita. Lovely inexpensive hotel with great views run by a nice family.
