Tourist information site[edit]
The local tourist association has a Japanese-only guide site

Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
Takahashi City can be accessed via the JR Hakubi Line from Niimi (¥580) to the north and Soja (¥410), Kurashiki (¥580), and Okayama (¥840) from the south. Get off at Bitchu Takahashi Station.

By car[edit]
Route 180 passes directly through Takahashi City, so from Okayama and Soja, travel North on Route 180. From Yonago, connect to Route 180 from the Yonago West Interchange and travel south through Niimi. From Hokuei and Kurayoshi, you travel south on Route 313, or north from Ibara. From the west, reach Takahashi on Route 484.
For travel to the Fukiya area, Route 85 takes you to the Bengara Village.

Get around[edit]
On foot[edit]
The area around Bitchu Takahashi Station is quite easy to navigate on foot. You can even walk to Bitchu Matsuyama Castle if you have the energy and time (1½ hours estimated to reach the castle on foot). Many people choose to take a taxi to the top and then walk down from the castle.

By taxi[edit]
Taxis are located just outside the station. For those who want to visit the castle, avoid walking up the mountain, and save time, taxis are highly recommended. It costs around ¥1300, but if you are traveling with others, the split cost makes it affordable.
Although taxis are a convenient and quick way to get to the Fukiya area, the 40-minute drive is quite costly.

By bus[edit]
If you choose to use the bus for travel to sites around the station, be aware that none of the buses go to the castle. The closest stop is at the bottom of the mountain.
For travel to the Fukiya area, take the Bihoku Bus from outside the station (about 1 hour). There are only 3-4 buses a day and their schedule does not really allow visiting both Takahashi center and Fukiya the same day (first departure from Takahashi at about 10:50 and last return at 15:45).

The inside of the castle does not have many artifacts however, the uniqueness of the castle and the beauty of the surrounding area more than make up for it. It has gained fame as a "Castle in the Sky" when viewed from afar surrounded by clouds (See "Do" for details on how to access the viewpoint).

Fukiya area[edit]
Fukiya's Historic Bengara Village
The Fukiya area is quite far removed from the core of the city, centered around the castle and the station. The history of the area also differs, as Fukiya was once a bustling copper mining town; the leading producer of copper in Western Honshu during the Edo and Meiji Periods. After the Meiji Period, the mines were shut down and the area fell quiet. Today, it remains a quiet and peaceful town, but remnants of its past can be seen everywhere, from the mine shafts to the village.

34.8625133.46833311 Fukiya Bengara Village. One of Japan's many remaining Edo-period villages, Fukiya is well known for the unique burnt orange color of the buildings. The color comes from bengara, a bastardized pronunciation of Bengal, where the pigment was originally produced. Some of the buildings are locally-owned shops, while others, such as the post office, can only be viewed from the outside.

In 2009 only 6 students remained in the entire school. It was known as the oldest wooden school still in use in Japan until it finally closed in 2012. The school has been preserved as an important local landmark and popular attraction for visitors. You can only view it from the outside, yet many consider it to be one of the area's highlights.

There is a viewpoint about 8.5 km from Bitchu-Takahashi Station. An early morning bus is available during peak season to take visitors to the viewpoint; however, you must make a reservation with the Tourist Information Center at least 1 day in advance.
