Old-town Wellington, with plenty to do... and eat. Use the listings below.
The little town of Wellington is 10 miles from neighboring Fort Collins, with an estimated population of 10,400 (2019). Although the urban presence of the Front Range tends to overshadow the town, it could be said that Wellington wouldn't be here without it.  Nonetheless, the town of today is a worthwhile trip of its own right, and proves the value and importance of pulling back, and feeling amazed.  


Understand[edit]
For most of Wellington's history, a real quiet western vibe hung over the small town. While nearby cities boomed, the population stayed much the same; In fact, the count was only around 500 for an entire century. 
However, urbanization is affecting the dynamic of this once quiet place. Just like Meridian, Idaho and Rio Rancho, New Mexico, urbanization from nearby larger cities is leaving a permanent mark on Wellington. As the 21st century progresses, travelers to Wellington may find that the "small town feel" to be gone. Wellington is still that calm, connected town that invites the visitor to explore.  While there maybe some divide between here and  newer sections of town, generally one could find a friendly small-town atmosphere all the way around. Always feel free to ask for help here.

When to go[edit]
Between climate and popularity, the decision can be rough. However, the autumn has reasonably cool temperatures, while the visitation  of Wellington is low. More specifically, August or September have the best conditions, and should work well with most schedules. While Wellington is not that busy, the summer months find thousands of travelers in Northern Colorado. Another option is potentially May, where some weekends are quite warm, but be careful for unexpected snowstorms.

There is one motto to sum up everything: be prepared. One moment the sun is out, the next it could be rainy or snowy. On average though, with an altitude of 5160 feet (that is just under a mile), one can expect year round  temperatures close to 50 °F (10 °C), with highs approaching 80 °F in summer, but not making it to 40 °F  often in winter. Wellington is considered to be a steppe climate (Bsk), even though the town is in the middle of a continent. That should make a statement about the humidity here. Per year, one could expect to see 16 inches of rain over a period  of only 35 days! Most of the time is sunny.
Of course, winter brings all the fury "mother nature" has to offer, and tends to close down roads. Oddly though, as mentioned previously, the highest snowfall is in spring, where a few blizzards can bring down feet of snow, just to have it melt the next day. Once again, be prepared!

History[edit]
The town of Wellington was established in 1903 along an old alignment of the Lincoln Highway, as well as the Burlington North Railroad, connecting Cheyenne to Denver. The population swelled in the 1910s, however became stagnant by the 1920s. As with every dream-filled city of the early 20th century, Wellington had high sails, and attracted a lot of business, and the gold mining helped. However, it mostly dried up, leaving the few hundred residents that stayed for over multiple decades.
In 2000, dinosaur bones were discovered near Wellington, attracting much scientific interest in the area. A new subdivision even had a street named for this finding. Between the late 20th and early 21st century, Wellington began to grow exponentially, as Fort Collins was beginning to crowd into surrounding cities, and often making it hard to draw a clear line between these cities. By the 2010s, Wellington growth skyrocketed. What used to have one traffic signal, for example, now had 4. Houses were being built in droves, businesses popped up such as Ridley's Markets, and average traffic increased three-fold. A local farm has gained attention for over-fed goats, a likely sign of prosperity in the urbanization era.

Get in[edit]

Wellington is increasingly considered a "bedroom community" being 10 minutes away from Fort Collins, and 30-40 minutes from Cheyenne. Going to Wellington from one of these cities may be much easier than directly going to Wellington when using intercity bus transportation. 

By plane[edit]
There seems to be several low-maintence grass fields around Wellington, such as the Burnham Field and the Kellogg Airstrip, and these are most likely private, but there are no airports. There is some small ones outside of wellington.

By car[edit]
The only real way to get into Wellington is by car as it is an automobile-based town.

I-25 connects Wellington with a great collection of cities from Denver to Casper. There is construction south of town, and occasional traffic jams from Fort Collins and Denver.
CO-1 is a state road that comes into Wellington from the west, and connects with US 287 near Fort Collins. Always watch for winter road closures, however this route can be more preferable in summer for the scenery.
By bus[edit]
You cannot directly enter Wellington this way, however If you take a bus to Fort Collins, and rent a car there (or the same with I-25 cities such as Loveland, Cheyenne, or Denver), then this could lower your travel costs. Additionally, some companies will make stops in Wellington, however be prepared to request it and possibly pay more.

Get around[edit]
As in any small town, there are few options.

By foot[edit]
The very walkable old town, that can sometimes be vibrant.
The original settlement of Wellington is very walkable. Most everything about the early town can be found within a few blocks. Also, parts of newer Wellington is not far, and can be a great way to explore. Consider the foot path between Jefferson Ave and County Road 60 for a walk you'll never forget. (And it's convienent)

By car[edit]
Numbered streets are orientated north to south, and increase to the east (i.e., 6th street is closer to I-25 than 4th street), and named streets are oriented west to east. Interestingly, most early streets are named for presidents (such as Cleveland Ave, Jefferson Street, Hamilton Road). You may may be stuck on Cleveland Avenue for a minute or two at the I-25 bridge. Most hotels and gas stations are on Cleveland or 6th.

By taxi[edit]
Service can be few and far in between, and can be even more sporadic at night. Taxis generally come from Fort Collins or another city.

Stay safe[edit]
As a bedroom community, the crime risk is higher than the same size town that is separate, but not by much , as Wellington is very rural yet. The true danger lies in the weather. Wellington is slightly under the "one-mile" marker of Denver. Altitude sickness and dehydration can become problematic for the tourist, and thus lots of fluids and rest is good for combatting the symptoms. Also, the weather can be quite unpredictable (see "Understand") . As in the rest of the United States, phone 911 for emergencies, and 511 for road info. For medical problems, the best bet is UC health in Fort Collins. However, if you have a small injury or property loss, you can contact the fire department:

40.7033-105.00481 Wellington Fire Department, 8130 3rd Street. A volunteer fire department. (updated May 2019)

Connect and cope[edit]
While Wellington is a friendly place, its size doesn't allow for international services, or much way of coping. The nearest consulates are in Denver. Here are a few ways to get by.
Officially, the area code is 970 in Northern Colorado, and is useful in most of Wellington, though there is some oddities, such as the use of 303/720 around Denver. When calling to nearby states, or around colorado, ensure to use: 719 for Colorado Springs, 307 for Wyoming, where many Colorado companies have their operations in 308/402 for Nebraska, 505/575 for New Mexico. For information numbers, see "Stay Safe" above. The zipcode for Wellington is 80549.

Where in Colorado...
Fort Collins is a 10 miles south, and Wellington is often combined with the city. With over 130,000 people, and Colorado State Universtity, and straddling the Front Range on one side with the Great Plains on the other, there is plenty to be found in this bustling city.
Greeley, home to the annual Greeley Stampede, is a modern city that retains it's western feel and hospitality. Walk the streets or drive around this 100,000 population city to experience a place where old and new meet. Off of US-34 at Loveland, it is one of the largest cities without an interstate, but to residents it is part of the charm.
Loveland seems to be stuck between Fort Collins and Longmont. One might be surprised that for all the shopping it has although the population is only around 70,000.
Denver: The crown jewel of Colorado, the state's largest city, (population 700,000), and the state capital. Where does it all begin, and end? Perfect for tourists and enthusiasts alike, the skyscrapers, the mall, the sports, and the parks are just a fraction of what Denver has to offer, and not all could be accomplished in one trip, with events and hidden gems throughout the city. While rush-hour traffic that ends up miles from Denver metro seems paradoxical (and frustrating), good things come to those who wait the 5-15 minutes, as visitors to Denver will soon find out.
Cheyenne is the grand entry point for Southeast Wyoming, and is a good tourist destination for all ages that is just north of the border, about 30 minutes away. With a medium sized population (67,000), Cheyenne continues to keep the Western spirit alive. During the last week of July, this spirit roars in Cheyenne Frontier Days, which attracts crowds of over 200,000, and provides anything from parades to rodeo to music. However Cheyenne is not just CFD, as the Botanical Gardens, Depot Museum, and more keeps people entertained for days.
Rocky Mountains: When one is tired of visiting the cities, or looking for something authentic, the very scenic Rocky mountains is only an hour's drive from most Front Range towns and cities, and will leave you wanting to come back for more natural beauty. Skiing is possible in many slopes near Aspen and Vail, and many Rocky Mountain towns offer gambling.
