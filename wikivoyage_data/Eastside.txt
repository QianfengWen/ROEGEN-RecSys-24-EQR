The Eastside of Los Angeles is the sprawling region of the city east of the Los Angeles River. It covers many distinct and vibrant neighborhoods, from East LA--the center of Latino culture in the city--at the southern end to hilly Eagle Rock at the north. Even though much of the area sits within sight of the Downtown skyline, it has a very local character that most visitors to LA don't experience.
This page covers the various communities of the Eastside (East LA, City Terrace, Boyle Heights, Lincoln Heights, and El Sereno) that sit just east of Downtown, as well as the neighborhoods of Northeast LA (Atwater Village, Cypress Park, Eagle Rock, Glassell Park, Highland Park, Montecito Heights and Mount Washington).


Understand[edit]
The Eastside of Los Angeles was originally settled in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, starting with the neighborhoods immediately across the river from Downtown LA. For much of its history, it has contained many of Los Angeles' ethnoburbs: Lincoln Heights once had a substantial Italian-American population, and Boyle Heights used to have substantial Jewish, Eastern European, and Japanese populations, although both are predominantly Latino today.
Lincoln Heights and Boyle Heights are directly east of Downtown and among the oldest neighborhoods in the city, with lots of turn-of-the-century houses and apartments and old business districts lining the main streets. Boyle Heights, along with its eastern neighbor East Los Angeles, are often considered the heart of Latino culture in Los Angeles. Both are predominantly Mexican-American and are home to many Spanish-speaking businesses and locally-oriented celebrations. Both neighborhoods figure massively in Mexican-American cultural identity: This was where the Chicano Moratorium protests of the 1960s and 1970s took place, Whittier Boulevard through East LA was the birthplace of lowrider culture, and many of the most popular cultural depictions of Latinos, from Colors to Stand and Deliver, were set here. The gangs that once dominated local news stories here in the 1990s have since cooled off; nowadays the bigger concern is the encroaching gentrification spreading from Downtown LA. City Terrace and El Sereno are two quiet neighborhoods perched on the hills along Interstate 10 east of Lincoln Heights, home to the campus of Cal State University Los Angeles.
Northeast LA is a very hilly region with lots of charming old neighborhoods set within the rolling hills, and historically a more bohemian character--although this is also being threatened by gentrification. Cypress Park, Glassell Park, and Atwater Village sit along the LA River and Interstate 5 north of Lincoln Heights, with Atwater Village being the subject of much real estate interest given its proximity to Glendale, Los Feliz and Griffith Park. Along the Arroyo Seco northwest of Lincoln Heights, which parallels Highway 110 and the Metro Gold Line, are Montecito Heights, Mount Washington, and Highland Park, which contain a lot of beautiful Craftsman-style houses along with the more common Mediterranean and Spanish Revival styles typical of Los Angeles. Montecito Heights and Mount Washington are both hilltop neighborhoods, with many streets built at an incline and many instances of stairways. Highland Park is set within a small valley on the way to Pasadena and has become a local center of nightlife, with a couple of really charming business districts along Figueroa Street and York Blvd that are home to some wonderful local shops and restaurants. Eagle Rock sits further to the north, between Glendale and Pasadena, and has another nice business district along Colorado Blvd and is home to the Occidental College, a fairly prestigious liberal arts college.

Get in[edit]
The Mariachi Plaza Station on the Metro Gold Line
Six freeways serve the Eastside of Los Angeles.  Interstate 5 parallels the Los Angeles River in Atwater Village, Glassell Park, Cypress Park and Lincoln Heights, before veering east in Boyle Heights.  U.S. Route 101 and California State Route 60 also have a few exits in Boyle Heights before ending at the East Los Angeles Interchange.  Interstate 10 runs for a few miles between Boyle Heights and Lincoln Heights.  California State Route 110 (the Arroyo Seco Parkway) parallels the Arroyo Seco through Northeast LA. California State Route 2 runs north-south through Glassell Park and along the edge of Eagle Rock.
The Eastside and Northeast Los Angeles are served by the Metro  Line train, which also serves Union Station in Downtown Los Angeles. The Gold Line has been split into two segments, in preparation for the completion of a new subway tunnel that will allow through-travel under Downtown to the south and west sides of the city. In the meantime, the segment that serves the Eastside makes three stops in East Los Angeles (on 3rd Street at Atlantic, East LA Civic Center, and Maravilla) and four stops in Boyle Heights (along 1st Street at Indiana, Soto, Mariachi Plaza, and Pico/Aliso), with shuttle buses completing the connection from Pico/Aliso station to Downtown until the new subway is finished. The segment that serves Northeast LA travels up from Union Station and makes stops at Lincoln/Cypress (at Avenue 26), Heritage Square, Southwest Museum, and Highland Park (at Avenue 57) before continuing northeast to Pasadena and into the San Gabriel Valley.
A number of bus lines connect the Eastside to Downtown.  These include Metro Bus Lines 18, 30, 62, 66, 70, 71, 76, 78, 79, 81, 83, 84, 94, 378, 794, and Montebello Bus Lines 40 and 50 (see below for timetables).  The Metro Silver Line bus has one stop near the USC+LAC Medical Center, and another at Cal State University Los Angeles.  The CSULA Silver Line station is also a Metrolink station.
