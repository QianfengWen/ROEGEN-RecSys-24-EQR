The self-proclaimed "Moose Capital of Canada", Hearst is a town of 5,500 people (2016) in Northern Ontario. It is named after William Howard Hearst, the seventh Premier of Ontario.


Understand[edit]

Hearst has a long tradition of being a lumber town. The major employers include a Tembec hard and soft wood facility, and a plywood mill operated by Columbia Forest Products.

History[edit]
The town was built because of the construction of the National Transcontinental Railway in 1913 (now the Canadian National Railway). Established as a divisional point, Hearst is 208 km west of Cochrane and 201 km east of the divisional point of Grant. There is some historical ambiguity with the name Grant as the original site of Hearst was also called Grant and was changed to Hearst in 1911.
Hearst was named to honour William Howard Hearst, then Ontario Minister of Forests and Mines and later Premier of Ontario. It was incorporated in 1922. Many settlers to the town came from the province of Quebec. Many also came from Europe and other regions in Canada and the USA.

Get in[edit]

Hearst has Highway 11 (Trans-Canada Highway) passing through it.  Highway 11 runs northwest from North Bay.  This route was extended from Hearst through Geraldton to Nipigon in 1943, as a final gravel link which enabled the first complete trip across Canada by motorcar in 1946. This road is now a two-lane paved provincial highway.
