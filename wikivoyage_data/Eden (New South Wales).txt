M-Sa 9.15AM-3.45PM, Su 11.15AM-3.45PM, longer hours late Dec to late Jan, closed Christmas Day. The lovably janky museum showcases Eden's history and heritage. It has exhibits on whaling, fishing and timber working. Pride of place goes to the skeleton of orca (killer whale) "Old Tom", leader of the pod of orcas that cooperated with humans in hunting and killing whales. Old Tom's skeleton is apparently the only complete killer whale skeleton on display in the Southern Hemisphere. Adults $15, children $5.   (updated Oct 2016)
Do[edit]
Whale watching at appropriate times of the year particularly during May-November.
Mount Imlay National Park[edit]
-37.165149.7511111 Mount Imlay National Park is around 40 km (25 mi) south/southwest of Eden, but it is only accessible via unpaved roads. Its only attraction of note, Balawan, holds deep significance to the Indigenous Bidwell people.
Balawan can be hiked via the Balawan Summit Walking Track, which is 6 km (3.7 mi) return, but very challenging (rated Grade 5) – the birdlife from up the top of the hike makes it worth it.
