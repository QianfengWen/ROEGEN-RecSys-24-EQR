Holašovice is a small village in South Bohemia, located 15 km from the region capital, České Budějovice. Listed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, Holašovice is the best example of something called "Selské Baroko (village barocco)", which means very strongly decorated and colorful village houses from 19th century. You can seen houses similar to houses in Holašovice in many villages and towns in Czech Republic - the uniqueness of Holašovice is in preserved state of the buildings, their number, and the fact that there are no newer buildings on the main square. As such, the main square with these well decorated and maintained buildings looks really magnificent. 


Understand[edit]
In 19th century, there was a strong movement to promote and revive Czech culture in all Czech lands. Part of this movement reflected at many Czech, mostly South Bohemian villages in crating something called "Selské Baroko (village barocco)". This is a unique architecture movement, combining Barocco and Classicism. The main feature of this architecture movement are well decorated and colorful village squares and building. Holašovice are the best example of this movement in all Czechia.
Today, the buildings and the village square remain in a state similar to which they were built in the 19th century and are very well maintained. This is partly due the fact that the government does not allow almost any new construction at the square. The village is however swarmed by tourist wanting to see a village that made it to the UNESCO list. 
Even though that the main square is beautiful and very photogenic, there is probably no reason to stay here longer than few hours as the village is small. Unless of course you want to explore the nearby countryside by foot or bike, in which case it is good to consider staying in nearby villages and towns, as they might have cheaper accommodation.
