The main access to Girdwood is along the Seward Highway, it is a very scenic drive but can be slow during peak summer travel times.
There is a train from Anchorage to Girdwood 
Girdwood does have a small landing strip/airport in town but it is primarily used as a base of operations for local heli-skiing guide companies and given the length of the runway it is suitable for only small prop planes; thus ruling out air travel as a method for getting to town.   This means almost everyone who comes to Girdwood including Alaskan locals come in by car or shuttle.  For those originating farther a field the closest major airport is the Ted Stevens International Airport in Anchorage.  The airport is served by most major airlines and can be reached on non-stop flights from such major US cities as Denver, Seattle, and San Francisco.  If not renting a car, prior to arrival one should arrange shuttle travel to Girdwood and have them meet you at the airport.
By bus Girdwood is 40 miles or 1 hours ride from Anchorage, it is served by the Seward bus line[dead link].

Get around[edit]
The Alyeska Resort Hotel provides a shuttle from the hotel to the Seward Highway.  Given this situation, the tiny nature of the town and that a shuttle is an easy option from Anchorage there is no desperate need for a rental car.

Stay safe[edit]
Crime is not much of a concern in Girdwood and the surrounding area; however, as is the case in all of Alaska, mother nature is less amiable. Threats include: bears, floods, and weather.  Snowstorms blow in quickly and can cause power outages that may last days depending on the remoteness of your location, as well as block off roads with several feet of snow that may fall in a single night. Bring extra food, just in case, and always carry chains in your car as the road restrictions can come up quickly.
Do not feed the bears. Do not leave food or food wrappers in your car.

Go next[edit]
