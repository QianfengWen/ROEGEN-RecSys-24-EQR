Batu Karas is a small fishing village in the East Parahyangan region on the south coast of Java, about an hour's drive from the popular seaside resort of Pangandaran.


Understand[edit]
Surfers at Batu Karas beach, just before sunset.
Western tourism is booming in Batu Karas mostly due to the beginner surf break, noted as the best place to learn to surf in Indonesia by Lonely Planet.  The break is, unfortunately, quite crowded and lacks the power that more experienced surfers will desire from Indonesian surf.
If you plan on surfing here in Indonesia's cooler months, consider bringing a springsuit or light wetsuit as the water may be chilly. Moreso, it can serve as protection against jellyfish and bluebottles, both of which occasionally swarm the beach. Reef booties are not necessary for the reef break, but they do sell them in one of the surf shops in town.
Women should note that this place is different from Bali: lounging around in bikinis is not really common practice yet. This is a Muslim area, albeit a very laid back one, and dress accordingly.

Get in[edit]
By motorbike[edit]
Ojeks in Pangandaran charge around 100,000 rupiah for the 1-hour drive to Batu Karas. Alternatively, you can rent a motorbike in Pangandaran for 50,000 per day, offsetting the transportation cost and having freedom to access the local beaches and attractions on your own. Be very careful for potholes, especially on the first half of the road after leaving Pangandaran.

By car[edit]
Roadworks at the road between Pangandaran and Batu Karas.
By car, the trip from Pangandaran to Batu Karas usually takes about 1 hour, via Cijulang. Parts of the road are quite bumpy, as trucks and heavy rain have their effects on the road conditions. As there are also frequent road construction and improvement works, the road conditions change frequently.

By bus[edit]
Batu Karas is approximately 1.5 hours from Pangandaran by using local public transport. From Pangandaran, you will first need to take a blue-coloured angkot (public minivan) to Cijulang (1 hour, about Rp10,000). From there, you can hire an ojek (motorcycle taxi) to Batu Karas. You will need to negotiate the price with the ojek rider, but commonly this is about Rp10,000-20,000. The shortest way from Cijulang to Batu Karas (about 20 minutes) is via a bamboo bridge, but nowadays there is also a paved road, using a detour.
Getting by public transport to Batu Karas from other destinations, such as Jakarta, Bandung, or Yogyakarta, requires to get to Pangandaran first. The nearest railway station is in Banjar.

Ojek (motorcycle taxis) are the only public transport option in Batu Karas. You can also hire a motorbike by yourself for about Rp40,000-60,000 per day. The village itself is small and you can easily go around by foot, so there is no pressing need for a scooter unless you want to explore the surrounding surf breaks or the countryside.

See[edit]
The main things to see in Batu Karas are the beaches, the surf break, and local village life. The beaches in Batu Karas are surprisingly clean by Indonesian standards. If you go out of the village, in eastern/southeastern direction from the main beach, you can find some nice secluded black sand beaches. Be mindful of jellyfish in calmer waters. At night, you can check for glowing blue phosphorescence on the beach. Tours to nearby sights, such as the Green Canyon, can be arranged at the local warungs.

-7.73506108.4563381 Green Canyon (Cukang Taneuh), Jalan Raya Cijulang-Green Canyon (6 km from Batu Karas, on the way to Cijulang). Sa-Th 07:30-16:00, F 13:00-16:00. Go by boat through beautiful jungle on a river of green-coloured brackish water. At the end of the navigable section of the river, there are beautiful waterfalls and rocks to jump off. In case of heavy rain, the water of the river turns brown for one or two days and the experience is not as nice. Entrance Rp12,500 per person; chartering a small boat (5 persons) about Rp100,000 per hour. (updated Oct 2016)
Citumang (Green Valley) http://citumang.com - jln. Raya sukamanah Desa bojong kec. parigi no 102 (about 45 minutes northeast of Batu Karas.) 6am-5pm.

A guide (Rp75,000) and life vest (Rp20,000) are not required but a life vest is recommended for all but the strongest swimmers (remember staying afloat in freshwater is much more difficult than saltwater). Food and life vests are available by Parking 1; follow the walkway upriver to the entrance by Parking 2. You will walk about 15 minutes until you reach a picnic area to begin your journey. You can walk further to a cement staircase which leads to a few more waterfalls, including one deadly but impressive fall into a cave (be very careful to not go over this one!).
Do[edit]
Learning to surf is the main attraction in Batu Karas. The beach has a -7.74891108.502531 soft right-hand surf break that is perfect for learning, aside from the ever-growing crowds. There are two main areas for surfing: one sandy area at the south end of the cove, and a more intermediate reef on the north part of the beach. There are a few other more advanced breaks in the area though swell consistency is not as strong as in other parts of Indonesia. There is a beach about 30 minutes away with a left-hand break that surfers some opt to visit as well, ask a local for directions.
Surfboards can be rented on the main beach for Rp50,000-75,000 per day, with cheaper rates for longer rental periods. Rental board quality is quite standard, but the softness of the wave means most rentals are longboards.
Fishing trips can be organised as well.

Buy[edit]
Several small warung along the beach, selling basic supplies such as water and soft drinks.
There is a 24-hour ATM (BNI) in Batu Karas, at the intersection where Jl. Batu Karas intersects with the beach road.
The ubiquitous Alfamart and Indomaret convenience stores have not descended upon Batu Karas yet. This means you will need to bargain with the local warungs for basic supplies. A large bottle of mineral water should be no more than Rp5,000, a bottle of cola should cost no more than Rp5,000, and a Bintang beer should be no more than Rp30,000. Cigarettes can be purchased at the local warungs at the end of the beach, directly across the street from the surf break. You'll also find some clothing shops in this parking lot area. There is also a pharmacy with limited supplies in the area, ask for directions from a local.
There are a couple of surf shops selling new boards, board shorts, wax, sunscreen and other basic surf necessities.

Eat[edit]
There are several options along the main beach strip, most of them serving a similar menu. BK Homestay serves the a good oatmeal for breakfast, thought you might want to just head up to the counter to place your order as the service is really awful. Shelter has real coffee with real milk at Rp10,000 per cup. Popeye's is a good option, serving both local and western dishes.  It is located in the parking area for the main beach, across from Teratai Bungalows. On weekends, head to Bayview over the hill for excellent (but a bit pricey) seafood. And if you're on a budget, walk all the way to the end of the beach, directly across the surf break, for a row of small family owned warungs serving mie goreng, soto ayam or baso for under Rp15,000 per plate. Wooden House has a fantastic buffet style lunch where you can load up your plate for Rp15,000 (with 1 piece of chicken or fish) or 20,000 (with 2 pieces of chicken or fish).

Help yourself and get rice from the rice cooker and serve yourself whatever you like from the buffet. The menu changes daily. The food quality clearly tops the average street warung. Rp15,000 (vegan)–25,000 (chicken). (updated Aug 2022)

Nights out in Batu Karas usually end by 22:00 and are essentially limited to bonfires on the beach accompanied by Bintangs from the local warungs. Most places sell cold Bintang beer bottles for Rp25,000 (small) or Rp40,000 (large).

Wi-Fi is limited in Batu Karas though more and more locations offer it.

BK Homestay, Java Cove are among many spots in the main beach area of Legok Pari that offer Wi-Fi, but service is unreliable in some of these locations and there are frequent password changes to prevent abuse.

Go next[edit]
A popular option for tourists, who go overland across Java from west to east, is to continue to Yogyakarta. In the local warungs in Batu Karas, transport is offered to Yogya (often involving a car with driver to Banjar and a train ticket from Banjar to Yogyakarta). The prices charged for this are often much higher than what you would pay if you would go by yourself (Rp 350,000 for the transfer and economy train). Pickup is at 07:00 for the transfer to the economy train and 09:00 for the business-class train. Going by yourself involves taking an ojek to Cijulang, an angkot to Pangandaran, a bus to Banjar, and another angkot or ojek from Banjar bus terminal to the railway station, before boarding the train to Yogya.
