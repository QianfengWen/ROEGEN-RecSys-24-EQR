Llanelli is a large town in Carmarthenshire that sums up everything that South Wales was historically about: Rugby Union, religious nonconformity, proud preservation of the Welsh language, metal-bashing of steel for car production and tinplate for tin cans — and brownfield desolation when this industry declined. Aside from industry, Llanelli is also renowned for its pottery, which has a unique cockerel hand-painted on each item. A collection of this pottery can bee seen at the Llanelli Museum in Parc Howard.

Parc Howard Museum
Llanelli is a base for visiting scenic areas such as the Millennium Coastal Path and Pembrey Country Park.


Understand[edit]
Llanelli remains industrial, and is a commuter town for Swansea 10 miles east; its population in 2019 was estimated to be 26,000. Llanelli people are sometimes nicknamed "Turks", for uncertain reasons. One theory is that many Turkish sailors once called at the port on their voyages.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Pembrey Airport, 7 km from the town, serves private flights only.

By car[edit]
Llanelli is linked with the M4 motorway via the A4138, and with Swansea via the Loughor Bridge on the A484. 

By bus[edit]
Llanelli is served by regular local bus services between Swansea and Carmarthen and National Express Coaches between many major UK destinations.

On foot[edit]
Walking is the best way to get around Llanelli as it is not a large city like Swansea.

By bike[edit]
The town has a small network of bike paths, though they may not always take you on the most direct route. The town connects with Routes 4 and 47 of the National Cycle Network. Opposite the railway station is a Brompton foldable bike hiring facility.

By bus[edit]
Buses in Llanelli are operated by First Cymru. Tickets can be bought on board or via the First Bus app. Cash, card, and contactless are accepted on board. You can be fined for not having a ticket. Discounts up to 30% are available for 16-21 year olds carrying a mytravelpass card. Buses to Swansea run quite reliably. Local services stop late into the evening. 

By train[edit]
Llanelli is on the Heart of Wales line. It has direct connections to the surrounding villages of Bynea and Llangennech, though these areas are mostly residential so you probably won't find yourself travelling there. If you do plan on travelling to either village, plan ahead - trains on this rural line can be cancelled at short notice.

By taxi[edit]
Taxis and Private Hire Vehicles (PHVs) in Llanelli are licensed by Carmarthenshire County Council. They are few and far between; even getting one from the railway station can be a challenge. If you must get one, your best bet is to book in advance. 
Taxi ranks are available in the town centre near the Ffwrnes Theatre, though these are regularly empty. 
You are unlikely to get scammed using a licensed taxi in Llanelli. If you feel you have been, or you want to complain for another reason, note down the registration and contact the https://www.carmarthenshire.gov.wales/ Council].
