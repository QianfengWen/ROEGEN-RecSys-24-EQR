Agua Prieta is a city of 91,000 people (2020) in Sonora on Mexico's border with the United States across from Douglas, Arizona.


Understand[edit]
The name comes from the word ópata bachicuy, which means 'black water'. This is due to the fact that in the place, the water with which the ranchers of the late nineteenth century watered their cattle turned dark, due to the nature of the terrain.
Its territory is generally mountainous, located between the foothills of the Sierra Madre Occidental with nearby mountains such as Agua Prieta, San Bernardino, Guadalupe, Gallardo, Pitáicachi, La Cabullona, ​​San Luis and Xitahueta. It is in the basin of the Yaqui River. The Punta de Agua stream, which rises in the San José mountain range, in the Naco municipality, penetrates its territory, continuing east until it joins the Agua Prieta river; this and the Cajón Bonito stream join the Batepito river, which continues south, to discharge into the Bavispe river.
Among the main industries are the maquiladoras: it has 33 maquiladoras that employ around 14,000 people, whose main lines of business are: clothing, wooden furniture, electronics , material and equipment for hospitals, sports, and computer components for radio communication and television, among others.
The Agua Prieta II Solar Thermal Project is an integrated combined cycle solar system (ISCCS) with solar parabolic trough technology. Agua Prieta II is the first plant of its kind to enter the electricity market in Mexico and Latin America.
