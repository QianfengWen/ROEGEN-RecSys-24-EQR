Today the town offers recreational activities including skiing, water sports, climbing and exploring.  Whitefish Mountain Resort to the north of town offers excellent skiing in the winter, and Glacier National Park to the east is a major hiking and camping destination. Flathead Lake to the south is the largest freshwater lake west of the Mississippi and features many opportunities for water sports and boating.
