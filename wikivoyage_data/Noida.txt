Noida (Hindi: नोएडा Noeḍā), an abbreviation of New Okhla Industrial Development Authority, is a suburban city of Delhi just across the state line in Uttar Pradesh.


Understand[edit]
Just across the Yamuna River from Delhi, this is Uttar Pradesh's most modern city and a popular location for businesses looking to escape Delhi's congestion and steep rents. Noida boasts the best roads in the National Capital Region (NCR), with excellent street lighting and cat-eyes which ensure maximum visibility during the night.
This article also covers Greater Noida, which was built in 1991 as an eastern extension of Noida.

Get in[edit]
By public transit[edit]
The easiest way to go to Noida by public transport is to take the Blue Line  3/4  which has numerous stops around the city. The Magenta Line  8  also connects Noida and links Terminal 1D, Indira Gandhi International Airport (DEL IATA). It takes around an hour to travel between DEL and Noida.
The other alternatives are DTC (Delhi Transport Corporation) and UPSRTC (Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation) buses.

By taxi[edit]
Mobile-based transport services like Uber and Ola are quite popular among the locals to move around.

By car[edit]
The DND Flyway toll bridge connects Noida to Delhi and is a pleasure to drive.  Note that if you're driving a black-plated commercial vehicle — in particular, a rented car — you're not allowed to use the bridge unless you've already paid the Uttar Pradesh road tax of ₹240/day (there are no facilities for paying it here).
The Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE) and the Western Peripheral Expressway (WPE) make a loop around Delhi connecting Noida to cities around Delhi as a bypass, especially for trucks to decrease pollution there. In particular, Faridabad and Ghaziabad can be reached via this road.

28°31′12″N 77°25′48″EMap of Noida



By public transit[edit]
While the Delhi Metro also has a couple of stops in the city, Noida has its own metro system, known as the Noida Metro. Its Aqua Line connects the city's geographic centre to Greater Noida.
Noida is also spottily connected by buses and rickshaws. The buses are chiefly from Delhi.

By taxi[edit]
The best option for getting around by taxi is to book it online by online car rental company's like Global Tour & Travels where you have the luxury of choosing from a variety of options. They provide services to travel intra-city and also for visiting Jaipur, Agra (Taj Mahal) and other places in and around Noida.

See[edit]
A scenic relief from Delhi, Noida is low on traffic and pollution (by Indian standards) and is dotted with parks and statues, none of them particularly noteworthy though. The city has done very well to keep up the green cover and the plantation of trees is done from time to time.
