The Workshops Rail Museum in North Ipswich
Ipswich is the westernmost city of the Greater Brisbane region in South East Queensland, 44 km west of the City of Brisbane. It had a population of 232,000 in 2021.


Understand[edit]
When the Moreton Bay convict settlement was established by Britain, Ipswich was about as far as craft could venture up the Brisbane and Bremer Rivers, and as coal was found here, there was very early European settlement. Because of the coal mines, Ipswich was seen as primarily an industrial centre, however these days Ipswich is more seen as a satellite of Brisbane. 
There are still the railway industries, Swanbank power station and RAAF Amberley, but the city has expanded substantially because of its part in the massive expansion of South East Queensland as a very desirable place to live. 
For the visitor on the way to Sydney on the Cunningham Highway or Toowoomba on the Warrego Highway, the bypass is usually taken, however the inquiring visitor will find much of interest in this city of 232,000 people (2021).

Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
Ipswich can be reached from Brisbane via the Caboolture via Brisbane to Ipswich line. This takes approximately an hour and 10 minutes from Roma Street Station. (note that Ipswich and surrounding stations have some of the highest crime rates in Queensland - take caution travelling alone and/or at night.)

By car[edit]
Ipswich is served by three motorways, though one of them isn't really a "motorway":

M2 Logan Motorway from Logan City
M5/A5 Centenary Motorway/Highway from Brisbane
M15 Cunningham Highway southwest from Warwick and from the New England region of New South Wales.
The M2/A2 Warrego Highway also passes by Ipswich from Toowoomba and other Outback Queensland towns northwest.
