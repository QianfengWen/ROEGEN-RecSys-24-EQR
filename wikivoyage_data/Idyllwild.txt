Get in[edit]
Map of Idyllwild


By car[edit]
Most visitors to Idyllwild will arrive by car.  Idyllwild is reachable by three main routes.  Highway 74 connects Hemet to Idyllwild in about 30 minutes driving.  Highway 243 connects to Banning and Interstate 10.  Highway 74, known as the Palms to Pines highway, also connects the desert communities of Palm Springs and Palm Desert to Idyllwild via a scenic route that passes through many ecological zones and spectacular landscapes.

By foot[edit]
It is possible to reach Idyllwild by hiking 10 miles from the top of the Palm Springs Tramway.  This is perhaps the most stunning route to the town.  Be sure to have a car waiting at Humber Park, or arrange for a ride to town, as it is another couple miles from the trailhead to the center of town.
The Pacific Crest Trail, which extends along the west coast from the Mexico border to Canada, passes by Idyllwild.  Idyllwild is a good place to stop for supplies, and maybe a shower and clean bed.

Get around[edit]
Much of Idyllwild can be visited by walking, though a car is useful to get to trailheads, and some of the hotels and rental cabins are located a bit outside the center.  Occasionally a horse-drawn cart transports visitors between the main attractions in the town center.

See[edit]
The views from town are beautiful.  Tahquitz peak and rock are probably the most photographed.  Marion mountain is also visible from town.  Panoramas of Hemet and the greater Los Angeles area are visible from many lookouts near town. You can even see the Pacific Ocean on a clear day.
The center of town is full of shops, art galleries, restaurants, and a movie theater.
There is a world class secondary arts school, the Idyllwild Arts Academy that frequently offers free gallery exhibitions, classical music concerts, and theater performances on campus.
The local newspaper, the Town Crier, provides local news and a calendar of events.
Idyllwild TV lets you see the town, its people, events and natural attractions from the eyes of locals and tourists.

Do[edit]
Events[edit]
 Jazz in the Pines. There is an annual outdoor jazz festival held in late summer. 
Rock Climbing[edit]
Idyllwild has world class rock climbing on Tahquitz Rock (sometimes referred to as Lily Rock), and Suicide Rock.  Tahquitz Rock has longer climbs, some of them 6 pitches.  Suicide Rock has mostly 2 pitch climbs.  Both offer a range of difficulty and excellent views.

Hiking[edit]
There is an extensive, well maintained trail network throughout the San Jacinto mountains. These are administered by the San Bernadino National Forest, and the San Jacinto State Park. Pick up permits at the rangers station in the center of town before leaving. Permits are recognized by both the National Forest and State Park.
Recommended hikes:

 Ernie Maxwell Scenic Trail. This is a relatively short and mostly level trail for a relaxing walk through the woods. It's accessible from Humber Park and ends at a road a couple miles to the south. Most hikers walk part way and then turn back. 
33.7559-116.6761 Tahquitz Peak. Excellent views and a lookout tower. It takes about 4 hours round trip via Humber Park and Saddle Junction, or via South Ridge Trail.   
 San Jacinto Peak. The highest peak in the range, over 10,800 feet elevation. It is about 7-8 hours round trip, and has a lot of elevation gain. An easier way to reach the peak is via the Palm Springs Tramway, but the Idyllwild route is a beautiful and less traveled way to do it. 
Buy[edit]
There are over 15 art galleries in Idyllwild representing over 200 artists.  Nomad Ventures sells rock climbing and other outdoor equipment.
