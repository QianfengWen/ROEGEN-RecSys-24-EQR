Stockton-on-Tees is an industrial town in County Durham in northeast England, straddling the River Tees. In 2021 it had a population of about 85,000. 
From 1974 to 1996 Stockton was part of a new county, Cleveland. When that was abolished, Stockton returned to County Durham, except for the southern rural district of Yarm, which was re-assigned to North Yorkshire. 


Understand[edit]
Stockton was a Saxon farming settlement that morphed into a port on the tidal River Tees, but remained small until around 1800. It then burgeoned with industry and shipping powered by the Durham coalfields and Eston Hills iron ores, with steel furnaces, metal-bashing trades and chemicals. In 1822 the first rail was laid here for the Stockton and Darlington Railway, with the world's first steam-hauled train arriving on 27 Sept 1825. The Tees navigable channel was enlarged as ships grew, but Stockton was at a disadvantage to downstream ports and shipping trade was gradually lost. More damaging was the 20th century collapse in traditional smokestack industries. The town has shifted to service industry and retail, and has Queen's Campus of Durham University on the south river bank.

Opened in 2009, it's a striking double bow, best seen at night in calm conditions when the reflection of its lights in the river makes the ∞ infinity symbol.
54.5645-1.28624 Tees Barrage  was completed in 1995 and holds the river level constant above it, cutting out the tidal cycle of ugly mud banks and flood risk. The upper structure is a road bridge, no toll, but no stopping for views. The barrage below has a footpath and cycleway. Four channels carry the water through: a barge lock, a fish pass, a white water kayak course and a hydro-electric turbine race - this is a test facility not supplying the National Grid.
Maze Park is a nature reserve along the south riverbank around the barrage, a rehabilitated brownfield site.
