There is a Best Western set off the main road in Lake Havasu.  This is on the opposite side of the road to the lake.  It has a swimming pool in the middle court yard and secure boat parking.  There are also several hotels round the London Bridge area of Lake Havasu and some smaller bed and breakfasts.

Very modern hotel right next to London Bridge with funky rooms with Bridge views. The lively bar (which is also the reception area) with a large outdoor drinking area with bridge views are clearly audible in rooms, so it's not a hotel for those who want a quiet early night!
