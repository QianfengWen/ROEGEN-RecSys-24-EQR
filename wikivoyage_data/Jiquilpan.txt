See[edit]
The Public Library is home to a famous mural by Jose Clemente Orozco
Fuente de Aguadora and Fuente de Peces are two beautiful fountains in the town plaza.
Casita de Piedra (in Bosque de Cuahtemoc, 200 meters from La Glorieta, open Monday-Friday 08:00 - 15:00 and Saturday 08:00 - 13:00) - Old stone building that was once the library of President Lazaro Cardenas, located in a park setting. Spinning and weaving exhibitions with a variety of silk objects displayed.
Otero Archaelogical Zone - Several structures including buildings and platforms were discovered on El Otero hill, just west of Jiquilpan. Archaeologists date the site from 900 B.C., at which time it was evidently an agricultural and cultural center. The ruins were discovered between 1940 and 1942. It's a very small and rather insignificant site, but provides clear evidence that Jiquilpan has been occupied by humans for nearly 3,000 years.
Mexico Magico Galeria - part working art studio, part gallery showcase, it's a marvelously quirky display of modern art.
Do[edit]
Watch a cockfight at Palenque de Gallos (Barrio de la Ignacio Ramírez). Usually viewed as a barbaric, inhumane abuse of animals, cockfighting is still legal in many places in Mexico. Fights take place only during certain public holidays and festivals: typically Mexican Revolution Day in November, around New Years Eve in December, and in March to commemorate the nationalization of the oil industry. It's a run down place with bench seating around a ring and a metal tin roof, but most people don't come for the amenities.
