Forchheim is a small town in Franconia with an interesting old town.


Understand[edit]
Town wall
Forchheim is an old place even by German standards, and as it had lost most of its relevance by the 20th century it is quite well preserved. Forchheim owes its former importance to being a Kaiserpfalz, or a place where the emperor could rest and hold court during his travels and as such it served as one of several "capitals" (there being no one fixed imperial residence) during the 10th century and beyond.

Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
Forchheim has regular S-Bahn service from Nuremberg and Erlangen as well as Bamberg and is part of the VGN network[dead link]. The 49.71697211.0695231 Forchheim train station is east of the centre.

By plane[edit]
The next airport is in Nuremberg (NUE IATA) and is connected to the main station via the subway (~12 minutes) which is part of the VGN network as is the S-Bahn from there to Forchheim. Other airports offer more connections, but you will still pass through Nuremberg when taking the train to Forchheim.

By car[edit]
Both B470 (busy on weekends in the summer) and  A73 offer connections to Forchheim.

By boat[edit]
The Main Danube Canal passes through Forchheim.

Get around[edit]
Map of Forchheim
As Forchheim is rather small and wasn't built with the automobile in mind, walking is a good way to see the old town. If you stay longer a car or bike  might be a good idea, especially for day trips that can't be done by train.
