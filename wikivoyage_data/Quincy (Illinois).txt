Quincy has four major historical districts. The Quincy Historic Business District displays a wide variety of architectural styles and shows the wealth of the years 1850-1930 when Quincy was the most important river town in Illinois. Quincy’s East End Historic District contains every formal style of architecture found in the Midwest from 1830-1930. This East End area has a collection of Italianate, Greek Revival, Romanesque, Queen Anne and Prairie designs. Quincy’s South End Historic District was the home of Quincy’s German population. The sturdy homes, some ornate and others very simple, stand as reminders of Quincy’s German heritage. The fourth major historical area is Quincy’s North End, containing a collection of Italianate, Queen Anne and Renaissance Revival designs found in the Midwest from 1858-1930.
