Taganga is a small fishing village 5 km north of Santa Marta at the Caribbean coast in Colombia.


Understand[edit]
Taganga is a great and idyllic fishing village. Many tourists, local and international, visit this beautiful place every year. It has great charm and the surrounding attractions are plenty.
Although Taganga is a popular place to go, it has also its share of challenges with the infrastructure and public services which is work in progress. It still has charm and might be a nicer place than Santa Marta to explore the surrounding attractions or do some diving.

Get in[edit]
By bus[edit]
Frequent minibuses (collectivos) go from Carrera 5 in Santa Marta to the center of Taganga for COP$2,000 per person (August 2021).  It's about 15 minutes and a beautiful ride. On the way back, the bus goes in Santa Marta on Carrera 1 and then Calle 22.
Coming from Minca, the bus to Tanganga goes near the Plaza de Mercado. Ask somebody there where exactly.

By taxi[edit]
Taxi fare from bus terminal of Santa Marta to Taganga starts from COP$7,000, but drivers usually charge more for foreigners. Be sure to negotiate before you take. The fare from the main beach of Santa Marta (Carrera 1) to Taganga starts at COP$10,000 and rises to COP$12,000 (all prices as of August 2016) on Sundays, holidays and nights. For cruise ship passengers arriving in Santa Marta there are plenty of taxis and mini-buses waiting in a gated police controlled area to take you.

By boat[edit]
There is a daily boat service to and from El Cabo San Juan in the Tayrona National Park. It departs for El Cabo at about 9:30AM, and arrives back at Taganga at 4PM. The 1 hour boat ride can be really rough in the open ocean. Protect your belongings with plastic bags, because you can get wet through, especially in the back of the boat. There is a fixed price. The entrance fee for the National Park has to be paid at the beach.

See[edit]
Taganga is surrounded by beautiful desert mountains covered in natural flora and fauna. There are millions of lovely fish and corals which can be reached by short walks and snorkeling out to corals. People watching and good mellow times are to be had along the beach road and loads of beautiful tourists.
There is a viewpoint called Mirador on the way towards Santa Marta. It's better to take a bus or taxi there and back, as the there is no sidewalk and the street is curvy and narrow.

Do[edit]
 Swimming. The main beach is shared with small boats laying in the water. It's good for swimming and very crowded with Colombian tourists on weekends. 
 Walk to Playa Grande. A 25-minute walk north of town lies Playa Grande, nicer than Taganga's beach but maybe even more crowded (follow the coast line to the north and take the path which seems to end at a house). OsmAnd or Mapy.cz cover the hiking paths. It's better to not flash expensive things on this path during day time. Avoid this hike after sunset. It is also possible to take a boat to Playa Grande for COP$10,000 (can be haggled down, September 2021). Or take a boat to one of the more remote beaches in Tayrona Park like Concha, Chengue, Neguanje - real unspoiled paradise. There are no people except some fishermen. 
 [formerly dead link] Hike to Bonito Gordo, Carrera 2, #17a-20, ☏ +57 312 510 4791. A longer walk goes to Bonito Gordo via a steep but rewarding mountain path and from there on the Bahia Concha. Reserve a full day for this and ask around to decide if you need to contract a local guide. You can spend the night at Bonito Gordo or Bahia Concha, but you may need to take your own hammock. Thui Tours organizes a guided walk, in partnership with a local environmental foundation, Fundacion Calipso [dead link], to Bonito Gordo where they manage a protected area of the reef for study. It is possible to snorkel here. For the return journey you are able to retrace your steps, take a bus to Santa Marta, or via boat to Taganga. COP$80,000. 
 Mountain Biking, Calle 18 #3-31 (by the football pitch), ☏ +57 5 4210870. The best way to see Tayrona park, unspoiled beaches and dense tropical forest away from the heat up in Sierra Nevada. 
 Tayrona National Park. An unspoilt natural paradise of jungle, birds, ocean, and absolutely gorgeous beaches. A boat leaves for the backpacker beach haven of El Cabo every morning around 10AM. If you find enough people there is also a boat heading for Playa Cristal. 
 Minca. You can also be in the Minca, a small town in the Sierra Nevada Santa Marta in less than an hour. You can get there by bus for COP$8,000 (Sep 2021) or taxi. A taxi should cost from COP$35,000 to 40,000. 
 Hike to the Ciudad Perdida de Teyuna (Lost City). Takes several days and is quite pricy. To be organised with tour companies or in your hostel.

Scuba diving[edit]
Brain Coral in Tayrona Park
Taganga has become a popular scuba diving spot. Diving spots are usually near the small island "Aguja", a part of Tayrona National Park. The underwater of Taganga has a big diversity of marine life. There are a dozen diving schools in town, but be careful where you do your courses. There are many reports of travelers doing their courses, paying and never receiving any certificate. Be careful for your safety: some diving centers have pretty old equipment, never follow safety rules such as safety-stop and even skip important skills/exams during the course or have dive masters teaching courses, check if you will be with a real instructor. For more information check padi alerts.
A small review of available dive centers:

 [dead link] Aquantis Bed Breakfast & Diving, Calle 18 No 1-39, divecenteraquantis@gmail.com. Organized and honest, classroom with AC, long dives. Includes coffee, towels, books and warm shower after diving; and you do not have to carry or wash your equipment. Small groups, fantastic food.

 Calipso Dive Center, Calle 12 No 1-40, ☏ +57 5 421 91 46, roberdive@hotmail.com. Calipso is the only center that offers a Tayrona Park Safari, where people can spend 2 nights in hammocks on a beautiful beach in the park and dive. The diving is good. They are also pioneering a project to restore coral, which is rapidly degrading worldwide. In conjunction with the C-Force Foundation they are growing coral in a coral nursery. They are the only agency doing this in Colombia and one of the few in the world. You can even take a coral growing/ gardening course. The people are really kind and you can stay at the center before your safari. (note per http://www.calipsodivecenter.com.co/en-us/secpages/voluntariado_EN.php [formerly dead link]  it is a 4-week full-program US$2,000) Calipso is a member of NAUI, the second largest Scuba Diving Association in the World.

This is the place where instructors from Colombia, come to take their course, as they are a PADI 5* Instructor Development Dive Resort. Even some divers from the Colombian Navy come to take courses here. Without any doubt has the best boats in town, 2 well-maintained very comfortable Catamaran boats.

Courses could be taken in different languages: English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, German and some others. Has free amazing coffee at the shop, kind and nice staff.

Another option is to ask around for an apartment to rent. There are gringo shacks and guest houses all over the town. Usually, most places to stay that are geared towards foreign backpackers will have all the creature comforts (read: running water). Taganga has a long history of people's belongings disappearing as everyone in town often have keys and people lose stuff the day they are scheduled to leave. There is always the option of find a person who's renting a room in their house, or seeing who's out of town and turned their home into a temporary guest house. It's a great way of meeting people and really getting to know a town as interesting as Taganga. If you do this, be sure you trust where you are staying, and bring your own locks as a precaution. Also, Taganga has no water due to political issues, so there are times where water can be an issue.

Connect[edit]
There is a great little internet cafe a block to the west of the police station and ATM, which adds little friendly touches like the occasional cup of water.

Stay safe[edit]
Taganga had a difficult time a couple of years back with drug dealers, robbery and less than ideal police behavior, but it is a town full of hard working friendly people and it has slowly been recovering since, still regular precautions should be taken, enjoy your visit exercising discretion and caution.
There are quite 7 small beaches outside of Taganga (15 minutes walk), which are connected by walking paths covered by vegetation. These paths are not well illuminated, so precautions must be taken on late hours when there are not many people walking to and from. Do not walk there by yourself. Wait for a small group. If you carry valuables with you and don't feel adventurous, it's better to take a boat (3 minutes; COP $5.000).
