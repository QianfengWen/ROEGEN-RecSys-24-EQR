Mwanza is a city in Northwest Tanzania on the southern edge of Lake Victoria. Your main reason for coming here would likely be en route to Rwanda or Uganda. The city received some international attention after the controversial documentary Darwin's Nightmare, which is about the trade in the Nile Perch, centered in this city.

The timetable remains the same as in previous years: the ferry departs Bukoba every Monday, Wednesday, Friday evening around 21:00 and reaches Mwanza the next day in the morning. As of November 2021 adults pay TSh16,000/30,000/45,000 for an Economy/Business/First class trip (one-way). Children pay half.

Get around[edit]
Daladalas (public "buses") are a good, cheap way to get from the city to the surrounding areas.  Costing only TSh300 for a trip, they are crowded, slow, and thrilling sometimes.  You may want to ask someone which one you need to take as there are no transit maps.
Taxis can be an option, although there aren't any official labels on them as there are in the capital.  White licence plates means that the vehicle is registered for commercial use, and yellow mean private. Not all taxis have white licence plates, but some do. The taxis should be white cars with white licence plates. Use at your own risk.
Pikipikis are the little motorcycles that will take one or two people on as a fare.  There are usually a few sitting at intersections.  These are very dangerous because of influx of vehicles in Mwanza and again, use at your own risk.

See[edit]
The Bismarck rocks
The shores of Lake Victoria are interesting to walk along and popular with locals. Also, climb to the top of Capri Point at the west end of Station Road for a nice view of the area.

-2.51881332.8946361 Bismarck Rock (Next to the Kamanga Ferry terminal). A fascinating natural rock formation jutting out of Lake Victoria. Thousands of years of weathering have created the rounded granite rocks you see today. A statue of Prussian ruler Otto von Bismarck, who unified Germany and later became Chancellor, once stood here to mark German colonization of Tanzania. The statue was knocked into the lake by the British when they took over after WWI but in spite of the statue being gone for over 100 years, the name still stands. (updated Feb 2017)
