The capital is mostly a Christian city, with Muslims and African traditional religion making the minority. The city is quite accommodating as it is the cultural capital of the state.

Map of Makurdi
The major means of moving around Makurdi is shuttle mini buses, motorcycles and tricycles (keke-napep). It is best to have a local guide and to not go out at night. Touts can be a nuisance, and street gangs are best avoided.
There are two bridges which connect the southern and northern banks of the River Benue. One is the dual carriageway bridge for pedestrians and vehicles while the other is the rail bridge.

By bus[edit]
The buses ply routes through the city. The cost depends on the length of your trip with the minimum being ₦50. You can get a bus for virtually anywhere in the city centre. Ask what route that they will be taking. 

By motorcycle[edit]
Ahh! The preferred choice of movement if urgency is the word. Bikes are the fastest and can take you to your doorstep, unlike buses. However it is not advisable for long distances as the fare will be really expensive. These bikes are commonly known as Okada. They are quick, cheap, and save a lot of walking. You should try this option if you do not know exactly where you are going as most of them know the city off hat. Negotiation is key. You do not want to be outsmarted as they will quickly know if you are a newbie to town.
Before you try and negotiate any transportation fare, always confirm the fare from a local. If you have a Nigerian friend, let them negotiate for you as the quoted fare differs greatly for locals and foreigners.
