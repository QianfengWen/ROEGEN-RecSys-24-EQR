Gopalpur-on-sea is a beach resort in Ganjam district of Odisha (formerly Orissa). Once a busy sea port, it is now a quiet place. The din and bustle of the temple towns is totally absent and one can really enjoy the roar of the waves and the breeze bustling through  the palm trees. With an increase in the inflow of tourists from the late 1970s, Gopalpur-on-Sea enjoyed a slow revival and is today one of the foremost beach resorts in India.
