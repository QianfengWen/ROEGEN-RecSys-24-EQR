Located in Central Tanzania, Dodoma is the political capital of Tanzania.


Understand[edit]
Central Dodoma
In 1973, Dodoma was designated the new political capital of Tanzania. New parliament buildings were erected and plans were drafted to shift all government ministry offices to Dodoma by the early 1980s. However, due to limited water supplies, other environmental factors, and cost, this proved difficult and the plan was all but forgotten for several decades. However under the presidency of John Magufuli, the government move has been stepped up. Most ministries have now moved to Dodoma (or are in the process of moving) and most government meetings now take place there. Embassies as well as UN agencies remain in Dar es Salaam.

Climate[edit]
Dodoma's dry season lasts fro May to November. The biggest share of Dodoma's annual rainfall (~600 mm) occurs during the wet season (December-April).
