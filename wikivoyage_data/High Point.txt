High Point is part of the Piedmont Triad in North Carolina.  High Point is often referred to as the furniture capital of the world due not only to the large number of furniture manufactures in the area, but also because of the International Home Furnishings Markets held each spring and fall.  Over 8 million square feet of showroom space is used to draw over 70,000 people from all over the world to each market.  This nearly doubles the population of High Point resulting in an economic boom to the entire Triad Area as hotel and motel rooms sell out and many residents rent out rooms, floors, or even their entire home for all or part of the 7 to 10 days during the market period.
