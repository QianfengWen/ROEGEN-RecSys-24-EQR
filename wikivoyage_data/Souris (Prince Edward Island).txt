Souris (pronounced soor-ee) is a town of 1200 people (2011) in eastern Prince Edward Island.


Understand[edit]
Souris was founded by French-speaking Acadians in 1727 as a fishing settlement at the mouth of the Souris River. These early settlers experienced several plagues of field mice in the surrounding area during the 1720s-1760s (the name is French for "mouse").
