Understand[edit]
Western Ghats near Lonavla
Lonavla and the neighbouring Khandala are the twin hill stations close to Mumbai. Lonavla is a great choice for those who wish to escape the hustle and bustle, heat and humidity of India's most populous city for a few days. However, do not expect a quiet or pristine environment: the popular Lion's and Tiger's Points are the usual chaos of street food sellers, rubbish, dogs and cows with the addition of monkeys looking for food from people.

Get in[edit]
18°45′0″N 73°25′0″EMap of Lonavla
Lonavla is about 90 km (56 mi) away from the city of Mumbai and 65 km (40 mi) away from Pune City. Lonavla is easily accessible by road and by train from Mumbai and Pune which are among the nearest locations.

By road[edit]
The road is one of the most beautiful ways to reach Lonavla. By car, you can use the Mumbai Pune Expressway to reach Lonavla. You would have to take an exit at Khandala to get in. The toll is approximately ₹85 from Mumbai, but taking the Expressway not only reduces the journey time by 1/3, but also ensures a smoother ride. 
Two- and three-wheelers are not allowed on the expressway. For two-wheelers and three-wheelers, and for those who wish to avoid the toll, the other option is to use the old Mumbai Pune road NH4.
From Pune, you can again take the NH4 or NH4 and Mumbai Express Highway combination.

By train[edit]
For train travellers, there are plenty of options: Intercity Express, Koyna Express, Deccan Express, Indrayani Express, etc. Lonavla has its own railway station and most of the Express trains that cross the Mumbai Pune railway line halt at Lonavla.

18.7369573.36453 Duke's Nose. Duke's Nose stands 12 km from Lonavla, clearly visible from the highway while driving towards Mumbai. This landmark in Khandala is popular with hikers. The cliff owes its name to the Duke of Wellington, whose ample nose it resembles. 
18.7200573.373844 I.N.S. Shivaji. A naval engineer training base. 
Karla Caves
18.78333373.4705565 Karla Caves. Karla, near Lonavla, is a complex of cave shrines built by Buddhist monks around 3rd to 2nd century BC.   
 Lonavla Lake. Lonavla Lake is surrounded by natural scenery, about 1.6 km from the town. The lake dries up during the winter months. 
18.708973.47676 Lohgad Fort. A robust climb of about 11.2 km from Malavali Railway Station takes you to the 'Iron Fort', once a formidable battle-station of Shivaji. The fort commands a view of the surrounding hills and hamlets.   
18.7702173.367097 Rajmachi Point. Rajmachi Point is about 6½ km from Lonavla. It falls on the way from Mumbai to Lonavla, just before the starting point of the Ghat. This point commands a view of Shivaji's famous fort, Rajmachi (Royal terrakouioce) and the surrounding valley. Regular State Transport buses ply between Rajmachi Point and Lonavla from the State Transport Bus Stand. Further adding to the attraction of Rajmachi Point is Vaghjai Dari, located nearby. 
18.7497573.4048 Ryewood Park & Shivaji Udyan. Adding to the lush green surroundings of Lonavala are Ryewood Park and Shivaji Udyan. The stunning gardens are amongst the favourite picnic spots of the children, owing to the soaring trees and spacious open spaces provided by them. The swings set up at the parks further add to their appeal. An ancient Shiva Temple, situated inside one of the parks, is visited by a large number of people every day. 
The mountain that appears like shivlinga just before hiding behind the dark clouds
18.68662773.387699 Shivlinga. On the way to Tiger's Leap, you would see a small board on the right: Shivlinga (swayambhu). From the road, it looks like just another place to view the deep valleys around Tiger's Leap, but it has some real breathtaking views including the mountain housing the "Shivlinga". Besides, due to the lack of popularity vis-à-vis Tiger's Leap and Bushy Dam, the place offers a quiet and serene view of the Sahyadris. Like most places, there is a small shop to relish hot bhajiyas (an Indian Fried snack) and Cutting Chai. Tea costs about ₹10 per cup while the snacks would cost ₹30-40 per plate. There is a tendency, however, to extract more money from unaware foreign tourists. 
 Shooting Point. Another scenic point in the town of Khandala (Bazaar peth), which provides magnificent view of the Rajmachi Fort and the valley. Also the home for the St. Mary's villa. 
18.69960573.3862110 Lion's Point (buses are available up to I.N.S. Shivaji and the remaining distance of about 1.6 km steep climb has to be covered on foot.). Scenic point midway between Bhushi Dam and Amby Valley. 
Tiger Point
18.69570573.38567811 Tiger's Leap (Tiger Point) (a short walk from Lion's Point). Tiger's Leap is a cliff-top with a sheer drop of over 650 m, giving an extensive view. Just around tiger's leap, there is a small waterfall active only during the monsoon. It serves the purpose of relaxing in the water better than Bushy dam, as the force of the fall is higher. Also, after the brief steep descent, the fall becomes a stream with a fair amount of force to go all the way down to the base of the Tiger's Leap. Adventurers can trek down the stream whilst intermittently stepping back on land where the water current is too strong and the fall is steep. 
Tiger point view
18.7752273.4093712 Tungarli Lake and Dam. Tungarli Lake makes a very popular picnic spot for the residents of Lonavla, Khandala and the neighbouring cities. Apart from being a splendid creation of nature, this lake is also a very important source of water for the people of the hill station. This lake and dam come to life during the Monsoon season, where youth climb the mountain top to the dam. This dam was built during the British era and features a serene surrounding. 
18.7766373.4268613 Valvan Dam. Valvan Dam has a garden at its foot, and is a popular evening spot 2 km from the town. The dam supplies water to the Khopoli power station at the foothills of the Sahyadris for generating electricity. The Kundali River feeds into the dam's reservoir. 
18.762573.38138914 Kune Falls. A three-tiered waterfall with a total height of 200 m (660 ft).   (updated May 2017)
Do[edit]
When visiting the place in monsoon, it is fun to get drenched and play in the waterfalls near Tiger's Leap. Bushy Dam is a must-visit too: sitting on the steps of the dam or on the rocks beneath and enjoying the force of the water is a great experience in itself. In summer, as most of the lake is dried up, you can trek into the hills, or walk along the lake's edge.

Buy[edit]
Chikki store, main street Lonavla
Lonavla's name is almost resonant with its chikkis (nut brittle). People throng in huge numbers to the stores to buy chikki, fudges and other savouries of different varieties.
