Respect[edit]
The talk of the Kempsey bus crash in 1989 should be avoided at all costs. While it was the reason why over 95 per cent of the Pacific Highway is now a freeway/dual carriageway, many people from older generations are still traumatized to this day, and avoid bringing it up, unless a local or staff brings it up.
