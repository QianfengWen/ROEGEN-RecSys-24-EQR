King's Lynn is the third largest town in Norfolk in England with a population of 42,800. It is a town with great history, having being founded in medieval times, and is situated towards the west of the county on the Great Ouse river and near the Wash estuary. Though it may not be the great trading port today that it was in years gone by, Lynn's marine links are still a defining feature of the town.


Understand[edit]

The word 'Lynn' means pool and likely originally refers to a tidal pool on the Ouse, which by the end of the 11th century was home to a small trading settlement. By the 14th century it had a population of about 6,000, which by medieval standards made it a large and important town. Lynn had strong links with the Hanseatic League, with merchants from the rest of Europe doing much trade with Lynn and in 1475 a Hanseatic Warehouse was built for them. Previously named Bishop's Lynn, the town came to be known as King's Lynn in the 16th century.
The old industries of Lynn all but died out by the end of the 20th century. However, fishing in the nearby Wash remains important to the town, as well a growing tourism sector, with many museums and cultural attractions developing. Since the 2000s, King's Lynn has hosted a growing Polish & eastern European community.
King's Lynn is the place where explorer George Vancouver was born.

North Norfolk, with its popular seaside resorts including Old and New Hunstanton, Sheringham, Cromer as well as the many quintessentially English villages dotted around the green countryside.
Norwich, Norfolk's only City, is about an hour's drive down the A47 and offers a great range of shopping opportunities along with historical buildings and a Premier League football team. It is also situated next to the Norfolk Broads.
Great Yarmouth, a large seaside town that hosts a Sea Life Centre, 15 miles of smooth sandy beach and one of the UK's largest range of amusement arcades.

Shouldham Thorpe is a small, sleepy but friendly village at just 11 km from King's Lynn. Its small parish church (St. Mary the Virgin) was for a large part rebuilt around 1860.
