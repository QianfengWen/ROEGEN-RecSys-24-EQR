The Claiborne Pell Bridge, usually called the Newport Bridge
Jamestown is village on Conanicut Island, a small parcel of land that connects mainland Rhode Island to Aquidneck Island in Narragansett Bay.  Jamestown is 25 miles (40 km) south of Providence and offers plenty of shopping, dining and recreation. Accessible by bridge, via car or bus, this small coastal gem is a great place to visit any time of the year.


Understand[edit]
Despite its tiny size - nine miles long and one mile wide - the island is packed with sights to see and things to do. Jamestown’s main commercial area is Narragansett Avenue, where there is an array of restaurants and shops. An attraction in Jamestown is that there are no chain restaurants or stores. There is only one gas station. Jamestown prides itself on its locally owned businesses.
The island town also has an interesting historical background. In the early 1300s Native American's made their home on Conanicut Island and were the lone settlers until the 1600s. English settlers began arrived after making arrangements with the Narragansett tribe to use the land for grazing their sheep. In 1775 during the Revolutionary War, the British Navy arrived in Newport and shortly after invaded Jamestown. They attacked Fort Getty and Fort Wetherill. The island's history as a strategic defense point is still visible in the remains of these fortifications and others dating from the 18th to the 20th century.
