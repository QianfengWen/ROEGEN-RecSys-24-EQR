Augsburg is a lovely metropolitan city of 300,000 people and around 885,000 in the urban area in the German Bundesland (Federal State) of Bavaria (German: Bayern). Some 60 km northwest of Munich, it is one of the oldest German cities. It boasts a rich history and has developed a modern urban vibe.


Understand[edit]
St. Peter and Rathaus(City Hall), the oldest secular Renaissance building north of the Alps
Augsburg is the administrative capital and local center of Bavarian Swabia. From 1276 until nearly the end of the Holy Roman Empire, Augsburg was a "free imperial city", nominally subject to nobody but the Emperor but de facto self-governing as a city state. Despite being hidden in Munich's overwhelming shadow, the city has a lot to offer. While many Germans might think the "aug" part may refer to eyes (Auge (n) in German) it actually goes back to its Roman name Augusta Vindelicorum.

Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
48.36555610.8863891 Augsburg Central Train Station (Hauptbahnhof). Augsburg is connected to Germany's efficient train system, however the fact that the line via Ingolstadt is faster means that only a fraction of the ICEs departing Munich stop here. Still there are options to pretty much the rest of Germany or you can double back via Munich if it better aligns with your departure times or you get a cheap ticket. An Austrian Nightjet sleeper runs two nights a week, north via Cologne to Brussels, and south via Munich to Innsbruck.At least once per hour (usually twice), a Regionalbahn train leaves from Munich's Hauptbahnhof (Main Train Station) towards Augsburg. The ride lasts about 50 min. Regional trains between Augsburg and Munich always have "Fugger Express" written on them, this is important for finding the right ones. They usually continue in the direction of Ulm or Donauwörth after Augsburg Central Station. So make sure to get off as soon as you see "Augsburg Hauptbahnhof" as the next station. For fans of scenic trains going to Augsburg from Munich, it is recommended to take Munich's S4 to the end station - Geltendorf. From here, you can get the BRB to Augsburg Central Station, with very nice landscapes between Geltendorf and Mering. But note, that this train (Geltendorf-Augsburg) usually only runs once per hour and this takes longer than directly going from Munich. So you might have to spend time in Geltendorf, which is really a small village with not much to do. At least, there is an Ihle bakery next to the train station and you can for a walk to the Sankt Ottilien monastery. Here, you get a feeling how Bavaria is very far away from usual tourist routes. On a nice day though, it's absolutely worth doing this trip. Of course, both trains here can also be used with Bayernticket. Parts of the S-train between Buchenau and Geltendorf go right through the forest, so they can be scenic too.   
By plane[edit]
Augsburg is most easily reached via train from Munich Airport (MUC IATA). You will first need to take the S-Bahn  S1  or  S8  to München Hauptbahnhof (Munich main train station), a 45-min ride, before you can catch a train to Augsburg. Plan at least 2 hr in total from Munich Airport to Augsburg (as you can see taking a bus or private transfer will be much faster). It is best to purchase a Bayern-Ticket[dead link] (Bavaria Ticket) from one of the ticket machines located in the train station. A Bayern-Ticket allows one (along with up to four other friends) to travel within Bavaria using all regional trains (no InterCity Express) and city transportation (trams, buses, etc.) It is valid from 09:00 (on weekdays) or from 00:00 (on weekends) to 03:00 the following day. The Bayern-Ticket costs €25 for one person, and €6 for each additional person (maximum of 4 additional people). You can also use a Bayern-Ticket Nacht (Bavaria Night Ticket), which is valid Sunday to Thursday from 18:00 to 06:00 the next day, and Friday to Saturday, from 18:00 until 07:00 the next day. It costs €23-35 if you book online or at the ticket machine.
Other major airports within close proximity are Stuttgart (STR IATA) and Frankfurt, both of which are also connected by train and can easily be reached by car. If you fancy low-cost airlines, Memmingen Airport (FMM IATA) has a good selection of destinations served by Ryanair and Wizzair. FMM can be reached in less than an hour by car, 1.5-2/5 hours by public transportation.

By public transportation[edit]
Augsburg has an efficient transportation system with seven main tram (German: Straßenbahn) lines and several bus lines which cover the whole urban and suburban areas. These lines run daily from around 04:30 to 00:30. From Thursday to Sunday there are additional night bus lines to cover the remaining night hours, thus providing (reduced) 24-hour service.
See a plan of the AVV lines[dead link].
With AVV tickets, you can also use every regional train within the Augsburg region (but you can't go to Munich or Ulm with AVV). The BRB rail network operated from Augsburg Hbf is a suburban train connecting suburbs and even more villages to Augsburg's center. A suburban train system (S-Bahn, just like in many other German cities) is planned to follow the BRB and regional routes.
You can buy a 24-hr ticket, a single ticket for €5.80, or a family ticket for €7.40. You must purchase a ticket and stamp it each time you enter a streetcar or bus. Riding without a ticket (German: schwarzfahren, literally "black riding") will get you a €60 fee and a visit with the police.
The Bayern-Ticket (Bavaria Ticket) is valid in Augsburg and you will not be required to purchase additional tickets for using the Augsburg transportation system.

By bike[edit]
With its mostly flat terrain, Augsburg is great to explore by bike. That way, you can more easily visit some hidden gems in the suburbs and along the rivers Lech and Wertach. Augsburg's UNESCO World Heritage (Water Management System of Augsburg) also includes several objects outside the centre.
Bikes can be rented on several bus stations from the "Stadtwerke", and at some bike stores in Augsburg:

 Zweirad Bäuml, Jakoberstr. 70.

 Altstadt (Old Town). Going on a walk in the narrow alleys of Augsburg's historic district is highly recommended. You can find places with a very nice flair. Great for taking pictures of typical medieval European cities. No street is straight, everything is slightly bend and the alleys are small. The historic center is the 3rd largest in Germany after Hamburg's and Cologne's. Stroll around or walk along the historic water ways. (updated Aug 2019)

 Cycling in the nearby forests. For information about bike rental, look in the "Get around" section above. In the summer it's a nice idea to go on a cycling tour in the nearby Stadtwald city forest. Therefore, you should follow national road 300 direction Friedberg until the Lech river and then turn right. You will find yourself on a great cycling track next to the river with a forest on the right side. If you want to make it a longer tour, you can cycle all the way down to Mandichosee (approximately 7 km from the city center), a barrier lake of Lech River. In the summer, many people come here to relax and swim. If you are too lazy to ride back to Augsburg, you might just follow the street signs to "Bahnhof Mering Sankt Afra" and take a train (the Munich-Augsburg regional route stops here each 30 minutes as well as the Augsburg-Geltendorf and Augsburg-Mering BRB trains; so in total you won't have to wait too long for a train to Augsburg here), the one-way fare for Augsburg main station is €3.70 for adults and €2.50 for children. Eating possibilities include Waldgaststätte Jagdhaus about midway between Mandichosee and Augsburg and Waldgaststätte Friedenau close to the Mandichosee. To find them, it's best to look up for signs or ask locals. It is also recommended to take a lunch bag and have a break at some nice place along the Lech river. 
Buy[edit]
Augsburg is a lively university town, a city for business and recreation. Enjoy the benefits like traditional pubs, theater, museums and lots of shopping facilities. You find many retail shops in the pedestrian zone, but don't miss to go downhill (e.g. via Judenberg) to the "Altstadt" with its unique shops! There is also a larger mall (City Galerie) with common brands and big stores, busy on weekends. For souvenirs, go to the Rathausplatz, find Augsburg-umbrellas and Brecht T-shirts. The local brewery Riegele sells giftboxes with 6 types of beer!

Eat[edit]
Augsburg is famous for its plum cake, called Zwetschgendatschi, and Bosna, a sausage coming in a bun with hot sauce and onions. Also, try Kässpatzen (which literally translates as cheese sparrows, but no birds are harmed during preparation), a popular hand made pasta dish topped with melted mountain cheese and served with caramelized onions.

Budget[edit]
In the city centre[edit]
The Stadtmarkt or city market, enter from Fuggerstraße or Annastraße, has fresh fruits, vegetables, meat and cheese as well as the Fleischhalle and Viktualienhalle, which have various budget options available, including typical Bavarian, Greek, Thai, sushi and more. The stalls are only open during lunch time and are popular among locals. Closed on Sundays.
As almost everywhere, bakeries are also a good choice for snacks. A bit more expensive, but of highest quality is Cumpanum (located at the northern end of Annastraße) and Augsburg based Laxgang is worth a visit as well (their shop at the end of Milchberg, close to Puppenkiste) is worth a visit.

Next to Augsburg's Riegele brewery, this is a good place for fresh beer and typical Swabian cuisine, of course with a beer garden for summer. Apart from the beer, you should also try Riegele`s ,,Chabeso", a citron lemonade that is rated amongst the best existing. You can get them in the Wirtshaus or buy them in supermarkets, though they are only sold in Augsburg and suburbs. Sometimes there are guided tours of the brewery, you can ask at the restaurant.

Drink[edit]
In Augsburg there are several beer gardens, and some of them have their own children's playground. What is written in the Munich travel guide about beer gardens also applies to Augsburg's beer gardens. The Riegele beer garden, close to the central train station and right next to the Riegele brewery, is a good place to go.

Clubs and bars[edit]
A good part of Augsburg's night life takes place in Maximilianstraße and the historic district right beneath the Maximilianstraße. There is great diversity in the type of clubs and bars, ranging from disco to student bars. It is a great idea to go see more than one place and find out which is the most comforting to you. Luckily, in generally, Augsburg's night life is a lot cheaper than in Munich or other big cities.

 Elfer (coming from Moritzplatz, you go down a Maxstraße and then turn left into Wintergasse; Elfer is on the right side (on the other side, there is the Römisches Museum)). Called "Eleven", if there is a football (soccer) game going on in Germany and you want to see it with locals in a typical German sports bar, this is the place in Augsburg to go. It can get very crowded here so if you like sitting you better show up early (at least 30 minutes before the game). 
48.36539610.8950411 City Club, Konrad-Adenauer-Allee 9, 86150 Augsburg (Tram: Königsplatz), kontakt@cityclub.name. Alternative, berlin like techno club and cafe. Occasional theater performances. (updated Aug 2019)]

48.38448410.8896184 Rockfabrik (a bit outside of the center, take tram 4 (from Königsplatz/Moritzplatz) direction "Augsburg Nord", get off "Bärenwirt" and walk right over the bridge). Huge club, very popular amongst the youth. Many of them even come from Munich or Ulm just to go to this club. Unfortunately this also means they already drank a lot a beer in the regional trains, so there are many drunk people here that might cause some trouble. But the club itself is nice: It plays rock music and has several dancefloors and bars. A very funny fact is that this once was a Rockfabrik (English: skirt factory), and now it is a Rockfabrik (meaning: rock music factory). 
 Touch (very central at Maxstraße, walk down from Moritzplatz - it is on the left side). This club is very popular amongst students. 
Augsburg has a fairly good gay scene, one gay bar in particular is OKI's.

Stay safe[edit]
Augsburg is very safe; in 2017, it was ranked as the second safest German city with over 200,000 inhabitants. Virtually all crimes are domestic violence (which are quite rare), drug abuse, or alcohol-fueled fights at a bar. Augsburg also tends to be pretty safe at night. Don't be afraid to use the small and poorly lit alleys in the historic district, since these are beautiful especially after dark!
