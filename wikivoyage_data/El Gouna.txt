Resorts in Egypt, both on the Mediterranean and Red Sea, are usually a bunch of hotels on a previously uninhabited piece of coastline. El Gouna was built with a different mindset; a real town with inhabitants and "free standing" restaurants, bars, night clubs and shops as well as a marina for yachts. The same concept was used for Marina el-Alamein on the Mediterranean, Taba Heights on the Sinai east coast and Port Ghalib.
The construction of El Gouna (the name translates to "the bay" or "the lagoon") on the site of the village of Kafr el-Gūna began in 1989 with work on the Tamr Henna Palace. The town stretches for about 5 km along the coast and 2 km inland. It's set up like a Mediterranean lagoon landscape with several islands connected to each other by bridges. The buildings are a mix of both modern and traditional architecture and in addition to hotels, there are also holiday homes and housing for the around 10,000 employees of the resorts. Also Italian, French and American architects and engineers have been involved in the project.
Today El Gouna’s facilities include a landing strip, 3 international standard marinas, universities and schools, an 18-hole championship golf course, 17 hotels, 2 spas, and a state-of-the-art gym. The town has over a hundred restaurants and bars, scuba diving, yachting, fishing, and fully-equipped water sports centers, tennis, squash, padel and horse-back-riding.
There are three main areas with shops, bars and restaurants: 27.39608933.6773341 Downtown also including El Balad and Kafr el-Gouna, 27.39720133.6752522 Tamr Henna just north of the former, across a bridge and the 27.40805233.6744483 Abu Tig Marina much further north. The largest public beaches are Mangroovy Beach, Marina Beach, Buzzha Beach and Zeytouna Beach.

Climate[edit]
Temperatures are mild or warm throughout the year. Autumn and spring are the best times to visit; summer is scorchingly hot and during the winter there strong winds are common.

Many beaches are lagoons separated from the sea with steeply falling reefs. Just outside the reefs there are good areas for diving, and this is where many diving tours will head. These reefs alone have about 50 diving areas. The waters around Tawila Island, 16 km to the north has a couple of wrecks, a large number of different corals and rich sea fauna. One of the wrecks is the British freight ship Rosalie Moller, sunk in 1941 by German bomber planes. It's at a depth of 50 meters, and is not suitable for beginners.

The courses follow the programs of international organizations like PADI (Professional Association of Diving Instructors).
El Gouna’s nine certified diving centres and easy access to the finest reefs and wrecks in the Red Sea make it a diver’s paradise. Each centre offers a complete range of diving education, including PADI diving certification, from beginner through to professional level.
