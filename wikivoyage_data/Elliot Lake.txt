Elliot Lake is a city of about 11,400 people (2021) in northern Ontario. The former mining boomtown has attempted to market itself (and its stock of inexpensive vacant housing) to retirees and visitors with mixed results.


Understand[edit]

Elliot Lake was established in 1955 as a uranium mining community; it reached its economic peak in the 1980s before entering a long period of population decline due to resource depletion and weak export demand. 
The city sits on the Canadian Shield, and is surrounded by dense forest, muskeg swamps, numerous lakes, winding rivers, and hills of Precambrian bedrock. The local forests are mixed deciduous and coniferous, with colourful displays in the autumn.
Local wildlife include moose, white-tailed deer, American black bear, beaver, loon, muskrat, otter, Canada goose, and lynx, to name but a few. Fish species include lake trout, speckled trout, rainbow trout, smallmouth bass, pickerel (walleye), and sturgeon.

History[edit]
Prior to the settlement of the city, an Ojibwa village existed near the present hospital site on the lake's shoreline.
The city was established as a planned community for the mining industry in 1955 after the discovery of uranium in the area, and named after the small lake on its northern edge. By the late 1950s, its population had grown to about 25,000. The population has varied with several boom-and-bust cycles from the 1950s to the 1990s, from a high of over 26,000 to a low of about 6,600.
In 1959, the United States declared that it would buy no more uranium from Canada after 1962. During the 1970s, federal government plans for CANDU reactors and Ontario Hydro's interest in atomic energy led the town, anticipating a population of 30,000, to expand again. However, by the early 1990s, depleted reserves and low prices caused the last mines in the area to close.
In the years since, the city has found some success promoting itself as a retirement community and tourist destination. In the late 2000s, mineral exploration began taking place in the area, with at least one new mine under preliminary development by start-up miner Pele Mountain Resources
The Algo Centre Mall, built during the 1980s mining boom years, partially collapsed in 2012 due to severe design error. Water and road salt, allowed to leak from a rooftop parking lot for years, corroded structural metal in the building until it failed. Two people were killed. A new outdoor mall (Pearson Plaza) was built in 2016.
