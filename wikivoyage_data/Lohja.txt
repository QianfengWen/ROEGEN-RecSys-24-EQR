Understand[edit]
View of Laurinkatu street in Lohja.
Lohja has been a focal point for the population and economy of Western Uusimaa since the early 14th century. It was renowned as a trading centre in the Middle Ages. The local inhabitants were among the pioneers of the Finnish mining and construction material industries. During the Middle Ages, Lohja became an important center of Christianity, and several churches were built in the area, including the Lohja Church, which dates back to the 15th century. In the 16th century, the region became part of the Swedish Empire, and Lohja was granted town rights in 1623. In the 19th century, Lohja became an important center of industry, with several factories and mills being established in the area. The Tytyri Mine, which was one of the largest limestone mines in Finland, was also opened in Lohja in the late 19th century. During the early 20th century, Lohja underwent significant changes, with the construction of several new buildings and the expansion of the city's infrastructure. In the post-war era, Lohja continued to develop and modernize, with the establishment of new industries and the construction of new residential areas.
By Finnish standards, Lohja has long-established traditions in horticulture and especially in market gardening. These traditions are represented by the symbols of present-day Lohja: limestone and an apple.
Lohja has chosen to be officially bilingual, although the Swedish minority is small enough (4%) that this is not required by law.

Get in[edit]
Lohja can be reached by national road 1 (E18). There are frequent bus connections from Helsinki Kamppi terminal to Lohja (about 50 km). There are also connections from Raseborg, from or via the travel centre in Karis (300 m from the train station), from Ingå, and from Turku. See Matkahuolto.

By bus[edit]
See Matkahuolto for the coaches. Matkahuolto also has a route planner for local transport trips. 
Service lines are complementary to public transport and open to everyone. The service line can be accessed along the route in places where it does not pose a dangerous situation from the point of view of traffic safety. The turn also deviates from an invitation or request to pick up and drop off a customer, if this is possible given the schedule. The routes circulate through the main service points, such as Lohja Hospital, health centers, service houses, libraries, post office and other public and commercial offices.
You can find service traffic schedules and information on call traffic operating in the Karjalohja, Sammati, Nummi / Saukkola and Pusula areas on the public transport information[dead link] pages. Dial-a-ride service from Lohja from Pusula and Nummi to the center of Lohja and to Karkkila.
