Cooladdi is a ghost town in southwest Outback Queensland. Once a busy rail town with 270 people, today all that remain are three residents, three buildings and the grave of a small child. 


Understand[edit]
Renamed in 1913 from its original name of Yarronvale, Cooladdi predates the 'Flying Flea' steam train from Charleville to Quilpie.  In its heyday as a major rail centre, Cooladdi boasted a school, butcher shop, post office, store and police station accommodating 270 residents. The railway bypassed the town in 1914, starting a long decline. A Cooladdi State School which opened in 1970 was abandoned in 1974.
Now the smallest town in Australia, Cooladdi has its own motel, (disused) train station, self-rated four-star restaurant, pub and general store, which is also the home of the three residents of the town.
