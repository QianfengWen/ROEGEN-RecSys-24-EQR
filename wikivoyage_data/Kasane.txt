Kasane

Get in[edit]
By car or bus: There are paved roads entering Kasane from the east Zambia or Zimbabwe. south Nata and west Katima Mulilo Namibia, paved roads from Zimbabwe (notably Victoria Falls), and within Botswana from Francistown, Maun, and Gaborone. from Katima Mulilo Namibia. Kasane is closly located to Zambia, Zimbabwe, Namibia, which are all possible to reach oveland.
Mahube express buses has buses from Kasane going to Francistown two times a day 13:30 and 15:30. there are also minivans to/from Kasane to Katima Mulilo in Namibia. There are also buses from Francistown going to Lusaka Zambia via Kasane.
By air: Kasane International Airport (BBK) has a few scheduled flights, e.g. Air Botswana service to Gaborone and South African Airlines to Johannesburg. Many of the charter operators from Maun will also accept charters to or from Kasane. While the distance from the airport to the town looks walkable, elephants roam the land, so ensure you have your transport arranged from the airport.

Get around[edit]
Kasane is laid out along the south bank of the Chobe River, and the main road follows the river's course.  Thus the city is pretty linear.
There is not much public transport in Kasane.  Many destinations (between Chobe Safari Lodge and Mowana) are within 2 km of each other, so you can get around well by foot.  If you need a ride, you are best off with your own vehicle. Or, your lodge or safari operator may offer a transfer.
Many many taxis were seen in the city branded with a specific Kasane taxi organisation label. It should not be hard to get a taxi during the morning or daytime (June 2023).
Another tip is to get the number of taxi drivers and call them later if and when you need the lift.

See[edit]
Game drives in the Chobe National Park just to the west.  It seems like every lodge offers game drives, so there are many to choose from. They typically last three hours to all day. There is a fee to enter the park, which may be included in the game drive fee.
Self-drive game drives are also possible. Be sure you have a proper 4x4 vehicle, proper gear, enough water and fuel, and campsite reservations for the park.
 Chobe river cruises. These are offered by many operators, likely including your lodge. They typically are 3 hours long, from about 15:00-18:00, through the sunset.  Some cruises are in small boats which hold only six people; others are in large double-decker boats. About P320. 
Day trip to Victoria Falls, 70 km away in Zimbabwe and Zambia, are offered by many operators. Expect P400-500 for an unguided trip. Allow an additional visa fee per person (US$30-55/adult depending on citizenship), US$20/person for Victoria Falls park entrance, and further money for lunch, activities, and shopping.

Chobe National Park is immediately to the west.
Directly to the east is Kazungula, near the confluence of the Chobe and Zambezi rivers, where Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe meet. The newly built bridge takes you directly to Zambia. Note that you can not walk across but need to use your own car or a cab. You need a special cab with a permit to cross over and that cab will only take you to the border, from there you will need to find a new cab, of which there are plenty. There is also a road into Zimbabwe. Beyond this river crossing is Victoria Falls.
Nata is accessible via a paved road to the east and south. This road connects further to Francistown, Maun, and Gaborone.
There are roads leading west to the Okavango Delta and Maun, but they are not paved and require a 4x4.
