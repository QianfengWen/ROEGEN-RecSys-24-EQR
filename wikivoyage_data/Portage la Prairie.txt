Portage la Prairie is a city of over 13,000 people (2016) in the Central Plains region of Manitoba. Because the land is very fertile, Portage la Prairie is a major agricultural centre in Manitoba.


Understand[edit]
Portage La Prairie Public Building
The name is derived from the French word portage, which means to carry a canoe overland between waterways. In this case the "portage" was between the Assiniboine River and Lake Manitoba, over la prairie.
The city became a major transportation centre due to its proximity to the river, and later, the location of the main lines of the country's national railways passing through the community.
Portage la Prairie has the most sunny days during the warm months in Canada. Portage has a humid continental climate with warm summers and cold, dry winters.

Talk[edit]
Despite the city's heritage, the vast majority of residents have English as their first language, with less than three percent speaking French; roughly the same percentage speak German.
