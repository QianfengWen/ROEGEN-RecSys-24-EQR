Žilina[dead link] is a town in Central Slovakia with population of 80,000 (2024), and the capital city of the Žilina administrative region.

Zilina - main square

Understand[edit]
Zilina is the fourth largest town in Slovakia. Kia Motors Company has a large plant in Zilina. A lot of Kia employees from Korea have moved to Zilina, so you can find specialized Korean food sections in some larger supermarkets and some Korean restaurants.
Zilina is an important transport junction point linking south (Bratislava, Vienna) with north (Kraków, Warsaw) and east (Kosice, Ukraine) with west (Ostrava, Prague).

Get in[edit]
By train[edit]
49.2268618.746131 Železničná stanica Žilina (central train station), Hviezdoslava street. 
Žilina is on the mainline Bratislava-Košice and has frequent connections in both directions, and to the Czech Republic. A direct night train Prague to Kyiv (one way) also passes through Žilina early in the morning providing a direct and comfortable (albeit slow) connection from Ukrainian cities like Lviv and Vinnica.
From Bratislava trains can be caught from the main train station (Bratislava Hlavna Stanica) every 1-1½ hours. Fares from €9.
From the Czech Republic there are almost hourly connections, operated by Slovak National Railways, RegioJet and LeoExpress. Fares from Prague start at €8, 5-6 hours.
From Poland and points further north, a change is necessary in either Bohumin or Ostrava.
From Hungary, change in Bratislava (Budapest) or Košice (Miskolc-Debrecen).
Žilina is a junction point for many places in the region. See Cestovné Poriadky for details on all train and bus connections. Private train companies can offer very competitive fares if you book online in advance.

By bus[edit]
From some towns in Czech Republic, Poland or Slovakia could be easier to catch bus than train or it adds additional connection. See [1] (available in English also) for train and bus connections in Slovakia and countries around. The 49.225118.74742 main bus station is next to the train station.

By car[edit]
There are 3 European roads crossing in Zilina. Road E75 from Bratislava to Zilina as highway D1. Road E50 from Brno continues to Kosice as highway D1. Road E442 from Olomouc.

By plane[edit]
Žilina has an airport but it is only used for private aviation and the occasional charter flight, so any journey to Zilina will involve a train, bus or taxi journey of at least two hours.
Nearby airports with cheap flights are, in order of convenience, Poprad (seasonal), Bratislava, Brno and Katowice.

Get around[edit]
49°13′34″N 18°44′35″EMap of Žilina
On foot[edit]
The centre is pedestrianised and also small enough to explore on foot. Many areas have also been made wheelchair accessible.

By public transport[edit]
The city operates 8 trolleybus routes and 9 normal bus routes throughout Žilina, its suburbs, and neighbouring villages. Check dpmz.sk for a route map and timetables.

By bike[edit]
The city has quite a few hills, holes in the road and fast drivers, making cycling around sometimes a fun challenge. However in some areas the city has created bicycle-friendly streets and cyclepaths, and outside of peak hours traffic is low so you can have the streets to yourself.
Cyklodielna Recykel [formerly dead link]  repairs and sells second-hand bicycles.
