Eilat (אילת, aka Elat) is the only Israeli city on the Red Sea. Eilat (pop 85,000) is the southernmost town in Israel, isolated from the rest of the country by the Negev desert. It's sandwiched between Taba in Egypt and Aqaba in Jordan, and often used as an access route to those cities because of its large modern Ramon airport.


Understand[edit]
Eilat is at the southernmost tip of the country, with its "window on the Red Sea". It is first and foremost a resort town devoted to sun, fun, diving, partying and desert-based activities. Sprawled along 7 km of Red Sea coastline, between the borders of Egypt and Jordan, it offers spectacular views of the Gulf of Eilat (Aqaba).
It began as a strategic military outpost, and a port town used to export potash and copper and import goods from Asia and Africa, such as oil and vehicles. The military importance of Israel's access to the Red Sea was valued so highly that Nasser's blockade of said access in 1967 was deemed a casus belli.
In the 1970s charter flights increased the flow of foreign tourists to Eilat. They were attracted by the coral reefs, breathtaking location, and the dry and sunny desert climate.
Due to the somewhat remote location of Eilat, the Israeli government has tried to encourage business and tourism by cutting taxes on many things and even giving subsidies for airlines serving the area, which can give travelers surprisingly good deals at times.

Some 320 km (200 mi) from the hustle and bustle of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, Eilat's climate-induced relaxed atmosphere has always provided a convenient year-round escape for Israelis, and during the mild winter months also attracts thousands of European sun-seekers. Red Sea water temperatures range only between 20 °C in the winter to 26.2 °C in the summer, providing warmth in the winter, and much appreciated chilliness in the summer's heat.

Orientation[edit]
A beach in Eilat
Eilat's "Tayelet" (promenade)
Today, the 2-km (1.2-mi) North Beach area is full of hotels with opulent names like Herod's Palace and Queen of Sheba. The Tayelet promenade extends the length of the beach front and hosts numerous stalls, street artists, restaurants, and fashionable shops. The promenade has great views of the bay, and each evening is full of strolling tourists.
The southern or Coral Beach, which has coral reefs, is protected by the Israel Nature Reserve Authority. It has many public beaches and excellent scuba diving centers as well as several hotels and hostels.
Whereas the North Beach is within easy walking distance of the city center, Coral Beach is some 7 km south of it, beyond comfortable walking distance. The Navy and commercial ports lie between the two main beach areas.

Shabbat and Kashrut[edit]
As in most of Israel, many businesses and transport companies do not operate on Shabbat, the Sabbath, which begins Friday afternoon and ends Saturday night; many places do not reopen/renew service until Sunday morning. The same holds true for major Jewish or national holidays, so plan your itinerary accordingly. [See Israel, Holidays for more information.]
Kashrut is the body of Jewish dietary laws which many Israelis and tourists observe, and which many restaurants and almost all hotels adhere to. Among other things Kashrut requires complete segregation of meat and dairy foods, dishes and utensils, select types of fish are kosher but most 'sea foods' are not, and all foods must be prepared under controlled and monitored conditions. Kosher restaurants and hotels display a valid, dated certificate issued by local rabbinical authorities. Kosher restaurants close on Shabbat.

Get in[edit]
While Eilat is - for a country as small as Israel at least - far away from the rest of the country, the government is subsidizing international flights and the border crossings to/from Jordan and Egypt are a lot less hassle than one might expect, making Eilat surprisingly easy to reach - if not necessarily from the rest of Israel.

By plane[edit]
Rabin (Arava) border crossing, with Jordan
Taba border crossing, with Egypt
29.727234.99831 Ramon International Airport Eilat (ETM  IATA Ilan and Assaf Ramon Airport), Hwy 90, Be'er Ora (20 km north of city). This airport opened in Jan 2019 and handles all flights into Eilat that had used Ovda and the City Airport. There are flights from Ben Gurion Airport and Haifa. During the winter season when many planes in Europe aren't otherwise occupied, airlines including Wizz Air and Ryanair offer flights directly from Europe to Eilat. A shuttle bus runs 06:00-20:00 every 30 min (except on the Sabbath) between the airport and downtown Eilat (₪4.20) and less frequently until 23:00; a taxi costs ₪100. There's a security screen to enter the check-in area. Currency exchange kiosks and ATMs are in Arrivals and Departures. There is an Airside shopping area and your goods are handed to you at the gate. The lounge is by Gate 1, with a synagogue area. Wi-Fi is free throughout the airport. There's an ATM in Arrivals by Gates 33 / 34.   (updated Apr 2019)
Ovda Airport and Eilat City Airport are closed to commercial flights. Ovda will probably remain in use as a military airfield. Beware of out-of-date maps and road signs that direct you to the demolition site at Eilat airport.
Aqaba airport in Jordan is close by and has domestic flights from Amman and a few international flights e.g. Turkish Airlines from Istanbul. So you could easily take a taxi to the Israeli border at Arava then another taxi to Eilat; or Aqaba/Jordan might be your primary destination. This route puts Jordanian entry/exit stamps into your passport, so even if Israel doesn't stamp, border officials of nations hostile to Israel will know where you've been.
Taba airport in Egypt serves only a few weekly or every-two-weeks international flights from Bratislava and Warsaw.
By bus[edit]
Eilat has no rail service so the bus is your only public transport option for the time being. A rail link to other parts of Israel has been discussed for years, but officially "put on hold" indefinitely in 2019. You can take the train as far south as Beersheba or Dimona and then a bus from there.
All inter-city buses to and from Eilat arrive and leave from the 29.5562334.952952 Central Bus Station on HaTemarim Boulevard. There is some talk of relocating all or most of the functions of the Eilat Central Bus Station to the extended grounds of Ramon Airport, but when the airport opened, no bus station capable of handling the load of traffic was in place.
You should reserve your ticket for your bus to Eilat a few days in advance at least as they all have assigned seating and may sell out.

By car or taxi[edit]
There are a couple of ways to drive from Tel Aviv to Eilat. One is via Mitzpe Ramon. Another nice alternative is from Tel Aviv to the Dead Sea via Arad, stay a couple of days there or just make a short stop and then continue to Eilat. It takes 5-5½ hr from Tel Aviv, and a similar duration from Jerusalem.

A taxi from Nuweiba, Egypt to the Taba Border Crossing takes 50 min and costs around LE110 (Dec 2011).

Border crossings[edit]
There is no fee to enter Israel.

29.57534.9780563 Rabin (Arava) border crossing (to Jordan) (Wadi Araba Crossing). 5 km north of the Eilat Central Bus Station. Nearest Jordanian city is Aqaba. From the border, you can walk to Eilot and take a bus from there, take a taxi, or walk all the way to Eilat (4 km, nice tourist trail following the border seen on OpenStreetMap). No exit fee is charged by Jordanians as of December 2018, but the situation is changing very often—it was 8 JD before.   
29.491134.90334 Menachem Begin-Taba Border Crossing (to Egypt). 9 km south of the Eilat Central Bus Station. Egyptian exit fee is LE2 (Jan 2019, US or EU passport).   
Entering from Taba[edit]
From the bus station, people will try to get you into a taxi to take you to the border, but don't bother unless you have great difficulty walking, as it is literally less than 500 m down the road.
At the border, you have to buy an exit stamp from the Egyptian border guards; they don't always have change if you arrive early in the day. You then walk to the next building, the air conditioned departure hall, where your bags are scanned, then there's a little food, drink and cigarette kiosk, and then the passport control desk, where you give the card with the departure stamp to the border guard. They then stamp your passport, and you are out of Egypt. If you plan to reenter Egypt at Taba later, you cannot do so unless you already have a multiple entry visa or you get a LE51.25 reentry visa (just a stamp in your passport) before you leave. Egypt does not issue visas valid for travel outside the Sinai Peninsula upon entry at Taba.
A few yards further on you get to a duty free shop, then the Israeli building, with cool water mist spray coming from the ceiling of the path shade outside. On entry, again your stuff is scanned, then you queue for immigration. Unlike arriving in Israel by air, here you should not be delayed for more than 5 min of questions.
Once you leave the building you are in Israel proper. To change money, there is a bank at the Israeli departure side (where you have to pay a departure tax for leaving Israel, should you exit via this crossing). There are hourly buses to the town (Lines 16 and 30, ₪4.20), but the last leaves Su-Th 20:45, F 18:15, and Sa 21:45. Taxis will be waiting, charging about ₪40 to go to town.

Get around[edit]
Map of Eilat


On foot[edit]
Central Eilat, that is the Promenade Area and city center. Central Bus Station, Main Post Office, banks, etc. are within easy walking distance, although during summer months the scorching temperatures make walking around unpleasant. Only the closest public beaches are a sweaty stroll from the center; dive sites require transportation.

Parrotfish among coral at Coral Beach
The 29.5501434.959411 Tourist Information Center (☏ +972 8-6309111) can be found at 8 Beit HaGesher St. in the Bridge House near the pedestrian bridge from the yacht harbor.
The main swimming area is the North Beach and many major and minor hotels are situated there. The South or Coral Beach area is protected by the Israel Nature Reserve Authority, but there has been a decline in the marine life and reef quality. Since the removal of the controversial fish cages from the Gulf waters in 2008, corals have steadily recovered at all dive sites. While many divers head south to the Egyptian Sinai coast to Dahab or Sharm el-Sheikh, to experience better diving conditions, many divers still prefer Eilat, with far smaller crowds, interesting macro-life and easy, unpressured surface entries.

29.50834.9222 Eilat Coral Beach Nature Reserve. The best place for scuba diving and located here are some of the best dive clubs in Israel, offering technical diving courses, rebreather, nitrox, tri-mix, etc. The whole coastal area is protected by the nature reserve authority and divers are expected to follow regulations.

The park's aquariums contain sharks, sting rays and turtles, plus lots of multicolored Red Sea fish, and the huge glass windows allow visitors to get a clear view the tanks' occupants. The Oceanarium simulator is also a lot of fun for kids - though it may be a little scary for the smaller ones. All in all it's a nice family morning out.   
29.5268634.935464 Dolphin Reef, ☏ +972 8-637-1846. South Beach (3 km south of town towards the Egyptian border). Not just a tourist trap, the staff actually work to rehabilitate dolphins for life in the open sea - from whence they came. However, in the past the release of dolphins into the bay has on occasion resulted in the consumption of many of the nearby coral reef's inhabitants, so that the dolphin release project is on hold. Various paid options are available for interacting with the dolphins, starting with snorkeling with the dolphins at ₪227. It's a very nice beach with lots of small pools and rich shrubbery. It has a fantastic spa (relaxation pools) and is well worth a visit. For those who want to get up-close to a dolphin book your swim or dive as early in the morning as you can. The dolphins get weary of visitors as the day goes on. Piers leading out onto the water allow everyone to get as near to the dolphins - as the dolphins want. ₪42/28 adults/children.

Well worth the effort if you are a steak lover... or if you consider yourself an honorary local, either way, it's hard to tell what's tastier, the restaurant's meat or the punters. (updated May 2022)
29.5488134.9632510 On the Beach Restaurant. Falafel, shawarma and pizza. Decent price. 
Splurge[edit]


Drink[edit]
For a Holiday resort the expected assortment of Pubs and Bars exist on the Promenade and are also densely packed in the main square.

 Unplugged. The bar is a good option. If you're looking for a place with stuck-up people, barbie doll bartenders, or tough-looking bouncers, look somewhere else, because Unplugged is nothing like it. The drink selection is somewhat limited, but still fairly good. The music ranges from American pop to Israeli trance, and they play songs in both Hebrew and English. You have the option of either sitting at the bar, chilling on a big couch, or dancing with the friendly locals. This place is often crowded, even on a Monday night. 
While evil isn't heard, seen, or spoken at Three Monkeys Pub live bands and an all-ages dance floor crowd is. Located towards the end of the promenade at the Isrotel "Royal Beach".
Bears pub is central fixture in the main square. With a laidback feel and hookahs available Bears lends itself to chatting to the soundtrack of Israeli tunes.
Sleep[edit]
The hillside around the Central Bus Station contains motels and small private hostels which usually have a room designated as a dorm. You can find some real gems hidden among them but be prepared to take some time checking them out.

Homestay[edit]
If you reach Eilat having a backpack, you may be accosted by people offering their houses or parts of them for your accommodation. These are really a gamble, because you never know what to expect and people tend to exaggerate their descriptions. Usually, it would be a nice air-conditioned room with a double bed, shower, TV, sometimes Wi-Fi and some kitchen stuff. Price per day: ₪100-200 and higher, however negotiable, depending on how long you are staying and what standard you want. Start the negotiation as you see the apartment.

Outdoors[edit]
Extreme but cheap. Possible at the North Beach, next to the Jordan border, and also at the South Beach—aka Coral Beach—preferably to the south of the bar called "Migdalor". Pros: stay close to the sea for free. Cons: temperatures can get extremely hot, even at night; you have to search for water/shower/etc.

North Beach: past the main hotels, close to Aqaba.
South Beach: bus route 15 to Migdalor bar. Then just walk along the shore and find yourself a place to camp. The SPNI Field School also operates a Camp Ground (see below under Hosteling for contact information).
When staying outdoors, keep all your garbage with you, and there is an ₪500 fine for lighting a bonfire. Beaches are protected by the Israel Nature Authority.

Stay safe[edit]
Eilat is relatively close to Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, which has become a terrorist hotbed. There have also been terrorist incidents in Eilat. To prevent terrorist infiltration, Israel has built a steel barrier backed by cameras, radar and motion detectors on the Israel-Egypt border.
The sun can be very intense all day. Plan transportation and wear plenty of sunscreen including in the water.
The 29.5544534.940611 Eilat hospital serves the southern Negev.

Go next[edit]
A number of Kibbutzim (Heb. plural of Kibbutz) in the Arava also offer accommodations. Kibbutz Yotvata specializes in fruit cultivation and dairy farming. It supplies much of the milk and several varieties of fresh fruit and packaged goods to the Negev/Eilat region under its logo of a setting sun with two linked palm trees. They also take in traveling volunteers and have a Hebrew school for foreigners.
Mitzpe Ramon – about 150 km north, offers great views and hikes from the edge of a giant crater.
Israel – Jerusalem, Masada and the Dead Sea are a few hours away by bus, and can be easily visited in a day or two on organized tours.
Jordan – A short drive away is the Eilat/Aqaba border crossing to the adjacent Jordanian town of Aqaba – find information, on how to get in, there – Jordan's largest port and tourist resort. A few dozen kilometres north of Aqaba is the impressive Wadi Rum desert, and further into the country the ancient and popular Petra.
Egypt – South of Eilat is the border crossing to Taba (Egypt), where the Taba Hilton and nearby Taba Heights beach resorts are situated. Here begins the Egyptian Sinai peninsula where St. Catherine's Monastery and Mount Sinai are located.
To get to the Egyptian border take a taxi (₪35) from Eilat to the border, or take bus line 15 (₪6) and walk across. On the Egyptian side there is a minibus station as well as further along a full bus station. The border can take between 20 min to 2 hr. You will need to pay an exit fee when leaving Israel of ₪103 (Feb 2012) and if traveling further south than Taba another fee at the checkpoint south of the border. If you plan to continue further than the Sinai, deeper into Egypt (e.g. Cairo) then you need to apply for a visa in the 29.552334.943835 Consulate of Egypt in Eilat. The consulate is open Su-Th 09:30-14:00. It takes approx. 20 min for European and American tourists, costs depend on nationality, they lie around ₪100. Remember to bring a passport photo with you to the embassy - it is required for the visa, and the embassy has no photo-taking facilities. If you don't have a passport photo handy, you can take one on the 2nd floor of the shopping mall right at the corner of the Eilat beach. If you are on an organized tour, some tour companies can arrange the visa on the day of the tour at the border.
