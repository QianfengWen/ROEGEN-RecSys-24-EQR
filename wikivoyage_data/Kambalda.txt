Get in[edit]
By car[edit]

The final 55km of the Goldfields Hwy connects Kalgoorlie and Kambalda. The speed limit is 110 for most of the way so you should be able to get there in a few minutes.

Get around[edit]
See[edit]
 Pioneer Cemetery, Beresford Rd. A wire fence encloses six newish metal headstones that bare the names of residents who died around 1900. You can assume they are under there. 
 Red Hill Lookout, Off Gordon Adams Rd. The highest spot in town gives an excellent panorama across the 900 square kilometre Lake Leffroy. The lake was once a major site for salt production. The More salty shallow spots of the lake have a pinkish tinge that blends into the blues and browns of deeper parts. A short 300m walking trail from the car park leads to better views of the current mining operations along the shoreline and the longer 1.7km loop takes you right down to it.
