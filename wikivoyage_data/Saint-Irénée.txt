Understand[edit]
History[edit]
The parish of Saint-Irénée was canonically constituted in 1840, by detachment from the territory of Saint-Agnès (La Malbaie). The church was completed in 1844. The municipality of Saint-Irénée was founded in 1855.
The municipality's website displays a list of the main personalities who have stayed or lived in Saint-Irénée, in particular: Joseph Lavergne, judge and colleague of Wilfrid Laurier; Adolphe-Basile Routier, judge and poet, author of the words of Ô Canada; Rodolphe Forget, Member of Parliament for Charlevoix in the Commons, instigator of the railway linking Quebec and La Malbaie.
The railway connecting Quebec to La Malbaie was inaugurated in 1919. The Domaine Forget, internationally recognized for its Academy of Music and Dance, was born in 1977. 

Geography[edit]
The territory is generally hilly and covered with forest; the agricultural part is mainly located in rang St-Antoine, rang St-Pierre, rang St-Nicolas and around chemin St-Louis. The main hamlets (or locality) are Saint-Irénée-les-Bains (at the top of the moraine), L'Anse-au-Sac (along the river) and Rochette (near the airport).
The land relief of Saint-Irénée is part of the Charlevoix astrobleme, the result of the impact of a meteorite (possibly up to 2 km in diameter) that fell on earth nearly 400,000 million people ago. years. This impact created a crater 54 km in diameter; it is the eleventh largest impact site identified on earth. The impact zone would be located along the St. Lawrence River; 60% of the astroblème covers the north shore of the river and 40% is located under the water of the river. The astrobleme begins on the southwest side a few kilometers west of Baie-Saint-Paul, up to Cap-à-l'Aigle, located on the east bank of the Malbaie River, in La Malbaie. The center of the astrobleme would be Mont des Éboulements (summit at 768 m), formed by the effect of the raising of the crater bottom following the impact. Since this impact, the crater has undergone significant metamorphosis under the effect of various erosion agents, making it more difficult to recognize its outline, particularly the part submerged in the St. Lawrence River. Consequently, experts define this ancient impact structure as the astrobleme. Inaugurated in 2014, an interpretation centre dedicated to the Charlevoix astrobleme is open to the public; this interpretation center is housed in the former Club House of the Manoir Richelieu.

Economy[edit]
According to statistics from the municipality, 30% of the residences in Saint-Irénée are second homes. Agriculture in Saint-Irénée covers 707 hectares of land and represents 26% of farms throughout the MRC. Commercial activities are mainly focused on tourism: arts and crafts shops, restaurants, accommodation (hotels, lodges, inns) and other providers of recreational tourism activities.
