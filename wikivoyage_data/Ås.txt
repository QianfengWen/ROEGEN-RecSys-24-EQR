Ås is a small but fast-growing town in Viken, in the Oslo region, Norway.


Understand[edit]
The parish was named after the old Ås (Norse Áss) farm, since the first church was built there. The name is identical with the word áss meaning "hill", "ridge" or "esker". As of 2023, the city centre is under development, with more housing projects and a lively nightlife.
