By car[edit]
Car is your best bet. The average speed on highways ranges from 55–70 mph, while city streets are generally 40–50 mph unless otherwise posted.
Several major national car rental agencies operate in Hendersonville. Ridesharing and taxis are also available.

Parking[edit]
Free parking lots are located around businesses.

By foot[edit]
While going on foot is a viable option in certain areas, it is otherwise not recommended due to the spread-out nature of the city. However, an able-bodied person could traverse on foot in decent weather. Sidewalks generally run the length of the city and are prevalent in developed areas, but they become sparse when reaching the city outskirts.
