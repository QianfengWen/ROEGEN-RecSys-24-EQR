Stay safe[edit]
Winston-Salem is generally safe.  Like most cities in the world, there are certain areas that may not be the safest at night, particularly in the eastern half of the city.  Though its downtown was once a seedy, shady region, it has been thoroughly cleaned up, especially Fourth Street.  Most populated areas in the city, such as shopping and dining, are very safe.  Normal precautions should be taken.
