Anne Hvides Gård, one of the oldest buildings in Svendborg, was built in 1560.
Svendborg is a city on the southern coast of Funen. With around 27.000 citizens, it is the island's second largest city after Odense. Svendborg is home to the Naturama museum. It is the gateway to the South Funen Archipelago, with National Road 9 (Primærrute 9) leading to islands Tåsinge and Langeland, and ferries to Ærø and other islands.


Get in[edit]
Svendborg is reachable by National Road 9 (Primærrute 9). It branches off the main highway (E20) across Funen south of Odense, which is about a 25 minute drive. The Fynbus' regional bus lines; 121, 162 and 163 mainly uses local roads and takes about 1½ hours. Trains [1] are faster and the locals' preferred choice, which takes 42 minutes from Odense. If you are travelling from Copenhagen, you might want to consider switching to a bus in Nyborg instead, as this might be faster, depending on how long the stopover is.
