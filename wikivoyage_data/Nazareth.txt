Nazareth[dead link] (Arabic الناصرة an-Nāṣirah, Hebrew נצרת Nasarat) is a city in northern Israel. It is the largest Arab city in Israel proper, having a population of 60,000, a harmonious mix of Muslims (70%) and Christians (about 30%).


Understand[edit]
Nazareth is best known as the home of Joseph and Mary and hence also Jesus, although the New Testament states that he was born in Bethlehem.

Nazareth, 1842
A number of Christian holy places in Nazareth are associated with the Annunciation, the childhood and the early ministry of Jesus. In addition to the imposing Basilica of the Annunciation, these sites include the Greek Orthodox Church of the Archangel Gabriel (built over the freshwater spring known as "Mary’s Well"), the Greek Catholic "Synagogue Church" (assumed site of the synagogue where the young Jesus was taught, and where he later read from Isaiah), and the Franciscan Church of St. Joseph (built over a cave identified since the 17th century as the "workshop" of Joseph).
As the place where Jesus grew up, studied and lived most of his life (and regarded by most historians to be his likely historical birthplace), Nazareth has for 2,000 years been closely identified with Christianity and has attracted hundreds of millions of pilgrims from around the world. Nazareth is also Israel’s largest Arab city and as such serves as a major cultural center. Over the past decade the historical Old City has been extensively renovated, preserving and restoring the architectural beauty and unique character of its narrow lanes and alleys. The combination of these three elements – history, culture and architecture – assures the Old City of Nazareth a place among the most beautiful historical destinations in the world.
Nazareth is bordered by the predominantly Jewish city of Nof HaGalil.

Get in[edit]
32°42′14″N 35°17′50″EMap of Nazareth


By bus[edit]
The supposedly 32.70129135.298091 Nazareth Bus Station is not much of help, there are no English sign posts or any central information. Most buses go through here and along Paulus ha-Shishi Street. There is another central stop north, right next to Mary's Well.
From Tel Aviv, routes 823 or 826 from the New Central Bus Station go directly to Nazareth (does not operate on Sabbath or Jewish holidays). The journey takes about 2 hours.
From Haifa, the 331 or 332 bus (from station Merkaz Hashmona or HaMifrats) takes about an hour, and operate daily including the Sabbath and holidays.
From Jerusalem, there are two direct buses per day (excluding Sabbath and Jewish holidays), route number 955. Or take a bus to Afula and switch to a bus to Nazareth. Take care when coming from Afula, as Superbus 354 and 356 avoid the Nazareth city centre and head to Nazareth Illit. Ask the driver to drop you at the stop closest to the city centre. Bus 355 appears to go through the centre, but only runs a few times per day.
From Akko, take bus 353 or 343 (hourly).
From Tiberias, take bus 431 (hourly).
There is also a bus from/to Amman operated by Nazarene four times per week, departing Nazareth at 08:30, and costing ₪80. The same bus leaves Amman again at 14:00. Call +972 4 601 0458 to make sure it's operating and if there are free spots.

From the West Bank[edit]
From Jenin (also applicable to Nablus and Ramallah): Take a shared taxi (sherut/serviis) or hitchhike to the border, and cross on foot. From the Israeli side of the border, taxis to Nazareth cost ₪150 and to Afula ₪40-50. Alternatively, you can take bus 52 from the roundabout after the border into Afula (₪7.40). And a bus from Afula to Nazareth is ₪10.90.

By car[edit]
Nazareth is 102 km from Tel Aviv and 131km from Jerusalem.

By hiking[edit]
Nazareth is on a sort of plateau overlooking the Jezreel Valley, and it can be fun to hike up the edge of this plateau via 32.68603935.3919621 Mount Tabor. Take the bus to Gazit Junction ("Tzomet Gazit"). From Afula you can take bus routes 30, 541, and 542 (25 min ride). From Tiberias you can take the 541 (35 min ride) or 30 (65 min). The climb up Mt Tabor takes an hour, and there you can see the (by its sheer size) impressive and beautiful Church of Transfiguration, as well as its surroundings and gardens. (Open 08:00-17:00, free entrance, entrance only from the carpark side.) The nearby monastery has a giant outdoor bell, but it might be closed - check with the tourist information. Afterwards hike down the mountain and back up into Nazareth (3-4 h). There are trail markers, but better have a map and/or GPS. Note that on rainy days and for 1-2 days afterwards, the track up and down the mount is quite slippery, and hiking here is not recommended.

By train[edit]
While there is no train service to Nazareth itself, nearby Afula (8 km south) is well-served by trains from Haifa. There are buses every 30 minutes between the two cities.

Get around[edit]
Prepare for some of the area's worst driving. Traffic is typically on the heavy side, roads are not well-signed nor well-maintained, and parking is rather haphazard. Beware of sharp switchbacks and small, winding roads with no exit—these are cramped, crazy streets. Driving in this town is doable, but for the brave of heart. GPS is a must, but not entirely trustworthy.
Central Nazareth can be easily covered on foot. There is also public transport, which also operates on Saturdays, however the buses tend to get stuck in the traffic.

The Basilica of the Annunciation
Prominent Christian sites[edit]

Winter, M-Sa 09:00-11:45 & 14:00-16:30; Su and feasts 14:00-16:30. built above the sunken grotto which according to the Roman Catholic faith was the home of the Virgin Mary and the place where she received the Annunciation (the announcement of the imminent birth of Jesus). The large and impressive modern-day church is built above the remains of churches dating back to Crusader and Byzantine times, still visible on the lower level. The church boasts dozens of pictures donated by Christian communities around the world. The largest Church in the Middle East and one of Christianity’s holiest shrines, its imposing dome dominates the Nazareth skyline and is an ideal landmark and starting point for visiting other churches. It marks the spot where the Archangel Gabriel Informed the Virgin Mary that God had chosen her to bear his son; there is also a tradition that Mary lived in a house on this site. The complex of the modern Basilica is built on two levels. The lower one, marking the traditional Roman Catholic site of the Annunciation, contains ancient remains of churches from the Byzantiane and Crusader eras. During archaeological excavations, relics were found dating back to the Canaanite settlement of Nazareth, though the most interesting find was of a typical Nazarene house, hewn out of the rock, from the Roman Period. The upper level, built between 1959 and 1969 on the site of an 18th-century church, is in strikingly modern architectural style. With its stained- glass windows highlighted against bare stone.A garden and courtyard connect the Basilica to St. Joseph’s Church and Workshop. Admission to the Basilica is free.

Mary’s Well is the symbol of Nazareth Municipality. Next to Mary’s Well is a pleasant souvenir shop named Cactus, belonging to Elias and Martina Shama. After buying the shop in the 1990s, the Shamas discovered that beneath it was concealed one of the most exciting and important discoveries in Nazareth in recent history: a network of beautifully preserved ancient stone arches that once supported a giant bath house. It is believed the exposed remains beneath the shop may date back to the ancient Roman era – that is, to the time of Jesus – and have been fed by the same water that supplied Mary’s Well­. There is an entrance fee to the site, but no advance reservation is necessary and guided explanations and hot and cold drinks are available to visitors.

Do[edit]
Walking Tour of the Old City (duration 3 hours). The route begins at the Mary’s Well Square (ample parking nearby). Visit the well area (el-Sabil). Opposite is the ancient bath house, also well worth a visit (entrance fee payable), including the pleasant souvenir shop Cactus and a guided tour followed by hot and cold drinks. The remains discovered beneath the shop are believed to date back to the early Roman era – the time of Jesus. From here continue to the nearby square to visit the famous Greek Orthodox St. Gabriel’s Church. This is the site at which, according to Greek Orthodox belief, Mary received the Annunciation from the Angel Gabriel. On exiting the church, walk along the Pilgrim’s Path towards the Municipality and the Mascobia building – an impressive project built in 1904 as a hospice for Russian pilgrims. Further along the Pilgrim’s Path, on Street 6098 (most of Nazareth’s streets are known by numbers rather than names), you reach Bishop’s Square. On the right is the Greek Orthodox Bishopric, a white building in the Greek style, faced on the opposite side by picturesque houses reminiscent of Venetian palazzos, which have been preserved and renovated. The house on the left is Authors’ House, an art institute. Continue along Street 6098 to an alley named Sebat Qa’war until you reach Folklore House (Beit al-Sebat), the home of Tanous Qa’war, Nazareth’s first mayor in 1875. From Folklore House turn left to Street 6132 going towards the vegetable market, then left again to Street 6089.

Leaving Casa Palestina, pass through a vault leading to the Saraya building, the center of Ottoman rule from 1735 onwards. This attractive building is undergoing preservation work in preparation for conversion to a municipal museum. Returning to the direction of the vegetable market and the courtyard of the White Mosque with its pencil-shaped minaret, walk along Street 6133 into the well-preserved and restored market.

Eat[edit]
The city’s many restaurants provide a full gastronomic experience in all types of Arab cuisine. Any visit to Nazareth must allow time to enjoy to the full the renowned and delicious local tradition of welcoming diners. Note, Nazareth's kenafeh is by far not as good as in Nablus.
