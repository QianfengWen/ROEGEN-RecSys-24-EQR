Karlstad is the largest city of Värmland in Sweden. It was founded by King Karl IX in 1584, and is located where Klarälven river flows into Lake Vänern, the largest lake in Europe outside Russia. If it isn't raining, it is a cute little town.
Karlstad has a university, and is also known for the expression Sola i Karlstad (The Sun in Karlstad). Originally referring to a beautiful girl working in one of the restaurants in the city, nowadays the expression also refers to its reportedly sunny weather.
