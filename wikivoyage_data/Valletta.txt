Valletta or Il-Belt is the capital of Malta. A harbour city, Valletta preserves much of its 16th-century architectural heritage built under the Hospitallers. Valletta was one of the earliest sites inscribed  on the UNESCO World Heritage List.


Understand[edit]
Referred to colloquially as Il-Belt ("The City"), it takes its name from its founder, Grandmaster Jean Parisot de Valette.
With an official population of only 5,827 as of early 2019, it is the least populated national capital in the European Union. The population of the urban area is 355,000, so Valletta doesn't feel like a small town. It is also the southernmost capital in the union, and one of only two without rail-based public transit (the other being Nicosia).
Valletta was a "European Capital of Culture" for 2018, an honour it shared with Leeuwarden.

Being the southernmost European capital except for Nicosia and sitting next to the Mediterranean, Valletta is amongst the places in Europe that have mild and warm weather in most seasons. Nighttime lows are around 9/10°C in the winter, however at that time of the year it's comparatively rainy. During the summer, expect sunny, hot weather.

Get in[edit]
Valletta city walls
By car[edit]
Most bus routes and many arterial roads converge on Valletta. However, inside the city there are many one-way streets and some pedestrian zones. Parking can be difficult.  There is a large multi-storey car park in Floriana, about half a kilometre from the City Gate entrance to Valletta.

By bus[edit]
In front of the main gate of Valletta is the 35.89414.50881 main bus station for the entire island, rather than bus lines covering the island in a grid, most of them spread out from here and return to here.

By boat[edit]
Valletta from Sliema
For those opting not to fly to Malta, Virtu Ferries runs ferries from Pozzallo on the island of Sicily, Italy.
A much shorter journey can be done by Valletta Ferry Services across beautiful Marsamxett harbour from Sliema and past Manoel Island, for just €1.50. Considerably cheaper then paying for a harbour cruise.
Another little-known way is to visit Vittoriosa by bus and then have the Maltese version of the gondola, the so called Dghajsa bring you back in style across the spectacular Grand Harbour to Valletta, and drop you off just by Victoria gate for €3.50.

By plane[edit]
The island's sole airport is 35.857514.47752 Malta International Airport (MLA IATA) (in Luqa). The airport is the main hub for flag carrier Air Malta and a base for Ryanair with numerous flights all around Europe and the Mediterranean countries. The airport is also served seasonally by numerous European airlines from their respective hubs, but increasingly flights are available year-round   

The X4 bus runs from the airport to Valletta, with generally two buses per hour taking about 20 minutes, costing €2.00 in summer.
Get around[edit]
35°53′57″N 14°30′49″EMap of Valletta

The Valletta peninsula is only a couple of kilometres in length and  so the ideal way is to do everything on foot, which enables you to take many shortcuts via stairs.  However, the city is built on a ridge, and is steep in parts (requiring walking up and down stairs in some places), which can be tiring. The alternative would be doing it by car which is not ideal for visitors due to lack of parking space, direction signs and the fact that the streets are  very narrow, often one way and confusing if unfamiliar. Most of the main tourist attractions are along the main street (Triq ir-Republika) which does not involve steep hills.
Another possibility is to rent one of the horsecarts (Karozzin), but be sure to haggle over the price.

By taxi[edit]
A fleet of electric min-cabs operate during the daytime in Valletta, with a maximum fare of €5.00.
By bus[edit]
Bus route 133 operates a circular path around Valletta, departing from the bus terminus going round the peninsula including the Valletta Waterfront, Fort St. Elmo and many other locations. However, since most of Valletta is better accessible on foot, use this bus only to visit a particular location rather than for general sightseeing.

By lift[edit]
35.8943514.512211 Barrakka Lift (near the Saluting Battery). Nov-May: 07:00 - 21:00, Jun-Oct: 07:00 to 24:00. A two-cabin lift between the waterfront and the main city level, taking 23 seconds to cover 58 m. €1.00. (updated Mar 2018)
See[edit]
St Johns Co-cathedral
In debatable order of importance:

35.89777814.5127781 St. John's Co Cathedral. M-F 09:30-16:30, Sa 09:30-12:30. Unremarkable from the outside, but incredibly ornate on the inside. Each of the different 'langues' (knights of a particular nationality had their own langue) has a their own chapel lined along the side of the nave in which they try and outdo each other in splendor. The barrel shaped ceiling is a single huge fresco, the lifework of famed artist Mattia Preti. And last but not least the floor is entirely taken by knight's graves all intricately inlaid marble in different colours, a recent book on the subject describes it as the 'most beautiful floor in the world.' This relatively unknown cathedral can count itself one of the most impressive in Europe. Entrance is through the Carappechia Annex on Republic Street in between St John's Street and St Lucy Street, directly opposite the Law Courts. As soon as you enter you will be provided with an audio guide included in the entrance fee which leads you through the cathedral in 17 stops enabling you to get further historical information about the paintings and special parts of St. John’s Co-Cathedral. €15 for adults (includes an audio guide).   (updated Feb 2020)
 The Cathedral Museum. Holds two works by Caravaggio who was briefly himself a Knight, one of them being his masterpiece the famous huge "Beheading of St. John the Baptist". 
35.89883314.5140562 Palace of the Grand Masters, ☏ +356 21249349. Daily 09:00-17:00 (armoury sometimes closed for functions). Now it is the President's office and the Maltese parliament. The staterooms, when accessible are quite impressive. It also houses the Knights' armoury which is open to visitors daily from 09:00-17:00. (However, all other parts of the palace are closed to visitors, so what they can see is limited.) At the entrance you can receive an audio guide which is included in the entrance fee. It provides you with further historical information about the various armoury of different eras beginning from the medieval chain mail up to the 17th-century armour. €10.   (updated Mar 2018)
35.899814.51873 The Malta Experience, St Elmo Bastions, Mediterranean St, ☏ +356 243776, +356 251284. Despite not being cheap, visitors who have any interest in culture or history and who haven't exhaustively read up on the country before coming here would do well by starting their visit to Malta by going here as it is an excellent introduction to the country. It gives an impression of major events that shaped the country, but as it's only half an hour long and meant for first-time visitors one shouldn't expect an in-depth dry scholarly treatment of the subject. ​€16. (updated Mar 2018)
35.89472214.5122224 The Upper Barrakka Gardens (at the upper south side of the peninsula). The gardens offer a jaw-dropping view of the Grand Harbour. Go on a sunny day and bring champagne!   
35.897514.511255 The National Museum of Archaeology, Auberge de Provence, Republic St, ☏ +356 2122 1623. Daily 09:00-18:00 (17:00 in Jan, Feb). Even though Malta has an impressive and unique ancient history, this museum housed in the former Auberge de Provence in Republic street can be rather a disappointment. The museum is partially being renovated hopefully bringing something more worthy of its name. €5.00.   (updated Mar 2018)
Fort St. Elmo
35.90194414.5186116 Fort St. Elmo (National War Museum). Apr-Sep: daily 09:00-18:00; Oct-Mar: daily 09:00-17:00. Built at the tip of the peninsula by the knights after the Dragut Raid of 1551. During the Great Siege of 1565 the Turks made the mistake of choosing to first take this fort, for which they had planned a week. Instead the knights and soldiers present fought desperately for a month, buying essential time. The knights in the fort knew they were fighting to the death, and so rather than being taken off the ramparts when wounded, knights would fight on seated in chairs until they couldn't even lift their arms anymore. Today the fort houses the National War Museum and the Police Academy. The National War Museum is mainly focussed on World Wars 1 and 2, but covers the period from the Bronze age onwards. €10.   (updated Mar 2018)
35.8979914.507767 Fortifications of Valletta. The imposing defence walls and ramparts at the entrance to Valletta built by the Knights in the late 16th century are interesting to explore.   (updated Mar 2018)
35.89823514.5135518 The National Library (Bibliotheca), 36 Old Treasury Street, ☏ +356 2123 6585. An evocative old library on Republic Square, next to the Grandmaster's Palace. Only part of it is open to the public: you will need to take a passport or other photo ID to get in. The entire archives of the Knights of St. John from the Crusades in the 11th century until 1798 when Napoleon took Malta, are kept here, in true Maltese style in rickety wooden filing cabinets.   
35.899514.5189 The Sacra Infermeria (Mediterranean Conference Centre). The great hospital built by the knights in the 16th century, open to everyone, it had the highest level of health care available in Europe at the time. It was mostly destroyed during World War II, it was rebuilt and now functions as a conference centre. It is rarely open to the public.   
35.89986114.51541710 The Casa Rocca Piccola, 74 Republic St., ☏ +356 2122 1499. A Maltese noble family house on Triq ir-Republika, a few hundred metres past the Grand Master's Palace on the right hand side. Very enjoyable.   (updated Dec 2017)
35.89578614.51030311 St. James Cavalier. A fortress opposite the Auberge of Castille (today the Prime Minister's office) which was built as part of the elaborate defence systems of Valletta. Today it houses a 'Centre for Creativity', with its own theatre, cinema, music room and exhibition halls. Its twin, St. John Cavalier, is the embassy of the Knights of St. John who are, like the Vatican, recognised by several countries as a sovereign entity.   
35.8714.50638912 Hal Saflieni Hypogeum, Triq Ic Cimiterju, Paola (reachable by any bus route to Paola (e.g. Route 1,2,3) and a short walk from the bus stops), ☏ +356 2142 4231, fax: +356 2124 4231. Eight tours are conducted daily, starting on the hour from 09:00 till 16:00 (last tour). The Hal Saflieni Hypogeum is a subterranean structure excavated c. 2500 BC. Thought to have been built as a sanctuary, it became a necropolis in prehistoric times. It is the only prehistoric underground temple in the world. To ensure its conservation, the site’s microclimate is strictly regulated. For this reason, the site is open to a maximum of 80 visitors each day. Each tour is limited to ten visitors. A tour of the site starts with a brief introductory exhibition and multilingual audio-visual film focusing on the temple building peoples and the Hypogeum’s relationship to Malta’s temple sites. Booking in advance on the Heritage Malta website is strongly advised. If unable to book in advance, tickets for tours the next day at 12:00 and 16:00 are sold at the Valletta Museum of Fine Arts the day prior. They are sold at a first come, first serve basis. Depending on the season, lining up prior to the opening of the museum is a necessity for purchasing tickets. Plan on lining up anywhere from half an hour to an hour and a half in advance to ensure ticket purchases. €30 available from website, €35 from the museum.   
35.86916714.51194413 Tarxien Temples, Triq It Tempji Neolitici, Tarxien. Daily 09:00-17:00, last admission 16:30. This site, dating from 3600 to 2500 BC, is the most complex of all temple sites in Malta and consists of four megalithic structures. €6.   
35.8951514.5120114 Lascaris War Rooms. Daily 10:00 - 17:00. Underground complex which was used as the British HQ during the defence of Malta in World War II. €10.   (updated Mar 2018)

35.89619414.5097518 Parliament House. Malta Parliament building built between 2011 and 2015 at a cost of €90 million to a design by Renzo Piano.

35.9014614.51161 Coastal Walk. You can take a spectacular walk along the sea around the outside of the city walls.

This walk takes about 30 minutes and is done by virtually no-one. As parts of this walk go via bare rocks, it's recommended to wear proper shoes and only do it in dry weather. (updated Mar 2018)
35.8990714.513612 St George's Square (Misraħ San Ġorġ). At night in St George's Square, there is a lovely water fountain, with coloured spouts of water which pop up and down - a fantastic play opportunity for children. They will get wet, so don't let them go near if they are wearing their best clothing. Great fun for kids. (updated Mar 2018)
 Audio Guide. To get further historical information about the numerous places of interest through Valletta it can be useful to get an audio guide.

Learn[edit]
Several of the Maltese English language institutes are in Valletta.

Buy[edit]
The main street of Valletta is Republic Street (Triq Ir-Repubblika), a busy pedestrianised zone leading down the middle of the Peninsula from the main gate down to Republic square, this is where many of the better shops are located, although it cannot quite compete with Sliema for clothing.
The best souvenir shop (the least worthless trinkets etc.) can be found at the Malta experience, but there are many other reasonable souvenir shops in Valletta. At the beginning of Republic Street, there are several reasonable souvenir shops but prices are far cheaper if you walk 20 meters down South street (turn left if you have the bus station behind you) which crosses Republic Street very soon after you have entered through the city gates.

Eat[edit]
St. Paul's Pro-Cathedral
Valletta has a good selection of decent restaurants, especially along the waterfront. Since most tourists stay in Sliema or on the north coast of the island there are fewer of the trashy variety, although it does have the usual fast-food chains. Look out for traditional bakeries, with steaming fresh bread for mere cents.

In Valletta proper, accommodation is rather expensive with nights at midrange hotels often costing €150-200 even in the low season. If you don't want to spend too much of your travel budget on the place to sleep, consider staying in one of the surrounding towns where rates are much lower.

Stay safe[edit]
Most of the usual petty crime that travelers are confronted with happens in Sliema and St Julians, but it's something to keep in mind.

Connect[edit]
Many businesses (restaurants, hotels etc.) offer free Wi-Fi, in addition to the "Free Wi-Fi" zones that exist around Malta. The country has several mobile carriers and your phone will work just like elsewhere in Europe.

Go next[edit]
Almost all of Malta's bus routes start from the large roundabout just outside the main gate, making everywhere in the country accessible.
There is also the ferry which goes to Sliema, across the bay to the northwest. Sliema and St. Julian's further northwest are more modern towns and unlike Valletta more geared towards nightlife and partying.

Mdina
Cottonera (Three Cities) — the name used when referring to the three historic and ancient cities of Birgu (aka Vittoriosa), Isla (aka Senglea) and Bormla (aka Cospicua), three towns conglomerated by 16th century fortifications called the Cottonera lines.

Valletta is a UNESCO World Heritage Site but two more can be found in the suburb of Tarxien, in the form of the Megalithic Temples and the Hypogeum
