Blackheath is a small town located between Medlow Bath and Mount Victoria in the Blue Mountains. It is 114 km west of Sydney and is 1056 meters above sea level. It has a permanent population of around 4,400 (2016) but the population vastly increases on public holidays and weekends from the number of tourists staying in the town.
The town boasts several fine dining restaurants and good quality cafes. A popular farmers market takes place the 2nd Sunday of each month showcasing a variety of quality local and regional produce.
The area has a number of magnificent bushwalks with easy access to the world-heritage-listed Blue Mountains National Park. Expansive views of the Grose Valley are available at the Govett's Leap lookout an easy 5-minute drive from the town centre.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Blackheath is on the Great Western Highway, after Medlow Bath and is quite hard to miss. It takes approximately 1.5 to 2 hours from Sydney, depending on which road you take, and the traffic conditions.

By train[edit]
Trains stop at Blackheath Station every two hours off-peak and weekends, and more frequently at peak times. An adult return ticket from Sydney's Central Station to Blackheath is $17.20, capped at $15 if using Opal.
The station is near the main shops and gives good access to the town centre. A shuttle operates over the road from the station.  Govett's leap is around 3 km from the station, and Evan's lookout is further.  So, best to have a plan worked out if you are hoping to tour the attractions and vistas that the area is famous for.

-33.627997150.3114872 Govett's Leap. This is most frequently visited lookout, and has well developed picnic facilities and a nice viewing spot. There is folklore surrounding a criminal who supposedly leapt off the cliff rather than be captured by law enforcement agencies, that supplants the more mundane truth of being discovered by Government surveyor William Govett, who used the word 'leap' as an old Scottish word meaning waterfall.
