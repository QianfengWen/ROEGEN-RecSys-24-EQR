Khulna is the capital city of Khulna Division in Southern Bangladesh. On the bank of Rupsha (and Bhairav) river, it is known as the industrial city, and is the third most populous city in the country. It is known in Bangladesh for its mills and shipyard. But for tourists, it is better known as the gateway of the Sundarbans.

Get in[edit]
By air[edit]
Novoair has regular flights to Jessore airport and some of these airlines provide shuttle bus to Khulna city. They cost approximately Tk. 5000 (US$65). Hotels in Khulna will usually arrange a car to collect anyone from the airport at Jessore.

By bus[edit]
Regular buses all day and night runs from capital city Dhaka to Khulna. Well known are Shohag Paribahan (transport) [1][dead link], Eagle transport, A K Travels, Hanif transport etc. All of they have AC (air conditioned) and normal chair coach services. Cost approximately Tk 500-1200 (US$7.00-16.00). Usual time is 6-8 hours.
Buses also run from Jessore (Tk50-100, 2-3 hour)
By boat[edit]
As of December 2018, the Rocket Steamer launches from here once per week on Thursdays heading to Dhaka (2 per cabin, 26-30 hours) with a few stops along the way including Barisal. It departs Khulna at 2:45AM, but it's possible to board the boat around 6-7PM the night before and sleep in your berth for no extra charge. The boats launch from Rocket Ghat just behind the train station, while the BIWTC office for ticket bookings is next to the Jolil tower in the city center.
For most of the other days, you can board a Rocket steamer heading to Dhaka in Hularhat. To get to Hularhat, go first by a bus to Pirojpur (1.5-2 hours) and then a rickshaw or a motorcycle to  the Hularhat jetty. The ferry leaves at 14:00.
Get around[edit]
Cycle-rickshaws are the main method of transport. From the bus stand to the center or from one end of town to the other shouldn't run more than about Tk20, and as little as Tk 5 for shorter journeys by easy bikes.
It is also possible to rent a scooter (3 wheel) for little longer journeys.

 Khulna University. Located at Gollamari, a modern university area with nice view and lakes. Good for spending an afternoon in natural surroundings. 
Khan Jahan Ali Bridge, a place frequently visited by local people. In the Lobon Chora area. A long-awaited bridge over the Rupsha river connecting Bagerhat and Mongla port. You can walk along the bridge and take a snap of Khulna city and the Rupsha river.
St Joseph's Church, Babu Khan Rd. A catholic church run by the friendly, English-speaking Father Jacob. Daily mass is at 6AM, and they welcome visitors.
Market stalls run along the river between the train station and the ferry terminal. While their products are unlikely to be what tourists are looking to buy, the people are friendly, many of the tea stalls are great, and from time to time you get a glimpse of the river.
The Torture & Genocide Museum is a confronting and powerful exhibition of the 1971 war for independence. It offers a different take from that of Dhaka's Liberation War Museum and is well worth a visit, especially for the art and photography displays. There is a small entrance fee with donations encouraged.

To the east of the intersection of Khan A Sabur Rd and Cemetery Rd is a cluster of budget hotels in the various alleys.

22.81042789.5618581 Hotel Royal International, 33 K.D.A.Avenu, ☏ +880 41-721638-9. A nicer hotel. With complementary breakfast, the food is very good but the rooms are scruffy. Window air conditioning units in rooms. Wireless internet is unreliable. Tk.900-3000. 
 Hotel Western International, 51 Khan A Sabur Rd, ☏ +880 41 733 191. The nicest hotel in the town, with very friendly staff and nice, clean rooms. Tk800+.

Hotel Society, in the cluster of hotels around the city center, probably never lived up to its name. Tiny rooms with cold showers, squat toilets and mosquito nets are just bearable.
