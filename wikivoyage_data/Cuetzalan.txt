Danza Los Quetzales in Cuetzalan
Cuetzalan is a scenic colonial town in the highlands of northern Puebla state in Central Mexico. The town has lots of white colonial buildings with dark red bands painted across the bottoms, set among steep cobblestone streets. It has a 1500-year-old archaeological site nearby, coffee plantations, and copious natural attractions that include  waterfalls, caves, and hiking trails through the jungle. 


Understand[edit]
Traditional architecture in the town center
The climate is subtropical and humid with frequent rains. The forests of the surrounding mountains are foggy and fog frequently descends into the town. The average temperature of 23 °C means most of the year will have pleasant conditions, but hot days are a possibility in the summer.
Like most of Mexico, the population is mostly mestizo, but there are quite a few indigenous people in the area who identify as either Nahua or Totonac. Don't be surprised if you hear languages other than Spanish being spoken. Cuetzalan preserves a number of indigenous traditions, including dances, costumes, and regional foods. The Dance of the Quetzals is a popular folk dance in Cuetzalan because the town takes its name from the majestic Quetzal birds.

See[edit]
Entering the cemetery at the front of Iglesia de los Jarritos
20.01782-97.5253431 Iglesia De Los Jarritos (Santuario de Guadalupe), Aldama, Centro. Striking neo-gothic church that gets its name from the small jugs that decorate it. The church tower seems unusually tall for an otherwise narrow church. You enter the church through its cemetery. Because the town is often socked in by fog, it's a place you can get some spectacularly eerie photos. 
20.019027-97.5204062 Parroquia San Francisco de Asis (St Francis of Asisi Church), Calle Miguel Alvarado, Col. Centro,. The town's first Christian church, established by the Franciscans in 1547. And extensively renovated in the 19th and 20th centuries. 
Ruins of Yohualichan
 Yohualichan. 10:00 - 17:00 (closed M). Archaeological site that was once the small Totonac city of Yohualican. The site was constructed in the early part of the Classic period (roughly 0-600 AD), making it contemporary with the larger El Tajin site nearby. It is thought that Chichimec incursions from around 1000 AD probably motivated the Totonac to move out of Yohualican. The architecture of the structures incorporates niches, similar to the design of buildings at El Tajin. M$70.

Offers camping and various packages that include cave explorations from mild to wild. The entry-level basic tour costs M$175 per person and is a standard cave tour. A longer cave trip goes into the Grutas Chivostic, which is suitable for more advanced spelunkers. The entire cave route spans over 2 km and can include rapelling into the cave or traversing an aquatic route via an underground river called Río Subterráneo Chichicazapan. Most of the aquatic route is navigated by wading but there are areas up to 6 meters deep, so life jackets are provided. The Cuetzalan caves were in the news in 2004 when a group of British military cavers got trapped for 6 days, causing an international incident. M$175 to M$900 (depending on selected activities).

Drink[edit]
Yolixpa is the local liquor you've never tried but need to. It is said to date back to the time of the Totonacs, long before the Aztecs would dominate the region. It is an aromatic liqueur based on aguardiente (basically a less refined rum), infused with a blend of aromatic botanicals (aka, herbs). The drink is popular in the town of Cuetzalan, where it is made using from 20 to 30 different herbs, including mint, basil, oregano, thyme, lemon balm, sage, and wormwood. Modern versions are often sweetened with piloncillo, an unrefined brown sugar though the traditional elixir has a bitter flavor. An adventurous epicure would seek out several different examples to compare, contrast, and understand its many faces.
