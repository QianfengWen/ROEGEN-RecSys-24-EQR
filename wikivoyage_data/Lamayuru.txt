Lamayuru, also spelt Lamayouro, is a small village between Kargil and Leh in Ladakh, India.


Understand[edit]
Lamayuru is home to one of the oldest monasteries in Ladakh, dating back to the 10th century. Local legend has it that the place was once a lake that dried up. The village has around 100 houses scattered around the Lamayuru Monastery.

Get in[edit]
Lamayuru village is 125 km from Leh on the Leh–Srinagar Highway. Any vehicle going from Leh to Kargil, or on to Srinagar, will invariably pass through Lamayuru. State transport buses ply from Leh bus stand to Lamayuru at 08:00 and 14:00; however, it's wiser to visit the bus stand a day before to confirm the timings.
