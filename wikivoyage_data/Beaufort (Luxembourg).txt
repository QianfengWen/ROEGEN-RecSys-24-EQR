Beaufort is a town in the west of the Mullerthal region of Luxembourg.


Understand[edit]
Beaufort is a town built around the Beaufort Castle, built in the 11th century. It however, has been expanded many times since. In the Thirty Year War it got damaged severely and fell into ruins. The main castle got restored, but the knights' castle slowly decayed. The castle has been a cultural heritage site since 1850, and is owned by the Luxembourgian state since 1981.
