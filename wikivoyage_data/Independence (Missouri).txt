The Community of Christ World Headquarters
Independence, known as the Queen City of the Trails, is a city in western Missouri just east of Kansas City with a population of approximately 110,000.  Independence's founding predates that of Kansas City, and it was home to U.S. President Harry S. Truman and the legendary actress Ginger Rogers, as well as the starting point of three of America's great Westward Trails: the Santa Fe Trail, the California Trail, and the Oregon Trail.  The city also hosts numerous historical sites related to the Community of Christ (formerly RLDS), Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the "Mormons"), American Civil War and Western history.
While offering a full range of entertainment and lodging options for visitors, Independence generally tends to be more "quiet" than its larger neighbor to the west.  One notable exception is Labor Day weekend, when it holds its annual Santa-Cali-Gon Days, one of the most important yearly festivals held in the Kansas City metropolitan area.  Another exception is during the biennial April general conferences of the Community of Christ, the second-largest Latter-day Saint denomination, whose world headquarters is in the city.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Interstate 70 is the main east-west highway, while Interstate 435 (running north-south) passes just to the city's west.  U.S. highways 24 and 40 and Missouri state highway 291, which becomes Interstate 470, south of I-70, also provide access to the city.  I-70 offers six exits to Independence (from west to east, in order: Blue Ridge Blvd., U.S. 40/Sterling Ave., Noland Rd., Lee's Summit Rd., MO-291/I-470, and Little Blue Parkway), while I-435 offers three (from north to south, in order: U.S. 24/Winner Road, Truman Rd., and 23rd St.). At each of these three I-435 exits, you must turn east to head into Independence!  Turning west will take you into Kansas City.  Also, if you are taking I-435 south on the east side of Kansas City (as opposed to the west side; I-435 circles the Kansas City metropolitan area) and planning to exit onto I-70 east, be aware that this exit is a left exit, and it can be very slow-moving during "rush hour" times!

By bus[edit]
Nearest Greyhound station is in Kansas City, MO.

By train[edit]
Amtrak, ☏ +1-800-USA-RAIL (872-7245). The unattended 39.086874-94.4297641 Independence Amtrak is at 600 S Grand Ave, near the intersection with W Pacific Ave. This station, locally known as the Truman Depot, is on Amtrak's Kansas City to St. Louis route, the Missouri River Runner, and offers trains twice daily in both directions. Tickets cannot be purchased or baggage checked at this station, which houses the Jackson Co. Genealogical Society, so it is best to call Amtrak's toll-free reservation center or visit their website before departure. Tickets may also be purchased locally at Union Station in downtown Kansas City. A ticket is not required for boarding, though a reservation is. The route boasts a 90% on-time rating.

By plane[edit]
Access by air requires use of one of three airports:

39.2975-94.7138892 Kansas City International Airport is 40 mi (64 km) away.  To reach Independence from the airport take I-29 south to I-435 east, then follow I-435 east and then south along KC's east side until you cross the Missouri River; after passing the Front St. exit south of the river, you'll see the Independence exits.
39.123333-94.5927783 Charles B. Wheeler Downtown Airport, located in downtown KCMO, serves private, corporate and charter aircraft.  From this airport, take I-70 east.
38.959694-94.3713614 Lee's Summit Municipal Airport (About 5 mi (8 km) south of Independence just off I-470 at 2751 NE Douglas Rd. From this airport, take I-470/MO 291 north until reaching I-70. Continue north on MO 291 (I-470 ends here; only MO 291 continues) into Independence or go west on I-70 for other Independence exits.), ☏ +1 816 969-1186. Serves private aircraft.   (updated Apr 2022)
Get around[edit]
By bus[edit]
The Metro, Kansas City's municipal bus service, has very limited service (time and route-wise) within Independence.  The main Independence terminal is located next to the police station at the intersection of Truman and Noland roads.  Fares cost $1.50 full price (including one transfer within two hours of the ticket's purchase), or $0.75 reduced fare (seniors, those under age 18, and disabled persons).  A "Visitor's Pass" is available for out-of-towners; it allows unlimited riding of the entire Kansas City bus system for three days for $8.  Information is available at [1].

On foot[edit]
Walking tours of the historic town square, Truman historical sites and Mormon historical sites are available.  For most visitors, a car, bicycle or other means of wheeled transportation will prove necessary if one intends to venture very far beyond the central square area, which contains most of the attractions listed below.

By taxi[edit]
Local taxi service is available, but taxies are generally only obtainable by phone and sometimes require a lengthy waiting period between the time when you first call for the cab and the time that it arrives to pick you up.  Calling well in advance of your appointment or desired arrival time is advised, as is checking with the taxi service as to the expected time of the cab's arrival.

39.090833-94.4263898 The Temple, 1001 W Walnut St,. Constructed from 1990-94, sits adjacent to the original "Temple Lot," and clearly dominates the city skyline. Designed by famed Japanese architect Gyo Obata, the edifice evokes the spiral shell of the Nautilus by using a stainless steel spire that rises 300 ft (91 m).

 Santa-Cali-Gon Days. An annual Labor Day weekend festival held intermittently since 1940 and continuously since 1973. It celebrates the city's heritage as the starting point of three great frontier trails, and has changed throughout the years: In the 1940s, men grew their beards from one Sant-Cali-Gon to the next in beard-growing contests, whereas the 1950s saw exhibitions of horses and covered wagons, together with numerous other items that might have been purchased in Independence before heading West. The festival, while retaining some of its old customs, has shifted to a carnival atmosphere, with numerous rides, booths and other venues offering a variety of food, beverages, crafts, entertainment (including Country and Gospel Music singers), and similar attractions.

Stay safe[edit]
Although violent crime is very uncommon in Independence, it is not unknown.  Carjackings, vandalism to cars and auto thefts do occur, and while the chances of being a victim are slim (though still higher than the MO and national averages), visitors should not allow the "small town" atmosphere of this city trick them into letting down their guard with regard to locking autos and hotel doors, leaving cars running unattended, paying attention to surroundings, etc.  The Square area is relatively safe during daylight and evening hours.
The west side, particularly the portion west of Sterling Ave., is not known to be particularly safe at night, especially along Blue Ridge Blvd. between 23rd St. and U.S. 24.  Avoid anything west of Sterling Ave. at night if possible.  Since there are no hotels, restaurants or tourist attractions in this part of town, this should not be hard for visitors to do.

The site, now a state park, offers a free museum, picnicking, and a walking tour of part of the old battlefield, where remnants of the old trenches and fortifications remain visible. Adjacent to the museum is the Anderson House, which served as a hospital during the battle (a small fee is charged to tour). Lexington is worth a full day or more in its own right, with numerous Antebellum houses and the Wentworth Military Academy.   (updated Apr 2022)
