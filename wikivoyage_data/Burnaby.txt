Burnaby is a suburb of Vancouver.  It was incorporated in 1892 and achieved City status in 1992. In the first 30 to 40 years after its incorporation, the growth of Burnaby was influenced by its location between expanding urban centres of Vancouver and New Westminster. It first served as a rural agricultural area supplying nearby markets. Later, it served as an important transportation corridor between Vancouver, the Fraser Valley and the Interior of the Province.

(updated Mar 2022)
  Passengers can pay for fares using Compass Cards ($6 refundable deposit), Compass Tickets, or tap-to-pay using contactless credit cards (only American Express, Mastercard or Visa) or mobile wallets. Passengers using Compass Cards and Compass Tickets pay discounted fares. Passengers can transfer for up to 90 minutes, except if taking West Coast Express, in which case they can transfer for up to 120 minutes. On bus and HandyDART, passengers can also pay in cash, but in that case will not receive change and are not eligible for transfers.   Zone based fares apply between Monday and Friday for trips starting before 6:30 pm, if travel involves SkyTrain or SeaBus. Outside of those hours or for travel on only bus or HandyDART, a single zone rate applies. If traveling by West Coast Express, a higher cost zone based fare system applies regardless of time of travel.   Children 12 and under can ride for free.

Two SkyTrain rail rapid transit lines operate in Burnaby. The Expo line connects the city to Vancouver's neighbourhoods of downtown, Gastown-Chinatown, Yaletown-False Creek and East Van, and beyond Vancouver to New Westminster and Surrey. The Millennium line connects the northern part of the city with East Van to the west and Coquitlam and Port Moody to the east. The approximate travel time from downtown Vancouver to Metrotown (central Burnaby) on Skytrain is 20 minutes.
Those two SkyTrain lines loop around Burnaby with plenty of stops, but unless you're looking to get to a shopping mall, it will not provide direct access to the city's attractions. It can be used with the buses to get where you want to go, although it will rarely be the fastest way.
