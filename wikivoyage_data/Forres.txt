Forres is a town in Moray in northeast Scotland, with a population of 9090 in 2020. By the second century AD it was sufficiently famous (it's unclear whatever for) to be mapped as Οὐάραρ εἴσχυσις — "Varar Estuary" — by Claudius Ptolemy of Alexandria. Forres has whisky distilleries that can be visited and an elegant castle, but Ptolemy wasn't to know that.


Understand[edit]
"You should have stayed on A96"
In Gaelic, Forres is Farrais, meaning "near water", the Findhorn estuary. The earliest traces of local habitation were found a few miles inland and date to circa 3000 BC, but the town only emerges into history in the 10th century, along with the unified nation of Scotland. Precisely how unified was what its nobles mostly fought about, and one such warrior was Duncan I (1001-1040). In 1039 he attacked Durham, which turned out to be not at all in unified Scotland, and his shattered army limped home. Nothing daunted, next year he marched north against Moray, a large territory stretching all the way to Viking Caithness. Moray was ruled by Macbeth, who killed Duncan in battle near Elgin. "That shall be king hereafter...." — so Macbeth was crowned King of Scotland. No witchcraft was involved, but some 560 years later a fellow called Shakespeare, living in an age that (unlike the 10th century) fervently believed in witches, reckoned he could improve the story.

Get in[edit]
"How far is't called to Forres? What are these, so withered and wild in their attire?"

Sueno's Stone
Forres town centre is mostly Victorian low-rise, a lot more peaceful since the bypass was built. The Tolbooth was built in 1838; no tours.
57.615639-3.5976671 Sueno's Stone  is a 6.5 m sandstone slab with Pictish carvings, probably 10th century, on the main road east end of Forres. No-one knows who Sueno or Sven was (if he existed), but it probably commemorates a battle victory. It's nowadays enclosed in a glass case to protect it from the weather, and to stop the three witches escaping. In the Macbeth legend, they were eventually imprisoned within the stone.
The Witches Stone on Victoria Rd just east of Grant Park is a boulder supposedly marking the spot where an 11th-century witch was elaborately put to death, for having cursed King Duncan. The story doesn't stand up because witch-hunts didn't get going in Scotland until centuries later, then James V made up for lost time.
Grant Park is along Victoria Rd east of town centre. There's a cricket pitch, bowling green, play-park, floral displays, and a sunken garden where Forres House used to stand. Woodland walks lead up to Nelson's Tower on Cluny Hill.

Incur dreadful bad luck by quoting Shakespeare's Macbeth at inopportune moments. The Three Witches met on the heath just outside town, and King Duncan's castle was here while Macbeth's was in Inverness. Duncan and Macbeth were real 11th century rulers, but Macbeth's line died out, so Shakespeare could depict him as a royal demonic villain without getting into trouble.
