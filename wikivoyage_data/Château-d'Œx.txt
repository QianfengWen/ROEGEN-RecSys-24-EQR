Map of Château-d'Œx
By train[edit]
The 46.47497.13241 station of Château-d'Œx has hourly trains to Montreux (1 hr) and Zweisimmen (50 min) via Gstaad (30 min) in the Bernese Highlands. The trip will take a bit longer if you take a regional slow train. The train is operated by GoldenPass Montreux-Bernese Oberland (MOB) Railway. Some of the connections are panorama trains or old style 'classic' trains which do not cost extra and are part of the regular timetable.
There is a bus to Col-des-Mosse from where it is possible to join Aigle via another bus to Le Sépey and a train to Aigle, however it is much easier and faster to take the longer route via train passing through Montreux.

By car[edit]
Château-d'Œx is approximately a 2-hour drive from Geneva and a 1-hour and 15-minute drive to Bern. While not directly accessible by a motorway, driving into Château-d'Œx is not difficult. It can be accessed from three directions. The main road comes in from Spiez (with access to the A6 motorway) and Zweisimmen in the Bernese Highlands and goes on to Aigle (with access to the A9 motorway) near the border to Valais. Another smaller road leads into the canton of Fribourg, to Gruyères and Bulle, where you can join the A12 motorway.

Get around[edit]
Château-d'Œx is small enough that walking is the easiest and most efficient method of transportation to get anywhere in the village. Château-d'Œx is hilly, however, so any walk may involve a steep hike at one point or another.
