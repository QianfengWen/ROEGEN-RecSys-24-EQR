On foot[edit]
Bled is small enough to cover on foot. A walk around the lake will take just over an hour.

By pletna[edit]
The traditional way to reach the lake's island is by a pletna boat, which resembles a huge gondola. The round-trip fare is fixed at €12 per person, and the rowers will typically wait to get minimum ten people on the boat before departing. The entire trip takes 90 minutes, including 60 minutes of rowing and 30 minutes on the island. The pletnas depart from various locations around the lake. For reservations visit web site www.pletna.si

By rowboat[edit]
A popular method of travel to the island church is by renting a rowboat.

By bicycle[edit]
Bled and the vicinity are great for riding bicycles, which can be rented at many outdoor agencies. There are no designated bike lanes in Bled. Cycling off-road or off-track is not allowed in Slovenia. A list of suggested bike routes is available here.

By horse[edit]
Horses are available for rent, with or without guides/instructors, at most outdoor agencies. In addition, horse-drawn carriages are available for rides around the lake, to the castle, and further afield.

Connect[edit]
Bled has 4G from all Slovenian carriers. As of Sept 2021, 5G has not reached the town.

Stay safe[edit]
Be sure to take necessary precautions when participating in outdoor activities.
Bled can become extremely crowded during the summer months especially at weekends.  A visit during winter, while cold, presents you with the chance to see a frozen Lake Bled and have the place to yourself.  Alternatively those seeking a bit of peace will find that the side of the lake opposite the town is often somewhat quieter.
