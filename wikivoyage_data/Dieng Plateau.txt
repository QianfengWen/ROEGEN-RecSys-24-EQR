The Dieng Plateau is an upland volcanic plain in Central Java, famous for its scenery and ancient Hindu temples.

Hindu temples dating back to the 8th century

Understand[edit]
The Dieng Plateau is a caldera complex formed by the ancient eruption of Mount Prau. The caldera was once filled with water and dried up over time. Volcanic activity continues to this day, with sulphuric fumes and poisonous lakes. At an altitude of 2,000 m (6,600 ft), it's much cooler than the surrounding lowlands. It is located in the regencies of Wonosobo and Banjarnegara.

History[edit]
The ancient Javanese Hindus built temples on the plateau, considering it a sacred place. The word Dieng is from the Sanskrit di (abode) and hyang (gods), and so means Abode of the Gods. Hundreds of temples were built between the 8th and 13th centuries by the Sanjaya dynasty, but only eight are left. They resemble those of Prambanan, but on a smaller scale. Local people refer to the temples according to the characters in ancient Javanese Hindu legends based on the Mahabharata and Ramayana stories.

Landscape[edit]
The hills around Dieng are intensively farmed.
Dieng is growing rich on agriculture. Its cool climate allows carrots, cabbages and potatoes to be grown. But the demand is so strong that farming is moving up onto steeper and steeper slopes, large sheets of plastic swathe the fields to keep down weeds and water pipes snake across the landscape draining the lakes for irrigation.

Climate[edit]
Dieng is located at an altitude of ±2,100 meters (6,900 feet) above sea level and is surrounded by mountainous areas. Decorated with plants, bushes and cold air, Dieng is an area with natural scenery that gives a feeling of serenity.

Get in[edit]
The only way to get in is overland. The main gateway to the plateau, Wonosobo, can be reached by public bus from Yogyakarta, changing in Magelang. Yogayakarta to Magelang costs Rp15,000. In Magelang, take another bus to Wonosobo. Magelang to Wonosobo takes two hours, and costs Rp14,000. Wonosobo can also be reached from Purwokerto by bus. There are frequent trains from Jakarta to Purwokerto, as well as night buses. There is only one bus direct from Jakarta to Wonosobo, costing Rp75,000.
