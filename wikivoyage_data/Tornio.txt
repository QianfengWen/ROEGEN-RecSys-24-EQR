Tornio (Swedish: Torneå) is a city in Finnish Lapland, by the border to Sweden.
Tornio is mostly a summer destination or a place to visit for extensive shopping. While it may be a good place to view the northern lights, many things are closed during the winter – without necessarily being advertised as such.


Understand[edit]
A view to the Suensaari island, where the city centre is situated
Having been established in 1621 Tornio is by far the oldest city in Lapland. Today the city has approximately 21,000 inhabitants (2021). Tornio forms a unique economical zone together with the Swedish town Haparanda; the border between the countries is hardly visible. Tornio-Haparanda golf course is probably the only 18-hole golf course on Earth located in two countries, and the nation border runs right across the modern market square. The town lives strongly from border trade.
The famous Lapin Kulta brewery was established in 1873 but was closed in August 2010, and nowadays this famous brand is made in southern Finland. In 2016 brewing was restarted by Tornion panimo in the same building. The biggest employer in the Tornio area is the Steel company Outokumpu. Their huge steel mill is about 8 km south of the town centre. Tornio steel mill is not only the world's largest integrated stainless steel mill, but also the largest individual consumer of electricity in the Nordic countries. Its employment impact for the region is estimated at almost 8,000 people.

Get in[edit]
65°50′55″N 24°8′38″ETornio and the border to Sweden; Haparanda to the left

Tornio lies by the border, next to Haparanda, at the junction of the roads E4 through Sweden and E8 between Turku in south-western Finland and Tromsø in north-western Norway. E75 from Helsinki in the south and Utsjoki in the north passes not too far away.
If arriving from Sweden, check Haparanda#Get in and notice the time zone difference. Also Norway uses CET.

By car[edit]
From most of Finland you will arrive along either the E8 or the E75, at least the last leg by the former.
E8 comes down from the north along the Swedish border. E4 comes down via Inari and Rovaniemi and joins E8 in Keminmaa 15 km south from Tornio. 
E8 comes up from the south by the coast via Vaasa, while E4 keeps inland until before Oulu. Oulu also has some significant roads from the east.
From most of Sweden, E4 via Haparanda is the obvious choice, although there are other options.

By train[edit]
In season VR has a night train from the south to Kolari, stopping in Tornio. The station is named Tornio-Itäinen ("Tornio East"). More trains (those to Rovaniemi) stop in Kemi, 30 km away, where you can transfer to bus. The Haparanda station in Sweden is 3 km from the centre of Tornio, with a few trains from Luleå. The overnight trains from southern Sweden terminate in Luleå, with an express coach for the last stretch.

From most of Norway the easiest route is through Sweden. From Troms and Finnmark, there are connections via Rovaniemi, some of them only in summer. There should be a service via Utsjoki year round. Eskelisen Lapinlinjat is the main operator.

By plane[edit]
The nearest airport is Kemi-Tornio 20 km from the centre, where Finnair runs scheduled flights from Helsinki. From there you'll have to continue with by bus (see Matkahuolto); the nearest bus stop from Kemi airport is named Kemi lentoasema th. Oulu airport is farther away, but the fares are usually cheaper and flights more frequent. From Sweden, fly to Luleå and take the bus to Haparanda-Tornio travel centre.
