Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
It's a 20- to 30-minute drive from Invercargill.

By boat[edit]
-46.5984168.3461 Stewart Island Experience. This is a scheduled passenger ferry service from Stewart Island, with 2-4 departures per day depending on the season. They run buses from Invercargill to connect with their ferries (see below). $99 per person each way (half price for children). (updated Nov 2022)
By bus[edit]
The only bus service to Bluff is the Stewart Island Ferry coach transfer shuttle from Invercargill, which can be reserved through the online ferry booking system. By reservation only, $30pp each way (half price for children). Runs two to three times per day, in sync with the ferry departures. You can book it separately from the ferry, so you could use it even if you aren't getting on the boat, but it's unlikely you'll want to spend $30 just to go hang out in Bluff. 
Provides pre-arranged pickup from the Invercargill airport and most accommodations in Invercargill. Try to either provide a New Zealand phone number or else show up 15 minutes early at the pickup site: the driver needs to pick people up at several different places, and expects to be able to get in touch with you either by phone or through the desk of your hotel.

Stewart Island, most of which is a conservation area, is accessible by ferry. The trip takes an hour and can be very rough if the wind is strong, which it often is. There are many hikes on the island and the chance to see kiwis (the bird, that is) because they can be seen during daylight hours here.
