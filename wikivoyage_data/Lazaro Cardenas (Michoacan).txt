Container ship terminal in Lazaro Cardenas
In 1970, the town was re-named Lázaro Cárdenas, in honor of one of Mexico's most popular presidents. A native of Michoacan, Lázaro Cárdenas was a general who fought in the Mexican Revolution on the side of the Constitutionalists. Elected president in 1934, Cardenas was a dedicated reformist who fulfilled many of the promises of the Revolution, making him hugely popular with the Mexican people and hugely unpopular with rich capitalists and foreign industrialists who found their abusive practices of exploitation and corruption severely curtailed. Cardenas was responsible for much of the post-revolution land reform initiatives (such as the creation of ejidos for Indigenous groups) and the appropriation of foreign owned oil assets together with the creation of the national oil company, Pemex. Many towns across Mexico are named in honor of Cardenas as are roads, schools, parks and public facilities.
