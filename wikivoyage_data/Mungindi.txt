Mungindi is a town (population 747 in 2016) on the Barwon River, straddling the New England region of New South Wales and the Darling Downs region of Queensland in Australia. Unusually, it is one of the few towns around in Australia where it's located in two jurisdictions, unlike other cities like Albury-Wodonga where they're considered as "twin-cities".


Understand[edit]
The name Mungindi means 'waterhole in the river' in the indigenous Kamilaroi language. The European explorer Major Thomas Mitchell passed through the district in the 1830s in search of areas for agricultural development. A ford just upstream from the present bridge became the location of a camp for drovers moving stock across the border, and a meeting place for the Kamilaroi people. A hotel was established in 1863, and the first blocks of land in the settlement were sold in 1888. 
Mungindi is the only place in the Southern Hemisphere that keeps its name on both side of the border. The southern part of the district is in the Moree Plains Shire Council local government area (based in Moree), while the northern part of the district is shared between the Goondiwindi Region local government area (based in Goondiwindi) and the Balonne Shire Council local government area (based in St George). The state border runs through the middle of the Barwon River, but this is not marked on the bridge. For the sake of convenience, addresses will not give which state they are in, as Mungindi is small enough to navigate around and there is no restriction to crossing the state border.
Note that the New South Wales side observes Australian Eastern Daylight Savings Time (UTC +11) from the first Sunday in October until the first Sunday in April, while the Queensland side observes Australian Eastern Standard Time (UTC +10) all year round. Hours are New South Wales Time unless indicated otherwise.
