Alaşehir is a city in the Central Aegean region of Turkey. It's agricultural, stands about 100 km east of Izmir and the coast, and in 2022 had a population of 104,717. 


Understand[edit]
The city was founded in 189 BC by Eumenes II of Pergamon. His successor was his brother Attalus II Philadelphos, and the town was called Philadelphia, which means "brotherly love". It's on higher ground above the Gediz River and has always been agricultural - sultanas are its best known product. Around 90 AD it hosted one of the "Seven Churches of Asia" addressed by St John of Patmos (Revelation 3:7–13), the only one spared his biliousness, but praised for its enduring faith. As part of the Byzantine Empire, the city held out against the Ottomans - they called it "the many-coloured city", hence ala şehir - until 1390.  It had a large Greek population until the war of 1919-22, when much of it was destroyed by fire, so Alaşehir lacks old buildings and is humdrum 20th century architecture with few sights.

See[edit]
Church of St John
38.350128.51881 Kenan Evren Statue is a central rendezvous point in town, but time has not been kind to the memory of Evren (1917-2015). People now prefer to call it a liberation monument, and the statue has been lowered by removing the steps. Born in Alaşehir, he led the military coup of 1980 that deposed prime minister Demirel, suspended parliament and civil rights, and shot communists out of hand. He was thereby the seventh president of Turkey until 1989. In 2014 he was jailed for his actions and busted to private, but this was still under appeal at his death, so it's as a general that he lies buried in Ankara.
38.349428.51742 Church of St John (Filadelfiya Kilisesi), İsmet Paşa Cd 114. M-Sa 09:00-18:00. Three stumps from arches in the basilica built around 600 AD, and decorative slabs in the garden, and that's all. (updated Dec 2023)
Yıldırım Beyazıt Mosque just north of the church was built around 1400 AD late in the reign of Bayezid I (1360-1403).
City walls survive as a stretch alongside Süleyman Demirel Blv east of the Otogar, turning south along İnönü Cd.
