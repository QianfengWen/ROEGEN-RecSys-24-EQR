Klaipėda is a city in Lithuania Minor, the narrow northwest coastal region of Lithuania. It's the country's third-largest city, with a population in 2023 of 158,420, and a busy industrial harbour.
The city has historic sights but isn't pretty-pretty like Vilnius Old Town, and draws mostly local tourism. The big attraction is the Curonian Spit, a remarkable 99 km peninsula of sand dunes - Smiltynė at its north tip is part of the city and is reached by a five-minute ferry ride from downtown. Facilities in the northern third of the spit are therefore described on this page, while those in the centre are described on the Nida page. Its south is part of Kaliningrad Oblast, an exclave of Russia.


Understand[edit]
Street in Klaipėda
Klaipėda is at the mouth of the River Danė, which flows into the Curonian Lagoon, the freshwater lake enclosed by the Curonian Spit; the lagoon here discharges into the Baltic. Its harbour is ice-free, a valuable site on this cold sea, so it's been fought over many times. The castle was built by the Teutonic Knights in 1253 and for much of its history the city was part of Prussia. German-speaking people called it "Memel" for the larger river feeding the lagoon further south, nowadays the border with the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. Timber export has long been the port's main trade, along with other agricultural produce such as wool. After the First World War Memel and its hinterland were declared a "Free City" similar to Gdańsk / Danzig, but newly-independent Lithuania annexed it in 1923. Nazi Germany grabbed it in 1939: after the Second World War it reverted to the far-from-independent Lithuanian SSR, a communist satellite state of the USSR. That grey empire broke up in 1990 and Klaipėda like other Baltic cities developed modern western industries.

See below for the ferries across the channel from Smiltynė on Curonian Spit. With the right documentation it's possible to drive up the Curonian Spit from Kaliningrad Oblast in Russia, crossing the border near Nida, and on north up Highway 167 to the ferry terminal. Bicycles are also permitted across that border but not pedestrians, and there is no public transport across.

Get around[edit]
Klaipėda reunited with Lithuania in 1923
By bus[edit]
The city stretches north-south along the coast, so many routes are from the university quarter to the bus and railway station then south along H Manto gatvė across the bridge into Old Town, continuing down Tiltų g towards Acropolis shopping centre. For example Bus 8 runs every 5-10 min down this spine along Taikos Prospekt. Bus 9 runs every 10 min closer to shore, passing by Old ferry terminal, the castle and south to New ferry terminal and the shipping port. For routes and timetables see Klaipėda Transport website. 
A single paper ticket costs €0.80 from a kiosk and €1 from the bus driver. Validate your ticket immediately on boarding.
Further out, Bus N1 runs down the spit every two hours, connecting with the ferries at Smiltynė old ferry terminal. It carries bikes and goes to Juodkrantė and Nida, taking 65 min.
Klaipėda scrapped its trams in 1967. There is interest in restoring them, but the cost looks prohibitive.

By taxi[edit]
The easiest way to call a taxi is with the eTAKSI app for smartphones, or call +370 633 44 553. 
In 2023 flagfall is €1 then €0.80/km, so a ride from the bus / railway station to Old Town might be €3.40.

Only a single bastion remains of this moated castle, built in 1253 by the Livonian Order of Teutonic Knights; its wooden predecessor on the opposite river bank has long disappeared. For the next 500 years rival powers queued up to smash it down then build it up again, with the last reconstruction in 1763. Thereafter even the Prussians couldn't think of a military role for it, so it fell derelict and its masonry was stripped.
