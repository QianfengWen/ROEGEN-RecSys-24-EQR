Downtown Boa Vista
Boa Vista is the capital of the state of Roraima in the north of Brazil. Most foreigners pass through en route between Manaus and Venezuela.


Understand[edit]
For a Brazilian state capital this size (about 437,000 in 2021), Boa Vista is remarkably quiet. Judging by the number of evangelical churches, Jesus has his equatorial stronghold here. Despite being more than 100 years old, the city has the aspects of a planned capital, with wide modern streets and traffic circles. Historical references are difficult to find.
