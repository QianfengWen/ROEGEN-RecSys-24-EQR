Twillingate  is a town of 2,200 people (2016) in northeastern Newfoundland.


Understand[edit]
Twillingate's economy revolves primarily around careers in construction, logging and the tertiary sector, which involves providing services to the community. Because of the cod moratorium in 1992, fishing is not practised as much in the area, though some fishermen still catch crab, lobster and other aquatic species. The seal hunt is practised in Twillingate.
Tourism throughout the summer months is also a big part of the economy in the Twillingate area. The town is known as the "Iceberg Capital of the World" because of the scenery and icebergs that are seen in the spring months.

History[edit]
The earliest known people to inhabit the area were the Maritime Archaic, who occupied the area 3,500 years ago in 1500 BC. The Maritime Archaic people were later supplanted by the Beothuk, and possibly the Dorset Inuit, who occupied the area until the arrival of European settlers.
The French had been fishing in the area, possibly as early as 1500, but the first European settlers did not arrive until the 17th century. The European settlers were mostly fishermen and their families from the West Country in England. The native Beothuk managed to survive until the early 19th century in small numbers near Twillingate and the mouth of the Exploits River.
As the population grew, Twillingate became an important fishing community. It was a busy trade and service centre for Labrador and the northern shore fisheries for more than two centuries.
Since the Fisheries and Oceans Canada moratorium on fishing northern cod was announced in 1992, followed shortly after by the collapse of the fishing industry, Twillingate has turned to the tourist industry for income and is becoming a popular spot for visitors in the summer.

Get in[edit]
One of the many fishing communities along the scenic coastline
From the western coast of Newfoundland, take Route 340 (Road to the Isles) from the Trans-Canada Highway through Lewisporte. Driving north on Route 340 from Lewisporte or Gander to Twillingate, you will pass through many other small fishing communities, including Boyd's Cove, Summerford, Virgin Arm and Newville.
From the east coast of Newfoundland, take Route 330 (Cooper Blvd. in Gander) from the Trans-Canada Highway through Gander Bay, then turn right onto Route 340 to Twillingate.
Twillingate is approximately 1.5 hours from Gander and about a hour from Lewisporte.

Get around[edit]
Twillingate is relatively easy to navigate. Arriving on the island via Route 340, continue straight to reach the main area of town or turn left for Black Duck Cove, a small community on the island. The next small community is Purcell's Harbour, followed by Little Harbour, another small drive-through village. Drive another three kilometres and you will be in Twillingate.
The first street you will see (and will already be on) is Toulinguet Street, with several gas stations and stores. On your left, the first street is Rink Road (Bayview Street) that leads to Bayview (another subdivision of Twillingate) and the George Hawkins Memorial Stadium, home of the Fish Fun and Folk Festival.
After that, Toulinguet Street ends with a final intersection. Turning left will take you to Main Street North and the famous Long Point Lighthouse, while a right turn will lead you onto Main Street South to Durrell.
