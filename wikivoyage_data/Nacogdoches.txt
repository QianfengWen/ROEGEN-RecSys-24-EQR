Understand[edit]




Legend of the Two Brothers
According to legend, Nacogdoches was founded by one of two brothers, son of a Caddo chief who lived along the Sabine River. One day, he sent the brothers away, one of them three nights to the west, where he founded Nacogdoches, and the other three nights to the east, where he founded Natchitoches, in modern-day Louisiana. The spelling difference in the two is attributed to Spanish versus French transliteration.


After periodic settlement dating back 10,000 years, Nacogdoches first became a permanent village around 1300, settled by the mound-building Caddo people. After Europeans began exploring the area, Nacogdoches was an important trading post for French and Spanish pioneers. Permanent Spanish presence began here in 1716 with the establishment of a mission, and the city remained the most important city in East Texas for over a hundred years. In its history it has flown the flags of three abortive republics in addition to the six flags that have flown over the rest of Texas.
