Děčín is a city in North Bohemia. It lies on the River Elbe in a beautiful and diverse landscape, surrounded by the Central Bohemian Uplands, Elbe Sandstone Mountains and Bohemian Switzerland National Park.


Understand[edit]
Decin Castle and Elbe.
Děčín is a nice city in the valley of the Elbe, close to the main railway connecting Saxony and Prague. Before World War II, most of the inhabitants were ethnic Germans. After the war most of the German population was driven out, fled or was resettled and the new communist government redesigned the city destroying many historic buildings and building panel blocks in the process. Because of that, these days there is more than one city center in Děčín, which might be confusing. The main railway and bus station as well as the town hall are all located on the opposite bank of the Elbe than the castle and historical old town.  With a population of 47,000 in 2020, Decin is the 19th largest city in the country. The old German name for the town "Tetschen" most likely has the same root as the Czech name, which becomes obvious when you hear it pronounced in a Saxon accent.
