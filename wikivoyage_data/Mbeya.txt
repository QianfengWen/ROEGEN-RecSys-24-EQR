Drink[edit]
Shakesbeer's Garden: take the dalla dalla to Sae and walk down the main road for 3 min. This neighborhood gem will be just off the road to the left. Great bar to people watch and spend an afternoon alone or with a large group. If no food is available just ask- there are plenty places near by that will deliver right to you! Friendly staff, ask for Peter the owner, fluent English speaker.
Mbeya Golden City Hotel, Sae: to the left of the Sae dalla dalla stopgreat bar for a special occasion or to watch any major television event. Tasty food.
E Point: Sae across the street from the dalla dalla stand amongst smaller bars and shops. Excellent late night spot to dance, much less threatening to a small group than Pamozi, located in city center opposite the post office which is not to be missed but proceed with a little caution and a lot of common sense.
Mama 2000: great bandas all the way outside in the back- friendly staff, but be a proactive patron to get what you need, great entertainment some nights, pool tables, and hot soccer watching spot.
Weru Spring Garden,wonderful outdoor seating, very private and beautiful setting.
Babu Kubwas: sit outside and watch the happenings of Mbeya. Great bites and a well stocked market attached.
Peace of Mind: very quiet and quaint bar with limited outdoor seating. Excellent date night spot- make sure you have a lot to talk about because the food is special but time is taken.
Continental: sit outside and enjoy a bowl of mtori banana stew with chapati- no better way to cure a Tanzanian hangover than at the Continental Hotel.
 City Pub (on the main road behind Century Plaza). Has good, fresh food, with drinks, and they are reasonably fast. (updated Mar 2016)
Sleep[edit]
There are some guesthouses across from the bus station, convenient if you are heading to Malawi the next day. Avoid the travel agencies attached and ignore the many touts in the bus station, as many people have reported scams with transport, and do not trust the bus driver to give you the real destination, but ask other passengers instead.

Warsame Guesthouse is the town center, with clean rooms and some clean bathrooms. There is a small restaurant at the corner a minute walk. Room from TSh 15,000 without and TSh 20,000 with bathroom. Hot water is only in theory. (august 2023)
Katumba Guest House large rooms with large beds, nets, bathroom with hot shower, about 10 minute walk from center. From TSh 8,000-15,000 (May 2023).

Stay safe[edit]
For those who are travelling through Africa by vehicle, there is a very good garage just out of town on the Zambia road at Mbalizi behind the hospital at Mbalizi vocational training centre, best mechanics in Tanzania according to locals from many towns other than Mbeya, near Utengule Coffee lodge.
There are several bus ticket scams running out of Mbeya. The well-established scam artists attempt to sell tickets into various cities in Malawi. They have various price sheets and other documentation. They will even make phone calls to verify there is availability on the bus. One group even has an office in the Malawi transportation/bus center. They will get the passengers on a dalla-dallas that will just let them off at the border where there is supposed another bus that is waiting. Of course, there isn't.   As of April 2010 there are no buses that go directly from Mbeya to Malawi. The buses only go to the border town of Kyela.   

Go next[edit]
There is frequent local transport, both 30-seat "coaster" buses and dalla-dallas to Kyela. Double check that the driver can drop you off at the border ("boda-boda"). The border stop is only a 5-10 minute walk from the Songwe River bridge crossing into Malawi. There are bus services on the Malawi side of the border; going to Karonga, Mzuzu and further inland like Matours, Malawi Link and there are also shared taxis to Karonga cost about 1,500.00 Kwacha. For Itungi and Lake Nyasa (Lake Malawi), you will need to ride all the way to Kyela and secure additional transport from there.
Local transport also runs to Tunduma on the Zambian border; onward transportation can be arranged on the Zambian side.
If Mbeya is your stop off on entering Tanzania on the way to Dar es Salaam, try to head for Iringa next, an easy 4- to 5-hour bus ride. The district capital, Iringa is a good base for exploring the highlands along the Tanzam road. Buses are also available to Songea to the southeast, Sumbawanga to the northwest, or Tabora to the north, for connections to Kigoma or Mwanza.
