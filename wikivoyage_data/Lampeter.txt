Lampeter (Welsh: Llanbedr Pont Steffan) is a town of about 3,000 people (2011) in Ceredigion, Wales, on the River Teifi (which meets the Irish Sea at Cardigan).


Understand[edit]

Welsh language and culture continues to thrive in Lampeter. The town is best known for the University of Wales, Trinity Saint David (formerly University of Wales, Lampeter and before that St David's University College), which was founded in 1822 as a theological college. Its central building is modelled on an Oxbridge quadrangle and was completed in 1827. Lampeter University is the third oldest university in Britain, after Oxford and Cambridge.
The earliest written reference to Lampeter is believed to be 1187, when Owain Gwynedd destroyed the English king's castle of Pont Steffan ('Stephen's Bridge' in Welsh). The castle's remains formed the foundations for the college building and still forms part of the university campus.
