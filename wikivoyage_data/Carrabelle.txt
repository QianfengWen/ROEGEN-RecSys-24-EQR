Carrabelle is a city on the Forgotten Coast of Florida. It is the eastern end point of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. Visitirs are drawn by its white beaches and to visit the "World's Smallest Police Station".


Understand[edit]
Carrabelle was settled by "First Americans" thousands of years ago and archeological finds have shown that the area was a plentiful supplier of seafoods. It continues to be a sportsman's paradise, offering fishing, hunting, camping, hiking, birding and kayaking opportunities.
Carrabelle also has a long history as being a tourist attraction. In the early 1900s the city became a destination resort for travelers in the Southeast. A railroad was built, the Carrabelle, Florida and Georgia, to bring tourists to Carrabelle to enjoy the crystal white "sugar" beaches.
