Zaragoza is the capital and largest city of Aragon in Spain, and one of Spain's five largest cities, but it is one of the least known outside of Spain. Founded on the river Ebro during the Roman Empire as Cesaraugusta, Zaragoza now holds a large cultural and architectural heritage attesting to 2,000 years of affluence and importance. The city is best known for its Basilica del Pilar, built to venerate the apparition of the Virgin Mary to Saint James in very early Christian times, which became a major marker of cultural identity for Christian Spain. The city was again put on the global map by the 2008 Expo, which left it with a whole new modern part developed further for various purposes after the exhibition closed.

Roman Triclinium restored in Zaragoza
Zaragoza sits between Madrid and Barcelona on a high-speed railway line. It enjoys relative affluence, yet it is still often overlooked by tourists so prices, such as for accommodation, remain much lower than in either of Spain's most famous cities. It's a great stop along your way, or even a destination in its own right.


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
The city on the Ebro river was founded at the turn of the millennium by the Roman Emperor Augustus, and named after him as Caesaraugusta. 2,000 years later, the architectural remains of large public buildings indicate Caesar Augustus’ influence over the city. Today you can still admire the city’s Forum, Thermal Baths, the River Port or the Great Theatre, archeological remains which reflect the splendour of the city as it was during the Roman Empire. It was on the banks of the river Ebro that Saint James (called Santiago in Spanish) reportedly saw the apparition of Virgin Mary on the pillar, which is seen as the pivotal moment in the foundation of the Spanish Christian heritage.

The Aljafería Palace.
After the fall of the empire, the city and the rest of today's Spain, was conquered by the Goths and then by the Moors. Zaragoza, was the northernmost stronghold of the Moorish caliphate, and then emerged as a capital of its own kingdom, or Taifa. The founding of the Taifa in the 11th century was marked by the construction of the Aljafeira Palace, which remains one of few relatively intact monuments from that era. Despite being often on the front line, Zaragoza continued to develop as a major art and science centre.

Basilica del Pilar
As Zaragoza was regained by the Christian kings of Aragon, the development continued and the relative tolerance which Christians enjoyed under the Muslim rule was extended to the Moors initially. The Moorish artistic and architectural tradition was incorporated into the local architectural style called Mudéjar, of which many examples survive in Zaragoza. Under Christian rule, Zaragoza's two cathedrals, the original La seo and the Basilica del Pilar, were constructed to venerate the Virgin Mary apparition. The city's importance and affluence in the subsequent ages is reflected in its rich architectural heritage and many improvements given to its most important buildings, which gives them a number of layers of appeal.

Plaza de España
Zaragoza has retained relative affluence by becoming a major industrial hub, with factories spread over several industrial parks around the city, and a big logistics hub (named PLAZA, or Plataforma Logística de Zaragoza), taking advantage of its strategic location on the railway line between Madrid and Barcelona and its airport, focusing on freight. The Expo 2008 universal exhibition held in the city resulted in massive development of its western outskirts into exhibition grounds, which have been repurposed for business, civic services and public recreation grounds.

Climate[edit]
Zaragoza has a Continental Mediterranean climate, very dry, with cold winters and hot summers. With an average of 318 mm per year, rainfall is a rarity mostly occurring in spring. There is drought in summer with only a few storms in the late afternoon. In July and August temperatures are typically above 30°C (86°F), reaching up to 40°C (104°F) a few days per year. On those days you will quickly pick the idea of siesta: hiding away after lunch, during the hottest part of the day, to enjoy later the evenings and nights at a delightful 18-22°C.

Offering of Fruits at El Pilar.
In winter the temperatures are low, usually between 0 and 10°C (32-50°F), with some frosts during the night. Snow only shows up once every couple of years but fog is not uncommon (about 20 days from November to January). However, the only bad part is the Cierzo, a cold and dry wind blowing from the NW that is quite common on clear days, and can make your stay really unpleasant. Beware also of sunny days in spring and autumn, if the Cierzo blows, you will regret not having warm clothes with you.

When to visit[edit]
Easter in Zaragoza.
The best time to visit Zaragoza is during spring (April to mid-June) and autumn (Sept-Oct). In late June and July the days can be quite hot but in the evenings the city is bustling with people going out for dinner or having a beer with friends in a terrace. In August the city is almost deserted, with most people being on holidays at the mountains or the coast, and more than half the bars, restaurants and small business closed.
The major city festival is El Pilar that takes place every year the week of the 12th of October, with lots of concerts, performances and street animations. It is also the best time to see a bullfight in Zaragoza.
The Easter week, although not in the same league that the Andalucia or Calanda counterparts, is very scenic, with several processions going over the city centre every day with their dramatic sculptures, black-dressed praying women and hundreds of hooded people playing drums. It is a Spain's Festival of International Tourist Interest since 2014.

Get in[edit]
Terminal of Zaragoza Airport
By plane[edit]
41.666111-1.0416671 Zaragoza Airport (ZAZ  IATA) (is 10 km from the city centre). It is a relatively minor airport when it comes to passenger flights, but a major cargo hub seeing the world's largest airplanes land regularly. ZAZ receives regular flights, mostly by budget airlines such as Ryanair and Wizzair. Ryanair flies to its main bases across Europe, including London-Stansted, Bergamo, Beauvais and Charleroi, while Wizzair and several other airlines focus on Romania, where many of the local workers originate from. Other destinations are mostly seasonal flights to holiday destinations in Spain and abroad.   
Transfer to/from the airport: The cheapest option is the airport bus 501[dead link] stopping at Los Enlaces, Delicias train station, Avenida de Navarra, and Paseo de María Agustín 7, in the city centre (45 minutes ride). The bus costs €1.85 and runs every 30 minutes M-Sa and every hour on Sundays and holidays. Alternatively a taxi will cost around €25-30 and take around 20 minutes to the city centre.

Take the superfast AVE train to get to Zaragoza from Madrid or Barcelona in less than two hours
Nearby airports[edit]
As Zaragoza Airport has limited flight connections, it can be more convenient to fly to Madrid or Barcelona airports, from where you can reach Zaragoza in less than 3 hours.
From Madrid Barajas Airport: go to Atocha RENFE train station either by taxi (30 minutes, around €25) or by metro (45 min, €2) and then take the high speed train AVE to Zaragoza (1hr 30min, around €50). A cheaper but not so comfortable alternative is taking an ALSA coach that runs between Barajas terminal T4 and Zaragoza every 2–3 hours (3hr 45min trip, single/return: €15/€26). If you are in terminals T1 T2 or T3, take the free airport bus shuttle to terminal T4. The bus to Zaragoza stops in the same place as the airport shuttle. The ALSA ticket counter can be found inside the terminal and a vending machine with ALSA tickets is close to the bus bays.
From Barcelona Airport:  The easiest way is to take the half-hourly RENFE R2Nord suburban train to Barcelona Sants (20 min, €2.20), and then take the high speed train AVE to Zaragoza (1hr 45min, around €60). If you already have your AVE ticket, you can get the suburban train ticket for free in the automatic vending machines, by typing the code for “cercanías” that appears in your AVE ticket.

Delicias train station
By train[edit]
Zaragoza is served by the high speed train AVE that reaches Madrid in approximately 1hr 30 min, and Barcelona in about 1hr 45min. There are up to 19 trains a day in each direction for Madrid and 12 for Barcelona. Regular rates start at about €50 to Madrid and €60 to Barcelona, but you can get up to a 60% discount if you book through the web 15 days in advance.
The train tracks have been opened to private companies, so you can buy a ticket from or to Madrid for as low as €9. The possible options are Ouigo or Omio.
A cheaper way to get to Zaragoza from Barcelona is using the Regional Express - a slow train going on an ancient track, stopping at every small village and some post-industrial ghost towns, and really astonishing landscapes. The ride takes 5 hours, costs €22.
Other neighbouring cities like Huesca, Teruel, Pamplona, Logroño, Bilbao or Valencia are connected by a few daily conventional trains.
For more information on train schedules and prices, visit the website of RENFE. Note, there isn't a single cafe/bar with wifi in the station.
All trains and buses arrive at
41.658661-0.91122 Delicias station.    The city centre is some 2 km away from, and can be reached using urban buses 34 and 51 or by taxi (10 min, around €10).

By bus[edit]
You can reach Zaragoza either from Madrid or Barcelona in 3hr 45min. The coach company is ALSA and the single/return ticket costs around €15/€26.
Zaragoza is also well communicated with other main capital cities, such as Valencia and Bilbao.
There is possibility of getting to Zaragoza from France by bus. The main lines travel from Lourdes, Tarbes, Pau and Oloron.
For bus schedules from Barcelona, also try Barcelona Nord.

By car[edit]
Zaragoza is very well connected by free speedways with Huesca (1 hr), Teruel (2 hr), Madrid (3 hr), and by toll highways with Barcelona (3 hr, €30), Pamplona and Bilbao. Traffic around the city is relatively light except on some weekends and holidays.
Free parking in the city centre is very scarce. Most streets have metered parking limited to 1 or 2 hours. Underground paying parkings are scattered in the entire city and usually have free places.
Distances to Zaragoza: Madrid 312 km, Barcelona 307 km, Bilbao 305 km, Lleida/Lerida 150 km

By foot[edit]
The Carmen Gate is an example of the romanic period.
If you stay in or near the old town, most of the main attractions are within easy walking distance.

By bus or tram[edit]
A tram in Zaragoza
A transport card costs €7 at any tobacco kiosk (including an initial fee of €2, and credit of €5). With the card you will pay €0.74 for a journey and can change lines within an hour without being charged again. Single tickets bought from the driver are €1.35 (cash only).
Most bus routes have audio announcements and "next stop" displays inside the vehicle.
There is one tram line ("Tranvía") which runs from the north to the south west, through the city centre. The tram uses the same fare system as the buses - touch your card on a reader when boarding. More tram lines are projected to open soon.

Tourist bus[edit]
Sightseeing bus is another option. It costs €7 (free if you have the Zaragoza card) and the ticket can be used the entire day.

By taxi[edit]
The taxi drivers are plentiful and mostly honest.

By bicycle[edit]
There is a shared bicycle system called Bizi. It has a fairly good website in English which allows you to get a temporary subscription online beforehand. This subscription is valid for three days and costs €5.28. As with most shared bicycle system, the first 30 minutes are free after which you'll pay €0.52 per additional 30 minutes. This is up until 2 hours, after which you'll have to pay a penalty of €3.16 per hour. The deposit is €200.
After getting a temporary subscription online, you receive a subscription number which, together with your pin code of choice, enables you to take a bike immediately upon arrival in Zaragoza.
Bike availability is usually good, and there are plenty of stations in the city centre, as well as near the Delicias train station and the expo area.
However, in 2015, the screens of many bicycle stations were not properly working (broken, unreadable text, flickering). Since this makes it impossible to enter the subscription number and pin code and therefore also impossible to borrow a bike (though it probably still works for annual subscribers who have a contactless card), the system becomes somewhat unreliable.

See[edit]
Fuente de la Hispanidad in Plaza del Pilar.
Plaza del Pilar is the main square, just south of the River Ebro. On the square are the two cathedrals and the "Fuente de la Hispanidad", a fountain and sculpture representing Columbus' discovery of the New World. The tourist office is here as well.

Churches[edit]
Nuestra Señora del Pilar by the Ebro river.
41.65676-0.878531 Cathedral-Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar (Nuestra Señora del Pilar). The more famous of the two cathedrals is the one on the bank of the river Ebro. Holding an additional rank of basilica, this cathedral venerates the Virgin Mary who reportedly appeared to Saint James the Apostle on said riverbank during his travels in Iberia. Mary appeared on a pillar, which led to her being venerated under this particular name and also gave origin to the unusual Spanish female given name Pilar.Saint James is believed to have had a small shrine constructed by the pillar, of which nothing remains, but subsequently a large basilica was built on the site in the 3rd century under the rule of the Roman Emperor Constantine. This basilica has been rebuilt over the years, and became a Gothic church in the 15th century. The present-day version of the church superseded it and was constructed on the orders of King Charles II of Spain between 1681 and 1872. The protracted construction has been caused by frequent redesigns, including a reorientation, additions of towers and cupolas. It also allowed for the domes to be painted by Francisco Goya a century after the construction started, and the vault paintings are now one of the main attractions on the inside of the cathedral.   
The baroque tower, neoclassical facade and mudejar dome of la seo
41.65468-0.875652 Cathedral of the Savior of Zaragoza (La Seo de Zaragoza). summer: 10:00-21:00, winter: 10:00-18:30. Located on the Plaza de la Seo, the cathedral is referred to as la seo ("the see") to distinguish it from the other cathedral, el pilar. La Seo has originally been constructed one the site one of the first mosques during the Moorish domination of Aragon, built perhaps as early as the 8th century, and destroyed to make way for a romanesque church in the 12th century. Zaragoza became an independent diocese in the 14th century and the church became its cathedral, immediately being afforded renovations in the gothic and moorish (mudéjar) styles. Many other reconstructions followed, due to both changing tastes and architectural necessities, as parts of the cheaply-built cathedral began to fail over time, including the collapse of the its in the 15th century.In the 17th century, the church has been involved in a canon law battle with the newly-reconstructed Basilica of Our Lady on the Pillar over which should be the seat of the diocese and thus the cathedral, which finally saw Pope Clement X declare them joint cathedrals with special provisions to make sure both enjoy equal status. La Seo is now a mixture of styles spanning between 12th and 19th centuries, and features an exquisite collection of tapestries. Entrance closes sometimes during the day when there's mass. €4.   
 Iglesias Mudejares (Moorish churches). Mudejar is a style that mixes Christian and Muslim tradition. Good examples of that are a part of La Seo cathedral, Magdalena church, San Miguel church and San Pablo church. 
41.65245-0.873783 Iglesia de Santa María Magdalena. Distinctive for its square tower and polygonal apse, la Magdalena stands out within the old town of Zaragoza as one of the few relatively intact examples of Mudéjar architecture of the 14th century. That said, its interior was renovated in the baroque period.   
41.6495-0.876484 Iglesia de San Miguel de los Navarros. Another example of Mudéjar architecture, with a square tower and polygonal apse reminiscent of that of la Magdalena. It retained a richly-gilded Renaissance high altar by Damian Forment, but its tower did not escape a baroque intervention in the form of a spire.   
41.65609-0.885975 Iglesia de San Pablo, Calle de San Pablo 42. The third Mudéjar church features a Gothic portal and another altar by Damián Forment, as well as a pyramid-spired octagonal tower, whose shape is echoed by two lanters flanking the portal.   
41.64881-0.882826 Basílica of Santa Engracia.   
Moorish remains[edit]
41.6565-0.897087 Palacio de la Aljaferia (Bus 32, 34 or 36 from the city centre.). Check website as opening hours vary during the year.. A Moorish castle with intricate decorations including ceilings of gold. The castle now houses the Aragon regional parliament. €5 or free with Tourist Card.

41.64987-0.8875819 Puerta del Carmen (Carmen Gate). A surviving example of what once were 12 entry gates to the walled city of Zaragoza. The gate looks ancient, but was actually built in 1789 in neoclassical style, hence its resemblance to Roman ruins. The gate's dishevelled appearance documents its role in several sieges of the city and this is why the gate was not restored to its original glory - although minor repairs were carried out in 1997, when a bus collided with it   (updated Aug 2016)
41.65725-0.8753120 Puente de Piedra (Stone Bridge).

Sleep[edit]
Accommodation is a reason to visit Zaragoza in itself - if you plan to visit both Madrid and Barcelona taking advantage of the fast train connection, you can choose to stay here, halfway between them. Not only will you pay less for the combined train tickets to Zaragoza from either city than from the entire Madrid-Barcelona AVE ride, but you will also benefit from the much lower rates hotels charge in Zaragoza. And all the attractions of Zaragoza are an added bonus on top of it!

The Water Tower and Palacio de Congresos seen from the southern end of the pedestrian bridge on the Expo grounds connecting the two
41.64913-0.920484 B&B Hotel Zaragoza Los Enlaces Estación, Pilar Miro, 1 (Bus 501 to Aeropuerto from the Delicias station, alight at Via Hispanidad (303), walk 450 m down the road). Convenient if you plan to use Zaragoza as a stopover on your Madrid-Barcelona train ride, as it is only 5 minutes by bus from the Delicias station (or half an hour by foot, if you feel like walking 2 km. Great value for an AC property, even if a bit older and quite away from the city centre (30 mins by bus). €42.

41.6566-0.915076 Eurostars Plaza Delicias.

(updated Aug 2016)
41.6516-0.98227 Eurostars Rey Fernando. On the outskirts of the Platforma Logistica commercial / industrial park, the hotel overlooks a park but one needs a car to comfortably get between the hotel and the city of Zaragoza proper. €43. (updated Aug 2016)
41.65958-0.912228 Eurostars Zaragoza. Confusingly named, it is distinct from the other Eurostars hotels in Zaragoza and is at the Delicias train station although the name would not suggest so.

41.65861-0.8742711 B&B Hotel Zaragoza Centro, Calle de Sobrarbe 2.
