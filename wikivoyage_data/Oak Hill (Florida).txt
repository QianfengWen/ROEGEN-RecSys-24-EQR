Understand[edit]
Map of Oak Hill (Florida)
Oak Hill marks the final settlement, going south, before the Canaveral region. The various waterways and landmasses of the Canaveral Seashore are preserved land as Canaveral National Seashore and Kennedy Space Center/Cape Canaveral.
The town is semi-rural, except for a short section along the Intracoastal Waterway, which diverts from US-1. This section includes some nice views of the waterway, a restaurant, and nearby historic site.

Get in[edit]
The main road through Oak Hill is US-1. This highway, which goes north-south between New Smyrna Beach, Edgewater, Mims, and Titusville, passes through western Oak Hill and provides a road junction with River Rd, which goes east to the shoreline of the lagoon and forms a semi-circular loop.

Get around[edit]
The River Rd and associated roads provide a semi-circular road in "downtown" Oak Hill leading to the Seminole Rest and the community portion of Oak Hill, most of which is away from US-1.
