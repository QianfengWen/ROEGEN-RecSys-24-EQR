Guasave is a mid-size city of 320,000 (2020) in the Mexican state of Sinaloa. It offers limited sightseeing spots but the nearby bays and beaches of the upper Gulf of California provide abundant spots for aquatic sports and nature watching. The city is useful for a traveler because it has one of the largest bus stations in the regions with connections throughout northwest Mexico, along with hotels and restaurants.
