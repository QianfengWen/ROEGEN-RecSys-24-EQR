Tantramar is a small border town southeastern New Brunswick. Named after the nearby Tantramar Marshes around the Bay of Funday, Tantramar was formed via the amalgamation of the town of Sackville, village of Dorchester, and the surrounding rural areas.


Understand[edit]
Sackville Waterfowl Park
Tantramar, while considered a town, is a rural area that comprises a collection of unorganized hamlets located near the New Brunswick-Nova Scotia border. The main communities area:

45.9-64.36671 Sackville  – located on the saltwater Tantramar Marshes, it is home to Mount Allison University (a liberal arts university) and the main service centre.
45.9016-64.51612 Dorchester  – located on the eastern side of the mouth of the lush Memramcook River valley near the river's discharge point into Shepody Bay (15 km W of Sackville). A former shire town that contains has several fine historic homes and civic buildings.
45.871-64.27893 Aulac  – a tiny hamlet directly on the Nova Scotia border (10 km E of Sackville). Aulac occupied a strategic location in the final days of francophone Acadia; peninsular Nova Scotia was under English control after 1710; New Brunswick remained Acadian until le grand dérangement - the forced Acadian exile of 1755. This made tiny Aulac the front line. Fort Beauséjour, a French fortress, was built in 1751 to counter the British Fort Lawrence directly across the border in Nova Scotia.

Tantramar is situated on the saltwater Tantramar Marshes around the Bay of Funday and is anchored by the former town of Sackville, home to Mount Allison University. The former village of Dorchester, located 15 km west of Sackville, has several fine historic homes and civic buildings.
Historically, the area was populated by the Mi’kmaq First Nation Indigenous people). The French-speaking Acadian population settled in the area around 1670. Aulac (on the Nova Scotia border and within Tantramar town limits) is home to Fort Beauséjour, a French fortification defeated by the British in 1755.
Radio-Canada International, the country's former shortwave broadcaster, used Sackville as its transmitter site until it left the air in 2012; the saltwater marshes made an effective reflector at radio frequencies.
