The city beach
Sandpoint is a popular city and tourist destination in Northern Idaho on the shore of lake Pend Oreille (Pond-Orr-Ay) in the northwestern United States. Although Idaho is generally recognized as a Mountain State, Sandpoint and other far northern Idaho cities are most often categorized as officially being part of the Pacific Northwest. The population of Sandpoint was about 8,700 in 2018. The closest city of more than 100,000 people is Spokane, Washington, 78 miles away.


Understand[edit]

Sandpoint is a region in transition. From humble timber and fishing beginnings, Sandpoint has been rocketed to among the top destinations in Idaho. It was number one on USA Today's List of Unforgettable Summer Vacations, as well as Sunset Magazine's top small Western Town, along with numerous other distinctions.
The small communities lining highways 2, 95 & 200 in east Bonner County
are generally referred to Sandpoint, the largest of these being the actual Sandpoint. Excluding Sandpoint, they are the following:

Careywood 18 miles south of Sandpoint, Hwy 95.
Cocallala 12 miles south of Sandpoint, Hwy 95.
Westmond 10 miles south of Sandpoint, Hwy 95.
Dufort 8 miles south of Sandpoint, Hwy 95.
Algoma 6 miles south of Sandpoint, Hwy 95
Sagle 5 miles south of Sandpoint, Hwy 95
Ponderay 3 miles north of Sandpoint, sandwiched between Hwy 95/2 and Hwy 200.
Kootenai 4 miles north of Sandpoint, Hwy 200.
Sunnyside 6 miles east of Sandpoint, Hwy 200
Oden Bay 8 miles east of Sandpoint, Hwy 200.
Trestle Creek 14 miles east of Sandpoint, Hwy 200.
Hope 16 miles east of Sandpoint, Hwy 200.
East Hope 17 miles east of Sandpoint, Hwy 200
Beyond Hope 21 miles east of Sandpoint, Hwy 200
Dover 3 miles west of Sandpoint, Hwy 2.
Wrencoe 9 miles west of Sandpoint, Hwy 2
LaClede 14 miles west of Sandpoint, Hwy 2.
The time zone is Pacific (UTC-8), and the area code is 208.
The official currency is United States dollars, but most stores and restaurants will accept Canadian currency due to Sandpoint's proximity to the Canadian border and the large number of Canadian tourists who visit the region.

Climate[edit]
Located just north of the 48th parallel, Sandpoint's climate is unique in the region. Although found not far from the deserts of Eastern Washington, Northern Idaho is on the rainy side of the next mountain chain - the Rocky Mountains. Many climate maps show Sandpoint as arid or semi-arid but this is not accurate. With long, usually cold winters (average temperatures are generally below freezing, and dip to -20°F for a week or two in February) and short, hot summers, (80-90°F is the average, but be prepared for up to 100°F for short periods) Sandpoint resembles a hemiboreal or even boreal climate, similar to the southern interior of Alaska (Fairbanks and the like, with milder winters).
Winter lasts from late November to March, whereas summer weather doesn't hit until July and peaks in August. Spring (April–June) and autumn (September-early November) are generally rainy and cool.
Storms are common - thunderstorms are the norm for hot summer afternoons and windstorms strike the most in spring.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Sandpoint's airport is only served by charter planes.  Getting in and out is complex and expensive.
Spokane International Airport (GEG) is about 2 hours southwest of Sandpoint, it is a hub for Horizon Air, Delta Air Lines, Frontier, and Big Sky Air, and airlines like United and Southwest also fly there. Most flights bound for GEG leave from Seattle/Portland, so be prepared to fly to Seattle or Portland even if you are heading east. You can get a flight directly from Minneapolis, but expect to pay more.

By car[edit]
From Seattle/Portland Driving east from the west coast, you have two options. I-90 eastbound is the fastest, but it is mostly barren steppe and scrubland. In Coeur d'Alene, take Hwy 95  north to Sandpoint. The scenic alternative to I-90 is Hwy 2- which winds through northern Washington and drops you off right in Sandpoint. It is slightly longer, though.
From Boise Take Highway 55 or 95 north through the state. Though it is two-lane most of its length, it is the shortest route, and takes about the same or slightly less than the alternative through eastern Oregon and Washington.
From the East I-90 westbound is your best bet. Same drill- take 95 at Coeur d'Alene. For an alternative, Hwy 200 winds through northernwestern Montana, following the Clark Fork River gorge.

Eat[edit]
For a small town in a relatively remote region, Sandpoint contains a disproportionate number (60 but not all are listed here) of restaurants of all sorts, likely because of its strong tourist economy. In addition to locally owned restaurants listed below, Sandpoint hosts several fast food chains.
Sandpoint holds two food festivals annually- A Taste of Sandpoint in February (part of the Winter Carnival) and Sandpoint Summer Sampler in late June. Both feature many local restaurants in a fun and artsy setting. Foster's Crossing Antiques holds a fudge contest during the Winter Carnival, and for a small fee anyone can test then judge entries.
Every town has a specialty, and Sandpoint's is huckleberries. From huckleberry pie to huckleberry syrup to huckleberry daiquiris, you can find just about everything in huckleberry come summer. Local stores often carry some of the prepackaged stuff, like huckleberry candy bars, and restaurants usually serve some sort of huckleberry dessert. Huckleberry Ice Cream in particular seems to be the local favorite.
All of Sandpoint's restaurants are casual, that is to say none of them have dress requirements. Even the most expensive restaurants will let you in wearing ripped jeans, but you may get some looks. That being said, you will probably also see many others dressed as you are!

Go next[edit]
After all, there's way more to the region than just Sandpoint! In fact, Sandpoint makes a great hub from which to visit smaller (or sometimes larger) communities. Here are some places to start...

Hwy 95 Northbound[edit]
Bonners Ferry Slightly smaller than Sandpoint, Bonners Ferry is a short drive from the Canadian border. It has a cute downtown full of shops and also the Kootenai Wildlife Refuge, where you can hike numerous trails or take a driving tour.
Porthill/Rickerts About the only thing interesting about these communities is that they lie exactly on the border and house the US/Canada customs. Unlike many more urban customs offices, waits are not usually long, but remember to bring birth certificates for all minors and identification for all adults, plus passports all around.
Cranbrook, BC Cranbrook is a fun little town not far from the border, whose main attraction is Fort Steele. Fort Steele is a famous re-enactment/museum of pioneer life, complete with exhibits and tradespeople such as tin and blacksmiths, excellent views of Cranbrook, and many exhibits. A must see for all passerby.
Hwy 95 Southbound[edit]
Hwy 200 Eastbound[edit]
Hwy 2 Westbound[edit]
Priest River/Lake Past LaClede is the small timber town of Priest River. Priest River is home to a cute downtown, Albeni Falls Dam (which supplies the region's power) and plenty of wilderness ripe for discovering. Head north from Priest River, and you will find Priest Lake, a tiny resort town in the middle of nowhere.
Newport, WA Just over the Washington border lies Newport, also on the Pend Oreille river. Newport has lots of shops and a classically themed movie theater.
Beyond If you stay on 2, you will eventually end up in Sedro-Woolly and Burlington at the junction of Hwy 2 and I-5. Along the way you will pass through such famous destinations as Winthrop and Republic, all within a days drive of Sandpoint... or Seattle.
