Puri Saren Agung (Water Palace) in central Ubud
Ubud, a town in central Bali of around 75,000 people (2020), is far removed from the nightlife bikini scene in Kuta, and is regarded as the cultural centre of Bali. It is famous as an arts and crafts hub, and much of the town and nearby villages seems to consist of artists' workshops and galleries. There are some remarkable architectural and other sights to be found, and a general feeling of well being to be enjoyed, all thanks to the spirit, surroundings, and climate of the place.


Understand[edit]
While Ubud seems to outsiders like one small town, it is in fact fourteen villages, each run by its own banjar (village committee). Ubud has grown rapidly, and some central parts are creaking under the strain of coping with the number of visitors.  That said, most development is sympathetic to the zeitgeist, if not designed specifically in the local style. Growth continues apace, but there are still terraced rice fields along the rivers, and away from the town centre, regular, quiet village life carries on relatively undisturbed.

History[edit]
In many ways, the history of the Ubud area (not so much the modern day town) is the very history of Bali itself.
Ubud has a known history back to the eighth century, when the Javanese Buddhist priest Rsi Marhandya came to Bali from Java, and meditated at the confluence of the two Wos rivers at Campuan, just west of the modern day town centre. A shrine was established and later expanded by Nirartha, the Javanese priest who is regarded as the founder of Bali's religious practices and rituals as we know them today. At this time the area was a centre of natural medicine and healing, and that is how the name Ubud originated: Ubad is ancient Balinese for medicine.
Further temples and monasteries were established over the next 400 years or so. The temple complex at Gunung Kawi, and the cave temples at Goa Gajah (just east and northeast of Ubud), are architectural remains from this period. Many of the dances, drama and rituals still practised in Ubud today, originated at this time. King Airlangga ruled all of Java and Bali in this era, and his seat of government was located in what is now the village of Batuan, just southeast of Ubud.
The Javanese Majapahit kingdom conquered Bali in 1343, and the key final victory was against the Pejeng Dynasty centred at Bedulu, just to the east of Ubud. A great flowering of Balinese culture followed, and the ancestry of Ubud's current day aristocratic families can be traced back to this period. In the sixteenth Century, there was a total transplantation of the Majapahit Kingdom to Bali as the Islamisation of Java forced them eastwards. Power flip-flopped between various dynasties and feudal lords, but the Ubud area remained a very important cog in the various regencies which ruled the island.

Goa Gajah originates from the 9th century
In 1900, Ubud became a Dutch protectorate at its own request, and the colonialists interfered little, allowing the traditional arts and culture of the area to remain relatively unchanged. The modern era of Ubud perhaps began in the 1930s, when foreign artists were encouraged by the royal family to take up presence in the town. From their Ubud base, the likes of Walter Spies and Rudolph Bonnet were instrumental in promoting an understanding of Balinese art and culture worldwide. From the 1960s onwards, travellers started to arrive in earnest, mostly intrepid types as the infrastructure was still very limited indeed. Since then, Ubud has developed rapidly into a high-profile, top-class international destination, whilst still maintaining its integrity as the centre of Balinese art and culture.

Orientation[edit]
Orienting yourself in Ubud is fairly straightforward.  The town sprawls for several kilometres in all directions, with all of the small villages within a five km radius of the central market being loosely referred to as "Ubud". If you choose a reasonably central place to stay, it is easy enough to get around on foot.
Central Ubud has three main streets: Jl Raya Ubud, Jl Monkey Forest and Jl Hanoman.  At the intersection of Jl Raya and Jl Monkey Forest are Ubud Market, Ubud Palace, and the main bemo stop — unsurprisingly, there's also a near-permanent traffic jam here.
Jl Monkey Forest, which runs south through town to the Monkey Forest, is a built-up area, and home to a wide array of accommodation, art galleries, and cafes, as well a number of local services such as schools, a sports field, pharmacies, and travel agents. Jl Hanoman, which runs parallel to Jl Monkey Forest just to the east, is a bit quieter and makes for more pleasant walking.
To the immediate west and northwest are the villages of Campuan (Tjampuhan, Campuhan) and Kedewatan, home to some of the most upmarket hotels in the whole of Asia, with views over valleys sculpted by the Ayung and Wos rivers.
Directly to the south, past the Monkey Forest and still within a twenty minute walk of the central market, is Padang Tegal which then runs into the southern villages of Nyuh Kuning and Pengosekan, about three km from central Ubud.  Directly to the east is the village of Peliatan, and then Teges and Bedulu, home of the ninth century Goa Gajah (Elephant Cave).

Due to its elevation at about 200 m above sea level, Ubud enjoys cooler temperatures than the coast, and it is sometimes necessary to bring a pullover for the evening. The midday sun can still be scorching though and the humidity often relentless; a murderous combination for an outing of 'temple tramping' which, in hilly Ubud, usually requires climbing up and down staircases.  (Head out early to beat the heat and the crowds.)  If there is a time to avoid, it would be the depths of the wet season in January and February — when it rains in Ubud, it really rains.

Tourism information office[edit]
 Bina Wisata, Jl Raya Ubud (just west of Ubud Market), ☏ +62 361 973285. Not especially helpful, but they always have a few leaflets, and local businesses advertise current events there. 
Get in[edit]
By bemo[edit]
There are regular public bemos from Denpasar's Batubulan terminal to Ubud which cost Rp50,000 and take about an hour. Most bemos run in the early morning, and in the later of the day it is getting difficult to find a bemo leaving and drivers try to pursue tourist to hire entire vehicle for Rp200,000-300,000, and you will not find any after 16:00. In the opposite direction, bemos depart every morning from the central market (northern entrance) in Ubud.

By taxi or car[edit]
If you want to take a taxi to Ubud from South Bali, it is best to charter the vehicle for a return trip, otherwise, you'll be hit with a 30% fee for going out-of-town.  Metered fares, one-way and not including surcharge, are around Rp150,000 from Denpasar and Rp200,000 from Kuta. You can also rent a car in Kuta for a day in some local rental company around US$15-25, will be also useful to explore the extended vicinity.

By bus[edit]
Perama offers transfers to Ubud from Sanur, Lovina, Kuta, Bedugul, Candidasa, and Padang Bai, some daily, some on-demand. When coming from Ngurah Rai International Airport you need to take a taxi to Perama's Kuta branch first, when going to the airport direct transfers exist. These are convenient and inexpensive; e.g. four times per day to the airport for Rp50,000. Rather less conveniently, the Perama terminal is not located in the centre of Ubud, but about two km south in Padang Tegal, on Jl Hanoman just south of the intersection with Jl Monkey Forest. From Kuta to Ubud cost Rp60,000.
You can go to the "official Tourist Information" (just in the middle of town, on the big crossroad, opposite the market at Monkey Forest Road/Jalan Raya Road) and buy your ticket there (official outlet, same price) and Perama will pick you up there, to transfer to the Perama Bus Hub out of Town.

By public bus[edit]
Trans Metro Dewata (Rp 4,400, May 2024): the corridor 04 serves the route Terminal Ubung in Denpasar to Monkey Forest Central Parking with numerous bus stops. About an hour, every 7-10 min. Does not accept cash, either use bank transport card, either  qris qrcode payment.

From Bedugul[edit]
From Bedugul / Candikuning, multiple options starting with cheaper (as of May 2024):

Take bemo from main road (next to lake) to Terminal Ubung in Denpasar (about Rp 40,000, duration ~1 hr 15 min), bus K3B to RS Dharma Yadnya Selatan (Rp 4,400, ~20 min), last bus K4B to Ubud (if centre, Pura Dalem Puri Pelatian stop; Rp 4,400, ~50 min). While cheaper (less than Rp 50,000), it's lot slower (3-4 hours) depending on traffic in Denpasar and Ubud.
Take bemo to Sembung (likely Rp 40,000 too as it seems the minimum price) and car-hailing app motorbike ride after (bike ~Rp 50,000, car rp 100,000-130,000). It is not known if bemo between Sembung and Ubud and likely not cheaper.
Full route by car-hailing app: bike ~Rp 110,00-130,000, car Rp 260,000-320,000
Perama tour bus: Rp 150,000, duration ~1 hr 30 min, daily 14:00, from indomaret, not perama bus shop.
Private car: ~Rp 300,000
Get around[edit]
8°30′16″S 115°16′3″EMap of the Ubud area
Central Ubud can be covered on foot, but you will need some form of transport to explore the extended vicinity.
Central Ubud is overrun with tourists and touts, and traffic is terrible—cars are frequently stuck in traffic, pedestrians have to dodge motorcycles, and everyone has to deal with the noise and smell from so many vehicles in a small area. The nearby villages are much quieter. The sidewalks are often blocked by motorbikes, or a collapsed section necessitates a step off the sidewalk potentially placing you in the path of traffic. That traffic could be a tricycle or a truck, so keep your wits about you.





The EPL Phenomenon
Blame Elizabeth Gilbert. Those of you who managed to make it through the turgid best-selling novel Eat, Pray, Love, might have an inkling of what is coming up. Ubud features quite heavily in our heroine's search for fulfilment, and the knock-on effect in the town has been huge. Acolytes have swarmed to Ubud looking for (and sometimes finding) places and people referenced in the book. The actual characters mentioned are surely sick and tired of rather desperate looking thirty-something single women turning up on their doorsteps. The economic benefits of the novel to the area ratcheted up a whole other notch in mid-2009, when the eponymously named movie was shot in and around Ubud, Julia Roberts and all. Just be aware though that Ubud cannot necessarily guarantee a remedy for every mid-life crisis.


By bemo[edit]
Bemos ply the main routes in and around Ubud, and the main stop and gathering point is Ubud market at the junction of Jl Monkey Forest and Jl Raya Ubud. Most bemos stop running in the late afternoon, and are always more frequent in the morning.

By taxi[edit]
No metered taxis operate in Ubud, and any you see will be dropping off passengers from further afield.
You may however encounter many locals offering a taxi, who sometimes are very persistent. These are not actual taxis, but "local cars" (see below).
If you do not need a taxi, it's best to avoid eye contact with those offering a ride, as they may follow you with offers of tours of the area, etc. If you are continually being harassed, a polite "no thank you" (or "tidak terima kasih", the Indonesian equivalent) may work.

By local car[edit]
Most local transport comes in the form of SUVs or minivans that can be hired with a driver for specific trips. Look for the circular yellow "E" logo on the windshield certifying them as Ubud Transport Association members. You can (and should) haggle a bit over the price, and pay less than for the equivalent journey in a metered taxi. A short trip should be less than Rp20,000, and drivers will be glad to wait for you for a return fare.
Also, there are guys on motorbikes who will also offer bike rides (ojek) and are about half the price of those in a car.

By hotel car[edit]
Many hotels are out of town, and are happy to offer regular, complimentary drop-off and pick-up services to central Ubud.  Expect to pay higher than taxi prices if you are intending to go further afield.

By motorbike[edit]
As elsewhere in Bali, motorbike rental is widely available, and you will not be short of options. Expect to pay between Rp40,000 and 80,000 per day for a late model motorbike in good condition. Look for rental agencies on all the main streets, or ask your hotel to organise for you.  Navigation can be confusing, as signage is limited and all the roads look pretty much the same at first, but take it easy and stop to ask for directions if (when) you get lost.

By bicycle[edit]
You can rent bicycles for about Rp20,000-30,000 per day. There is a large selection available at the corner of the football field on Jl Monkey Forest.  Beware though: Ubud is very hilly, so cycling can be hard, sweaty work.  Traffic on the main roads is heavy and drivers rarely pay heed to cyclists.

By ride hailing app[edit]
There are lots of signs in Ubud saying taxi apps (like Grab, Blue Bird, and Gojek) are prohibited. You may or may not have success calling one anyway if you try.

See[edit]
Ubud is so crammed with attractions it can almost seem like a visual assault at times. Try to make sure you allocate at least a week for your visit here, and take your time to explore properly. Visitors who jump up to Ubud for just two or three days of their Bali holiday, stand little chance of understanding much of what is going on around them.
The key historical sites are located out of town, some as far as 20 km away, and you might find it worthwhile joining a tour to visit these. If you do visit attractions such as Goa Gajah, Gunung Kawi, Pura Kehen and Tirta Empul under your own steam, try to find a knowledgeable guide when you get there. Whilst you will certainly appreciate the beauty of these places, their cultural and spiritual significance may be lost without a guide.

Temples and historical sites[edit]
-8.523389115.2863331 Goa Gajah (Elephant Cave), Jalan Goa Gajah (about an hour walk from Ubud palace with partly unfriendly-pedestrian roads). Daily 08:00-17:00. The centerpiece here is a cave dating back to the 9th century, the entrance to which is an ornately carved demon's mouth. Inside are some fragmentary lingam and yoni statues, as well as a statue of Ganesha. Large, carved guards stand around pools near the entrance, and a little path leads to a waterfall, rice fields, and some Buddhist stupa fragments. Some parts of the Goa Gajah complex were not excavated until the 1950s. Nominated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 30-60 min visit without guide. Unclear if dirt path to rice fields and elephant river is usable/maintained. Adults Rp 50.000, Kids Rp 25.000 including sarong.   (updated May 2024)
Gunung Kawi, Tampaksiring
-8.423361115.3123332 Gunung Kawi (Poet Mountain), Tampaksiring (18 km northeast from Ubud). Daily 07:00-17:00. Dating from the eleventh century, this is presumed to be the burial complex of King Anak Wungsu and his many wives. Reached by climbing down 371 steps, the location at the bottom of a steep valley lined with paddy fields, is quite stunning. The smaller complex on the south side of the river is presumed to have been built for the King's wives, while the larger complex is thought to have been the residence of the King himself, and perhaps his concubines. The structures are carved into the sides of a steep river valley, and the river crossed by twisting trees and vines. You must take off your shoes before entering into the central pura complex. About 1 km downstream there are further tomb cloisters. On the way back up, take a break at Cafe Kawi which has cold drinks for Rp10,000 and up. If you haggle for a taxi from Ubud, it should cost no more than Rp150,000 to get there and back, with the driver waiting for you while you make the visit. Sarong is included in the entry and free, so you can ignore the ladies in the parking lot trying to sell you one adult Rp30,000, child Rp 15,000 including sarong and sash rental.   (updated May 2024)
-8.441827115.3599023 Pura Kehen (Kehen Temple), Jl Sriwijaya, Bangli (just north of Bangli town centre, which itself is about 30 minutes north east from Ubud). Daily 09:00-17:00. One of the most attractive temples in the whole of Bali, and as it is slightly off the beaten path, one which receives relatively few visitors. The temple was founded in 1206, and has an especially impressive 11-tiered meru in the inner courtyard. When you visit here take a little extra time to look around Bangli. It is a quiet and attractive market town. Rp20,000.   (updated Sep 2022)
-8.50673115.2626224 Puri Saren Agung (Royal Palace, Water Palace, Ubud Palace) (across Jl Raya Ubud from Ubud Market). Daily 09:00-17:00. This was the palace of the kings of Ubud until the 1940s, and some royal descendants live there to this day. Parts of the complex are off limits to the public, but entry to the rest is free, and this is Ubud's best setting for dance performances (see Do). 10-15 min visit without a guide. Free.   (updated May 2024)
Hot springs at Tirta Empul, Tampaksiring
-8.41639115.3155 Tirta Empul, Tampaksiring (follow Jl Raya Tegallalang north for 8 km then slight right through the countryside for 7 km). Daily 08:00-18:00. One of the holiest temples in Bali built around hot springs that still bubble in the central courtyard. The Balinese come here to bathe and purify themselves physically and spiritually, and during Galungan, the sacred barong masks are bathed here. The complex dates to 960, but the present buildings are largely modern reconstructions. Rp15,000, including sarong and sash rental.   
-8.530064115.2931286 Yeh Pulu, Banjar Batulumbang, Bedulu nr Gianyar (turn off the Ubud to Gianyar main road about 400 metres east of the entrance to the Goa Gajah complex. Drive through Banjar Batulumbang until the road comes to an end. From here walk down the track). Daily 07:00-18:00. This complex of rock carvings is close to Goa Gajah but far less well known. The carvings date from the fourteenth or fifteenth century, and are set in a very attractive rice field. You can reach Yeh Pulu on foot through the rice fields from Goa Gajah, but you will definitely need a guide for the 45-minute walk as there is no path to speak of. In addition to the carvings, there is a holy well here, and the attendant priest will be happy to bless you with the well water. Temple dress code applies. This is a much underrated and under-visited site, and is highly recommended. Rp15,000. 
-8.482108115.267777 Chapel of Mother Goddess, Rajarajeshwari Tripurasundari, Jl. Sri Wedari Km 3 (3 km north from the main Ubud street), ☏ +62 818 701658, ubud@anandashram.asia. A modern chapel dedicated to the feminine aspect of the divine, such as Kuan Shih Yin, Mary Magdalene, Mother Mary, Lakshmi, Durga, Kali, Saraswati, Gayatri and others. Free, but donations are accepted.

Before he passed away in 1999, Spanish artist Antonio Blanco was an absolute fixture on the Ubud art scene. His former home is now a museum showcasing his sometimes bizarre but always interesting work. Think Salvador Dali transplanted to Asia. In the garden you can take pictures of the exotic birds flying around. Rp 80,000.

When it opened in 1954, this was the first private museum in Bali. Three buildings showcase traditional and modern Balinese art.

-8.529639115.27127811 Museum Rudana, Jl Cok Rai Pudak 44 (on the road to Mas, about a 10 min drive south of Ubud town centre), ☏ +62 361 975779, rudana@senatorrudana.com.

Landscape[edit]
Rice terraces near Ubud
The area around Ubud is characterised by gently rolling rice paddies, and these create an impression of greenness which can be quite startlingly beautiful. This is especially true to the south and southeast of the town. Any visitor approaching from the south will appreciate this and it is worth a stop just to absorb the gentle beauty of it all.
Far more off the beaten path is to explore the rice fields immediately north of town. A good route is to take Jl Raya eastwards from the town centre and turn north up the small road immediately adjacent to the BCA Bank building. Proceed up this road through the village of Kutuh and just keep going, turning where you feel like it. This is a very gentle, rural area with some lovely landscape. A great way to explore is by bicycle as there are no steep hills to negotiate here.

Typical Ubud river valley scenery
On the opposite side of town in the Campuhaun, Sanggingan, and Kedewatan areas, the landscape changes dramatically as great gorges have been carved out of the limestone land base by the Ayung and Wos rivers. It's no surprise that so many five star hotels have made their home in these lush, dramatic valleys. Opportunities for viewing these gorges are many. You can just find your own way and explore by motorbike (it is very hard work by bicycle as the hills are steep). Head west out of town over the Campuhan Bridge and just start exploring. The main road here is Jl Raya Sanggingan, and if you continue heading away from town you will reach the junction with Jl Raya Kedewatan. From that point you can turn in either direction and just keep exploring. Alternatively, you can stop into a hotel or restaurant, have a drink or lunch, and gaze out in very civilised surroundings. If your pockets are deep, the restaurant at the Four Seasons in Sayan probably has the best views of all of the Ayung Gorge. A more budget conscious option is the lovely Indus restaurant in Sanginngan, with tables facing out to the Wos River.

-8.447663115.2772114 Tegallalang. Northeast of Ubud, the land starts to become more undulating, and this is a good place to view Bali's classic rice terraces. This village is somewhat a tourist trap, but it is worth braving the hordes of trinket peddlers to view the stunning terraces. From the town center, take Jl Raya as far east as you can go, and then turn north and continue about nine km until you reach Tegallalang. Look for the picture postcard rice terraces on you right-hand side. For those moving on north to the Kintamani area, this is on route and makes for an easy stop. 
Others[edit]
Conservation of critically endangered endemic Bali myna at Bali Bird Park.
The monkeys at the Monkey Forest are not afraid of humans.
-8.599985115.25186115 Bali Bird Park, Jl Serma Cok Ngurah Gambir, Singapadu, ☏ +62 361 299352, sales@bali-bird-park.com. Daily 09:30-17:30. A splendid 2-hectare aviary park with more than 250 species of birds in well thought out, attractive enclosures. The park has an enlightened, modern attitude to exhibiting animals, and this is obvious from the very open, walk-in aviaries, and the number of free range birds throughout the park. Also has a notably good cafe. One of Bali's best formal attractions. Adults US$26, children US$13. 
-8.497753115.26302516 Botanic Garden, Kutuh Kaja (on the road to Kutuh Kaja village which runs north from Jl Raya Ubud close to BCA Bank). Daily 08:00-18:00. The Botanic Garden is a wonderful way to spend a few hours walking around and exploring the valley that it fills. It is best to go in the morning and avoid the afternoon heat. Rp 50,000. 
-8.518735115.25858617 Monkey Forest, Jl Monkey Forest, ☏ +62 361 971304, info@monkeyforestubud.com. Daily 08:30–18:00. A sacred forest full of monkeys, which are not at all afraid of people and will happily come quite close to you and maybe even climb on your shoulders or head if you're not careful! They love to look in backpacks for things to steal and often take people's sunglasses or wallets. Don't bring any food or you will risk bites and a need for rabies injections. If you are bitten, visit the first aid clinic near the entrance at the bottom of Jalan Monkey Forest. Stroll through to find Pura Dalem Agung Padangtegal, a temple of the dead. A visit to the very informative website beforehand is highly recommended. Entrance Rp80,000 for adults (Oct 2019), Rp60,000 for children (12 and under).  
-8.491582115.27459418 The White Herons of Petulu, Petulu. Every evening between 15,000 and 20,000 cattle egrets, known colloquially as white herons and in Balinese, kokokan, roost in the village of Petulu just ten minutes north of Ubud. It is quite a spectacle as these large, elegant white and rusty orange birds arrive in countless groups and tussle for the prime roosting spots. Each morning at dawn they leave en-masse to find feeding spots around the island. Some also breed in the area and nests can be seen in the roadside trees. The cattle egrets are joined by smaller numbers of little egrets and Javan pond herons.According to local legend, the egrets first appeared here in such large numbers after one of the worst massacres of suspected communists during the troubles of 1965. This led local villagers to believe that these birds are the souls of the slaughtered, and ceremonies to that effect are still held today.The village of Petulu is reached by heading east from Ubud town centre on Jl Raya Ubud until you meet the obvious junction with Jl Raya Andong. Turn left, and go up the hill for about 2 km until you see the sign posted left turning on Jalan Kintamani to Petulu village. Go into the village and you will see signs and warungs set up in the best places to view the spectacle. Get there by 17:30. Rp15,000 per adult. 
Do[edit]
As a centre of the arts, Ubud has dance and shadow puppet performances every night. There are also plenty of spas for resynchronising your chakras, and all manner of spiritual classes and treatments, some distinctly less genuine than others.

Whitewater rafting and other outdoor activities[edit]
There is good rafting available on the Ayung River at Sayan, just west of Ubud. Almost as good as the rafting itself is the wonderful experience of being right down inside the Ayung gorge. This is the domain of high-end resorts like the Four Seasons and Amandari, and it is a very scenic area indeed. The rapids are Class II and Class III, and best during the rainy season as the river can run a bit dry from June to September. There are two well established operators, both with offices on the main road in Sayan, close to Amandari, however other operators have sprung up.

Buy[edit]
Inside Ubud Market
Ubud has a vast assortment of art and jewelry shops. Head for the boutique type stores on Jl Monkey Forest and Jl Raya Ubud for higher quality goods (with appropriately higher prices), or down to the market for bulk-produced cheapies.

-8.507755115.2630071 Ubud Market (at the corner of Jl Monkey Forest and Jl Raya Ubud). This is a double storey warren of stalls bursting at the seams with wood carvings, batik shirts, sarongs, and all manner of other souvenirs aimed specifically at tourists. The merchants here haggle with tourists for a living, and think nothing of asking for ten times the going price, so try to establish a baseline before you go in to buy. Most of the merchants downstairs will lose interest if you try to get a reasonable price. It is better to try the shops upstairs where you will find the same products often for sale at lower prices. You will still need to use your best bargaining skills of course. Try to avoid the period from 11:00-14:00 when tour buses from further afield tend to arrive en-masse. If hiring a car for a day, it might be worth it to make a stop in Tegallalang, where they are geared more towards wholesale buyers. The Sukawati Market is crowded and sells trinkets in bulk as well, but quality is dubious. 
Craft villages between Ubud and Sanur[edit]
The 25-km road to Ubud from Sanur in the south passes through a series of small towns and villages which specialize in the production of particular arts and crafts. The towns are Batubulan/Singakerta for stone carvings, Celuk for silver jewellery, Batuan for paintings, and Mas for wood carvings. The whole area is sometimes referred to as the "craft villages" of Bali, although it is all a bit more built-up and congested than one might infer from the term "village."
This is the best area to see and buy a wide variety of Balinese craftwork in a short period of time. There are many large showrooms where arts and crafts in the Balinese style are offered for sale. Nearly all organised day-tours of central Bali stop at one or more of these showrooms (and the tour operators usually have a financial tie-up with the places where they stop, collecting a commission on purchases.) Be careful, many of these shops specialise in pricing based on huge commissions to the drivers and tour busses.

Other shops and markets[edit]
-8.509383115.266812 Ganesha Bookstore, Jl Raya, info@ganeshabooksbali.com. Daily 09:00-18:00. Second hand bookstore. Also has great range of new books about Bali and Indonesia. Been around since 1986 and now has a second branch in Seminyak.

This privately run community library often has decent fiction and other books for sale. By buying here you are supporting their mission to make free books available to Balinese schoolkids. When you visit, check to see if they have any cultural performances coming up. Also has a small cafe serving home-made snacks. 
-8.5965115.28264 Sukawati Art Market (Pasar Sukawati), Sukawati (about twenty minutes south of Ubud on the main road to Sanur). This huge market is like a one-stop centre for all the craft villages between Sanur and Ubud. Many souvenir shop owners from around Bali wholesale purchase their items here, and prices are considerably lower than in the tourist centers like Kuta, Sanur, and Ubud town centre. For a taste of everyday, go to the food and produce market opposite the art market. 
-8.5036115.26275 Threads of Life, Jl Kajeng 24, ☏ +62 361 972187, tac@threadsoflife.com. Daily 10:00-19:00. A fair trade store that stocks commercially made, traditional hand-woven textiles from Bali and all points east in Indonesia. Or better yet, go to the shops that are actually from the villages and outer islands like Timor and Flores, and specialize in traditional weavings. 
Eat[edit]
Ubud is renowned in Bali for its wide range of restaurants, and is probably second only to Seminyak in terms of the quality of the offerings. Travelers on a budget will not be short of options, as there are many simple warungs serving up the standard Indonesian staples.

Budget[edit]
Babi Guling is a very popular dish for Balinese as well as tourists, and you can find it at most traditional markets and at roadside eateries as well.
If you are looking more for the low-budget one-dish meal aka Rp 15,000-25,000, it’s easier to go on Jalan Cok Gede Rai and around (Ayam goreng prambanan, Mr Kebab Martabak, Burger Bangor Express Ubud…). You can occasionally find mobile street food like bakso but it seems less common in centre.

Drink[edit]
Ubud is emphatically not party town: there are a few places for a quiet drink, but the strictly enforced local regulation that all live performances and loud music must end by 22:30 puts a bit of a clamp on the local nightlife. More often than not, visitors have a quiet drink with their evening meal, and call it a night.

Pubs[edit]

Sleep[edit]


This guide uses the following price ranges for a standard double room:


Budget
Under Rp250,000


Mid-range
Rp250,000-1,000,000


Splurge
Over Rp1,000,000

Many visitors prefer to avoid the crowded town centre and instead stay in nearby rural areas (Penestanan Village pictured).
Ubud has a vast selection of lodging for all budgets. Many visitors prefer to avoid the noisy, congested, and crowded town centre and instead stay out in nearby rural areas, ideally with views of the famous rice terraces, but this can make it a little difficult to get around. As in most of Bali, in all but the grandest of hotels, check-in and check-out times are a bit of a moveable feast. It is safe to assume about 14:00 and 11:00.

Budget[edit]
Ubud has many homestays which are the cheapest form of lodging, a good way to meet the locals, and the natural replacement for hostels on the backpacker circuit. If you want to stay in town, the area around Jl Monkey Forest is generally the most expensive little more expensive (from Rp80,000-100,000 per night). If you want cheaper prices try the areas around Jl Hanoman, north of Jl Raya Ubud and further out in Peliatan. In the low season especially, bargains can be had by those willing to bargain. Jn Kajeng, close to the centre, is a peaceful, mostly pedestrianised street with many small budget to mid-range homestays - those on the west side have views at the rear towards the river, waterfall or nearby rice fields.

Stay safe[edit]
Ubud is a safe town to visit and few problems will ever be encountered.

 Police Station, Jl Raya Andong (just east of the town centre. Follow Jl Raya Ubud east to the end, turn north and the police station is on your right hand side.), ☏ +62 361 975316. 
Be wary around the monkeys that occupy the Monkey Forest. They are experts at stealing possessions like glasses, earrings, cameras and even handbags, and have been known to attack people that are carrying food. Rabies is also a concern in Bali, and the likelihood is that these monkeys could carry the disease. No matter how cute they look, feeding them is just asking for trouble.

Stay healthy[edit]
Dengue fever outbreaks are not uncommon, so be diligent with mosquito repellant.
Ubud does not have a fully fledged hospital and the nearest is about 20 km to the south in Denpasar. There are a number of reasonable clinics, though, which are used to treating typical traveller ailments.

-8.5263115.26551 Toya Medika Clinic, Jl Raya Pengosekan (between Pengosekan gas station and AMRA Museum/Resort), ☏ +62 361 978078, +62 361 7468151, toyomedika@yahoo.com. Four doctors and four nurses as well as two drivers and two ambulances (plus administrative staff). Very highly regarded by visitors and locals alike. Open 24/7; emergency and first responder services available as well as the ability to arrange for evacuation, if necessary. Normal services include checkups, medications, vaccination, lab & radiology services, referral to specialists and hospital admissions in Indonesia and overseas. Able to provide visits to caller’s home or hotel. 
-8.5047115.25552 Ubud Clinic, Jl Raya Campuan 36 (not easily seen from the street, in direction from the centre on the right side behind a corner), ☏ +62 361 974911, info@ubudclinic.co.id. Four resident GPs and blood test station to cover basic infections, tests and stiches. Strong focus on international guest, GPs speak English with varying degree. Blood test lab is open from 08:00-15:00 (standard blood test takes 4-5 hr), very basic dentist services. 24/7 GP onsite and basic emergency service. Pharmacy is connected to the clinic. 300'000 Rupees initial consultation, 150'000 Rupees standard blood test. 
Connect[edit]
Internet[edit]
Most dedicated internet cafes provide computers with fairly low speed access at a low price, Rp6,000 per hour being the current standard. There is only one truly high speed location, Highway on Ubud Main Road, but be prepared to pay a lot more than in other places.
In cafes and restaurants free wifi for customers is increasingly widespread. If you have your own laptop and don't need high speeds that's probably the best way to go, but beware of the hours internet is available can be fewer than the hours a restaurant is open. KAFE for example has excellent and uncommonly fast internet in a great environment but internet is only available from opening until 12:00 and from 15:00-18:00.

 Highway, Jl Raya Ubud, ☏ +62 361 972107. Mostly open 24 hr daily. Rp30,000 per hour. 
 Hubud, Monkey Forest Road 88x, ☏ +62 361978073. Coworking space. (updated Jun 2018)
Post[edit]
There is a refreshingly old-fashioned main post office at the Jl Raya Ubud end of Jl Jembawan. If you are staying in Ubud for any length of time, you can use this as a poste-restante office. Make sure you have your passport with you when you want to collect any mail or parcels.

 Kantor Pos (Post Office), Jl Jembawan. M-Sa 08:00-16:00. 
Telephone[edit]
The area code for Ubud is 0361. +62 361 XXXXXX for international callers.
All of the major Indonesian mobile telephone networks have full coverage of the Ubud area. If you need to make an international landline call, there are many public phone shops (wartels) in the town. As with the rest of Bali, the few public telephones that exist are extremely unlikely to be in working order.

Go next[edit]
Ubud is well located for moving on to other areas of Bali.

If you are heading east, the road to Candidasa and beyond via Klungkung is often busy with trucks, but a nice one hour drive nonetheless.
Bedugul has a traditional fruit market, a splendid botanical garden, and the Ulun Danu Bratan temple, about one hour north by car.
The region around Tabanan has Mount Batukaru and the Batukaru Temple, as well as the rice fields around Jati Luwih, about one hour north by car.
Lovina is an easy-going black-sand beach, about two hours north by car.
