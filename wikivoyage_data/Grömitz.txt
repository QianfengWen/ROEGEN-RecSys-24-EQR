When swimming[edit]
The German Life Saving Association operates lifeguards stations along the beach. Pay attention to flags displayed:

A half-red half-yellow flag indicates a lifeguard station is in use and swimming is allowed.
An additional yellow flag indicates that swimming is not allowed for inexperienced swimmers, children and old people.
A single red flag indicates that swimming is not allowed, for example due to undercurrents, high waves, or water pollution.
In any case, do not swim past the buoys.
