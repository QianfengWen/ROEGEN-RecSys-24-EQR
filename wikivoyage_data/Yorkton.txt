Yorkton Court House (heritage site)
In 1882 a group of businessmen and investors formed the York Farmers Colonization Company. The company founded the settlers' colony on the banks of the Little Whitesand River where lots were given freely to settlers who purchased land from them.  The colony remained at its site until 1889 when the rail line was extended to the Yorkton area.  The colony townsite was relocated alongside the new rail line.
The first settlers to the Yorkton colony were English from Eastern Ontario and Great Britain.  6 mi (9.7 km) west were Scottish settlers at the settlement of Orkney, Saskatchewan. A significant number of residents are also descended from immigrants from Ukraine who came in the early 20th century.
Yotkton is primarily a service centre for the farming industry in the region.
