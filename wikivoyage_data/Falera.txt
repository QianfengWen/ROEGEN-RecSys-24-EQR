Get in[edit]
By public transport[edit]
Falera can be accessed from Chur via Laax. The trip to Laax takes between 40 minutes and 1 hour, depending on whether it is a direct bus or not. There are 1-3 trips an hour depending on the season and the time of the day. The bus goes via Flims. From there the bus to Falera leaves once an hour (more often during the main season) and takes 7 minutes. Alternatively, there is also an hourly bus from Illanz via Laax which takes around 30 minutes. Buses from Chur are timed to allow changing on the bus to Falera in Laax.

By car[edit]
To access Falera by car, look out for the sign towards Falera, when driving through Laax. From there it's a short drive.

Get around[edit]
A shuttle bus operated by the Alpenarena runs around Falera in the winter.  In the summer it is possible to walk about easier as there is no ice. The town itself is car-free, which means that you will have to leave your car at the entrance of the village, unless you have a special permission.

See[edit]
The views of course are the other thing to be seen in Falera. The village sits on a lip of high land overlooking the Surselva with spectacular views both up and down the valley. To the southwest sits the impressive Piz Terri at 3149 meters the highest mountain in the immediate area.

46.7993589.2341551 Church St. Remigius. This ancient church, perched scenically on the hillside, is the pride of Falera. It's ornate interior shows how much the locals care for their church. Nearby the church are some prehistoric megaliths, telling us that this has been a place of worship for many years.  (updated Mar 2017)
