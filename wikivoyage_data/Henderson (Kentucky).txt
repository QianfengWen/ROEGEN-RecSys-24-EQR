Connect[edit]
By phone[edit]
Most telephone numbers in Henderson consist of +1 270 plus a seven-digit number, but the area is now served by an overlay complex of two area codes, with 364 being the second. A local or in-state telephone call now requires all 10 digits of the local number be dialed (omitting just the leading +1 from a local landline call). The same applies on the Indiana side of the river, with that area now being served by 930 in addition to the old 812.
Signage on many established businesses may still display the original seven-digit numbers; dial 270 before these if no area code is indicated (or 812 if in Indiana).
