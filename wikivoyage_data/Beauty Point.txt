Beauty Point is a town of 1231 (2021) in northern Tasmania, on the western banks of the Tamar River.


Get in[edit]
Beauty Point is near the Northern Coast of Tasmania on the west of the Tamar. The main way to access the town is by car via a 40-minute drive north from Launceston via the West Tamar Highway (A7). An alternate route would be going via the East Tamar Highway (A8) and then the Batman Bridge (B73) but that takes a bit longer and requires you to cross the Tamar River, though this route utilises more rural highways than the westerly route that traverses through some towns.

Finding a platypus or echidna is often hard, and while spotting one in the wild is slightly easier in Tasmania than it is on the mainland, this sanctuary houses a few Tasmanian platypuses and echidnas in a bid to increase public awareness about these two one-of-a-kind marsupials.

-41.1498146.82392 Seahorse World (Seahorse World and the Southern Ocean Aquarium), Shed 1A, 200 Flinders St, ☏ +61 3 6383 4111, info@seahorseworld.com.au. Daily 9:30AM–4:30PM. This place firstly has an aquarium-like room where it has tanks with specimens of many different types of seahorses, before moving onto the second room where seahorses are produced on a truly industrial scale, primarily to supply research and home aquariums.  You can see many of them in all stages of development.  Unless you are really into seahorses, you may find the final room with a touch pool, crabs, and many other sea creatures the most interesting.
