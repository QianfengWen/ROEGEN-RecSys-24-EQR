Oka is a village of 4000 people (2011) in Laurentians region of Quebec.  Far from the Laurentian mountains themselves, Oka is a nice daytrip from Montreal due to its lakeside provincial park and waterslide aquapark.


Understand[edit]
Église de l'Annonciation
Oka is a small, old town on the north bank of the Ottawa River where it flows into the Lake of Two Mountains. Oka became internationally known for a 1990 armed standoff between Mohawks on the neighbouring Kanesatake Reserve and the Canadian Army, over a golf course expansion on ancestral land claimed by the Mohawks. Most of the time, it is a peaceful village where Montrealers go for some outdoor recreation in the summer.

History[edit]
This area was first settled by French colonists as a mission to First Nations in 1721 by brothers of the Sulpician Order branch of the Roman Catholic Church. Early native inhabitants were Mohawk (Kanienkaha), Algonquin, and Nipissing, who had a village known as Kanesatake, now a reserve within the boundaries of Oka.
In the 19th century, as a result of the British invasion of then French Canada, there was unrest among the various communities. The Mohawks allied with the British and turned against the French, while the Algonquins had taken the side of the French.

View of Oka
In 1990, the small community gained international attention in what became known as the Oka Crisis. It had approved development of a private golf course, to add nine holes and nearby luxury housing. The Mohawk of Kanesatake opposed this. Several years before the crisis the Mohawks had initiated and lost a land claim court case in which they tried to gain control of what they termed "historic land". Land known from the early mission settlement as the "pine forest". The claim was rejected by the Provincial courts.
The Mohawk of Kanesatake barricaded a dirt road leading to the land. During a 78-day confrontation, the Sûreté du Québec (SQ) police force (and later Canadian army units) confronted members of the Mohawk nation. The latter were joined by other Mohawk and First Nations and Native American tribes. In addition, for several weeks, Mohawk at Kahnawake blockaded the approach to the Mercier Bridge, a route that ran through their land. Negotiations led to the Mohawk re-opening the road. An SQ officer was shot and killed at a period of heightened tensions. Numerous people were arrested. The disputed area was acquired by the Canadian Federal Government and development was stopped.
