Beaver Island is a lightly-inhabited island in northern Lake Michigan, about halfway between the Lower and Upper Peninsulas of the U.S. state of Michigan. It is about 144.56 km². It is about 33.7 km long and 4.8 to 9.7 km wide. It is the largest island in Lake Michigan (湖), and is part of the Beaver Islands. Most of the islands are flat and sandy, with large forest areas. In the old days, the main industries were fishing, logging, and agriculture. However, in modern times, economic activities centered on government service-related activities, tourism, and the construction of houses and villas.

It was home to a unique American monarchy, and is now a popular tourist destination and holiday destination.Iron Ore Bay, with North Fox Island in the distance

Understand[edit]
Beaver Island has a mere 500 homestead residents. The southern half consists largely of the Pigeon River State Forest (35% of the island). The island's population was primarily of Irish descent, and combined with its natural character (swampy bog land), it is called "America's Emerald Isle" by its inhabitants.

Get around[edit]
By bike[edit]
Most of the roads on the island are gravel and dusty and bumpy...definitely mountain bikes and wide tires. That said, in the town you can get around very easily on a bike on the paved roads near town.
If you're up for a gravel road bike adventure then Beaver Island is a great spot with lots of areas to explore.
Beautiful sandy beaches and also trails through old growth forests. The island is about 14 miles long, in fact it's shaped a lot like the island of Ireland. It's a nice and friendly place to visit.

By car[edit]
If you didn't bring a vehicle with you on the ferry, you can rent a minivan or sport utility vehicle:

The different attractions around the island may not be on the high-end scale of other islands but this is what helps to make the island unique. The first visual attraction a traveler may notice is the island is almost entirely covered in forested areas. After setting foot on the island one may want to go around and see what there is to see. Some good things to see are the beaches such as the one simply known as the Public Beach, Donegal Bay, and Iron Ore Bay are all great places to spend time for any beach goers. For anyone interested in the island's history can visit the island's 45.746083-85.5208821 historical museum to learn and even see some of the history. The island also has two well known lighthouses, one on the northern end and one on the southern. The southern end lighthouse is usually open to the public anytime.
The island is heavily wooded and very remote. The natural beauty of the island is the main draw; there are not many man-made things to see.

Do[edit]
The number one question asked by visitors is "what do you do on the island" and the simple answer is that it is the best place to do nothing. There is no mall, big box stores, or movie house, however, movies can be rented at several island stores and television is available around most of the island. Wireless internet service is free at the library and other locations around the island. There are local bars that many enjoy spending their time. Hunting, camping, fishing, biking, and hiking are some of the recreational offerings.
For anyone into fishing, the Island has around seven inland lakes, however not all are great fishing areas. The best or most popular ones are 45.596236-85.5371971 Lake Geneserath (the largest), 45.650604-85.5671682 Fox Lake, 45.712316-85.5590993 Barney's Lake, and 45.737726-85.5440534 Font Lake.
For the bikers and hikers out there, this place has a good amount of it. While the island may not be very large, hence it won't take too long to get through, it has some nice and beautiful trails to travel through.
A few easily accessible shipwrecks and ruined docks surround the island. In Little Sand Bay there's a keel in hardly a meter of water. Remnants of a dock and some machinery are on the beach near the southern lighthouse.
If someone is looking for a city-like place with busy street, thousands upon thousands of people, malls, outlet stores, numerous generic restaurants, and whatever else a city might generally have, Beaver Island is not that kind of place. It is instead a place to get away from all of that. It is a great getaway place and that is especially true in the summer time. It offers a nice change of pace from the busy cities of America.

Buy[edit]
The island has a 45.750204-85.5094561 McDonough's Market (a regional network of stores) and has a good selection of produce and food and is a good place to do grocery shopping. There is also a Do It Best Hardware Store and Lumber company (an international coop) which features a webcam of the island. This store has just about all your hardware related needs from odd jobs to bigger time construction work. There is an assortment of gift shops to browse, and shirts and hats available at most of the stores and shops.
The island's gas station, 45.729086-85.5265042 Island Energies, or more commonly known simply as "the gas station" or even "the four corners store," is way out of town at an intersection locally known as the four corners and has a small selection of food, alcohol, and even some unique gift shop like items. While some may complain about the prices of gas being high than that of the mainland, tourists need to understand that, like all products, it costs more money to ship the fuel to Beaver Island than it does to the mainland.
