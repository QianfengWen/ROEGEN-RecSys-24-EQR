Bielsko-Biała is a city in the Silesian Voivodeship of southwest Poland, with a population of 170,000 in 2020. It's post-industrial but has many interesting old buildings and museums, and sits at the foot of the Beskidy mountains.


Understand[edit]
House of Frogs
Bielsko is on the west bank of the Biała River and Biała on the east: they only merged administratively in 1951. These names mean "white", indicating clear water. Bielsko was founded in the 13th century, with its hilltop castle, and Biała in the 16th. Both were textile towns, processing wool, but when Poland was partitioned the river became the border: Bielsko as part of Silesia was ruled by Bohemia then Austria, while Biała as part of Lesser Poland lay within the Hapsburg Empire, until Austria annexed it in 1772. Both cities had a large German population but joined reborn Poland in 1918. During World War II the Nazis seized the cities and sent its Jewish population to extermination at Auschwitz. The Red Army liberated the cities in 1945 and its German residents were expelled, to be replaced by ethnic Poles leaving areas that had become part of the USSR. 
Traditional industries of textiles, metal-working and car manufacture collapsed in the late 20th century, with social unrest that helped bring down Poland's communist government. Service and education-related industries have partly filled the void, and Bielsko-Biała has become a tourist centre for its proximity to the mountains. 
City Tourist Information Centre (Miejskie Centrum Informacji Turystycznej) is at Plac Ratuszowy 4 next to City Hall, open M-F 08:00-18:00, Sa Su 09:00-15:00.

By plane[edit]
Katowice Airport (KTW IATA) is in Pyrzowice 80 km north of Bielsko-Biała, and John Paul II Kraków Airport (KRK IATA) is in Balice 65 km east. Both have a wide range of budget flights across Europe but are far side of their cities for reaching Bielsko-Biała, so take their airport bus downtown and change. With a group (and especially young children) you might do better with a taxi direct transfer.

Hourly regional trains from Katowice take 70 min via Tychy, Pszczyna and Czechowice-Dziedzice. They continue south to Zywiec and Zwardon.  
Three trains a day are direct from Kraków, taking 2 hr 30 min via 40 little places you've never heard of, but it's quicker to take the train to Katowice and change.
