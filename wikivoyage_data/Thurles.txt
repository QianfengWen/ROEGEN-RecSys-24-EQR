Thurles is a market town in County Tipperary, Ireland, with a population in 8200. In Irish it's Durlas Éile, "strong fort of the Éile", a tribe or small kingdom that reached its zenith in the 5th century AD. No stronghold remains, and the main reason to visit is Holy Cross Abbey 6 km southwest.


Understand[edit]
By the 19th century, people had more leisure time, disposable income and transport. Various ball games were played, but the rules were haphazard (could you pick up the ball, or not? Grab your opponent by the throat, or not?) and some games were little better than mass brawls between entire villages. Soccer and rugby then became codified and developed sporting structures, but Gaelic football and hurling were slow off the mark — they remained strong in Tipperary and Limerick but were losing support elsewhere. Only in 1887 was the Gaelic Athletic Association founded, at Hayes Hotel in Thurles.
From the outset the GAA wrapped itself in the Irish flag, making out that rival games were unpatriotic, the "garrison games" of the British oppressor. That was a cockamamie version of history: English gentry had long supported Gaelic games, because watching their Irish tenantry knock lumps out of each other was something they could enjoy all day, while placing wagers on the outcome. GAA Rule 27 banned members from taking part in or watching non-Gaelic games: in 1938 they even expelled the President of Ireland for watching an Ireland v Poland soccer match. But as usual the British had exacerbated the hostility. On "Bloody Sunday" in 1920 a police and Black and Tan paramilitary force came to Croke Park in Dublin at the start of a Gaelic football match and began shooting into the crowd: 14 were killed and 60-70 injured. Not until 2001 did GAA abolish Rule 21, which banned members of the British forces, and Rule 42 still stands: that GAA grounds may not be used for competing sports. (A waiver allowed Ireland to play a rugby international at Croke Park in 2007.) Where the GAA has succeeded, beyond the dreams of rugby's Corinthian contingent, is in keeping the game amateur and local. Even the "big names" of the sport are hardly known beyond Ireland, and you are never going to walk down a street in Istanbul or Kuala Lumpur and see the young men all got up in Corofin GAC jerseys.

The town is compact but you need wheels to reach Holycross and other outlying places.

See[edit]
Liberty Square is the centre of town, with well-preserved 19th-century low-rise buidings. Pity about the traffic.
52.6782-7.813021 Lár na Páirce Museum (Tipperary GAA Museum), Slievenamon Road, ☏ +353 504 22702, info@larnapairce.ie. M-Sa 10AM-5:30PM. Lár na Páirce is a museum of memorabilia relating to the GAA and Gaelic Games; but it's chiefly a merchandising outlet for club colours. Adult €5, child €3, conc €4. (updated Jul 2020)
52.68016-7.80892 Cathedral of the Assumption, Thurles Townparks. The original Roman Catholic cathedral of the diocese was on the Rock of Cashel, but that was grabbed by the Protestants at the Reformation. As elsewhere, the Catholics weren't allowed to build their own churches until the Penal Laws were relaxed. This Italianate Romanesque cathedral was built over earlier chapels and completed in 1879, with an impressive rose window and baptistry, and white marble altar. The high-domed tabernacle is by Giacomo della Porta, a pupil of Michelangelo; it came from the Gesu Church in Rome. The cathedral's eight bells can be dinged by hammer but not change-rung, for fear of bringing the campanile crashing down. Free.   (updated Jul 2020)
52.6808-7.80393 St Mary's, St Mary's Avenue. Year-round: Su 1:30-5:30PM, plus Jun-Aug: M-Sa 10AM-5PM. St Mary's is a "First Fruits" church built in 1825 over a Norman ruin — see County Tipperary for more on this initiative to build more Protestant churches in Ireland. It remains in use as a Church of Ireland church and its ground floor also has a small museum about the Great Famine. A "Sheila na Gig" from elsewhere in town is also here. Adult €2.50. (updated Jul 2020)
52.621-7.5234 Famine Warhouse 1848, Farranrory Upper (12 km east of Thurles), ☏ +353 87 908 9972. Apr-Sep: W-Su 2:30-5:30PM; Oct-Mar: Sa Su 2-4PM. 1848 saw rebellions all across Europe, and in the aftermath of the Great Famine, the Young Irelander Rebellion was staged here. A contingent of 47 police approached the flag-waving rebels, but found themselves outnumbered and bolted into this farmhouse, within which were five children. A stand-off turned into a shoot-out, "The Battle of Widow McCormack's cabbage plot". Two rebels were fatally shot but the police were safely ensconced, and when their reinforcements came, the rebels fled. Several were convicted and transported to Bermuda; others escaped to France or the US. Free.  (updated Jul 2020)
52.672-7.9015 Farney Castle, Lisnasella (turn south off R503 at Ballycahill), ☏ +353 504 43281. M-Sa 10AM-5:30PM. The round tower was built in 1495, the rest is a modern mock-castle mansion. Much of the place is now artisan shops selling their own porcelain and knitwear. Castle tours are available. (updated Jul 2020)
52.64-7.8686 Holy Cross Abbey, Holycross (6 km southwest of Thurles). Impressive abbey founded for the Benedictines in 1168 but affiliated to the Cistercians from 1182 and extended 1400-1450. Much of what you see now is a 20th-century reconstruction of the abbey church, which in 1975 became the Roman Catholic parish church. It's long been a pilgrimage site of symbolic importance for religious and national identity in Ireland, as it claims to hold fragments of the "True Cross." The first was probably bestowed by the King of Limerick at the 1182 Cistercian launch; his family had received it from Pope Pascal II. (Other accounts credit Queen Isabella, widow of King John, in 1233, but by then she was out of favour and busted to being a mere Countess.) In the 15th century the fragment was set in the silver Ormond Reliquary. The abbey was ruined at the Reformation but the relic remained, and continued to draw pilgrims; it was a money-spinner for the village. At the 1975 re-opening, the Vatican provided a second fragment, set in a golden Cross of Jerusalem. This was stolen in 2011 but the police recovered it; perhaps it was too recognisable to be sold, and no arrests were made. The abbey is in a picturesque village with a medieval river bridge. Free.  (updated Jul 2020)
52.757-7.8277 Loughmore is a scenic village 10 km north of Thurles. It's more correctly "Loughmoe" or Luach Maigh. The main sight is the ruined castle, a 13th-century tower house, seat of the Purcells. In the village graveyard is a mausoleum to the Cormack brothers, publicly hanged in 1858 for the murder of a cruel land agent; they protested their innocence to the last. In 1910 their bodies were exhumed from Nenagh jail and brought in grand procession to be reburied here.
