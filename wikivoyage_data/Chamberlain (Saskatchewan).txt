Chamberlain is a small village in Southwestern Saskatchewan.


Understand[edit]
Chamberlain's business district along Hwy 11.
Chamberlain is notable for being the last community between Regina and Saskatoon that Highway 11, the Louis Riel Trail, still passes through. The highway narrows to two lanes and its speed limit is reduced from 110 km/h (70 mph) to 50 km/h (30 mph). A number of small restaurants and gas stations benefit from having traffic pass through at slow speed.  It's a good pit-stop for people passing through.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
