Get in[edit]
Most of tourist will come here from Poznań (and probably willing to come back there). They'll be transported by PKS buses, running appr. 15 times daily from bus station in Poznan through Mosina or Wiorek. There’re unfortunately much less connections on weekends, so – if possible – it's better to plan the journey between Monday and Friday.
Those who wish to make a round trip to Rogalin and Kórnik in one day must be prepared, that buses between these two places run only few times a day, so it's better always to check the timetable on [1]
By car – the quickest option is to ride through south-eastern suburbs of  Poznan (Staroleka district), and later on through village called Wiorek to Rogalinek, and from there left along road #431 to Rogalin.

The Castle
See[edit]
The main attraction is the baroque-classicalistic palace of the Raczynski Family, built in present form in 1770s. The complex consists of a palace with two out-buildings, a French-style park and horse-cabs house. In the right (northern) out-buildings there is a collection of remembrances of Edward Raczynski, the last president of Poland in exile. The cabinet of sir Raczynski (which is an exact copy of his London flat at 8, Lennox Garden, where he spent last 26 years of his life) is a very unique place for history-lovers. In the northern part of the main palace building a collection of painting is exhibited. The gallery has worked since 1939 and shows over 250 paintings from Raczynski family collection. One can find here pictures of e.g.: Jan Matejko, Jacek Malczewski (who was a court-painter of the Raczynskis), Stanislaw Wyspianski, Leon Wyczolkowski and works of foreign artist like: Frits Thaulow, Maurice Chabas, Albert Besnard, and others. Just next to the road leading from the Palace eastwards there's a horse-cabs house with a good collection of old cabs; most of them were bought in England.

Connect[edit]
Go next[edit]
A perfect idea would be to connect one-day trip Poznan-Rogalin-Kórnik and back to Poznań, but it seems to be possible only for car-owners (or cyclers). It is also easy to link a visit to Rogalin with a short stay in Wielkopolski National Park, which is only few kilometres away. You can also travel to Rogalin through Puszczykowo or Szreniawa.
