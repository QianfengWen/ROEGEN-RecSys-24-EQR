Höfn (pronounced something like "herpn", also known as Höfn í Hornafirði, is a town in East Iceland, at the south-eastern corner of the country. Höfn sits by the lagoon (or fjord) Hornafjörður which is also the name of the large municipality of which the town is the centre and which covers the entire area of the county Austur-Skaftafellssýsla. This guide covers the town and the surrounding municipality, excluding the westernmost part which forms one of the main gateways to Vatnajökull National Park. For tourism purposes, the area calls itself the Vatnajökull Region: nowhere else is quite as dominated by Europe's largest glacier, nowhere else have people learned to live in such close quarters with the huge sheet of ice.


Understand[edit]
Fishing boats in the harbor of Höfn
In spite of substantial territory, the population of the Hornafjörður area is only around 2400. Höfn is by far the largest settlement with around 2000 inhabitants. The rest of the population is spread along the very narrow patch of arable land between Vatnajökull and the Atlantic Ocean. Höfn's economic activities mainly revolve around fisheries, and the town is especially known for lobster which can be found in abundant quantities in the fishing areas surrounding the southeastern coast.
Despite its name which indicates a fjord, Hornafjörður is a very large lagoon with a blend of fresh and glacial water. The 40 km² lagoon is formed by interactions of the Atlantic Ocean and the Vatnajökull glacier, which by its constant movement produces clay and sand, carried by the glacier rivers and ending up as sediment in the lagoon. The lagoon is shallow, but nevertheless navigable by large ships and the town of Höfn (the name means harbor) is located at the first natural harbor on the south coast after Þorlákshöfn hundreds of kilometers to the west.
The area is dominated by large mountains, wide rivers, and the ever-present Vatnajökull glacier. All of this has combined to make the area one of the most remote in Iceland until the last few decades of the 20th century when roads were significantly improved.

Get in[edit]

By plane[edit]
64.295556-15.2272221 Hornafjörður Airport (HFN  IATA). Eagle Air flies from Reykjavík (RKV IATA) most days. The airport is some distance outside Höfn, though, and the only way into town is by driving. The airport does have one Budget Car Rental (book in advance as it's a small rental station).   
By bus[edit]
The bus stop in Höfn is the 64.259187-15.2062752 N1 gas station just off the main road leading into town.
From Reykjavík, there are two daily buses{ to Höfn. Buses leave from the Mjódd bus terminal in the south of the city, the ride takes 8-9 hours and may entail a transfer in Hvolsvöllur.
Getting in by bus from Egilsstaðir (or Seyðisfjörður, where ferries from Denmark arrive) in the east of the country is doable but requires transfers in Reyðarfjörður and Breiðdalsvík and possibly an overnight stay in the latter.

By car[edit]
The Ring Road is the main road (and in places, the only road) through the entire Hornafjörður area, but Höfn is a few kilometers off the Ring Road and is connected to it by road nr. 99. Höfn is a little over 450 km from Reykjavík and between 200 and 250 km from Egilsstaðir, depending on which route is taken.

Get around[edit]
By car[edit]
If you have a car, it's easy enough to get around and quite difficult to get lost.

By public transportation[edit]
The only means of public transportation is a single taxi which can be ordered by calling ☏ +354 865 4353 – however the town is easily small enough to walk around.

In Höfn[edit]
Höfn can hardly be praised for architectural beauty, but a walk around the harbour can be nice and there is a bird reserve south of the harbor with good walkways. Most of the sights in the area are in fact in the nature outside Höfn. Nevertheless, the town has a few museums that can be of interest:

64.25037-15.203751 Gamlabúð Folk Museum, Víkurbraut (by the main road leading into town). In an old, white timber building on the outskirts of town, this museum focuses on the lives of local people during the period between 1850 and 1950. (The building and the museum have been moved to the harbor area.)  
64.25316-15.211742 Hornafjörður Art Museum, Hafnarbraut 27. A small gallery which hosts exhibitions of the municipal art collection and contemporary local artists.  
64.25101-15.206473 Huldusteinn, Hafnarbraut 11, ☏ +354 866 2820. 14:00-21:00. Collecting rocks is a popular hobby in East Iceland. This private collection of rocks has been opened in Höfn's old swimming pool. Rather odd, but definitely interesting for geology enthusiasts.  
Around Höfn[edit]
Early morning over Jökulsárlón
Organized tours with some of the many tour companies based in Höfn may be the easiest way to get around the area, and the safest way to explore the glaciers.
The area surrounding Höfn has some of the most stunning nature in Iceland. The lowland area a narrow band of floodplains between the sea and the glacier-topped mountains, where large glacial rivers are still relatively untamed. These floodplains are of a sort called sandur - the word is Icelandic for sand but has been adopted as the international scientific name for the sandy floodplains of glacial rivers found almost exclusively in Iceland and Svalbard. The largest such sandur is 63.9842-16.95984 Skeiðarársandur, which wasn't bridged until the 1970s.
The mountains are among the highest in Iceland. 63.999-16.655 Öræfajökull is a sub-glacier of Vatnajökull which contains Iceland's tallest mountain, Hvannadalshnjúkur. In the valleys between the mountains, Vatnajökull has a number of icefalls which are accessible by gravel tracks and for the independent traveller with a good car it's a good idea to search out some of the less popular ones to visit for a private date with nature. Some of the icefalls end in glacial lagoons. The most famous is 64.072-16.2196 Jökulsárlón which is next to the ring road, 100 km west of Höfn. It's an incredible place where large icebergs break off from the glacier and find their way to the sea.
Finally, although the vast majority of the population in the area is found in Höfn, Þórbergur Þórðarson (one of Iceland's most famous writers) came from the farm Hali. Today a museum in his honor, 64.12965-16.017377 Þórbergssetur, is located by Hali which is about 75 km west of Höfn.

During a few days in late June or early July every year the lobster festival Humarhátíð is celebrated in Höfn. The celebrations include concerts and other performances, competitions, a fun fair, general merrymaking and of course different foods made with lobster.

Outside Höfn[edit]
Many great hiking locations are in the area, most mountains other than the very highest can be safely hiked in good weather. Northeast of Höfn is Lónsöræfi, a wilderness which is one of Iceland's great hiking areas perfect for day-long hikes. Lónsöræfi is a part of Vatnajökull National Park, but not easily accessible from any other part of the park.

Go next[edit]
Höfn and the Hornafjörður area are right on the southeastern corner of Iceland. The area has traditionally been one of the most isolated in Iceland, and despite improved road connections distances remain great. To the north is the rest of East Iceland, starting with Höfn's nearest neighbour Djúpivogur (100 km by the Ring Road) and continuing to the East Fjords and Egilsstaðir. To the west is the south coast, the closest town to the west is Kirkjubæjarklaustur (200 km from Höfn by the Ring Road). The very adventurous (and well-prepared) can cross Vatnajökull, into either East Iceland or the Interior but this is understandably a dangerous route.
