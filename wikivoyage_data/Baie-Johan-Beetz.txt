Route 138 arrived in Baie-Johan-Beetz in 1996. For 20 years, from 1976 to 1996, Havre-Saint-Pierre was the end point to the east of Route 138, which runs along the north shore of the river and the Gulf of St. Lawrence; which generated a considerable tourist development. The engineers' challenge was to build infrastructure to span several rivers, including (in order from west to east): Moisie, Matamec, Loups Marins, Pigou, Bouleau, Sault Plat, Tortue, Sault Blanc, Manitou, at Graines, at La Chaloupe, Sheldrake, Couture, Jim-Hearst, Moyac, Duck, at Tonnerre, Brûlée, Béline, Magpie, Saint-Coeur, Saint-Jean, Mingan, Kamenakapeu and Romaine.
