The Bronx is one of the five boroughs of New York. Known for Yankee Stadium, the home field of the New York Yankees baseball team, it has been a borough of New York City since 1898. The vast Bronx Zoo houses hundreds of species of animals. Nearby, the sprawling New York Botanical Garden features a landmark greenhouse with rainforest and cactus displays. By the Hudson River, Wave Hill is a landscaped public garden with wooded paths and a cultural center.


Understand[edit]
The Bronx, often abbreviated as BX, and nicknamed "The Boogie Down", with a population of 1,472,654 (2020), is the only New York City borough on the mainland of the United States. It was originally part of Westchester County but was gradually annexed by New York City. The Bronx was completely incorporated into New York City in 1898.
The Bronx is the only borough with “the” as part of its name. This is because in the early 1600s, a Dutch settler, Jonas Bronck, bought the land from the Native Americans who occupied the territory at the time. Whenever other land owners in the area wanted to travel to that area, they would call it “The Bronck’s Land.” At first, he planned to use the land to grow tobacco crops, but it was too hilly and had marshy terrain.

The Bronx River divides the borough into east and west halves
In time, the Bronx changed the spelling of its name, and flourished into an area with a vibrant and diverse culture.
The Bronx has a strong character all its own. It is the birthplace of hip hop music and home to one of the country's most storied professional baseball teams, the New York Yankees, also known as the "Bronx Bombers." Many ethnic groups have called the Bronx home over the years. Arthur Avenue is still a center of Italian American culture in New York, and many claim it has a more authentic feel than Manhattan's Little Italy. The South Bronx is a center of Puerto Rican culture and life, with a growing Mexican community as well. University Heights and Morris Heights are largely Dominican neighborhoods, while Woodlawn maintains a large population of Irish immigrants.
While the southern and central Bronx are mostly comprised of apartment buildings and densely built, the physical environment of the Bronx is much more varied than what is normally portrayed in the popular media. For instance, Riverdale is a residential neighborhood of mostly detached single family homes located on bluffs overlooking the Hudson River. It looks more like a quiet suburb than the "big bad" Bronx. Bronx Park and Van Cortlandt Park are two large and notably tranquil green spaces. City Island, located in Long Island Sound but officially part of the Bronx, reminds people more of a small New England fishing village and is worth a visit. And there is a traditional downtown area called "The Hub" at 149th Street and Third Avenue. While not as large or extensive as the downtowns of major American cities, many larger stores are in that area and it is more than just a neighborhood shopping district.

Geographically, the Bronx has a lot of hills. It is possible to stand on a street corner and look way down over a cliff toward the elevated train line that is itself 30 feet (9m) above ground. Many streets, especially in the West Bronx north of Yankee Stadium, have sections with steps instead of sidewalks and pavement, similar to San Francisco.

Get in[edit]
By subway[edit]
The Bronx is directly connected to Manhattan by the  1 ,  2 ,  4 ,  5 ,  6 ,  B , and  D  subway lines. Further extensions of these (with the exception of the  1  and  6 ) can be found in Brooklyn.

By rail[edit]
The Harlem, Hudson, and New Haven Lines of the Metro-North commuter railway, which originate in Grand Central Terminal make various stops in the Bronx.

By bus[edit]
Express buses run from Midtown Manhattan (except for the BxM18, which runs from lower Manhattan during rush hours) to various parts of the Bronx, and are a better bet than a taxi. Local MTA (Metropolitan Transit Authority) bus connections with Upper Manhattan and parts of Queens also exist.

By car[edit]
It is possible to drive across one of the many bridges from Manhattan or the three bridges from Queens, and points north are accessible via several highways (including I-87, Bronx River Parkway, Hutchinson River Parkway, and I-95.

By taxi[edit]
Taxis from Midtown or Lower Manhattan can be very expensive.

By foot[edit]
Pedestrians can cross any of the bridges that connect Manhattan with the Bronx.

Get around[edit]

The Bronx has good subway coverage but all lines are mainly north to south, with the subway lines designed more for access to Manhattan than crosstown travel in the Bronx, and many of its bus lines are slow and overcrowded at times. Many people who need flexibility in getting across the Bronx drive; however, the notorious overcrowding on the Cross-Bronx Expressway sometimes reduces such crosstown travel to a standstill.
Another option is Metro-North Railroad. It only serves limited sections of the Bronx, but those tend to be the areas without subway service. (There is the Hudson Line in the West Bronx, and the Harlem Line in the central section of the Bronx.) The fares are higher than the subway, and the trains don't run as frequently, but they offer less crowding. On the weekends, a "CityTicket", which allows a trip within the city boundaries, costs $5.00. In general, with sufficient planning and time, you can enjoy the borough through a combination of subway and bus travel and walking. A bus map can be found here.
Separated bikeways connect Pelham Bay Park in the east through Bronx Park in the central Bronx and Van Cortlandt Park in the west. Street bike lanes go most everywhere.

An island in the Long Island Sound, the City Island has a very different feel from the rest of the Bronx or New York City.

The island is chockablock with seafood restaurants. The restaurants are not noteworthy, but the atmosphere is. Has a good nightlife.   (updated Jul 2020)

Sports[edit]
The Great Hall inside the new Yankee Stadium
40.82959-73.926451 Yankee Stadium, 161st St and River Ave (Subway:  B  D  &  4  at 161st Street-Yankee Stadium. Metro-North: 153rd Street-Yankee Stadium). Home of the New York Yankees baseball and New York City FC soccer team. The old Yankee Stadium, "The House That Ruth Built", is no longer in use, and has been replaced by the new Yankee Stadium across the street. The site of the old stadium is now Heritage Park, a large baseball and softball field that has a few nods to the old ballpark, like markers in the sidewalk paying tribute to the history of the old stadium and a section of the frieze from the old park. The current stadium has strict security policies, and as such backpacks and camcorders are not allowed inside (only bags under 14" permitted). Monument Park behind center field pays homage to the great, Yankee legends of baseball; it officially closes 45 minutes before game time, but is oftentimes closed sooner if the crowds are large enough. If visiting Monument Park is a priority, best bet is to arrive close to when the gates open. Game tickets are expensive (many go for over $100) and should be bought far in advance. Stadium tours are also available for $20.

Stay safe[edit]
During the 1970s and the 1980s, the Bronx experienced two of the toughest decades in American history, and was considered one of the most dangerous places in the USA. Now those days are far behind. The crime rate declined by 71% from 1993 to 2010 and New York City police and fire departments continue to protect the residents from criminal activity and fires.
Make sure you have a map or a destination in mind before heading out to explore the Bronx. Most of the neighborhoods in the Bronx are well-lit and safe and you can venture out to some of the best restaurants in New York City.
You can decrease your chances of trouble by following these tips:

Always remain in populated well-lit areas.
Don't interact with anyone who appears mentally unstable or somewhat menacing.
Don't leave important travel documents unsecured in hotel rooms.
Only use ATMs at reputable banks. When using ATMs outside, be very aware of surroundings and quickly put away cash. Avoid using independent, non-bank ATMs found in delis or stores.
During late nights, be wary of riding in empty subway cars, and select the car with a conductor present if possible.
Avoid buying tickets from anyone on the streets, unless you really know what you're doing, as many are counterfeit.
