Chofu (調布市 Chōfu-shi) is a western suburb of Tokyo, and the main draws are Jindaiji Temple and Jindai Botanical gardens.  These twin attractions are next to each other, making a reasonable day trip from central Tokyo.  Beyond these two, Chōfu feels like the suburb that it is, particularly on the weekends when the train platform is crowded with parents and their children.
