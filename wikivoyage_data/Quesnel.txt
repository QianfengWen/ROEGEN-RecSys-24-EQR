Quesnel (pronounced kwinnel) is a city of about 12,000 people (2016) in the Cariboo region of British Columbia on the bank of the Fraser River. The town got its start via its location on the Cariboo Wagon Road which transported thousands of prospectors seeking their fortunes during the Cariboo Gold Rush. Today the city is supported by the forestry industry.

History[edit]
Long before the arrival of prospectors during the Cariboo Gold Rush of 1862, the Southern Carrier (Dakelh) people lived off the land around Quesnel, occupying the area from the Bowron Lakes in the east to the upper Blackwater and Dean Rivers in the west. The Southern Carrier Nation were known among themselves as ‘Uda Ukelh’, meaning ‘people who travel by boat on water early in the morning’. The name "Quesnel" is derived from Jules Maurice Quesnel, who accompanied Simon Fraser on his journey to the Pacific Ocean. Quesnel came to be called 'Quesnellemouth' to distinguish it from 'Quesnel Forks', 97 km (60 mi) up river. In 1870 it had been shortened to Quesnelle and by 1900 it was spelled the way it is now.

The Quesnel gold pan
Quesnel is along the gold mining trail known as the Cariboo Wagon Road and was the commercial centre of the Cariboo Gold Rush. It also marks one end of the Alexander MacKenzie Heritage Trail. Because of its location on the Fraser River it was also an important landing for sternwheelers during 1862 until 1886 and then from 1909 until 1921. The last sternwheeler on the upper Fraser was Quesnel's own namesake craft, and home town product, the Quesnel.

Climate[edit]
Quesnel's humid continental climate is very mild by Canadian standards, being subject to marine airflows from the Pacific. Overnight lows are still cool even in summer, but daytime temperatures average above 24 °C (75 °F) in that season.
