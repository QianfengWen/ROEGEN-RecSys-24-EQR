Howth (rhymes with both) is a small seaside town historically in County Dublin, 14 km northeast of Dublin city centre. It's on a "tombola" peninsula - once an island, it became connected to the mainland by a sandy isthmus, which is now the residential area of Sutton. The main reasons to visit Howth are for its beaches, clifftop walks and boat trips. It's glorious in August and September when the heather cloaks the cliffs in red. 


Understand[edit]
The name "Howth" is probably from Old Norse Hǫfuð, a headland. Vikings colonised here from 819, and after their defeat by Brian Boru at Clontarf in 1014 they held out here until 1177. Then the Normans crushed them (hence the "Bloody Stream") and began building the castle. Howth developed as a fishing and trading port. In the 19th century it competed with Dún Laoghaire to be a shipping port for Dublin, but silting of the harbour meant it eventually lost its commercial business. Fishing continues and there's a coastguard base and leisure marina. In 1994 County Dublin was divided, so Howth is now in County Fingal, and in 2022 had a population of 8400. 
The Tourist Information Centre is in the Old Courthouse by the harbour, open daily 9:30AM-5PM.

See[edit]
Howth harbour
53.39-6.0651 Howth Harbour is the second biggest commercial fishing port in Ireland and also contains a leisure marina. There are excellent views along the coast from the East Pier and a stone lighthouse at the tip of it. The West Pier just beside the Dart Station is lined with restaurants and there's an imprint of the footsteps of King George IV, who landed here on a visit to Ireland in 1821. (Yes, the cement was wet at the time, he was notoriously heavy but not that heavy.) In July 1914, 900 rifles were landed at Howth by Erskine Childers to arm the Irish nationalists; many were put to use in the Easter Rising and Anglo-Irish war.
53.3873-6.06642 St Mary's Abbey is just a masonry shell within a cemetery. It dates back to 1235 though much modified over later centuries. Enter the cemetery from Church Street: the Abbey ruin itself may be locked, enquire locally about access, or just admire the setting with the old gravestones and views over the harbour and Ireland's Eye.
53.3865-6.0793 Howth Castle. Closed. The castle dates from 1450 but was extensively re-built by Lutyens in 1911. The castle estate or desmesne includes much of Howth Head, with the outlying areas (eg the clifftop walks) having free public access. It's set in Deer Park, an extensive parkland with rhododendrons and a golf course. Since 2019 it's been closed for redevelopment as a hotel, but the castle cookery school has restarted. It's not known what will happen to the Transport Museum here. (updated May 2024)
St Mary’s Church of Ireland is an attractive little stone church at the castle gates, on Howth Rd west of the Dart station. It was built in 1866.
Dolmen Howth or "Aideen's grave" is a partly-collapsed megalith in the woods 300 m west of the castle golf club. "Portal tombs" of this style were built until around 2500 BC, but Aideen is a mythical figure from around 3rd century AD.
 National Transport Museum, Heritage Depot, Howth Demesne D13 NF86 (next to the castle), ☏ +353 1 848 0831. Sa Su 2-5PM. Volunteer-run museum with some 100 vehicles, including the trams which formerly lumbered over the Hill of Howth. It needs to find a better home, because the exhibits are tightly parked together, and Ireland's transport history deserves a better display. Adult €4.50, child or conc €3. (updated May 2024)
53.373-6.0694 Ben of Howth is an open area of three hills. The highest, topped by radio aerials, is Black Linn, 171 m (561 ft) so it's a "Marilyn". You can drive or walk up: Greenhollows Quarry is active, so this part is ugly, with heavy machinery churning the track. The other peaks are Shielmartin Hill (163 m) 1 km west, and Dun Hill 500 m northwest. Good views over Ireland's Eye and on a clear day you can see the aircraft landing and taking off at Dublin Airport.
53.4053-6.06365 Ireland's Eye is a small uninhabited island north of Howth, reached by a 15-min boat ride. There are ruins of a Martello Tower and the 8th-century "Church of The Three Sons of Nessan". Just off the Eye are the islet of Thulla and "The Stack" at the northeast corner. Birdlife includes guillemots, razorbills, fulmars, gulls, gannets, cormorants and a few puffins. Grey seals may haul out on the rocks. There are no restrictions on access, but please avoid the cliffs (e.g. for rock-climbing) April-June during the main nesting season. In summer boats ply to the island and others make non-landing cruises around it, enquire at Howth harbour.
Claremont Beach is right behind the Dart station down a rather grim concrete path, however there are nice views and its possible to walk (or scramble at high tide) along the sand all the way back to Sutton. A lifeguard is on duty in summer.
Do[edit]
Howth cliff walk
Walk: a firm trail goes east of town along the cliffs all the way round to the south of the peninsula, passing Bailey Lighthouse. A complete circuit takes 3-4 hours.
- The lighthouse can also be approached by a 15-min walk from The Summit pub, but the lighthouse and its precincts are closed to the public.
- Inland trails loop over the hills, but you need stout boots and waterproofs, the "Bog of Frogs" route is well-named.
Maps for these and other loop walks are displayed by the Dart Station and available at the Tourist office in the Old Courthouse.
Beaches: at low tide a long sandy beach stretches along the north shore from Sutton to Howth Harbour. Dogs are welcome. The rising tide separates it into Burrow Beach to the west, Hole in the Wall in the middle, and Claremont Beach next to Howth Harbour. The far side of the harbour is Balscadden Bay, quite stony, then it's rocks and cliffs east of there. South tip of the peninsula is Jameson or Drumleck beach, small and not worth the extra distance. There are one or two beautiful little sandy coves on the south side of the Howth peninsula, accessible from the cliff walk which starts close to Sutton dinghy club.
Play golf at Deer Park by the castle, Howth Golf Club near the west shore, or Sutton Golf Club on Cush Point to the west.
Cinema: the nearest is the Odeon, 5 km west at 84 Malahide Rd, Coolock.
Howth Tradfest (Féile Binn Éadair) is a traditional music and ballad festival in May.
Howth Roots & Blues Festival is in August.
Howth Maritime and Seafood Festival is in September and replaces the Dublin Bay Prawn Festival.
