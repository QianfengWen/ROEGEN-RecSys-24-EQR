Get in[edit]

The train station is fairly close to the city centre, only some 10 minutes in walking distance.

By car[edit]
Lier can be conveniently reached by car. It's halfway between the E19 (Antwerp to Brussels) and E313 (Antwerp to Liège). They are not really close to Lier, but there is a well-developed network of national roads connecting the town with the highways and other close-by cities, like the N10 to Antwerp, N14 to Mechelen and N13 to the E313. Like many towns in Belgium it is a problem, however, to park your car in the city centre.

Best method to discover Lier. Most places of interest are in the centre of the city and lay only a couple of minutes from each other.

Much of the surrounding area can be accessed by cycle routes and the Nete Canal towpath. Riding a bicycle is not permitted in the market, although many of the locals bring bikes to the market, not to ride, but to use as pack-horses for their shopping.
