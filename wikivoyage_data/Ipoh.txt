Ipoh
Nestled within steep limestone hills on the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia, Ipoh has the proud heritage of a former tin mining boom town. While the current state capital of Perak had bigger heydays during the early 20th century, it is now better known amongst Malaysians for its excellent restaurants, hawkers, and famous local dishes. Old residents are returning to their beloved hometown, eager to remake Ipoh into the "City of Millionaires" yet again. The country's third largest city, with 657,852 inhabitants as of 2010, is also a gateway to the Cameron Highlands and Pangkor Island.


Understand[edit]
Ipoh was the city that tin built, developing into one of Malaysia's major cities after rich alluvial tin deposits were discovered in the Kinta Valley in 1876. Its location as the furthest navigable point on the Kinta River at that time made it a prime spot for the centre of all trading activities, an upstart little village bypassing the already established towns at nearby Gopeng and Papan. Waves of starry-eyed prospectors, many of them Chinese immigrants, came to find their fortunes working the mines and providing support services to the industry. It rapidly grew into Malaya's second commercial and administrative centre after Kuala Lumpur (the Straits Settlements of Singapore, Penang and Malacca were administered separately during the British colonial era), overtaking Taiping, the then state capital.
World War II hit Ipoh hard, with all mines shut down and left to flood. Even after their reopening, demand for tin continued to drop steadily over the years and production costs rose. It culminated in the debilitating crash of tin prices in October 1985 from cartel meddling which then became the final nail in the coffin for the mines, just slightly over one hundred years after the very first tin rush. Many residents of Ipoh finally left for greener pastures elsewhere, as their forefathers did before them, though the city has been slowly reclaiming its stature since. Food, and not tin, is now the word most synonymous with Ipoh.
The post-independence economic decline let the city escape the Brutalist towers of concrete that represent 1970s ideas of progress, and its colonial importance still shines in the grand old buildings, such as the railway station and the town hall, which complement the rows of shophouses. There are surprisingly few tall buildings for a city of its size due to height restrictions for the local airport, hence inadvertently maintaining its sleepy old town charm. However, this is soon to change after a push by the state government for more development projects.

As in the rest of Malaysia, Ipoh has a typical tropical climate. Temperatures are generally constant year round, with daily highs of around 30-32°C (86-90°F) and nightly lows around 22-24°C (71-75°F). Rain and thunderstorms can also be expected fairly often, along with high humidity. The wettest months of the year are from October to November, while the least amount of rain is seen in January and February.

Visitor centre[edit]
4.59787101.075911 Ipoh City Tourist Information Centre, Jln Bandar (near the Padang). 9PM-6PM except on public holidays. The visitor centre has a spacious hall with tourist brochures, photographs of historic landmarks and goodies from the local cottage industries. Staff are on hand to help with attraction and accommodation enquiries. 
Talk[edit]
As in the rest of Malaysia, Malay is the lingua franca, However, most of the ethnic Chinese, who form the majority in Ipoh, speak Cantonese as their first language, and many are also able to speak Mandarin. Most of the Indians speak Tamil as their first language, and quite a few others speak Urdu. Most younger locals would be able to communicate in basic English.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Sultan Azlan Shah Airport
4.5704101.09851 Sultan Azlan Shah Airport (IPH  IATA). Serves only a small number of flights, with a single domestic flight to Johor Bahru on AirAsia, and international services to Singapore on both AirAsia and Scoot.   
For most visitors from elsewhere, the most practical option for getting to Ipoh would be to fly into either Kuala Lumpur or Penang, which have larger and better served airports, and make your way to Ipoh by road.

By train[edit]
Ipoh's second concrete building, the railway station, was built in 1935. An open plaza with Ipoh's namesake tree in the middle is found outside the station.
From 4.5982101.07342 Ipoh Railway Station, trains head as far north as Padang Besar (4h) and as far south as Johor Bahru (including Singapore) via Kuala Lumpur. Kuala Lumpur is predictably well served by several trains per day. To KL, prices for the old diesel trains (3 hr) range from RM12 to RM30 depending on class. New electric trains (2 hr) cost from RM25 (stopping service) to RM50 (express non-stop). ETS service to Butterworth (2 hr) has ticket prices of RM22-33. The train station can get crowded at times and there can be barely any space to sit or stand, particularly so on weekends when the roads around the station are also very jammed.

By bus[edit]
The main bus terminal is at 4.6701101.07293 Terminal Amanjaya, 16 km north of city center, from where buses run to most of Peninsular Malaysia.
To get to the city centre (Stesen Bas Medan Kidd) from the terminal, you have to take T30a or T30b (myBAS) from the upper level. It costs around RM2 and runs about every 30 min. To pay you have to have a Touch'nGO card (which can be purchased at the information counter downstairs). Taxi fare will be at least RM20.
Most frequent routes are to and from Kuala Lumpur (Terminal Bersepatu Selatan), Singapore and Penang. Larger bus companies like Transnational, Plusliner, Konsortium and Sri Maju provide the most frequent, reliable and safe services. For Taiping and the Cameron Highlands, the local bus station (see Get around) is more convenient.
Some bus companies also operate from more convenient locations in the town: mainly 4.5897101.08244 Jalan Bendahara. Choice is limited but for Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Butterworth or Singapore, they represent a better option than a trip out of town.

Sri Maju 2, 4 & 6 Jalan Bendahara, +60 5 253 5367, fairly decent selection of destinations, including Hat Yai in Thailand. Tickets can be bought via their website and you can pay via credit cards.
Lapan Lapan (88 brand)[dead link], +65 6392 2188 (Singapore number) has services from Jalan Bendahara to Singapore (RM55).
Grassland Express[dead link], Singapore based company, also serves Jalan Bendahara.
Starshuttle runs to Kuala Lumpur International Airport from Jalan Bercham (about RM40 one way).

By car[edit]
Ipoh is well connected to the North-South Expressway. You can get into Ipoh via Exit 137: Simpang Pulai or Exit 139: Ipoh Selatan.

Get around[edit]
4°35′36″N 101°4′50″EMap of Ipoh
Ipoh is split into half by the River Kinta: Old Town on the west side and New Town on the east. Old Town is walkable, New Town less so. City outskirts are reachable by taxis or public buses in a pinch, and your own wheels are best for further outlying areas. Streets were renamed in the 1980s. This can still be confusing as many locals still refer to the former colonial road names. The following list showing the old and new names is useful: Ipoh road names - old and new. Jalan Bijih Timah, for example, used to be known as Treacher Street.

By car[edit]
The city centre grid layout contains mainly one-way streets. Road maps are available in bookstores, tourist centres and online. Traffic is not as heavy as in other cities such as Kuala Lumpur but the rush hours are usually congested. There is adequate parking but finding a space may require some patience. Car rentals are available.

By bus[edit]
Local buses run around the city and its suburbs and have a hub called 4.594101.07292 Ipoh Bus Terminal, Medan Kidd (or also bas stesen), which is on Jalan Tun Abdul Razak in the old town (follow the road south from the railway station and past the post office, the bus station is on the right of the first big junction). This is not to be confused with Jalan Bendahara which is in the new town and has long distance services by some bus companies. Ipoh city buses: www.peraktransit.com.my may be useful.
Local bus information is not well published but there is a helpful information desk at the bus station. Visitors may find this bus station useful for its services to the Cameron Highlands and Taiping. Useful to look out for is local bus number 94, which heads from the bus station (bas stesen) through the old and new towns to the Sam Poh Tong Cave Temples. It calls at the following bus stops in the new town: Tingat Pasar, on the south side of Pasar Besar; at the junction of Jalan Raja Musa Aziz and Jalan Theatre; and on Jalan CM Yusuf, near the Grand Park Hotel and Sri Maju Bus Terminal.

On foot[edit]
Most roads have pavements and marked crossings, which makes strolling around the old streets a pleasant experience.

By bicycle[edit]
There are no hard and fast rules for cyclists, but you are expected to observe road rules at all times. Cyclists are forbidden from riding on the sidewalk but often do. Helmets are optional but not common.

By taxi[edit]
Prices are by negotiation. It is possible to take the taxi all the way up to Pengkelan Hulu (near the Thailand border, c. RM170 one way, c. RM300 return). Rides within the city should cost around RM5 to RM10. The better alternative to taxi is GrabCar, a Southeast Asian Uber alternative; through the app, you will see the price beforehand and are less likely to have to negotiate.

See[edit]
Old Town[edit]
The heart of Ipoh Old Town lies on the west banks of the Kinta River and is vaguely bounded by the train tracks. A two- to three-hour guided tour of the Ipoh heritage trail starts at the Railway Station at 8AM every Saturday (as of 2015, RM30 per person). Rejuvenated Kong Heng Square on Jalan Sultan Yussuf houses buzzing small cafes and shops.

Historic Buildings[edit]
The HSBC building in Old Town
4.59688101.076311 Birch Memorial Clocktower, Jalan Dato Segor. Dedicated to the first British Resident Minister of Perak who was murdered by a local Malay chief. The chief's profitable trade in Orang Asli, indigenous tribal folk, was curtailed by the British abolition of slavery. By all accounts he wasn't well-liked personally and the road passing the tower's north side is now named in the killer's honour. It hosts friezes representing the progress of civilization and depicts various religious and secular worthies, but the Prophet Muhammad was painted out as a respect to local sensitivities. 
4.59741101.073292 Ipoh Railway Station, Jalan Sultan Iskandar. One of the three grand British-built stations on the former Malayan network. ETS trains connect this station, fondly dubbed "Taj Mahal of Ipoh", to KL's colonial beauty, Kuala Lumpur Railway Station (one stop before KL Sentral). The fountains on Ipoh Station square are active between 8PM and midnight. The cenotaph on Ipoh Station quare commemorates the deaths of different wars.  
4.59785101.074853 Ipoh Town Hall and Law Courts. The two buildings opposite the Railway Station, in neoclassical style. 
4.6044101.0784 Muzium Darul Ridzuan, Jalan Panglima Bukit Gantang. An interesting historical museum of Perak in a former tin-mining tycoon's pretty mansion. 
St Michael's Institution
4.5991101.07655 Padang Ipoh (Ipoh Green). This immaculate lawn near Jalan S.P. Seenivasagam was planted by the British during the colonial period as the cricket ground for the Ipoh Club, then a whites-only establishment. Today, it still serves as the main cricket ground for the Royal Ipoh Club (re-named from the Ipoh Club after the Sultan of Perak was admitted as the club's first non-white member), and is also used as the club's football (soccer) ground when not in use for cricket. The surrounding historic buildings include the mock-Tudor style Royal Ipoh Club, FMS Bar, HSBC Building and the magnificent St Michael's Institution secondary school. 
4.5963101.07916 Han Chin Pet Soo (Ipoh World), 3 Jalan Bijih Timah. Appointment only, closed M. A painstakingly restored Hakka Miners' Club that documents the activities of tin miners far away from home with cash to spend. Opium smoking, gambling and prostitution were some favourite vices and are shown in all their glory through the use of carefully curated antique items. The history of tin mining in Perak is also exhibited with old mining equipment and photographs of the big towkays (bosses). Free but donations welcome. (updated Aug 2015)
4.6012101.07937 Kinta Riverfront Walk. Come here at night, as trees are beautifully lighted up, making it a romantic riverside walk. There's a small hut with an interesting exhibit depicting the rise and fall of Ipoh's tin mining industry. It's also possible to hire bicycles for a more vigorous workout. (updated Jul 2015)
4.36101.48 Little India. Various Indian related outlets, including clothing and food. And you can also find Indian restaurants and cafes here. Every year the Deepavali Carnival is held by locals here. (updated Nov 2023)
Street art[edit]
Seven wall murals, of which six still exist in 2020, have been painted by Ernest Zacharevic, the same Lithuanian artist that took George Town by storm. The one on Jalan Bijih Timah (literally Tin Ore Road) showcases the once-important tin mining industry that made Ipoh. Pick up a map from the Ipoh Padang Old Town White Coffee branch, or just wander around the old town streets as each mural displays this map. In addition to these, more street art is hidden throughout the old town.

In the new town, Erik Lai, a local art teacher, has initiated the painting of multiple murals on old heritage buildings in an effort to preserve them. These displays multiple aspect of the Malaysian culture : lion dance, kids kepang dance, a playful multi-mural displays kids playing hide&seek. All of these are found in a lane between Jalan Masjid and Jalan Sultan Iskandar (Hugh Low Street). See the murals at the 4.593819101.08109417 Mural Art’s Lane, Jalan Masjid, Taman Jubilee. Mural Art’s Lane lies in Ipoh New Town where all the murals were painted on the back walls of old heritage houses. In an attempt to preserve them, Eric Lai, a local art teacher, started the painting of numerous murals on those buildings. These demonstrate various facets of Malaysian culture, such as Chinese lion dance, kuda kepang Malay dance, traditional Indian dance, playful multi-mural displays of children playing hide & seek, and beautiful waterfall scenery. 
Around Ipoh[edit]
Sam Poh Tong Chinese Buddhist Temple - accessible only through a cave, the temple and its accompanying tortoise pond create a serene and peaceful atmosphere
Thousands of miles away from their motherlands, religion remained a touchstone for the Chinese and Indian communities. Cave temples abound in the karst limestone hills north and south of Ipoh, although only the richest and most famous are properly looked after and not forgotten.

4.6444101.099218 Perak Tong (Perak Cave), Gunung Tasek. 8AM-5PM. Houses over 40 Buddha statues and many murals. There is a steep, tall staircase in the interior of the cave rising up to the top of its hill, where one is greeted by a beautiful and panoramic view of Ipoh and its surroundings. The statue of Buddha in Perak Tong is the tallest and largest of its kind in Malaysia. Perak Tong was built in 1926 by a Buddhist priest from China. (updated Aug 2015)
4.5641101.115519 Sam Poh Tong (Cavern of Triple Gems). 9AM-2:15PM (for Sam Poh Tong). Actually a cluster of three Chinese temples in Gunung Rapat. The first temple, Ling Sen Tong is shrouded in the smokey haze of hundreds of joss sticks. Its neighbour, Nam Thean Tong, has hundreds of stairs that climb right through the mountain to high up on the other side, providing great views. Sam Poh Tong itself is the third of the row, just after the small coffee shop, where you should relax after climbing all the stairs of Nam Thean Tong. By this temple's entrance is a charming landscaped bonsai garden and fish pond; inside, a tunnel leads right through the rocks to the sanctuary of the temple and its tortoise pond; you can buy tomatoes for RM3 to feed the tortoise. On the road leading to the temples are stalls selling pomelos. Sam Poh Tong also contains a vegetarian restaurant. Local bus 94 continues to right next to these temples after passing the former Medan Gopeng Bus Terminal. RM10 in a taxi from the city should be enough, and regional buses will also get you there quickly from the centre of town. (updated Aug 2019)
4.5592101.129420 Kek Lok Tong (Cavern of Ultimate Bliss), Pesiaran Sepakat 3, Tmn Endah Jaya. Calm Chinese cave temple with good views on the other side of the same limestone hill as Sam Poh Tong. Being newer and a little richer than the other cave temples, the place feels much airier and cleaner. Monkeys can be found here. Accessible through Gunung Rapat housing area. Taxi from Ipoh town should cost RM10. (updated Aug 2019)
4.59139101.0662721 Sri Maha Mariamman Temple, Jalan Sungai Pari, Buntong (just before the bridge on the river). An old Tamil temple. Not only is it religious in nature but also a place for discourses, and on Sundays, children are given an introduction to verses in Tamil. (updated Aug 2015)
Outside Ipoh[edit]
Peaceful Batu Gajah was initially the planned European centre for Kinta Valley in the Federated Malay States, but the rough and tumble Ipoh quickly stole its crown. The areas surrounding Ipoh were similarly diminished by the tin mining crash, and may yet be absorbed into Ipoh proper.

Kellie's Castle in Batu Gajah
4.475101.087722 Kellie's Castle. The deserted mansion of an eccentric Scottish planter, located in Batu Gajah, is half an hour's drive from Ipoh city centre. Its main appeal lies in the belief that it is haunted and that secret passages leading to hidden chambers exist. A taxi will cost you around RM50-60 and they will usually wait for an hour (which is long enough to look around). RM5 for adults, RM3 for kids 3-12. (updated Jul 2015)
4.3965101.053523 Tanjung Tualang Tin Dredge Ship, 9th Km, Jalan Tanjung Tualang, Batu Gajah. The last tin dredge that has not been dismantled from its old workspace is an example of how easy it was to extract alluvial deposits from the river by merely scooping up tin-bearing soil on an industrial scale and filtering out the ore. There is a small museum and tours are available for both the outside and inside of the dredge depending on pricing. RM5-15. (updated Aug 2015)
4.5167101.016724 Papan. A century-old half-deserted mining town built on a rich deposit of tin that was due to be dug up before the price of the metallic ore halved in the 1980s. In the war years, resistance fighters based themselves here as the last outpost before the inhospitable jungle terrain, even setting up an invaluable free clinic and dispensary. Nowadays nature is slowly taking its own course, with caved-in roofs and overgrown houses, though the odd elderly resident seems content in their familiar surroundings. (updated Aug 2015)
Do[edit]
Sports[edit]
Limestone caves at Gua Tempurung
Cricket:  Royal Ipoh Club (at Padang Ipoh). Founded in 1895, this is the club's football and cricket ground. (updated Sep 2023)
4.416101.18761 Caving at Gua Tempurung. Gua Tempurung is the largest limestone cave in Peninsular Malaysia. Located close to the North South Highway's Gopeng Exit, it provides the opportunity to explore in detail the insides of a limestone cave. You can choose to experience a short tour of the cave or adventure into the far end of the cave by walking off the walkways and in the cave river. The wet adventures have you wading in the cold underground water, squeezing through holes and sliding over smooth rocks, but require at least 8 people to start. RM6-22. (updated Jul 2015)
 White Water Rafting, Kampar River. Get wet and wild with nature on the Kampar River, a 12-km ride down big rapids, taking 1½ to 2 hours depending on how high the water level is. The rapids have some of the easiest grades for beginners and are a good choice for family bonding. Transport from a set location (usually Gua Tempurung) to the river is usually provided by the guides and participants also get a briefing on safety, paddling and rafting techniques. Radak Adventure and Nomad Adventure are two such companies in the area. RM100-200. 
Hiking[edit]
4.57628101.030222 Bukit Kledang, Menglembu. Trek up one of the many trails up the Menglembu-Kledang Hills (these are the hills you can see to the west of Ipoh with the radio-TV masts on the top) to enjoy the awe-inspiring view of the limestone outcrops that surround Ipoh. If unsure of how to get to these trails, just ask the many locals who trek up daily in the early mornings and late evenings. If you have a GPS, hikes can either start from 101° 1.813'E/4° 34.577'N or at 101° 1.638'E/ 4° 34.312'N where the paved road to the summit begins. Most trails are open and hot (take a hat and water) but much of Trail 4.9 is through shady forest. There are interesting plants and some wildlife (long-tailed macaques, pig-tailed macaques, leaf monkeys, and siamang) to be seen if you are lucky. 
4.44033101.253333 Ulu Geroh. Be an ecotourist and experience the rainforest here. This is an Orang Asli kampung about one hour's drive into the hills east of Gopeng. The last half of the ride is along a rough road (4x4 preferred) through rubber, durian and oil palm plantations to the village on the edge of the rainforest. Guides from the Orang Asli community take visitors to see the parasitic Rafflesia flower (the largest flower in the world) and the Raja Brooke's Birdwing butterfly as well as other forest bugs, plants, etc. There's also a small but beautiful waterfall. You will need your IC or passport number for the visitor log book. Basic accommodation is available at Ulu Geroh itself or in a rural setting at three nearby eco-resorts: (My Gopeng Resort, Rumah Rehat Adeline and Gopeng Rainforest Resort). 
Parks and recreation[edit]
Boats across the lake from Gunung Lang
4.6256101.1564 The Lost World of Tambun. Ipoh's only water theme park provides great rides and entertainment for families and also organizes tours into the nearby limestone caves for those interested in eco-tourism. It has a petting zoo that allows children to feed and pet a variety of animals. Tambun has been traditionally known for its juicy pomelo fruit and the Tambun Hot Springs (now known as the Lost World Hot Springs and Spa). Soaking in these hot springs is said to bring health benefits to the body because of the high sulphur content in the water. RM40-50. (updated Jul 2015)
4.6279101.09085 Gunung Lang. A general recreational park with a man-made waterfall and a long waterfront boardwalk. The serene 80-foot-deep lake, like many others in the region, hides the deep scars tin mining made on the landscape. There's a mini zoo and playground for the kids and campsites for overnight stays. A boat ride is required to get across the lake to the park. RM3. (updated Jul 2015)
 Golf. The Perak Royal Golf Club is the oldest of the golf courses located close to the city centre but there are also great golf courses at Clearwater Sanctuary in Batu Gajah and Meru Valley in Jelapang. Clearwater Sanctuary and Meru Valley also provide accommodation. 
Buy[edit]
Ipoh is inexpensive by Malaysian standards. Most tourists will better appreciate the offerings of KL or Bangkok but Ipoh offers some interesting specialties, which predictably revolve around food.

Local specialities[edit]
Pastries like Ipoh fragrant biscuits (香饼 or heong pang), traditional flaky biscuits containing a sticky sweet malt paste, are always popular. Handmade examples are rare though the factory-made ones are longer lasting and handily packed for souvenirs. Malaysia's best pomelos (柚), a citrus fruit with massive rind and mild taste, are reputedly from Tambun, about 10 km north of the city centre. Pottery is also produced for export. If pots are your bag, try Jalan Kuala Kangsar. Coffee beans specially roasted with palm-oil margarine, better known as white coffee, originated from Ipoh. The packet versions are not particularly special and are sold throughout the country anyway.

A sweet and flaky heong pang or Ipoh Fragrant Biscuit
Ipoh Fragrant Biscuits aka Heong Pang (香饼)[edit]
4.57575101.119941 Seng Kee Food Trading, 177 Lorong Gunung Rapat 3, ☏ +60 5 3120972. Still making heong pang in the traditional manner in the backyard of their house, and worth a look just to see the masters at work. The biscuits are broiled to a crisp in giant clay jars over a carefully managed coconut husk fire, then cooled and packed into pink translucent bags tied off with a rubber band. They usually last a week before going soft. There's another cottage factory called 189 Heong Peah the next road over on Lorong Gunung Rapat 5 too. RM7 for a packet of ten. (updated Sep 2015)
4.59349101.083812 Yee Hup, 151 Jln Sultan Iskandar, ☏ +60 5 2423200. The family-operated business started at home in the 1980s, before becoming a corporate company pumping out biscuits by the truckload from industrial sized electric ovens. The convenient branch in town usually has varieties not found elsewhere. RM9 for a packet of ten. (updated Sep 2015)
Egg Tarts[edit]
4.594499101.0803053 Hong Kee Confectionery (鸿记饼家), 14, Jalan Dato Onn Jaafar, ☏ +60 17-592 8303. 7AM-2PM, closed on Fridays. Family business famous for their Cantonese-style egg tarts. Come early as possible to avoid disappointments. RM1.6/piece. (updated Jun 2017)

The 4.61379101.11887 Kinta City Shopping Centre and 4.59692101.089738 Ipoh Parade are the two older malls in the city. Both have a fair range of branded stores, with good bargains during sale periods that could be of interest to keen shoppers. AEON has also opened up big shopping malls at 4.54596101.070759 AEON Station 18 and 4.6779101.124410 AEON Ipoh Klebang, the latter of which has the first Uniqlo and H&M stores in Perak.

Eat[edit]
When tin mining died out, food sustained Ipoh and made the city bustle once more. Like everywhere in Malaysia, the local food is dirt cheap and sublime. Loads of people come from all over just to fill their bellies, creating a headache of congestion during weekends. Quite a few locals already avoid the most famous stalls, whether due to dropping standards or the unrelenting crowds. Some specialities to look out for include: chicken and beansprouts (芽菜雞), Ipoh kai see hor fun (怡保鸡丝河粉) and salt-baked chicken (盐锔鸡). Due to its Cantonese-majority population, Ipoh is also a very good place to have dim sum.

Budget[edit]
Early-rising Ipoh loves breakfast and brunch, and has scrumptious treats and coffee to match. Egg tarts are a popular Western-styled dim sum dish that made it off the cart and one can get white coffee (also see #Drink) or soybean milk to wash it down.

Rice noodles[edit]
The rice noodles (sar hor fun or kueytiao) found in Ipoh kai see hor fun and other dishes are particularly light and silky smooth, said to benefit from their preparation in mineral-rich spring water that flows through the limestone hills. Add clear chicken and prawn soup with chicken shreds, prawns and spring onions, and kai see hor fun can be had for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Chu cheong fun is similarly springy and delicious. Popular noodle dishes like yong tau foo and hor hee are also worth a try.

Located next to Kong Heng, one can order food from any hawker in either coffee shop, except for hor fun. (updated Mar 2023)
Food courts and stalls[edit]
There are still many hidden delights outside of the city centre of course, and if you can't quite decide what to eat or want something outside of normal Malaysian fare, there're always food courts which are a little more organised than the traditional coffeeshops.

South Asian[edit]
There's an equally wide South Asian diaspora, evident in the assortment of eateries all specialising in different areas of the subcontinental cuisine, from the Indian Muslim mamaks who serve crispy roti canai and rich nasi kandar to the South Indian curry houses.

Ayam tauge, or chicken and bean sprouts, are a famous Ipoh twist on Hainanese poached chicken and can be paired with plain rice or the ever-popular sar hor fun in soup served with lightly blanched bean sprouts doused in soy sauce and sesame oil. Salt-baked chicken, on the other hand, is a Hakka delicacy which makes full use of free-range kampong chicken, wrapping them in paper and then baking them in large woks filled with heated salt.

One of the most well-known delights of Cantonese cuisine, dim sum for breakfast in Ipoh is not just tasty and reasonably priced, but is a long-held weekend tradition for generations of families here.

Splurge[edit]
Chinese banquet restaurants that serve seafood are a reliable shout for fancier dinners.

Drink[edit]
Ipoh has a small and still growing night scene. Bandar Baru Medan (behind the Kinta City Shopping Centre) has been the usual haunt for supper for the last decade or so, albeit with a large turnover of pubs and bars. The newer nightlife area is around New Town and Greentown, and also the revitalised Lorong Panglima in Old Town, a narrow alley once notoriously known as Concubine Lane, where rich businessmen used to house their mistresses back when the tin mines were booming.

White coffee[edit]
Ipoh white coffee was invented here: to reduce the bitterness of coffee roasted in the European style without adding sugar (as during the roasting of Kopi-O), beans are roasted with palm-oil margarine. The result is a mild tasting kiddies' version of what westerners would call real coffee. A few genuine Chinese coffee shops that sell Ipoh white coffee are located opposite the Kinta Heights flats in the old town.

Sleep[edit]
Hotels in Ipoh tend to be tidily kept yet long faded establishments, but the new energy in the city has sprung up a lot more choices. Bigger hotels will be found in Ipoh New Town, Greentown and also near the theme park in Tambun, while boutique hotels have set up shop in Old Town or big colonial bungalows. There is a cluster of budget hotels around Jalan Ali Pitchay in the new town area just off Jalan Sultan Iskandar.

Stay safe[edit]
Ipoh is in general a very safe city, certainly by international standards. However, there are some irritants like beggars, especially at bus terminals. It is better not to attract any unwanted attention by giving money to the beggars as most of them are professional beggars operated by syndicates.
Perhaps not so much a safety thing per se, but at the Central Market in New Town, particularly if you are an orang putih (white person), don't let the traders rip you off (which they are likely to do, if you let them).  If the prices are signed clearly, hold them to it! Learning how to say "It's too expensive" in Cantonese, Mandarin, or Malay as the case may be, is also very helpful. Furthermore, Ipoh is probably not as tourist-friendly as some publications make it out to be.
The city centre is relatively safe, but again, pickpockets do work in the stations. If you are carrying a bag make sure that it's secured (all zipped up). If you have a wallet in your pocket keep a hand near it while exiting the buses. It is not advisable to leave your handbag dangling on your shoulder while walking next to main roads, as motorcycle snatch thefts do happen.

Cope[edit]
