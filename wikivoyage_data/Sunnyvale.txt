By plane[edit]
San Jose International Airport[edit]
San Jose International Airport is the closest airport.
From the airport, take the free Airport Flyer bus #60 to Santa Clara Transit Station. From there, catch either VTA bus #22 or Caltrain to Sunnyvale. The #22 bus line has many stops in Sunnyvale along El Camino Real, from Lawrence Expressway in the east to Bernardo Avenue in the west. Caltrain stops in Sunnyvale at both the Lawrence station as well as downtown Sunnyvale.
Taxi fare from San Jose Airport to Sunnyvale is approximately $30.

San Francisco International Airport[edit]
San Francisco is just up US 101 and offers additional options for flying in. In particular it offers more international and direct East Coast flights. From the airport, you can take the BART to Millbrae Station and then take the Caltrain to Sunnyvale. CalTrain's Sunnyvale station is next to old downtown, on Evelyn Avenue just West of Murphy Street.

Oakland International Airport[edit]
You can go on Interstate 680 to the Oakland airport. Also, there are flights to domestic destinations, and to Lake Tahoe. You can use BART, or you can use a Uber!

Get around[edit]
By bus[edit]
Sunnyvale has a decent, albeit rarely used public transport system managed by Valley Transportation Authority.
Bus 22 on El Camino Real is the main bus line and most other bus lines run into it.  Bus 522 is an express bus which also travels on El Camino but skips a lot of stops. Additionally, the 55, 54, 53 bus routes serve other areas in Sunnyvale. For trips to Santa Cruz or Scotts Valley the Highway 17 Express is available.

By train[edit]
Caltrain has its Sunnyvale stop in downtown Sunnyvale, and the Lawrence stop at the Lawrence Expressway.
VTA light rail also has several Sunnyvale stops—but note that these do not connect directly with Caltrain.

By bike[edit]
Sunnyvale is a recognized "bike friendly community". Many major roads have bike lanes, and if you get tired of cycling,  the VTA buses, light rail, and Caltrain also allow bikes at all hours.
