Sioux Lookout is a town of about 5,300 people (2016) in Northern Ontario, approximately 350 km (220 mi) northwest of Thunder Bay. The town's name comes from nearby Sioux Mountain, where the native Ojibway people would watch for any oncoming Sioux warriors looking to ambush them.


Understand[edit]
Sioux Lookout train station
Sioux Lookout is best known as a railway town on the Transcontinental Railway - a place where you can get off The Canadian cross-country passenger train and have a smoke.
Urban Sioux Lookout fronts on Pelican Lake, and the municipality undertook a lakefront improvement program to beautify this area. There are now more parks, paths, and other recreational facilities along the lakefront. Many other lakes are easily accessible by car or boat from Sioux Lookout. 
The population explodes during the spring and summer months when seasonal residents arrive. Most of Sioux Lookout's tourism comes from people wanting to experience outdoor activities. Fishing is the main tourist attraction during the summer months due to the access to numerous lakes, such as Lac Seul and Minnitaki Lake.
There are a number of fishing camps in the area that allow access to an extensive lake system fed by the English River. The town is surrounded by several beaches, including Umphreville Park, a historical site that predates the town. During the summer months, Sioux Lookout's population rises as tourists, most of whom are American, arrive to take advantage of the many of lakes and rivers in the area. Experienced guides, employed by the camps, can find the best locations and also provide an educated tour of the unique land known as "sunset country".

History[edit]
Aerial view of Sioux Lookout
Sioux Lookout's name comes from a local mountain and First Nations story. This mountain, known as Sioux Mountain, was used in the late 18th century by Ojibway People to watch for any oncoming Sioux warriors looking to ambush their camp. A careful eye could see the sun shining off the birch of enemy canoes crossing nearby rapids. Women and children could be led away safely while the warriors could intercept the Sioux on the water. Illustrating this old story on the front page of the local newspaper, The Sioux Lookout Bulletin, is an iconic image of a First Nations man, holding a hand above his eyes to scan the waters.
Sioux Lookout was founded a railway town on the Transcontinental Railway. It became an aviation hub for Northern Ontario when gold was discovered in Red Lake; when Sioux Lookout Airport was opened in 1933, it was the second-busiest airport in North America (behind only Chicago). During the Cold War, the town was home to a radar base watching the trans-polar route from the USSR.
Now, the Canadian National Railway is a significant employer, but it and the forest products industry are no longer the largest sectors of the municipality’s diversified economy. Instead, as a service centre for numerous northern First Nations communities, health-care, human and social services, education, and the provincial and federal government are major sources of Sioux Lookout employment. The closure of the lumber mill in Hudson, around the time of the global financial crisis and recession in 2008-09 contributed to significant employment changes and demographic shifts.
