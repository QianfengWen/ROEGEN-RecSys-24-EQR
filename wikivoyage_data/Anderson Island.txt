 Andy's Wildlife Park (just south of Sandberg Road and west of Eckenstam-Johnson Road). This park encompasses 170 acres of wetlands, tidal estuary and a forest. There is an extensive trail system for hikers that is best utilized in the summer months due to wet conditions. The 2-mile looped nature trail begins and ends at a parking lot on Eckenstam-Johnson Road and includes two small bridges. There is a picnic area with at table on the bank of Schoolhouse Creek near the parking area. There is also a portable toilet at the trailhead. 
 Andrew Anderson Marine Park (accessible only by trail from a trailhead and parking area located on Clausen Road or by water). The core of the park was the gift of Andrew Anderson (1895-1975), a true visionary concerned with the preservation of the way of life we cherish on our island. The partially looped trail winds through a heavily wooded area with many native plants and trees. It includes enormous Douglas firs, featuring gorgeous views and ends at a beautiful tidal inlet that is a salmon nursery area and includes a 3/4 mile public beach with driftwood, shells, rocks and aquatic life.
