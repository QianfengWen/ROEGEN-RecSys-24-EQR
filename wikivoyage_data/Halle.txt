For other places with the same name, see Halle (disambiguation).


Halle is the largest city in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany with a population of 233,700. Located on the river Saale, it is often referred to as Halle an der Saale, or Halle (Saale) for short, to distinguish it from other municipalities in Germany sharing the same name.
Halle has always been an important industrial centre - its industrial heritage spans salt mining, chemical industries and chocolate confectionery. Internationally, Halle is perhaps best known as the birthplace of the Baroque composer Georg Friedrich Händel, who later went on to a successful career in London.


Understand[edit]
Halle owes its existence to brine springs: salt has been produced in the region since the Bronze Age. The name Halle probably stems from the boiling "hall" of the salt works. The oldest document mentioning "Halla" dates from 806 AD. From the 10th to 17th century, Halle belonged to the Archbishopric of Magdeburg, temporarily serving as the second residence of the Prince-Archbishop, who was both religious leader and political ruler of the territory. An important trade centre, Halle was a member of the Hanseatic League during the late Middle Ages. After the Protestant Reformation, the Archbishopric became the secular Duchy of Magdeburg before being merged into the Kingdom of Prussia. 
Baroque composer George Frideric Handel was born in Halle in 1685 but moved to Hamburg at age 18 and later became famous in London. With its university (founded in 1694) and August Hermann Francke's Foundations (since 1698), Halle was an educational centre during the Age of Enlightenment. Thanks to its university, the picturesque landscape of the Saale valley and ruined castles in the surroundings, Halle was a place-to-go for Romantic poets of the early 19th century, namely Joseph von Eichendorff who studied in Halle and composed numerous poems during his rambles. The composer Johann Friedrich Reichardt's garden near Giebichenstein castle was considered the "shelter of Romanticism".
The city was connected to the Leipzig–Magdeburg railroad in 1840. Halle soon became an industrial centre with notable chocolate, chemical and rail vehicle construction plants. During the communist rule, an extensive new town, Halle-Neustadt (colloquially Ha-Neu, homophonous with Hanoi), was built west of the city. It was declared an independent city in 1967 and was home to more than 90,000 inhabitants, mostly workers of the chemical plants, at its peak in 1980. It was reunited with Halle proper in 1990. One of Halle's most famous sons is the politician Hans-Dietrich Genscher (1927–2016) who moved to West Germany during the country's partition, becoming foreign minister and leader of the liberal FDP. Halle's chemical industries broke down after the German reunification, leading to a massive loss of jobs but also to a recovery of the terribly polluted environment. New jobs were created in the service sector, science and technology. Halle is the seat of the German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina and many startups. While separated by a state border since 1990, Halle and Leipzig are closely integrated with one another, sharing an S-Bahn system and an airport and many commuters move between the two or from suburbs of one to the other.
