Hat Yai (หาดใหญ่; also Hatyai, Had Yai, Haad Yai) is the fifth largest city in Thailand, the largest city in southern Thailand, and is in Songkhla Province on the Southern Gulf Coast. It's a popular tourist spot for Singaporeans, Indonesians, and especially Malaysians, as well as for Thais from neighbouring provinces. It's best avoided if you are looking to get off the beaten path. Prices are relatively high in tourist areas. This place has comparatively few Western visitors. The city can be a stop for tourists on a journey to Southern Thailand's beaches and islands (such as Ko Lipe), or further south to Malaysia and Singapore.


Understand[edit]
Hat Yai used to be a small village known as Khok Sa-Met Choon. Its population has been growing since the railway station was built in 1924, which made it an important rail junction between southern Thailand and Malaysia.
Today, Hat Yai is the biggest city in southern Thailand. The population is around 157,000 in the city in 2019, and over 400,000 in the whole Hat Yai District. Hat Yai is bigger than the provincial capital of Mueang Songkhla, which is unusual for a Thai province. This means that Hat Yai is often mistaken as the capital of Songkhla province. It is 60 km from the Thailand-Malaysia border at Dannok and Padang Besar in Sadao district. Hat Yai has become a centre for business, education, transportation, tourism, and shopping in south Thailand due to the well-established connections by road, rail, and air. The city has been a melange of Thais, Chinese, and Malays for generations. Trade, manufacturing, and tourism contribute much to the city's economic prosperity.
The Southern Thai dialect is prominent, although Central Thai is used in offices and schools. Many older Thai-Chinese can speak a Chinese dialect called Teochew, while the Pattani Malay dialect, which is similar to the dialect of Malay spoken in Kelantan, is spoken by many of the ethnic Malays. English is spoken by some younger people.

If you are in Malaysia it is advisable to book this train on-line directly at SRT website as KTMB (Malaysian railways) does not sell ticket for this train.

Map of Hat Yai
The city centre itself is quite compact and covers three parallel roads: Nipatuthit (นิพัทธ์อุทิศ) 1, 2 and 3 Rd, colloquially called Soi Nueng (ซอยหนี่ง, lit. "road one"), Soi Song (ซอยสอง, lit. "road two") and Soi Saam (ซอยสาม, lit. "road three"). It is practical to get around on foot, but getting to most attractions will require some kind of transportation.

Events and festivals[edit]

 Hat Yai Midnight Songkran (เทศกาลสงกรานต์หาดใหญ่). The festival marks Thai New Year, which is traditionally celebrated during 13-15 Apr. The most prominent part of the festival is blessing people with sprinkles of water. As you can guess, this devolves into massive water fights. The main activities are held near/around Odean Shopping Mall and Lee Garden Plaza, including foam party, free concert, and Songkran beauty contest. 
 Hat Yai Vegetarian Festival (เทศกาลกินเจหาดใหญ่; Nine Emperor Gods Festival). A yearly event held during the ninth month of the Chinese calendar (usually in October). Observed mostly by Chinese and, increasingly, some Thais. 
 Loi Krathong (วันลอยกระทง). Festival to pay respect to the river by floating beautifully decorated krathong (กระทง). It usually incorporates a Nang Noppamas (นางนพมาศ) beauty competition where contestants dress in Thai traditional costume. The festival is held on the full moon night of the twelfth lunar month. 
 Tham Bun Duean Sip (เทศกาลทำบุญเดือนสิบ). A Southern Thai tradition held in/around October (the full-moon day of the tenth lunar month). The main purpose is to make merit for their ancestors. There are specific foods made for this. Business may close for the day. 
Do[edit]
 Cinema. Movie tickets in Thailand are more affordable than in Western countries. There are multiplexes and an IMAX theatre at Hatyai Cineplex on 5F of CentralFestival. The other venue is at Diana Cineplex on 5F of Diana. From 140 baht for a film. 
 Thai Massage. No trip to Thailand would be complete without a Thai massage and Hat Yai is one of the best places to get one. Some of the many good places would be Garden Home Hotel or Hat Yai Central Hotel. The rooms are nicely decorated and provide a soothing environment to go with a good massage. Ask the doorman at any good hotel for a recommendation if you want to avoid the more dodgy places.

Although not in the same league as Bangkok, there are a lot of different food options on offer in Hat Yai. Typical Thai street food is abundant. Big international chain restaurants have branches in town offering Japanese and Western food.
Restaurant chains are located mostly in shopping malls. International restaurant chains such as KFC, McDonald's, Sizzler, Pizza Hut, Dunkin' Donuts, Mister Donut, Swensen's, Dairy Queen, Starbucks. Local restaurant chains such as MK Restaurant (Thai-style sukiyaki), S&P, Black Canyon Coffee, Chester's Grill, The Pizza Company, Fuji Restaurant, Shabushi , Oishi Ramen. Food courts are also available in most of the shopping malls.
Owing to the ethnic diversity, you can find Thai, Chinese, and Malay (Muslim) food available throughout the city. Most restaurants offer a variety of Thai, Chinese and/or Western fusion cuisine.
Ethnic Chinese from Malaysia and Singapore make up the bulk of Hat Yai's tourists so many restaurants and hotels cater primarily to them. Just opposite Lee Gardens (next to the Regency Hotel) you will see a restaurant which spit-roasts suckling pigs every day. Large, open-air seafood restaurants are also popular with Chinese visitors and the quality of seafood available in Hat Yai is good. Some Chinese are vegetarians and the town has a good selection of small vegetarian restaurants that offer tofu and soy meat substitutes.
There is a large resident Muslim population and some visitors from Malaysia are also Muslim so finding halal food isn't a problem.
Food hawkers can be found all over the city. Some stay open until very late at night. Grabbing a bite in late night is not uncommon. A spot for a variety of night hawkers is at Suphasarnrangsan Rd around Wat Cheu Chang near Kim Yong Market. Other places are such as at Tanrattanakorn Rd called Talad Mai (ตลาดใหม่) and at Thung Sao 1 Rd. There are also a number of small roadside places to eat on Nipha Phakdi alley behind the Florida hotel.
A typical meal for one can start at as low as 50 baht for street food, 80 baht in general restaurants, and 120 baht in more upscale restaurants.

Travel agents around town can nearly always give better rates for hotel rooms compared to dealing directly with the hotel. Hat Yai has an abundance of accommodation. Tourism in Hat Yai consists mainly of the weekend trade from Malaysia and Singapore. Accommodation can be found very easily mid-week but hotels in the centre of town tend to get booked up for the weekends and Malaysian and Singaporean public holidays. In the budget hotel you may well be asked if you want company. A shake of the head is all that is needed (up or down or from side-to-side is up to you). Don't be put off by the hotel because of it.

Stay safe[edit]
A series of bombings from 2006 to 2012 that specifically targeted restaurants and shopping centres popular with visitors (and locals) killed two tourists. Strict security measures (bag searches, metal detectors) are to be expected in most gathering places. As of October 2022 the town is no more dangerous than any other major city in Thailand.

Visa run[edit]
If you need to extend your stay in Thailand for another 15 days, you can cross the border at Dannok, near Sadao. Getting there from the airport is easy and takes about 2 hours. From the terminal, walk straight out into the parking lot to the parking lot ring road. You can wait here for a light blue songthaew to take you into town and get dropped off at The Plaza for 13 baht. The ride takes about 20-30 minutes. You can also take an airport taxi into town. At The Plaza, you can find a van waiting just across from the TOT office, which makes regular trips to Dannok. If you can't find it, just say "Sadao" or "Dannok" to people till they point you the right way. The trip is 60 baht, and vans leave once they are full. The trip should take about 1 hour 30 minutes. It will drop you off near the border at Dannok and you can just walk to exit Thailand. You will be approached by motorcycle drivers who will offer to take you to the Malaysian side. Walking takes about 10 minutes, so it could be worth it to pay 20 baht each way if you are in a hurry. If you have time, a stop at the duty-free shop is worthwhile. Minivans returning to Hat Yai depart from outside the 7-Eleven in Dannok. Back-to back stamps are only allowed for a total stay of 90 days within any given 180 day period of time.
