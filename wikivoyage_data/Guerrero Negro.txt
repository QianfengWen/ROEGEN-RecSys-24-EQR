Guerrero Negro is a city of 14,000 people (2015) in Baja California Sur, on the edge of the Vizcaino Desert just south of the state border about halfway down the peninsula.  It is best known for the whale watching, although its primary industry is salt. The entire Vizcaino region is a protected biosphere called the El Vizcaíno Biosphere Reserve. The protected area includes the entire Vizcaino desert, the entire Sierra San Francisco mountain range, the Pacific coast lagoons where the grey whales reproduce, and the beaches and islands on the Sea of Cortes. Guerrero Negro is the best "home base" for visiting those sensitive environmental areas.


Get in[edit]
The easiest and more comfortable way is by plane: there is a company that flies from Ensenada to Guerrero Negro on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday at 11:30, it makes a stop at Isla de Cedros.  The company is Aeroservicios Guerrero, and the phone number is +52 615 157 01 37.
To get to Ensenada you may fly to San Diego and take the bus at the station that is just across the border in Tijuana.  There is also a bus that leaves from the airport in Tijuana each hour since 08:30 and it arrives to Ensenada two hours later.
Other way is to rent a car in Tijuana and make the 12-hour drive, it is a long drive but it is worth the trip, and it is cheaper if you are two or more people.
The last way is to take a bus from Tijuana Central Station to Guerrero Negro it leaves at 12:15, 16:00 and 18:00 and it takes about 12 hours to get to Guerrero.
You can also fly to Los Cabos and to rent a car there or to take a bus to La Paz and from La Paz to Guerrero Negro (12 hours from La Paz) and it leaves at 10:00, 16:00 and 23:00.

Get around[edit]
Walking or taxi is the easiest way to get around in town. You'll want to hire a boat to explore the lagoons of Ojo de Liebre.
The lagoon complex of Ojo de Liebre has been recognized as a wetland of international importance by the Ramsar Convention and as a Hemispheric Importance Site for shore birds conservation so bird watching is a must. It is a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve.
You can also visit the sand dunes around Guerrero Negro. There are guided visits to the largest open salt company, to the rock paintings at San Francisco and Santa Marta Sierras, and to the less well-known paintings of Mesa del Carmen, north from Guerrero Negro.
