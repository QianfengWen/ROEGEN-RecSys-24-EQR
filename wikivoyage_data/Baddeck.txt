Baddeck is a pleasant little village of 800 people (2011) on the shore of Bras d'Or Lake in Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia.  It's a popular spot for boating in the summer and its central location makes it convenient as a base for exploring the island.


Understand[edit]
The Kidston Island Lighthouse which also appears on the village seal
According to some historians, the name Baddeck is derived from the Mi'kmaq term abadak which has been translated as "place with an island near" (in reference to Kidston Island, immediately offshore).
Today, Baddeck functions as a service centre for the sparsely populated county.
Baddeck became a tourist destination with the 1874 publication of "Baddeck, And That Sort of Thing", a travel story written by Charles Dudley Warner. Tourism grew even more following the construction of the Cabot Trail in 1932, with Baddeck being at the start and end of the loop. While the village population is just over 700 people, local hotels feature over 600 rooms. 

Get in[edit]
Baddeck is on Highway 105 (Trans-Canada Highway) about halfway between the causeway to the mainland and Sydney.  It is about a five hour drive from Halifax.
