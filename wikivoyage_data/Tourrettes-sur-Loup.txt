Buy[edit]
Eat[edit]
Tourrettes has the best ice cream in the region.

Baccanales, 21, Grand Rue, 04 93 24 19 19. One of the better restaurants in the region. Christophe Dufau left the Auberge de Tourrettes in 2004 to start his own small "bistrot gourmet" in the tiny back streets of Tourettes. The menu is very limited, often with no choice at all, but the cooking is top class and often inventive. €24-€70
 Le Relais des Coches, 28 Route de Vence, 06140, Tourrettes Sur Loup, ☏ +33 4 93 24 30 24. A restaurant that can talk the talk and walk the walk. This family run establishment is on the outskirts of the village in picturesque surroundings. The owner/restaurateur, Wayne, is extremely welcoming as are all of his staff (many of whom are family). The menu is small but well chosen to suite all tastes. Whilst the service is friendly the food is exceptional. Perfectly cooked and well executed the food lacks for nothing. The desserts to finish are good but the Irish coffees are divine. Over the weekend there is live Jazz but impromptu session can happen at any point. Book if you can but extra seating with a great view is available outside. If in the area this place should not be avoided!.
