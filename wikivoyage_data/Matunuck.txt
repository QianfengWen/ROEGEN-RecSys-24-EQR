Matunuck is one of the villages of South Kingstown in Washington County, Rhode Island. The village's name is from a Native American word meaning "look out." The Narragansett tribe made a summer encampment at this location before the land was sold to colonists as part of the Pettaquamscutt purchase. It is mostly a summer community in Southern Rhode Island with a small, but strong base of year round locals.


Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Matunuck is right off the highway, making it easy to get to by car. The Matunuck Beach Road exit is off of US Route 1 North, with convenient left lane U-turns for south-bound motorists.

By boat[edit]
Matunuck has no marinas or ports, making it inaccessible directly by boat. However, there is some dockage in Matunuck located behind several houses that border Potters Pond on the east most side of Matunuck. Its neighbor, East Matunuck, has several legitimate marinas and docking areas.

Get around[edit]
Matunuck is such a small area that motorized transportation is not really a necessity to move within it. Most places are easily within comfortable walking distance. However a bike, or if you're adventurous, a skateboard would easily be the best option to navigating Matunuck.
