Holland is a city of about 30,000 in West Michigan, on the shore of Lake Michigan.


Understand[edit]
It is best known locally for its popular beaches and more widely for its Dutch immigrant heritage, showcased each spring in Tulip Time, a festival featuring countless flowers lining the city's streets.

Buy[edit]
Downtown Holland, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, includes eight blocks of more than 100 shops and restaurants housed in Victorian buildings. The sidewalks are heated by underground hot-water pipes, making shopping a pleasant experience even in winter. Most shops are open until 9PM during the week.
Two characteristically Dutch handicrafts can be purchased at the DeKlomp Wooden Shoe and Delft Factory, 12755 Quincy Avenue, the only factory of its kind in the United States. You can watch the artists producing both delftware, a traditional blue-and-white pottery originally produced around the town of Delft in the Netherlands, and wooden shoes, on machines that were imported from the Netherlands.

Eat[edit]
When visiting a town that emphasizes its Dutch heritage, you may naturally wish to sample some Dutch food. Perhaps unfortunately, there aren't a lot of restaurants that capitalize on this interest. The only one with a relatively broad selection of Dutch food is the Hungry Dutchman Cafe in the Dutch Village theme park; be aware, however, that it isn't open year-round, so if you visit outside the tourist season, you may be out of luck.
There are several places in town where you can purchase Dutch confections, including the acquired taste of double-salt (dubbel zoute) licorice.
