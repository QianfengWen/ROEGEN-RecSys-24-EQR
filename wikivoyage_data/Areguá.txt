Areguá is a town 31 km outside of Asunción in Paraguay.


Understand[edit]
Areguá is easily accessible by many paved roads and public bus lines. It contains many historic and natural attractions that make it a great weekend getaway. In August and September they hold a strawberry festival.

Get in[edit]
By bus[edit]
Take any bus line in Asunción going to "Shopping del Sol" - it will say so on the windscreen. Line 28 and 30 both go there from Cerro Corá road. Get off at Shopping del Sol and board any bus saying "Areguá" on the screen. Buses cost Gs.2,200. Get off after you see the ceramics stores on either side of the street (can't miss them). You are in the centre (and close to the Tourist office (Casona de SENATUR) on 515 Nstr. Señora de la Candelaria c/ Mcal. Estigarribia).
Some buses that pass to neighboring towns such as Ypacarai and Itaguá also pass through Areguá. Main bus lines that go through Areguá include No. 111 Aregueña, the No. 11 San Augustine, and the No. 56 Cerro Koi. Make sure to ask the bus driver if they go into the center of town (el centro), instead of the outlying rural areas (las companias).

By car[edit]
Areguá is accessible from Ruta 2, going east outside of Asunción. When you get to the Colegio Militar Mcal. Francisco Solano Lopez outside of the centre of Capiatá, turn left at the stop light on km 27 marker, and follow the road called Ruta Areguá until you reach the town centre.

Get around[edit]
The town is pretty compact - best to go by foot. Distances are short. On one end (right, uphill from the centre) there's the church on the hill overlooking the town, on the other end is the beach and the lake.

See[edit]
Cerro Koi
-25.31328-57.3854631 Iglesia de La Candelaria (La Candelaria Church). 
-25.312781-57.3858212 Colonial style houses throughout the town. 
-25.304583-57.3826753 Casa Amarilla (Yellow House). Part art gallery, part antique store and part hostel. This was once part of Mariscal Lopez's Areguá estate. Eccentric and fascinating. Doesn't look like much from outside - don't be put off. 
-25.324054-57.3986434 Cerro Koi (Cerro Coi). Daily 08:00-16:00. Exceptional rock formations from volcanic activity. It is said that the rock type on this hill can only be found in 2 other places in the world (South Africa and Canada), but also north of Dublin (Ireland) at the coast you will find similar rock formations created by volcanic activity. In addition, it has a good view of the town and lake Ypacaraí. Free.   
Do[edit]
Nowadays, the lake is polluted by factories, and swimming and eating fish here is not possible anymore. You can tell from the color of the lake's water that it is far from OK.

-25.302202-57.3737791 Areguá Beach (Balneario municipal). Swimming is not recommended, due to the pollution of the lake. 
The town is a nice and relaxing treat from the hectic Asunción, with beautiful colonial buildings.
