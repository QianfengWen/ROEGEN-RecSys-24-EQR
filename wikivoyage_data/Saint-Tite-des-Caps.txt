Saint-Tite-des-Caps is a municipality of the La Côte-de-Beaupré Regional County Municipality, in Charlevoix, in Quebec. This article also covers Sault-au-Cochon.
Being located between two internationally renowned ski resorts (Mont-Saint-Anne and the Massif de Charlevoix), Saint-Tite-des-Caps is an essential stopover for visiting Charlevoix and the North Shore of the St. Lawrence River. The famous Sentiers des Caps attracts tens of thousands of visitors every year. The local economy is mainly based on forestry, agriculture, recreational tourism activities (resorts, hiking, snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, snowmobiling, etc.). The natural attractions of the forest, mountains and viewpoints overlooking the river give a unique cachet to this picturesque locality.


Understand[edit]
In addition to the main village, this locality includes the hamlets of Lombrette, Domaine Crépault, Les Chenaux and Saint-Léon (along the Sainte-Anne River). The vast majority of residents live in the main village or along Route 138, which runs along the north shore of the St. Lawrence River.
The Sault-au-Cochon unorganized territory offers recreational tourism activities (hiking, snowshoeing, observation of nature, flora and fauna). The Sentier des Caps is a must. The Sault-au-Cochon air tragedy on September 9, 1949, killed 23 people. A Canadian Pacific Airlines DC-3 plane (flying Montreal-Baie-Comeau) exploded in midair 104.6 km (65.0 mi) east of downtown Quebec City and crashed on the north shore of the St. Lawrence River at Sault-au-Cochon. This air tragedy is the result of the first attack to occur against civil aviation in North America. A bomb had been concealed in a package which was placed on board the plane before its departure. In 2019, the debris was still there, 70 years later; they lie on the mountainside 150 m above the level of the St. Lawrence River.
