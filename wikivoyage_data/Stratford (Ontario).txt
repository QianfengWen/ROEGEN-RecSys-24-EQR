Stratford City Hall at 1 Wellington Street
Stratford is a town in Southwestern Ontario that is internationally known for the Stratford Shakespeare Festival, acclaimed for its presentation of Shakespearean, classical and musical theatre. In 2021, it was home to 33,000 people.


Understand[edit]
Before European settlement, many Indigenous groups called this land home: the Anishinaabe, Attiwonderonk (Neutral) and Haudenosaunee peoples. 
Stratford is the seat of Perth County, which was settled by English, Irish, Scottish and German immigrants, in almost equal numbers, starting in the 1820s but primarily in the 1830s and 1840s. Most became farmers. Today, the area around Stratford is known for mixed farming, dairying and hog production.
Stratford is known as the hometown of musicians Loreena McKennitt and Justin Bieber.
