By taxi[edit]
If you want to take the taxi, it will take you in a short time - about 5-10 minutes - anywhere in town you like. If you want, you can take the taxi outside the town, but it is more expensive. There are many taxi hubs, in the city centre there is one directly across the theater, another one in front of Sugas department store.

By car[edit]
Due to the size of the city, it doesn't make much sense to use a car. Parking in the center can be problematic and relative expensive (3 lei/hr). Traffic is not bad, except a few minutes in the morning and afternoon in certain places, mostly around schools. Just walk or if you are in hurry or have to travel from one end to the other, use a taxi.
There are a few local car rental offices, but there are no multinational, big rental companies in the city. See at Mida[dead link] (pages only in Romanian).

The area has almost 40 species of endemic orchids that can be seen. If you wish to see them, contact the Romanian Orchid Lovers Club[dead link], based in Rasnov 20 km from Brasov.
