Understand[edit]
4th Av
Built in the Ohio River Valley and surrounded by lush steep hills, West Virginia's second-largest city (and at one time its largest), Huntington, is historically a town of railroads and industry, and to this day its port on the Ohio River is one of the busiest inland ports in the country. Home to Marshall University, the second-largest in the state of West Virginia, Huntington has a distinctive college-town atmosphere, and its tree-lined streets are lined with stately old homes with large, wide front porches. Although in a hilly region, and containing many hilly portions, the center of Huntington and many of its neighborhoods are built on the wide floodplain of the Ohio River, making parts of Huntington uniquely flat for a city in West Virginia.
Huntington is a planned city; the oldest and flattest parts of the city are built on a planned numbered grid platted on the flat Ohio River floodplain. The city grew quickly its first few decades as a river port at the terminus of the C&O Railroad and many of the city's cultural and architectural assets come from the regional prosperity of the gilded age and the influence of the city beautiful movement, notably an impressive park system for a city of its size which includes a chain of parks along the Washington Blvd/North Blvd. greenway corridor.

Ritter Park Historic District
Huntington's smaller twin-city of Ashland, Kentucky is 20 minutes drive west, downriver. The Huntington-Ashland metropolitan area has a combined population of 360,000 in 2020. I-64 skirts around the Huntington city center through more suburban areas to the south, a routing which prevented Huntington's historic center from seeing the large-scale destruction typically associated with inner-city highway construction. West Virginia's capital city, Charleston, is less than an hour east on I-64, and the suburbs of both cities have been growing towards each other for many decades, resulting in a near-continuous metropolitan area between the two cities. With a combined population of around 620,000 (2020); the Huntington-Charleston combined metropolitan area is the largest urban area for several hours in every direction.

Downtown from Ohio
Generally off the tourist radar, prices for lodging and restaurants in Huntington are generally more affordable than larger and more tourist-oriented cities and towns.
Within a 2-hour radius of Huntington are many outdoor scenic recreational attractions including: New River Gorge National Park and Preserve, Ohio's famous Hocking Hills State Park, and Kentucky's Carter Caves and Red River Gorge as well as several man-made lakes.
In 2008, Huntington earned the dubious distinction of being named the "fattest and most unhealthy" city in the United States, based on 2006 data showing that 46% of adults were obese. Over the following  decade, Huntington's obesity rate fell by 13 percentage points to 33%. It is no longer the fattest city in America, or even in West Virginia.
Men and women working in manual jobs that predominated through the 20th century required a lot of caloric energy in their diet. The traditional Appalachian diet of foods that were buttered, salted and fried served that purpose for most of the 20th century. But when those physical jobs were replaced by lower-energy ones by the end of the century, the eating habits stayed the same, resulting in a sharp increase in adult obesity from the 1990s forward. The civic shaming that resulted from the 2008 designation, which included a visit from British celebrity chef Jamie Oliver, led to a number of strategies aimed at helping its citizens lose weight. The efforts included a challenge for area residents to collectively "walk to the moon", hospital programs focused on helping children lose weight, and a new local farmers market. The focus on children led to families becoming involved.

Get around[edit]
East Huntington Bridge
Despite its reputation as America's unhealthiest city, downtown Huntington is surprisingly walkable; both bus and train stations are downtown, along with two hotels and several services and attractions.
Easy to navigate, central Huntington is laid out on a planned grid, numbered avenues run east-west and increase south of the river, numbered streets run north-south and increase in number east of 1st St. West of 1st St, numbered streets increase in number heading west, and carry a 'W' designation at the end (as in 14th St W), and avenues are names of presidents. The street grid dissolves as one goes into hillier neighborhoods in the south of the city. 

Robert C Byrd Bridge
Huntington is bisected by railroad tracks. To go north-south or south-north, drivers must use underpasses or bridges at: Spring Valley Dr. Vernon, W 14th, 1st, 8th, 10th Sts, Hal Greer Blvd, 20th, 29th, and 31st. Sts. Additionally, U.S. Route 60 splits into two east-to-west one-way streets (3rd and 5th Ave.; and Washington and Adams Ave. in the West End)
Crossing the Ohio River to and from Ohio can be done on three bridges in the city: the East End Bridge off 31st St in Highlawn, the Robert C Byrd Bridge off 6th and 5th Sts and Veterans Memorial Blvd. downtown, and the West End Bridge on US-52 in the West End. There are two additional bridges downriver, one in downtown Ashland and one downstream connecting to Ironton, Ohio. There are no bridges crossing the Ohio River upstream after the East End Bridge for almost an hour's drive until Point Pleasant/Gallipolis.
Despite the walkability of the city core, the surrounding metropolitan area is very spread-out and a car is necessary to reach some destinations, or to travel between suburbs.

By bus[edit]
The Transit Authority, ☏ +1 304-529-RIDE (7433). Buses generally run on the hour between 6AM and 6PM, though there is limited service available in the evening. TTA also runs along U.S. Route 60 to Barboursville and Milton.
By taxi or rideshare[edit]
Yellow Cab, ☏ +1 304-529-7131. Taxi service in Huntington is terrible. Rides dialed frequently take over an hour to arrive, especially late at night. Sometimes the drivers don't even show up. Keep this in mind while planning any travel in town.
Uber and Lyft: The city is covered by both ridesharing services, letting you avoid Yellow Cab entirely.
By bicycle[edit]
Downtown Huntington is reasonably flat and bicycle friendly. As part of their Old Main Corridor project, the city has added bike lanes that run from 4th Ave. & 16th St. to Pullman Square. State law requires all riders wear helmets but is rarely enforced by the city or campus police. Make sure to wear a helmet to protect your skull and internal brain organ if you get hit by a car or go too fast and hit a bump though.

On foot[edit]
With its several pubs, restaurants, and shops, the downtown area between Marshall University and the Civic Arena/Riverfront is ideal for walking. A walking tour map is available from the Cabell-Huntington CVB and Herald-Dispatch.

Connect[edit]
38.419937-82.4436635 Cabell County Public Library, 455 Ninth St.   (updated Nov 2018)
By phone[edit]
Most West Virginia telephone numbers consist of +1 304 plus a seven-digit number, but the state is now served by an overlay complex of two area codes, with +1 681 as the second. A local or in-state telephone call now requires all ten digits of the local number be dialed (omitting just the leading +1 from a local landline call).
Signage on many established businesses may still display the original seven-digit numbers; dial 304 before these if no area code is indicated.

Stay safe[edit]
While generally safe for visitors and residents, Huntington has a moderate crime level, so general street smarts are advised. Dance club shootings have occurred from time to time in the past, so avoid confrontations in those places. That said, the city government has made efforts to close disreputable drinking establishments where these events have repeatedly occurred, making gun violence noticeably less common than in years past. It is best advised to walk at night with a group, especially if unfamiliar with the surroundings. 
A regional drug epidemic was supercharged by the nationwide opioid epidemic, so it is not unheard of to see exposed needles on the ground in the most affected neighborhoods. Tread carefully and watch your footsteps, as you don't know what pathogens could be transferred from the needles; care should be taken for pets to do the same.
Many homeless people can be found in Huntington and will often beg or panhandle. A common scam is a man asking for money for gas, with his family stuck at the station or down the road. Simply say no; even if they're persistent, they'll eventually leave you alone. Incidents of homeless people becoming aggressive or robbing people are rare.
