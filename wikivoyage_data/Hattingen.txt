Hattingen is a city in Ruhr. It is known for its medieval core and abandoned steel mill. It has a population of about 54,000 (2020). The city focuses on tourism, with the former steel works becoming a museum and the historic old town drawing in tourists, but not yet being overrun.    


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
Christmas market on Untermarkt square in the historic city centre
Hattingen was first mentioned in 990 as Hatneggen, followed by the founding of the town in 1396. In 1554 the town was recognised by the Hanseatic League, and its location helped the textile trade to flourish. After some run-ins with the French and Swedes, the town continued to grow steadily. Following the establishing of the Henrichshütte steelworks in 1854, Hattingen started booming rapidly. World War II meant massive support for the regime and also becoming an important air raid target. After heavy damage the historic town was rebuild but neglected in the post-war period, though public resistance meant only parts of it were demolished in the 1970s. Despite large protests, increasing competition and a bad location caused the closure of the steelworks from 1987 on, causing the loss of almost 10,000 workers and leaving a massive scar to this day. 
The city had managed the transition to service industry better. The historic old town was threatened with demolition in the post-war period, but this was largely prevented, besides the southern part of the core, where a large supermarket now stands. Walking around gives you a good taste of how a typical small German city centre (before bombs and concrete boxes) looked like. Several festivals throughout the year invite locals and visitors alike, with the historic Christmas market from the end of November to Christmas as the highlight, drawing people from near and far. 

Geography[edit]
Hattingen is a collection of settlements in a hilly area, with the Ruhr River running through the north of it, near the city centre. 
The centre of the historic core is St Georg's Church. Heggerstraße is the main shopping street and slowly rises up in elevation from the plateau of Hattingen Mitte as you go north. 
In clockwise-order the smaller settlements are:

Welper, a garden suburb featuring a lot of greenery. Originally build for the workers and their families of the nearby steelworks. Stores and eateries can be found along "Marxstraße" and "Thingstraße".
Blankenstein village near the castle
Blankenstein, small and formerly an independent town before 1971, it offers Burg Blankenstein, a small core with historic buildings and a great vista over the Ruhr Valley.
Holthausen, a suburb developed in multiple stages since the 1960s, not much of touristic worth can be found here, location of rehabilitation clinic.
Bredenscheid, small village, lies on cycle path to Wuppertal. Accommodation, two eateries and a 'Sparkasse' ATM can be found here. South of it mostly nature.
Niederstüter, small settlements between natural areas, great area for walks and hikes. 'Wodantal' valley is a popular road for motorbikes on weekends.
Elfringhausen, basically the same as Niederstüter but to the west, focused along 'Felderbachstraße' road. No public transport lines serve it directly.
Niederbonsfeld, private single-family houses between horse stables and fields. No facilities except petrol station on "Kohlenstraße", near the south end of "Tippelstraße"
Niederwenigern, more affluent town above the Ruhr Valley, large catholic cathedral and hospital, shops of daily needs along "Essener Straße"
Winz-Baak, another 1960s era suburb, mix of single- and multifamily buildings, above Ruhr meadows.
Rauendahl, similar to Winz-Baak but with more diverse population. An 'Aldi' market and a couple shops for daily needs can be found at the entry to the neighbourhood.
Neighbouring towns are Bochum, Witten, Sprockhövel, Wuppertal, Velbert and Essen.

See[edit]
Timberframe houses and alleys
The main attraction of Hattingen is its medieval city centre. Despite wars and post-war neglect you can still experience the stereotypical alleys surrounded by timber-frame houses here. During Christmas season the city is especially charming. The other major attraction is the old blast furnace of the local closed steelworks which has been turned into a museum and mostly left in its original state but also houses exhibitions and an annual meet up for Mercedes fans in summer. Both the city and blast furnace can be experienced on your own or with a tour guide in a couple of hours.

Public wifi is spotty but available, as alternative the McDonald's (Kreisstr. 29a), west of the centre, offers free wifi. During its opening hours the 51.397877.181213 Hattingen Public Library (open M Tu Th F 10:00-18:00, Sa 10:00-14:00) on the 3rd floor of the Reschop-Carree has wifi and public PCs against a small fee.

Newspaper[edit]
The two local and regional papers are Stadtspiegel and WAZ, which won't be of great use if you don't speak german. The former one has birth and death announcements in it.
For international news you'll have to use the internet like normal people or make use of the book store at Essen central station.
