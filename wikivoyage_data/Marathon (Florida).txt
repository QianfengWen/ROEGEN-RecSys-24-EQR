Marathon is a city in Florida located in the Florida Keys, with the Atlantic Ocean on one side and the Gulf of Mexico and Florida Bay on the other. It is on somewhat of a long narrow island (Vaca Key). You will find all of the amenities of a small town including an excellent hospital, shopping and small airport. Mosquitos are less common than in some parts of the Keys, as they spray them. The waters are warm, clear and inviting. If you are visiting the Florida Keys, Marathon is a great choice to make your base. Marathon has more of a permanent population than some of the other Keys and a good base of services.

The local airport supports general aviation with a 5000-ft runway.  There is no scheduled air service to Marathon.
There is a seaplane base on Marathon Key. Travelers who fly commercially will typically fly into Fort Lauderdale or Miami, and drive the rest of the distance (2-3 hours depending on traffic) to Marathon. Key West Airport, located one hour south down US 1, hosts several commercial airlines.

Boaters can reach Marathon on the Atlantic side of the Keys or Florida Bay on the Gulf of Mexico side. Specially-marked Intracoastal Waterway takes you as far as Long Key. Numerous marinas are waiting, but make reservations ahead.

Get around[edit]
The best way to get around is to rent a car.  The many attractions are not close together and public transportation is scarce and can be inconvenient and costly with families.  The island is flat and lends itself well to a bicycle. Although there are few beach areas, the area is loaded with marinas catering to most water sports. Charters are available for all activities.
When driving near the southwest end of the Key, be aware that once you pass Knights Key Blvd, you begin crossing the Seven Mile Bridge, and there is no place to turn around for about 7 miles. Missing your turn can therefore mean a 14-mile detour!

Do[edit]
Snorkeling[edit]

Through this company, it is $30 for an adult to snorkel and children under 5 are free with a paid adult.  If you are not into snorkeling, you can still go out on the boat and enjoy the views from the deck and chat up with the boat crew.  Coolers are allowed for lunch or snacks as they are not provided for you.  Reservations can be made by calling ☏ +1 305 289-0614.

Diving[edit]
As with snorkeling there are many different charter services that you can go through.  Even if you are not a certified scuba diver, many of these services offer time of instruction and a chance to get acquainted  with the equipment, and later on in the day a chance to go out on a dive.  One of the larger companies in the area is Tilden's Scuba Center which has two locations, one of them being in Marathon at Mile Marker 49.5. Reservations and rates vary depending on what activity you want to participate in and how experienced a diver you are.  For reservations or inquires call ☏ +1-888-728-2235.  Open seven days a week.

Fishing[edit]
Fishing is always popular and charters are available.

Other[edit]

Buy[edit]
Marathon is not really a shopping destination, however this may be the spot to look for marine, hardware, grocery and other travel needs.  In Marathon, if you find yourself in need of bathing suits or other sun essentials just drive down US1 which is the main highway and you will be sure to find many shops to fulfill your needs. You will find better prices and selection here than less populous areas of the Keys.

Eat[edit]
Fresh seafood is abundant, stone crab claws when in season are a great local favorite and can easily be found cooked, chilled, ready to eat and give a new meaning to fast food. Stone crabs only give up one claw, then are returned to the water to give another day and allow for regeneration of the missing claw. Yum. Be extra careful when buying fish and shrimp off of pick up truck vendors along the road. If you have any doubts about the freshness of the offerings, move on. Another local favorite to look for is the Key Lime pies, available throughout the area. Numerous fish houses are to be found, offering fresh seafood plates at reasonable prices, at less than fancy places. A key to quality may be the number of local automobile licenses in the parking lot. Many restaurants will also cook your catch, if you are fishing. The price is reasonable, they provide the side dishes and clean up the mess for you.

 Hideaway Cafe (Rainbow Bend Resort Mile Marker 58), ☏ +1 305 289-1554. This restaurant is on the more expensive side and would be nice for a romantic evening for two or a family dinner overlooking the ocean. Seafood, poultry, and beef are the main staples at this restaurant. Since it does over-look the ocean and tends to get crowded early, make reservations. 
 Herbie's, 6350 Overseas Hwy (Mile Marker 50.5), ☏ +1 305 743-6373. This is the local hangout for many people that live here year round. This is a great place to eat for burgers and fries. Seating is limited and it tends to get packed in the evening. Reservations are not required. 
Drink[edit]
Sleep[edit]
Floating Accommodations
There is a real variety of places to sleep. If you have reservations and show up to find the accommodations unacceptable, do not hesitate to complain or check out. There are some beautiful accommodations to be found in the marina areas that are floating, two story efficiency rooms with bath, kitchen and balcony that can be rented by the day or week at reasonable cost. These are a great choice and offer a fantastic view and privacy. Some of the cottages being offered are very old, have had little repair and may have moisture/humidity problems due to being in shaded areas. Again, if you find it unacceptable, move on. There are few times you will find rooms unavailable, exceptions may be when the weather is bad and forces the bigger pleasure boats into port, and during the Fantasy Fest in Key West, when the rooms fill up fast.

 Gulf View Waterfront Resort, 5874 Overseas Highway (MM 58.5, Gulf side), toll-free: +1-877-289-0111. Guest rooms, efficiencies, 1- and 2-bedroom apartments, all nonsmoking, pets allowed.  Pool, putting green, aviary, hammocks, bicycle rentals, complimentary paddle boats/canoes/kayaks, boat dock available. 
Camping[edit]
Jolly Roger Trailer Park, +1 305-289-0404, 59275 Overseas Highway.
Key By The Sea[dead link] +1 305-743-5164, 6099 Overseas Hwy.
Stay safe[edit]
Theft can be a problem in this area, keep all valuables out of sight in parked cars. If you are bringing, or on a boat, keep an eye on it. There are more outboard motors stolen here than anywhere in the state, some say they end up in Cuba.

Pay attention to the weather. The Keys are a narrow band of islands that offer little protection from tropical storms. In the past storms have generated waves with enough strength to demolish bridges and topple freight trains and engines sitting on tracks. The locals seem immune to these dangers, rely on National Weather reports, rather than the opinion of locals. If it is suggested you go back to the mainland, do so immediately. There is only one highway out and it can become clogged quickly.  The Overseas Highway can and will be closed for a period should a car or truck accident occur.  Always allow extra time if traveling back to the mainland to meet a flight or cruise.
