Dollar is a village in Clackmannanshire in the Central Belt of Scotland, with a population of 2,800 in 2016. The scenic glen leading up to the castle is the reason to visit.


Understand[edit]
Dollar has no connection to the unit of currency — that word derives from silver mined in Joachimsthal in Bohemia, hence silver thalers.  The village name may mean dolorous or gloomy — the ravine of the glen can certainly be a dark and draughty place in winter. Nearby Stirling likewise has no connection with pound sterling.

See[edit]
Castle Campbell, formerly "Castle Gloom"
56.1748-3.67481 Castle Campbell, Dollar FK14 7PP (Walk up glen or cycle / drive up steep lane, car park only suitable for cars and 500 metres from castle by steep road.), ☏ +44 1259 742408. Apr-Sep: daily 9:30AM-5:30PM; Oct-Mar: Sa-W 10AM-4PM. 15th-century Towerhouse originally known as "Castle Gloom", but the Campbells of Argyll got an Act of Parliament passed to change the name - now that's power! But it was destroyed by the Royalists in 1654 when the 8th Earl of Argyll supported the Covenanters and Parliamentarians. He was beheaded after the Restoration and his son the 9th Earl abandoned the ruin, instead building Argyll's Lodgings in Stirling. Unsuitable for the disabled. Adult £7.50, child £4.50, conc £6.00.   (updated Apr 2024)
56.16678-3.670822 Dollar Museum, Castle Campbell Hall, 1 High Street, FK14 7AY. Easter-Xmas: Sa 11AM-1PM, 2-4:30PM; Su 2-4:30PM. Volunteer-run museum, showing the history of the town, Dollar Academy independent school, the Devon Valley Railway and temporary exhibitions. Free. (updated Mar 2019)
Dollar Academy is an independent school in the village, with some 1200 co-ed pupils, mostly boarders. The grounds are private but you should be able to espy the grand facade, built by Playfair in the 19th century.
56.18-3.6393 Japanese Garden, Upper Hillfoot Rd, Cowden FK14 7PL, ☏ +44 7876 117703. Daily Apr-Oct: 10:30AM-5PM, Nov-Mar: 10:30AM-4PM. Created in the Edwardian era, falling derelict but now under restoration. It's in the grounds of the former Cowden Castle, demolished in 1950. No dogs. Adult £8.50 65+ £7.50. (updated Mar 2024)
56.197-3.6054 Yetts of Muckhart: you can't fail to go to a place with such a name. Actually it's just a road junction, but A823 north through Glen Devon is one of the most charming glens of Scotland, especially when the gorse and heather are in bloom. You can cycle or walk up the side track to Frandy Farm but cars aren't allowed up there. Further north, A823 descends steeply down Gleneagles: famous name but not as scenic, and nowhere to pull over.
Do[edit]
Dollar Glen is the scenic gorge between village and castle. The area and path are maintained by NTS, but free to enter any time. From the museum, go upstream through the park; the way becomes steep and narrow and is not suitable for anyone with impaired mobility. The gorge narrows to a cleft, with the path carried by boardwalks and catwalks over the foaming river; a short branch delves into a cul-de-sac side-cleft. Follow the route onto the hillside with the castle. Here you can either loop back by following another path down the gorge, or take the lane. The autumn colours are brilliant, and are better on the sunlit hill than in the dark defile.
King's Seat is ascended by branching west out of Dollar Glen over Bank Hill (343 m) then on to the main summit at 648 m. Either return the same way or circle the head of the valley over Tarmangie (645 m), Whitewisp (643 m) and Saddle Hill (523 m) then back to the gorge and village. Lots more hikes in the Ochils nearby.
Devon Way is the trackbed of the former Devon Valley Railway between Alloa and Kinross, suitable for hiking or cycling. The best of it is the 3 miles / 5 km from south side of Dollar heading west to Tillicoutry, with views of the Ochils. It then trends southwest to Alloa, another 3 miles. East of Dollar it only goes as far as the Academy playing fields then the route has been lost. When completed in 1871 the railway created a scenic alternative route between Glasgow and Perth. It closed to passengers in 1964 but continued to haul coal from the local mines, until those closed in 1973.
Dollar Golf Course is a 9-hole course at north side of the village on the Ochil slopes.
Alva Games are held in Johnstone Park in Alva on the second Saturday in July, with the next on Sa 13 July 2024. Parking is in Cochrane Park adjacent. Dogs on leads are welcome.
