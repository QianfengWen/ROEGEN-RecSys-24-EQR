A view of Berat
Berat is a city in Albania. In 2008 it was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site as it is a rare example of a well-preserved Ottoman city. It is one of the country's most beautiful cities, and is known as the "city of a thousand windows".


Understand[edit]
Capital of its surrounding eponymous county. The town is known for its well preserved architecture influenced by the Ottomans and Byzantines. There are a variety of Byzantine churches and Ottoman mosques in the town reflecting the historical influences of the region and the coexistence of different religious and cultural communities. It is known as the "city of a thousand windows" because of the architectural style whereby buildings are constructed with a multitude of windows on a background of whitewashed walls to make use of daylight. Combined with the hilly nature of the town, the buildings rise above each other on the slopes, making for a striking impression on visitors.
Berat sits beneath the snowcapped Mount Tomorr, a holy mountain for Albanians, along the banks of the River Osum. Berat Castle rises above on a hill on the eastern bank of the river. The combination of a hillside fortified town with a backdrop of mountains and river makes for a picturesque location.
