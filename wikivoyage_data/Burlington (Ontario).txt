Understand[edit]
History[edit]
Before pioneer settlement in the 19th century, the area was covered by the primeval forest that stretched between the provincial capital of (York now Toronto) and the town of Hamilton, and was home to various First Nations peoples. In 1792, John Graves Simcoe, the first lieutenant governor of Upper Canada, named the western end of Lake Ontario "Burlington Bay" after the town of Bridlington in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England. By the time land beside the bay was deeded to Captain Joseph Brant at the turn of the 19th century, the name "Burlington" was already in common use. With the completion of the local survey after the War of 1812, the land was opened for settlement. Early farmers prospered in the Burlington area because of the fertile soil and moderate temperatures. Produce from the farms was shipped out via the bustling docks of the lakeside villages of Port Nelson and Wellington Square, and to Brown's Wharf in the nearby village of Port Flamborough (which was to become Aldershot). Lumber taken from the surrounding forests also competed for space on the busy docks. However, in the latter half of the 19th century, increased wheat production from Western Canada convinced local farmers to switch to fruit and vegetable production.
In 1874, Wellington Square and Port Nelson were incorporated into the Village of Burlington. However, the arrival of large steamships on the Great Lakes made the small docks of the local ports obsolete, and the increased use of railway to ship goods marked the end of the commercial wharves.
As more settlers arrived and cleared the land, cash crops replaced subsistence farming. Gradually, mixed farming and market gardens became the dominant form of agriculture, and in the early 20th century the area was declared the Garden of Canada. The first peaches grown in Canada were cultivated in the Grindstone Creek watershed in the city's south-west part. Today over forty percent of the Grindstone Creek watershed is still devoted to farms, orchards and nurseries.
Following the Second World War, cheap electricity from nearby Niagara Falls and better transportation access due to the new (1939) Queen Elizabeth Way encouraged light industry and families to move to Burlington. The population skyrocketed as new homes were built. 

Climate[edit]
The climate is moderated by its proximity to Lake Ontario. Monthly mean temperatures range from 22.3 °C (72.1 °F) in July to −4.2 °C (24.4 °F) in January. The average annual precipitation is 878 millimetres (34.6 in) of rain and 109 centimetres (43 in) of snow.
Although it shares the temperate climate found in Southern Ontario, its proximity to Lake Ontario moderates winter temperatures and it also benefits from a sheltering effect of the Niagara Escarpment, allowing the most northerly tracts of Carolinian forest to thrive on the Escarpment that runs through western sections of city.

Go next[edit]
Guelph — north of Burlington, in Southwestern Ontario, known for its university, limestone architecture, and a walkable downtown with small shops, restaurants and lively bars.
Hamilton — south of Burlington, and historically a heavy manufacturing centre, Hamilton's skyline viewed from Burlington looks like a collection of smokestacks and highway bridges. At the west end of the bay, Hamilton's downtown and surrounding neighbourhoods are home to a growing art, music, and food scene. On the edge of downtown, the Niagara Escarpment provides a variety of parks, hiking trails, and waterfalls.
Niagara Peninsula — to the east of Hamilton, between Lake Ontario and Lake Erie. Some of Ontario's best farmland is found here, and the unique climate make the peninsula one of Canada's wine regions. The Welland Canal in Thorold is an impressive engineering feat that tells part of the story of great lakes shipping. Niagara-on-the-Lake is a well-preserved colonial-style town with many connections to the War of 1812. Of course, Niagara Falls at the end of the peninsula, is the Canadian side of the famous waterfall. The city hosts visitors and honeymooners seeking a glimpse of the gorge, but also offers dining, sights, events and entertainment around the clock, all year long.
