Ashland is a city in Eastern Nebraska. The small city sits alongside the Platte River tributary of Salt Creek in Saunders County and had a population of 3,100 people in 2020. 


Understand[edit]
The city of Ashland has its beginnings as a fording location of Salt Creek. The limestone bottom in the area allowed for caravans traveling on the Oregon Trail to cross the otherwise muddy stream. By 1870, Ashland was established as a town of 700 people. Today, the town is able to enjoy the benefits of living between the two main economic hubs of Nebraska, Lincoln and Omaha, while still being far enough away to retain a sense of identity.
Most of the people in town are employed through manufacturing, agriculture, and the state parks. Camp Ashland, a U.S. National Guard training camp, is located nearby and is off-limits to visitors. NASA astronaut Clayton Anderson grew up in Ashland, and graduated from the local high school; he spent 152 days on the International Space Station in 2007, and is so far the only Nebraskan to go to space.
