Fort Worth, Texas
Fort Worth is a city in the Prairies and Lakes region of Texas. With a population of approximately 957,000, it is Texas's 5th largest city.  It is part of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, which has a population exceeding 6 million.  Sometimes referred to as Cowtown, it is by far closer to its cowboy roots than neighboring Dallas. This article also covers North Richland Hills, a neighboring community.


Understand[edit]
Fort Worth grew from a military camp established at the close of the Mexican War by Gen. Winfield Scott, and named for Gen. William Jenkins Worth who fought in the war. Forty-two men of Company F, 2nd Dragoons, established the camp on June 6, 1849. The Fort Worth to Yuma, Arizona stage line was established in 1850. The city became the seat of Tarrant County 1860, and after the Civil War, it became a major shipping and supply depot for cattlemen.

Climate[edit]
Fort Worth is located in the American South, and has a subtropical climate with mild winters, hot summers, and a wet spring and fall in between. In winter and summer it can also be a very dry place, as it receives warmer, drier weather from the Mojave Desert in the west and the Great Plains in the north.
Winters are generally mild, with average highs in the mid to upper 50s (10-15 °C) and average lows around the freezing mark (0-5 °C). It is not uncommon for Winter days with highs in the upper 60s (~20°C) with the following days high temperature 20-30 degrees cooler.  It may snow in Fort Worth a couple times a year, and occasionally winter temperatures will not get above freezing (32°F, 0 °C), but for the most part winter is just relatively dry and cool. There is, however, the danger of freezing rain and ice storms.
Spring and fall bring very pleasant temperatures, but spring is also known for its storms. Fort Worth is at the Southern tip of Tornado Alley, and springtime weather can be quite volatile and severe storms often occur. Summers are hot and dry - but often humid - with temperatures frequently surpassing 100 °F (38 °C).
Average precipitation in Fort Worth is 33 inches (830 mm) per year.

Stay safe[edit]
As with any other large city, be vigilant in Fort Worth. The city's central arts and entertainment district is well policed, however, as so long as you make sure you lock your car and hide any valuables inside, all that you need is a little extra awareness of your surroundings. The city's freeways can be quite dangerous if you are not accustomed to driving in such high volumes of rapidly moving traffic; keep this in mind when you are planning a trip.

Areas to avoid after dark are the East Side, Southeast Side (especially in the Stop Six section), the Como neighborhood, and the Trails/Calmont neighborhood, as these places have high rates of gun crimes from armed robberies to shootings.
The Stockyards bar and club district can get rowdy on Friday and Saturday nights, but the nightlife at Sundance Square in Downtown is more laid back.

Cope[edit]
Gym workout[edit]
24 Hour Fitness and LA Fitness (which now includes Ballys) have many locations throughout the area. If you have a regular membership with either of them from back home your membership is good here.  Note that some memberships are only good for one location and will cost extra to access a different gym/club than the one you normally go to at home. Ask before leaving. Otherwise day passes range from $10-20. Bring a lock and towel.
