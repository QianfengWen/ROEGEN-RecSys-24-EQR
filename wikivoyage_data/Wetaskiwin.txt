Wetaskiwin is 70 km (43 mi) south of Edmonton, the city name comes from the Cree word wītaskiwinihk, meaning "the hills where peace was made". Wetaskiwin was the site of a battle between the Cree and the Blackfoot. In 1890, when the Calgary and Edmonton Railway was built, it became a whistle-stop, and was known as Siding 16. It was named in 1892 after the battle. Shortly after the area was surveyed, a group of Scandinavian immigrants settled at the townsite.
