Abersoch is a village in Llŷn particularly favoured for sailing. Both the village itself and the roads to the headlands west of it tend to get very crowded. Packed with holiday homes, making housing unaffordable to most locals, it becomes a bit of a ghost town outside of the main tourist season. As a consequence, it has very little native character about it.
