Fortress
Hvar is an island off the coast of Croatia with a population of about 11,000 people (2011). Imposing fortifications hover above the fluid blend of grey stone and orange cascading roofs. The remains of walls built by a long list of invaders descend towards the wide promenade edging the brilliant blue sea and the quaint fishing harbor. Marble streets reveal one of the largest squares in Dalmatia, the prized Cathedral of St. Stephen, and the Renaissance theatre.


Understand[edit]
Island Hvar and especially 43.1716.441 Hvar town and the neighbouring historical town of 43.184516.5992 Stari Grad are among the most popular destinations in the Adriatic.
Hvar is on the edge of a beautiful, crystal-clear blue sea, surrounded by big green hills, and built from lots of old stone. At sundown a stroll up old lanes from the square in Hvar Town leads up to another lane which, high above the others is extremely attractive and shouldn’t be missed.
Hvar Town may be the most stunning town on the island but Stari Grad, the oldest city in Croatia, Jelsa, as and smattering of small villages dotting the coast or nestled in the lush interior are well worth a visit.
The area of Starogradsko polje (Stari Grad Plain) is a distinctive example of agricultural development by the ancient Greek colonists who settled on the island in the 4th century BC. For this reason, this area is included in the World Heritage List.
During the season (May to September) it can be very busy, especially during August when large numbers of Italians visit. Hvar was relatively cheap, without an extensive tourist infrastructure, and it attracted a lot of young people. However, this is changing as large five-star hotels are being built and the standard of living in Croatia is rising.

Get in[edit]
Ferry company Jadrolinija  operates the car ferry (approx. 2 hr), arriving near Stari Grad or by Krilo Luka fast ferry (a hydrofoil) (approx 1 hr) to Hvar City from Split. All ferry companies, schedules, prices, tickets and information are  available online at GetByFerry.com[dead link]. Buses operate to bring people to and from the ferry through the island (€2 to Starigrad, €3.50 to Hvar City (April 2009)). As buses fill, late-coming passengers are often required to stand in the aisles during the entire bus journey.
Jadrolinija also brings you from Hvar town to Vela Luka (Korčula) and to the island Lastovo, and from Sućuraj in the east of Hvar to Drvenik (mainland).
Krilo Luka operates fast ferries from Hvar town to Split. It also brings you from Hvar town to islands Vis, Milna (Brač), Korčula, Mljet  and coastal city Dubrovnik. The car ferries run most regularly (approximately three per day and more during the high season (May to September) and call at Stari Grad. The fast ferries run less frequently but also operate to and from Hvar town. There are also ferries to other destinations, most notably Italy.
Get around[edit]

Buses meet the car ferries at Stari Grad and run to various destinations such as Hvar town. Don't take taxis from the ferry port, they're a rip-off.
You can easily rent a car for about €47 a day if you wish to explore other parts of the island.  The rental agencies have firm policy of a minimum of one day rental (no hourly rentals).  You can also rent a scooter or moped for about €33.50 a day.  There are hourly rates for the mopeds and scooters.  The roads on Hvar can be steep and windy and there are no guard rails, so be careful especially if riding a rented moped which is old and has already done tens of thousands miles.
There are only 2 petrol stations on the island: in the town of Hvar and near Jelsa.  From Securaj to the nearest petrol station on the island is approx 50 km.
There is a convenient water taxi that will take you directly from Stari Grad harbour to the ferry for €2.

Hvar (city) and surroundings[edit]
The Town Square in Hvar is among the most beautiful and the largest in Croatia. The square measures 4500 m², and the town has developed around this square, starting north of the square in the 13th century and then circling to the south of the square in the 15th century.  There is also a fortress at the top of the hill with walls that encompass parts of the city. It's an easy walk, although uphill, to the fortress. It's worth the trek however because of the wonderful views you have of the harbor and surrounding areas. Don't forget to bring your cameras. There is a small eatery in the middle of the fortress where you can purchase drinks and snacks.
The fortress
Vrboska,  a settlement on the north coast of the island
The Cathedral of St. Stephen (Trg Sveti Stjepana) dominates one end of the Town Square, and was built during the 16th and 17th centuries. The bell tower of this cathedral is four-stories high, with each level more elaborately decorated than the last. The cathedral was built over an existing cathedral that was destroyed by the Turks. Parts of this older cathedral can be seen inside the church, but most of the interior was rebuilt.
Unique ceramics decorated with spiral ornaments in red, yellow, brown, and white were found at a Neolithic archeological site, Grapčeva špilja, near Hvar Town. Since such ornaments and engraving methods have only been found on the island of Hvar, archeologists have named this kind of Neolithic art "hvarska kultura" (Hvar's Culture). The island of Hvar also has the tradition of making lace, but from the threads of agave leaves. Nuns from the Benedictine monastery in Hvar are masters of this unique craft.
The Bishop's Treasury, adjacent to the cathedral, contains silver vessels, embroidered Mass robes, numerous Madonnas, icons dating from the 13th century, and an elaborately carved sarcophagus.
Humac[edit]
43.14320816.7567041 Humac, Humac, Jelsa (about 1 km off the main street (D116) across the island, ca. 10 km east of Jelsa). (updated Aug 2018)
Humac is an old, now mostly uninhabited hamlet with a history dating back centuries. It is home to simple houses made of stone, some  with foundations dating back to early Stone Age. In between and around the houses are typical fields (amongst others of lavender and wine), some of which are still worked on, some of which seem deserted. It is a prime example of local building and farming history. During the last few centuries, people moved to live elsewhere while the village has still been used for agriculture and keeping cattle.
Parts of the village are being restored and there seems to be a small museum with ethnographic objects.
Located at 350 m above sea level, the village also offers some magnificent views over the fields and the sea.

Drink[edit]
 Carpe Diem, At the end of the riva (at the end of the riva on the right side). It's all big cushions, sofas, hammocks and mood lighting. Drinks leave something to be desired. It's a real shame, because it's the perfect spot to drink cocktails, but they make them with flavoured syrups instead of fresh fruit, and they all taste like bubble-gum. The DJs are usually on the international circuit and the energy is high.
