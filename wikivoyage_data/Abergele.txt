Abergele is a relatively new seaside town in the county borough of Conwy in North Wales, located between Colwyn Bay and Rhyl. Abergele is often overlooked due to the popularity of nearby Rhyl, Prestatyn, Colwyn Bay, Llandudno and Conwy. Around 30% of the population speak Welsh. It is surrounded by wooded hillsides and its most prominent landmark is Gwrych Castle.
