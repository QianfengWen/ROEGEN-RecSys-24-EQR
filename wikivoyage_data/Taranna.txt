Taranna is a small township of 156 on the Tasman Peninsula, about 9 km north of Port Arthur. It's home of the Tasmanian Devil Unzoo, a popular place to see Tasmanian devils. 


Understand[edit]
Get in[edit]
The township is along the Arthur Highway (A9), the highway connecting Sorell and Port Arthur. It takes about 40–50 minutes from Sorell, as the road is very windy (despite the 100-km/h limit).
From Nubeena, the township is around 15 minutes via the Nubeena Road (B37).
Hobart International Airport HBA IATA is the nearest major airport.

-43.0607147.86411 Tasmanian Devil Unzoo (Tasmanian Devil Conservation Park), 5990 Arthur Hwy, ☏ +61 3 6250 3230. Daily 9AM–5PM. Perhaps the first of its kind in Australia, this "unzoo" is specifically dedicated to protecting the devils on the Tasman Peninsula, which are even more special as these devils have been isolated from the rest of Tasmania by the Denison Canal (and thus, many devils here have escaped being a victim of the Devil Facial Tumour Disease). What's unique about this "unzoo" is that it has no fences – meaning the animals and birds that live and visit here come by choice. Obviously, all animals here are native to Tasmania. You may also see some Cape Barren geese following you, and if they do, they're probably also wanting to have a nice stroll like you do. $44 per adult, $22 per child, $110 per family (2 adults + 2 children), $39 per senior (65+).
