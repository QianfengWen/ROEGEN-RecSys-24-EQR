Harleston is a small market town in Norfolk close to the River Waveney and the Suffolk border. A charming town with lots of Georgian houses, alleyways, character, etc. to explore, but from a visitor's perspective the town is a working town and mainly caters for locals. Visitors are more likely to visit the town for the surrounding countryside which has much to offer.


Understand[edit]
Clock Tower
Harleston was first called Herolf'ston (from the Danish leader Herolf in the around 1010 who settled in the area). Although there is no record of a royal charter, the town is thought to have held a weekly market since the mid-1300s and still holds a Wednesday market.
The parish is called Redenhall with Harleston which includes the adjoining village of Redenhall.
