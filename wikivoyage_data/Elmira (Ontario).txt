Understand[edit]
History[edit]
St James Lutheran Church
The land comprising Woolwich Township belonged to the Huron Nation and then to the Mohawk Nation. The first European settlers arrived in Woolwich Township in the late 18th century. The early settlers were primarily from England or Ireland until about 1830.
In 1806, the major portion of this tract was sold to Mennonites from Pennsylvania, the so-called Pennsylvania Dutch (actually Deutsch or German). A community by the name of Bristow's Corners was already in existence in 1839 when a post office was assigned there. Local merchant Samuel Weber had been visiting New York State in the early 1850s and was apparently impressed with Elmira, New York. This may have been a factor in the decision of Woolwich Township council in 1853 to rename the community Elmira.

Mennonite speedster
In addition to Mennonites from Pennsylvania, the majority of settlers were from Germany by the 1850s. Railways arrived in the late 1800s: the Grand Trunk and the Canadian Pacific. Furniture manufacturing and other industries began to open.
