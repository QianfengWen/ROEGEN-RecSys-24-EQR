Baden is a town in the Zurich region of Switzerland. It has a lively shopping centre, and a beautiful old town with traditional Swiss buildings, and small castle, all on the banks of the river Limmat which flows from Lake Zurich. Half of the town is dominated by the industrial/office complexes of General Electric, ABB and Ansaldo and the local economy is dependent upon their power plant manufacturing, but historically people were attracted to Baden for its thermal baths.
It is a nice town of 19,00 people (2018) to stay in while visiting the larger and busier cities in the region, such as Zurich. In addition to Baden the neighbouring villages of Wettingen, Ennetbaden, Obersiggenthal and Neuenhof are covered in this guide.
