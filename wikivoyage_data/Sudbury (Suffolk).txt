Understand[edit]
Thomas Gainsborough Statue in Market Square
The town dates back to Anglo-Saxon times with the town market becoming established by the early 11th century. Through the late middle ages the town developed silk and weaving industries and the prosperity resulted in many buildings and churches. Gainsborough Silks[dead link] started in 1798 is still thriving in the town today.
The town is particularly proud of a former resident Thomas Gainsborough, who was born in the town and who was inspired by the local countryside. Today there is a statue of him in the Market Place

Due to Sudbury's small and compact nature, it is no problem at all to cover the town from edge to edge on foot. However, the Tesco store and commercial park are off the Sudbury bypass, a fair walk from the town centre and best reached by car.

See[edit]
Town Hall
The idyllic water meadows around the river Stour can be found just outside of the town centre. There are many paths and perfect picnic settings to take advantage of on summer evenings.
Buried beneath the locally famous Mill Hotel there is a mummified cat which can be viewed upon request.
There is a small infogram located by St Peter's Church in the town centre marking the fact that Sudbury was mentioned in the novel 101 Dalmatians, and is well worth a look for fans of English literature.

Buy[edit]
The town centre took a turn for the worse in the early 2010s, with many shops being forced to close due to the economic climate.
There are still some modest outlets for local goods but most shops tend to be part of major chains.
The main shops in the town are a pair of W.H.Smith's, an Iceland, a discount shop called Thing Me Bobs and a 99p store which forced a pound shop across the road out of business.

Eat[edit]
In addition to the chain restaurants in the town such as Prezzo, Ask, Café Nero and Wetherspoon's, there are some independent eateries.
For a delicious and well-priced lunch (or even afternoon snack), Niche in Gainsborough Street offer a great selection of freshly prepared hot and cold sandwiches in addition to a great drinks menu.
There are two local pizza restaurants in the town centre which provide a fantastic alternative to the vastly overpriced Domino's takeaway.
Also within the town centre there are a multitude of Chinese and Indian takeaways and restaurants as well as kebab shops for late night munchies. Northern Bites on North Street is particularly recommended.
Further out of town there is also a McDonald's and a KFC, although these are best avoided, especially at night time as these areas attract an unpleasant crowd of youths.
