Stanton is a city in Orange County in Southern California. While it is not at all a very important city, it is a terminus for visitors wanting to travel from Knott's Berry Farm to Disneyland or vice versa (see Get in below).


Get in[edit]
Stanton is located at the intersection of Beach Boulevard and Katella Avenue. The intersection is south of Knott's Berry Farm on Beach Boulevard, and west of Disneyland on Katella Avenue.

Get around[edit]
Stanton is small and can easily be navigated by car or Orange County Transportation Authority buses. However, the only tourist attractions (see below) are on Beach Boulevard.
