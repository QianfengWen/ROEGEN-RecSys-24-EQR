The Lawn and Dawlish Water
Dawlish  is an English seaside resort town and civil parish in Teignbridge in the English Riviera and South Devon region of Devon, 12 miles (19 km) from  Exeter. Its population was about 16,000 in 2018.


Understand[edit]

It grew in the 18th century from a small fishing port into a well-known seaside resort. Dawlish is located at the outlet of a small river, Dawlish Water (also called The Brook), between Permian red sandstone cliffs, and is fronted by a sandy beach with the South Devon Railway sea wall and the Riviera Line railway above. Behind this is a central public park, The Lawn, through which Dawlish Water flows.
Dawlish is known for its black swans (Cygnus atratus), introduced from Western Australia, which live with other exotic waterfowl in a small urban sanctuary on Dawlish Water. There are several attractions in and around the town, such as beaches, safari mini-golf, a waterfowl centre, a theatre, a leisure centre with a pool, a countryside park, and the Dawlish Museum.

Climate[edit]
Dawlish has a fairly mild climate due to its coastal location. Often termed the "English Riviera" along with Teignmouth and the Torbay towns, Dawlish rarely has snow or frost, boasts outdoor subtropical plants such as palms, olives, bananas and lemons. Extremes of temperature are rare: temperatures over 30 °C or under 0 °C are infrequent. It is one of the sunniest places in the United Kingdom. The wet season (autumn and winter) can bring copious amounts of rain, and easterly winds can generate large storm surges and waves that can lead to dramatic conditions along the seafront.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
The A379 road from Exeter to Torbay/Dartmouth/Plymouth runs through the town, parallel to the railway line.

By bus[edit]
Buses to the town are provided by Stagecoach South West. Services include Hop 2 from Exeter to Newton Abbot which runs every 30 minutes (more in rush hour), an hourly 2B service to Exeter via Marsh Barton, and Hop 22 from Dawlish Warren to Torquay which runs every hour. In summer, the 222 open-top bus from Dawlish Warren to Teignmouth also runs every hour.

By train[edit]
50.58055-3.4645311 Dawlish railway station. It's on the Exeter - Plymouth line.   
Dawlish railway station is in the town centre next to the beach. It offers trains to most stations in Devon and to London Paddington, Birmingham, Manchester and further afield. The line includes one of the memorable stretches of the British track for its natural environment, but at a high cost, as a constant battle with sea erosion makes it one of the expensive lines for Network Rail to maintain.
