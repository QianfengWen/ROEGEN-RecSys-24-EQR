Mittagong is one of the major towns of the Southern Highlands of New South Wales.


Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Located 110 km southwest of Sydney, you'll get there via the Hume Motorway.  Exits are clearly signposted from the road, and the trip should take around 90 minutes from the city centre.  It's an easy stopping point on the Hume Motorway to avoid the highway services if you need a break, or some food.

By train[edit]
-34.452652150.4478661 Mittagong Station  is a major stop on the Southern Highlands Line, with hourly frequencies on weekdays and 2-hour frequencies on weekends.  Except for a single service in peak, a change at Campbelltown is required.  You'll need to buy a reloadable Opal Card, single-use Opal ticket, or use a contactless credit card on the Opal gates.

The best way to see the local area is by car.  Parking and traffic are not a problem, and the roads to most nearby attractions are paved.
The train service on the Southern Highlands Line will take you to the neighbouring Southern Highlands towns every couple of hours, so requires a bit of planning.
There is a very limited bus service[dead link] on weekdays, and this mostly consists of transport for school children. The bus network does not accept Opal, and you must buy a ticket from the driver.
The local taxi service, Southern Highlands Taxis, also run services 24/7 though they have expensive rates, for example, travel to the next town across, Bowral, usually will cost $20 or more.

See[edit]
Located in the Nattai River Valley between two extinct volcanoes, Mt Gibraltar and Mt Alexandra, Mittagong boasts spectacular natural scenery. The view from Mr Gibraltar is pleasant.
The drive up to the lookouts at Mount Gilbraltar is signposted from the town centre, and from the Bowral road. The view is quite nice, and there are a couple of places to admire the view. There is a rim walk, as well as a walk all the way to the top. The picnic areas are somewhat run-down and overgrown, but still worth a visit for the view.
Mittagong is a lovely country setting now by-passed by the Hume Motorway at the entrance to the Southern Highlands. Mittagong is a favourite haunt of Sydney-siders who come to browse the antique shops and second-hand stores, galleries and hobby stores and dine at a range of excellent restaurants.

 Lake Alexandra. A man made lake, with BBQs, walk around the lake, and other walks into bushland nearby.  Very popular on a sunny weekend. free.
