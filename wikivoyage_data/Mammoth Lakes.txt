Mammoth Lakes is a resort town  next to Mammoth Mountain which is a popular skiing destination.  Mammoth Lakes is in the Eastern Sierra region of the Sierra Nevada mountains in California. In 2020, it had a permanent population of 7,200 people.


Understand[edit]
Mammoth Mountain with ski runs toward the top and the city of Mammoth Lakes hidden in the trees on the lower slopes.
The Sierra Nevada mountains are a popular snow skiing destination. For Californians living in Los Angeles, Mammoth Mountain is the easiest resort to get to from Los Angeles.
The Town of Mammoth Lakes serves one main function: a place for these hordes of Los Angelenos to stay.  Condos, motels, hotels, and restaurants fill this small town to serve the flood of winter visitors. In summer, the flood stops and rents plunge, making Mammoth an affordable base to explore the region.

Climate[edit]
At 8,000 feet (2,400 m) of elevation, the city stays naturally cool during the region's summer heat waves.  Nearby Bishop routinely heats to 105 °F (41 °C) while Mammoth tops out around 84 °F (29 °C).
