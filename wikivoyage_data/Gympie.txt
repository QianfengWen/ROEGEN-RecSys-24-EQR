The countryside is spectacular with an abundance of curves, gradients and bridges. Steep slopes portray a patchwork of pineapples, macadamia nuts and other crops. The Mary Valley features rolling green pastures and many beautiful forests. The valley includes the villages and towns of Dagun, Amamoor, Kandanga and Imbil.
Other attractions include:

Gympie Pyramid - a terraced structure that some believe to be the work of an ancient civilisation (but more likely the work of early Italian or Swiss immigrants) - located on the outskirts of Gympie.
The Big Pineapple - one of the famed Big things in Australia
Gold mining sites - Gympie is called "The Town that Saved Queensland", but for its memorabilia, gold mining still continues to play a part in the town's fortunes. The Deep Creek, a gully just near the Mary River, is a profitable spot for gold panning.
