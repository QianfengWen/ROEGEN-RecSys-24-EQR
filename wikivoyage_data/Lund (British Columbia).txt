Lund harbour
Lund is a village of about 240 people (2016) near the northern end of British Columbia's Sunshine Coast. It's quiet, out of the way and has a beautiful setting with the snow-capped peaks of Vancouver Island across Georgia Street on one side and the green rise of the Coast Mountains on the other.  Not surprisingly then, it's a great place to relax or if you're looking for some time in the great outdoors.


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
Lund was named by brothers Frederick and Charles Thulin, who came from Tryserum near Valdemarsvik, Sweden. When they settled at the harbour in December 1889, they named it after Lund, Sweden, because it was Swedish and fairly easy for non-Scandinavians to pronounce.  When they arrived, there were native homes around the harbour The Thulins built a store and in 1892 a post office was added, followed by the first licensed hotel north of Vancouver two years later. Logging and fishing were the source of income in the early years. Transportation was by water. A second hotel, called the Malaspina, was built by the Thulins. When the original hotel was destroyed by a forest fire in 1918, the newer hotel, which continues to operate in the village, was renamed the Lund Hotel. A paved road leading south to Vancouver was completed in 1954 and coastal steamer service ended two years later. The original wharf built by the Thulins was damaged by a storm in 1954 and replaced by a government wharf.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
The main way in (and out) of town is Highway 101 (Sunshine Coast Highway). Powell River is 22 km (14 mi) south by road, from where BC Ferries offers service to Comox on Vancouver Island to the west across the Strait of Georgia. 
Road access to Vancouver to the south involves two ferry crossings of fjords along the Sunshine Coast.  From Vancouver, it will take about 5-6 hours, depending on the wait time at the ferries.

Savary Island's golden sand beaches are a rarity in British Columbia
49.940556-124.8172221 Savary Island. Is an island near Lund. It is unique ecologically for the area as it's like a migrating sandbar with beaches along the shore and forests in the middle. The sandy beaches, plus the (relatively) warmer waters, have earned it the nickname of "Hawaii of the North". There are some hiking and snorkeling opportunities and it's a good place just to hang out on the beach and relax. There are some amenities (general store, accommodation) from mid-May to early-September, but if you travel there at other times, be sure to bring your own supplies. Lund Water Taxi provides transport to and from the island; return trip is $20/person.   (updated May 2023)
