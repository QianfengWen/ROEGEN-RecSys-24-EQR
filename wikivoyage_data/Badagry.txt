Badagry, also known as Gbadagri, is a coastal town and local government area in Lagos State, South West Nigeria. Being the second largest town in Lagos State, Badagry is surrounded by lakes, creeks  or runlets and island, which makes beaches and resorts one of the major attractions of the ancient town.  
In 2016, the municipality had a population of about 241,000. 


Understand[edit]
Badagry, which is also spelt as Badagri, is a town and lagoon port in Lagos state. It is sited on the north bank of Porto Novo runlet, an inland waterway that links the national capitals of Nigeria (Lagos) and Benin (Porto-Novo), and also on a road that leads to Lagos, Ilaro, and Porto-Novo.
Badagry is the seat of a local government council and it is inhabited by Popo and Gun peoples mainly. It rapidly became a major residential suburb of Lagos after the opening of an expressway in 1976. The area has an automotive assembly plant, and it is the site of a college, a secondary school, and several hospitals as well. 
Badagry subsists largely on fishing and agriculture. In the 1880s, coconut plantations were established in Badagry and the present-day Badagry still exports coconuts, copra, coconut husk fibre (coir), fish, vegetables, and cassava to Lagos about 55 km (34 mi) away. Also, after the establishment of a factory that makes bags for packing farm products in the mid-1960s, the packaging of kenaf (which is a fibrous plant) became highly important. The area traded primarily in fish, palm oil and kernels, cassava, coconut and corn (maize).  

History[edit]
Badagry was founded in the early 15th century on a lagoon off the Gulf of Guinea. It was founded by the Popo refugees from the wars with the Fon people of Dahomey. It was cut out of Nigeria in 1863 and eventually added to the state of Lagos as part of Nigeria by the United Kingdom in 1901. Its protected harbour led to the town becoming a key port in the export of slaves to the Americas, which were mainly to Salvador, Bahia in Brazil. It was such a big departure point for slaves headed for French Saint-Domingue (today's Haiti). The main god of Haiti's official religion of Vodun is called Ogun-Badagri. After its discovery in the late 1720s, a British trading post was established there in the late 1820s. Consequent upon this establishment, Badagry developed as a palm-oil port for Egbaland to the north and as an importer of European cloth. It also became the site of the first European Mission church (Methodist) in Nigeria in 1842 and it remained a leading port and mission centre until the attack in 1851 by the army of Lagos when the city was destroyed by fire. That attack, together  with the constant threat of the Fon and the poor sandy soils in the area, led to the complete exodus of the town’s traders, missionaries, and farmers. 
From the 1840s, following the suppression of the slave trade, Badagry declined significantly but became a major site of Christian mission work.  
The first education system of Nigeria as a British colony started in Badagry where the first primary school was established by the Wesleyan mission (Methodist Church) in 1843: the Nursery of Infant Church later became St. Thomas’ Anglican Nursery and Primary School. It was founded by Rev. Golmer of the Church Missionary Society (CMS) in 1845.  In 1863 the town was annexed by the United Kingdom and incorporated into the Lagos colony. In 1901 it became a part of Nigeria. 

Government and monarchy[edit]
Badagry is a monarchy headed by the Wheno Aholuship, a kingship headed by the Akran of Badagry and his seven white cap high chiefs. Badagry had established the institution of divine kingship (De Wheno Aholu). This had its root from its historical migration from ketu kingdom in the 15th century. From the previous De Wheno Aholu Akran Gbafoe down to the present De Wheno Aholu Akran Menu Toyi I the stool had produced 17 Akrans.
The white cap chiefs administer the eight quarters into which Badagry is divided — Ahovikoh, Boekoh, Jegba, Posukoh, Awhanjigo, Asago, Whalako, and Ganho. These quarters and the families that ruled them played prominent roles in brokering slave trade with the Europeans and Brazilians.
The title of Badagry’s royal father is Oba Akran, a kingship so influential that one of the longest commercial avenues (a 2.14-km stretch) in Ikeja, Oba Akran Avenue, was named after it.

Religion[edit]
The traditional worshipping of the Supreme Being (Jiwheyewhe mawu ose) through lesser gods such as Ogun (God of iron) and Hevioso (god of thunder) is still very much practised. Being mainly fishermen, the Egun people also worship Olokuna water deity which is usually appeased for abundant fishes.
Christianity was first preached in Nigeria at Badagry in 1842 by Rev Thomas Birch Freeman. The site where Christianity was first preached then is now the "Agiya Tree Monument" beside the Badagry Town Hall.

Climate[edit]
The temperature in Badagry varies from 22 °C (72 °F) to 33 °C (91 °F). The weather at the beach is always very breezy and cool during the dry season because of the coconut trees that surrounds the beach and the presence of the ocean. The rainy season is always wet and very cold, the sea level rises, it is not always advised to visit the beach during the raining season.
The best times for a visit are from mid July to early September and from mid December to late January.

Talk[edit]
Egun is the native language of the people of Badagry, and Yoruba language is generally spoken but Egun is a predominant dialect of Ajara, which is similar to the Fon language, Gun is sub-group dialect that is spoken in Porto-Novo (in Benin).

The foundation of the ancient historical laden was laid by Rev Henry Townsend of CMS on the Marina Waterfront in the year 1842, and was later built by other missionaries in 1845. The building served as vicarage for St. Thomas Anglican Church and was later used by Samuel Ajayi Crowther, the first African CMS Bishop that translated the Holy Bible from English to Yoruba. In one of the two rooms on the upper floor of the building, there lay a glass case containing the English and Yoruba version of the bible translated by Ajayi Crowther. It was said that both the English and Yoruba Bibles is over 173 and 170 years old respectively. (updated Jun 2021)

In place of the tree, an obelisk was erected in 2012 in celebration of 170 years of Christianity in Nigeria. (updated Jun 2021)

Symbolized by two poles slightly slanted towards each other and facing the Atlantic Ocean, the island was a major slave port after it was opened in 1473 during the Trans Atlantic Slave Trade era. As many as 10,000 slaves are believed to have been shipped from the island to the Americas between 1518 and 1880. (updated Jan 2023)
 The Slave Spirit Attenuation Well. The Slaves' Spirit Attenuation Well or Well of Memory Loss. While the well in the Brazilian Baraccoon would have served the purpose of quenching slaves' thirst, the one on the Island of Gberefu, just across Badagry, served a more sinister purpose, according to subsisting tales of the slave era. Ominously named the Slaves'Spirit Attenuation Well, popular legend suggests that in the era, as the slaves filed from their various merchants' courtyards with chains around their wrists, necks and waists from across the Marina, they were ferried on boats a short distance to Gberefu Island. From the landing at Gberefu Island, the slaves would then be filed towards what would become the last time African land would ever be under their feet. But about one kilometre from the riverside landing on the Island towards the Point of No Return on the Atlantic border of the Island, a well stands alone in the middle of the plain. Save for the roof that has been put over it to venerate its historical status along with a sign wall that proclaims its disturbing name, the well looks like any other. But its history or legend suggests that it was the beginning of the horrendous journey that would take slaves who were forced to drink from it from their native land to either their slave masters or to death.
