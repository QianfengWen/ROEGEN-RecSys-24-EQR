Understand[edit]
The Art Nouveau Palacio de Hierro
Orizaba is one of the main cities of the Mexican State of Veracruz. The city is also known by locals as "Pluviosilla".
It is located in the High Mountains region, and gives its name to the highest peak in the nation, the Pico de Orizaba . Its origin dates back to the 16th century when explorers made their way to the center of the Aztec empire: Tenochtitlan. Later it became a strategic point for trade due to its location between Mexico City and the port of Veracruz.
Its fertile soil and pleasant climate make the area suitable for the production of coffee, sugar cane and beer, the main products of the region.

Get in[edit]
It's located between Mexico City and the port of Veracruz. 

By plane[edit]
Being a relatively small city by Mexican standards, it is not possible to get to Orizaba in a commercial flight from a major airline. However, it is possible to reach the city flying to Mexico City International airport and taking a bus directly to Orizaba from the airport.
If you know someone or are alone when travelling to Orizaba, it may be more convenient to fly into Veracruz International Airport in the city of Veracruz. The drive to Orizaba is about 3 hours long, but the roads are fairly well maintained. There are numerous car rental companies in Veracruz. 
Flying into Veracruz instead of Mexico City may be better because: 

Traffic in Mexico City is notoriously horrible. Veracruz traffic is considerably thinner and easier to manage.
The mountain overpass between Orizaba and Mexico City is extremely dangerous, with sharp turns and angles of nearly twenty degrees vertical. During the winter it is nearly inaccessible and not recommended for driving.
By car[edit]
Getting to Orizaba by car is easy. From Mexico City, take the Mexico-Veracruz highway. Orizaba is about four hours from Mexico's capital.
