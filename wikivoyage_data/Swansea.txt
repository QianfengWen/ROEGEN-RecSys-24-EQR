This article is about the urban area of Swansea. The Swansea Rural is covered in a separate article.
Swansea (pronounced: Swan-zee; Welsh: Abertawe) is a city on the beautiful Gower Peninsula — the United Kingdom's first designated "Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty". With a population approaching 250,000 (2016), it is the second largest city in Wales and is known for its Blue Flag beaches and stunning coastal walks.


Districts[edit]
Swansea Urban (this article) — from north to south covering areas from Morriston and Clydach to St. Thomas and Swansea Bay sea front and from east to west covering areas from Port Tennant to Caswell. Swansea Urban includes the city centre and the tourist areas of the Maritime Quarter, Mumbles, Limeslade, Langland and Caswell.
Gower Peninsula — covering all points west of Bishopston, Pwll Du Bay, Fairwood Common and Upper Killay, and also including the highland areas of Pontarddulais and Mawr.
Understand[edit]
History[edit]
During medieval times, Swansea was a prosperous market town, later gaining a certain prominence as a spa resort. It was during the industrial revolution, however, that the city flourished and its population grew. The city is home to the world's first passenger railway service known as the Mumbles Train, which bumped and bounced along five miles of Swansea foreshore, linking the city centre with the suburb of Mumbles. Much of the city centre's architectural heritage was lost through wartime bombing. However, the abundance of parks, stunning coastal scenery, lovely water-side suburbs, a magnificent bay-side maritime quarter, varied cultural events, medieval castles and golden sandy beaches have preserved Swansea's place as a major tourist destination. Furthermore, according to a survey conducted by an international health magazine that considered, among other factors, a city's crime rate, life-style, environment, etc., Swansea was judged to be the most relaxed city in the UK, while two national surveys have ranked the city as the third friendliest place in the country with regard to customer service and the safest urban area in the UK. 
The name 'Swansea' is derived from 'Sweyn's ey,' which meant the island belonging to Sweyn (Sven) in Old Norse, the area having been settled by Scandinavians in the Middle Ages. Abertawe, by contrast, means 'mouth of the river Tawe'. Locals are known as Swansea Jacks, after a hero dog who rescued no fewer than 27 people from drowning during his seven-year life in the 1930s; Jack's memorial is on the promenade in Brynmill, close to the university.
Dylan Thomas was passionate about Swansea, and in his early days described it as an "ugly, lovely town, crawling, sprawling, slummed, unplanned, jerry-villa'd, and smug-suburbed by the side of a long and splendid curving shore." Later, he referred to it as "the most romantic town I know," and  described it with great gusto as a "marble town, city of laughter, little Dublin" and screamed triumphantly "Never was there such a town!"
Incidentally, the Swansea seaside resort of Mumbles derives its name from the French word mamelles, meaning "breasts"; take a look at the two islets off Mumbles Head from across the bay, and it is easy to see why.

Swansea has a wet and mild climate, with winter temperatures ranging from around 4 to 6°C, while the summer average high is about 20°C but often reaching to 26 or 27°C. Sun lovers should visit Swansea from June to August, which is the period that records the most hours of sunshine and is the main tourist season. However, those who prefer long solitary walks along cliffs paths or contemplative strolls through wooded valleys should consider September and October. During these months, the air is crisp and fresh and the area quiet, with most tourists having already departed. However, as Wales is one of the wettest areas in the UK, you should always prepare for rain when visiting the region. Even in the summer, pack some rain gear and an umbrella in your luggage.





Famous Faces
Swansea's rich and diverse history has created a city of character, which has proved to be very fertile ground for producing well known personalities. In the literary world, Martin Amis and Dylan Thomas were born in the city and inscriptions of Thomas' verses can been found throughout the city. The Oscar award-winning actress Catherine Zeta-Jones was born and raised here, as were actors Joanna Page and Matt Ryan. The 1970s and 80s rock sensation Bonnie Tyler is also from Swansea and still lives in the seaside suburb of Mumbles. Sir Harry Secombe, who entertained the country for decades, hails from Swansea's East Side, and also in the entertainment world, the TV playwright and producer Russell T. Davies (of Doctor Who fame) has his roots in the city, as does composer Sir Karl Jenkins and Ian Hislop (captain of BBC quiz show Have I Got News for You  and editor of Private Eye). In the upper echelons of religion, economics, politics, and royalty, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Rowan Williams, Nobel Prize winner Professor Clive Granger, former deputy-prime minister, Sir Michael Heseltine, former leader of the Conservative Party, Michael Howard and Princess Lilian of Sweden, were all born in Swansea, while among the city's most famous contributions to the sporting world were the soccer legend, John Charles, England cricketer Simon Jones and former WBO world cruiser weight champion, Enzo Maccarinelli.
Within a few miles of Swansea is the birthplace of Hollywood legends Richard Burton, Anthony Hopkins and Ray Milland, and opera stars Katherine Jenkins and Paul Potts.
The city's most loved character, however, is undoubtedly Jack the black retriever. During his seven years of life, he rescued at least 27 people from drowning in the murky waters of Swansea docks, and there is a small memorial in honour of this little hero on the foreshore, near the St. Helen's Stadium.

Talk[edit]
Although it definitely has character, Swansea dialect (especially from east-side) can be hard to understand for the uninitiated.
The following usages are to be heard in Swansea:

bye-yer = here (example: "Put it bye-yer" means "Put it here.")
ewe = you (example: "Alright, arr ewe?" means "Are you OK?")
likes = like, (example: "I likes it" means "I like it")
now = often used as an affirmative, not be taken literally (example: "I'll come over now later" just means "I'll come over later.")
tidy = not to be mistaken as a command to clear up something, but a statement of approval, meaning "I agree" or "that is acceptable".
fair dues = to give someone credit (example: "He is not rich, but fair dues he's always happy to lend money to his friends." means "He is not rich, but give him credit. He's always happy to lend money to his friends.")
there's = that's, how or what (example: "There's lovely" means "That's beautiful" or "How nice", whereas "There's a mess!" would in more standard English be expressed as "What a mess!")
butt/butty = friend/buddy.  (example: "How're you doing, butt?" means "How are you doing, mate/friend?")
mun = used at the end of a statement for emphasis purposes (example: "Hurry up, mun, or we'll be late").
cowin' lush = not to confused with a fertile plain for herbivores, but a statement akin to approval (example: "That curry I 'ad last night was cowin' lush mun".
Evening Po = an abbreviated term for Evening Post (the Swansea evening newspaper) called out by road side vendors.
In addition, there is a tendency for those with a strong accent to speak in the third person. So if someone walks up to you and says, "eye nose ewe", don't be surprised. They are merely expressing the fact that they recognize you (i.e. "I know you")!
The Swansea accent is more noticeable in blue collar areas of the city, whereas in more affluent areas people speak with a more refined Welsh accent. However, even in these areas Wenglish phrases like "Uch a fi!" (dirty) can still be heard.
About 16% of Swansea's population can speak and read Welsh in addition to English, though the majority of these are residents of the northern suburbs (i.e. those closest to the counties of Powys and Carmarthenshire). People from the original town of Swansea, east-side, Mumbles and South Gower were not traditionally Welsh speaking, and so there are far fewer Welsh speakers in these areas.

See[edit]
Landmarks[edit]
Oystermouth Castle, Mumbles, Swansea
51.6203-3.94121 Swansea Castle. The ruins of this 13th-century castle are in the city centre. While the remains are not substantial enough to warrant a special visit, the contrast of the battlements against the more contemporary architecture of its surroundings does provide an interesting backdrop for souvenir photographs of Swansea city centr. The building is floodlit at night.   
51.614167-3.9602782 The Guildhall. This elegant building of white Portland stone has graced the city centre's western approach since 1934. The main building only houses administrative offices and is of no interest to the casual visitor. However, Sir Frank Brangwyn's murals (painted for the House of Lords, but considered too frivolous) that grace the interior of the Brangwyn Hall are definitely worth viewing. The Brangwyn Hall is on the sea-facing side of the building and functions as the city's main concert and reception hall.   
51.594076-4.1796033 Arthur's Stone (Cefn Bryn, Gower). A neolithic burial chamber or cromlech dating from 2500BCE.  
51.6203-3.96554 Dylan Thomas' Childhood Home, 5 Cwmdonkin Dr. Uplands. Restored to reflect the environment of Dylan's youth, Number Five Cwmdonkin Drive is open as a self-catering guest house, and is suitable for budding writers. 
51.57645-4.002975 Oystermouth Castle. Mumbles. The castle was founded in the early 12th century by William de Londres of Ogmore and was constructed of ringwork and bailey. In the 13th century, the castle was the principal residence of the de Braoses, the lords of Gower (their other main residence was Swansea Castle), and most of the structure remaining today originates from this period. King Edward I visited the castle in December 1284. The present day remains are well preserved and the battlements offer commanding views over Swansea Bay. There is a small entry fee.   
Swansea Guildhall
51.569722-3.9802786 Mumbles Pier. Mumbles. Built in the 1880s to encourage more passengers to use the Mumbles Train, the pier is an edifice to the Victorians' love of the ocean. Compared to many piers around the country, Mumbles is quite simple in design, but the 255-m walk from beginning to end allows for spectacular views over Swansea Bay. In particular, Oystermouth Castle and the high rise buildings of the city centre are in clear view.   
Historical buildings. Much of Swansea city centre was destroyed in wartime bombing. Still, there are large pockets of the historic centre that survived, and they have been painstakingly restored. Some of the best examples of Georgian and Victorian architecture can be found on Wind Street (pronounced Wined), with Salubrious Passage (linking Wind Street with Princess Way) being almost exclusively Georgian, though the accolade for oldest buildings in that area goes to Swansea Castle and the Cross Keys (inn), which are respectively relics of the 13th and 14th centuries. At the bottom end of Wind Street and across the main thoroughfare leading from the M4 into Swansea are several lovely Georgian terraces, with Somerset Place and Cambrian Place perhaps being the most stylish. The Dylan Thomas Centre on Somerset Place also represents a fine example of Doric style Georgian architecture, and the area (which leads onto the marina) also has an impressive mixture of Victorian and Edwardian buildings, such as the colonnaded neo-classical style Swansea Museum (1841) and Morgan's Hotel (1903). Across town, Alexandra Road offers some fine examples of baroque revival Edwardian architecture, with the Glynn Vivian Art Gallery acting as the focal point. British visitors may immediately recognize some of Swansea's historic streets as they have been featured in the popular TV series Doctor Who.

Driving[edit]
There are some wonderfully picturesque drives in Swansea. Below are a couple of popular ones:

City centre - Mayals - Bishopston - Caswell Bay - Langland Bay - Bracelet Bay - Limeslade Bay- Mumbles - city centre.
To start this drive, take the A4067 Mumbles Road from the city centre and turn right onto B4436 Mayals Road. Follow road over Fairwood Common and take a left at Bishopston Village. From there, follow signs for the above places.
This drive takes in some beautiful coastal scenery. Recommended stops: Verdis café (Mumbles, Swansea Bay sea front), Castellamare café (Bracelet Bay sea front), and Mumbles Village (see listing under 'See').

City centre - Uplands - Killay - Parkmill - Reynolston - Rhossili - Llangeneth - Oldwalls - Killay - Uplands - city centre.
To start this drive, take A4118 through the bed-sit suburb of Uplands and then Killay. Finally, after leaving Upper Killay, the road passes through the heart of the Gower Peninsular. Follow signs for the above places.
This drive passes through some quintessential British countryside and culminates at stunning Rhossili Bay. Recommended stops: Parkmill is the location of the Gower Heritage Centre, with its working water wheel, and Shepards' village store and café is a good place to take refreshment. Near the village of Reynolston, you can take a short detour onto Cefn Bryn to see Arthur's Stone (see listing under 'See'). Also, in Reynolston is the beautifully renovated country inn, 'the King Arthur's Hotel', which is an excellent place for lunch. At Rhossili, there are tea houses, but the attraction here is definitely the stunning views.
As you drive along the beautiful country lanes with the smell of freshly cut grass pervading the air and the vista of a wide blue bay opening before you, the words of a famous Buddhist master — 'the journey is the goal' — will never ring truer!

General[edit]
The Quadrant Centre and Oxford Street are the main shopping centres, and host all the usual department and chain stores. Between these two areas lies the much more interesting city market. Although housed in a modern building, Swansea Market can trace its history back to medieval times, and is the largest market in Wales. It is also a good place to purchase the local delicacy, laverbread. Laverbread requires refrigeration to keep fresh. If travelling, request vacuum-packed or canned.
On the edge of the city centre is an array of large, utilitarian shopping centres collectively known as Parc Tawe. Within the complex there is also a UCI multiscreen cinema and bowling alley. Parc Fforestfach is an out-of-town shopping centre that houses several huge retail stores. And, for night owls, the huge Tesco supermarkets between the Quadrant Centre and Oystermouth Road in the city centre, Parc Fforestfach and Llansamlet are all open 24 hours.

High Street (near the junction with College Street) has several stores specialising in backpack and hiking equipment. So, if your tent is springing a leak or your hiking shoes wearing thin, this is the best place to replenish your equipment before heading into the wild Welsh countryside. High Street is Swansea's creative hub, and so among the theatres and galleries, there are also niche shops.

Laverbread for sale in Swansea Market
Ice-cream. Due to an influx of Italian families into the area during the early 20th century, Swansea has developed quite a reputation for its tubs and cones. While there are several excellent brands, the nationally acclaimed Joe's Ice-cream[dead link] is by far the most famous, and their parlours are venerable institutions in the city.

Drink[edit]
Swansea's busiest and liveliest watering hole is on historic Wind Street (appropriately pronounced Wined) and surrounding area, which is also the home to many of Swansea's best restaurants.
Wind Street marks the centre of the city's night club and bar area, and on a Friday or Saturday night the words of Dylan Thomas, although originally referring to death, seem somehow appropriate in describing the mood of the revellers: "Do not go gentle into that good night,... burn and rave at close of day; rage, rage against the dying of the light."
Another popular watering hole is the Brynymor Road area.  This area has a more laid-back atmosphere than Wind Street and is popular with the many university students who live nearby.  There are also several excellent international restaurants in the area, serving Italian, French, Mediterranean, Thai and Indian cuisine.
Uplands is Swansea's most bohemian area and is the place to find indie restaurants, bars, and cafes, while Mumbles has some lovely old pubs and a number of distinctive cafes, many with sea views.
Coffee and tea[edit]
Swansea enjoys a wonderful cafe culture, originally sparked by an influx of Italian families to the city in the early 20th century and later expanded with the establishment of local independents.

Stay safe[edit]
Beaches and coast[edit]
As a coastal city, visitors inevitably come into contact with the sea. Be aware of local conditions before swimming or undertaking boating activities.
Among the popular beaches, Three Cliffs is dangerous for swimming due to the strong under currents caused by a tidal lagoon. Worm's Head off the tip of Rhossili Bay has also claimed many lives. Ensure that you know the times of the tides before venturing out the island. Many people have been swept away trying to return through a fast rising tide. The cliffs between the Rhosilli village and Worms Head have also claimed lives, some of the grass and earth on the cliff edge is eroding and walkers should heed local warnings and stick to the path. Indeed, care should always be taken while taking clifftop walks in the Gower.
From the beginning of May, Caswell, Langland, Bracelet and Port Eynon beaches are all patrolled by professional lifeguards during the weekends.  From June until September the beaches are patrolled 7 days a week
Advice for safe swimming:

A red flag means danger. Do not enter the water if the red flag is flying
Consider bathing at a beach that's under lifeguard protection
Don't swim alone at a deserted beach
Don't use inflatables. They are easily swept away by strong currents
If you see someone in trouble, call 999 and ask for Coastguard
Inquire about swimming conditions at local tourist offices prior to venturing to a beach without lifeguard cover
Read warning notices posted near beach access sites
The area between the red and yellow flags marks the area patrolled by lifeguards. Don't swim outside this area
Crime[edit]
Crime occurs in Swansea as in most other cities, and sensible precautions should be taken. As elsewhere in the UK, there can be drink related problems in those areas with high concentrations of pubs and clubs, such as Wind Street. In general, however, Swansea is a very safe city and violent crime is rare.

Hospitals and clinics[edit]
In an emergency, dial 999 and request ambulance service.

 Morriston Hospital, Heol Maes Eglwys, Morriston (near the M4), ☏ +44 1792 702222. The largest hospital in the city operates a specialist burns centre and accident and emergency unit.
