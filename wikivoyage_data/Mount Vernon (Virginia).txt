George Washington's Mansion, on his Mount Vernon estate
Mount Vernon is a district in Fairfax County, Virginia, situated on the Potomac River. It takes its name from the country home and plantation of George Washington, the first president of the United States of America.
Since 2008, Mount Vernon has been on UNESCO's tentative list for its structures from the 18th century. 


Understand[edit]
The Washington family acquired the land, then known as Little Hunting Creek Plantation, in the late 17th century. When Washington's elder half-brother inherited the land, he named it Mount Vernon in honor of Edward Vernon, a hero of the War of Jenkins's Ear and his commanding officer in the navy. Washington inherited the land in 1754 and had the manor house built up in phases from 1758 to 1778. In the mid-19th century, the Washington family sold it to the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association, who have since maintained it and the grounds for the benefit of the public.
