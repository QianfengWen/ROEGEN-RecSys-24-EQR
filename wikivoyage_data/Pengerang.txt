Pengerang is a peninsula at the southeastern end of Johor in Malaysia.  Officially a part of Kota Tinggi district, the name is usually used to cover everything south of Desaru, notably including the dock and immigration post at Tanjung Pengelih, the village of Kampong Pengelih and the nearby town of Sungai Rengit.


Understand[edit]
Long a sleepy backwater of fishing kampungs (villages) and the odd intrepid Singaporean cyclist, in the 2010s Pengerang has been largely taken over by the storage tanks and flare stacks of the Pengerang Integrated Petroleum Complex, an integrated downstream oil and gas processing facility, which also includes the Petronas Teluk Ramunia Yard.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
The town does not have its own airport. The nearest airport is the Senai International Airport (JHB IATA) in Senai, or you can fly into Singapore's Changi Airport and cross the border into Malaysia.

By car[edit]
Sungai Rengit is around 35 km south of Desaru, or 120 km from Johor Bahru. With the Senai-Desaru Expressway now open, the journey from Johor Bahru to Desaru is less than 1 hour.

By bus[edit]
RAPID bus 808 travels from Larkin Bus Terminal in Johor Bahru to Bandar Penawar in Desaru and onward to Sungei Rengit twice a day.

By boat[edit]
Tanjung Pengelih Passenger Jetty
While there are ferry terminals at both Tanjung Pengelih and Tanjung Belungkor, as of September 2022, the only operational service is from Batam Centre in Indonesia.  Services from Singapore remain suspended.

1.369801104.0887431 Tanjung Pengelih Passenger Jetty (Jeti Penumpang Tanjung Pengelih). The other option is to take a "bumboat" from Changi Point Ferry Terminal (not Changi Ferry Terminal) to Tanjung Pengelih (signposted as "Pengerang"). These boats have no set schedule, leaving when there are 12 passengers, or enough passengers to pony up for the remaining seats. Arriving at 7 AM sharp when the terminal opens is the best way to avoid delays, otherwise you may be in for a long wait. The rickety, slow and uncomfortable wooden bumboats (S$11/person, 75 min one-way) have now been largely displaced by faster, modern, air-conditioned fibreglass boats which are well worth the small premium (S$13/person, 35 min one-way).  As of June 2022, bumboat service remains suspended, but will likely restart soon — call ☏ +65 65451616 (Singapore) to enquire. (updated Nov 2019)
Get around[edit]

Public transport options in Pengerang are basically non-existent.  Taxis shuttle between the Tg Pengelih dock and Sungai Rengit for negotiable prices: the opening gambit is RM 40, but you may or may not been able to haggle a better price.
Bicycles can be rented in Sungai Rengit, or you can rent one at Changi and bring it with you.
