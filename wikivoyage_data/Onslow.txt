Onslow is a port in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, with a population of 848 in 2016. Its main trade was historically wool: there's also salt extraction and natural gas but this has never been a big mineral port like Dampier or Port Hedland. The main visitor attraction is diving and fishing off the nearby Mackerel Islands.
The town is named for Sir Alexander Onslow (1842-1908), who was Chief Justice of Western Australia but fell out with the Governor, Legislative Council and press. They tried to fob him off on some other luckless colony such as Cyprus (though South Georgia would have suited better) before hitting upon the obvious solution, to shower him with honours and pension him off. 
The Tourist Office is Onslow Tourism & Progress Association on Second Avenue, tel +61 8 9184 6644.

See[edit]
Salt lagoons fringe Onslow
Onslow Point has a lookout at the end of Second Avenue, with Sunset Beach west and Sunrise Beach east. Here or along First Avenue is a viewing point for the staircase to the moon. This is a natural effect seen on the Pilbara coast March-Oct on the full moon spring tides - water caught between the ripples on the mudflats exposed at low tide creates the image of a golden staircase towards the rising moon. Viewing times are published locally, eg by the Tourist Office.
 Goods Shed Museum, 52 Second Avenue (at Tourist Office). Apr-Dec daily 10:00-15:00. When Onslow relocated in 1925, its stone buildings were left behind but the wooden goods shed was lugged over by camel train. Also brought here were some of the old narrow-gauge railway stock; and it later acquired other artefacts, memorabilia and a large collection of shells. Adult $2. (updated Mar 2022)
-21.7195115.09691 Termite mounds stud the landscape as you drive into town. You're encouraged to pull into the viewing area, to let the termites have a good look at you. You then cross the salt lagoons that fringe Onslow, lurid lagoons and glistening white pyramids.
-21.6966115.00352 Wheatstone is an oil and gas facility on the coast 12 km west of town. Operated by Chevron, it extracts from four fields 225 km offshore, in 70 m of water. The gas is purified and cooled into LNG then piped to the tanker port at Karratha. Tours are available once a month May-Oct, check with the Tourist Office for dates and bookings.
-21.712114.94943 Old Onslow is a ghost town, the ruins of the original settlement of 1885. It exported wool through its jetty on the Ashburton River, but this suffered repeated cyclone damage and silting. In 1924 a new jetty was built at Beadon Creek, and Onslow moved to its present site, leaving the winds to sough through the old town. The main ruins are the gaol, courthouse, police station and quarters, and cemetery. They're free to wander 24 hours.
-21.4571154 Thevenard Island is 22 km north of Onslow, a low scrub 6 km long by 1 km wide. At its east tip are a resort hotel, airstrip, jetty and desalination plant, plus some ugly remnants of the offshore oil and gas industry which are gradually being removed. The reason to visit is the excellent coral reef, for diving, snorkelling and fishing. Thevenard is the largest of ten atolls and islets unofficially called the Mackerel Islands.
-21.535115.1295 Direction Island is the second largest, lying 10 km out from Onslow. It's 1 km across, the shape of a flounder not a mackerel, and has basic cabin accommodation. In 2022 this is closed and the ferry is not running, but the island is within range of boat trips from town.
-20.798115.12856 Barrow Island is 50 km out; this has given it some protection from introduced species and it's a nature reserve. Liveaboard boat trips sometimes visit for fishing, but it's beyond a day-trip. There's a large Chevron oil and gas facility and only company-authorised visitors may land. See Karratha for the Montebello Islands further northeast.
