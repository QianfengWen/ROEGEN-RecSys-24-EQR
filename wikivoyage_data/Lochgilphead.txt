Lochgilphead is a town at the head of Loch Gilp, an inlet of Loch Fyne. It's the administrative centre of Argyll and Bute on the west coast of Scotland, and in 2021 had a population of 2240. The town is not scenic, but it's worth spending a day or two to see the megaliths at Kilmartin, the Crinan Canal, and the scenic Tayvallich peninsula.

See[edit]
"Aengus son of Fergus, king of the Picts, laid waste the territory of Dál Riata and seized Dún At and burned Creic and bound in chains two sons of Selbach, i.e. Donngal and Feradach."
- Annals of Ulster for 736 AD indicate that Dunadd was a royal stronghold, but not strong enough.
56.0259-5.421631 Kilmory Castle  half a mile south of Lochgilphead is a mansion built in the 1830s. It's now the offices of Argyll and Bute Council, so you can only go in on council business, and some parts are in poor repair. The castle grounds are open as a park, with a riot of rhododendrons in early summer, and woodland walks around Kilmory Loch.
56.09-5.5562 Crinan on the Atlantic coast is the west terminus of the Crinan Canal, which stretches for nine miles from Ardrishaig 1½ miles south of Lochgilphead. It was completed in 1801 to create a shortcut for small craft, especially the "Clyde Puffers", avoiding the stormy Mull of Kintyre. It remains navigable and there's a good towpath for walking or cycling.
Duntrune Castle on the shore a mile north of Crinan is private property.
Castle Dounie a mile south of Crinan is the rubble of an Iron Age hillfort, but it's worth coming for the views. The start of the walk by the shore is covered at the highest tides.

His rebellion in Scotland and the Monmouth rebellion in England tried to overthrow King James II/VII. James crushed both rebellions and executed the rebels, but he was ousted in 1688 by the Hanoverian dynasty and his Jacobite faction was now on the wrong side of history. Free.   (updated Jul 2023)
