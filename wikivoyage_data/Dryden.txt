Dryden is Ontario's smallest incorporated city (population 7,400 in 2021). It is 140 km (90 mi) east of Kenora on the Trans-Canada Highway in northern Ontario.


Understand[edit]

Dryden was established in 1895 on the north shore of Wabigoon Lake as the site of an experimental farm. It was named for a minister of government of the era. At the time, access to the community was primarily by rail. From 1910-2008, the city's primary industry was paper manufacturing; the local population reached a peak of just under 8200 people before the mill closed.
An oversized Maximillian the Moose stands at the centre of town at the visitor’s centre.
Dryden and Kenora are the only incorporated Ontario cities to use the Central time zone (GMT-6), due to their location: geographically closer to Winnipeg than to southern Ontario.
