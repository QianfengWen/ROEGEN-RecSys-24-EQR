Kampot is a relaxed riverside town in southeast Cambodia. It is the durian capital of Cambodia, a gateway to Bokor National Park, and is near popular farms growing well-known Kampot pepper. It is also a popular sex-tourism destination.

Understand[edit]
Kampot's main draw is its relaxing riverside setting. While there is a sizable town (population approximately 40,000) set back from the river, most tourists will spend most of their time enjoying the river. Most tourist businesses are scattered along the riverside promenade or are within one or two blocks of it. The riverside's main reference points are the "old bridge", a mongrel of various styles and temporary parts thrown together after its breaching in the Khmer Rouge days, and the French-built market building, which is being restored. Back from the river, the town is centered on the bizarre "durian roundabout" featuring a huge statue of a durian. From where the buses drop passengers, walking down the wide boulevard leads towards the river and the French-built market.

 Kampot Survival Guide (KSG), kampotsurvivalguide@gmail.com. Be sure to pick up a copy of the Kampot Survival Guide. The substantial, 48-page compendium is issued every three months and is a hilarious, entertaining, yet thorough guide to Kampot. It's written by people who live in and know Kampot and to say it is full of good info is an understatement. Available online, but not as useful as a hard copy. Free. (updated Jun 2019)
Kampot in the 2020s has grown to attract a certain crowd, namely older white men from various western countries, and the town has developed to serve this market. You might call them sex pests, and they are everywhere. Girl bars have sprung up along the boulevards. If you are male and foreign, expect to be catcalled on the street in the evening. It is still a charming river town with fantastic architecture, but not quite the family or young persons' destination it once was. It has a Starbucks now.

Get in[edit]
By road[edit]
The trip Phnom Penh-Kampot (148 km) can take 2½-5 hr depending on traffic and road conditions (Feb 2020).
From Ha Tien, Vietnam: As of 2024 May, online e-Visas is not accepted at Prek Chak International Border Check Point, so you will have to pay US$35, for an on-arrival visa. Visa touts will ask for US$38 to expedite the process but it's no faster as you will still need to x-ray baggage and scan fingerprint.
Travel agencies in Ha Tien including ones right by Ha Tien ferry port, can arrange minibus to Kampot for US$19. Process: Vietnam minivan takes you to Prek Chak border at which point you cross the border on foot, then on Cambodian side switch to a Cambodian minivan to continue journey, ending at Champa Mekong Travel and Tours agency on street 724 Kampot. Total trip distance about 47 km.

By bus[edit]
All of the buses, with the exception of Giant Ibis, end at the central Kampot bus station which is about 150 m from one of the main guesthouse streets in Kampot. Walk to the Salt Workers Monument and take the first turn to the left.
From Phnom Penh:

Ekareach Express - about five buses a day from Phnom Penh.
Hua Lin buses depart at 07:00 and 12:00 from their bus station on St 182 near Olympic Market via Kep to Kampot.
Sorya (air-con) buses depart at 06:45, 07:30, 09:30, 12:45, and 13:45 from their bus station next to Central Market. In the high season (Oct-May) there may be an additional bus at 09:30. The bus travels to Kampot via Kep and the trip takes about 3 hr. The fare is US$5.
Paramount Angkor Express buses depart at 07:30 and 13:30 from their bus station near Olympic Market. The bus travels directly to Kampot (does not go via Kep) and the trip takes about 3 hr. The fare is US$5
Giant Ibis buses depart at 08:00 and 14:45 from St 106 next to the Night Market on Riverside. This company promotes itself as a luxury service. Tickets are US$8 and the bus arrives at the Durian Roundabout (approximately 300 m from the bus station) in Kampot. After Kampot the bus continues to Kep.
Capitol (air-con), 07:30 and 13:00
Kampot Express uses 12 seat Hyundai Starex mini buses. They provide an 08:00 and 13:00 service on weekdays with an additional 16:30 service on Saturday and Sunday. Buses are based at St 215 in Phnom Penh at the Sokimex petrol station. The trip taking about 2½ hr depending on the traffic leaving Phnom Penh. The fare is US$8 and additional baggage fees may apply.
M.T.T. (call/text TOM on mobile: +855 16 994161) daily air-con vans serving all most destinations twice, plus Trat, Thailand
While there is no difference in the fares charged for locals and foreigners on the Phnom Penh-Kampot route, fares generally increase for everyone during major public holidays/celebrations.
From Sihanoukville:
Take a shared taxi, minibus or bus. Most taxis depart from the traffic pickup point next to the market. The 2-hr drive should cost US$5 to US$8 per person in a shared taxi. Bus operators can help arrange a minibus with pickup at your guesthouse. Shared taxis are generally cramped, with up to 7 passengers: 4 in the back, 2 in the front passenger seat and one next to the driver.
Driving from Sihanoukville to Kampot on a rented scooter can be fun, but if road conditions are poor may take 3½ hours or more.

By taxi[edit]
Many guesthouses in Phnom Penh can arrange a private taxi. Expect to pay between US$35-50 for the whole taxi with the trip taking about 2½ hr. Prices will generally be higher during major public holidays and you will almost certainly be quoted a higher price if you attempt to negotiate the fare yourself with one of the taxis at Phnom Penh airport.
There are also shared taxis (US$5-8 per seat) that regularly ply the route between Phnom Penh and Kampot and your guesthouse/hotel should be able to arrange a seat for you. If you want to make your own arrangements, taxis generally depart from Psar Damkor. A shared taxi, generally a Toyota Camry, on this route will normally carry eight people (including the driver) so if you are a large Westerner, have a lot of luggage or have issues with your personal space, you might want to book two seats (thus double price), preferably at the front of the taxi.

By train[edit]
10.6267104.18911 Kampot Railway Station (ស្ថានីយន៍រថភ្លើងខេត្តកំពត), ☏ +855 99222566. The daily train between Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville (and back) stops here in either direction. (updated Jun 2021)
Connections from:

Phnom Penh – 07:00, 3¾ hr, US$9
Takeo – 08:40, 2 hr, US$7
Kep – 10:20, ½hr, US$4
Sihanoukville – 14:00, 2 hr, US$6
By boat[edit]
The Crab Shuttle is a converted local fishing vessel which sails between Kampot and Kep (trip time 2 hr 20 min). It leaves Kampot at 09:00 from the riverside in front of Rikitikitavi Hotel. It departs Kep at 15:00 from the pier to Rabbit Island to be back in Kampot by sunset.

Get around[edit]
Map of Kampot
Getting around Kampot is easy on foot or on a bicycle, given the town's small size and flat terrain. Or, hire a motorcycle (100-125 cc scooter or 250 cc dirt bike, from US$5 per day) or bicycle (from US$1 per day) from hire shops near the durian traffic circle, or from just about any guesthouse or tour shop.
You can hire a tuk-tuk or a taxi using the PassApp app on your phone. (As of 2023, Grab isn't used by drivers in Kampot like it is in Phenom Penh). Unless you somehow have a Cambodian ABA Bank account, you'll be paying cash. Exact change helps but good luck with that. 
It used to take about 2 hr by motorbike from Kampot to the Ha Tien border with Vietnam. The scenery is beautiful. If you start early you can catch the 10:00 ferry to Phu Quoc Island. The border procedure is hassle-free.

See[edit]
The most impressive sights in Kampot are the river and surrounding hills, which grandly frame views from the riverside promenade. Kampot retains many of its colonial buildings and there are many interesting old structures in various states of repair. The two cinemas stopped screenings long ago but the buildings represents a charming, art deco vision of the future. The market, an angular structure similar to Battambang's, is undergoing renovation.

 Bokor Mountain (1-2 hr out of Kampot). Bokor National Park is being destroyed by a large hotel development. The eerie charm of the abandoned French hill station that included a shell of a church and the isolated upland nature reserve are rapidly becoming a tacky resort. The road up the mountain is now paved and provides easy access. The cooler climate and sublime views from the mountain remain and may provide some reason for a visit.Animals have become much harder to spot. The waterfall, which only flows in the wet season, may still provide some sanctuary.Tours still run up the mountain and cost approximately US$10, depending on bargaining skills. Lunch is included. The excursion can still be worthwhile provided it is viewed as an insight into Cambodia's Great Leap Forward rather than as an atmospheric expedition into a remote and haunting environment.Several tracks enter the forest, one from behind the old tea plantation, the second from near the waterfalls. It is possible to stay at the ranger station which is basic but comfortable and, contrary to some reports, offers food and French wine. Free. (updated Feb 2018)
 Kampot Mangroves (From Kampot and around). A traditional Khmer longtail boat floats you to beautiful places where the flora, fauna and people dwell harmoniously. Voyage up the Kampot River and towards the heart of Bokor National Park. 
 Pepper farms (N of the Kep hills and Hwy 33). Inquire in town about how to see pepper being grown and processed. Guided tours are easy to arrange. One option is to visit The Vine Retreat in Chamcar Bei village. 
10.657417104.1473551 Durian plantations. There are lots of durian farms on the way to Teuk Chhou Rapids. It may be hard to communicate to a tuk-tuk driver that this is what you want to see, but a tourist office / travel agent can help you arrange it. There don't seem to be organized guided tours like for the pepper farms, but you can go to a plantation and ask for permission to look around – before you leave, buy some fruit as a thank-you. Even when durian is out of season it's mildly interesting; in January you can see the unripe fruit starting to grow. (updated Feb 2020)
 Phnom Chhnork (8 km E of town on the Kep Rd, Hwy 33). A pleasant ride through paddy fields and village life to these caves with pre-Angkorian (Funan) shrines and "lost worlds". Just after the rhino statue turn left (there is a sign to Phnom Chhnork Resort), cross the railway into a village. Straight ahead is Phnom Sera with some interesting caves and a quarry which feeds the local gravel industry. Follow the road 90 degrees left and 2 km or so to Wat Ang Sdok, pay the monks and walk across to the mountain. Take a torch. US$1. 
Also to be experienced is the fresh seafood (especially the crab with local Kampot pepper) and beaches at Kep (25 km, 25-45 minutes east of Kampot by moto or shared taxi) which makes a fun day trip. Although the beaches are not as nice as those in Sihanoukville (one small brown sand beach and more rocky), it is quiet and during the week you will likely be the only visitors. Fishing boats can also be taken out to Koh Tonsay (Rabbit Island), approximately 45 min from the mainland.
Cham Fishing Village, about 2 km out of town past the Governor's Residence on the road that runs along the east bank of the river. Seems to be undergoing road and bridge upgrading for the new swamp-side housing estate at the end of this road. Has a great view of the Cham fishing village across the river on the island.
Salt Fields, some are a kilometre out of town on the Kep road. You will see the fields off to your right (leaving Kampot) and there are a number of access roads.
Funky Statues, the Big Durian, the Vietnam Friendship Monument, the 2000 Roundabout, the Salt Workers Monument. Be sure to get your jump-shot photo in front of the hairy nuts.
The Two Old Cinemas, Art Deco design and both have been out of regular service for some time however the one on the old bridge road does show the occasional Khmer-made horror movie. One of the cinemas has been converted into a modern hotel. If you are an Art Deco enthusiast, the Tourist Information building, about 400 m up from the Salt Workers Monument, is also worth a look.
The Old Bridge, now closed to heavy traffic as its structural integrity is questionable. It is still open for motorcycles, bicycles and foot traffic. It is very picturesque with light bulbs at sunset.
The Colonial Railway Station, the rail line through Kampot has been restarted and is running to Sihanoukville and Phonm Penh. Head out of town on the Phnom Penh road and take the last turn to your right before you come to the rail lines. The station is sign posted and approximately 1.5 km out of town.
The Kampot Traditional Music School for Orphaned and Disabled Children, across the road from the Acleda Bank building and adjacent to the park that runs down to the Old Market. The school holds occasional concerts. There is a notice board outside the building advising dates and times. It is possible to attend music rehearsals (M-F) if you make an appointment. Tel: +855 33 932992 (Field Manager: Mr. You Chhuy)
The Old Prison was demolished in 2018. Now there are new apartment complexes in its place.
The 2000 Olympic Stadium, in the centre of town behind the Durian Roundabout. Classic Khmer-style stadium and the grounds are often used for fairs or live music concerts during public holidays.
The New Market, large, well stocked with just about everything that an average Khmer family could need (have a look at the section behind the fish mongers for examples of local produce) and well worth a wander around.
 Teuk Chhouu (8 km upriver of town on the W (far) bank). An area of rapids with eateries and an island. It is a nice place for swimming, tubing and relaxing, and vendors sell fruit, coffee and water. 
Tada Waterfall (14 km north west of Kampot), a waterfall and swimming hole on a small stream. US$1 entry fee per person for locals and foreigners.
Get out of town, head out of Kampot for 1 km in any direction and get off the main roads and you are in rural Cambodia. Some of the local cottage industries include palm sugar and wine making, basket weaving and furniture making using liana and rattan. Kep is just half an hour away by tuktuk or scooter.
Do[edit]
Take a boat trip up the river
Kampot has a relaxed and sleepy atmosphere apart from the droves of motorbike riding school children that flock here when school is in session. It is a great place to go and just soak up the atmosphere and catch your breath for a couple of days.
Do Kampot Province by dirt bike: Ride enduro style through the Elephant mountains, take on the hill climb up Bokor or relax.

 Kayak and Boat Trips. Standard Boat Tours (morning and evening cruise) available (US$5), kayak tours (US$9) or daily rent (US$7) (e.g., at Captain Chim's Guesthouse at the Old Market). Look around and compare different operators, as the boat tours range from spring break backpacker partying to calm, romantic, and family friendly. You can buy moderately priced food and drinks on board, and if you do a sunset tour you might see fireflies. 
 Minigolf (At the Magic Sponge Guesthouse). Play a few fun rounds of 9-hole mini golf for free. Have a cold beer before, during, and after. 
 Petanque (Boules). Play at Blissful for free. Have a cold beer or pastis while playing. The court is floodlit, to allow play morning, afternoon, or evening.

Buy[edit]
 Kampot Pepper. Given its reputation for quality, this is probably the most popular purchase made by visitors to Kampot. Such is its popularity that a host of imitators claim to be Kompot pepper. If you want to be confident that the pepper you buy is the genuine article, buy it from a reputable supplier. The packaging should have an authenticity logo and possibly a tracking code identifying the farm where it was grown. Black pepper, US$12-18/kg; white pepper, US$13-20/kg; red pepper, US$18-25/kg.

Banks & ATMs[edit]
It can be hard to find someone who will accept a hundred-dollar bill in Kampot. Consider withdrawing $90 when you go to an ATM.
ATMs aren't hard to find. There are a few near the durian roundabout, for instance.

Canadia Bank is at the traffic circle (Durian roundabout). These ATMs do not work with some bank cards, for example, ING Bank cards.
Acleda Bank is on Old Market Rd near Central Bus Stand.
ABA Bank is also on the old market Rd near the central bus stand.
ABA and Acleda Banks also run more single ATM booths spread around the town.
Eat[edit]
Kampot is famous for pepper and durian, both grown at farms in the area which you can visit. Kampot pepper is of course used to flavor food here and is also sold at shops and makes a good souvenir. Durian is in season in April and May; if you buy durian in Kampot in the winter, it will be imported.
A delicious breakfast found in Kampot is Koh Kor Num Pain, a thick beef stew served with French bread.
Halal food is easy to find.
