Jedburgh (pronounced "Jed-bur-uh") is a town in the Scottish Borders, ten miles north of the border with England. It's best known for its ruined abbey, while the countryside around is dotted with turrets and towerhouses from the medieval days of banditry.


Understand[edit]
In 2020 Jedburgh had a population of 3840: famous people from here include Mary Somerville (1780-1872) the scientist, David Brewster (1781-1868) optical scientist and inventor of the kaleidosope, and Greig Laidlaw (b 1985) the rugby player.

Get in[edit]
Nave of the Abbey
By car[edit]
Jedburgh is on the A68 which links Edinburgh to northeast England via a scenic, switchback road over the hills. The summit and border at Carter Bar is passable in all but the worst weather. If it's unsafe, the workaround is the low-level route from Newcastle via Wooler, Coldstream and Kelso. 

Parking[edit]
Canongate Car Park -  free - 140 spaces just as you turn off the A68 into town centre along Canon Gate. It is suitable for cars and camper vans (no overnight) and has three EV charging spaces. There are public toilets.
Friars Burn - free - 38 parking spaces for cars just behind the high street accessed from Friars Gate which is a narrow road.
Lothian Park - free - 95 spaces with room for cars coaches and HGVs next to the abbey and with a good view of it, you can also walk to the river and there is a cafe and public toilets.
Murray's Green - free - 20 car spaces directly opposite the abbey and next to the Tourist Information centre.
Jedburgh Woolen Mill - At the north end of town there are large car parks by the Jedburgh Woolen Mill.
By bus[edit]
Buses are frequent along the main transport corridor Galashiels - Tweedbank - Melrose - Newton St Boswells - Jedburgh.
Borders Bus 68 runs hourly from Galashiels via Kingsknowes (for Abbotsford), Tweedbank (for trains from Edinburgh),  Melrose and St Boswells (for Dryburgh Abbey), taking just under an hour to Jedburgh.
Borders Bus 51 runs every two hours daily from Edinburgh along the A68, via Dalkeith, Lauder (for Thirlestane Castle) and Earlston to St Boswells, where you change for Bus 68. It's quicker from Edinburgh to take the train to Tweedbank and change. 
Peter Hogg Bus 131 runs Monday to Saturday to Jedburgh along A68 / A696 from Otterburn, Newcastle Airport and  Newcastle. It runs south in the morning and returns north to Jedburgh early afternoon.

In town[edit]
55.4765-2.55511 Jedburgh Abbey, Abbey Bridge End TD8 6JQ, ☏ +44 1835 863925. Apr-Sep: 10AM-5PM, Oct-Mar: 10AM-4PM. This ruined but imposing Augustinian abbey was founded in 1138 and was a frequent target for invading English armies. It continued in use as a parish church at the Reformation in 1560, saving it from wreckage, and it served until 1871 when a new town church was built. There is a cloister and herb garden, and a visitor centre with 8th-century carvings and artefacts excavated from the abbey grounds. In 2022 the abbey interior is closed for building safety, but you can see plenty from the street. £3.50.   (updated Sep 2022)
55.4742-2.55892 Jedburgh Castle Jail, Castlegate TD8 6AS, ☏ +44 1835 864750. Apr-Oct: M-Sa 10AM-4PM, Su 10AM-3PM. The castle was demolished in 1409, but the site was rebuilt as a prison in 1823, and it's been restored to that period. The jailer's house depicts town history. "Jedburgh Justice" (hanging first, trial later) was a much earlier practice: lynch law for cattle rustlers. Donation.   (updated Apr 2022)
55.478611-2.5527783 Mary Queen of Scots House, Queen St, TD8 6EN (easily found on Queen Street that runs parallel to the High St.), ☏ +44 1835 863331. Mar-Oct: daily 10AM-4PM, Nov to 3PM. This is a 16th-century tower house. In 1566 Mary, Queen of Scots stayed here, and made a long excursion to visit the wounded Earl of Bothwell out at Hermitage Castle. On return she was taken seriously ill, the cause isn't known, but she eventually recovered and returned to Edinburgh. There are "Mary QoS slept here" sites all over Scotland, but that was normal for a peripatetic medieval ruler, especially one with multiple enemies that she needed to stay ahead of. Donation.   (updated Sep 2022)
Old and Trinity Church south across the main road from the abbey was the replacement of 1875. This was the mainstream Church of Scotland, but there were great schisms and sects and separate churches in that era; they made up and re-united in 2007.
Canongate Bridge is a charming 16th-century bridge over Jed Water mid-town. It's now just a footpath, but it was the main road into town until about 1800.
Jedburgh Library was one of many endowed by philanthropist tycoon Andrew Carnegie. The first in Jedburgh was on High St from 1894, then it re-located to this larger building from 1900.
Greyfriars Garden on The Friars a block west of High St is on the site of the 15th century Franciscan Friary. It's been restored as a monastic garden of that time.

Nearby[edit]
55.4963-2.57844 Timpendean Tower on A698 west is the stump of a 15th-century towerhouse. There's nowhere to park nearby.
55.4801-2.6635 Fatlips Castle north of the Teviot is a 16th-century peel tower. It was renovated in 2013 and is private property — you maybe don't want the slobbery traditional greeting that gave rise to the name.
Barnhills Tower half a mile east is of similar date but well ruined.
55.5147-2.55766 Monteviot, Ancrum TD8 6UH, ☏ +44 1835 830830. Garden Apr-Oct: daily noon-5PM. The 18th-century mansion is the home of the Marquess of Lothian (Michael Ancram, b 1945). It's occasionally open, but not in 2022. The extensive gardens are the attraction. Assistance dogs only. Garden £6.  (updated Apr 2022)
 Waterloo Monument (it is on private land; walkers may park at the Harestanes Visitor Centre and then follow the marked walk to the top of the hill). The tower is not open to the public, although a key to the monument can be borrowed at a small cost from the Lothian Estates Office in nearby Bonjedward.  (updated Sep 2022)
Ancrum Caves west of Monteviot were etched out of a bluff for Border thieves to hide their plunder. They've become eroded by landslip and are unsafe to approach.
55.5336-2.61527 Monteath Mausoleum is seen from A68 on the ridge north of Liliardsedge — that's probably the closest you'll view it as there's nowhere to park. It was built in 1864 for General Sir Thomas Monteath Douglas, who defended Jalalabad in the First Anglo-Afghan War of 1842.
Capon Oak Tree is 500 years old
55.5077-2.41418 Cessford Castle towards Kelso is the ruin of a 15th-century L-plan tower house. Its owners the Kerrs were notorious border bandits, but they went upmarket in 1650, becoming Dukes of Roxburghe, moving to Floors Castle and abandoning Cessford.
55.4674-2.47399 Oxnam Kirk is from the 17th century and still in use. The tiny village was on the main road 1900 years ago: the Roman Dere Street crossed the Cheviots 5 miles east of the modern A68 route. You'll need an archaeologist's eye to make out Pennymuir Camp south towards the crest. This was a Roman "marching camp", not intended as a permanent structure.
55.4622-2.554610 Capon Oak Tree is 500 years old and looks it, like a Struldbrugg beauty queen held together by masonry and metal beams. It's one of the last survivors of the Caledonian primeval forest. But the sandstone bluffs along the nearby riverbank show how relatively young that tree is: the strata are vertical, overlain by horizontal. The geologist James Hutton (1726-97) realised that this "unconformity" couldn't be the result of simple sedimentation. Some vast gradual upheaval had occurred, and the earth must be much older than had been supposed.
55.4543-2.5512411 Ferniehirst Castle (two miles south of town on A68). It is a 15th-century L-plan fortified mansion. It's been much smashed up but restored in the 19th and 20th centuries. It can be visited by pre-booked guided tour in July, and occasionally hires out for functions at other times.   (updated Feb 2024)
55.3545-2.478112 Carter Bar on A68 is the border with England. There's a large layby, and in summer ice-cream and burger vans and busking bagpipers greet the coach tours. The view south into Northumbria is a lonely moorland, north is better with the quiltwork of forests and fields, and triple-peaked Eildon hills. The ridge blocks the view west. East you look over the long spine of border hills to The Cheviot, bleak and often cloud-wreathed. See Kirk Yetholm if you want to climb it or embark on the Pennine Way.
