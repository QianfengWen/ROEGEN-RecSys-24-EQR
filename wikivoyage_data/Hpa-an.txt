Hpa-an (Karen ဖးအါ၀့ၢ်ဖိ; Burmese ဘားအံမြို့) is a city (population 421,575 as of 2014) in Kayin State (Karen State) in Southeastern Myanmar. Hpa-an is the capital of Kayin State. It is surprisingly underdeveloped given its relative proximity to Mawlamyine and Yangon but this can be explained by the fact that the area has been in conflict with the Government for many years and has only become relatively peaceful since a ceasefire in 2012.


Understand[edit]
Hpa-an with mountains in the back
With the expected completion of the Greater Mekong Subregion East-West Corridor at the end of 2015, when improvements to the road between Mae Sot in Thailand and Mawlamyine are due to be finalised, Hpa-an will have great prospects to export to Thailand, and the town and surrounding region are likely to boom.

Get in[edit]
There is no train so only road travel is possible. From specific destinations:

Mawlamyine – Bus (no air-con) is about 2 hr, 1,200 kyat. There is also a boat available from Mawlamyine to Hpa-an for 70,000 kyat (private charter) or 10,000 kyat per person (shared) leaving from 16.89343897.63021 Hpa-an Jetty at 08:00 and taking about 3 hr.
Myawaddy – The bus is about 5,000 kyat and takes 3-5 hr. There are also many shared taxis running between Hpa-an and Myawaddy for 10,000 kyat per person which take around 4 hr.
Kyaiktiyo (Golden Rock) – Bus with air-con is about 2½-3 hr to Kyaikto, 5-7,000 kyat. Every 30 min from about 06:00-10:00, then at least every hour for the rest of the day. A slower direct "government" bus leaves at 07:30, but it's probably more comfortable to change in Kyaikto.
Dawei – Bus leaves 05:00, 14,000 kyat.
Buses also come in from Yangon (Aung Mingalar Highway Station, 6 hr, about 5,000 kyat, every 30-60 min) and Bago.
Buses from Bagan, Naypyidaw and Mandalay, tend to go directly to Mawlamyine through 16.91955597.3687452 Thaton. Nevertheless, from the 16.91498397.3697053 Golden Pagoda in Thaton it is easy to catch a pickup (1,500 kyat) or bus (2,000 kyat) to Hpa-an. Also, 16.91600997.3582334 trains stop in Thaton, but not Hpa-an.
The 16.88903497.6344595 Clock Tower is the main transport hub for travelers. Shared taxis and buses leave and stop here. Ticket-sellers congregate here.
There is also the official 16.86568897.6604166 Sat Pyit Kwin Bus Terminal, just in case you do not get dropped off at the clock tower or are keen to get your bus ticket first-hand.

Get around[edit]
16°49′41″N 97°39′11″EMap of Hpa-an
By taxi[edit]
Especially around the market and the ferries, plenty of motorbike-taxis and trishaws are available. Do not pay more than 1,000 kyat for destinations within the city. Trips to the countryside for a couple of hours should not cost more than 5,000 kyat for a trishaw.
Shared tuktuk (max 6 pax) cost ~35,000 kyat for one whole day (07:00-18:00). It takes you to all places of interest except Bat Caves. Petrol & toll are inclusive.

By rental motorbike[edit]
It is easy to rent a motorbike; some hostels like Galaxy Motel and Soe Brother can arrange them (~ 8.000 kyat/day) from 07:00 onwards.

See[edit]
16.89400397.6310691 Shweyinhmyaw Paya. This pagoda at the north-west end of town has nice views of the sunset. You can watch from a viewing tower or at the side of the river next to the pagoda. 
16.88268497.6311512 Kan Thar Yar Lake. This lake in the lower part of the city and its wooden bridge are recommended in the evening. 
16.8282397.705733 Kaw Ka Taung Cave (Follow the main road east (it turns southeast later) from the Clock Tower for 10.5 km). This is a small and low cave built using tiles and filled with numerous small and big Buddhas. Bring a torch since there is something in the end to explore. Going further just by the cave, after 200 m there is a nice swimming pool with very clear water from the mountain and hundreds of fish in it, circled by half a dozen restaurants right next to beautiful rice fields. Take a swim and get off the salt. 
16.83035197.713324 Mat Ka Na Bridge & Village (Further into the countryside along the main track by Kaw Ka Taung Cave). Sometimes also spelled Lat Ka Na. This concrete bridge is a famous and picturesque destination. Explore the village behind the bridge. 
16.7400597.718455 Saddan Cave (Saddar Cave, Sadan Cave, Seren Cave) (300 m east of the Clock Tower turn right into Ka Lar Tan Street and follow this street south for about 14 km. Then this road does a 90° turn left; after another 500 m there is a gravel road to the right marked with a small green sign pointing south towards the cave.). Sunrise to sunset. A huge cave filled with a Buddha face looking rock, a reclining Buddha statue, a pagoda and many more Buddhist items. There is lighting nowadays but do not forget (ǃ) to bring along your shoes when entering the cave, to walk further and through after the pagoda part (around 500 m). At the other end there are boats waiting for a nice trip on the lake and another cave (about 1,000 kyat). Alternatively, you can eat something at the nearby restaurant. 1,000 kyat donation demanded.   
16.79010397.6872786 Yae Ta Khon (200 m east of the Clock Tower take the second main road (Ka Lar Tan St) south for 12.8 km (before the 90° bend south of the main road)). A nice swimming pool in a cool surrounding. Unfortunately, women are not allowed to swim in the upper pool. Following up the hill to the right of the pool there are many white pagodas standing in a geometrical and quite picturesque order. 
16.80714497.6715127 Lumbini Garden (2.6 km north of Yae Ta Khon). A nice looking "garden" with 1,150 sitting and quadratically placed Buddhas at the foot of Zwegabin mountain. In early 2017 a cable car was inaugurated to get a glance of the garden from above. 4,000 kyat for foreigners. 
View from Mount Zwegabin at dawn
16.8241697.668048 Mount Zwegabin (Mount Zwe Kabin). From the top it offers a spectacular 360° views of the surrounding planes, especially when the air is still clear, i.e. in the morning and during wet season. It takes up to 4 hr to walk up the 723 m mountain and down again. Bring enough water for the climb and heat. There are at least two main tracks, one leading up north from "Lumbini Garden" and another one going down and east towards the main road that serves Kaw Ka Taung Cave, Ein Du village and Saddan Cave. However it will be hard to use both tracks if you come with rented motorbike. After an accident in February 2017 it is not possible to stay overnight at the top.   
Kyauk Kalap Pagoda
16.81822997.6404769 Kyauk Kalap. A monastery in the middle of an artificial lake filled with uncountable amounts of small (jumping around) and big fish (sticking out their mouths). It contains a pillar-like and interestingly stable or to say impossibly still standing rock with a pagoda mounted on top. Looks very nice for a couple of pictures. The rock can be climbed. Before the lake another golden temple with a nice looking Buddha statue can be visited. Free.  
16.82291597.58473110 Kaw Goon Cave (After crossing the bridge towards Thaton go left/southwest and drive 3.8 km until the end of the road.). Besides the Saddan Cave, this is also a very famous cave and worth the visit, causing the steep price. The rock carvings are said to originate from the 13th century. If you are not keen to pay the entrance, climb the close lookout for free. It may be possible to skip the "donation" check by keeping to the left and walking behind the buildings facing the main path. Watch out for the monkeys. 3,000 kyat "donation".   (updated Jan 2019)
16.835297.57044311 Ya-The-Byan Cave (On the road towards Kaw Goon Cave from the bridge after 2.5 km take the road to the west, straight for another 2.5 km). The entrance to this cave is 116 feet above sea level. Stemming back from the 17th century. With three Buddha images (standing and sitting), nearly 5 feet in height. It is located close to the village with the same name. Top of the hill exit has an amazing sunset view deck. 
Hpa-An bat cave at sunset
16.84873897.61123412 Bat Cave (9 km away from the city. Take the first "road" to the right directly after the end of the bridge towards Thaton before the control point. Keep driving until you're close to the river and turn left at the T junction (there should be a sign). Drive until the gate and walk the rest until the end passing by the temple. Be especially careful when driving back in the dark.). This used to be a great experience and impressive nature spectacle when an endless stream of 100,000s of bats came flying out of their cave at sunset (check the sunset time). However locals seem to dislike the colony and each evening departure sit banging drum & shacking noisy rattle which disturbs the bat departure causing bats to emerge and scatter rather than forming the dramatic ribbon formation (the "ribbon" formation eventually reforms some distance away). The bats start coming out of the cave almost exactly at sunset, and the whole spectacle now takes less than 1 hr (although the vast majority of bats fly out of the cave in the first 10 min). Bring patience and a torch (for the walk back). Go a bit earlier and climb up the nearby hill in front of the cave with a stupa on top to have a stunning view of the river and countryside. The best place to see the bats is near the stupa at the base of the stairs. About 5,000 kyat for a taxi to get there and back from Hpa-an. It can also be booked as a tour with most of the guest houses. 1,000 kyat. (updated Jan 2019)
16.97038897.49357213 Bayin Nyi Cave (22 km from the bridge on the way to Thaton). Placed in a beautiful surrounding with a nearby lake and pagoda. 
Do[edit]
Hpa-an is famous for its numerous surrounding caves, mountains and green planes. Most guesthouses organise tours to those (like Soe Brothers and Golden Sky) - full-day trips cost 30,000 kyat (for up to 6 people). In case you arrive late, the Bat Cave evening tour is a highly recommended choice. However, you can also easily explore everything on your own by renting a motorbike from many guesthouses, e.g. Soe Brothers, Galaxy Hotel, Lwin Pyar Guesthouse or Good Luck Motorbike Rental next to Soe Brothers. It takes about a day (without the 4 hr climb of Zwegabin mountain) and the rental costs about 6,000 kyat - depending on the season. Fuel will set you back by another 1,000-1,500 kyat. No road or bridge toll is required on a scooter or bicycle. Below are two recommendations for a day-trip by scooter.

Route of Extensive day trip by scooter
Extensive day trip by scooter[edit]
Leaving Hpa-an early at 8:30 and returning around 19:00. The journey has a length of about 75 km (47 mi). The gpx track is attached to this page.
Kaw Ka Taung Cave, Mat Ka Na Bridge & Village, Saddan Cave, Yae Ta Khon, Lumbini Garden, next Kyauk Kalap to the west, then Kawgoon Cave as well as Ya-The-Byan Cave, and last but not least the Bat Cave for a lasting sunset & bat experience. Probably there will not be enough time to climb Mount Zwegabin from Lumbini garden, if you want to visit all sights listed above.

Relaxed day trip  by scooter[edit]
For a slightly less demanding tour try this 62 km (39 mi) round-trip. Sightseeing stops are Ya-The-Byan Cave (monkeys), Kaw Goon Cave, Kyauk Kalap, Lumbini Garden, Yae Ta Khon pool (for lunch - 1,500-2,000 kyat), Mat Ka Na Village, Kaw Ka Taung Cave.
