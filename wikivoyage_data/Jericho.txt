Jericho from the south
Jericho [formerly dead link]  (Arabic أريحا Arīḥā, Hebrew יריחו Yerikho), the "City of Palms", is a small city within the Palestinian Territories close to the northern end of Dead Sea and some 55 km (34 miles) from Jerusalem.


Understand[edit]
A relatively tranquil town, Jericho's reputation for calm and lack of security incidents in the midst of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has made it a natural destination for West Bank visitors. Because Jericho is a tourist-orientated town, the Palestinian Authority goes to great lengths to make sure Jericho remains safe to visit. There is a constant tourist-police presence in the city and English is spoken by many in the town.
The modern town of Jericho includes the ancient mound known as Tell es-Sultan, the accumulated remains of cities that have existed on the site for some 9,000 years – the Neolithic period. Archaeology reveals that Jericho is one of the oldest human settlements in the Middle East.
Jericho, of course, is probably best known for its Biblical associations: (song) "Joshua fought the battle of Jericho – and the walls came tumbling down!"
Due to its location nearly 400 meters below sea level, Jericho is extremely hot in the summer!

Get in[edit]
Remnants of Hisham's Palace
From Jerusalem, start at the HaNeviim station outside the Old City, next to Damascus Gate. From there, one must take take a bus/van to one of three Palestinian cities, and take a second bus/van to Jericho. The three cities are (in order of directness):

(Al) Ezariya (Junction)  – Bus 36 or 63 (₪6.80) reach this town/junction east of Jerusalem, identified with Bethany from the New Testament. Ask the bus driver where to get off for the sherut van (₪10-12 depending on the mood of the driver) to Jericho or take the GPS pointer as orientation. It's advisable that you have an Arabic translator with you or specifically inquire of the bus driver as to where the sherut may be found. Alternatively, take bus 263 (₪6.80) from the Sultan Suleiman station, also close to the Damascus gate, which will stop at the junction too.
Bethlehem – The sherut from the bottom floor of the Bethlehem bus station takes around an hour to get to the central square of Jericho (₪20).
Ramallah and Nablus – Authentic and well worth a visit Palestinian cities
You can also hitchhike from the south along the Dead Sea or from Tiberias in the north. However, the Egged bus coming from there will apparently not stop before Jerusalem to let passengers off – ask when entering.
From the King Hussein "Allenby" Bridge border crossing, there is a direct bus which will deliver you to the 31.86063935.4782221 bus station east of the center, where you will pass through Palestinian border control. From there, it is a 2 km taxi ride or (underwhelming) walk to the city center.

Get around[edit]

It was the location of the ancient Jericho of the Biblical times and is located some 2 km north-west of the modern city centre, overlooking the natural spring of Ein Sultan. If you prefer to focus on other things, then it is relatively easy to see the gist of the site from the surrounding roads. The site's car park features not one but two separate fountains both claiming to be Elisha's spring. A  UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2023. ₪10 (intl. students ₪7).   
31.8762335.453932 Shalom al Yisrael Synagogue Mosaic Floor (in between Tel es-Sultan and Hisham's Palace, there is a synagogue floor from the 6th century CE.

As of Jan 2020, the site is closed and visit is not possible. The synagogue floor is in the basement of a private house belonging to a Jerusalemite family, the Shahwans, at the end of the street.

This tree is referenced in the New Testament due to its association with Jesus' visit to Jericho: "Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through it. Now a man named Zacchaeus was there; he was a chief tax collector and was rich. He was trying to get a look at Jesus, but being a short man he could not see over the crowd. So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, because Jesus was going to pass that way."

There he established a monastery and became known for his righteous life of asceticism and prayer. The story of Gerasimus and the lion, when the saint tamed the animal by removing a thorn from its paw and taught it obedience, became widely known in the Christian world. He is reputed to have attended to the Fourth Ecumenical Council at Chalcedon in 451.The history of the monastery is also linked to another Christian narrative. Mary, Joseph and the infant Jesus were said to have found refuge in a cave here during their flight from Herod.

Tiberias – A large Israeli town in the north and great starting point for Galilee and Golan.
Nablus – One of the oldest cities in the world and famous for its kunafa/kenafeh. If you are on a tight schedule and planning to go to Ramallah, you might want to skip the latter for this more exciting Palestinian city.
Jerusalem – Besides the Dead Sea, a central focus for most people coming to this region.
Dead Sea – One of the most famous things to see/do in Israel and Jordan. Check out Ein Gedi, a Nature Reserve [formerly dead link]  and oasis along the Dead Sea.
Negev & Judaean – Deserts close to the Dead Sea, featuring amazing sites and desert landscapes, including the Ramon Crater and two other craters.
Hiking in the Judaean Desert – Go out to other nearby hiking trails; particularly the Mishmar and Ze'elim streams are very close by.
