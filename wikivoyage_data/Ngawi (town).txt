Stay safe[edit]
Even though Ngawi is not as big and busy as other cities in Indonesia, never let your guard down, because the characteristics of cities like Ngawi also have a reputation among Indonesian people with the same crime rate as other cities in Indonesia. Ngawi also poses some real dangers to visitors especially when crossing very busy roads (the secret is to raise your hand while crossing, and go forward at a predictable speed and direction, allowing traffic to flow around you). Bring your face mask if you are traveling and doing activities on foot during peak hours due to bad air pollution (especially in the afternoon from 15:00 to 19:00). Don't trust people you just met, even if they look friendly.
