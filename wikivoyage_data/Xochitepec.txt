Xochitepec is a small town in the Central Mexico state of Morelos. It is a popular weekend getaway for couples in Mexico City due to its relatively close proximity, its atmosphere of Colonial Mexico with several old churches and nearby haciendas, and its nearby villages with their colorful local traditions.
