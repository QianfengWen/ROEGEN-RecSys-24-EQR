Chiltern is a town in Victoria's High Country. It's known for its Victorian-era streetscapes, and is home to the Grape Vine Hotel, the largest grapevine in Australia.


Understand[edit]
The area around Chiltern is the traditional lands of the Dhudhuroa people. The nearby Yeddonba Aboriginal Cultural Site, in the Chiltern-Mt Pilot National Park, includes artworks created by the original inhabitants of the Chiltern area, including one ochre painting thought to represent a Thylacine, an animal now extinct and which has been extinct on mainland Australia for thousands of years.
Chiltern is one of Victoria's oldest towns; many of Chiltern's buildings are on the National Trust. Many shopkeepers and miners from around Beechworth and the Ovens Valley districts followed the rush and relocated into Chiltern during the mid-19th century.
