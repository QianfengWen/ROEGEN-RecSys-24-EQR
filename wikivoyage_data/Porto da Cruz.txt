Porto da Cruz is a village on the northeast corner of the Portuguese island of Madeira. It is popular with surfers, sunbathers, and hikers. Porto da Cruz has a nice waterfront and small sandy pocket beach. It is also well connected to levadas and mountain hikes.


Understand[edit]

The heart of Porto da Cruz (/ˈpoɾ.tu dɐ ˈkɾuʃ/, POHR-too duh KROOSH) sits on the Atlantic Ocean, with houses stretching into the mountainous terrain that surrounds the area.  A striking escarpment, Penha da Águia (Eagle Rock) looms over Porto da Cruz.
From 1858, an aguardente factory (sugarcane mill and rum distillery), one of many on the island, formed part of Porto da Cruz's industry. The town got its name because the founder of the town marked the harbor with an iron cross.
The houses in and around the village are surrounded by trellised gardens and farms on the steep hills, irrigated by levadas and growing a variety of fruit and vegetables, including sugarcane still today.
Porto da Cruz is a civil parish in Machico municipality.

Get in[edit]
Map of Porto da Cruz


By bus[edit]
Porto da Cruz is reachable from Funchal or the airport on S.A.M. bus routes 53, 78, or 208.  These routes have a number of "variations", so check the schedule carefully. The Expresso variations can be twice as fast from Funchal than a normal line, but less scenic.
Beware: many of these variations skip the airport. If you are coming from the airport, it's often faster to catch any bus to Machico and transfer to the 53, 78, or 208 to Porto da Cruz.

By car[edit]
From Funchal or the airport, take the highway (VR-1) heading towards Santana, then follow signs for "Porto da Cruz". Parking in the village is easy and free.

By foot[edit]
Backpackers will enjoy hiking along from Machico to Porto da Cruz.  Vereda do Larano is a good route along the coast: see details under #Do.

Get around[edit]
The town is just a few hundred metres across, so walking is definitely an option. In addition there are many hiking trails leading out from Porto da Cruz to different attractions further out (see the Do section below), though those are also accessible by car.

Hikes[edit]
Three hikes serve Porto da Cruz, making use of the island's famous irrigation channels (levadas).

32.7614-16.80453 Vereda do Larano. This hike connects Machico and Porto da Cruz along the north coast. From Machico, it begins with the Levada do Caniçal and goes via the Boca do Risco viewpoint. Bus routes or your car can take you back, or some tour companies offer this. Be safe: have a map and a buddy. 12 km one-way. (updated Apr 2016)
32.7644-16.83954 Levada do Castelejo (Porto da Cruz to São Roque do Faial). This levada hike takes you into the mountains and lush pine and native laurel forest, past waterfalls, to the Ribiero Frio (Cold River)—one of the most important sources of water for the north of Madeira, including this levada's source. To find the trailhead, take any of the main roads from the center of Porto da Cruz, uphill (about 40 minutes hiking, or 10 minutes driving). At the blue bar, there's a sign pointing the way. When this road forks, take the right (dry levada) fork a few hundred metres until you see the well-marked trailhead and map. From here it's an easy and tranquil 8.6-km round-trip hike with virtually no elevation change. At the opposite terminus the trail ends at a huge boulder and the Ribeiro Frio. Free. (updated Apr 2016)
32.7793-16.841165 Vereda da Penha d'Aguia (Eagle Rock). This strenuous hike takes you to the 590-metre-high massif overlooking the sea and village. To find the trailhead, take any of the main roads from the centre of Porto da Cruz, uphill (about 40 minutes hiking, or 10 minutes driving). Just before the blue bar, a blue and white "Verada da Penha d'Aguia" sign will point to a levada threading between houses; follow this for 100 m until another sign (whose back is facing you) points to a left-turn away from the levada and up a steep, windy trail. After 40–60 minutes the trail forks: turn right to overlook Porto da Cruz, or turn left to overlook São Roque do Faial. (updated Apr 2016)
Buy[edit]

Eat[edit]
The church
The food served is typically Madeiran; see Madeira#Eat for details of what to expect. Some places are known to charge tourists more than the advertised price: you are under no obligation to pay more than what was agreed, and if you stand your ground, you will help to stamp out this discriminatory practice.

There is a handful of restaurants along the waterfront, all virtually the same quality and price, although you'll get a somewhat wider view of the ocean at Snackbar Piscinas. Reviews are decidedly mixed. (updated May 2020)
32.77415-16.8293 Snackbar Praia da Alagoa. Daily 10:00-23:00. Bar, restaurant and events venue next to the Alagoa Beach. Good for poncha and beef sandwiches. Bad service. (updated May 2020)
