Understand[edit]

Szeged lies on Hungary's south-eastern border, just south of the mouth of the Maros river on both banks of the river Tisza. It is about 171 km south of Budapest on the M5 highway. It is the lowest elevation city in the country and is known as the "City of Sunshine", because it has the most sunny days throughout the year. Szeged is the main city in Csongrád-Csanád county and serves as a commercial and cultural center of the region. The city's population was around 170 000 in 2011.
Szeged's Open Air Theatre Festival held in the summer attracts people from all over Europe. Szeged is also famous for its gastronomy. Its delicious fish soup is known all over the world, and it has its own festival in September. One of the main attractions of Szeged is the River Tisza, that offers possibilities to do different water sports or boat trips. While boasting hundreds years of history, Szeged has been rebuilt almost entirely after the flood of 1879, which destroyed most of the city. Today, with its avenues, ring roads and beautiful palaces, Szeged is one of the nicest Hungarian cities.

Tickets are not always easy to get, but you can always get them from scouts (of course at a higher price) before the show starts. If you are on a limited budget, you can purchase tickets for a lower price and after the show has started you can move to a better (empty) seats.

Of course, the international fast food chains are also present (Burger King, McDonald's, etc.), they are popular mostly among younger people.  Compared to the local fast food places, these chains offer smaller portions for higher prices.

Traditional Szeged-style fish restaurants[edit]
The traditional fisherman's restaurants are a great choice for visitors. Locals also visit these on a regular basis because of their excellent fish soup and wide selection of good other food. There are three main fishmerman's restaurants in town.

46.2506920.151468 Roosevelt Téri Halászcsárda (Roosevelt square Fish Tavern), Roosevelt tér 14 (close to downtown, right across from the Móra Ferenc Museum by the bridgehead of the "old bridge"). (updated Sep 2022)
46.25623920.1805539 Kiskőrössy Halászcsárda (Kiskörössy Fish Tavern), Felső Tisza-Part 336 (in the northeastern part of Szeged, on the bank of the Tisza River.). This is an excellent choice in the warmer months, because you can enjoy your meal next to the river and quite often they will also have musicians perform traditional Hungarian folkmusic or Gypsy music for the guests. You'd probably want to catch a cab to get to this restaurant, and then use another cab to get back to your hotel. (updated Sep 2022)

Hungary has very good home made style pastries and cookies. Szeged has a few bakeries around town that have excellent food selection. Ordering is quite simple, since most of the baked goods are displayed behind a glass window. They are usually freshly baked. Just point and pick what your eyes like and enjoy. Some of the more popular pastry shops around town:

 Hatos Rétes. on Klauzál square, known for strudels ("rétes" in Hungarian). 
 Z. Nagy Cukrászda. One of the best pastry shops in the city, where most of the locals go to. You can find it under József Attila sugárút 24. 
Drink[edit]
 John Bull Pub (downtown, about 50 meters from the Virág Cukrászda). Great place to grab a beer with clients or friends, and can be an excellent choice for a romantic dinner. They have a big menu, with a good selection. Prices: high 
Coffee shops[edit]
Coffee shops are very popular among students. There are quite a few in town, where the younger crowd likes to meet up to study or talk.

Clubs[edit]
Szeged cathedral at night
Szeged is a University town and it has a very active night life throughout the school year. The high school and college crowd gets mixed up at most places, although some clubs try to target specific age groups with their events.
Most places have entrance fees, but offer discounts if you have a student ID. Regular fees are around 500-1000 Forints depending on the day of the week, the place and the event.
Parties are advertised to start early at night, but the crowd doesn't start to gather really until about midnight or 01:00, and usually party until the morning. This is true even on weekdays (for example Wednesday is a very big party night). Many times people meet at local pubs for a drink and talks before hitting these places.

 GinTonic (This is a club in the basement of the older Tisza Hotel in downtown.). It has dance nights every Friday. It is in the same block as Retro, but on the other side of the building. This is a highly popular party place among foreign students who study in the city. They usually play the latest popular dance songs. Ft 800. 
 JATE Klub. This is one of the popular university clubs that is open during the day as well as at night. There is a large bar section and several dance floors with different types of music. Concerts and other cultural events are also common here. If the evening appears to be slow, the crowd might go over to the SZOTE Klub (which is true vice-versa). The high school and college crowd blends really well in this place. They play all types of music from alternative through the latest popular dance songs to older Hungarian favorites. Sometimes they collect entrance fees, but you can get in without a fee if you get there earlier.?. 
 Retro. A newer coffee house, that turns into a dance club at night. Dance nights are held on Fridays and Saturdays. The place mostly attracts graduates, late 20s and above. They like to play songs from the 1980s, 1990s and today's hits. Ft 1000. 
 Sing-Sing. This is one of the largest dance clubs in Southern Hungary. It is  right next to Szeged's main bus station and farmer's market. This club usually attracts the younger high-school crowd (their average age is probably around 20). It is well known for its semi-monthly nude (both male and female) dance shows, concerts with invited guests and teen parties. They usually play the latest dance hits. 
Sandor Pub (Sándor Söröző), Csap Str. 1. (Petőfi-telep its, old name Somogyi-telep or Tápé, about 300 meters from the Tisza River) This is one of the smallest dance clubs. It operates once a month (Szintipop Retró-Video Buli Klub with karaoke).

You will have various choices to stay at while in Szeged. The city has some larger and more expensive hotels, but there are quite a few cheaper and comparable places where you can stay.

Budget[edit]
In Szeged, and in most other, bigger Hungarian cities you can find a cheap room in college dorms. Most places will let you pay cash and stay for a few days. There are a few of these around town and the best way to find one is probably to ask one of the younger, "student looking" locals.
