54.9394-3.96912 Threave Castle, Kelton Mains, Castle Douglas DG7 1TJ (Off roundabout on A75 west of town), ☏ +44 7711 223101. Apr-Sep: daily 10AM-4:30PM, in Oct to 3:30PM. Threave Castle is a much-bashed but still massive tower built in the 1370s by Archibald the Grim, Lord of Galloway. It was the stronghold of the Black Douglases, too strong for King James II liking, so in 1455 he besieged and captured it. It was thereafter in royal control until 1640 when the Covenanters captured and partly demolished it, and it was abandoned. The castle is on an island in the River Dee, so you get there on a little boat, included in the ticket price. Adult £6.   (updated Sep 2019)
Threave House and Gardens
54.9343-3.9283 Carlingwark Loch at the southwest edge of town is a shallow freshwater loch; it and its grassy surrounds have been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). A footpath makes a 3-mile circuit. The islets in the loch were crannogs - prehistoric dwellings on stilts in the water. A canal connects the loch to the river 1.5 miles away: it was used to bring in shell-marl to lime the fields, but it's long disused and now just a ditch. When toxic blue-green algae became troublesome in 2009 the loch was fitted with an expensive aerator, which was ineffective; then they discovered that chucking straw into the water solved the problem.
54.9048-3.90874 Gelston Castle is the shell of a castellated mansion of 1805.
54.9627-3.8525 Motte of Urr is a large earthwork, the remains of a 12th-century motte-and-bailey castle. It was abandoned around 1308 and its wooden palisades were never converted into a stone bastion.
54.933-3.8236 Dalbeattie is a village five miles east of Castle Douglas, formerly a major source of granite. It has a small museum, eating places and accommodation. Dalbeattie was the birthplace of William McMaster Murdoch, First Officer of the Titanic and in charge when it struck the iceberg; he did not survive. Edingham Castle a mile north of the village on A711 is the crumbling remains of a 16th century tower-house.
54.8756-3.81357 Kippford is the main village south of Dalbeattie, as the River Urr opens into a sea inlet, with its east bank dotted with holiday caravans. You can walk along the coast to Rockcliffe (though by car you have to double back onto A710). Here find the "Mote of Mark" a 5th-century hill fort, an art gallery, and Rough Island a bird sanctuary. You can walk to the island at low tide, but access is closed in May and June when the oystercatchers are nesting.
54.8764-3.84398 Orchardton Tower west side of the estuary is the ruin of a late 15th-century tower house. Unusually, it's cylindrical, the prevalent style 200 years earlier but supplanted by rectangular towers.
Orchardton Castle a mile south of the Tower is a Baronial cod-castle, for sale in 2022, offers over £1.7 million. Turn up with a Barbour gilet, a clipboard and a plummy accent, they'll probably show you round.
54.8321-3.80929 Hestan Island is tidal, reached from Almorness Point. You'll want stout boots as the spit exposed at low tide is shingle and mussels. The Stevenson lighthouse has gone, replaced by a functional metal tower. The currents and tides aren't fierce in the bay so you've some flexibility of route and timing, but don't attempt to follow "Daft Anne's Steps", poor lass.
Do[edit]
Red Kite
The Fullarton (formerly Lochside Theatre) is mainly a cinema but has some live shows, tel +44 1556 504506. It's south side of town towards the loch.
CG Swimming Pool is on Market St, open daily.
Spot the Red Kite (Milvus milvus), a raptor with a metre-plus wingspan that curves low over the fields in search of mice, small rabbits and carrion. They were once common but unloved in Britain: Shakespeare's King Lear compares his daughter Goneril to a kite, and suggests that the bird's only talent is for stealing panties off drying lines. Kites were harried almost to extinction in Britain, but from the 20th century they were protected then re-introduced. The Dumfries and Galloway region was repopulated in 1992/93 with birds from Germany. So look out for them anywhere, but especially along the Red Kite Trail which has several feeding stations. The suggested route is 24 miles anti-clockwise round Loch Ken in winter, plus 16 miles of forest roads only open in summer.
Golf: Castle Douglas GC is west side of town. Further out are Dalbeattie GC, Craigieknowes near Kippford, and New Galloway GC in the hills north on the Ayr road.
Knockengorroch music festival in May is away up in the hills above Loch Doon. See  Ayr for details, though it's not close to Ayr or anywhere else, that's the point.
