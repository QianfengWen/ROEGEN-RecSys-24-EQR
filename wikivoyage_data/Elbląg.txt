Elbląg (German: Elbing) is a river port city in northern Poland in the Warmia-Masuria region with over 120,000 inhabitants. In the Middle Ages it was an important Hanseatic seaport serving the Vistula River bay on the early medieval Baltic Sea trade routes.

Understand[edit]
Old Town, new buildings
The city and its port lie on the Elbląg River, which flows into the Vistula Lagoon about 10 km to the north, thus giving the city access to the Baltic Sea via the Strait of Baltiysk.
Elbląg's Old Town area was almost completely destroyed in World War II. The Renaissance, Baroque and Gothic architecture in this area is largely the result of post-war re-creation. The area is pretty enough but doesn't truly reflect the nature of the city. For that you have to wander north a kilometer or two to find the communist new town, which has a charm of its own.

There are direct regional trains from Gdańsk and Gdynia. Some slower long distance TLK trains also calls here, while a change in nearby Malbork is required for high-speed EIP and EIC trains. Additionally, the seasonal train between Kaliningrad and Gdańsk also calls here.

The countryside around Elbląg is picturesque and well worth exploring by bicycle. You can rent bicycles from a shop next to the train station and behind the bus station, or bring your own on the trains that come from Gdansk. Maps of bike routes are available in most bookstores, but be careful- these routes aren't clearly marked and it's easy to lose your way. But the area is small and the locals are ready to help!
