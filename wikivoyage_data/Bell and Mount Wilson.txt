Bell (pop. 44) and Mount Wilson (pop. 81) are two small towns 14 km apart in the Upper Blue Mountains region of New South Wales. While the former has very little of notable interest except a photogenic train station during the winter, the latter contains several privately-run seasonal botanic gardens that shine during autumn and spring. 


Understand[edit]
Bell is both a road junction and railway station, set in surroundings of bush. Its name comes from Archibald Bell Jr., a 19th-century colonial Australian explorer who discovered a route that is today known as Bells Line of Road.

Get in[edit]
By car[edit]
Mount Wilson is around 8 km from Bells Line of Road (B59) and is connected to the main highway via a small narrow but sealed road (with no shoulder). This T-intersection is 7 km east of Bell.
Bell is at the tripoint of Chifley Rd (B59), 15 km east from Lithgow, Bells Line of Rd (B59) and Darling Causeway (unnumbered), 10 km north of Mount Victoria.

By train[edit]
-33.505658150.278861 Bell Station  exists as a request stop (meaning you must inform the guard) supposedly to serve the town of Mt Wilson, but there is no public transit connection between Bell and Mt Wilson, which means that Mt Wilson is only accessible via car. If visiting Bell, there is on average a train to Lithgow every hour.
During winter, many people visit Bell station as it is one of the few stations to receive snow when the Blue Mountains experience snow, resulting in a very photogenic scene.
