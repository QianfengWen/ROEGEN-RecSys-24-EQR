View of the city and Albanian Alps from Rozafa Fortress
Shkodër (Albanian: Shkodra) was the capital city of Albania for centuries until 1915 when World War I broke out. Now it is the second largest city in Albania with 135,612 people.


Understand[edit]
Nowadays, Shkodër has experienced a face lift as streets and buildings were renovated, a promenade opened and a new bridge built over the Buna River. Shkodër is 30 minutes away from the beach or 2 hours away from the mountains.
Furthermore, it seems that Shkodër is the bicycle capital of Albania—the chaos of bicycle going in any imaginable direction and the reckless driving of cars can make you dizzy.

Visitor information[edit]
42.06719.513451 Shkoder Tourist Info Center, Rruga Teuta (Southeast of Sheshi Demokracia). Provide city maps and can help with any of your inquiries, including bus time schedules. 
History[edit]
Queen Teuta's Illyrian kingdom was based here in the 3rd century BCE. The Ottomans besieged it in 1473 and 1479, and lost 14,000 and 30,000 men in these raids, respectively. Shkodër changed hands with Montenegro numerous times during World War I. Shkodër was badly damaged in a 1979 earthquake.

42°4′3″N 19°30′48″EMap of Shkodër
Finding your way round Shkodër is complicated by the fact that all of the roads have been renamed, and some of the old names have even been re-used in different places! All roads have got new road signs. Since all the maps and guides (including this one) give the old names, finding your way round is a bit like being in a parallel universe.
There are some public buses running inside city. There is also infrequent bus to the nearby village of Shiroke.

By bicycle[edit]
Shkodër is the bike capital of Albania, because it's flat. This is a heritage from the Hoxha era. Bicycle can be rented for around 300 lek and are good to reach the lake, the castle and Ura e Mesit, the old Roman bridge.
