Mission San José de Tumacácori
Tubac is a small town in South Central Arizona. In the mid-20th century an art school was established here, and today it is known primarily as an artists' colony, drawing visitors to its many art galleries as well as to the nearby Spanish missions.


Understand[edit]
Tubac (from Spanish Tubaca, derived from the original O'odham name Cuwak – 'rotten') was established as a Spanish colonial garrison in 1752 to protect the nearby Jesuit missions of Tumacácori, Guevavi, and Calabazas from Native Americans in what was then New Spain. It is the first and oldest European settlement in what is now Arizona, and was the starting point for explorer Juan Bautista de Anza's search for an overland route to the Pacific coast, eventually leading to the founding of San Francisco.
In the 19th century Tubac became Mexican after the Mexican War of Independence, and then American following the Gadsden Purchase. During this time the town faced persistent Apache attacks and was twice abandoned, by both Mexicans and Americans; it remained a quasi-ghost town until the early 20th century.
