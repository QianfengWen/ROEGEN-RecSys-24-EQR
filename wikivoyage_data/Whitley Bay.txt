Whitley Bay is a seaside resort in Tyne and Wear in the northeast of England, with a population of around 36,000 in 2013. It was part of Northumberland until 1974 when the borough of North Tyneside was created within the metropolis of Tyne and Wear. The North Tyneside towns of Wallsend, North Shields and Tynemouth are described separately.


Understand[edit]
Causeway to St Mary's island
The first settlement hereabouts was inland on church holdings, which became Monkseaton. The coastal village of Witelei (or Wyteley or Hwyteleg or half a dozen other versions) remained small until the 18th century, then grew with industry based on coal and limestone, and eventually engulfed Monkseaton. In the 19th century it also became a seaside resort. It was always just plain Whitley, but the "Bay" was added in 1901 as too much mail was going astray to Whitby in North Yorkshire. The final straw was a corpse for burial that was misdirected. However this confusion didn't afflict the undead, as Bram Stoker's Dracula was able to bound ashore in Whitby even though he'd devoured everyone who could navigate or sail his ship.
Famous people from Whitley Bay include the TV reporter Kate Adie (b 1945), rugby union player Toby Flood (b 1985) and author Captain WE Johns (1893-1968), creator of Biggles.

Get in[edit]
See Newcastle upon Tyne for long-distance routes. See  North Shields for the Tyne ferry and overnight DFDS ferries from Holland. 

By train[edit]
There are no mainline trains to Whitley Bay. Newcastle Central has frequent trains from London and the Midlands via York, from Edinburgh, and from Carlisle. Change at Central for the Metro Yellow Line. 
The district has three stations on the northern loop of the Yellow Line, with trains running M-Sa every 15 min and Su every 30 min from St James and Monument in Newcastle city centre. It's the furthest point on the loop so either way round takes just under 30 min. From Central Station, it's simplest to take the northbound (clockwise) train via Monument, Haymarket, Jesmond, South Gosforth, Northumberland Park and Shiremoor to 55.0423-1.4581 Monkseaton Metro Station , 55.03983-1.442812 Whitley Bay Metro Station  and 55.035-1.43633 Cullercoats Metro Station . Trains continue to Tynemouth, North Shields, Wallsend, Byker, Monument and St James. You could also take the eastbound (anti-clockwise) train, but this means changing at Monument. After their loop, those trains head along the south riverbank to Gateshead, Jarrow and South Shields. 
From the airport, take the Green Line to South Gosforth and change for the Yellow Line. The Green Line continues southeast to city centre, Gateshead and Sunderland.
The Whitley Bay stations are in Fare Zone C so you need an all-zone ticket for travel to or from Newcastle city centre. In 2022 an adult single is £3.90, and it's the same fare from the city centre, Gateshead or Sunderland. A day ticket is £5.70. Travel from the Airport is cheaper because this only passes through zones B and C (provided you change at South Gosforth) - an adult single for this journey is £3.20 and a day ticket is £4.70.

By bus[edit]
A slightly cheaper alternative to the metro is to use the bus from Newcastle. The two main routes between Newcastle and Whitley Bay are the 308 and the 309 - both take about 40 minutes for the full journey with the 308 operating four times an hour during the day and the 309 operating three times an hour. Other useful services include the 306 (slower than the 308/309 but a more scenic route through Tynemouth), the 317 (a local route through North Tyneside which connects with ferries from South Shields), and the 57 (an hourly service from Ashington and Cramlington). Some buses are operated by Go North East, others by Arriva, and the 317 by Stagecoach; tickets valid on one operator are rarely valid on others but fortunately the different companies use different colours which makes distinguishing between them fairly easy.
There isn't a bus station, buses make multiple stops along the main streets.

By road[edit]
From the south, take A19 to bypass Newcastle to the east and come through the Tyne Tunnel (toll). Take A1058 Coast Road to Tynemouth then A193 north.
From the north, take A19 and via Coast Rd is simplest, but you could also shortcut on A186 / A192.

The buses and Metro trains from the city continue through the district.

Monkseaton is a much older settlement, on lands once belonging to Tynemouth Priory, but no early buildings remain: it's nondescript modern lowrise along Front St south from the Metro Station. The only reason to come is to walk the trail along the disused railway northwest towards Seaton.
55.083-1.4784 Seaton Sluice is a curious little harbour. It was used to export salt, coal and bottles, but it kept silting up. The sluices were lock gates fitted to the natural harbour in the 17th century to pen the high tide then flush the channel clear; in the 18th century a more direct channel was cut. The harbour was disused from the 19th century as larger ports developed elsewhere, and a local pit disaster of 1862 ended the coal exports and the lives of all 204 trapped underground.
