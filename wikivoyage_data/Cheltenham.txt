Cheltenham is an historic spa town in England, which started its development in the early 1700s with the discovery of healing waters. It became very popular after the visit of King George III in 1788, and developed further. You cannot take the waters in Cheltenham, but you can visit the Pump Room to get a feeling for the ambience.


Understand[edit]
Cheltenham
GCHQ doughnut
Cheltenham (pronounced Cheltnum) is now probably most famous for the Gold Cup horse race which takes place in mid-March every year. You'll need to book early to find a room, possibly as early as the previous year. Many people accept rooms anywhere within about a 50 mi (80 km) radius.
It's also famous for housing the top-secret Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) responsible for signals intelligence (SIGINT) for UKUSA by Britain's best computer scientists and mathematicians, in its doughnut-shaped building (designed that way for security reasons).

51.897-2.11 Cheltenham Spa station, Queens Road, GL51 8NP. A little outside the metropolitan area and has frequent rail links to London Paddington, Bristol and the south and Birmingham and the north.   

Golden Valley line: London Paddington → Reading → Didcot Parkway → Swindon → Kemble → Stroud → Stonehouse → Gloucester (reverses at Gloucester) → Cheltenham Spa.
Cross Country Route: Bristol Temple Meads → Bristol Parkway → Cheltenham Spa → Worcester Parkway → Birmingham New Street → Tamworth → Burton on Trent → Derby → Chesterfield → Sheffield → Wakefield Westgate → Leeds → York.
There's a regular bus service (D or E) to the town centre from Cheltenham Spa station:
Stagecoach (D or E): Hatherley → Warden Hill → Rail Station → Town Centre → Racecourse → Bishop's Cleeve → Woodmancote
There is an easy walk through Montpellier into the centre (15–20 minutes). An alternative off-road walking route is The Honeybourne Line but there have been muggings at night. It's too far to walk if mobility is an issue, so take a taxi.

By car[edit]
The M5 reaches Cheltenham from the north and south and the A40 from the East (from Oxford) is also a useful transport link. Parking is rarely a problem now in Cheltenham, but the one way systems can sometimes get a little confusing. With this in mind a good option would be to use the Park and Ride facility National Park and Ride Directory. If you're planning a day at the races, Cheltenham, has its own Racecourse Park and Ride facility.

By bus[edit]
Inside of Gloucestershire[edit]
There are buses from Cirencester, Stroud and other local villages to Cheltenham once an hour.
Several bus services go to Cheltenham from Gloucester. The most direct, comfortable and convenient of these is the 94 (Stagecoach Gold) bus, which as of March 2018 now operates 24 hours a day (except on Sundays).
Less frequent bus services go to and from Tewkesbury, such as the 41 and 42.

Outside of Gloucestershire[edit]
Many national long-distance buses stop at the 51.899624-2.0782412 Royal Well bus station (behind The Promenade) including the Stagecoach S2 bus service and the National Express bus.
The S2 bus travels from Oxford to  Cheltenham several times a day. A single ticket from Cheltenham to Oxford is usually £8.00, but day-return tickets are also available:

S2 (Stagecoach) Oxford → Cassington (A40) → Witney → Curbridge → Burford → Northleach → Andoversford → Charlton Kings → Cheltenham
The National Express has connections to London Heathrow (and beyond). However it's not possible to buy a ticket at the station outside of office-hours, so buy online or by telephone.

By plane[edit]
Nearby Staverton hosts 51.893737-2.1645023 Gloucestershire Airport (GLO IATA), which has regular flights to Jersey.  There are also many private aircraft there, which can be chartered.
Birmingham Airport (BHX IATA) and Bristol Airport (BRS IATA) are each only a couple of hours drive (north and south respectively) and offer a wide range of destinations inside and outside of Europe.
It can take several hours to drive to the London airports (Heathrow (LHR IATA), Gatwick (LGW IATA), Luton (LTN IATA) and Stansted (STN IATA)).

Get around[edit]

By car[edit]
Cheltenham is relatively easy to get around by car. Tourists should be aware of the one-way system when driving in the town centre, although there are plans to possibly alter this under the Cheltenham Transport Plan.
Most parking in the town is paid and is run by NCP or the town council.

By taxi[edit]
Taxis are fairly reliable. If you flag a taxi down or get one from the taxi rank you will be charged from the meter, whereas if you book with a taxi company you will be charged considerably less. Most locals use taxis at night as far as the surrounding villages as night-buses are few (apart from a regular link to Gloucester). At night, taxis wait along The Promenade (it can be very busy at pub-closing times).  Uber "Local Cab" is available.

By bus[edit]
The main bus company is Stagecoach which operates a number of buses around the town, mainly on routes with letters rather than numbers.
The D bus goes from the station through the town centre to the racecourse and on to Bishop's Cleeve. A single from the town centre to the station costs £2.30, and a day ticket for all the Stagecoach services within Cheltenham (Dayrider) costs £4.00.
 The Honeybourne Line. The Honeybourne Line is a walking and cycling path that runs from Cheltenham railway station and Queens Road to Tommy Taylors Lane, Pittville Park and Wymans Brook as well as branching off towards the town centre following the river Chelt. It's an ideal way to walk or ride between the town centre and the railway station avoiding main roads.  When heading into town (walking away from the train station) use the right-hand side tunnel to head for the town centre or use the left-hand side tunnel to head to the racecourse. (updated Oct 2021)

The Wishing Fish Clock

The Wishing Fish Clock by Kit Williams The clock in Regent Arcade was designed by the artist Kit Williams and at 45 ft (13.7 m), it's thought to be the world's tallest mechanical clock. On the hour, in a Rube Goldberg machine-style fashion the duck lays an egg which drops down and the music "I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles" plays as the fish rotates horizontally and releases bubbles from its mouth. If you catch a bubble, you can make a wish!

Stay safe[edit]
Cheltenham is mostly a safe town. The so-called "bad areas" though are Hester's Way to the west of the town centre and Whaddon to the north-east, these areas have large amounts of social housing and are unlikely to be of interest to visitors.

Connect[edit]
As of May 2022, Cheltenham has 4G with EE and Vodafone, and 5G with O2 and Three.
