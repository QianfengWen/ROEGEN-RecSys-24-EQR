Moree is a large town (population 9,311 in 2016) on the banks of the Mehi River in the New England region of New South Wales, Australia.


Understand[edit]
Corner of Heber Street and Balo Street, the main streets
The Weraeria and Kamilaroi people are the indigenous peoples of the Moree district. The European explorer Major Thomas Mitchell went to the district in 1832, and squatters soon followed. The name of the town comes from the indigenous word for either 'long waterhole' or 'rising sun'. Cotton is one of the main industries of the district, established in the early 1960s. Moree is known for its artesian hot-spring baths, and is a popular stop-over for travellers on their way to Lightning Ridge and Bourke. Moree is the main centre of the Moree Plains Shire Local Government Area.
Until the 1960s, the town was strictly segregated, with Aboriginals not allowed to enter pubs or clubs, use the swimming pool, or walk on the sidewalk. In 1965, members of the Freedom Ride tried to gain entry to the pool, leading to riots and international news coverage. The ban was repealed shortly after.
